The most frustrating part is the lack of communication. Making games is hard. If certain features that were promised are taking longer to be implemented, it’s understandable.  But you have to say something. You have to update your paying customers with the status of features they paid for. Otherwise, you’re sending the message that you’re a liar who just makes things up to sell a product, with no intention of ever coming through. You lose the trust of your player base and they stop paying for your services.

---
Logging on to play the beta but not realizing it was only live at certain times. Also playing with two friends who have long since quit the game and jumping off the new river bridge a bunch lmao.
---
They are the best😅
---
As with real life, the point of locks is to keep honest people out. Anyone who wants to bypass that lock will. Just like IRL.
---
They only character in this game I flat out wanted to shoot in the face 100 times.....
---
I ground out rep to ally normally, only started happening in the pst week or so. I mean it makes it so I don't have to get their "last water-cooled bones aw" that isn't really their last.
---
unless you're trying to get the "destroy 1100 robots using X weapon" atoms, in which case those turrets also count as robots.
---
I’m honestly astonished that fallout first gained any ground in the first place...I can understand other transactions ive seen on other games but this was the most egregious thing I have ever seen and so abhorrently unjustified for the price
---
You should. Good luck with that bud. I hope it works out. I really do.
---
I remember picking them up for 200 caps before they were a requirement for legendary ones
---
this is great! Thank you!
---
Xbox has been brutal the last couple days. Haven't been disconnected this many times since launch
---
You'll never play again then. Bethesda doesn't have the motivation to improve this game to any appreciable degree.
---
I remember seeing that event up all the time but I never did it. Then one day several months ago I remembered it and learned it was scrapped. What a shame.
---
Got a pic?
---
*They'll never take our freedom!*
---
Troubleshooter is also a godsend for Encryptid.
---
Obviously Roger Maxson, who was the guy who sent the Vault Dweller off to do something none of his own men could do expecting them to die.
---
It looks awesome.
---
It's been in the game for free for over a year. You're moaning now?
---
Missing features you can have for money each month is repulsive. People have said, "It's not the Bethesda I know". But the reality is, yes it is, cast your mind back to *horse armour*.
---
Maybe we disagree on definitions. The event isn’t a resource sink.  Why would Bethesda care how much steal you have?  They don’t!  Just because you say Bethesda is trying to get rid of our stashes doesn’t make it true.  
---

---
Then, what’s a new player.  To me, first character at level 120, yep, new player.  
---
Fun is what you make of it.  If you dread washing the car it’s going to be a chore.  Someone else takes pride in the same task and doesn’t see it as an inconvenience at all.  If you want to have fun in 76, then make it fun!!  Or, make it an awful experience.  Up to you.
---
I'm a chef and i only work during daytime. I have a good amount of free time. 
---
Doing queens takes a little time if you know how do handle it.
---
They originally listed that as a feature of FO1st but never implemented it, just to later remove it from the list.
---
So you probably aren't getting it anytime soon. But I do agree that it would be great.
---
I'd love to join up too. The reclaimers sounds like a cool idea.
---
The way loot piles work in ESO should be implemented in 76. You kill something, the loot appears on the body, you kill something else and the previous loot transfers to the most recent kill. Now you’re not wandering around cranberry bog trying to see flies through the tall grass after a queen fight. Would probably also help overall performance.
---
have finally managed to boot it up.
---
Al my games are gone.
---
Not even going to bother with any installs until i change the drive.
---
Zero point in spending best part of a day  downloading 80 gigs of 76 to run on what looks like a faulty hard drive.When a new Seagate 2tb Firecuada ssd arrives Monday.
---
Good news is i lugged on to my PSN account and all my awards and friends are there.
---
I am hoping the only permanent loss will be my photos.That my progress is saved at Bethesda end.
---
Nah, it was bad before too. Just because the latest thing you're comparing it to is worse, it doesn't suddenly make the past thing better.
---
Stopped playing after the Christmas event last year.
---
A good thought, but even if we managed to get everyone (or even a significant portion) to uninstall, Bethesda would just give up on the game and stop updating, not fix it. What DOES fix it is playing It and directly pressuring them. I mean, while slow, it's BEEN working.
---
Thank you!
---
Genocide tied up in a try-hard militaristic bow
---
Its kind of a pointless side grade, as opposed to upgrade. Think of it as a place holder power armor. If there is nothing else you want to spend the gold on, it's definitely not bad thing, and its nice you can just keep grinding out the gold to get it and the mods you want. But there is nothing special or unique about it, paints and skins are limited, and in play you shouldn't notice much of a difference in defense over older power armors.
---
I think quite a few people here need to take a course on statistics and random numbers......
---
No thank you.  I’m satisfied with what I’ve received so far from my Fallout First membership.
---
Best of luck.
---
Don' believe so, no.
---
True. Who knows they could even write something like he was trying to construct another epicenter of the unity on the East Coast to maximize efficiency.
---
yeah like "saving" a ws instead of having to place it again, as that's essentially impossible, just claim a workshop, hit a button and get your build back, would be a great compromise for adventure as well.
---
With enough of us unsubscribing from Fallout 1st and uninstalling, Bethesda will see the numbers drop - they will have no choice but to act. Right now it's all we have left, because we're all complaining week after week about the same things yet still spending money unsatisfied
---
Thank you. It's a pretty easy concept. Vault 76 Dwellers wearing their jumpsuits and maybe power armor or combat armor and such.
---
this old song again?
---
Fallout 1: John Maxson. Grandson of Roger Maxson. Born 2097, and became a paladin in 2135, then high elder in 2161.
---
He is 65 when you first meet him and he sends you off to the northern toxic wastes.
---
Yeah, which platform are you on?
---
He doesn't need to repair all the pipes if he has picklock 3 and hacking 3. Destroying cores is fast if you have an explosive gun, especially an explosive automatic gun.
---
That leaves repairing cores, which _can_ be done if you're willing to put up carrying the broken cores from a previous run or go into the silo with a batch of 15 repaired cores. 
---
Can it be done in 10 minutes without the door glitch? Dunno, but there are sufficient legit bypasses that circumvent some of the challenges you mentioned.
---
I don’t know much about coding but it feels like they just stack stuff on top of each other instead of it all being 1 thing . When you join a world open the map and watch how the newer content takes longer to appear than the original
---
for those keeping track, thats a total of 8400.
---
since math is apparently hard lol
---
regular secret service armor is better use of gold
---
I'm on PS4. @Cpl_Hamknuckle.
---
 ALBA GU BRATH!!!
---
Ah darn, I'm on PC
---
i didnt use calculator and i faild math XD i will change it right now
---
Acid is east, put your camp on an Acid spot and build an acid extractor
---
Her limbs can't be crippled that's why she doesn't land as often it's a bug and Bethesda is aware of it and they mentioned in the latest patch notes that they're planning on fixing her next patch
---
Any resolution to this issue yet?
---
Still don't think all that can be done in 30 seconds.
---
its amazing... bethesda worst enemy is bethesda itself :facepalm:
---
That's okay. We could probably do multi platform stuff. I just need people who know how to do Discord stuff.
---
before it was tedious cuz i had to do things one at a time.
---
now, because i dont want to enter a larger quantity option and be told i dont have it, i still do, but with added "YOU DONT HAVE THIS AMMO" screens for every type.
---
sorry i didnt memorize all the ammo i looted in the past hour, i guess?
---
I quit. I still have this sub on my app, mostly to update the wife.
---
Do you think upvoting the same complaints each week is a better resolution? This is an echo chamber of every flaw of the game and nothing's really changed. I feel this could be the resolution to the problem.
---
Only thing I noticed is super laggy on the one queen I did yesterday
---
RaRa definitely took Preston's place as worst character in the series.
---
I can kinda do discord stuff so I'll try setting it up then.
---
We waited a month and then like six hours on the day of for a patch that removed double-sided walls.
---
were people standing on top of tents or on the fences, by any chance?

&gt;Maybe we disagree on definitions. The event isn’t a resource sink
---
What else would you call something where you pour a lot of resources into? That's literally the definition of a resource sink.
---
&gt;Then, what’s a new player. To me, first character at level 120, yep, new player.
---
What? How is that a new player when that would take dozens of hours, maybe even well over a hundred. New player is starting a game up for the first time until around the time they beat it for the first time.
---
As for your last part, you keep making me out to seem like this event is stupid, terrible and a chore and hard to do. Which you still keep missing my point. Which I'm not going to bother repeating again because you keep twisting it around and making it seem like I'm bashing the game (Which the game itself does a well enough job doing that and doesn't need me to do it for it)
---
Yeah, I restarted my PS4 and tried again and it worked
---
Some, yes.
---
Bloodied knuckles 95% of the time. TSE handmade for turrets, swap between a bloodied and an AA .50 for the queen. Running mutations and perks I can solo anything besides imposter speechsquatch.
---
I have a 5 second rule with Gutsies
---
Stay clear.
---
Queen event can be a sickner for losing fluxes..
---
You waste all that Ammo to get killed by an insta-spawn right behind you as you were looting the Queen.
---
Kill her......approach with caution.
---
That's awesome, thank you
---
This drives me crazy. To me, the bug is that it doesn't actually work - the text reads "When you craft **anything** \- there is a xx% chance you'll get double results". I believe quest items aren't included. I also believe "bulking" isn't included. The quest items I can see us just accepting as "we can't have you breaking the system and having multiple quest items", and the bulking I can see as "you're not crafting something, you're just .... grouping them together". 
---
But legendaries? They absolutely should be covered in this. Give me the same roll, so I have something I can scrip. Give me two different rolls, so I have a better chance to get what I really want. But give me the sound but don't give me the item? Boo!
---
My guess though is that for Bethesda, the bug is that we're hearing the sound - and if it gets fixed, the fix will be to remove the sound.
---
Yeah, it works. (i use a 360 controller )
---
[deleted]
---
I'd like that. Just reinforcing the concept, essentially The Reclaimers are just the Vault 76 Dwellers accomplishing the goal of their Vault, while still maintaining their Vault-Tec theme, like still wearing their jumpsuits, using High Tech technology, using mass produced armor, etc.
---
I scrapped mine last night and dumped ammo at a train station. Its back to not picking it up/dumping it. Its unusable and how the fuck they saw it as an improvement is beyond me.
---
The old way was awful but Id gotten into the rhythm of using it and it was acceptable. Its not worth the space now.
---
This is my favorite ammo other than fusion cells to throw into the ammo converter
---
i hear that causes an issue. if those people standing on shit are the ones who aggro the queen, she'll never land for some reason. i dont know the details but i've heard it repeated enough to consider it a possibility.
---
Players can sell items to NPC vendors and other players can buy said things. I've found legendary items for sale on vendors who show up in my camp as well as vendors at train stations, etc.
---
Cya lying duper
---
if only someone could mod her into skyrim so i could take the pleasure of killing her by throwing her off a mountain
---
Y’all lazy asses can send all your ammo to my camp just north of Grafton.
---
Gonna be honest here, the game is stupidly easy. TOW can have good story, interesting dialogue, awesome factions and characters, yeah all that stuff. 
---
But it is a videogame, it has to be challenging. I played it in the second highest difficulty (not the highest one because of companions permadeath) and the game becomes a walk in the park when you pass the first area. Frankly, when the first skill check only asks for 1 in medicine you know the game is going to be trash.
---
Can you spam through all of them and report how many plans of any PA you get?
---
i power my way through it in full power armor and a VE 50 cal
---
Check the shed at Aaronholt farm...the one by the grain silos. PA spawns there...pull up the transfer window and take the 3 pieces. Weapons bench is right there for scrapping... I only mention the weapons bench because it sounds like your interaction with the PA bench isn’t going well
---
I was scared because I thought other players could access my stash box.
---
I love my chainsaw! It chews through so many enemies when I’m low on shotgun ammo
---
I only have the duffel bag I think those are free with fallout 1st
---
For me it never disappears even after I claim it but it goes away when the items leave probably just a bug or something
---
Gotchu, I'll set it up as best I can. My discord is birby#0775
---
I don't think this can be upvoted enough. I know I can choose to play about 5 seconds before the atomic shop and legendary run choices are available, but I always wait to see if there is something free.
---
People get so impatient, but will then complain because they didn't see something.
---
It’s not just the queen, it’s any scorchbeast really.
---
why do some of you make things hard for yourself and then complain about the thing you've made hard for yourself? 
---
I went in to my stash. got 300 missiles. went to the converter. And then i converted 300 missiles with 3 transactions. Then i converted the points into 2mm EC. i only did it to get rid of the missiles. Not gonna use it again as i'd rather sell ammo for 1 cap and buy ammo for 1 cap. 
---
but come on. Just look at how much ammo you have in your inventory and then click buttons.
---
Sent.
---
ive always just dropped in on the ground and was able to see it with my other characters.
---
Scrap everything mod in fallout 4. Does someone remember how satisfying it was?
---
Make that 8
---
I believe it. I was playing a few days ago and I kept getting Vanguard's armor. A month or two ago, I had one brilliant, beautiful day where everything I killed dropped Junkie's weapons (I run Junkie's). This is how I got some of my most beloved legendary items. It is a little too coincidental to be random.
---
“I ain’t afraid of you! Even if you are my elder!”
---
Ehh more grind than anything and a bunch more promises that will be broken no doubt
---
Or you can click the Atomic Shop Weekly Update?
---
The rest is valid, but if you read the weekly update, its pretty clear what the prices are for FO1st members.
---
tried moving the bed and putting it up first? 
---
I couldn't place candles on the wall when the display case was there but if i placed the candles first and then the display case it was fine
---
&gt; are people actually donating substantial amounts?
---
I always assume these "reach x goal" community events are rigged ~~from the start~~
---
Lol this is why I feel for the devs. Why on my system was that not doable till update 21, but it did work for you???
---
Yeah, I get that sometimes.   When that happens, I either pretend my character is tired of being sober, or that they had some kind of anime-like origin story flashback, depending on how stoned I am
---
Yes! Me and about 15 other players killed her with 7 minutes left last night.  A little to close for comfort
---
Like the sound of that....anything simple by a river and the volume is up, I’m a sucker for.  
---
Having said that, mine is currently next to a cliff so....time to move maybe.
---
That’s where you just need two pieces of armor with reduced fall damage as the tertiary effect. 
---
Ideally, on your chest piece with the Jetpack and one piece that you always keep on you. 
---
With two of those equipped, you take no fall
---
damage at all. From any height.
---
Yeah, on controller it's Start &gt; Right directional &gt; click right stick for the board.
---
have bethesda once looked at a thread on here and done anything? Serious question. 
---
And also. The people here need to realise they are a very SMALL portion of the people who play this game. So if 10 people here decided to cancel their FO1st bethesda wouldn't even notice.
---
I have to agree just based on my own experience. I've done uranium fever on a private server before, and ended up with the same primary effects, or variation of, on weapons and armor.
---
Side note, it only happens for me with hunters, mutants, or nocturnal.
---
Just drop your stuff to a friend, switch characters and have your friend drop the stuff again. Or just deposit the stuff in some random ass suitcase in the middle of nowhere and reconnect with your friend still on the server.
---
When I’m not perked and don’t use any buffs, I’ll notice grenades barely do sufficient damage. But other times they will. It seems inconsistent to me and platform dependent as it seems not every platform has the same issues across the board
---
Nah
---
I suspect sooner, mostly because of the outcry. Why sit on it for then when you can pushing it out and say "hey, sorry, but we do listen, promise."
---
They’re special to me, the Satanist
---
Shhhhh, it's a feature some of us like. It's great when you need a whole lot of steel. Get on board!
---
With the ferocity and accuracy of how quickly those feral ghouls and charred attack, pretty sure in their perception is something far superior to vats
---
Hence why the more accurate term is calling it pseudo-random.
---
Explosives are definitely overpowered weirdly ad there are no defenses to them. But yeah, we can agree to disagree on the power armor; I’ve emptied at least 5 clips before into one before they finally died. To me, it seems damage resistant.
---
Havent' had this issue happen to me yet(XB1). Is this like during or after the event that this bug happens?
---
Are you saying it’s over between us?
---
FWIW, here are the last 70 SS armor rolls I got. I haven’t run stats yet, but seems random enough to me. (The first couple dozen or so are alphabetical, but after that they’re in the order I rolled them.) The initial number is how many stars.

He was supposed to be incredibly intelligent. It would make sense that he would have found out about there being other research centers. Just a question of if he could have communicated with them from so far away at this time. Personally, I don’t mind retcon’s. Those games are decades old and it was made by people that have moved on from a dissolved game studio. At some point, I think it’s ok to make changes for a more enjoyable narrative. Most players don’t even know the master, at the least some sort of connection would bring attention back to the og games.
---
20000\*, I mean it's not a cosmetic, it's an entire system !
---
Or it's 2000 for the workbench and then another 1200 for every single robot mod, that sounds about right.
---
It's Captain to you, wastrel
---
Also going to add avoid interiors (West-Tek, The Burrows). The golf club? Only if you're bored or in the area but everyone goes there. 
---
Focus on Super Mutants heavy areas. Watch the people who are there before you. If you decide to run NIRA and you see Masters, Butcher's and Enforcers. Someone low level probably 60-75, was looking for legendaries too. So you have to clean up the 'shit wave' and wait for respawns. Usually 10mins or so to happen. 
---
There's at least 4 places that are populated by Super Mutants no one even goes to. 
---
Downside from hunting them exclusively. The hounds also spawn in as legendaries and the don't drop anything really useable. 
---
Lastly, do a quick Google search for 'assault type random encounters'. Ever encountered a Sheepsquatch in the wild? Or hunted a Colossus. Those areas. To name a few:
---
Excelsior Model Home - The Mire
---
Crater north of Huntersville
---
Crater near Monorail Elevator
---
All the groves in Cranberry Bog
---
Nar repair yard - Cranberry Bog
---
Any place Distant Thunder event happens
---
Information shack north east of Huntersville
---
Between Hopewell Cave and Sons of Dane
---
You'll get rep, a Sheepsquatch (Colossus when nuked) or a legendary enemy. You have a 2/3 chance at these spots for a legendary.
---
I got me first 4 v 1 win yesterday! Pretty good feeling!
---
Yeah I'm wondering this, I only had the hat show up to get with the backpack
---
Well I’d suggest you do a bit of research then specifically on those two builds.  Also 1 h tends to be the weakest of the 3 choices. It’s always a good idea to research builds and get an understanding of what the perks cards do to contribute to the build as well as overall synergy in the build.
---
I can’t wait to get that constellation lamp! Is it working consistently now post-patch?
---
Edit: Also, what’s that big planet at the top from? Is that a projection from the lamp?
---
See, this is what I want instead of constant bitching and complaints! Good work wastelander!
---
They have a secret cabal with the mole men. That’s why they come out of all the side tunnels.
---
If you notice it stops working all you gotta do is unequip them and re equip them and your back at it. I havent found a gun that it doesnt work on yet asides from the bow/compound bow. I havent tried a crossbow yet
---
Ok thank you
---
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
---
It's really not that hard.
---
1.  Check all ammo into stash.
---
2.  Take all of three or four ammo types you want to convert into points, back into personal inventory.
---
3.  Go to ammo converter and use the highest amount increments for those ammo types.  Once you go through the menu, spam A to repeat.
---
4.  When you can't convert any more at the highest increment, choose the next highest increment.  Repeat.
---
It's clunky but it's much more usable with the new higher increments.
---
If you just can't even with it, still, you are a spoiled pathetic candy-ass and when civilization really does come crashing down, you will be the first ingredient listed on the nutrition facts label for Strange Meat Pies.

You couldn't call it a hot fix with server down time.
---
Yeah,its really strange where armor is in this game after wastelands. The big problem is the diminishing returns on resistance. Both power and regular armor are basically tapped out on damage resistance. Then they added the stealth suit, the ss jet pack, and easily craftable legendary armor.  Basically the only tools they have left to offer better armors is legendary power armor, power armor set bonuses, and different standard armor set bonuses. Instead of the normal improved end game armors to prepare you for the new,  upcoming end game, it feels like all the cool toys you get in the last dlc of a game.
---
The game trivializes itself as soon as you decide on one weapon type for a build. You could be crazy OP in FO4, I remember stopping a run at level 20/25 because the build was just too strong, think it was a stealth gunslinger with the deliverer, literally cleared a room with one vats use, with AP to spare and nobody having noticed anything.
---
Okay so I scrapped VATS and moved to a [rifle/grenade](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f36f83&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2c72ic4s12a72lt2ih2eh2sg2id0a04cu1pq1pj0ib2sw2&amp;w=i71im1in1if2ie2iq2) build and got some of the perks you said about, I kept the gunsmith and power patcher because energy weapons break really fast and i like the safty net of slower degradation.
---
I have to try this next time it happens to me. I usually have to exit the game and come back to get out of my power armor.
---
For folks on PS4 I had a lookout camp placed for photo ops about a month before Wastelanders came out until I got forced to move.

---
I’d love a mister handy that talks as a vendor station.
---
I would actually like that, I really enjoyed all the options you had and the workbench is already in the game so that's a start at least.
---
Ah, the old sunk cost fallacy.
---
I had nothing in storage because I had made a bunch of ammo weeks ago. So I had to forage for 100% of the steel I was donating. After 18 hours I was able to make 6 donations.
---
I got 100% garbage as rewards.
---
I will not be donating again. As a player, I think if we were to fail this community event, it would be the best thing to happen to this game.
---
I want to think that, as building is most my time. But we are still missing assets like the mountain scout mask that was supposed to be free for pre-wastelanders players. 
---
I think most their team rn are 3D artists that understand how to retexture and only a couple programmers that would need to be involved for making a new wall type. And with so many bugs from the recent update plus colossal problem unfinished... idk. I’ll just leave it at I hope you’re right
---
No just no. A max lvl 45 weapon is the most coveted endgame weapon hands down, with bloodied 2525 rolls being worth a fortune and you want it buffed more?
---
How about other weapons getting buffed so build diversity is a thing. Handmades are fuckin strong dude, just because you feel like you have to reload once in a while doesn't warrant a damn buff.
---
Power armor breaks so slowly anyway you really don't need power patcher actually on until you want to repair.
---
I think one of the NPCs says something about them not having cleared all the tunnels yet.  They probably just come in through another, unknown, entrance.  Unless it’s a more stupid reason (not impossible)
---
I don’t see what quitting will do to send a point. But canceling the 1st subscription was a no brainer
---
Yeah, but would you pay 3 caps for it? XD
---
that's not an argument, as junk can be stored in a server friendly way (see scrap box) the only thing needed is a max for unique individual items
---
Four spoken lines by an NPC is what you call new content?
---
this happens to me a lot recently .  why haven't they fixed this steaming garbage ass game yet !!!!!!!????
---
Poor intern :( can’t catch a break!
---
They want you to buy FO1st for the scrap box with unlimited scrap capacity, if you want to have any room in your still 800 stash for legendarys or things to display in camp
---
Yes you are totaly right.
---
I didn't have to name stuff again on PS4 (weapons), but it does remove all of your photos from the game/loading screens
---
Apparently they are still stored somewhere on your PS4 but i have not looked for them
---
Ammo converter or not....how the fuck were you able to Rammadeus 300 missiles into your stash?  Do you own nothing?
---
Agreed! We need more stuff to make it seem worth it.
---
If it feels like a grind they're doing it wrong.
---
My PS4 pro became a brick after the last update.
---
After having no problems before what so ever.
---
The update triggered a corrupted Game message on the TV,PS4 literally spit the Disc out.
---
After the update the game was lagging terribly.I had the Blue screen of death 4 times, just collecting Lead Ore at Lucky Hole mine.
---
Fast travel would result in the Cog just spinning out in the bottom corner of the TV screen.
---
Then the inevitable happened during the event at Mama Dolce,PS4 froze during the game crashed totally. Wouldn't even turn off.
---
Refused to boot up.
---
Only option Safe mode tried everything before reluctantly and with a heavy Heart going for "Factory reset"
---
Even that did nothing for about 6 hours.
---
I was stuck in a loop of Booting up in safe mode to getting the Data base Is Corrupted Message.
---
On the point of not even waiting for a replacement hard drive and lobbing it through a window,the Beast awakened.
---
Everything gone,the lot,all my games.
---
I am not even bothering spending a day reinstalling 80 + Gigs of 76 on a Hard Drive that might work,but more likely will write only 99% of the game to the disc before saying"Hey Arsehole the Data base is corrupted again".
---
I have ordered a 2tb Seagate Firecuda SSHD that  should arrive Monday until then i get to detox.
---
All i will say to fellow PS4 players originally i made a connection between that 76 update and my Hard Drive.Which is only natural considering i had no problems before.
---
Having had to spend a day trying every option in the PS4 Safe Mode Menu and watching Youtube Videos.I noticed there are quite a lot of PS4 owners experiencing problems with their PS4 over the last few months.Apparently the hard drives in them are Dog shit to keep production costs of the console down.
---
A lot of the problems gamers were reporting was lagging etc.
---
My point here is i virtually bought the PS4 Pro when it hit the shelf as did many others.And right now you can find dozens of posts from owners reporting hardware issues.
---
Sure some problems are with the game.Or like me is your hard drive failing.
---
They clearly blast their way in from the surrounding caves. That 's why they appear after explosions in the salls.
---
Lmao hell nah.   I get too much of it as is
---
This. I haven't found a way to track over all donations against a published goal. which means if we colletively donated 5 steel as a player base, that will probably be enough to win the day.
---
Can you imagine a scenario in which Bethesda is forced to announce that we DIDNT meet this goal? There's no way that happens.
---
Given how they don't care if something spawns inside their camps at either end and begins killing things, the Blood Eagles just probably walk in.
---
Yes
---
There is no way on earth this isn't a lie.
---
yea ive had it work for me everytime, im on PC. You guys got me nervous though now!!
---
Was just about to post this and this was the first thread I saw!
---
Thanks, I’ve been finding my own way of doing things since fallout 3, you could say I’m an expert now lol
---
It also wont let you place them on any of the vanilla walls.
---
Not something I have personal experience of but Im wondering what else the time thing applies to. Might be risky for transferring to mules too
---
I still think, weight is not the best way to help stability, a slot system would be much more sensible, as the actual thing that puts load on the server are unique item stacks, not the larger stacks or heavier items. Performance wise there is no difference between 10 legendary missle launcher and 10 legendary pistols, while you could probably store way more of those in the current system.
---
You could just say a max of 100 different items or something, that would make the most sense performance wise and also be fair to all "classes"/weapon-types (obviously that number should be adjusted with test to be reasonable I'm just saying something arbitrary as a placeholder)
---
Yea but it be cleaning if it six legendary instead of x2
---
Yeah
---
In moderation.
---
Whenever. It's a requirement to launch a nuke. Many people have done low level nuke launches.
---
Long as you not shocked how much you die.
---
Ahh okay i took it out and maxxed out demo so i have a point to spare now
---
Good for you? So what?
---
Question: the last time you shopped with Graham, how many of his plans did you NOT know?
---
Buddy of mine has to submit a ticket almost every month to get his atoms.
---
Number 9, just said that people try to give u information and u just piss on It
---
Yeah but when you place it it snaps into place.
---
That would kind of defeat the purpose though. As I just said I think the option to stop at 3 should still be there, if you just mean that it should be that way visually in order to be cleaner, that's fine as long as it's specified in the description, so it's not misleading
---
I know explosive bullets make a gun break faster .
---
YOu're getting downvoted but can you imagine the public shame if as a community, we failed this event? It's rigged for us to win because the bad press if we fail is something Bethesda would never allow.
---
Magic
---
Yeah.. True Story. Wait a minute, as a matter of fact the Punch Bowl would deserve a Anti Matter paint, right?
---
I am using a two shot explosive handmade, but its my daily use and I swear it normally didn't break that fast
---
Read my post above.
---
Might be a sign of what is coming.Hopefully not.
---
While I can’t confirm it myself, I can confirm I’ve seen at least 2 other threads about this issue. Apparently even having a friend stay in the private server doesn’t work because it will tell you they are in a private server when you try to join.
---
All I said was this is funny. You supposedly got 8 junkies weapons in a row? Good for you. Keep crafting.
---
an in game meter is what is lacking. You click donate and the box just says "donate 250 more" and you get no gratification at all.
---
She's basically a Tiny Tina from Borderlands knock off, just not done as well. After doing that quest on two different characters, I still hate her less than PITA, even though I barely interacted with PITA.
---
I got a junkies/swing speed super sledge for like 300 caps off a vendor bot once. People sell some wild stuff.
---
You dont need to request something they are already guna do.
---
This the 30th time I've seen someone delete a comment to stop their  karma from bleeding completely out.
---
All these rookies being shell-shocked by the old 400lb stash. Pathetic. Real hardened veterans remember the days of 200lb stash
---
I feel that it's shitty, but it's up to Bethesda to chase that down, not something I need to worry about.
---
I’m guessing one wasteland is going to be the beginning of new mechanics. Probably not right away, but as a signal that the game has finally entered a new phase. That’s how it was for eso, they were struggling until after one Tamriel and then they started pouring serious time into it.
---
I have to assume at some point the will just decide: this is or isn’t worth it. They never seem fully committed to their long-term projects till well after launch.
---
Honestly feeling the same way. My railway was repaired before a queen and was on deaths door at the end
---
Hmm. Mine won't
---
Wish it was crafting atleast I get better stuff
---
Never said in a row ether
---
I can just imagine the resulting text... 
---
1. Dupers R Us
---
2.  DupeDupe
---
3. Duper 4 Life
---
4. Burn Bethesda Burn
---
5. Hang Todd
---
Not forgetting the honerable runners up: I'm not contributing, cancel my FO1st, Uninstalling,
---
And don’t forget to summon the mothman at the lighthouse
---
Honestly it does good damage on a queenie. Great for keeping aggro.
---
Yeah that’s pretty much true but I would assume they’d rule out anybody like that
---
Highly doubt anyone will sell you one for that cheap but you never know. The plan usually goes for 7-10k alone.
---
fallout 1st BAYBEEEEEEE
---
just had a clear out and got my stash down to like 370. So went on my ammo mule and grabbed all the missiles i had and transferred them over.
---
Do you honestly believe it'll help any? There isn't a deadline that Bethesda is willing to miss. It'll be exactly the same thing but delayed.
---
[removed]
---
I always look when it says free but have the worst luck finding it. Then I look again there it is ahahahah
---
A lot of MMOs have gone this direction for better player retention. In FFXIV you had a weekly cap on basically scrip and I would catch up on the weekend to make sure I capped out. If I had to play every day or miss out though? I would have quit a lot sooner.
---
Try placing it anywhere it will let you, then picking it up and moving it. Can help sometimes. Good luck!
---
No it is not
---
Simples...they've been watching the YouTube Glitching videos.
---
Id have done this long ago if I wasn't on console :(. 
---
I'd purchase a new console now, especially because COVID means lots of time for games, but PS5 is going to be launched soon. So I hope there's cross platform between ps4 and 5 for FO76  because I will have two copies when that day comes...
---
Lol! Assuming they rule out anybody like that... That's adorable :)
---
I hope so, this game has a lot of potential. I'm hoping with that Amazon series on the horizon they'll start throwing some money at it, because right now its in a precarious position. Cyberpunk is likely to have an impact, and if they launch a new Fallout title before this game is on a really good footing they'll be asking the last player to turn off the servers when they leave.
---
Might have been this guys https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4xxcb/dont_take_whats_not_yours/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
/s
---
That responders tag is cute :)
---
Man they need to do anything they can to make more weapons viable.
---
Better late than never I guess. To both.
---
They all have Blue Ridge outfit, gasmask and backpacks as disguises. They just remove them before they come running.
---
Yes I do it all the time, but the first time I launched one solo it sucked, and it was really stressful I won't lie.   I've gotten a lot better at it since then.  What platform are you on?
---
I've seen multiple posts about this, only starting today. I'd guess OP that you and a few others have found a bug. 
---
For the rest of us, no using fo1st to swap items for now...
---
They would probably ban their names...for about 2 weeks before quietly putting the plaque back up again.
---
you'd probably be looking at around 7k i reckon for a 1\*
---
I am not a fan of PvP at all, but I do appreciate how they implemented it. I hate that games like RDO allow you to be killed with a single shot. At least here the individual has an option to walk away.
---
Yea at least you could get some cool stuff from them
---
Bethesda actually promised this for Fallout 1st subscriptions, they just never delivered on it!
---
Insanely Easy.
---
Trick is using different Weapons on different enemies.
---
I have a bloodied level 45 Black powder Rifle that one shot kills all Assaultrons and Gutsies from a safe distance.
---
You simply have to make the first shot count with these and Gutsies.
---
If you dont then you [die.No](https://die.No) matter what your level you are.
---
Once you figure out where they all spawn you will pick them off with ease.
---
Guess it’s time for the cap grind lol
---
Neither does war.
---
You might be able to do it on Encryptid if somebody gets downed in the puddle.
---
Oh no!
---
I'll try that!
---
Pretty sure it's 'Vertibird' and will prolly be part of the BoS stuff as a result, or offered in the Atom Shop to coincide with BoS Events.
---
I have a flamer that has all the upgrades to upgrade damage (111 energy damage rn) and it’s durability literally burns away
---
Every server I was on today was struggling with chugging lag issues!
---
Yeah the ol Bethesda left awhile...people are just taking awhile to catch on
---
Oh please do nerf Bloodied.
---
I depends on where you are on your grind. I have all the SS armor plans I need (until deep pocketed comes out). I have all the weapons/mods that I wanted. You have to spend the gold on something cuz there is a maximum.  So ya, I now have a full set of T-65, fully modded. 
---
So is it worth it?? Yes, because of all the things I can spend gold on, it was the next thing. Honestly though, I still use my Excavator more often because of the carry weight.
---
Todd lets them in to be a jerk.
---
yeah. did a line in the sand tonight and as soon as i went near the piles around the generator i was getting like 2 fps. Done dozens and dozens of lines in the sands in the past few months and had WAY more meatpiles on screen and had no problems. 
---
BUT then i did a radiation rumble and i reckon there were probably more meat piles and had no problems.
---
Yeah, that guy's gonna be a real cork-sucker next week.
---
I've learned that they change an item a few times a week often.
---
Thank you for the tip does it happen regularly? (The death not the event)
---
Great suggestion. I don't mean to be an ass. It's just  some scandalous marketing going on here.
---
What proof is there they are coming anyways? 1 guy that heard the same looping message you do.
---
I'm a camp builder. If they put this in a bundle of increases my motivation 0% to buy that bundle. 
---
Because double sided walls are meh.
---
This community went bonkers over an exploit that 98% of the people complaining use double walls to make their generic, boring, 2 storey house.... No less generic and boring. 
---
There's a few well known camp creators who will likely miss this trick though.
---
yes i agree
---
Lots of deaths in that Event and people occasionally die in the puddle - can anyone confirm that meets the criteria for this achievement? That or try to team up with somebody from here to help out.
---
i was just aboot to go to bed but i'll come on and die in the water for you. 
---
GT: rammadeus. join me at my camp near top of the world. There's water there. Your GT?
---
It feels like it's only certain weapons. Note my railway rifle was automatic. My chainsaw take a forever to break.
---
I thought you couldn't sell or drop them?
---
I remember the bugs that are still here.
---
Johnson mighty was your handmade automatic?
---
I've been blowing up cars since Fallout 3. The first vehicle I blew up was a bus, quite by accident. I placed mines around one, running away from Super Mutants. Two pops, then BOOM! I barely survived, then realized all the cars are atomic, and are potential mini nukes waiting to go off. The Mutants didn't make it :P
---
I've visited 600% budget camps that caused no issues, but infinite yes that is a problem.
---
I mean they do say this i know, but the number of times I've face tanked a SBQ while on tent or fence and seen others be melee'd by queen while on tent or fence makes me not believe it.
---
In earlier reports most people said it was standing on structures, ie) drop site v9.
---
If doing so stops queen from landing then how was it possible that  just this week it landed to aggro me while I was on fence. It landed smack in front of me and then took a swipe, which knocked me back off the fence. If theory being put out is true regarding fences and tents, then how?
---
I've yet to try . If not then WHATS THE POINT
---
Lol, ok buddy.
---
Had this problem for some time with different wall deco. I usually just put them lower and then moving it.
---
You cant drop them..
---
I have a feeling it's automatic weapons then .
---
Which I'm sure you haven't broken any of ever. Let it fucking go dude.
---
This is upsetting . Seriously Bethesda . These a great gifts for noobs
---
Yep, rejected unwanted daily quests, travelled to the bog and bam!  Heart of the Enemy!
---
I actually had to look up the lyrics, and guess what was removed from the google lyrics? This entire section.
---
After I was disconnected from the server it broke on a bunch it seemed to be better. I switched back to the revolver though so I didn't test it too much
---
Don’t kill the messenger.  The joke fell flat after a while. That’s it. 
---
Humor is subjective. Combine that with your premise was flawed to begin with, and the longer you ran the joke, the worse it got.
---
Yah, I know Todd’s plan was 10 years. So it’s definitely not meant to be as big as eso, more like gta in depth. But Cyberpunk and AC both will probably cut into profits, but I think ppl are right in calling this Fallout 4.5. Most ppl are predicting Starfield and ES6 are taking up 2/3 of their devs. That would mean blades, fallout shelter, 76, and the 2 guys still pumping out Skyrim rereleases are all crammed into a 50-100 team. Hopefully once their next single-player game is finished they’ll have more free time for 76 to get more love again.
---
Wooh I’m in MD too. Not at the beach tho, sadly.
---
I think everyone else here speaking from average players perspective. Not FO1st. You ain't taking extra money from me baby!
---
you sir, have a fair point. 
---
I liked the brotherhood in fallout 3. in new vegas the were kinda prickish.
---
in 4 maxson and those f***ers were plain nazis. 
---
maybe they are like elder lyons. yeap, I was hating them even before meeting them. tks for the input. 
---
let’s see what happens next with a blank slate.
---
What's the point of any of it.
---
Relax. Issa joke.
---
They keep showing this really nice blue one in the previews for other items in the atomic shop (it's also in one of the fallout 1st mobile tents) and I'm like, WHERE IS IT?? WHY CAN'T I HAVE THIS? We absolutely need more. ):
---
If it’s explosive its a legacy, otherwise they drop in game
---
Have you listened to their decoded message? A quick precis...
---
In essence they say "we come in peace, we are taking Atlas, by force if necessary, and if you resist our presence we will kill you"
---
Friendly bunch those egotistical, tech obsessed, brainwashed fools.
---
They should have just deleted their characters
---
Whenever i put ammo up for sale i put it at 1 cap. Unless its fusion cores, plasma cores, or mini nukes. For the cores i base it on their charge/100 (a 50% core will be 50 caps) and for mininukes, its 2caps each.
---
Well my plan WAS joy. Now I guess I'll just make a trapped camp or some B.S.
---
I know it’s tough for you to accept the L and move on. But it’s a skill you’ll need to learn.
---
That's the spirit.
---
There extremely good, I got one completely maxed out from a treasure map location, if u learn to use it correctly u can kill level 52 assaultrons in 3 seconds, about 10 for level 80 sentry bots, I’d buy it no matter what if I were u
---
that's just missiles. It was an example. You could have 20000 .38 or 10000 shotgun shells or 5000 fuel. whatever. It's not hard using the converter.
---
I’d help but unfortunately I’m on Xbox:/
---
I mentioned that one. When I compared them to Teagen from Elder Maxons (fallout 4) lot. Since its the only one that directly mentioned Atlas.
---
o wow a new player is coming out
---
i did the overseers quest. after you join the responders and learn the backpack it let me in (xbox)
---
Why not just use something better?
---
Isn't napalmer a mod you put on a flamer - it changes the name but still a flamer.
---
They could have atleast released some instructions for the thing. Point is it's lazily designed. Shouldn't need a smart phone 24/7 to Google IT support the game myself. Sure, you can figure out the new rhythm but really? 
---
 
---
 Signed,
---
  
---
Strange Meat Pie.
---
in workshops you only have the default targeting for each model. in camps you should be able to tell it to search for weapons and ammo with the terminal
---
Top 5 duper plaque, hmm interesting
---
I've donated about 3000, I actually care for the rewards and it makes me sad that Bethesda made the incentive so poor, they should've at least given us scrap or caps in the donor packs
---
Yep, yet you're the one that is still going on. Let it go dude. You're just being sad at this point.
---
Did you read my post? No one here has that much ammo my guy.
---
Nah.
---
a Napalmer is just a flamer with the Napalm Canister mod attached
---
The double sided interior walls should be free and not an additional plan to find.
---
I just dropped stuffon the ground near my CAMP; it was available to an alternate character.
---
takes 10m and no bullets (unarmed), picklock 3 and hacking 3 to skip the reactor with a bloody build, full set of trouble shooter armor helps you go faster, but unyielding with some sneaking is fine too
---
yes limits of bullion , legendary script  ARE JUST PLAiN  ridicules .
---
They  need to raised  4 to 5 xx on daily .   and  accumulating daily , rest weekly
---
and stop giving us worthless 40mm, .38 , missiles,  metal legs, chest pieces
---
this more of punishment than a reward.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Bethesda P.T.S  is becoming a real thing
---
To be honest, I’m kinda numb to it anymore. Every update I know something Bethesda has done is gonna piss me off. Whether they broke something that didn’t need fixed (Ounce of Prevention), focused on fixing a feature that didn’t cause any issues (camp building, and yes I know they said it was used for “some exploit”, but if it’s fixed, then surely they can tell us what catastrophic exploit this caused. It can’t be replicated now so surely they can explain why it was more important than Vats, fast travel, etc.), or they postpone more content again. It’s numbing and it’s stressful
---
I'm just tired of killing a 3 star legendary for a 1 star lead pipe....
---
Its still working.
---
This is finally a thing that killing my enjoyment of the game and driving me away.  This frame rate issue makes me nauseous and makes me leave or not join events. Then, I'm crashing to desktop 1 out of every 20 times I fast travel now. I crashed four or five times in 2 hours tonight.  What did you do?
---
Ok i’ll log back on just a sec gt is SolitaryOmega
---
They need to do it the easy way.  Menu pops up like a shop.  You click the ammo and as you "sell / Feed it into the machine" it tells you how much it will give you in AmmoPoints. "Do you want to confirm conversion?"  Accept or decline.   They have a perfectly good shop system. USE IT!
---
Dunno
---
What’s sad about it?  You insisted it was funny and everyone should think it was funny. But the consensus is different from that. 
---
You seem very invested in defending your ‘joke’, even in the face over overwhelming contrary evidence. 
---
If you’d like to ‘let it go’, then please do so. Be willing to take the first step, if that’s so important to you.
---
I don't know the lore that well but shouldn't they not even exist at this point in the time line?
---
I’m shocked that people struggle with silos....
---
Before donating, i had nearly 60K steel but only 5ishK cork. No idea where 200M came from...
---
I’ll try it
---
thanks.  it seems they just "patched" the gap in the ceiling.
---
You're kidding right? 
---
I traded with a guy once and i was like 'Oh i have loads of ammo if you want to buy some' and when i opened trade he was like 'is that it?' and then i noticed the amount of ammo he was carrying. I thought i had a lot when i had like 7k of this and 14k of that and 12k of this and 9k of that. he was carrying enough ammo to start a revolution. 
---
Bandolier exists and so does ammo weight reducing armour. Even before i got 1st i hoarded ammo despite only using shotguns.
---
Are those the same asshats that try and peddle mini nukes for a 100 caps a head?
---
The Brotherhood are power-worshippers.  They want to secure any and all sources of technological power, for "the good of humanity," and with some vague ideal of using it to rebuild civilization someday, but they never seem to have a plan for the rebuilding - if they succeed in acquiring some marvel of technology, they are just gonna use it to acquire the next one.  They're principled, I'll give them that, but they are locked into a Don Quixote-esque eternal chivalric struggle.  Militaries aren't bad, but a military on its own, without a greater non-militaristic civilization to serve, is a recipe for endless war.  Every civilization needs its military, but when the civilization IS the military and the military IS the civilization, watch out.  When all you have is a hammer...
---
Honestly lol Even when i was a lower level 100-150 i ran them just fine without the door glitch.
---
I had a server in the early days of the purveyor which dropped 18 out of 20 guns with explosive on it
---
Or hacking the terminals
---
Exactly
---
Then find a noob, open it up, and drop the stuff on the ground for them. They made them no drop so there’s no chance to dupe them.
---
Okay next problem is that energy weapons kinda suck compared to every other weapon. The best you can get would probably be a plasma rifle modded to be a flamer, would still benefit from rifleman perks but be limited to close range. Laser weapons just have really low damage due to enemy resistances.
---
Or, we could just give them away?
---
Caps aren't terribly useful anyway.
---
True, I got a really good Bloodied Fire Axe off someone at their vendor for 400 caps. If you're not playing that build, that stuff is just dead weight.
---
so long as it's a magic shotgun (stalkers, instigating, junkies, 25 vats hit, bashing damage, +50 limb dmg or any 15% blocking effect on armor)
---
Everytime I did a run through in FO4 I ended up wiping out that base they had. At the old police station (?). Just seemed the thing to do.
---
 Though I am chasing the BOS PA paints in 76.
---
i may need a couple of attempts to kill myself properly.
---
Chance of scrip. Pre-bos rep vouchers. Gold bullion. Chance of legendaries. Chance of actual rare plans. Bos specific camp items/skins.
---
Literally any one of those would make the event semi-worth doing.
---
I've heard you can't see your camp if you use the new skin for the camp projector thing(honestly can't remember what the damn things called) that you place, are you by chance using the new skin from legendary run?
---
You are right! There, they have one already "made" lol. And i think the Christmas tent has one in different color too. Would be nice to be able to have them
---
Had this issue with Radiation Rumble last night, and tonight it was One Violent Night.
---
It's the only heavy weapon you can do a stealth build with as far as I know
---
Okay question. Could this be a dude vs. girl perception thing?
---
I’m female and I’ve always known it was hold haha. This could also be because I am the daughter of a wrestler, and I do martial arts, but come on.
---
Meanwhile one day my boyfriend just goes “He tried a brand new HOLE she did not appreciate” and I was like ??? that is not the song lol. I’m assuming this song is old and I’d find it doubtful that they would say something like that haha.
---
maxon formed the brotherhood of steel in 2077
---
It does, I got mine that way accidentally and spent 10 minutes confused
---
I get why they need the RNG, but I agree. There needs to be better odds. I’m pretty sure every item has the exact same chance which would mean a 1/3 chance of getting a 3* on top of the 1/160chance at getting the item you were wanting. I shouldn’t have to kill 500 3*’s in hope for 1 item... and all that math doesn’t include the dozens of weapons and armor I could get. I’d guess the odds of getting the exact item you were looking for is close to a 1/10,000 chance.
---
To much work. Half the fun is opening the present. Gunna trap my base, make it near vault 76 and kill noobs. BETTER YET I'll make it near the scrap stache they give players right away. Free loot. I get a ban. Meh. Tried to be nice but nooooo.
---
Unfortunately that's not a planet but the doomsday clock, atom shop item.
---
I imagine Bethseda will be the top contributor.
---
I have zero defenses my camp is in cranberry bog
---
I'm in the minority of finding it far more usable.
---
But I also keep a small notebook for tracking things in various games and write down how much ammo I have when I start converting.
---
That happen to me once in my camp when the PA station was to close to the wall and my player couldn't get into it. I moved it slightly and it worked fine ...
---
Gotta chug those stims
---
Sure am lmao, how is that even a bug I don't get this game sometimes.
---
Doesn't it get attacked though?
---
So far as I know,&amp; mind jah,
---
I ain’t no super high lvl guru dude,
---
but from my personal experience...the less turrets the better,unless you can pinpoint one or possibly 2 at spawn points you’ve gotten well versed to,from fast travelin to yer camp a few times.
---
Do you have the 2k points maxxed out and need to spend them?
---
If you're trying to add more points than you have space for it won't work
---
Supposedly they're looking into it - it just happened with the patch.
---
The only "Good" BOS was the group in Fallout 3. All the other Chapters were either isolationists at best or Raiders in Power Armor at worst.
---
The best way I can explain it without spoiling the quest. Terminals/holotapes/notes explain it. Located around the mire/cranberry bog. The BOS (the fort defiance lot. So the corpses near the SBQ) were founded when maxson contacted them after the war. Maxson being the founder as explained in fallout 1. But the Appalachian chain was killed by the SBQ. 
---
If you want the full lore. Oxhorn did a lovely video on them. Or it you want the authentic way you can explore the area and find the entries yourself.
---
If you're not getting attacked a bunch, I would definitely thin that out for budget sake. However, it's entirely up to how you want your camp to look. If you have the budget to spare, and like the way it looks, then roll with it for as long as you want.
---
I thought this too. What she’s actually saying is “He tried a brand new HOLD“ like a wrestling hold, what with him being a wrestler and everything.
---
Think I saw something about this. Wasnt it native americans fighting one with spears, according to one tale?
---
They’ve got a bunch of popular Camp stuff to screw up first. There are only so many hours in the day.
---
I pretty much built my camp the way I want and it's done and now I'm adding defenses.  It's just annoying because I've been attacked before and had generators destroyed.
---
I have always felt really bad about killing and eating (! glowing meat) the mole miners. They're sad.
---
Ya but who cares if they take Atlas? Nobody was using it, all these factions and no one thought it was worth taking from the robots. I do think their motives for coming may still turn out to be morally gray or even down right nefarious but as of what we the vault dweller know about them so far, we have no reason to hate them or their presence in Appalachia.
---
That is a fair argument. And a flaw I did always see in the Brotherhood myself. I was merely confused why this lot seemed to be catching so much flak as compared to others. At least atm.
---
There are a lot of theories and I do believe most of them factor in to a degree., but are not 100%
---
The fence / V9 / tent standing and staggering her in the air probably works like camp building. Ground not accessible , fly around another five minutes.
---
for me it's the opposite (on PC).
---
I had a lot of stutters and micro lags few monthes ago, now they are completely gone.
---
Im not having any issues with mutations at all, but my weight been fluctuating as well
---
Honestly I'd like a game where I didn't have to worry about the brotherhood for once
---
I dont even buy ammo if it costs 1 cap, it is much easier and cheaper to get the items to make your own.
---
They grinded the event too?
---
I would argue the chapter in fallout 1 was alright. But that's only because they were direct defendants of The original founders. But I get your point. Fallout 4 is by far the worst of them though. And they're decadent from Fallout 3.
---
One laser turret and the ally
---
"Prepared for the future!" 
---
(Of ceiling fall fatalities and cave-ins)
---
And 800x more bugs too! :)
---
I've actually bought a lot of games from places other than steam and gotten a steam code out of it.
---
It did not even occur to me that there might be a Microsoft Store version of Fallout 76, let alone one that was somehow separate from the others.
---
Other than that, it's not unreasonable to expect buying something that exists solely on the servers of an online-only game to work regardless of where you bought it.
---
I haven't had any experience like this with other games, including World of Warships or Armored Warfare, both of which I started out with by using the companies' (my.com and wargaming.net) stand-alone version, and then switching over to installing &amp; playing them via Steam.
---
Aside from that, if the Microsoft Store has its own version of FO 76, and the FO 1st it sells is compatible with that version and only that version, I would expect a warning when making the purchase, especially since the Microsoft Store would know for sure that you were buying something you absolutely cannot use because you don't have the Microsoft Store version tied to your account. Heck, Steam will flat out **refuse** to let you buy DLC that requires the Steam version of the game and you don't already own that.
---
I am paranoid enough that I would been sure to purchase FO 1st on the same platform I purchased FO 76, *if* I knew there was a separate Microsoft Store one. But I didn't know that, so it never even occurred to me.
---
Unpopular opinion in this subreddit, but I played this game because of PVP.  When they removed slap damage and PVP in the normal game I never played Adventure mode again.  Nuclear Winter was great, but their inability to prevent hackers from ruining the experience drove me away.  To some people, multiplayer Fallout means being able to kill each other, not some co-op, dress up, role-play.
---
First time player here. Just got to this point. Put the sample in, then put the fuse in, went to the terminal and hit analyze. It says no sample present. 
---
So I changed worlds, went straight to the terminal without putting the fuse in (couldn't put sample in, no option) tried to analyze again and nothing. Put fuse in and tried again, still nothing.
---
Changed worlds again, put fuse in, then tried analyzing. Nothing.
---
GG.
---
I feel you on the paint grind. I'm up to Knight Captain Myself. 
---
And that's fair. I assume you also blew up the prydwen at the airport as well.
---
Are you in a group, cause your weight difference looks like herd mentality and strange in numbers are missing.
---
How does having two accounts differ from using two characters on the same account? Wouldn’t you need two XBoxes (in my case) to have both characters on screen at the same time?
---
Please, explain like I’m an idiot. I will not be offended.
---
&gt;I assume you dont play anymore
---
Well, you're wrong.
---
And I wasn't talking about the game as a whole when I made that comment.  I'm talking about people feeling obligated to finish dailies or chase S.C.O.R.E if they're not enjoying it.
---
I mean it is a song from the 50's so it obviously would be "hold", in the 50's married couples wouldn't sleep in the same bed on tv as seen in I love Lucy and she wasn't allowed to say she was pregnant only "with child"
---
Hmm i saw someone said it was just a visual thing but im not to sure right now with whats goin on
---
I cussed her out but she deserved it
---
Hide your generators behind walls (brick or metal depending on what you have). It'll be more difficult for wiring since the update though.
---
I'm salty af about the patch havnt played sense I legit play this game to build shit and they ruined it its heartbreaking for us builders cus we love over budget
---
 camps i get there was duping involved just like every other aspect of this game (vendors, godmode, server crashing, etc) i wish I hadn't moved 5 hours before update my house will never be what I had in mind and Bethesda will never go back on this patch im not saying I won't play it again but untell im motivated to build something that looks like utter trash now i will log on do bare minimum and sign off i have no home and they don't give a shiz just that 70 percent of there players are dupers and that they need to stop it for literally no reason but God forbid they fix any other broken aspect walk threw doors shifty load in times on nw theres no balance in the game Metta is bloodied handmade and when they try fixing it they over nerf the meta to garbage  i am getting my stupid fireplace door and building some crapshow ass build with no interior walls cus we can't be trusted and they don't know how to fix there game
---
Rules (general) are;
---
Unlocked = Fair game.
---
Locked = Mittens off it's not yours. 
---
This applies to everything. Community correct me if I'm mislead.
---
Also-
---
-Don't touch people's pets.
---
-If a sign says 'Keep Out', they probably mean it.
---
It's probably a bullshit excuse but if I had to guess they'd say it's too much for the Xbox to run on its own - even if it's just you all by yourself. EA said the same shit about Sim City but surprise surprise people were able to get it running locally w/o an internet connection.
---
Tell me about it, my quad is still OK but not Hollywood OK like it was.
---
I always have them in the center of my base.  I recently moved locations and haven't been attacked yet, but before enemies just destroyed my walls and attacked my generators.
---
Take a bleed out syringer and shoot her eye with bleed out rounds so it dries the fuck out of it
---
I have personal anecdotal evidence to support this. Friends and I have looted corpses to get legendaries with the same primary prefix, and bulk-purchases from the purveyor often have a surprisingly tight spread of prefixes too.
---
That makes sense, I guess
---
Maybe one day they'll give them to us. Honestly they need to implement the creation club or something and let those creators out there give us the stuff we want/deserve lol.
---
Clear the reserved space file under your fallout 76 save data ...you will lose you pics but this will fix it
---
Edit: this is not cleared by reinstalling
---
naw it doesn't matter what wall you put it on, even if you take the wallpaper off and put it on a bare wall or on the outside of a wall it still clips like that.
---
You are welcome
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events
---
I also don't mind retcons.  The whole point if these fictional environments is for people to enjoy it. If the writing is good and the lore is untouched, unanswered, etc. I think often times content with that potential should be retconned.
---
That would explain why I don't see then that often
---
Ok I had this bug for the longest time. Happy I am not the only one. I was just recording the bug in OBS to report it with. When I triggered the dialogue, it worked. I know it sounds crazy.
---
I %100 agree
---
I've done that. I even deleted the entire game and reinstalled it. No luck.
---
I love all the backseat developers on here.
---
I'm talking about the vendor bot at Watoga Station, not a player vendor. Always check them for stuff players sell.
---
They are only for fo1st
---
Scrip in the rewards would be enough. 5-10 would make me happy enough to contribute
---
The sad reality
---
I really wish it would work like goto the side with the bucket where you would put the ammo in to scrap and have it open your inventory select the ammo and amount to scrap add points or what ever done. Open terminal and create the ammo. End of the day I don’t care how much of what gives me different amount of points. If it makes ammo that’s cool, but just make it simple. I don’t want to spend a lot of time making ammo with this machine.
---
mutations did have a visual bug if thats what they said to you, as far as weight it will fluctuate and I will go from fine to overencumbured and not pick up any items.
---
I said or if it was.
---
Its capped at 100k now chief.
---
Yeah crafting food also lags like crazy and takes forever to boil water, and make certain items.
---
I truly wish there was a dedicated server for the pre-wastelander game. I miss it a lot. Too much uninteresting raider and settler bullshit going on now. I thought Wastlanders would make the game better, and on a certain content level, it did, but in many other aspects the game was cleaner and purer before. I didnt realize how much I'd miss it until it was gone.
---
Yeah, some areas (even in the same region) have a harder time with enemy spawns. Moving your camp a little bit in any direction can also make a difference. I'd just feel it out and remove a turret once in a while and see how it holds up. That's if you don't feel like moving.
---
I haven’t donated anything to BOS. Don’t think I will either. I have lots of stimpacks
---
Reitterating what another guy said. You dont have room, move the pa station and it will work.
---
I have none and I’m on my third character and lived in every region. I have found them being almost useless maybe able to kill one enemy before they get blown up and they are just annoying when they bug out and shoot everything.
---
The only way  \~\~Bethesda\~\~ Vault-Tec could nerf our power as a faction is by splitting us up. The moment we set for invading other areas of the US, the 76ers power dwindles. So I say they could open Boston for us. C'mon, you have the map. Let 76 conquest the Commonwealth too.
---
I like to use flamingos when a tree or bush is too close and clips into my base. Not too noticeable and when you do notice it, it just looks like I have plastic flamingoes set up
---
Man I thought I was going crazy when people kept saying it was 400 at launch!
---
I don't use any turrets in my camp next to the asylum, I use fences or concrete/junk walls to give me a heads up that something is attacking (either hear the wall being attacked, or if I'm playing with the sound off see the camera shake of it being destroyed), then just go kill whatever it is. You just have to pay attention to the direction you are being attacked from most often, and put something in that direction to attract their attention and/or keep them from getting at your expensive-to-repair stuff. Turrets are feasible, if you have plenty of spare budget, I would say 3 would be the maximum needed though (of course, different build spots may need more, if you attract scorchbeasts or something... even then, they're pretty much only to keep the scorchbeast focused on them instead of your house, while you kill it)
---
Ahhh, that makes sense. Thanks!
---
Just want to chime in that this was me all night tonight. Seems like I crashed most often when I was fast travelling.  You're not alone. They've done something. I usually play for 2-3 hours a night and I can barely do 1 now.
---
The games less than 2 years old and you’re feeling nostalgic? Why?
---
IIRC, I bought a bunch of High Radiation Fluids from a vendorbot one time, like about 20 or so.  That was pretty sweet.
---
We need to take bets on what will be broken in that update.  I’m guessing guns will shoot backwards.
---
This happened to me too last month, the private server gave me an error on trying to enter it, even though two of my friends were still in it!
---
Some piece of shit did this to me also So I just moved my camp and that did the job Good luck
---
Agree.  It was fun at first, but now it's slowly turned into a part time job where you log-in to earn SCORE.
---
I decided to take a "vacation" from this "job" by vacuuming today instead.  It was honestly more fun.
---
&gt; It has been posted quite often, but more helps more, I think =) 
---
Bringing up a topic you know gets posted often is just more likely to get it sent to Rule 10.
---
Daily caps exist for the same reason we have daily challenges, the name of the game is player retention and when people are encouraged to log in as often as possible they're less likely to wander off and play something else.
---
I was referring to the roving vendors that show up, as well as those vendors. I had one of those wandering vendors at my camp the other day and they had a bunch of trash legendaries in their inventory. I figured someone exhausted their legendary scrip for the day and had enough of their stash limits.
---
It should consume 1 fuel per second in flight or something. Normal armor already has enough bonuses to make it far better than power armor, at least make their jet packs use up something
---
HAPPENING ON PC TOO:    Guys I think there is something wrong with the anti aliasing rendering other players meat piles that you cant see plus the bodies because I had this same problem at Project Paradise Event were there were no meat piles but the same pixelated bug effect happening were dead creatures bodies fade/dissapear so the meat pile can appear(but there are no more meat piles I looted mine)
---
I feel like its rendering EVERYONES meatpiles/bodies regardless if looted.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/5mMv7Yr.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5mMv7Yr.jpg)
---
P.S. I feel like i walked into Chernobyl ground zero and everything is fading into pixels
---
P.S. SERIOUS GAME PERFORMANCE LOSS MAKES IT HARD TO LOOT AND GET HITS ON LEGENDARY'S ALSO BIGGER RISK OF DEATH AFTER EVENT.
---
I'm at level 84, only play 3-4 a day to get materials (acid,lead) and do the daily's and a few other daily's the quick one's, you just need to boost your int as high as you can during bigger fights and handing in quests. I'm at a point where I want to slow down to avoid hitting that wall before end.
---
Same.  Once i get to the last Legendary Run rank, I'm taking a long break from this game.  If I get hooked on something else... honestly may not come back.
---
Happened with me and Destiny 2.
---
If I were you I’d go for mini guns and Gatling lasers, rifles generally aren’t that good without sneaking and laser rifles are really bad
---
Nearly clutched a win today by running into the storm and stealth boy to get the last guys. Down 2:3... 
---
Sadly it wasn’t meant to be.
---
You must need the stimpacks.🤪🤪. Just kidding. I’m glad you are having fun!
---
Same thing happened to me. I had to cycle the power on my PS4 by fully turning it off and unplugging it for 10 seconds (this was Bethesda’s recommendation). Quest went through after that.
---
To be honest I only use power armor for nuke zones
---
I hate MMO culture. Get it the fuck out of here. I played Fallout 76 and Elder Scrolls Online both for their story and when that runs out, I stop playing. Simple as that man. 
---
Lots of unique content &gt; doing the same boring shit over and over
---
They've never interested me but Bethesda just has to make them a big part of every game
---
I'd hope this long since last increase, drop in player count and FO1st subs that another increase would come. I won't hold my breath. Let's just face it, this is not the fallout we want.
---
Ooh yeah those traveling ones are awesome sometimes too.
---
My man
---
I use it because I’m a heavy gunner and stabilized is really good, and it makes me feel badass/look cool but other than the reasons I listed and like you said nuke zones, there’s almost no reason to use it
---
Ive only donated once... your welcome everybody.
---
The Brotherhood has a perceived sense of entitlement and a made-up power level that they just decided they have.  At best they're meddlesome jerks who think they can tell me what to do or not to do with tech based on nothing but their own beliefs and interpretation of history. At worst they're intolerant tyrants killing anything that isn't them. 
---
Either way, they're essentially zealots impressing their way on you, and with force.
---
He's never there, gotta use it for something!
---
Since everybody who's already quit won't be reading this, your sample is skewed :)
---
I got similar specs to you, and I noticed that as well.  Meat piles cause some serious frame drops I didn't have before.
---
Like down to 20's or below sometimes.
---
Ah yes because Bethesda never makes mistakes and is all powerful. Lick that boot harder
---
i still dont get why we have to tell people that this brotherhood is not the same as the F4 one.
---
I have an X-01 set with nuka cola quantum on all the pieces with a purple headlamp and it looks badass, my friend is currently getting a set of all the power armor in the game so I’ll tell u if I find a good paint set
---
That is fair. I'm not claiming they're saints. Was more so confused why the lot coming to Appalachia seem to already have so much hate.
---
I sell all kinds of interesting stuff to the wandering vendors for just this reason.
---
I'm 23
---
*shhhh*
---
I see the merit in that approach, but the issue with it is that people usually won't spend money on a game so buggy and laggy that they actually can't play it.
---
Content's irrelevant when it can't even be accessed.
---
Probably PC, much easier to have both logged in at the same time.
---
No 461 is when herd and strange are activated
---
There seems to be a bug that shows "Steal from" containers even though they aren't owned by anybody or that there won't be any penalty for taking the stuff. Yesterday, I went to loot the Fertilizer containers at the Agricultural Research Center and it said "Steal from" even though they're literally impossible to be owned. I took the fertilizer anyway just to see what happened and there was no penalty.
---
Can easily with bloodied unarmed or Bloodied commando!
---
Yeah that’s one reason why I use it, I’m currently a stealth build but I’m gonna switch over to a automatic pistol build because u can get really OP with that build
---
Yeah they sucked in FO4 too this build is really only a memey RP build anyways
---
They absolutely need to nerfed the fuck out of these affixes.  I really hope that One Wasteland destroys the usefulness of all legacy and glitched weapons and returns us back to some normalcy.
---
You grinded months or years for a meta that could change at any moment.  Just like any other game.
---
Honestly? I’m somewhat glad they didn’t send a forward scout. Then we would just have people complaining about how the event works, but how similar it was to fallout 4, since that’s almost what Danae’s team did.
---
Better developers.
---
I use my other 4 character slots and I have an alt account as well.
---
I didn't say they were? 
---
I said the ones coming are Elder Maxson's bunch. As in fallout 1 Maxson. 
---
I just compared they're message to Teagen from Elder Maxson's bunch in fallout 4.
---
I guess if we're strictly role-playing, none of us would have any idea what the Brotherhood would become - but after the enclave and raiders (and settlers)we might be really wary of any new group pushing their way in.
---
It isn't that complex, if someone on ebay has 5 B2525 fixers for sale, they are probably duped....  If they have just one, it is conceivable that it could be legit.
---
That's fair. I feel they're included for a similar reason as the mutants. "Fallout 1 did it"
---
Thank you very much for the quick update.  That makes me happy &lt;3
---
I'm not going to quit... but I am one step closer to it, and this is a trend that seems to keep repeating. I've been here since beta, and through all the messiness I've still played almost every day, but the grind is no longer appealing and feels more like a chore than a fun experience, and the content has all been done. I've defended this game against the criticism, but I just can't anymore. Sure, Wastelanders brought new life into the game, but it took too long, and every bit of new content is constantly delayed, broken, or both. Then "new" content ends up being recycled garbage (we all have all the holiday gift plans thanks). Finally, one of the only things left to do is camp building, and they just took away one of the most useful tools (even without using it to glitch stuff). 
---
I guess what I'm saying is that every time this happens, my hope of "it'll get better" dies a bit more, my enjoyment of the game dies a bit more, and my faith in the game lasting for years dies a bit more. At this point, I'm logging in daily to get my Score, then leaving. Essentially taking a break from the game, while still not missing out on some camp things just in case (not holding my breath) that the revamp in the fall (sure) will actually be good and get me excited to play again.
---
I fear the worst though. They clearly don't have enough devs for this, their communication sucks, and they don't seem interested in making it fun instead of trying to squeeze out more cash and alienate their most loyal players. If this hasn't changed drastically by the time my FO1st expires, I won't renew it.
---
I have a table at my camp by vault 76 that says free stuff above it in neon letters. I always put plans food drink decent weapons and armor on it for low levels. Sometike a legendary or two to keep my weight down.
---
Free stuff table are great highly recommended
---
10/10
---
Thank you for linking crap FPS with the fly piles, it's so obvious this aesthetic tanks the frame rate but idk how they could address this bar changing the fly pile to something less noticable, or graphically intensive as hundreds of particle effects simultaneously being shown in different locations across different players.
---
I usually run around just picking up everything bc my game will crash during Scorched Earth if I leave it unattended, and I may have to hop worlds during LitS bc of the ridiculous BZZZZZ
---
That is true. And from a RP perspective the only knowledge we have is from Taggerdy's. So being skeptical makes sense. 
---
Going outside of RP though. Knowing what all the factions do become. I don't see why people would prefer the Enclave to come in. Which is what alot of people wanted instead.
---
yeah i know. Im talking about the people that hate the brotherhood cuz they were „BAD” in fallout4. Seen a couple of post about how we shouldnt donate to and support brotherhood cuz of these reasons
---
Remove the legendary run camp skin pay to move camp and your camp will show in map again
---
God Bless America, Bless The Enclave!
---
Nice shot!
---
Are you guys using a SSD and/or a Pro? I'm on a vanilla PS4 and have a SSD and have had no problems since update.
---
Add me to the list of this not working.
---
Edit: I noticed on my new character it only lets me collect a feral ghoul sample,  my main character when I did the quest I had to gather a sample from a mole rat and a wolf too but am not able to on this new character quest and doesn’t show in the quest objectives either.
---
I tried the suggestion in the comments below but that didn’t work for me.
---
COMMIES!!! (/Mr. Gutsy voice)
---
Oh. I'm right there with you on that one. Why would anyone choose Enclave? I used to think maybe I didn't value them because I'm not American...?
---
All truth OP, but the bigger question is how long will everyone continue to tolerate this?  Your post applies to almost every change Bethesda's made to the game, yet—insanely—we stick around hoping for a different result.  I just don't understand how a video game company can be utterly shit at designing/managing a video game.
---
They're trying to prevent them from being duped.
---
Sounds like you need to do the very thing you attempted to avoid.
---
Go delete the game and redownload it.
---
For context I'm speaking as a PS4 Pro player with a 4 year old Samsung SSD installed and the game works just fine it's not the fault of the system or your hard drive.
---
Leave the brambles alone... Oh...
---
Awesome! That was when SNL was truly funny... 😁
---
That sucks man.  I transfer total builds too.  Can’t imagine.
---
You do know that atoms dont effect the way you play the game right?... you dont need literally "anything" in the atom shop. Sure they should fix it anyways and there arnt anymore "free daily atoms".. but those have never effected the gameplay at all....Beggers cant be choosers. If you have to game on a "budget", maybe you shouldnt invest what little money you have into a hobby.
---
It's like these morons don't play their own game.
---
Me too, I’m doing my part!
---
It’s honestly not you, it’s me. I need some time to work on myself
---
yes, yes you are.
---
i've put 5k steel in already.
---
(edit for the word "put")
---
After playing the DMV quest... I'm not sure I'd want to go through something similar again...
---
Yes, but it wasn't pretty. I died a lot. Almost used every single piece of ammo I owned. Somehow finished it.
---
Holy hell, just had this hit me in radiation rumble. Had multiple people running ores, myself included, and then it looked like every person there got massive lag. All four scavengers were just slaughtered in under a minute as all but one person seemed to be having the same issue as me... and the lucky guy with no issue was uselessly weak.
---
shut up
---
Lol. So true.  Literally nothing new
---
So many innocents lost...
---
i would argue the same, for me te BoS from fallout 1 was the always the best one.
---
My opinion is if it's unlocked, it's mine, if it's locked, it's still mine, but with extra steps.
---
I'm noticing a lot of stuff as I'm playing today, it seems like the end game isnt much more then yall standing around waiting for stuff to sell, or giving noobs like me 5k caps for a trash piece of armor .. I thought dude was joking when he said I'll give ya 5k...he did. Was well needed I was down to 63 after spending all my caps on 200 cap serums to flip to vendors for days cuz I'm a broke noob. was a broke noob. lol. Today I've basically figured out the best ways to get lead. Made it to 20 pushing hard to 25 to do the excavator PA quest and then really never need ammo again.
---
no, bloodied blows up level 60 mobs wtf do you mean
---
They need to add a salt emote for all the BOS haters :)
---
there are four lights
---
I know the feeling. It's like the post about modus not stopping the BOS the 2 factions don't war for years.
---
If YOU created the private server and your friend joined you and you log to main menu you will have to select play and then private server (like you are making a new one) and you will rejoin your friend.
---
Well hopefully the ones coming will maybe be alright. Since they are from that lot.
---
It wasn't used to make infinite camps, that's just an excuse Bethesda made up, those glitches don't work that way!
---
Yeah my friends say the same thing, cant count how many times one of my rants has had em in tears, it's only when I'm not trying to be funny though. Sucks, wouldnt have minded having someone else to play with even if I am making a more solo centered build.
---
Nice try, Bethesda guy
---
Their customer service is so trash there's no point contacting them for ANY reason.
---
I'm 20 currently.
---
you're looking at the actual ammo count on the sell option at the right side and not the multiplier on the left, correct?
---
They really need to implement a small account wide storage feature. 100 sounds about right to me. Large enough to transfer a few weapons and small enough to not make a huge difference.
---
Bloodies +40% swingspeed sledgehammer named 16 tons. Its a blast in any situation other than a scorchbeast &amp; turrets higher up than eye level. Character is a juggernaught tho, i once took out a level 250 guy at level 30 by bumrushing his ass while he desperatly tried to aim.
---
Edit: forgot my character is a build i use alot in fallout games called a "chem beserker" essentially i use psycho/buffout to improve my combat skills.
---
People dont realise that, they probably think enclave isnt „that bad” too.
---
Im very happy with the name I have given my character. 😁 I named her ' rubmycrit'  it made me giggle. But sadly it doesn't show up in the game. 🤷
---
Oof. You make a good point.
---
I made a post that Bethesda has no incentive to add this when it's a de facto "feature" of FO1, but apologists downvote unpopular facts.
---
What you say is also true. Same too with running their reputation into the ground but two things are clear:
---
1. Bethesda only cares about short term revenue. They couldn't give a fuck about customer satisfaction, customer retention, pride in releasing a quality product or long term reputation.
---
2. People will keep throwing money at Bethesda no matter how poorly they perform and how little they deliver on promised features.
---
&gt;Content's irrelevant when it can't even be accessed.
---
That's just not the case with this game. So long as SOME content is accessible, that's all that matters. Doesn't have to be ALL content that is accessible.
---
Not justifying Bethesda's actions. Just saying that Bethesda has a very different outlook on this than you or I. If money keeps coming in, who cares. When it doesn't, that's when they look at the issue.
---
Thanks! I did one hack of a job 😈
---
Wouldn't it be cheaper to have just bought another copy of the game to use as a mule character?
---
Ok good to know
---
Why can’t I fucking upvote this a million times??
---
Going to “easy” events like Tea Time and Feed the People and failing because I was only a level 5 or so and no one else was there 😢
---
Okay, what you want to do is to unmark the quest and leave the server. Do something for a couple mins and go back in. When you get back don't mark the quest and you'll see that you have the T Fuse. Do not plug it in. Go straight to the terminal and analyze. I've done this and now I'm going further into the quest. I hope this helps.
---
Darude sandstorm
---
Ha thats right.. down vote f#cking crybabies.. whaa bethesdas not giving us free stuff anymore! excuse me while I buy multiples of the 4000 atom bundle so I can stunt on the 900+ level loser who spends all his time in the wasteland and should probably spend that same amount of time and effort into getting a job. If you cant afford the 15 dollars to spend every month on fallout 1st or any bundle of atoms but spend multiple hours a day playing a MMO you really need to rethink your life choices.
---
I got a homemade vampiric rifle i think.
---
Did it twice the first day. Quickly realised I should just make ammo instead. Sorry guys I usually contribute to this stuff but I seriously can't be arsed with this one.
---
This thread is much darker if you forget what sub you are in
---
If you actually use power armor is pretty much the best one currently. The strangler is very close to it though. If you don't really use power armor then it's useless.
---
This. Acrobats prefix for the op
---
"I was hopin' for a pension, but all I got is tension"!
---
Oh yeah I've seen plenty of post about wanting the Enclave back. Which rp wise makes some sense. Non rp though
---
I'll have to try that. Every time I try, I put the fuse in first because that's what it tells me to do lol. I'll give this a shot. Thanks in advance!
---
I was wondering if they would hold a Colossal Problem back just so they can officially debut the non pts on their Dev live stream.
---
Microtransactions don't exist anymore, it's all about the macrotransactions! Microtransactions just wasn't enough for them!
---
Quite a bit. Most people will not accept caps for it. they will only take trades, and even then, its very hard to work up a trade for one
---
Why would anyone want to crash the server?
---
This
---
Damn, I was hoping for one cause it seems like the only thing better for a commando build than a handmade.
---
Spent about 10k steel. Got plans I didnt know but a bunch of other junk I didnt need. Found a low level camp and dumped a rather large cache of supplies (stims, radaway, alchohol, plans I knew) right behind the owner and vanished. 
---
Gotta say I'm a little sad at the rewards but it's made it easy to help out some of the newer players thanks to XBox Game Pass.
---
Well the general public demanded that Bethesda had more polished games, so isn't that good news? Getting rid of the "Bethesda Charm" won't suddenly make their games souless or less replayable, there's still a massive modding community out there and having a stricter approach to bugs would only improve the company's reputation in the eyes of the gaming public.
---
Wait, are laser rifles even affected by commando? I’ve always assumed yes but that doesn’t seem right thinking about it
---
In my opinion, turrets take up too much budget and don't really do much. I've lived EVERYWHERE (I love relocating and building camps on both my characters) and while I do get attacked from time to time, they never break anything I can't repair in two seconds. If you're worried about generators, hide them. My ally will fight some stuff and others players pop in and out of my camp(s) all the time because of vendors, so they'll typically kill things too.   
---
Right now I have one camp in cranberry bog and the other by atlas. Both get attacked regularly but it's usually only when I first log on, and it's, at most, a mirelurk king or a protectron at one, and like three super mutants or a mole rat at the other. Not enough trouble to sacrifice budget for a turret though. I need my decorations lol
---
Fr If I have 201 notes to exchange I should have the ability to exchange all of it, dont leave me with 1 single note thats like the worst kind of annoying.
---
Well, what have you got that your willing to trade? Some people might accept a deal. Doesnt hurt to try.
---
Been playing since the beginning. Just got the camo jumpsuit from Flyswatter.
---
Oh wow, didn't know that. That's actually pretty cool
---
Classical Gas
---
this. such a huge oversight.
---
We use ally's for that now.
---
Thanks!
---
Not much being honest, I played at launch but stopped playing before whitesprings became no longer a hotspot for nukes, so, I’ve passed a ton of old prolly legacy stuff up. Now my best gun is prolly a two shot explosive lever action, or the handmade on my alt
---
I know the game is a bit Buggy.
---
It dosent explain why none of the safe mode features on the Console would work though ?
---
After speaking to someone with a bit more knowledge than me.
---
He said the Hard Drive was highly likely to be the culprit.If the PS4 Pro Console it self was stuck in a mode of being unable to Boot up organically.
---
I put the error codes on line.And others took the same course of action to rectify.Either way i will need a new Hard Drive anyway.It wont be wasted.I am hoping this fixes the problem.The base model PS4 in the Kids room is still going strong if only it sounds like a Jet liner. these days :-)
---
I will update though just to help others if it happens to them.
---
It was A Reddit post where i got my first feedback searching on Google lol.
---
Is that your voice? Its pretty good
---
i preferred it before since it told you when you ran out of ammo but it still isnt too bad, just have to press the back button after selling some to do it quickly
---
This would make legendaries not as special anymore, nor exciting when you roll and god roll.
---
Sabaton - attero dominatus
---
I sell pretty most regular ammo for 1 cap each.
---
I expect, I just lose interest if ammo is more than 1 cap and leave the camp, it's not that hard to craft our own anyway, I buy for convenience if it's 1 cap per otherwise, lucky hole mine, wes tek and get xp for crafting.
---
except you can go on bethesda‘s website where they have an atom shop calendar, essentially. perception 2
---
The power armor one took me all day to find a spawn that wasn't looted! I wasn't wasting resources to craft and scrap, power armor is expensive!
---
The enclave is dead butters
---
Yea that aint gonna be enough. Good luck on your journey to find one though!
---
Got one today, weapon cache, should have guessed though, gave Nocturnal prefix...
---
It's not like it looks amazing on high end PCs, I don't see it somehow getting updated to look amazing on next-gen consoles.
---
They'll port it, and it will run worse than you'd expect.
---
I guess in time we will find out, pretty annoying.
---
I've literally seen her land on a tent.
---
I prefer Anti Armor anything over Two Show, but thats just me
---
I did, pick up everything and sell.
---
Literally got a nocturnal 25ffr bashing fixer from her the last time I almost cried, but I haven’t been able to get her daily in yesterday or today. Do you know how to fix it maybe?
---
I honestly don't understand how average players are completing it.  I get on and do most of the challenges everyday and im like 10-15 spaces behind the enemy ship.
---
It's asking for way too much commitment from me.
---
Hold B
---
If they were to really make it worthwhile for everyone they'd add an option to donate 2.5k or even 10k or something that only high level players could achieve and the rewards would for significantly better
---
They owe me 4 dailies and 2 weeklies of missing score! They owe the community that extra score, they shouldn't be charging us for it!
---
A lot of newer players won't even know how to do the event. As someone who's only been playing for a couple of weeks, I don't have a fast travel point anywhere near the ATLAS location, and I'm not going to make a long trek out to somewhere that will probably just keep getting me killed.
---
Same here. If it doesn’t move after a few days, then I convert it or drop it at Vault 76.
---
It does when you activate a pylon in encrypted
---
Well, honestly, having small functional camps makes it a lot easier to move.  Which is great if you want that "76 camp moves" atom challenge.
---
I've given up on that challenge with my main because my "train stop shop" camp by Top of the World is way too big and way too nice for me to want to move it now.  Too much of a PITA, given how long it took me to set everything up "just right".
---
Plus, it makes it a lot easier for players to move through all that space you've given them.  Some big camps are a nightmare to run through or around.
---
Sometimes i also get skipped for a day or even two, she just wants to talk about feelings. Im used to these kinds of bugs nowadays, just gotta go with the flow...
---
Fair, but does it even matter with the amount of people nuking ATLAS these days?
---
This. It’s the same shortcut for all the terminal menus.
---
agreed. a friend even asked me if i‘m video game addicted now that i log into this fucking game every day. hard to explain to other people. but yeah, it sucks.
---
I loved how the initial The Outer Worlds trailer was a giant middle finger to Fallout 76.  It will take a lot more than The Outer Worlds and the awful release of Fallout 76 to kill the Fallout Franchise.
---
Seriously! I mean, if beth is trying to do what all the other MMORPGs are going, why tf not have a weekly limit!? I haven't been online in a month now because I don't want to do the grind today, then tomorrow again, and again and again...
---
I don't understand what's the difference between uniform rank gain and uniform score gain. Could you please explain?
---
thanks. it is so sweet of you. i have friends of mine to help me out with that but i play at nights and i dont want to be depend on other players.
---
I also have a hard time not killing mobs in one second. Unless it's a Colossus or a Scorchbeast I tend to kill stuff very quickly. It's great when your being swarmed but people get mad at me for killing legendary creatures and preventing them from getting a legendary item. Most of the time I don't even know I've killed a legendary enemy until I loot the bodies. I don't mean to deprive folks of their rewards, but I can't help it.
---
Nah, the game is so much more special when you get something decent to play with.
---
I understand mate :) I do run nukes very quickly and can get keycards fast if you ever need any just let me know
---
Ah yes, thank you random redditor for this trustworthy information.
---
Pc? I heard that there is a bug where the atoms go to the wrong game version, Beth net instead of Steam!
---
If you convert the ammo then press back everytime, you not only can convert more ammo faster, but you also won't have to spam back to exit out of it.
---
People with infinite camp budget did use it, but it wasn't the cause of the infinite budget.
---
As long as it is not a atom shop item.  
---
Patch out a way to make camps look nice and sell you a solution for 1200 atoms that by the way there is no sustainable way to earn in game anymore.
---
Why does it work for him?  Money?  Meh.  I don't admire or aspire to be like  people with no integrity.  There is more to life that is worth keeping my honor.  That's just me, though.
---
That is a good idea - especially for fusion generators and decontamination showers.
---
I would also take it one step further and add a robot that automatically repairs your camp when damaged. Maybe it uses scrap from your stash or maybe it is powered by something you have to craft. Maybe it could be powered by the Camp repair kits you mentioned.
---
I'd say you've almost had to miss some. I play 2 hours per day tops, sometimes less and I'm level 80. I did miss one NW daily I believe but that's it.
---
We do the work of millions, good job brother.
---
8 super bowl wins is pretty honorable in my opinion.
---
A very small silver lining:
---
Farming for rare spawn points might be a little easier if you have 1st.
---
IF, and this is a big IF, they don't screw it up (hahahaha), it should work like ESO in that everything and everyone is automatically scaled to the max level. Lower level players will have an advantage from not being one shotted by running in to level 62 ferals that spawned from a high level player coming in to area (think Whitesprings). A level 5 player will NOT be equivalent to a level 50+ player, however. They'll have the SPECIAL and perks of a level 5, severely limiting their potential until they get specced out. ESO runs this way and I'm actuallya fan of it. It makes every location useful for higher level players instead of being stuck running West-Tek, Burrows, or silo runs for xp.
---
this guy gets it
---
it‘s not like the BoS themselves said that Vault 76 dwellers are responsible for donating and building up the observatory for their arrival. 
---
as far as i understood that‘s all coming from russel dorsey, who has never had any contact with the BoS besides listening to the same broadcasts as us. 👀
---
Or ban them as dupers?
---
Dang man, if you're on xbox and ever want to squad up feel free! I'm on xbox :)
---
That's probably what made the FO3 Brotherhood so enjoyable. They have a civilian force that hides behind them. They've taken direct or indirect responsibility over Megaton and Rivet City. They help distribute clean water to everyone. The FO3 Brotherhood could definitely be glue that leads to a larger civilization between Rivet City and Megaton....
---
Until Arthur Maxson fucked it up. They accepted the outcasts back into their ranks, reverted back to the technology-hoarder ways of old and are even speculated to have stripped fusion cores from Rivet City (something the citizens relied on) to power an airship. They kept some of Elder Lyon's ways of operating like open-recruitment, but it's used to further their agenda, no one else's. 
---
So, in FO4, they are essentially fascists. They claim to protect the Commonwealth while also stealing their food and taking away their technology.
---
as a matter of fact i use only bags on the private world. in general I transfer stuff for scrip for 4 my 2lvl mules. It is not a big deal if something happened but sometimes it is. Anyway thanks to point that out.
---
Hell yeah! Always feels great to win those especially when you're under geared!
---
This is an idea they’d probably actually use, too.
---
They fixed perk cards that was screwing up so you might be dealing more damage than usual causing it to break faster
---
I just did one for her today.
---
She told me that I'm the 'best' :) :) :)
---
Yeah, but somehow I think we'll meet each goal regardless of how many people stop donating. 
---
Otherwise, what was the point of BGS making new content?
---
Just about all my games are like this now days, someone nukes the final zone and you gotta burn 10 stims and rad-x, its crazy how good some players are! If you would like to squad up I'm on xbox :)
---
If it works at all like ESO's system (or GW2 for another example), low level and max level player are about the same power...BEFORE you account for getting high end gear and all the points your build needs.
---
So, a fresh level cap character might perform roughly the same as a leveling character, but as soon as they take a little time to optimize their character they leave a low level character in the dust.  There's no comparison.
---
If they do it right, an ungeared, unperked level 1 and level 50 will perform about the same.  Now add in perks and gear and you have your difference.
---
Will they do it right?  I have no idea.  But the concept alone isn't an issue.
---
Drink all the alcohol. It's the only answer.
---
I truly hate the the Insult Bot. The dad jokes it spouts are just horrible. Then it gives you a worthless item. Fuck that thing. I gun down Insult Bot on sight.
---
Yeah, but I wasn't even the one killing everything. I just sat there and my murder bot did all the work.
---
I’m on PC, sadly. Learnt about the nuke run so I just do that and slam nukes. One of my proudest wins was double nuke 14 kills.
---
It is! Thank you!
---
Also does anyone else think collecting a 100 peices of wood sucks when woodchucker doesn't work with it on the weekly quest?And I still get the fast travel bug!
---
Thank you! I'm too tired to play after work today but I logged in just for the freebies.
---
"Dear loyal players,
---
For sticking it through all the broken stuff since launch, here is an awesome outfit as a reward just for you veteran players! 
---
Hugs, 
---
Beth and Todd"
---
Just makes sense for that reward to also be broken.
---
I can't remember how long ago it was, but somebody essentially made a long post about what legendary gear they stashed vs what they found and after something like 100 legendary enemies they found that what they had in their stash was what they found the most of. They also got more nocturnal at night than in the day. Personally, I think there is some method to it, but it's a weird method of RNG and some invisible requirements we aren't aware of fully.
---
The more I play, the more I'm starting to believe it's not 100% RNG like some people claim or believe. Too many times I hop onto a server and it's nothing but nocturnal/Assassins all day, but another day its bloodied or junkies. And it's always the same kinds. Trash pistols or knives..
---
Sadly it doesn’t seem like it
---
Oh how I yearn for positive affirmation from that fine specimen of NPC
---
Mine goes away after closing out the game and relogging in
---
Yes it’s “hold” you guys have dumpster minds lol
---
Its almost complete
---
I dont mind donating junk. If it were ammo, guns or armor then that would be upseting. But its junk so meh. Besides, free cosmetics.
---
it will be autocompleted, most definitely. either way, the rewards suck. and i don‘t have high hopes for a good BoS that‘s worth joining, considering what beth has made out of them in all games since 3.
---
Seems to be fixed. (For me at least) Couldn't get in after many attempts yesterday (Wednesday night UK) but it worked first time tonight.
---
This bug seems to came with update 20 I know it started on the pts well for me at least it did now it's happening on regular servers as well and it really sucks
---
Its not been updated in almost 10 hrs from when i last checked so id assume its done now.
---
Did you see [this thread](https://redd.it/i4c4il)?
---
If you make arrows, and then throw them through the recently-updated ammo converter, you only use about 40% as much steel for the same amount of 5mm ammo. I wouldn't use it as your only source of the 5mm rounds, but it might be an option if you need to save some steel, or if you're out of lead and gunpowder.
---
Thank you! I can’t believe i never new about this!
---
Also works when a terminal has lagged out (i.e the daily terminal)~
---
Yeah I had to find the lyrics on a fo76 wiki!
---
I go through that 10 times over to change my actual account name.
---
That happens to me so much at the prison terminal.
---
Unarmed melee can one shot any non boss enemy at lv 30! It's hilarious, shame the SBQ is bugged to all hell and never lands anymore.
---
How to to 'fix' Ammo Converter:
---
Step 1: Scrap it down for parts
---
Step 2: Replace with a vendor who buys ammo for caps and also sells ammo for caps
---
Step 3: Profit
---
Grindings is good when mobs have specific rare drops. Events are good if they have specific rewards that are unique and you have the ability to influence for better drops and drop rates. Making drops completely RNG is not a good grind. When a lv 5 wolf and a lvl 95 SBQ can literally reward you the same legendary weapon minus the lvl difference, is not a good game design.
---
I buy plans from venders whenever I hit 20k or even less. There is no so many plans to buy actually so when I am done I will help to players buying their stuff for adequate prices. I already did this kind of shoping and at least 10% of u are good. Of course I didnt buy everything just from a player.
---
ur words have sence. as i told u i support ur concern but if u do care about caps so yes.. unstock and stock it again. What else can u do right now?
---
Go bloodied, with nerd rage, serendipity, and ricochet, it's epic running through a hail of bullets and take little to no damage at all as you take them out one by one!
---
MODUS and The Enclave thank you.
---
I wish the mountain scout outfit still made the backpack invisible. I know it was a bug, but to me it was truly a feature. I’m sure I’m not the only one!
---
I appreciate it must be difficult with Covid but this game really needs some new content I’m starting to get really burnt out on just doing queens and the same old events. 
---
Hopefully they do actually release the new event in two weeks (although I’m sceptical) but I’m worried about what’s coming after that.
---
In my experience, whenever I am wanting some particular drop, I will never get it. The minute I stop caring I get good shit. RNGesus works in mysterious ways.
---
This is how I play. I stream and show people on twitch how I get 45,000 EXP per ~10 minutes.
---
In terms of bloodied builds, if you've played any other MMO(ish) games, and you're being honest, you have to expect it's going to get nerfed.  It's amazing it's been allowed for this long.  Unyielding, even more than Bloodied, performs so far beyond other legendary properties it's ridiculous, and the perk synergy on low health builds is pretty wild too.
---
Sure, they should meet in the middle and bring a lot of other things up, but realistically they can't bring everything up to the power of a bloodied build if they have any intent of keeping the game healthy.
---
You essentially had no armour on, so er/dr was 0 (no PA, but couldn't equip any clothes/armour). Thankfully people figured out workarounds like dying a certain way...
---
Just make ammo scrap to components
---
I don't think that's the case. A lot of 76 updates don't really add anything to the game.
---
The issue with this one is it removed a lot of features people liked, and broke a ton of other ones.
---
I feel this update is very much a "straw that broke the camel's back" situation for a lot of people. It's not that much different to the shit that happens with most updates to this game... But it's just the one where it became too much.
---
I remember people using voice chat to just chill in Flatwoods and talk about how excited they were for the game and to see real people. And offering advice. It was a simpler time
---
Little did we know it’s actually Todd who personally goes in and names every item.. that’s why it’s so bad
---
I tested this myself this morning after loosing a bunch of gear to a disconnect during load in. It is not working as intended. 2 out of 3 attempts had me in a new instance/server, and the 3rd time worked as it should. Hopefully it has been fixed. It sounds like there may have been some kind of hot fix or server maintenance earlier, but I haven't been on to check.
---
Not exactly the same issue, but I had to loot a SBQ tonight during the black screen bug, by following the other player markers to it when they ran in for their loot.
---
It was not really worth the effort for that 2 Star Troubleshooter's Pickaxe.
---
Chances are you shouldn't have had the the rare plans that drop if it wasn't for dupers. My guess is Bethedsa planned on keeping those in the loot pool to give players who didn't get them during the holiday event more opportunities to learn them. Just because you picked them up at a train station and/or duped presents doesn't mean Bethesda has to add new plans to the loot table.
---
Lol. I love it when WL band wagoners come here and complain about too little content. Also this isn't BGSs game, it's Bethesda Austin's and they work on it exclusively. BGS is currently producing Starfield.
---
AA will be a more consistent weapon IMO.
---
2 of them?   Must be nice I swear I'm only getting crappy melee weapons from everything.   I seriously counted 8 in a row over two days.  :(
---
Id love this, the five biggest morons in the game, sounds lovely
---
i remember logging out with power armor on and logging back in with a significant weight buff. I also remember when crafting the excavator PA it took an ungodly amount of screws and springs, which you couldn’t just go grab at a player vendor -.-
---
Oh wow thanks I had no idea that was a thing
---
AFAIK you cannot count on being placed back into the same session RN, so definitely not a safe way to transfer.
---
My plans are 5, ammo 1, guns 500 per *, armor 250 per star*. Doesn't matter if it is a bloodied jetpack of cloying absurdity.  Getting the cap limit is easy, and the only thing I spend caps on is fast travel. Why hold on to excess
---
It’s not a Bethesda game if it isn’t corrupting your save files
---
Ngl I thought it was hole too
---
Get outta here, lmao. There's so much new shit. I've put in 100s of hours post-wastelanders and still encounter the occasional new thing, and I haven't even booted up a second character to play through the other heist alliance yet.
---
Try server hopping, sometimes that fixes issues with terminals.
---
It depends on where you build. There are some places that are close to spawn points and get attacked constantly. However, there are other places that rarely get attacked.
---
I bought Herd Mentality, Eason a team, popped it and Nothing happened. So idk maybe they are broken.
---
From my experience I seem to get 80% melee related legendaries because I play melee 99% of the time.
---
But I know the have nerfed the potentional legendary spawn rate
---
Being able to kill anything quickly with a TSE shotgun or handmade.
---
Everything rare is extremely duped, are you.... clueless?
---
Fair enough.
---
Cool man! I bought and played fallout 4, fallout 3 and fallout new Vegas. I’m a real band wagoner
---
Even easier. +1 from me.
---
From my experience steam always charges ur card a day before monthly subs are due, check to see if u have any payments failed.
---
I donated 2k out of 4k then got on my husbands and did the same. I feel i done my part for the steel...
---
thanks, mate! I have some of them for my next season of nuking. Btw they patched the hole in silos and now we cant do silo in 6 min or so.
---
... Maybe  
---
Put in a support ticket to Bethesda that Miner miracles is bugged and it needs to be reset and it should be fixed, may take time  
---
or just get someone to make  set of level 45 for you, put calibrated shocks, reactive plates, and targeting hud on it
---
Maybe bugged, if ur on pc and can provide the mats I can craft u a lvl 50 set tomorrow
---
You scanned your LVL 25 armor that someone else made for you? 
---
If you can't start that quest, you might've just skipped it and completed it. That's literally the last step of the quest to register your Excavator armor.
---
For 76 you are.
---
Donated 10k steel. That’s about it
---
I have, I think the issue is that youre supposed to go to the terminal first and learn the plans then build the armor. Then you go scan it and the mission completes. I went in already wearing the armor and scanned it first without knowing what I was supposed to be doing. That completed the mission so now I think I just cant get it. Ive had nothing bad bad experiences with this game.
---
I started playing over the last double xps weekend so I am poorly behind with plans and caps for being level 95. I appreciate scrapping every weapon I find and donating the steel. I need to learn the mods anyway
---
Patsy IS pretty awesome. Though I prefer Kitty Wells.
---
Absolutely.
---
It's a common drop, it's not really worth more than that it be honest!
---
i’ve really been slipping up with doing everything else in life during the week thanks to this. work 11 hours a day 6 days a week, play 3 and then sleep. today was my first day off the game in a while. cleaned my whole downstairs lol
---
I'll give you that one that's a good one
---
Doesn't phase me, if you want something that someone has you'll get it.
---
If you would rather spend 1,000+ more hours of the *chance* for getting it -goodluck
---
Nothing what other people do on fallout 76 affects my game play.
---
The way I fixed it was to, first rejoin game, put the fuse into the box, go to the terminal and read all the journal entries, then after doing that I analyzed the blood sample and it started working. 
---
Dont know if this'll help many others but hopefully it'll help someone.
---
No surorise, yep
---
Ohhh this is not what I was thinking about then, my apologies.
---
It's invisible for other people too!
---
This. I see this event as us literally throwing our scrap away for pretty much no reason. Sure, roleplay/story factor. 
---
But, on that note, why would we donate our hard earned scrap to people that abandoned us?
---
Yea they broke it with the patch
---
Last night I was transferring a max level explosive handmade, 150 stims, and a buttload of nuclear keycards to my main, I use the green suitcases at train stations and it disconnected on me while I was loading my main character. It went back to the start screen, I pressed play, selected my private world again and loaded in. Right away traveled to the train station and all my stuff was still in the suitcase! I was holding my breath the whole time in the loading screens.. its wacky rn but it still works after a server disconnect.  For now.
---
Anyone want the Atom Cats back?
---
It's crooked to have everything rigged daily. I mean, yah, it spoon feeds content to the completely addicted(myself included), but it also promotes a really unhealthy relationship to the game for everyone else.  I've seen comments suggesting it's so they can game thier own metrics, which sounds depressingly believable. Metrics always reward the crooked.
---
Man you tell me if a drum mag ACTUALLY carries 30 rounds, NOT NEVER, that’s immensely immersion breaking and bullshit, and it’s not just handmade but EVERY.OTHER.GUN
---
Hey just give me your login details and I'll claim them for you, I promise I'll only steal your valuable legendaries and rare outfits. You can keep anything else
---
Very easy on PC to load up two fallout 76 or more if you want at the same time.
---
Is there any way I can get around the bug?
---
Nim nim nim nim nim nim nim.
---
The point is you shouldn't have to, eCommerce 101 keep the customer in your shop. 
---
I'm looking at camp items and skins not buying a fucking car.
---
Right on dude. If you’re content with this game then feel free to browse right past the post.
---
I honestly find it cool. Sometimes I dont want my jetpack showing cause it ruins an outfit and when I do it's just a quick reselect
---
If you enabled the camp skin from the legendary run then that could be the problem. I ran into the same problem when I equipped that skin and made my camp, it makes your camp invisible even when your vendors are on.... had to remake the whole thing
---
i get your point, not arguing with that. i‘m just saying, you don‘t have to „literally“ look at it with and without 1st.
---
When was this? What is the items
---
For some reason, not all free items are always in the featured free section. I’ve had everything in the featured free section and still had the banner until I realized another freebie was hiding somewhere. 
---
That said, Bethesda, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Idk about peaceful. I’d always run into super mutants there
---
I’m glad to hear you have cards and sad to hear about the hole, I loved that thing
---
On launch, the game was having huge frame rate issues when using fast RoF weapons (PS4). Getting my entire Excavator power armor deleted due to a bug was the last straw, so I quit.  
---
I came back to try the new storyline now that NPCs were added, so I started a new character. I'm now around level 16, and it feels like the entire world just constantly has random frame rate issues whenever I'm outdoors. The "jumping puzzle" is infuriating because there is a slight delay/jank with character movement, capturing workshops is laggy as ever, and my god I tried Feed the People event with 6-7 others and it was a laggy mess. I can't even imagine nuke areas / scorch queen.  
---
I re-installed FO76 from scratch, rebuilt PS4 database, tried to run the game on SSD/HD, I even cleaned my PS4 from all the dust. Nothing helped. I have 0 issues in ANY other game on my PS4.  
---
I came to the conclusion that FO76 is still a badly optimized game (at least for base PS4), so I don't think I will continue. What a shame.
---
There just missing the flag like me. RNG is uncaring of players and npcs alike.
---
Uninstalling didn't work sadly
---
So I went there wearing a set of level 25 excavator armor crafted by someone else. I started the quest, went downstairs and hit the scan button not knowing what it was. That auto completed the quest and now I cant get the plans off the terminal.
---
It's doing the challenging group content with friends is the point on MMOs. Just happens to be grindy.
---
that's purposely hidden to reduce the value of your subscription. Bunch of carpet baggers run this game.
---
Been saying since launch it was a bad idea to shove an online multiplayer into that oldass laggy engine.
---
This is a known bug... Get rid of the bugged camp module skin from the legendary run
---
I 100% agree, but we know the game is designed to punish players who don't login daily.
---
Did you install the door after placing?  It’s listed under the walls section for some reason.
---
After the dupe ban wave the amount of legendaries that would spawn has been severely dropped for me. 
---
I use to always get at least minimum 2 per high level location, now I'd be lucky to get 2 per server...
---
Ok. I apologize then. I posted with the self imposed restriction of how do you do it in the game. 
---
I mean all online mmo games I've seen rely or at least are greatly augmented by online resources, some official, some 3rd party, but the UI stinks and if you are on PC it's especially painful. It's like they have no idea how people naturally use a mouse.
---
I had my turrets maxed out. My firebase was under constant attack by anglers.
---
I do it every time.  I did it my first try as well.  Not sure why everyone thinks it’s this super boss level.  No King Kupa at the end
---
I got a 1\* Zealot's Fixer from one of the Bot Patrols today. Not exactly what I was looking for to replace my EDC, but with a prime receiver I found it pretty handy for sniping the queen's minions.
---

---
We'll see when concrete/cork days come.
---
Steel is easy to get but 200 million cork... lol
---
Someone with the guts to help...
---
I will have to look her up,  
---
 I mostly listened to only jazz and big band/swing, though my father for his odd love of music was pushing heavy metal and death metal in the 80s when I was young. He is still an oddity to this day listening to Kpop and baby metal along with frankie, elvis, KISS and guns and roses with the occasional old school brittany, he is 83 this year so we forgive him for his odd shuffled play mixes.
---
what in the earth makes u think that way? haters is a common thing in every online game but "many of us" = 5-10% in general and not every hater uses reddit. A normal human being wont consume a product he didnt like. btw the event is awesome.
---
feel free to downvote this comment to understand how many haters we have here.
---
Steel is easy. So many players donated 10-20k steel just to see what the loot table was like. Only takes 8400 players doing that to get there. The pc servers alone have 10k+ players playing at anytime on steam.
---
Real test will be cork.
---
The steam overlay that comes up interacts weird with alt-tabing and the pipboy.
---
Personal experience: I’ve been on a few servers that have dropped 5 bloodied weapons out of like 6 or 7 drops total. Some are empty and yesterday I got 3 straight railway rifles on queen events (rather annoying but)
---
lol all good :) 
---
this game‘s UI is like a relic of a time that should be laid to rest. it‘s unintuitive and WAY too colorful. it started okay-ish, but with the addition of public teams and their obnoxious notifications it‘s just gotten a lot worse.
---
My god this is beautiful thank you
---
Bethesda Wood If They Could, But They Can't So They Shat :-)
---
From what a I’ve learned on this Falloutragers sub is it’s a place for folks to throw massive tantrums, cry it out, then get back to playing.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat with all updates, content releases, and hot fixes.
---
Yeah I still don’t get why they’re using it. It looks so outdated as well
---
Check out her song Making Believe,  and Social Distortions cover on the album Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell.
---
I'm doing my part.
---
Donated 50k steel on day 1. 
---
Got about 6K concrete.  I'll donate most of it cause I want the community reward.
---
Next two weeks after that I'll give a little, but I'm done with the season so I don't really care.
---
When it returns, I'll donate most of my wood and cloth.
---
Sorry, what? The DRUM MAG is the thing breaking your immersion? Loooooool. 
---
This is a game where you can literally tank a small nuclear device to your face. Where a 50cal machine gun weighs ~20lbs (they weigh like 80 IRL, *empty*. Double that with a 250 box mag.) we’ve got giant flying mutated bats. We’ve got semi-sentient robots. Magical armor that literally weighs nothing. Drugs that can heal us from shattered bones and near-death to happy and healthy in seconds.
---
But no, it’s the drum mags that throw you right out of your immersion. That’s cool, man.
---
They meant after they ate a sandwich, then come back
---
Having the exact same problem over here! Checking card validity rn
---
I agree, a strong melee build can deal crazy damage numbers my melee build I have dealt [+40,000 damage](https://imgur.com/gallery/Q4VQUAq) to a deathclaw, I'm yet to test it on a sbq...
---
I'm pretty sure most of the fo76 community would agree that patch 21 was indeed a colossal problem.
---
Same here, ghoul slayers pistols with bashing, royal quality reward from the queen
---
Bethesda didn't add the rare plans to this event's loot table though. The only plans I missed from the treasure hunting event are NOT in this event's loot table.
---
What you try is to get an alternate character and level it up so that it can kill crickets and see if that fixes this bug.
---
Sounds like you might've locked yourself out of getting the plans on that character you're playing. I've never seen the plans anywhere else in the game. If you already have the LVL 25 set, the only difference you're missing would be the durability of the armor, you still have the ore collection aspects of the armor and the carry weight buffs, those are really the only benefits over the other armors. 
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Pretty sure it shows up for you but its your account name for everyone else just like monster mash
---
I carry zero
---
If u also buy 2 consoles sure...
---
Only way around it is weapon wheel then select a different gun then go back to your primed GL from the different weapon.
---
Glad I'm not the only one. Thought something was going on with my pc
---
Sounds deadly! I wouldn't want to be in a lobby with you lol
---
the 30k limit is to prevent inflation, they have been really succesful at controlling the value of caps. But holy shit, yah, I hear you, they need a better mechanic for preventing selling items that put you grossly over max caps.
---
My bad, good catch. Here, have an upvote.
---
250 steel
---
I’ve been playing the last month as a level 164 sneak switchblade and silenced 10mm.  Once I optimized my build, I can one stab just about any enemy.  I love walking up to a super mut and stabbing them in the head and literally have the mutant next to him not realize he’s dead
---
I maxed out number of turrets placed simply because I love the symphony of machine gun fire every time I travel to camp :) :) They also provide me w free lead scrap due to all the protectrons the turrets are constantly killing.  Oh and bears.  Lots of bears.
---
EDIT: Im in the ash heap. I think. By the firing range w the paper target daily quest.
---
After a whitsprings nuke everyone selling all their shitty legendaries to the vendors. So many of them aswell
---
Thank you for sharing your Survivor Story.
---
 💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵💵
---
Therapy starts monday
---
Right? If they're too much of a scrooge to set proper ammo prices I just abandon the camp.
---
Some of my weapons wont display anymore and my jetpack keeps disappearing too
---
I wish you all the best.
---
Beautfiul photo OP! I had my camp set up on the lead node for about 12 months, I honestly miss the feelings of vastness and desolation that used to exist, it was just so quiet with the game music turned down. I'm grateful that I was able to spend hours and hours basking in the now lost serenity because even though we now have more "content", west virginia will never be the same...
---
This is the reason why I dont open my 150+ perk card packs
---
I have no problem selling them for 10k
---
It's to add a survival element to the game so you can't hoard the world supply of every ammunition. Its honestly watered down when you you have first and can as much scrap as you want. The first year, plastic was absolute gold since you can bulk junk item with it. I recommend keeping no more than 40 radaways and stimpaks. They weigh more than you think.
---
Eh.  Once you get all the cards you need.
---
Nope doesn’t look like they made an attempt yet. Playing right now without it and boy do I miss that Scrap box lol
---
Those were great times. I remember being level 25 on my main, going there and being hugged by so many guys who had rushed to level 100+. That was an amazing place to build the first community of the game. Shame that's gone now.
---
My grenade launcher, yeah.  Had to fix it 3 times during scorched earth yesterday
---
I have 10 turrets too and a few purifiers then there’s little budget left for anything else, which is why I’ve never spent an atom on camp stuff.
---
I'll play around with that. Does it matter if my weapon is holstered or not?
---
I might look for a resource node in the ash heap than.  Idk.
---
If you're on PS4 I can help you some time. I have first so I have most mats lol. My psn is kit_cloud, I'm est btw.
---
Wait, there's supposed to be a mask too?
---
I've got 2 uny pieces, &amp; my first roll I ever did was also a Uny piece.
---
I'd say its worth it
---
I stopped playing before everyone stopped nuking whitesprings, so I’ve never known why they stopped and got back into fo76 for about a month or two now, was there a patch or something?
---
Well glad it’s not just me lol hopefully it will start working again tomorrow. Trying to deal without it right now but prob just gonna call it a night soon
---
That damn ropes course in the Forest. Now that I have a jetpack it's no problem to get to the end. But during BETA I must have spent half of my time just trying to see what was there.
---
Wow it's the Pete Hines response to criticism
---
Ah.
---
This! It's only been out almost 2 years, and every single time they touch the code something has broken, and often fixed bugs come right back 2 patches later. I mean, people really need to understand that this is an absolutely common issue in game development and every game slogs through a quagmire of shit to get the simplest things done! Jeez guys
---
Wasn't worth the time and effort to collect from the piles on my last RR run.
---
Though I did one earlier today and it worked fine.
---
Oh, I was talking to someone through steam around when it happens.  That makes so much sense.
---
No, they're competitors, but if you're inaccurately using one as a synonym for "authoritarian dictatorship," the other fits that description just as well, which was my whole point in saying that people don't know what fascism actually is.
---
To bring it back to the original point, it's been a while since I've played 4 and I only got into the BoS for the vertibird because I played survival, so I don't remember, were they actually trying to establish themselves as the government? Because I don't remember that. I seem to remember it as a combat mission.
---
Can confirm, mine is also fixed.
---
Wasn't it 200 before 400?
---
Egghead seems borked. It shows as -3 strength, and encumbers me. When I take Class Freak off and re equip, it unencumbers me and goes back to -1 strength.
---
I don’t even know what that’s supposed to mean, but responding to something you disagree with with a personal attack instead of a reasoned argument is a pathetic look. 
---
This whole chain is pretty pathetic to be honest. Lots of downvotes, and the only two dudes with the balls to actually post some argument have terrrrible ones.
---
GTA is a large world but it does not have as many objects that you can interact with. You can drive cars, so I will give it that. But there is a big difference when you consider just how many objects you can interact with in this game.
---
The more punk approach is pleasing to my ears. Personal preference had been to stay away from strict country that has slow tempo. But thank you for putting me on to something different will have to give more cowpunk a listen.
---
For sure. This needs to happen.
---
Shared Herd Mentality Perk!
---
I assumed the haters would actually be outnumbered by players that don't even know what or where ATLAS is.
---
Probably
---
You mean to cause the bug? Not sure but I get it a lot too switching between Gatling Lasers. Iirc the bug still happens if weapon is not drawn.
---
PA plans, dense mods, and plasma grenade plans didn't have high drop rates during the holiday event.
---
Sorry i dont know  for sure but i dont think so.
---
Maybe... just maybe.... a lot of people just like to have fun and play the game. Maybe all of you “boycotters” are actually just a vocal extremely small minority.
---
This happened to me. I my first stopped working a day prior to my monthly sub ending. Even after signing up for he annual it took 3 days to work. What I was told by customer service at steam was it's sometting about bethesda issuing a key for your sub to steam that's not working.
---
Aggressively contact both steam and bethesda.
---
I feel like part of the reason its limited so hard is to encourage selling the items to players
---
I ran across [this scene](https://i.imgur.com/iLC8wk4.png) today. I don't know what the heck was going on, but I couldn't even look at it without frying my GPU.
---
Dude you're working harder than Bethesda's entire PR department... honest question, are they paying you? I legit wouldn't even be mad if they are it would actually be refreshing to know they care enough to do so.
---
Are your xbox's using the same ports? It may help to switch 1 or both xbox's to use different ports, just not the same ports.
---
Thanks I have an anti armor one I am using though
---
You do realize that this subreddit isn’t the entire Fallout 76 community, right?  Just because some people here *said* they were going to boycott (some because the rewards are ‘lame’) doesn’t mean the majority of the community will. 
---
And those ‘lame’ rewards aren’t lame to new players. And it’s far easier to donate 250 Steel than it was to grind enough caps to buy wrapping paper. 
---
The FO76 community is a lot bigger than this little sub, my friend.
---
I push it all the time. The scrip limit has my box full of legendaries I can't do anything with. I list them in my vendor but still don't sell them at a fast enough pace to keep up.
---
10k weekly limit for caps, 2k weekly limit for Scrip.
---
Yeah lay off! Poor guy practically built the whole game himself. Show some appreciation!
---
Ok, you're first in line to donate then.
---
I did but i think I’m screwed. I spent hours today doing this I’m so agro
---
Also, any primary and +33% VATS Hit chance will make it magic. I bought a TS33% from a vendor, and it works wonders.
---
Meeeee toooo, time to put the nuclear winter tracksuit to good use.
---
Well if you want Bethesda's help I'd suggest their forums. This one isn't run by them.
---
You should drop all your excess notes and holotapes. If you haven’t already done so you will notice a large increase in performance. Keeping a small managed inventory free of clutter is the best way to get better frame rates.
---
Looks like someone's base needs a few 100 Explosive baits. Batta-batta-SWING!
---
Aighty
---
How is posible to do that? I mean,  what's the way? Both launchers, or have to use any program? (In that case, is it "secure"?)
---
I like it better. Was able to get to 40k points in no time and bought 10k 50 ammo with it. Although I think PC players can move through the dialogue better.
---
This update was never supposed to be a content update. They said repeatedly it was a bug fix patch. Not every patch is going to bring new quests. You had unrealistic expectations.
---
You’ve only been playing for a few months. There is no way you’ve exhausted all of the content already unless you play 8 hours a day.
---
Strange, I’m on PS4, and after this patch, SBQ became much harder to kill due to how rare she lands, might be a coincidence though.
---
Good point. I just saw them doing stuff in this subreddit so I thought I'd try but the official forums are probably better suited. Thanks!
---
Thanks for the PSA!
---
yes and no. Place Everywhere came with it‘s downsides.
---
I have experience creating servers on Discord and I really like doing that. Send me a message and we can figure it out together :D
---
You can launch fallout 76 as many times as you want, your pc will run slower.
---
I'm not sure if you can do it via steam, but that's how I've traded my stuff to my mule account.
---
I have two copies of fo76
---
My console almost pooped yesterday because of a Line in the Sand. I just traveled back to c.a.m.p. noy worth trying to loot. Worst I've ever seen so far.
---
if she disappears or dies out of bounds try fast travel away and then back. Most times she will reappear near you.  You got the broadsider because since the latest patch the reward for just completely the event can now be a weapon as well as armor. Before it was always a piece of armor.
---
I can craft any serum, but won’t be on for the next 9 hours. If you like just add me and hit me up ingame, if we’re on at the same time -
---
ign Wasteland.Joe
---
I understand what you're trying to say but they're are mmo games that have just as much interactive elements that run just fine like elder scrolls online or even outside of mmos again red dead redemption 2 that has online component with a shit load of interactive elements still not as much but it also looks better too I don't think it's the interactive stuff that makes 76 run bad it's an engine problem they've been using the same engine for years obviously while tweaking and an trying to update it but there's only so much ya can do with an engine that old it's not a bad engine it wasn't designed for a huge multiplayer game it's best suited to RPGs like Skyrim and fallout 4 and stuff like that ya know what I mean
---
Im level 26 and I love it there. Been there since 15. Theres a little road behind my camp where all kinds of random shit happens (crashed cargobots, random dead bodies, lemonade stands etc) Never a dull moment lol. 
---
Oh and a bunch of scorched w missile codes.  I get at least 2 or 3 a day for all 3 silos. Never used em, but now I know where tp get launch codes hahaha
---
Especially the massive trees that very easily get in our way
---
Is ESO the same cash cow that FO76 is? I sort of wonder if FO76 isn’t a grand experiment for them to test the balance of how far they can push the profitability of the game by keeping dev costs at a minimum while building as much monetization in as possible. Until we stop paying them, there’s no incentive not to do that other than, potentially, long term brand impact. However, in the case of FO76, they’re in a uniquely advantageous position there because they have already been raked through the coals in the press and, despite that, they have an extremely passionate, almost cult-like fanboi base that shouts down any negative criticisms by the other players. It’s not sustainable because the fanbois are most likely not the paying players; the complaining ones are. But I don’t think the point of FO76 is to be sustainable over the long haul. I suspect that they are already working on another Fallout game and that’s where the real dev time is going. If correct, FO76 is just the test to see how much cash they can milk out of all of us with the next iteration of the franchise.
---
Yeah, traded 2 berserker weapons for a crazy guy mask earlier today
---
Do you still need to spam menus like imbecile?
---
Delay? I personally have not experienced that, or at least not anything i've noticed.
---
I have a berserker rifleman. It’s an okay build
---
Yeah the community managers participate here sometimes and have been known to help escalate people's support tickets on occasion, but it's still a better bet to work with Bethesda directly. Good luck!
---
Yes, Sniper. full sneak....
---
And now we have a third event to get them. They aren't rare. The only rare plans were new to the treasure hunting event, and they are conspicuously missing from this one. Which is one of the reasons I'm not donating any of my resources to this poorly implemented event.
---
Imma bet a huge chunk of the people complaining don’t even play. Lots of trolls out there who just like to shit on the game.  Vocal minority.
---
Alas I've tried that xD  it kinda improved it but not by much at least in my experience anyway
---
The Brotherhood NEEDS that plastic
---
It’s an exploit
---
Beth is Trump?
---
What is rng
---
Either way, we will “win” the event because it would look bad if we failed. Besides, its unlikely Beth planned a scenario where the BoS arrives to a half finished base, so... yeah. The event will succeed, regardless of whether we actually meet the quota or not.
---
Check the other subs. This one doesn’t allow bartering.
---
Ah, true. I was thinking of PC version, and just running 2 instances of the game.
---
At this point the code is an unknowable monolith that they sacrifice interns to.
---
Edit: well now I'm mad I haven't found a Dunwich Horror reference in Appalachia.
---
Oh, my bad
---
I’m boycotting the boycott!
---
I did this for the first time today, around 4pm EST and it was working for me too.
---
No worries. 
---
And happy Pre-Cake Day!
---
Been running a berserkers build for over a year. Loads of fun.
---
If you turn off grass, it makes everything much look much cleaner.
---
I read your posts on the pc support forum and didn't have any luck initially.
---
Everytime I join another server my only options are insert fuse and analyze samples. I insert fuse and attempt to analyze but no luck. It finally worked when I created a private world though.
---
Potentially had something to do with a fresh world possibly? Hard to tell with limited attempts sadly and I'm fresh out of free character slots to test now lol
---
At least they used bullets and didn't just cheese you down with Tesla's.
---
If that's the case,  then look up Mike Ness' solo stuff.
---
Country doesn't necessarily mean slow. Audio check out Hank 3 and The Supersuckers. They're about half country and half rock and roll.
---
Whe was the last content update lmao. I’ve been playing for at least 3 months because I caved when the pandemic hit. They fixed bugs by creating new ones.
---
It's an exploit.
---
It's entirely possible that people who are using this exploit will end up losing their accounts, so I wouldn't look into it any father than 'it's not allowed'.
---
Bartering posts aren’t allowed in this sub. Try one of the others.
---
I sign on deposit my treasury notes and get my scrip, run a few sbqs and sign off now. That’s where I’m at
---
Ok I’ll add you thanks a lot
---
Two patches ago... wastelanders. In April.
---
I'll see about getting you in on the server.
---
for some reason .44 is one by best sellers at 1c along with 5mm.
---
Absolutely.  Never done it any other way.
---
Stealth makes it easier.  Do be careful not to shoot yourself if you're using an explosive weapon.  Make sure to bring an extra key card with you in case something goes wrong when entering the code (had a whole run scrapped by a lag spike once.)
---
Where are Junk Walls in the build menu? I don’t think I’ve ever seen them?
---
i scrip-change the 3 stars, sell everything else. between the weapons, armor and low limits, no point in holding onto it all.
---
Okayo!
---
How many hours do you have in the game? Did you just plow through the wastelanders quests when you started 3 months ago?
---
I'll give that a shot
---
How? I seriously can't sell it for free most of the time.
---
if you are getting close to the cap limit though it is easy to buy 10k rounds and save yourself the crafting time. and it gives someone else 10kc to play with
---
I really cannot figure it out!
---
What system do u play i got 7k 44 ammo if u r on ps4
---
I do need your Discord. Hooook me up.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/edit#gid=0 How many did you get from the holiday event just by opening presents before the dupes? I didn't get any of the PA plans or dense mods and farmed a lot.
---
You don't need to get the codes anyway to launch them, but a random event location like that is cool.
---
Some of the Power Armor plans for the mods are actually bugged apparently and will never drop. So if those are things anyone is hoping for theyre SOL
---
You don’t find it a problem that it was only one quest story line of approximately 4 missions for each faction until you have to pick one? That and there’s literally nothing else to do other than explore the map, do the sub-par BOS quests, and the 4 enclave quests before you can launch a nuke? Kill 10 sbs? Lmao come on man. Have really gone to 100s of hours of playability and storylines in fallout 4 to settling for 20 quests?
---
Emphasis on *two* of them to take a workshop from a Lvl 45....
---
I love private server for farming workshops. Set like ten up while I rob Appalachia blind for an hour or two.
---
We received a notification of failure before I got the legendary.  She died virtually on top of the Bunker.  (You know the one I mean.) Her corpse was split by the perimeter fence.
---
I know the bug you are referring to, though.  It's the same corpse bug that has a legendary Scorchbeast that I had previously liked continually respawn with the same lootables remaining next to me in the Cranberry Bog.  Bodies gaming from the sky every five minutes. All Scorchbeast carcasses are bugged to hell and back in that area.
---
I gave 250 to get a look at the "reward" box then walked.  Dross.
---
Rothen#5701
---
I like to run around naked.... does that count?
---
But when you do get max rep... oh boy that gauss minigun is nice.
---
Press and hold B.
---
Boy listen it’s the thing that worked over in fallout 4 and that they removed it’s not immersion breaking to me alone, but literally more people in the whole world will say it’s a bad move to remove that capacity, and you tell me if a drum magazine holds 30 rounds, don’t worry I’ll wait
---
big
---
Yep. But how big in meters/units?
---
All this needs to happen but it won't...
---
very big
---
Thanks. That definitely answered my question.
---
I just got the game today and have experienced that delay but it's not that bad. Its maybe a millisecond for me. It's not game breaking.
---
Yeah that ones going to be the litmus test for bullshit if cork completes as fast as steel
---
np my guy, any time
---
It’s like ‘why not’. There’s only so many PAs in the game, might as well collect them all. I don’t know what else to buy anyways, already got the SS set gauss mini and shotgun, no other gold items interest me anyways.
---
Just nuke it and find out
---
User name checks out.
---
Who says it’s not?
---
I threw in about 5k, and that's only the steel I scrounged up in the last couple days. Got a bunch of aid items and a couple of prime receiver plans, which sounds about right for someone raising an army to fight the scorched plague. I've also been buying bulk cork in preparation for that push. I'm not expecting much from the event, I'm just doing it for the Thunder. I mean, the BoS were out there dying for Appalachia while I was tucked safely in my vault, so I reckon it's the least I can do. If we're going to rebuild a broken world then [someone has to ante up.](https://i.imgur.com/udmIP3j.png)
---
The nuka cola machine can hold any bottled beverage.  Basically any drink with no spoil timer.
---
Yeah wouldn’t be too keen on copping a ban haha have had this account for about a year and only really been able to put in like an hour a week, so don’t want to start that again haha
---
The greatest is Mrs Elva Miller.
---
Yup. Berserker commando. Think of it as playing the game on hard mode.
---
That really cemented my desire to ignore this event.
---
My PS4 gave me an overheating message at radiation rumble. I was trying to collect loot but I could barely move. Had to fast travel out of there and leave three legendary corpses behind. 
---
Next time, I will try to pick up the piles before they build up to see if that helps. They really need to fix this Pronto.
---
I had the same problem earlier and found out that if you hold B it hard exits the terminal
---
And the fact you’re seemingly attacking everyone here by calling the whole chain pathetic only paints you in a jackass personality, I hope you know that, correct? The fact I stated that a drum magazine is pretty immersion breaking because it’s significantly low for what it’s real life counter part actually entails, the fact the fact you’re acting like a “bully” by stating “and the only two dudes with the balls” makes it seem like you’re somthing to be feared. Just because we had a view point and I expressed how it’s immersion breaking and that set you off doesn’t give you that right to go off on every single person by calling everyone out when not everyone was even involved with this
---
Yup. It was supposed to come out when the outfit did. There’s a blank space for it in the atom shop.
---
Ah yes, please buff the second best weapon in the game because it’s not as good as the first best weapon.
---
Didn’t feel any dramatic change. Someone froze the queen in the latest one I just did, she never regen and never spawned any adds, just died after some very slow attempts to dab us. They SHOULD make the queen harder as an endgame boss but apparently they didn’t.
---
Obviously in game it’s probably not a realistic blast radius, but here’s info on a [real nuclear blast zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_nuclear_explosions).
---
I’d say ask r/FalloutLore, they may know, they always know.
---
I went to low level players and dumped them on them lol they're their curse now.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess 100 units. I'll ask thanks.
---
im not buying the server stability line. there is 25 ppl on any given instance. most of the stuff in your containers arent rendered in waiting. if you have 100 mini nukes, they arent all literally rendered. in storage, all that stuff is just data, sums, integers, values. even the legendaries. if it doesnt have a unique look (and even then) its just [default weapon x] + [modifier]. if that was the case, most mmorpgs wouldnt be able to exist. hell, nuclear winter would cave on itself, as the ~100 players all have their own self-contained inventories. fo76 has server issues, but it aint the players' inventory. its shitty netcode or poor optimization, which i believe it to be. i think storage budgets has more to do with "stablizing" the games ad hoc economy. if you could hold everything, thered be a constant stream of players flooding the game with, well, everything. in other (actual) mmorpgs, this isnt a problem, because whats to horde? anything worth of value would require some great feat to make it distinguishing (think the myriad crafting systems in various games that you have to level up individually to make the good stuff). in fo76, you can literally just walk upon a bag of legendaries some player didnt want. when thats the case, how do you make anything seem "valuable"? but artifically capping how much you can hold! the scrips, storage, gold, etc.
---
Don't they move in game? I always thought they did.
---
Mole rats' heads exploding by themselves would be pretty funny if it didn't happen every time. Maybe it's my Internet speed or something.
---
What do you mean??
---
So... The bag has a....g-spot....
---
I do the same on my friends private server. I thought I'd just hold the one workshop  on a public server and leave some for other players who might not want to have to contest. I held on to it for a few hours before prick &amp; morty showed up though so I got my times worth
---
I swore they moved like the wind was moving it. Then again that can be my mind playing tricks on me.
---
God how I wish my online friends could join me in the commonwealth
---
Maybe in real life with nuclear particles in the air but idk hour in game
---
Upvote for Prick n Morty I'm using that!
---
You should not have let me know this was a thing. I'm about to craft 100 surface to griefer missiles in preparation of bullys
---
To throw some gas on the flames....all of the decent gear I have has come from 3 star legendaries in Whitesprings with the exception of 1 good combat shotgun in Uranium event.
---
I don't even bother with the Purveyor except to get modules now.  I can't stomach getting another assassin or nocturnal broadsider to eat my stash space until I can offload the POS for half the scrip price.
---
I did not need the visual now stuck in my head of a console suddenly pooping.  How would that even work - it haunts me.  I may never try to stick a disc in mine again....
---
Let us know if it worked. I had this problem but in a different game, and it helped in my situation.
---
Then again. Think I have answered my own answer. Cause the circle stays where it was set at. Going back to my corner now.
---
I usually scrip all the 1 and 2 star first. I can clear a lot more inventory that way. I've been using my scrip for legendary modules though, so not as many 3 star as I used to have.
---
But then it looks like you have plastic flamingoes set up.
---
Thanks,  am on pc.
---
they did mess up the Raider Marauder paint and the Settler Vigilante paints as a part of the "Deluxe" bundle. they did cause you to take way more rads then expected. try it again with another paint to see if that is the case.
---
What if... what if Bethesda produced a game that was already complete? No DLC, no subscription, no connection required to play. Just  a really big fat awesome mess to play in? Wouldn't that blow your mind?
---
I think the reddit group is probably not an accurate cross-section of the FO76 player base.  I don't think you can really judge the full picture of player satisfaction based on social media platforms.....
---
....but hey, I could be wrong about that.
---
Yep, same issue. Shame, I wanted to fill Rocco with lead and then be able to collect gold bullion with this character.
---
Oh fuck yeah. After a fee runs its really easy
---
You mongrel
---
Same.  5 times in one hour on patch release day.  Not as much the last few days, but it's still worse than normal.  It's especially great while in a public event with 1 minute left before completion.
---
Update, definitely had to redo my camp. Luckily my camp isnt overly complex and it was able to go back where it was with blueprints more or less. We need to get the word out to not use that skin.
---

Ah, kids these days with their "it's only 800!"

Had back to back SBQ runs tonight and no joke, both times a 1\* golf club dropped...I couldn't help but laugh at the second drop.

I just wish it didn't have the big steel thing on the top.
---
Mike Ness is a god.
---
Ah thank you friend
---
Ah thanks bruv
---
None.
---
Yup. That’s 10000% it, just made another post about it. Thanks, what a fuckin joke man
---
How is this possible? Stalkers?
---
This is true, Id feel good about grinding 10,000 ghouls of I got something cool like a legendary severed ghoul arm melee weapon or that ghoul chair from nuka world
---
It probably has to do somthing with scraping stuff get rid of it forever. How long should a respawn timer be set? 1 day? Fee hours? 
---
I'd much rather be able to run up to the tree in workshop mode and highlight the tree and have a hide option that way it won't affect the server and have it linked to you when you do it and when your camo is gone from there (log off/move camp)
---
BB you're a genius. Thank you. Have some bottle caps on me.
---
This is actually my favorite glitch in the game - I wish it would stay.
---
Well peaceful punctuated with abject horror as you run away from monsters but most locations had way less enemies in general or at least it seems like it. Also you could make your camp in spots you cant anymore
---
Can you post a video on this please? For me, with T65, it is the same rad as before, without skin.
---
Also, in the tunels, in skinless T65, I always got 10+ rads. Nukezones 2 rads.
---
Ah, I never played Fallout 1 so I'm not fully aware of the Maxsons and who did what to who
---
I have an ungodly amount of masks that I’m holding onto as well. I’ve been putting a full (or full adjacent since I ran out of the rare ones) in my shop for 1 cap a mask. Someone comes along, picks up the one they don’t have, and I replace it. Slow going... but we’re getting somewhere.
---
Oooohhhhhhhh
---
I didn’t know about that little “exploit” as it’ll soon be branded and then patched.
---
I fast travelled to join Breach and Clear, arrived as it was ending and got an explosive troubleshooter Fixer six hours ago.
---
Had to do nothing, it was free. But I won't keep it because I have a Handmade with the same effects + reduced weight. 
---
Have room for one fixer only and already got a furious faster fire from the purveyor.
---
Just because you haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
---
Will do right now, give me a moment

Those two concepts are not the same nor dependent on each other.

They aren't, but they should be

While your delivery is completely horrendous and condescending and you sound like an insufferable douchenozzle, you are not actually wrong.

You make my head hurt..... ;)
---
Frames increase strength to 15, if your str is already there it does nothing for you. There are leg mods to improve carry weight as well.
---
Break into bethesda. Charge them for your professional /u/fivefivefives removal service.

If you were on Xbox and posted this earlier I would have come killed them with you
---
No problem I was either drunk or high and couldn't convey my thoughts into the proper context to avoid misunderstandings and downvotes. That'll teach me lol
---
That boxing glove sounds worth it and thanks for the advice
---
Ahhh i see it now, there is a staple or zip tie real close to the letter, it was confusing me. Thanks for the info!
---
yeah but almost two years to fix problems highlighted since day one?
---
Gotta be able to see the stuff at the atom shop
---
Buggier, too
---
Also, did you take into consideration any backpacks you have on you? Those "unequip" while in PA
---
Especially your frame rate.
---
Pie
---
thanks you make some good points. Hello games did a pretty decent job and giving content updates that r let meaningful. Thats part of how they gained their support base back. That and actually caring about fixes and patches in general. They weren't limited to this once a month bs
---
I’ve found a work around you literally lay there for about ten minutes and then it will let you spawn again. So it only bugs out if you die right when the event ends. I’ve posted this after I did encrypted and I was like hell no I’m not losing loot again.
---
I really don't understand why it doesn't just boost your strength by like five on its own. Makes it equally powerful regardless of strength, rather than super overpowered at strength one and useless at strength 15+.
---
Douchenozzle?... Im changing my gamertag as soon as I get home from work. "Workshop claimed by Douchenozzle"... I like it :)
---
Definitely. I just feel like it’s been so long since launch and Bethesda’s got very little to show for it.
---
I actually rarely wear backpacks. They ruin my outfits, and I don't want to be dependent on them.
---
Yea I wondered this myself, didn’t make a whole lot of sense to me.
---
I give about 2-300 for free to anyone that buys a modded.44 from me. Crafting/Sales build. I have mods that low level players cant get yet. So in exchange for the junk used to mod it, plus a little extra for my own profit, they'll get a decent weapon and extra ammo.
---
It's a black balaclava. You can very rarely find Crater raiders wearing it.
---
What the other guy said. All equipped backpacks and armor automatically unequip in PA. So if you are wearing armor with weight reduction perks, or strength perks, you lose those perks once you put PA on.
---
LOL did you have to be wearing that outfit??😄
---
I always thought power armor and a high strength build would go together, but it seems I've chosen poorly.
---
So sticking with my X-01 because I love how it looks and shows my loyalty to the Enclave isn't significantly hobbling me?
---
I use .44 for low level enemies. It kills most things level 20 and under in one shot, even if you're not specialized in handguns. This frees up ammunition of other calibers to use in tougher enemies. It replaced .38 as my fodder killer  I chambered a nocturnal combat rifle in .38, and it does a surprising amount of damage when the sun goes down.
---
Oof! Not a long time to wait but when that camera starts spinning, time stops! 😂 I'll keep that one in mind!
---
any vampire heavy gun would help
---
I think this game as a whole is a pretty solid mmo. It's a shame that ppl get so caught up in expectations that they can't enjoy what it is. And I know that to the herd mentality it's an "unplayable dumpster fire" but the truth is that 76 holds itself better then a lot of games.
---
The rewards from the event are the shit on the plate. The boxes during individual drops are just warm piss.
---
Fixed it for you!
---
I can not deny I would chortle if I saw that......
---
Happened to me yesterday during line in the sand
---
I get what you're asking; I was wondering that myself because I'm considering moving my camp and I want to know if it's gonna get regularly blasted on the spot I'm looking at. I don't see any "grid" to measure on the map screen, so here's my dumb MacGyver-ed answer. Find a world that's had a nuke dropped (unless you want to do it yourself), grab a piece of paper, slap it on the screen, mark off the nuke zone, move paper to where Monogah is and see if your camp is close enough to get nuked. Like I said, dumb, but it might work.
---
This. All the time. They'll say you believe in magic. But I got my full ss armor this way.
---
I am aware of that, this is why I mentioned my Pocketed armor. Kinda strange that a literal piece of wood or singular strap of leather boots my weight more than power armor.
---
Got me the first time and every other time since then lol
---
Yeah it sucks but after that time I have had it happen again during that event and once fighting the queen. But got lucky with the queen being when you die if you don’t stash your flux you get it will just disappear but when I went down and spun for ten minutes when I got to respawn the event loot didn’t pop up until I came back so I still got it. It sucks but at least now you know you don’t gotta leave server or anything
---
I do hate when this happens, and its a shit show for the people that arent tis shitty. Hope the rest of your interactions dont lead you to believe many are like this.
---
I put 26k steel into it and got 104 boxes from it, 2 new plants and about 6k caps, will be getting rid of my other resources because why not
---
Unfortunately, that's not useful data for the question being debated.
---
If the hypothesis is that items run in groups, we would need every item, in order they were received, as well as marked for what group they were. So, if you made items 1-5 before server hopping, you'd mark that as group 1 and write them out individually. Preferably, also mark if you server hopped or closed out the program completely, to help determine if the proposed seed system is server based or session based.
---
This was actually one of the big failings of that previous attempt I mentioned, they gathered the data but not in sufficient detail to actually be useful. The second failing was that, when the evidence generated did not match their hypothesis, they then did what you did and tallied the item types in total rather then by session (if they ever did it by session, I never saw it). Even then their hypothesis was supported by just barely over half the data set, the other half they disregarded as "a fluke" when they presented their findings.
---
What's more, we'd need truly significant data collection. The other fellow did well on that, gathered several hundred items, but again, their data was not complete enough to be genuinely useful.
---
The amount of work needed to prove or disprove this hypothesis is staggering, with no payout beyond "I told you so"s, so this question will almost never be answered unless someone finds the actual code that determines it... which is almost certainly server side. We could check Fallout 4's code... but it is likely different because of the changes they had to make to turn this into a server based online game. So instead, we'll debate and argue ad nauseaum, as redditors the world over are wont to do.
---
Pepperidge Farm also knows what you did...
---
hmm... not a bad idea. slight difference, but i see how that can open up more room. players helping players, woot!
---
1.big brain
---
2. Sorry idk how to help u
---
I get it but treating them like idiots isn't going to help the situation dude
---
I thought the exact same thing lol
---
Oh man.... You just gave me the greatest Idea, Rename my gamertag to Douchenozzle, only create "roleplaying" public teams and actively speak with an Austrian accent. Haha
---
Seen this post a few times today
---
What kind of build are you going for? Just curious. I attempted a heavy gunner power armor build recently and abandoned it for bloodied because I found the power armor half of the build too weak and constantly over encumbered.
---
Thanks
---
Whitespring bots.
---
Seriously how is nobody talking about this
---
I think it was both, bundle and separate..it will swing around again eventually like most things in the Atom shop..I want the giant Nuka Cola display bottles 👍
---
There's no fix for it at all?
---
I don't really have a particular build besides a "carry as much as humanly possible" kind. Really makes this an issue
---
My camp isn't near whitesprings, it's on a resource node.
---
It’s part of the freakin game, i think it would’ve been a cool experience and a lesson for op
---
Everyone wants this, but Bethesda don't know how to do simple things that would actually improve the game and make it more fun. They don't want that type of stuff. 
---
As much as I enjoy this game I also see so many simple fixes that could've improved it vastly. 
---
I feel the developers truly lack imagination.
---
It might!
---
No, no he’s not.
---
He doesn’t want diluted reskinned Christmas presents as a “reward.” That is quite frankly extremely insulting to the veterans who play this game.
---
Go bloodied in that case. Get a full set of unyielding armor, drop power armor. Max out strength. Take herd mentality and stay on teams. Your carry weight should stay around 450-470.
---
I got full 3* ss armor by doing this: first I waited till I see a lobby where you get an unyielding piece. It can be your friend getting this piece. This will ensure there's a possibility you get that effect. When I went to crafting my first chest piece, I got it using 5 modules. For the right hand I put like 10 modules once with no luck. All this by getting an unyielding piece drop first in that server. Then when I got the left arm I would try the same but crafting both pieces at once that got me 3 pieces in 10 tries. Then the same process repeated for the legs. It seemed to me that it is easier to get the effect on crafting legendaries if you switch between pieces or weapons. But this also applies to the purveyor. You also get somekind of limited weapon pool and thats why you probably get to see the same weapon drop twice with different effect in the same server. It's better to believe it will keep you stronger.
---
I would call that commando
---
https://imgur.com/a/af4RwSb
---
Here you are!
---
And I would pay to see that.  Let me know when you start your new career as a game streamer.
---
Not yet, this most recent patch they ‘made the quest less confusing’ by only needing one sample instead of three, but it seems that you still need three to progress however you can only loot one. Your best bet is to log a ticket and hope for the best... F
---
Haha :)
---
I just built the jetpack chest piece today. I logged in a few minutes ago and started to freak out, thinking I somehow lost it. Glad to know it's just a visual bug.
---
I like the idea of the robot doing it, rather than collect, it could repair your base
---
Haha, pc master race go brrrrr.  But for real sorry about your ps4 dude.
---
The "lesson" to keep junk out of inventory and that people will be dicks? I dont think that is well justified.
---
Lol, this is bugged as hell.
---
Send this to Bethesda and ask a refund. And they will fix it in... 2-3 months. Thanks for posting.
---
I don't know about the beta, but it was 400 at launch.
---
“Kafuckingboom” definitely my new favourite word lol... here, have an upvote sir for your mastery of English slang
---
Preach it!
---
No they are character locked.
---
They want you to be doing dailies not weeklies.  I like your idea but from an engagement metric it’s not going to fly.
---
Yep, no problem. I’m trying to get a new password but the Bethesda site doesn’t seem to want to send me a new one.
---
Rose’s section of Top of the World has a decent supply too that I don’t think a lot of people know about.
---
I've thought about it, but it's gonna take a while to get my perks right
---
They’re always stealing. Take Fallout 3 and 4, those techno religious nutjobs are pillaging left right and centre.
---
Just a personal plaque with how much you donated
---
Right here🤚 IMO it’s a solid build for FO76 veterans or anyone who’s sick of the same build, routine and armor
---
That’s actually a good idea if it were instanced
---
Is there? I’ve pretty much been doing the same shit since before wastelanders, pushed off doing the final vault raid for awhile cause it didn’t seem to be worth doing at all.
---
I’m still laughing at this.... hoovered up my shit in a second this mofo had it down... this I why I spend hours browsing reddit and forget to feed my kids and the goldfish lol
---
Damn bruh ur perception must be like 1000 irl. I’m so foolish and trusting i probably would just take it out. Props to you
---
Gimme yose Discord.
---
He doesn’t want diluted reskinned Christmas presents as a sprinkle of warm piss on top of the steaming pile of shit that is the community reward.
---
So far I've completed every weekly, only fully skipped 1 day and done all dailies except the level up one every day (that one I do every other day). I'll hit 100, but only barely. The schedule is too strict, and the increased exp needed for each level is bs. I don't want to engage with a system tuned anywhere near as harsh as this again.
---
Might have to download the game again.
---
Ye happens to me too in some matches flibbity but I find that others around me load in quicker and get the loot before I’m even in the match
---
Is worth a pound of cure
---
Bethesda likes spending money on cure in pounds
---
Bethesda doesn't offer 2 factor =)
---
This is a bug that resets upon relog, happens when first replacing beds I believe.
---
Mm.. damn fine screenshot
---
Unfortunately we can’t. Bethesda will never allow that to happen. They seem to think sprinkling warm piss on a plate of shit is acceptable. The people donating are just reinforcing that message.
---
Good looking out. I got mine.
---
Yup. This is possibly the only nice change with that patch. I've gotten a gauss minigun from the queen and some secret service armor elsewhere. It's really nice having this added to the event drop pool.
---
Pendejo, if you want to be super realistic then play 4 with realism mods, see how you like that, having to constantly be over encumbered, having only like 150-200 lbs of carry weight (realistic) die in one shot to the head, see how much fun you have.
---
It always works at whitespring station for me on the suitcases, i did it today
---
Dude you just made me want to play again. I've been unable to use the favorites menu for about 5 months now, and everytime i looked up a fix nothing was found. I also contacted Bethesda and they didn't even respond. I dropped my notes and holotapes, boom its fixed. Thank you so much!!!
---
Yeah it sucked for me.. I went full build on the PA/HG build. Found it to be much weaker than expected. And spent about a week and half grinding xp to get enough perk points to change the build without scrapping it entirely. But now it’s considerably more powerful and my carry weight is up by 120 pounds, plus a high capacity backpack.
---
What I don't understand about this whole thing is why they won't just ask us for help. We have a huge and dedicated community, tons of us have Bethesda spaghetti code and modding experience. Ask for volunteers, chuck some Atoms and a unique cosmetic item their way, and watch the bugs get squashed.
---
How on Earth does a cosmetic of all things cause this?
---
Pool staff... those truly on the front line of the leisure industry... have an upvote to relieve your dookie based PTSD
---
~15 hours ago I transferred 100k 556 and 100k .45 to a mule using my private world on xbox.
---
thanks for the heads up. 
---
side note: those 200k combined are exactly 800 pounds in the stash
---
Yep happened to me too. I transfer scrip between 5 characters on a daily basis and very rarely had an issue. Yesterday it worked the first time but i lost everything on the next two attempts. No server crashes or anything. Very strange
---
I do and it does help.   You mentioned you play with your wife.  Is it possible for each of you to spare a couple of character slots to dump your extra stuff on?
---
Yeah found it thanks for the reminder...much better although it's a bitch in the grass hahaha ✌️
---
Yes people will be dicks in a wasteland, especially if they’ve something to gain from it
---
Right? Fuck if I know. Really tired of this shit though. Already canceled my FO1st subscription a few days ago. Glad I did now
---
And raise cap limits to 50k lol
---
99 percent of the player base has been amazing the most friendly bunch I've come across in gaming. I can deal with a few bored high level trolls once in a while :)
---
Oh, I thought you wanted to compare, Haha. Idk I had one south of TOTW, no defenses.
---
if they want to make it worthwile, they’ve gotta add some pail plans AT MINIMUM. Who knows, maybe they could add some new skins but it’s bethesda so idk
---
Anti armor is nice on pistols because there's no perk for it like there is for other weapons. Two shot isn't great the second shot misses a fair amount and the secondary damage from the second shot is low.
---
Yeah I wanted to fill my 4th display slot with one of the crates next to the christmas ones.
---
Now I get to tell the story of how I survived a raider ambush party with all my junk lol
---
Good catch they weren't there Tuesday when I checked.
---
That makes sense, thanks. 
---
Stupid PCs.
---
If thats the case, and I say that as someone that has more than,3000 hours of my life playing FO games and as a True FO fan, they can Go To F....
---
I mean, the coding for doing it is allmost allready in the game with display cases/vendor machines.
---
And if they consider its a feature that us, FO1st members have, well, its not if its not a 100% secure and they dont want to do anything about it
---
Yep, got stung by this last night. No idea what changed but lost all the scrip i was transferring between characters. No disconnects at all, the container was just empty when i reloaded into the world. This sucks as I'm constantly moving stuff between characters like this
---
Glad I could help! Was a total game changer for me when I finally stopped hoarding. I went from hitting enemies 10 times before damage registered and constantly dying, to a much smoother experience where I wasn’t constantly frustrated lol
---
Which is ironic becasue in game my perception is 2 lol
---
Oh.  I meant I wanted to hear people's opinion on the subject in general.
---
Just start dropping all the scrap ones you dont want. And since your farming ss armor iv gota ask. Do you feel as if they get created in a pattern of first you get a 3*, then a 2*, to a 1*, then back around to a 3*?
---
Same.... a 100%
---
But we were having a discussion on another thread that FO76 isnt an MMO.... How can it be when it lacks allxthe basic features of the genre ?
---
Switch to heavy weapons and focus on Gatling Lasers and Ultracite Gatling Lasers. Stabilized in INT makes heavy weapons amazing, and Power User in INT doubles Fusion Core duration for PA and Gatlings, so each core is 999 shots.
---
Not all of us are like that mate, trust me! I’ll buy your valuable junk next time you’re on ;)
---
Now that's my type of fan *thumbs up* :)
---
I used to be able to do this easily enough with my melee character using a black powder rifle. Then it got worse to the point where I had less time and had to use a gatling laser or plasma. I was farming them to give to people I had repeatedly run into that very very often launched back to back nukes. As melee, I struggled too much against the turrets to try run silos myself, so I thought I'd try and do the legwork for the keycards at least..
---
Now it is even worse to the point where I don't bother. If you can't take it out in one or two shots... They fly so fast that you can't catch them, and so high that you can't reach them even when you fast travel ahead to intercept it and get to a high-point before it arrives. The fact that sometimes you have to take off 2/3 of their health before you can target them in VATS and then *still* they will spontaneously heal faster than your damage reduced by distance dropoff can possibly take them down.
---
This should get some attention *before* A Colossal Problem necessitates getting nuke cards even more.
---
Copied to official boards for more awareness.

Why is it Billy anyway? Is it acknowledging that the Doom marine is related to BJ Blazkowicz?
---
A bit of junk? Getting one over on a low level character? Sounds like a small Dick issue. Best you can hope for is stable flux, and even then it isnt even something worth fighting each other for. I have given away full sets of power armor, toms of legendary weapons and armor and more junk than I can count. Not just to low levels, but people higher level than I simply because i have enough and they were nice. People being dicks is just people being dicks, and that just is as stupid as it gets with how little there is to gain from it.
---
And man, I just realized that even TESO has a shared bank lol. 
---
That just shows how lazy they are
---
They pushed a hotfix at 3:00pm EST today. If it was around that time then that was the reason it switched you into a new server.
---
Get as far as u can and the last day buy tiers
---
 Do your second idea. Get as much as you can during the run, and then buy the ranks that you need to get the rewards you want. I believe there is about 25-30 days left. You should be able to easily get to 50 or 60 in that time if you play a least a little bit most days.
---
ThE sErVeRs WiLl Be PuT uNdEr ToO mUcH sTrAiN

I do run two accounts on two xbox at same time. It's worth it (9 mules) 270k caps,tons of room for tons of stuff, and safe xfer when needed
---
Enough to have multiple of every dense plan, several grenade plans, and enough PA plans to have every set craftable on two characters with multiple extras of many pieces. Farming was inefficient, so I spent several hundred thousand caps on wrapping paper. Didn't do it much for the treasure hunting event since they took too much junk to craft for me to think it was worth it, which is why I only managed to get one of each of the new plans and a couple extra of the new outfit plans. I was planning on dropping close to 100000 scrap over the course of this event to try and get more, but Bethesda decided to nerf the rewards so now I won't because I have everything already. He'll, you can't even get most of the PA mod plans because Bethesda fucked it up as usual.
---
There are 100 tiers correct?
---
Are tiers 150 atoms each regardless of what rank you are?
---
That was me LOL. I been doing it for Halloween foreshadowing XD
---
Yeah, I feel you on that one, I land in a somewhat popular spot in Morgantown, so it sucks when someone loads in and take all the loot then I’m screwed
---
Calibrated shocks on the legs will give you some more carry weight, but honestly as a heavy gunner on my main I'm usually overweight in PA so I only equip it for harder fights
---
I would definitely send that to Bethesda that's ridiculous
---
I just did it like an hour ago and it worked perfectly fine. It has always been a risk. Even though I've only lost about 1% of my transfers, I *always* treat it as if there's a 40% chance of loss.
---
I believe so. So get as far as u can and buy at the end if u need to
---
It's better when 2 people take your workshop and you are shouting at them for being hackers because you are doing no damage and later on you remember you have pacifist mode on 😂😂😂
---
I didn't even think to check, because it just said it was the head, and I was running around with a sheepsquatch mascot outfit anyway. Thanks for pointing this out.
---
Nocturnals
---
I havent used it since the update and frankly stories like this are why I won't. 
---
I feel for you, it's sad they can't get this right.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/htmlview
---
That’s where u should be so a hard grind u might catch up
---
You need to speed up, you might reach 50 or 60, so buying the rest is at least about 6000 atoms, that isn't cheap
---
Yeah gonna have to if it’s not working by tomorrow, thanks!
---
Yep, lost 450 scrip in the ice box outside the rusty pick whilst transferring between mule on a private server. No server disconnects, just an empty container
---
I didn't notice a pattern.
---
I would do 5 left leg then 5 right and then check to see what I got.  
---
I don't want to just drop the legendaries.  I'm on vacation now and playing more,  once I go back to work I can cash in more than I collect.  Just looking for quicker route
---
I have mostly 3 star legs left and on top of that all the legendary gear from quests/events has been 3 star lately.
---
Been unloading what is heaviest each day but I have alot of 3 stars that are half a pound or less that are 40 scrip each
---
Unfortunately there no good multiplayer coming out anytime soon
---
They lied.
---
Edit: or the intern fu$&amp;ed up again.
---
Is there a trick to this? I put a flamingo over a fallen tree to make it vanish but when I relogged it was visible again.
---
Was it guns and we're there npcs nearby? I used the moonshine hut and caught the npcs with my weapons.
---
It’s really difficult to put stock in this without at least a bit more information? No timeframe, so one could even assume stuff might not even be released until instanced camps. It’s such a significant part of the fo76 community and it’s a bit ironic that so much was removed after starting a feature hashtag. 
---
You make so much profit off the camp community and the consistent atom purchases, so it’s disheartening to see a kind of post that kind of empathizes but not really, and blames exploiters for server breakage when we all know it’s hackers doing it.
---
It ends September 7th, so you have 33 days to get as far as you can before you need to buy with Atoms.
---
calibrated shocks will give you +50 carry weight per leg and if you use a full set of excavator armour you get a +100 carry weight bonus too
---
Np and good luck!
---
I've run into that one of the three stooge errors many times trying to build a workshop-and-drop base.
---
It's something you've put inside. Usually it's something you've put on the wall, or a wire. In my most recent one, it was a flag I had on the inside wall of the train car for example.
---
What I do is take a workshop. Use it's mats to make a bare bones one. Blueprint it. Make sure I can place it. If I can, add some things, blueprint it and see if I can place it again. Repeat until done. It's a lot more work, but it makes it easier to track down the annoying trouble maker.
---
Because they're not in game/available.
---
I don't really care much about xp but them screws... lol. Where does the mega sloth usually spawn. I know theres a grafton monster near the water park that will spawn everytime
---
125 million is a lot to get, especially when the rewards aren’t amazing. Supposed Purveyor super sale? now that’s something to look forward to.
---
I’d love this, and a “journal” that compiled all the random papers we find. We had that back in RPGs 20-30 years ago, why not now? 😩
---
Good deal my friend
---
Yes they will disappear although idk if it will let you apply them to the display shelf if you do go ahead and give it a try
---
I'm pretty sure what was auto-completing challenges for me was being logged in as they reset at 12.  I log out at 11:55 then back on at 12:05 on the mornings I play &amp; it hasn't happened since.
---
Do all your dailys and weeklys, may be a double score xp weekend ahead yet. Once dailys are done work on easy Atom challenges. The pictures ones are easy peasy. See what's left at the end and buy w.e ranks you need yet. To answer another question: yes all ranks are a flat 150 Atoms.
---
did that to some trees, but trees just come back next server.. with the item in the tree
---
They're all too tiny,like kid's beds. I can't stand any of them and will never buy any ,untill they make one bigger.
---
Pita who's that
---
Yeah I wasn't sure if it was just me or if it was actually an issue for others too. I don't mind doing the quest for the card but I definitely don't want it to be an extreme sport. 
---
Hopefully they know about it and they fix it if it's not how the drone is supposed to behave.
---
I mostly stopped caring about how games look but did you have 4K resolution in 2010 though?
---
If you dont mind me asking what platform are you on? I'm on Xbonex and I've been using this skin on T51 and haven't noticed any issues
---
what does this even mean?
---
They completely destroyed framerate around meat piles. IDK what they changed but it needs undone ASAP along with adding in the SS armors they claimed were in the patch.
---
Each patch just seems like a folly of errors, changes no one asked for, "improvements" that show they don't even play.
---
Take out the escorts without hitting the carrier., it'll fly in circles then. Have no issue taking it out, took one down last night with gauss shotgun, usually use minigun.
---
Nope. We sure can’t. Sorry!
---
Yes. The opponents ship is marking time. It moves once per day, and it will get to 100 at the end of the run. So you can count back from 100 to see how many days there are left.
---
Good examples: (Xbox)
---
| Yoshi V12 | (lvl unknown)
---
OP Chainsawed a level 10 and a level 8 at the Race Track, then had the nerve too tell them too join his squad and maybe that won't happen again. 522 comments on that vid, each one more trashier then the other. 
---
Angry Spartan21 (lvl 312)
---
PvP at Abandoned Bog Town, a level 46. 46, has no OP Weapons only a Pump Action Shotgun. Spart comes in, blows 46 away with an EE FFR Handmade. 46 lost all of his loot, and wasn't even close too fully taking the workshop.
---
AliveDeathgod (lvl 160)
---
Tried to PvP me (lvl 32 at the time) and a Newbie (lvl 15) at the Race Track. Took him out about 4-5 times, melee only. He left, we started building defenses. He got killed by our turrets twice. Then came in guns blazing with either a Bloodied E or 2Shot E Minigun. Took me out 5 times, kept hiding up top, couldn't get a hit in. Newbie gave up after his 2nd death (don't blame him).
---
There's more I bet.
---
Thanks for posting. Shortly after reading I got a bloody gat laser drop and quickly hopped to camp to make some gauss shottys. 4th or 5th craft was bloody limb reload speed!
---
..... time to grind and get my atoms ready on the side. Probably wasn’t a good idea to get the nuka  cola Bundle...
---
Don't worry! Found it 😬

~~Do you have a link to some more info on that that you could please give me? Unrelated, but I just did Line In The Sand by myself and had no problems with the meat piles lowering my frame rate into the abyss, so either it was part of that fix or it is maybe something worth reporting.~~
---
Look at the world challenges. Unless you’ve grinder those previously there lots that are really easy to get for atoms

👍🏽
---
I had the same issue today. Whenever I tried putting the fuse first it wouldn't let me analyze the sample. Finally I tried logging off and back on again and tried the analysis before putting the fuse and it worked.
---
I’ve got the excavator for mining lead etc, but it’s a bit too squishy for combat so I use an almost full set of t51b armour. I guess I’m just stuck using it during battle.
---
Just give the BoS the Kardashians, that’ll do them for plastic.
---
My pistol build keeps getting decent to god roll heavy weapons... One bloodied pistol and its gamma gun
---
Ok I'm stealing surface to griefer
---
No problem, PS4!
---
Well, funnily enough, she does have FO1st, and keeps telling me to just give her stuff. For some reason I feel weird about that, so I don't.
---
So yeah, I could use her scrap box, we could both have alt characters. I may start doing both, we'll see.
---
Which challenges do you recommend?
---
Bro they are fucking trolls they be doing this shit on purpose
---
Was it even a mod to scrap trees and junk piles in your settlements? I distinctly remember just being able to do then, then when i started play 76 recently i was confused because i couldnt remove a stump. I find if i put something small (usually a blackberry bush or somthing) in its spot it goes away
---
Bloody hell, is this the same shit as the Settler PA again? FFS Bethesda, fix how you apply those power armor benefits.
---
Fallout steals my junk reddit steals my jokes 😔
---
big sigh....
---
Yep, they are pushing away their entire user base and being completely ignorant to what the community wants.
---
Lol I can’t answer that. Go to world map. Push right on the Dpad to bring up daily’s and weeklys and all the other category’s below those give atoms as rewards. Have a look and I’m sure you’ll see plenty you can achieve quite easily
---
That's hilarious
---
Yep. No change.
---
Think of it as a compliment not plagiarism
---
Have you tried using a shotgun with Enforcer to cripple its engines? That should slow it drastically, and if cripple all of em, it stops moving entirely, if I’m not mistaken.
---
Gotcha maybe it’s just me then
---
Yeah, but I'd rather not take twice as long after hitting the small cap of 2,000 points to go buy 5.56 or 5mm.
---
I just did Line In The Sand solo and didn't have this issue in the slightest, whereas every other time in the last day or two when there have been other players around I *definitely* had a huge problem with it.
---
Wondering if it is another iteration of the respawn bug at events, which is fixed and you can respawn as normal as soon as most other players leave the area.
---
I'll try solo again later if possible, cos atm this is just anecdotal. But even so, I still thought it was worth mentioning!
---
It's only my opinion, but I'm not sure the rewards are worth spending real-world money (via atoms).  Just grind for the next month to see what you get then decide whether to spend atoms.  Personally I'd save them for the Atom Shop.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I really like the backpack
---
You’d think after a scrap junk / natural mod being at the top of mod sites for years, they would make it implemented into the game, but guess not.
---
As a plus to what I said earlier, 2 reasons why I think that Bethesda should/could do some shared space in storage :
---
First, they made the communication allmost nearly impossible in an easy way, so its really hard to find someone to trust to help you transfering items. For at least this reason, a text chat should be a thing, even though I understand that they would.need People to deal with toxicity 
---
Second, their ither MMO have a full shared stash.
---
Currencies are shared in TESO, which avoids one thing that happens to me on a regular basis :  finding an item in a vending machine and not being able to buy it because Im on my poor character,
---
Crafting Materials are shared too. And thats cool because its really boring to have to transfer sncrews constantly depending on which character you need to craft weapon with
---
All the storage stash is shared between all characters of the account which should.be a thing in a game where there are no classes and.you need to transfer weapons to character who can uses it.
---
And there are even some ways to reuse existing technology in the game (vending machine) which let you implement this system without any impact on the stash limit because it would still be an item in your stash, just shared as transférable. Or maybe just implementing a transfer machine as a camp item, working exactly the same as a vending machine but accessible only to characters of the account
---
Better yet use the vendor/container interface like we all thought it would
---
Them knowing about it and them fixing it are two *hugely* different things. 😂
---
Mole rats digging them in
---
Nahh this is why I posted this. I've done it tonnes of times and taking out the escorts used to stop it but prior to posting this it took off before I even fired at the escorts, so I never even destroyed them. Has happened every time I have done the quest the last few weeks.
---
I need a pc
---
And that is one masterfully written master piece of a subreddit post I have seen in a long while take a bow and grab your junk
---
This new update makes me randomly fall through the ground at least twice a day and I lose my scrap and get to reload and spend 3 minutes to fast travel like 20 meters away from my death.
---
1950??
---
The bombs fell in 2077!
---
Your "private" server isn't attached to you.  It's just whatever server happens to be empty at that time.  So, you don't get a dedicated server.  Never have.  And until they allow us to host our own private servers, you will still only get a random empty server.
---
Did you put the fuse in before you tried to run the sample analysis? If you did, log out and back in and it should prompt you to put it again, but before you do, try to run the analysis first and then put the fuse. Worked for me earlier today.
---
Thank you. I dont post often so I wanted to put some effort it
---
That's dupist!
---
Well, to be fair that was never intended to work that way. It does suck ass though but I doubt they’ll do anything since it’s not a legitimate way of transferring things.
---
I'm not a shotgun build so never carry one or have enforcer equipped, but what is happening is it takes off before I even attack it or it's escorts.
---
Many times when I play I sneakily shoot some enemy, hear the sound of them getting hit and dying, then witness them instantly re-gain their blown-off head... now quite aware of my position. And now more than a little pissed-off.   
---
Or that any enemy far far away is a Lvl 1... always. Is that meant to be like that?   
---
Does the level info load only when you're close-ish to an enemy?  
---
If this has been discussed many times before, plz excuse my ignorance. I've been playing 76 off and on from the start, but I'm new to this sub.
---
Your story stole our hearts dont act all innocent here
---
This was my experience. When I find a server with a prefix like bloodied, I stay on there as long as I can because I only get bloodied weapons to drop maybe once every 2 weeks.
---
Just a warning for console players who might think about doing this. You lose all your pictures when you delete the game
---
One major reason I rarely ever trade with those I don’t know. And definitely wouldn’t get all my junk out of my stash. Glad you caught on to that. I usually only take over workshops in private to avoid random people wanting pvp.
---
It's an exploit. So any time I come across them I pick as many locks as possible and yoink all their ammo.
---
No i put the blood in then the fuse then the terminal and i already exited the game and logged back in still didn't work. Thank tho i just sent a ticket hopefully they get back to me with useful info.
---
Ah. Hmm. That’s odd. Afraid I don’t have much advice then.
---
Exactly how Pete Hines would react.
---
It means this guy has tried to defend himself with pacifist mode on (so you dont deal outgoing damage to other players) and thought they were hacking and got angry probably until he reaslised he had pacifist on
---
I just saw free on the atomic shop and was like don’t mind if I do
---
This is not a bug/glitch/whatever. So, you don't have a valid ticket claim.  "Private world" only means that it's not public. You don't get your own, dedicated server that's tied to your account.  You get whatever empty server is there when you log in.  This is how it's always been.  It's random. If you happened to get the same server where you stored your stuff, you got lucky. That's it.
---
They fixed adrenaline, not saying it makes up for it.
---
oh
---
Yeah gotta say, the amount of effort to donate 250 steel to get 2 bottles of alcohol, some grenades I'll never use, and some plans I probably won't use either... And only maybe get something good.
---
Without fo1st I don't have a trillion saved steel scrap, I can barely save enough random junk I end up selling my damned steel for space.
---
Other than those on 1st with literal millions of steel and other mats I'll be amazed if we got the donation targets.

This set of images is invaluable for seeing what camp plans look like and what they include.  Plan titles in vendors sometimes make no sense.
---
There's one called nukecrypt or something for launch codes, but I don't like the process of setting off nukes so I don't know the exact link.  Someone else might be able to help.
---
Same shit happened tovme yesterday... and while i was transfering big items...
---
Will have to take a 2nd account then, if its the only sure solution
---
In settings you can turn pacifist mode on so you dont damage other players like in SBQ fight when it gets a bit chaotic
---
yes, yes it is.
---
Aww, give him a pat for me he looks like a good doggo
---
But like why should i spend even more money for a game thats barely at the quality of launch? It feels unfair that paying extra to tickle bethesdas ego gives you access to literal afk farms that take other players hours of fighting over or being killed by high levels

ok i will.

The confetti pile! Mother... I just got it this year. Still hadn’t thought to use that. Fookin’ genius. Any pop-in after relogging?

Yup can confirm it's still happening..every single time now when giving the photos of Crater after Patch 21 🥴...

50 is an insane number but if you know all the legendary spawn areas, I believe it.

I think my highest bloodied run was 8 over the course of 4 hours. I only get these drops every couple weeks. Most of the time I'm dropping zealots, executioner's, nocturnal, and assassin's.

Or, if you're on Xbox, just use a second account on a second console for free.  I've had a second account for years, and it is tied to my main account (they have been on the same consoles together for years). So, when I upgraded to an Xbox one x, I made it my main, and I use my regular Xbox one for my alt, and it uses FO76 under the sharing rules.
---
But, yeah. You would need a second console.
---
I'm Appalachias poster boy for brave young heros
---
Actually, if I recall correctly it makes it 11, unless your strength is already 11 or above in which case it does little to nothing for your carry weight.
---
Yeah it's funny who's reading Reddit. I made a similar post about a month ago and slaughtered my karma.
---
You’re probably right, thanks for the correction. I’ve spent less than two hours in power armor and that’s just what came to mind haha
---
Yup, I nabbed a junkie run too. This is also a prefix I rarely ever come by.

I think it collects water without rain, but the dirty water doesn’t give rads when collected, which can then boiled.

Haha I had a random player leave a Radbear in my camp at some point too, I didn’t see them do it. After some initial griefing when I was brand new 99% of players have been friendly since, even if it’s just a wave emote when you come across each other in the wilderness. I’m at the point I’m able to drop stimpaks and radaway for new players now, I wish I had the gift emote to get their attention better lol
---
They forgot to switch them on with this last update.  We were supposed to get them and probably will soon.
---
At least that was what I heard.  I also heard Todd is low on power right now and needs our tears to recharge, so they did this.... and broke some camp building tools.
---
Lucky! I keep getting legendary Fat Man’s, which suck.
---
Do you run whitesprings when it is nuked or not? I just started casually hitting it and find 1 or 2 legendary enemies... Nothing really amazing though.
---
What's the point really the only perks is the gold and the plus size power armor.  Who in the hell rendered that shit up and said that shit is nice, looks like the dam Michelin Man
---
Bethesda: adds ability to change your name
---
Game: stretches your character model and breaks 4 perks for some reason when you change your name
---
Woah this is awesome how have i never seen this before
---
Thanks dude!!
---
Unyielding cav/sentinel +1str
---
Your English is great! :D Fuck the invisible man &gt; :D
---
Let me do a better one, "Bethesda, let me get rid of my 100 duplicate keys."
---
The thing is im one of them but i prefer scaring than killing so coming out of cloak and minigun in hand i scare low levels but i give them stimpacks for forgivness
---
The hot fix has nothing to do with meat piles if you read the patch notes. How incompetent is Bethesda this is insane Lmao they not even replying to the right posts on reddit
---
Level 19 for Expert, and then level 40 for the third (Master). If you don’t get them from your perk packs, you can manually purchase them at those levels. You don’t have to raise Perception to do so, however, FYI.  But you will need at least a 3 in Perception to equip all three simultaneously.
---
If Bethesda were doing hot fixes servers go up and down all the time. Very easy for the server you leave to be reallocated immediately. Someone got a lovely present .
---
The two characters I hated were Ra Ra and Rose. I hated all of the bullshit quests she sent us on before we could talk to the Raiders and then her weird mayhem quests. All the while her cackling voice made me want to shoot a shotgun in her face to shut her up.
---
This is a solid idea as well.
---
Take all my upvotes
---
I don't accept trades.    
---
I drop stuff on the ground I don't want or am giving away or I have patience and buy from them legit through a vendor bot or that machine.
---
That's what prompted me to post this lol I was going through my keys and noticed a duplicate and it drove my OCD to unbelievable levels.
---
Power armor stats is not a significant point of interest. Better stats are better, but they are not a lot better.  The difference between the best and worst power armor is much smaller compared to normal armor, it does not make as significant difference as the numbers look like.
---
The 42% natural damage reduction does the lion's share of the work, the dr is pretty meaningless in comparison
---
Using the single hardest hitting attack in the game, a glowing super mutant behemoth's 250 damage melee hit.
---
A level 15 raider pa with it's 160 resistance will reduce the damage to \~70
---
A level 45 raider with 341 resistance will get you to \~50
---
A maxed out T-65 with it's meaty 565 will reduce it to \~45
---
That is against the attack where having the most armor makes the biggest difference, against all smaller attacks the effects are reduced significantly.
---
For a 100 damage hit (max level scorchbeasts do 95) the difference for the 3 armors breaks down to 20, 15, 13.
---
And any shared perks, buffs, or damage resistances reduce the effects even more.
---
So yes the armor has better stats, and does make an improvement over other things, but the difference is not so significant because the biggest factors in making you tanky in power armor are shared by all armor types, and make the differences that exist only a secondary factor.
---
If you take the blocker perk, which is one of the best for defense, you make it almost irrelevant what power armor you wear because there is almost 75% of the melee damage removed before the armor even factors, and when calculated out the diminishing returns hit more than twice as severe for the higher tier armors.
---
It's better than the others, but the difference between any other good set like ultracite or t-51 is not so big as to make a huge difference. And even the humble level 15 raider armor that is the first power armor you can get your hands on makes it so you can take on the toughest enemies and shrug off over 3/4 of their damage.
---
Thank you for the story.
---
I agree with you. PvP is to be expected at a workshop but it takes something extra special to bait a low level player into pulling all their valuables out so it's all at risk. Although 45 isn't a low level player, it is possibly someone that might still be new enough to not know how loot drop works.
---
I had one workshop interaction that was the opposite. I was around lvl 25ish, but on an alt character. The high level player came up and helped me defend the shop. He hung around so I immediately placed down the stash box and placed my junk in it. He came up to it and I presume did the same. Then he pulled out his weapon, waited few seconds, as if to say "are you ready," I waved pulled my gun and then he sent me to Vault-Tec Valhalla.
---
Did the Appalachian Brotherhood and Appalachian Enclave interact at all? I imagine the Enclave is aware of the Brotherhood, although they’re not mentioned anywhere in terminals or by MODUS, suggesting they weren’t considered particularly problematic or worth discussing.
---
Lvl 100 is a new player by todays standards, alot of them leveled during double exp weekend
---
I’ll take that bargain.
---
I've had this running glitch from the start that after a few weeks a bunch of my photos disappear, so I guess that wasn't really something I noticed the one time I reinstalled.   But thanks for the heads up!
---
When 2-shot was really twice the damage, and you could stack Explosive Bobbleheads. TSE Dragons were ultra-OP.
---
I got a bunch of trash but i did get a great gauss rifle in that sale. A -90% weight, ignore 50% enemy armor, +50% limb damage
---
Same here. I have the calibrated shocks on my excavator so I can carry a lot.  
---
I’m one violet flux away from both legs of my t-65 having calibrated shocks.
---
But for the most part I fast travel without PA. I switch my perks for damage during big fights and then switch them back for carry weigh QoL after.
---
I play on PC, and in my experience nobody buys anything from player vendors on PC (presumably because of all the hack/cheat programs that exist).
---
So that just leaves the daily 1400 caps from bots, but that still takes 2 weeks to accrue 20k caps. Two weeks for one serum is still one hell of a grind.
---
 [FED76](https://fed76.info/) and [Nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/home)
---
I always buy 308 ammo for lmg, its not easy to make, even with flux
---
Lol he sent you to the great vault in the sky. That sounds wholesome and I would have preferred that exprience haha. I only really caught on when he said take ALL your junk out. I was thinking well that dont sound like something I'm going to enjoy. I'm thankful I wised up as loosing my life savings of junk probably would have made me log off in sadness
---
Working fine for me, I can only suggest the usual, scrap and replace it, try it on a different server etc. Sucks that its giving you flares, the most worthless ammo in the wasteland as far as I can tell.
---
You can't be nappy about that surely...
---
ThTs unlike Bethesda to screw up. Usually so reliable
---
To be honest I was kinda laughing too when it happened. This guy was so on the ball. He must've recognized the desperate sprint of a man who wanted his scorchbeast bones and sloth screws back and was like "I will have that". And damn it, sir, you did.
---
Oh, thats why we get 3 Star legenrdary Pitchfork's as "reward" ;D
---
It is important to note you'll never get the perfect roll for all pieces before this game shuts down
---
Two shot is a mediocre prefix
---
Thank you! I agree completely.
---
You are right, I didn't want to offend you. What you said is the only workaround right now, but we have to complain about this. Because it's just a workaround for a bad game design at player vendors. Trading in general could need an improvement in general. There are to many bugs and Problems. The reason I have to use couriers is just another workaround for a bad game design... If nobody complains nothing will change. Maybe it won't change anyway but we have to if we are not happy with the current situation
---
Try r/fallout76factions
---
&gt; Vault-Tec Valhalla
---
Like a vault where people just chill and mind their own business until the doors open for the ~~Ragnarok~~ reclamation day?
---
Sounds familiar ..
---
Haha! xD
---
He has the most Super Bowl wins in NFL history. The rings and trophies don’t say cheated victory, they say World Champions. Don’t matter how he got there he’s still one of the most honored NFL coaches.
---
Really?? Since I haven’t completed the wastelanders story I kept assuming it was the raiders ammo machine, wow I didn’t know you can do that kind of exploits on Console (I have been seeing them a lot on Xbox)
---
This is garbage.  I can't believe that they have the nerve to put out anther 'inside the vault' that ignores the community outcry about camp building.  And not one word about the fact that we still can't cripple the queen.  Those are only two issues out of many more we could name.
---
Ah okay
---
Whats even the point of charged fast traveling. If they are gonna make me pay at least make it like a regional transport NPC or some shit so it feels like I'm paying for a service. Load screens happen otherwise by their logic I would have to pay caps to enter a building, enter a game, exit a game, someone lags out, any time I encounter a load screen. Like for a minute everyone kinda shit on Ubisofts Division, but that was a good start for smooth loading of areas and in-between multi-player and single player environments like honestly the game play when it comes to ghost recon is questionable but the things they really took their time on are really good, Fallout 76 just feels like Multi-player Fallout 4 with way more restrictions and a slightly updated gamebryo but why the fuck can I not stop playing?
---
I Seen him in a lot on threads. Every time defending them and 'some time' being very disrespectfull. I decided to check his profil. And yes it took me around 1min to count. I litterally talked to him 2 times. If for y'all it's harassment...
---
1min + 2 conversation= harassment. Ok
---
And plus his only intervention here is for joking on you.
---
Well, the player base on all platforms has donated 125 million steel. So a few people have turned some in! 
---
I haven't even been on so I haven't been able to.
---
this guy asked about a *different* issue and community manager answered with the relevant information. what about this exchange do you not get.
---
What is sad is a lvl 300 preying on a low level for junk.
---
So I receive 25 caps per transaction (actually it's 26, but close enough). It's satisfying to sell loads of stuff, watch the caps trickle in and also know that you're helping people.
---
It doesnt work like that,pacifist mode is off when you defend/take over workshop's,it is also off when you wear the mask in the monster mash event.
---
Don't the raider/settler PAs do the same thing too?
---
Gonna just save this comment for later use.
---
Can't wait to watch the other materials.
---
Billy goat
---
I also play RDO.
---
Eight months of nothing for "here's hunting, which was already in the game, with extra steps," so maybe it's that perspective that makes me think it's not so bad.
---
Just say this to yourself:
---
"At least it's not Rockstar"
---
I have a camp right beside the Blood Eagle camp at Twin Pines Cabin. Bizarrely, they never ever attack, and I’ve only been attacked twice, both by Scorched. So, I have zero defenses. 
---
The Blood Eagles are oddly good neighbors. I kill them to scrap their weapons and there’s sometimes a magazine or nice plan in the cabin too, and there’s a safe, junk, and medicine cabinet, so a pretty good place to hit up each time I log in.
---
I'm not sure. I use a settler t51 and I never noticed.
---
You can find on average 1 legendary in west tek, i can complete a run of west tek in under 10 minutes. If I'm server hopping west tek for 12 hours a day on my grindy days thats 72 legendaries in a day
---
Those are the community rewards for hitting the figures the BoS need. There are also provisions (caps, plans, alcohols) for turning in deposits.
---
Project Bravo which starts in a couple of weeks has other specifications and rewards:

I don’t, that’s the point I’m calling out the guy above me for- he’s complaining that the current drum mag is immersion breaking. That’s FAR from the most immersion breaking thing in this game. I’M not complaining about it, I understand this game isn’t realistic; I also understand trying to design game balance, which is why the handmade drum mag has the same capacity increase % as the mag mods for all the other rifles. Which is what no one else in this thread seems to want to acknowledge.
---
Enjoy the opportunity to listen to your father ramble on about the things he loves as long as you can. It won't last forever.
---
Not so sure about the laughing one, because I can see trolls using it to try and annoy people.
---
I think everyone is missing the point here.  This patch eliminated ***a work around*** that allowed you to put wallpaper on both sides of the wall.
---
It's ridiculous that a work around was even necessary.  You should  just be able to apply wallpaper to both sides of the wall.  The fact that you had to even use a work around to wallpaper two sides of a wall is idiotic to begin with.
---
People are  frustrated that they are eliminating work arounds that should not even be necessary.  The fact that they were necessary is the real problem, IMO.
---
Any good places for acid that isn't cave crickets or hemlock?
---
I do hemlock sadly. It's near my remember it also has two snallys near it. I stored tons from Fasnacht also which I'm still living off.
---
Sucks.  Have you and your friend played Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon?  Tons of fun and a great example of how modern games (with multiplayer co-op) should work.
---
How often are the servers brought down for maintenance? Probably should happen more often.
---
I empathize with your pre-wastelanders experience which obviously was the catalyst for your pessimism. But, you really should try out the new content before you judge it. I strongly suggest completing the vault raid. You have missed out on so much end-game currency! You don't start getting treasury notes, from events and faction dailies until you do.
---
Perhaps them was just two gaylords having fun by thinking their penises can grow more than an inch after griefing low levels.
---
Scrapping the houses in Sanctuary never worked for me. 
---
Any time I tried to delete them the foundation was delete as well, even though it wasn't highlighted.
---
We used to have that. Place your camp stuff and the assorted textures underneath (weeds and whatnot) would vanish. Had it for about two months!
---
Then a new patch dropped in and it vanished, never to be seen again. :(
---
This. The confetti works a treat, and sometimes it even sinks into the ground so you can't see it or the annoying trees and rocks
---
The Secret Service Agent child. In Vault 79
---
I’m calling the downvoters who didn’t justify their downvotes pathetic. You’re willing to step up and at least explain your position- it’s not that *I* am to be feared, it’s people who’re afraid to back up their opinions. You don’t like the handmade drum mag? Okay, WHY? You don’t like my explanation of why it is that way? Ok, why?
---
You at least said why. I think your position is silly given aaaallll the other things that are vastly less realistic (which is what immersive must mean to you, because the drum mag doesn’t correlate to real-world similar weapons) but at least you stated it.
---
True, but it doesn't detract from FO76 \*specifically\* either.
---
I crash and freeze multiple times a day ever since update 20 on Xbox.
---
Please God no! I still have nightmares about gnomes...
---
I fought in the original everquest wars... I've been killed by so many gnomes that I cannot claw the images out of my head! I would just be out questing - trying to gather some items for the local lord, when all of a sudden, I would be besieged by those abominations! Their hollow dead eyes pierce my soul!
---
No its not, unless they changed that very recently, thats one of the main gripes with it, you have to manually turn it off, and it takes so long youll probably be dead before you can actually defend yourself
---
Honestly even with PvP and workshops, still a dick move for a 300 and another player regardless of level to team up on a 45. People like that are the reason I stopped playing. I literally couldn't get anything done cause every server I went to people killed me for my workshops.
---
I wish I moved!  on all 4 characters my camps have been in the same place since level 30 and never moved.   
---
I build a few functional camps but hate the big empty spaces they tend to become, so when the seedy shed dropped I got it and use 2 or 3 for everything, 1 with a bed and displays, 1 with workshops, the last with 3 fridges, generator and mu C.A.M.P.  
---
Then turrets and industrial spotlights on top, my camps look like an airport at night! can been seen from a long way away!  
---
Time for a rebuild..
---
Just watch for junk items that don’t scrap automatically and items in Misc. like Gunpowder that really weigh things down. 800 is a hard limit, but there are good ways to manage and work around it.
---
Hmmm look man I’m going to cut to the chase, you seem to at least acknowledge both view points so you seem chill to me, I thought you just viewed your own, but it’s clear that it’s more of misinterpretation of tone and ideals, my apologies
---
Totally, I think I missed these. Good post.
---
&gt; so this question will almost never be answered unless someone finds the actual code that determines it... which is almost certainly server side.
---
And it's worth noting that what "code" constitutes here is not as simple as people might think - much of this is likely written in papyrus, which is fairly well understood in the modding community, but it likely calls randomization functions that are built into the core game engine - meaning you'd really need the source code of the game itself, not just the papyrus code, to do this properly.

"She's a Mole Miner in disguise, she's telling dirty lies, a Mole Miner in disguise"
---
Ah, a fellow man of taste and culture I see.
---
depends, do you mean buying the colas or finding them?
---
So it seems to pick and choose when it will strike.
---
Were you playing in 1st or 3rd person? I play in 1st most of the time.
---
If AFK means walking away for hours to net 30 acid from Hemlock, I guess you have a point.  Otherwise it’s still a constant grind to collect from workshops, just without the nuisance of fuckface364 coming along.
---
And then a camo secret service skin as an atom store item 😂
---
I'd like to know why the stupid Charleston church audio gets played every time the mine starts to collapse during lode bearing.
---
Shhhh we need to stop talking about this or Todd will take it away.
---
Agreed. Maybe make it a feature in the Whitesprings clothes store dressing rooms, that you can “try on” any clothes they have for sale?
---
Logic behind the limit?
---
You must be new to greedthesda world.
---
Man, that's still a thing.... shieeet.
---
Makes me think of something I had happen last night. Had a guy show up to my "Defend workshop:event" after I just took it for the daily. As I'm mid-way through the first wave of mole rats he comes up shooting at me with what I assume is a TSE (double barrel?) Shotgun and PA, Level 35. First thing he says is asking to see what kind of junk I had on me and noticing my scrapbox I put down as he is opening fire. I'm thankful that not only did the previous owner already have turrets down but I have a fair stock of stimpacks ready to burn through, and the gauntlet was on.
---
Being a Basic Heavy build (level 143) I kept shifting through my weapons figuring out how to counter this, originally using my ultracite laser gatling, then panicking through everything (plasma gatling, flechette harpoon gun, pyrolyzer, minigun) until after I killed him the 3rd time I switched to my MG42 knowing it's my strongest gun and I just want to fend the guy off til the event is finished; even though it was more for honor at this point since I knew I had no junk on me and he didn't want the workshop, I wanted the last laugh.
---
It was about round 4 I noticed he wasn't just firing at me he was being methodical, trying to stand on top of me and shoot directly downward to cripple my legs. I had already been marsupial hopping and popping stims as much as I could to stay alive. He did manage to get me down once about this time but thankfully he didn't execute me and my auto revive procted, allowing me to get up and land a steady hail of bullets on him for the kill. He declares he will return once again and he does. While we are fighting this time, with my MG42 in hand, he does comment that I "really like that magic weapon" which I am confused by but still manage to take him down again. Where he comments "man, all that for some junk?", as he accepts defeat.
---
Ps:That magic weapon comment kind of lingered on me for a while so I finally researched it. And that's how I finally learned that they were not moded weapons but just "magic" legendary effects, and that I had one.
---
It absolutely does.
---
Donated 25k steel. Got enough booze and grenades to super overload me, and max out my vendoring for 2, maybe 3 days.
---
Got 2 new plans for crap I didnt care about (random raider PA mods)
---
Done on Xbox, and I've only been playing on console for 2.5 weeks. Not sure I agree its geared toward newbies, think its just kinda crap all around.
---
Still gonna donate what I can though.
---
Also to anyone having trouble getting steel: scrapper perk. Just scrapping weapons will get you thousands. No muss, no fuss.
---
The same thing happened to me last night.
---
I tried it this morning and it worked for me no problem. I always use the cases at ws station. Might need a bit more testing as it seems to be happening to only a few people.
---
It's still alive lol
---
That's awesome, you got to keep your junk because you're smart. If you'd have fallen for it, everyone would have gotten what they deserved. It's the raider way.
---
I wish the bullion limits were over 200. I've got about 50 treasury notes, but I also keep earning more. It feels like I'll never get them cashed out. It's frustrating to know you have enough to buy the plans you want but it will take days to trade enough in for them.
---
I tried using the wheel to go to a totally different weapon and back to my non-prime GP, but it still selected the prime GP.
---
Does this only happen with legacy weapons?
---
That’s straight up a form of psychological abuse
---
I can understand running up on someone but using chat to mislead people with game systems and abuse trust is wholly scummy, and not an intended use for the game
---
I’ve noticed people buy it too, mostly high levels, weirdly enough. It baffles me, because even a legendary .44 is almost certainly beat by other weapons.
---
Workshop are PvP zones.
---
Most of my frames drop loading my pip boy and scrolling through items because of all the random keys and notes I find. It’s frustrating trying to sell stuff because all of the junk (actual junk) that has to load.
---
I don’t drop them Bc we don’t know if they’re important in someway.
---
No, I'm just sorry it's not performing well.
---
so its not a skin and an actuall PA with different stats sold as a cosmetic... Nice Bethesda, NICE.
---
Settler did for about a month after Wastelanders went live, its been fixed for a while now.
---
Crazy that they missed it again with another skin though lol.
---
M.O.N.E.Y.  Create an 800 lb problem to sell a scrapbox solution.
---
I think a lot of the ground cover is texture. Which is why it vanishes when replaced by another texture/object such as a floor decoration or foundation.
---
I agree, even if there is some floor cover called "Cleared Ground." Even the most basic camp starts with clearing the ground cover.
---
Can consoles turn off grass, or is it just a PC thing? I’d love to turn off grass! Corpses vanish into the grass and are never seen again.
---
None of the game is consistent. I’d expect all of the vault logos are free of charge since vault 76 is a free fast travel vault.
---
I'm the same way, I've played since beta and I don't lock my stuff so whoever can take it.  I took about a year break while finishing classes for work and didn't play so I'm around 150, and a fucking level 564 comes up to the junkyard where I just finished setting up for all the new people to loot from game pass and they shoot me down, tbag me (kinda funny) thankfully I had just dropped all my junk and then took the shop, inboxed me calling me a stupid woman, and locked everything.  I just blocked and server hopped. I'm not into people who play like that if you want the shop, take it just don't be rude.  🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Might be worth keeping until a better one comes along. Have a Furious, and it takes things down very fast.
---
I've blackscreened a few times tonight. So frustrating.
---
Workshops are pvp area. Try to sneak while claiming a workshop. This will help you a lot because you will not shown on the map during sneaking and the griefers/pvp players can't see you.
---
Why are shotguns shit out of VATS? Is it a new issue with the patch? My Vampires Pump-Action kills things just fine out of VATS. Is there something I’m missing here?
---
NEVER open for trades.  I always inbox someone via Xbox chat if they want to trade.  I was killed so much during BETA and year 1 by people looking to trade.  I trade junk for free and other wise join my team and come to my camp for bullets.  I don't play around.
---
Bethesda: Quality Assurance? Never heard of it!
---
Yeah I'm on pc aswell and my game is running fine, no crashes, no performance issues, mostly everything is fine. Maybe bethesda fucked up the console version and/or consoles are having trouble running it in some way?
---
Yes exactly!
---
(Scrolls sell bar amount to max)
---
Sell 4782 40mm for 3583 points?
---
Confirm.
---
(Scrolls vendor bar amount to max)
---
Buy 2107 5.56 for 3583 points?
---
I would have to guesstimate how much ammo I have and click x100 like 6 times but the 6th time I don’t have any ammo so I have to press x10 and then x1.
---
Used maybe 500-600 maps. Got 4 t60 plans, 1 of which was a duplicate
---
I used a mod that specifically cleared Sanctuary. It was required for certain other Sanctuary mods.
---
I've donated around 7k
---
I have played this game since BETA about 900+ hours and I have known that Workshops are PVP area and monster mash is pvp event about 2 weeks now :D   
---
I cant read or it's poorly communicated to players.
---
Anytime I go by a lower level I inbox them and ask if they need anything.  I leave care packs at the overseers camp and wayword.  The game was so amazing at the start, everyone helped each other I want to pay that forward.  I've had lots of people be honest and say they were just doing bag drops for their alt and could I hold stuff.  💜
---
A quick sub reddit search would show you that this is currently a bug and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
A reinstall might just do the trick.
---
That's exactly how it works. You get the effects, not the DR. Just hope they don't have that bug come back where your armor can't break; that's why I scrapped my Berserker and went Bloodied.
---
boycott atlas
---
Genocide? Presumably this refers to Fallout 5? 76 is set about 170 years before Arthur Maxson, the Elder from Fallout 4, is even born. The Appalachian Brotherhood are not trying to genocide anything. Unless you count the Scorched, but they clearly need exterminating because they are a quite literal sentient disease.
---
Yep, that's how you do it. Still get the legendary effect even if it is broken. No idea on the build though, sorry.
---
That is just how it goes, 85% of the time no one really cares about workshop outside of a select few.
---
Pointless? No. Weak? Yes, unless Bloodied. Fast? Nope. Satisfying? Definitely.
---
Someone once inboxed me saying they were reporting me for exploits since I was hopping too high. 😂😂😂😂
---
You goin to like tkmantis
---
They are not META but pretty much any weapon style is playable
---
With my lag (I'm in South Africa) it's impossible to do damage to a moving creature. I run after them, punching like an idiot, and can't hit them them even if I'm right next to them. Once they stand still I can actually damage them.
---
I've been there with my melee alt. I always carry a gatling laser on me for SBQ fights. When she lands I switch to melee.
---
Also play on Xbox and have been seeing them littering a good portion of camps. After learning they were cheating I've been stealing if they aren't home. Can usually get about 5-6 lvl 3 locks picked before they fast travel back and fight me but that's around 1k ammo for about 50 caps bounty so I don't mind.
---
I am a day 1 player with over 1600 hours,it has always been like that for me,the only time it doesnt work and i have to turn off pacifist is with wanted players.

And if it was on PS4 I would have done the same I have a BE15 Laser and a B2515 Tesla who want to meet them. Jokes aside I'm not a Pro in PvP but for scumbags like that I would have tried
---
Thanks all! I moved it to the center of a huge space and it worked. By which I mean it visually duped it, and one of them could be placed and interacted with. I scrapped it, DC'd, and when I relogged they were both gone.
---
It just works?...
---
In Todd's name Amen
---
Truly a unique opinion.
---
I have my tse handmade and I love using it for justice
---
Honor to you friend
---
I have a missile launcher, a turret and hopefully my megasloth (tamed him and had to log out)
---
I do not regret buying it. I use T65 all the time. It seems to be one of the most durable PA sets in the game. After running many, many hours and constant battles with every mean creature in the game, I’ve only ever repaired the leg pieces twice and an arm piece once, and even then, the damage was very slight. It was more to satisfy my OCD than anything.
---
Just seems like you won’t be helpful in events like radiation rumble, and scorched earth
---
As to you fine sir
---
She has a straight 70% damage negation effect.
---
ESO is run by Zenimax.
---
I don't want to seem like I'm trying to rip on the game or anything, I'm actually enjoying it. Doesn't that kind of defy the point of wanting to run a pure melee build though? And will I not have to switch my perk cards mid fight to really utilise the Gatling laser?
---
Yeah man it's for the most pretty cool that way, I've had my share also.. A level 730ish, (me then level 23-5)  lock picked my base door once, came inside shouted over the mic " No Weapons" and stated pounding on me..I was so taken aback and a total noob I didn't even know about PVP as this is the first ever Online RPG game I've ever played ...He got no joy back from me as I was in bewilderment hahaha..so he decided to blow up my camp with Nade's  and  pissed off..I was like.."WTF?" Hahaha 'Welcome to Appalachia'✌️
---
Thats weird considering I've seen clips of people doing roughly the same damage give or take a couple thousand and they've one shot her. Makes no sense.
---
I had that the first time the pride icon was free. I didn't even think to look under icons, I mean why would thy give us an icon, why would we want an icon. I thought it was just bugged, like you said usually the free flag goes away when the item wasn't free anymore. But this icon didn't go away. Then I was proud prob for months because I didn't know buying an icon also equipt said icon.
---
But he didn't survive 😅
---
I lost my shit laughing at the lightning refracting due to a chinese guy
---
Why not trade like via wending machine. Craft it put in for high price. And negotiate what for how much, yes there are % cut. But yeah.
---
Would be great if there are some sort of trade site. Like WF have
---
You meet all kinds of people in this game...for good or worse , or how do you say it in English 😅
---
Does the number 52,000 come up, or is that in your inventory?
---
Go to your Faullout76 game directory and launch the Fallout76.exe. Manually log in with the first account, then Alt-Tab back to the directory and launch the Fallout76.exe again. Make your two accounts friends and have them join each other's server.
---
I agree. I have a few of the T-60 skins from the BoS daily but I can't use them on my X-01.
---
Hahaha yeah it was!
---
In my inventory it sits at roughly 19,000. 52000 is what pops up when i actually punch her.
---
But thats coming from stealth multipliers.
---
i have a two shot 10mm that i only started using because i liked the jack o lantern skin and because i dont want to waste my 5.56 ammo on weak enemies lol
---
Pistols can be alot of fun if you have the right perks. I also reccomend using a good scope and having a good snipe point. They're fun but they're not wade into a swarm of ghouls powerful.
---
As some have mentioned there was a hotfix that was applied and could have caused the issue. However that shouldn't have caused the issue repeatedly. 
---
Have you had a chance to test it anymore later on in the day?
---
I definitely got my moneys worth. Still playing. That said, they do need a swift boot to the ass sometimes
---
This. While I'm still at the loading screen I always hear the sounds of footsteps and crates being looted
---
In time they'll learn.
---
This should just be a thing on all clothing, there should be an option to make it go under armour or over armour. Literally they’d have to add another tab and I’d be happy.
---
If you want to go melee only your dps will suffer. My build is a ninja. I can go 2 handed, 1 handed, use bows and crossbows and I mostly use the chinese stealth armor. I don't have heavy weapons perk cards, I just use a fast firing gatling laser until she lands.
---
Id love it if it could stably leave me logged in for an hour!
---
Are you trying to say chemistry bench plan us NOT worth the 600 caps ? Metal bed 600 caps ?  .44 ammo 3c each ? Feels like i see alot of these camps recently
---
Yeah that’s a bit frustrating. I wish they would make it consistent and if they want to say it’s due to lore reasons, I think it’s entirely within the realm of possibility that a good crafter player would be able to design and paint BOS paints for the other sets. Hell im walking around with 44 intelligence should be a piece of cake.
---
You're gonna get that shit with workshops.  Not always though.  
---
When you're low level and claim one, build a scrap box in it along with your defenses.  Once you've got your extractors and turrets built, high tail it out of there.  Come back periodically, sneak around (sneaking means you won't appear on the map) and collect your resources.  Sneak over to the scrap box and deposit.  Then beat it out of there again.  This way if you are killed you keep your resources at least.
---
When a workshop is claimed, it appears as claimed on the map and shows who it's claimed by.  If your pip appears on the map in the workshop area, PVPers will know you're there and can be attacked.  You can't stop them from contesting your claim and taking the workshop from you, but the pure griefers don't want the workshop, they just want the battle.
---
When you rise in level you can successfully hold the workshop and win the battle.  The other day I had the Gorge and a a player with 100 levels on me kept trying to take it away.  He should have outgunned me, since he was lvl 160+ and I was 64, but the combination of the turrets being on my side and my sneak build made the difference.  I have armor pieces that cloak me when I'm not moving, so I snuck around and froze whenever he might spot me.  The turrets weren't much help killing him, but they kept me knowing roughly where he was in the junkyard.  When I got him in my sights I unloaded on him from range and took him down before he could figure out where to shoot.  I killed him three times before he gave up.  It was very satisfying.
---
Can confirm.  I always have it one.  One of those new player influx weekends, guy tries to take my acid farm.  I destroyed him in a few shots (lvl 240-260 depending when it was).  He doesn’t drop it.  Tries two more times.  Nice amount of caps I earned teaching manners.
---
Dumb I would've just killed you and took the loot. Lol. All of that nonsense gave you the gut feeling they were going to rob you.
---
I usually buy alot from people with "good" pricing even though i might not need the stuff
---
Not super recent, but I remember finding out around level 200 that diluted rad x doesn't suppress mutation effects
---
Hmm.  I don't know.  Could you share your build with me, if you don't mind?
---
I just had to laugh and I sent back "it's a serum I'll make you one, it's life changing" they were super nice then and we ended up taking some workshops and found the behemoth.  I can't remember the first time I saw someone hopping around but I remember seeing someone have electrically charged go off and it scared me.  😂🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Get to the roof top of watoga high school, on a ledge round the side there's a gnome doing...something..  to a teddy bear on a toilet.
---
The space suits make think of headaches. Gives me flashbacks of headaches.
---
Great pic.
---
sounds like its your internet speed
---
Todd steals your soul
---
Theres bugs that been around for almost 2 years...dont get your hopes up
---
So you've finally joined Bethesda in giving up.
---
I'm not giving junk to the Brotherhood... Less to someone else.
---
Free hat, here we come
---
I often run on mostly melee but I have both a Gatling plasma and a sniper rifle with me at all times.  90% of the time I run around yielding my fireman's axe and just wallop on everyone, but once in a while when things get into a pinch, I'll bust out firearm.
---
SBQs aren't really different in my book.  I can often do more damage to them with my axe than I can anything else.  So I'm stuck with waiting for her to land so that I can introduce her to my better half.
---
I don't know if it's really practical to run STRICTLY melee as you can and will encounter moments where something like a gatling is useful.  Think of the Club house at the golf course what Whitesprings.  Cant tell you how many times I've been rushed by a dozen or more ghouls.  An axe is only going to get you killed time after time.
---
The only time melee will be useful in that since is if you know how to stack your cards just right, any mutations and or bloodied abilities to where you can deal several hundred damage in one swing.  I don't know how to do that so I'm stuck where I am.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3195cb&amp;d=sb2s92sf2ss2se2p72eu0c13ck0c81ir2i41aj2ar2an2ao0lu2l71la2lt2ah0a00&amp;n=Bloodied%20unarmed%20stealth
---
That's my perk setup. I use a bloodied power attack damage +1 strength power fist with puncturing mod
---
Food i use deathclawing wellington, mutant hound chops, mutant hound stew, glowing meat steaks, mutton chops, yao guai ribs and yao guai roast.
---
Chems i Use fury, x cell and overdrive
---
Alcohol i use whiskey and vintage nukashines
---
Also run US covert op 8 mags and unarmed bobs
---
I just bring stimpacks and a plasma gatling get it done in around 30 mins, I've  been doing this since around level 38, im level 91 now
---
Every action in the game that overlays items are lagged/broken.
---
Ooooohmyyyyy
---
Armor?  Also there's only 1 unarmed damage perk?  What the heck.
---
She's broken right now to where if someone uses a perk that can cripple her, itll cause her to not land. She's supposed to land a lot more often than she does.
---
Inb4 Big Bethe Implements your request partially.  1400 weekly cap, 200 weekly bullion, etc
---
Like everything they do, when your roll the dice with Bethesda you usually roll a critical failure
---
if you like that kind of thing endzone- a world apart goes good with it too
---
I remember me and my friends thought to play on a team we need one camp. So for about a week we all played with the same camp all just mooching off each other. It was cool but the budget wasn’t.
---
I mean I'm level 360 and I live my flamers. They are extremely strong and great for crowd control indoors
---
Most of the people i play with on discord have canceled their FO 1st subscription,not one of them received an e-mail about the reason they quited or an offer to get back on it like in other mmo games, i guess they are still making a ton of money.
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ mine still works lol just transferred a b 25/25 fixer to my other acct
---
I can. Maybe your wall is bugged?
---
Yeah, it used to be not very important since you will only see it in the character selection and the loading screen. But now you will see it in the dialogs history when you are doing quests(and daily), which ugh.. I mean it's not even names because my alt characters are named with what I intended to build, which is kinda unimmersive
---
You need to wake up. Please, just open your eyes! We love you! We know it wasn't you're fault, we aren't mad! We just want you home! We love you. Please!
---
When taking a workshop you get a full screen message you have to acknowledge that states it's a PVP zone - so yeah definitely a "[you] can't read" right there.
---
As for monster mash, no idea, i know it's PVP but it's been so long since i've run it i can't remember how it informs you.
---
Nah man it’s ALL my walls. The weapon display just floats through them like the wall isn’t even there.
---
same issue for me, started funny enough on the same day as you now its showing a grey out FO1 but i still have it as a active sub in steam
---
I thought that was how many there was all the time..
---
Must be nice..
---
It's simple, karst topography.
---
[Karst topography everywhere.](https://imgflip.com/s/meme/X-X-Everywhere.jpg)
---
What they always do, 16x detail
---
Sure thing. I sent you a message with the info.
---
God i love the responder lore, id donate everything i ha e to have them return.
---
I don't get why people think they're hidden with those stupid suits. Oh look at that human shaped block of transparent stupidity crouched behind your trap camp waiting for spoils   , yeah totally cant see you there.
---
Glad you outwitted those stupid greedy fucks
---
50 masks are just 5 pounds, nah, keep em
---
You mean a game that doesn’t get consistently buggier over time?
---
A computer can't do anything randomly, unless it has free will, ofc. I don't thing Bethesdas engine has come that far. No thing such as random numbers.
---
Also, this game is particularly bad at PRETENDING it can do something randomly. There are clear patterns in drops, if you kill several legendary in a short time span or you turn in scrip or craft.
---
This doesn't mean there is a magic seed or great conspiracy. It's just a faulty game. If you get nocturnals, jump server.
---
I had a group of high levels steamroll me to take the munitions factory once. I got mad about it sure, but they at least had the manners to just flat out stomp me rather than try and steal from me.
---
Some people are just flat out raiders.
---
For the reasons stated above, way more powerful.
---
That. Between the t51b/ultracite there was a damage difference of 3 when hit by a level 95 supermutant behemoth.
---
That's why I think sh is the best pa. It's not a lot of extra damage. But it's something haha
---
Oooo, hot dogs
---
Because Mothman never sleeps
---
Not really but I have ~20 Quantums in my vendor. If youre on ps4 you can have them
---
Uniform rank: basically if you gain 10/7 = 1.43 ranks a day on average, you'll finish right at the end of the season on day 70. The more higher rank you are, the more grinding you'll need for the next one.
---
Uniform score: you gain ~3100 score every day on average, you'll finish right at the end of the season on day 70. Essentially, if you've been doing all the dailies and weeklies so far, an keep doing it, this would be your current and projected rank progression. Of course, double XP and double score events can get you more with less work.
---
It's even worse when the tree refuses to leave
---
&gt;black balaclava
---
So that is what the raider was wearing and I though if she was going rob a bank or something. Pretty meh.
---
Did any one get help?
---
Same here. Only the small ones seem to work
---
Nice
---
Yup only 1 perk. Pretty wild right? Armor is all Secret Service including underarmor. Ideally you'd have strength on all pieces but im missing 3.
---
That's when you leave some explosive bait in their camp while they are busy at the scorchbeast or something.
---
I help players getting all mr Fuzzys and all the Teddy Bears sometimes too :D. Just to show them that not the entire Fo76 community is toxic
---
Also i have brawling limbs mod on my arms
---
Dam, my dude I've been through some shit situations in FO76  noting like this.
---
Good on you for swiping the ammo
---
But than there is nuka shine, etc.  No other build really has anything that crazy.
---
Yeah still there, all though the event doesn't pop up that often
---
Its mehh. The second round/shot/whatever only deals I think 62.5% of the normal dmg. Correct me if I'm wrong
---
Yeah no doubt the hardest hitting setup in the game. I can even hit her in midair with my jetpack. 🤣🤣🤣
---
We are still scammed with a poster available in-game being the free weekly item from the Atom Shop and nobody said a shit. And nobody will and this is how World works. Fuck humans, they are merely bags of money.
---
Yep, it can be started by talking to the guy in the suit by the entrance
---
Nice.
---
I'm especially glad to have found your post to confirm the existence of unyielding thorn armor. I've been rolling for it all day. I knew they supposedly fixed the bug with it not being able to be unyielding back in April.
---
Wait there's a jetpack shortcut? I only know of the photo one
---
Yeah, that works too.
---
You do keep the effects. This is exactly what I do for my build.
---
Should be the Brotherhood of cork/wood/cloth/leather one because in the event holders mind brotherhood do need more of those than the steel and the concretes
---
I guess it just seems like too much work, idk.  Nice big gun is easy, murders things quickly, only down side is the amount of ammunition/time to farm and craft it.
---
Use Gauss shotgun
---
I have put away my BE combat shotty already.
---
Bro. Bethesda dgaf about a couple canceled subscriptions. I’m pretty sure most people buy it by the month and cancel to avoid reoccurring monthly charges.
---
I’m pissed because I had The Dragon hanging above my front door on the inside. Then I had to chance something because the doorway was glitching out and now the cant put the display back.
---
I wouldn't homie, do your dailies and just wait until the next season comes 2 weeks after the end of this one. It's a cool theme from the pop lore in fallout but unless you see yourself completely wearing PA all the time It's not worth it. Not to mention 2 of the top rewards are broken. Like the thunder gun skin blocks the sights, and the planeterraim projector have the same problem the nuka lamps have since they came in the fold momths ago. So that's probably not getting fixed. Not to mention some of the gilie rewards are pretty useless to someone who is new since half is endgame Armor and you can't even equip them Nuclear winter.
---
That you can put two windows back to back and change them into walls, make an interior wall.
---
Oh wait a sec......fuck Bethesda.
---
I actually have an almost identical pricing strategy and I’ve found it helps the people who need things at a lower level as much as it helps me bring in a very sizeable and consistent flow of caps. 
---
Couldn’t agree more with you
---
4 days ago I traded a bloody.44 max 3 star for the fixer plan. I was days away from scripting that piece too. What a lucky day in the wasteland it was.
---
Roach? Get off the roofs of that watoga building! 
---
*cue the witcher theme*
---
I got a t45 Tesla bracers plan in one which is not crazy but better than vodka... and I’ve traded in enough to get 9-10 provision boxes.
---
Doesn't work. CORS not allowed by their site (and probably by their TOS neither).
---
I dunno if it's my Aussie playtime or what but I rarely get DC'd from these servers.
---
Too much sense now that I put it in perspective. A few weeks ago I was asking myself about why today everything was Mutant prefixed.
---
Yeah I usually get to do it at least once every session. Guaranteed legendary boss from it so helps with the dailies.
---
Its actually not! My food route takes like 10 minutes (minus the sheepsquatch meat). Deathclaw island and abandoned waste dump for deathclaw meat and eggs, west tek for glowing meat AND mutant hound meat, dolly sods and silo alpha for yao guai and then free range event (when its up) for sheepsquatch. 
---
Whiskey you can make REALLY easy. Just need razorgrain and corn. Nukashine, bobbleheads and chems are pretty commonly available in player vendors and you can also make trading posts on here and facebook.
---
Motion assist servos for the raider, not the best but it’s ok, and deep pocketed trappers armor (all)and ultracite explosive vents (2x) I’ve found very 4-5 crates I get a plan of sorts
---
I think the best reward I’ve gotten was like 6 stimpaks. Pathetic Bethesda.
---
More like healthy scepticism.
---
Paragraphs
---
Try not to do this gibberish thing.
---
I’m still at neutral with Foundation and i dont want to grind for it
---
"Get it all out."
---
LOL!   Please don't tell me anyone has ever fallen for that.    
---
"Sure.  Just a sec."   (blocks and then FTs away or server hops)
---
That sucks, at least going through maps is pretty fast and easy until you get overencumbered
---
LOL! Thank you.
---
Just do your dailies.
---
Bullion isn't a problem.
---
What is your special? And what broken armor do you have? Also what is your Hp
---
Same. Gf and I play on pc. Game is running better than ever.
---
I love my beserkers build, it was my first, and its one of my best, there is a perk in luck where at low health you avoid damage sometimes, that’s an essential perk for this build (it starts with a S)
---
Yeah the hardest part about them is getting rid of all the shit after haha
---
Purely anecdotal obviously, but even still this morning I got three bloodied drops on the server I was playing on and then tried my luck with the Gauss pistol I was making and of the two crafts I did both were bloodied.
---
I think between grinding for legendaries, score, bullion, caps, and levels, the next thing I grind will be my head into the pavement.
---
I get you but I don’t know, I’m not the type of guy who can go online all day, and if I were to, it would take forever.
---
If other skins have taught me anything, you won't want that. It will be broken even after a "fix" *cough* screaming eagle *cough*
---
What is your special and what broken armor do you have?
---
SBQ dropped stable fluxes and repair kits.
---
I launched nuke after nuke in private servers like a loser trying to get flux when a single queen pays out more than like a half hour dedicated nuke-n-farm.
---
I took on the SBQ with my chainsaw. Hoping it got a laugh out of someone, but it seemed to do proper damage.
---
THAT is true
---
We should be able to turn gold scraps into bullion. Maybe a whole new camp crafting work station? Like a smelter. 
---
Maybe like 500 gold scrap for 1 bullion? 
---
Idk how hard it is to farm gold scraps but it should reflect on how much scraps it is per bullion.
---
And way cheaper than 1st.
---
At least it’s getting some fixes
---
I don't think so, I have it installed on two PCs and the custom item names persist - so they must be stored on the server.
---
reprehensible
---
Here you are making me nostalgic for the days of the over repair bug, when the chainsaw could actually compete with max level legendary weapons in terms of damage.  
---
How I wish we could get lvl 50 legendary chainsaws.
---
You don't have to go online all day, just do the dailies every time you get on, it just takes a couple of minutes, you will hit the max rep eventually.
---
For the one token armor mod that actually uses it.
---
Heck, we had a key ring and... sort of a journal in new Vegas.
---
I gave all my characters names like hdjfueirvcj because it doesnt matter. Only your account name matter and i made that 400 years ago. Named it dicknballsforever... so0o, theres that.
---
It's one of the biggest reasons I bought FO1st.   Can't stand it.
---
I can't recall my special off the top of my head. That build relies on stealth so I have a full set of life saving wood armor that has shrouded. I crouch faster than I walk. Other than that it is a typical high luck rifleman build with my dump stat being strength. I keep two points for bandolier and that's it.
---
[Hopefully this works](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_soundtrack)
---
If you scroll right to the bottom theres a list of all the ambient songs, their title and composer. From there it should be easy to look up on YouTube which song you're looking for. Good luck!
---
Yeah, that’ll take forever
---
Faster than asking for a combat shotgun skin.
---
Until then though, I’ll just be rocking my JE combat shotgun i guess
---
Yea, the raider ammo machine is about the size of a nuka cola machine
---
Yeah. It’s a little ridiculous. Aren’t they supposed to stack with each other and thus reduce lag?
---
Also - if they got rid of that weird fly particle effect, I think that would solve the problem. And make ash/goo piles behave exactly like meat/metal piles.
---
Oh also be careful not to have your DR go negative due to effect combos. This in essence negates the beserkers effect.
---
Defenses, it's a new atom shop item.
---
All of the Teddy Bear's, Mr. Fuzzy's, Sloth stuffy, and sure why not, Gnomes, should all be in the CAMP Floor Decor.
---
**Period**.
---
Exclusively having Atomic Shop plushies for CAMP is needlessly limiting and just... really dumb.
---
In short: There is no logic.
---
The map I always end up with is the one at the bottom of the bog, all the hope for T60 plans quickly go away and realization of my mistake of spamming 20 maps sets in as I do the waddle of shame to the nearest bench towards watoga
---
No, toy still get the Score, just the meter doesn't show you do until you get out
---
Time will tell
---
Do you always have epic convo with yourself?
---
Also don't one shot the Queen, unless it's your own nuke. People will be upset.
---
However congrats on your power creep, please keep it up.
---
I just dropped everything haha. Tried to keep the plasma guns and radiums for a chance at learning some mods. Also helps to have a full wwr set lol
---
Mine is just west of the Kanawa Nuka Cola Plant, right on the shore. Only enemies that attack are either super mutants or the stray scorched that come in down the road to the right so I have 3 missle turrets facing that way. Attacks only last a few seconds.
---
My characters name was Skunkynugs. For some reason my Beth account name was different, and that’s all anyone could see. So I changed my Beth username to Skunkynugs and that’s what everyone sees now. I think you can change it pretty frequently. I know that’s not a great workaround but it’s what I did.
---
The only times I've *ever* had a workshop challenged is when I've been on a lower-level character. My main and my 160-something alt can take them with impunity and never get bothered.
---
For all the talk online about them being 'legitimate PvP zones', they really only seem to go for easy targets...
---
Back in my day it was 200! Darn whippersnappers!
---
Sounds like a couple of Raider punks found a fancy suit and are pulling scams! Such a rare encounter! Haha! Clever! Terrible...but still Clever!! Oh my goodness, if I encounter this, I am sooo gonna role play with this! I fucking LOVE it!! Now THIS is how I imagined a multiplayer Fallout 76 being! Players taking on the roles of the characters!! 
---
Now the players settling in Appalachia have to worry about Bandit Raiders trying to use their Charisma and (pushing their) Luck to trick others into gathering up their scrap out of their locked bins! Threatening you to hand over all your resources, or their buddy in stealth armor who has snuck up behind you will with a really pointy bloodied power fist is gonna cave your skull in and kill you and they'll take it anyways! Oh, what a wild, wild world!
---
I bet that's why it was so sparsely populated with only robots, maybe that's what it was supposed to be? A big, fat, gigantic Vault-Tec-branded social experiment? 
---
Start them out with an empty world, because the Fallout 1st to arrive out of Vault 76 would see an empty world at first, only the remaining wild- and programmed life. 
---
But as they built upon the land, made their own individual homes for themselves, outside NPC people "heard about people coming back to live in in these parts" so started moving back in themselves. Treasure hunters and scavengers at first, mostly looking for first dibs on anything to scrounge up, and we all actually found Vault-Tec gold!
---
And now that it's been discovered, guess who's paying us a visit now, but none other than the Brotherhood of Steel! Well, they're not here yet, and apparently this guy wants us to, I dunno, bribe them to stick around and be nice to us? I dunno, he's asking for a LOT of steel, cork, and plastic for armoring and lining power armor suits with repairs...how many people is he expecting? A whole army of them? 
---
Should we be worried if there is a whole army of Brotherhood of Steel coming here, what with the new discovery of the gold?
---
What else is in store for this patch of West Virginia? We'll have to wait and see. And while we wait, we're playing this weird board game that is a real grind to get through, like Monopoly, only in a squiggly line, and it takes a whole lot of effort per turn to move forward a space or two in the mid- to late-game.
---
If you can call them that, the iron sights were unusable before and still are now after the "fix" Sure fixing the animations could be counted as a positive but those aren't as essential as seeing your target
---
With myself? What do you mean? And yeah I only do it this quick if its my own nuke or a friend is launching for me lol I'm not a bitch 🤣🤣🤣
---
Well here is sth for you to look forward to: iirc my QUAD gauss shotgun shows 7xx damage will all the perks on and with just a few mods. I am not even in my bloodied setup when I look at it.
---
Fallout 1st. They put infinite storage behind a paywall
---
I see it pretty obvious to be the way it should have worked. CAMP budget also should work similar.
---
Not much you can do unfortunately. It is allowed, and some people like to harass lower level players. It is *very* rare though, I have had vastly more positive interactions in this game. Keep at it. Maybe join a team so you have someone to do overwatch for you? I'm sure there are plenty of lvl200+ players who are a bit bored and could help out. 
---
FWIW, I am lvl82 on XB1 if that might help. PM if you want gamertag.
---
Well I’m level 127 at the moment, until level 74, I didn’t use armor at all, and I didn’t die as much as expected, now I use SS armor, and it’s nothing special, cloaking, troubleshooters, etc, and I’d say to really put your SPECIAL points into perception (for the rifle perks) and intel to level up, and for the weapon smith ones to repair your weapons better. I’d say stick to a really good few weapons (I have a Be/E/15 assault rifle, and i switch between a Be/E/P .50 cal sniper rifle and a  Be/25/25 lever action)
---
I feel this so hard tho lmfao I'm still trying to get those perfect SS pieces 😭
---
&gt;don’t store weapons and armor you don’t need
---
But weapons I WILL some day need is just about everything I keep in my stash.
---
Lately I've been hawking events at low level workshops.... Actually not hawking but *helping*... I go in unarmed and emote like crazy. I just want the score event points and I usually help build it up a bit with strong turrets and generators for them. 
---
Waiting for the day a low level guns me down in a panic spray lololol I won't shoot back they don't know any better :)
---
There's something that requires gold? :)
---
The game is not very hard. If you're willing to go junkies or bloodied you can take down any enemy easily, as long as you get the right perks. Basically just get all the pistol damage perks, bloody mess and work towards bring efficient in vats, scoring crits etc.
---
There are quite a few upsides as well. If you like to trade the pistols are less sought after and thus cheaper. Ammo is easy to come my. Also, gunslingers travel in style and have better sex. It is known.
---
Good trade piece to collector, carries high value being legacy. TS nerfed, explosive nerfed. Weapon breaks quickly during use. Fun, yes. Practical, probably not so much unless you are carrying repair kits. I  collect Tse and have tested  all I have and most break quickly. Another note flamers consume fuel quickly. It's the one weapon I'm iso to complete my tse collection. If you are on XB1 I'd certainly strive to give you a good offer including a AA FFR FR flamer which does well and much more.
---
Yep.   They are tunneling in.   Think, "The Great Escape."
---
Damn
---
Respect!
---
I have LOVED fo76 since release, despite the bugs n bs.. but I have now quit. Daily limits on EVERYTHING and mundane daily tasks have just made it no longer fun. It's all just chores now.
---
No logic. I suggest the following.
---
* \- Only bulk Aluminum and Lead. You can bulk other scrap if it needs to be bulked to vendor them. But only just before you vendor them. (Not all scrap needs to be bulked to vendor.)
---
* \- Keep all screws, ballistic fiber, black titanium, Ultracite, gears, and springs. Keep 200 adhesive and lead (bulked). Keep 100 or 50 of the rest depending on your own demands.
---
* \- Always convert lead into ammo when you get enough.
---
* \- Don't make black powder until you need it for ammo.
---
* \-Sell blood packs, tick blood, glowing blood glowing packs. Keep an eye out for other items you never use. You loot enough stimpacks to not worry about crafting.
---
* \- Don't save meat or any perishable items. The exception being queen mirelurk and radroach for daily, if you have cooler or you log off for the day. Vendor before it spoils. meat and pure water = caps. 
---
* \-Don't stockpile magazines or bobbleheads, use them or vendor the bobblehead. Try to sell mags but might need to just drop ones you don't ever use.
---
* \-Don't stockpile chems, stim packs, rad x, or radaway. You will need to judge how much to keep on hand depending on your build. Judge if it is better to keep on you or some in bank depending on the perks you use. Traveling pharmacy only works on inventory, not stash.
---
* \-test out Inventory weight perks. Depending on your playstyle one may be better than the others or a mix. 
---
* \-Scrip vendor legendaries you are not using. You will get better ones later, I promise.
---
* \-Don't keep that high level weapon, especially if it isn't legendary, for later. You'll loot another or find the plan.
---
Yeah, true, now the hand clips through the finger guard. Great job Bethesda
---
Tee bagged the invisible guy haha
---
You.... DONT like psychic floating backpacks? What the fuck is your problem bro?
---
I tried that and dropped the armor but still needed plans for some of the guns that sadly have some weight to them. What do you play on and what plans do you need for the T60?
---
Coz little pee pees is a known condition! We need to accept this is a cry for help from these people....
---
Yea, and I love it more than any other build, berserkers rifleman is my favorite build.
---
Uhhh... I saw one last night. Only a half circle of the light graphic was broadcasting.
---
I would have supplemented with my VFFR Blender (Minigun with the shredder and accelerated barrel mods and basher equiped)
---
I'm on xbox. Still need the rl, LA, and helm. Though I might be able to trade my spar ra for a helm lol
---
Yeah man correct me if I'm wrong I recall Deep Pocketed on combat armor has gold... I know SOMETHING in combat armor had a gold component...
---
Upvote for baller imagination
---
Yes please. My OCD can only take so many tiny bits of tree branches poking into my camp's walls..... 
---
I've been trying for days to figure out how to at least make it more presentable without my eyes twitching everytime i head to my camp.
---
A 'Scrap' option on trees/other useless clutter would be a welcome change overall.
---
I'm gonna be honest, I didn't notice most of the animation problems since I need to go invisible to see what I'm shooting but now everytime I'm not crouching I will see that
---
My character's name is Wren and has been since long before Wastelanders. My first few trips to Crater were a bit confusing. I maintain that Bethesda plagiarized me. 😁
---
I was surprised at how much damage a nocturnal gatling did at night.   If I didn't have so many great gatlings already, I would have kept that one.  
---
I use .44 for low-level enemies too, but I don't kill enough of them to ever have to buy it.   Get enough just walking around.
---
I'm starting to think that the next Legendary Run will be a BoS run. Cosmetic rewards to please the community.
---
Yeah, it's a cap sink for me too.
---
That sucks, I have an extra helm plan and a few mod plans just collecting dust in my vendor on ps4
---
I didn't know!  Glad you mentioned it.
---
Damn lol
---
My steel is worth more then the shitty rewards Bethesda is trying to give us
---
The probably never will since it makes them more money. But we can hope. Take my upvote as a symbol of that hope.
---
But you can put stuff on your weapon displays to put stuff [in middle of the air](https://imgur.com/K7K44b8).
---
Yet there are gold resources at six of the workshops. That's a lot of gold for no apparent reason.
---
Does shooting them in the head with a hunting rifle count as help?!
---
Yes, dear god yes.
---
I'm still trying to acquire Nazi Paraphernalia too, man.
---
You can sell plans to vendors but its a glitch, same with ammo.
---
Glad to help.
---
Out of all the issues I've seen, I've NEVER seen any "delays" like OP mentions...
---
I’m just about to unlock it. Does it equip automatically or do you have to manually do it?
---
Oh my God not what I meant 😂😂😂
---
This chick daydreams of crushing nazi skulls.
---
It just works.
---
Yes.   I finished the Run.   I used to do daily/weekly challenges for atoms before it, but there's no point in doing them now.   I've finished most of the other challenges that are do-able.  (No, I will not beat to death 1000 robots by hand.   I don't want carpel tunnel that badly.  All the rest are done, though.)
---
I was thinking perhaps I should try to be level 300 by the time Legendary Perks come out so that I get all six slots immediately.  I don't know.   Wish I could find another game to entertain me until at least Meat Week.  So far, Outer Worlds and State of Decay 2 have failed to draw me in.   Might try No Man's Sky or Red Dead Redemption 2 today.   They're both on Gamepass.  I know I'm too picky about what holds my interest, but it is what it is.
---
So not true. I do those events and smash it as a non bloodied. Remember plain people like us add-manage, be the conduit, and get the ore etc. Might not be glamorous at all times but hey, what I do finishes the event.
---
There's a misconception thanks to Bloodied that everything's weak. It's really interpretation... Like if I put an average guy/girl (up to preference and being politically correct and showing equality.... Ffs) next to an insanely sexy guy/girl, you'll think the former is shit and not bother.
---
Pistols. Instigating trait. Watevs. You're the plain girl. Mom will love to meet you. You're serviceable, probably a good saver, would be great with kids. 
---
But Bloodied is the hotter sister everyone wants, even if she wants you to spend your life hurting.... Pun intended. Thanks for coming.
---
The biggest place I get nuka cola is the TNT dome where you get the t-51 nuka cola paint. Lots of stuff there
---
I know this is old but leaving here in case it could help someone. I read the plan then fast traveled got the notification and it was not there when I went to craft. I checked in plans and it was not there. I looked among my known plans and it was mixed in with them but was not "known" I clicked it again and I was able to learn it.
---
So we are putting them out of their suffering then. We should kill more!
---
Really? I haven't been disconnected in weeks. I mostly play later at night though, so maybe I'm in a more stable window.
---
I don’t remember, if it’s automatic then a lot more people would be up in arms about it but I’d check after you u unlock.
---
Dailies give scrip.
---
Yeah, I'd play it, but we have a better chance of them fixing all the bugs.
---
Only one alcohol, as well as one chem, can take effect at a time
---
Sure it'll cost 1700 atoms and break after the next update
---
nm
---
I tried this but the controller turns off.
---
Not true. All the ones I mentioned stack. Test it yourself.
---
I’m taking a break for now. Kinda burnt out
---
Sadly, this is what all online games do. Even the ones with required subscriptions want you on daily. This is why they added the option to buy SCORE levels with ATOMS. Most people that play online games fall into two C.A.M.P.s More time than money or more money than time. The rest have young kids and should be attending to the little brats 24/7 instead of de-stressing with a game. When you finally snap, you go on disability and are now in the more time than money CAMP.
---
The BP was too creepy for me.
---
Never show your 4 year old the Child's Play series. I haven't really recovered.
---
I found WS bunker seems to spawn a few quantums. And they stand out like dogs balls down there. I usually nab a few while their desk fan and tech data population gets slammed.
---
Good on you.
---
Not so lucky over in NZ. Though the default router doesn't help.
---
You can, you just have to rotate it and place it yourself cos it doesn't snap to the wall anymore. You can place it crooked and half clipping into the wall, sunk into the wall, and sitting a touch off the wall now too - so it is really hard to place it properly. I just did one a few hours ago, and it was finicky as hell
---
Fast travelling just needs to be free entirely. It's stupid. Especially when going from camp to camp in game to look at vending.
---
If those folks in Bethesda would let me write for them, I could fix soooo much of this for you. (Well, not the bugs...but the plot for this estimated 10-year adventure?  I could make it awesome. I could make it make sense.)
---
PS I also have not applied, just talking out my butt
---
Many many songs of the era were either double entendre or crafted with words meant to make you think they were what they weren't. 
---
I think it was part marketing, part what can we get away with, and part "you thought what!? Get your mind out of the gutter!" If a censor objected. 
---
That one about "chopping that meat" isn't about a serial killer. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You can cancel the melee animation after a swing by crouching.
---
This makes it easier to hit a second enemy straight away
---
Loot them my good man, loot them.
---
^(This useless suggestion has been provided free of charge, by the GurglingWaffle.)

It equips automatically when you unlock it. Happened to me too.
---
No!   You hate RaRa more than Ward?!      
---
"I've got my eye on you," he snarls after your having fetched and killed for him for a solid month.   You know, using his huge vocabulary of what?   100 words?   ugh
---
Everyday is a new day, so there is a chance to you can do the new dailies or you can be hitted the bug again. RNG is RNG...
---
I onky got the bug once, after that, no problem at all.
---
That fly effect is the glow that other mmos use to show where loot dropped. It has helped me find the pile many times. But yes, when it all stacks up it is crazy. But Line in the sand is a problem because people glitch the event and have the spawn pop up in one place. This is player caused issue. The rest is on Bethesda.
---
When? They *claimed* to have fixed the "remaining edge cases" with the patch a few days ago. If you got it after the patch you should submit a bug report
---
But no, it doesn't work like that from what I have read. It was basically just a bad roll of the dice, and it shouldn't affect your next roll if that makes sense
---
All ammo 1 cap, all cores 80% or more 25 caps, all cores less than that go on the floor along with missiles and 40mm nades. 
---
If I ever get over my issues with the convertor, I'll go back to converting ammo and selling the "change" when I'm done. 
---
Before the converter went from bad to fucking horrible I would take whatever was too small an an amount for the converter and stick it in the vendor. Let that accumulate until it sold.
---
Only if you promise to pay for each skin one each type of PA. You naughty boy, trying to take money away from Bethesda!
---
At least the pacify robots perk is fixed on robot vendors now ;)
---
One ally at a time though
---
\#iloveyou
---
Y dun u just quit the server
---
It’s better but still bad.
---
It should have adjuster bar like setting price of caps on vendor item.
---
Does anyone even still play nuclear winter?
---
Didn’t the map guy get sued or banned for making that map?
---
I was standing in a stream that wasn’t even tall and I was gaining +10 rads per seconds
---
Yeah, and there’s actually a nice separate community there 👌
---
They've claimed for days they've fixed it. I lost probably 10k SCORE with 0 compensation. They dont plan to do anything for us lol.
---
I traded in 10000 steel so I got a bunch of the crates. Got some ultra cite plans some prime weapon plans and assorted stimpacks to go with the plethora of
---
Liquor
---
Nice. I tried it once and just couldn’t finish tbh. Maybe cause I’m trash at pvp lol.
---
No way , thanks for this nearly level 300 and bloodied build and have been dumping or vending all my rad ex 👍 I’m going to be gulping it down now
---
That you can hold down the B button to immediatley get out of any terminal.

(groans)

Cancel it on Microsoft manage subscriptions. You'll get a refund easily. Kinda happened to me and another dude last month.

Yeah starts from the East side has to be manually started, the real question is wheres Aries? I havent seen him in a month or so.
---
Haha yeah I had just assumed since normal rad x suppressed them that diluted would as well but alas
---
It eeeezzz what it eeezzz
---
It happens with ammo too in my vending machine. Something unassigned all my ammo. It was super weird.
---
Oh cool, thanks!
---
Yes, afternoon of 8/6/20.
---
I just let them take the work shop from me. It seems to irritate them more than anything. PVP is so stupid in this game.
---
It takes a few minutes for all the hackers to get the updated hacker-ware.
---
How did it turn out weaker? I'm a HG / PA build and my plasma caster hits non crits for 1500 - my Plasma Gat is 120 / shot on the SBQ.
---
Ive avoided going to an unyeilding bloody because I have yet to find a video where someone does more damage than a pa hg, without using a bloodied handmade or fixer. I know myself and if I went with those builds I'd quit in a couple days because of the lack of variety.
---
Sure instills confidence that vending is working correctly and safely.
---
Brilliant, me too so avoided the stuff like the plaque . Can’t wait for my next ghoul run and queen fight 👏
---
PVP is 100% not worth it.
---
Nope just two weapons of the same class it seems. Happens on my heavy gunner with my ultra and reg GL and also my commando who carries a. 38 and .45 fixer.
---
Weird that changing weapons didn't help. Hope you find a solution
---
Pressing Q you can sort your inventory. Helped speed up scripting and maximize stash space by getting rid of the heaviest first. And eating the food with the least cdt.
---
I had this problem too. I found I could get it to place on the wall at a lower spot on the wall. Then i snapped another display on the first display. After that I could move both higher on the wall.
---
Make a build and learn on it don’t just get a bunch of random perk cards (or do whatever is fun for you).
---
Stash management is big, scrap guns and armor instead of stashing them to learn mods. Scrap whatever junk before you put it into the stash. I'd recommend researching what kind of builds there are and which one you would want since starting it later can be time consuming
---
There are so many unbalancing issues in this game.
---
Workshops and defending then after claiming along with other events is the fastest way to level and helps collect junk. 
---
Good luck! Watch out for butcher Pete!
---
"I ripped off a Deathclaw's arm and beat a Scorchbeast to death with it".
---
Yeah... every time an NPC (like Meg) gave me attitude, all I wanted to say was "you have no idea who you're dealing with". Like, I could murder every one of you in under a minute, then nuke you 10 minutes later without breaking a sweat.
---
what does this cost? $12 usd? $16? how do they mess THIS up!? what is even happening anymore?
---
What other online games provide routinely free cash-store currency? This isn't meant to be sarcastic. I generally want to know. None of the mmos I have played but maybe it is a new thing.
---
It's a skin for pa jetpacks
---
Edit, but you have to re craft it. You can't apply it to your existing pa jetpack
---
As a melee only build, I keep a heavy gun in my stash and swap my perks before a queen fight because you get plenty of time. 
---
I'd suggest getting yourself a heavy gun too.
---
You sir, are amazing.
---
The Devs like to make funny with teddy bears and gnomes. There is one scene with gnomes and a fear teddy around a skeleton.

Hmmmm, so say the raider hmmmm
---
The most frustrating thing about this post is why couldn't have stated the exploit in the beginning or during the post. Their biggest fault is their continued lack of communication and they have shown little effort in improving that over the years.
---
Don't think it's possible with the current terminals "engine." It is only meant for pre-determined responses but absolutely a slider would make it more viable.
---
Listen, I'm a swampass pvper, like 90% of my game revolves around PvP and trading for PvP gear, but for anyone who is below lvl 60, I just don't fight them. And I never double team like a bitch. I dislike griefers, and I don't think trap bases are funny or interesting. The only thing I want is a fair or interesting fight. And if I'm fighting someone who is waaay below my skill level, I'll take off pieces of my PvP gear and use a bad weapon and go at it, just for a even match.

Scrap guns to learn mods
---
When you hit level 5 turn pacifist on
---
 Stick to the forest untill level like 15, then move to the toxic Valley untill late 20s, then go to the Ash heap
---
Explore. Do quests. Find side quests. Do events. The best way to level up to to kill shit haha
---
I could be wrong, as I’ve never used it, but I’ve read full excavator set adds maybe 100 carry weight? Also, on my x-01, I have the leg mods I believe which increase carry capacity by 50 each? Sorry, I haven’t used Pa in so so long. 
---
Sadly, imo, it’s not worth it on 76. I run unyielding with food/chem reduction modifier. That alone saved me 6 perk card slots. I have amassed 1300lbs of chems in my inventory, but I’m at ~250/425lbs with no weight red perks :p. I do use ballistic reduction card, that’s all. Side note, bonus damage/less ammo, tanky (I normally grab at least 2 pylons), can easily do SBQ without pa, and I believe* I’ll be able to do colossal problem without it as well. Can survive a 1000ft drop if you’re lucky (never ran serendipity before, it’s hilarious). In my x-01 set my resistances averaged like 500. In my unyielding I average 440 probably. Only thing missing is rad protection, but if I ever need to farm flux, I hop in Pa and use perk loadout mod to swap into my Pa build which has those food/chem cards for when my armor is unequipped, so I can be underweight no matter what I’m wearing. It’s amazing.
---
1. Enjoy the journey
---
2. There is a end game grinds that open after you beat the whole settler questline at the Wayward to get the gold from the vault. Depending on if you want to play the end game grind you might want to do that first to unlock the grind.
---
3. Killing enemies is the best way to get EXP, try to farm areas you travel through
---
4. The left side of the map (forest, ash heap, wastes) are ~level 1-30. The middle part (savage divide) scales from low level to high _if a high level player has been in an area before you got there, the mobs might be scaled up_ . The right side of the map is generally 50+
---
5. Might want to consider specialising in a weapon type and committing your perk card and special stats to that. You can change builds but it's only really possible at higher levels.
---
6. I can almost guarantee some high levels that you run into are going to gift you items, the players are generally friendly.
---
7. Almost forgot, you can enable pacifist mode after level 5 to avoid PvP/ getting ranked.
---
8. Have fun!
---
3rd. Character was jerking all over.
---
Just let us scrap ammo, I swear it would have been easier.
---
It’s terrible on console too :/
---
Unfortunately, after analyzing their posts and other YouTuber's opinion on the matter, it seems that they fixed some trigger points for it but it overall is still an issue. So their "band-aid" fix for it is the double score chances to catch up on days missed. Which ultimately doesn't help people where it seems to be an every other day issue..
---
I'm sorry, but this should be reported to bethesda. Players should not be getting free ammo by exploiting the game. One, its breaking the agreement you make with bethesda when you exploit bugs. And two, it gives others the incentive to fuck up your shit if you use said exploit.
---
This happened with the PAID settler PA skin. I don't mean an atom shop item, the one that you could only get by buying the $20 settlers bundle. It removes the power armor keyword from the parts, so they no longer provide that innate 15% or whatever rad resistance. So you are essentially getting the equivalent of being naked with a single rad-x
---
I mean the meter is manually updated, obviously we can't "fail" it, it's not like there's any impact to us actually donating resources, it's just a sink for later.
---
Quite the response guys! Thanks a ton!
---
Unstable yes, laggier no. This update increased my performance drastically
---
They’re not doing it for the junk, they’re doing it because they like ruining the game for people that can’t defend themselves.
---
Hey at least they’re assaulting people in a game, getting it out of their system and not doing this to people in real life.
---
Avoid carebears, they will destroy the best part of the game for you: the first 15 levels. You learn to survive, explore, be happy about every new weapon or plan you find. They ruin it for you by giving you stuff they dont need and you shouldnt have and telling you stuff you shouldnt know. Avoid this sub until you are in the endgame (level 50). Dont google things.
---
Try joining another public team then fast travelling to them, has worked for me.
---
If you even need to talk I'm here.  ❤️
---
The main comments ive seen on it is don't do anything but join a main world after reset, and make sure you've left a main world before reset, no NW and no private. I will tell you that is NOT the case as ive made sure I do that and have been hit with the glitch multiple times.
---
BETA player with about 1100 hours, as far as i can tell ive always had to manually turn it off before attacking or responding to an attack from anyone
---
And after my 1100+ hours and keeping track via a spreadsheet for a few months, I can tell you that in my experience there is no proof of it being biased towards effects. There aren't that many primary effects in the pool, seeing a few in a row or a high proportion out of a group is not that unlikely. The vast majority of mass crafts/purveyor rolls/whatever look completely random. Then one person gets something that sort of looks like a pattern and suddenly it's all a conspiracy and there's a code to crack
---
Yea since the update my vats is more broken then before. It takes round about 4/5 hits with my melee build to register the first hit. Dmg numbers always pop up but nothing happens. Before the patch only the first hit doesn't count.
---
This,so much this
---
I was playing it though my PSVR and have never felt so sick befiore like i did on radiation rumble
---
You: *asks for it to be gone* me: *attempts to walk to DC*
---
People were playing for the old holiday rewards. Those got patched so nobody cares anymore. They also announced another double daily week as one of the incentives (that will obviously get met regardless of whether people contribute) so people don't have to keep pretending that they're being forced to play NW if they don't want to
---
Mike Patton?

Stockholm syndrome is strong with this one.  He refuses to stop giving them money, yet seeks empathy from others for his choice.  Just like a battered woman, he will continue to be abused by zeniscum, because they know he will not leave them.

oh wait was was it, again not wanting to spoil so will be vague

I managed to get robot, and mother, now onto turrets, if any part of that doesn't make sense I might be able to help you progress

(I'm up to a part involving a flag and meeting some other group)
---
I'll resub when double-sided walls (or the option to wallpaper both sides) officially makes it into the game.
---
I got a dozen or so plans, prime receivers, PA mods etc. from opening 80 crates, I now have enough alcohol to stock my fridge half a dozen times over (got a few nukashines, been fun watching people find them in the nuka cola machine) a bunch of stimpacks and probably some other assorted crap. I could easily go donate another 10k for another 40 crates if I wanted to, but I don't see the point, the rewards have all been garbage (already knew all the plans that dropped) and just serve as a way to fill up your inventory and/or stash. If there are good rewards in there, then the drop rates are so bad only longtime fallout 1st users or dupers will have a hope of getting enough crates to find them.
---
lol. let's conveniently leave out that they fixed a game breaking bug with teslas and flamers/plasma flamers that was in the game since launch. And all the other fixes too, I don't like them so they don't count &gt;:(
---
I wasn't asking for it to be gone, the border actually is gone after the update.
---
Yeah its horrible, looks like there are more flies above the meat piles or something, no idea if thats the cause, but I watched as my GPU would kick up to 100% when looking in the direction of the piles with a sub 20 framerate, then it would drop back to 40% usage and my framerate would skyrocket when looking away.
---
Unless you're able to do 1k damage on her, you won't get any rewards, so help take care of the mobs that spawn, even if you have to switch to a gun for the event to get some tags. Good amount of exp since they're mostly max level. Once you're a higher level, then you can start doing enough melee damage to get rewards. She usually lands a few times when ive fought her, but it depends on your group and if they're hiding on tops of tents and stuff. Just all depends. When they fix the event eventually, crippling her wings will make her land, so she'll do it much more often and you'll have more chance to whack her
---
I meant you were asking for the lack of a border to be gone
---
lmfao where are people getting these numbers from? It's more of a 60% cut if you do most of the dailies/weeklies. 1500 from the full season vs 4500 doing challenges for ten weeks. Not saying that's insignificant, but stretching it this far just makes your whole argument look worse
---
Delete it quick
---
I've had them and never had an issue. They're fun to do.
---
Its fun having the border gone if I'm being honest. But I wanted to make sure that its brought to peoples attention so it could be adressed if needed.
---
I just started. Hit level 20 yesterday. The only PvP I've had has been 100+ guys ganking me in events. I tried a workshop and it was basically a giant target on my head that said " come camp this noob". Fortunately the game allows you to block people but it sucks to basically be solo because I can't contribute meaningfully yet.
---
With some of the glitches and odd quest steps, googling is totally fine and is nothing to be ashamed of.
---
The Free States bundle had a combat shotgun skin. Maybe that will rotate back in at some point.
---
Protect your junk
---
I was being facetious, my bad.
---
Edit to add more:
---
Too many people like to poke with 'It's just one mistake' while either being utterly ignorant of or flat out ignoring Bethesda's absolutely pathetic track record with...well pretty much every game and patch they put out, but especially with this particular heap. 2 years of every patch breaking something. 2. Fucking. Years.
---
Are they like a grey spot in the rules?
---
I’d purchased a bow skin in the atom shop that said It applied to compound bows. I found out it didn’t. This patch fixed that issue for me. That made me happy
---
Went pretty good maybe we have to post it more often. Sometimes it's just the wrong time or don't know the reason. I want to post thisore often and include community feedback as well as be more specific.
---
If we get the benchmarks for materials done for this BoS event we will have two it seems.
---
whenever it has happened to me,  i just completed the challenges anyways, and had no problems.
---
So did you actually spent 15000 atoms to finish it or you actually played a bit?
---
It absolutely did, fixed in patch 19 for those cosmetics 
---

---
The second dude in stealth armor couldnt harm anyway even if the other guy attempt to take the workshop. Since update 20 its not possible anymore to jump people in a team.
---
But he or they definitely tried to grief ya but you mastered the wasteland exam.
---
Good job sir!
---
I've never heard of a rule about this. I've had a bunch myself and many of my friends have done it. It's sort of like running mods on pc. I've used a couple of mods like a perk card loadout mod and never had issues. 
---
The rule of thumb usually goes if you have to ask it's not a good idea. But my experience is underground bases have never been an issue
---
Photo mode, or a cleverly placed bass
---
Sure, but the free states skin doesnt look so special. They should maybe add some engravings or gold in a new skin.
---
So i can build them but it aint risk free
---
Godsend
---
Get onto Jacinta Ardern....
---
Just a couple of plans I didn't know and a combined litre of booze.
---
They need to give the pipe pistol a 44 auto receiver so we can get rid of them faster.
---
I doubt they could 🤣 hard to get up to much trouble from your gamer chair covered in doritos
---
It does it on radiation rumble too, no glitches used to stack corpses there. Its something that was introduced in the update because it never happened pre-patch 21.
---
Where exactly did you go, it’s not completely gone
---
Tell me about it and always halfway through a event grrrr
---
Why are you complaining about ammo being sold for worthless caps? In real life you have to pay **money**! smh my head head
---
Hey, in RDO you can grind the hell out of gold bars, not easy or fast but doable
---
Not meta, but because I'm a stealth commando and my rifles have suppressors, my .44 revolver has a higher range than my handmade. Can do almost 600 damage per shot and I have no gunslinger perks. The guass pistol got me somewhere in the 1.5k damage range. Not as much DPS as a commando build, but viable
---
i didnt find that out until after i complained about the ammo converter.
---
Gotta give the Brotherhood some insulation.
---
The Hellfire PA skin used to do this too. That's the Rank 100 reward in NW
---
Do pipe bolt action pistol and revolver use both rifle and pistol perks if equipped with a rifle stock? Got TS and Junkie versions the other day and was thinking to mod them accordingly and spec my alt to use the rifle and pistol perks.
---
INT buffs XP. When farming something don't loot unless it's what you're looking for.
---
Distant Thunder drops good plans.
---
Probably just sped up server responsiveness slightly. This might be phased out naturally, unintentionally, as the game is polished. I assume the game puts you in a world, you leave said world. There is a delay before it kicks your account off of that server. You reconnect in time, game places you back on original server for convenience. One day it might just disconnect you instantly. My gf and I play on PC and have noticed a big improvement on how the game has been running since 21. Also, I could be way off, don’t quote me here. We play pmuch every evening after work. If you ever need help swapping just add me and lmk, same as reddit username.
---
If you put it on the concrete can you ever remove it?
---
I'd say that's accurate.
---
My character's name is Martha due to tradition of naming my first character in any game that allows it "Martha"
---
Now that wastelanders is out, and I'm a raider, I wanted to change it to Jett. This needs to be a feature, even if it's just one time or only available with fallout 1st.
---
But why does it lag so bad when you open the stash? I'm pretty sure if we could put in more, the game would just implode lol.
---
Hit 100 before I went to bed the day before yesterday, got up thinking I'd be bored, proceeded to play the game for 8 hours without a care in the world. I just helped people, did events, ran encryptid, ran silos etc. Went on loot runs, for once I didn't care about gaining XP. Still nothing new to do, but if you enjoy the game, then you'll find something to entertain you.
---
Yep, gave up yesterday because I was scrounging things for caps and the delay on picking up and item and actually receiving the item was about 3 seconds.
---
I do both have two profiles with first and have another 4 just storage and multiple xboxes multiple xboxs makes swap overs so mush easier and lessens the risk of loosing shit lost a few decent pieces previously can pick up a second hand console cheap
---
Question of the day (shopping) paper or plastic?
---
You can only get inside if you launch a nuke at it 👌
---
If you get killed don’t you lose all of your buffs? Well rested and fine-tuned even... seems like that’s the case for me. Never noticed losing buffs on disconnect though, I’m just saying in general. I’ve never even cooked those fillets
---
Get a mate to stay in your private holds it open
---
You do know about the Brotherhood update, right?
---
They're coming to the Atlas Observatory and their 'fanboy' Russel Dorsey is collecting junk for their use right now. Until they get into Apalachicola, the Atlas is off limits to the average gamer
---
I’ve seen a few posts about proven quest line over the last few days. They’ll have to wait for a hot fix or more likely in the next update they will fix it.
---
Think I might have to do a few silos. Only done it twice so could do with some practice lol
---
What even is the thing above his head? Why is it there? All it does is obscure his face...
---
I think Atlas will open when the BoS arrives, but I'm not sure
---
Went back to what I was doing before legendary run, power leveling!
---
Agree, doesn't help the majority of fo76's revenue comes from MTX. The game clearly hasn't sold as well as planned hence why they have brought it onto the xbox game pass in hopes of baiting more whales in.
---
I mean I don't know when anyone would have bought the game full price after launch, I bought a key from CD Keys for £5 during the canvas bag controversy.
---
I enjoy dropping nukes, I usually go to a server, drop any available nukes for queen fights, do encryptid, then move on. Also been going out of my way more to help lower levels and trying to make friends.
---
I sometimes think about this games dev process and I remember reading an article some time ago about adobe photoshop. The software has been changing from its original day one launch. Every update, new feature, etc adds new layers of complexity and interconnections between areas of the software. If you change something over here, 5 things over there are affected. The article went on to explain that there are ghost code in the software that server almost no purpose at all. But they can't take it out because it'll cause instability.
---
Creation engine is an adoption of another engine. It's been used to make multiple games spanning many years. Often to add a feature in a game the engine will be updated to accommodate such a change. In the case of 76 my understanding is ID software network capabilities were tied I to creation engine. Likewise the building mechanics in 4 were a new addition to.
---
So the short of it is creation engine is this clunky massive sprawling complex software far from being elegant. Its a patchwork of additions subtractions and innovations layered in. I'm sure when a "bug" is detected the issue may actually be in the engine itself. 
---
This is all side line armchair analysis. Take it with a grain of salt.
---
On youtube, I follow final render and no respawns for camp builds and general fo76 content, as well as DTDgamer for camp showcases. DTD also lists the builders channels so if you like a particular style, you can follow the creator. Riflegaming is a good one to follow for general fo76 content as well as character build guides
---
Try swapping out just the paint on the arms and see what happens.
---
I did that with the Hellfire paint and switching out just the arms made the usual expected radiation protection come back.
---
On xbox just use the screen shot feature on xbox to save your pictures.
---
I just watched somebody else pick up a recipe. So people could definitely take things out of the world and deprive you of them.
---
I mean, points for creativity on the robber's part.
---
Not in the slightest. I have just shy of 1000 hours in the game. Despite having that many hours, I have suggested my friends stay away from the game. The way I describe it to them is by anology: Fallout 76 is a bag of Lays potato chips. It has a recognizable brand. You can sit there and mindlessly crunch on the chips for hours, but you will never feel satisfied. It leaves you craving something with actual substance, some real meat. And once you are done with the chips, you realise your hands are filthy, grimy, and greasy and all you want to do is wash it off.
---
Fallout 76 is a bag of Lays potato chips.
---
Melee players can be among the hardest hitters in a queen fight. Still, they need her on the ground to deliver it.
---
Its the reason i started to change my melee-only main a long time ago. Because i didn't know exactly what i wanted at this i first tried a shotgun setup. After that, offensiv commando and heavy. And much later, after the wastelanders update, a perk set for crossbow/bows.
---
Its been the day i installed the perk loadouts mod, that changed the way i play him to this day. Cause i could finally play all of those weapons with practically the most essential perks for it on each set. Id highly recommend this mod.
---
So don't worry, you gonna belong to the hardest hitters as well. And with your str you can think about an additional shotgun or heavy loadout for when shes in the air.
---
Same and it normally at a pivotal point just getting into power armour for Queen. Just filled all the troffs in project paradise. Etc.
---
Yesterday all my displays and cabinets were empty..?
---
I assumed they’d disabled everything again, but will check my stash and try to assign items again.. I might just have your problem/bug....
---
Try swapping out the skin on just the arms.
---
Might be the same thing that was happening with the Hellfire PA skin.
---
Might as well try &gt;:)
---
I'm finishing my 100% plan completion quest. 11 more learnable plans to go. I'm going to get the last two rare clothing items I'm missing. I'm going to craft and scrap radium rifles. I'm going to be doing a massive giveaway of thousands of hoarded known plans ranging from every event since beta. Going to sell some legendary weapons I don't want. Overall just enjoy the fruits of my labor.
---
And that’s why they write „Hey, we‘ve done that“ when they actually didn’t?
---
they want to corner the cork market. 
---
i dunno, ultra light mods for combat armor?
---
But of course it does.
---
Ty
---
Quite some high level players (including me) got bored with the usual cookie cutter builds and rolled a gunslinger for fun. Western revolver is the weapon of choice for most, so there is demand for .44. I buy it when running low, because caps are easy enough to get and farming lead/steel/acid isn't that exciting.
---
Well what did u do before legends?
---
I was happy I didn’t have to actually focus on leveling any more. It gets hard to higher you level and starts to feel like work.
---
My guess is that they need to soundproof Atlas against the Scorchbeast sonic attack, although it's easy to forget that the awful bluegreen attack from the mutated bats is supposed to be a sound attack, since we shouldn't be able to see it, but are instead routinely blinded by it.
---
At least they aren't selling boiled water for 20 caps each and near empty fusion cores for 100 caps.
---
The better inventory mod filters all the keys out by default I believe.
---
"here's your key ring"
---
-changes the locks-
---
Lol
---
If u find the right spot you can walk to Tamriel
---
There are 3 gnomes on top of a trailer at Monongah min IIRC. It's where you get the key for the safe.
---
Ok.... OhhHH!
---
Im on PC (gamepass)
---
You don’t like having Melody Larkin scream at you about swarmin vermin?
---
I've a gold resource at my camp, and use it, along with cloth, to make civil war suits to sell to vendors. It's a chunk of my income.
---
wait those are good?
---
yes. And i go loud and proud. no stealth, hacking or lockpicking.
---
my go to phrase in silos' where your legs at stoopid assaultron' and ' shut up Mr Gutsy'
---
PS there are repaired mainframe cores just lying around for you to pick up. After a few runs it is an easy 20minutes to launch.
---
With this particular issue it could have been something like adding the content into the game and forgetting to activate it by switching a 0 to a 1. Or s false to a true. Its like there used to be a few legendary weapons that don't drop anymore (are now legacy) I imagine to keep them from dropping they just turned something to a 0 or false for dropping but those who have them keep them.
---
Why do something rational like reporting bugs directly to bethesda when they can start a circle jerk on reddit and just assume the community reps read every single thread?  What, do you want, a bug to actually get fixed or something?
---
You can trust me 😉  
---
[I did it earlier!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i51zs4/finally_completed_i_am_become_death_on_my_alt/)
---
Not the same story but still, high levels preying. I'm level 50, I just reinstalled the game and I didn't know I'd be wanted if I picked a lock. I wanted to buy those sweet ammos but the guy's vending machine was inside his house and I couldn't get in, so I opened the door and boom: wanted, 10 caps.
---
I bought the ammos I needed and fast traveled to Foundation. While I was AFK for personal reasons, the guy and his friends (all levels ~350/400) killed me, took all my 5 hours junk and just kept on killing me. I couldn't do anything so I had to leave the game just to play.
---
The brotherhood is in the business of harvesting cork, right now business is booming, each one of you fallout 1st players owes me 100 bulk of cork, and I want my cork!
---
Really, 10 vault steel per day ?
---
The rewards are so mediocre it's almost insulting. The caps I can sell my junk for are worth more than the shit this event gives me.
---
There was a RadBear with a combat knife in Vault 94. There’s another with a cigarette in its mouth and a hunting rifle in the missile silos.
---
Prick and Morty.......Good stuff.....Good stuff......Also chefs kiss for that clutch teabag.....Truly inspirational
---
My mules are the Collector and Armoretta can you guess what they have on them.
---
Carrots. Lots of carrots.
---
Can you actually imagine the shitstorm if Bethesda would come out and say nobody gets event rewards because there wasn't enough donated, lol.
---
And they'd still do it, because Bethesda.
---
My game eventually just crashes, losing everything
---
Across the river left of pleasant valley and over the fence by the deer picture in the mire
---
Yep. But of course consoles can't get it, and many people I've mentioned it to on PC don't want to deal with the hassle or (nonexistant) risk of installing mods.
---
Christ, you stop that. Don't give them ideas.
---
Don't repair the anti air defenses it helps a lot. But it was happening before the update a lot just worse now.
---
At this point I wouldn't put it past them, to be honest.
---
It used to happen all the time on rad rumble and line in sand before the last patch there are multiple posts on it just seems to be affecting more people now. Still needs sorting.
---
It does yeah, I managed to do 100 levels in 7 days. 
---
So if it gets slightly harder as I get higher levels after level 600 I dont mind.
---
See I was going to take a break but I’m not as good at playing games as I once was, so I’ll be crap again by time it comes back around and I won’t know what’s happening haha but maybe I drop down a bit and just to the basics e.g gold bullion dailies for the day, camp ally daily and any events that pop up while I’m on. Normally play about 4-5 hours a night but will prob drop down to 1hr.
---
From what I've heard, it happens when you add anything to or remove anything from your stash in a server where your CAMP wasn't able to be placed.
---
Everywhere if you shoot things with a bloatfly modded syringer
---
Damn, imagine if someone actually did what they asked. RIP
---
Known issue. Some how didn't get fixed with the major "update" we just had. Go figure, right?
---
Yeah the level up one was a pain for me to do. Unless there was a few SBQ events happening then it seemed to take a bit for me to level up in the time I played each evening.
---
plus, with Gun Fu on, you get to feel like John Wick.
---
Sure does buddy, sure does.
---
Damn I’m not surprised :|
---
Those goddamn nocturnal patch fork -_-
---
Pretty much just plodded along roaming around aimlessly haha was hoping there’s something else to do that I wasn’t aware of.
---
Speaking of lore. The current Appalachian BOS only used T-51 suits of armor. Which can be seen from the numerous bodies littering the brotherhood occupied areas. However the BOS paint is only for the T-60. 
---
I get that its because of Fallout4 but. You couldn't go a tiny bit out of the way to make lore friendly variations for the BOS Paint. Pretty much every Fo4 modder has already done it for you. What gives?
---
I'm already weaning myself off. I mostly log in now for S.C.O.R.E and a SBQ fight. I've bought most of the bullion items I want, not much else to do.
---
Can you explain how you craft bloodied weapons?
---
It's actually for Bethesda, so they can stick it in their ears and ignore our suggestions.
---
Garrahan HQ, down in the lab area where you learn how to craft Excavator armor. There's been a frame and several pieces every time I've been there.
---
Bro.  Thanks for the tip.  You may have just saved me from several future headaches! :)
---
I run a pistol build on a secondary. It's fun, and I can swap between bloodied and not, gunslinger and guerilla. My rifle char sure kills faster, and there is a reason that is my main and I run pistols on a second.
---
Bloodied for me is a swap of basically 3 perk cards. I swap Serendipity for Grim Reapers Sprint or Better Criticals, Nerd Rage for usually points in Demo expert and Radicool for Sun Kissed 1.
---
Equipment set ups are:
---
Bloodied explosive 38 pipe, bloodied ffr 38 pipe, bloodied prime 10mm, bloody non primed 10mm, unyielding armors (bloody guerrilla). Fastest killer, bullet hose. I spray a lot of 38. 
---
Bloodied gauss pistol, two shot explosive auto 38 (for tagging), bloodied plasma flamer, unyielding armor (bloody gunslinger) ... I tend to not use this much; the gauss overkill when it hits but that's infuriating with vats. If I want to use the gauss, a TS is fine.
---
Quad gamma, two shot gauss pistol, tse auto 38 (tagging), stealth suit (full health gunslinger ... gamma is fu here as the suit protects) ... can also bring out furious and vamp plasma flsmers ... fair amount of ADS and less VATS with this setup so I swap some cards, gamma and plasmas for boss burndown. I play this the second most and have a set of troubleshooter armor for encryptid.
---
Prime zealots 10mm,  other 10mm and auto lasers, various sentinel armors (full health guerilla) ... I dont use this much but if bloody or unyielding (or both) get nerfed I've got this ready.
---
They need to adjust the stacking int on unyielding, it is too good. Until they do, that's where I spend most of my time 
---
I've got junkies stuff but I usually don't bother.
---
Enclave scum
---
those pinned notes and maps aren't going to stay up in the wall by themselves y'know..
---
You can make it risk free if you don't really use it to gain an advantage.
---
Ah see i don't seem to be having a problem until i go into a vending machine or look at the legendary run, its incredibly slow
---
How?
---
My SCORE board is disgraceful for lag when I try hover over a tile to unlock it.
---
It's not the flies. I have a meat pile replacer and its still lagging.
---
Seems only energy weapon ash piles are affected and causing it.
---
That's always been a thing with fallout... The base game loads first then all else. Sometimes only the base loads... That can be fun xD
---
Raising strength and using melee is a good way for newbies to start since ammo is scarce. Also you will need carry weight.
---
I don't think you will get banned if you make this base. People use glitches all the time to build.
---
The only thing I’ve got to buy is prob the farming tiles, I’ve got all the SS armour with mods I want, gauss mini gun and shot gun with the mods I wanted plus a few other things. I’ve currently got about 3k gold too lol
---
They could have a stash box on the console or PC itself, and just verify what was in after logging out and back in to stop hackers. Thus freeing up the server.
---
Its always something new with this game huh
---
if you are on PC there are 2 great mods that help a lot with inventory management (in adventure mode, it's not working in NW)  
---

---
Major update? I thought a rogue developer just decided to sabotage the code and they had no clue what to do to fix it.
---
100% just trying to get me to waste my time, sad to say it worked, cause the border is still there
---
Yeah but it feels like this is another level
---
[I've been using this site dailey since I found it.](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html?)
---
[An interactive map with lots of customisation options.](https://fo76map.com/) I'm not sure how uo to date some of the info is but the basics still are.
---
Im not sure, needed an excuse to put his name down i guess. Still love the backpack though
---
The problem is most likely: patch breaking something (again).
---
Dear Paladin because we are clueless
---
Yes I completely understand that the Brotherhood are coming no matter what. The small events however I hope they fail if we don't do it. Failure at community event adds immersion and makes it so more people get involved the next time one comes around because they will here that they missed out last time. 
---
Warframe did it with permanent losses to the community and it creates a lived in world. We can see where we failed everyday and now the community gets involved to not let it repeat.
---
Good points, I sadly agree with you.  Also, I just want to state for the record, that Bethesda's slowly becoming my least favorite gaming company... maybe even overshadowing EA and Activision.  At least those guys' products work, and they fix their bugs.
---
What could you give me in exchange?
---
Lol I think the last update was only to fix adrenaline and piss off a lot of players with the camp fixes
---
They do, but look at the perk investment. How many more cards do you have to use so that pipe revolver catches up with a lever action? Are those better spent elsewhere?
---
I constantly had to use unground glitch to finished defense at the munition factory because the game is a buggy mess. I don't think they will ban unless your duping items. Hell all the people duping munition factory ammo producers inside their camps, which should be impossible....is still happening YEARS LATER.
---
I am sure you will be fine.
---
Telegraph pylons. Flat ground under them and it keeps you in a boundary.
---
Hey that's my GT.......Why you gotta spotlight me like that dog?......lol
---
The skeezy hearts bed is too: my characters' feet hang off the end. The Fancy Bed seems the right size though, might go back to it.
---
Hiya Bethesda, u/BethesdaGameStudios_ would be nice to see you guys acknowledge quality of life issues around inventory, make a statement about story connecting FO76 to the Amazon show, and lastly address the wall construction/swap from window to wall/door etc.
---
Additionally any comments or statements about account database sharing between Xbox/PS4/PC account sync to keep players engaged no matter what platform they’re on, I think is due. It should be a larger discussion for Bethesda that also includes ESO.
---
Thank you.
---
Its under gallery and in the fallout 76 section
---
I'm fairly new to the game but I might have something you could have, what's your psn
---
Wait can people just take stuff out of your trade without you approving or something?
---
I got no clue why people even cared about adrenaline. I one hit everything. It didn't matter with or without the perk. I care about building as its the only endgame we got besides the two *one* bosses. As they even failed at delivering the second boss.
---
hope its going to work out for you and im looking forward to see what you come up with👍🏼
---
lol
---
You already got tips, so I might just add one: once you reach level 5, enable pacifist mode in game settings (off by default). 
---
You definitley will hit other players by accident during events and don't want to start pvp when you are not ready for it.
---
Brotherhood of Scrap?
---
Patch notes are kind of a list. When implemented on the servers they HAVE TO check this list. What’s working, what’s not? THEN correct the patch notes and publish them. If they are not able to fix all these issues and don’t have a clue in professional workflows they’re just incompetent. Nothing else.
---
(Although I understand the complexity of such a game, I also know the marketing guys thinking everything is easy.)
---
Over the last double xp weekend I went from 280 to 364. I reached my legendary perk card goal, and finished the legendary run a few days ago The only motivation I’d have for power leveling would be the points for legendary perk I guess.
---
Honestly not something I'ver seen mentioned on this sub until now, but I've only been playing since Wastelanders. Regardless, for me atleast, it never happened until patch 21.
---
What would the stealth player have done, once you initiated trading ?
---
It was never safe to begin with ...
---
Im not a petty guy, but this would’ve been enough to make me nuke their bases lol
---
Sometimes I drink and server hop. I have an extra set of everything now for sale on my vending machine.
---
Everything but the backpack. I only have one of those.
---
stupidityscoop
---
Honestly it feels like they have put in difficulties on purpose. The UI should be simple, this is the ammo you have and how much you have of it, choose one, buy/sell it with a slider, done. How is that hard, lazy development or they’re working with a system that makes easy development hard.
---
Exactly. Trial and error is the way to go with mobile builds. When you put effort and time in it, you can even build 100% budget towers on single foundations, that can be replaced like the 1st tent.
---
We’re literally surrounded by junk. Who needs to rob people for it?!
---
Bruh
---
Could you elaborate? I havent touched syringers except for when i have to for quests. Is it similar to how you can get nuclear waste from killing things using ultracite gatling
---
I don't even attempt to take the munitions factory on public servers anymore...too much hassle. If I can be arsed enough to play for awhile on my private server, I'll take the factory over there and let it do it's thing while I run around doing whatever.
---
Last time I did gunslinger, a pipe revolver with a stock did count as a pistol but had the range of a decent sniper. Not sure if it still does but if you need range to pick off targets, that might help
---
Hey - the ammo exchanger seems fixed to some degree.
---
Unyielding, 15% less dmg when blocking is way better.
---
Sent/cav is only a 75% chance of dmg reduction. Blocking works every time and can be matched with melee blocking perk to provide guaranteed 90% dmg reduction
---
Take your pick of 3rd perks based on your build (endurance/agility/strength usually)
---
Thats very good, I'm looking forward to the next double xp
---
Thank you! I will try that.
---
How in the flip...?
---
This needs more upvotes. This will definitely be faster than gathering golf balls, at least for me. Is it a single fork per, or more?
---
Yes, I do it more times a day. Just server hop if you got the "Slow your horses".
---
Hell ya. I still intend on using those days to their fullest. I saved a bunch of lunch boxes to make the most of the next one.
---
The only time I ended up in workshop PVP it was by some griefer using some exploit to one shot me.  I just left.
---
Mole miner on a stick.
---
Dude if Bethesda won’t ban the extremely obvious exploiters in nuclear winter id say you’re fine with a small, commonly used building glitch
---
My pvp char is at lvl 51 and i only attack players above lvl 200...
---
Anyway ur on PC? Im always up for a challenge.
---
I wish you guys all the best, looks good! Subscribed
---
Don’t forget he lies 🤣 tells you it’s the only equipment they have and when you bring it back he says they have spares 🤣
---
Mom! What are you doing on Reddit?!
---
You would have the whole server lined up at Mumbles desk 24/7.
---
Then duped presents would be even more valuable
---
I finished a week ago, im still doing some of the run but mainly going for the treasury notes even though I have well over 200 notes.
---
I have 2 legit B2525 fixers and several other variants such as a B5015.  All drops in game.  At 3K hours, I've got plenty of god rolls that I can't use for my build.  I'm sure I am not alone.  You might be the one who is clueless.  Assumptions you know.
---
I'm reading this while watching Rick and Morty lmao
---
If you played a Nuclear Winter match and then go into Adventure mode, borders get disabled.  It has something do with scaling the Borders between the modes.
---
Yea it's quite annoying that you'll miss out on the few bits of content added if you don't daily grind the challenges. They should aim to make everything weekly so we can play through everything when were free rather than bit by bit day by day
---
Let's not forget about the "Red shift" chinese PA too, This is at the least the third time this has happened lmao.
---
Well hidden...
---
Under the giant green "free" icon that won't ever leave the atom shop unless you claim the stuff.
---
Can't believe I found it, thank you sir
---
So, the dupers would benrfit more ftom dupeing the presents? No thanks.
---
My thoughts. Not sure how something this obvious got so many upvotes. Maybe tomorrow I'll make a PSA telling everyone stimpaks can heal you. 🙃
---
It happened to me last night. But wait, there is more ! 
---
Add a SB corpse that jumps on the piles of meat and ashes with all the explosive weapons of players, and you get the vision of Hell I got. 
---
I swear at that moment, Time itself reversed and my fps rate was below zero.
---
calibrated shocks , Batteries included, travelling pharmacy (must haves)
---
bear arms, strong back, Thru Hiker, Pack rat
---
play around with those depending on your style/build
---
high Str is required for decent PA with carry ability.
---
I use X01 and 2 heavies constantly. no problems.
---
Cork is good for both acoustic and thermal insulation. That's likely what the Brotherhood will use it for.
---
That or start up a winery.
---
I hope you get to read this but to do this you need to have bought the game through bethesda website instead of steam, right?
---
It is telling me that the trial period is over.
---
What's your farming route?
---
It could be fork... collect 250 million forks....
---
Billingsley would be mad a bit...
---
I did Radiation Rumble, there was more players there than normal. Everything was going smooth until one player was shooting their tesla rifle non-stop which made that event have some serious lag. 20 minutes after it was over I was still trying to collect the loot but kept passing up the meat piles because I was rubber banding so much.
---
You're assuming I have a single friend
---
There is a train car just north of the Whitesprings station that spawns a cranberry and a dark every 24 hours.
---
How expensive are the shocks to maintain? I'm getting a bit tired of committing mole miner genocide when my armor starts falling apart
---
No worries, glad I could help. Just make sure to pass the knowledge forward.
---
Dm me yours
---
Yesterday I saw myself doing way too much damage than usual (like the day before). I usually shot from 100-500 depends on buffs, distance etc.
---
And that time I did like 2000 per shot and the SBQ went down pretty fast. (Guess others werer doing damage as well).
---
It looks like the dmg mitigation (70%) can be absent if the server is overloaded and the event freshly started.
---
THIS! I just spent 9 friggin hours playing and kept getting 1 star drops, I think two 2 star and one 3 star, the 3 star being the only decent find of the day and it's a junkies faster swing tire iron, the rest was scrip but after those 9 friggin hours, I logged out still short collecting 15 scrip. I feel mentally exhausted and didn't even have any fun actually playing the game how I wanted to due to grinding the chore of the CHANCE to find legendaries to collect my daily scrip, let alone any 3 star that would drop anything higher than a 1 star. Yep. Good times (not!).
---
If you don’t want the crappy item, who will want to pay for it?  Very few exceptions
---
Im not sure one exists outside of atom shop purchases which are not tradeable. Im not aware of any in game ones
---
I swear if I have to restart from scratch over this Bethesda
---
Lol, what´s up with this response? if people want help they'll ask for it and get it. I routinely help out lower level players, nothing over the top, 20 stims, 20 radaways, 1000 ammo of whatever they are using. Then sometimes craft a full set of armor for their level with deep pocketed mods and the occasional non legendary fixer that suits their level.
---
Wait, so, somehow they fucked the coding so bad that a cosmetic paint scheme causes you to take MORE rad damage?
---
How in the hell.
---
You doing it right. 
---
That was my first build. I broke a stealth armor and it worked pretty decent.
---
No they cant but what they could do was check to see if you had a decent amount of junk on you. If you did then they would use exploits to start PVP and take it.
---
This happened to me once with the excavator PA. I forgot what skin it’s called nuts it’s an older one. I went to mine ore in radiation rumble and died almost instantly. I don’t use PA except for rad zones so it was particularly annoying. Next time I did the event it seemed to be fine.
---
Are you saying in 900+ hours you never tried claiming a Workshop? There's literally a pop up every single time you take one that tells you that you're open to PvP in the Workshop area if you do.
---
Good to know about the legendary run timeline. Think I'm ahead so should finish it all. Kinda wonder if the BOS challenges will happen tho.. Nobody seems to care and the rewards aren't great, I dropped off some steel but can't see myself grinding out cork...
---
I’m calling it: if it happens it’ll be in the form of a 500 atom shop item
---
not even worth a mention. PA durability just lasts so long. you will prob repair once every 3 months if you play regularly.
---
Bless your wholesome heart and may the light of Atom shine your path.......Glad to see higher level cool peeps.......It's the best part of this game that's not an actual part of the game itself......It just works
---
Depends I happily hoover up rubbish legendaries if the price is right so I can max out scrip daily with minimal effort, to afford modules for my own rubbish legendaries I can't sell XD
---
There’s the ones from last Halloween event. Fairly Rare loot drop as well as the outfit.
---
I'd save up to 1k, then only buy what you need to to turn in more. Then spend it all when we get a sale
---
Also please increase the cap limit to 100,000!!!!
---
No I didnt Loot any lootbags. And even if its bugged you would never drop a full power armour chassie by dying
---
Let me just check how many modules I have, 5 mins later after scrolling past 30+ hornwight keys found them!
---
They have more tank, don't you worry.
---
Dang. I'll have to find those soon, I've been looking forward to having usable power armor.
---
Yeah completely agree with you there
---
I found like 1000 ultracite .44 rounds in a paper bag.
---
I don't want to defend the shitshow that is the latest patch in any way. As a builder, this hurts bad. But i could imagine they pressed that wall "fix" thru now cause it could result in much bigger problems when the planned instanced camp system gets implemented.
---
Thanks, but I don't need more range with the western: an aligned long barrel adds 120 to the standard 120 range if I am not mistaken so it even exceeds the range of the BoS recon rifle. Crack shot would add another 30% range but most fights are mid range anyway, not a sneak build.
---
TY!  I honestly love the community so much in this game.  They are amazing.
---
Holy c\*\*\*\* That´s a whole lot for a whole little. You would then need 1.000.000 Gold scrap to buy the SS jetpack.
---
What kinda exploits can they do?
---
Ah Ok. I started playing well after that. Thanks for the heads up
---
Re: 2 gpus
---
https://www.dokwiki.ibik.ru/en/v2_25/core/faq/faq_config
---
I'd try not using the launcher or the steam interface but starting the game by calling the .exe directly.
---
Like could that guys friend kill you while in the trade menu itself?
---
Circlejerk and memes is The proper way to report bugs....
---
I read the workshop PVP notification around launch and promptly forgot it. And never read it again, because I thought I knew what it said. Then just after survival mode was dropped I got killed at a workshop (one and only time). I was shocked, confused. Was this dude a hacker how can he kill me I didn't even hit back.
---
It just works.....
---
Me: what does?
---
Same......Hope I run across you out in the wild one day......Be prepared for a photo op because I always take a pic when I meet someone awesome
---
Yeah rifles need a buff, it's why .45 and 5.56 rounds specifically sell like butter along with the occasional 10mm submachine user... It's because... They do so little damage so that ammo runs out, yes that's it!
---
PSA 10mm submachine gun has way higher drum mag capacity, if you want a rifle with higher mag capacity.
---
In my 1300+ hours of playtime, I just discovered a huge unmarked area at the very bottom of the map in cranberry bog. You cant build a camp there, but its got several building and even a locked door with a pinpad for a secret code. It was really cool getting to explore a whole new area after seeing almost everything else in the game. Last week I also discovered that there is a tiny shack just to the west above grafton dam with a unique triangle bell you can interact with to make it ring. Just a neat little thing.
---
Thanks for the tip. So I was thinking of trying for a plasma caster to try it out later but I am looking for bloody. So what you are saying is wait for the effect  to drop on a random legendary enemy or quest reward then do it?
---
I dont think its possible. If they did that it would break world pre combines. Rendering every tree and such as a settlement item. Main reason the scrap mods for fallout 4 caused performance problems
---
Hey I clean the Dorito crumbs from my chair everyday bro.....lol
---
As long as you have a solid weapon already, I would just hit it hard rolling 3* armor. Most of it will be junk, but you'll probably get one or two pieces worth using temporarily.
---
Then save up your scrip for the next sale.
---
Rolling good armor takes a long long time. Putting together a whole set, especially matching, takes even longer. Learn to enjoy the grind and maybe flirt with mumbles a bit to gain her favor.
---
8 hours? I can see why theres alot of burned out people,  I can barely get 2 hours in each day. Wish I had that much time.
---
Buying an icon also equips that icon.
---
Butch and Sundance,  wanted from The Crater  to Point Pleasant.  Put together a posse and chase them down.
---
Do you know where it drops or if you have one?
---
No, what they do is peep your junk, kill you, loot your bag and server hop.  
---
I will never forget during week 1, post beta, my husband and I took the junk yard for the black titanium to make excavator armor for the mission and this guy came down, level 50 (which was crazy at the time) and he took the workshop, killed us both and looted every bit of junk from my corpse.  Then he inboxed me to come buy my junk from him.  Then told me it was free if I pledged for the Enclave.  😂😂😂😂😂 
---
I usually give ammo for free but the big ammo like 50 cal, and 40 I would charge .5 caps per piece, or a trade for aid.
---
☝️ AS this gent mention. It’s a glitch carried back from NW and placement of survival tent. It also been YouTube a few times like a year ago now. 
---
Just reload your game and the border will be back.  Only attention needed right now is the high lag spikes from mass meat piles and server disconnects
---
SAME!  💜💜💜
---
Im not expecting any graphical upgrade thats for sure. Im not naive enough to believe Bethesda would do anything but the bare minimum.
---
Im just hoping and preying on the load times being faster.
---
Whats wrong with my name?
---
Arsebandit is a old inherited family name going on 10 generations now.
---
I like this cause I think the jetpack is super ugly. Its bulky and doesnt go with any outfits, so I purposefully swap servers to get it to go invisible lol
---
I think you're right. Did Line in the Sand twice last night.
---
First time, there were only 4 of us there and we were all using TSE rifles or shotguns. Zero problem, despite dozens and dozens of meat piles.
---
Second time, about 6 people, some using Tesla's - terrible, unplayable actually. I had to FT away.
---
So .... stick to ballistic weapons
---
Hahaha of course we have, supreme leader Kim Jong Todd.
---
Does not drop. Might come back next Halloween event most likely. 
---
Best bet is to use the trading sub to try and score one. I only got one and sry but I intend on keeping it.
---
Nocturnal Bloodied with only rolling pins, shovels, rippers, or wood axes (no Grognak). Bog wanderer mask. It's the Jason Vorheese roleplay.
---
I think a more reasonable and simpler explanation is that they have a (small) ‘team’ of people dedicated to the ongoing work for the game and they don’t know what they’re doing, don’t dog food and we’re already unfamiliar with the engine and it’s quirks - the ‘veterans’ May have bee brought in to do Wastelanders but they’ve since moved to other primary projects such as Starfield and ESO6, leaving this game with whatever’s left.
---
MA!, Gramps forgot to take his meds again!
---
I have claimed many of them, but most of the times nobody tries to take it. Also many times I just take them because dailies. Always playing this game in pacifist mode and thought from day 0 that it also applies to Workshops too.
---
thats exactly the kind if stuff i was looking for thanks
---
no idea how i managed to forget about nocturnal here lol
---
Thats fine I wouldn't want to take your only one anyway
---
I haven't checked Watoga High School yet but I'll look in there, thanks for the tip
---
Wu Tang says to Protect yo neck.......Little did we know that they also meant Protect your junk too
---
Same, also from SA.
---
Thankfully most of the exploits have been shut down by bethesda now. There used to be many ways to do it. To be honest I live on a private server now so I'm not sure if there are still exploits out there but yes during the first year they could kill you in many ways even while you had pacifist on and even if you were in a trade menu. 
---
One that sticks in my head (because it's the one that got me) was to have a low level join your team(I enjoy helping low levels, so this was something I did often) that low level would be secretly working with a team of griefers. As soon as they knew you were carrying decent junk(like just finished an SBQ fight) the low level with initiate PVP with them which instantly meant you were able to be killed.
---
This on can't be used anymore thankfully.
---
God this game is a mess LOL (still love it though)
---
Damn I must be an outlier cause I loved RaRa. Her quest was annoying, but I've always had a soft spot for kids. I tyink her dynamic with Gail is adorable, and Gail is the best character in the game, second only maybe to Grahm.
---
I don’t understand. Is there a limit on how the number of bullets you can have for sale?
---
Pretty sure the lag starts as the meat pile build up.  Tested this at a line in the sand event. 
---
Look at one direction with em and super laggy as hell, console fan working over time!...
---
Stayed in same spot but turn 180 the opposite way from meat piles and felt like the lag was gone. Until I turn back around to shoot the next wave.
---
Not only small but also a very limp dick energy radiating from people like that
---
You gotta add me you seem like you'd be awesome to adventure with
---
I'll typically make myself a good hidey hole somewhere in my defense and if I seeanyone over level 100 I'll just start tearing it all down so they don't get anything of any use.
---
In the past 3 days, I donated around 8K steel, mostly from scrapped weapons. 
---
I kept all cork I could find and now I have 220 (!) cork waiting in my stash. All the golf balls were gone on all servers I joined and there weren't many pipe weapons I looted to begin with. I have serious doubts 200M cork is even possible given that there might be only 100k players across all platforms.
---
You've been able to put more than 800 in as long as i can remember I load mine up with 15000 5mm every few days
---
Had this as well yesterday, I've never seen the queen die so fast!
---
A dragon only build that’d be hilarious
---
All the best in finding one tho bud. The trading market your best bet and you may luck out
---
It seemed mighty suspicious that Pete only wanted to chop the women's meat, come to think of it...
---
i'm lvl 160+ and while I was busy defending my workshop, some lvl 120+ in CSA  snuck up behind me and guass shotgunned me in the back.  I don't really bother claiming/keeping workshops unless I need fusion cores, so i'm not gonna aggro with someone being a dick, just to keep something I don't want.  
---
I play pacifist but this whole claim for score, is driving more pvp as people have to claim workshops to get it, and on busy servers they can all be claimed when you log in, I generally just claim one, do the protect event, demolish everything and leave it ready for the next person, some people just have no patience I guess.
---
Holotapes as well. It's horrible using terminals and having to scroll through all the tapes to get to your most recent one. Even a page down button would be great.
---
It's true.  Even the Legendary Run screen has become super laggy since the most recent patch (not sure if just me though).
---
Thats what I'm talking about, you destroy the initial game for someone, just because youre bored or want to be some daddy or something. If they ask for it, no problem, than its their own fault, but I have seen a lot of guys offering stuff in my low levels.
---
Technically this was a fairly recent change, I think Wastelanders brought it in
---
Good on you for all that steel but ye I don't think there's enough ways to get cork for that amount to be donated!
---
I respond to that in the same way I did on getting mugged on Peckham Rye LOL (with a load of expletives)
---
That area in the bog was added for wastelanders, for whatever reason.  I had my camp nearby and was worried about getting clobbered by the no build zone when it dropped.
---
Is it a survivor story of he dies in the end? ;-)
---
I had to double check I got this week's free item and saw them there.
---
Maybe Fallout 4 will have some free items as well.
---
What platform you on im just on taking people advise and uninstalled game and reinstalling now I used the original game disc before will do over net today see of improves anything.
---
They are only worth 2k caps MAX. Plans have been duped to hell, not just the Christmas present ones.
---
Another nocturnal. But with knuckles (or a similar unarmed weapon) throwing knifes, maybe marine armour. Make a batman build!
---
Cool.
---
Thousand times yes to this idea.
---
Ha karma counter doesn't go brrrrr
---
Edgy
---
Well I mean you can SPEND 1000 scrip, so that’s 100.
---
Which one? The free battle royale or actual fortnite, where you fight zombies?
---
It feels like the copy pasted the Ammo Forge from Fallout 3 but then told a good coder to make it as user unfriendly as possible.
---
I haven't played melee since Oblivion. After shotguns got nerfed into the ground, I picked up a hammer. Lots of fun in F76, it's actually OP imo, my main problem is the laaag, mother of lag. Even tried bloody melee, took the unyielding gear of and I still one punch most things. That is the one punch I actually land after lag took the others.
---
WooooooW.......What a dick move......lol......So I'm a noob since the game came out on gamepass but I've pretty much kept up with the game since before it came out because I was anticipating it......I won't go into bashing Bethesda but I remember that was this one thing I kept hearing about right around the time they announced 1st where I guess people could like pickpocket you kinda like older fallout or Skyrim......Was this happening for a while before they fixed it? Cause I was seeing videos where people's whole inventory would be emptied and they could leave you like butt naked basically......lol
---
Can’t list everything but heres a video that goes over the major bugs. 
---
https://youtu.be/o6W9lKiHzPg
---
In all fairness they won't. People duping dozens of explosive gatling plasmas and making hundreds or thousands of dollars reselling them got suspended for a week and let off with their third "final warning" in a row, without even an inventory or character wipe. NW aimbots are free as birds, and fly like them too. People who used exploits to get to score rank 100 in the first 3 days of the season are untouched. Performing any exploit in this game is 100% safe at this point. It's just a matter of whether you want to continue playing knowing you're cheating
---
the free battle royale
---
[https://falloutfirst.com/](https://falloutfirst.com/)
---
its ok your updates dont either
---
i imagine youre spending more time reloading and repairing your weapons than actually fighting but if i get hands on a good dragon ill give it a shot :D
---
Whole game has been broken with this patch they have stealth patched load of stuff im also dying constantly from now where. Rad rumble and line in sand are unplayable. It's a trap still has spawn issues as does fly swatter. The game crashes constantly at the most vital times.
---
I was on my way to go sell off my excess junk to a vendor bot when a workshop of mine got an event for a Scorchbeast attack. Silly me didn't drop off my junk and decided to take the detour. Whilst there a level 400+ guy arrived and helped me with the Scorchbeast. After the fight I give him the thumbs up for the assistance and he mows me down with his heavy weapons before I even have a chance to react. He didn't even take over the workshop, seemed like he just murderered me for the Scorchbeast junk, but did end up taking everything I was carrying at the time.
---
I've had no good experiences with PvP in this game. Nuclear Winter isn't too bad, but honestly me and my not-so-trusty-when-it-comes-to-PvP bow want to live in peace.
---
I honest to god couldn't name a single material that even has cork in it. Reeeeeally hoping a duper helps those days.
---
damn man i have to see if there is some apparel thats good for a batman build and im all in for it :D thanks man
---
Would it be under resources? Check the Brahmin it might give you the option to change design
---
yea i know i dont play anymore but i watch news every now and then to see if they wanna make the game function with good updates without pissing everyone off
---
I had it happen only once in one violent night. Idk why the rest didn't happen. I had a line in the sand and the world was shutting down in 5 mins. Collected all loot in a hurry, no fps drops
---
Naw, your full of shit.
---
If Fallout 5 ends up as an online building simulator they can shuff it up their a\*\* and im done with the franchise.
---
I dont give two sh\*\*s about bethesda and all their other games only Fallout is what matters to me.
---
It is always appropriate to end an animals suffering.
---
Spoiler alert : Bethesda is never going to manage to do that haha.
---
Imagine being level 300 and needing back up on a level 45 (no offense)
---
Had this in Uranium Fever a couple times too, I play on Xbox One X and the game straight up freezes for like five seconds, hopefully they’re able to do something as soon as
---
That's why I was thinking marine. That's the closet look I could think of haha
---
The same way we do ... fast travel
---
the dark colour would probably work well i agree :D
---
That's my MO. Sometimes I leave a scene for them. Like letters and an arrow saying Free Candy on the junkyard building or a circus wagon setup to look like a porn set (thanks to the sleepy bed for inspiring that one.)
---
Any solution yet?
---
I think(I stand to be corrected) but that only happened on PC. It took a couple of weeks for bethesda to patch it. I've seen videos of it and it was insane. They didnt even need to be very close to the victim. You see someone run past all loaded up with gear and by the time they were nearing the end of render distance they would be completely naked.
---
Ya I’ve gotten it a few timea
---
Well there's less to it. Fortnite players all have the same stats, guns, etc. It was a game built from the ground up. Fallout 76 is a ported version of fallout 4 that they tried to make into a mmo. Fallout 4 was so buggy, the modding community had to patch it themselves.
---
&gt;Better developers.
---
Obsidian...
---
The Brotherhood aren't assholes in the time of FO76. They are legitimate good guys. They become assholes after killing the master which is like 100 years after 76.
---
They should seriously just remove ash/goo piles completely.
---
i have no idea what i‘m seeing here, but color me intrigued.
---
That's xxxPu$$y$mA$Rxxx to you bub.
---
You don't need to play NW.
---
Even before they added the extra dailies you only need to do 5/6 challenges to get the gold star challenge.
---
I have also noticed that you can farm the repeatable twice much easier than getting a NW match and doing bush wookie or whatever.
---
Just compensate.
---
I've been playing fairly casually, i haven't really farmed score except for the double weekend, my run will be done in probably 3 days. Way ahead of schedule. Haven't done a single NW challenge.
---
My main is Vats crit pistol build. They could use a little damage buff yes, but I have no issue with any enemy. Events like RR and Scorched Earth are dominated by bloodied commandos and heavy gunners anyway, so I just get ore (because no one else will...) and focus on the queen.
---
What I really want is a viable energy pistol/revolver. Or give us a receiver that has a low fire rate but good damage. Now I can only use my laser pistol in the forest pretty much. Like my Medics Western Revolver does 1200 crit damage. Anti Armour laser pistol only 400 if lucky. Both also have the +50% crit damage effect. It is just weird.
---
that actually makes sense. well lads, yall got the bottom of the it and even faster than bethesda‘s own devs, again. i‘ll leave my tesla in the inventory during LITS and RR now.
---
None. They eat too much budget and do fuck all anyways.
---
Is there enough players to meet these requirements ?
---
I nearly died of thirst backing out of the menus. Am I missing a trick?
---
Get ya SWATTAH!!
---
basically
---
As someone that works with databases. It should not lag. This dude is right, it is just integers and some varchars. A good database is super fast. It is designed to do that. I process 11.000.000 rows every hour within 2 minutes (for a other game). Every row contains multiple values/ints and varchars that could be compared with what FO76 needs to store for their stash as well.  
---
But why does it lag so bad then? I dont know. Didnt FO76 have some stash issues at release where complete boxes were empty upon arrival etc? Maybe they have some huge ass code that gets executed when you open your stash or something to validate different stuff
---
lmao
---
This is what I do when rolling legendaries from the purveyor; I save my scrip and daily scrip allowance til I’m on a server where I get a couple good drops from mobs, bloodied, anti armour, FFR etc then I turn in all my scrip and then scrap any crap rolls for more scrip and get one more.
---
I swear it’s somehow tied to weapons in your inventory too, this is purely anecdotal but I bought a quad/33 Tesla from a vendor a couple weeks ago and since then I’ve had 4 really good Tesla’s from the vendor just playing casually a couple hours a night. Got 2 bloodied teslas, 2 anti armor along with some not so good Tesla’s in the last week.
---
Had a good bolstering server last night and got a heavy combat bolstering/APrefresh/ammo weight reduction limb from a 3 star sentry bot.
---
He's in a workshop. No exploits needed.
---
take your time and play the initial quests to hang of it. Level 50 will seem so far off but you will get there quickly. And when you get to level 100 you will realise just how much you actually didn't know at level 50, and start building a proper character.
---
I'll give it shot for the fun of it. After all, it only seems appropriate that a junkie would run around with a jury rigged weapon since he sold his B2525 Fixer to get his fix :)
---
yea they should just hire the people that made mods for the game it would be a completely new game with functionality
---
A small band of sub-50's stole the munitions factory from me, and I'm a level 300-plus. Granted, I was busy with another workshop entirely, and I never stay at a workshop, only show up to grab whatever resources I've set up.
---
I checked the crafting menu and you do actually get the outfit too. Or I saw it under costumes myself, and I didn’t buy the regular Billy outfit
---
that is actually........terrific advice!
---
Exploration and discovery for yourself does make the game much more enjoyable.
---
I’d put a cap in your ass if you didn’t already have one on your knob
---
I claim, set up turrets or resources, then leave immediately. I don't even wait for the defend; I'll come back if the resources are ready or if a retake event pops up. If an attack event comes up, I ignore it.
---
PC player here, and I've had a higher number of crash to desktops, and server disconnects since patch 21. I play mostly on private servers, and disconnects are normally very rare, but I've had 3 or 4 since the update.
---
I think so many people just want basic features to work, and to have the same options for similar games that have been out a decade, so they can finally get their money's worth. The state it was sold in wasn't even worth a dollar/pound as you can get fully functional games for a pound. It's more a principal thing than demand
---
I tried running the exe and it opens steam. Also changed in the ini file to disable steam and it prompts for my Bethesda account. But as I bought it through steam it just prompts a message telling me the trial period is over.
---
There is prob an idiot's survivor tent in the way.
---
While in power armor, or in a terminal/crafting station, you won't see the score pop up until you leave them, that's all it is.
---
You have to do it three times to compensate the full amount of an NW challenge, but yeah. Still. That's 30k a day I have to get. SBQ isn't even 2k. Barely anything is over 2k. It's a fucking slog to make up for not getting the NW challenge. 
---
I'm also a bit of a casual, but I have things I have to do in my life, and I'm also likely going to have my seasonal job pick back up soon, so the luxury of time to grind 30k a day is not necessarily within my grasp, depending on the day. I know I'm not the only person who is in this boat, either.
---
But I'm glad you have a system.
---
I'm just saying, why force people to either do NW or abdicate points? Just give the SCORE slot to another PVE challenge. I would rather do a hard PVE challenge than an easy PVP one.
---
In comparison, my friend borrowed £20 2 years ago and never gave it back. But I still want my money, it's exactly the same with everyone complaining, they ideally want a refund or their money's worth
---
I couldn't find the backpack in my store no matter how hard I looked. It still has he free tag next to atomic shop but it's just not there
---
Yes you do. You draw all the attention from bugs and whatnot that spawn, allowing me to run away to a safe distance and throw a ton of bullets at her. Thank you.
---
Regarding HoloTapes and Notes I would love to see some kind of icon if it's new/unread or not - sometime i loot them a bit fast before reading the title -.-
---
What is the point of this, you will never teleport to those vaults again since they are empty.
---
I am not even teleporting to vault 76 ever even if it's free.
---
Defends are a good/easy way to complete event challenges for score, especially if you jump on a forest area workshop early on your login, I generally do the retake missions only if I need to claim multiple workshops for score, as each retake has been registering as a claim for me, I don't know if that's a glitch or it's supposed to happen.
---
Also Uranium Fever. Basically, any event that ends up with tons of meat piles. I suspect it's the amount of particle flies buzzing about.
---
No one is forcing you to play Nuclear Winter. I started the Legendary Run late. I dont do NW because I hate PVP and battle royales same as you. Ive never done the NW SCOREs and Im only like 10 spots behind the other spaceship on the board.
---
It's happened to me, usually when I get out at my camp. My guess is it may have something to do with their update of stopping the rewards from popping up and covering the screen during combat.
---
You my friend are not alone
---
I have one since forever,tse handmade is not such a good weapon anymore, the spread is so bad,and when i compare it to my bloodied ffr handmade it feels like a poor relative.
---
Yeah bethesda should have fixed both meat pile (there is a bug since Skyrim), and the spawn exploit...
---
It happens after returning to adventure from NW, it's well known and the devs ain't concerned about it as it isn't affecting anyone. There's not much out there and you can't place a camp.
---
So tesla ash piles, not laser gun ash piles? Lemme try to download an ash pile replacer and see if that solves the problem for me.
---
I really love my furious handmade
---
Does it even matter on Consoles? And also, shouldn't a game be able to hold some notes and holotapes?
---
I've experienced some, they are lag related. Usually happens when too many devices are on my network. Either my local network's problem or ISP problems or just internet speed.
---
You deserve my upvote, made me laugh.
---
I second the fact that this game is becoming tedious as hell when it comes to the endgame.
---
Reputation / Gold / Caps / Scrip / Dailies + Weeklies / Daily Quests then repeat the entire process again the next day.
---
I just want to play the game and enjoy it. Not play the game and work...
---
If it weren't for the group of people that I enjoy playing the game with, I'd probably have moved on from now. It doesn't help that updates are being pushed back repeatedly. Why even have a Roadmap at this point...
---
&lt;3
---
It's people like this that make low levels instinctively draw their guns on me when I show up at their camps to use their vendors.  Bigly sad.
---
low quality bait
---
Same here.
---
This is interesting for sure. I personally haven't experienced this though. My damage stays pretty consistent between runs. Im also on a private world 99% of the time though so that might be why lol
---
Depending on your build, each faction has different things to offer but you need to max out with them first apart from the secret service. Raiders have a bot inside the main building to trade with and settlers it is the guy that stands near the bullion machine
---
Its a wacky job done by bethesda, the skin is bugged on the silencer too, and some magazines got it wrong too
---
It's still an abdication of points for not playing a mode I don't like, it's a punishment for not wanting to shoot people in the face. It's dumb and it adds up at the end. The 250 can go to anything else in PVE.
---
Alternatively, I have to take the time to grind 3,000,000 points (10,000 x 3 x 100) to make up the full amount of points required to make up for it. It's a lot for a person who is just casually toddling along a few hours a day to make up, especially if it resets halfway through a 10k block.
---
It's a fucking chore and a punishment, and it's needless.
---
I mean, we have no reason to hate each-other yet in 76, so take your boycotting somewhere else.
---
OP was in a workshop which doesnt take exploits for PVP but we were talking about other cases.
---
maybe in 2 years they will get around to that.
---
I don't know what lv you are, but leveling up by itself can cover the cost of the NW repeatable, especially past lv 200, since you need more than 30k XP. to gain a level.
---
Yes that's actually the core problem! I see it just like you, we need good Endgame content that's is not boring to repeat if the grind is worth it. And I don't mean another SBQ! I had some hope when I first heard of the expeditions, maybe it's exactly what I want but after the last updated and patches I have not much more hole :D
---
[According To Valseek ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i4tae0/am_i_the_only_one_getting_free_score/g0lvo68?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
A similar thing happened to me it’s just damn awful. Thankfully we don’t have to deal with these people in real life! Personally I think claiming workshops should be levelled so that only players on your level or under should be allowed to contest you and if you have passive enabled not as all it doesn’t add anything to the game so why allow it. When you log off you loose the workshop anyway so  it’s not looking like you can hog it and take advantage 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Yeah that was trippy.......It made me sad though because I had such high hopes for the first multiplayer fallout......glad it came out on gamepass though
---
He's talking about the stash limit
---
Taking a break and might be back when and if we get more better stuff to do like new quests or vault raids etc.
---
For this very reason (people being dicks) I never spend more time than needed when claiming workshops for SCORE. When the claim is in progress, I open the map, select a location for fast travel and hover my mouse over the button. So when I hear the sound of claim getting complete, I click and travel away less than a second after the claim is done...
---
You keep saying "I have to" like you actually have to. You dont have to do them, you choose to do them. Its only a chore and a punishment because you make it that way. You can easily avoid them but you dont so you really only have yourself to blame. I am getting by just fine by completely ignoring myself.
---
Ha! Joke’s on you, my house is a cross!
---
140's on my main, not quite there yet. Sometimes I don't gain a level on my main in a day. I just try to get the dailies/weeklys and then maybe do something I wanna do.
---
Kinda sucks the air out of the game.
---
He means the weight limit of the stash.. *facepalm*
---
 How about next season we don't have a single SCORE tab tied to Adeventure Mode?
---
I'm not a PVE person. I despise killings mobs with the burning intensity of a million suns. And yet here I am, forced, FORCED, to play catch-up in the season card by dragging myself through this hellish PVE nightmare that is a adventure mode.
---
I hope this helps you realize how dumb you sound.
---
You know you have to deal round about 1000 dmg to get the loot from the queen?
---
Protip: equip 10 black powder pistols on the quick select wheel and get a pirate hat.
---
It’s gonna be the best pistol build you‘ve ever seen! 🏴‍☠️ 
---
It’s especially fun for combos - like using an instigating one to start and then switching immediately to an executioner‘s or so. It just sucks against tanky mobs like the squatch or tbe SBQ. Everyone else gets toasted though.
---
Yea, I think they put the numbers really high to help remove some scrap from the dupers.
---
Yeah I really don't know what happens but the public team thing does seem to make me get a bit more score
---
*You* were talking about other cases. The person you responded to was clearly asking about OP's experience.
---
The fact he took your junk then offered it back for pledging to the enclave makes me think you ran into a youtuber called ragechronicles. He did this a lot on his PVP vids for the first few months after release.
---
I don't think so
---
I just wish they itegrated the Better Inventory mod into the game. It's purely cosmetic, client-only change, so I guess that nothing could go wrong (though, we all know Bethesda). And besides the filtering options, the weight summary of verious categories is a godsend for inventory management. I cannot imagine playing 76 without it.
---
On the other hand, I'd prefer them to tackle the annoying bugs first.
---
Yup, same here, making those events unplayable :(
---
I thought it was closer to 2k damage
---
It actually is for some people
---
Na when the fight starts I just need 3 punches with 350 dmg per hit to get the loot.
---
While where at it can we get a holotape/document "keyring" too so I can just play my pipboy games without sifting through tons and tones of holotapes and notes? We do exist ya know. Those of us that play the games.
---
With that logic some might say "I am forced to build up camps which i hate", Just do it or don't do it and loose out on the score. Nobody is forcing you to do anything and people are not entitled that everything is "fun" for them and no one is entitled to the rewards. I for one think the challenges aren't hard enough both in adventure mode and NW. So everyone has different opinions,
---
I work same as you, i do 10 - 12 hour shifts  it changes depending if im in for prep or another chef.
---
On the weekends i grind out legendarys etc and eaxh day i jump on for 20-30 min and grind it down into scrip and buy gold bullion from smiley, just manage time better as i have no time unless its weekend and yet i can get on for these things
---
No the person I replied to was commenting on a comment about never opening for trades. That comment never mentioned that they were in a workshop area.
---
I also love how yall keep downvoting me lmao I have no idea why but keep it coming I guess? 😂😂😂
---
Do Monster Mash every time you see it up, stay crouched so people don't see you on the map, and never pick up the candy bowl. I'm past lv 280 and with the right XP buffs the event can still get me over 75% of XP for the level every time I see it come up. 
---
That's the 30k XP you need, in just 15 minutes.
---
More than once I have held all the workshops at the same time on private server. And you're quite right, the loot is ample. Not quite worth the price of admission,  but yeah, still kinda cool to have them all.
---
The ammo converter machine still gives me Lookup fail! Is it normal?
---
I had a camp just outside Charleston for most of my time in the game and her fucking voice finally made me leave because I could barely go anywhere without triggering that quest.
---
That would kill player vending imho.
---
Plans make up the bulk of what players sell to newer players and such
---
I hate dancing, place my tent to drink some cold beer 😂
---
Ohhh got ya
---
I always get the pop up when I exit PA.
---
I got 12 crates for over 2000 steel,,,
---
and got 2 crap plans and a bunch of crap grenades and a ton of crap alcohol.
---
I literally dropped all the stuff next to the crate and will never do that again. I’m done giving Bethesda my stuff. Why do you put stuff in the game that will irritate your players. I just don’t get them 
---
Sad face
---
almost 2000 hours until I learned that explosive flamers fire bullets instead of a short flame. Now I'm respeccing a charecter for the BE Flamer, which is the best weapon I've ever had in the game.
---
Berserker pirate with black powder pistol
---
Well yeah EVERYONE knows double layer pumpkin pie is where it’s at. Rookie mistake wastelander
---
Speaking of Junkyard PA, it's another of those "model-swap" cosmetics that would much better be another whole item in the game. Junkyard PA isn't even lorebreaking and would fit nicely in the game. They could have introduced short questline to obtain it and then introduce Atom shop skins for it...
---
The same can be said for the weapon model "skins", the chinese PA "skin", the refridgerator or the collectron. It used to work like that - we got the backpack and camera as part of the game and then only the skins were paid.
---
No, it only reminds me of why I avoid PVP in the first place. 
---
I play Fallout generally to play the storyline game, not to sit around in a garbage Fortnite clone. If I wanted a Fortnite clone, I'd go play one and not post things here.
---
Yes it matters a whole lot on any system
---
bad things can be said about fo76, but our community is off the charts, except for a few people(i'm looking at you, guy selling a radium or tesla rifle plan for 15k).
---
LOL after I completed the game I watched someone’s C.A.M.P get destroyed by a level 133
---
Beautiful! I love taking trophys as well. But i never seem to find a fitting spot for them in my mobile camp. http://imgur.com/a/5WMUlpX

Stage 4 lockdown where I am, not even really supposed to leave the house, so I (unfortunately) have all the time in the world for video games at the moment.
---
I've known this since day one almost but theres a sulfur fountain in whitesprings that cures diseases. Fast travel to golf club. Turn right a wee bit and head towards the wide open park bit (deathclawn can spawn there) and you'll see a gazebo. The drinking fountain is there.
---
I'm having the same problem, they should add some extra storage for junk
---
Oh, really? Now quickly before Bethesda notices and patches it!
---
(and I'm not hating on Bethesda here - getting a material from scrapping which was not used to craft it clearly IS a bug and should get fixed eventually)
---
I'm a person who actually wants to do challenges in PVE, so even if I don't like that particular challenge, or find it hard, I'll at least attempt it.
---
But if you want to complete the day's tasks, you have to trundle down to PVP, which is definitely, obviously, not my jam.

Gunpowder can be moved to Junk, any useable items to Aid, and other items like claim tickets and coins and such can be tracked in Collections.
---
Simple.
---
Seems Fallout 4 is all they know of the BoS, and what they choose to remember from F76. You know the demanding supplies, not how they came to that point where they had to demand supplies.
---
If you want the helmet I guess you gotta buy the one from the atom shop.  The pictures of the LR cosmos outfit don't actually show the helmet either.
---
Allegedly there are 400.000 active members, **allegedly.** So if you divide the 200.000.000 to those members it is 500 cork per person.  But that is only if that is correct. but even then if we half the active members to 200.000 it's 1.000 per member. Then let's half that again if we give our self's half the community has 1st, the people who don't probably haven't been saving the cork in their inventory. That brings it to 2.000 cork per fo1st members. I think this one is going to be hard to pass and ill be surprised if it passes.
---
Even though excavator has lower stats compared to other PA sets, each piece of power armor has built in damage resistance already. Because of this the actual damage resistance difference between each set of PA is actually really small.
---
Nah it’s been around for a while
---
So basically "wait for this random event to happen" is the solution?
---
I don't always have time to sit around looking at Watoga, though. But thanks for the tip.
---
Real assholes: " Rather than flee, the soldiers decided to continue manning their posts until the bitter end, trying to buy as much time for Appalachia as possible ."
---
No, you're quite right, the retake/defend workshop events totally count. When I need to complete events, I will claim a workshop for the retake/defend just for this reason. Super easy. The forest ones are a breeze, I'm particularly fond on the race track as it is quick to clear out and easy to find the enemies with the wide open space. Nothing worse than hunting around for that last enemy of the wave, especially mole rats, cheeky buggers.
---
So don't do them? They Obviously included that to see if some more people would try out the mode. It's actually quite fun for me personally, but might not be for others. If they see that a lot of people are skipping them they might remove it from next season.
---
Robotics expert
---
Yeah, i think most of us would like to keep that bug. Because i rather keep it as it is instead of them finally adding a way to hide/show the jetpack and breaking 15 other things in the process. Only on my main it rly contributes to the worn outfit. Hes wearing elite ranger. The other two just have an SS jetpack chestpiece to switch in when needed.
---
Is cranberry new with wastelanders? I've never found it before until recently.
---
I'm glad that you are, and I'm personally farther ahead than you rn, but I'm the kind of person who wants to finish everything on a list. So you're kinda asking me to be mad at myself for wanting to just finish what I started.
---
I mean, fine. Fuck me for wanting to not leave anything undone.
---
Well I dont enjoy bankrolling Bethesda sometimes but fuck it I have ZERO other hobbies outside of work. I may as well enjoy the perks!
---
Yeah this is insane. I'm on ps4. Went to radiation rumble last night as it's a fast way to level. After a few minutes of killing things any time I even looked at the main area in the center my frame rate went absurdly low. It was completely unplayable and we failed shortly after.  I suspect because everyone else had the same issue.
---
My rifle does 140dmg and i used around 50 ammo in each fight only missing a couple so i think its More than a 1000dmg
---
I don't understand why people are hating on this exploit.
---
Can Bethesda reset missions for individual players? if so i'd love to have "i am become death" reset for me as  it was autocomplete for me.
---
I'll finally be able to get to all those hidden treasure maps I've been collecting since I started the game...
---
I just stock up on a ton of water (for cheap healing) and use a instagating riffel or troubleshooters gatling laser it has worked for me since lvl 40
---
Imagine bowing to post-war american invaders, lul
---
I'm glad you like it. Somebody has to, statistically.
---
But hopefully they'll see this post, and see how many people just don't do those challenges, and do what you said. That's all I really want.
---
&gt;  forced, FORCED, to play catch-up in the season card by dragging myself through this hellish PVP nightmare that is a battle royale.
---
Stop being so melodramatic. It's 250 score per day in a season consisting of bugged cosmetics and a few pitiful installments of currency. You're not forced into anything, you're choosing to do it. If you don't like it, stop doing it. If you're doing it, stop complaining about your choice. NW is already unrewarding enough for people, you wait 20 minutes for a match and roll the dice at instantly dying to a cheater, just so you can slowly grind your way to another icon when you rank up after 10 matches. 
---
8/9 challenges are for adventure mode and 1/9 is for NW. Stop acting like a victim
---
I hear ya, sound like we're in the same boat; cheers!
---
Hey, 8str 8per 8end..., i need you to get this water cooled bonesaw...
---
It takes literally seconds to drop some steel. Me and 3 pals added 35k. A few people here say they added 90-100k. Steel is VERY easy to get. One uranium fever or line in the sand and you can easily get 2k+ steel from one event.
---
It could be just a visual bug, sometimes when I pick up a legendary item I get the notification about 5 minutes later.
---
At Rafiation Rumble there was almost a 'dome' around a whole bunch of meat piles. At the edge of this dome you could see pixellation occurring, and if you stepped into it, you went down to 5fps &amp; EVERYTHING started pixellating. V bizarre.
---
Love the name Mr baggins
---
I mean the Brotherhood does mainly use t-60 and its likely the appalachian brotherhood used t-51 since they were actual ex army and would have had access to some of those suits, given how rare t-51 is in lore makes sense the paints would only be fore t-60.
---
Wow, autocorrect did you hard that time! lol

Mine is named Julie because I name all my (first) female characters that in any RPG and we all know the name of the radio host....

Why even buy levels?  There’s nothing really useful except maybe the ammo thing and chicken coop.  Don’t let FOMO get the best of you...and your wallet.

They should remake it in UE.

Bethesda is the grade school teacher who hates kids and does everything to make their day as tedious and boring as possible. Removes everything that is fun unless you play by their rules.

There is a syringer mod that makes bloatflies spawn from kills. Shoot a bloatfly with such a syringer, loot acid, bloatfly spawns, shoot again, loot acid, bloatfly spawns, shoot, etc. rinse and repeat. Not always 100% but works pretty well most of the time.
---
I'll run less, now they have 'fixed' the ways of making the silo run less tedious. Enjoy less nuke drops now. Yay Bethesda!
---
Ha hA ha it sure did. I’m going to leave it.
---
donated 250 steel got shit not donating any more steel
---
Didn't the appalachian enclave just never really leave the bunker then killed themselves with infighting. No need to class the Brotherhood as a threat when your biggest threat is yourself.
---
They were Hotfixing servers one by one, this is why people were being placed in new worlds.
---
Perhaps. I don't think that disqualifies my point, though.
---
I’ve died eating that same pie. I assumed Davenport laced it because he never gets his pictures.
---
If she land like she's suppose to you'll easily do enough damage to her to get loot. I made a new character for wastlanders, full heath melee. I got loot from her level 25-30. I remember this because it wa a 2x xp weekend and I went in level 25 and came out level 30, that weekend was the first time this character managed to do enough damage to get loot from her.
---

---
What your rifles damage is in your pip boy and what your rifles damage is against the SBQ is two different things due to resistances.
---
Well there are good things about this game too that makes you want it to succeed. The lore is excellent, and as a Fallout game that lore has a strong fanbase, the environment is really engaging and there are other positives that make it valid to say 'this game but done differently could be one of the best games around'.
---
What is up with this patch, and with this engine, is everything held together by paper mash  and boogers. Move one thing, remve another and three or four things brake all over.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I've stopped, to boring now to do regularly.
---
The only reason I dislike the idea of a weekly cap is because I don't like the idea of hitting the cap and having to wait nearly a week to be able to vendor things again. Same goes with the legendary scrip etc. I'd much rather caps were just removed, or if they did make it a weekly reset, the caps would need to be raised substantially, along with the stash.
---
Some of the larger trees are actually part of the terrain and can't be removed. But for all others, yeah, we need an option to scrap them.
---
1500 +500 for completing it... So 2000
---
Then dailies for 12 weeks is 12 x 7 = 84
---
84 x 60 = 5040
---
Now we count the weeklies which normally is between 150 - 190? So let's go with 150
---
150 x 12 = 1800
---
So 6840 at worst.... For challengers that were easier and quicker XD
---
Btw this is worked out with the idea we will have 2 weeks break... There might be delays...
---
Oh ok i didn't know that well i quess The mystery IS solved
---
Thank you! I'm logging on soon to take the munitions factory again feel like I've got PTSD lol
---
Its all you dude. If you dont like NW and then continually put yourself through it for a measly 250 SCORE points, then its all you, mang.
---
If I was the overseer and people kept eating my pumpkin pie just after I'd put it out to cool down I'd start lacing it with cyanide too.

Game Mechanic Fact. What happens is that if you reuse an item that gives a stat boost of any type (Pumpkin Pie) and happen to use that same item before the initial one times out how the game codes the time extension is to remove the initial boost and then immediately reapply it. So Pumpkin Pie does give a hardy health boost so consuming a new one will immediately remove that health. For Bloodied players this can result in near death or instant death in the time interval of the boost reapplying.
---
All the deception aside. As soon as I noticed mr see through man my role play heart screamed SOMETHING COOL IS HAPPENING. IM BEING ROBBED :D
---
My gf did this quest recently.  Happened to her too, with my instructions to make Ra Ra happy
---
Instead gets called butt face.
---
I think so, if you use the scrapper perk and scrap all weapons you can find you will get a lot of steel.
---
Yea she has a 70% damage reduction skill. Better enable dmg numbers in your settings. So you always see what dmg you deal to enemies!
---
Yes, I agree, that’s possible. The experienced people work on important projects and if the shitstorm is too strong they come back for a few days and fix it.
---
😔 they hurt me mom. Bunch of mean big bois
---
NW has started growing on me lately but I get your point
---
I'm a PvE player on D2 i never do anything that requires PvP unless I need to but even then there's a lot of Exotic quests I'm skipping due to PvP steps I just hope the new quest doesn't have any PvP steps....
---
Now don't get me wrong, i love children generally in RL. But that thing..... that Rara.. thing.. It makes me go into instant rage ... and im not saying that hitting children should be allowed...  but i mean if i had the chance i would drown it .....  just saying
---
Same thing happened to me, didn’t really affect the story in any way tho. Also when I did the settler quests and got the Chinese stealth armor Jen said she was going to bury her mom even though I saved her.
---
How would you go about choosing which one to fire?
---
smh, why can't those folks just use a vendor like a normal person.
---
If I remember correctly she ignores 70% of your damage flat out.
---
No offense taken I a am a lowly peon
---
Oh, that's good info - need to remember that on my bloodied build.
---
The same way you go about selecting from multiple times of grenades?
---
Now how much cork and concrete do you get from those events and other normal gameplay?
---
This steel goal seemed nearly impossible to miss, but what about the next 2? And who the hell decided the goal for those should be that much higher than steel too?
---
Maybe this helps you further ([thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cb43a7/guide_how_to_run_multiple_instances_of_76_on_a/)), I run a 2nd instance once in a while for storing stuff I might need on a mule (Yeah, hoarder, I know). Key is probably to not launch the game via launcher but the corresponding exe in your case too.
---
For what? They played for a pretty long time, they got far more out of it than most ways to spend $20. That can get you a semi-fancy meal, a few days' worth of gas, a movie or two, a cheap blowie, two months of netflix, or a game that people play for months/years. If they got up to level 50, they aren't entitled to a refund, they kept playing and got an adequate experience for what they paid for. I don't quite support OP's point but I really am getting fed up with people here complaining over the stupidest shit day in and day out
---
I think they may have claimed the workshop while I'm busy in a trade menu I dont know. Somehow they killed me anway
---
I've dropped about 50k steel and it's been all plans I already knew. But the point of this whole event is to unlock community awards.
---
Oh damn I wonder if that’s the case
---
This would certainly help at some events. I ran encrypted last night and no-one was taking any pylons. With 5 mins left on the clock i (a bloodied build)  took all 3 pylons and everyone gathered just wrecked the robot in seconds. So no loot for me even though without me they'd have failed the mission.
---
Same goes for collecting ore at radiation rumble, unless you have teammates tagging enemies you lose out on a massive amount of loot.
---
I’ve never hated a character like I hate Ward. 🔫🔫🔫🤯
---
Logged on yesterday and grabbed the workshop south of my camp to fulfill the daily order. Shortly after I got it a guy 6 times my level shows up and 1 shots me. He then proceeds to fast travel away and never comes near the workshop or takes control of it. HE LITERALLY FAST TRAVELED TO ME JUST TO KILL ME.
---
Yeah many reports of this kind of thing.  I did the quests on 4 characters pre-Wastelanders and didn’t have the issues.  I suspect a bug has been introduced in the quest tracking system.
---
Not to mention he won’t get over those detonators.
---
All the time - especially Ward and Rocksy
---
I think it has to do with being in a public team. I had some confused dialogue and response happenings too. It worked out fine, but it was sure odd.
---
You forgot Roleplayers, but we can thrive in any game.
---
I love that you called it the dance floor lol😂 you’re a legend. But I also agree people are complete idiots about the tents, i put mine way off to the side so there’s no chance it’s in the way, I think people just want something to be on top of but then the queen doesn’t land.
---
Not to mention the more grindey it becomes.
---
It sometimes does lag and other times it doesn't. Maybe it is because of the little preview of the weapons/armor/items that you get when you scroll over them?
---
Ahem.
---
Vault 79.
---
Yeah im with you. I heard adrenaline was broken a week in and didn't notice while playing at all.
---
Yes, especially those two! It happens with blackeye a lot too
---
If killed myself soooooo many times when Psychobuff wears off and if I happen to pop a new one. 😅
---
Golf balls and globes. Though you don’t tend to collect either for cork (Plastic and Screws)
---
Lol yes i remember how awkward was that.
---
tbh....this sounds like fun :D
---
Or. They’re trying to tag everything without killing it so everyone gets the exp and legendary loot. Would u rather I show up with my full bloodied build and fixer and 1 shot everything?
---
I don't think it's their intention to troll and throw bodies around. Rather, using explosive weapons increases the chance of doing damage to multiple enemies, hence receiving more exp even if they don't kill said enemy due to the splash damage.
---
Why not throw in a revolutionary sword as well, closest thing you'll get to a cutless I guess.
---
There is a rest stop near my camp, up the road from Huntersville. Inside is a machine that can spawn Wild, Quantum, Dark, Cranberry, all at once sometimes if you're lucky. If it hasn't been hit there's usually a few in the machine.
---
It's been a worry for a while now, and it's too bad: I just got that skin yesterday, and I won't use it until I hear it's been fixed.
---
That's right! I dont even think of other materials those items have. Get hyperfocused on just the one main one. Everything else is a bonus.
---
Every single one is doable. Based on what i have in my scrapbox from just 2 months of having fallout 1st
---
Except cork. THAT one i'm sceptical on.
---
I left Line of Sand midway through today. There was no point being there. Everything was spawning in the middle and 2 or 3 players were using explosives. So pretty much everything died before anyone else could get a shot in and whatever anyone else did was getting yeeted into orbit so thered be nothing to loot after either. I get why people to do it so they can tag as many enemies as possible for xp but it just ruins it. I dont think ill bother with that event anymore. It seems to be the modus operandi lately
---
How is this a move, dont you have to fire back to take any meaningful damage? New player here
---
k
---
I think this will be good. If you look at ESO, when they introduced a patch that did the same thing, many players say that's when things started to take off. I for one think the game if far too easy for Bloodied and junkies. I have had by great build with some god like weapons and some legacies for some time now, and it just gets repetitive and everything is one shot. So if they implement this in a similar fashion as ESO i believe it will be for the better. But there are split thoughts on this. And if you grinded for more then a year for a bloodied/junkies build, you are doing it wrong.
---
No
---
 I'm talking the ones who actually do it to be a twat.
---
Who shoot after enemies are killed in line in the sand to send loot flying away.
---
They shoot after everyone killed mobs
---
Did u not see the explosion the other day and the huge, very visible shock wave?
---
Um...
---
1) that’s not all that was added with wastelanders. 
---
2) the original main quest is about 40 hours long if you rush and fast travel travel everywhere. 
---
3) there are a ton of side quests to do in the game (mistress of mysteries and the Van lowe one are two of my favorites). 
---
FO4 is a smaller game. My first playthrough of 4 was 60 hours. My first play of 76 was 120.... now I think you are just trolling. 
---
Not to mention all the hidden stuff in 76 like the d.o.m.e. Keys.
---
I love doing that kind of thing!
---
Most of mine involve various scenes with alien plushies surrounding a sheepsquatch plushie for unclear reasons!
---
Lol why? Why do you need so many different weapons? Especially ones you cannot use lol
---
There's a glitch that a tent placed correctly by a wall break will spawn them on centre. And not at the cracks
---
Yeah after this patch it has been horrible
---
I actually chuckled out loud at this.  Thanks, needed it. 👍
---
It mask can sometimes be seen on raiders. Most notably when you 1st meet meg. It's a 3 hole balaclava
---
Ah then u have a point. I misunderstood. Yeah they’re arseholes
---
Can you elaborate on the second thing? Not sure I understand.
---
I respect your forwardness. Nothign wrong with outright fair fighting someone for their loot. (Former raider turnt responder here)
---
Ah, so you're upset that you lose some loot piles in the glitched event that spawns all enemies in a single location and thus forces you to look around instead of having it served up on a silver exploit platter. I see.
---
While I agree with you, I think the problem is common sense. Common sense requires someone to pull their head out of their ass from time to time. That’s just asking way too much from people these days.
---
I play on XB. Maybe that same player could make you an upgraded set?
---
You need the hi vis. Steel toe cap boots and hard hat that dropped from the haloween event last year. Then you can access the building mini games inside and get the new 5 star legendary loot.
---
Scottish?
---
Radiation rumble yesterday. 4 other people camping the tunnel entrances. 30 seconds left on the clock. I had finally stopped healing NPCs to collect ore as nobody else was. NPCs start dying. I had already deposited 19. Last NPC alive. They're taking damage. I'm coming back with 6 ore which is enough to get 1 rank of rewards. I am heading back to hand in and what do i see? 
---
The last NPC with about 10% health getting attacked by 3 glowing bastards. 1 player about 2 foot away clearly moving around collecting stuff ignoring the soon to be dead NPC while the other 3 are on the same side leaving one side unguarded. I drop the ghouls and now i have a dilemma. Do i have enough time to swap to my shishkebab and heal the npc a little and still deposit the ore? I give the npc a few whacks. Ghouls are coming from the unguarded side. Someone is still collecting loot. I put the ore in and with literally 2 seconds on the clock. Rank 1 rewards achieved. 
---
FFS!
---
Welsh
---
Hey, I have the same problem, I have 11 soldier certificates but it won't trigger the next step. Did you just server hop and then it triggered or do I have to talk to Major Gutsy evertine I bop to another server?
---
I was there the other day!
---
If you're &lt;10 pounds over-encumbered, placing your Power Armour Chassis, hopping in and back out again will let you Fast Travel. For some reason, placing the Chassis does remove its weight, but the over-encumbered effect remains. Same with chucking thrown weapons.
---
Also that wearing a full Excavator Power Armour set gives you a significant carry weight boost. Didn't see any notification of that anywhere. Handy for Unyielding wearers like myself since you lose all the SPECIAL boosts from Unyielding in Power Armour.
---
ahm... it should not... o.O
---
Selecting kinds of ammo was a thing in New Vegas
---
What about third person survival with pvp?  I have SCUM, DayZ, Miscreated and Deadside but like SCUM the best.  Waiting to try New World for something different but I heard rumours that the anti pvp locusts descended on that and pretty much destroyed it.  
---
I really just want this game to work and for them to stop catering to only those that screech the loudest on the forums.
---
Barely see cork as a reward. Funnily enough just got 15 concrete from heart of the swamp
---
You must be new to the game
---
Not always glitched.  Depends if someone placed the tent or not.
---
Plus even when the glitch isn't being used they have done it
---
Not just that event either.
---
But even uranium fever
---
I need steel sometimes, so I do these events.  How can I get steel of they send the bodies into outer space?
---
Dear Bethesda, I want more, I think by being semi rude and insulting, you will give it to me! 
---
Thanks,
---
Entitled Player that has no understanding about server stability.
---
Doubt it, thanks to FO 1st.
---
Technically by the court of law: goods must be of merchantable quality, so level 50 or 800 in the right circumstances you're entitled to a refund, through obtaining peculiar advantage by deception, I'm sure trading standards and ombudsmen would have a totally different outlook, as I've heard of multiple refunds through people who know the law. Under those laws particularly, I believe they have a real right to express concern even in the smallest to f cases as laws have been broken
---
you dont miss out on points not doing the nw challanges. Heck, you get more points just doing the repeatable weekly challenge in the same time you try for the nw stuff...
---
Same exact glitch that was happening with the "Settler Vigilante Power Armor" skin. And from what I've heard, Hellfire did it too at one point.
---
You think they'd have it figured out by now.
---
Q:  **What's the deal with the cat mask guy?** 
---
A:  Workshop are PvP zones. 
---
This looks like bait, like you want to start up the same old tired argument? I suspect he knows workshops are pvp zone, he didn't ask how is it possible that cat guy could kill him, but other places he can't be harmed by players.
---
Yeah ward is nowhere near as bad as black eye or any other 1 at the fishing place. Also former raiders and raider thieves. Have to spam chat so they dont run off and get killed
---
It’s not the size of the camp it’s the space available on each server in terms of items spawned and built. It’s not unlimited and when every camp has a full set of bobble heads and magazines it’s a huge amount of space to provide.
---
Used to be 400. And it was for a long time.
---
Yeah I know about the glitch. When that started I was OK with it and actually enjoyed having them close together when everyone is using normal weapons. Lately though the explosives seem to be the preferred weapon of choice and it makes it bullshit. Not to mention it even worsens the lag eventually. Today i realised i wasnt having fun at that event anymore so I left it and probably wont return
---
I’ve been playing on and off for a while just wondering if it’s a possibility or if i just need to manage my storage better
---
Hold in your exit button. B on xbox. I assume square on playstation. Not sure on pc maybe esc?
---
Yeah 100% such a lucky roll, 308 is tough but I buy at 1 cap a piece off players and run my ammo machine on it.
---
I have an hunters explosive mg and it rips heart of the swamp, best to flip between the mg and another bloodied shooter though due to reload times.
---
Okay then.
---
Everyone loves outfit and camp stuff so hopefully those get met. Double score week is a harder goal to chase when many players have already completed the run and score sadly provides nothing after that. Curious to see how that one goes as I feel it fail spectacularly if the devs don't fake the contributions for it to save face. We'll know soon enough I guess.
---
The frat houae has about 5 that spawn in the downstairs bedroom
---
For me it’s dependent on how much lag there is on the server i’m on but might just be the case for console
---
And also it’s less, just, than 100 quid a year and works out to less than 2 quid a week. I’m not sure they’re gonna miss your money tbh
---
Also welcome to the bloody gang.
---
Try to get your hands on unyielding armour and a few perks like nerd rage (intelligence) serendipity (luck) blocker (strength)
---
800 *is* the increase. Everyone has been complaining about stash weight since launch. They begrudgingly increase it after fan complaints. If you pay for the premium membership, you can get an additional scrap box.
---
Neither have i

---
Damn.  You freaking nailed it.
---
No one is forcing you, don't be so dramatic.  There are other ways to gain those points.  I refuse to set foot in NW because it is not real pvp for one and pretty sure pc still has hackers.  I also have had days where I forgot to log in and I am still sure I will get this board completed.  Not that I really care if I do. :P
---
It’s locked down until fractured steel(BOS quest line) comes out this winter... but with the constant delays it might be next winter lol
---
Donated 250 steel, got 500 caps. Realized I had hit the pinnacle of rewards and stopped.
---
Damn Bethesda really do want us to be tight with our resources 😅
---
Meanwhile you have the NCR vibin in the corner...
---
At level 11 just try to get into a team or if you’re running solo, get into events that have a lot of people that way they can carry you through if it’s too much. You’ll still get the rewards. Tea Time is a good low level event. Can be done by yourself. The Morgantown airport is a good single player event too. Better with a buddy or two but still manageable.
---
Ah, thank you.
---
I'm with you on liking ra ra. I liked her bunnabun song
---
Though Gail was only ok sometimes
---
They claim it affects server stability.
---
Thank you. Everyone wants more more more but dont understand the servers crash more than they should now let alone if everyone has a huge mansion with a 1k turrets.  I honestly dont think budget is all that bad I have 5 separate little building and they are all completely decorated.
---
There's no reason to stay once you've dropped off. 
---
But each time I go, 1 or 2 other players show up, drop and leave. So you aren't going to see hoards of players clustered around ATLAS on the map.
---
But I've definitely seen more places looted out of metal junk the last few days. It's like when you have to kill a number of a specific creature, and all common places you go for them have corpses all over.
---
Do you need a Bethesda account to play it in the Game Pass? If you do, you can link your Bethesda account to a Steam account. I would contact support anyway, I'm no expert.
---
They applied hotfix to servers today. No wonder if they broke something along the way.
---
Like the delay on the Colossal Problem event
---
Chill
---
Probably they want the steel n shit or just to hog it all and show off the guns?
---
Never know.
---
Right now steel is desired for BoS shit boxes
---
That was the killer for me. I'm just not a PVP bro. Playing Destiny and having to play PVP for even little things made me about as miserable as I could get. I'm starting to fear FO76 is going that way, which is why this is eating at me as much as it is and making me 'melodramatic'.
---
I buy a game, and stick with a game, for the story. I get that there's people who want their new Fortnite/COD/whatever clone, but making people who bought and play the game to have to continue playing a game in a mode they are wholly not interested in is...tiring.
---
I'm hoping right along with you. Got a few buddies who still play and...yeah. I pray for their sanity daily.
---
Always get it exiting.
---
Either put it on the same drive as your OS, or follow the long tedious steps in Bethesda support, which aren’t guaranteed to make it work. I don’t have space for it so I can’t play it unless they patch it or a I reinstall my OS on my bigger much slower drive.
---
Have you been saving any cork you get? I sure have. Cork is going to be the hard one.
---
Concrete will be the death of gnomes all over Appalachia.
---
Entire servers are chugging away, struggling to have a playable frame rate at all!
---
I have junkies auto pistol on an alt.  He’s a lot of fun, but definitely weaker than my others.   As others have indicated, perks and such matter to make it viable for most content.  
---
I liked playing him until I switched my crazy lady over to junkies melee.  Played her for a few weeks to get her where I wanted her (she loves to wait for SBQ to land, then gets in its face and tears her up, lol), then went back to pistol Pete and was sadly frustrated at the lack of power.  Loved the role play tho. 
---
Bloodied is stronger of course, but it’s the junkie life for me, all characters
---
Don’t convert those bad boys sell them!
---
I'm seems like this was Bethesdas half ass way of trying to get people to stop doing rep glitches cuz it only happens to me with NPCs that give out rep
---
Baaaa means no, mate.
---
I feel like people need to give the poor alcoholic some slack.
---
I've proposed this exact idea (but with XP kills being locked in the chest as well) multiple times in the PTS forums and in the past on this sub, but it's been every time 100% ignored by Bethesda, and the upcoming Colossal Problem, although it does have an end-of-dungeon chest, still doesn't have this despite being even worse than even Radiation Rumble in this regard, &gt;!since you can't stay there and loot all the bodies afterwards, you have to run for the exit or the mine collapses on your head.!&lt;
---
u/Ladydevann, u/Valseek, please bring this to the team and let us know if there ever will be any plans to implement something like this. Too many events right now are only used to farm XP or specific things and most of the times they fail because completing them is less valuable than letting them fail but tagging all the enemies. This isn't good design.
---
Thank you and its funny you mention minor tweaks because I only need to switch 1 point and didnt know they did double exp that's awesome, I've been making sure to always do the feed the people event for the soup that gives 5% and not go anywhere if I'm not well rested or have kindred spirit.
---
It's a cap sink. That's why they won't give us any free travel beyond what they already have.
---
For some reason 'brotherhood of leather' brings a totally different image to my mind.
---
Store and replace. Things are repaired for free
---
Yeah I usually sneak and steal it if it looks abandoned. Then cloak and hide somewhere inconspicuous. If nobody comes I build, if they do then I just leave it for them. The SCORE doesn’t require you to defend or build it up so I don’t waste time. I have a few times though in the world where a person attacks in non PVP zones and I just stand there staring at them. Usually get my headset on and let them know I don’t play that game.  They follow and annoy for a while, trying to step in front of me when I’m shooting to force trigger PVP, but then I just VATS everything and eventually they get bored and leave.
---
I "need" them because of reasons. But seriously, main started as a as a riflemen with shotgun as a secondary for close range. Then shotguns got nerfed into the ground. So switched to melee. The the PA disappearing bug came along, so switched to bloody melee. That was to OP for me so I went to unarmed melee (had an instigating knuckle in my stash forever), still to OP so I ditched the unyielding gear, Got a B5025 handmade so played bloodied for while again. Unarmed only needs 3 perks so I had some strength to spare, so I dug out a furious 90%rw .50 I had n my stash forever. Now I'm a sneaky full heath unarmed melee, heavy gunner, rifleman. With 2 rifles one scoped and one not. Oh and a 90%rw auto 10mm pistol for tagging.
---
I think it is weapon to keep on you for tough enemies and not a build, but maybe you will go full heavy and rock a gat plasma, mini and LMG.
---
They do.  Only the basic pipe pistol doesn't double dip.
---
Yeah I'm currently having a problem with my stash is freaking full and I have no idea what to keep what to get rid of, I'm probably going on a building spree today after my usual server hop to get lead, however some nice ass kid gave me excavator power armor after buying a random trash piece of armor from me for 5k last night just trying to get to level 25...guy was only level 55 and max capped with 3 different sets of power armor.
---
I don't know why are you downwoted so much, I think these mods are great, I'm using better inventory myself, since it was released.
---
I thought you get the secret 6 star legendary chainsaw
---
Death to all gnomes. Ad Victoriam. 
---
I don't have 1st but occasionally dump excess junk to my alt account. Pooled both accounts together yesterday and had 180 cork total. Lol.
---
Uh oh, you just brought attention to an enjoyable bug, incoming patch!
---
Previews are also a database thing and should not be an issue at all  unless ofcourse it is not optimized in any way.  
---
I really think it is a validating issue. Does this item belong to this dude kind of checks, that can be pretty daunting esp not optimized.  
---
For example, I notice a slight stutter on a set interval (1 minute ish) while playing. This is most likely because during that time the game is doing something very heavy and therefore the stutter. It is not something graphic, so I guess it is something validating wise.
---
yea im not here to complain about it, I just thought id let other's know. it could possibly be something with teams, or it could just be a simple update bug.
---
Are you talking about the two 1st items this month? I don’t think it’s a bug. They said they are on the featured tab.
---
I've been extremely worried about accidentally hitting another player during an event and getting flagged for pop, does this happen or am I overthinking it?
---
I became a bloodied build because I got a bloodied ss axe and year or so later full bloodied build.  I use melee, ranged and heavy, I’m a jack of all trades so to speak lol
---
The Chainsaw is one of the most underrated melee weapons in the game and it sucks that they cap at level 20. It's devastating if you add the flamer attachment and the double bar mods. They do constant damage, most creatures do not have fire resistance, and they stagger enemies when used. I keep one on me at all times. Acquire one and the next time you hit the Burrows load it up, stand in a doorway and watch it turn those 20 mobbing ferals into splatter.
---
downvoted
---
Although the vault may as well be empty, if I had my way. I’d buy the shit I want and then kill PITA, and if they shoot back then I kill the others off too.
---
Expeditions are probably going to be okay / mediocre at best. We all saw how The Burrows turned out. I like Radiation Rumble a lot though, we need more team-work events that are full of enemies to deal with but in instanced areas. As for Wendigo Colossus I think its a neat idea. Just want it released already....
---
As for me? I want to trek into the Capital Wasteland as its probably worse than the Glowing Sea currently. I'd love an incredibly hostile land that requires people in heavy anti-rad gear / power armor forced to trek through with limited supplies and constant danger. Something that not only challenges the most experienced players in terms of combat but also tracking their resources like food/water as all of it inside the 'zone' would be contaminated and deadly to consume.
---
I do love the argument you put forward, its been posted countless times,  I won't spend atoms on things I can't display. Why not make it like fallout 4 you could build huge settlements.
---
Simply you don't build settlements in 76, you build camps. I think the camp budget is a nice challenge. I have made some great ones in the past, I just move mine when I am bored and start somewhere new, I can then cycle through the atom shop purchases as and when they suit the camp I am building.
---
I dont mess with workshops for that reason
---
I apologise if you think it was being semi-rude and insulting, that wasn't the intent of the post.  
---
The intent was to highlight that Bethesda want people to spend money on their product, but currently people can't use the product they have made available to purchase, because of limitations they have put in place on them.   
---
I don't believe i'm an "Entitled" player ( inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment ).
---
Fair point I do have limited understanding of server stability, surely though there are really clever people at Bethesda who have a significantly better understanding of it than I do, who can use that knowledge to do some good?
---
It would be nice if people could see he characters name. Our name shows up in monster mash, but not the rest of the game. What’s up with that?
---
Ooooo weeee
---
What’s up with that? What’s up with that?
---
I love how often I've been called 'dramatic' in this thread. It's so dismissive of one's feelings. Really starts the conversation off on the right foot. So productive. Anyways.
---
I'm glad you're so chill about it. Good for you. And it probably is full of hackers, which is why I hate PVP in the first place. I have better things to do with my life than slog through a sea of 12 year olds who figured out how to hack a game and are having a power trip because they otherwise lack any form of control in their lives. But I digress. Back to me apparently needing a fainting couch.
---
I'm glad you don't honestly care about whether or not you do something on some arbitrary board in some arbitrary game in your arbitrary life, but I do. So...yeah.
---
The steel mill helmet skin increases your energy resistance,fixer is a skin for the combat rifle and it increases the stats,it is also the reason why we cant apply other themes to our fixers,i dont find it weird for a skin to cause this,what probably happened is that the underpaid 10$ per hour programmer received the artwork and forgot to set the values according to the P.A the skin gets applied too.
---
I though that was a Bethesta to Steam problem, not a game pass one. I don't read the sub as much as I used to, but I haven't read any post saying that game pass caused it. I might be wrong though, as I said, I'm spending less time on the sub lately so I might have just missed the posts.
---
Same here. My camp has a road down the middle of it. By using prefabs and making my own buildings, it looks like the start of a little town. And it looks really big for a camp. I built it also next to some pre existing in game stuff, so it gives it an even bigger feel. 
---
I don't even have my budget maxed, because I always want a little room for new things. Sure, there are things that I don't have out. But a good camp is about editing your choices, not dumping everything. Unless your goal is to make some kind of roadside show, or a junkyard style camp. Which I've seen a few of, and they can be awesome.
---
I got lucky and held a workshop for about 6 hours as a level 12...was the dirt track one. No one came to take it from me and I was seriously surprised and ready for it to happen. Had quite a few people show up, look around and I guess decide to let the noob do his thing.
---
Nah they patched that. It’s legacy now
---
Never had a lever action to compare it to but I one shot most things with my Bloodied pipe revolver.  I have 5 perks of Gunslinger and really can't think of what I would put them in, maybe Marathoner.  Don't need Adrenaline for general farming or Sneak and I don't use VATS perks.
---
The arsebandits have made many significant historical contributions to society and should not be forgotten

yeah, been saving cork since it comes from

Crystal decanters
---
Baseballs
---
All variety of Globes

You can get away with any sorts of murder if you have the right lawyer, that hardly means it's right. If you play the game for 5 hours and the bugs get to you, fine, you should be able to refund it. If you play for 20 hours and get bored, that's on you. If you got up to level 50, or 100, or 500, the game clearly works well enough to be played. I heard that the australian courts issued refunds recently to people who asked for them 2 years ago, back when the game was in a really bad shape. That at least makes sense, you could argue the game was unplayable back then. Wanting a refund now because big bad bethesda fixed an exploit you liked is not the same thing
---
I can guarantee FO76 will not go that direction, usually the one NW challenge can be done within a minute 
---
Fallout to me is like the older ones, PvP has very little place in this game as we're apparently from the same Vault and looking at the world, you'd think humanity would stick together not kill each other for shita and giggles 
---
If they PvP then yeah I pray too lol utter cesspool PvP is in D2 dude
---
I hope next season they make it so that XP gained from NW counts towards the repeatable, it's obvious they won't stop since it gets people to play NW.... but we can at least hope that "Rank up Overseer" is removed.
---
U wouldn't even need a new station, smelting is in the chemistry set, you'd think it would be an easy add on at that point
---
90%? Might want to check your math there. You could not previously get 20k atoms in 10 weeks
---
So u can alter the level of your weapon?
---
Lol you were protected under noob law
---
I mean theres a big difference as well between 4 and 76. One is a single player game were all the information is stored on your system and the other is a multiplayer game where info is stored on a server.
---
can we get a binder for all these notes too...shit and maybe one of those antique black containers people use to keep all their tapes in for the million holotapes.
---
I'm not sure about Windows store version but Steam have the same problem and here is how I prevented this for the Steam version:
---
1. Create new Beth account with the name you want to use
---
2. Link this newly created Beth account to the Steam account
---
3. Buy the game in the Steam
---
Same thing is happening to me. I just started playing again and was doing radiation rumble, someone throw some kind of blue fire grenade and my fps went from 50ish to 5.
---
I didn't even tell you about my alt, lol. He got a arsenal from my main. And has amass an arsenal of his own.
---
Only requires 10,000 players too drop 12,500 steel each. Not alot
---
We also don’t know what happens in those 2
---
Weeks between seasons
---
Could be, I'm not really a computer technician/programmer but I think you're probably right. Maybe the game is checking if it "loaded" the right list of items for that specific character?
---
A few days ago I noticed that in the whole 700 hours I've played the game I put together some 400 units of cork. Just two days before they announced the ATLAS  mats I bulked most of it and sold it to Sunny lol
---
FYI you don’t have to have scrapper equipped.  Also, having scrapper equipped does not increase the amount of cork. It’s not all pipe guns too mainly pipe rifle. Pipe revolver will just give steel for example.
---
Nope, as long as you have the effects on the weapon or armor that are given the magic effect you'll be stuck with them until if they get patched out.
---
I bet that if they add it we will lost all our keys instead
---
You can change your account display name.
---
Star Wars Old Republic.
---
The problem is that I have been playing too long without 1st that I specifically avoiding picking up junk I don't need. Baseballs have been on that list since way back when. I don't know if they fixed it like they did for beer bottles, but they didn't auto scrap since they were in Grenade recipes. I have never intentionally picked up a baseball since then. Decanters and Globes I definitely grab for the other stuff so I guess that's where my tiny supply did come from.
---
But I do if I don't do it. They dont just magically float up into the sky and rain back down on me if I don't. Also the repeatable is not the same as doing the other thing. Sure it's passive, but you earn XP in NW, so playing it goes towards the repeatable so it's a bit like a double abdication of points in a roundabout way.
---
It's just annoying.
---
No, it does nothing except consuming resources
---
Thats too bad specially because my weapon didn't even had any of those effects lol
---
Aww got me all
---
Excited to max my level 1 set lol
---
I'm back to grinding out treasury notes and hunting through the vending machines for a good AA minigun. Also trying to reach 33 in NW for the BOS skin but I'm not feeling that side of things at the moment.
---
Interesting. Feels like a bit of a cheese, but would certainly be handy in a pinch. Thanks!
---
And its so obvious that i really cant feel sorry for anyone that bought it. How can you even act surprised after getting screwed over numerous times? Learning disability?
---
No you dont. You just need the normal junk materials mate
---
lol man, amazingly I've met nothing but awesome people so far had a random guy last night trade me and tell me he'll give me 5k for some random level 5 armor that was truly junk, later same day he gave me a set of excavator power armor when he heard me saying that I was having trouble getting lead. Found a guy who had all his shop prices set to zero. and lastly 2 super high level guys who didnt have mics invited me to a party during an event, show up at my camp and give me quite a few stim packs and plans, as well as 1 heard I needed the industrial water purifier plan, so he fast traveled to the spot and cleared everything and did the follow emote, I was freaking level 4...I've had the game for about 3 days now, and I'm waiting for the hard griefing I know is gonna come after all this good. Sorry that you ran into the dickheads, if you dont mind me asking what are you playing on?
---
How does NW work? I’ve never played it, does it mess up anything that I’ve done with my character in the normal game? Or is it a new character?
---
This is why I sell plans for 1 cap, offloaded all of my extra masks once peopled stopped buying them at 200 to 50-75 and they all went away!
---
The only plans I can't get rid of are Disease Cure(Forest), even at zero caps I had a pile of 4 sitting there while everything else went! I dropped them off at Morgantown station earlier
---
Agree. I'm on ps4 and Rad Rumble is always bad for me and that's before the patch. Start of the event is fine, then frame rates become gradually worse. I run it but hardly because of this. Line in the sand has been fine for me until after the patch. Did the event yesterday and I almost had to look away from my screen by the end of the event, felt like I was about to have a fit. I've not run it since then because it was so bad.
---
We encountered this at Uranium Fever the other night, really weird pixelation. 
---
Can see here at 1:36:00

I don't have a Discord 
---
Is this one of those things where you have the idea and want to run the show but don't actually want to do any of the work?
---
Get rid of any armor piece with 15% Dr while blocking. Get rid if any Shotgun with Instigating, Medic, Stalker or Junkies and/or 50% limb dmg, 33% vats chance or 40% bashing dmg. When you have nothing of these stats on your armor or weapon you should be good.
---
To the people who say 90% is too high: you are all doing the same mistake: you are going off 10 weeks of a season vs an entire YEAR(!) of potential atoms. Seasons are here to stay. After every season, a new one begins. There is no more chances to gain atoms outside kf the (broken) challenges system. Mind you, those challenges are also finite. Daily/Weeklies were not.
---
You left out the most important part:
---
8: this will mode the weapon's lever /it wont... it is just annoying visual glitch and you have to reenter the workbench.
---
If it is alter the weapon level, thats is bigger problem then the dupers did last time...
---
Was happening before too. I think it's too many explosions on the event that the game can't handle 😒
---
Take my upvote simply for mentioning Social Distortion.
---
We need a binder for notes, and one of those antique black cases people used to keep tapes and snes games in. (someone will remember what I'm talking about.)
---
Oh, in the past it was 400. With the double, people still complain...
---
I just tried on shitty two star axe, level remains the same, it just took my resources
---
The sad thing is 800 is plenty but for that to be the case you are more or less forced to have FO1st to store all your junk in the infinitely sized scrap box
---
Did you submit a ticket? Don’t know what you want us to do about it
---
Don't get me wrong this player base is amazing people always help out and I do too now that im starting to have more resources than needed. (100 plus fusion cores lol) It just every now and then you come across a dickhead. Worthwhile trade off to interact with the rest of the outstanding player base. I'm an xbox players myself :)
---
Ouch...
---
But thanks for trying!
---
It needs a separate, similar system. Or just simply allow us to sell them at vendbots for 5 caps or something.
---
YEah it happened every two days or so for me before patch. Seven times yesterday.
---
I was actually planning on going hunting for all of them today to get the challenge. Were there any that were hard to get?
---
They’re probably getting downvoted by salty console players (of which I am one. Didn’t downvote, though) who regard these mods with envious eyes.
---
For me? Yes. They all were super fucking rare.
---
I dont trust any AAA company to not find a way to force its player base to do what it wants, especially if it will pad their bottom line. If NW is seen as popular and profitable, they will find a way to make you do it even more than now.
---
Fallout has never been a PVP game and honestly it shouldn't be. But, ya know, Fortnite is what the kids like, so just cobble together a clone and toss it in this half-broken game! 🙃
---
Good to hear Destiny's PVP scene hasn't changed...
---
It isn't junk?! God that explains why I couldn't get my weight under 130...
---
Then what happens to us who like to scrooge mcduck into our big pile of keys!?
---
Oh wtf it doesn't? So that means it's even more of a waste of my time to be there if I even bother. Ugh.
---
And yes, 100% yes. Leave that for the section of the challenges I'll never get to. 🤣
---
Yep, this one has been on the perpetually growing list of needed QOL fixes for a while now.
---
No, in fact i found the game more stable (base ps4) i don't end with a permanent 5fps after rad rumble, line or scorched, but I noticed that a lot of textures or icons dont load anymore.
---
Have you tried using the steam credentials?
---
Una/str/Cavalier
---
But the posibilities you get one.....
---
Can they not create display plans for the bobbleheads/magazines say you get one part of the plan when you find it, then when you have all the plans you can build a display unit as a single unit rather than 20+ individual items, or give players the ability to create plans of the things they want to display so again they are displaying an individual item rather than a group of them?  
---
I understand they won't miss my money, and I don't believe this post will change anything, but I was interested in the discussion around it, and the reasoning behind it all, I don't really understand the limitations, my first computer was a zx spectrum and I learned to program in Dos, and technology has progressed way beyond that now.
---
That's how us vets grief the the new players now. Just dump all our unwanted plans on them and make them waddle through the wasteland. 😂😂😂
---
it's superstitious but after getting hit w this twice in a row I make sure I'm not logged on 30mins before and after daily reset. And I don't open the atomic shop or NW when starting fresh, straight to main game. seems to work so far though I won't be surprised if I see the bug agn.
---
Yeh, that is all part of validating. And validating can be quite heavy, however it should not too heavy. There are games out there that do this stuff but not for the 20 players on a server but for 10.000 ppl on a server and they are managing fine.
---
I AM on Xbox - I'd happily trade you some of my garbage to scrip in exchange.
---
My tag is UCGSSQUAWK
---
And thank you!
---
It has but if u can have unlimited items in each camp the server hasn’t the capacity to load all the items in plus all the loot in the world plus all the drops it would become unstable and crash. So it’s limited. As for them making some kind of display plan. This is Bethesda. They can’t get the stuff in the game right after 18 months. What makes you think they’re capable of doing that lol
---
The explosion doesn't trigger enforcer after the patch
---
All YOU need is a shotgun to get your hits in.
---
They did fix it so that baseballs auto scrap. Same with beer bottles.
---
yes. Enforcer perk, explosive splash damage and even direct hits is a lot less effective now. tested various shotguns. My last few rad rumbles did not go the way they used to either.
---
From being picked up or do they not have like 1 set location they spawn?
---
I think it's too much with the rickety server system in place for them to fix at this point.
---
Radiation rumble is unplayable on a PS4 Pro. It's getting less than 1 (one!!!) frame per second when the meat piles start to pile up. And if anyone starts shooting a tesla, i go grab a coffee. The game just stops. It's completely unplayable.
---
Just as long as you know that the really good pieces end up in a traders collection for market values lot of the time. I know traders who spend hours and hours hunting for pieces while they set up player to player trades. That is their end game content.
---
God damned cork soakers.
---
I'd be fine with one lunchbox ever so often beyond rank 100...
---
Just as Bucs\_Life\_1976 said, thats not true at all. I run a full health vats/crit gunslinger and it became my favourite char to play, I have no trouble doing more than enough damage to the SBQ to get rewards and clear up adds on the side. Cleaning WestTek from the green plague is a matter of minutes, doing Line in the sand or Burrows is like shooting fish in a barrel. 
---
Are bloodied/junkies better damage wise? You bet. Do you need this damage output in FO76s current state to survive or finish quests and events? Absolutley not.
---
If you are interested in a good gunslinger guide, try [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eurg4r/big_iron_midroadss_guide_to_the_full_life/)
---
I haven’t seen anyone hating on it. Not even a single person. I really like that people are doing it! I mean I’m definitely not gonna do it, I don’t want to screw up my camp budget nor do I care to have any chance of being banned, but heck I love camp hopping and grabbing free ammo😂
---
I legitimately have no idea how to set up a Discord Server. Without a server, no one would want to join, and the concept is for us to be lead by the actual in game Overseer NPC, just basically doing what we're doing in the game, but as an organized military force. I don't know, dude. It sounds cool. I feel kind of hurt and don't know at all what to say.
---
It happens to me when I try to skip dialog sometimes. Game really likes making me listen to Ward talk about the same thing every day
---
Does it warn u that your base is getting lockpicked? Or r they just randomly catching u in the act?
---
That would require them successfully mating the coding to use those items with a bow. 
---
Do you equip the bow and the arrow, and thus with grenades that’s 3 weapons selected, does it replace the grenade slot?
---
It’s, messy.
---
It was for me, I had everything that mattered I can’t recall if I lost the photo’s or not?
---
Well, he was also chopping on his cellmate, so Pete don't care whose meat he chops.
---
You get the same mount of XP if you do the event normally, it´s just faster this way
---
Was rigged from the start...
---
You'd think after nearly 2 years of these posts, people might decide to hold off for a second and ask themselves why it hasn't happened yet
---
You feel hurt? 
---
Well I'm so very sorry about your feelings 
---
I'm also out 
---
Have fun dude
---
Hopefully it helped :)
---
Oh man do I feel this. Not only do they take up space, but you can't even sell them! Such a bad reward.
---
My friend decide to build on the golf course to avoid this, no water around though...seems like todays the day I build somewhere new since I've been to 7 worlds now and my camp cant be placed.
---
If you play the quest line to Enclave all your questions have answers ....not very good answers but still answers to why and how we have access to the nukes.
---
For a deaf person you articulate well. I never seen a deaf person that didn't have fractured sentences. As my deaf sister would say...this (is) 🐂💩, lol.
---
Lmao I did try out the new content I even got fallout plus for a month just to try it out. Wastelanders was a massive disappointment in my eyes it was short and pretty forgettable and lacked any impact on the world. Also the raiders faction was a mess dullest nicest “raider” group we’ve ever seen
---
Log in to your bethesda account, go to account management, then edit account there should be an option to change your display name. And yes, even if you're playing on Steam or through Gamepass or Xbox or PS4 you should have a bethesda account. 
---
You can change your displayed name once every 3 months.
---
If you read all the lore it tells you where they all come from.
---
Jack Skellington Santas everywhere!
---
Why does this even matter? Its 250 score that isnt even required to do the gold challenge daily. No ones forcing you to do it. I hate NW but ill do the easy ones like deploy 3 camps or survive for XX minutes. Don't be so dramatic, its one daily challenge.
---
which events is it again?
---
Toxic Larry's Meat and Go in the Mire spawns 3 Snallgasters every time. They drop 5-8 Acid each. It's a great location because the area is wide open, so you don't have to hun them down at all. 
---
Also the Flooded Trainyard in the Bog spawns 5-7 of them, but those ones you've got to find in amongst the trains and buildings. More time consuming IMO.
---
In my experience the crickets at Tanagra Town are the fastest, but these are easier enemies to deal with if that's what you're looking for.
---
If it ever needs to be repaired. I mean my SS chest piece has been repaired twice since April as with the rest of my gear which is not SS I am repairing daily.
---
Yeah the engine isn't the newest so to speak.
---
I just finished LITS on a private server and there were no issues with the meat piles.
---
I seriously thought this was my game broski until I saw your handle. 🤣 Any time you hear a random explosion in my session, it's usually him blowing up a car or ten off in the distance.
---
If you find something pls let me know.
---
I only found 2 naturally in 160+ hours. The others I bought from a Player vender and was given one by my friend
---
According to wikipedia, America currently has 3,800 (so probably way more because who would actually disclose that information) nuclear bombs in its arsenal. During the height of the cold war they supposedly had 31,255 warheads.
---
Considering those numbers it's pretty reasonable there would be even more kicking around in 2077.
---
I'm not exactly a fan of nw, but I can't argue against your logic either.  You make good points. 
---
The challenges have to apply to all aspects of the game, because there are players who do enjoy them.
---
I build a camp and then leave it for weeks or months. So to me, having to build 20 lights for a weekly is dumb. To get it over with, I take a workshop and plop down 20 campfires as quick as possible. I literally place the same things right next to each other. But, I understand there are people who see that, and probably put a ton of effort into redesigning their camp to use the lights, and probably get a ton of enjoyment from it.
---
My point is just to mirror yours. Do the challenges you want, skip the ones you don't. If you want all the rewards, you might have to do some things that you would rather not...but the rewards aren't exactly game changers either. I like the jangles backpack, but it will have zero effect on game play.
---
Dude, thats a wonderful idea. It would definitely help clean up the menu.
---
i have absolutely no doubt that with the remaining time i could finish it. As i said, i would have done it more casually if i had known how entirely possible it was. Maybe im just able to reap more XP with my playstyle? I camp in the bog and clearing those areas is at least 100xp per creature, it adds up quick.
---
Dont be disheartened, you can do it! 👍
---
Id use the stealth suit instead.
---
Look in player vendors. Usually find it on most servers. 250-500 caps
---
They did increase it by double it used to be 400.
---
The only way to get more stash space now is to buy fallout 1st and use the scrap Box.
---
My T-60 power armor with the Brotherhood Elder paint seems to take loads of rads too!
---
I've been server hopping for the past 6 hours and haven't managed to find it 😅
---
Hoping I'm gonna come across it soon.
---
What did they fix about Tesla rifles? I must have missed it.
---
I actually remember seeing a datamine post about the removal of weaps from the purveyor pool. I don't remember the specifics, but it was something like the dragon was no longer capable of dropping because instead of having a value of 0-2 (I think) in the drop table it was set to 35. Same thing presumably with rippers/cultist blades
---
Those silos *construct* them I thought. Not just a stockpile.
---
I think it's your internet, mah dude.
---
Btw, the carry weight gets better. You can get backpacks + you have your storage, where you can put stuff in. You can also get pocketed armors, which gives 5 to Max carry weight for each piece. I'm sure a few folks in here would gladly help you out(me included)
---
Just gotta manage your inventory bro!
---
I've been playing since the BETA and what struck me was the whole rebuild Appalchia, so I have treated my camp as my way of roleplaying the re-establishment, making each build look like a vault dweller has found a place they like and want to settle down in permanently, my frustration with the build limit comes from that mind-set, I mean if I can imagine it I can build it right?, so maybe i've been looking at the whole build thing in completely the wrong way.
---
Lol. I’ll be on in a

Couple I’m sure I have one on a mule somewhere if you’re still having no luck

---
On Wednesday I was noticing lots of pixellation around the sonic generator after Line in the Sand both times I played, and a bit during parts of Uranium Fever. There was also some lag between making a kill shot and having it register my xp in some instances. But Thursday it seemed to be back to normal. I'm on PC.
---
It adds up over time. Also thanks for adding to the list of people dismissing my concerns by calling me dramatic.
---
Would be much appreciated...
---
People need to take into account, in older games we could store as much as we wanted. In this game we can only store 800 pounds worth of stuff and even then it causes tremendous stash lag. It’s a mess.
---
New Vegas was Obsidian Entertainment game and only published by the IP owner Bethesda Softworks.
---
Fallout 3, 4 and 76 are Bethesda Gamestudio game and published by the IP owner Bethesda Softworks.
---
New Vegas had totally different game engine, that's why it had differences to 3, 4 and 76.
---
RIP Assaultron Helmet
---
Do you use physcotats? Those are broken cause death now apparently...
---
Wait what questline gives it as a reward? That’s news to me
---
Using any weapon that hit many times or dealt massive damage to multiple enemies too quickly would just cause you to stop doing damage. Completely. All your guns would deal no damage to enemies, their health bar would go down and then right back up. You wouldn't even get exp/loot for tagging them. The only solution to this was to leave the server. This could happen on any weapon at one point, but they managed to sort of fix it so that it was essentially locked to those 3 weapons. But it still happened pretty consistently, usually within 10-15 minutes of using them
---
You are not forced to play NW to complete the run. stop fucking crying about NW. If you think you're forced to do a thing because theres an unchecked box next to it you are manifesting mental health concerns.
---
Name one game that Is similar to the fallout experience.
---
 There are absolutely no other online games that give me the fallout fix like fallout 76
---
Wrong. Marry mentioned that they "NEVER" open for trades to which Bilbo replied inquiring as to whether or not they could take stuff out of the trade without approval or something and then Snally explained why Marry might have said said they never open for trades.
---
Exactly this happened to me like 20 mins ago on PC.
---
Run radiation rumble (I got a 1080TI setup) and the far end a dude constantly shooting his/her tesla rifle made the game like 2fps even after it ended and he/she left. Other areas were fine but when I went back later it was still bad.
---
Nah there should be a spending cap rather than a selling cap
---
Well, there is a Trump on the Zenimax board...
---
This made me smile xD
---
No it didn’t, it used the same engine. (Gamebryo/creation engine)
---
It's either Brotherhood or the Enclave, I'm positive it's given as a reward as I've seen it being given to players through quest completion. 
---
Just can't remember the exact quest-line. 😅
---
I wich there would be a perks that pick up recourses that you pick like ammo so you run over the body and pick um the stuff maybe with a checkmark list simular to the searching icon
---
There are 3 silos. You can see the nukes come out of them. 
---
Sorry, maybe I am misunderstanding your question.
---
So I'm melodramatic and crazy now? Wow, what a supportive community I'm talking to. 🙃
---
I don't have problems with them. 2 last night. Using handmade. The more you hit it, the more it will slow down.
---
suggest a semi decent ranged weapon.
---
You can block him for the session from the social tab. It will hide your location. Your workshop claims will still show up i believe though.
---
yep, NW is hard. Im terrible at it. I blame my build, but seriously im just terrible lol. The creature goal i figured out though. I always keep lockpick equipped and spawn next to a safe, then i run away from everyone to the edge of the storm, then hide. Depending on the area, there are a lot more creatures after the storm closes in a couple times. Just by hiding in the bushes i make it to the final 10 fairly often.
---
Now, if the goal is to kill a player... I skip it 🤷‍♂️
---
your "problem" only exists in your head
---
It most certainly is not. I’ve completed those quests on 4 characters.
---
Dozen Government Supply drops in Flatwoods stacked on top of each other. 
---
Queueing up for the terminal and the chemistry workbench inside the church to do the responders quest.
---
&gt;NW aimbots are free as birds, and fly like them too.
---
Hah!
---
Just let me sort them, like holy crap. I pick up a holotape during a quest but don't finish it, pick up a dozen other holotapes, and now I can't just scroll to the bottom to finish the quest. I have to hunt through and find it and I can only see like 4 at a damn time because you give me a TINY window.
---
Ya’ll are acting as if it’s complicated. They did that exact thing with different arrows in Skyrim. It’s called laziness.
---
No, you have the option of swapping skins when you move your camp.
---
If you’re looking to acquire a red asylum uniform, for example, don’t pick up just whatever has spawned.  When you server hop, it will recognize that you looted it and you have to pick up around 250 other items before it will appear again.
---
drop me an invite when you get on Gt: xBetaa 
---
You've just made 250 Caps.
---
 *spoilers* and are built by the robots in the silos, hense the 3hr cooldown
---
maybe take the hint
---
It's not infinite. It caps at 10k of each material.
---
Anthem was made by Bioware. Rushed out the door by EA.
---
&gt;!The nuke silos make the nukes. Once you fire one it takes 30 mins to build another. The silo computer mentions this and also talks about how it constructs robots automatically too!&lt;
---
'semi-rude'?  The child is an entitled monster.
---
:) herd mentality
---
I see what you did there.  (":")
---
Mainly just the cap rewards for me.
---
And a marker on those you need.
---
Same.
---
i am on right meow. one sec
---
Yeah, no joke.
---
Detonators? Have a nuke, you mug.
---
I didn't have a shotgun with any of those effects or armor with block DR yet it still happened, in fact that's the only shotgun my character has in either the inventory or storage, though I do have some weapons with those effects on my storage but not a single shotgun ( which is sad because I'm still looking for an decent pump that is neither a TSE or bloodied)
---
That's weird. Grenades are so overpowered I pretty much stopped using them unless someone is using explosives against me. Same goes for gauss shotty and the M79. I feel guilty killing someone with such overpowered weapons.
---
Yeah, I noticed while farming for the Halloween and Christmas shit haha :/
---
I agree and some good xp in higher areas. Yesterday dolly sods had four rounds of anglers, with two or three of them legendary
---
But isn't bandaid fixes Bethsda's MO since all the experience devs left for other games and studios and we have the lower level devs that are basically only good at basic code fixes..
---
I think it's not only a server related problem. I think it has to do with everyone's PC performances too. Too many items rendering in a zone could make the game unplayable.
---
Exactly. Its an online mmo"RPG" and it´s going to have stuff you like or don't like. i decided long time ago that i was going to take it chill about this run, some days i finish everything and other days i don't look at the challenges. I have disposable income so ill just buy the rest wherever i am at the end of the run. Will be interesting to see how far i can get with this tactic and how much ill  have to pay.
---
I think your right, I mainly wanted something to contribute more in Scorched Earth, just using it with my current build its a lot more effective for the event. I may just leave it as is and bring it out for the Queen.
---
That's bullshit, man. This game has so many things to fix but you'd think giving people point credit for that sort of stuff wouldn't even be on the list...ugh.
---
It's the weird jankiness that I am experiencing after this latest update, everything just feels off.  Every movement, every keypress, every menu option just has this little bit of lag that is really off putting.  Love the game but it is hard to enjoy when I feel I am battling with the controls/lag
---
It only works for people who can't count! HeHe.
---
How about next season we have at least 5 NW challanges, for the people who don't want to be FORCED to play adventure
---
I do run usually run max, or close to max damage cards. That pretty much doubles my DPS. I haven't tried fighting PA without damage cards but I wouldn't be surprised if it takes a 3-5 clips to take them down.
---
Got that same message but it was on a public server, about 8 hours ago. First time I'd seen that message with a 5 minute countdown.
---
Ammo is a big down side, I unfortunately put about 3000 .308 into the ammo points machine just hours before I rolled the gun. Facepalm.
---
We already had somebody come in here and try that one, and frankly if you don't wanna play Adventure go play Fortnite. That's all NW is, just a nuclear apocalypse Fortnite, for the 12 year olds who like their pinata party to have a grim overtone.
---
As others have said, get calibrated legs to get +100 carry capacity. Excavator is actually viable even for things like SBQ fights if you watch your health or use a vampire heavy weapon (at least once in a while to refill health). I take it you already have the perks bandolier and batteries included at max.
---
Mod your normal armor to ultralight (pocketed makes no sense if you live/fight in PA, pieces weigh even more and the bonus does not apply inside PA) or don't wear any at all. And do some thorough inventory cleaning (chems you never use, gunpowder, repair kits, ore, mods...)
---
1) did you claim them?
---
2) are you opening on the character you claimed them on?
---
Take lag into consideration. When playing Line in the Sand I'm always the first to shoot mobs like everyone else can see then after I do and shoot with my grenade launcher. Only after the grenade hits people start shooting.
---
I had taken the race track at about level 30 when a decked out level 70 tries to take it, so I blasted him with my junkies explosive combat shotgun and killed him 3 times. He ended up leaving me a set of raider power armor and giving me the workshop.
---
Drama queen, you do not need to you can easily get to 100 without them. Im at 86 and haven't done any of the nw ones. Seeing as its still got atleast a month left i think itll be easy to get to the end
---
Thats how I use my 1* B gat plasma
---
Relax Mr Proto\_Kiwi, you are not FORCED TO PLAY NW. There is only one thing to do related to NW. There is plenty of score point to get without even touching NW.
---
They need to set up their bethesda display name
---
The glowing meat is their lunches, I just take their lunches after I kill them and you can't convince me otherwise.
---
What game do you suggest people play where they can still bitch and moan incessantly over the same thing again and again, clogging up a reddit subgroup with so much bile, creating a toxic environment they hope they can drag everyone down with them?  
---
'Cause honestly, I think that is how some of them get their rocks off.....
---
Good for you.
---
I don't know why anybody is surprised by the ammo converter none of the work benches in the FO games have great UIs.
---
It won't throw loot away, just the bodies. The meat pile will appear where they died.
---
Ok then.
---
Why won't you tell us?
---
No such thing as aggro on this game.
---
Wow that is sad, there is only one bug fix with this patch that has helped me, and several losses. Now radiation rumble will be even harder to get to 100 ore.
---
I'm a new player. I read some of the rules for PVP, but I guess I missed the little warning that you might make yourself a target when I saw my first workshop and a quest popped up to claim it. I finished claiming and turned around to figure out what I could do with my new find when 1.5 seconds later, I was obliterated in a hail of nukes. Then twice more trying to claim my original junk.
---
Nope, nothing to claim when I go into the menu, usually It tells me I have unopened packs and to press a button to open but with legendarys there's no indication i have anything, and yeah I'm only playing the one character at the moment so not sure whats going on
---
Theyre not robbing you of score, theyre just awarding nw players more
---
donor boxes?
---
I should have thrown that part of the explanation in seeing that you are not terribly familiar with legendary module crafted items. Weapons and armor crafted with legendary modules are always legendary, although how many stars and what the legendary effects are is still random
---
Not true...I k ow plenty of ppl with WAY over 10k of alot of items...
---
If he's mate claims the workshop while I'm in trade he can kill me I think
---
You'll be fine if you keep doing the dailys and weeklys
---
Great so it will be even harder for people who are actually trying to do the event and get ore :(
---
Of course not. I doubt it we gave 10% of that steel to the Brotherhood of Cork.
---
Вайтспринг бомбят постоянно ради фарма флюса и раздутых зеленых гулей. Я часто прыгаю с сервера на сервер и раз в день точно вижу, что на него кто-то кинул ядерку.
---
Другое дело, что тут кто-то специально кинул прямо на твой лагерь... Я бы на твоем месте переехал оттуда, ибо бывает просто могут задеть даже кидая на сам Вайтспринг.
---
You need a quick - "quit server" button for that.  It's fiddly with PS4
---
And they are not changing it for TES6 and Starfield either. Gonna be fun I guess
---
Nice man. You're putting yourself at a major disadvantage playing in first person though.
---
I've never noticed a limit.
---
I have been getting this error on and off for a while now. I am guessing their servers are glitching up?
---
Everything is going to be OK.
---
You can See Zorbos and your ship on the board. As long as your ship is ahead you're good. Thats what I understood
---
It is infinite, it is basically the same as the bottomless bag from ESO.
---
Success!
---
Ouch. Now that you've had the item for a bit longer, is it really only a storage of 2 at a time? How many can you put down in a CAMP and is it budget friendly? And do you have to wait for it to rain for them to collect?
---
Yes, on PS4. I'm noticing vastly increased rendering times for CAMPS and train stations especially.
---
Shots fired
---
😂lmao have an upvote😂
---
I'm not sure if there's an atom challenge to kill players but I'm currently working on my "kill 76 wanted players" and I kill every wanted player I meet, it's nothing personal but since they removed daily/weekly atoms I have been doing challenges I wouldn't normally have done.
---
you need less rare items to repair it. Its another hidden benefit for SS armor.
---
I am asking if you claimed them in the legendary run screen
---
It's just the Torso, Data Miners have confirmed it too.
---
Ward is the worse for me. I sometimes have to restart the conversation 5-10 times before either I get the daily or reward.
---
I just meant that any system in FO4 could be made to be OP and well I think the most fun I had with the bots was making a mortar(? not sure what the mod was actually called) one which rained explosives on everything outside, not that it didn't kill me when I entered a building but it was a lot of fun.
---
All 3 of them for me. All rhe time.
---
I remember when they implemented the bulldozer feature for camps at least that’s what they called it. I was thinking that’s great we’ll be able to flatten ground remove trees , grass, rocks , ect but it turned out to be what we currently have . I’d personally love a feature like this as you could make your camp truly what you wanted it to be . Ended up just buying the elm trees to replace shrubs and such in game but sadly some static trees can not be replaced.
---
Those aren’t bad prices. People who don’t have the plays I’m sure would really like them.
---
No it looks like the life giver healing factor glitch has been patched and nothing said. My health no long bounces back up when out of combat.
---
Yeah, those are cheap to some I have seen. Some have been as high as 500 per plan. O.o
---
Depends if you have the plans offered already or not. Some power armor plans, a few weapons like grognak axe plans.
---
Ah sorry, yeah claimed them from there. I'm level 70 and have a few pick a perk/move a point things stacked up so I wonder if that has anything to do with it?
---
"Patch 22 notes: added a glitch that allows players to change their names but removes all legendary gear from the server they're on when they do it."
---
No it wasn't. They had 10 years.
---
I sell them for 10 caps so if someone sees one they don't have they can get it cheep and keeps people from taking everything like if they are free. Though if I want to clear some weight
---
Whats the difference between number of items and item budget? i've noticed that significant budget is taken up by lighting and defence turrets, but there is no actual "number" that i've seen on the build menus that tells you how much "budget" is taken up by a particular item, maybe if there was then planning builds and camp item atom purchases would become more viable, I mean if I knew I could use it and I wanted it, then i'd buy it.  
---
From my limited understanding of it all, the bugs and stuff are legacy's from the engine they used to build 76 on, I know  in Fo4 a lot of the build glitches I was able to use were exploits of the game engine, and 76 is the same engine?  
---
I'm fairly certain (though like you say maybe not) that there are some really talented experienced people working for Bethesda who are capable of doing it,  it could be an extension to the blueprint part of the build menu, maybe they just don't think outside the Bethesda box, and ideas like that don't occur to them..
---
Not really; to my knowledge, for each junk type, you have the same rewards given. So if you are tapped out on steel, you can gamble again for more plans with another type of junk.
---
Yeah i have everything except the Croc Backpack for the Last Events, but I heard that it isn't in the loot Pool this time
---
Ahhh I did not know this if true 🤣
---
Maybe I should try this build, got a ok Berserker Fixer I've been saving
---
That's just a massive rip off.
---
Correct
---
Damn, honestly as i was reading this i was like “whats sus about this” until i remembered you were at a workshop. I’d have been bandit bait if not for your story!
---
Yes. You are ahead of schedule.
---
I sell mine for 70, will be reducing to 50 soon.
---
Because this is the best darn update ever!!!
---
Mhh this is not normal. In general these are the effects that cause the magic shotguns. But I would wondering if the new patch broke something else lol
---
Alright thanks, i guess i'll Just build a new Base with the materials then
---
It actually made me play nw for the first time and I actually like it!
---
Yeah lmao. They are gonna be stuck with those plans for a while.
---
The only thing that I guess Bethesda hasn’t officially stated is whether or not you have to donate to get the community reward. But I’m pretty sure it’s implied that everyone will get it regardless of donation amount.
---
There are so many of them in the market (even in this one camp vendor) that I don't think they're worth more than 50 caps each. I don't know why you'd hang on to over 100 of each type.
---
The BOS didn't ask for stuff the guy at Atlas just assumed that.
---
Because its clearly not enough. They make you pay for a stash even though you paid full price for a game already. They claimed they couldnt make it more but make it more on a premium membership. Thats a shitty thing to do.
---
Is 10k infinite?
---
Credit to their creativity tbh. It's the wasteland. It's not as if they were glitching or exploiting.  
---
Not something I'd do, but I look at it like it would fit in as something an NPC could do in a well written RPG type game.  
---
I'd be annoyed if they did it to me, but I'd give credit in my head.  
---
Cheers for posting though, it's a good heads up for a tactic that you might come up against in the apocalypse.
---
Problem solved, just the usual Bethesda jank, left the server and went back in and it showed up when I went back in
---
Yeah, Bioware. Ten years? You make a very good point actually!! Oooft!
---
10k steel. And mine won't store more.
---
I sell mine for 10 each and seeing someone buying them really rare
---
I hope so bad that they upgrade to a better one for the next fallout game. I had some issues with the creation club back in fallout 4 that never even got resolved... I just litteraly couldn't enter it. The engine is to outdated to make this game truly great.
---
You actually need 1,750,000 XP to make up for the NW score which is just a bit over HALF of what you make it to be. A level up around 150 will take care of it.
---
If you want to finish it as much you say, then commit to the goal either by grinding XP or participating in something that's not appealing. You gotta do something for it, you're not a toddler to have everything handed to you without an effort.
---
It is, but you just have to be careful about Zorbos catching up. He moves forward by one everyday, while at your rank you’re probably only taking a step forward every other day since the amount of points needed keeps rising.
---
It really doesn't add up, you get waaaayyyyyyyyyy more score just by playing the game normally and getting the xp repeatable than the time you spend playing NW
---
Well congrats to you! Glad you liked it. Not everybody had that experience though. But glad you enjoy it nonetheless. Have fun.
---
Daily scrip limit is AIDS, this is why people exploit your game Bethesda, because you've designed it to be so oppressive to the player. If you don't show us,the players any respect,we won't show you any.
---
Different items require different server space. In all probability it wouldn’t cause a huge amount of problems unless u got 15 camps full of paintings. Display cases every wall paper and lighting etc etc etc. Think about how much stuff u could actually put in a room if u wanted to
---
Ok. Sure.
---
If the developers changed the name of the keys/keycards and so on a little bit by adding a \~ to the names, they'd be on the bottom of the miscellaneous tab. That would be a great change.
---
It's the morning where I am, and I'm always much nicer in the morning.
---
Why is nobody talking about the Mr handy buzzblade price. They are almost as common as the mole miner gauntlet plans.
---
Ok. So if I doling have any of these plans and I actually wanted them I would actually purchase them.
---
I'd give you a standing ovation but I'm in a wheelchair so here's a cake 🎂 xD
---
what do you need to access in the misc tab?
---
From what I can tell, it has something to do with the Tesla rifle. I have only experienced this when someone was using one. It seems to arc differently now. It used to instantly arc when fired. Now it is delayed between each arc. I think as long as someone has it equipped, every shot they have fired leaves arc generators behind. Little invisible arc projectile spawners. They build up and lag everyone. I am still trying to test and confirm this though.
---
I think you are assuming that Bethesda knows how to fix things.
---
\[Killer Munchkins\]([https://imgur.com/Et8WkpL](https://imgur.com/Et8WkpL))
---
Until they update NW to make it more appealing, add better rewards, and some more improvements in the form of bug fixes, cheating prevention(now there are load-in bugs), and polishing before it is appealing to me. So I agree, having the NW challenge isn't really helping improve NW, and it isn't much of an appeal to many players that normally don't bother with the gamemode.
---
Yes, the nukes are lore-friendly and you’re going to learn about them by playing through the main questline. But from a lore perspective, I don’t really like the idea of vault dwellers being able to handle nukes and (spoilers ahead) &gt;!i think the overseer also mentions something about us having to secure the silos instead of nuking each other!&lt; and &gt;!even roger Maxson refused to use nukes against the scorched!&lt; so &gt;!if I’m understanding the storyline correctly, the idea is that we weren’t supposed to use the nukes but we did because they are the only way to kill the scorched and their queen!&lt;
---
i call it the minecraft power armor because its so blocky
---
Yeah mines lagged out a few times doing line in the sand, i found though its not the meat piles but picking up the weapons is whats making me lag now, so having too many weapons in my inventory is slowing my game to a standstill as when i scrap them, the lag goes again, so i think it might be bethesda attempting to track weapons as part of a possible dupe fix?
---
Are you on Xbox? I could give you 500 to donate.
---
Lmao wow you almost got killed for junk in PVP that's sooo intense
---
"This is honestly unfair."
---
I can understand you not liking a game mechanic because it doesn't fit your play style - as with any game, it is about personal likes and dislikes.  But to say the way an optional part of a game is 'honestly unfair' to you because you don't personal like it does the following:
---
1 - does indeed make you sound overly  dramatic.
---
2 - also makes you sound entitled and selfish in thinking a MMO game that must service a huge player base must be tailored completely to your play style.
---
3 - makes people wonder if you truly know what the definition of 'unfair' is and if you've lost perspective.
---
4 - makes people wonder if you are just trying to stir shit up because you aren't happy about something and want to take everyone down with you because misery loves company.
---
Lastly, you have every right to post what you want on this sub, no matter how much you think you are right and no matter how misguided others think it might be, but it is 'honestly unfair' of you to try to control how people respond to it.
---
Everyone gets the reward for meeting the goal, even if you don't donate.
---
You just don't get any of the individual rewards, which are good for newer players, or players still looking for plans.
---
Yeah it’s circle on ps
---
I guess my wording was bad. EA doesn't just let any old trash out the door. I read that wut Anthem at one point the scrapped flying after saying it was in the game and EA was like no figure it out this is not the game you told us it was gonna be. Idk Zenimax let's Bethesda handle this game this way
---
It's meat/ash piles.  My system was running the game fine at ultra settings, post-patch I started dropping to 20 fps with freezes and ctd at big events. Updating my graphics drivers helped a lot, but it is still a thing.  They changed something behind the scenes with dead mob piles.  I believe they were trying to do something with dropped items and acting as a container that was being used to exploit multiple copies of legendaries being obtained from one meat pile (which required very specific circumstances).  So another example of breaking the game to avoid a very rare and minor exploit.
---
It could just be that they couldn’t afford for an entire server to have that infinite or a much larger amount. Same reason why private servers can only have 8ppl at a time
---
Yes I am, but no thanks. If there really are No new rewards i dont want to encourage Bethesda to be lazy by participating
---
I think the idea is that you go and collect junk, weapons and armor to scrap to donate that. Not everyone donate what you have on you. 
---
Steel is the most common resource in the game, and the easiest to get.
---
**First of al**l..... WHAT? **Second of all**, if a strip club CAMP build in a game that is 18+ offends some people, those people have no place in the wasteland, like why would that bother you? In a game where you kill everything and is about living in the world after the apocalypse. How is a strip club that doesn't even have dancers offend people? Are people really that sexually repressed that this bothers them. **Third of all:** WHAAAAAAT? **Fourth of all** yeah.... no words, **Fifth of all:** Those people should try out Farmville or plants vs zombies or something   
---
What is their argument, i genuinely want to know
---
Fully accepted!
---
I think he's just nuts. Asks me to go find a thief who took something, slips that item into my pocket, then acts grateful I found it and brought it back. 
---
I think he's just low key trying to get the other settlers there to kill me, thinking I'm a thief.
---
That person either came across a dupers dump of plans, or is a duper themselves.
---
I dump all mounted plans I get or find, because they have become worthless. Maybe in a year or more they might have some value.
---
Yeah but what for? I already had to discard tons of mounted Plans Plans after the MOLEMINER Event
---
The lag may be related in part to the stash, but it seems to have a very strong correlation to the number of items in your character inventory. My main character and a mule both have full stash boxes, but the main has far more items under aid/misc/notes. The difference in responsiveness when accessing the stash box, vendors, or work benches is night and day. The character with the higher count of items has far more lag.
---
Okay, if you change your mind let me know!
---
Yeah same, I started late and I never did a single NW challenge and I’m at tier 50 now. It’ll be impossible to reach tier 100 but It doesn’t matter
---
 My system was running the game fine at ultra settings, post-patch I started dropping to 20 fps with freezes and ctd at big events. Updating my graphics drivers helped a lot, but it is still a thing.  They changed something behind the scenes with dead mob piles.  I believe (just a guess) they were trying to do something with dropped items and meat/ash piles acting as a container that was being used to exploit multiple copies of legendaries being obtained from one meat pile (which required very specific circumstances).  So another example of breaking the game to avoid a very rare and minor exploit.
---
i heard there's a purveyor sale coming up, tied to the community events that are happening right now.  i'm not sure when it is, but i'm getting both of my characters up to 1000 scrip so i'm ready for that. i always buy 3\* weapons because that's my thing, but if you want better armor then go for it.  also keep an eye out in people's vendors - people tend to sell legendary armor for pretty cheap (compared to weapons anyway) and you can get good pieces that way
---
Honestly, this is probably the most logical explanation I have seen to this complaint.  You deserve all the upvotes for putting perspective on this.  A serious thank you.
---
No mounted heads in the loot pool for this. Weapons, armor and mod plans are all I've gotten.
---
I have a quad faster fire rate 10mm pistol (51 round clip) and a quad faster fire rate handmade (85 round magazine) for my full heath days and bloodied FFR 10mm and handmade for XP days. Love a pistol back-up.
---
Nobody wants to be Hawkeye
---
I just realised that, maybe I need to re-read my writing before I post things.
---
I think if you farmed the treasure hunter event a LOT it's possible to get that many. There's not really a reason to dupe those plans, they're not worth much.
---
I like the one set where the bears are wearing gas masks and are getting ready to cook meth on a chemistry bench Xd
---
At level 5 (after 2 days you should be past that) you can go into Gameplay settings and turn on Pacifist mode. You won't hurt any other players that way.
---
Thank you very much!
---
How do you know that "large majority" of the player base can afford 5$ a month instead of 11.99$ a month? Or is that just your opinion or felling? Anything to back that up?
---
Cannot be in bulk format. Also, we may have met the goal and it might not allow further donations.
---
I think Im on 55/100 right now. Im waiting to see how far I can get before I use the 10,000 atoms I have.
---
I missed the word hours. But will be about half hour I guess. What’s your GT
---
The camp ones are great for me, I drop the camp, strip down to my underpants and run round the server till someone kills me, none of this hiding in bushs for 10 minutes crap.
---
Ok troll.
---
Much appreciated
---
Ikr? I'm level 445 and can't imagine needing backup for anything tbh
---
that happened to me last night too (stashed ammo and limit went to 804).  it freaked me out and i immediately withdrew it lol
---
Are you sure he is not doing damage? I had one and had to make replacing him a top priority because he was damaging my camp. Maybe they patched it - typical Beth prioritatization
---
You werent around for the marcygate of fo4 i suspect then
---
Erm... Well no. But they aren't going to make that stuff free.  £5 a month is pretty affordable.
---
What detonators is he even talking about? I dont rememver ever doing a mission that involved detonators
---
It's mostly about having a list to do and a challenge to meet and to get it out of the way so maybe I could go back to enjoying this game like I have every other game in the series. I don't like it hanging over me like a sword of Damocles. 
---
I do have my own goal of the things I wish to collect, but until I get there, it just dangles there. Sure, I could force myself to sit there and just grind that repeatable to get there in like a week, but that makes it a fucking job that I'm not being paid for at that point. It's not a game anymore. I don't want to make this game not a game to me. 
---
Any obstacle keeping me from it is a detriment at this point. Maybe that knobhead calling me crazy is right. Maybe I'm nuts. Maybe I have OCD or something. But I just wanna get to the things I genuinely want and then things can go back to chill mode for me.
---
But I get it to an extent. This game is not a PVP game though, there should be no bearing on if you play it or not when it comes to challenges, unless it's a PVP-only challenge.
---
New players do. Also players that are coming back because of the BOS and other things and missed the events.
---
Well, you are right, poor Bethesda bois cannot even make a good game let's not make their lives even more messy by asking for reasonable features.
---
I just stood there and watched him wail on my razorgrain for five minutes.
---
I would like to know what does stacking the cement blocks on top of each other have to do with glitching we were able to do this in F4 please bring this back.
---
Good to know, but i have gotten everything already
---
Ah yes, not quite out of no where but that will do it too
---
Those are probably left over from Christmas. The Christmas boxes, which got heavily duped, gave caps, treats, and plans. When the Treasure hunt event was on, Dupers opened all their duped Christmas presents, took the caps, to buy pails across their multiple accounts to get as many as the rare plans as they could. 
---
They would dupe the mounted head plans, because you can't vendor sell them, and they take up weight. 
---
I seriously doubt this person was able to kill over 700 Treasure hunting Moleminers in the time, and got just these plans over and over.
---
Fair enough, how do you then see them gathering money to keep the game alive? I´m not saying Bethesda needs handouts, but this kind f a game needs some sort of monetization to survive. How do you recommend doing that? Nobody needs the Survival tent, nobody needs the scrap box, nobody needs private servers, but it´s available for those who want for a price that then goes into further development of the game.
---
Going to have to agree with you there I hate Ward but my hatred for ward has nothing on my hatred for Marcy
---
It's great for scorched earth, particularly for taking care of small creatures in tall grass (due to the explosive effect) or quickly dispatching enemies that pose the greatest threat (usually poison attacks in that situation). However, the SBQ has high explosive resistance, so it's less effective on her directly. It's also not a subtle weapon, meaning stealth is not its strong point. You may be better off using it in power armor with the stabilized perk.
---
Some people just get bored I guess.  I am level 370 and went to the junkyard when I saw it flashing for defense.  When I arrived I saw that the two lower level guys who claimed the workshop left.  That kind of hurt my feelings  lol  I defended the workshop from the gouls and left.

If you don't, I dunno what you're doing other than chilling at your own camp or something lol
---
lol! perfect :)
---
It wasn't a mod on f4 was it? I used to really enjoy scrapping all the old rusted cars and dead trees and actually getting scrap for doing it.
---
I prescribe 1 CC of hot lead, delivered optically, STAT!
---
Haha I was but Ward just really annoys me so much. Never hated a game character before. But him 🪓🪓🪓🔪🔪🔪🧨🧨🧨💣💣💣💥💥🤯
---
I'll be on tonight if you wanna team up and try it out!
---
They’re one of the only ways to break your own stuff, they’re fine the way they are
---
Ah I see thank you, is there any way to un-bulk it?
---
Did they not teach students how to use capitalization and periods at the grade school you went to/still go to?
---
(Sorry - I couldn't resist a little low-level trolling just now.  It's a sickness - I can't help myself.)
---
;)
---
I agree with you 100%, I loath this stupid game mode. Wouldn’t be half as bad if it was actually BALANCED.
---
One example, one match I spawned in I got lucky with a big crate, got marine armor, 50 cal, stims, I was good. Take off running with my stuff and someone hits me with A cryo grenade and instantly kills me. Ignoring the fact that cryo nades aren’t supposed to do damage like that and only drain AP, it’s bullshit to get the best armor and still be insta killed by any grenade or explosive.
---
Another match I did, I ran around and found FOUR giant chests. And a suit of power armor. (Which I assume is better than marine armor.)
---
Get all that and run around not seeing anybody for 10 minutes, first encounter I get? Some dude shoots me three times from 10 feet away with a gauss shotgun and kills me within two seconds. No game should have insta kill cheese like this, especially if you have the best armor.
---
Both situations I had the better armor, better weapons, and tons of stims, and none of it mattered. This game mode is horribly unbalanced. I loath Bethesda for even forcing me to do this just get score.
---
(And before you simps come in defending NW challenges saying “yUo DoNt NEED tO PlAy iT-“, I’m at the last 10 levels in the legendary run. I’m getting to the point where the score from the NW challenge or level up challenge determines weather I level up in score that day or not. Even before if I hadn’t done any NW challenges I would be so far behind in the legendary run, so don’t come at me with that BS.)
---
TL;DR
---
Fuck Nuclear Winter and Fuck Bethesda for making us play it for the seasons.
---
Scorched pets will always try and trash your base. The noise finally got to me and had to swap one out a long while back.
---
As someone who playes NW alot, i LOVE that there are dailies tied to this gamemode
---
it brings people to actually play NW so the lobbies are more populated
---
also ive met alot of people that got into the gamemode because of the score and ended up loving it!  
---
so im all for NW dailies
---
It’s a very good weapon but bloodied stealth commando is still a better build overall for damage. I’d try to trade it for a bloodied handmade. Unless you just really want to go the heavy gun route.
---
Manually scrap it at a workbench.
---
Vodka and Stimpaks - yay -.-
---
This speaks to me on a deep inner Level 😂😂😂
---
Thanks for lmk.   I was pretty alarmed when I showed up there expecting to earn XP and there were only level 1 eyebots.
---
I get cork without scrapper
---
I wouldn't mind but just let us know lol 😆  I was dying over and over im like im sure im not that useless. Just used to coming out if combat and my health regeneration kicking in but then again it should regen with my mutations.
---
More players = more enemies = more XP.
---
The have never done this in any game why would they now
---
Stopped donating during day 1 after receiving ten packages of complete shite. Not worth my time, caps or resources. I'm literally just logging in, doing SCORE dailies and leaving. God I hope the BOS update is good but I have so little faith remaining...  I'm also convinced the upcoming TV show will be a fucking shit-show as well if it's informed by the same people making this game.
---
Can I store them in my stash, or do I need to totally get rid of them?
---
I fucking told all of you, a lot of people told all of you what was going to happen. But of course we are just haters riding the hate train.
---
I remember the day yall started buying FO1st and betrayed the rest of the gaming community. Now you get to sit in your own stink because you are addicted to this pile of steaming crap.
---
Me to and sometimes it randomly makes me lvl 1
---
For like 5 minutes
---
"The Brotherhood of Steal want's you['re stuff]!"
---
The older game only had you playing it. This game has everyone on the server stashes and inventories.
---
\- I am, forced, FORCED, to play 
---
what will happen to u if u stop playing games? is it a medical condition or someth?
---
oh, yea i noticed that. I thought it is my internet (logged in the first time after patch yesterday evening). I have a maxed out camp (item wise), but never had problems with lag / stuttering. But yesterday i noticed that my performance / lag when i'm near my camp is pretty much noticeable. 
---
I also have the feeling they ninja fixed something about the recoil of guns, my handmades behave pretty much differently when it comes to recoil (its muuuch heavier than before).
---
Your story above is exactly how I thought this would happen: that they would send a BoS scout ahead to survey the area and see that it was safe to settle
---
If you don't like the prices just ignore this vendor and go to other camp, no one force you to buy. I think 150 caps for each mounted plan is ok price for someone who started playing lately and missed the previous events.
---
Mine's roars were destroying my walls. Ridiculous if they "fixed" that but left the whole taming game a total abortion otherwise.
---
I thought that it's because the event disrupts the ground in Charleston
---
D U P E R S.
---
Now everyone tell me I'm wrong. While at the same time making posts about how dupers didn't get banned because they have multiple accounts and mules to move inventory around.
---
This is actually a beautiful observation, siccinty put, that perfectly encapsulates our reality.  Bravo, maestro of words, bravo!
---
Why did you buy them? The little green ship has 30 levels to go.
---
I'd just play the game like before the run started, dailies and events.
---
1: Fine, whatever. I'm completely unreasonable with my displeasure, or whatever.
---
2: I'm not saying the game has to cater to me, let the PVP kids have their PVP. Just don't rope people into having to do it to meet goals like Destiny has.
---
3: I guess? 
---
4: People have the right to their opinion about that, but I will say that's not my intention. I'm voicing my opinion because a lot of people voice their opinions about something they hate about this game and I would also like to do so. Other threads then get into discussions about the topic. Apparently mine struck a nerve or something. 
---
And to your end point, I've had quite a few people do more than disagree with me in this replies section, and do only that, so I think asking people to not just come in here and do that is fair. I'd prefer a numbered list telling me how I'm wrong, because we can actually talk about it like we are now. It's constructive criticism, instead of people coming in here and telling me to not be dramatic and crazy and dipping out.
---
not true for PC
---
Storing them in your stash might help a bit but there’s not much reason to keep 99% of Holos and notes
---
Infact if you dont get the required upvotes you dont get customer support! Maybe I'm thinking of another game.....
---
🦀🦀🦀$13.99🦀🦀🦀
---
They still do. I'm level 15, at a train station. Some wonderful Level 159 dropped me 40 stimpacks, and a shit load of rad away and radex. I was shocked. And so grateful.
---
I moderate to high ticket items and it's very common for me to find bags filled with grenades, booze and these plans right next to my vendors left by people opening stacks of these gifts for caps to buy my stuff. 
---
The plans go to the overseers camp box and the other crap goes to robot venders.
---
Honestly idk. I had the atoms. Nothing in the Atom shop I wanted. I just bought them.
---
Transferring on private still works fine for me.
---
FO76 plays many years before FO4. And look what they have done ... Resist the beginnings :)
---
Never had an issue with more than 10k of any item... It's odd that yours is limiting you because that certainly shouldn't be the case. File a ticket because you're paying for unlimited scrap and it's not happening as it should.
---
so it isnt just me. did the radiation rumble event today and swapped to the CSA like always for this event or nuke zone. never had radiation problems but today, i died of rads while collecting ore which never happend before. thats why i didnt look at the health bar until it was too late to pop that radaway.  
---
did they buffed the rad amount that big?
---
Funny to see what all those kidos call a cheater these days lol
---
It was a genuine raider style exprience
---
I'm looking at the guys who think it's funny to insist on pvp with people who don't want to do it, along with the ones who one-shot legendaries.
---
I accidentally picked up one of the weird random items that he sends you out to find just sitting on the ground. And ever since I haven't had to actually do the quest, I just go talk to him and I get the reward.
---
Wait what ? So you can’t transfer items between characters in your private server anymore ?
---
If none of us cared, this reddit sub would be crickets and tumble weed. No harm in making an observation.
---
I am a hoarder so weight reduction is the key for me.  I used to keep a few of everything but in this day of mostly one or two shot kill weapons grenades are kind of useless.
---
Espicially the VATS chance and when someone one-shots a legendary are indeed annoying. Changing your weapon via the favourites tab lags always and is pretty annoying too.
---
:) thanks mom. ;)
---
That is a bit ridiculous!
---
If I had more than 10 of the same plan for sale I'd kinda get the hint that they were too expensive and that no one wanted them. 
---
I bet you though, this person won't put them down to a reasonable amount and/or dump a load outside vault 76..
---
Ehh glass will be an easy farm that shit is literally everywhere
---
Meat piles are now black holes of graphic resources. Bethesda knows why because they never were before this update. What did you change that isn't in the changelog?
---
Endgame wastelanders: Faction, gold bullion
---
Legendary perk cards: Upcoming, level 300 unlocks all 6 perk card slots for all your characters

---
What's your gt?  I'll help you "fix" your base
---
When someone or a group of higher levels tried to take it over, if it was just me playing I’d get on the mic and try to reason with them and be like let me get in a group and then when I’m done I’d leave the server that way they’d get it without wasting caps or ammo. But if it was a dick and morty situation, I’d just have a group of people group up and we’d own and chase them off the server...so short story long, I’ve learned people who are bored enough they’ll help come up the laneway and go on the property
---
I ran into the same problem and server hopped many times trying to get it to work. It finally clicked when I went into a private world and tried handing it in. Super odd but if you want to give that a shot it might work. With limited info my current hypothesis is that perhaps the quest stops working on a world after a player has completed it? Which may explain why server hopping works as your surfing around for a newer world. If you don't have fallout 1st you can send me a friend request and I can   get you in a private world to try.
---
It's a 12$ product that is broken. If it's circle jerking then I don't know what to tell you. Keep simping for a company who doesn't care for you, buddy.
---
Well good for you I guess. Enjoy that.
---
same. but since the patch, for me at least, you have to listen to his full ramble before you can scam the reward.
---
So I play on ps4.  Before the update i was getting kicked from servers 3-5 times in an hour and had a lot of lag.  After the update still a lot of lag but I am not getting kicked from servers as much.  Still having game crashes and now  first time loading issues.  I swear over the last month this game is falling apart.  I love this game and it's the only game I play.  The fast travel bug seems better but rubber banding health is still bad.
---
well, I havent collected its water since tuesday... aaaaaand it can only hold two dirty water
---
you dont need to rain in game for it to collect water. you can place more than one at a time, gonna check how many and tell you later.
---
I have no idea its budget cost, but I’ll assume it’s the same as any other dirty water source ie sinks, well and water pump.
---
Known bug for a while now.  Not sure if they are working on it or not.
---
There is a limited work around - use a different window type wall, wallpaper it, then switch it to the wooden style.  Should work, but only until you log out - then you have to do it again.  Not ideal.
---
Destiny is the best example I could think about, yup.
---
Evidence? Oh yeah, you have none except it happened once a long time ago during a flawed event.
---
Ps4 over here.   
---
I don´t think they really test everything out properly on the consoles. So somethings that might work on PC might brake something on other systems.
---
One Violent Night would benefit from this as well. I’m happy to sit down and play the mouth harp to make sure the NS shows up, and hope that the others protect me while doing it. But I miss out on a lot of XP if I do that. 
---
Yesterday there were 4 3* legendary ghouls that showed up.  The cost of not being in the shooting gallery it too high.
---
I don't think it sucks. It forces inventory management (lite), which is part of the games charm.
---
Yes. That would be nice
---
Hmm. Didn't think of NW. I've got all my desired gold items. I've got my JE heavies and stuff 
---
 Probably will do NW
---
These kinds of things are good because when you watch developers play their own "end-game" content it's easy to tell how much they actually play the game.  Can be very eye-opening.
---
My problem is  I have a perk pack that doesn't go away. Everytime I switch out perk cards I have a perk pack to open. I think I have over 100 bubble gum because I keep opening the pack with the hope it will finally stay opened.
---
Ok this might explain some stuff, cuz I was just running all over the map all willy nilly and was getting one shotted a lot!  Thanks for this! :-)
---
Ward burning CAMP decor, pls.
---
Ok so your post is basically, "5$ is less then 11.99$? Please cut somethings out of the service you offer that i don't want so i can pay less"
---
I've seen this glitch before, just confused since I had my tent at atlas.
---
How much do you want to bet that the camp competition after the colossal problem thing will have 2 sided walls in atleast one camp.
---
Hmm I haven't tested this because I always use a friends private server with them staying on it so there is less chance of issues arising but I have not heard anything like this.  Maybe I will test when I get home and see.
---
They 'fixed' those silo run glitches because it hurt no one and only meant more nukes were launched.
---
Bethesda do NOT want us to enjoy the game beyond what THEY sanction, they are obsessive about this, anything that is out of the box they must see as a threat to the mighty $$$.
---
Force the players to grind how we ordain. They seem blind to reality.
---
Awesome!  Thank you for that!  And I am currently using some of those useless perk cards, so it's good to know early on that I should be using my perk points more wisely.
---
Sorry for typo. Fallout 3 and New Vegas did have same engine (Gamebryo), but due to it's capabilities becoming outdated, they (Bethesda game Studio) created Creation engine that was eventually used in Fallout 4 and 76.
---
But New Vegas and Fallout 4 did not use the same engine. So my point stil stands, and it don't matter if you dislike it. It doesn't change the facts.
---
No, you still need to find, craft or repair existing power armour in-game through your own gameplay. The junkyard skin is just a trait that gets added to the power armour which you've acquired. What's being said here is that once you've added that trait, it seems to come with a radiation vulnerability which is annoying.
---
Hey, if you wanna trade all your junk for some boxes with plans in them that you can find in player vendors for 5 caps a piece then do you. But I’ve got enough junk to trade for any weapon in the game I wanted. And I’m not gonna part with it for a fake community goal event.
---
What a mentality.
---
Try changing it to another wall apply wallpaper and then change back to a wooden wall again, that bug is in the game since a few patches ago.
---
Stop talking about it and it won’t!
---
The Legendary Run shows another monetization path, and focuses far more on aesthetics instead of game functionality. 
---
And if FO1st had moddable private worlds, you’d see a lot more people jump to pay for that.
---
Same thing happened to me. Also— I’m pretty sure it was trying to snack on my generator
---
Don't ask for things that will be broken for months after release, please T\_\_\_\_\_T.
---
I'll have the chicken, and the coop... Dropping Fallout First... Then Dropping the game... Tired of wasting time getting 600 ammo to kill three level 80 glowing scorched and a radrat.  
---
NUFF SAID
---
FU FO76
---
Totally.  With their dumb damage cap from overreacting to bloodied and sniper builds, now you need a fast firing weapon to even have a chance.  They didn't even fix the problem, they just moved it to a different meta.
---
Yeah I need to give my c.a.m.p. more attention for sure.  I haven't set up ANY purifiers or anything.
---
That's what is good about this game. Factions all have different sides to them.  I never like to side with BOS in any of the Fallout games because they are indeed  complete facists.  Like raiders are complete selfish assholes. That is what is fun about these games - lots of choices to fit your play style!
---
I had the same problem. Bethesda support says they're currently investigating. They recommend server hopping and then trying the fuse then the console. I didn't have any luck hopping a dozen times or so until I went into a private world, then it worked. May be worth a shot perhaps? I just wish I had more characters to test this problem with.
---
&gt;On top of that, they're setting up shop on the neighboring mountain connected by railroad
---
Neighboring what? your camp?
---
i wish i could drop those fasnacht lists, too.
---
For the vault raid to get the gold.
---
Not me but one of my friends has gotten 2 pieces without 24 hours
---
Ha look he doesn’t even have a logo lmao
---
Ah it was just the Brotherhood “asking” for “donations” no need to worry
---
They've REGULARLY shown off 2x sided walls in their camp spotlight of the week. The community manager who comments on on "cool camps" VERY regularly comments on double sided wall camps. At a point they just break shit because they've got utterly no clue how to work in creation engine at all. Some interns they're paying in redbull and "experience" can barely call these developers. Let alone bethesda AAA game studio developers.
---
My evidence is that my dad is Todd Howard!
---
Why? I Play casually. I dont have time to farm Steel. The least amount to donate is 250. I dont know when the Last Time was, when i had 250 Steel.... Why should i Just give it away? I need bullets, Camp stuff, Junk to repair... And even If i decide to donate, i wont Hain anything except a bottle of wine and 3 missiles. If Bethesda Put Work in the Event with new skins, hell even If it was only a new color there would be a reason to participate
---
This character has no plans since she's brand new so can't do that. I found a workaround anyhow.
---
No it hasn't.  I haven't tried it but I hear if you really bug support enough about it with screenshot evidence etc. then they will give you your atoms but it seems like more trouble than it is worth as dealing with them is such a PITA.
---
Game Bryo pretty much IS Creation engine. They’ve used the same engine since Morrowind.
---
I have, but I haven't been able to reroll AP recovery speed increase since, which I want way more than unyielding.  I think it really is a case of unlucky rolls and Todd being a fickle god.
---
I only did 1k. Someone whose duped and has basically I infinite material will auto complete the event. I'm not too worried either ways
---
That’s pretty much what the post says; offer a ‘light’ version with trimmed down features. 
---
And simple economics dictates that a larger section of a consumer base can afford a lower-priced item more readily than a higher-priced item.  I don’t think OP needs and facts, figures or data to support that belief.
---
I currently have 80k Steel in mine.
---
Because you still want the community rewards and are afraid of missing out on them but don't want to take 5 minutes to find a bit of steel and put it in the box.
---
If you have an explosive weapon, put on pacifist to keep this from happening.
---
(actually, unless you want PvP, you should run pacifist all the time)
---
I usually just turn on passive before heading down there to avoid situations like that
---
To the left of the first R is the power conector

I can't wait to get mine, I've been spending all my script on modules, just need to open the vault and get to that bullion!

Yeah I got spoiled with the social aspect of ESO.  One of the things I love about the regular Fallout games is the desolate feel.  Just me and one or two companions.  Being an online game, I have been trying to compare it to ESO's social atmosphere.  Obviously I just need to treat it like I would a regular Fallout game as far as that goes.  The addition of human/ghoul NPC's really helped, cuz before that the game felt ridiculously desolate.
---
Extremely unprofessional of them, I feel bad for people that actually rely on (the very few left) challenges for atoms. Thank you very much for replying.
---
Oh! I did not know that was a thing!
---
I agree with you, but the goal will complete. Ive seen PC players with 2x the requirement of steel in nuka cola quantum. There's gonna be a single PC player spending the entirety of their time turning in massively dupped junk.
---
Oh hell! I need to look into that.
---
Man, i get super excited just thinking about modable private worlds.
---
&gt; Please note: Today’s update brings the new Public Event “A Colossal Problem” to the game. However, we are still making some performance tweaks and doing additional testing before we enable the event. We are planning to make “A Colossal Problem” available with a follow-up update in the next couple of weeks.
---
From the patch note. A Colossal Problem will not be happening today unless their delay was cancelled?
---
Idc about the Community Awards. I thought they maybe released a new set of plans Like when the moleminers arrived
---
That's all the subtlety of an eleven year old with a fake mustache.
---
Next time pick up a baby bottle and some salt. They'll know.
---
No, but I've seen a bunch of tin foil hats since the patch
---
hmm... while there are items/things/places for them, a lot of them are also the names of cattle from the free range event
---
In game, go under settings and set "pacifist mode" to on.
---
There are plenty of folks who purposely step in front of players during the Queen event (right when it ends) so they get shot &amp; can immediately PvP and kill you.
---
I don't know, I've done Encryptid a dozen times and it still won't drop. I've completed all the quests, too. I have a stack of mascot costumes and heads, though. If I found the plan for 1000, I'd buy it immediately.
---
Take some time to rest. That's my plan after the end of this goddammit run.
---
But you are being dismissive too. You're saying just because this person enjoys it, or that person doesn't mind it that it doesn't really matter because you and othe s don't like it at all.
---
You also say NW is PROBABLY full of hackers. You don't even know if it is or not, you're just assuming.
---
You also commented to someone about a Snickers bar, you're the one flying off the handle at people and seem very angry about fortnite for some reason?
---
But that is also going to bring another problem to their monetization, when people can just download a mod with a bunch of cosmetics and camp stuff. or maybe they will not allow mods that do that. it will definitely be interesting to see what and how they do it.
---
I didn’t notice a difference last night (on PS4) a big group of us fought and killed her.   She landed multiple times and people were standing on the buildings and fences.
---
And there ya go.  One of the most requested features from the community, and one that would be justified to have a cost associated to it.
---
I also became bloodied build last year. I first started doing everything I could to carry a lot. Which is around 580 with ribeye. So I used the perk where more rads means more strength. So I was already setup for it. I always used my high rise until I got a bloodied 3 star grognak axe. Fell in love with it and even got a drop of a 2 star bloodied death claw. So I said I’m going to go bloodied. Couple months ago I had a legendary drop a 2 star bloodied combat rifle and that’s when I really changed for me. I never used guns much before. But I switched everything around and now a full on stealth bloodied commando. Purveyors sweet ass gave me 3 bloodys in a row 3 weeks ago and that also including a bloodied fixer. So bloodied is fun as hell. I love seeing those 2k headshots. And I just now started switching perks. I have 15 strength 11 perception 4 endurance 2 charisma 3 endurance 13 agility 8 luck. Going to unload more guns on to an alt so I can switch strength points to other perks
---
Yeah I've seen people with literally 1B+ Nuka cola quantums. still not banned too. There's gonna be some asshole with so much junk they duped they'll be sitting there turning it in the entire event.
---
irl
---
They should let me design the gear and outfits...not some of these really odd clothes.
---
How does pacifist mode work in workshops? Does it auto disable for the challenge?
---
Breath, you deserve it.
---
The silos were designed to be completely automated, including manufacturing facilities to make more...so for all practical purposes, they can keep making replacement nukes for decades.
---
While wait times are longer, on Pc, matches tend to be more full. Most I’ve played since Patch 21 have been completely full. 
---
It’s worth the wait for me if it means matches will be 45+ players every time
---
Man I remember starting to use power armor and needing cores. I was like level 30 and people would wait for me to finish the power up event then would come in a level 300 to wipe me out. Like I don't even lock my machines. Now that I'm well over 100 I wouldn't ever slam a low level with a workshop. I always go around my level to start a fight. I feel like most people won't even try because they're  "videogames aren't fun if I lose" kinda people.

honestly consider it fascist (apart from the one of the bad tactics ending but the canonical ending is always the good one) I find it wrong, sure some groups are racist towards ghouls or mutants, but in the end they are good considering the circumstances, they are in a post apocalyptic world and few factions are powerful and at the same time better than them. in Apalacchia they do not ask them for steel but it is Russel who asks for it and secondly it is an optional thing, nobody obliges you to do it. we must also remember that even if they were hostile towards free states and responders it is thanks to the first Apalacian brotherhood that they managed to discover the origin of the ardent and the best ways to fight them, therefore even if they were exterminated their efforts were not in vain. 
---
PS even destroying the prydwen in Fallout 4 does not make much sense because the problem is not solved, on the contrary, it will make other soldiers of the brotherhood arrive even more aggressive and with the only order to kill everyone for Revenge.
---
You can tell a ton of people aren’t doing it. That steel one should have been done on the first day.
---
It doesn't - Pacifist mode doesn't apply to workshops.
---
If they fo1rst and afraid to get reported they may even do it  on a private with some sort of turbo button turned on.

Try using this
---
You're right. I think also that private servers are tied to the account of the player who has subscribed to FO1st. 
---
In other words, you dupe or screw around on private servers too much you'll get caught.
---
I've loaded into the exact same one since I subscribed. How do I know? I broke out a barrier at fort defiance 4months ago and it still hasn't been repaired. Wouldn't a new world cause it to be 100%? I would think so.
---
How about no
---
Didn’t they include something about this in the patch notes. Something about challenges being fixed?
---
Just use a Tesla and tag em as they drop. Easy Peasy.
---
Not crafted one probably because I've only tried a handful of times and rng hates me big time.on a good day.
---
But I did have one drop from an event. Sadly of all the pieces it could be it chose to go head-to-head with my current strongest...so near yet so far.
---
Totally agree with everyone the scrapping of everything in a workshop was great in FO4. What I have found to work is if you place a standard water pump over the offending item such as a tree or rock it bulldozes it and so far they haven’t reappeared 🤷🏼‍♀️

Not sure what is going on with your box, but 10,000 is not the limit.
---
Well, not to sound harsh, but if you can't spare 11 bucks a month on something you spend 2 hours plus a day maybe you are just not that good at managing your finances. Or maybe you don´t have the money, and that´s ok, you can play the vanilla.
---
Nope, but mine holds more than 10,000. \*shrugs\*
---
If you go Raider. Have to take them from Foundation.
---
They obviously don't give a crap about us. They just removed half of the building techniques from the game and are clearly not going to bring them back. 
---
There is supposedly a bulldozer feature but it doesn't work half of the time. Not only do things come back after you make them disappear with the bulldozer feature but it never works at all in many cases. If you try to build a foundation close to the ground 9 times out of 10 you will have grass and weeds showing through your floor.
---
what is this/
---
yessss the other day i shot down all the escorts and then the little cargo drone hauled ass across the map.  i tried chasing it and taking shots at it but it never slowed down and i gave up
---
Fair point but Bethesda know the PvE part is much bigger than PvP 
---
Fallout shouldn't be!! I'll stand by that notion more than the Sun emits light 
---
When has it ever? Lol
---
Yes.     Get rid of weapons and ammo you are not actually using.       You can’t keep every weapon and piece of armor you find.    
---
Sell stuff you don’t need or drop it.    
---
I try to keep mine at about 750.
---
Yep. Crafted two 1*, and a 3* Uny/1E/Cavalier's earlier. Like less than two hours ago. That was from 73 Legendary Modules 😭
---
I was really disappointed when I hit 100, as a non PA user, the gameboard, stein and planetarium were the items I was looking forward to most, the game board clips through the wall (if you place it as high on the wall as possible, it should display properly, but not really a fix if you want to place it somewhere you can see it properly). The lamps also occasionally bug out and stop projecting the planets and stars and instead just glow purple. Can't really complain about the stein I guess, other than the fact they thought a beer mug was a good reward for hitting rank 100 =/
---
Didn’t receive anything, what’s your ign?
---
Of all the PVP modes there are, battle royales are essentially the worst. 
---
Like I honestly think for all the melodramaticness of my post, I don't think I'd be half as pissed about it if it required any skill or form or time investment to be any good at the only PVP mode we're stuck with, rather than it boiling down to whether or not you got the big basket of goodies or the pipe pistol to start out of sheer luck.
---
Like I know I crap on Destiny's system of basically content locking behind PVP modes all the damn time, but at least I got to go in with a gun that likely most other people were using, in a class with similar stats as most other people, and it wasn't the greatest thing to be forced to do but I didn't feel like it was an absolute waste of my time and a detriment to my progress like NW is.
---
I seem to get it every other attempt, perhaps its tied to how much damage you do?
---
i know that sounds really arrogant, but we don't complain to the airlines that we'd want first class seats at half price, and they can cut out any service to me.
---
He's like Hans with those detonators...
---
ok will try
---
It would be cool if they added things to fallout 1st... Going to drop it for lack of rewards.  No more money to Bethesda until they fix it.
---
Yeah I seen the Free tag next to atomic shop and was left confused as i claimed the three freebies on the very last tab.
---
Yup
---
You can't just slap lipstick on a pig like battle royale and call it a day. It's a hot mess, and a series like Fallout doesn't even need PVP.
---
In the PTS, all of this stuff worked.
---
What the hell happened when they applied the patch to the public servers?
---
I think they addressed only the daily and weekly challenges auto-completing and not rewarding S.C.O.R.E.
---
PC player here, just started this month: RayRayNg 👍
---
I had this pixelation too at the event where you have to play music (A Long Night or something?) where there were a lot of meat piles. The framerate drops like crazy when you pan your camera towards it.
---
Its fixed.
---
Devi343
---
I have seen people with literally over duped 1B nuka cola quantums. There is a 0% chance that some asshole on PC with more duped junk they'll ever use wouldnt be able to auto complete 1.5M steel lmfao.
---
I only have one character. One build. Two Handed Melee. Currently Level 442, and have been this same build since Level 25. Of course, I do also carry a Gatling Laser and a Gauss Rifle for when ranged hits are a necessity, but 95% of the time, I use either the Super Sledge or the Grognak, and have ones for each enemy (I.e. GS, MS, Troubleshooter’s, Hunter’s, Zealot, and a General AA). I don’t do Bloodied or Junkies, so I sold those from my collection. In FO4, I was a Ranged build, but in 76, I’m not sure why, but I transitioned to TH Melee and never looked back. YMMV.
---
Clearly they do because they dont seem to give enough of a flying fuck about the PVP aspect to do something besides make it a cruddy Fortnite clone. 
---
If it were any other company I'd suggest at least putting in different PVP modes so that people could ay least choose their flavor of ass whipping.
---
i've seen probably 20 posts about an 'ounce of prevention' being glitched in one way or another since the update - hopefully beth can fix this soon
---
The photo mode glitch still works ;-)
---
I bought them because im a weak capitalist who wants stuff lol.
---
[https://youtu.be/4M2vx\_RCwSs](https://youtu.be/4M2vx_RCwSs)
---
Yeah I just checked. There was no mention of this bug.
---
Yawn.
---
Yes, I do it 5-6 times a day.  Need those Pepperoni Rolls so I can fast travel.  The Legendaries don't hurt either.  Also an insane amount of junk and food if you pick up all the weapons and armor from dead Bloodeagles and use Scrapper.  Mongrels will give you all the meat you can eat if you have Carnivore mutation.  Blood Eagles also drop a lot of Stimpacks.
---
Thx :) Wich mutations would you like to have?
---
Simple solution to this: if you remove a "glitch" that you know has been used extensively by the builder community, replace it with a working solution that replicates the same functionality.
---
You know, like those zoning laws that state if you cut down a tree you have to plant one (or more) to replace it.
---
But yeah we are talking about Bethesda here so this scenario has a farts chance in hell of ever happening
---
Only on the SCORE board.
---
Everything else is normal. This is on Xbox
---
Lol guess I’m the bad guy, but I don’t take junk. I’ve gone on the headset and while defend is on and demand ransom for the workshop. You’d be surprised at how many people cooperate. I’ve never had to kill once but a lot of people disappear and I get the workshop. Closest element to passive pvp. Hope they add something more to workshops in the future and defending workshops suck as I’ve never been able to defend myself against other players on workshops.
---
That plays for me, like the Grafton Mayor did, everytime I log in one specific character, normally logging in at WSS.
---
Boomer is the one that locks up for me the most, second in line to that is Ward.
---
I'm surprised they are functional.
---
My two biggest gripes with battle royale is 
---
1: Dropping into an area and not finding anything to defend yourself with or some other guy grabs something better than you so you automatically lose.
---
And 
---
2: Dying immediately and then having to spend another 10 minutes looking for another match. 
---
Honestly if NW had loadouts I’d probably like it way more, if I could drop with a handmade every time and not have to rely on luck where I can just drop in and start shouting just for fun that would be great. 
---
(Like a team death match kinda mode, I’d love that way more than a Battle Royal mode.)
---
You’re not forced to play it man.. I haven’t been doing them because I play NW when I chose (and I do enjoy it a lot). I’m not doing bad on the scoreboard. In fact. I’m really casual atm, missed a load of days.. and I’m on par with the other dude that’s playing this board game 🤷‍♂️
---
Well. Its either £11.99 for the bonuses or nothing. There's no harm in creating a cheaper alternative Bethesda aren't going to cancel 1st and give everyone free content.
---
I'm just spit balling suggestions man. I don't want to cause arguments. There no harm in trying. Don't ask. Don't get.
---
I like running missions and character building, but also I do, in fact, go out hunting for shit to cook and build...so I do spent probably more time at my CAMP than others. 🤭
---
But that's just what I'd do anyways.
---
It only takes 250k players to donate 500 steel each to make it. That’s not much at all. It’s taken 3 days when it should have taken 1. The number is totally legit.
---
It’s definitely in the patch notes.
---
Did this patch even do anything useful or did it just break everything? Worst patch to date.
---
I've crafted 4 chest pieces unyielding, because I am looking for vanguard.
---
The only people doing it are people that don’t have a lot of steel to begin with. They’re basically throwing their junk into a endless black hole. It’s not going towards this “community goal”. The people with a lot of junk aren’t turning in because they know that junk is a very tradeable item on marketplace.
---
Get a blog
---
Yah, it def feels better now. While I still wish we had companions, I do like the idea that you can kinda have these random non-pvp enforced encounters with other players. The BoS getting into fights with random raiders was always fun to jump in on, so at least we get a bit of that larger skirmish having random ppl we don’t really talk to participating in the game
---
It fixed Adrenaline &amp; the Tesla Rifle.
---
Everything else appears to either not have worked or broken more things.
---
I just don't get it - how the hell did this pass QA?
---
Like when they showed footage fighting the wendigo colossus and they were barely doing any damage lmao
---
Been mulling over attempting a full health explosive tank build.
---
Fire in the hole/grenadier/demo expert junkies build.  Use only grenades and explosive heavies (fatman grenade launcher or missle launcher) put everything else into survival perks and carry perks (ordinance express/bear arms/traveling pharmacy) see how long I can go before blowing myself up lol
---
I'm curious to see how fast the bar moves during the Cork stage.
---
You are right.  He is moving more than one square a day now.  100% positive of this.
---
Least ya don't get cars, flying crap, agent shite or kids screaming down the mic.. lol 
---
Agreed
---
Simple. They don’t test or play their own games.
---
So I bought the arms and chest with the gold first. Crafted 3 star unyielding for all three with only two rolls. But then the legs took probably 80 each to get unyielding. So don’t always say it is messed up because it was shit before also. But after getting my 5 pieces I am not even bothering with crafting anymore
---
my first character's name is "CRIMINY MORE ROACHES" and my picture is of my boots  
---
i do not regret it.
---
The blood eagle skin now properly works on the compound bow. So it did fix one thing.
---
I feel like dropping the price to 1 is a wasted opportunity to make caps, on the other hand I’ve found myself lately getting up to the max limit, so maybe offloading them isn’t the worst idea. I’m going to change my prices tonight and see what happens.
---
Thats what I’m trying to figure out, I need to move str pts to agl for commando.  I traded up for a non god roll 2* B HM and B Fixer.  I had a 1* B combat rifle from Mole B that changed my thinking of auto rifles, I was trying it with hardened receiver and it sucked.
---
Agreed though that has nothing to do with my point. 
---
It was more that OP skips a good chunk of the run and then says don't get sucked in by the fear mongering of the difficulty of completing it. I'd buy that a little more if they actually completed the full run legitimately and not paid their way to the end.
---
It's like someone ran 80% of a marathon, took a taxi to the finish line and insists that you shouldn't get sucked in about it being too hard to for an average person to complete a marathon.
---
I donated once, got four alcohol and a frag grenade. Noped on out.
---
Enjoy your life
---
No. It just means you can’t hurt them but they will still 2 shot you.
---
I think a lot of the fatigue some people are experiencing is from logging in, doing the dailies, and then logging out, because all they care about at this point is getting the rewards.
---
For myself and my friends, we log in, and complete the dailies and weeklies as part of what we are just doing. Some of course you have to specifically do. Like chew gum, or build camp items. 
---
That would get boring no matter what the game was.
---
Even though you don't have to log in every day to complete the COD battle pass quickly it takes infinitely more play time to level up my call of duty battle pass as opposed to the fallout one.
---
The daily and weekly challenges take only a few minutes each day and they reward a LARGE chunk of battle pass xp.  So yes, while some consider it a daily commitment it by far and away requires less overall play-time to complete as opposed to the Call of duty battle pass which nickels and dimes you for small bits of XP you get for completing matches and doing well etc.  
---
So while the call of duty battle pass seems like the better model, it isn't.  I completed the 76 battle pass without purchasing any levels and with 5 and a half weeks to spare.  I wasn't able to complete this last Call of duty battle pass without buying ranks.  
---
You also don't have to log in daily to make it to rank 100 with the double score and xp weekends.  You can miss some days.
---
I think it's random and I'm just unlucky. I still haven't gotten 1 BOS PA paint from Forbidden Knowledge, but I have 3-5 copies of every BOS outfit. And the current BOS event only gave me 3 prime plans (no other plans) out of 5,000 steel delivered.
---
Play another game until they actually release content.  
---
I’m buying out the rest of my season also and putting the game down.
---
It’s not just a matter of ability.  Value vs Cost is another factor. 
---
Consider the player that has less interest in aesthetics and cosmetics, and only cares about functionality. Atoms have little value to them. They are unlikely to give Bethesda extra money for Atoms, and have been building them up over time from the old challenges and the world/social/combat challenges, and now the Seasons. 
---
They spent their $60 on the game and that’s it. 
---
They see FO1st and are interested in the features like the Tent, Scrapbox and Private World, but $12/month isn’t a good Value vs Cost to them, since they have no interest in Atoms. So they keep their wallet closed. 
---
But then Fallout First *Light* is announced. $4.99 for the three features they actually care about. And now Bethesda gets income from that player that they would not have gotten before.
---
I can afford a lot of things myself in life. But I only buy those products or services that interest me **and** pass my personal criteria for Value vs Cost.
---
And I agree with you, this is definitely up in the top 3 for worst patches to date, with a decent shot at being, overall, the worst. 
---
I would say the patch notes are, by far, the worst - since in this instance, they actually contain information which is patently false.
---
I've been doing my usual but I have my build setup so I can power level easily since legendary perk cards require perk coins. So essentially I kill, loot, and level up.
---
Yeah I'm thinking of picking back up destiny 2
---
It’s a lot but egg head, eagle eyes, bird bones, marsupial, adrenal reaction, chameleon, healing factor, speed demon, grounded, herbivore, scaly skin
---
Yeah sorry i'm a bit late to the party, I only discovered reddit about 4/5 weeks ago, I'm not 100% on how to use it or what to use it for.  
---
And as I wanted to get peoples feedback and ideas on a topic that's been bugging the hell out of me I posted about it, to start a discussion that I could interact with Chipper7773 has been more than helpful with helping me understand why my post was (not dumb) but ill-conceived so its been worth it.
---
That's so messed up. For what?? Some junk and ammo...
---
WhAt mAkEs yOU thInk wE’rE frIEnds???
---
If it's *longer* now, jfc, I don't have half an hour to immediately die and accomplish nothing.
---
Okay, I have a stupid question. How could they kill you without you shooting them first? I thought you had to both engage in the fight for it to actually cause damage.
---
This is why I got the subscription. Don't have to mess with anyone.
---
I’ve been noticing a significant reduction in frame rate since the update and my game has also been crashing frequently. Do you also get low frame rate in the legendary run page? For me it’s extremely slow.
---
Precisely.  It's probably going to be a bunch of food builds trying to take him down with lots of deaths and respawns.  
---
I remember watching the ESO devs trying to complete their DLC dungeon hardmode content and watching them get smacked around because they don't know basic game mechanics and their builds are crap.  Stuff like that makes you realize why these games have so many issues.  The devs don't play their own game except casually.  Not hardcore like we do.
---
It's amazing how such a simple feature that's existed as mods in past games years ago still can't make its way into this game years after it's launched.
---
I was holding a workshop pvp zone
---
Is it hard to breathe with your head that far up your ass?
---
Steal number is probably legit. Cork will be tough. 
---
Things to look for: baseballs, golf balls, globes, decanters, pipe weapons.
---
If you hate it don't play it.  Dont let Bethesda's FOMO tactics work on you.
---
I'm saying that PVP is not at the core of what Fallout is, or has been since its inception, but if they must have a thing like NW, people shouldn't be made to play it if they weren't already playing it by holding a section or two of a separate thing hostage via the score system.
---
Also I've played enough PVP in my time to know that, especially on PC, that shit is brimming with hackers.
---
Yes I did, because I've had mine and clearly they need theirs. 
---
Also Fortnite is a blight on the gaming community. It's not a skill-based game of any kind, it's a gambling machine disguised as a colorful little shooter. Being good at Fortnite is simply being lucky, and it's a massive money sink.
---
You mean it brings in another *option*. If the mods are available in Private Worlds only, there’s no one to see your creativity. 
---
And PC players already have some visual mod capabilities, and still purchase FO1st.
---
It's my main strat.. getting it to sit down and shred it with my PA on for a 9ish dmg per tick on the head
---
I'm not sure since i don't open it a lot
---
I wonder if anyone is going to call them out on bugs and such.
---
I upvoted at 777 and feel like monster now
---
Christ this sub
---
Playing on PC, guessing it was more prevalent on console to begin with, now its happening on PC too. Not sure I want to try reinstalling, though I can try verifying the files as I have the game through steam.
---
This is not a nocturnal rolling pin though 
---
DOWNVOTED!
---
Awwww i thought it mighta just been me. Checkin my comp to see wtf is going on.....welp atleast im not the only one. Very frustrasting when it happens randomly during events : /
---
I use Excavator with Pepperoni Roll, Bufftats and Whiskey to fast travel when I'm really heavy. Can fast travel at weights up to 545 at times. Change into my T 65 when I arrive at Scorched Earth.
---
Does that boot taste good?
---
I just tried right now and can! Go get it men and women!
---
Agreed! It would also be a good QoL to separate food and Aid.
---
Exactly this.
---
Or at the very least show us how much of that ammo type you have in your inventory so you don't have to either try out an amount or close the terminal and open your pip-boy.
---
Take a break. I find taking a week or two off makes me enjoy the game again. I’m 26 levels away from finishing and once I do I plan on shutting it down till the next season, maybe occasionally playing but not every night like I have been.
---
I also contest workshops if i need the mats thats fair and fine. This was just abit of a low tactic. One time after numerous kills on each side. Me and a player decided to have a processor each and share grafton steel
---
how do you manage to set up so many so quickly, I try doing that but I keep getting sidetracked when I get to the power plant workshops and end up powering them up instead. I have no will power as I know they're full of scrap which I must collect first.
---
Except unless you've hit end END game and don't collect anything anymore and shit out all but that one rare legendary weapon that you might use and only carry around like 4 food items and thus don't have to worry about weight, you're going to be stuck in the Excavator Power Armor.
---
I have a full set on my main as well. But just after patch 21 reached the point when I could craft it for my alt. But absolutely unlucky so far. 
---
Good to read that it also took you long. I dont remember it being so hard when I did craft a full set prior to patch 21.
---
oh no :)
---
Very solid idea. I think having a database rather than an actual item would be much better, and better for the server maybe?
---
Wait, so the event is not live and yet they show it to quakecon?
---
Yeah, the whole genre is just hot trash designed to distract you with bright shiny outfits you can buy only with real money so they can fleece you twice for the same game.
---
Not many. After long wait I always get loaded into a game with the people I just saw in last match. If it isn’t for earning the points there would be even fewer players.
---
ouch
---
fair enough
---
HAHA :)
---
Not just that but, like Bethesda, you do Ward a favour and he treats you with disdain. We just returned your valuable item you keep losing. You keep an eye on yourself bub.
---
I think weve beat the shit outta this poor dead horse already...im gonna hit the score cap soon enough and ive only ever done the ez nw stuff, not really a big deal imo
---
Both.  I find it's hit and miss for legendaries when not nuked.  One pass through I made there were 8 3-star ferals roaming around which was amazing.  Usually there are at least 2.  When nuked, it's a great location to farm flux as well.
---
Good for you. How many hours a day do you play?
---
Agreed. At least them they would serve some purpose!
---
lol This is how i met my "best in-game friend."  I had a workshop to defend and he showed up (he was easily 150 levels above me at the time) and I quickly sent him a message asking, "are you here to take my workshop?"  He was like, "no, I'm just helping."  I was doubtful at first but he didn't kill me so it worked out. :D
---
Good for you. Do you play all day every day?
---
Sell all weapons you are not using or scrap them.    For most junk items you don’t really need to keep more than 100 units.  (Except for stuff needed to make ammo depending on what weapon you are using). 
---
I normally only carry 3 ranged weapons and one melee weapon on me.   
---
Don’t bother hoarding missiles , mini Nukes or grenade rounds.  
---
When you find new armor pieces compare the new piece to what you already have.  If it’s better use it and get rid of the old one by selling or scrapping.  You don’t need 4 chest pieces for example.  
---
Be careful with the excavator power armor you were given if you have not done the “Miner Miracles” guest or you could end up not getting the plans if you try to register it before you get the plans from the terminal.  
---
Things will get easier the more you level up as you will eventually have better equipment   
---
Deposit your junk in the “your stash” boxes often AFTER scrapping all your junk. 
---
Don’t forget to learn the plans you get.   
---
Cook food and sell it to earn easy caps if it’s about to spoil. 
---
There are lots of discussions in this Reddit group on what perk cards to use depending on your play style. 
---
Have fun and beware the Mothman!
---
Event xp yes. Kill xp no. When They all spawn in the middle everyone can spray auto weapons or toss a Molotov into it getting the xp for every single enemy.  I probably end up with 3-4x the xp when done with that method. Levelled from 240-243 just in that event the other day.
---
And why in the world aren't they at least alphabetized?
---
or better yet, give us proper mouse and keyboard UI, similar to SkyUI for Skyrim. The inventory in general is fucking trash and one of the worst sins of this game considering how much time you spend in menus
---
Not sure if sarcastic or not. &gt;_&gt;
---
Yup same here, any event where meat piles pile up :-) becomes un-playable so once my frames hit about 20 I stop and go stand in a corner hoping enough people are left to finish the event :-(......
---
What was happening with adrenaline?
---
It just wasn't working
---
3 lvl 1’s. First rank of each gives 10% while following ranks only give 5% boosts
---
Fire rate must be over 200. Or explosive weapon over 100(ish)  shotguns are different.
---
What platform are you on? Steam, Bethesda Launcher, or Windows Store?
---
3x1 gives you 30%, 1x3 only gives you 20. So yes, go for 1 rank in each of the cards.
---
no, I'm talking about the featured tab that don't show im my Atom Shop, since I start to play never show
---
The one nice thing about NW is everybody keeps their mic off. Small blessings.
---
Strange that this bug seems to only affect certain systems (ps4 pro here), I’m still doing line in the sand / RR etc just fine :/ hope it gets fixed, nothing more annoying than low FPS in a game.
---
Yeah true
---
Just put them into a hidden list and be rid of them.
---
it affects every system. check my edit in the original post, seems to happen only when energy weapons are in use.
---
Like I try an squeeze the dailies Iin less than an hour or however long it takes? But I did 78hrs last week and it’s the last thing I wanna do when I finish in a kitchen all day.. I play for like 6-8hrs on my day off though 😁
---
you get told about it at level 5 when you get access to pvp
---
I'm not even a bloodied build, but damn that is sexy.
---
Just drop them. Keep your games in stash and drop the old ones. It feels wrong at first. But you’ll get used to it.
---
hey hey....good intentions and all that. water under the bridge.
---
Lame
---
I'm honestly not even looking to get the top prize tbh. I want that sweet gatling gun skin, that's the top for me. But I just wanna get it over with and there's this stumbling block every goddamn day stopping me from getting there that can easily be...not there. Ya know? That's what steams my hams.
---
Shh, they discovered Institute technology. They teleport in.
---
Institute as a future FO76 faction confirmed lol.
---
Yes.
---
Care to share a source of this info? Can't find it on official forums.
---
Does the lag cause the instant enemy health regen? I've been a way for a while but thought this was patched out. 
---
I use a mostly stealth rifle build and this keeps popping up and I can't keep enough ammo to counter the increased damage needed to take down even mid-level mobs.
---
No there are people dumping 10k plus. That’s why it’s so easy to figure out that a grand majority of people aren’t touching this event.
---
Bethesda doesn't give a shit. That's it, like you said. If they did give a shit, they would have responded with an apology soon after with some indication of when the issue will be resolved.
---
However, since Bethesda only responds to loss of revenue, since no one cancelled their Fallout 1st sub over the issue, no response at all.
---
This. I love playing the instruments during this event. But you know you miss out on xp and/or legendaries. Free Range is the same. At one time I was the only one herding the Brahmin and three guys killed the sheepsquatch with a few shots with me still holding the crook... /sigh. Thankfully I don't care that much about xp and loot, but we could all benefit from a better system for these events.
---
Having the assaultron glued exclusively to my face for the entirety of encryptid despite there being a good 8+ other people around makes me inclined to disagree that there is no threat mechanic "at all". It might be weird and obfuscated and hard to actually utilize, but there seems to be something there.
---
Yes many new bug with patch 21.  This
---
I wasn't able to yesterday, not sure if there's some kinda trick to it or not tho
---
I gotta be the tallest in the squad to assert my dominance 👀
---
Oh, okay, I didn’t realize holding a workshop made you open to pvp. Sorry, am noob.
---
That's rather impressive. I'm a bit of a slowpoke, I guess; missed a bunch of days due to PS4 issues, but been trying to play catch up. About five? squares away from the other ship now but still. That speed bump every day. It's grating at this point. &gt;_&gt;;
---
But that's still pretty impressive.
---
 "They spent their $60 on the game and that’s it."  
---
Majority of the active players now didn't pay 60$, it was already on sale a week after it got released. I'd guess that the average price people paid for the game is 30-40$, Also paying a one time for an online MMO that you want to be around for longer then couple of years and that you spend a lot of time on is going to need some $$$ to keep the lights on and create new content.   
---
"They see FO1st and are interested in the features like the Tent, Scrapbox and Private World, but $12/month isn’t a good Value vs Cost to them, since they have no interest in Atoms. So they keep their wallet closed."  
---
Some people might not find that good value vs cost. Just like you said yourself  
---
" But I only buy those products or services that interest me **and** pass my personal criteria for Value vs Cost."   
---
That is your personal criteria. Has nothing to do with the how others see it or what the actual value is. What is your reasoning that it doesn't have good value vs. cost?  why is 5$ just for those features better then 11.99$ for the features plus 16$ bucks worth of atoms? This argument is arbitrary,
---
Great thanks for confirming this for me I appreciate it. As a junkies stealth commando build I’d be interested in the shotguns using vats so guess I just need a good junkies shotgun explosive
---
Right? Sorting by "most recent" is just bizarre. It's the only menu in the game that does that.
---
I really meant it as a joke. Thought it was funny seeing one post about losing something and another about finding something in radiation rumble
---
Hey! Genuinely curious about your process. Does this content actually go through any form of testing process?
---
Cause like... what's going on guys?
---
Not for me. Lag/ping as usual (it lags sometimes when there's a lot going on). I'm on PC.
---
Also the board works well for me.
---
No change for me.
---
I'm on PC and I've shut off grass and giblets from bloody mess though, so maybe try that.  People's complaint seem to be with meat piles.
---
I have no issues at all playing in first person and regularly reck everyone just fine, I use third person when I'm not going inside interiors or running around tight areas like in the clip, aiming on consoles on third person is complete shit.
---
They hardly ever even fix atomic shop items, I don't have hope for this one.
---
People need to play Fallouts 1-Tactics. Adds a lot of plot.
---
Yeah I don’t like people who exploit this game and the people who play it. Trap bases are another design that are fun if done correctly but a lot of people are no good at role playing and taking peoples flux after the sbq is just stupid and greedy.
---
The power armor gives you some strength points soo it should give you some carry weight
---
Best thing is going bloodied tbh, magic shotgun and all the int buffs. Unyeilding too ofc and just farm events with loads of mobs 🤷‍♂️ kind of pissed off with the meta now as PA are like redundant you gotta be crazy not to run Unyielding
---
Well apparently my Captian Cosmos Game Board Wall Decor doesn't show up on wallpapers unless you remove them.
---
People keep saying the tesla got "nerfed" but I am not noticed any difference in hitting enemies after testing it yesterday.  If anything i was tagging more enemies at LITS etc.  Only difference is that some of the arcs are invisible yet I am still getting damage numbers.  Go figure.
---
Yeah well i always manage to tag at least 80% of the enemies when doing it without that glitch
---
Hit v9 and make everyone go to the brotherhood base in the back. They can stay on the walkway and usually won’t drop tents.
---
Bethesda: Great idea! Did you see the race car bed in the Atom Shop!? Vroom vroom!
---
NO MORE WHINING ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE IRRELEVANT, I BEG OF YOU GUYS.
---
There is enough SCORE you can do the season without NW.  If you don't wan to do NW, don't do NW.
---
Stop fucking whining all the time.
---
It basically just stops you from initiating battle. Like others said, you can still fight in workshops because the second they try taking it they have initiated combat with you.
---
Not sure what happens if you try taking someone else’s workshop though. I think they’d till have to land a shot for you to be able to start attacking them.
---
Like..?
---
Honestly people who play this way are fucking cursed.
---
I like the secret service bacpack. Its kinda low profile and i like it
---
Someone is sure full of themself.
---
I was able to place 3 than went out of budget. it doesnt show a limit like lights or turrets. so as long as you have budget I guess you can place them.
---
Been playing since beta, technical data has not blessed me with a paint either. I tried farming hundreds of technical data with a character that hasn't joined the Brotherhood, but alas they patched that...
---
Any other thing?
---
It's fine for me on Line.
---
However, once a lot of scorched spawned all together in the air (it happens sometimes). When I shot the giant scorched ball with an explosive smol pewpew the game crashed.
---
On PC, with like 20 mods.
---
Bethesda I am not pve player I am playing pvp all day and I can only earn 1 daily score each day If I want full daily points I must force myself to play pve please make half of the challenges NW thanks .
---
Ok, got them! :)
---
They fooked  it up pretty legit last patch, I think they tried to fix some bug but ended up creating more lol, at least their track record is going strong.
---
Mine seems to work ok, not sure if it's as well as last patch but I noticed the beam arcs are invisible but still do damage if I shoot a floor/wall to hit an enemy.
---
How could he have told his story here if he didn't survive? '-)
---
I believe someone had gotten a bit further in figuring it out but as far as I’ve heard no one knows exactly what it means. As far as we know it could just be the order Bethesda plans on releasing atomic shop bundles
---
Cue Tyler Durden: 'You are not your fucking S.C.O.R.E.'
---
Just scroll through the sub for 15-20 minuets and look.  They broke a couple main quests, a few of the legendary run rewards, "fixed" a camp exploit that people were using to make creative builds and people are pissed.
---
Could also look here  [https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker](https://nukacrypt.com/devtracker)  and see what bug threads the devs are replying to.
---
I’m pretty sure I crafted my last Uny after the patch as well
---
Supposedly, they fixed the Tesla bug where it zero’ed out damage.
---
Today, bought three 3\* legendary weapons.   Got two black powder rifles.   This happens CONSISTENTLY, getting multiples of one type of weapon.
---
Maybe some half assed shit Bethesda spewed out. There's definitely not a fully implemented system though.
---
Everyone who sees this guy in game should drop a garden gnome in his camp.
---
GG, bet that made your day!
---
oh really?  Well thats cool i guess haha
---
I have a picture of him playing a guitar while hovering 8 feet off the ground like he’s in the god damn matrix.
---
Bold of you to assume I was able to craft them before the patch.
---
I wonder if this is across all PA skins on all PAs. I'm gunna try this later this weekend.
---
Certain challenges were addressed, like the atom reward for 7600 hours. But I don’t think any of the major bugs were fixed.
---
Fair enough, i think the settlers were designed to be unlikable to be honest so it wasnt so steriotypical good guys bad guys, cus the raiders are more welcoming and relatable but are the "bad guys"
---
Who the fuck cares?
---
Can confirm this is a thing.
---
Consistently crashing after 10-15 minutes, regardless of what I'm doing.
---
I've AFK'd to come back to the game having crashed, tried doing events, heck, I even crashed when trying to craft (worked after i restarted the game) or exiting PA.
---
The patch is a complete mess, unsurprisingly.
---
Bethesda Launcher, I did see that, what ultimately worked was waiting half an hour. Thank you for your reply! :)
---
Quite frequently with Fishbones and Blackeye, rarely with anyone else.
---
Yeah I tried and create blueprint was grayed out so I tried blueprinting it and a power conduit and the power conduit was saved but the ammo machine and its terminal wasn't.
---
Junkies build. No interest in bloodied, so of course all I get is bolstering and unyielding lol
---
Ah, didn't know that. Thanks!
---
While I admire your zeal I don't know if people are going to be banned for this one.   I guess it's possible but I imagine one day this will get fixed and the ammo factories will just disappear from people's camps and blueprint section and that'll be the end of it.
---
73? Damn it, I'm only up to 30 something. I'm sure glad it's just RNG and not that some prefixes are just plain rarer.
---
Maybe this sub with less picture restrictions is something you would like [https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/)
---
It's going ok for me, as usual.
---
But the game crashed twice in a day and it doesn't usually happens that much.
---
PC. I have several mods installed.
---
I saw some guy with 7 of these at his camp at Whitespring yesterday.  Must be nice. (ps4)
---
Someone pissed in your cereal this mornin?
---
Actually some random guy that is excited for the Brotherhood coming wants it.  The Brotherhood just said they're coming.
---
If we're barely going to make steel though, the rest sure aren't going to happen.  Steel is at least 10x more plentiful than the rest.
---
And holo one too
---
Yea, I saw they changed the reward for the 7600 hours. Doesn't really mean much if it the challenges keep not giving the due atoms though. Thank you for replying.
---
The planetarium never projects the image in my camp ever since I got it same thing with the nuka cola lamp. I was looking forward to getting the planetarium only for it to not even work. Even my jack o lanterns I have don't display their faces on the floor
---
“Everyone tells me I’m wrong”
---
By agreeing with him you have destroyed his entire argument
---
Finding out you can pacify all watoga robots by becoming mayor
---
Yeah but...the shop is updated all the time?  Certainly there will be something you want eventually?  Eh, no bother, I'm sure you will get more atoms if you want them.  Congrats on being done and I hope you find something fun to do in the meantime.  Personally, I hope I finish the run during the last possible week.  I hate the idea of finishing early and not earning anything for the next few weeks.  That's kind of the same reason I haven't finished the storyline missions - once I do, what is the point of playing any more?
---
Couratious summed it up nicely. Biggest ones I guess are the broken quests which prevents storyline progress.
---
Oh god, Bloodied is THE big boy pants OP meta right now, ain't it? Even my main with 3 END runs a really dirty/half-assed type of Bloodied to get a stupid amount of DPS with a Primed Final Word.
---
Requires a truckload of Stimpaks but it's wild.
---
I just believe that if we don't hold each other accountable they we may be no better than the glitchers themselves.
---
Yeah same for me.  Mine seems to be working the same as usual except I get invisible arcs but they still do damage.  On xbox for what it's worth.
---
It depends on your frame rate. At high fps even the gaus gatling gun can be magic.
---
There's a bunch of stuff I've learned over my time with the game:
---
* Force quitting the game client in instanced areas means that you can reroll loot and legendaries for say completing a quest (now defunct Radical mask)
---
* Placing a camp item on a mat can allow you to glitch it into positions that you may not otherwise be able to
---
* Adding items to the favourites wheel gives it an extra layer of protection from accidentally getting sold or junked
---
* While most food buffs don't stack, the bonus melee damage ones do, making melee insanely OP if you stack enough different melee damage food buffs
---
* Always be a part of a public team (even if it's just you on your own) and favour having and sharing team-based perks like Inspirational
---
* If you don't take any items from a container/world loot and you server hop, you can reroll the loot and maybe get something you actually want. Also works for trying to score plans you haven't got yet or other items like technical data for the Forbidden Knowledge quest
---
I make a point to hide sheepsquatch plushies in creative places. It is my mission in life.
---
Same for me.
---
If you have a friend, why not just give them the stuff to hold until you switch characters?  You don't even need a private server for that lol  If only I had a friend *sigh*
---
You need to be level 66 by the end of today, so your are good to go.
---
Yeah poor wording on my end, I didn’t mean specific platforms but specific individual consoles/PCs, I’ve been using my Gatling laser a lot which results in a lot of ash piles in line in the sand but no lag on my end so far.
---
Thank you for your constructive criticism. 🙃
---
I usually put whole milk into my Corn Flakes.
---
I had insane lag last night from line in the sand.  Could barely loot and took 3 seconds fr pressing a key to my character moving.
---
I have an i7 hex core processor and gtx 1060 6gb. 16gb memory.  Clearly an issue with the game.  
---
It's like they have done this on purpose to stop players farming steel.  But I know the reality is that it's a bug introduced in the new patch.
---
2 torsos with unyielding (crappy ones) I don't need for the char I crafted them with.
---
Insulation would be my guess.
---
Give it a twirl and say “Expecto patronum”
---
This one is my favorite lol
---
I dislike cheaters in online games as well.  I just laugh at the people who have these at their camp because they are an eye-sore and it's funny to me that they are so bad at the game that they can't sustain their ammo usage so they need to use glitches.
---
You realize people can build them in other players' camps as a griefing tactic, right? They take up a ton of budget, can't be scrapped, and if you move your camp you can't place them out of storage and they'll continue to take up budget.
---
Don't accept private team invites from strangers. Public teams are okay.
---
Fortifying Atlas.
---

---
I got an ultra cite gatling laser plan. Pretty cool I thought.
---
I've always built my camps as if i'm a vault dweller who has decided to settle permanently in a specific location, I have all the workbenchs available for other players to use, my water and collectron are unlocked so if people need the resources they can grab them on their way past.  The place looks like a home you'd want to retire in.  
---
Thomasrg1989 just pointed out that in 76 you don't build a settlement you build a camp, which is something i've never considered, i've played from the BETA and rebuilding Appalchia set in my head the idea that vault dwellers should be looking to settle an area and build a community, you know change your mindset and problems just become challenges.  
---
So this post has been useful in that I can think about building in a different way, with a bit more understanding.
---
Simple go to YouTube and watch Angry turtles video on magic weapons. I have a few of them and test them out. Pretty neat.
---
Not to steal your thunder or anything, but..  
---
The other night, I was blessed with a 1* Stalker's Board from the 3* Legendary Sentry Bot Annihilator in the vault 79 raid.  
---
I have it mounted on the wall of my camp.
---
I mean, upvote for the reference, sure.
---
Who hurt you?
---
Honestly I have been using a lot an instigator Tesla rifle since months and it works great both with and without VATS.
---
Excellent ammo economy too, as often you can kill 2 or more enemies with one cell and many people sells them for 1 cap each.
---
If I have the extra Nuclear Keycards I try to nuke them as well.
---
They're actually working to make it a feature rather than a bug.
---
I will do that if it is a valuable weapon or armor piece or something.  Most of what I transfer though is excess aid/gunpowder/plans so I don't really want to bother my friend when I can have them just be in their private world doing their own thing while I move stuff via train station suitcase.  I hate inconveniencing people even if they are okay with it haha.  
---
If you are on xbox I'd be happy to let you use my private server to transfer safely.
---
The fact that some players waited until the price dropped and therefore didn’t pay $60 further supports my point. Value vs Cost is a consideration for many consumers.  Same product at a different price will have different consumer bases. That is very simple economics. 
---
I gave a hypothetical example based upon standard consumer economic principles, to try to explain to you *why* there could be a market. 
---
I gave you my reasoning why it’s not a good value for *some* consumers. Some players don’t care about the Atom Shop. We’ve seen posts here about that very topic. I’ve encountered people that said they have very little interest in Atoms. 
---
And the suggestion of a lower cost version of FO1st, without Atoms, has been made on this forum before, with generally favorable support. Usually the only naysayers are the ‘Boycott Bethesda Band’. 
---
There are entire industries built around the *à la carte* concept.  Look at new car sales and the number of ‘options’ that are available. Look at the last minute ‘add-ons’ that are added at a lot of stores. Look at buffets, for crying out loud. Consumers like extra choices. Even when there isn’t a lot of difference in the choices, it gives then the illusion of control. 
---
I never said it was a better value to ALL consumers. I said it would be a better value to some consumers. Specifically the ones that haven’t given Bethesda any extra money beyond the initial game purchase. 
---
You’re not arguing against me. You’re arguing against basic and simple consumer economic principles that have been proven true time and time again.
---
Never got that to work.
---
I'm ok with the PvP but lvl 300 robbing a lvl 45? A bit chintzy. Plus...why bother with the story? Just kill them and take their stuff if that's what you wanted.
---
Damn, i'd be your ammo slave for life if I could get 10k out of it
---
I get your post.  But ideally the solution would be to have the same amount of challenges for both game modes. 
---
I mean a lot, if not most of the rewards in the legendary run are just for adventure mode.  It's conveluted.  A mess.  But you don't have to complete them.  There is enough score points from dailies and weeklies already to finish it.
---
"How are you today? Doing well I hope?"
---
Oh this is gonna make me giggle......
---
This would have been great.  But i can see a lot of problems with the implementations.   
---
1. They would have to create content for both factions, bake new bases, quest line, rewards etc. and then do it
---
2. or let us choose and then we wait for some months until they have created that content 
---
3. Or it could be cool, and they'd make content for both. Letting us choose who come first do all of that and then let the other one come and have us decide between them. 
---
interesting idea though
---
Collecting all the tapes/notes for a given quest should give you some kind of display case which can play all the tapes and move the notes collected from your inventory to personal terminal.
---
Same!!!!!  I want to trade with you, random person on a LFG, but I don't have a legacy weapon to offer you in return!!! Might I interest you in this 2\* nocturnal rolling pin??!?!  FACK
---
I can’t access this place either 😵
---
How about no?
---
I hate being forced to level up for SCORE at high levels, because it forces you to play longer than you may want to.  See, works both ways?
---
*Found the light background user!*
---
😉
---
I didnt donate a single thing.. dont even know how or where to do it? Havent started any BoS related quest yet.
---
That’s the cheater way, but yes it can be done this way.
---
But what the hell do you want to hoard? 100 in each scrap is enough to keep your inventory repaired. You do not need 98 million scrap of wood.
---
I try to make people smile. Did it work?
---
What I'd rather see happen is for fast travel cost to be calculated based on the locations proximity to the nearest free fast travel location as well as the player distance (This might be more awkward now that we are more often in teams with so many extra camps available, it could just be restricted to only include the players camp/tent). It shouldn't cost me a small stack of caps to fast travel to a location when my camp (or vault 76) is a short distance away, especially since this system just encourages players to fast travel to free locations THEN the intended location to save on cost which means more time spent in loading screens.
---
Please link this mod!
---
Are you blueprinting it from the little wire that sticks out the middle of the machine?
---
I know, I don't accept invites from people I don't know anyway.
---
Yeah the ammo efficiency is off the charts, seeing it arc between 2 or 3 enemies is so satisfying.
---
That's why I don't like when the bolts just stop working and I'm forced to use a different weapon
---
For me it’s just the stat increase, so the weight increase, agi and perception for vats. Then the intelligence.. my god you lvl up fast just farming corn for soup / turbo fert and repeat. I just sit there spamming corn soup when I’m bored 🤷‍♂️. 
---
Damage side the game is just dumb. My mate has a random pump action he uses an instakills most things. I use low dps weapons to make it playable and slightly challenging. 
---
Oh and using diluted stims/radaway means you never run out of stims. I literally give super stims away to troll people and watch them sit in their pit boy for 10mins like wtf am I over encumbered😂
---
Plan: Chemistry Bench 🤤
---
Almost no one is going to be cool with a redo. Bethesda had the opportunity for a character reset when they shifted from beta to launch and they didn't. If they weren't at that most golden of opportunities, they'll never now.
---
Also it doesn't fix the fact that future dupes will still exist. They need a robust means of dealing with duping, which leads to your duping ID point.
---
You're right in that that's the way it should be done but Bethesda is never going to put the effort into doing this. It's not a big enough of a problem for them to put that effort in. It's as plain as day given how they treat the game overall. The absolutely barest of minimums and your suggestion is not the bare minimum. It should be but this is Bethesda we're talking about.
---
There might be incremental improvements or incremental degradation of the game but without significant change to resourcing and executive management, or a sale to a studio that's both competent and will do right by the game, sadly this is how it will forever be.
---
Would love to be wrong but Bethesda time and again and proven me right.
---
Used panties... well, the japanese version of FO76 anyways.
---
Might I suggest using carrots to eliminate those pesky brambles and small trees.
---
Honestly, the backlash should have been worse because Bethesda deserves it.
---
I didn't pay for any ranks, during the double xp weekend I got to rank 90 and finished up the rest a few days later.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo\_8XKVqGQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKo_8XKVqGQ)
---
It could be due to the fact that I had a bloody commando build and bloody shotgun build prior to the heavy gunner.. still have them. So to say the least I’m really used to running bloody. When I wanted to try something different I went for a full health PA/HG. I took all the big guns I have off my mule, including vampires, anti armor and mutants variants of mini guns, gatplaz, 50 cals and the like (my mule is legit stuck in a train station for all eternity). Anyway, I followed a build that TYR did, modified it ever so slightly, nothing that would effect damage output. Once I felt the build was complete I took it for a few test runs at westek, Watoga and the queen. It performed well at the queen, but at westek and watoga I found I using about 50 to 60 rounds out of my anti armor explosive 50 cal to put down one mutant or one assaultron. I was discouraged by the amount of ammo wasted, switched it to bloody (as my mule already has a list of bloody weapons and unyielding armor at the ready) and the difference was immediately noticeable. 1 or 2 rounds for assaultrons, 2 or 3 for mutants, out of the same aae 50 cal. Not mention more carry weight. Just using that 50 cal as an example my dps went from around 90 something to 160. 
---
I’m sure I did something wrong, maybe, maybe not. I’m not knocking the build type because a lot of people run it. Personally, it just didn’t fit how I play. And perhaps I didn’t give it enough practice. But already knowing the power of a bloody build and already having the weapons and armor it was too easy to abandon the power armor. Partly I wanted to use a power build because I was conned into getting power armor skins from the atom shop... which I never used...
---
The problem there is, that it really is not a good cap sink past the very early days of playing
---
The invisible arcs, absolutely. 
---
Mine works pretty well but then outta nowhere I just can't damage anything for like 15 seconds, then it'll start working again.
---
Used to be 400
---
Just let them come. One day there will be no more BoS soldiers.
---
Also sorry for that being a long winded story.
---
Nah......I am looking for 25k presents, 50k ac!d, or multiple legacy weapons......well, I have 12k steel I worked my ass off obtaining.....lol
---
No offense, but this is silly. People can nitpick almost any challenge they don't like for similarly spurious reasons.
---
1. Please remove the Kill X Legendary challenge. I don't like wasting my time farming/grinding locations
---
2. Please remove the "gain a level" challenge. I'm level 200+ and that takes a stupid amount of time to do. Also, I don't want to roll an alt just for a challenge.
---
3. Please remove the "buy an item" challenge. I didn't buy FO76 to play a shopping sim, and 99% of the stuff in peoples' vendors are overpriced garbage.
---
For some people, the NW challenges aren't troublesome, and represent a fairly easy way to net SCORE. **Just because you do not like NW does not mean they should remove them.**
---
They obviously only test to make sure that it's in the crafting menu and can be equipped.  Minimal verification.
---
You were making the argument that it was´t a good value vs. cost ratio. YEs more choices are good i agree. The way he put together his suggestion was weak at best. I´m not on the boycott bethesda wagon. i have fo1st and buy roughly 5000. Im just tired of the Fo1st contraversy and people crying all the time about it.
---
You will keep your characters as long as you connect everything with your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) account, BUT any atoms you collected will stay on the platform you collected them on.  
---
So drain your atoms before moving to a new platform.
---
Okay Karen
---
That's the point. There is nothing to argue or complain about. He's not wrong.
---
You can not playe weapons display neither. It seems, this is the same bug...
---
Mounted heads.
---
Not the plans, real heads... (Cue the EVIL LAUGHTER....💀💀💀)
---
you don't have to play NW to get the 100 scores if you haven't missed too many days.
---
&gt; **How to identify you got a magic weapon?** 
---
You watched an Angry Turtle video so you should already know. He was the one that coined the phrase in the context of this game.
---
Thank you! went through and found it was the little succulent plants
---
I’m ready
---
Wait, the 15% dr while blocking on armor does this too? Is it just shotguns or have I been misleading myself about the strength of my build sheerly by accident?
---
&gt; You think they'd have it figured out by now.
---
That’s cute to think
---
Dude, just read some of the top posts in the subreddit and you'll know.
---
If you back out of the machine and go back in does it still show slots being used?
---
Too true! I came 5 weeks late to season 1 and this legendary run is completely ridiculous. The worst challenges are ‘kill a player’ and ‘increase overseer rank’, these honestly take me hours to get! 
---
I understand some people love the battle royale, but the rest of us shouldnt have to play it.
---
To expand on your point, perhaps a challenge being: adventure mode OR nuclear winter.. would please a lot more people
---
Wouldn't it be funny it Bethesda never figured out how to patch this but instead, increased the size of budget they take up, say each one at 100% so you could never add anything else to your camp.  Ah, that would be funny.  AWFUL AND UNFAIR!!  But funny.
---
No.
---
oh my, This is why i always have 60+ misc things in my vendors even though it´s empty, from when i was crafting more serums and adding them to what was already there.   
---
I hadn´t noticed it also taking up the slots
---
Bobbleheads, magazines, treasure maps, cheap berry mentats and junk.  I love to buy junk/scrap to get rid of caps because i don't need room to store it.
---
My first experience with griefers was when the game first started. I never played on-line games because invariably there was a hacker or cheater who would fly through on a grappling hook , with a flaming skin who could kill everyone with one shot. No fun for anyone but the one asswipe. Fallout 76 I thought would be different because it's not designed to be a PvP, (I loved the other Fallouts) it just has it as an option (newbie thinking) 
---
I was at Tyler Fairgrounds just loving the story and play through when all of a sudden i got hit by something much stronger than a Scorch's bullet. Being naive at the time I looked around and saw two players on top of the cliffs to the east and waved. That shows you how innocent I was. I actually waved at them. I often wonder what the player was thinking when he hit me with the second killing shot. For my part, I was stunned. i couldn't believe that an actual human would kill me. Then they came down and took my miserably little pile of junk and took off.
---
I know it's a game but I truly believe that we play as we really are. You know? ***Give a man a mask and he'll show you his true nature.*** Same thing here. Raiders are cowards and bullies. In life and in the game.
---
Find a sheepsquatch. If you obliterate it in 2 seconds it's magic.
---
Why wouldn’t you use it? The bug about it not suppressing certain mutations...it’s just a visual bug
---
I would be down for each mode having their own little board full of mode-only items like perk packs, skins, and relevant mode items.
---
But the points will eventually add up if you don't PVP for the PVE prizes. That's my problem.
---
If u need the torso I can craft - no plan...
---
🐀
---
Naw, it can wait until later to pick it up if there's something that's more useful to buy. They're at a dead end with armor unless they change the diminishing returns on damage resistance, so if that ever happens it will be worth it. But the likelihood of that happening currently seems slim. I picked it up more for the sake of completeness, same for the stranger heart I'm working on.
---
If you're asking this question, you haven't watched Turtle's video properly. He spells it out.
---
Raiders,,, MOFO'ing Raiders!!!
---
Bloodied weapons ammo unyielding armor bolstering armor rare plans mutations and rare outfits. But remember someone probably won’t buy your bloodied lead pipe try and get desired weapons like a meat hook or sought after commando rifles. Again ammo is something people always want so .45 5.56 and fusion cells usually go quick in my experience.
---
Ok already did that so thank you
---
I loved the early NW stream when they spent ages gathering a breifcase and codes only to have some froglegger bounce over and grenade them all then start teabagging.
---
I´ve been looking for months for that, will trade my b2525 handmade for that
---
Its a phonetic alphabet using fallout terms. I believe all of the transmissions have been decoded over on the data mining discord...
---
I use it on all my builds that have heavy mutations, it would be silly not too
---
Yeah I was adamant I wasn’t going with the raiders but then I really liked them.  Even Paige annoys me and they’re just all so boring.
---
You have to blueprint from that wire it comes out of the machine but doesn't connect it to anything
---
Heh i think i missed that one but sounds amazing lol
---
Sorry, I'm only really looking for Stalker's melee weapons.
---
Except, as you said, you're farming not "robbing" no one but NPCs are getting hurt :)
---
I use it because of the -75% negative, I am a junkie and not everything requires u to be on chems, so a -1 is alot better than -4.
---
Umm... pacifist mode and friendly fire is a non-issue.
---
I've made this suggestion before but I think I need to keep posting it. Whether they were to raise the scrip limit or not, I propose that they revamp the scrip system to perform like treasury notes where we can grind up every legendary we get in a day, every day. But each day, we can go to a scrip conversion machine and convert the exact max limit without having to play the game to maximize the 150 each day. The servers should perform better since we would not be storing extra legendaries on our characters and in stash and overweight or max weight limit legendary mules could be emptied.
---
I usually stand with the cries of the community, but man, from your posts and comments you just sound extremely entitled. "I can't get the skin that I want, because the game wants me to play it differently than I want". Legendary Run is like a battlepass, it's supposed to add gametime and diversity to a game. You do not need that skin for Gatling, you just want it. And if you want it, then you have to earn it, it's not essential to the gameplay, it just looks nice. Nobody forces you to grind to get that skin. This game has way more serious issues than some stupid skins.
---
Ideally? Stable flux. I will happily drop 20k on you if you have it for a decent price. Though considering it’s the ballache nature of doing it, that rarely happens. 
---
Realistically? Reasonably priced trash legendary weapons and plans I don’t have. 
---
After that, legendary armours to a lesser degree. I have two active toons and have finished the legendary run. 
---
I log in a lot less frequently than I did so it’s harder and harder to get enough legendaries to get scrip every day so I’ll log on claim bullion etc and then trawl vendors for people being reasonable with their trash. Any 3 star below 600 caps I’ll snap up no questions asked. Any 2 star for 3-350 so I can scrip 3 3* and 2 2* weapons and be done. Easy. 
---
Before I reached high level and got everything I was all about serums and plans, with a side of ammo so I didn’t have to spend time crafting and sourcing myself endlessly. 
---
I will offer an unsolicited adviceand say that no ammo beyond cores and maybe perhaps gauss ammo is worth more than a cap each. You can reply and argue but I will die on that hill so no point 😁
---
Now I sell ammo myself though that business has definitely tailed off of late even at a cap. The odd whale will come along and snag like 5k 5.56 or .50 cal but before I was having to top up multiple times a day. 
---
I get the feeling a LOT of people are trawling now for rarer plans they don’t have for a decent price, and legendaries.
---
Yep, I had to store one and replace it yesterday... Best thing to do is if you’re going to add some thing that you’re already selling that is stackable, pull the listed items and list them all at the same time. Easiest for me at least
---
Fixed and confirmed watching dmg numbers increase killing scorched.
---
Interesting.  I’ll have to see if my machines have gotten goofed up like that.
---
It was glorious. Perfect to watch as one of the many that was trying to get the point across that perk is cancer.
---
Well I don't like the level up one either, since it unfairly affects people who play with a single, high level character. So I feel you. I would also argue that the repeatable unfairly affects newer players since they may not be at a level where getting 10k exp is easy for them, thus the only way to avoid having to PVP, for them, is more of a slog than anything else for them.
---
The system is borked all around.
---
The whole inventory interface needs a rework.
---
I understand why it's like it is (played all the previous fallouts), but it's not really conducive to quicker paced online play.
---
Maybe I should look at the Nexus... (I'm on PC)
---
Do you have a link to the discord by chance?
---
While F76’s player base is small for this kind of game, I think the reddit community generally represents the more outraged half of players. Bethesda still has roughly 25-40k players online at any given time and ppl forget that ESO was running at 1/18 the amount of players close to this same point. Now they have 22k alone on steam, which could total up to somewhere around 60k+ users at any given time.
---
People felt the same about blades even though it’s been making them a steady amount of cash for awhile now. It’s just a Bethesda thing to not commit to long-term projects until they see how much money they’ll actually have to spend to make it good.
---
I don’t think it’s guaranteed, but all these reddit “I’ve defended Bethesda since the beginning but I’m down now posts” mean nothing for the overall community. THAT’S NOT TO DEFEND BETHESDA, but they will most likely come back from this. They’ve had people against them since they bought Fallout’s IP, but most just really don’t care. A lot of the regular community just likes the aesthetic of fallout. They’re not worried about how many minor bugs affect gameplay or company decisions work against their own interests. They’re going to keep playing cause there’s not many games that play like f76 does and has the same subtle world-building that makes it a unique IP.
---
As for your ideas, some are good some I would be very much against. Definitely don’t think Bethesda should just stop here, as ppl also told them to just quit before wastelanders and that saw their player count rise above eso’s for a couple months. 
---
I think they need to let the duped items phase out of the market, but I agree having a specific ID would be interesting, assuming the game wouldn’t just assign a new ID to duped items.
---
100% agree making caps matter. I’ve been wanting a more organized market for a long time so the reddit traders didn’t have so much power over trade values. 
---
Overall, thanks for sharing these thoughts! Certainly BGS has a lot of thinking to do.
---
Get attached, but not *too* attached.
---
i just hit em in the pocketbook and refuse to buy from their camp vendors. i figure they're probably dupers as well as cheaters so i don't want what they got anyway.
---
Yes but I doubt it will really be a high priority. Unlike the assaultron heads who needs cork? This new event is the first time I've even thought about cork.
---
I have a pistol/shotgun build. If you think pistols suck run around with a shotgun and ads. It’s absolute garbage and you basically have to vats everything to kill it. I may abandon shotguns and just do straight postols.
---
I'm so glad it isn't just me.  I recently moved in with my GF, and was worried her internet was the cause.
---
Yes, I am fairly confident it is permanent including exit/reenter of the vendor. I noticed it first because I went to add more items to one of my vendors and couldn't, but the list seemed too short. I counted the items by hand and found it was only 22.
---
This was before I had adjusted its inventory at all on that return to camp. I did not think to record exiting and reentering the vendor when it had triggered, so I will later go back to recreate it again and capture that behavior for proof.
---
That will need to be later in the day, though - need sleep and to go to work before I have time to create this additional clip.
---
You meen at at your camp and if so just hope no asshole decides to kill it
---
I run egg-head on a melee build so i kind of have to run it.
---
I mean it is welded together junk...
---
On a serious note, in FO4, some if not all paint jobs gave the player a bonus.  My guess is this cosmetic paint job has a bad entry for that field.
---
The Nuka lamps work on my Xbox One X but not my first gen Xbox One. It may have to do with graphics etc and not be a bug.
---
I use it and strange in numbers. All my boosts are insanely op in a team.
---
I love this so much. Something about the fact that they can't get a character to sit still just blows my mind. Either the engine is woefully incapable or the developers are, and both explanations are terrible. Also, every time I swing by Murmrgh I wonder why they don't just put Ward in a cage. Also, I think I'd probably die laughing if I found Murmrgh wandering around outside the Rusty Pick.
---
I guess we did have that issue for awhile where she stepped back too far and we all had to use 3rd person view to talk to her :D
---
I have a nocturnal Pipe ,,,, any chance you can help a brother out, i´ll even throw in a couple of propaganda flyers.
---
"Evaporato scorched beast queenum"
---
I've seen most of these CMs play. With the exception of LoneVaultWanderer, they seem very novice. The majority are food builds. Poorly optimised even by food build standards.
---
Ok thank you for the advice 😁
---
That was the joke
---
Yeah I feel you man. I definitely have a competitive side. I take workshops if i actually need the stuff. But I'm also willing to share the workshop and ive only ever fought people above my own level. But on the flip side ive helped randoms defend their shops too and gaveway stuff for new players. I guess I'm more chaotic neutral. Your right about people playing who they are. I believe that too
---
I gotta ask what you mean by ports lol. I was thinking internet hookups but we have been running on wifi since we moved 6 months ago so it shouldn't be that.  I'm a little lost
---
Noticed it when I was trying to add a couple of bobbleheads... as OP said, stacked but it still took up an extra inventory slot. I’d swear I had noticed this happening a while back but all I had to do before was pull the items and relist, not store the actual vending machine
---
Theyve fucked up walls anyway i cant double wall now so it sucks. Probably gonna have presets instead of building for my camps
---
Buy your shotgun from a beardy dude in a robe and pointy hat.
---
AKA the Hornwright bunker keycards we can’t drop for some god awful reason
---
On the Nexus? I'll look it up.
---
They can't, already tried at another dudes camp they patched it problably
---
Nah sorry i really need that VATS accuracy boost for my melee, even if it means sacrificing the bonus damage from Nocturnal. Maybe if you throw in some Ultracite Torso and Arm plans?
---
The Ounce of Prevention? They are working on that one as well, I don't have any additional updates to share unfortunately.
---
cry harder
---
It’s a good thought! Sadly, I don’t think reddit is the place for contacting Bethesda anymore. We’ve pretty well scared off their reps
---
Can you doubleteam anymore?,i tried to save a friend who was attacked at his camp by a higher level player and i couldnt deal damage to the attacker,only thing i could do was repairing the turrets until he got tired and left.
---
Which they have poisoned to wipe out the local population.
---
Stan "I cant believe its all over, what do we do now" - Cartman "What do you mean? Now we can finally play the game" - Kyle "Oh yeah" - Cartman "Okay Kenny add Eyes Of The Beast to your hotbar. Stan check your fury talents to boost your shots." - Stan "Got it"
---
Casual players shouldnt have to concern themselves with high xp grinding events. The legendary run was advertised as a feature that would complement gameplay, not something players would have to grind 24/7 daily for
---
Which items get a unique ID? Can the item ID be reused if the item is scriped?
---
That's ok lol yeah if they go to the actual work shop bench and press to claim it makes the pvp zone initiate
---
But WHY does it have to be black leather with that god awful sheen to it.
---
I’ll have to check my machines and see if I have phantom slots.  I take stuff out and then add it all back in though if I’m adding more of something I already have in my machine.  There was a time when if you put more of a stackable item into your machine it would display like its been added to the existing listing but other players would see it as two lines or it would cause them to not be able to buy all of it.
---
Who the hell is MoonlitCharlie and why is CaptainNoob getting third billing? Isn't he the most well known of the 3?
---
Not awful nor unfair....extremely justified
---
oooo thats good to know! I thought I needed 3 or 4 sets of codes.  Yeeee cant wait to launch my first nuke. Thanks for the info!!
---
I have the Xbox one S and I think I only remember seeing my Nuka Lamps work once
---
My board is super laggy too.  Who knew multilingual support would kills fps?!?
---
I'm down to buying:
---
-buying plans I need and aren't priced above their worth (unless I need a cap sink).
---
-occasional meds
---
-Stimpaks 
---
-Fusion Cores that are at a full charge for at or under what Merchants sell them for, not 1/100 for 500 caps.
---
-occasional weapons and armor that amuse me
---
What sells for me:
---
-Disease Cures sell almost as quickly as I make and stock them
---
-X-cell
---
-Antibiotics
---
-Formula P
---
-Cheaply priced plans (5-20 caps on most)
---
-Buffout/Bufftats (to a lesser extent, but I acquire so many I put them for sale cheaply to reduce stash load)
---
-Bobbles and Magazines (some sell better than others, but occasionally, someone comes along and buys out the entire machine in one go)
---
-Some plans, but I sell almost all of mine between 5-30 caps. Priced to move not to have huge profit.
---
It's all been decoded.
---
Well said, I wasn't thinking monetary, but that makes a lot of sense.
---
That’s not what I said at all. I said that for *some consumers* it wasn’t. Each Value vs Cost is a personal analysis. I’ve been a FO1st member since day one.  For *me*, since I like to buy Atom Shop items, it has value. But we know from this subreddit alone that not everyone does that. And not everyone wants to pay for Atoms. 
---
Therefore, creating an option that doesn’t involve Atoms but keeps everything else, and having a reduced price, isn’t a weak suggestion at all. It direct and simple.  
---
- Fallout First (Standard):  includes the Tent, Scrapbox, Private World, Emotes and Skins. All for $4.99. 
---
- Fallout First (Deluxe): All of the above, *but with 1650 Atoms, for just* ***$8 more!*** That’s our best price on Atoms ever, and an exclusive offer for Fallout First Members!
---
Hell, they could just have the ‘basic’ version and let FO1st members buy 1600 Atoms for $8 at any time they wanted and probably make *more* money. 
---
OP’s suggestion was just fine.
---
So... links?
---
Don’t let the hot meat stack is what my grandpa used to say
---
Well if there's pvp there's got to be a dick in a stealth suit involved.
---
5.56, .45, bulk steel, lead and plastic, stable flux, cheap scrip weapons.
---
Of course! Here is all the broadcasts.  
---
Message 1: First  Expeditionary Force,  this is L-H with a recorded Priority Gamma  message. Papa Romeo missed  the last four check-ins. No contact since  crossing the Rockies. Scribes  estimate unit position in the vicinity of  Lincoln. Orders are to  reestablish comms with L-H ASAP and provide a  full report of whereabouts  and activities since last communication.  Acknowledge on coded channel  Two Three. L-H out. Message repeats.
---
Message  2: First  expeditionary force, this is Lost Hills with recorded priority  alpha  message. No response to previous broadcasts from Papa Romeo  (Paladin  Rahmani) or other members of unit. Lost hills now assumes unit  is  incapable of response. Any surviving unit members are ordered to  divert  from primary mission immediately. Acknowledge on coded channel  one  eight. Lost Hills out. Message repeats.
---
Message  4: This  is Elder Roger Maxson broadcasting to Paladin Leila Rahmani,  secure  private channel. I’ve sent the Scribes away. This message is not  being  recorded in the logs. I’m speaking to you now not as your Elder or   commanding officer, but as a friend. Leila, I know you and I have had   our disagreements, but I still believe you understand the value and   purpose of the Brotherhood. You wanted this mission, though I am sure   you have suspicions about why you were chosen. I still hope you are   simply unable to answer our broadcasts. We may not see eye to eye, but   you know the Codex and are sworn to it. The alternative… I don’t wish to   entertain it. For the time being, I have suppressed that suggestion   among the officers and kept it out of our other attempts to reach you,   but if you do not report in soon, I may be overruled. Your mission out   there is important no matter what you may think. You are still one of   us. Still a Paladin of the Brotherhood, duty-bound. Broadcast on any   Brotherhood channel, encryption be damned – just do it. Maxson out.   Message repeats.
---
Message 5: First   Expeditionary Force, this is L-H. Elder Maxson recording. Paladin   Rahmani, your unit has now been out of contact with Brotherhood   headquarters for over three months. Our Scribes estimate that your unit   should be entering Appalachia and closing in on the ATLAS Observatory   shortly. It is imperative that your first order of business after   securing the facility is to reestablish communications and provide a   full report on your activities during the period of radio silence. You   now represent the Brotherhood in Appalachia. When you restore contact   with us, there will once again be one Brotherhood on both sides of this   land and your deeds will enter the Scrolls forever. Adhere to the  Codex.  Conduct yourselves with honor. Maxson out. Message repeats.
---
It was even worse than that though they didn't want the workshop they wanted to take ALL of his stored junk.
---
Are you level 300 yet?   If not and it's within reach, maybe get there by the time they release Legenary Perks so that you can have all six slots?
---
Not for nuclear winter.
---
Idc for flux rly, albeit I’d love some DCG or PW bloodieds. Much more interested in collecting rare costumes, seeing as many are worth more than the current cap limit. I’ve been wanting a responder firebreather helmet for awhile now.
---
I’ve read this a few times and still can’t really understand it. You acknowledge that the Appalachian BOS were using all T-51 suits, but then do a massive leap forward in the timeline and say ‘well, T-60 is mainly used now, and T-51 is rare, so it’s lore appropriate the paints are only T-60.’ 
---
In short, you are melting my brain.
---
Ah, a fellow food farmer~ I make it a little special though and farm SB's, Brahmin, and Gulpers for Mixed Meat Stews, Donuts, and Pepperoni Rolls. Farm that Forest river for all the Healing Salve and Sugar I can carry, too. Adds up when you're in a Building team at max with some boosted INT. 
---
It's certainly slowed down at my level, but damn if that shouldn't be in the beginner level guide for leveling...
---
I actually had to drop PER for STR, but the Heavy Weapons perk damage increase is worth it. My marine's best stats are STR, INT, and LCK (bc mutation perks and also Serendipity/One Gun Army).
---
And bro, you give then away for free? I sell Supers at 20 caps a pop and they fly off the shelves 🤣 free travel money! The problem with Diluted's, for my main build, is the inability for them to work as fast as I would potentially need them to if like, a Yao Guai/Deathclaw/Behemoth is on my tail. But otherwise they'd be great.
---
Levelling up:  I want to be 300 by the time legendary perks arrive so that I can get all six slots.   Turning in 20 t notes per day so that I can whittle down the 200+ I have.
---
I run like all the mutations so it is absolutely necessary.
---
Actually, 3x1 gives an effective 32% as they are applied sequently.
---
I haven't done a single NW daily yet and I'm in the 80s and not worried about completing before the end.
---
Bethesda more or less confirmed all their game titles would receive free upgrades. They are just only allowed to announce a couple titles officially for the time being.
---
Take a bath hippie
---
Explosive bait on them?
---
I currently use it. But I’ve been seeing posts of other people’s builds that don’t have it.  Just got to wondering at a certain point that you’re too OP for the negatives to matter. Probably would regret not having them equipped.
---
Just unequip / equip.
---
Oh hell yes.  Creative writing is a skill more people need.  So even when there is disagreement on the subject matter, the actual discussion is enjoyable.
---
Liberators...
---
You know how I know Bethesda that the vast majority of players don't like playing Nuclear Winter, there isn't a single chart showing the breakdown of XP needed per level for NW. Dataminers didn't think it was worth there time to figure it out and they generally think everything is worth their time. I don't even see how that's possible on the internet, but it's true.
---
Ah, I see. When I noticed them combining same-price stackable items I took up a habit of using that mechanic to add to existing listings to save myself time/effort on tossing up more of the same for sale. Did not know about previous bugs with that mechanism.
---
Perhaps due to this and hearing of previous bugs my sop needs to be to remove and relist items for a while.
---
They certainly are cool when they work.
---
he could contest the workshop, yes.
---
Oh look, a fair argument. I like this. Have an upvote.
---
Do you remember this dudes player name by any chance?
---
Asking for a friend
---
It’s a visual bug
---
Really?  I thought this plan was common.  I just did a plan dump to clean my stash and that was in it.
---
I’m assuming if you scrap the machine and replace it it will be fine again.
---
I am a builder and one of my fav things to do after a long hard day at work and kids are in bed. I get why the building stuff was all fixed. I know it will take time, but why not add interior walls to each set? Been playing since day one and always thought it's something that should have naturally been there. Thanks for all the hard work you guys put in to try and fix things and make it work!
---
I'm not a developer in any way so I'm not sure how it would work, but I would think armors and weapons would be the important ones. Once scripted they are gone. Be the same as basically every other MMO out there.
---
Want the torso or the plan? Can craft it...
---
One was invisible to be fair, not cheesey enough for you?
---
Nothing is there and you just wasted atoms skipping one of the things you could have done. I'm also at 89 and have enough atoms to buy the whole next two seasons ,but without challenges,I would hardly start the game now.
---
✈️  
---
🙄
---
Not even Hawkeye wants to be Hawkeye
---
Well they did ask him to put all of his junk in his inventory so... I don't know, Davey.
---
Good to know. Hopefully it runs better than the garbage state Xbox is currently in.
---
#I buy gamma rounds at any price
---
It doesn't really. You keep saying this without providing any backing, and when anyone challenges you about that you just deflect and say we are being dismissive.
---
This is what I've noticed to, skipping dialogue seems to lock it up so I have to restart the attempt.  It's been like that since Wastelanders.  Not always, but often.
---
Plan
---
At least the invisible person still had to aim
---
Isn’t that a waste in nuclear winter??? Lol, How many people are you going to kill In that short of time frame for it to be worthwhile?
---
That's very cheap, he must be full on scrip, stash, and nearly caps!
---
You get to a point in the game where caps mean nothing zi actually struggle to spend mine as theirs nothing to buy with them once you got all your god tiered items. Same as that guy I sell everything for 30 caps or less even plans ect. Its nice when level 20-30 come to your camp and clear out your plans because some people charge 500 caps a pop
---
I'd figure I take a approach that is similar to "having words sweet like honey" to attract attention.
---
If I use grenades at an event it is now a guaranteed dashboard.  That has never happened to me before from grenades.  Plenty of other random dashboarding.
---
I have, though. And I dont spend my days grinding to get the repeatable en masse to play catch-up. So I'm kinda screwed if I choose to throw away 250 points a day bc I don't like NW. It's not a wise choice at this point to do so.
---
That's the one I'm looking forward to.
---
Thanks my dude. So these are the decoded messages from the  "hubris jangels jangles grognak" etc. broadcast? And there I was hoping that the Mistresses of Mystery were coming back using Hubris Comics terms as code.
---
It's a mistake that Austin has made for like the third time so far. Remember that settlers bundle? The PA skin had the exact same problem that it removed the innate Rad resist PA gives you. Along with the communist PA skin for a time.
---
The incompetence of the devs is staggering.
---
This!
---
Is it every weapon and armor or only the legendary ones?
---
We've been asking for this for SOOO long.  Bethesda clearly doesn't give a shit about this feedback.
---
I guess I must be stupid then and you/everyone else so much smarter. Thanks for the absolutely useless unhelpful reply. What’s the point? I call people like you a douche bag
---
Cool. People have also been recording the guys in NW flying around getting instant kills with their fists, and they don't get banned either. Excuse me if I'm a bit skeptical about this leading to anything
---
I'm guessing piss and vinegar...
---
No?
---
Your character is stubbing thier toe... well not really, but you might aswell die when it happens.
---
I think this is a very interesting topic and something that is worth debating a little. I don't see this game living for long if something isn't done.  And i have had the same idea. Leave the "legacy world" as it is and give incentives for  people to move over to the new and improved world, with a secure economy. I think it would give a lot of players some replay ability. But they would have to make serious changes and make it top notch. and maybe even change the main story, add more npcs and depth into it.  or even change it all together. I don´t think it´s to late for that, if this game is supposed to survive the next 10 - 20 years it needs something drastic. And i think even though people wouldn´t like it at first, i have a feeling that the majority of players would love building it up again, with a better world, better economy, more leveled playing field.
---
Best respons yet!
---
Im in the process of moving, which means about 4 days I cant play as everything gets boxed, moved, and unboxed. I've given up hope of getting the fireplace door. It sucks
---
i was about to say i usually sell mine cheap as i like a nice quick sale but.. WTF
---
I mean yeah but I feel like I'd be breaching some privacy dealey
---
The problem with running a shop like this with quality gear ammo and aid is *Max* Caps
---
PA Pain Train build
---
I'd be pretty shocked if it didn't with content releases planned through winter and talk of more content beyond that - it wouldn't make sense not to take advantage of next gen consoles in that.
---
VATS?
---
Man I've seen people charge 1500 for a 1* pipe rifle. They're delusional
---
It's half useful. If course they fix it immediately.
---
Pretty sure one of the wastelanders trailers showed them firing a fat man at it. Good thing they turned off damage numbers because that's sure as hell staying in the double digits
---
If I had a dollar for each person who declared a game would die from X reason only for it not to be true I would have a mound of money that would make Smaug jealous.
---
I've been experiencing immense amounts of lag as well with both FPS and the servers themselves, especially last night. The FPS issue in itself isn't too bad for me personally, but when it comes to trying to loot at the end of events, it's unbearable, I can't be bothered to collect the loot because it's so bad. It also seems as if the servers have become worse since Patch 21, last night I was trying to do my daily SCORE challenges and during that time (About 45 minutes or less) I experienced 3 server disconnects and some really bad rubberbanding. There was nothing wrong with my internet or my ISP because I checked after each disconnect, if anything my internet was performing better than normal. To me this is probably one of the worst patches ever released to 76 and I really hope we get a hotfix soon because I just want to complete the game board and take a break until the Colossus event releases, only 10 more levels to go...
---
Cool move, ngl
---
Yes, I mentioned that in the post. I had tried delisting all items, then adding one at a time to see if it was just graphical bug, but it stopped me at what it claimed was 30/30.
---
I tried moving the vendor a couple inches as an attempt to make it refresh, but it remained with the phantom occupied slots.
---
My next step was to scrap the vendor entirely and replace it, which brought it back to 0/30.
---
I then replicated the effect on a different vendor machine (initially discovered it on my food/drink/chem vendor, replicated it on the ammo vendor as shown in the clip.) Was lucky enough that it happened very quickly, as seen in clip there was two listings of .50 ammo in stash inventory, one of which had just been delisted by me from the vendor and the other had been deposited in stash before opening this vendor.
---
Delisted all of my ammo and then during relisting, the two split stacks became one and added a phantom to the machine.
---
Dont store heavy weapons or heavy ammo except for a few fusion cores. Bulk your junk, store 10 units of each for crafting, sell the rest. No more than 5 of each chem, food, or drink. Keep water, diluted chems, and food on hand, no more than 20 per.
---
If that doesnt do it, im guessing you carry multiple PA sets or too many weapons.
---
If 800 isn't manageable, then the scrap box isnt likely to help anyway. All ive noticed since subscribing is I can have more weapons in my store. Inventory is just part of the game.
---
I wish we could only carry one PA chassis and had to craft with materials on hand outside of our camp. I want a more difficult survival mode. 🤷‍♂️
---
You're never the only one
---
Every freaking time I try talking to Ward, I don't have this problem with any other NPC but you can bet Ward sure gives me trouble on the regular!
---
I get your sentiment. I don't disagree with it. Just saying that it'll never happen. It might have with a different company but not Bethesda. They made that very clear.
---
If duping didn't short circuit the game loop reducing the number of opportunities to tempt players into spending money on Atoms because players won't play as long because they don't need to, or if it didn't cause some legal issue, Bethesda wouldn't even do what they have done regarding duping at all. 
---
Why do you think the VATS and fast travel bugs haven't been addressed after several months? It doesn't impact their revenue so they don't care. It would have been the same with the double-wall "fix" issue except people cancelled their 1st subs over the issue, hence the rapid response.
---
It's just ridiculous. Theirs no need. No one in the right mind would buy that. Surely they must see that it just sits in their vendor because no one ain't gonna pay it haha
---
A few months ago a team of 2 level 200, one 300 and one 100 did something similar to me, I was farming acid in the workshop northwest, the place with a lot of toxic water. Well I was just doing some quests and coming back for the acid and they appeared. The level 100 (I'm 55) shot at me and his friends looked like they were to ignore him, but then the lvl 300 tried to look inside one of my acid farmers that where locked, used the "no" gesture and went over to take the workshop, I was like: well, what I'm supposed to do? So I simply died and respawned in my CAMP, a few kilometers to the East. I went immediately to the workshop to see they would leave it after taking the resources and they scrapped all of the farmers and all of the workbenchs and things I build there, then they waved to me and disconnected from the server.
---
If you need to pay for convenience and see this game as washing dishes then you need a new hobby.
---
My guess is BGS is having to prove this game is worth investing into still. While fans are making this game out to be a full-fledged Fallout game, I don’t think Bethesda Softworks thinks a lot of it. Some ppl think their dev team is as low as 10ppl, which is small for a 2-300 dev studio. 
---
Personally, I like the game enough where I’m still extremely frustrated with Zenimax or Bethesda softworks(whoever is making the financial decisions as they don’t really understand how to make the community happy AND earn money off us), but a lot of the bugs don’t really bother me. I’m pretty sure the devs really are doing the best they can with a broken engine and limited staff, especially if it’s still their new Austin branch running the show for a game genre they are unfamiliar with.
---
Both Fallout 3 and New Vegas had keyrings.
---
How about both modes get their own board?
---
I know NW gets no love, so give them a big board full of perk packs and exclusive skins to wear in NW for meeting NW challenges. For people who say having to do the challenge got them into NW and they love it now, imagine how many people would join your mode if a special item was tied to it! 
---
I know it's a sleazy boardroom tactic to dangle such a carrot, but I find shoehorning a need to play NW so you can get a reward in the main mode to be near Destiny-level bullshit.
---
Lol I'm loaded on legendary weapons for the next few days. Was at the Rusty Pick, decided to go a near camp because "I'm a junkie for those drops", got extremely lucky with this dudes camp.
---
Had 600 caps, was expecting to get 1 or 2 weapons. Nah, I must've got like 20+ of really really good stuff
---
But that's besides the point!
---
As long as NW is in Beta, Bethesda shouldn't tie SCORE to it.
---
Huh, I never really considered selling flux but I do find myself with too much pretty often. How much would you say is reasonable to sell one at?
---
yes
---
Time will tell, I know offline games will run amazingly well. We’ll see how well the new gen works with games that’s till require solid internet connections.
---
You're not to quick on the uptake are you?
---
It's a very simple question to answer - does it directly impact their short term revenue or not?
---
If the answer is yes, they'll address it if they haven't already. If it doesn't, they won't.
---
Guess which category NW hackers falls into?
---
You Xbox? I got a helmet sitting in an alts chest gathering dust. Always up for a good trade.
---
Very true I have to disable my vendor once in a while which sucks.
---
Ya I can tell you're good in first person. I haven't encountered you in nw yet, I'll keep an eye out for you.
---
I am not a dev, my statement stems from things bethesda have said and done in the past when it was at 400 and FO1st was released.
---
There is no problem with infinite storage for a limited amount of items, the scrap box proves that.
---
And Bethesda reasoned for the low stash cap during the early days with the performance being impacted by too many individual items, which can still be achieved with weightless ones.
---
Mhm. Been there for for over a year now and they can find somewhere else smh.
---
100% agree
---
So you don't want to dupe it but you also don't want to sell it? What the fuck lol
---
how about not.
---
All the bugged legendary rewards were too fresh to be patches in this short time frame.they acknowledged nost of them though,so we should expect a fix in september,which already scares me at the thought of what this will break.
---
Recently I changed all my plan prices because they weren't selling. Made them all between 5-15 caps and suddenly I've made hundreds in a couple days haha
---
Something tells me that it's the ash piles that are causing the majority of the lag. I have had two different experiences with the Line in the Sand event, at the end of one event the was only meat piles and I wasn't experiencing any lag, however and the end of the next one, there was a significant amount of ash piles and my frames were horrible (\~15 FPS when I average almost 200+).
---
That was always a fun time when I returned to the game with my friends. We all made new characters and anytime I would take the ammo plant someone over 150 would tp over to PvP with low levels.
---
Maybe they release it today? Would be cool! But why did they say "in the next couple of weeks" then?
---
I have come to the conclusion the best way to enjoy this game is to get a couple of friends that play the game, and only play with each other (one person needs a private server, but not everyone), and ignore what happens in the rest of the game.  So many of the other issues in this game go away when you simply don’t play with random strangers. 
---
Sure, I’ll hop on the public servers once in a while to do things like SBQ or events like Fasnatch or Meat week, but after that I go back to the private servers with my friends.  
---
RMT isn’t a big deal, assuming they can get rid of the duping.  Black Market sites have existed for every online game with trading, since back in the days of things like Ultima Online and Everquest (and likely before that).  
---
Right now the three improvements this game needs the most are:
---
* Prevent Duping, preferably in such a way that you don’t have to make all items no-drop (but it’s fine to have some high end gear continue to be no-drop, like in games such as WoW).  Restarting wouldn’t fix this, this is all about their coding.
---
* Repeatable, Rewarding, and Permanent cap &amp; material sink.  Operation Atlas is \*almost\* right.  Give us things that encourage us to go out and collect items and caps in the world and turn them in for rewards.  Preferably the majority of rewards would be powerful, temporary consumables that encourage doing the event over and over.  This not only helps get items and caps out of the economy, but actively encourages people to trade for those items.  E.g. Add a new NPC to crater that is trying to deal with the chem addiction of so many raiders.  You can turn in chems (to help reduce the withdrawal effects) as well as addiction.  There would be no limit to the number of times in one day you could turn it in.  Reward the player 3 scrip for every turn in, and every 10 turn ins the player gets a random reward, including some very rare plans to craft legendary raider armor (the plans should be no drop, but the armor crafted is tradable)
---
* Challenging Instances with named bosses that drop a limited pool of items.  The \*burrows\* is almost there, And the vault raid was almost there.  Preferably the dungeon would: require the use of a team, allow for multiple play styles and reward players for using perks like lockpicking/hacking/robotics expert/etc, and should also be repeatable as many times in a day, but every run should take at least 20-30 minutes.  The final boss should be more of an event (similar to Encryptid or many of the events from the Vault 79 quest.  The boss themselves would be legendary and drop items that are aligned with that boss, as well as unique items that only they can drop.  For example, a Super Mutant Boss would have in their pool a legendary minigun, maybe give it a unique skin, give it a unique name, and preferably some of the affixes would be unique (and it has to be at least on par with good weapons out there to make it rewarding.
---
Giving players a place to dump all the stuff they pick up when adventuring that’s not their stash and not being sold for caps would help balance out the economy.  Giving players focused adventures where they could hunt down items particular to a build they want to have would give us focus and reason to keep logging in.   The above are things that have worked in other online games that are missing from FO76.  FO76 is too generic in it’s rewards in that anything can drop anything. We need focus and we need reasons to do the interiors.  
---
Of course, fixing the duping is a number one priority otherwise we can’t make any of it tradable which is the main issue with the economy.
---
Your account is is stored on Beth servers. Not your ps4. You'll be fine.
---
Yah, What I can offer may be a different story. Anything in particular you looking for? Not a FO1st member, so my junk supplies aren’t gonna be in the 1k’s but I’ll offer what I can
---
It's surprising isn't it how much you actually make selling cheap compared to the standard 300-500 caps a plan. Make a hell of alot more
---
Hurting no one is a pretty bad excuse to complain, by that standard they should let the dupers keep cloning all their explosive gatling plasmas and create a system to distribute them to every player in the game. Although to be fair they're halfway to doing that already anyway. The devs specifically created game mechanics and balanced (or tried to) them based on those intended mechanics. When people are able to nuke your camp or start a SBQ fight in 3 minutes by using exploits, that throws off their intended balance and it's perfectly understandable why they would want to change that
---
I don't play what I don't want to play.
---
Some shiny rewards ain't gonna entice me.
---
Stop caring about about it. Im here to have fun with friends and build wacky bases.
---
Here, let me spoon feed you the answer:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs&amp;t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs&amp;t=1s)
---
Watch the full video. He spells it out with some detail. Should be very obvious what the answer is by watching the whole video.
---
Yeah, come and see my camp on pc one day and youll get it IGN Rattetief
---
200 each for yellowcake and cobalt, 250 for the more desirable ones like violet and crimson. Fly out the door faster than you could keep pace. 
---
Only real problem is that people who want or need it or farm it, it’s generally worth more than the price people are willing to pay, and that caps are generally “useless”. 
---
You could probably trade it for some epic stuff on trade sites rather than sell, so I suspect that’s what people do. I’d trade all day for flux but I’ll take it all when I see it for sale.
---
Uff my mistake. Its 15% less limb dmg. The 15% Dr while blocking is a Melee weapon prefix. Thanks for the correction!
---
What mutations do you use for your junkies?
---
I’m only using a few like carnivore speed demon grounded and healing factor. Any you’d recommend? I use a fixer
---
Don't try to glitch thru the middle of the door, but at the side, if that makes sense. I usually crouch at the side, do the photomode trick and keep moving forward and jump a few times. It takes a few tries to get right.
---
5 out of 4 people would agree.
---
I know it does, trust me I know. This game has given me more shit in six months than some games give me in years. I had to buy a new fucking disk like three months in to playing it because my gifted disk just. stopped. working. Still does not work to this day. Never figured out why.
---
I'm also trying to farm for the atoms they're holding hostage that I could get freely a month ago doing the same shit I'm doing now. Now I gotta get drop feed them like, every ten levels or some shit. That's a damn good reason to keep pushing like mad, yeah?
---
Theres plenty of xp in the bog.
---
Can't prove anything though if your at a workshop. Someone's already placed them down. I take the workshop, that mean I'm a cheater?
---
Besides with Bethesda track record. It ain't gonna happen.
---
That's a really good point.
---
It's too late. Their glitches already leaked into the real world. 2020 is a gift Bethesda.
---
BE LMG is in top tier bloodied big guns. 308 is a pain, and prime ammo is the way to go if you want to efferent when crafting, but if you dont want to run bloodied, you can trade that thing for pretty much whatever you want.
---
Don't log out. Don't fast travel. Don't let anything get close, even if it's a level 5 molerat. Don't have any turrets. Just stand there and do nothing forever - because theres about a 50% chance that if you do *anything* or go *anywhere* it will randomly die or disappear. If you stick to those rules, the chance of it dying at any moment will probably drop to about 40%..
---
Seriously... assume it is going to randomly die or disappear, and don't be too disappointed when it inevitably does.
---
Not to mention there are people that enjoy NW. Why should they be forced to do a more difficult PvE challenge when what they want to do is play PvP?
---
I think your complaint holds water if you absolutely HAVE to do the NW challenges to complete the board, but you don't. Just treat grinding 30k xp as that "Really difficult PvE challenge" you mentioned you'd like elsewhere.
---
Sadly, I am but a lowly console player.
---
Yes - if you need it for a quest, the game won’t let you drop it. So if you can drop a note or holotape, it means you don’t need it. Whenever I purge my notes and holotapes, I notice an improvement in gameplay, loading times, etc.
---
Congrats.
---
It feels really weird when a level 200 comes in and swipes up all of my common camp plans that I list at 5 caps each.
---
You do you bud, who am I to stand in the way of a level 200+ and his desire for 6 copies of the bathtub plan. Go ahead an list them at your camp for 300c each and wonder why you can't sell your 50 copies of it, lol. These guys also take all 15 copies of mr handy buzz blade as though they have value.
---
The only reason they're not free is to try to counter the "it's free so I'm gonna take it" so that they tend to stay available to lower levels longer. My camps by Flatwoods with 1c food/drinks and 5-25c plans (other than a few that are just rarely seen plans). It's all low prices meant to hand out to the people who benefit from them rather than trying to rake a big caps profit.
---
Finally starting to wake up? Lol. All I ever see are posts bitching about one thing or another that Beth fucked up or ruined by design.
---
It’s not magic. It’s broken.
---
i now decided to try a build with only powerarmor unarmed, paintrain and explosives 
---
thanks for the suggestion 😁👍🏼
---
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
---
I'm ultra critical towards Bethesda and even this makes me eye roll.
---
There were many doomsayers like you in the past and I'm sure that there will be more in future. Given the current fanbase for the game, it's not going anywhere any time soon, no matter how much you may want this game to fail.
---
I might have to jump on this. Thank you! What are you personal pistols of choice?
---
Hitboxes on structures and enemies not taking any damage from the first shot i fire
---
Fucking killed me 😂😂😂😂
---
I have watched it a few times was just asking a few questions to clarify; I said I’ve seen it in the title.
---
If you look at the other comments people have just simply helped me, youre an absolute dickhead. Have you even seen it yourself??
---
You can get them with large handmade gifts
---
Unless it's one of the camp companions. I finally got one. Came back to my camp to see crazy space chick shooting it up. Couldn't do anything to stop it.
---
Any Bethesda title that carries over will get a free upgrade. They announced this yesterday.
---
Then why did they bother attaching multiple challenges to it if even they don't like it? Surely if it's so unpopular, the minority that do like it would not be enough to ruin their day if they all complained that they deserve more.
---
Presents or atlas provisions.
---
Great, I try to come up with a fun way to stir up some player interaction with the ATLAS event and I get pissed all over.  Thanks a lot.
---
Maybe if that 1* was the word "Bloodied" you might consider it but honestly thats a 400-800 cap item right there, Bloodied and all.
---
I don't think it's that bad out near Atlas, IIRC. I tried to make it a point early on to just run all over the map to unlock travel points and most areas aren't instant death if you don't engage in fights. Even then, this game is weird about throwing in mid to low level enemies in areas you'd think were populated by high level ones. I just haven't braved the far east/south east part of the map yet.
---
Also, take advantage of fast traveling to other player's camps that can get you new travel points unlocked.
---
Only a couple of months in myself, but this has worked for me so far.
---
They said the same about ESO and now Zenimax is rolling in sweet MMO cash. Bethesda seems to enjoy seeing how cheap they can be before dropping loads into bringing their games up to snuff
---
I don’t care about junk, or caps that stuff grows on trees. What I do want is a rad barrel plan or a bloodied fixer.
---
Or a decent bloodied combat knife. That’s like my number one want after getting that radstag knife skin from the mole man.
---
No but it takes me 10-15 sec for textbox to appear.
---
Sometimes longer.
---
This has me dead.
---
I 100% agree with all your ideas specially with Challenge mode instances, but to your point of ways to enjoy the  game, everyone is different. I enjoyed farming legendaries, making spreadsheets and trading on Discord while at work, getting home and making lasting relationships with other traders. It was fun, made the game feel alive. But now, it's just not, where someone could trade away their one god roll item, for another, or spend 15 dollars, and keep both. I guess I'm being silly, but it's how I had enjoyed the game, roll playing as a BoS soldier / trader.
---
It called having fun.
---
So there is this thing called emergence, where novelty arises from a sea of like or homogeneous parts. Bethesda rpg titles have always seemed to have this kind of emergence arise from assembling a large collection of game mechanics. The reason I got into fallout was because I like what happens when all of those game features are happening in one ecosystem. If you wanna talk about "screwing over a fanbase," my bid goes to whomever decided that WoW or Destiny needed another clone with fallout IP plastered on. Talk about cooking the golden goose eh?
---
Did you try explosive bait on their pet?
---
What about the player?
---
Think diablo 3 Rifts but fallout. And none of that fetch quest vault raid stuff. 
---
Like the vault raids where good but the time limits sucked a bunch and wasnt really worth going into if you just wanted fun and exp.
---
I have, but I’m junkies so it’s useless for me! RNG is a fickle bitch, but keep at it and you should get it.
---
i havent died from it but ill randomly take a small amount of damage while walking around
---
Data is stored in your PS4 so you’re progressing should be there always unless you delete it
---
No marsupial??? BLASPHEMY
---
I would suggest a 30k cap limit per week so you can essentially get one "full" inventory of caps a week just from normal vendors, then we just need more good cap sinks like the gold bullion seller at wayward, maybe make another one for scrip? Or just add more end-game items like the serum recipes for those who already got them
---
EDIT: Though I am also more of a casual player so I don't know how "bad" that could end up for those who grind daily but recently I did have time to grind daily and this seems like it could work to me
---
some people do not understand what iterative development is.
---
Bugfixes.
---
Yeah, if this sub needs to wake up about something, it's about being up it's own ass
---
Yeah but 60% of the time, it works every time!
---
God I wish
---
A drop like that got me through my first 2 weeks. I think I was level 12, and some guy revived me a bunch of times during an event, then gave me a few dozen stimpacks and a radaway recipe, did a dance and then jetpacked away. As someone who was coming over from the toxic splash park that is gta online, I’d been avoiding other players obsessively to that point. I’m level 35 now, and I I still don’t play well with others, but sometimes when I’m bored, I’ll wait outside the vault and drop level 1 armor and ammo for new folks. 
---
Workshops have been tense. 9/10 people that show up are helpful. The other one is usually a level 250 that one shots me and gets the bonus empty paper bag (and I assume some random junk for taking over the thing. I’m not sure how that works).
---
Pretty sure you're not supposed to request how to do glitches, regardless of whatever BS reason you're doing it for.
---
Enclave are the facists. BOS are techhoarder isolationists. Maxson seems to be retconned into beeing more idealistic in regards to their ulitmate goals that later changed.
---
I have the jetpack and only just used speed demon
---
The negatives scared me too much, been playing since beta ;)
---
So you’re saying I need this? Any others?
---
I hope you and yours are all okay, along with your property.
---
I feel like it should be 7600 atoms for those who can put in that much time. I have like 430 and even that feels like so much honestly
---
Thanks, I might have just been dumping my excess at train station vendors to save on weight so even just selling them at 200-250 caps'll make a nice improvement.
---
It is an armor effect too, just don't know if it has the magic trigger. I didn't even know that armor effects could trigger magic, thought it was just weapon effects.
---
Armor tertiary 15% less while blocking. Melee weapon tertiary also, same wording.
---
I avoid workshops. I'm not fussed about all the events and such. I just like roaming around. My camp is good enough for me. I did give all my level 1 armour to a new player when I upgraded. So hopefully that helped them. But these stimpacks were a god send. The person just waved and dropped a load of stuff and I was so grateful.
---
What is up with the devs.
---
Lately have this happening at every lousy workshop even. Explosive bait.
---
We need organize a responders union where you can call in an army of other players to defend with you. Have a workshop looking that one scene in endgame  "akira.. on your left"
---
For me it usually doesn't lock up but they just start talking, finish a sentence and then I have to wait an awkward amount of time until they start another one (anything between 2-5 seconds) It really kills the immersion and generally ruins the flow of conversations.
---
Yeah I got them from turning steel for Atlas
---
You’d be surprised especially since creature kills count.
---
I want someone to set up a high stakes gambling event where everyone pays in a certain amount and winner takes a top prize
---
...for more than a few weeks
---
Edit: 'sup brotha
---
When skipping I recommend waiting for the first word to be said completely and then doing so, as I it seemed to help for me, might be worth a try
---
I don't buy from those people anyway.
---
I think solo pvp would be boring, but small-scale combat with squads would be fun to watch. I wish the watoga arena was bigger as that is already exactly what you’re talking about. It’s just a little too tiny for pvp.
---
This was my thinking exactly!
---
You’re welcome. 
---
Soon adds up when you consider even like only 10 is 2500 caps, 250-300 each is very reasonable and anyone a decent level will just clear you out if they have the caps.
---
The Dev team (preCovid Lockdown) said that they were going to change events so all participants get the legendary regardless of tagging.  Not sure on the status at this point, but would hope it comes out before the end of the year.
---
The next gen will only improve load times. It won’t fix broken coding.
---
Doing away with duping methods is the number one issue at hand.  New item types will come out, and if they can deal with duping, they can be tradable.  
---
If a new “The Fixer” style weapon came out as tradable, and the dupes were done, you’ll be able to go back to your farming legendaries.  I still think that there should be *some* rewards that can’t be obtained from purveyor and/or random legendaries found in the world, but if they were tradable you’d still be able to pick them up and trade them off.  
---
It’s not worth pursuing the RMT sites.  Sure, you can ban people if it’s found out they did buy items/gold, but it’s so hard to track and they’ll just move it somewhere else.  As long as they aren’t able to sell duped items, it’ll be fine - since there is still only one of that item out in the world.  Who cares if that person paid caps or real money, in the end nothing really changed - only one is out in the world.  There will still be plenty of people who don’t want to spend real money and be willing to trade.
---
Mhh. Yea could also be a translation problem to my language. Wouldn't be the first time.
---
As far as I know the armor effect only effects the magic shotguns. For other guns like the LMG the firerate + legendary effect of the weapon is important
---
When I'm done for the day I always throw a grenade in his little office and close the door for the dramatic effect, but to be honest, I hate Commander Daguerre more.
---
I noticed that too and it was coming from a Tesla rifle shot.
---
I’ve recently found that my map doesn’t always update to show a workshop is claimed. Twice now I’ve went over to claim a workshop for the daily only to find a lower level there and the beacon up with the location built up. I just casually wave and run past to find the next open one.
---
Practically never lol
---
This is how stupid gamers can be 
---
Hey everyone, tell me how to glitch the game!
---
I‘ve never done those NW challenges. Not even once and I‘m close to Lv. 100 on the score board. Don‘t bother yourself with those challenges 💪🏻
---
How much is a 3\* bloodied Nuka Launcher worth 90% weight reduction and faster reload?  
---
I'm not going to sell it but would be fun to know lol
---
Been posted about many times.
---
What's funny is, that's exactly what it was based on. It was a copy+paste of the Watoga Terminal. Problem is, that terminal uses only 1 type of item to turn in (halloween candy). Where ammo needs like 20 types. So that's why all the menus. And people might not want to dump all of a single type into it. For example, I use my 10mm pistol to tag at events so I need to keep some of that ammo on me, but not 20k rounds. That's why the quantities. Coding a whole new interface from scratch would be a lot more work than what they have currently done. Not saying it's not possible, but I'm guessing it's 'not a priority'.
---
Hehe. Argh I can’t stand here either but Ward is on the top of my list.
---
The game was struggling and chugging as I was wandering the savage divide! It's unbearable!
---
And the delay on score challenges registering your score now appears to be 6 minutes after doing them!
---
It does exist. I've learned it, and have had a spare one drop (sold it a long time ago)
---
Eh sounds awful. You should probably just give it to me for proper disposing.
---
You're in for a long haul buddy lol
---
for steel, probably. but bethesda is never going to admit it if we actually fail to meet one the requirements.
---
Yeah I've noticed the live map isnt really live at all. It's delayed by a few mins I think
---
I think the next fallout game is going to need to have an amazing story line, with multiple endings. A  huge redesign of base building tools and a radically different setting. 
---
Finally I think they are going to have to involve multiplayer to some extent. I have seen the work done on multiplayer fallout 4 and think it should be quite easy for a developer to implement something similar.
---
Well it’s nice to see these posts making a come back! It’s been awhile since we’ve had doooOooOooOoom posts
---
Wait is it called the 42 because its not an mg42 its an mg34
---
I did the foundation quest line for the ending and he still bangs on about detonators
---
Thanks a lot
---
Congratulations you're in the minority. No one is telling you to donate 100k in scrap. I'm donating whatever I get whole playing while this event is running.
---
you're about 10 days ahead of the curve. I'm rank 76 and I'm a week ahead.

Proper team-only raids with a lower difficulty single player mode for solo players that has less rewards. Level gated regions where mobs are super high level and maybe even PvP allowed (IE The Pitt). Gladiator ring in Watoga with leaderboard that can be PvP or PvE. Wave defense events that continually rise in difficulty, sort of like radiation rumble on steroids. More nukable minibosses like SBQ and Wendigo Collosus like a super strangler heart in the mire or a sheepsquatch in the Divide or a grafton monster in the forest. Add a fourth star to weapons that is only craftable on existing 3-star weapons with a lot of rare items from a variety of places (not legendary modules) and makes it untradeable. Maybe different recipes that add different effects instead of being totally RNG based. More cap sinks that aren't just RNG. Maybe have a new rare vendor that has really super expensive stuff that's not available anywhere else. Maybe a wandering mole miner vendor like the ones in the event from before.
---
Camps and trading for sure. As opposed to other games. I just like that this game doesn’t give advantages for pvp. Most games, even ones that allow you to turn the feature off like ARK, favor pvp’ers. They either get game-changing lvls or loot or it’s just easy and fun like gta. So I rly respect that there’s a game that is trying to make pvp a mutual agreement rather than a forced mechanic.
---
Good job man, and yeah it’s becoming a slog as next rank costs 3000 rank score.
---
Move the camp object to the side of your camp that doesn't get attacked unless you live in the forest  your pet uses that thing as an anchor for where it can move and higher level enemies will easily kill it
---
So best way to stop that is to just move it where it's least likely to be attacked
---
😂😂
---
I haven’t seen anything about it yet.
---
I sell all plans for 25 caps rare or not.  If they don't sell then they get placed in a world container usually near mumbles.  At one point I think I dumped well over 50 plans just because of the dupe and I needed stash space.  I will trade weapons for more caps though, but I also sell a lot at scrip price, around 10 caps/scrip.  honestly if I get a good drop I will trade it on the other site for the stuff I need like flux.
---
YES. I'm dealing with the same issue, however it's on my own private world and immediately as I log on, so there have been no meat piles to cause the lag. I also noticed that my second client no longer has grass disabled, despite having it turned off in the prefs.ini, which I'm sure has a decent impact on how my PC's able to handle the game (especially two at once).
---
Literally 😂
---
No but I have noticed the lvl 62 ghouls I used to be able to one shot and shrug off return blows have been taking 3-6 hits to kill and I've been getting one shot multiple times.  Not even to knock down to just full dead
---
Because I went to mainstreamed school, and not deaf institute. Their education is a joke.
---
Pretty nice spreadsheet
---
So, u have been playing for 2 years plus have no top tier weapon or armor....damn dude...
---
So if you’re at 70 by tomorrow no need to stress too much
---
I think it is more in line with having an idea and then seeing how much their audience is different then expected and altering course to address this new audience.
---
Boomer almost every time.
---
Dam that’s pretty good
---
Oh absolutely!
---
Even before my most expensive plan was only about 70 caps. Honestly I think people just appreciate low prices so they tend to scoop up a handful of plans even if they weren't intending to initially
---
Pvp assault/capture the flag server.
---
Finished 2 days ago
---
IIRC they are stuck with [Scaleform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaleform_GFx) for anything UI related, so not surprising its slow; its basically Adobe Flash.
---
You can't argue with that
---
Not as much as one would hope due to the weakness of explosive weapons at the moment.
---
Still personally I weigh it based on the roll combinations. Anytime the stars align and you get 2-3 highly desired effects in combination, they're worth way more than just any old weapon. The difference in value between Bloodied/Bashing/50dr and Bloodied/Explosive/Nothing is very substantial. Take that one step further to reload speed or weight reduction on a heavy weapon and you're another magnitude of rarity and value away.
---
Most weapons aren't worth more than 1k in my opinion. It's only the extremely rare, perfect or near perfect rolls that are worth anything.
---
Presuming this is Bloodied/25FFR/Weight as reload and weight are both tertiary effects. Normally this is an exceptionally valuable combo to anyone but we go back to "but its a fatman" so it really just comes down to waiting for eventually someone wanting it.
---
If I was putting it in my vendor I'd probably start it at 10500, because the lb/rb tabs move in increments of 1500 so that's the first mark over 10k. I'd eventually lower the price and expect that it probably won't be bought until 6-8k.
---
The same rolls on another weapon would be more like taking it to a trade channel somewhere and getting whatever I want to use in exchange for it.
---
Someone took my Berserker/Explosive/Reload railway rifle I had up for 12k in less than a day from when I put it in my vendor. They also took my Junkie/40swing/1str Chinese officer sword for 8k at the same time. A bunch of caps went into the void on that one.
---
You stop getting xp after a certain point too? I got gimped one a few thousand xp from roasting scorched with my flamer at around wave 2-3
---
Marsupial stacks with the jetpack I highly recommend it
---
Plus extra carry weight is never a bad thing
---
I honestly don't get how it wasn't clear to you at all. Yes I have seen it and it was very obvious what the circumstances are.
---
Like I'm not even saying I'm smart and you're not. He has a chart and runs through examples. It's VERY clear that pretty much all but the edge case of Fixers couldn't ever have that magic effect and even those probably wouldn't work consistently.
---
I'm genuinely baffled that you needed it spelt out. It really does feel like you either didn't watch the video at all or just got lazy and skimmed it.
---
An instigating western revolver for pretty much everything with the exception of SB(Q) and Sheepsquatch fights - I prefer an anti armor western for that to get more damage from the 2 hits between criticals. 
---
For swarmed/emergency situations I keep a vampiric plasma flamer pistol on me, but I need it hardly. Low level events with a lot of creatures - 10mil Pistol.
---
Recently I removed glow sight and exterminator (both rank 2 in my build) from perception and took the 3 rifleman perks rank 1 plus 1 tank killer because I found a nice instigating lever action - works great, take a few shots from far with the rifle and then go to town with the revolver. Feels very western-style :-)
---
You're right. I've had it happen twice on radiation rumble. Both times it was a tesla rifle on one side and ballistic on the other. The side with the ash piles was laggy as hell, almost impossible to loot anything. As soon as you looked the other way, the fps returned to normal.
---
I am curious what kind of perks/buff increase the damage of the chainsaw and what's the highest level version you can find? I recently found a level 25 one (I think) and it felt cool to use and all but I couldn't deal with high level enemys much, though admittedly I don't know what perks I should've used.
---
Perhaps for eso, BGS pretty well knows who this game is catering too. Making a fun Fallout game isn’t very hard, but their dev team is clearly smaller than it should be. Zenimax is releasing entire countries at the same rate BGS is releasing patches w/ limited new content.
---
I haven’t transferred since update but I never had a problem. I just now started doing it. And everytime I transfer stuff into sack at vault 76 change characters and it’s there
---
My game has been running fine, but the game board has been running in slow mo for a few days, and the scrapping menu at benches has been kind of twitchy.
---
Edit: on Xbox.
---
I’ve been hounding for someone selling flux assortments. Was able to find one guy a while back but weeks of looking and I never find anybody. Would drop all of my caps for them. It’s bad but I never seem to find the right times to go into nuke zones to hunt for them, so I have a bit of some and absolutely never seen the rarer ones😩
---
You can relog to the same server and it will fix fps.
---
*Gives Ward his equipment back and some pictures of the Crater for free*
---
"I'm keeping my eye on you."
---
Uh...what.
---
Even happened for me in Nuclear Winter. I ran up from behind a corner on a guy last night and I'm in power armor and have a 50 cal. He has wood armor and a pistol is all. I go to start shooting and suddenly everything is in slow motion and I end up dead.. I could hear my gun going off sporadically. My internet and connection are great and since I was done with that stimpack daily I moved onto other games afterwards and never had any problem. It makes me think that it's not effecting everybody the same.  
---
It has also happened with me for:  
---
Meat piles.  
---
Vending machines/Vendors (it sold some of my legendaries instead of purified waters..)  
---
Sometimes (not always) when around other players.  
---
PC player
---
Works on any steam version, used Bethesda that gave me steam version, there is a tiny ini change to change modes or at least was, haven't played for like 2 months
---
90 on one account 45 on a second I started week 4.
---
MORE BATTLE ROYALE  
---
MORE FALLOUT 1ST  
---
GIVE US THINGS TO PURCHASE INSTEAD OF PLAY, EVERYONE PREFERS THAT
---
If this is intentional, then the implications are massive. This could mean that at any point Bethesda will make a change to negate any time you invested into 'grinding' for a particular item or cosmetic for the sake of lazy development. If sneaky changes like this are to become commonplace, be prepared to have a dwindling player base. No-one wants to see their time wasted, especially in regards to in game achievements.
---
It's a problem specifically with ash piles. Meat piles are unaffected.
---
:::ehem::: fo76 started with 400 weight stash limit :D and no access to weight limit mods for PA.  Use perks for weight reduction and dont store chems in stash. We should ask ourselves where do all the items go in power armor... seen any pockets? :D
---
It use to be
---
Some of it will depend on how many issues are caused by overloaded servers vs code missing or being faulty. I think we’ll see better performance but only cause there’s a lot of issues in both fields.
---
I can’t play everyday.  I try to play as often as I can.  Having to support a family is my priority.  I don’t want to come across as a “whiny bitch”, but when people are selling items for real cash, it fucks up the economy in the game.  When duper’s slid by Bethesda.....I can’t compete with someone who has hundreds of thousands items, or those with even more.
---
Not gonna argue on that one
---
66 but I haven't played for the past week. I probably won't continue either. Just don't care to complete the run any more. Feels pointless logging in just to do daily challenges.
---
"wake up?" 
---
All I see are people constantly whining about it.
---
I buy antibiotics, disease cures, and blood packs whenever I see them.  (The last two I use to make antibiotics.)  I hate being sick.
---
I sell a lot of stable flux.  Even priced at 300c, I can't keep it in stock.  I also sell junk legendaries for 10c / scrip.  They typically sit around straining the limits of my stash until I notify one of my regulars and they come buy me out.
---
More story. Not just big DLC drops, but more side quests and recruitable allies to periodically drop in the world. What they did with sheepsquatch was pretty good, but now that we have NPCs, story quests like that could be more engaging. The game just needs regular story updates along with the events. I’ve contended all along that Duchess has the perfect quest hub for strangers coming and going with quests and jobs for us. We even get to ask her about other treasure hunting opportunities, so why not have her answer yes once in a while.
---
I can most definitely say it isn't visual. If it is then they broke some mutations cause my faster reload from speed demon isn't working
---
It is so sad, this ultra capitalist way of thinking, and it will be our downfall as a species in the end.
---
I picked it up as a SQ drop and then used it to complete a Tadpole/possum quest, so I keep it on display, its weight reduction mod means i'm not wasting to much stash to do it.
---
I may have one you can have. I'll just pop on and check
---
The answer is the same as all other questions about Bethesda games: 
---
Because they rely on modders to add this functionality for free
---
This and the Jen response happened to me. Beckett also mentioned &gt;!burying his brother, even though we saved him!&lt; at the end of my most recent playthrough. An on another there was mention of &gt;!Johnny's death!&lt; at the end of Vault 79, and that was also untrue.
---
None of these changed the story.
---
I actually did post about the XP requirements per item skip but you must have ignored them. It was a brief, summarized breakdown so here:
---
Each choice to toss away an NW challenge and go for the XP repeatable instead requires you having to amass 30k XP.
---
10k XP = 100 SCORE
---
NW daily challenge = 250 SCORE
---
10k XP x 3 = 300 SCORE
---
If you toss away the NW daily every day for 100 days, that's an extra 3,000,000 XP (10k x 3 x 100) you have to amass. Over 100 days you could manage, sure, but if you're like me and missed quite a few days are aren't inclined to grind? It's a SLOG.
---
This isn't even counting when the NW challenge is a weekly. That's an extra 100k (100 SCORE x 10 = 1000, 10k x 10 = 100k) every time.
---
SBQ doesnt even dole out 2k a takedown. Basically what you have to do is just set up camp in your living room/bedroom/gaming room/whatever and GRIND MERCILESSLY FOR HOURS to get there.
---
Maybe it is just me. Maybe I am truly just melodramatic like half the replies have suggested. Or maybe when people just roll in, call me names because they don't like how I've presented my opinion that some people seem to agree with, and tell me to 'suck it up' because 'it's not that hard' and 'I'm not missing anything if it's not done', maybe they should do the fucking math instead of being dickbags with no helpful constructive criticism that I don't want to engage with because they have nothing important to say.
---
I was using one yesterday @ line in the sand. Beat the event solo and not even speced out for commando. So I guess it's working for Xbox.
---
You’re welcome! :)
---
Yes. I've noticed it more commonly with ward. Well be talking and all of a sudden he will begin repeating i don't trust u over and over. Hurts my feelings since i grinded allies with him. 😂
---
Considering all problems are the same on pc I don’t see next gen improving anything that needs to actually be improved.
---
Well I would say whatever I put in my machines. I had 913 plans in my machines I am down to 50 in just 3 days.(got another 200 plans in those 3 days also)  Also any weapon/armor I put up is a fair price 500 caps or cost for any 3 star. Be it bloodied/junkies or unyielding 500 caps. All ammo including cores 1 cap.   
---
As for me personally I will buy any plan I do not own even at some crackhead prices. Otherwise I have two personal unicorns I have been hunting for still and will buy/trade if seen.  
---
Display weapons are for trade only.
---
Yeah, they are fun. And I'd even be ok with them being in the atom shop (cause you know that's what they have planned for them) *if* there is a reliable way to get them in game like with the repair kits. It's also nice having them be limited though. If they are everywhere they will get annoying fast.
---
Yeah, I've seen protest nukes dropped on there too.
---
I wonder, does Dorsey wear a hazmat suit like the settlers do if he's nuked?
---
Don't forget he sometimes can't even sit at his desk properly...
---
For me, these NW challenges got me into the NW mode and I enjoy it quite a lot. Before the Legendary Run I played once or twice and it didn't click for me as I'm a casual player and into PvE.
---
Fallout 76 has this mode done quite good since it's the only battle royale that gets me some emotions while playing and also I have the ability to play multiple ways: solo, bush wookie, team, stealth, full balistic with a PA etc.
---
It's just about getting everyone something, it's not going to be for everyone liking.
---
These were are the best part of the Legendary Run. I gave a low a couple of decent roll low level legendaries and he repaid me by popping off *four* lunchboxes! So I took him to Wes Tek to celebrate.
---
I think this patch is based on 1st patch ever. Damn it. Feels like that patch where everything was reverted 2 patches back XD
---
No, the answer is no. What exploit are you referring to exactly? The double wall now? Cheating, yeah sure .... and im Jeff besos.
---
Well I would like to have the shiny thing. Also they tied getting atoms in with having to grind for these score points. So getting them is slightly more important than it otherwise would be if those two things did not exist.
---
I would like to go back to chilling and making nice bases, trust me.
---
Aye. had one in vendor. It's yours if you want it
---
I'm at 74. I play mostly long enough to get the dailies, and I've skipped 1 or 2 of the daily level up and some of the nuclear winter challenges.
---
A lot of stuff I would like them to implement as well. Unfortunately, I think many of these issues are a result of a poorly staffed dev team. That only gets fixed when administration takes f76 srly
---
Yeah, that's exactly why weight reduction is really good for heavy weapons. I snapped up a Bloodied/FFR/Weight UGL for 4k somehow. Lucky stars, I have no idea why it was in that guys vendors for such a pittance but I really had a moment there when I came across it.
---
I wasn't even seeking out bloodied weapons because I didnt realize they reached 100% damage instead of the 50% other weapons top out at. Didn't see the point. So to me I looked at it and was like "well its not perfect but its a step above my Furious 1*"
---
Little did I know that unless a patch changes something I'll never upgrade my gatling laser again.
---
Using the same mods as the 1*, its about 20 lbs lighter. The weight effect on weapons is weird and doesn't apply to modifications well so its still running about 12lbs instead of the 1.8 it would be with baseline effects.
---
You could stash her console to get rid of her
---
It still works for me, but it’s different now.
---
Old version: Walk up to Ward and he launches right into the dialog for completing the quest.
---
New version: Walk up to Ward and go through the dialog for assigning the quest. Then immediately interact with him again and he goes into quest completion dialog. 
---
For me, anyway, the only difference is I have to go through two dialogs instead of one.
---
It depends on what you're into. I've always been a story and exploration kind of person so single player would be more focused and less time wasted on time gates and jumping through hoops.
---
Though, given how 76 has turned out, I'd be VERY surprised if the majority of the current mechanics don't make it into the single player Fallout.
---
At a bare minimum I'm expecting an MTX store, time-gated daily/weekly in-game rewards for repeatable quests, challenges for the MTX store currency and some multiplayer component, either coop or NW-style MP game mode.
---
Oh, and pay2win shit sold in the MTX. It won't matter as much since it's a single player game but they will inevitably make the base gameplay intentionally grindy and annoying in order to sell us the solution. XP boosts, unique gear etc.
---
wow,,,,, which is also kind of the premise of the game...
---
It's true, almost nobody uses them most people won't even take them for free.
---
at this point i question the ability of the company to fix it at all.
---
the framerate issues are inexcusable.
---
I never pick up my piles of meat ... I like to watch the word burn
---
Plasma or fusion cores at a decent price, .308 rounds if they're a cap each, fuel and 2mm cartridges. Maybe junk items depending on what I need immediately
---
I got a Vampires Mr Handy Saw thingy for 100 caps, its fairly decent at taking out high level enemies (with electric mod) and it does make me pretty much invincible
---
Ok fair, so then shouldn’t all rifles get more bullets in their drums?
---
Let me clarify.  You do need the code, but they're made public on the Nuka Crypt website.
---
It's just a novelty challenge to track hours played. If it rewarded a seriously desirable number of Atoms, people might AFK for it.
---
Sadly I’ve Ben experiencing way more frequent crashes , might need to verify the game.
---
It's more of a time thing when it comes to that though. I rarely get that XP proc three times in a daily run, so it's a near-impossible challenge unless I diverted time from elsewhere to just sit and grind like a madman.
---
can you please hotfix the vats failure and queens limbs and the framerate issues on consoles (not only the meatpiles).
---
thank you
---
Usually Ward, Rocksy and Wren. But the worst is the girl who accepts Mirelurk meat. She only says 1 line before locking up, and have to completely exit the dialogue and re-enter. Then she'll say 2 lines (1 line further/deeper) then lock up again. Finally one more exit/enter then she'll say all 3 lines for me to complete that quest.
---
Congrats. I've missed days. I'm behind quite a bit.
---
Not as often, but I definitely experience it at least once a day. Ward, Rocksy, Wren - sure happened with all of them though.
---
Another thing I found is the Former Raider, picking the "I just want to talk" option seems to *always* bug out, like he goes on to his next reply, *maybe*, and then the convo simply breaks up and I have to initiate again.
---
A cash register plan, a item for item trading system, and the ability to kill Russell Dorsey before he can rebuild Atlas.

Yes!  
---
I have invested far more hours into this game than all of the single-player fallout games combined.  No amount of NPCs or "stories" can make the wasteland feel more alive than other players can.  Games are more fun with friends.
---
Is it really not hole? Kind of disappointing. First time I heard it I thought that sounded a bit bold but then just went with it.
---
Another bug Ive found: when doing the raider quest when you have to find rokko - you can't enter his building - the text will go grey - back to white - \*click\* - grey and back to white, not allowing me to go in and talk with him.
---
See now this is how you handle being over-matched at a workshop. Well done. I'll admit I started reading with my eyes already half-rolled, but this is definitely different than most posts of its ilk
---
Everything I've been able to discern about holotape games, bobbleheads, and magazines, is that there are predictable locations they can spawn, but what you're going to find there is a toss-up, not only in what game for example, but whether or not it's a game, bobblehead, or mag.

Xbox has been brutal. I have disconnected as much as used to happen at launch. Open Pipboy, freeze. Fast travel, disconnect. Enter building, infinite load screen. The game is borderline unplayable.

I'm glad you enjoy it. I feel the opposite. I dont think having to go into another game mode, especially one that I dont even like, to get something I want is necessarily not a scummy bullshit tactic and patently punishing people for not playing every aspect of the game every single day.
---
Purified water is your best friend.

I'm doing great. I'm rank 80something.

They have put an update or something in the way the engine makes graphics because deeeeeer lord.......
---
Thanks sir!!!
---
if you dont need it sell it people will pay you decently
---
It will still look and play terribly on next generation lmao
---
Nope. 
---
Also it is happening everywhere, they did put something reaaaaaally messy in a graphic update.
---
Bethesda are who they are. A different studio might have handled things differently - invested more into it and not been so mask-off with the profiteering, but Bethesda isn't that savvy or just don't care that we know what they're really like.
---
I feel like real MMO's have prepared me for this game's limited bank space. From back in beta, to now. I'm usually towing the line at around 700/800. Though being a rifle user has massive draw backs...

Glowing blood/meat

I use it but only two levels on my junkies build. Between my STR, INT and AGI (melee/heavy weapons), I can't devote a huge amount of points to LUCK and having two allows me 3 points to juggle with combat or convenience perks while running bloody mess and starched genes. For example pharma farma is a must for junkies and I really like grim reapers sprint and psychopath with a shotgun it my Gatling gun.
---
I saw a couple ppls allies* with the suit/helmet and it’s not in the atom shop so it’s gotta be glitched
---
This, it's called [MG42](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_MG42_light_machine_gun)
---
Yup extreme sadness when I’m farming line in the sand only to be dcd before the 2nd wave, id say all in all got dc’d 4-5 times playing Tuesday, haven’t played since.
---
Purified water, meat from animals, glowing meat, sometimes players sell mutations in their vendors for 200-250 caps and they can be resold to vendors for 500 caps.
---
If I had a bottle cap for every one of these posts :
---
The thing that confuses me is what was changed with ash piles that causes this much lag? I know Bethesda doesn’t tell us everything but it doesn’t seem like there were any animation, particle, or model changes with them, so I don’t know why all of a sudden they’ve been causing lag.
---
Two copies of the game?
---
It does damage but you don't know to who since there are no arcs anymore. Also direct hit deals -90% damage. Arc -&gt; 100, direct hit -&gt; 8. WTF?
---
Is it actually applied in a sequence and multiplicative way? because then it would turn out at 33.1% for three cards which give 10%. And that's actually pretty good to know, I thought people just did it to safe perk points as the subsequent ranks just add 5%, also do you know whether or not that logic also applies for consumable buffs and the like?
---
I disagree with the cap limit being removed. Caps are essentially worthless and a forced low cap forces people to spend them so they dont lose out on profit when cap at 30k, and a good deal of that goes into other players pockets, stimulating the economy. I would however be in favor of the limit being raised to 50k. But the script limit can go away for sure.
---
Yes the menu lag. You think I care about holotapes I’ll never look at enough to slow my menu down? Nope. Goodbye hoarding.
---
Cool, thanks. I'll keep an eye out for these quests.
---
40
---
Faster swing speed switch blade to complete my blood eagle greaser role play.
---
100 of each is clearly not enough. If I need to make ammo or make weapons to get mods off of them. Stashing legendaries for later uses. One of the biggest complaints is about the stash limit. So instead of increasing it to say idk 1500, which I believe would be more than sufficient, they put more junk stash in a premium service. Tons of bugs still in the game among numerous other things that still need to be fixed and they have the nerve, the gall, to charge people a monthly subscription for features that should be available to all players. I don't believe I nor the community would be asking for much for another stash increase. Im constantly around 700ish weight in the stash and I have the minimal materials I need to keep armor and weapons repaired. It's a shitty system. Needs revamping or even just simply adjusting weight to be less in the stash so you can store more.
---
Perhaps, I’ve seen pretty different problems between PC and console though. Modding has always put a greater strain on servers, and people I’ve known with private servers seem to have a much easier time starting up their game and loading game assets. 
---
I can go a few minutes with only static elements in my game before I start seeing vendors, camps, mobs, junk, benches. Anything that can interact with the player.
---
Right? Like you can't change a game just because you don't like it. There's always a way around and people just want to change the game at their will. I haven't done any NW challange, not even the place your camp and I'm at level 85. Also there's free atom challenges, if you are that concern spend them on a level. 
---
The board it's designed to last for another 3 weeks and there's another double score daily coming up, people just freaking out because they want to complete the board like now and they don't want to spend money on it.
---
wow they use flash ingame
---
that explains a lot
---
Cool Bethesda got another thing wrong the "mg42" that's in game is actually an mg34 which is the previous model it has a similar fire rate to the one in game and is visually identical to the one in game
---
Today or tomorrow will be the first time I go a whole day without ranking up.
---
I mean, I can do that with a mole miner gauntlet and the right foods, so that's not necessarily a good test. A better test is try shooting the queen and if you can visibly see her damage bar go down while you are shooting her then you probably have a magic weapon.
---
To my surprise Russel put on a Rad suit. I was hoping for the worst but had to laugh that They programmed that in.
---
Is there plans I need to buy to build legendary items? Or does having the legendary modules attach to any basic weapon/armor?
---
marine tactical helmets. Whack on super duper. Cost like 3-4 caps to make. sell for something like 35 caps. There's a few places the plans can spawn. I got a nice little route i check now and then. If the helmet plan doesn't spawn you can get other plans you can sell like BoS underarmour and marine armour.
---
I agree, the core issue is the lack of experience devs on the team, until they invest in some more experience and quality devs we are going to see the same ramshackle mess again and again.
---
I‘ve missed at least 10 days, too. Maybe that helps you to estimate if you can still do it without the NW challenges.
---
I’ve seen video cut scenes and credits roll at the end of a game.
---
Shoot I just wish there were more Ultracite skins in the game.
---
I much prefer the interface the way it was initially, buy and sell separated and sell only shows what you have enough of to sell. That didn't need to change, they just needed to add better bulk-sell options and increase the cap.
---
Probably because ESO has an entire development team behind it while 76 has been handed off to the Austin branch of Bethesda.
---
I dont think 1 challange is bad, i sure think it should be more rewarding, like 500 or 750 points, but thats my opinion
---
Yes. It's making the game unplayable. Freezing,  endless load screens,  crashes. It's like we went back to BETA.
---
I did 3 transfers last night.  No problems for me.  Always a chance for lost connection etc.  I never transfer more than a few items or I transfer lots of junk, I wouldn't be too mad at losing junk.  Until they make a way to move items between characters you are stuck either using this method or a middleman.
---
They absolutely shouldn't fix this because being able to destroy your own camp objects is actually [extremely useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNARr5Mevxw) for a [variety of reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTtyI_30Kwk). If they fixed this it also wouldn't resolve your issue because the flame can't penetrate objects without destroying them, so if the wall was invincible the flame would never damage anything because its in the way.  
---
You can however do what you want to do, ironically, by using the flamer to destroy the wall and then moving them closer to the wall, something I cover here: [https://youtu.be/iNARr5Mevxw?t=162](https://youtu.be/iNARr5Mevxw?t=162)
---
I joined the scorched earth event last night and it actually spawned me inside the fissure and insta killed me, was great.
---
I'm hoping I'm able to, but the NW speed bump is...certainly something to overcome in the latter days to come. I'm already not filling up a full SCORE bar a day, I'm feeling pretty fucked.
---
Because with the fixer you can zero AP. Become a God.
---
Always a silver lining.
---
Great suggestion
---
Quad ffr cryo is best for queens
---
That's what I always did. I set up workshops, and half the time a player takes it just to goad me into a fight. I go on about my business and five minutes later they're gone from the server.
---
I'm on xbox. Only issue I've had is more frequent disconnects. Other than that general gameplay is fine.
---
I would really like the elder coat back too.. Missed it the first time around.
---
AKA - "I don't understand it so it must not exist"
---
What are the posts normally like ? Honeslty I just thought it was a cool exprience to share &amp; serves as a heads up for others :)
---
I get a fair amount of my own from the queen event and farming when I can be bothered in nuke zones but it’s not nearly enough when you need it to craft fluxes and ammo. Ammo isn’t so bad I guess as I can carry like 50k with ultracite fusion cores, I only really use it when I’m in trouble or fighting the queen, but I ALWAYS want more and it’s the ultimate cap sink. 
---
I’ve found two people so far that were selling stable flux in like 4 months of searching and I bought the lot both times. 
---
It’s a huge influx of caps but I guess it’s not repeatable if you’re not dedicated to farming it so isn’t massively popular. 
---
You gotta find someone like the person I was talking to who has no need for it but gets it over time and is willing to sell, as well as you get there first. Lotta variables to snag it.
---
That would be better, i added that to the post because i highly agree with you
---
You guys need to get over yourselves. It’s a pvp survival game. Go play Minecraft on peaceful if you’re going to complain every time someone kills you
---
Don't bother with plans/recipes. Poor cost to profit ratio.
---
Just pickup high value weapons, pickup and bulk high value junk and just sell that. Considerably more efficient than making items to sell.
---
There's also purified water, high level food items (you'd need to cook/super duper them for max results) and chems/stims often sell well too.
---
I feel like there is a perfect balance to their availability that can be achieved. Not so common that they are annoying and people can just sit on their own popping lunchboxes to keep their exp boost up but not so rare that people feel the need to horde them for just the right time. Just enough that people want to use them and feel encouraged to share then with others for potential benefit - that's the sweet spot that makes them work real well.
---
And stop making things immovable objects! I had to completely change the layout I wanted for my house because of ONE TREE that I couldn't get rid of with a carrot like I normally do, and it prevented me from placing my roof.
---
Edit to say: Y'know what, actually dont worry about it. I can't modify anything structural about my C.A.M.P. ANYWAY, now that the wall workaround has been "patched". I can't move or change my C.A.M.P. at all until they add interior walls as a feature.
---
For 1200 atoms you can buy double sided wall paper
---
Yah, I honestly think the devs are doing their job, albeit they sometimes prioritize stupid things. It seems like someone just threw the newest guys from Austin into a custodian closet and said, “make money.”
---
The System as is doesnt force you to play hours a day to grind gold bullion but encourages you to take a stop.
---
What you should be asking of bethesda is to have an event on a limited time, on a known date and on that date remove the limits temporary and/or add more dailies to the factions (cause as is the variaty is not here).
---
Whinging about being attacked by higher levels, complaining about lost junk. It's a story that's been repeated many times. This one was much better
---
Go shoot the super mutant behemoth. If he dies in under three seconds you got a magic gun.
---
Yooo that'd be amazing
---
Oh duhhhhh, I’ve totally seen that. Thanks for explaining!
---
Pricing is more art than science. It takes a while for new players to acclimate and learn the useful value of things, and sometimes I don’t think they do learn and grow up to be clueless sellers of 10c 50 cal rounds or what not. Even as a high level, I am still learning how to price certain items as the market demands shift. It requires effort to keep vending machines tuned to player wants and needs.
---
Hold the back button and you'll exit the terminal right away.
---
No. Just two GTs playing one copy of the game.
---
Your are 100% correct, the more people show up the more enemies spawn and the more xp u get. The tent only makes them spawn in 1 spot. Thats all I was trying to say, sorry i worded it wrong. Its not an xp glitch.
---
I built my camp on top of a mountain. I like to sit on the deck, listen to Appalachian Radio, and take in the view. It's really cool when it's raining down in the holler.
---
I hope you‘ll make it! 💪🏻
---
That would fuck people over even harder who don't want to do it, or who can't play PVP well enough to make it. 
---
What they should do is make it far more rewarding to people who PVP and do that challenge overall, like make the reward a PVP-only skin, or a NW Perk Pack. That way you get rewarded for repeatedly going into PVP, with stuff that matters if you PVP a lot, and you don't feel like you have to go in there if you don't want to.
---
Oh right I see. Thank you and Thanks for taking the time to read anyway !
---
Yeah that video is proof it needs to be patched. Thanks for showcasing this exploit. Hope the devs take note.
---
Hello!   
---
I sell a lot through my vendors (roughly 20k a day, 60k on a saturday if im on all day)  
---
Most popular items that i sell are   
---
1. serums
---
2. Ammo (I put 1-2000 of each ammo in my vendor and farm steel and led a lot) Sell all for 1 cap except the 2mm EC that goes for 2 caps and Fusion cores go for 49 
---
3. Plans - I do a lot of events and get a lot of plans, two machines are dedicated to plans and i sell them all for 19 caps a pop. Took a while to decide on that but i was havig so much surplus of plans that i decided on one price to make it easier on me and so i could move the high volume of polans i have. 
---
4. I barely use stims,radaway,chems so all of that goes in there, also almost everything for 19 caps, diluted stuff goes for 9 and super stims 29
---
I haven't been following next gen at all. If Bethesda actually does a next gen version is going to be just an upgraded XB1 game playing on backwards compatibility with enhancements added? Trying to see if it is likely to be compatible for players from both gens playing together? Or if it would be more like a one time import of your XB1 character into the free XB2 version of the game? Curious to see how it'll work out when the time comes.
---
I always get the "oh just the person I wanted to see!" Then no chat options glitch
---
I sell them for 5-10 caps though fixer plans i put for 5k. I have never needed to get rid of them.
---
Hah, maybe they expected a few nukes would be dropped on his head, lol.
---
I'm getting the same and having the fast travel and respawn glitch loads to since update. The crashes seem to be always be at the worst time trying to loot queen, boss about to spawn in, in project paradise. Getting in and out of power armour etc.
---
I know.  How much concrete does anyone have in reserves?
---
Geeze, never even thought of multiple farms on FO1st. Duhhhhh......
---
You usually do get the same one even after a hard crash if you log back into it within 5 or so minutes. If you didn't it was because the whole server crashed.
---
I sell them for 300, mutations that is.
---
For all platforms? I'm on ps4 if that makes any difference
---
"Hello and thanks for your concern! we've forwarded your suggestion to the team in hopes that you'll stop asking and eventually forget!"
---
I just learned this trick. All the button fatigue it could have saved.
---
Buying and selling serums is a rookie trap. 
---
If you bought the serums at 200 each and you sold 2 for 1000 total, you're not making 1000 caps, you're making just 600 caps. You've just wasted 400 caps of the max daily limit you could have extracted from the vendor.
---
Soon in the Atom Shop
---
I'd prefer a respec coin instead like Eso has
---
What makes you think this is an exploit anymore than any other camp building glitch? They are aware of the ability to do this and have been for quite some time. The double wall glitch was fixed because people found a way to use it for duping, something entirely unrelated to camps. They don't have a problem with build glitches.
---
GT: rammadeus. I'm at lost home. i'm in a build team if you join you can travel for free. Also the rare trader is here as a bonus
---
GT?
---
Also junk that players want are
---
* Lead
---
* steel
---
* acid
---
* plastic
---
those are the top sellers of mine
---
It's pretty much free score. There's only been a few somewhat difficult tasks to complete. There's no reason to change it. Despite what people say there are alot of people who enjoy nw.
---
Thanks. Was only clicking it. Didn't pause while holding it down. Appreciate the feedback.
---
you use the plans you buy with the gold bullion. those all require legendary modules, and will craft as legendary
---
I agree, they could have made this pretty easy
---
Learn to farm rubber is step one of MTH.
---
Sodasnappy. Thanks again man.
---
Awee man.. dont be like that.. dont call them animals.
---
Thats a fullthrottle facial dickslap and insult to every actual animal living on the planet.
---
Same. The only thing that I started noticing is some  meat piles disappear and the loot that the meat piles contained was just items scattered on the ground.
---
I had the same issue, when I started using the ammo converter to make shotgun shells, and thought it was the converter causing the issue.  
---
But a lot of people report having the same issue from the start of the game, it's an intermittent issue the pops up for people occasionally, for me it lasted a couple of weeks and touch wood hasn't appeared again for a while.
---
PS4 as well... And yeah, I've hard crashed on private servers after a nuke and got back to the same world before. If you get a new one its because the original server died.
---
this is one of the first things i got from the atom shop when the game launched lol
---
So you played nw up to 140 I assume for rewards. Surely after that you know how to place down a camp 3 times or use a stimpack.
---
You're expecting the game to be something it's not.
---
The worlds aren't persistent by design. All of them, public of private. All you get with private worlds is your own separate instance, that's it. Nothing else special comes with it.
---
I'm fairly certain the world itself was the same, I just didn't have ownership of the workshops I got. Not sure why that happened then,
---
only everyone.
---
don't worry, patch coming September!
---
I got 80 atoms today for launching a nuke I've already launched a few?
---
it was like this for me before the update
---
Except, I don't really like him, and my feelings towards Bethesda are souring.
---
No, my main character level is in the 140's. My NW level is 5.
---
If you are solid enough to take on a bunch of snallys at once i suggest serverjumping at Toxic Larry's Meat 'n Go. There are ALWAYS three of those buggers hanging out there.
---
Try this - not sure if it'll work and can't find a shorter link on the discord right now!
---
https://discord.com/channels/602253035061903368/718545522104991827
---
I get a MAJOR (2-3fps) frame drop in the first 5-15 minutes of joining a server but after they are done I don't have any
---
72 on one and 42 on another, though I missed a lot the last week.  I also haven’t done anything on the second one the last 2 weeks, work is crazy and busy weekends.  I am like 4 days ahead so not sweating it and believe there is another daily double with Atlas that should give everyone a buffer
---
atleast those devs knew when to discontinue their products even though we're still stuck with this.
---
/u/ladydevann /u/valseek /u/lonevaultwanderer
---
Fixing 2 and 2.5 would probably kill a lot of lag issues. Do you know how many copies of the battle bot shit I have in my inventory? It takes 15-30 seconds to scroll thru that part of my misc.
---
Mixed bag, but imma lean single player. It just sucks fruitlessly server hopping in the hopes of finding a pristine resource farm that hasn’t already been looted to the bedrock.
---
It’s even worse with instances. I thought that each instance was unique to you (or your team if you play in groups). But no. I’ve gone into Sugar Grove and found every globe, desk fan and ammo bag already taken. I’ve had other players show up while I’m in an instance and ruin my day. So I guess I don’t know how instances work.
---
The worst was when I went through a grueling maze that I was under leveled for. I managed to kill everything inside with most of my ammo expended and my primary weapon broken...and then two d****bags show up, respawning all enemies (one of them on top of me) and hassling me to join their team while they ruin stealth stomping around in their loud frickin power armor.
---
Not their fault and I’m sure they were good guys but they ruined the mission I was so close to completing and sent me off the game for the day. I’m still baffled to how instances work. It certainly isn’t all like the Wayward. 
---
OTOH I’ve had some great moments and helpfulness from others. Just doesn’t outweigh the negatives.
---
Ah I see a fellow gamma gun user ;) I love it, you die and lose your need rage, shoot yourself 3 times and back in the game
---
If only dude but Bethesda just doesn't care to. If they did, they would have already put in that effort some time ago.
---
At best all we can hope for is incremental change.
---
i did it yesterday to check if its working as so much is broken now and yes the suit is still in the backpack near a large power pole at southern belle motel
---
Yeah you are right too, but i dont really get bothered, when i think i cant do the challange i quit it, so i dont know, never thought that much, hope the next season you get what you want
---
I mean game wise yeh makes no sense why the paints don't apply to t-51 since that's all tagertys group used. Lore wise they should have been using t-60. It's more where the hell did they manage to get so many t-51 suits from. It just different brotherhood fractions I guess east cost had t-51, west coast used t-60. I guess the devs thought that since players mostly associate the Brotherhood wearing t-60 armor they decided to only give skins to that. I imagine this will change soon with the Brotherhood questlines.
---
yeah I had to put down the controller laughing the first time he told me 'we have a few dozen but it's the principle'
---
like damn ward I just killed about a dozen people, and you're talking about principles
---
Since I done the update I’ve been getting them all throughout the playtime in every server. From 60 to 30 constantly. Never used to get them hardly.
---
Boomer is the worst. I just want to skip every time I see him but it always breaks his conversation for some reason. Prior to Wastelanders though I wouldn’t even be able to interact with it to start the quest.
---
Absolutely use it!
---
Yeah when I saw it in the trailer with the new event I was like man I can’t believe I didn’t buy that.
---
I took an empty workshop well away from anyone and the defend challenge popped almost immediately so I decided to take a chance. Sure enough, right in the middle of fighting wave 3 of 4 of supermutants a level 500 something snuck up behind me stealthed and one shot me from behind...tbagged me, did the mothman dance then left...probably disappointed I had remembered to stash all my junk before taking the workshop. He didn't even try to take the workshop...probably hoping I might come back.
---
Congratulations, at level 500+ you had to sneak up behind a level 55 while he's fighting supermutants and attack him from stealth. Such a PVP master \*snicker\*
---
Kind of sad that's how these players get their kicks doing pathetic stuff like this.
---
YES!!!
---
Woah thanks, omw!
---
The Enclave develops time travel and successfully uses it to take over Bethesda Studios just after the release of Fallout New Vegas. They then go on to create a multiplayer online game called Fallout 76. The rest is history so they say...
---
His skeleton is in a cage hanging from a tree in my camp.   One too many snarly, "I've got my eye on you."
---
When was it even available?  Been playing 13-14 months and don't even remember missing it
---
Agreed.
---
Yeah, for people who want to even play NW. Good for them, good for you. I don't. It's the opposite of fun to me. I play games for fun, so being told I lose something for not playing the the not-fun thing is annoying at best.
---
Before the update i saw them from time to time but only for a few seconds
---
Two things that haven’t been mentioned yet are golf outfits/skirts that you can pick up at Whitesprings and straight jackets at Fort Defiance. They sell for around 50 caps each and you can find 15-20 of each every day. Plenty to max daily sales to vendors in an hour or less of farming.
---
Any prefixes that can mesh well could be considered good, and lucky if its a rare roll (uny, lifesaving) that meshes with the other prefixes. Weight reduction rolls are great as well, since you can free up a perk card with most.
---
When you get assassin rolls outside of NW, or stat plus-one with exterminator or mutant slayer's, I'd consider it a poor roll. 
---
Armor seems to have more useful rolls available than weapons, which I notice tends to make more useful pieces over junk. 
---
With weapons, they're harder to roll a good one, but have more single prefix rolls that can make or break the weapon, ie explosives, furious etc.
---
A good roll I have personally is a Zealot's explosive gatling 5mm, with prime barrel and weightless. I've relied heavily on this one for over 100 levels, which makes it a very lucky roll for me. It is also versatile across many builds, which I feel makes a very lucky roll for many players.
---
So yes, I agree with you 100%: the value of a weapon or piece of gear is determined by who looks at it.
---
I found her there couple weeks ago so every night I see if she’s there and I also found her near the grove last night but most times she doesn’t have the outfits that are rare I bought all clothes the last time she had any on her but none where rare I’m also on Xbox.
---
atleast there they made sure it's in the menu.... looking at you new SS mod plans
---
Is there a challenge to launch x number of nukes? Glad it correctly gave you atoms, unfortunately most of the rrmaining atom challenges seem to be bugged.
---
Same thing on PS4 also regular weapon racks don't clip to walls anymore
---
I hope you do too!
---
Get your helmet on, Chicken Little!
---
&gt;In the PTS, all of this stuff worked.
---
Makes things even more interesting....
---
It’s weird because some people are saying they ain’t getting the problem I’m facing but a lot of other people are unfortunately...
---
It took me 4200 hours to figure out I should take a break and play something else.
---
Crazy what can happen if one hand doesn't know what the other does.
---
So THIS.
---
Not sure I'll have a look
---
I found a Mutants 25/25 combat rifle for 499 caps. It's way better than my Mutants Fixer. That extra stealth isn't needed when you melt through lvl 68 super mutants with a few headshots. That faster fire rate is way better than stealth. The stealth cards are enough.
---
What GT means? I wanna join
---
Don't get me wrong I feel the update made it alot better but I agree with you for depositing ammo. If I could just select all the ammo I don't want at once like a trade menu and get the points that way it would make the converter amazing and so much quicker to use.
---
97 soooo close
---
Ehm no. I'm a real hoarder. If 1 of my stable flux stacks drops below 500 i almost 'panic' i want as much materials as possible before i cancel fo1st. Too bad optic fiber is so hard too find
---
And the BoS event is in-game proof of another payment experiment. They gave us a community quest with almost zero story or background and told us to donate millions of items for vague rewards. 
---
1. The NPC has no contact with BoS. 
---
2. He's only "read about them"
---
3. There is a intermittent, barely audible, repeating radio broadcast
---
4. "Give me all your stuff so we can "be ready"
---
They are testing to see how much we will do as a community with little promised as rewards or even the work put in for a story line. As a story arch, this guy could poof with all of our materials and leave a note saying "Thanks for the stuff!"
---
It is common.
---
Beth seriously botched this update
---
Wards quest would auto complete for me up until the last update. All I had to do was talk to him. I think it’s because I picked up a portable power pack which was never removed from my inventory. I really enjoyed it while it lasted instead of doing the chore of fast traveling to get the mission done to fast travel back.
---
This this this this this!
---
I actually like the limited stash. In 4, I would loot everything down to the smallest thing. And I wasn't even going to always use what I was hoarding.
---
Yeah, it took me several runs through Battle Bots to realize I could just reuse the keycards from the event.
---
My testing with a Lever with a base damage of 98 (let’s say 100 because I can’t recall the numbers) but it supported the following. 
---
100+10% =110, +10% (11)=121, +10% (12.1)= 131.1 so yes, I was mis-remembering, 133.1%
---
Edit to add
---
I understand all buffs pretty much work the same way, it was the only way you could stack up the range to 1-shot the SBQ
---
I teleport to vault 79 once a week at best.

He does put a rad suit on.
---
Hours to rankup overseer? Unless you're a high rank it won't take very long. Just hide until you get the final combatants announcement and run into the firestorm.
---
Could have sworn that's explained to you in game at some point.  Never paid attention to look because I remember it from previous Fallout games.
---
I buy the least desirable stuff just so people are like "wow i need to restock with more of that!".
---
Bought a sweet ivory grip mod the other night for 150 caps.
---
It's confusing how people can view a company as somehow deeply plotting devious long term plans to make money and yet completely incompetent and inept. 
---
You can either say they're either evil capitalists or incapable fools. Ya don't get to pick both sides.
---
It's not even for just true veterans too. You could have created an account a week before Wastelanders and you're now classified as a veteran. A veteran should be someone who made an account in the first 6 months. That outfit has zero prestige.
---
Old players didn't get that popup, we played w/o that shit.
---
Lol that was my original point. I don’t know why you’re indifferent to it when you said the same thing. The game has been handed off to their least experienced branch in order to see how what they can do with as little investment as possible.
---
Eso has a dev team now, originally it was just bits and pieces from the studios they owned, as Zenimax was not a developer. They just handled Bethesda Softwork’s gaming IP’s. After awhile, they started turning that around and made sure that all the work was handled by Zenimax directly instead of being handed off to subsidiary employees.
---
ESO, although bigger, was in almost the exact same state. And Zenimax’s studio is actually half the size of Bethesda’s. So their dev team can’t be that much bigger than FO76, even if BGS has multiple projects-which I’d assume Zenimax has some future projects going on as well. The difference in dev team size doesn’t match the rate of major content released, unless one project has proven it’s worth investing into while the other still hasn’t hit that mark. Either way, it doesn’t take 2 years to realize your audience wants something else, but it does take that long to decide whether there’s long-term financial viability in maintaining services on an morpg.
---
Last year's atom bundle deal for Quakecon 2019
---
Can’t agree more. It’s honestly frustrating because I do love this game. I want to play it. Bethesda breaking their games on updates are making me not want to play anymore and go back to new Vegas or fallout 4.
---
Well I've noticed my inventory getting laggier the more items I carry.
---
I believe it still completes, but you have to listen to his normal speech then you can immediately return to him and it completes. That's what I've read, though I haven't tried it myself
---
I just carry 5 different bows and have universal ammo. I like that more than your suggestion tbh
---
Aye. i always check here for trader, plans, mags and bobbleheads. part of my route. The spawn rare is so much better than the responder vendor at charleston. I reckon the trader is here 1 in 10 times i check. Possibly even better. Charleston was easily more.
---
I personally preferred the other setup, where buying and selling ammo were in two different compartments and the sell option ONLY showed the ammo you had enough of to convert. I could just pop in, pick the ammo I wanted to convert and then pop back out. Now I have to check the pip boy to see what I have, or get the transaction failed screen. It's aggravating as FUCK.
---
A low effort way to gather a decent amount of acid are the events Tea Time and Campfire Tales - just pick up all the bloodbug proboscis from the corpses, each one is 2 acid. Bonus: Treasury notes.
---
Add bird bones and you can float around all over the place, lol.
---
Trying to get these pic off ps4
---
I was considering nuking it just a few minutes ago, but with almost all of the section chiefs active, the game crashed. I managed to get back on the same server, but the whole silo reset, so instead, I got nuked IRL by this game.
---
Finally! someone with the guts to take care of Ward!
---
gamertag, search him up in the "find someone" section
---
I made a comprehensive thread about this a while ago actually:  
---

---
Is it not a heavy thus should have always been on the ground stands?
---
It's not a matter of "Who needs it?" it's a matter of "Does it benefit the player in any way?". If yes, patch is scheduled yesterday. If not...then better hope there will be a patch for it after all one day in a billion years.
---
I deleted all the holotapes and notes i had in my stash and inventory and i cant remember even half of them. They also took me like 30 seconds of scrolling lol
---
Oh I get her to show you a lot but a lot of times she has recipes or bulk scrap
---
I would like something along the lines of once you've hit 50 you can restart from inside the vault again. 
---
Stash and CAMP do not go away. But anything on you is lost. 
---
You will now have a Star next to your name to show you have become legendary. 
---
You can redo all quests, side missions etc etc 
---
After hitting 50 again you can gain the choice of becoming 2 star and then eventually 3 star. 
---
Now why? Well aside from experiencing something fresh from a new perspective and possibly changing builds easier. Every star you own increases the chance of that Star legendary dropping in the world. Even 1 star enemies if your 3 star can now drop up to 3 star legendaries. 
---
Totally rough idea.
---
62 here. Quitting after I get the chicken coop.
---
If I wouldn’t be working I would come join
---
I’ll give it a whirl and report back
---
Stop complaining about playing a part of the game you aren't forced to play. Some people like the game mode and probably would like to have a reward for playing it. If anything I'd like to see more NW challenges so there's a balance of NW and adventure
---
Next unlock for me is the Chicken Coop. I’ve only missed three days so far. One for the auto complete bug at the beginning and two while away on vacation.
---
Fml really? Cuz I also have like 30 keys from it too
---
he messes up even the simple things..just like Beth.
---
It would be MUCH more entertaining if this guy is running a giant PONZI scheme and scamming the donators. 
---
This guy has no real connection to any BoS. He's literally making it all up and people are throwing millions of items at him for nothing. There are real life scams that have been perpetrated in exactly the same way! Hell, some churches operate on this principle! "The second coming is upon us, donate now so we can be ready!"
---
We need a new area. Period. Make it really fucking hard and put a restriction on it. For example, ypu can't even enter the area until you hit level 200. Make the enemies hard. It gives vets a new place to explore and things to fight while giving low levels a goal, hit level 200.
---
I use 200 bc it seems high. Level 50 is easy to get to and we need to think of the players who have been around since forever and are already level 400-800. 200 isn't too outrageous. Its not hard to level up and 200 can easily be hit at 100 hours even if you take your time.
---
Ah! Nice. So up to 10 characters?
---
Rip... guess we will only get the shitty piper one
---
Pain in the ass when you have to actually pop one into a relay tower or computer
---
Yeah it's really sad. I love this game and the community  but when they make the game unplayable it ruins the experience
---
Accidental attention to detail lmao
---
Doubt we’ll see any major initial improvements, besides that the game will run at optimal graphic setting easily. Xbox has made it sound like the Xbox series X will be on the same servers as their previous game. I forget how they worded it, but this next gen is an upgrade of backwards compatibility. So theoretically everything’s the same. It just looks better.
---
Really.
---
lol i got lucky and found her next to the nuka cola planet while i was doing the wastelanders quest, didn't know she was difficult to get at the time
---
Aye. it seems like there's a good scavenger trader (rare outfits) and then there's one that either has all bow plans or one that has loads of recipes for drugs.
---
it's the rads: short term memory loss.
---
Yeah I just plopped 100\*1.1\^3 into my calculator to see what percentage it should be if it worked that way, great to have it confirmed in-game, thanks! This also means that, assuming it's consistent having all 3 cards at max ranks grants 72.8% instead of 60% which kind of puts explosives at an even worse disadvantage.
---
In case you have them available could you do a test with consumables? Would be interesting as well and I can't really play right now. (might do a test for melee with meats later though)
---
EDIT: Didn't see the edit before replying, that sounds promising but a test would still be good
---
Actually not that uncommon, at least it was quite common a few years ago. Nowadays games just embed the chromium framework for ui, which is much more reasonable... Right?
---
I think they need events where monsters are getting out of control. 
---
Like what if Supermutants started roaming Appalachia in an attempt to ride it of humans and scorched? You start seeing more and more groups of Supermutants roaming the wastelands? Attacking players camps. And it ends in an event were you and everyone on your server raid a big supermutant camp?
---
What if it's breeding season for Deathclaws, and it drives them into a frenzy, similar to what I just described?
---
The scorch are making a big comeback. Foundation and Crater is being infected and we need to help a side fight back the infection, which leads to going underground through a fissure, and fighting a new even deadlier queen?
---
A giant hoard of feral ghouls is heading towards Appalachia, we need to prepare. We need to go from hotspot to hotspot putting down the FGs.
---
Fallout 1 and 2 BoS were PoS, and as someone's already pointed out, that was a different Maxson than who was alive by 2103, though I still hold my worries
---
This has come up time and time again and Bethesda hasn't ever addressed it. I doubt it will change at this point. They ignore player feedback.
---
The only time it makes sense to do this is if:
---
- A: You have nothing available to sell yourself. 
---
- B: You have very limited time and want to get some extra caps during that particular 20 hour refresh cycle. 
---
Unless both are true, then it’s definitely a trap and a waste.
---
Pretty sure they stopped using scaleform after fo4. I think 76 uses some hodge podge in Air.
---
There's probably lots of reasons they can't do this honestly... I mean just look at regular patches and how adding or changing one thing breaks so many other things. I doubt that many of these camp restrictions are as simple as flipping a switch and each restriction is likely tied to a host of risks and problems if not requiring a complete rewrite in order to even do it.  
---
Not that I disagree about having less restrictions, just disagreeing that there aren't "no reasons" and many of them are likely technical.
---
The basic fundamentals of the game aren't really set up for a lasting end game at this point. Expansions and new content are normally driven by equipment, which is driven by need for new equipment, which isn't there. It doesn't help since there is only one complete, fleshed out build that is so above everything else they can't balance the game around it since it everyone who doesn't follow it would be left in the dust. Basically everything is kind of a mess and it would take quite a redesign to make it where they could have the progression that drives this type of game.
---
Meow
---
Pvp in the destiny series has always been a massive part of the game and community. I noticed how you didn't enjoy the exotic quests because they incorporated pvp elements, the whole point of thay is to make you work for them. Sometimes you need to step outside of your comfort zone to achieve what you want.
---
Oh does Steam account do so? Well i would contact support too, but it would take awhile i guess, so i thought there is someone on reddit. Thanks!
---
*flair checks out lolmao*
---
or perhaps Ward is becoming self aware.
---
scary thought.
---
Aye. i remember finding the responder vendor bot in the very early days of the game and not buying anything. Shortly after i found out some of the apparel is rare and worth loads (it was at the time)
---
That probably makes the most sense. The bigger problem will be that the devs will likely do most testing on the newest best systems just like all their internal testing was likely done on sparsely populated or private servers. I would guess me trying to run it on my XB1 S should be fine for the first few months but about a year later will be nearly unplayable.
---
Lmao the world is full
---
Yeah it's a shame flux has gone up so much. Up till wastelanders about it was usually under 150, commonly could find it for 100.
---
Now at 200+ it's like, nope I'll just farm it myself.
---
Legendary stuff went the other way. Used to be 20 caps per scrip for trash legendary items, now it's about 7 per scrip unless it's godroll. Even non legacy godroll stuff took a big hit.
---
Only if the last effect is 25% Less VATS cost. Even then, did they not change it from zero costs to very little cost? 
---
3rd effect “something while aiming” will probably be 50DR
---
50lbs of ammo? Dude run bandilor haha
---
The helmets are an easy source of caps if you got the recipe, but he is level 30 - super duper is a level 50 card (52 for rank 3)
---
So useful information, maybe now i'm alright! I gotta spend all atoms! Thanks!
---
Confirmed still works. Just have to accept the mission and talk to him again.
---
This is the sole reason why I grinder the fusion generator plans at level 10 lol. Now I have 6 small purifiers and a lead resource extractor.
---
I prefer to sing "butt, butt fuck it!"
---
I believe since it's a 48 hour stream that segments in different time slots feature streamers and content creators from different parts of the world, in this case I believe they're part of the Australian stream.
---
&gt;No idea why a simple hand pump gives me radiation just for collecting water, even when wearing a hazmat suit.
---
The handpump only gives you radiation if you drink from it. If you use the collect option you get a unit of Dirty Water in your inventory that you can boil as normal.
---
If you can get the treasure hunter outfit plan you can make them for cloth and oil, then sell them for 29 caps. That’s my go to for clearing out vendors.
---
(Marine tactical helmets are also good but require more materials to make, and in my experience rubber is hard to find.)
---
What *is* a water powered bone saw, anyway?
---
We need to retire the term game breaking, because everyone uses it to describe whatever bug they are most unhappy about. It's lots meaning.
---
And no. I have no uptake in lag since the last update.
---
But if we stop to address this it will definitely never happen. Why give up to give feedback, complain and ask for improvements?
---
Yea i looked your right I only seen the Torso no limbs
---
You can probably get a legacy trade out of it
---
Talk about coincidences, was reading this and first secret  service chest piece I've ever built right now is unyielding with 20% weapon weight red, ap point refresh 😅😅 Sorry mate
---
We desperately need things where the recommended level is higher than 50. I'm talking about true end game zones and raids where everything hits like a truck and having the best gear/build is a must. We need new enemy types, new legendary effects or massive buffs to existing ones to where junkies/bloodied aren't the only super OP ones, things like that. Give us a completely new area that's locked until you hit 100 at least.
---
I’m not a fan of PvP in fallout, I keep forgetting that workshops are pvp point and was pointedly reminded of that a few days ago. Now I only take workshops and never try to hold them, but this one I was working on the daily build challenge experimenting with some camp building concepts. In comes a stealth player and hammers me with a BE 50.cal, I don’t usually retaliate, but I was heated decides to seek revenge, gets obliterated one more time, goes back in a second time and the lil fuck joins my public team so I can PvP him and has the audacity to wave and sends me heart emoji, got all my junk back but he took my fluxes!
---
The 300 penitentiary and mama dolce keys. Must be 600 steel ;)
---
Still a problem today on xbox. And he's never in bed. Always awake and at his desk just doesn't want to talk.
---
cooked gives even more caps
---
Not sure what the design criteria has been for wall displays. If something can be assigned it should display. As of patch 21 it just disappears. The flamer is another heavy that used to be a wall board display option but I haven't test it since the last update.
---
idk if you're using a custom ini file but I do and recently I've also been CTD a lot
---
I've found verifying the game files on steam usually helps it for a little while at least
---
I also have mods installed and written into my custom ini so I have a separate clean ini I swap with that one when I play nuclear winter for the daily challenge since it won't start if mods are detected
---
I think? I've been able to tie these two together that after I've swapped then re-swapped it causes more CTD but not 100% on that but verifying game files always fixes it until I swap again
---
It's JUMPING here. There's 5 people queued to get served
---
Stop complaining about people complaining about things you like. Start advocating for the thing everybody says they hate that you like to be treated better and maybe have a fair treatment to the main mode you don't think as highly of as the mode you like.
---
Nice! Glad we made it, always nice to have more clothing items.
---
Yah, it’s hard to say. If Bethesda follows their usual model and they decide this game is worth as much as eso, they may start moving more ppl to the project soon which could double or triple the improvements of the game. They’re using a small team that has the least experience with their game engine. There’s no way the devs aren’t struggling just to do their job.
---
AH! Still. Even without super duper it's still a great sauce of caps.
---
If they weren't there there would be nothing for you to catch up with.  While I kinda hate the score pass overall, I think it needs more NW not less.
---
Once more we need to talk about the elephant in the room here.  If you are using private servers to transfer stuff between characters, the you are using a work around.  And a work around should not even be necessary.  The fact that it's even necessary is ridiculous.
---
  I did not expect this to catch so much attention XD. I must say tho this is the most kindest opposition I’ve ever had on Reddit, this is way I love this community.
---
good to know! thanks for the quick check.
---
If it’s on Xbox I will take it from you
---
If you have a camera you can scan the area with it... When the corpse comes into the cameras field of view you should see "Scorched Beast" on the top corner of the screen. Although sometimes they just vanish
---
&gt; they would use exploits to start PVP and take it
---
  Contesting a workshop is not an exploit......
---
you'll know what it is if you ever need it :)
---
Easier just to find low levels in the wasteland and gift the items to them. At least then u know that won’t be bought up by a greedy mid-high level, marked up and sold.
---
Oh, I'm *real* sick, Vault Dweller . . . ***LuMbAgO***
---
Big fan of wearing outfits over armor in 76. It’s one of the only mods I use in 4.
---
They should just add in a banking system for everything.  Daily progress stacks for 3 or more days.  Would make the game much less annoying.
---
First: the fact that progress can't even be tracked in-game is bogus.
---
Second: I wish people weren't completing this ... sorry excuse for an "event".
---
At least Marcy has a reason to be angry, what with being grief stricken. Sheng Kowalski's the worst hands down
---
Can’t agree more, I will stick around to see if Bethesda fix their problems. I hope so Atleast. Can’t expect much great unfortunately following their following patches.
---
I missed the first few weeks and am in the mid 50s. Thought I was catching up until I lost the majority of the weeklies to autocomplete.
---
Bethesda fix something. And not just one thing but lots?
---
Hahahahahahahhahahahaahah
---
I’ll give you a explosive bow I think I have vampires and something else for it if you’re on Xbox that is
---
I buy flux every time I find it if it’s not ridiculously priced, 5mm, 50 cal, 308, 2mm EC, and everyone’s fav 5.56 .. I literally can’t find people selling enough ammo when I have lots of extra caps but while I’m vendor hopping I find a crocolous bp or fixer plan for like 5k and buy those lol
---
&gt; This game is not a PVP game though
---
76 has been a “pvp game“ since release whether some in this sub choose to live in denial or not.
---
Hi, thanks for the report. 
---
Which type of armor is this affecting? Secret Service still, or another type?
---
Dungeon crawls. With weeks worth of drops and you must complete dungeons for X items which would allow for other dungeon type access. Dungeons would get progressively harder until everyone bitched about them so they drop the idea and revert back to the humdrum until people are bored with that so back we go this time it would be raid 2.0 though.   
---
Endgame would cause an actual power creep to happen and man the people that would piss moan and whine if all the sudden there was level 75 items and their precious legacies were garbage. As it is now the game is a open world do as you please with 1 about to be 2 world bosses everything else is story and explore.   
---
Though if it is a true challenge you want we should have a hardcore/ironman mode but with a twist no artificial level cap you can max perks to 15 on each also with ladder for each platform. Though I bet it would be low pop since the casuals would not enjoy it.
---
I noticed I lag when I change weapons, as well as constant crashing at certain points.
---
And here I am stuck at work :(

This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
Yeah but I stopped playing the game entirely because I was tired of having to be dragged kicking and screaming by my clanmates to do the fucking thing because we HAD TO OR ELSE. 
---
Wanna get a gun you enjoy? PVP. Want to progress in the story? PVP. Not even a PVP mode you can function in, no, the hard, painful, piintless ones that had no bearing on the actual plot, it was doing it to do it.
---
Now I want nothing to do with Destiny because of what the modes put me through to do fucking anything of progress in that game. If I had the choice to do it again, I would not.
---
Is that the endgame of Fallout 76? I hope not.
---
I came to say this.
---
No matter how many times you cancel that stupid quest she still says it fml
---
&gt; because it is not real pvp for one
---
 lol care to expand on that?
---
SHUSH your dirty mouth, or we will get them in the atom shop only.
---
Does it gain damage from two handed perks?
---
Is it directly off the road and do you know of it's towards west tek or the opposite way?
---
Sometimes the corpse will follow you if you fast travel to Watoga train station.
---
I sell 3 star weapons of any kind for 350, lower star bloodied/junkie for 250.  Thought I was being cheap hah.
---
Okay it's a bit better. But it is still a puzzle. For example I now have 270 fusion cell and I want to lose it. In the menu I get this. 
---
sell 1x +6 points for -30 cells  
---
sell 10x +600 points for -300 cells  
---
So in order to best deal with this, 30 cells need to be added.  I go for the sell 1x it takes too long, but thats not the only bullets i got.
---
Agreed, I only do it on private servers now
---
The few times I’ve had a crash or other issue while taking a workshop is offset by the fact that in most cases I get uncontested ownership of some of the better workshops whenever I want (name Hemlock Holes Mainteance, Grafton Steel, and the Munitions Factory)
---
Watch where the body falls and then go to that place.
---
Honestly. The spawn rate for the trader is really high here.
---
They did originally advertise the private world workshops to be persistent though.
---
(More specifically said they'd add it some 10 months ago from what I remember)
---
It turns out the prydwen was made from steel scraps that vault 76ers collected. Just watch them add that lore to the game 😜
---
You would still normally have to retake them I think. Just that anything you built there should have remained
---
&gt; PVP is not at the core of what Fallout is
---
Online multiplayer was not at “the core of what Fallout is”, until it was...
---
It exists.  I feel dirty for duping it lol, I'm going to trade for a normal set of scout and delete  the duped one to do it  the legit way.
---
Same, except shotguns and some heavy guns
---
Two Shot accuracy is just so horrible.
---
Just don't do it?  I'm rank 82 and have done maybe 2 of the NW challenges... you don't have to do them at all.
---
Not to mention the one in the basement of the Flatwoods Agri center with the knife and the skeletons head in a bowl. That was the first one I ever came across and always loved it.
---
Then why is there a pacifist switch in Adventure mode if PVP is SUCH an integral part of the game?
---
PVP does not belong in Fallout, that's why.
---
He likes to talk about you and your guts. And your help.
---
This is definitely not the case... I transferred a ton of stuff yesterday and it worked fine for me.
---
Bethesda said they were looking into implementing double walls and a few other objects to restore camp building to the same quality
---
This happens to me with the Raider at Ohio river ventures when i am trying to turn in Mirelock meat.
---
It wont fit on top of my deathclaw head so it'll sit in my stash just like the fashnaut beret. Hopefully I can fit the BoS banner from the next tier inside an outhouse though.
---
Lol pacifist switch in Adventure mode disagrees.
---
Don't forget that Seasons will be an ongoing thing, so maybe we'll always have the opportunity to earn them with whatever will be the season's reward mechanic.
---
Hi, thanks for the report and sorry for the trouble with your Atom reward.
---
You mentioned five or six other challenges also haven't awarded Atoms after completing them. Couple of questions for you:
---
* Which other challenges are doing this?
---
* Are the challenges showing as fully completed in the challenge menu? Or are they not registering when you've met the requirements?
---
Need to check my character for Todd.
---
WTB Todd cures.
---
Or...there could be another Adventure mode challenge, ya know, since Legendary Run doesnt really benefit PVP, and PVP should get it's own benefits so people there can feel like they get something out of it.

Soon as I get the last 4 levels I’m going to play a different game... Possibly only get on to see what’s new in the atomic shop weekly. This run burned me out on 76, I wanna go play god of war on the hardest difficulty. Because that is far less painful than having to do another goddamn match of nuclear winter.

Hmm, maybe just the new FO76-only UI elements are in Air?

Yep

Don’t forget the Grafton Monster, which normally respawns if you fast travel from the Workshop to the Golf Club.

imo some of their ideas are great it's just the execution that's terrible like in this patch they promised a lot of great things couldn't make them in time and botched the patch
---
you will be glad you have them when there is another nuclear war and in the new fallout-fallout game, bunker keycards are the new caps.  
---
you will live like a king.
---
I appreciate your community spirit!
---
I'm a rifleman and felt the damage seemed off.  Seems like some of the enemies have legendary perks that are better than senderpity too.
---
And they do it even after they don't play anymore... OP.
---
Every day, for dailies yes.  A hour maybe?
---
I did play a lot during double XP weekend, but i'm pretty burned out so I don't play much anymore.
---
Even without double XP weekend I'd guess I would be around 70 just from dailies.
---
I do run a very high INT Unyielding build so maybe it's boosted some by the XP score, but still I don't think anyone needs the NW challenge... especially since they added more challenges daily a week or two into the season.
---
How do you actually claim it?
---
Inexcusable.. And yet, at the same time, completely understandable, sadly. The engine is giant patchwork quilt of a mess, and their servers and netcode don't help anything either.
---
I'm sure it was a gag but the other day I saw someone selling stingwing barbs and I think tick blood sacs or something like that for 30k a pop
---
Right. I was on my own oblivion.
---
Is it Junkie? Stalker? Instigating?  Or does it have +33% vats hit? +50% limb damage? +40% bashing damage? Or are you wearing a +15% in reduced damage from blocking armor piece?   
---
If you have any single one of those on a heavy or any shotgun or splitter laser flechette harpoon in VATS you have magic.   
---
Like to note if you have a TS anything and the +15% block armor it is magic in VATS the majority of time.
---
I don't use it most of the time as I really don't notice the negatives at all when using unyielding but I do have space in my build if I really need it as I could swap bloody mess for it The 15% dmg are really not needed most of the time, at least for melee (depending on the mutations I will get more melee dmg from class freak) but I like having it to bolster my rifle secondaries as I don't have the cards at max rank.
---
Why would you need a pacifist switch if there wasn’t pvp...
---
It's too bad it can't be turned to scrap, the Brotherhood could use it.
---
I agree, i think if they promise things and they deliver it without botching it, fix all the performance issues and I think the game would be one of the better fallouts. But right now I don’t know what to make of it at the moment.
---
I'm a big fan of the destiny games, the weapons that involve pvp to get are, wait for it. PVP ORIENTED. That means that they were designed with pvp in mind and just so happen to be decent in pve. I'm starting to get the feeling that you didn't play much destiny as Pvp had no influence on the story.
---
I too am interested. Having recently acquired the recipe for formula P, I was wondering if I should actually just start making a whole load of them to sell
---
Yup. Extra places to stash caps and re run the first responders missions for a chance at rare outfits.
---
Yes it seems to happen when doing the Line in the Sand quest
---
Keep it. You literally have the best bloodied commando weapon, get rid of all your other weapons and use the BE fixer
---
Seriously, the only way it could be slightly better if it was FFR with 25LVC
---
Haven’t the foggiest.
---
I'll stop using my Tesla when others play nice and let others get hits on all the mobs lol.
---
But seriously what makes you think that Teslas are the issue?
---
They have a higher base damage. They lend themselves more to a sneak build.
---
GOD YES. I KNOW I have ALL the KEYS but sometimes you pick them up anyway, out of habit... now I Have soooooo many of every damn key in the game, ugh
---
I’ll have to stop by there more often. wish i had more reasons to go south of watoga. Everyone on my servers have been nuking the savage divide lately to spite Bethesda
---
Yes, but with equal rolls not by much.
---
That would be a perfect spot for a hat.
---
Damn that dude nuked your house on purpose... Usually building in Whitesprings means getting your house nuked is part of the cons of living there... But if you look at that red circle, he dropped it right on top of your house, missing half of whitesprings and the important part, the golf club. 
---
Whoever did this most likely didn’t like your vendor prices or something.
---
I like them better, yes.
---
Bethesda should stop aiming for player retention and start making a game.
---
I’ve been selling formula P at 100c and selling out.   I know that’s not a fair price, but until I get someone to do some foraging for supplies with me, that’s what the time to get the stuff is worth to me.
---
He told tou, A S H  P I L E S
---
Atlas provisions having them is hilarious. We're the BoS, we collect technology. Here have some tomahawk plans.
---
Never seen any problems in my events.
---
Ha! no it's a network issue. though gaming over wifi can be problematic I would try these measures first. What you want to do is to get both of your consoles to use a different lane on the highway so to speak. I am assuming that your consoles are fighting over how they are connecting to the game. There could be other factors though. like a Firewall, or isp provided security tools. I can't 100% say without being able to see for myself. Also I am sure that someone else can explain it better than me. Maybe someone will chime in.
---
There are quite a few videos on youtube, and a few different methods. My info may be out of date. (1) The easiest way is to open your xbox settings /network/advance settings/ enable alternate port (may be called alternate multiplayer port or some variation. you can do this on one or both consoles, but try it one at a time. you don't want to fix what isn't broken. (2) Another Method is to log into your router and set up real port forwarding. For that I direct you to google for instruction. Method 1 worked for me. terms you can search regarding either method would be "xbox double nat" "xbox port forwarding" "xbox alternate port" I hope this helps.
---
Yes!! Why is no one talking about this :(!!! Its making my build almost useless T_T
---
I didn't ask what was the issue I was asking why he thinks that is the issue.  Correlation does not equal causation.
---
Tips? Once it finishes installing hit that button to Uninstall it and save yourself the time. 
---
Also next tip, if you don't follow tip 1 be prepared to be disappointed. A LOT. 
---
The community makes the game, the rest is quiet shit honestly. Fo76 is the bastard step child in bethesdas eyes and we get scraps. Ot shows in the quality of....everything.
---
Look up nukacrypt it's easier 😂
---
I'm not uninstalling but I have stopped playing, and cancelled my 1st subscription. I won't spend a dime on this game, on atoms or the 1st sub, until the daily scrip limit is lifted or made weekly. It's obviously a small thing, a huge company doesn't care about one person. But the truth is Bethesda has gotten a LOT of money out of me on this game. No more until they stop with the time-gating bullshit. I do not want to play every day for 45 minutes. I want to play just once or twice a week for longer periods, but I will not if I hit all the limits in a short amount of time.
---
Nice one bud!
---
Dang I sell these for like 20c each.
---
Hello, thanks for replying. Of the top of my head, I can't remember the other few challenges, but the one I did yesterday was the "collect issues of Blackwoodsman". It shows completed and I do remember the other ones completed as well, just didn't reward any atoms.
---
 A few times this happened: instead of showing a total of my atoms, it briefly showed the completed challenge ONLY atoms, instead of the total (previous atoms + challenge ones) and then reverted back to the pre-challenge amount. Hope that helps in some way, I did see various posts on the subreddit on this subject in the last weeks as well.
---
Didn't know that was a thing thank you for the help.
---
I use an explosive Tesla shotgun just for this event and I get some lag but it’s still “playable”.
---
All of this I mostly knew and agreed with, but i did not know lb rb did that and now i feel dumb. Thank you for adding that part in amd making my life that much easier.
---
I genuinely think if they just ended up being in the atom store that would kind of ruin why they work so well. You do need enough people to have them for there to be that spirit of sharing that I'm really digging here, and I just don't think you'd get them if they were on the atom shop.
---
Hi, I don't know if other armor types have this problem too, but wood ghillie covers your screen. Same problem while holding fixer/radium/combat rifle and possible other weapons
---
Just get Beckett... put the bar outside he shoots like 90% of stuff and uses way less budget
---
Yes, just don't dump your load on the same server. Roll a few out see what the prefix is 5 is best if no prefixes you want hop servers try again.
---
IMO handmades are easier to control when using everywhere besides VATS. Fixers are better in VATS. The sneak buff of the fixer really isnt useful if you're already running a sneak build, or have high agility + any sneak perk/sneak armor
---
. Following for answers
---
Beth obviously has a SCORE figure in mind that they want people to hit daily/weekly. Just cap it and make it achievable through either adventure or NW. because frankly it would be nice to have that option. Adventure is a stultifying garbage grind and I don't want to engage with it. There's no reason not let NW players progress on SCORE along with all the flower pickers.
---
I fully plan on substantially lowering my price once I get a better supply chain.    The kaliadospore is a pain to get, especially since I can’t do arktos by myself, so getting supplies requires me to reek of failure as well as time spent lol
---
Where’s my bag of holding at
---
For stealth builds fixer is better. The passive stealth bonuses are game changing.
---
For raw damage the handmade is better.
---
I also hear quite a bit from other players the Handmade is also preferred for it's "feel" and performance while firing but I personally like them equally in this regard even though they do feel very different when firing them.
---
I want the cork reward but sure as shit don’t care about the other two.
---
Fixers do have significantly more recoil, which doesn't lend itself to hip firing.
---
I'm just speculating from others posts and problems it seems.
---
But I've noticed plasma piles and ash piles tend to slow frame rates down in mobs.
---
I'll second or third or whatever on the ash piles.  The group I play with have tested this.  If anyone used an energy weapon we all lag as the ash piles appear.  If everyone uses ballistic or melee, we have no problems.
---
best write up i have seen about it.
---
 [https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/](https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/)
---
&gt; They did originally advertise the private world workshops to be persistent though. 
---
Nope. They at best indicated it may be or was planned to be a future feature but it was very clear from the original announcement that private world's weren't persistent from the onset.
---
Oh.. I dun know... perhaps.. just perhaps and maybe they could.... like... use it to blow a big fraggin hole into Foundation and turn it into Crater II ? 
---
But then again..... that might be just my drunken self speaking. Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain of alcohole-fumes
---
Telsas are much better now, after the patch (one of the only things that the patch fixed).
---
That’s tough man.
---
STO has an exchange where you can freely sell in game currency to other players for cash-store currency. Not quite the same but provides an avenue to generate free cash-store currency very quickly and easily.
---
Tents are useful in Queen fights though, keeps the small mobs from hitting you. And it’s already been proven that standing on fences and tents do NOT obstruct the queens path, so if anything tents are nothing but a benefit during a Queen fight.
---
I've noticed it at events with ONLY meat piles that I was doing solo.  It's not just ash piles you can have only meat piles and have the same issues.  I'd argue that ash piles cause less frame and lag issues because there are no buzzing fly effects.
---
Radiation rumble takes me down to like 5 FPS lmao
---
Same
---
I’ve seen a large number of people start canceling FO1st subscriptions, so at least it’s going somewhere.
---
The only other weapon I can use to get hits on several enemies at once is my AGL, which might not go over too well.
---
That's true, we do get a decent amount from that and hopefully that carries forward to future seasons.
---
magazines can spawn in the 2 separate shacks. On a chair and under a couch. A bobblehead can spawn in the shack with the stood up petrified corpse (behind it in a box) and a bobblehead can spawn on the roof in the blue box where the chairs are. And a rare-ish plan can spawn in the "room" near the workbench.
---
They are just showing off. It's not going live, unfortunately
---
We're investigating all these reports with the appropriate teams right now. Currently, we don't need any more information for these investigations but if we end up needing more info I will reach out. We'll let you know when we have an update on this!
---
Oh yay.....I really wish there was a way to convey sarcasm.
---
Quite the contrary. I understand how Bethesda keep doing everything wrong. Having faith in them having the competence to have implemented a threat system is actually laughable.
---
This event is a lot of fun but it is terrible for people one shotting stuff. I always want to participate but I always end up with people who don’t try to help out playing music and if I do try to play a bit, I end up missing all the legendaries because people one shot them. It’s still a lot of fun though, love watching the ghoulies spawn by the dozen!
---
By the Fire Station? On the steel deposit? I've made some of my favorite builds there.
---

 &gt; We're investigating all these reports with the appropriate teams right now. Currently, we don't need any more information for these investigations but...
---
If it says "take photos in the ash heap" then it's literally anywhere in the ash heap. Just stand there and take x-number of photos til it pops.
---
I think they’re bugged, I’ve taken photos all over the forest and toxic valley and neither counter has gone up at all.
---
You get floaters as rewards (Why?,I don’t know?). So do NOT buy them. 
---
In my opinion grenades are a waste of time. That’s why I leave it on the Fireworks..... Why you ask????
---
If you equip/unequip fireworks your gun will reload hella fast. Super easy and way better than any blast radius.
---
My BFFR auto 10mm disagrees that pistols are slow 😁
---
🙈🙉🙊 is the response you will get from Bethesda.  Hell they wont even back down from the building Nerf.  They just apologize and hope we forget about it
---
This is the first game I don't use any type of grenade.
---
I find them clunky to use and not very good to be honest.
---
Other than in Nuclear winter in which I prefer the nuka grenade for its radius.
---
Thanks for this info it’s helped me. I use a J3325 fixer same build as you stealth commando. I don’t have many mutations, I have speed demon carnivore grounded and healing factor. I have enough space to use class freak also so which others would recommend? Thanks
---
Never said it was. Read the whole conversation first
---
I'm currently level 536 - I sell all my plans for 1 cap each &amp; have given away more weapons than I care to count.
---
Get stabilized arms and there's no recoil at all
---
If this is the challenge for atoms, they will complete with no additional notice since how we acquire atoms is changed because of the legendary run.
---
Workshops should always be shared if the taker had pacifist enabled. No kill zone.
---
What about the fall damage?
---
Ward is VR Todd Howard.  It just works.
---
It will be in the atom shop for sale after the close of the steel deposits. Only 250 atoms. /s
---
If it's the one where it's asking you take take 20 photo mode pics, you can take them anywhere in three Ash Heap, as long as there's no specific list attached to the challenge
---
Isn’t there a cork upgrade for combat armor? I imagine that would be where some of it goes since combat armor is the Brotherhood’s bread and butter.
---
There's a couple keywords I can't remember off the top of my head that can spawn 100's of multiples.  Like the corpses you find them on used to be bugged.
---
As I told you, we had 400 limits back days and most people still managed to play. Of course you can hoard millions steel, wood, or 8644 legendaries to collect dust, but then, pay for the extra storage. If nobody whined about the limit and play the game as it should (stash managment), they never had the idea to charge for more stash space. If you are a greedy hoarder, it is no wonder the developers will be greedy too.
---
Before I started to be a 1st member, I was able to keep my stash below 600. Now it is at 150-200 (depends how many ammo I sell from killing). But finaly I can hoard thousands of scraps. But I do not know when I'll use 100k steel, or 20k fertelizer, or 9k corks...
---
Natively without mods?
---
I have a 3 star assassins rolling pin I always wanted to do a build around as a angry chef hitting low level players. Lol. Never got around to it though.
---
There is a reason I added the part of it more specifically being said to be added. I just mean that it's sad that they first made it sound like it was going to be a future feature but have removed any indication of that now.
---
I got mine from the dailies dude at Foundation that can't use a chair properly, I forget his name.
---
Yeah, it was the industry standard for UI middleware back in the Unreal Engine 3 era. Its not something you can just yank out of an existing game-engine without putting in a lot of work either.
---
(Also, I want to add that I have no issues with the SCORE board performance, but I'm on a decent PC rig. Scaleform traditionally leans a lot on single-threaded CPU performance. So not so great for consoles or lower spec pc's.)
---
What was wrong with them before?
---
If you're logging in for the reason most people log in daily i.e. clearing out dailies, you already from that alone pick up more than enough to get the 1400 cap max.
---
The only advantage is that it's quick IF you find a camp selling them at that price really quickly. Otherwise the search for those camps also is a waste of time.
---
And if that didn't apply and you truly were strapped, purified water is a better investment than serums.
---
I cannot see a way that serums makes any sense other than in a post-rationalisation trying to justify taking a bad option.
---
People suspect it’s related to meat piles. Specifically, they are the source of the lag, which is why you see it at Line in the Sand and the SBQ fight, where those things just pile up.
---
Scrip is the biggest offender in my opinion.
---
It locks down the real end game loop for most people.  Trying to roll new bullion pieces, being saddled with useless legendaries, buying legendary modules.  Upping it to 400 would be nice.  That's 10 three star weapons per day.
---
There was a bug that using a tesla (particularly with the automatic receiver), would cause all your damage to go to ZERO.
---
at this point I'm like screw it just sell me the damn legendaries in the atom shop and let me pick what I want
---
everybody gets a BE2525 fixer and we can finally all stop complaining
---
You unlock the ability to craft them after you scrap your first assaultron head I thought. 
---
They aren’t rare it’s just no one makes them usually.
---
SBQ targets melee attackers first
---
I can't speak for any other dealers out there but I'll sell mine for half the listed in-game price.
---
i mean i get what you are saying for vault 76 and vault 79, but it doesn’t make too much sense for other vaults in my opinion
---
Thank you. I didnt see that
---
By the train station. I like it there because it was easy to take the power plant and junkyard workshops plus easy to get scrip and sell stuff. I only moved to make it faster to do my faction dailies. But her voice certainly played a role too.
---
Yea, but lag only apples to the legendary run for me, god knows why ig
---
Well I’ve scrapped an assaultron head before and haven’t been able to craft it
---
I’m gonna focus on another event on another game, then when that’s done I’ll probably attempt to finish my “Show me God Of War” playthrough, hardest difficulty on God Of War 4. 
---
(I spent three hours in that one fight after the bridge fell... So this’ll be painful... Not as painful as being forced to play that god awful nuclear winter game mode every day though. Just left the “Witch’s house” is how far I got.)
---
Isn't the kalia-whatever plant always available where Project Paradise goes on even when the event isn't happening? I swear I saw that somewhere.
---
Why fix the emitter or uranium collectors when you are only focused on killing the legendary.  I gave up on tagging legendaries.  I just do the objectives and let everyone else frenzie around the legendary enemy now
---
I think the long waits are due to people are no longer going for the "hidden" rewards. Hidden being the old Halloween and Christmas rewards. They were removed, so now less people are playing NW.
---
Easy.
---
Step 1: Throw it to the ground.  
---
Step 2: Turn around  
---
Step 3: Count to 10  
---
Step 4: Turn back around
---
If it's gone .. it's **\*MAGIC\***
---
This sub is always angry and upset.  100 to 1 is the ratio of negative posts about this game vs positive posts.  Positive posts are typically besieged with negative replies if it paints this game with the slightest bright spot.  That’s why some folks respond with “don’t let the door go up your crack on the way out.”
---
I like grenades for luring mobs out of buildings and clearing rooftops. I know about the firework "bug/feature", but reload speed isn't really an issue for me.
---
Dude, mine sell at 150cp even. I wouldn’t dream going lower than 100cp considering that you can only get the ingredients by participating in Project Paradise. And even then it’s quite the runaround to collect the rest of the ingredients.
---
I used to use grenades a lot and I would deal exclusively with Nuka Grenades. The only draw back was the radiation damage that I had to deal with. I tried the Quantum but they didn't have the same blast radius even with the appropriate perks. I would use plasma when I got them dropped but I didn't want to switch so many perk cards out in order to make them myself. I bought two of the floater grenades but they had a worse blast radius and didn't seem to do much damage.
---
tl;dr I would stick with the nuka grenades.
---
You can harvest the kaleidopore at any time down there.  The event doesn’t need to be active.
---
Think we already got our quakecon apparel, the backpack and the goat mask, not quite as cool as the elder coat but they were free this year so theres that.
---
Is that's why no one would buy the one I'm trying to sell? It's a bloody FFR so I thought it would go quick but I've had it over a month now
---
MIRV grenades are excellent against robots - other than that, I find pretty much all grenades to be useless.
---
Weird flex post, but ok...
---
I can see that, the hand made just feels like a fun gun, to me at least.
---
Maybe, instead of blaming the devs, have you considered that NO ONE IS PLAYING NW RIGHT NOW.
---
Bethesda isnt at fault on everything
---
It comes from the realisation that caps are pretty much pointless, there is no point to accruing large amounts, as then you're stuck at the max limit, forced to buy random crap you don't need just to get rid...
---
I sell everything cheap or just give stuff away, leave plans and legendary gear in train stations all the time...
---
Even worse, doors and walls/windows seem to be different things. I have no idea why they did that but it screws up my building techniques.
---
Haha grinding is my middle name
---
Pretty sure that would be the cause - it should sell for bank now.
---
I got the auto complete bug now I’m behind by an ass ton
---
It was also the rewards from May too.
---
Building up your camp knowing that other players can come see it and buy your wares is so good I'd be sad to go back to an offline only system for building in future.
---
Currently you get the Mr. Demonic Backpack and the Beelzebilly outfit for free! [Bethesda ITV Aug 6th!](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7ck87LOpAKn6x3pVy5OPBZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-august-2020-updates) edit: typos
---
Definitely, just having a plain and simple system where you deposit the Ammo straight from your inventory into the (currently pointless) section and then via the terminal you can convert all of that into points
---
If they put these in the Atomic Shop I bet they would sell very well.
---
You force yourself to play for a Lame 250 score credit. And then complain about it. 
---
Hmmm... I’m starting to question your Sanity. 
---
..... I also hate THE IDEA of a NW in (A Fallout Game) and have NEVER PLAYED IT. 
---
I would never waste my time with that. 250 score points please. I haven’t done it once and I’m almost to level 70. Remember that this season ends sometime in September. Don’t do it to yourself for 250 points. Stay Sane Bro.
---
Because this is Bethesda, and when they build that god awful Fortnite clone they likely couldn't figure out how to turn it off for one mode and not the other.
---
Ash rose is a pain to find beside lewisburg roof tops
---
I like the Dynamite bundle, i use VATS to shoot it to explode the right time. They are very cheap to craft.
---
Also if you run one silo those codes don’t have to be inputted a second time. It remembers you.
---
Ghoul slayers switchblade in WS golf clubhouse is an amazing thing :)
---
 To your point, I agree - I’m a melee build, but made room for stabilized 3.  Carry a couple different heavies when I take on things that fly.
---
I had this issue right after during Line in the Sand, but I updated my graphics drivers and it stopped.
---
Oh I'm not the only one! I play pretty much on a private server but I've still encountered a lot of lag at times. Sometimes the game has even crashed on me (PS4 of that makes a difference). Though I did encounter something odd yesterday. I tried logging in and it said that something could be loaded in regards to the Bethesda account, and fallout 4 did the same thing when I looked for mods. Maybe it's a server-side issue?
---
They're so close that the difference is mostly negligible in all but some edge cases where that little bit of extra damage MAY make a difference.
---
From my experience with both, they're functionally equivalent. For me it's more a matter of if you tend to VATS or free hand shoot. Fixer for the former, handmade for the latter. However, even that is nitpicky.
---
Go with the best that you can get or afford between the two. Neither will disappoint.
---
You could charge 30k caps in a vending machine and get it. You could ask for 100k caps across multiple characters via direct trade and (eventually) get it.
---
tHeN jUsT mAkE mOrE bOws, lol i’m just kidding i’m a bow user and i wish for the same thing
---
Yes and no, still like my HM better.
---
Have had the same issue on PS4 private servers too.
---
Can only hope. Glad they fixed it for everone that uses them
---
T-51 was still the standard issue at the time. The government had just started introducing T-60 suits when the bombs dropped, and from what I recall from Fallout 4 a member of the BOS says that it took a long time and a lot of effort to make T-60 their standard issue. So it seems likely that T-51 suits would still outnumber T-60s by some margin early after the war. 
---
I’m sure certain places like Washington did see a more generous number of T-60 units, though. Seat of power, and all that!
---
Closest you can get to that it now is being able to pick up the gnomes (junk item), then put them in a display case.
---
Ash Piles have particle effects like meat piles. Unlike meat piles, they don't disappear after being looted. Tesla spammers leave massive blobs of Ash Piles on the field and your only option is to leave if you want your game to behave properly. On top of that, Ash Piles block Meat Piles from being looted. They're kinda dicky to use at the moment. Not saying not to, just helping explain. I definitely understand wanting to tag as many enemies as possible.
---
just 1
---
Wow, that's a gorgeous effect!
---
Two hot fixes later and still no fix wth??
---
Good response, I agree 100%
---
I never craft grenades so for me it's either plasma for general damage or floaters just to get rid of them.
---
Why? If they go let them go? Why do you have to try to compound that upset? You are just adding to the polarisation that you are complaining of. 
---
Surely most people go from love to hate to back to love again and everything in between on this game. 
---
So they are upset today, trying to make a point, it’s not my point but i support their right to make it. Tomorrow it could be me, or you. The number of posts matter as to how “loud” your message is. 
---
Also, there is always going to be more negative posts to positive, it’s the nature of the Reddit beast. Little story : I developed a help desk System at work and it offered to send automated surveys at the close of a call. The big Boss couldn’t understand why the majority of surveys returned were negative, so i told him, who completes a survey with “yes you did your job”, unless it’s outstanding service you don’t respond and it only needs to be slightly bad in order for people to take the time.
---
Ignore the posts that don’t apply to you &amp; try not to be cruel.
---
I was more meaning dump specific types of ammo, not all ammo. Or at least a slider for the amount you're dumping. Anything to lessen the menus and time spent converting the ammo.
---
Yes, it is insane to worry about that 250 score but it seems I am behind everyone on the run.
---
The be fixer is a beast even my heavy build was one shoting almost everything
---
I have 8 ammunition factory machines hidden under the map at my camp.
---
(Bethesda only care about double sides wall so it's OK)
---
Don't waste your time with workshops.
---
It just work.
---
#FINALLY
---
MurderHobo's give this game a bad rap. Getting all bloodied or getting "the magic combo" so you can one-shot everyone/thing... where's the fun?  
---
I am level 189, I play casually since beta, I even copied someone else's idea with the small letters on the vault boy cut out...
---
" U can have loc, lemme get mats"
---
Why are you mentioning the Adventure Mode opt in, when your original argument was for NW, a PvP mode, and completely ignore the old Survival, which was intended as a PvP mode before removal? FO76 has had PvP since beta, so it is a PvP game. You have the choice to PvP or not. Bethesda literally gives you the option to not PvP with the repeatable XP grind. That’s the trade off, an option implemented for players like you! Don’t wanna kill people/ use stimpaks/ place a camp three times in NW? Then go grind Adventure for a couple thousand XP. It’s not hard.
---
We see the posts asking for a change to the daily limit and are raising this with the appropriate teams. Thanks everyone for the feedback!
---
I like to use the Quantum Nuka Grenades if I have them. Other wise Nuka Grenades are fine. I believe they do the most damage. There is a sticky Grenade as well which might be sick. If you’re on PS4 hit me up. I can make most grenades/mines and probably have extra plans for them.
---
ok i’m gonna get a lot of backlash for this, but i actually like the idea, if you have more than 1000 steel in your stash and arent using it, just donate it, plus, it is so easy to get it back
---
What's the damage and blast radius like compared to a Nuka 'nade?
---
But this happens when there are no ash piles.  I did guided meditation on a private with all melee users and we had half a frame per second around the meat piles.
---
I like the name:
---
Brotherhood of Concrete ...
---
could be a nice band name ... 
---
sry, 420.. afk
---
LOL I played from around the early part of Dark Below to stopped during Rise of Iron. Played every day. Spent from Taken King onwards really only doing it for the clanmates I made along the way. It became a dreadful prospect towards the end.

What's that?  You getting joy out of this?
---
Todd!  Todd!  Over here!  We've got another one you can crush!
---
Update to disable in 3.... 2.... 
---
(Kidding - it looks beautiful)
---
I agree. If it were to have the initial design, it would be nice to be able to 'sell all' of a type if ammo instead of a bit at a time, over and over.
---
I’m rank 30, and the ‘tactic’ of hiding in bushes took me 2 hours to fully level up. And thats no exaggeration, I was on a call with some friends and told them ‘I just need to rank up, I’ll be with you guys shortly’. I was not with them shortly, they timed it. Some of us just dont have the experience to be getting XP in other ways, not to mention the awful frame rate drops when you go into the hotbar, look in the direction of more than 5 entities, or are subject to fire/explosions.
---
Why do you say run into the fire when you’re amongst final combatants? Does xp gain drop after the bulk of participants die off?
---
What is your twitch?
---
That sounds like a lot more than "never."
---
Before patch 21 it was very consistent 2 to 3 minutes to load, but maybe all the NW players are now collecting scrap for the BOS and not playing NW.
---
VATS is the only way to effectively use mines. They explode long after the enemy runs by if you don’t shoot it.
---
Camp stash rebalanced to 300 /s
---
But seriously can we also get a stash increase or I dunno, make vending machines have their own limits and not tied to camp limit?
---
Collecting “Grognak magazine” comes to mind. Sits at 9/10 but every individual magazine issue has a checkmark next to it.
---
Me: that is awesome!
---
Bethesda: kill it with fire
---
But you can pick up a meat pile and make it disappear. Ash piles stay when empty, and ash piles other players create stay as well.
---
MIRV grenades are the best to use imo. They work great for me, can take out multiple enemies if timed right. I do use LV 4 Demolition perk. Which helps
---
Anything to reduce menu clutter. This is one of  my most requested QOL improvements. Please.
---
Nice, thanks a lot for your response. Looking forward for some changes here =)
---
I sell all chems for the best price you could get from a vendor + 15% to get additional profit + 10% to cover the cost of the vendor tax. (Edit, and easy way to calculate it is this, figure out how much you want to get for an item, multiply by 90, then divide by 100, this calculates the vendor tax for you)
---
So for example, The best price I could sell fury for is 10 caps to a vendor.  You can buy them from a vendor with the best price of 70 caps.
---
I price them at 13 caps each.  This takes off 1 cap for vendor tax, and then I get a rounded up 15% bonus of 2 caps plus the base 10 caps.
---
I would also take into account how much the ingredients to make the item come out to before I craft the item.  The buffout and Psycho needed to make a fury has a total value of 90caps, I could have sold those 3 chems to a vendor and got 21 caps.  For it to be worth me crafting Fury it would have to be with Chemist and with Super Duper to make more of an end product that sells than the base components.
---
Since I sell chems for so low, I tend to keep them moving pretty well.  It’s not a huge profit, but allows me to exceed the amount of caps I’d have earned in a day from vendors otherwise.
---
I’ve had people try to tell me that 13 caps was too much for fury, but any lower is throwing away caps.
---
I agree
---
Except no one is playing NW because there's no anti cheat, it hasn't been updated since it came out, and optimization is poor, all of which Bethesda does control.
---
I had no idea there were hidden rewards in NW.  We're they cool?
---
None of the Legendary Run stuff was tested on the PTS, unfortunately, as there is no Atomic Shop access, and I think it should have been. 100% of these issues would have been caught and corrected.
---
They are so similar, but I prefer the handmade. To me it "feels" better to use and also looks better in first person.
---
I'm on xbox so no mods for me. Unless they add mod support for consoles.
---
I eventually just dropped all my unnecessary holos
---
I'll hit 90 today,no atoms used. I should finish a couple of weeks early,which means I probably won't play for the same time. Can't rebuild my camp either.
---
The bad frames persist even after the meat piles disappear and have been looted.  This is the issue.  Server side the effects are still there even though we can't see them after they have been looted.  Doesn't matter if there are ash or goo piles or not
---
Thank you all. My current ways of making caps are farming water and using the farming perk to collect a bunch of wild corn and razor grain . That run takes 10 mins and gets me 380ish caps. Water seems to take a long time to actually get enough to make it work in a single session for me. Although I’m using the small purifiers and still need to get the large version.
---
I tend to scrap everything like weapons and armor from events instead of selling them.
---
they should leave the PVP challenges. but bring back survival/private survival server. and redo the pvp challenges to be available to complete all of them in either NW or survival.
---
Y'all should get your own board if y'all are so in love with the mode. like y'all have come out to simp hard for it, y'all need a reward for it. And your rewards aren't even exclusive!
---
[fed76.info](https://fed76.info) prices it at 50,000 - 76,000 caps, so yeah - trade only item.
---
I see what you did there.  Clever.  ;)
---
Have you actually or just people claiming they're going to?
---
Im behind as well but Fk NW. Games are for enjoyment and when we feel forced to play or do something we dont really wanna play, dont. Just buy levels if you must have score rewards, the money is less important than your time and sanity.
---
The irony? The building mechanic that was removed was to alleviate lag caused by exploiters. Supposedly anyways.........
---
Nice, didn't know that. \*stonks meme visualizes\*
---
I play with alot of people and this would be awesome. Like a collective camp with a higher budget that everyone has to contribute to
---
I have that happen pretty often in VATS, it will show damage but nothing actually happens. Worse with my gauss rifle. Instigating, lower vats cost and its sitting in my stash.
---
Yup! Ironically, I tried it again after I posted this and it worked. So it seems there is just a bug with it. The UI for it with this update is so clunky.
---
What endgame content?
---
bird bones and the upgrades for legs that lessens fall damage basically means you dont take much at all unless you jump from an incredibly stupid height (theres also a legendary effect that reduces fall damage completely if you have it on both legs)
---
plus you can basically hover for a decent amount of time with bird bones and a jet pack
---
I use carrots. They’re small, foliage-like, and edible.
---
A little weaker, but not much
---
Power armor displays! I want to collect them!!
---
It is real annoying, glad it's not just me though
---
I sell everything in my vendor for 3 caps a piece, no matter what it is or its rarity. More for helping players than getting rich, I can grind for caps the old fashion way if I want.
---
Kind of yes. So far I found the grognak rpg game and zeta invaders. I got them after finding magazines. When I fist started in the vault I immediately checked the terminal because I had a feeling Bethesda put one in there too lol Sometimes the magazines are hard to see because if the lighting.
---
Making it so SCORE can be earned through either mode doesn't actually negatively affect you in anyway. It helps you! You don't have play NW ever. Y'all Y'all Y'all LOL man that's funny. Y'all.
---
Exactly!
---
People have only been saying this exact same thing for like 2 years now... no, the game isn't self-destructing.
---
Yup, now I can't change my wood walk to a barn door wall for example, it's honestly annoying af
---
wait am i not supposed to repair the anti air tower?
---
I haven't personally experienced that. I spent quite a bit of time in Glassed Caverns during the recent double XP event and we'd take a break to clear up the meat piles every 30 or so minutes to alleviate the lag. It could be another thing that mysteriously broke with the new patch perhaps?
---
Well that makes you very efficient farmer, my compliments.
---
Some were. I got them all and my favorites are the glowing skeleton costume and christmas tree. The tree reminds me of the sad little Charlie Brown christmas tree. The halloween weapon skins are kinda ugly imo.
---
This. The keys are not consumables anyway so there's really no point to see them.
---
I don't think the CAMP building community can handle it.
---
Shotgun/Commando here, honestly everything feels the same. Only thing it seems like VATS has gotten worse for the Guass Shotgun. I miss way more than before.
---
Just unequipped it
---
This happened to me with the Queen it landed and near instantly disappeared
---
Supposedly there are working on VATS bugs, someone from Beth posted in a thread a few days ago they where aware and working on it. Grain of salt there, though.
---
This game does make me insane and the love hate relationship I have with it most likely is not healthy 😄 So your point couldn't be more valid.
---
No i was talking about merging items together. Like placing something on top of a shelf then using the merge glitch to drop it to the lower part of the shelf to fill it up.
---
They really just should have made NW it's own game. It will just slowly die as along as it exists as a game mode inside of a game.
---
Why are you using a repair kit to repair your weapon at a weapons workbench? Is it a resource thing? Those are meant to be used out in the wild when you can't get to a bench...?
---
You are not forced to do anything my god. If you hate it so much then take a couple workshops, do some quests/events, call it a day. getting 25k xp is not that hard.
---
Haha I'm exited for the fix only to break my other vats gun!
---
But any player can shoot mines, i stopped using them in events.
---
No game has been running smoother for me then before the update on PS4.
---
Oh
---
SCORE gameboard is super slow and laggy. My pipboy menu is super laggy. Vendor bots are supper laggy. The Legendary trader is laggy. 
---
What's going on???
---
I don't know. Without the challenge I would have never tried NW. It's actually fun for a couple of games here and there. 
---
It would be good if all challenges had the option for NW or adventure. For example: 
---
Kill 3 legendaries in adventure or kill 3 players in NW.
---
But 3 items from a player in adventure or use 3 stimpacks in NW. 
---
Would be nice to have the option to play how you like for the score.
---
That's precisely what it is.  If you look at the  nukacrypt dev tracker you can see they responded to people who are reporting these issues at the end of events like radiation rumble, line in the sand, etc.  Something happened in the patch.
---
Look there are plenty of other problems with ash and goo piles that are not related with the patch.  They can stop piles underneath them from being looted and they can cause enemies on the server to not respond properly that need to be addressed but this lag/framerate drop issue is a new thing with patch 21.
---
Nothing really. Gunpowder maybe, but it shouldn't even be in that tab anyway lol it's just a little qol that would make the pip boy menu neater.
---
I have one, but I'm mainly referring to the Revolvers with that. Pistols are still fun! If you use semis, I suggest getting the VATS Unknown Alien Blaster because it's pretty effective with headshots in sneak on a team.
---
Yes 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Keyring
---
I was so disappointed when I found out the blast radius on Quantums was still the pitiful little fart cloud it was in FO4
---
If the above poster is unavailable, I am happy to assist.
---
Anyone else have a problem turning in meat to Blackeye, I think her name is? God, I have to start that conversation three times before we can get to the end. I am so glad I finished the grind weeks ago and have no reason to do that again lol.
---
I had a similar idea and it seems to be the most fair way to do it but can't be with just loot. It also has to include XP too i.e. you don't get loot or XP for killing each individual enemy but you get some or all of the XP and loot only if the event successfully completes. 
---
There are several instances where people only care about XP gain e.g. Radiation Rumble event. It's why people mill around killing ghouls rather than collecting ore.
---
I didn't try the sinking trick yet since i'm waiting for the orange camp device skin patch before rebuilding my camp, but I originally put stuff on shelves using mats, and blueprinting leaving out said mats. So you should still be able to, somehow.
---
The fixer uses 45 cal rounds which need cobalt flux for their ultracite. This is somewhat rare unless you go out of your way to nuke Morgantown.  The handmade's 5.56 rounds need violet flux for their ultracite variant, which is literally all over the place near to the queen fight, so you can keep a steady supply of that going.
---
Something worth pointing out - I don't know if it tips the scales or not. I stopped using the ultracite chamber with my fixer once I got a bloodied faster fire rate light machine gun. That needs fluorescent flux, with is plentiful in the Overgrown Sundew Grove near enough to fissure site prime to insure it gets nuked too.
---
Thanks, I just found the PA glitch using the box in first room, works for me.
---
Yeah, every time I go to the elevator when the event isn’t up, it just tells me to come back later or some such.   Am I dumb?
---
I didnt even think about that! The power conduit would've gotten in the way with my current build, but this just might work
---
Full agree.   Only when you need it though, the rest of the time the stuff’s everywhere
---
I'll prolly do it, because I'll be on anyways, just like this time.
---
If it takes time, then that's a fair price. And if it sells out then people are probably okay with it. Thanks for the rough pricing, I'll look up where to find the ingredients
---
I think I'll go one more for the handmade skin but the coop is my goal
---
You seem like a very fun person to be around /s
---
I've heard that this is a endurance buff wearing off and it plays the damage animation
---
its been almost 2 weeks, are you gonna reply to anyones messages or ship anyones shit?
---
They REALLY need to just suck it up and ask for help. This community has so many members with experience modding that they'd be able to at the very least isolate the exact causes of these bugs and find workarounds in the spaghetti code.
---
Did you happen to hear the title of it. He said it so fast
---
Shhhh.. bow go boom. Bow go 🔥. BOW GO 🤢🤮. 
---
But actually I’ve collected a bunch of legendary bows and crossbows and have yet to test what you guys think of: 
---
bloodied bow = explosive
---
Vampires bow = fire arrow 
---
Suppress/limb = cryo arrow
---
Haven’t an idea for poison yet.
---
It’s possible it has changed. It’s been a little while since I made formula p.  I’ve always been able to get down there even when the event wasn’t active.
---
I've never been targeted by anyone in pvp zones who wasn't hundreds of levels over me. The majority of players stop by, wave and use your workbenches and move on. Yet here comes the level 600 to the level 35s workshop and demolishes everything.
---
I think Bethesda had wanted something like this originally but couldn’t figure out the logistics of it. Possible we could see that become a thing with workshops if Bethesda let’s private servers be dedicated.
---
Still tier 2 during this season so I’m most likely not gonna care for the next unless there’s something so good I can’t resist, missed out on the marine ghillie skin which I only wanted for the helm so yeah was burnt out again when season 1 hit and I don’t think I could last for the amount of time needed to get to tier 100 without burning out or getting bored again for a season 2.
---
I understand, I don't nuke other peoples camps just Whitespring and fissure prime. I suppose I have to agree that Bethesda have to keep balancing the game to reign in the trolls and players who are all about making others game time miserable.
---
Wow, I’ve been selling fury for 50c fairly steady.   Guess I’ll drop that down to 25c, maybe that’ll help move the stuff.
---
Yeah I ain't doing it hell I didn't even do this one
---
No new trailer for the rest of this years content . Why this stream so lame so far imo.
---
If you're looking for cap sinks let me pay 1000 caps to reset my daily scrip limit. That way I can decide if I want it out of my inventory bad enough to pay.
---
Likewise.
---
Firecaps are a huge pain to find, too.
---
I like the fixer better for some reason. Not sure what it is but with a short scope it just seems to scratch an itch for me.
---
You sound like a fun person at parties.
---
I have the bow you’re looking for.  What console are you on?
---
I love how you're deleting your own comments that get downvoted so you retain some karma lmao
---
If you like grenades I usually use the dynamite that you get with bullion from Crater.  I think its 1 adhesive, 1 oil, and 1 fertilizer.  Cheap to craft and better damage than Frag grenades.  I also really like plasma grenades.  I seem to get a lot running West Tec and they shred.
---
I’m confused.  Two more seasons were already planned so why would this be a surprise?
---
We've known that for months, and yes of course I will be doing it
---
what's so funny about "y'all"?
---
For headshots and general sniping, I have a Bloodied Pipe Revolver Rifle, equipped with a long range recon scope. It is a bit slow, but SO satisfying to see critical hits over 2.5K DMG. I have never used the VATS Unknown for anything other than a nice wall adornment 😎
---
Don’t suppose you have stimpak diffuser recipe in your vendor?  &gt;.&gt;
---
I’m only in these for the CAMP items.  I went hard this season because I wanted the chicken coop, the fireplace door, and the board game decoration. 
---
Overall it wasn’t too bad, sure a couple of times I got grumpy and felt like I was just doing chores, but I’ve adjusted how I play and how I approach them.
---
So, next season, I’ll see how much I want the CAMP items, and then determine how much I want to go after them.
---
Put them in a vendor for 0 caps and hope someone buys them.
---
I thought they designed it this way, I've never been able to wallpaper the windows of the basic wooden wall. Didn't realise it was a bug lmao
---
Because this engine isn't compatible with ammo types. Modders have tried and it's a mess. There is no way these guys would be able to get it to work
---
Less the word itself, more the fact you used it four times in two sentences. You are silly as shit.
---
I don't even know where to get that at. I've had the regular stimpaks recipe and a few other drug ones but they got snagged by I'm assuming junkie builds
---
Better yet, any yellow locations become free.
---
Expand this to make crater and foundation yellow, to include with the vaults. They turn yellow and allow free fast travel once you reach the level before max with them.
---
Expand that further for any other factions, or significant locations, such as free travel to:
---
Whitespring Bunker once you are a member of the Enclave
---
Flatwoods when you become a Responder
---
Charleston Fire Dept. when you become a Fire Breather
---
That army base when you finish your training
---
The Asylum when you become a member of BoS
---
And so on for any others I may have missed
---
Yes towards West Tek, Ripper Alley, also down the dirt path by Investigator's Cabin.
---
Sweet!!! I’ll have to find an instigating western. thank you!
---
I'M DOING MY PART!
---
Being a casual player myself, I would have to agree and disagree to a certain point about the idea of having weekly limits. The game has to be fair to all who plays it, and having it at a weekly limit, this disadvantages the daily players, because now they would finish it in a day and then wait a week before the limits to reset. But there is a solution. 
---
So as of now, our daily limits are 1400 caps from vendors, 200 bullion, etc, etc. don’t need to go through them all. 
---
So the solution I have is as follows. 
---
What if there was some sort of catch up system implemented? Let’s say the game recorded you last logging on the game on Sunday. You go to work Monday to Friday and log on again on Friday night. The game has recorded you not logging on for 4 days, so the limits are multiplied (4 days = 5600 caps + 1400 caps for Friday) which is 7000 caps from vendors that you can earn, and the same goes  for script, bullion and so on. So now casuals and daily players will not be disadvantage. Daily players can continue playing every day, reaching their limits, and casual players can play longer to catch up with the bullion grind and all. 
---
This also is a plus for daily players. If they miss a day from logging on, then the next day they will be able to get 2800 caps from vendors. 
---
But what if you don’t log on for 2 weeks? All I say to that is bad luck, as the limit should only be a week. 
---
I hope all that makes sense, but I think this would be a fair system to have. 
---
Also, the personal cap limit should be raised from 30,000 to about 60,000, maybe 80,000.
---
Very nice!
---
Yes, and I've found no way around it. First, I thought maybe having the history up would help - nope. Then I thought perhaps it was from me skipping lines, so I tried just letting the audio complete - nope.
---
Yes. This may actually benefit server performance too
---
It's water **cooled** bonesaw. It's for cutting through the really thick skulls.
---
if it’s selling for you, keep it up. i just can’t be bothered, and so much has been found while hunting i need a good way to clear out stash
---
What if someone prefers NW over adventure mode? They get 1 daily and are forced to do 8 more in adventure mode. Stop being such a baby.
---
Was? Has anything happened yet?
---
Handmade is better for ADS. Fixer has a tad more damage and sneak bonus. It all depends on how you like to play.
---
*shrug* and that’s a better point to argue; deciding the balance point between mag capacity, reload speed, and armor penetration was Bethesda’s choice but there’s nothing wrong with suggesting that the balance isn’t correct. My big problem with this is people always just talk about the handmade. Why? Because it’s the gun they use (and they use it because it’s already the best), and they have no thought about making it even more overpowered vs the other guns.
---
I personally want to see balance among the weapons; I’m super curious to see if their supposed combat overhaul ever arrives, what they do with it. They already did some rebalances in NW (assault rifle has a 30rd mag, but visually it has the drum mag on it; IDK if the handmade has the default mag, a speedy mag, or a piercing mag, but it’s only got 20rds IIRC). 
---
I’d love to see the assault rifle have a larger capacity and less recoil, the combat rifle get a .308 mod for more damage but get even nastier recoil, etc. things to keep weapons somewhat balanced with each other but differentiate them.
---
You know, like virtually every other shooter does.
---
1.8 weight?!?!? WTF?!!
---
every time the same response and nothing happened. sorry but this is the truth. just listen what we want if you want to have us longer. are a lot of great posts here with great iddeas to make this game nice to play and what bethesda is doing? nerfing and more bugs implementing
---
Yup.
---
That's what how it started for me (I'm on PS4) at LITS and then my FPS started tanking all the way down to 0fps. Had to open the map/menu and FT away - was the only thing I could do.
---
Good point. The thing is there ARE good solutions to satisfy casual as well as daily Hardcore players. It's just the question about a better design than now.
---
Arms Race maybe? I'm not sure I got it right
---
You mean recycled footage?  ESO got a brand new trailer!  Yeah, to say the least, so far.
---
While I think this is an absolutely great solution, I think I’d rather this be a solution for F5 and future games. This would be a pretty great approach, but I can see this being an excuse for months of development time and ultimately it would just end up with us having the same features, albeit with a more interesting approach and some cool framing elements.
---
So no new info? All that talk from Pete to watch the welcome was a troll?
---
Whew! glad it's not just me. I keep waiting for one of the updates to fix it, but who knows, maybe I'll be full rep by then and won't care.
---
Yeah this is pretty garbage so far
---
Does that only apply in that given week
---
Eagle eye, bird bones, marsupial, carnivore, scaly skin, empath, healing factor, herd mentality, speed demon
---
Also an alcoholic based on how many empty bottles are in both his office and his bedroom.
---
You also have to know the plan for Assaultron Head to craft it.
---
How just wtf. Worst than the inside the vaults imo.
---
I'm upset about that also. Where we the q4 teaser
---
Yeah they were supposed to show trailers in the welcome section but nothing new was shown for fallout
---
I give away plans for free, and usually everything is half off or lower depending what it is. I often have "rare" junk and scrap on sale at resale price so even if  you buy something you don't want you can sell it for your caps back.
---
Not super rare, but annoying to craft. especially early on. Until you reach endgame builds there isn’t a reliable way to kill an assault Ron without help and it’s not guaranteed you will get their circuit birds to craft.
---
For some reason VATS can actually make this worse. I’ve really noticed this with guns- there’s times I can VATS the same target repeatedly (biggest situation I notice this is the lighthouse event, vs Fireflies) and get damage numbers and blood spray but they fly on untouched, but as soon as I just free aim, I down them no problem. No idea why that would be the case.
---
Farm pipe guns
---
Nice, post up a vid of it in action in the future. I was gunna build one once the legendary perks comeout with  "Power Sprinter". Theres gotta be more to these perks which people think are trash, like Pain Train, if Bethesda keeps "insisting" on them. You gotta expect theyve playtested different builds with all the current perks so theres gotta be something more to trash perks then people think.
---
Makes sense since goats get lumped in with satanic stuff, but the outfit is a sheep. Maybe they just took some liberties.
---
I second this idea. I have no problem with logging in daily, yet sometimes (usually at weekends) I feel like playing something from my backlog and don't have that much desire to open 76...
---
yeah not a great sign of things to come
---
I guess so lmao
---
I use it instead of Starched Genes, and use Brahmin Milk and Nuka Grapes.
---
Amusement Parks, bars &amp; any places with globes.
---
Damn that sucks to hear. Ppl were sure there would be a BoS trailer or something
---
You really shouldn't be surprised or care. 76 is gunna be done after this year.
---
have you only played like for 10 minutes since the season started lol  
---
how tf are you at only tier 2
---
That's a old bug from F4. It happens when you spam the continue button.
---
Nice tip, I will try this. I have been using the little brambles from the spring plant pack to large effect, but those consume budget.
---
We aren't. The event will complete regardless. If not, Bethesda get a clear message that this treatment is disgusting. I prefer the latter.
---
Excuse me, what? That's clearly a mod. I'm not touching anything. Can we get a mod to confirm this?
---
Other games barely got new info either , its everything everyone knew about imo
---
Guess we really will be wiping out the Scorched after all,  and the Super Mutants for that matter. Guess the Mole Miners get a pass for now though lol
---
Buy bulk as well?
---
76 is done after this year.
---
As far as I’m aware all of the ghillie armor skins are still obstructing on weapons where your arms are extended a significant amount. But specifically I use the skin on Combat armor
---
I once found a camp that was selling a lvl 50 bloodied 50% limb dmg deathclaw gauntlet with extra claw for 300 caps so i got it and now im doing 5000 dmg per hit.
---
I like this one. Upvoting.
---
The 76 team probably missed the deadline. We'll probably see that trailer a month from now.
---
I tell ya, I’m never eating that pie again
---
You get it from project paradise as a reward if you have 2 or 3 subjects still alive at the end
---
I have this weapon too. Got it from the purveyor as well. Never get rid of this weapon. You will regret it.
---
I would genuinely not be surprised it's really on its last legs.
---
Yikes, I better get enough money back from those Atlas provisions to justify buying the bulk
---
No it’s not. Bethesda is committed to supporting 76 forever
---
If the company is not going to use their communication to address player issues, why bother communicating?  There, i fixed it!
---
Not a flex, really. I want to know if the Bloodied Explosive is SO superior and so different from a Bloodied handmade, for example, or better than an automatic railway rifle, stuff like that. I have given away godrolls and stuff like that using Reddit too, playing games and such. Some users have won "prizes", let's say. 
---
I wouldn't have asked if I had received a Bloodied 1 star Fixer: That would have been a sure keeper: clean effect, no nerf against the QUEEN.
---
What platform are you on? I can give you a free 1 star Fixer.
---
I tried that, it works until you fast travel away. Wallpaper is gone when you return.
---
every time i try to speak to rose
---
Ah, ok. I've never done that event
---
I’m sure it’ll be fine. We beat still with an extra day on the clock. Worst case scenario we suck and find out if it’s possible to fail this event.
---
You have an email with the tracking already. It has been shipped. It will get there when it gets there. Not my fault the post office blows right now.
---
I have many confirmed trades so please, do not worry
---
For the actual plans there isnt really any other options Im afraid
---
Big thing for me is that I am a collector. I don't \*need\* to know how to make a gatling plasma on my bloodied sniper, but I will gladly pay 70 caps to learn it.
---
Better than bloodied faster fire or bloodied 33 vats?
---
Ive been drinking since I heard the brothers needed cork... Ad Victoriam! ..one bottle of wine at a time.
---
Pipe guns also don't cost cork to produce, so you can craft a bunch as well
---
I think you're right, I can't imagine Bethesda going "welp, you didn't gather enough cork. The brotherhood ain't coming after all"
---
I guess? At least I evoked a feeling other than rage for a second. Better than like, 75% of this thread.
---
Did they show any new graphics or talk about rewards at least? Hopefully we’ll see more since there’s going to be a few events that are specifically for 76
---
Unless I misunderstood what you said, you want to press a different button to throw a grenade? If that’s the case. Go to settings. Go to control. And from there you can switch around what each button does. I personally changed the jumping to X because I hate jumping with Triangle. But maybe you’ll find something there for grenade throwing. I’m at work so can’t confirm.
---
True, that would be interesting to see
---
I think its arms race also but still like wtf.
---
So what’s the name of Season 2?
---
They probably had more planned but missed the deadline like they always do.
---
yeah I never deploy there, I get stormed by  multi-hundred players who want their damn munitions.
---
I SELL most of my ammo for 1 cap each, you high level assholes.
---
You cannot be a pissbaby in your post and expect the comments to not be full of vitriol. Get real. I'm done with this.
---
Thanks. We lucked out, had a huge tree fall down and it missed everything by mere feet. The road is finally cleared enough we can get in and out. No one hurt at my house although someone in our town did die during the storm trying to clear a tree. Makes me feel petty about missing being able to play video games.
---
Nope
---
Wonder how much of the other materials we'll need?
---
Maybe, the last drop I had was mostly meat piles but there might have been some ash ones I wasn't seeing.  Ash would make sense as that was (apparently) what people were able to exploit.
---
I saw that one post about getting a cork from drinking wine, if only!
---
Just watched it on twitch tv. jeff Gardner ( project lead) did say you can unlock weapons via the challenge board - that was news to me.
---
Well that's not fair for you.
---
I bought a level 50 2* bloodied faster swing speed hatchet for 500 caps when I was in my 50s. Now I'm in my 80s and have yet to snag anything better. Most worthwhile purchase I've ever had so far. 
---
People can be very generous. The dude was practically begging for me to check out his camp and had cheap plans for sale as well! Secret undermesh entrance by playing an instrument...
---
[fed76.info](https://fed76.info) is a good place to check the market. Now, I personally undesell that price, because I am relying on others to come and find the item at random, and I ignore the "just for scrap" reply on starter weapons (a 1 star bloody pipe is not going to trade for a damn, but a new 50 might pay a few caps for being able to try the bloodied lifestyle). But for the most part, those prices make a good basic guide (and warns you if you pick up something epic)
---
and please mention scrip. there have been many times, especially after the purveyor sale and faschnaut, where I have so many legendaries on me, that I can not sell them to a vendor or scrap them for scrip and I end up being over-encumbered and cant fast travel to my camp, other events or even do my dailies. the limit is very crippling and hinders play.
---
I would be all for that, there are a bunch of underarmors that look nice.
---
Have they done the Colossal Problem demo yet?
---
Wow, what a 180. I was trying to be positive. Run off too, I guess.
---
I have a stealth commando Berserker, using explosive weapons for extra spicyness 😁 It is a fun, challenging build that makes the game feel like a fresh experience again.
---
Oh no.. i ment IRL... dosnt help the brotherhood much in game, but it sure does make FO76 alot more fun.
---
I noticed, and my SCORE board was extremely laggy, at rad rumble, it was INSANE on how much lag
---
Concerning but semi interesting, wish they actually showed something.
---
When has Uncle Pete steered anyone wrong before?  LOL.
---
The game needs to be turned over to modders. Let them do their magic.
---
I believe Bethesda don’t play their games enough. Let alone read complaints on forum.
---
This man is truly prepared for the future
---
Pretty much lmao I checked out the rewards when it released and checked out atlas observatory yesterday and that’s it.
---
This warms my heart ❤ I've encountered some of the best &amp; the worst in the community but I am glad that the best outnumber the worst. I've made some great friends through fallout
---
Yes this :(. It’s like the instant health regen bug that used to be here long ago is back in full affect. The game used to try to counter cheating from one shot builds and so it didn’t register the one shot kill if it was too much damage and instead it refilled the health of the mob that you just attacked. This is absolutely happening to me and I really wish more people would discuss it because it was a serious bad back then and if they don’t fix it it will be a serious bug again. I literally can see the health go down and then immediately refill on these mobs and they are taking two and three shots to kill because of it. This might not happen on multi Bullet weapons but is definitely happening on single bullet non-automatic rifle builds just like it used to
---
One can only hope. Just let Penny and those Army boys escape with the dog and cat first. They're the only good part of Foundation.
---
I have my main's camp right through the bridge near the Wayward, and I put in two or three low level weapons and 50 ammo for each for free. Reducing how much there is to take has reduced the number of high level dolts who think they really, really need a level 1 hunting rifle.
---
Im pretty sure its gonna be permanently exclusive to the helmet
---
So I made and blue printed the shelf, but when I try and place it down, it says it needs support
---
i dont think it is true - just a fun observation in the light of all the " do they even play the game" comments around . He was clearly taking about seaon 1
---
I had him a few runs back although I get Libby and Carver more than any of the others.
---
And let me put the damn fucking camera in my damn stash.
---
The longer you survive the more xp you get. By the time the last few teams are alive the match is nearing the final ring. I just find it quicker to run into the flames and jump into a new match.
---
Something else that just occurred to me, light wood frames of half walls and the wedge wall piece meant for the angled roofs could be used to make exposed rafter designs when placed without wallpaper or siding.
---

---
This is what drives me crazy with Beth. The constant stream of basically identical bugs that need to be fixed over and over again. It is like they have mindless robots developing this game. After you implement the same fix twice, you know you never fixed it correctly, or in the worst case, a documented procedure for this case was not created. Now perhaps you have one lazy developer, who has had a string of bad days at works, so he just doesn't care. That is where his manager or the QA manager or someone elevates the issue, and they make sure it gets fixed right.
---
I constantly see things not fixed correctly, and this seems acceptable. It shows complete disrespect for the customer and the product.
---
Thanks. I needed that chuckle.
---
Yes! u/Ladydevann as someone with over 1,500 hours into Fallout 76, player since the very first PC Beta, this would be such a HUGE QOL improvement for me, I can say hands down my time engaged with 76 would increase daily.
---
That's what I thought, sounds sick if it is.
---
If you read the terminal it is stated that they only made the helmet and the other info is lost now.
---
And then I show up with a magic gun, go EXPECTO PATRONADS and get instantly banned for "modding" Smh developers don't even know their own game.
---
or bugged ones that are lurking underground and never come up to fight.
---
It’s one challenge. I’ve been avoiding them challenges everyday and I’m still ahead in the legendary run. Even missed a couple days due to work. There’s more than enough time to get to end especially with the extra challenges. If you really want to get ahead, when u don’t need to, pay your way through.
---
Same here, it was the first time I've ever actually heard him say "Finally, someone with the guts to help" since I found a power pack before ever going to Foundation.
---
You're gonna miss a settler outfit, a legendary 10mm SMG, and a pipboy skin. You can still buy the Chinese stealth suit and helmet from the settler vendor for a shitton of gold bullion.
---
I'm getting super burned out as it is lately from this too, mostly bc I feel like I cant even play with my alts I started bc there's no time. Gotta grind grind grind or else I'm fucked in the SCORE. I'm running high INT too, to boot. It's fucking ridiculous.
---
I sell "Good" 1 stars for 750, but that's mostly to discourage upsellers. But if I see a 509-75 and see the weapon they are using, I'll usually gift the thing to them.
---
Just to make sure, so you didn’t do any of the settler quests?
---
Long-term you missed out on some character development that would have been good for fleshing out the game and maybe a few unique items that aren’t all that important. Biggest loss is now you’ll have to use gold bullion to buy the Chinese stealth suit rather than get it for free by playing the quest line. Plus lots of lost reputation, so it’ll be harder to get to that point where they’ll like you enough to sell you things.
---
Indeed
---
God for you. I don't have an income coming in right now, I can't just do that.
---
Line in the Sand was almost unplayable a couple days ago. I stand in front of the ?sensor thing? to guard it (I'm melee) and the scorched were all spawning all at once on top of me. Like they were coming down out of the sky. Meat piles were stacking up everywhere. It was lagging so bad I figured the server would crash any second, but it didn't.
---
On xbox
---
Damnit, no way to go back I suppose?
---
I found this bug not that long ago and I assumed it affected all walls with windows. Do brick and steel walls with windows render wallpaper correctly? I like having the natural light come in personally so it's what's kept me from using wallpaper
---
That's the reason why I don't use marine tactical helmets. If you do it a lot, you'll run out of rubber. If you have to farm mats to make stuff to sell, it's pointless because it's easier to farm stuff to sell. You can max out your daily caps in one trip through Fort Defiance or West Tek. If I want to craft stuff, I'll make something cheap like the Treasure Hunter outfit which takes leather and cloth which I always have in abundance and it will get me like 40 caps per. But I only usually do this if I'm in the Enclave Bunker and come up a few hundred caps short.
---
I am forever in need of 308. I dont even take the factory to make money. I'm just tryna have enough to defend myself lol
---
i dont vendor anything good because i hit max caps every two days just selling crap. the crap is worth what its beung bought for, being able to hold or transact more caps wont change that. 
---
the price of an item wont decrease just because you put a max on it and it never will, just remove the cap limit and caps can actually be a viable currency in all transactions. 
---
heres another thought, vendors dont trade in caps - they trade in a currency that can only be used at vendors and/or exchanged with caps via a fee
---
ive suggested in the past a color-up approach when 10k caps plus a fee becomes a “golden cap” that can be exchanged or traded, exchange to and from caps with another fee.
---
the game needs limit removal badly, combined with infinitely repeating cap sinks that regulate the currency flow such that the sum exceeds what you can earn with regular play. even something like purveyor pick with caps, or pay extra caps to pick a specific item or category 
---
if you learned anything from the dupes its that you can instantly make caps viable just by having something you can use them for thats not bound
---
The hardest part is translation of the old camp pieces into the new, to be honest, at least from a coding perspective. It's possible that some camps won't be convertible (unlikely, but I don't want to rule out impossible). If that happens then implementing this comes at the risk of exposing some players to the pain of being forced to rebuild their camp. I think the only way that flies is if the incoming system is far more flexible, powerful and easier to use.
---
Non vats player.  Handmade all the way.
---
If you like vats.  Fixer
---
The only reason I don't do this is I got tired of high level wankers clearing me out when I am too busy to ALT+F4 out. You're level 523, mate, I doubt you need that one star bloodied submachine gun
---
I haven’t payed my way through btw, I’ve just kept up to date with the challenges excluding the NW ones
---
Marginal difference between them all. The faster fire rate will do more to the queen though, because she has a *high* explosive resistance
---
The ability to "tier" your character at a certain level into either a Scorched, Super Mutant, or a Brainbot
---
Well congrats, I haven't always been able to play.
---
Arms race? So it will be communism themed then. Thank you!
---
You can always just make a new character to get the outfit and SMG but it's not really worth it. The suit and pipboy plan are untradeable
---
I love how everyone assumes they just auto complete it. It's not like they have access to the game metrics and can see what we have and tend to do and set reasonable goals... But no, they're just playing us for fools I guess .
---
I don’t have fo1st, but I saw a good number of post saying that they **did** quit fo1st.
---
boo
---
Don’t worry you stupid clown, if they fix this all people need to do is have a friend engage them in pvp and destroy their stuff, it’s not an exploit. Let people be creative.
---
The junkyard PA skin in the atom shop would look cool with it.
---
Does anyone know the EST for Captainnoob?
---
So NW players just get the shaft? If anything, they should have their own tab of challenges equal to Adventure mode SCORE so they don’t have to play PvE to get SCORE.
---
Hey gang!  I am on fios.  Gig and its been rock solid bandwidth.  Fo76 goes to a menu and hangs.  Drop all those missiles and nuke into my gym bag and...........lag. Freeze... sometimes it recovers.  Sometimes the games drops server.   I nuke the university to gather unobtainium and after 15 minutes in my own nuke, game freezes...   praise be to the pagan gods, i can rejoin my team and find my nuke zone without server hopping!   Lag in fo76???   I’ve lost a metric tonne of unobtainium due to lag and discos
---
That’s great to hear. Can’t be said enough that the overall community is extremely helpful. Or maybe all our pent up rage is just taken out on nuking Atlas Observatory...
---
I think you could massively raise the Caps limit as long as you add additional Cap sinks to the game.  And not just like, items you can loot in the game world already, I mean meaningful stuff - like unique skins for different things, or raising limits on current currency (pay 5,000 caps and you can unlock an additional 150 scrip from the Exchanges, or be able to exchange Caps for Perk Card Packs, or even expanding the Scrapbox concept to other item categories, like a Chembox or an Ammobox - but say, maybe they cost 10k caps to "unlock" and only for that character).
---
Fed76 is a stupid ass site and should only be used for mid to low tier weapon pricing 
---
Even after the dupe wave a BE fixer is still well worth over 100k in cap value
---
I am at the point where I talked to the Secret Service and meg walked in asking how I wanted to deal with the gold. I told her to give 250 to foundation and she got pissed. Now I got "Talk with Lou" as an active quest and don't see anything with the Settlers..
---
Your welcome
---
In-game, it states only the helmet was actually created and the designs for the rest of the concept have been lost. 
---
But don’t worry! I’m sure we’ll have a beautiful Atom Shop exclusive set available in another three months or so that will compliment it perfectly, only 1800 atoms!
---
how about you just earn an extra 30,000 xp from playing adventure mode which will give you 300 score and you can ignore the NW challenges and feel like you are not missing anything.
---
Not only do they give you exp... but the also hold my pudding packs
---
• Fixed an exploit that allowed players to place lights inside walls
---
If only that were so!  lol
---
I don’t even know what he’s talking about with those detonators.
---
2pm, just like the post says
---
dont.
---
Mine was for the taxidermy badge. Scrapping those hides... that was a solid round of grinding, I have terrible luck.
---
Yeah I’m only lvl 36
---
You can still get ally with Foundation through daily and random encounters...it's gonna take a long time tho... 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
On my one x, when loading in at my camp, it can take over 30 seconds to a full minute to switch weapons.
---
I can pull out my equipped weapon, but trying to use the weapon wheel is useless.
---
All the while, the super mutants are shooting my generator with laser-beam precision with pistols. Fml
---
NUCLEAR KEYCODES ARE ON SALE, HOPEFULLY TO SELL!
---
NUCLEAR KEYCODES WERE OVER 310 CAPS COSTING
---
THIS MONTH: 50% OFF!
---
4 Nuclear Keycodes left remaining!
---
My xbox username: Shenpai Daddy. Hopefully meet at my camp, go to my ventors area behind my camp!
---
My favourite thing to do is wait by the vault with things for new players! Are you ps4 by any chance?
---
Only 125m steel for the BOS to bust out the boxes of berets they've been sitting on
---
Free with next gen, which is nice becuase this is the first gen I actually plan to buy at launch.
---
goddamnit. who gives dailys?
---
I agree with this.
---
I also wonder if this would help with system performance cause it no longer has to spawn multiple instanced containers for people to loot, and just keep track of how many kills/objectives the player did, and use that as a multiplier for how much loot they get at the end.
---
It's accurate where it needs to be accurate - the less than 10,000 range. No site is going to be perfect and it's better than going completely blind. Or are you one of those "good is the enemy of perfect" types?
---
I was wondering if they would complete it and trigger the next one as well?
---
"Fine, we'll cut way back on awarding legendaries."
---
Bethesda, probably
---
*Do you know what day?*
---
If you got the samr world you might just need to travel there - Inhave had it happen where I lost the workshop but just had to return and my stuff was still there.
---
Hopefully some info can bleed from this but def keeping expectations to nothin
---
🤷‍♂️
---
I play because it's a fun pastime. 
---
I donated the base 250, that's it. I'll do the same for the rest. I dont care if they fake numbers or not. With meh rewards, they probably should. But I dont care really. Fun is fun.
---
Ward
---
Sell at 99 and most of the time one person picks up the 8 or so I put in there at once
---
Im aware that survival time gives xp, thats my main source of xp. I always tried to survive as long as possible, even if it means being two shotted by some level 360 haha. I will try your method of recycling when reaching the final combatants though, and see if it helps with the challenge
---
how about just making it so the few things that weigh anything in misc go someplace else and I can ignore the weightless misc tab forever?
---
Ward at Foundation
---
Went there a few days ago outside the event no problem...
---
I'm so sorry but I'm on PC(Steam) :(  
---
You are the reason why I love this game and it's community ! :D Keep on being the awesome player you are and party on in the wasteland mah dood !
---
Level 278 Xb1: Vaalsgard. Add me. Magic gun tank buid. Literally invincible bodyguards.
---
Honestly any game can become a chore and while I understand and wholly agree with having your daily time held hostage, making your experience revolve around the time limited stuffs ruins it for yourself too. If your mindset isn’t to have fun and maybe play with or make friends, any game could be difficult. Maybe take a break and refresh?
---
Alternatively: Any Legendaries that are killed during an event, can be looted by anyone who is currently in and participating in the event area.  Essentially they are "auto-tagged."  This way you never have to worry about missing out on a Legendary, or having some jackass smite it down in one hit and deprive everyone else of loot.
---
Nah, it is a timed event. You can start dump the next item tomorrow.
---
Thats kinda genius imo
---
Yeah, if I can get there fast enough before getting sniped by some guy who found a scoped sniper ten seconds in on his first box.
---
10/10 balanced pvp mode
---
No. We're not resorting to wanting bandaids for broken ass design.
---
Oh yeah randomly I just started not having to deliver anything to ward to get the rewards, I just have to talk to him, it's pretty epic
---
Yeah once codes reset then you gotta use the webpage again. Lol
---
Am I missing any plans for my camp by doing this?
---
I use both depending on my ammo stash.  I'll even convert the fixer to .38 and it still is totally fine.
---
You're not saying much beyond "I don't like pvp, please remove the 10% incentive to try it out", it's like if I said I don't like being "forced" to level up every day for the 500 score cause leveling is not what I login for so please remove. What real reasons would there be to remove that for the next season?
---
You could reasonably ignore it the entire season if you're really that adverse to trying pvp and still be fine.
---
Yeah, ok, if you can FIND a new match. Die in a few minutes, wait ten minutes for a new match. 
---
Can see why you guys love this mode, a lot of downtime.
---
Pro-tip, if you don't have negative intentions you shouldn't use negative hyperbole in your title.
---
I would love it, just to prove they can do it. A listed fix in the patch notes is normally Bethesda's way of saying "we are working on it." 
---
The real problem is, even if they fix something, you know an identical bug will appear within weeks or months. They never seem to do it right or learn from their previous mistakes.
---
Yah I’m only donating the base amount too (from scrapping weapons during play).  Not going to spend what limited time I have grinding resources for the brotherhood lol
---
I've burned out recently too. Haven't played this week &amp; get the feeling I won't bother with Atlas or the legendary run. Not even oay for lost rank. Just not worth it.
---
do you also refer to the major problems with hackers in NW? Bethesda didn't seems to carry about that anyway at all.
---
every, really every other game shut down the servers and fix the issue within a few hours if it is game-breaking or ruining the economy. every dupe glitch, hack and other major problem was NOT fixed promptly, it always took several days or even weeks to fix it and came with huge cuts to the game-play like disabled player vendors for several months.
---
I don't always have the time to accumulate 30k a day.
---
I’ve never used that option myself. I’ve planned ahead and had plenty of wares to sell myself. 
---
That’s why I agreed with your general point, with the only adjustment that it is under very specific and limited (as well as avoidable) circumstances where it makes sense.
---
You are correct, but let's look at it in regards to game design, the mechanics all revolve around you doing the same steps, they do not even reward exploration, the only thing that I enjoy about the game is the community, which is far better than any of other games
---
Yeah, you're toast. The Chinese Stealth Suit is like 4000 Bullion to buy.
---
Yeah I figured as I went last night assuming next phase and saw we were still on Steel!9
---
I love giving items to new players and selling items for 0 caps at my shop, especially ammo and aid.
---
I'm glad to hear this! A lot of people are still toxic about this game. It has its issues, as does Bethesda, but people play it for a fun pastime and escape and that's all that really matters. 
---
Was going to offer to team up, but sadly I'm on PS4. 
---
Keep enjoying it!
---
Yeah I was wondering the same thing, usually my stealth hunting rifle can do a good 1K if the instigating effect doesn’t apply but it’s gone down to the late 300s-500s.
---
Then don’t lol
---
No camp items.
---
Pretty telling that even with such a simple mistake, a players first thought would be “what part of the game got screwed up now” before checking what they may have messed up.
---
I mean I think I've noticed more detail then usual with the flies on meat piles, not sure about ash piles. Radiation Rumble keeps driving me nuts though as my lag gets so bad now that I'm artifacting, starting by both central turrets and spreading down the halls by the time it's over.
---
I'm on Xbox if they're unavailable.
---
Hahahahahahahaha Bethesda finishing something from a year ago?
---
You slipped your finger *twice*. It takes two button presses to complete a purchase. 
---
Send in a [support ticket](https://help.bethesda.net) to Bethesda and request a refund.
---
It would help if you told them what it is you DO want. 
---
Actually, it wouldn't matter at all, but it would help us understand your point.
---
I wanted to warn ppl who do not enjoy rants to not open the topic
---
you mean we should ban bethesda for their bad netcode?
---
No worries, I’m just hoping to spot someone I’ve helped in the sub!  It’s funny because I will go out of my way and literally chase someone around the map and start shouting in game chat just to give them stuff, but I’m the complete opposite in the other online game I used to play. 
---
You could start helping low levels even if you’re not the highest level yourself, just dump any ammo you don’t use for them, it’s always a nice gesture!
---
It has to be an Easter Egg
---
You can also do Photo Opportunities, starts by talking with the robot at Overseer's home. Choose to take pictures of Crater and then sell them to Ward.
---
And perhaps it can come with a larger update. I have a feeling they have a lot more 3D designers working on this stuff than they do working on coding, which is why I’m guessing there’s always so many clipping and other kinds of bugs even though the objects themselves usually look pretty great. 
---
Idk how much would have to go, just judging by previous Bethesda choices it seems like they would be resetting all bases or at least sending them to blueprints(which basically means resetting sadly). 
---
I’m not necessarily saying this is a hard thing to do, just that Bethesda is already behind on a lot of simple textures(like the mountains count mask that was supposed to be a gift with wastelander’s release). There’s just a lot of minor mechanics that already seem to not get much attention despite desperately needing a fix. I don’t know if I’d want the devs spending time on a total camp rework and then release bad or broken content for the following couple months
---
I pretty much always buy Psycobuff, Mr. Fuzzy Tokens, and (during the battle pass only) bubblegum.
---
It's rough going back to unmodded Fallout 4 after playing 76 a lot. 76 doesn't get enough credit for how they streamlined some of the interface stuff that was clunky in 4. For example stuff like the stash being universal would have made Fallout 4 so much better. Setting up trade routes just to be able to move scrap is such a chore. Being able to build almost anywhere is also awesome.
---
I also really like being able to swap out builds (though perk loadouts would be a godsend). Sure in Fallout 4 you could eventually specialize in everything but I kind of like how they limited perks in 76, forcing you to make hard decisions about damage vs. QOL (minus a few exceptions like lockpicking), where as in Fallout 4 you can just do everything all the time.
---
I also really like the realtime vats. If they could fix it to be like a target lock for melee, it would be even better. Vats in the single player games is a neat effect a couple times, but it gets annoying really fast, especially in the old games where you couldn't cancel out of it.
---
Since last patch my toon needs to drink twice as much than before
---
Yeah, I go to some of these high level players camps and see them selling all of their plans for 500 or even 1000 camps each, even common plans like the chemistry bench. Then you see people here complaining about how nobody ever buys plans 
---
I sell all of my plans for under 100 caps each, even the ones the game recommends sell prices of many times higher than that. Why not, I don't need them. And guess what, my plans sell.
---
shovel
---
Once you’re 50 it won’t be very difficult to craft, or I’m sure there are plenty of ppl willing to craft one for you as it doesn’t cost much to make.
---
Actual raids, instanced to groups, with easier "solo" modes available.  Instanced team based pvp matches (control points, "capture the flag") etc.  Small group, arena pvp.  Crafting of weapons and armor that is used for more than scrapping the item to learn the mods... all of these are tried and successful building blocks for end game in multiplayer games.
---
But honestly I think the most important aspect is removing the complete randomness of acquiring the gear for you build.  You want it to be a 3 month grind to get that BE Fixer?  Fine.  At least then the player knows how much effort they will need to put in.  But the current system will crush your will to play this game when you just want your goddamned weapon and you've spent 3 months rolling for it with literally nothing to show for it.  No progress made for the effort, just a lot of shit you turned in for more scrip to try again.
---
I've only got 2 months into this game, level 175 (I have a lot of free time) so I'm not burned out yet.  But I can already see it coming.  And I wouldn't be surprised to find out that burnout from repeating the same cycle of get scrip, spend scrip, get shit, turn in shit for more scrip is the #1 reason for players leaving.
---
1800 atoms as sale!
---
I gave 20k steal. And you are right, game is fun. If it would be bad, I would not play with it.
---
This is awesome to hear. I played most of the game solo in a private server and only started to play in public servers recently and I regret not doing it sooner. I know how hard it was in the beginning by myself so I try to help lower level people I see. Sometimes I head to The Wayward and will craft guns for new players there along with dropping ammo.
---
I didn't make my point clear?
---
Bethesda as an entertainment company should have the tools in game design to fix game design issues, I wouldn't prefer to state a solution, since I've seen with player initiated solutions, there is always a misunderstanding with the implementation of the solution 
---
Ex: ammo machine interface issue
---
Why do I feel like that's a solution on the drawing board for them.
---
I haven't done this yet because I'm in between low and high level so I don't have anything to give but I found this kid who just started the game and me and a couple buddy's gave him 300 stimpacks 300 radaway a power armour chassis and a full suit of ultracite power armour so when that kid hits 50 he's strapped plus I gave him a level 20 3 star legendary baseball bat that I saved from my start it helped me and I hope it helps him. Good luck to that kid hope you enjoy your experience in appaltia
---
Hahaha I remember 1 of the High Leveled Players got mad at me for not taking stuff from him and he waited for me to get back to my CAMP and watch me take his Ammo and Stimpaks. I was so embarrassed to take his stuff because at that point I felt super guilty taking stuff from High Leveled Players    / ( o / / / w / / / o ) /
---
Yup same mechanic with fallout 4 terminals
---
Oh I forgot to mention but my controller has an issue with the A button where pressing it once cause it to input two presses. I'll press it once and it'll do it twice
---
How about no limit because I can tell you is rather blow a days limit each day than a weeks limit in a day and have nothing to do for the rest of the week
---
oh lord please no, the only thing you will see in nuclear winter will be a square of stacked foundations every few steps with people hiding inside...
---
I forget to change my perk card from commando to heavy gunner and I still do enough damage to the queen to get loot. Until they add perk card load outs for console I'm always going to forget to change them from casual fights to hardcore fights to crafting etc 🤷‍♀️
---
I've given up on the legendary run mid way, since I have real life commitments that didn't allow me to login everyday, i get to play a lot in weekends but... to no point
---
I tried to design this suggestion to keep the new models down to a minimum as I'm well aware that's often the bugbear.
---
They honestly need to do some themed updates like Minecraft though. The Camp redo update, the Weapons rebalance update, and a couple of sprints that are just pure bug fix runs.
---
And they need to figure out how to test their code cause it's damn obvious they aren't even using unit tests. But I'm getting off topic now.
---
I do the same.  What's the point in selling something for a stupid high amount of caps when there's nothing else to spend them on and you're already maxed out?
---
It's okay, mate. When I logged in last night, both mission strands were now working fine.
---
Completed Wastelanders last night. Really bloody enjoyed it actually.
---
Ha!
---
I began selling plans at 1 cap for players visiting my CAMP and they always seem happy buying it :D I think i should start selling ammo that I don't use for 0 caps as well :O Kinda hogging up my cache :T
---
Mmm nome update 1800 atom  gome bundle sggshsbdhksldllkkkk  thacs buthusda
---
Like I said, I don't know how hard gold scrap is to farm so my suggestion was just a guess. I'm not saying it should be that exact amount but at the same time it shouldn't be too easy to get a ton of bullion.
---
Yeah because it has absolutely never been posted about here. How could he possibly be aware of their existence otherwise?
---
Ayyy youre on xb1. Shoot a dm and ill send my gt.  Since my first nuke last week I've been trying to launch one every night after work lol
---
I like to potter around collecting materials to breakdown and make ammo with. Like a second life living in the rubble of wv scavenging. I haven’t made a super powerful build, so I still have to be careful around certain mobs. It’s really a fun escape. I think fo76 lends itself to that sort of self-entertainment.
---
Just the Run board, other than that lag has been way better for me since the patch
---
Remeber also, if you have really good armor effects, let the armor break but don’t take it off, you don’t get the DR but you get all the perks and effects from the armor if it’s legendary
---
I was mostly being silly.
---
I am on Xbox 1 and appreciate the offer, but have plenty.
---
I have used my B2525 fixer then switched to my BE fixer to compare and they seem to do about the same for me in terms of kill speed, even with demo card maxed on it. One to three shot kills at West Tek and such depending on stealth, adrenaline, cards, and such. Sheepsquatch, Scorch Beasts, big legendaries all go down in seconds. 
---
They seem to slightly outperform my similar Handmade rifles in terms of damage and kill speed. 
---
I usually tend to keep using the B2525 so on those rare occasions that I blast something too close and it kills me with the splash damage. Same with Queen fights. 
---
Don't get me wrong, the gun is great, and a dream weapon to a lot of people. But for me the 25/25 is where its at. 
---
Cheers and congrats on your gun.
---
Yeah I know smelting for scraps is in the chemistry station but seeing as bullion would be a step up from scrap it would be cool to have a little forge set up in your camp
---
The actual Fallout 76 bit starts in an hour apparently
---
🤦‍♂️
---
Base, that’s how all of them work. Each modifier calculates the bonus damage from the base weapon and adds it on without paying attention to other modifiers.
---
Im crossing fingers
---
"Woops, sorry. You can't get your 12th BOS outfit because the community didn't donate enough aluminum. We'll just go ahead and move them to Fallout1st. Sorry the community failed you, kid." 
---
Yeah, they'll definitely complete the donations themselves. We have no way of knowing of the actual numbers of donations.
---
I have a junkies tesla rifle and half the time ill get hit markers with it but it wont do any damage or numbers will float up like im doing damage but health doesnt drop at all.   Is this whats been going on for everyone else with the teslas?
---
Ultracite 45 rounds are weightless (with Bandolier and an AWR armour piece)
---
It’s a game, no one is holding you hostage or forcing you to play it. Y’all take this shit too seriously
---
Search "commando build" on here or YouTube
---
There are places where Wendigo are often spawned like Freddy Fears House of Scares for example. I go there, kill the mobs, loot, then server hop, and repeat. I get screws quick that way.
---
Well I suppose the dupers better pull us through on this one....
---
Thank you
---
Indeed it's just pointless, when you could be helping new players but just like real life some people are greedy A holes
---
I have one I was just wondering if it was rare, lots of people have helped me craft things before
---
You are correct
---
I don't know what the situation is on other platforms, I play xbox and finding matches doesn't take very long.
---
More public teams means more teammates' bags on the ground. Also, there may be more energy weapons around after the last round of duping.
---
I’ve heard a few people theorize they’ve set up this event to help drain the duper’s scrap stashes. Makes sense to completely fudge the numbers in that case.
---

---
Went for a commando/demolition expert style. Looks pretty solid. Picked a team style design with the public team system being a thing. You can always swap out to solo play with lone wanderer and other solo perks.
---
You can also use med-x addiction to lower your dr by 10 so you can use under armour.
---
Never a bad idea! But never feel bad for selling more rare plans and ammo for a little bit of caps either!
---
I think some cases of lag are worse than others. I did an SBQ yesterday with virtually no lag but my Legendary Run interface is unbearable.
---
I played around with a bloodied shotgun build (Vats heavy) from lvl 1 all the way up to about 180? I switched to a bloodied fixer/handmade build (vats heavy) and never looked back, am 268 now, only wished I could have started working towards it in my earlier levels and not waste too many skill points swapping around and allocating points.
---
My only advise would be do some research watching other players on youtube on the various builds, see what attracts u the most or suits your style of playing, and stick to it. Soon enough you would actually accumulate more than enough points to change to another build if you want to at a later level or if u want a fresh change of style to your gameplay.
---
With Ward, it happens when his script is trying to play a radiant dialogue line (some random snarky remark) and it gets caught in a bad loop because you've initiated a conversation.  Once he's managed to spit out whatever stupid thing he's trying to say it's fine.  At least, that's been my experience with it.
---
Any weapon with a reckon scope will mark targets on your compass when you aim at them.
---
Incase you’re joining a friend.
---
Make sure you don't have a controller plugged in if you use m&amp;k, that fixed my issue with crashing
---
Update 22:
---
Legendaries: we fixed a bug that has been in the game since day one where people were rewarded legendaries for killing a stared enemy. this was not our original intent. the stars were supposed to indicate the difficulty level of said enemies. we have removed legendary items from their drop table and updated their pool to include "rare plans" and alcohol 
---
we are working on a way to reintroduce legendary items back into 76 through the purveyor system. our intent is to have the purveyor be the one-stop-shop for all your legendary item needs. to reflect this, all-star item prices have been lowered by 5 scrip and you can now have the possibility to get a 3-star item from the 3-star box. this means you can also get a 1-star item from that box as well. if you want to get a guarantee x star item, those boxes have increased 2x in scrip. this is to ensure that the legendary economy does not break. also scraping legendary now gives you 1 scrip per star. so a 3-star item gives you 3 scrip. this was changed so that people wouldn't wonder why weapons and armor were at different scrap values. 
---
all of this will be included in update 23
---
Update 23:
---
sorry but the new legendary item system ran into some bugs that were could not address in time for this update. we are working on it and will let you know when it will be introduced. please note that this can not be tested on the PTS due to technical reasons.
---
Update 26: (December)
---
we are introducing the reworked legendary item system, due to the rework, everyone's legendary items will be removed as the update reworks every legendary. but don't worry, everyone will get 10 atoms for every legendary that was on their character.
---
Update: Due to a bug that caused everyone to receive legacy explosive energy weapons and causing enemies to only drop nocturnal Explosive Resilient power drills, we are turning off the system and will address it in a future update. 
---
I think I should work for Bethesda, and write their patch notes
---
Say you're in a discord community, and one of you friends posts that there's a SBQ nuke coming down on the server they are on. You want to join the server so you can take part in the fight, but you can't because someone else on the server has your CAMP spot. That's one example why it's *good to have the option*.
---
&gt; Secret undermesh entrance
---
I just learned of these yesterday, when I saw a team-member moving 50ft under me, at a place I expected to be a regular storefront. [But here was only this ...](https://i.imgur.com/1q1cJ4F.jpg). 
---
Had to use the terminal to drop down into what ended up being a L.800+ player's underground lair, hah.
---
Yes it happened to me as well once. With succulent.
---
To see what someone else did with the same location you chose. Staying doesn't undo your camp, it will be safe and sound when you relog.
---
ty for advice, nope completely vanilla files but gonna try verifying files anyway as a hail mary, can't make things any worse :L
---
Thank you I'll try it to see how it goes
---
Maybe we're finally getting a stash boost again
---
76 is the only online game I own that I have problems with. Nothing else, not ESO,Grand Turismo,GTA, and about 10 more at least.  I can always count on Fallout 🙄
---
Yea, that's not casually playing.  I've been at this since it started without missing a day and doing some of the NW ones and I'm only at 83.
---
At low levels I would take a workshop and set up everything but make sure to leave it all unlocked. I then made a sign with letters that said EVERYTHING UNLOCKED AND FREE, TAKE WHAT YOU NEED or something similar to that. 
---
This stopped most of the players from murdering me and/or taking the shop from me when they arrived to get supplies, as they could just stop in and grab what they wanted then get back to playing. 
---
Some people just want to murder you though...
---
nope, no controller or Bluetooth devices :L just fallout being fallout
---
Include that in your support ticket. And don’t click on anything with the A button in the Atomic Shop. Get your controller fixed or replaced.
---
Brotherhood of Cork more like.
---
When it comes to the reload its a bug that affects faster fire rate weapons and that if you shoot alot when the clip empties some of your ammo is returned into the mag. If you bash,activate vats,stimpak yourself or just in general dont reload, you can use those rounds. I do it all the time in my tesla. Shoot 60 rounds, Bash, Got a clip of 30-40 instantly ready to fire
---
It's the emptiest threat of all time...
---
If my camp can't be placed, I will usually stay on that world to check out player vendors before trying to find a new server.
---
Only certain quest areas are instanced, most interior cells are not &amp; anyone can gate-crash them &amp; even instanced quest areas are open to group members
---
When it was initially released, I thought it would be like a change machine. Dump all your unwanted ammo and out comes "money" points to buy different ammo.
---
I have a camp with rock sides built into the design. You can also place those bad boys in rocks and cliffs. Makes for a very interesting effect.
---
damnit that really sucks. how does one earn bullion?
---
😢
---
Why collect it? The challenge will auto complete
---
Free camp replacement
---
Ok cool, bye!
---
Imagine being this self centered. 
---
If you dont like it then dont play it. Why would you want to take away any opportunities to earn score? How would removing NW score benefit you?
---
Just following up to say that I went bloodied and -dayum- it’s like I had been playing the game on hard mode and turned easy mode on instead.
---
I can still die from rads but if I wear PA it’s like playing in god mode.
---
It also illuminated a lot of the “balancing” issues Bethesda has. If you’re basing SCORE progress on bloodied builds only then the current setup is fine. I make *so* much more SCORE now that I’m earning xp at 3x the rate.
---
I wonder what % of the game plays bloodied.
---
Good luck. Keep in mind I chose for ballistic rifles. But you can easily swap a perk to do energy rifles if your into that style as well. 
---
As with any automatic weapon. Ensure you have the ammo reserves to do it.
---
Yeah, this is a great idea for another game, but we have to be honest, Bethesda isn't going to remake the wall building in 76 at this point. The easiest option is likely a separate "interior wall" that comes in all the basic shapes and sizes that comes in boring white on both sides like the inside of brick walls and can have wallpaper applied to both sides.
---
Who is the cork duper ? What drives those persons ?
---
Once you've got into Vault 79, you earn Treasury Notes by doing public events (and the daily faction events - including Davenport's dailies at the Overseer's).
---
You can turn in 20 notes per day, for 200 Bullion. So, if you do all 20 per day, it will take you 20 days to get to 4000 (and there is a max you can have, which is 5000 at a time).
---
Thanks for letting us know.
---
Are you surprised? Bethesda never had the intention on giving Fallout 76 proper support, hence the last two years. It was always a cash grab to help fund their original IPs in The Elder Scrolls and Starfield. They have no personal connection to the Fallout franchise.
---
We know. We've played it.
---
I'm pretty new to the game but I have had this happen to me several times this morning while playing on PC
---
Your name is a lie
---
OK, that is interesting. Do explosive laser rifles exist? Good old BoS character.
---
To each his own, better ventures elsewhere, and good luck.
---
there is always minecraft if you can't find anything else
---
Thanks for posting! Now I can knock out the NW quick before starting an adventure sesh.
---
Lol you’re good. Themed updates would be good, if they weren’t in such a bad spot with the community I’d say they need to just take a couple months to just fix every bug they know and figure out why they keep breaking mechanics despite releasing updates that aren’t even related. It feels like they must have changed the F4 mechanics as cheaply as possible to be workable as a multiplayer game and its led to a lot of shoddy work that is still affecting the game.
---
I really would also really like an actual number from Bethesda on how many people are working on this project. I’ve heard some people saying as little as 10 based on experience and that sounds like not much better than an indie quality game with AAA expectations.
---
A high-survival/high-level area would def be a sick end game add on. A section that would have more things like nuke zone flora, mobs, loads of rad infested places,  secluded events etc. I could see that being a really cool thing to add for sure for advanced high level players, because there are so many it seems. Every server has at least a few 200+ level players so it’s not a ridiculous concept. Those players also do have a lot to say about being able to grind certain things with the RNG, so there could be higher % chances for rarer drops for the harder level things you would be doing. I like the idea
---
I'll do you one better.
---
Make fast traveling free, who the fuck am I paying those caps to, huh?
---
I think food and drink have always been inconsistent.  It not working at all could be a one time server issue.
---
I’m on PC also. Thank you for commenting and confirming. The more confirmation we have the better. Again, I really just want people to acknowledge this so that we can voice our concerns and they can fix it because it was really problematic back then and if it goes unnoticed for months and months again a lot of builds will go unused.
---
Do you have a PS4 or a PC?
---
Big oof
---
Yeah, I was thinking about that as a final option, thanks!
---
I don't get it either so I'm hoping someone can explain. I'm especially curious since "instanced interiors" are coming to our camps (?) soon. To me, this just means another loading screen (boo), but I'm curious to know of the benefits of this.
---
And same here ... was finally gonna do 76 on my 3rd char, but alas =(
---
This is precisely what’s happening to me on PC. If I’m looking at a huge number of meat piles, the game slows to about 2FPS and is unplayable. But if I look at the sky, I’m back to full speed. Never had any trouble with the meat piles before, even after full glitched Line in the Sand events.
---
There is a cost because it is one of the few reliable cap sinks in this game.
---
At this point no one should be surprised, disappointed or let down by Bethesda or 76. It's always been a money grab to support their 10 years in between each new broken game. People keep giving them money so they have no reason to change. It's like a bunch of crackheads asking their dealer to stop stepping on the product even though they'll buy whatever is available
---
Xbox and a pc
---
I just extended my subscription today. Hooray
---
Wait until you get the industrial purifier =]     for me i sell a purified water at 5 caps and i have so many purifiers i can hit my camp real quick then go to a vendor and sell off bulk for a decent amount.  Its not the best method but its pretty solid
---
PS4. And as I write this post I got a single star Instigating Compound bow I plan to test during the weekend. Thanks.
---
He said permanent. Creepers will reck his world.
---
Idk if youve tryed conan exiles but i love it to pieces for building, theres servers for pvp, and pve so people wont destroy it, only thing to worry about is eventually a purge will come and attack it so building out of stronger materials and having thralls/followers to help protect it are important.
---
Working for me now and got my atoms as well. So dumb though how it cancels out the day before it renews
---
Awsome thanks for the info I'll have to try it next time I hop on
---
Oh my mistake.
---
They should really add vendors that charge exhorbitant amounts for basic gear....oh wait.
---
And then you face palm when you see why your camp couldn't be placed. Four foundations, a bunch of crafting stations and a stash box.
---
Those are in but not the deep pocketed for the armor
---
It’s actually convenient if you know you need to shut your vending machines down... that’s happened to me a few times
---
The regular one - yes.
---
The camo one in the Atom Shop, no.
---
Thanks! Maybe I'll use it as a BoS commando to do Brotherhood questes and then, seel it or gift it to make someone's day.
---
Wise words, I've gotten my money back this morning on my fallout first subscription, uninstalled the 2 games I had and wont ever buy shit they put out again.
---
Whatever reason the mods have, they have. Frankly karma means nothing to me, but believe what you want, sweetie.
---
Never heard of it, I'll check it out, thanks!
---
No idea, I'm configured as heavy gunner, not melee. If you test it please let us know results
---
I don't fluck over lower levels...I came from the lower levels...😐👍🤟
---
Yeah since patch 20 shielded et al mods are avail for gold
---
"only at 83?"  You do realize that the halfway point for the season was this past Tuesday, and the math shows that the "halfway level" is \~LVL64... so you are well ahead of pace, right?  You have 4.5 more weeks to just get just 17 levels.
---
7 days to die not great graphics bit mine craft but with zombies
---
I havent deleted but ive given up on it, i just bought ff14 with a friend a couple days ago and i dont see me coming back to fallout 76
---
Happened with me yesterday. I had to hear “finally someone with the guts to help” a few times
---
Portal knights is a good one a little childish but nice for building. I’ll look through my games there are a few you can build with that I have but that one off the top of my head
---
Good is the enemy of perfect
---
But there's a large margin of error when pricing legacies or top tiers. For example: an QE +END fixer. Not a tippy top tier, but defiently not a mid tier weapon either
---
Fed76 priced that around 30k. I got offers upwards of 80k pre and post dupe. I even looked up 5 different price check posts that ranged from a year old to a few weeks and it ranged from 70k - 120k 
---
And, if its accurate where it needs to be, which is the under 30k range, why would you state the price check from fed76 here? On an item that for sure is one of the most sought after weapons
---
I'm curious about this as well. I love the camp building aspect of FO76 and I am not bored or done with this game by any means, but I would like another (Xbox) game to try when I am done with this one.
---
the code would be for the Bnet launcher. unless it says on the packaging you can claim it on steam
---
I crafted the SS underarmor with some mod (i can’t remember the name, sry) So yes, it has been added.  You can buy it from that dude in the vault.
---
Edit: i believe he had 3 mods
---
seems to happen, at least to me, when using explosive legendaries or plasma/fire weapons, maybe its to do with particles? or maybe thats just my PS4 being old, im not sure
---
Delete it
---
going to NW or Atomic shop before going to adventure may auto complete all your challenges... just saying.
---
Gang shit 🤞✌🤙👊👍👌
---
Nah - it'll be delayed and release in 'around 2 weeks'.....
---
So it’s not available on Xbox unfortunately but you have to try “The Forest”! It’s such a good game. Its has a single player or an online option to have others join your world, and you have the option to turn on/off building destruction. It’s sooo fun, it’s definitely the best survival building game I’ve come across.
---
😂
---
Thats not the point.  They said they've been playing casually and they'll be done in 3 days.  Im not even close to being done in 3 days, probably another week and a half, but I wouldn't classify my play as casual.
---
Yes - lump things for a single quest together.
---
Also, can we get an item do not sell or use lock? I kept cooking my rad roach meat for dolly sods insect parts quest. They aren't hard to find but it's hard to keep track of everything I'm working on while doing events and legendary run dailies and weeklies.
---
Start drinking and playing, makes some of the situations more fun...
---
You should absolutely not use weapons that don't adhere to your build, otherwise you're wasting your perks.
---
OMG those are the worst! I have the same problem with them.
---
Shooting them in VATS is painful 3 or 4 shots to kill a damn firefly! But shoot them normally and they die first time.
---
I'm sure the VATS issues are latency related, I think it uses a different mechanism than normal aimed shooting.
---
I mostly use a .44 pistol. During Line in the Sand I use a 10 mm combat rifle with explosive rounds, but there is always lag between my shots and kills with that as my shots only wound. The lag with the .44 was in one-on-one fights. A few times I put extra rounds into a still falling corpse because it didn't immediately register the kill with xp.Not a big deal, but a noticeable difference.
---
I have had this glitch before. If you leave the server and come back it will usually reset to the correct amount.
---
The problem with that is that the cost doesn’t scale with the amount of caps you have. In the early game, I had to carefully consider fast traveling and make use of public team CAMPs, Vault 76, my own CAMP, and survival tent in order to minimize fast traveling costs. Now, in the 60s, I have enough caps to not care.
---
I know it is good: what I am asking is if it is THAT good compared to other glorious weapons which don't have the same "glow". My bloodied SMG + limb damage needs two bullets to the head to kill everything in WestTek, half a mag to put down a scorchbeast flying high, etc. My Bloodied Radium Rifle can do the same, and it melts humans. 
---
For example, my heavy gunner has a bloodied explosive minigun. And it is not THAT good. My executioner's faster fire plasma gatling outperforms it.
---
I left because of it. Making a game of my own cause COVID helped game companies be lazy and make poor decisions
---
To see what the daily challenges are and start completing them. Or if you’re near max caps and don’t want to mess with your vendors. Or if you’re joining a friend or someone from the trading sub for a transaction.
---
Sometimes it’s to get the daily challenge. But I’ve seen them buy just one 15-20 times in a row.
---
they are doing it for the challenges of "buy or sell an item to another player" single ammo purchases count for an easy complete
---
I only do this after visiting every camp to see if they have my caliber of ammo.
---
They are doing it for the s.c.o.r.e..
---
People are buying it to complete the daily SCORE challenge, not because they're cheap
---
If you find some hard to kill high level enemies in your quest areas just server hop (logoff - login) a couple times and thier level will adjust close to yours.
---
I get it...but can you imagine carrying 5 different bows irl?  Just blows the immersion for me.
---
People only do that to do the daily buy something from a player quest were not cheap we just don't need anything and it's the easiest thing to do. Why waste more caps than needed?
---
There’s also the Eyebot and Sentry helmets available. If you’re looking for them, I’d be happy to lend a hand if you’re on XB1.
---
Surely can't be because of the "Buy from or sell to another player (x3)" daily challenge.
---
Ring resets to empty after each update.
---
Uninstall. The game will be shutdown by next year
---
Ok thank you!!

Mostly joking because I play everyday.
---
Does the Stealth Suit work WITH Other Armor pieces or is it like wearing a Hazmat Suit?
---
For Bethesda reasons they make you do 3 separate purchases. It’s infinity levels of dumb.
---
the PVE mode on ARK would be a good fit for you if you liek building and dinos
---
Don't bite off more than you can chew. progress slowly.
---
Rather be Hawkeye than Green Arrow!
---
Like a hazmat...but it at least has DR/ER
---
Damn, wish I had good legendaries 😔
---
Oh cool I’m gonna try and get the sentry one, damn I’m on PS4 but I appreciate the help thanks!
---
I'll check it out, thanks!
---
Happening on console as well. Lots of disconnects and crashes.
---
No, I said under 10K, not under 30K. It starts rapidly breaking down beyond 10K as can be seen in the site itself giving a 26,000 cap range for a possible price.
---
I sell at half the low end price they give cause I just want rid of the stuff.  I'm strongly considering ceasing all sale of armor because the secret service armor destroyed that market.
---
I’ve been noodling on the Ammo Converter. At this point I wish it behaved more or less like a vendor. Sell your ammo to it for points, buy ammo from it in exchange for points.
---
Think the reason it has such a glow is because it does insane damage. At the end of the day it’s whatever you find most enjoyable
---
For realz bruh
---
I’ve never had an issue with looking at the atomic stop before adventure. Maybe I will keep to doing NW after because I’m one level away from the chicken coop and I’m not willing to risk it.
---
If you have any of the hanging bulb lights that flash like the vault tech blue and yellow, you can fairly easily get them to go inside the top part of garage doors (where the door rolls up into). Then you get the lighting effect with no visible bulbs
---
I enjoyed Conan exiles for a while, but it got boring quick, at least imo. The combat is extremely wonky, a lot of the better looking building stuff is behind paid DLCs. Idk if it would be a good fit.
---
Stop being so greedy. Some of us enjoy NW and like the benefit/challenge of getting the SCORE points for it. The balance is right too, one NW, the rest in adventure.   
---
It would negatively effect some people to give it all to one side.   
---
I also am a long term fallout fan, to break your silly stereotype.  
---
You're not forced to. The only people that are forced to do anything if they want to progress are the subset of players that play NW. Stop acting like a totalitarian elitist melt.
---
I feel your pain on issues of quality and game balance. However, I hate the “it’s all about money” complaints I see far too much. I mean, obviously...it’s a business. The modern model involves maximizing participation, often through free riders, and then monetizing wherever possible. If they didn’t, the game would not exist. They have to be able to make at least a fraction of FIFA money to be considered viable by execs and investors. That means monetize monetize monetize.
---
Having said that, I agree that some of this is a real trainwreck. Everybody knows it, it’s been in the newspapers. Removing or adjusting caps would probably help. They should definitely consider the ESO model for events...a loot box appears at the end and everyone gets decent, level appropriate rewards. There might be some freeloading under that model but...who cares? The majority will try to help in some way. 
---
This game has a lot of issues but they are somewhat alleviated by my play style...which is to ignore the “meta,” SCORE, daily’s and achievements and just play the game, doing quests and things I enjoy. Might feel different when I reach level 400, but I probably never will. I play most games to “end” and move on. Once there is nothing left but repeating quests and events it’s pretty much over until the next DLC drops anyway. Hopefully thongs will feel fresh for you when that happens for FO76.
---
I'll take a look, thanks!
---
Depending on what I’m farming, it’s usually hit up Whitespring then off the west tek, then the satellite array just north of there, then to hawkes refuge, then over to sugar grove, then to harpers ferry, then follow the road to the galleria(usually don’t bother going inside), then I head south to the generals steak house, then clear out those BoS camps down in the bog. Then off to bog town. Then I head over to fort defiance and then to the monorail elevator. That usually gets me enough screws, springs, lead and ballistic fibre to last a few days plus extra to sell. And those places usually gets me at least 4-5 legendaries on a bad day, 8-10 on a good day. Usually along the way I find what I need to clear my daily objectives. It takes awhile to complete the route but I get everything I need by running it. Then I head back to my camp right beside the top of the world, scrap and bulk my goodies and process my haul, any good legendaries go into the vendor and the rest of the crap goes to the scrip machine. If I still have scrip left in the machine then I’ll head out again and run some events with guaranteed legendary spawns to cap it out.
---
You can learn it by scrapping Assaultron heads or military grade circuit boards. Good luck!
---
So they can hotfix stuff? Interesting.
---
Thanks for posting this. I remember when they patched this bug before for enemy instant health regen. Hopefully more people will notice it and they’ll get it taken care of. In the meantime, see you around the wasteland :).
---
Haha yeah it is small. I just look at damage. I can usually plant it in the middle of a crowd. If you’re putting up your explosive damage perk card then it’s worth using explosive weapons. The perks will effect that explosion as well.
---
I gotta rant more about it honestly. You have the entire map to build on and it really feels like a good grind to get the supplies needed. The AI of the enemies is crazy, if you let any get away, they learn how you play and respond to it, but if you kill them they don’t. Playing at night in game time feels as anxiety inducing as dying light at night, and the enemies are crazy! There’s deep cave exploration to find better tools, the game looks so pretty too, you’re stuck on a deserted island with manic tribals and science experiments.
---
“Indefinitely delayed”
---
Just like the dems, they don't want to put the embarrassment in the spotlight.
---
For me it's become an issue is the travel distance / cost justified the time. If I'm in a hurry I just do it, if I'm low on caps or actively working on building caps I'll travel to nearby free locations first, such as teammates, their camps, etc. (I have 4 level 100+  characters)
---
Steggie sorus house hee hoo
---
Peaceful mode will work. Or even Creative if you don't mind being a bit cheat-y and/or don't want to bother with gathering materials.
---
Alrighty then. Thanks for the insults, come again.
---
To be honest, it's a pretty terrible weapon. I'll do you a favour and trade you 3 spoiled meat for it?
---
If it’s a server side issue they can.  If fixing something involves adjusting client side files that’s when a patch has to be downloaded
---
How do you send a message?  I didn't know you could as I thought it was emoji or voice?
---
Iintresting, I'll have a look!
---
Honestly I’m optimistic about it this time because they’ve already fixed it once before. Thanks for commenting :-)
---
well it's kinda like real life, all the successful, law abiding people I know wouldnt give someone a dime, and all the either homeless people,  addicts from before I got clean, recovering addicts, and ex criminals would literally give you the shirt off their back...funny how that works
---
Yesterday the game was crashing all the time for me. Opened pip boy, crash. Turn in quest, crash losing half the quest items and getting none of the rewards. Go to my camp to find out I'm out of ballistic fiber, crash. Auto run thru the forest trying to get to somewhere, crash.
---
If you liked fallout for the lore and like to find mini stories through notes, holotapes and terminals then yes, it does indeed satisfy the fallout itch for probably just as long as a single player fallout game if not more.
---
Oh wow your tesla only registers 20ish shots?
---
It is for me.  The game will stutter then lock up for about 30 seconds then slowly come back. After it did this to me last night, the first hit on every creature would not register.
---
Better yet, ask a friend to make an alt char, let him buy it, delete character. Goodbye list. For-EVER
---
Okay, I'm starting not to feel as bad... I hardly every change out of my unyielding armor due to all the stat benefits, carry weight and running a bloodied build. My overall goal is rolling for Secret Service armor that I just learned about.
---
Oooh sounds fun
---
Yeah I do that from time to time whenever STASH  and Caps permit.
---
Scrip is usually not an issue considering I can go get legendary modules from Mama Mumbles.
---
i can feel that i'm getting slightly burnt out from the LR. i'm at level 89 and that's why i'll purchase the last levels tonight. i'm sitting on 6500 atoms anyway. so this weekend i can go back to do whatever please me in game after 5 weeks of challenges and xp grinding.
---
You're only getting 3 caps out of the deal, hardly much of a windfall.
---
It costs more than that to fast travel there.
---
is it still possible to go raider after they mark you hostile in your early level 20s
---
Like I just want them to say we're not going change these limits. It's obvious they won't because they intended on them being this way. It's not a bug it's the design
---
By completing steel early we should of had a bonus to start dumping next item early
---
Hornwright Executives would like a word with you
---
damn you were leveling up more then once an hour, anyways... since you are not going to be using it, could you re install the game and give me all your inventory} would be very nice of you
---
This subbreddit will not give you an accurate measure of the game. Some people love it, some people hate it. It works great for some, not at all for others. My advice would be to play it yourself and decide.
---
Boomer does all the time. I can't skip dialog and have to let him slowly fucking do a Ted talk.
---
Rad shield also will not suppress your mutations if you're looking for more rad resist
---
I quit the game till it's not a glorified mobile game anymore.
---
MY FIRST GOLD. THANK YOU RANDOM WASTELANDER
---
Don't rush through it. There's so much fun to be had, but once you get to the "end game"...eh. I would also recommend you start thinking about what kind of build you want ahead of time so you don't find yourself with perks that don't serve you (not to worry though, you'll be able to reassign them even if you do fudge up). Have fun!
---
That’s what I liked about them, Meg takes in all the waifs and strays no matter what they’ve done. Paige just looks down his righteous nose at you.
---
Should be free tbh
---
No it doesn't. Bethesda needs to stop relying on modders. Otherwise why am I even paying Bethesda and not the modders directly. The community and Bethesda relying on modders is why their games are a complete joke in comparison to other games
---
Oh, I just messaged him through Xbox chat
---
Fallout 3 had a keyring. Why cant Fo4 anf 76 have that keyring?
---
Or let us drop duplicate keys and keycards.
---
1. Don't read Reddit
---
2. Just play the game.
---
Best $15 dollars I ever spent! Buy it today and don’t look back.
---
Interesting idea, but wouldn't this also apply to guns as well? The gun doesn't have the ability to do explosive or anti-armor, the bullet does. One could argue that the creature-specific effects would come from the bullet instead of the gun.
---
But if we're applying logic, how does a gun heal you when you shoot someone? Why does a gun work better at night? How does a gun give you more protection when you're aiming it? It's all craziness. We just have to accept that we're living in a Bethesda world, with Bethesda rules (to be fair, they are not the only developer that treats weapons this way).
---
The top comment right now from /u/Shockwave_IIC I think is the biggest functional issue. If you have two bows, and 3 arrow types, how do you easily switch between them? Right now, you can favorite an item and it shows up on the wheel. Would you have to favorite both bows and all three arrows, then select a bow, and then select an arrow? What happens if you don't have a bow active, and you select an arrow - which bow comes up? And even if they make this work, do I really want to tie up 3-5 slots just for a bow?
---
If Fallout 76 had an "alternate fire" mode (like Borderlands 3, for example) this could totally work. But it would be quite a re-work, and like I said at the beginning of this, it should really apply to everything, not just bows.
---
If all you read out of what I wrote was the criticism of your behaviour, and you didn't take any of the other points in, have a read again.  
---
Do you feel you're better than people and deserve to deprive some of the community of access to a feature in their game mode of choice?  
---
Or had you not looked at it that way and maybe need to have a think?
---
We’ll you haven’t actually played it...
---
It was the MAIN QUEST of wastelanders. There was no grind to complete it, that came afterwards. If you want people to take you seriously play it at least.
---
How about Near Death Experience? He died, but came back from it so he could tell his story.
---
This bug has been around for at least a couple months.  It's why I load up my machines then go to my stash to see everything that's being sold and if I have duplicates I cancel sale of both and then go back to the vendor to reprice it as a full stack again.
---
We're buying 1 ammo at a time for the SCORE challenge, and we don't want to buy your shitty pile of mounted  bloodbug plans at 300 caps a piece.
---
The Colossal Problem delay was probably a colossal problem for their planned agenda.
---
Try Junkies. You can have high Dr/er, damage output is great, very little if any drawbacks from chem/alcohol addictions. Its way more versatile then Bloodied. 
---
I fucked up my beta character and rectified my mistakes by experimenting with a gimmick build (Berserkers, Bloodied, Junkies). Junkies seemed to be the most logical choice. And if you use stealth on top of the healing factor mutation. You should never die.
---
theyll never do that, they want you to spend money on fallout first to get the tent as your third free fast travel....they got me actually contemplating it for the junk box since my freaking stash is full after only playing for 3 days and idk wtf to get rid of.
---
But on a serious note are you all really that tight up for caps that you need it, cuz I've definitely been doing pretty good in the cap area, could give yall some tips ;)
---
Yesterday I had a few freezes.one of the times my xbox x actually shutdown..wtf?checked it for overheating but seemed ok.
---
That grounded game has building in it. Only seen people build so I have no clue what the basis of the game is.
---
yep. better be safe than sorry. there's a lot of posts in the sub from players who had this issue. also Chicken coop is nice. i think it's the best rewards along with the tree, the monkey backpack and the sheepsquatch plushie.
---
That seems a different issue, maybe it is connect ed though. My blackwoodsman challenge says 10/10, it just didn't give me any atoms.
---
y'know I never put that together.
---
..and that's another parallel, 'cause obviously the devs are heavy drinkers :)
---
not all bugs are bad :)
---
Used to happen in Fallout 4 alot. It happened every time when you spoke with Preston in Sanctuary for the first time
---
All the other ones get wallpaper, just not the wooden ones.
---
Grounded. It just dropped as a Game Preview for Xbox so it's still a work in progress. Even so, just the basic build mechanics offer quite a bit already and the first update is scheduled for the end of this month. Doing a quick YouTube search will showcase some incredible structures.
---
Really depends on why you are logging in.  Sometimes I might  just jump on for a trade or to sell scrip.  What does it matter for those times, I'm just gonna go to White Spring, do what I need to do, and then log out right after.
---
10 caps a piece per plan, any plan.
---
It was sarcasm
---
Don't even get me started with mouse wheeling to change weps
---
I will when you stop complaining about people complaining about your complaining.
---
This is one of those awesome ideas where my only reaction can be "how in the hell did I not think if this?!"
---
I love my sheepsquatch plushie. It’s so cute! I only wish I had gotten the other plushies when they were available like the crocolossus.
---
Enjoy your alcohol and crappy floater grenades.
---
Im always wondering whether it'll be Anthem or Fallout 76 that gets the boot lol. I know Anthem is being completely revamped but if that doesn't get canned it's pretty much certainly a whole new game people will have to buy. Bethesda has Way bigger problems to hash out that I don't see getting done into they completely start from scratch with a new engine and they're determined to not do that
---
Oh I did. I'm just a selfish brat, got it.
---
-addition- yeah, it's like I haven't been spending hours talking to people this whole thread about how NW needs to just have it's own shit or anything. But yes, I'm just a fucking selfish asshole who doesnt think about other people, including people like myself who don't step a fucking foot in NW because it's a garbage fire Fortnite wannabe.
---
That too. Had a mongrel dog spawn under my resource collector last night. I store the collector to get at him and he is trapped under the bloody gound.  Aggravating as hell.
---
I do that occasionally with random stuff, just sell it at crazy prices for the lols. Like a sledgehammer for 6969. I usually don't expect to sell that sort of stuff, although once I listed a junkies combat rifle for 30k as a joke with a buddy, amd someone bought it the next day.
---
You can build some nice things in Ark too...
---
Oh ._.
---
That...really sucks. Resource gathering is never exactly “fun” but this just makes things an unnecessary pita, especially with the crap resource respawn rates. Also makes moments that could feel epic turn into kaka, like the mission ruining enemy resetting I mentioned.
---
Oh well. I guess it’s still fun in many particulars but...guess I’ll spend a few hours desperately seeking screws and ballistic fiber while hoping no one respawns a dozen godlike enemies on top of my head.
---
I had to server hop during the astronaut quest line whenever the doctor came to my camp. He’d be somewhere else, Sofia would say one line then nothing. Leave conversation and she’s stuck. Server hop, all good.
---
How do the legendary modules work? I actually have 0 idea what they do
---
how true. if you could play the game in a vacuum, without any influence from social media, I think people would generally enjoy the game a lot.
---
lol I've been having a much larger problem today, my stash is 794/800, I've only been playing for 3 days and I'm so damn lost on how to fix this issue. Idk what to drop what to keep, and idk how in the hell people have so much stuff for sale.
---
"/s" is for sarcasm.
---
Just make ammo scrap into components at say 25 to 50 percent loss. It's that simple they did it NV over a decade ago. We don't need yet another currency
---
It’s a very different game. But you could give rimworld a shot. I know there’s a bunch of mods where you can make it into fallout or any other game. It has base building but it’s not exactly the same. It’s my second most played game on steam, behind fallout 76.
---
?? What makes them cheap? It's the exact same price if you buy it 1 at a time or 5000 at a time. Also, you still get the tax, it keeps track of it across purchases. Just like how uneven numbers like 225 will sometimes have give you 202 and sometimes 203 caps depending on how close you are to rolling over that decimal tax
---
they will eventually came back in the Atomic shop.
---
There's "the forest" it has been out for a while  so it wouldn't be too expensive by now either.
---
It always happens to my quad salvaged assaultron head.
---
The base building in No Man's Sky is pretty good. Freighter 'building' isn't as elaborate as the planetary base builds, but it's there. 
---
You can always build multiple bases throughout the galaxy if you get tired of one.
---
The game itself is so much better now too.
---
750 one star is pretty expensive. I wouldn't be buying at your shop haha
---
Patch notes;
---
- keys will no longer appear in the world if you already have picked them up once before. 
---
- also sorry but something went wrong and your keyrings are now empty, but due to the previously mentioned new feature you can no longer retrieve these keys again.
---
Yep. Got my copy for ten bucks at GameStop and have played every day since. I absolutely love it, well worth it. You'll see a lot of negative posts on here about this patch or that bug and "why can't they fix ___" whatever, but that's only because the player base is so passionate about the game, they all really just want the best from it. And some people just want to hate on it, but that's to be expected 😅
---
You're forced to play? Is this, some sort of, experiment? *cough*
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tranquility_Lane
---
Looking for: 
---
50cal and 5mm, recently shotgun shells
---
Power armor plans, especially T-60 but I know it’s rare
---
Stimpaks because for some reason I either have 90 or 20
---
It happens when you complete a score challenge inside armor. You don't get the points sometimes until you exit. Why yours is stuck on a loop is a mystery though.
---
U is for us, you and meeee
---
There will be no more 3 star legendary items from world enemies. hfgl
---
and yet how many of their titles have you played to know this? lol
---
This makes sense so they will never do it.
---
It should be a toggable option in the main menu. I've personally have never opted out.
---
now if we could just get one for our camp.
---
It’s free on Xbox right now
---
Y........................ E................................... S.
---
They have nothing new. The most they have is A Colossal Problem gameplay and even then it's not new given PTS players have been able to play it for a while
---
God I wish.
---
And, bug aside, are you certain you aren’t just experiencing karma/vengeance from the head of the assaultron you killed to get that weapon? I don’t believe in robot ghosts or anything but, you know ... I’ve seen some things :p
---
Yeah I’ve noticed my ammo sales have slowed a little too. I have hundreds of .45 sitting in my machine rn when a few weeks ago it would have been snapped up in minutes for for thirsty fixers.
---
Not only that, but I assume because of the nature of 76 modders will face additional challenges.
---
Changes would need to be applicable across all platforms. With an online service it's going to create heat when all 3 platforms are playing the same game of signifintly different qualities, especially with how restrictive Sony is regarding mods. 
---
Not to mention how Bethesda would manage this outside of private worlds. If mods are only available to 1st members, this community will go haywire. The backlash would be notable. 
---
I
---
Haha yeah the prices sometimes make me laugh. Last night saw a dude selling most 3 stars for 30,000 like a berserker 3 star who uses berserker on anything and if they did why would they buy for max caps?
---
Nope, it's a well-known issue.
---
I would pay 5k atoms to have a cat at my camp.
---
Yw, just a little heads up - it will be rough in your 20/30s if you level up a new char and don't have the necessary perks, weapons and armor (yet) to make this work. But I guess that's the case with most builds :-)
---
Thats what they aimed at doing but it failed. Should have made somthing along the lines of a reloading bench.
---
You’re not being “forced” and it’s only 1 challenge. 
---
I could understand if have the challenges were NW, but it’s just one and most of the time it’s real easy.
---
😧 kitty catsssss
---
i love this
---
Side with the Free Radicals against The Wayward. It's the only way to get their mask cosmetic (and actually results in less people dying).
---
Junkyard tech, sometimes not the best.
---
NW players should have an opportunity to get SCORE too. If you look at it from their view, they don't get XP score and only one challenge. Some of my friends only play NW. They could equally say add more.
---
What are the odds this is a pre-recorded demo? To big a risk of bugs and game breaking issues to do live
---
I had this happen after one of the SBQ fights.
---
Honestly if they just gave us the ability to scrap ammo it would be way better.
---
I’m always checking the back page with the free items and one day found the nuka cola cooler and can store extra cranberry relish. It seems like at least one sale cycles daily?
---
Is it trash?:  No.
---
Is it good?: Yes.
---
Is it the greatest thing that Todd Howard ever announced to the world?: No.
---
Not noticing lag but one of my missions is glitched. I can’t analyze the blood sample...
---
I love the train station, and now that I have a 'legacy' camp I won't be moving unless forced.
---
Its registering all the shots? (Admittedly i havent heard the idea of registered hits since valve games) I just mean i blast my 60 round clip into say a mirelurk queen but it doesnt kill it ill just bash and instead of reloading i have a half full ish clip instantly ready to fire.
---
I'd say absolutely. A common bashing topic for the game is that it has no story, but that couldn't be more wrong. If you rush through all the quests, don't read terminals, notes or pay attention to your environment, yeah sure. But if you DO all those things, there is so much to explore and things to learn - about the years leading up to the war, and the years right after.
---
Also if you're casual - /r/fo76filthycasuals is a very comfortable place.
---
I was being serious.
---
Fallout 4 with DLC and mods.  Loads of fun.
---
I would like a way to permanently remove preexisting structures and other items, like the unusable water purifier on the pond in my camp. It should extend to the broken down equipment and vehicles as well, items that don't have the ability to hold/spawn loot.
---
Perception +4
---
Oh, they have, likely. And I agree, y'all should get something special for NW you can only have in NW. Extra perk packs, skins, whatever else it is you get exclusive, idk.
---
But if I want nothing to do with NW I shouldn't have to. If you guys just wanna PVP your way through the game you should get to do that too.
---
You are damn lucky. I've not had one player ever visit my camp or help me with anything. But I'm glad that people do these sorts of things.
---
So your the guy who got 2 b2525 fixers, could have traded them for a million caps worth of legacies but held onto them, only to now see their value drop so low that they are being traded for junk and caps? Wierd flex. I bought 2 for 30k caps each.
---
Almost 3000 hrs in and I have yet to let these bugs get the victory. The game is a bit broken, and yeah, bethesda really needs to step their shit up and figure it out, but also, imo, this game is still freaking great and is still fairly easy to play with all the bugs included. Thats just me tho
---
I agree with you and I'm just about there.  It's been 2 years, this is as good as it gets.
---
We do, and yeah I fucking remember!
---
Thanks for wasting all of ours.
---
That’s the main reason to play this game is because of the community. As most games have trolls but I have only run into 2 so far (and I’m lvl 156) as pvp is non existent and there is a heavy emphasis on teamwork which is why this game is so enjoyable as there are no try hards screaming about their k/d and how trash you are. Tbh I play this game and modern warfare and see myself playing more fo76 as I can enjoy it not worry about my skill or performance.
---
INB4, downvotes.
---
TLDR; I disagree with the FO76 community being that great.
---
I keep reading about the FO76 community being so amazing. But I have not experienced it. Whenever it’s mentioned I read about new players receiving items. Okay, that’s nice. Why? Who knows. But altruism is often not the reason. What I know so far is that a lot of people got so much stuff they have to throw it away. So giving it to a new player seems like a better alternative. Why? Who knows. But altruism is often not the reason. 
---
What I have experienced more than often is people saying how easy things are, and how they do a lot of damage, and if you aren’t nice (not mean, just not nice) to them, they’ll keep bothering you. And the lack of understanding that some people don’t care about their elitist builds and meta play style. Sharing things? Fuck no. One shot blast the fuck out of Legendaries. First come, first serve. In EVERYTHING. 
---
In my opinion the FO76 community is nothing special and doesn’t deviate from any other game community. It doesn’t draw in a special kind of people. It’s the same people we always know. 
---
As far as I can tell, the only thing that people define as this great community is people dropping their trash for new players. Sure you can sell stimpaks, but you’re probably already maxed on caps. (30k) And sure it helps the new players to get started. But quite fast becomes trash as well. And who really NEEDS it. It’s not like you start off near Watoga. Are they bored? Need ego stroking by being “noble”? Don’t want to just drop stuff? Or maybe they’re genuinely altruistic? Who knows. But from my experience, the community is not that S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
And yes I know what you’re thinking. This is probably an unpopular opinion, but I want to give it some sound anyway. It was being a rather one sided perspective on the matter on here.
---
In short make it so that I don’t have to play everyday I’m okay with once a week or at least 3 time a week but everyday seems like a chore to me
---
PC or Console?
---
Damn I bet the devs read this and are sad now
---
K bye
---
Never mind just saw the question flair.
---
I'm up for it.
---
I like how they fix tricks that actually make building better but not anything that actually hinders the game.  Interesting enough they keep attacking the people who are buying the atoms. Seems like a bad choice.
---
Why? - simply because I can.  
---
After tons of SBQ I have tons of repair kits and they take my  stash space.  
---
If they were meant to be used **ONLY** in the wild, then there shouldn't be a button to repair item using them on workbench. Another one - you may just be out of resources needed for fixing items.
---
Maybe they delayed the Fo76 Quakecon until next month too.
---
Install the PS Messages app on your phone and send the screenshots to yourself from PS4. Open the message on your phone and save the attachment.
---
I encountered that one yesterday! Cutest thing I've seen since launch. I talked to the bot and he told me to take them to Wixon Homestead (I think), but there was no quest and I couldn't find a way to make them follow me. Tried taming too.
---
Don't forget to uninstall.
---
OR NOT VATS DAMAGE WHEN YOU HIT THEM OR NO RESPAWN BUG!!  I HATE HAVING TO RUN 1,000 FEET JUST TO FAST TRAVEL OR KILL MYSELF JUST TO FAST TRAVEL....or just click it 20 times, you know :) the usual
---
Only the fire damage from the flamer mod matters, and that is not boosted by perks. Adrenal Reaction alone can push it up to 20, which is a LOT more than it sounds since almost nothing is resistant to it. The single digit ballistic damage is completely negligible.
---
Not so much lag but have been seeing and hearing about a lot of game crashes since the update. I had maybe 2 game crashes in the last month before tuesday, and hadn't heard of many from friends but in the last few days i have had 19 crashes and a lot of my friends have had simmilar problem. Just last night i was screwing around with a friend and he crashed and then the game crashed each time he tried to boot up the game for a good 10 minutes
---
And cooked with súper duper perk even more if triggered:)
---
That's Danse personally believing in more honour than the regular chatter. If you bring Hancock to Boston Airport or the Prydwen, random BoS members will ask if "that thing" is "tame", with some comments suggesting to just shoot him
---
l haven’t tried to tame one yet.   Supposedly it’s possible
---
I sell everything I don't need dirt cheap, plans and recipes for 1 cap, all chems I sell for 10 or under. good legendary that I have better of I sell for max 100 caps, even god rolls that don't appeal to my play style will be 1000 max.
---
The problem is that you'll get mid to high levels roll up and buy everything cheap the resell at stupid prices, I have followed a couple of the greedy fucks to there camp, stuff the buy from me for 1 cap the put up for upto 500 caps.
---
You try to help others but theres always greedy fucks to ruin it.
---
\*shrug\* A one star Bloodied handmade goes for that fairly regularly. Frankly, you probably don't need it anyhow.
---
I like how the current number (220m as of posting) flies past the progress bar so fast you can't read it.
---
As someone who is over level 350 on my main. The XP stuff is exactly what makes the Legendary Run a chore. While there are exploits and buffs that can make this easier, it's still a pain for high levels to level up normally in the game and that's really the only way to grind score with the current setup since all the other things are limited and usually only take like an hour max to do with a couple exceptions. Even the weeklies are easily knocked out in a couple hours.
---
They lowered the deathclae hide drop rate drastically when they released those badges
---
The funny thing is that after all these different grinds built into the game, when I finally complete the season I will have none left. I already got ally with both factions and I have all the SS and faction plans I want for this character (non-powerarmor / non-energy build). I guess that means freedom?
---
This is cool OP.  First time I’ve seen this.  I saw the chicken chase encounter the other day which was funny
---
PoS? F3 BoS also helped the people
---
Same issue. Random crashes over the last few days including one in middle of scorchqueen. Got sick of it, found I had windows that could be upgraded, updated GPU drivers, and even deleted cache folders cause the game wasn't launching. Got everything to work again, and the game keeps crashing again. Aggravating
---
I want my time back from reading this waste of text
---
That’s not entirely accurate. When the game was released server stability was pretty aweful. They did a lot of things in the back end that allowed stash space to increase to 600 and later to 800 lb. they continued to make improvements to the servers until they were able to offer unlimited scrap space. I’m not a fan of the scrap box but you need to know it would not have been possible to implement at launch. 
---
Also there is a difference between storing unlimited scrap vs unlimited everything. 1 steel and 1000000 steel take up exactly the same amount of space in a database. It’s a single attribute. Compare that to something like weapons that can have 100s of possible combinations with mods and therefore take up a lot of additional server strain to load and track. 
---
Again, you are a backseat developer because you think things are more simple than they are. You also seem to have a lot of facts wrong.
---
&gt;sells off rifle for 34 caps 
---
&gt;vendor puts it up for sale at 200 caps
---
Certain gear calls for them. The Gauss Minigun requires them and you get a chance of a gauss minigun with 1 2 or 3 legendary perks.
---
Where has that been proven, I'd love to see it
---
Mods on private servers on 1st is the only way they could work. Honestly I'm surprised you're even able to just jump back and forth between servers.
---
except most people don't use mods
---
If you like Fallout 4 gameplay you most likely gonna enjoy F76 for more or less. Just don't expect to much from it and keep in mind that it is worse game than Fallout 4 almost in every way. I'm probably gonna be disliked to the oblivion for saying that because people on this sub is super defensive about F76 and they take every bad word about this game as a personal offence but I'm telling you the truth.
---
You know that feeling when you done with the main story and majority of side quest in other Fallout games? Like you know you basicaly already beat the game but still have some unfinished quests and some unexplored locations but it doesn't feel the same because you already completed the main story. Well here the whole game is kinda like that... Quests is kinda meh, world is kinda empty, etc.
---
You either become addicted to some aspect of F76 and gonna play it alot or you gonna drop it after reaching soft level cap (50) and after you finished some quests.
---
That’s hilarious.
---
In my experience, I had a dude following my female character around whispering in a creepy voice, “joiinnn theeeee Enclaveeeeee”
---
Obviously not OP but I guess the option for teams can make it unfair. Like, you can solo it and are now in the top 5 and then you get hit by a full team who managed to survive til the end isn't the fairest fight, I guess.
---
Conan Exiles
---
They did something to teslas i think. Something about them not hitting enemies properly and i have heard that it changed how it chains and the particles for the tesla
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Its bethesda game PTSD, BGPTSD for short, caused by nonsensical updates that make life harder and harder for all vault dwellers
---
The other walls are all fine with wallpapers which is why I hadn't noticed it, I've only been using the brick or contemporary set for the last year. 
---
Started a new character today which is why I noticed the problem with the wood set.
---
This "bug" isn't back because it was never gone, nor patched out. It's (probably) a latency issue, which no amount of patching will fix.
---
topic is the Colossus boss event
---
This is an issue - it’s evident on Fort Defiance for people looking for asylum outfits.  
---
However, there is also an in game counter for items.  So if you looted an area X amount of hours ago, the items won’t respawn till Y occurs.   BUT, there’s also a counter to reset based on how many items have been looted (it’s like 255).  So if you loot that many items in say, Whitesprings, the first items should start res pawning.
---
The second part of your issue it appears is you are under-leveled for some of the areas you might be in
---
Grounded
---
Learn how leveling up works. You'll still be adjusting/tweaking your build past 50, but try to avoid making really bad decisions early on.
---
Don't just pick perks because they sound fun at the moment, try to understand what and why you're choosing.
---
Lol what their games being buggy messes is literally a meme they themselves got in on. Luckily they have the PR God Allfather Todd to smooth out public outcry
---
The flamer mod made all the difference for me.
---
Yeah, now install it.
---
Literally can’t even load the game without crashing
---
I have this happen almost every time with Blackeye, but not with any of the other NPCs
---
Well shit now I'm even more flabbergasted lol
---
Just don't trade maybe ? Unless that's the core reason why you play then carry on
---
Fallout 4
---
How do you have a daily AND a weekly cap limit? That makes no sense.
---
Was fighting a scorchbeast and went to change weapons, screen basically froze for about 15 seconds
---
Haven’t spent a single lunch box. Play maybe an hour a day. Am rank 79. 8 hours to complete the daily’s? What?  Most are just playing the game. Events. Kill legendarys. Build stuff. Don’t let the door hit you in the arse on the way out
---
That's okay, have you tried Kenshi?  It's dope if you're into post-apocalyptic survival games with base building, crafting, and diverse factions.
---
But but... The intro to fallout 3 told me I was S.P.E.C.I.A.L. :(
---
Yeah this is with my alt as well, not brand new but when I built my current camp I didn’t yet have the other plans. Well, at least there’s a solution, don’t use wood if you want shutters
---
This can't have enough upvotes.
---
I might raffle it here, with the nice people of r/fo76. I will try it for a week and see if it is thaaaaat superior.
---
You have a daily as well as a weekly limit for gold bullion already... There are different ways to implement this, you just have to think about a little ;-) but I see that it's not that easy and obvious...
---
These are the basics above.
---
I'm not sure if someone in a public group can join into personal instances, but I'm pretty sure they cannot, however I know that personal instances can be joined by private team members.
---
Basically any personal instances should only be available to you and your team. But like he mentioned, some of the instances are public instances. The ones that are personal are primarily the ones added for the story with the wastelanders update. Other instances from the vanilla game are likely all still public.
---
Look how money fly at them. No wonder they are never fixing their games. If i would get money for free i wouldn't work either, can't blame them
---
Ok. Ciao
---
Traveling solo across all areas of the map with no specific destination is my favorite part of this game
---
The game already has folders. We could use those.
---
I want to make sure you know I’m not taking your comment lightly, but I will say this was pretty concretely acknowledged as a bug in the past. I think you agree with that but you are saying that it was never actually fixed and its main source may have always been latency in the first place? 
---
I only ask because I have been shootin em dead beautifully before the patch and now both my friends and I have noticed it back to the way it was before in regards to one shot builds. Do you think that it has to do with the recent patch causing issues with server latency then? I am of course a hard wired gamer with the highest speed Internet my provider affords a civilian lol, so hopefully you are right and it is just server latency.
---
I finished a few today to grind out the nuka cola pack in the atom shop with no problem
---
What are you talking about? They are raising money for charity and it’s less than $5k right now.
---
Agreed, I just do challenges and haven’t really had the time to actually play the game like before. It would be better if we just had a higher weekly and no daily challenges so we can enjoy the game more.
---
It’s annoying I agree.  Especially if you’re in a desirable area eg has two resource nodes
---
One time I joined a server after getting the message just wanted to check out the challenges.  I got distracted doing some stuff, did a challenge and decided to try and tame something.  Spent an hour doing so, tamed a sloth, only to remember that I had joined a server without my CAMP.   🤦‍♂️
---
When politics infects your gaming life you should seek some help. You're programmed my friend.
---
Fallout 3 BoS were shunned by the west coast main BoS, the BoS outcasts are more in line with the real BoS' behavior
---
Sooo TL:DR - yet another person figures out that a MMO doesn't play like a single player RPG, and writes up an essay to avoid accepting that it's not for them
---
This is so stupid. If it feels like wasted time, you got other underlying issues. Videogames are for free time. They are also the most cheapest form of entertainment out there, literally. An experience of 2 hours in the theater costs you what? 20$? While a 20-60$ videogame like Fo76 can last you what? Days? Weeks? And you still complain about bullshit like this come on bro
---
Known issue with the future tec skin. Remove it and your vendors will be visible again.
---
"Fallout 4 is the best of the series". It is clear that you did not play Fallout1, Fallout2, Fallout New Vegas. I am right?
---
No, I made it through okay.
---
If they ever came here, they stopped a long time ago. This place is an absolute shithole towards them and has been for pretty much ever
---
So it might be that only some challenges are bugged, which maybe would make it more difficult to fix.
---
But no one can hurt o kill the pet.
---
Haha I’m not political usually. The comment just seemed to fit.
---
By the way these are just suggestions from my side. I think it's not my job to create a much better design, I just can think about a solution. I only want to complain about it and as a customer it's my right to things out I am not satisfied with.
---
Lmfao yeah
---
It just works
---
Dailies took me 30 minutes to complete. What I am doing wrong? :(
---
Key ring and a Journal? PLEASE
---
Same thing happened to me. Ran to the loot pile and all I got to read was “Furious Minigun*+” ..then poof it was gone. Very disappointed since at the time I used about half of my ammunition to take the darn thing out.
---
Who knows but poo poo of Bethesda and money rather than releasing what they say they will do upvote! If I hadn’t spent my money on atoms so I could fondle God Todd I would award gold
---
Yup. 1 2 and 3 * since the newest patch.
---
No registrer due ur internet issues or problems on the server. It sucks when u play with 10% of health.
---
Golf balls
---
Thank you. I’m actually making a build very similar to this and I think this will be very helpful. Aside from mutations.
---
Occasionally I have an issue where if I die it spawns me inside the nuke zone. I run a bloodied build so I barely have enough time to open the fast travel menu to get out but I was over encumbered so I just died...twice
---
Damn. I got shat on for saying something similar a while ago. Susprise you haven't receive the same reception. I hope the game was fun while it lasted for you though.
---
Atleast we know they endure just like us lmfao
---
I dont know what these guys are on about but the rest of us are doing it only to you as part of a very complicated scheme to slowly drive you insane.  Before you know it we will have you yelling at cartoon rats with your shirt off. Ciao babe.
---
Good. Means it will be something they won't nerf
---
I had this for months before finding the issue. For your damage numbers and what not, go to your documents, my games, fallout 76, and make sure all the .ini files are not set to read-only. Then there should be some folders that are strings of numbers and letters, with "localaccountstate.bgs" inside. Make sure that's not read-only as well, they determine your atom shop preferences
---
I would've given away so many stimpacks if I could then but I didn't have the plans. 
---
Now that I do, it's time to give back and maybe more... MIRV LAUNCHERS FOR EVERYONE!
---
Im screaming , this is embarrassingly broken
---
This gives me hope, that I hope are not false hopes.  
---
Anyway, when we say "increase script limit" is something on the levels of ammo converter. 100.000 scrip seems an OK amount to hold at a time. This plus no limit for daily exchange
---
Crops and the spring tree/bush decorations are actually useful for getting rid of that you can.  My camp has trees I placed that hide dead/fallen trees.  There are some things that won't go away though.
---
Vault 94? What am I missing here ?!
---
4 hours playing yesterday and I kept getting the score update over and over and over but I wasn’t doing anything. Had to log out as the chime drove me up a wall
---
People are literally dm'ing me telling me that i am a cheater and they are happy i'm gone lol. 
---
Crazy stuff.
---
I’m a bloody build myself so I understand the 10% health bit but I’m also a network technician and strange flex aside, I can assure you it’s not my Internet. Another commentor noted that it’s probably server latency itself and due to the recent patch causing so many people to have disconnects and lag, I think I may agree with that. The simpler the issue the happier I am because the less work Bethesda will need to input to resolve it. If it is just lag, hopefully it’s an easy fix that we just require them to try to get us back to where we were before the patch in the first place.
---
At least not deliberately 😛
---
Hell, I'll trade my unyielding pieces for that one damn bobblehead I'm missing and some Tumbler magazines
---
"We'll be right back" 💀
---
I know we are not supposed to say these things nowadays, but holy crap, she is pretty.  sry  :(
---
Gl farming. With no new rewards the amount of players still donating has been cut significantly.
---
The overall limits on caps, scrip, and gold are fine. The problem is the daily ones like you said. We should be able to go from 0 to 30k caps in a day. That’s either a lot of playtime, or from player vendors, the latter of which is already possible. I don’t see why this would be an issue for them - people would be online playing their game for a longer period of time
---
We'll finds out in time I suppose.  They were all talking about their builds for a few minutes.
---
s c r e a m i n g , ALREADY SEE THE YOUTUBE VIDEOS.
---
Watching? It’s crashed due to lag. Edit: a word.
---
Sweet. Let me know if it works. I’ve got a black book full of builds so if not I may have something that works for you.
---
I list all my plans for 50 caps and they fly off shelves
---
Depends on your build. If you are built to do minimum damage that is what you do. If you are built to solo her then you have options whatever the circumstances are.
---
Add a Wallet too for the cards
---
Nothing. Just doing simple tasks that are part of actually playing.
---
Still works for me most of the time.
---
In the beginning I always wondered why people were complaining because I never seen glitches/bugs.  Now that I passed lvl 100 I’m getting glitches daily now.
---
But if they do that, then the executives who saw Fortnite numbers and strong armed developers to make a Battle Royale type game on an unadvised multiplayer game made from a popular single player game will have to figure out a new way to justify their salary and keep their jobs.  If they force the player base of a single player game into playing a multiplayer version of the game, and then force that same player base into playing a battle royale they can continue to show the shareholders they were right in their decision making.
---
Same on pc
---
Thanks for the feedback, we'll report this to the team.
---
If the daily vendor limit is 500 caps and the weekly is, say, 7000 caps, how do you ever get to 7000 caps in a week if you can't ever get more than 500 caps a day?
---
I have never touched NW... Perhaps make the change for adventure only or something then.
---
WOW, the FO76 Colossal Problem demo stream on Twitch just went down!
---
All the people and devs involved claim to play the game, so we know they're lying...
---
Why it even has the terminal component is beyond me. That’s like having all vendors and scrip machines be terminals as well. It just *doesn’t* work, Todd.
---
And down the stream goes! Ouch!
---
It’s the entire stream, not the game
---
Great to hear you had a warming welcome ! Us veterans get neglected content wise, so helping others is basically all that’s left...
---
i wish gunpowder was junk
---
cause then i could put it in my scrapbox
---
Man what a colossal problem
---
ok ty
---
Cobalt is the hardest to find in my experience.  You won’t find enough to make one flux in the SBQ event though.  Whitesprings is a better nuke spot for that.  
---
But Fusion cores are rewarded through lots of events.  Player vendors often have them.  You can still do heavy without PA, too.   
---
Overall though, points in STR isn’t a bad thing.  You can do hybrid builds and mix it up.  What level are you?
---
Do you have the perk which reduces fusion core usage cost?
---
Ward is a nuisance.  
---
"Hey ward, I'm back. I had to kill some dudes, hope it was worth it.."  
---
"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.....anyway! It turns out when I did inventory I had my fat thumb over the stock. Turns out we have like a dozen spares, but hey thanks for getting it back!"
---
You suck Ward.
---
Wow! So laggy it's crashed the stream! Funniest thing I've seen all day!
---
    Seriously, I do feel bad for them. But maybe now they'll understand how bad it's been for the rest of us, and do something about it.
---
You said adrenal reaction does boost it, so I guess bloody mess should too? and as it's melee maybe strength as well, would be nice if I could confirm it before trying to get one for myself.
---
And as to getting the mod, I can get it from scrapping, right? Or do I need to search for some rare vendor as for some plans?
---
and the Brahmins and the chickens!
---
Also Sunny!
---
LadyDevann pls pay your internet bill
---
Hahahahahahaha!
---
Mines been pretty much the same
---
Don't forget a DOOM shotgun skin for our double-barrelled shotgun
---
Hmm. Can you redeploy your camp from the PIP boy? You have to rebuild the CAMP if you do this.
---
that sounds like a dream, I would literally say good bye to any other weapon, just want to be a maniac.
---
I laughed when I saw their health bars, and then they each mention in some way how awesome Bloodied is. I guess that answers that long standing question as to why it was never really nerfed.
---
There is a perk which makes them last longer, also there are many static spawns which refresh after 24 hours. One a day used, one a day found should suffice and having too many in your inventory eats space. Camp within walking distance of a spawn and you should be all good dude.
---
Crazy deluded people. Stay safe dude. I hope you do venture back into the game sometime.
---
Just scrap golf balls from whitesprings thousands of times over
---
&gt; I’ve seen quite a few comments about this issue and I think the only reason I can’t find a post about this specific bug is because people are afraid of being downvoted.
---
new here?
---
anti armor fire rate reload... maybe I’ll think about it
---
I help newbies because I was hassled by high level players when I first started, back when the game was first released. They stole from me, killed me, and destroyed my house unprovoked just because they could. So, now I lend a hand to any player under level 100, and I give stuff to players under level 50. 
---
But if you are within 50 levels (+ or -) of my current high level, I expect you to be able to defend yourself and if you piss me off or provoke me, you’re fair game.
---
Nah, see it actually is a pretty decent system. Not every mod is for every situation, and with legendary effects you can tailor every bow to its intended use. For example, my flaming bow is a great aoe weapon for tagging and hitting whole groups at once, but the aoe damage sucks. It does have a suppressor prefix though, so in horde situations I can suppress half an army. Suppressor’s is a terrible effect on single encounters though, so my plasma bow is an Executioner’s instead while my explosive one is Vampire’s. All being fed with universal ammo and only weighing like 3 pounds each. That’s still lighter than a fully modded rifle.
---
I get the immersion aspect, but from a gameplay perspective the current setup is REALLY good.
---
If you have anythIng built it will be stored completely.
---
ha! have another drink Ward..
---
People don't craft cores, they farm them, Line in the sand and power plants are good choices
---
But is 200,000,000 enough cork to plug the holes in Bethesda's code?  IS that why we are really gathering it?
---
Yes. Can easily sink a few hundred hours into it without trying. My advice: stay off Reddit ad just experience the game for yourself. People here like to complain.
---
Game definitely had a rough launch. It plays pretty well right now for a Bethesda game.
---
new game mechanic in the event: Fear
---
Can this be fixed by changing the skin back?
---
Yeah, they are not even challenges...
---
I dont keep count. I'll shoot as many as I need to in order to take her down.
---
With 30k ultracite 308, and 20k ultracite 50 cal, 5k ultracite plasma cells, a dozen ultracite fusion cores, 20 ultracite plasma cores and 10k ultracite 2mm.... ammo isn't an issue.
---
working fine for me
---
There was a way around it. Use the wooden wall and then add the wallpaper. When you done that you then replace the wall with the wooden wall with the shutters, oh... actually know they patched that exploit. I guess no wallpaper for that wall with the shutter lol.
---
😎👍
---
Maybe I'm just a sucker for the Settlers but I actually kind of like Ward.
---
Sorry man I'm pretty new here, what is GI an acronym for?
---
Yea it’s pretty annoying tbh. I don’t understand what people want added to this game
---
I’m still wondering what happened to my ID card to get into the robco office. Can’t get the mr gutsy model anywhere else i don’t think
---
I’m sure they read every word
---
OH SHOOT, I left a bunch of them in a bag at the train station lol. OOoops , sorry whoever took them
---
the gatling gun skin is literally the only one i am doing the run for
---
and they had to restart the stream as the game lagged too hard lol xD
---
The community is very nice
---
Good luck = Gl
---
They don’t make much effort with the game anyway don’t see why that should change when it comes to playing it :)
---
Power armour mods (not plans), nuke keys, bobbleheads/magazines. Those are my best sellers Id say.
---
Yeah, looks like they fixed the stream or the game. Audio is super low on my end for some reason still.
---
To the sub Reddit? Not at all. I’ve been using it since it first hit the scene but I had to deactivate my old account due to having acquired a stalker. That’s my own fault for being too trusting. I was just acknowledging that a lot of times people will avoid unpopular opinions depending on the magnitude if it gets them down voted. However, no, I know this forum is full of both bashers and lovers of the game and the company that made it.
---
None. I use a quad cryo to freeze her, switch to my mole miner gauntlet.
---
I snagged a quad ffr (I forget the third star) gamma gun for 150caps from someone’s camp. I couldn’t believe it, I know that the fed76 price guide is super over priced but they say that it can sell for 25-42 thousand caps, so realistically I can probably get 8-12 thousand for it. But that’s going into my trade pile so I can hopefully find a quality fixer or two
---
They should have played this event with full health builds. Everyone who's been on the PTS knows that you're screwed without a bloodied or magic weapon player.
---
I have to agree, I have been gifted or helped numerous times. I play on Xbox which seems to have less players but still overall it’s been great
---
What level are you? PA becomes a lot more feasible when you have maxed out Power User and keep getting fusion cores as event rewards. You should also claim a power plant workshop and just let it produce you a big stockpile of cores passively. What do you need the flux for? If you're using them to craft cores don't bother, it's a waste of a rare resource.
---
1* level 1 is meta
---
This game just isn’t as fun when you’re a tank
---
Ah I see, thanks - we're all gonna need it
---
Same controller issue here. Sometimes A button does 2 inputs.
---
If you can get it cheap, it's a great snag for a casual Fallout fan. 
---
There are some differences in how you enjoy the core experience in 76 compared to previous Fallout games. 
---
* If you're a start to finish main quest type of person, the main quest lines are huge. They'll eat up a good chunk of your time, sure, but still not huge. 
---
* The game is largely experienced outdoors. This doesn't get mentioned often, but in previous Fallouts there's alot more indoors exploration. 76 is a great place to explore, it's just different. It's big and expansive and even the unmarked locations you stumble across have a small, interesting story to tell.... Leading to my next point.
---
* The story telling in 76 is largely environmental. Wastelanders brought along NPC's, they are part of some quests and stories, but much of it is still told by notes, journals, terminal entries, holotape recordings (Rather well done imo), and stories told through the environment (You'll find little scenes, last moments of people, places abandoned, attacked or whatever, where the story of what happened there is simply told by observing the location. I spent much of my early hours exploring these. 
---
* There are clear character build meta. This is something I'd like to see fixed. One of the things I miss about previous Fallout games is the ability to try and experiment with a wide variety of effective builds. As of right now, a few legendary effects are the most effective, and nearly exclusively used by the late and end game player base. 
---
There's more, but I'm trying to keep this post reasonable. 
---
Depending on what platform you're on, you will have varying degrees of bug and lag issues it seems. I'm on PS4 and rarely have problems. I might just be lucky, I don't know. 
---
Also. If you like to roleplay at all, 76 is a great place to do so. I'm a casual RPer and roleplaying your own character motivations and quirks can really add the experience. 
---
If you're looking for a new Fallout setting to explore and take in, to enjoy the stories, and setting. It's great. It's arguably one of my favourite settings in Fallout. 
---
If you want an MMO alternative, you'll likely grow tired of it quickly. 
---
Oh and camps! Camp building can be frustrating at times, but can also be super fun. I'm a pretty avid camp builder, it's one of my favourite aspects.
---
Some folks go by the fed76 pricing guide which is super over priced in my opinion. According to the guide I’ve got a few weapons that are worth 30-50 thousand caps.
---
Is the colossus stronger in the event than the random nuke ecnounter that we've had?
---
Ah, toot. I meant vault 79.
---
For me it's only camp building being a little funky and the score board. Other than that I've actually had some notably smoother combat encounters. This is on the PS4 anyways so it may be different.
---
One can only dream.
---
Only happens me with black eye, although it happens every time with her.
---
I was super confused I just logged in thinking I missed an update lol
---
Is it compounding the XP repeatable?
---
The whole update has broken the game when it comes to stability. Server lag is insane. Hit an enemy and no damage is dealt. Can’t place things in camps due to the server lagging so much. Frame drops are worse than ever. Constant frame drops wherever you are on the map. Just generally a broken update. Bethesda needs to sort this ASAP.
---
Edit: radiation rumble should just be avoided. The meat piles, ash piles, all the unclaimed loot is causing major frame drops and very harsh stutter.
---
same way it was done back in 2008 with fallout 3, 12 years ago
---
Finally someone says it, thank you have my upvote
---
I think Morgantown is the best spot to nuke if you need to farm cobalt flux.  Also, I believe crafting gatling lasers will give you one fusion core as well...which is a lot cheaper junk wise.
---
Anti armor, faster fire rate and faster reload. 👍
---
This same thing is happening with Spruce Knob Lake Rental or whatever it's called.
---
Can't enter to reach Rocco.
---
Yep. At least it felt like that last time I played on the PTS.
---
Found a Bloodied switch blade yesterday if you're on xbox.
---
never craft cores they're a massive waste of flux, just power up 2 or 3 power plants whilst holding their relevant workshops with fusion core processors for a few hours to get a starting surplus of like 30-50 cores, memorise fusion generator locations in the world &amp; you should end up constantly getting more cores than you use (unless you use a Gatling laser religiously, then you'll more likely break even, but shouldn't run out of cores)
---
No, most servers are full on PC. I am only alone on my private server.
---
My game crashes every time i use Sunny
---
I completed order of the tadpole yesterday, today after 4 hours of playing, I got the notification (and a 1* axe). Nothing really changed other than normal play. Dailies quests and challenges showing up normal, that one just took forever. Was even in my PA when it appeared.
---
Lies. Everyone knows that New Vegas is the best game. 
---
Not only was the story complex, the gameplay completely changed but within the scope of the game engine, but all of the DLC was fantastic as well to varying levels.
---
Everything that was placed in my vending machines is GONE.
---
Wouldn’t happen to have the link to that YouTube video would you? Someone else asked me for a link showing proof that tents don’t effect the Queen.
---
(I stand on tents all the time in Queen fights and she always lands for me so I’ve had no issues with survival tents at Queen fights like everyone else.)
---
I hope so, I love this game a lot, and I want to enjoy it, the only thing I miss while not playing today is the vault 76 dwellers, the kind strangers
---
Or they don’t know how to use radaway because obviously they don’t play their game
---
100% agree I think its the meat piles. I did Rad Rumble with one other person and we were both rubber banding all over the place. It was borderline unplayable. Took over 15 minutes to loot the piles.
---
No man's sky. It's long game though
---
People usually sell flux for 100-150 caps per in you're in a pinch
---
Nope, fun wife time. Enjoy!
---
Pretty full on Xbox. Probably has to do with it being in gamepass. I'm pretty sure that goes for PC too.
---
Thanks for that mate. Always wanted to be able to see the NW challenge before getting on.
---
I think we'll get it Tuesday or when the alpha stage is done
---
Not true. I really wish people would stop making fake posts like this. Seriously it’s so old. These attempts to cause drama.
---
It's useful if you want a free camp move
---
looks like most (all?) of the Beth team is Bloodied
---
There are plenty of pumpkins growing behind Pumpkin House, you dont have to fight a Scorchbeast everytime you do this quest.
---
Probably gonna get the items in the next update/maintenance, like how they gave the items out for "cleaning up Appalachia"
---
Earle spawns A TON of Wendigos, you'll not be in stealth for long.
---
Not saying it's impossible, it's just an incredible ammo dump.
---
I’ve found that fed76 is over priced, I wouldn’t be willing to pay what they suggest. But I’ll usually price them at 60% of the higher suggested price and even then it sometimes seems way to high. I have one gamma gun that they suggest a price of 25-42 thousand caps.
---
this should be a good screw farming event
---
Ah I’ve heard of this bug, apparently if you set your camp device on a destructible object and it gets destroyed, your camp device will sink into the ground or something. I think the only way to fix it is to move camps.
---
What the fuck does that even mean?
---
regen health by 20 minute mark. otherwise may not be worth it.

Sept 10-14

---
I would like a “look I’ve dropped some things for you” emoji.  I drop items for new players all the time and a lot of times they seem to ignore them, probably think they are mines.  Ok you can all tell me there is such an emoji and I’ve not found it.
---
Have you tried the event with a stealth suit by chance?
---
We are a go and Moist.
---
This guy 😂
---
I mean some of us just like to do nice things and new players seem to be genuinely happy when you throw 30 stimpaks and 5000 .38 rounds at their feet.
---
If that makes someone's day then I don't really see what the problem is. Sucks that you've had such negative experiences on your end.
---
I get that some people dont want anything to do with NW, the play mode only recently grew on me. But honestly, two things:
---
1. You dont have to play that mode to complete the seasons.
---
2. Some of the challenges in NW are the easiest challenges on the game. Deploy your camp 3 times might the single easiest challenge in the game.
---
400 levels in 400 hours?
---
lol could be
---
Looks like Sept 10.

Not, sadly Bashin, Power Attack, and throwing a grenade is always the same button.
---
The brotherhood haven't arrived yet
---
Actually, Cobalt Flux is best found when you nuke Mama Dolces.
---
I gotta say the theme of the game of rebuilding Appalachia together stays true in how most players act. We are in this together and my own personal saying goes: A watered flower grows, even if you never see that same flower ever again.
---
Acts of kindness doesnt need to yield results to have a positive inpact and since I was playing since day one beta I honestly feel like it's my responsibility sometimes to help people out. Something I've been doing is inviting low levels to teams or accepting their team invites. And more casually I sell rare plans at a huge discount. (Sure it's to encourage people to buy in bulk but whatever.)
---
Regardless I'm thrilled your first experiences in this great, wild, sumtimes buggy, and weird frontier were a good one.
---
Unequip the skin and replace the camp device.
---
This my friend, is very complainy. Just.. don't do the challenge. I do fine without it, level 70 on the pass and I only do the place camp challenges, sometimes. I think I've done it like 3 times and that's it. Really not that hard
---
I started playing about 4 weeks after launch, and even at that early mark I had high level players helping me out. Small goodie bags, and helping with events. Those early levels would have been unbearable without the continued kindness afforded by this community. So, now being a high level player myself, I routinely drop off handfuls of stimpaks, aid items, and melee weapons for any low level player I happen across in the wasteland. 
---
Just paying it forward.
---
I coppied another guy I saw. You can make a blueprinted sign that says"Enjoy! I only claimed it for the daily" Better use of 70 steel then giving it to those BOS weirdos.
---
Some of us don’t care about the loot, just the XP

Except, I wasn't doing that. It's a legitimate question. Sorry, if you see them all the time. But it wasn't my intention. Because like I said I've experienced a slow down on ps4 that's all. Nothing more to it. Don't read anything else into it.

IF YOU or ANY noob players need anything in the way of mats or chems or whatever hit me up! ZeddtheRED on PC! I'm always giving stuff away. I can make ammo for you or whatever you need that I can do, I'll do! Play on!
---
Idk when you played but I started in March and 99% of the players I encounter are amazing and/or just doing their own thing. On PC if that matters.. maybe consoles have more bored/angsty teens, not sure.

-  FO76 player base:  Gold

Or go to Nukacrypt moron.

so the Fear mechanic makes you all stop shooting and run away
---
I think when you're defending the people who enjoy playing NW you kinda get stuck in a corner cause honestly they're the ones getting the least amount of progress on the board/per time. 
---
Why not make the challenges "Do x for Adventure mode or do Y for NW)
---
Why not make NW exp count towards the 10k repeatable daily.
---
Good info, thanks
---
413 hours on record. Lvl 491, dunno what to tell you. I never used xp exploits. I would get around 20+ levels a day on double xp weekends though.
---
U got ff14 and u think fallout 76 is a grind?
---
I want to be able to display my PA in the PA stations.
---
The only thing I'm tryna boycott is these dramatic ass posts
---
Oh well, it's out of stocks, closed now.
---
This is true. It's fucking gross, but true.
---
Same, turned to buying ammo to get rid of caps and now I have 10s of thousands of rounds and out of carry weight again.
---
Even the Bethesda live stream had bugs, that's halirious lol
---
Look at this vulture lol. I might come back one day. Leave my B 40 1ST bear arm alone.
---
Hard to gauge for an "all purpose" answer, she needs to hit hp regen (or at least be close) by 20 minutes remaining,  but that time ultimately varies by the players there.  if there are real heavy hitters and she didn't land much prior to 20, il bump the timer over to 15 minutes left.
---
I frankly don't know if the patch had anything to do with it, but I do know it's something that waxes and wanes regularly. I have an embarrassing amount of hours in this game, and yes you will go on quite the streak where everything works... And than all of sudden you will experience things like the rubber banding, or inexplicable damage drops or you'll of a sudden seem more squishy then the day before. Then all of sudden  everything will start working like normal again. All of this happens even when no patch has implemented and no hotfixes have been done. That long draught of any patch before WL for example. The only explanation is latency, the server just isn't pinging the things it should be. It's probably a combination of plenty of things,  Bethesda's code, strain on the company that rents Bethesda their server space, latency from your own ISP (and yes, even if you pay for super duper extra double internet speed it will still experience network lag from time to time) all the way to just general internet lag. All of this effects how the game client is going to interpret what's happening.
---
It's gorgeous, and one of my mains is a trusty dusty gatling, so I wanna make it as gorgeous as possible. This is my motivation.
---
They have actually been fixing a fair bit with the patches.
---
The problem is they are literally breaking or making buggy things as much or more than they fix.
---
Im level 107 and I've maxed out Power User, so I've got double duration for cores.
---
Yeah I was considering using flux to make cores.
---
I'm in xbox and I played from beta till a few months back when people got bored and toxic, then wastelanders came out and I played three days just fine then it was back to normal.
---
Nope. Full health PA heavy.
---
I saw a video about it yesterday aparently it's caused by the dead bodies in the ground.
---
It just comes naturally when the legend grind gets fast. Sometimes I just say screw it and drop legends in the rusty pick cause my stash can't take it. Though it's only the more... funky 3 stars I sell for dirt cheap. Things like the 4 different junkies/swing speed melees require me to squeeze a bit more caps outta folk. But if the guy you're talking about is giving out god rolls like he's santa claus then bless him.
---
I did play it I played all the way up till the vault raid when I died in it near the end and was reset to the beginning I was frustrated and just didn’t care enough to restart the whole quest finally went back last month to do so......and yeah the only reward was the bullion grind.
---
Well how is anyone supposed to know your intentions when there’s so many posts like this? More so when these posts always shod up after a patch that has issues. 
---
It’s the same pattern. Rage, drama and then doooOOoooom.
---
Just did another, no problems.  People saying it's ash piles could be on to something.
---
That happened with my camp but just the very top is slightly showing through the floor which is kinda neat hidden away
---
Ive searched multiple, probably 30 or so, player vendors and haven't found any Flux or cores.
---
I'm level 107 with max STR.
---
It would be better if it was just like a vendor interaction. Choose how much you want to sell and choose how much you want to buy. 
---
Way easier.
---
I never said f76 was a grind, im just tired of being dissapointed with the world, between bugs, and amount of restrictions, if i want fallout ill go back to fo4, i dont mind grinding if its fulfilling.
---
Power User? Yeah. I've got double the duration from cores.
---
Glad you had a good experience. Sometimes it feels like it’s just negativity so it’s always good to see stuff like this. I love helping new players out, even those who probably are just starting an alt. Just don’t ask to trade and request all the good weapons I actually have lol.
---
Based on how well steel went, concrete is likely not to happen and cork definitely won't.
---
I should have specified in public matches - it’s typically the SBQ.  Occasionally Whitesprings.  Rarely in Morgantown.  
---
So if you’re like me, and playing primarily in public games and not launching my own nukes - cobalt is the hardest to come by plus since jet packs mods I think are tied to it and some others that use a lot
---

---
You're a hero!
---
Would be great if one of them died at the end and had the respawn glitch.
---
Or tried to leave so another nuke could drop and had fast travel bug.
---
Perhaps even tried to vats things and constantly miss.
---
Used a shotgun and had the enemies health rubber band
---
You know, had to experience they bugs that we feel all the time that they haven’t addressed.
---
Just look at how the made it with gold bullion. You know how it is implemented? Why shouldn't be something similar be possible with caps?
---
yeah I should just drop the price
---
I feel attacked
---
so you bought them all out to line your pockets? Maybe he makes them super cheap to help out people who can't buy the weapons yet. That's like taking all of the halloween candy in the bowl on halloween.
---
It's cork now?  I would be curious to see what would happen if the entire player base was like, "Naw, we aren't doing this."  It would never happen and if it did, it would probably seal the death knell for this game so I'm happy it won't.  But....
---
Cork? Seriously?
---
Its fun, especially as a new player but buggy. Very buggy. Be prepared to deal with crashes, ini file edits and such.
---
ngl they are kinda cute with there struggles but yea we need that big balance patch soon.
---
Because some of us aren’t lemmings and do our own thing.
---
After my 8 hour shift at work is dedicated to doing the dailies I just want the gat gun skin
---
I wouldn’t care if the exchange rate was half what it is now if we could just use the vendor interface instead.
---
Same experience here! I have been hassled, robbed and killed by higher level players. Even still do. So I try to take care of anyone under 50 if I can find them. But I worry about scaring them because I'm chasing them around trying to emote "come here" and "gift"
---
Ahh 2017 Prey is so class! A wall decoration that is a 'not a mimic' post-it note would be worth a laugh. 
---
Looking forwards to the upcoming Nightdive System Shock remake!
---
I've gotten several SCORE ranks just from lunch box XP.
---
Ofc it did. This game is just BGS side hussle with the fo1st subscription service now, nothing more.
---
To be honest, the issue with daily caps isn’t that they’re a thing... it’s that they’re so fucking low. Of course vendors don’t have infinite caps, of course there isn’t infinite gold/bullion... but there should be a hell of a lot more than there is daily
---
Thanks! Still might be quicker to quit and log back in :D
---
While we're at it, let's add a binder for all the documents/notes you want to save
---
I have got a gatling laser but keep it for SBQ usually.
---
I mean, it's basically the ONLY build, so it's no surprise.
---
event reminds me a lot of Encryptid.   without the pylons.
---
Not available yet
---
Ight so how much they pay these bots to spam #windigo cause my vote is #doublesidedwalls
---
Its also hilarious to watch em get stomped. I hope this presents half a challenge.
---
It still has 1 day to go.
---
yeah it really emphasizes how good the build variety is...
---
I also noticed everyone in the stream was less than lvl 200, goes to show not even the  bethesda team plays this game
---
I got a present emote, probably back around Christmas time. Really useful for things like this. But I think you'll have to wait for next Christmas to get it.
---
Well, the crazy guy making us do this quest isn't actually BOS...
---
I work in the "entertainment business" and all you have to do is read the words between my "" for all of your answers. It's a business.
---
There is a delicate balance between entertaining and money. Artist of all walks of life deal with the challenge of having to buy groceries and create what they want. The industry right now is this type of gaming. Epic games for example made 400m dollars... In April alone. 400m... Can you blame bethesda for wanting to keep you away from other games and in their ecosystem to spend money on atoms and SCORE boost? That money enables them to make more content.
---
And of course one can say "if they give the consumers what they want they'd make more money". To that I say I can't give you 30 min or less pizza on a scooter in a rural town. Creation Engine is aweful. It's old and clunky. But it's what they have and it's what works for this type of game. Anyone who's stepped foot in modding older fallout games will agree it's not a fun experience.
---
So the answer is truly simple. If one doesn't like what they are playing play something else. We are in a golden age of gaming. Sooo many games across multiple platforms and some cross platform. Ive been playing games for 30 years (since I was 5) and have seen the changes year to year. It's a great time to be entertained.
---
My response is now officially as long as your post. I can go now
---
I actually have a “budget”: 200 rounds of 2mm from my primed B Gauss mini, to fulfill the damage criteria to get rewards. Then I switch to a non-prime AA Gauss mini to have fun taking out the mob spawns.
---
Quick edit: with so many “magic” weapons around, I haven’t seen the SBQ event fail in the last 100+ I’ve done.  So it’s more about having fun now than having to beat the clock.
---
Just an area where things don't get one shotted. A place to explore and have to team up.
---
Yep agree. Always trying out different builds and have stayed away from bloodied
---
Plus there's a good chunk of players that have dumped more than 12k just to see what they'll get.
---
I use the emote that looks like a present. I found it when I expand the "trade" emote options
---
I'm always very happy to help out the newbies, I remember starting the game and feeling very out of my depth so there's always a free fully modded weapon or some armour available to the new players. This community really is full of very kind players for the most part
---
1: You're openly giving up 250,000 points overall when you don't do it (not counting if it's a weekly, then you're really fucked) and I don't care that there's that 100 point catch-up repeatable, that is the lamest fucking excuse anybody has come up with in here. Nobody should be robbed because they have to change fucking game modes to get points for things that only apply in the core mode. Seems like a rip-off on both ends.
---
2: Yeah it is, and I really only feel truly compelled to do NW if it's that one, but otherwise I'd rather jump off my roof. Less painful.
---
Nahh you have no say so on what anyone does...... Maybe you should get a life if the only happiness you can get is from online bullying in a video game....... Shame on you.......Also hope you don't have kids or younger siblings so that if they play games or just try to enjoy themselves in general they don't meet some lil dick energy Bullies like you
---
I don't use any kind of "Low health" bonus (besides adrenal reaction, since I'm a Mutie), purely out of spite. It's comical how little effort they've put into making everything try to be on equal footing.
---
I greatly appreciate this comment. I know for a fact you are absolutely correct that things wax and wane in this game very randomly and even without patches. It’s almost funny because a lot of people simply assume that Bethesda is constantly stealth patching the game, and though it is at times, they usually use that as the reason for random changes. 
---
I hope you are 100% right on this one because that would be nothing but awesome if you were. Maybe it’s just been a bad couple of days you know? I always find it interesting that a game engine as complicated and fickle as the one used to make Skyrim and Fallout 3+ was used to make an online multiplayer environment. 
---
Do you remember the teaser website for a Fallout MMO years ago before the original creator of Fallout had that court battle with Bethesda and lost the rights to it? I never imagined in 1 million years that whatever Fallout MMO we got would be using the same lovable but extremely buggy engine we’ve all enjoyed from Fallout 3 onwards. Sometimes I don’t think ever-changing, living worlds and Fallout 3+ mix together all that well, sometimes maybe oil and water. Here’s to hoping it all reaches normalcy, or at least what I wish was normalcy, again here soon :-)
---
where was the camp? next to whitespring, but on a cliff? :3
---
Yeah, not to mention ridiculous player vendor prices. We have plenty of capsinks for those of us that don't make 60k every day.
---
Not yet, it's concrete atm but cork is the upcoming one. You are right though, cork is a very odd material to request - I think Aluminium would have been a better choice, harder to get than steel but not quite as hard as cork lol
---
Tbh I'm getting the impression that it's just easier to find/farm them rather than craft them
---
Funny thing is that I've actually not seen a post about this yet and that was another reason for the question. If you didn't know my intentions maybe you shouldn't have replied the way you did. You could've just asked. But no I get the triggered reply. I don't spend a lot of time on here so maybe that's why I haven't seen one. All good 👍
---
..annnnnd team wipe lol. Expect a last minute difficulty reduction.
---
“Play for x minutes” (as long as it’s not an absurd amount) could be a very suitable replacement. NW already has a similar kind of challenge in the form of surviving for 10 minutes, so it should definitely be possible to do something similar with Adventure mode.
---
Just pulled 3k from Line in the Sand and crazy dude flacking for BOS is all full.  Oh well.  4000 more 2mm for me.
---
no, you won't LOSE out on anything.

Why do you keep going on about fortnite?? How did fortnite hurt you?
---
"It's not that hard" is such a tired line in this conversation istg. It's so dismissive. But whatever.
---
Aluminum, Lead, even Copper would fit better in the idea of BoS needs.
---
Flux is definitely something I don’t see a lot of in vendors.  I always have cores for sale under the face value 🤷‍♂️.  But I don’t play a PA build. I’m specced for rifle/shotgun but use perk load out for events and have heavy weapons perks maxed for that.  If you’re relying on a Gat Laser, then perhaps focus on using a .50 cal or Mini instead
---
Yeah, if they're under 35 I leave their stuff. 
---
After that its free game.
---
I’d guess you can get loot crates until the 8th. No way there’s a kill switch.
---
Lol I noticed the hour/level ratio too
---
Um... it was the entire stream lagging. Not the game
---
-looks at Fortnite-
---
-looks at NW-
---
same fucking battle royale luck based trash, really.
---
lotro loot system would solve all the games problem.
---
what does one have to do with the other?
---
I have enough junk. I usually don’t bother with pvp in 76. I always appreciated my own bounty being cleared if I got one by mistake, but that hasn’t happened in the last 200 levels.
---
Noooo! Come back, Bethesda need youuuuu!
---
I hold down the trigger til she's dead 😤😤😤 I want that 1* nocturnal meat hook and by god I will get it
---
This sub is so cursi
---
You're right, but I think everyone agrees that if all you care about is NW, you weren't' going to care about the game board anyway because the only thing on it useful to you is atoms.
---
It seems to be generally accepted that NW is a nice break from Adventure for people who like it/want more PvP, but if all you want is that game mode, other games do it better.
---
The market is hell I'll agree but I don't live in the context of what other people do. I have not once used a glitch or anything illicit. Ever. I don't like it. But I'm 2 outfits away from having every rare outfit. 11 plans from having all of the plans. I have legacies pouring out of my ears. Amazing unicorn legendaries.
---
My method has always been to play the long game. Duping seems revolve around a small few items. But there are many items and most people don't have time or take the risk duping every single rare items. I played the Halloween event a lot and had a ton of Jack suits from it. I've been using them today to trade for rare outfits and plans. 
---
I think there was a person who traded a paper clip for a house. It took a lot of in-between but let's all be that person. It's possible! Just read the market and play it.
---
“Listen here, you little shit” 🤣
---
people commenting here that they‘re selling their plans for 20 caps. everyone knows what plans you’re selling. wow, big kudos for selling your mounted plans and freaking christmas lights for 20 caps. 
---
come back here when you people sell RARE plans like mutation recipes, t60 plans etc for 20 caps.
---
Shocking how many people aren't aware that this game has a website.
---
Yeah uhhhh my issue with a lot of the legendaries is that I literally can’t tag them without killing them
---
Yeah it puts you back to the beginning but the actual quest doesn’t reset. All you needed to do was run back where you died...
---
Also, sounds like a better build might have made your time less tedious.
---
You don't need the plant powered up to produce cores, that just reduces the power required. A fusion generator will power up the core producer if the plant isn't powered up.
---
Fireworks (from legendary run)
---
Equip and then check your reload time
---
There should be a "delete this and everything it supports" option, which includes an "are you sure" prompt. Problem solved. Deletes problem piece for you, and whatever items they think are illegal for them. Worst case scenario it deletes too much and you rebuild.
---
I always have too many Stim packs, rad aways and one * weapons/gear i love giving to new people. I was given gear and meds as a newbie and it helped me immensely. I wasn't afraid to take chances and really get into the game knowing there are helpful people about.
---
That happened to me the first time. Server hop and start the mission from the top.
---
I always bring my lvl5 10mm (named “-Tag!”  of course) and just pop it once then start doing “Follow Me” emotes. This means when OnePumpChump comes around and pops it, everyone can see that I was trying to get their attention, and it was not me.
---
This does make some people think I’m purposefully trolling with the emote, but I mean what can you do?
---
Yup.  I know certain instanced areas have them lying around too.  Have to YouTube that.   I think Fort Defiance 
---
Certain events always reward them (line in the sand?)
---
Or just focus on nuking Morgantown yourself
---
Plus, it's a lot harder to get a bounty by mistake since Bethesda patched that. I juat go after wanted players whenever I see them for the challenge.
---
I just focus on getting a couple hits in with my deathclaw gauntlet and then focus more on the mobs so other people can fovus the queen.
---
Did I spot a Furious Rolling Pin as reward?
---
Fucking lol
---
maybe i should start checking for high level CAMPs to possibly get cheap legendaries
---
need to get myself an explosive shotgun
---
I've played since the beta, but in a very casual way. I also took a year-long break for school. I pick up #allthejunk and craft a lot. So, I'm only a level seventy-something. But, I have loads of junk and usually only claim the workshops for SCORE. I also leave everything unlocked so that anyone can use them.
---
I have been griefed more times than I can count while at a workshop, so I'm always leery when somebody comes around. I have waved at people, they have waved at me. Then, I would turn around to walk away or gather some of my resources, and they would shoot me in the back. That just felt so wrong. So, for a long time, I didn't bother with workshops at all. I recently claimed one before SCORE started, and the same type of thing happened. I never lose much, because I drop everything into my Scrapbox as often as possible, but it's the principle of the thing. If they want to claim the workshop, I'm fine with that, but they don't have to kill me to do so. 
---
I went to Charleston afterwards, and some nice, higher-level guys in PA dropped some stuff for me, which I thought was really sweet. They didn't know, but they kind of restored my faith in humanity at that moment. 
---
A week later, I saw that I had an Xbox Live message. It turns out, the guy who had murdered me for the workshop apologized after I had logged off. I sent a reply telling him that it had upset me but kind strangers had unknowingly made me feel better, and maybe not to murder people in the future, lol. We ended up having a whole conversation, and adding each other as friends on the Xbox. So, people aren't always terrible, thankfully. :)
---
8 T notes for event and a possibility of a new thing: cursed weapon.  powerful but with a downside
---
I've done that but it still happens
---
Moron? Read whole rules, You idiot. You can't cuss at people or whatever are you calling them. How pathetic are you don't read whole rules of reddit's.
---
I was absolutely a full health vanguard's build since launch. I hated the idea of running with 10% health. Was constantly picking my buddies up after being sneezed on by most anything. They always boated their carry weights, charisma bonus without equipping hard bargain, saving on ammo, better sneak etc. I was always too stubborn to try. 
---
But about 6 months ago I started getting some really nice unyielding pieces dropping from legendaries, so I started building a makeshift set to test, just stashing the pieces. About a month ago I completed it with pieces I was comfortable with using. 
---
Yep. Holy shit. What a difference! 2 shots of bloodied 5.56 to kill a super mutant, rather than 10-15? One swipe of a bloody mole miner gauntlet? I'd seen the videos of slashing the queen for 30k+ damage, always thought all the buffing and prep was dumb, I still do, kind of. I just run unyielding, serendipity and radicool and the game becomes ultra easy mode. 
---
I still enjoy working for kills, I do fine on a full health Vanguard build. But unyielding/bloodied is crazy.
---
I think they never realized how people would wind up using it is the thing.  They probably expected people to start with full health and fight mobs like usual then just gain some bonus attack as their health depleted.  I don’t think they expected people to run around full of rads and barely alive.  That’s of course just a theory and I could be completely wrong.
---
Personally i’d like too see some sort of penalty for death other than losing a bunch of junk items, then lets see how many bloodied builds there are.
---
I don,t even tag them. I just try to move away.
---
You're now switching from honorable to honored.  Not at all the same thing.  There are tons of people who are honored that are not honorable.  Cheating is not honorable.  if you are honored for something you cheated to accomplish, that does not make you honorable.  I have no opinion on Belichick, really.  I don't even watch the NFL anymore because the stances they have taken are not honorable.  If he cheated, which it does appear that the team did with the films and such, then he has no honor, and he is a hollow fraud.  Nobody knows it but him.  He knows, inside, what happened, and that's all that matters.  That's his honor.
---
Thanks for the reply. The .ini files weren't set to read only but the long string of char / numbers folder wont come off read only for some reason. I guess I'll have research that.
---
I’ve Soloed the Queen before with a B3325 handmade rifle, so I never stop shooting at her because I know I’m one of the main damage dealers there so I gotta do my part. 
---
(Plus I’ve had those odd moments when I think we’re gonna lose with a minute left and she’s at half health, then she lands in front of my and I do so much damage to her that last half of her heath bar melts so quickly, I love unexplained bursts of damage.)
---
Then how do you get your legendary?
---
While the low frame rate was the clear winner, can we give the Fast Travel bug at the end an honourable mention?
---
When I see a low level player out in a high level area or zone. I fast travel and become a guardian for them, send them a message “take pot shots and I’ll take care of the rest” and bam. Good play session and helping them level up without dying or wasting bullets. Take care of your fellow fault dwellers my friends.
---
It’s funny because she was oblivious to it like it’s a feature or some sh*t lmao
---
I wounder if cork dupers go commando
---
As a few have said, it's a game and playing it is a choice. The only person "holding you hostage" is you.
---
You state you don't want to make any negative impact on the community, and it's not written with bad intentions, yet you then spend the whole post complaining about multiple facets of the game. Nothing constructive, just complaining. This is the equivalent of saying "*I mean no offence but...*" rather than just refraining from saying something offensive in the first place.
---
Bethesda are under no obligation to make the game entertaining for you. They make the game they wish to and they believe will be entertaining to the majority of players, you make the decision if that game is worth your time &amp; money.
---
Personally, being able to jump on for an hour or two every day, doing a few challenges, events and the like is great and fits in with my available time for gaming, which is very limited. I enjoy the world, the ongoing storyline &amp; the flexibility to enjoy it at my pace. During the current season, I've missed several days, because I chose not to play or because I had other, more important things to do. This is because my time is my own and I don't "need" to play and no-one is forcing me to do so.
---
Movies, Books, Music &amp; Games are all made by people who have a vision of what they want to create. Your perception that your opinions of a medium are shared by everyone is self-centered and egotistical.
---
The reddit community of FO76 players is a minority of the games players, not the majority (at the end of 2018, an estimated 1.4 Million digital copies of the game had been sold...there's fewer than 300,000 people subscribed to this subreddit). In addition to that, the most vocal complainants, rarely speak for the masses, which is why it's referred to as a vocal minority.
---
As an example of the vocal minorty, take the supposed furore about the Spider-Man exclusivity in Marvel's Avengers. "Everyone" was complaining about it, except that's not the case, pre-orders for the PS4 standard edition jumped 188% and 124% for the deluxe edition. There was no correlating spike in pre-orders for other platforms. Just because you can shout the loudest, doesn't make you right, it just makes you heard.
---
I guess, the end of *my* rant, is that you're free to complain and whine about the game not being what you want to...but don't ever assume you're in the majority or that you're speaking for anyone other than yourself.
---
Finally, the game isn't an airport, you don't need to announce your departure.
---
so you were nowhere near the Legendary, but you saw another player kill it. But no one else saw this, they just assumed you killed it, even though you weren't anywhere near it, and then they all started attacking you?
---
I use both. I tend to use my handmade more because it has better legendary effects. With equal rolls, the Fixer will have slightly higher damage output. I do agree that the recoil on the handmade is slightly better, but I use VATS almost exclusively and I think that you can set the Fixer up to use slightly less AP. It used to be that you could set it up to be basically zero AP cost, but they patched that.
---
Other than that, I think 5.56 is easier to come by. I don't use primed receivers, but crafting 5.56 produces more than crafting .45 ammo.
---
Never thought about going to the vault to greet new players with items, guees im going to start doing that now
---
😂😂😂 you enjoy your 4x4 wood box, don't let them bully you
---
I have 900 hours in the game. None of my 5 characters are over 200 (some are close)
---
Part of my dailies is to hunt down someone under lvl 10 and dump a ton of chems and food on them.
---
Everyday. Only way to get my wings.
---
Okay I'll give that a try on my private server.
---
I don,t. I am not there to get Legendaries.
---
Thank you! I figured thats what you meant haha (on a site, I just didnt know the name of it yet) :)
---
Whatever you say.
---
I honestly don't remember his name but is RP was on fire.
---
The legendary run was not in the PTS
---
Definitely a highlight.
---
I'm aware of the daily bullion exchange limit but not the weekly. What's the weekly limit? I know there's a carry limit of 3000 bullion, but it's not a "weekly" carry limit. 
---
If you can only get 200 bullion a day from exchanging treasury notes, how do you get more than 1400 bullion a week? (Excluding buying 300 gold with 6000 caps)
---
You would need 2 exchange systems for caps. Like another currency for the weekly to match the gold system. Maybe trade gold for caps?
---
The framerate really get's me, MW2019? Tlou2? the frames on these masive high def games are the best my ps4 can do but when I boot up 76 (a 2 year old not too grafically advanced game) I feel like in a powerpoint presentation.
---
Are you actively farming for it?  If so, where and how?
---
They had to fill out a support ticket.
---
nice
---
What do you think they were going to announce for FO76? Bug fixes for things we’ve actually asked for? At this point that would be better accepted than new content...
---
Scrap Everything is awesome if you have a NASA pc and don‘t plan on adding any settlement blueprints later down the line. 
---
Scrap Everything breaks PreVis and PreCombs which just messes with your FPS especially in places like Boston. it would kill the game in a „multiplayer“ like fo76 lol.
---
Fuck the Foundation, fuck em to fuckery bunch of commies
---
Same story. Some high level helped me early too. Paying it forward by helping any low level I can.
---
Who u/ladydevann ?
---
You are playing a video game, of course you are going to have fun! Who cares if the sub is in flames or protesting, you do you especially if you are enjoying.
---
Lol coal.
---
Well said
---
Servers only hold 24 people. There is zero way to have a “dead server” since the number of servers increases or decreases based on players online. If there are 100,000 people playing you will see 24 people on a server. If there are only 24 people... those 24 will all be in one server.
---
It’s impossible to tell how many people are online based on your server. It’s not like they have a fixed number of servers that they spread people across. Servers are dynamic.
---
I actually stopped using adrenaline.  Didn’t realize how much those 5 points were being wasted.
---
As long as it doesn’t break lore using any specific indicia outside of the game universe, that would be interesting.
---
Well thanks for all the tips and advice. Looks like I've got a busy weekend of fusion core farming ahead of me.
---
Not all of us throw trash at newbies, i personally like to craft them a set of whatever armour is best for their level, fully mod it out to be even better, then give them a selection of weapons and ammo for them.  
---
Like you said though, im not exactly bent of resources but i would always at least try to help people even if it wasnt a resource.  
---
I tag legendary enemies then wave over the crowds if im playing public so other can get a hit, and if im playing with low levels ill damage mobs to the point where they can finish them and get XP for the kills too, its just part of being a team player, not everyone is like that though and ive seen more than my fair share of people who are just trying to flex on other players, but there is generally speaking a higher number of nice players in FO76 than in other games ive played.
---
I'll be farming the golf clubs non stop until the event is done. I can't wait to look at all the cork I don't donate.
---
Welcome to the Wasteland, frend!
---
As a proud owner of a full unyielding urban scout set plus the urban scout mask... this ghillie skin is pretty rough looking. And That’s without considering the clipping issues.
---
Honestly I think I’d be okay if they removed the ghillie stuff and just let us have the green scout skin underneath.
---
(It’s also very annoying that the ghillie suit and ghillie suit headwear is a DIFFERENT SHADE of ghillie compared to the ghillie backpack and ghillie scout skin... the ghillie scout mask and headwear from the NW ghillie suit would have looked awesome together but they’re two different colors.)
---
if you full health stealth rifleman you can still kill them in 1 shot
---
Only way I'd see them doing it is another atomic shop or fo1st item like scrap and repair boxes and that would be doing something similar to the fo4 mod salvage beacons. 
---
Drop a beacon, a handy comes out and grabs everything lootable in an area and cargobot picks it up and brings it back to you.
---
1.  Armor that is worn under your power armor does not provide any additional protection.
---
2. Why are you building weapons?  Is it for learning weapon mods?  If not you are better just repairing the ones you have.
---
3.  It sounds like you have not found as much scrap as you think or you have used a lot of it without realizing.  Make sure you have the [Scrapper Perk](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Scrapper_(perk)) enabled each time you scrap weapons and armor (does not work when scrapping power armor).
---
The guy was behind me that attacked it. He killed it and ran off in the other room. The others was running out of the room on the other side of the main room.
---
Just waiting for the blue screen lol
---
I look stuff for a reason. If you break into my house and steel stuff from me, I kill you, no matter what level you are. 
---
If you ask me, I’m glad to give you stuff! There is a reason why some food and water isn’t locked (I have a house near vault so it’s basically the first player house they see).
---
Awesome.  Maybe they’ll get the respawn bug if they die at the end of the event.
---
I'm on Xbox and have never seen a normal play session that's gone dead.
---
It can get quiet at odd hours and even then it's not dead. Sometimes it may seem so if you have a noob heavy server and they all congregate in the forest areas. 
---
I have seen numbers dwindle occasionally but it's always been shortly before the server maintenance warning pops up. An hour alone on such a big map is a little surreal.
---
no downside to dying which make bloodied super attractive
---
The unbearable framerate on console is far and away my number one gripe. It's unplayable on my high level char. I die to lag everytime. That's on Private. On Public server any Event can possibly crash to Home. I fear lag over any enemy type. My favorite game gives me anxiety.
---
This is why I left the game, although it is cool people helping each other and being friendly I noticed that Bethesda is catering to these kind of players. For me I enjoy more hardcore pvp games and this game is going on the opposite direction, its fine but just not for me.
---
Chaotic evil lmao
---
Well it took them about 13 minutes to kill it so it shouldn't be too bad of an event.
---
Whenever you spawn into your camp, or when another player approaches your camp, enemies will spawn.  These enemies may kill your pet.
---
If you put your camp in an area that spawns ~lv 5 enemies he should be ok. Otherwise he will eventually get swarmed by something ge can't handle and die.  
---
He will dissappear eventually but I've had mine a couple months now in a low lv area.  When I spawn in he's usually killed the random enemies that spawn in while I'm loading.
---
Sentry bots have a tenancy to disappear after exploding in general.
---
So for sentry, always loot before it explodes.
---
No stealth baby, guns blazin' is how I like to play. Loud and proud. ☺️
---
Supposedly they are looking into it. Its incredibly frustrating and has been going on for way too long.
---
is there a group role-playing The Kings from New Vegas?
---
They should just remove the limits in general, they are just there to slow progression, and if I worked for all the legendaries and treasury notes I have I should be able to scrip them whenever I want and how many I want like every other game
---
If you look through reddit you will find many others with the same concerns.
---
I'm not announcing departure but rasing a flag
---
If I'm not allowed to raise a flag because you have an opposite opinion, then this is a logical fallacy, since then you also shouldn't have an opinion.
---
Just because you share your opinion with the creators of the game doesn't make it more correct than others' opinions
---
When I see a post like this I'm just like, "let me Google that for you dear."
---
No, unlike everything else you cannot learn the mods from scrapping. They are only available as mods (the wooden boxes) you can purchase and apply. There is a double bar (basically makes it 2 chainsaw blades side by side) another bar mod that makes the blade area a large loop (not as much damage as double bar but increases reach) and the flamer attachment (works with both).
---
You can find a chainsaw in the reactor area of the Free Radicals lumber camp, sometimes there is one on a shelf in the shed at the ranger station in the bog, and I forget the other place.
---
The flamer attachment is a must, as the fire plus the constant damage effect does most of the damage. Otherwise it's like the Mr Handy buzz saw thing.
---
One (small) downside is the thing weighs 10 lbs and from memory that weight is not reducible by any of the weight perk cards.
---
I only use my camp to loot the generators, ammo/milk/water/ally/drugs and none of that is important enough for me to care about.  I don't care if my vending machines are up because I'm generally near cap limit, and I know where benches and stash boxes are are and are usually near them going to Crater, Foundation or Mole Miner anyway.
---
So overall, I don't really give a crap if my camp is available or not.
---
How wholesome! Welp time for my daily nuking of the Atlas Observatory.
---
Sincerely,
---
A high level day one player that left and came back to wastelanders after a year off.
---
sounds like an incredibly random and rare occurrence. I wouldn't get too worked up about it.
---
You deserve more then a single karma, sadly I only can give you only one.
---
It's not just interior walls. There is only one option for brick right now, as far as I'm aware. Wall-Brick. I have used Atoms to get several wallpapers which look like brick [like this one](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Atomic_Shop/C.A.M.P.?file=FO76_ATX_Limestone_wallpaper.jpg) which resemble  as close as anything else in game certain wall styles actually present in West Virginia [Like this one in Harper's Ferry](https://appalachiantrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DSCN1261.jpg)
---
Kiyomi thinks that is the SMART choice.
---
Still waiting on my combat helmet with a working light but good luck with the rest of that man !
---
I agree tbh.  I can already kill everything instantly.  Why waste points with over kill.
---
It only took one duper to get that amount
---
Nah I'm an idiot for buying this game at full price , pre-ordered, and playing all this time despite the game being a pile of crap lol. BUT I do love the community and LOVE to help players out!
---
I got downvoted to hell when making a post about how the framerate suck so I guess they’re fine
---
It is I the corker
---
Yep. Lets find a cork duper.
---
So you are not familiar with this I think. You have the opportunity to buy an extra amount once a week so you can get over 1400 a week ;-)
---
Hope you understand now. It seems not to be easy to understand...
---
What if i told you that you could have both by not being a selfish clownshoe for just 5 seconds?
---
I get that, it's just been quite the last couple days. That's all. Just wanted to know if anyone else has experienced it too.
---
I don't play pvp much either, and mostly treat 76 just like the rest of the series.  But GTA 5 had a pacifist type mode as well, and their was a fair amount of pvp from what I remember.
---
You can check the progress and dates [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
The question is why would one use anything but a bloodied build.
---
On paper, mathematically, scientifically and spiritually a bloodied build is the most efficient build there is. Nothing comes close. And unarmed is just bananas. You are running around with 3k dmg per hit and almost nothing can kill you. On top of that, if you swap out 3 perks, you are a bloodied heavy gunner.
---
Omg such a cute post. (´∩｡• ᵕ •｡∩`)
---
I *will*  say that the toxicity is mostly targeted at Beth (and deservedly so sometimes), but really very rarely at other players.
---
&gt;	The movement
---
??
---
Look at all the work people have to do to kill your cowardly ass in this game.
---
It’ll unlock in the Atomic Shop on the 11th. It’s in this week’s ITV.
---
The same thing happened to me when I first got on Fallout even though I had it during beta I stopped playing for a little bit came back and I was still a low level all of the high-level players really helped me out same thing left gifts at my Camp I would see them in passing and they would just stop me and give me stuff sometimes I would even be running away from a creature I can't possibly fight and would have people come to my rescue the community on this game is amazing and is also the reason it is one of my favorite games everybody is so kind and helpful now I am a level 120 and I repeat the same things that people did for me to other players constantly giving away stimpacks food water cems legendaries you name it if I don't need it I will give it away before I sell it
---
Well, I got her from the Sorchbeast Queen's rotting corpse.
---
Whoever they are, they need professional help 😂
---
This..very much this.
---
It’s all BoS
---
Who said the only happiness I get from life is from a game... You’re the one projecting that about so yourself. That’s why you have a mental break down when someone ruins your day by taking your junk
---
Yeah that's all I meant it's been quite.
---
Guess that means it'll never get nerfed or rebalanced
---
Well, yes, they were all bloodied. 
---
Imagine the same scenario without a bloodied or a magic weapon user. That countdown is extremely tight.
---
Then what is the point I  having any other class of weapons or perks if that's the case. Why isnt the game just mechanically built to make everyone a bloodied build.
---
It's good to have a challenge and experiment.
---
Did that event last night and the walls near the two turrets at either end of the room were "dissolving" from all the meat piles near them; idk how to describe it, just one of the weirdest looking bugs I've seen, wished I had OBS running at the time to document it
---
Really? Cause they all got wiped, and I see Bloodied builds die all the time
---
yeah man, but i am usually stoned and forget what i was talkin about.
---
Edit: i thought i was still on r/trees
---
They fucking rock. I love my Teslas. Definitely make it auto.
---
Imo this would ruin daily players by making them wait a whole week until they can sell again.
---
not only range but melee happens too, on west tek I literally fight the same super mutant for 1 min doing power atack on him of 900 dmg he ended killing me and on vats my character miss all the hits.
---
the one counter point is people who afk for events. But there should be other checks to weed out the afk people. If you healed somebody, if you did damage to any of the enemies, if you repaired one of the machines, if you were a conduit, if you added ingredients to the hopper, etc.
---
Yeah I just checked my stash and it's at 538 weight so I'm getting there...most of it is junk and chems. I don't use chems so I can sell them but still, 800 carry weight is not a whole lot. It should be increased.
---
This stream is absolutely awful
---
A 600 plus level player gave me a bag of plans yesterday (I'm level 110).  There were a few I didn't have and the rest I put in the overseer crate at The Wayward.  You don't need to be at a stratospheric level to play it forward.
---
OK. I played around with it, mean gun for sure. Is there anyway to up the ammo capacity?
---
I get bored. I decided that when I come across a basic weapon I like to build it up just to see how powerful it is. 
---
My excavator armor has served me well and offers more protection than my non PA armor. I never focused on builds using perks so my armor is rather generic. 
---
I’ll check my scrapper perk. 
---
You can but you have to manually stash it which is an unnecessary second step.
---
I,m not I was just trying to let people know that just because some of us are high-level players does not automatically mean we did it.
---
The Beret will unlock on in the Atomic Shop on the 11th. Alongside the Standing Banner, if we achieve the goal. Says so in this week’s ITV I believe.
---
Sounds like you paid to increase the difficult. 
---
\*Bam\* “Check out this sweet new harcore mode that comes with a free skin!” Marketing Team.
---
If they post anything people would just get mad that something was missing or put i. They didn’t want. They probably just didn’t want to have a trailer at all
---
I can agree to this, other live services offer so much more for premium subscriptions, and perhaps all these you mentioned would tempt more people to subscribe
---
This is still a problem even after the update. 😭
---
I use a Tesla as a rifleman and it works great with my perks and not being automatic. Try it out before modifying it!
---
With the right food and chem buffs I can do as much damage as a bloodied player with full health.  So if players know how to maximize their damage output it won’t necessarily depend on bloodied players.
---
I do this. I also like to leave bags of goodies in front of The Wayward for whomever needs them.
---
I guess they're the brotherhood of cork now?
---
I agree again. Choices are a big part of the Fallout series for me. I liked being able to mostly do what I wanted throughout the game. Like side quests, you don't HAVE to do them to finish, but you can.
---
Opposite of you, I choose to finish as many challenges as possible, but your style isn't wrong, and mine isn't right. And if one comes up that I really don't feel like doing, then I don't. I'll get to the end with other challenges, or spend a couple bucks.
---
I don't understand why people think they must do every challenge. It's a choice.
---
Is he the crazy one or are we the crazy ones for giving him massive amounts of scrap for a hat/fatigues and a BOS flagpole... I'm starting to think this guy found a warehouse full of BOS apparel and decided to hustle Appalachia
---
A living needle in the haystack, hopefully some of that good community can spread
---
&gt; pixellation
---
that's the word I'm looking for, the walls were doing this the other night in Radiation Rumble, bizarre looking
---
I always take their junk..... teaches a valuable lesson in inventory management. I then find the lowest level on the map and drop it for them.
---
Welcome Friend
---
I found one at tyler county dirt track up in the control room over looking the place. It was on the left side of the room on a table.
---
Nahh no one's taken my junk ever.......And yeah yeah you can project these nuts.......Also I said the only happiness you get is from bullying people.......The same way you came into the comments trying to bully me however I don't really care what you think or do because you are irrelevant.......If only you realized how insignificant you really are......
---
I scrap everything.  I’m not picky.  I mainly hit mole miners and supermutants to scrap the weapons they drop. Out of my time each day playing I usually scrap for about an hour nonstop out of boredom waiting for an event to pop up.
---
I try to just get a shot in but honestly if I kill it and others don't get a shot I don't really care. Theres always another
---
Oooooook “Hardly Honest”. I believe you. You didn’t murder any Assaultron Anywhere. That head appeared in the stomach of a “Scorchbeast Queen” and you just dug it out and, kaboom there it was. I read somewhere that mythical giant winged monsters enjoy eating robots. Mhm, Sure I did :) ...
---
The post-it is a great idea! lmao
---
It's true though...
---
With some NPCs, you cannot skip ANY dialog or they have a high probability of freezing, sometimes it's so bad you have to start the conversation over. A few like Davenport, I can skip about as fast as I can press the button.
---
Steam numbers haven’t dropped. 8,700 on right now
---
After losing a friend to the ban wave I have to say it's the players that make this game what it is and not the game itself. Without the community this game would have died a long time a go.
---
Oof :(
---
Wow you can't? That's lame. I have been looking forward to building a set and displaying it but now my dreams are ruined. I haven't found the plan for a station yet.
---
People can say what they want to, but it doesn't make it true.
---
Lol of course it does... Wtf
---
Love seeing the random acts in the game.  I’ve left plans and amp for people where I can.
---
The character model showing the beret looks constipated.
---
All I want is a tent skin that looks like The Highwayman from Fallout 2. 
---
It would be so badass to drop that bad boy. Trunk is the storage space, Grill off the hood LOL
---
 I wouldn't look at f76 devs as an example of any build. Those guys can barely do their jobs.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTac4ojP9iA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTac4ojP9iA) . That's a better example. I'm just stating facts. I don't give a shit what build people use. Just saying that on paper nothing comes close to a bloodied build for a vast variety of reasons.
---
I think the best thing an entertainment worker or company can do is sell entertainment 
---
The definition of success in any field is defined by "ones success in doing his job" and for a company working in entertainment you should provide the services advertised which is entertainment
---
If you are an entertainment provider and you are trying to acquire your profits through something else then this is not success, this is manipulation 
---
Keeping customers going the extra mile and banking on it hile appling bad practices, is the downfall of many big titles in the entertainment industry 
---
And i don't want to see this happen to bethesda
---
I find cheap reasonable prices for both parties is the way to sell things.
---
Well, there are many reasonable things. But then there is also a slew of things that are impossible in this engine, entirely unnecessary, and/or extremely pedantic at this point in time. Like right now we have people complaining about massive fps drops under certain conditions after the last update, making the game almost unplayable in those cases, but I bet you there's going to be another front page post about adding more emotes to the atom shop within the next 72 hours
---
That's why I would suggest a weekly plus a daily limit. Or the "skipped" days can accumulate to another limit. But you are right to be fair daily players should have an advantage over someone that login once a week. I agree with you on this point. What would you suggest?
---
I mean I took like 1/4 of them? Chill
---
I don't PVP because I use a mod for inventory management, NW hates this and won't let me attend.
---
Thank you so much!
---
I get it, everyone is doing it for SCORE, but if you're buying 1 ammo it must be something you need, I mean no seems to ever buy 10mm ammo.   Thus if you're going to spend the money to fast travel to a camp buy 50 or 100 of it and make the trip worthwhile.
---
One more day to go.
---
That's odd. If you're already trying it with admin privileges, the only other thing I could think of would be to close the game pass app or do a full computer restart to make sure it isn't treating the files as currently in use
---
I always sell plans for 10% of the suggested price.
---
Honestly I just use whatever I have a hell of a lot of ammo for like yesterday I helped take her down with a 10mm submachine gun because I happened to have 3k rounds of ammo for it. As well as bunker buster because I had 35 rounds for it.
---
He has 2k steel up his ass.
---
They already acknowledged and said they are going to make them. What are you trying to accomplish?
---
Just use Bash to punch them in the face and move on.
---
To what end? They’ve already responded, it’s not like harassing them on the livestream will do anything.
---
Nah doubt it probably be a few year minimum, they invested too much into the game, if anything it’ll be handed over to another subsidiary and have them work full time on it.
---
I’m level 124: sometimes I run West Tek &amp; Huntersville, and still can’t level up.
---
The other problem is that it leads you to grind EXP instead of doing other things you may want to do in the game, like exploring or scavenging.
---
Biggest frustration is how no brainer some other “challenges” can be in comparison, such as eating bubblegum or placing your CAMP once in NW.
---
And even with all that said, it’s still not the worst offender, with some challenges such as “kill 6 creatures in NW” (seriously, kill randomly spawning NPCs in the pure PVP mode? Quite contradictory IMHO) or kill 3 legendary enemies/a single 3-star legendary enemy sometimes depending more on luck (right event popping, someone else not instantly killing the necessary enemy, etc.).
---
I carry a 10mm as well just to tag.  Happens a lot now it seems since people are complaining about it.
---
They also got the fast travel bug. :p
---
This is Bethesda....I don't think they know what the word free means.
---
Talk to Charisse (sp?) in the wayward.
---
Yes! The Frame Rate drop is Unbelievable!
---
Simple way to test that: take off the backpack and see how many rads you take.
---
Yea bloodied should have way more downsides for the buffs it gives. Maybe all the rads make you glow and therefor your are terrible at stealth?
---
Gold bullion has two exchange systems. One for treasury-&gt;gold and one for caps-&gt;gold. Treasury to gold is daily, caps to gold is weekly. So to have a weekly and daily "cap limit" you would need two exchanges. 
---
Inventory-&gt;caps (daily vendors) and something like scrip-&gt;caps for the weekly.
---
I keep pacifist on all my characters jbc I know there's bloodied shotgun chodes around every corner waiting to show how cool they are by blowing somebody away at the first sign they have a chance to. PVP does not belong in with people who want to play PVE without them little brats running around.
---
Yeah, it’s possible , my favorite type is both starting at the bridge in the forest at opposite ends
---
Beret will be available (for free) in the Atom Shop on August 11th.
---
As someone who uses a telsa rifle, keep it single shot unless it's quad or vampiric, and if it's the former you'll need the auto reload perk. With 60 rounds it takes only a couple seconds to empty out. Without it you'll spend more time reloading then shooting.
---
Please take OPs feedback seriously.
---
IIRC They said it would be available August 11th
---
"We stayed in the PvP mode, you guys knew for a goddamn fact that we'd all be there and you still went on for PvP." So you agree with me. You guys made survival the way it was, ruining it. Its not playing smart its exploitative. but I'm sure you would die on this hill.
---
Yeah i too have the Urban scout mask. 
---
No idea why Bethesda decided to make the mask uber rare.
---
If it's the latter*
---
There's literally a perk for running around full of rads.
---
Well said . Obviously things such as optimizations take priority . I just don’t get what the point of complaining about the bos event is doing for anyone
---
Me and my friend already put in the t-fuse and the blood sample before. Now it wont let me put in the blood sample again, and always says "error - no sample". Any idea of a workaround?
---
I can vouch that this bug has never left the game.
---
It is the reason I don't do headshots, most mobs don't die when they get over 3k dmg on the first shot.
---
My main issue with the event isn't even the ammo dump itself, there are ways around that.
---
My main issue is the instanced to 8 bullshit. There is no guarantee you get grouped with the people you wanted to and end up in a group of low level randos who have no idea what's going on. No offense to low levels but for special events I prefer people I know I can rely on.
---
Nah don't feel guilty. If I drop it it's because I don't want it but I consider it too valuable to just trash it. Honestly if you take my stuff you're really doing me a huge favor too.
---
This community for me have proved time and time again that help is always available. Those who are willing to help those even in times of struggle and despair have always been there to lend advice, build advice even where to place your C.A.M.P given certain circumstances. 
---
One of the most helpful communities I've stumbled upon in all the years I've been gaming... and I've been gaming since the late 90s.
---
I just want to than you for posting. I wade through all the posts bitching about features, (yeah they lied and don’t listen to their community, let’s try and hit the acceptance stage.) just to find posts like yours with neat stories about adventures they have had. Thanks for toughing through all the bugs and having some fun!
---
Running around at a 50/50 distribution of HP and Rads isn't really taking advantage of Bloodied.
---
That, and Devann was using a sluggish Super Sledge and couldn't one-shot the Wendigo Spawn, despite them doing it to her, so it's likely there were some missing perks because that shouldn't happen.
---
Fireproof is also going to be important, because the burn damage from the Colossus, and presumably the ceiling as well, will give Bloodieds a hard time.
---
Neat, I really like the blue light from that vault-tec lamp, so this + those lamps probably will get you some really cool lighting going on.
---
First gun was probably a magic effect shotgun. Next two were not.
---
This has caused me loads of confusion.  I'm still low level and typically try to do events a bit.  Play solo as I have no friends that play, so I will wait for the ones who are actually dealing real damage to go in and loot before I check stuff.  I figure this is courteous and I try to respect the other players.  Then any time I go to loot, nothing is there.  So can we 100% confirm that loot is all shared?  I can't seem to find a clear answer.  I've seen yes and I've seen no.   I really don't want to be greedy, but I need some good gears lol
---
Yeah, owns. :D
---
Buy it on steam, play it for just under two hours, realize that won't really give you an accurate depiction of the game and either bite the bullet and keep it, or return it.
---
Yeah was laughing at that myself
---
Fallout 76 literally gets more attention than Quake at quakecon
---
What are the other legendary effects on the nocturnal weapon?
---
Get yourself a stealth shotgun build and an instigating pump action shotgun! I can one shot most enemies short of bosses
---
My recollection from FO4 was that you'd detect enemies through walls and obstacles, whether you could see them or not, without a scope.  Distance based on perception.
---
Or she is good at her job and chose not to draw attention to it...
---
or something else.
---
They already hit the goal so unless you want the plans or caps, you don’t need to donate anymore steel
---
Being able to play with your friends is a huge upside.
---
Literally there isn’t one.
---
Thank you for commenting. Aside from the point that I’m extremely freaking jealous that you do over 3K damage in one shot in the first place ( teach me sensei?), You are the second or third person who has said it never left the game. I will say just to be fair to myself and a few others who had my experience, I didn’t have this problem before and I do now. That doesn’t mean it was the patch nor does it mean that the problem was ever fixed, there are a lot of variables here, but all I can say for sure is that at one point super mutant head just go pop, but now goes , po- po- pop. Now that the pleasantries have been dealt with, feel free to donate all of your armor, perk points, weapons, and general badassery to me. Kthx
---
Following is a 100% true story. Seriously.
---
I came across the chainsaw when I was around level 23 IIRC. I was having a hard time with ferals, none of my weapons at the time had any decent stopping power so they constantly were in my face and irradiating me or giving me diseases. 
---
I had found the flamer attachment...somewhere...and added it, however, I had just stuck the chainsaw back in my stash and ignored it. I stumbled into the Burrows one day (lvl 30) and promptly got my ass handed to me on a platter. I used up almost all my ammo when I kept trying to get back to my dropped stash and retrieve it. On a whim I equipped the chainsaw, ran to a doorway to funnel the 300 ghouls chasing me into a bottleneck, just stood there with the chainsaw activated and thrust out in front of me, screaming like a little girl. The slaughter was glorious. Took down 15 ferals in like 20 seconds, lost only 1/8th of my health bar in the process. 
---
After I finally retrieved my crap I teleported to Dolly Sods to return the bloatfly pieces as part of the Scouts quest. I forgot that I had equipped the chainsaw and I fast traveled right into the backside of that damn lvl 65 dusky Yao Guai that trots back and forth in front of the entrance. Was a massive "Oh Shit!" moment. I started running circles around that thing for all I was worth hitting it with the chainsaw constantly, it kept getting staggered so it couldn't swipe me. Long story short it died, I didn't, and that chainsaw is still my go-to for up close and personal.
---
I'll give it a run tonight - off work for the weekend so I'll let you know Monday what works with it...be great if it worked with unarmed (as that's what I'm running right now).
---
To be fair,  charred ghouls are just powerful.  Don't feel bad, blocker perks always helps.
---
Don't give a BS "can't" excuse. I'm a bloody rifle build who one shots everything but I carry an explosive 10mm for tagging. There is no can't, only people who wont.
---
What kind of vendors should I go for to find the mods? Or is it just any? I will be going to the lumbermill now.
---
I haven't had to edit any files... yet.
---
That's the way, pay it forward.
---
I have noticed this too. It happens quite often now. Kinda like they are Legendary and then not?
---
:)
---
I was certainly hoping for a chance at least on any plans I may not have, but this is a ridiculous waste of time
---
I remember when they were datamined and everyone was screaming ITS A MICROTRANSATION and shit like that lol
---
I think normally you'd be right, but this community is a weird one. At this point the game is pretty cheap to run. You have a bare bones skeleton staff for the dev team, couple of community managers, and the servers scale up/down based on demand. I imagine this team is only 10-15 full time employees at this point. They probably burst up to 30-40 for stuff like Wastelanders, but then those folks go back to their other long term projects.
---
If the money keeps coming in, and the community keeps playing despite a lack of content, goodwill or bug fixes why shut it down? I do think the plan is for this title to keep the lights on at Bethesda until their next title can ship. They've probably largely made their money back at this point, and are mostly in the phase of collecting small, incremental profits month over month.
---
Of course, there's the chance I'm wrong and they're bleeding money month to month. If that's the case, this game is undoubtedly dead before 2021 rolls around. I think they're making money though, and we know they're not investing the money into _this_ title, so why close the money faucet.
---
Someone, somewhere, totally regrets naming this quest "A Colossal Problem" because the jokes literally write themselves.
---
1-3 seem fine to me. Score I don’t think should be doubled as it’s just more reason to make acquiring score harder and force players to need FO1st to enjoy endgame content. If we want a system like that, we could play any other battle pass game. Part of why I like FO76 is because I don’t have to invest heavily into a season pass just for content that others are earning at a much lesser effort. I can see small bonuses, but FO1st already has many ways to get nice looking cosmetics with membership and Bethesda still has to hold up to their promise of atomic shop discounts.
---
Larger budget or size seems like just a paywall for content that should be included in the game already. I’d rather Bethesda focus on creating dedicated servers so you can keep your workshops when you log off, but camps need to be better for everyone. 
---
Overall, I think there are still a lot of ways FO1st members SHOULD be rewarded, just I don’t think 4 and 5 are a good precedent for future development.
---
The nocturnal was a lv45 2*. The first effect being obvious and second being extra bashing damage. I don't see how this would relate to magic perks.
---
If you're str is more than 11, bonus strength isn't given from chassis.
---
It means he's an idiot.
---
u/Ladydevann Response?
---
You're welcome.   ;)
---
Then don’t do it
---
Yeah or they could just make those mobs have more hp..... since no one has trouble with them anymore. I always try and wait until everyone has tagged it. Don’t get shitty at me for bad game design.
---
I take it you haven't encountered a Colossus yet?  They have been a random encounter in nuke zones for a few months since wastelanders came out, including the fear effect.  This is just a new event with a boss version of what was already in the game.
---
Bethesda handing off one of their main IPs to another company? No. Won't happen. Not ever.
---
Have you not seen the animosity they have about NV being the best Fallout title that was NOT made by Bethesda? It's rated higher than all Bethesda Fallouts to date and I don't think they'll ever get over that fact.
---
They won't ever give the FO IP to anybody else to work on. The fact that 76 is being run by Bethesda Austin says it all.
---
Awful bold of you to assume that those of us who play and enjoy NW are sociopathic COD babies and, you know, not people who can enjoy more than one game mode.
---
I’m perfectly fine with the NW challenges because they are weighted against the adventure mode challenges quite nicely at a 1:8 ratio. The time you don’t spend in NW to earn that challenge will be paid back in score points via the repeatable XP challenge. You’re not really losing out on anything, and NW players have a nice little bonus for supporting the game mode through play. Every one is a winner.
---
Like they have serendipity from the Agi tree. Yup.
---
Hey buddy. I'm down. Not sure what you had in mind but imagination makes us happy. Add me "Egroegy".
---
I'm Pacific time ps4
---
There were a few comments “ohhh a rolling pin.” 
---
She’s as much a face for BGS’s playerbase as Todd is for their leadership. Like you said, she just knows what she says will represent the entire company.
---
Ok.
---
I have 4 chars, 3 are low health one is berserker. You've got to have some sort of drawback to get big damage folks, I just cannot understand why people would think whatever mutant or anti-armor weapon they picked up should pack the same punch as the much riskier prefixes.
---
Did you people not play at launch? for months the most powerful prefix had almost no drawback, just lesser accuracy and increased wear and tear on the weapon. And it was ridiculous broken garbage and had to be nerfed into the ground. 
---
The bloodied meta is nothing like that, the players are glass cannons. This meta has been in place for so long simply because it is so much more equitable than what there was before. The only balance suggestions I'd have would be to buff the type-specific weapons (Zealot's, ghoul slayers etc) up to 50% increased damage against type.
---
Yeah I think you see my point. There are different ways to implement this. Some may be good some not so good =)
---
The idea is you collect multiple rewards for the chance to 'rare' plans. All the other items are pretty meh for any high level players and I sell mine almost immediately.
---
Ive done nothing special except load up the scrapper perk. I'm no BoS fanboy so Ive put in no extra effort but I've still managed around 3k of steel.
---
I’m on PS4
---
Aside from nocturnal being massively more powerful than troubleshooters at night 6pm to 6am in game time I believe thats also a "magic" weapon as the bashing damage effect can bug out your damage.  Look up angryturtle on youtube he has several very detailed videos on "magic" weapons.
---
I mean: *gestures to sub being on fire the other day*
---
I made a full health build out of spite. Vanguard, Sun Kissed, Ghoulish, Healing Factor. It's perfect viable with the right magic shotgun.
---
Getting the framerates up and not making the game stop working inside instances, took a little doing:P
---
But... That literally defeats the entire purpose of my Unyielding agility boost, so no. If I’m not using stealth, I die very quickly. Hell, even though I have all the cards to increase stealth and 35 agility I’m still being spotted constantly by tweaked out drug addicts from 50 yards away.
---
My Vanguard Medic Build is dope tho
---
Wait you can heal the NPCs in this event???
---
I’m on ps4
---
Hey... staypositive
---
I have a Two-Shot Automatic Tesla, works great for tagging things at events without killing.
---
I know my opinion is the unpopular one, but maybe it’s my years of playing games like WoW or Everquest, but I never understood why we even do “tagging” in this game, other than because it lets us.  
---
I’m used to, if you kill a ”boss” that drops a good item, only one person in the group can get it. Need vs. Greed rolls.  Personally I think this game would be much better if all legendaries were harder to come by, but that ship already sailed when the purveyor was released. 
---
Now I’ll be nice and not try to one shot legendaries when they show up, but I also don’t even focus on the legendaries and focus on completing the event goal.  This has often pissed people off that I’m not sitting there trying to farm legendaries. My goal is to get the caps, XP, and treasury notes.
---
i played since beta and i distinctly recall a popup saying something to the effect of "welcome to level 5! pvp is now enabled. you can turn on pacifist mode in the options menu."
---
That’s weird but also made me giggle
---
It's not even a fun build tho
---
Fireproof 3 and a dense/asbestos chestplate ;)
---
Lol why? The frame rate is real garbage. I play on a standar PS4 and got my ethernet cable connected to it but still the frame rate its just awful. So i agree with you about the frame rate of the game.
---
What are the effects on your nocturnal shotgun?
---
It might be one of the magical ones.
---
Yeah, tried that...No go, unfortunately. Thx anyways.
---
Anyone who shoots you for killing an enemy is an asshole, full stop. 
---
Totally agree that it's a very cool thing to do to help others get legendaries, but absolutely by no means is it required or mandatory.
---
Loud and Proud simply won’t cut it as a Bloodied build. You don’t have enough HP to do that.
---
I agree and many of those who seen Beth roots are dismayed. I'd like to point out Zenimax leadership... By no means are they gaming people. Matter of fact... If you Google them... You may be a bit scared. If you see the leaders of other gaming companies and franchise you can see the difference. I would put money on there being some internal artistic and business differences. 
---
I work in props and costumes. I've made some crazy cool stuff. I bet you've seen it. But being the person who makes it I realize as someone in the profession you come close every day to complete failure. Maybe the wrong supplies come. Or an essential employee gets sick and calls out. So many elements that can change the dynamic of creating.
---
I think 76 will.be a culture shock for Beth. They got hit hard. If the next fallout installment fails to deliver something that's perfect and amazing I'd say they and the brand are in trouble. 76 was an experiment and a game with a huge identity crisis. Was it PvP? Was it MMO? Was it single or multiplayer? If you read some of the comments from the devs early on we weren't even supposed to have camps. PvP was supposed to be the driving force too.
---
Either way I'm here for the ride and hope the best for the game the franchise and Bethesda. I want great games. Simply put.
---
Poor design.
---
I think people are pretty defending of this game after all the blowback at launch. Sadly helps Bethesda get away with alot
---
I assume every wanted player I see is bait and their high level, pvp geared friend is hiding and waiting nearby.
---
There's an issue with every hit now, I'm melee and 75% of the time my first hit does zero damage even though the damage numbers pop up
---
no, fuck paywalling core gameplay benefits.
---
Which is silly, did they not see the nerd rage/unyielding builds from Fallout 4?
---
* You're
---
Please? I asked nicely 😂. And a good bear arm would complete my collection.
---
Dumb question but, do you have it equiped?
---
Bloodied builds are the Mages of the Fallout76 universe.... but really whats the point of healing perks/items if theres no real penalty from dieing?
---
I agree! I recently came back to 76 for Wastelanders and was only a level 28, now thanks to grinding at the game with all of its new content and help from higher levels I am now level 67 and climbing fast! Thanks for a great community for a game that deserves it!
---
Ran across one vendor area near whitesprings and found a bag on the ground. Had over 100 plans in it. I crapped myself! Picked up all and selling in my vendor for dirt cheap! Don't need the caps and I don't want other players to buy them and sell them at their camp for outrageous prices! However, that being said. Every time I run across a low level player I drop them all they take what they don't have then I pick em up. Salute! On my way to the next culprit!
---
That’s what I don’t think ppl get. Bloodied builds are good for bosses normally, albeit a team of bloodies was a dumb choice. If the enemy is spongy, you want something that will wring it out.

Same way my melee build is useless so often at SBQ. Tanks are better when being swarmed by ghouls. PA can fight easily in rad zones. Bloodied is generally more fun to play cause you have to watch your ho and you can kill easily, so it’s a fun challenge endgame. It’s never going to be a perfect balance, but there’s always a situation where someone else is better.
---
its a community challenge. if the goal is reached, all players in the clmmunity get the reward.
---
the individual rewards for donating scrap are the atlas provision boxes, which are kinda useless for high level players but are great for those who are either just starting a character or still need a few plans. it can be assumed they will be the same for every challenge during the event, so if you missed the steel donations, you can still get them if you want them.
---
no, I have never seen one down there yet
---
I feel you. The game i played on my console before 76 was Red Dead Redemption 2, one of the best looking games to date and also, one of the most demanding but still, runs smoothly.
---
But when i play 76 it just feels wrong. Frame rate drops to a point where nuke zones are unplayeable
---
Don’t listen to them! 
---
You need to properly recycle such a sad weapon. You probably don’t want to get caught wielding such a pathetic weapon yourself but luckily I know a guy who can properly get rid of it for you.
---
Your very fortunate, that you have met me a great recycler of sad weapon . 
---
👍👌🤲
---
To be fair, a larger build limit is something that Bethesda did say would be part of 1st, when they originally announced it.
---
I did that event last month with 4 high level characters showing up in power armour...wouldn't take it off. I tried to play the instruments to get stuff to spawn but they just kept doing the one-shot kill everything they can and ignoring the point of trying to make noise. I kept stopping to protect the juke box and get the odd hit in. Then I discovered they started barricading the doors with empty power armour frames and just ran around outside to kill things. There was no way I was going to be able to tag anything or finish it on my own so I just left and let it fail...so tired of players who just turn up to grab XP or the odd legendary instead of actually trying to finish the event.
---
Just ignore the daily grinding and do other stuff. Tame an animal, change things up at your camp, start a new game, collect plans and recipes, join a trading community and get some fresh gear, do the Ally quests if you haven't already, etc. A lot of locations were redesigned for Wastelanders update, so you could just do some exploring, as well. There's plenty of stuff to do while ignoring the grinds.
---
If I want to make a floating camp, LET ME MAKE A FLOATING CAMP. I can't see how this is hurting anything.
---
Never mind i found it, know what i got
---
A freaking ghoul slayers golf club excellent
---
Jokes cannot write themselves.  Therefore jokes cannot LITERALLY write themselves.  Don't use words you don't know the meaning of.
---
I mean to be fair NV was the worst game upon release and honestly to me is far from the best games just as if not buggier than 76 lol, but I would think they would ship it over to the team making eso or something and have them work on it. Or just revamp the dev team and add more funds to it, I’m sure the whole covid shit as messed up a lot of devs / revenue. But this game is far from done
---
Donate them to Ward, you don't get caps but you get slightly more rep increase.
---
Meh, I have different characters with different builds, one of them is a bloodied build (though using a Mutants Handmade - since I don’t have a bloodied rifle yet), it’s enjoyable.  There is a sense of power in being that glass cannon one shot killing everything. 
---
then I switch over to my High CHA team medic build with a shotgun, join a team and share rank 5 cards and enjoy a different play style.
---
Well I'm not, not that I think there is really anything that wrong with it - other than when they crash servers - given they fight Beth's timegating. I got two accounts a long time ago to have a team. I have 2 computers. One is a level 400+ the other level 190. They are always on a team so i can share cards and use herd mentality, along with the obvious advantages of having two toons at an event.
---
“Bosses”
---
I was thinking about it, it's the only trophy I need but then I couldn't be bothered doing all that over again
---
Which is why most of us haven't done it.
---
Nah you came at me and the others that felt the same way as I do......So maybe on top of being insignificant you should reassess the actions you take.......Have a great life you little insect
---
I think if u remove the card or all payment methods on it ps4 it should stop buying it
---
guess you missed the colossus event stream. with giveaways.
---
Morgantown High School gym, a stand at the Tyler Fairgrounds, Hemlock Holes shop
---
thanks for your reply, I knew there were some plans involved, it was just underwhelming to make the effort and then 'this' is what is rewarded
---
They could move it over to ZOS and have some of the team follow.
---
I uninstalled the first time I took a break and found this out the hard way.
---
That makes sense. Thanks.
---
Who wants to work on a game for 40+ hours a week and then sit down at home and play that game? Even when I was heavily making mods for other games, I’d get burnt out in playing the game/working on the mod and I wasn’t doing it as a full time job.
---
I had similar experiences when I started. I've got 2 friends I normally game with but neither of them care for fallout or multiplayer games with pvp (the pvp part I agree with, but I've played Bethesda games for over 20 years). I started when 76 went to Game Pass. I play on PC and jumped in knowing no one. Within an hour or so I had a full set of level 5 shadow/deep pocket leather armor and a marksman rifle with a recon scope, as well as a plethora of stimpacks and radaway. Great start to a game I had a lot of trepidation starting.
---
Now I just need to find a way to revive someone for the tadpole quest to get the large backpack.
---
Cultured! I run 13 CHR, Empath, Herd Ment. All for the Team

---
Yep. Imposter Sheepsquatch and the SBQ. Are you trying to be clever or something?
---
if I spend more than 1000 rounds combined (.308+5mm)  it's a bad fight.  I prefer to stay in the 500-700 rds range.  But you take what you get right?  some fights are more and some fights are a **lot** less (haha *you know the ones) .*  It's almost always a good time though.
---
Not everyone is bothered with leveling...
---
Np
---
You have to kiss Todd's toes
---
I agree. Frankly almost every game is fun to play with friends. Unfortunatly my friends hate F76 and they staying away from it even though they love Fallout franchise and played the shit out of previous games.
---
I now understand.
---
I started yesterday and played around 4 hours and already at the Top of the World. You do need to be at least level 20 and got the inoculation to start Wastelanders
---
Who cares?
---
same here.....  or they're a mule and will swap to their character who has killer weapons and a pvp build
---
I'm on pc I got some low level bloody items I been wanting to get rid of...my username is the same if you need some stuff you can just add me to team up I honestly had planned on quitting but I'm just to bored without fo76 and it's the only game that keeps my heart rate low enough to where I dont gotta smoke every 15 minutes.
---
Because that's one of the ways to force a player to rollback its status to the last save, which opens the door to duping
---
I think you misunderstand. Say I’m standing 100 meters behind you. I equip the missile launcher and sprint towards you. Every 4-5 seconds I will rubber band to a position about 10 meters backwards.
---
That’s what I figured they would do, since it seems like the team working on 76 is having a rough time either being over worked or having a bad manager, I would say move it over do a like ESO/76 themed event to start it off and bam games redone and set for years.
---
i personally thought it was funny she never looted the boss. she just ran out after basically leeching the event.
---
Okay, maybe I just haven't seen a recon scope yet.  But otherwise, you no longer see enemies on the compass until they're visible, or you're really close?
---
Plus if you kill 76 you get 80 atoms. It's just business,
---
Not really bosses, more like mini bosses, I’d love there to be an event where you follow a trail of  some caps covered in blood, all leading to a moonshine on a pedistal, you and up to 7 others can drink from this, all pass out and end up in an areana, with an actual boss, not just tougher enemies
---
One mans waste is another mans treasure.
---
I do this more to get stash space then for being nice tbh lol
---
No problem, I use this primarily for screws, springs, gears, acid, lead, ballistic fibre and legendaries.
---
Likely just swapping perks, although a total respec would be nice I doubt it with Bethesda.
---
Although I want to agree with you this bug has been pretty much non existent for a while and this last patch brought it back for me also with a sneaky sniper build.  Maybe it has to do with all the lag people are reporting lately show its just showing up much more pronounced but before this patch I rarely had the issue and now it's constant.

Yup, public teams has actually had me bring him out of retirement, I wasn’t really using him that often but now I can join event teams and tag along and help out. Some people think it’s weird, others actively enjoy my constant healing.
---
Bethesda claimed to have a  commitment to their Legends card game, too. Even a road map for a year. 
---
That was right before they killed it.
---
Never trust Bethesda.
---
Naw. I don't play bloodied, but it was a really well designed build, like amazing when you think of it. Someone planned it out very well. Instead of wanting bloody changed we need to push for more builds with that much detail. Junkies needs a complementary armor set,junky perks for both in and out of power armor, that type of thing. Then the same thing done for three or more play styles. Do not nerf bloody, let it be the rising tide uplifting other builds.
---
How the burrows turned out? Was it advertised to be something it's not?
---
You're not raising a flag,  you said it yourself, you're having a rant and you specifically stated you wanted to avoid people who don't enjoy rants from opening the post...a mindset that means you only want people who "like" rants and therefore may agree with you, to open it and join in. If you were truly raising a flag, you would be specific about the problems, rather than "I don't like that I feel like I have to play every day for the same results as everyone else" and "everyone knows there's a huge list of problems". 
---
You don't need to like my position, I don't expect you to or honestly care if you do. My thoughts and comments are specific to your post. I'm not here to change your mind, I'm just calling you on your statement which is claiming a multitude of inaccuracies,
---
With regards to the devs, if you read my comments, at no point have I said you need to agree with me, or them. I've simply pointed out you have no right to demand they change their game to suit *you* personally. 
---
Have a pleasant evening. I'm going to finish up work and go run a few dailies before playing some RDO and the Avengers Beta. 
---
Toodles.
---
Hey... don't be a dick.
---
lol well played. Ye dont expect friends when holding workshops.
---
Nice, we can all be pedantic too. In terms of actual enemies we fight these are bosses for all intents and purposes but I guess it can be debated based on how each individual person sees them.
---
Any PS4 players can hit me up and I'll help anyway I can.  Most of my friends list now are people I have helped out or help others and I hope to see that list grow. To those who have helped me out with all 3 of my characters, thank you. 
---
xSnuffyx . . . My PS4 ID
---
👍💗😀
---
Superb. Thanks!
---
You’re welcome.
---
Ahhh. Bloodied PA HG is what I was thinking. It wrecks and is super tough. I did regular heavy before and it was fine but doesn't compare to any bloodied variety.
---
I just missed that it was a full health build!
---
Awww, welcome to Appalachia!  The community is unlike any other.  💜
---
Yes! Just deposit unwanted ammo and hit convert! 
---
Why
---
I suggest doing a few runs on westek and scrap everything with scrapper perk on Int
---
That girl you turn pictures into at Crater, she's the worst. I want to punch her every time she speaks from all the times I've tried to talk to her and have to exit out and try again. Other people do it too, but after a couple tries it's fine. With her I have to actually go find someone else to talk to, and then talk to her again
---
10mm is plentiful. you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who would buy that.  I've found stacks of thousands in drop bags next to missiles, mini-nukes and .38 rounds. pivot that junk into your ammo converter and spend half an hour cranking out a couple rounds of .308, .45 or 5.56.
---
And I’m not saying that isn’t something that won’t happen and that you weren’t promised it. I just think that’s a bad precedent for building. Of all the mechanics in this game, building has gotten dozens of cosmetics and 0 attention to improving it. Giving FO1st expanded build limit 2 years later when they still haven’t made any improvements to building is just a slap in the face
---
I think we’re at a point where we just need to scrap what was expected from Bethesda initially. It was a lot of good intentions wrapped in ignorance of what was actually possible. Bethesda needs to clearly state what they will do for FO1st over this year and be held to it, but I don’t think build limit should be on there.
---
Just my opinion, but I think this is Bethesda's way of trying to do something about Magic Weapons. A very low frame rate or high lag will prevent them from working. But it kills the game!
---
Clearly.
---
Have you seen anyone do it yet?  I haven't.  💔
---
This, I've done it twice because playing the same build gets boring. Making a third character though would be horrible since I don't want to go through the grind for the backpack and Setters and Raiders rep and gold again.
---
I hope those players aren't involved in quality testing the game in anyway, they don't look like they play very much.
---

---
Full Schedule
---
Man I should do that too
---
I jump from 7 to 9. There seem to be diminishing returns. 19 wearing nothing, 9 without full set OR backpack, 7 with full set AND backpack.
---
I can’t believe that the camp showcase is at midnight on a Friday night.  Sure, everyone is staying home cause of Covid, but I’m not planning on being in any condition where I can watch it at midnight.
---
JuSt FiX tHe BuGs BeThEsDa!
---
How can you even pretend that Bloodied is a high risk build?
---
Stuff like Nerd Rage and Dodgy make incoming damage a joke. And besides, damage isn't a concern if you one shot everything that doesn't have SBQ levels of health.
---
It's broken. It's not a "Glass" Cannon. It's just a Cannon.
---
Why shouldn't you say something nice, she is pretty. As a girl I'd rather that than someone be a dick.
---
Yeah I guess, just never really enjoyed them bossfights, but to each their own, and I was only thinking of something cool, make endgame a bit more fun
---
To improve the update, the update has made some people unhappy and they have some great reasons and it stort of revolves around showing distaste for the updates issues on the sub.
---
Yes, this is the best method. Did you know you can do this with wall conduit as well? 
---
Instead of a rug you use the metal signs (No smoking works best). Same process: place sign, put conduit on sign. Attach wire to conduit. move the sign (with conduit) over a bit. Then pick up sign again and drag the whole thing anywhere you want!
---
Im usually one to help a new player when i can and not engaged. I played when the game first launched, and know how brutal it can be.
---
I was skeptical back then even when i started because i thought, this being a multiplayer, it would be throngs of griefers and other turds, like GTAO and other games.
---
Im always there to try and give up provisions here and there, or even anti-grief in game. We are, majority wise, a healthy community. Welcome, and enjoy the (bugged) adventure
---
I've found if you go talk to someone else it works. At least for me. It can just be a random NPC too
---
Another question, are you maxed out for shotguns? Full perks? Skeetshooter? Enforcer? Because if you have a Troubleshooters explosive shotgun, those things should go down a lot faster
---
Sell scrip is what it is, you wont find any god rolls like that but maybe a decent or ok starter or backup or wte.
---
I’ve had so many nuking along the savage divide. I keep getting excited for SBQ just to see atlas or even farther up near the munitions factory is getting nukes.
---
I never understood this, if this is their full time job how much time do you really want them to be playing the game in their off time?  Even when you’re playing to test the game it’s not for fun, it’s not relaxing going through test scripts trying to find the bugs.  Why would you want to go home after doing all that, boot up your system and go right back into the game.  I’d want to go home, eat dinner, have a beer, and assuming I even wanted to touch a video game at that point, play something completely different.
---
Yeah look, apologies if it seemed if I was coming across as rude that's just how I was judging your intent.
---
It would be cool to make endgame fun, but don't hold your breath. Guess we can see the Colossus will play when it drops.
---
And for what it's worth, I liked your idea. Sounds like it could be good given the right atmosphere ect
---
I agree fully, but my issue stems from the fact that while I wanna share my excitement I also want bethesda to really see whats been going on, I wanna help the people talking about the issues too.
---
Your words help a lot though, thank you!
---
Yeah 3k nocturnal faster firerate harpoon lol gtfo
---
The only thing that could have made this better is if you dropped some salt before they killed you and then you messaged them and said.  "No junk?  Man you must be salty" and then blocked them.
---
Lol look at his name...
---
Ive only had one person who said "Can you please stop stabbing me with stims." Not against the healing. Against the idea of their character constantly being stabbed 🤣
---
Yeah, it is unclear. I missed the beginning where they probably told the viewers who was playing exactly...
---
It’s for crafting some late game items.
---
I agree!! I had the same experience, at least on PC! I haven’t had the same experience on PS4, sadly. Wait for Fasnacht Festival!!
---
I love how everyone gets together and helps newbies with legendaries or flux or ammo. Frequently, rando high level players will kite legendaries so I can get a couple of pot shots on them before they one shot the mob.
---
I love paying it forward. My C.A.M.P. always has cheap plans and trash ammo for me. I have bulked materials for cheap too. Anything to help!!
---
It's used for crafting prime weapon receivers and for crafting ammo for those weapons once a price receiver has been added. It's also used in crafting some power armor mods, and even some camp items like the rad shower.
---
I love helping out other players! My level isn't the highest, but I'll always try and throw some help/materials to someone just starting out/lower then me. When I first started there were plenty of "veterans" who did the same.
---
Ultracite ammo for primed guns for the most part. I sell a lot of serums so I use a lot there also.
---
Anyone with any answer other than this (unless melee) is a mooch. Y’all deserve your nocturnal rolling pins!
---
Its used for more than just underarmor. Its used for multiple things but the most important is mutation serums and ultracite ammo.
---
Don’t worry, no hostility felt on this end, and what’s colossus, got bored a month ago, got to lvl 50 and felt like I hit a wall
---
All of them....
---
I hear ya! The folks on the East Coast are kind of screwed on that. Not sure what happened there with the schedule...
---
And the only boss I’ll except will be covered in pink paste
---
I think there is a video of this happening to angry turtle when we using a grenade launcher.
---
It's like when you enter the Whitesprings and get teleported back whole already running.
---
Light footed perk
---
Holy crap, thank you so much for this. I didn’t know you could do that!
---
Some delightful weirdo chased me around with a power drill for about 10 minutes the other day.  I was at the airport and he just kept “buzzing” around me with that thing while I cleared out the ghoul waves.
---
I found it surprisingly funny and not annoying at all.  I just giggled.
---
I miss you.
---
They patched that out with update 20. If you go into pvp it is only with the player you hit. Their team does not agro to you anymore
---
Seriously, thank you. I’m sorry they screwed up PvP for the players that enjoyed it, and instead of fixing it just abandoned the survival beta entirely. But I’m also glad that you saw it wasn’t for you and you chose to play something else instead of take your frustrations out on players in this game. I’m also sorry that you’re out the money spent on this game and it turned out not to be the game you were expecting.
---
All this as well as trade. Get enough flux and you can use it to trade for some pretty good stuff
---
It's used for making Ultracite ammo, jetpacks, some PA mods, decontamination showers, and probably other things that I'm forgetting.
---
I can \*try\* to watch it, but I’m not sure I’ll remember any of it.
---
If you go to Wixon Homestead, there's a cat living there.
---
I’d say the forest. Shit will be destroyed by cannibals and zombies tho.
---
Doesn’t that just prevent traps? I’m talking about players who either scrap or remove floors under players that are buying things or something. Usually happens in the Savage divide as a way to kill them and take other players shit.
---
First off my dude I said much riskier, not high risk. This is Fallout 76, this is not a difficult game, there's very little I'd call "high risk\*." 
---
I die sometimes at low health. I pretty much never died at full health, once past level 45 or so. Much riskier LOL.
---
\*I will throw out that I've only fought the colossus a few times, always at low health, and got waxed pretty bad before we killed it. I also do not do Encryptid at low health, I erase my rads for that one.
---
Let me know if you want to drop some nukes somtime! I'm on PS4.
---
The only way I've seen this done is with a third person. You need to have the third person become a team leader, invite both of you to the team, and then you'll be able to see them on the team list. From there you should be able to unblock/add your friend.
---
They clearly don’t play much.  What dev is going to suffer through the same BS we do!
---
I maintain that the Furious Rolling Pin as reward was better but this is definitely a close second.
---
I will it has everything I need and a scrap pile right next to it
---
Omfg you’re right. I just lifted my red rocket garage up from the ground and I can see that the camp device is underground LOL. Why does even happen? Anyways, thank you.
---
My favorite part was seeing her get a legendary rolling pin as the big reward.
---
I’ll give it a try, but not sure how much I will want to burn up ammo to repeat it often. And it seemed like a lot of waiting around to get started. Wait for the nuke, fast travel to event, wait to get into mine ... dunno. I’m less bummed it got delayed, because my overall impression from the stream is meh.
---
Not all of us are lemmings. Junkie Gunslinger here with Metal Armor. Went as far as making my cowboy a raging alcoholic.
---
Which is another kind of broken, so.... yup
---
Trade for them. Fallout has a massive trading community where you can pretty much find anything, anytime. Granted, it's been tainted by dupers, but honest people still exist, and even if you get a duped weapon, you worked for the items you traded. The conventional methods will wither you down to nothing.
---
He is not wrong tho, bos just scamming us with junk event 🙄
---
Ahh I'm sorry to hear that, that's really unfortunate that other players have fun ruining the game for people. If you ever get a chance to play on PC, like I mentioned, I've been playing since Wastelanders and I have run into one bad apple out of hundreds of apples.
---
I don't get why it's already not a thing. 
---
You can't move certain camp items if an NPC is interacting with them, like the collectron station.....
---
Not just nuke zones, almost all towns and cities (my god Watoga gives me Boston flashbacks) and the mire, It's just like Far Harbor but with tall grass for even less fps.
---
And any rain or fog makes even the empty plains of the cranberry bog a pain to play.
---
I would suggest starting with cleaning up your build.  Here is the stealth/rifle build I used.
---
Sneak will improve your damage.  Unfortunately finding a good rile is all RNG.  I just hunted my first one down in player vending machines.  Instigating with sneak and you will one shot most non boss monsters.
---

---
Well, in a few weeks we get a \*slightly\* delayed new "boss" miniboss" event however you wanna look at it.
---
'A colossal problem' is the name of the event. Without spoiling too much, it seems you have to nuke Manongah (spelling idk lol) mine and dive into it. You'll encounter a bunch of wendigos and eventually come up against a giant wendigo "boss" and similar to the SBQ this boss will have it's own attacks and will also spawn hordes of wendigos
---
Ik my explanation doesn't do it justice, but I think you can actually see it on youtube from the PTS.
---
There's a small backstory which is always cool
---
Main reason is late game use. Biggest cap sink to avoid the absolutely ridiculous cap limit is to buy things to spend what you have that allow you to make a more passive and manageable income over time rather than 30k stuck in your inventory. 
---
Best way is buying the serum recipes from whitespring bunker. They all take flux to craft. Also ammo production-if you prime guns it allows you to craft larger amounts for less resources at the expense of having to use fluxes. 
---
You also have Decon shower and under armours as well as their value for trade or sale on their own merit, as a lot of people can’t/don’t want to farm them en masse.
---
You can get by perfectly well without them, but considering there’s no real end game for someone with hundreds of hours in the game, it’s a substitute for that along with a myriad other endeavours to make busy work in lieu of actual activities.
---

Or the "you have been insulted" note somehow lol
---
We have hit the mark already. No further need to donate. But also I don't think bulk works
---
Comments like these are not needed. Please go back to Fartnite with the rest of the kids,thanks.
---
It's just something you eventually learn happens often. This is why I will risk dying to mob scrambling to spam the loot button before legendary falls through map.
---
I will use like 50-100 5mm from my gat gun until she mutates, by then everyone probably tagged her and when she lands after that just light her up with 75 magical .308
---
Oh really? That's good to know. Thank you.
---
&gt;using an improper weapon for the event
---
Why was it an improper weapon for that event?  Why would they make an event where an entire build is handicapped because of their main weapon?
---
Amen to that.
---
&gt; This is my build
---
you should run maxed blocker.. ignoring 45% of incoming damage is huge in this game..
---
&gt; How do I get a decent end game weapon?
---
ultimately.. buying something off a player vendor will be much easier than waiting for RNG to bless you.. although technically speaking not impossible
---
Enclave bunker.
---
Problem is 1hand ”good roll” isnt a big seller. I used vamp swingspeed knife because it was op for lazy farming. I had to sell the build to sell the weapon for a decent amount because ppl dont see the correct use for specific items.
---
Awesome, might come back and give it a check
---
not as easy? Running with a several thousand damage output and being damn near unkillable in pvp? Having your teammate goat someone into a reasonable fight while you pump out a bloodied gamma gun from the bushes? OK rere
---
I’ve been having severe lag at some camps I go to but everything else has been normal for me
---
I like using vampire weapons. I use them with low hp builds as well as max hp builds. Obviously more effective with lower hp since you get the damage boosts and also keep yourself alive. Win win.   
---
I started using the Gauss Shotgun a few weeks ago and that thing wrecks anything that isn't a scorchbeast/queen. High or low hp, my "Angry Vampire Boi" gauss shotgun don't care.  
---
I'm currently looking for a vampire/reload/90% flamer though. If any1 has one in their vendor on PC, pm me. Can even be a 1star vampire, i don't care. xP
---

Oh you sure got me. Judging my whole life based on how I play a game. Are you a psychologist or something?? Your insults get stupider and stupider by the second. Have a good day sensitive man
---
He blocked me😂 afraid of confrontation just like he is in a game
---
What kind Nukashine fueled Friday nights are you having??!?! ;-)
---
I don't know if you'e being sarcastic so i shall just assume you're not
---
Friendly fire is a perk in charisma that allows you to heal other players and NPS with fire. But not molotovs cos that would be too easy. If you use a flamer you apparently have to bash them. I, and most other people, use a shishkebab. It's light so perfect for just keeping in your inventory. Even rank one is enough to heal NPC's. I have 2 ranks in FF but i might put it to 3.
---
You can heal the cows during free range and the friendly animals in project paradise. Any NPC in an event you have to protect basically.
---
If you're on xbone i will give you a free shishkebab
---
Oof, big mistake. Its been a kniwn issue since the release of the run. As everyone else is saying, remove the skin and replace the camp, that should fix it.
---
Go meet him on someones privat surfer who doesnt block him.
---
Then under resent in social menu u should be able to unblock him.
---
Cough  bombs fell in 2077   cough
---
Honest response, nice to see. Not to sound old here but I miss survival mode, we could purposely go beat each other up and have fun then switch over to adventure when we got tired of that and just wanted to farm or build or whatever. A good mix of both.
---
I do sorta miss the days when you could just walk up to someone's house, smash it to bits, and then spend an hour or two playing hide and seek with the server as they hunted you down for your bounty. I get why they removed those aspects though, it was clear early on that the majority of the playerbase had no interest in PvP like you said. These newbies have no idea what a wild west this game was in those glorious early days...
---
that honestly is one of my favorite things about this community. i’ve only ever run into a few people that were rude or toxic.
---
Same thing happens with harpoon gun I use.
---
Then, as you said, you need to keep increasing Perception. If you like rifles it will also help with your build. Also let me pass another tip: when you are out exploring, keep tapping the vats key, it will help you find enemies far away before they show up on the compass.
---
Good bye you pathetic little worm of a person......Go take care of all that butthurt you are dealing with
---
And what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt.
---
What are you falling onto? 
---
Anyway I don’t like the idea of someone bring able to prevent me working on my camp because they are in my way. Simplest solution is not to carry junk on you.
---
A melee weapon from what I saw there is kind of limited in that type of event, just like in the SBQ fight, where you have to wait for the Queen to land before you do damage. It was great for keeping the smaller when it goes off the people who were attacking the Colossus, but since we could only see her point of view I found it frustrating because I want to see more of the Colossus.
---
The safest way to handle that event is to bash the legendaries with your gun once or twice and then do the follow me emote and get the heck out of the way. I have been very lucky to be involved in several events where this occurred, and it's equal parts hilarious to watch and wholesome as hell. There's nothing funnier than a group of dwellers surrounding some poor confused mole miner just bashing away with perfectly functional guns but refusing to actually shoot him. That event went from one I avoid to one I enjoy, thanks to this. Now, tho, I've probably jinxed myself and my next round will be with a bunch of selfish one-shotters. I'm sorry it happened to you, though. I hope you have pacifist on, at least, so they didn't actually damage you!
---
Where can i get the hat?
---
To my death off a cliff
---
LOL, close too it.  With COVID and the stay at home stuff, my friends and I get on discord and play games together. Since we don’t have to drive, sometimes (most times) we get to have a bit more than before.  
---
And since I discovered door dash Friday nights have been fun.
---
I snorted. Take my up vote.
---
Its also the most plentiful and easiest to get.  I doubt that will happen with Cork.
---
I was overenumbered most of my play through, only recently haven't been. I never really visited my base, even now it's more a free fast travel point and not much else.
---
I don’t think so I’m sure they’re from the dev room from what I was told
---
Your reply speaks for itself. Your comment breaks at least two Reddit rules. So I stick to my original statement. Moron.
---
Some people being unhappy is a movement? Ok. Thanks.
---
That should work too.
---
Good thinking!
---
Geez, all the other players are too busy one-shotting it themselves to worry about any high-level doing it.   The players at this event are worse than ever.
---
Is there a VOD or anything? I'd like to watch it, lol
---
Good to know they in no way altered the experience.
---
I mean, you kind of combat your own point about lemmings when you immediately state that you use the SECOND most OP build in the next sentence.
---
When there are as many videos on Youtube for other builds as there are for Bloodied and Junkie's THEN you might have a point.
---
Once we hit the number the game should have kicked in the next challenge early. Why they can't work a mechanic like that is beyond me.
---
thx moite
---
LMFAO and you are a druggie......Makes perfect sense.....No wonder you have no sense of reality......Just a tweaker...... LMFAO
---
Usually long term devious plans reveal incompetence. As the plan(s) probably require some amount of competence to pull off. So, you absolutely can call long term devious plans with incompetence out the moment you see them because the ling term devious plan in itself was planned incompetently.
---
I’ve never been able to sell merch at fed76 suggested prices, even at the low end. I always have to price way under. Might just be a PS4 thing, tho.
---
Got him
---
Bulk doesn't work, must be loose. It's likely not coded to accept two different items, steel scrap and bulk steel.
---
Pretty sure it tells you that your camp is under attack. There is also a server wide notification that you are wanted.
---
OP was doubly misinformed.
---
For real! Being wanted is annoying as heck! It's only happened to me once thanks to picking a lock in a barn I didn't realize was part of an owned workshop, and I wound up heading back to my camp and waiting. Soon enough, I heard power armor footsteps coming, so I put my gun down and stood still. I think I surprised the dude when I told him thank you as I fell. He totally did me a favor.
---
Cool. Are you Xbox?
---
Yes, I caught that rolling pin! She should have showed that to us in greater detail...that's a must need item right there! 
---
I agree with you about the time investment. It's similar to the SBQ set up except now there is the added gate of the mine. This is definitely for more higher level folks overall. Giving us a new thing to do with nukes! 
---
Teams out there will probably find a way to optimize it perhaps, and remove some the tedium.
---
I can't stand bloodied builds. I much prefer my full health 2 handed melee.
---
Pretty bad when you have to talk about needing a magic shotgun to make a full health build work.
---
Son of a F nugget.  
---
How can we check that? Another one starts up soon right?
---
The only that can kill you is the mirelurk king or a mosquito lol
---
You make a really good point. It might have been better for the organizers to invite popular Fallout 76 streamers to run the Event instead. Can you imagine angry turtle doing this...lol! So much more fun.
---
You can't un-bulk junk can you. 😡
---
Do you need help with anything? I can craft and mod weapons and armour for you, and can give atom pals and radaway if you need it
---
It's good for upgrading Underarmours to Shielded Lining, crafting/modding Power Armor Limbs &amp; Torso, Ultracite Ammo, Decontamination Showers, and lastly crafting Mutation Serums.
---
I had the same issue I convinced a mate of mine to get it on gamepass so I could help him through the low levels and complete the tadpole quests, i'm on xbox so I have no clue if PC has a gamepass equivalent
---
Did I miss part of something while watching the event. When was the boss unable to be hit?
---
Same but for PS4! Message me for my PSN
---
How about being able to scrap legendary items and get modules at any work bench. Scrip is only needed as a currency to buy items at the purveyor. If I max out my scrip, at least I can scrap them for modules. To prevent inflation:
---
Weapons
---
* 25% module chance
---
** 50% module chance
---
*** 75% module chance
---
Armor
---
* 15% module chance
---
** 30% module chance
---
*** 45% module chance
---
Scrap it at any workstation.
---
Yeah, as someone who used to do Bloodied melee, your view of a Scorchbeast Queen battle is basically staring at the Queen's bum for the duration of the event.  It's not a particularly great way to show off just how crazy the action all around you really is.
---
Similarly, Devann's perspective of a Colossus is limited to staring at Earle's misshapen ankles.  It would have been nice if they could have switched the view to one of the heavy gunners.
---
NW players can still use the armor and weapon skins from the game board in NW.  So they should be able to play NW exclusively to get all of their daily challenges.
---
But with all the huge bonuses that bloodied builds get...high stats, resistances, dodge etc. etc. is it REALLY that risky? I've seen some talk about how tough they are with a bloodied build.
---
If there were so many risks to a bloody build I don't think it would be quite the meta it is now.
---
Thought I heard something about a respecing system was coming, maybe in winter or something like that
---
It does, that's what I play on, but no cross play so my console only buddies are out, unfortunately.
---
They are dev room items
---
believe me, I had my share of boards, lead pipes, rolling pins and wood armor. More that I could ever display. :D
---
Yeeeeeah this community really doesn't like when you call them out for dumping their trash on noobs and patting themselves on the back for it. Let's be honest with ourselves, that's exactly what it is. No one is giving out their prized Handmade to a fresh level 50 here.
---
I leave my trash in containers and call it a day.
---
If my math is correct, given the weekly cap-&gt;bullion exchange of 300 bullion.... if you had a weekly treasury-&gt;cap limit, it would be 200 caps per treasury bill. This equates to 6000 cap weekly limit if you exchange treasuries (assuming the exchange rate is the same). 
---
So you'd be grinding treasuries in your big session. But missing out on gold bullion. There's no treasury carry limit, which is why I used that, otherwise if you use bullion or scrip you're back to your daily/carry limits. 
---
And I don't think I would want another currency just to exchange for caps. 
---
I think the most simple solution is to just increase daily vendor limits to like 4000 or something.
---
I don’t think you can.  I dropped my mysterious pistol as well never to return..
---
Because a livestream demonstration doesn't mean it's ready to be full released?
---
To hype people?
---
They are probably playing it on the pts
---
And what you “get” is the raw flux... you have to then craft it into stable flux
---
I am not sorry for buying the game, I enjoyed it. Adults waste a lot of money on real world things, its just 60 bucks. In the end this game needs some type of competition, doesnt have to be pvp. If you dont compete with other players for anything then you might as well play FO4 or some real fleshed out single player game.
---
TY, yeah, that made my month or even more.
---
I'm ready for BOS and their castle made of cork.
---
I had always wondered this myself,as I’ve never found em,in the world,nor in any vendors,player or otherwise.
---
&gt;And what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt.
---
I had no idea. That is fantastic.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfp2O9ADwGk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfp2O9ADwGk)
---
When I see anything less than 999 in reserve, I I’ve pulled the trigger too much.
---
Alright cool
---
You need them in order to craft higher lvl ones! if you sold them... well you are out of luck! Start a new caracter?
---
I try to always put on PA when it looks like I might fall to my death if they were to log out or something similar.
---
I really think the reason they avoided an entirely new currency exchange system was how everytime they add one someone figured out how to use it to dupe item. So while they could spend time to ensure that doesnt happen with proper coding they just used a tried and true method of terminal.
---
From what I saw,--but I didn't get to watch in the greatest detail because of some necessary multitasking--the player we were watching died alot, running about, and mostly was wacking the smaller wendigo spawn. I personally did not catch sight of her getting close to the Colossus. Personally, I would not have used a melee weapon during that particular type of fight, esp if I was trying to showcase the event, but I recognize that is subjective.
---
I’m not sure but it seems that the event causes lag outside the event. so everybody else on the server not on the event would have problems.
---
You won't be able to change your Special stats.
---
That was *so* Fallout 76.
---
I really can't see this event as worth it either, unless you have seven other players who are sharing the resource burden.  Even the existing Wendigo Colossus is a massively unrewarding bullet sponge for all you get.
---
Once you get past the unique plans Earle offers, it will be interesting to see if it has any staying power like the Queen has.
---
While they definitely should have had builds specifically for this event, the reason for your last point is they were using their actual toons and trying to give as close to a realistic first attempt as possible. The girl was LadyDevann. She is more or less the Bethesda-hired face of Fallout. She’s the community manager and generally handles reddit and forum public support issues. 
---
So while it wasn’t the best selling point, I think not having her play would have been like having a Zenimax dev speaking for Todd Howard.
---
have my lol
---
it's strange to see on screen something that you've seen in your mind for so long. ngl, awesome feeling.
---
I have obtained 6 of their boxes. 2 of them had plans I didn’t already know. Not bad for turning in something as ubiquitous as steel.
---
But I’m not so keen on giving them my precious plastic.
---
Because they need more time to polish it?
---
I think it's still taking new donations as well. This is really the worst community event I've ever seen when coupled with the "colossal nonexistent problem"
---
LOL! Yep to everything you said right there!
---
Had to log out during Radiation Rumble last night when the fps dropped to about 0.5. And that's a generous estimate.
---
Honestly the community is the only reason I still play. Some high level players took care of me when I was a wee little lad and now I return the favor. It always makes me smile when I drop plans or ammo for low levels and they drop something like purified water in return
---
I say kindness is contagious, they helped you and now your helping! I love this community
---
Wasted?  You still got the ATLAS box for it.  That is the real reason most of us are turning in steel.  I would be pissesd if they made it so I couldn't donate after it was done.
---
You may can find them at player vendors if you are lucky.
---
IMHO it has been dead ever since the ban wave. idk if that means everyone was duping or everyone's is tired of it, but it has definitely thinned out the heard.
---
No, you need the original to craft an upgraded version of that weapon (you don't get another one, it just increases the level of the one you have). You can find people selling theirs every so often though.
---
Yup. I’m only there for the atom.
---
I wonder if the community has a different feel by platform. You mention players talking about their build, so I’m guessing you’re not on PC. No text chat on PC and hardly anyone has voice chat enabled and even fewer actually talk. So Xbox maybe? It would be interesting to get community sentiment expressed by platform and playtime. 
---
I play on PC. Bought in and have played a few hours per week every week since launch. I’m only like 186 now. I have had two negative encounters with other players, both were within a month of playing. Now, the worst thing I see is very infrequently someone oneshotting legendaries during events. But that too rarely happens. I regularly see folks going out of their way to let everyone involved get shots in. Reviving low levels when they’re in an event over their head. People dropping bags of useful food/chems/gear. Reasonable prices and lots of free or 1 cap things in vendors. Tons of really well built and decorated camps. It’s just a thoroughly fun experience to play with other random people. 
---
I actually pay for fallout1st too and have access to private servers, but the few times I’ve used them they felt empty and kinda dead, even after wastelanders. I get value out of the survival tent and scrap box, but I am disappointed that more of the promised features of 1st haven’t materialized yet. For me the community is a big reason I keep playing.
---
It's comparative, man. Is it risky compared to, say, the Surge, a game that kicked my ass so bad I quit on it LOL? no. No it's not risky. Is it risky compared to bouncing around at full health in power armor on Fallout 76? Yes. Yes it is. 
---
Now why don't you answer some questions for me: why do you care? What does someone else's build have to do with you? The only thing I could think of would be bloodieds maybe one-shotting legendaries during events. Which i will agree is discourteous and I go out of my way to not do it myself. But I can also assure you that selfish people will be selfish regardless of build.
---
If they just copy the perk loadout manager mod that's available on PC, that's a win for the consoles.
---
With how they do things, it'll probably be swapped at a terminal in your camp, and be utterly useless.
---
I´m having a lot of CTD, it´s almost impossible to play. I play in public servers.
---
Where are you seeing that
---
I have found fast travelling away and then back again can reset them when they bug out like that, it doesn't work everytime, but often enough to make it worth while trying.
---
&gt;I'm sure it was a gag but the other day I saw someone selling stingwing barbs and I think tick blood sacs or something like that for 30k a pop
---
The game has a nasty habit of scrapping things like that, so if you want to stockpile bug parts for that daily quest the easiest way to guarantee that they aren't scrapped is to put them in your vendor for an outrageous price.
---
I do the same thing with stuff I want to protect, but I use an unpowered vending machine in my locked bedroom so it doesn't clutter up the real vending machines.
---
That would have been awesome.  They could have even challenged them to try different builds against the event.   
---
Shoot, I’m sure the streamers would have loved to have some bonus content they could edit and show themselves. 
---
More to the original point, yes they should play their game at least \*some\* but ultimately they need to be listening to the players.  We can’t expect people to \*want\* to play the game as much as we do.  We play the game to unwind and have fun after a long day of school of whatever our jobs might be, for most of them I imagine that playing the game just reminds them of work.
---
And I’d like to believe the developers themselves are listening to the players, but they simply are being given other direction by management which is why so many issues linger.  (If you do agile, and you only get 3 hours assigned to working on a bug fix for fast travel, you only get 3 hours to work on figuring out that bug)
---
This is the main reason why duping is so prevalent in this game. The RNG is god awful. You have to trade to get anything good. That’s the best way.
---
?????? Damn, I must have been doing something wrong then for the past 150 Bloodied levels. Both in and out of power armor.
---
I hate battle royale and prefer open world pvp.  Also from what I hear about NW it is hiding in bushes that gets you ranked higher.  That just sounds boring as hell.
---
The same goes for that funky outfit that you put the jewel on. When I realized I didn't have mine anymore, I sent out some messages to random people on my server and the 3rd person I asked sold me theirs.
---
Isn't there a camo skin for the ss underarmor in the atom shop?
---
because they're testing it?
---
Their notoriously bad PR shines through by showcasing an event that has been delayed twice. 
---
Then play a trailer showing the Captain Cosmo Spacesuit multiple times even though the helmet is bugged. And flashing Legendary Perks that got pushed backed two updates. 
---
Bethesda: let’s show them everything they can’t have
---
The rewards are garbage.
---
We aren't.
---
Yeah, I wanna know where he seees that too
---
Commando.
---
As I stated earlier, it's not personal if it is being requested by others.
---
You do you, I stand my position, and I'm saying it loud and clear, I'm raising a flag
---
Please no more passive aggressive attitude
---
Like, a month ago?
---
Perk loadouts have been confirmed to be coming...eventually. it's in the roadmap
---
I think that ship sailed on Tuesday.
---
The event tracker on their official site. It shows the real number for a split second before the bar goes past the 125m mark.
---
I guess that’s a strong vote of confidence that the bloodied build is here to stay.
---
Welcome to the community.  I'm so glad you have had a great experience.  I have to agree with you, this is an amazingly supportive community that likes to look after its members.  More than that; take pride being a positive force for new players.
---
There's been lots of anger and vitriol over the recent update and then here you come in with a freaking love bomb.  I needed that.  I think a lot of us needed that.
---
Cheers.
---
Join the cult of the mothman, we know how to party and we have a punch bowl full of “koolaid”.
---
If I’m running 18% (I usually run at 4% for maximum damage), and I’ve only got say, 58 HP, I’ll get 2 tapped by most if not all high level mobs. And I’ll also get my ass fried by anything that does poison damage. It’s even worse for me, because my HP is always 12 or lower.
---
YEESSSSSSSS
---
OP owes us the backstory.
---
Funny you say that because ain’t that Bethesda’s logic? Game is buggy as f*ck but let’s just smile and wave and act like everything’s fine.
---
Another good idea that can be used to extend the game mechanics. If I have time to farm legandaries, I should also be able to scrip them in one or another way. It's just sad if I have to drop them and I have to do this way to often :D
---
It was something they were working on with the roadmap, not sure where it stands now but it (along with instances Camps) are supposedly on the horizon.

Plot Twist:  This whole thing was just to reduce duper inventories.
---
It's been previewed on the PTS for weeks so what's the problem streaming the exact same publicly? From what I understand the delay is to resolve external issues caused by the event and not the event itself. If you notice there were no other players on the server to be affected by lag or other problems, it could be very different if another dozen were sat externally playing their own games.
---
that'll be the number one downloaded mod when it comes..
---
I feel like we’ve seen it talked about before. I’m pretty sure you just go to your loadout tab and can scroll between multiple pre-built decks, like some of the current mods
---
If you're looking for an alternative build, I can personally tell you that a Heavy Weapons / PA tank build armed with Instigating Plasma Caster / Furious Gauss Minigun is not only viable but extremely powerful. I can obliterate 95% of the mobs in this game in one hit and have not died to anything in OVER A YEAR. So yeah, the bloodied lemmings have their place but you don't necessarily have to follow them just to be viable.
---
It's just a fact that many people in this game see maxing out their damage as their personal endgame. I can definitely respect that!
---
Cant turn in steel anymore.
---
Not really. Most walk around the wasteland with Junkie and 25% health. Not to mention unyielding and a silenced weapon. I have metal Bolstering, Western Revolver and no shits to give about being sneaky. Way more fun in my opinion.
---
Do you have a vendor that’s powered on with stuff in it? If not, people won’t see your camp on the map. Then the only way they’ll see it is if you set down in a high traffic location. 
---
If you have a camp somewhere in the middle of nowhere with no vendor you just aren’t likely to get visitors.
---
Respect, well said, i can relate because I've been working in the software industry for more than 10 years now
---
That exactly
---
I have epilepsy in real life and sometimes it gets so glitchy it legit feels like a seizure (just in case you were wondering what an epileptic seizure feels like) I never had much problems with the game, I hardly have the fast travel bug but since the update it gets really bad when there are events
---
I don't bother trying to sell any of the crap from the holiday gifts. The only plans I sell are the various camp plans and recipes that you get from workshop events, and they're all priced at 15 caps each.
---
Expecting someone to sell legit rare plans for that price is dumb. I've probably dug up 1k treasure maps and I'm still missing the t60 helmet. Considering how much time and caps it takes to acquire all those maps there's no effing way I would sell a spare t60 plan that cheap.
---
It really did strike me as something where team coordination would help it run better. Need some heavy hitters on Earle, and some people scraping off the smaller wendigos to keep the whole team from being overwhelmed. But that requires a more altruistic play style than I’ve witnessed in most events so far. We’ll see how it goes in real life.
---
Thanks dude, you and others like you will be the reason we meet the target
---
yes, i prefer to tryhard one day and relax the other ones chillin
---
Okay I buy the "realistic first attempt" argument. Most of my point were gut fueled first reactions, in my defense, and so not well thought-out critiques. But as a female gamer I did not enjoy watching her die over and over again. Not the best role model there.
---
I guess I'll take your word for that.
---
Well at least that's a thing. A bit too late though, pretty sure if given the choice - those people who donated extra would probably wanna keep that steel..
---
i don‘t expect anyone to sell those plans for that cheap, i have a ton spare and i’m selling them for 10k each: i‘m just saying that people shouldn‘t pretend they‘re wasteland heroes by selling their shitty plans that no one wants for 20 caps. ^^
---
They patched this out, but I miss doing this to people.
---
This is why I don't understand why people complain about the devs not playing the game themselves. I'd never want to go play a game I just spent all day working on. That's why they have play tests, so people that actually want to play can
---
Hopefully they'll have recorded each players view and edit it together into something cohesive. Trying to have one player go at it with a super sledge while trying to show whats going obviously did not work well. They really should have someone invisible and invulnerable wandering around the fight, that would have been a better way.
---
Ok, wow! I just started playing a few days ago myself and have had the same experience so far! I had been thinking of making the same post because I am just so astonished by these people! Some guy is at the front of the vault waiting, shows me around, shows me where some good loot is...then yesterday some guy was following me around with the drone and helicopters and saved me from some rad scorps and at first I was like wtf is going on right now... Like I said, just started a few days ago, so it took me a sec to realise there is probably a player flying that drone. He follows me to the next place I go and helped me out there too. Just....man....that is so awesome!!! Most of my online experience has been gta so I really was not expecting this welcoming community!!
---
I'll host the image &amp; post it, gimme a min.
---
You still get your "rewards" for turning materials in. so where is the WASTE!?
---
Try completely closing your game and turning it back on, happened to me, you’ll have to go though opening the vault door again and the dialogue but everything is normal
---
I run a shotgun build that can pretty much kill everything, Scorchbeasts included, in like 1-3 shots.
---
I was experiencing this bug for a while before the patch, so I'm pretty sure it wasn't fully fixed beforehand. However, if I switched to a different weapon and/or adopted a different strategy, the issue was almost nonexistent, so maybe it affects certain builds more than others. It would also not surprise me if the latest patch made this problem worse, and it is now affecting a larger portion of the playerbase than it was before.
---
For now, until it gets fixed, switching to melee for problematic enemies always seemed to work. I know that's not ideal in the middle of a firefight, but it beats basically healing them with the bullets that you fire.
---
Edit: I'm also on PC, by the way.
---
I did that exactly but still had the same issue I'm just going to uninstall it and reinstall it and see what happens

In the early days of 76 sentinel effect was flat 15% this mans had a full set of sentass marine he got off ebay (i found this out later) and he was trash talking me in game and apparently i shot first, i thought he did but anyways he literally was invincible (this was before survival mode and thus before i knew about the workarounds to fight sentass. But yeah it was an hour of me calling him a hacker and an hour of him trash talking and railing my caps (you lost equiv caps to level l, i was 100ish at the time). We were both at fault. I was being a naive little bitch thinking everything was a hack. He was just a douchenozzle.
---
I was running junkies for a while, but I also never cared to get rid of my radiation. I wasn't dying, so I didn't really care that much. I decided to switch to bloodied for that reason alone, and holy shit it's insane.
---
I’m not at that level yet lol. Most expensive weapons I’ve sold were at 1500.
---
I did sell marsupial serum for 250 yesterday to a low level player
---
I have a vendor. I'm always selling some one or two star legendary items. But I am in a area that's secluded and far away from anyone that's probably the issue.
---
Don’t donate it. People need to boycott this event to tell them watered down reskinned Christmas presents are not acceptable rewards.
---
I'm a Full Health Heavy PA Build, so I'm already good my dude.
---
Instigating on a Plasma Caster is interesting. Does that actually perform well?
---
I run a Vampire's Gauss Minigun. I prefer near invulnerability vs insta-melting Mobs. Maybe I'll give a few more rolls for a new one.
---
Damn whose the crazy downvoter in here? It’s just a simple question. No reason to get angry at everyone.
---
wanted to bring some positivity, much needed in this post patch-21 world...
---
That’s a shame. I have no desire to run a Junkie or Bloodied build. 
---
I’ll just keep doing mediocre damage, I guess.
---
If you are playing on xbox one come to my camp, it's very newbie friendly and has lots of cheap plans and free stuff for you to loot. Gamertag is deliciou5.
---
All of the new bullion weapons and armor as well as the vault 94 armor require modules. You buy the modules and then craft something (like a secret service limb) and it contained the module along with all the other materials it would cost to craft a piece of armor. In exchange you get a random 1-3 star legendary piece.
---
It's slightly less random than buying crap from mumbles because you can at least pick the specific piece you get, but it can be incredibly frustrating to spend 50 scrip on a module and end up with a 1 star nocturnal chest piece.
---
dying has no penalty, junk? lol you can have my empire of junk if you want who cares but if you are on a event you don't drop things.
---
back again, my point was nobody cares about dying, you comeback shot once and did 3k dmg, 50 times more than the full health running around. Repeat.
---
I need this in .gif form
---
How is it any different from needing Unyielding armor, or a Bloodied weapon? All I need is an armor piece with the right effect to work with any shotgun, or the right shotgun and any armor I want. 
---
It's absolutely not necessary, you can do other weapons if you like heavy guns, or if you don't mind using more than one piece of ammo per enemy. Is Bloodied the "best" build? Sure, but it doesn't mean other builds aren't viable.
---
I have seen guys being screamed at for saying a girl was pretty. So...
---
You won’t be at 95% damage resistance. They won’t add 50 and 45.
---
That’s right other locations are
---
Pylon ambush site - Ash heap*
---
Whitespring golf club - Savage divide
---
US-13C Bivouac - Savage divide
---
Along the road south of Abbie’s bunker - The mire(near a truck suspended in trees)
---
Haven church - The mire*
---
Hawke’s refuge - The mire*
---
Southern belle motel - The mire(in trees behind the motel)
---
KMAX transmission - The mire*
---
Drop site G3 - Cranberry bog*
---
Appalachian antiques - Cranberry bog
---
I believe in each location it can be a wendigo, glowing one, or crowned ghoul if it spawns ghoul type enemies
---
locations with a * are what I’ve found to be the best, small areas that you spawn near when server hopping with fairly consistent spawns
---
I'd say the camouflage secret service underarmor that there's right now in the Atomic Shop is the closest thing to what you are looking for, but I don't recommend buying it. It shows you can apply secret service mods (even that in the buying page says it uses casual mods), but when you try to mod it nothing happens and mods don't apply.
---
There was also a [camo tactical ops underarmor](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/0/07/Atx_apparel_underarmor_tacticalops_camo_c1.png/revision/latest?cb=20200526175649), but again, was an atomic shop item and left the shop a long time ago.
---
Unless I’m mistaken the launcher won’t launch unless it’s updated and u need that to access the load screen to get the atom store. Only suggestion I can make is if u have a friend who would kindly let u log into their system and add the items to your account.
---
Jokes on you,if your camp sucks I won't even give you those 3 caps for the challenge, and kill your brahmin
---
Oh, shut up.
---
Oh shoot, that makes sense why I do 55 damage to a scorchbeast even though the weapon’s base damage is 77
---
I’m not saying you’re a duper.
---
Man that's harsh.
---
That’s the difference between someone collecting a pay check and someone who has passion for their job.
---
So much This. I have 5 chars. Main hvy bloodied. Full heaths- sneak rifleman, junkies shotties, unarmed. I gave up and took my gunslinger bloodied, just so she could still perform in the end game. Would love to see more useful variety in builds. Berserker should do almost as much damage as bloodied, . Vanguard weapons. Mutant percentage per mutation up to 5 like junkies, but a little less damage. Racial bonuses on weapons should get a nice boost as incentive to build an armory. Each one should have some perk bonuses.
---
I setup by watoga train station. I get lots of folks wandering through on the way to or back from a SBQ fight. It’s not the prettiest area but I get a ton of visitors.
---
It's not so much playing the game in their off-time as much as simply being familiar with the game they are making.  They should be well-versed in the gameplay and systems, as well as common problems and concerns.
---
I'm not really suggesting that any of the above weren't in this specific event, but this is an issue we see a lot from one patch to the next where systems we rely on spontaneously stop working, or aren't there when they said they would be, or work in a new way that's completely bizarre, and you ask yourself why no one caught it before it went live.
---
Oh don't get me wrong - I'm not upset at other player's builds. I'd just like to see a bit of balance. Where I'm at full health with all my perks into unarmed melee I will still get torn to pieces by something like a yao guai where a bloody player would not only be stronger but off him in a single shot/hit. 
---
I'd like to see something that had some benefits to the regular health players to let us keep up a bit. Obviously not as much since you DO have low health...but stats at 35 is pretty remarkable with all the other perks etc. you have going.
---
Anti armor removes 50% of the armor. Then stabilized removed 45% of that 50%.
---
High levels are the best
---
Post is edited to now include the image.
---
I see, thanks for the information.
---
Yeah, and they probably do play the game, but it’s not for fun and it doesn’t even give them any “progress”.  
---
If their environment is anything like my job environment, they do some coding, check it out in their development environment a bit, then move onto their next coding.  Then they probably have an internal testing server they play a bit on Testing things. But it’s not fun.   Who knows how many times they have to start up new characters or even just do things like sit there while the computer is collecting data for them to analyze.
---
Is the only new piece of content we are going to get in the next month or so. They have to showcase what they have, and sadly isn't much
---
Just a couple of things, 1. You just got me super excited. I know I’ve been playing the game for a long time but I’ve only ever worked with unarmed builds because even though I absolutely love shotguns, all of these posts I kept reading kept telling me that they were worthless due to some Nerf I didn’t know about. 
---
Are you actually telling me that I can make a viable shotgun build without investing too much in requiring a very specific legendary weapon? Because, friend, if you are telling me that shotguns actually shred stuff the way that I thought they should, I will make a new character right freaking now lol.
---
2. Thanks for the workaround. This is my first range build on the game and I wasn’t experiencing it much when people were complaining about it before when it was a much bigger deal. If I have to temporarily go back to my Unarmed toon, so be it I guess :(. I’m optimistic about this, I truly a.m. because it was running so smoothly recently, I just hope that whoever is right or wrong or whatever is right or wrong, the issue resolves itself or gets resolved soon.
---
Its not simping dipshit, it's how the fucking world works. If you want something fixed then you need to actually tell the people that can fix it. If your car breaks down do you go to the local bar and tell everyone how much that brand of car sucks? No, you take it to a fucking garage. Posting shit to reddit and expecting it to fix itself does nothing but feed the lolbethesda circle jerk.
---
Problem is most of us who have been here since beta have all the plans and where expecting something new
---
When you say install WiFi, am I correct in assuming that you have no internet aside from the hotspot?
---
Pretty much. A stealth sniper would have been a better choice to stream it. Time to look around at whats going on, pick off some of the adds, focus on the wendigo on occasion.
---
And you remembered him after all this time, randomly encountered him on a stream, and now want to be his friend?
---
I once got killed cus i had a 10 caps wanted level while i was talking to an npc. I understand he had to kill me but he coulda atleast waited till i was done talking? :(
---
Has to taste better than whomevers ass you've been eating out.
---
Oh, please, get over yourself.
---
One joke can beget another joke.
---
I forget how much perception I have, more than that for sure.maybe 8. 
---
Anyways I only expect to see enemy compass markers when they're aggro on me.
---
It’s probably the only thing they could show...bugs and all
---
Are there any other challenges you are having trouble with?  I have 3 Int and mutations dropping it to 1, no gear raising it,  and I am tied with Zorbo on the board. I do the challenges then usually log out.  I don't grind the repeatable xp challenge to replace NW.
---
"What do you think they’ll do if people like me just nope out of the whole event?"
---
It will literally have zero effect on my game and my life.
---
I strongly dislike PVP. The only time I take workshops is for the legendary run challenges. I take it and leave, mission accomplished.
---
For everyone who has 200 plastic there'll be people like me with 20000+
---
Same with all the other materials. All doable. Except cork. if that one fails i wont be surprised.
---
Odds are those numbers were made up, and the devs just picked them to make it seem like "Oh everybody worked so hard to complete this!"
---
In reality, the cheaters would have completed the challenge in the first few hours.
---
There’s a mod that can do it in the meantime
---
It would be wise to let 1 or 2 fail just so they don't seem like they are playing their hand.  I expect the challenge event and the cork to fail. That way they can say oh sorry I guess we tuned it to high and lower the 4 after to a more reasonable level in appearance.
---
Well with enough ammo you can say any build is viable. But you go from needing 10-15 rounds per SM, to single shots...well now you have to weather their return fire, so you have to be more survivable etc. etc.
---
A bloody build is just SO far ahead in terms of damage (talk of 10K+ per hit?). Now the devs were all playing bloody builds...so now are they balancing future content to players who hit for even 3K per hit? How does that affect other players...does everyone now have to build to that? 
---
I don't begrudge ANY player playing the way they want to...it's a game enjoy it...I just worry that if there is one specific build that so far outstrips all the others that it's 10x better that it becomes the balancing point which then forces others to have to play that way. That's my only concern. If you want to play that way- awesome - you do you! Just as long as the devs don't look at the 10K player and say "right, this is what they can do so let's build this boss to fight them" and suddenly every other player is a bystander.
---
Doubtful, it would make Bethesda look bad so it’ll either be made up numbers or they made things so low that they can’t fail
---
Thing is cork and concrete are much harder to come by, and the rewards are lackluster so whereas dumping steel was no big deal (I personally have 100k), cork or concrete is another matter.  We shall see, but I’d bet some caps we only fail 1, if any.
---
I believe you can't have both. So if you got a AA heavy then the cards trumped by the AA effect. If you got a non AA heavy then the card is usefull. Other things in the ga,e are the same way. A whole set of ammo weight armor, or the ammo weight reducing card. The good with salt card or the food back pack and so on.
---
That’s exactly what I thought right after they delayed it on Tuesday
---
Crap. Okay well thanks for the info!!!
---
Play whatever build you want and don't worry about other people's builds. Crazy concept, I know. Some of you NEED a reason to be mad. It's really weird.
---
Bloodied Power Armor builds are unstoppable pve wise, can't comment on pvp as I don't partake.
---
Throw on some emergency protocols, nerd rage, dodgy, and blocker, and nothing will get you.
---
If...IF they've got some huge update with actual paladins and air ships roaming Appalachia, IF they've already created those things, they're not gonna scrap all that work because of some silly community challenge.
---
Ho-ly shit, that’s a lot extra
---
Congrats! You unlocked the underwear party.
---
Charred Ghouls hand me my ass if I let my guard down... no joke. :P
---
Hey I have only been playing since last June and I turned in 30k steel and got nothing new.  So I can only imagine the folks who have been here longer.
---
I imagine PC dupers have that much cork on them. If not a group of four or five of them can easily blow through that. Honestly, I wouldn't worry about collecting any of this stuff unless you really need the provision boxes. We are going to get all of it regardless if we turn this in or not. Can you imagine the pr nightmare if the entire cross platform community couldn't hit these easily attainable goals?
---
It can be played. It functions. But there are bugs that would be very severe with a wide scale release.
---
It's mostly a time thing. Like I love when people here are like "takes me an hour to do everything", and it's like, good for you. Glad you get to just rush through things. I'd like to actually do this thing called "play the game as an rpg" while I get things done, which i dont always get to do. NW chews through my time and patience like nothing else, however.
---
I just started like my 6th or 7th character the other day. Wish I didnt have to delete characters so often but I do like the feeling of starting over....
---
Your question on AA plus stabilized was answered but the answer to the title question is;  
---
BE gatling plasma with splitter. That is about the most maximum you can get.
---
Y'know, ever since Wastelanders buffed Fire Damage, I haven't had that much luck with Asbestos Lining mitigating it.  If I had such a chest, which is supposed to make me "immune to being set on fire," I shouldn't melt in front of a Flamethrower Trap.  But I do.  Makes me wonder if it wasn't updated to reflect that change.
---
Servers are definitely supposed to remain “yours” for 5 minutes after leaving. It was advertised as such in fallout 1st. These issues seem to be more recent and stem from patch 20 that brought general lag to the game as well.
---
For my alt character biggest adjustment was the tiny carry weight. But now she is running bloodied with a cobbled together set of level 5-15 Unyielding gear. She has her big brother to bag drop junk aid and gear down to her so she doesn't even bother collecting anything to avoid getting overencumbered. She has no fear of death so she dies about 20 times per play session. It's kind of freeing actually. Lol.
---
Yeah another try that was promising but i think we want a very challenging dungeon. I never played a colossal problem maybe it brings some new aspects to the game =) I am curious about the new cursed effect and hope we will find that on other weapons to or maybe we can curse weapons by ourself if we praise our God Todd...
---
Wholeheartedly disagree! Bloodied hvy here, and I honestly don't die anymore then my high health builds.  Only when I forget to watch my health, like at all, or a few very specific circumstances, that would generally kill any of my builds( multiple assaultrons w/ non-stop face lasers, big groups with heavy hitters and some poison, ect)  Out of PA requires more thought and care, but in PA I just need a stim, every now and again.  Alot of damage mitagation in my build, and I have soloed everything except the old vault raids.
---
I don't think I've ever seen such a level of dbag. How do you walk into rooms with all of that ego?
---
sounds funny man thats something i would have appreciated as a low level :D
---
For every step we fail, Bethesda introduces a new glitch.
---
Terraria
---
Even people who have passion for their job, or even their hobby need a break and can get burnt out.  And even if you have a passion for the fallout universe, love the game your working on, if you sit down to play at home, you might not be playing at the level of other people, you might enjoy just being super casual in the game exploring people’s camps or even Just doing some mindless farming.
---
Rifle Gaming did something similar. It’s not completely combined but he and his group placed their camps as close as they can to make a large settlement
---
https://youtu.be/SpX4ucJcxXI
---
I'm such an idiot lol, I didn't think the camo would go on underarmor. But it goes on my urban scout mask so that makes sense. I just wish there was an UA I could get that made my character more "bushy" haha. Just looks very bear and doesn't have that full guillie camo effect imo.
---
How DARE people want the game to be designed well! Shame on us!
---
Thanks. I know that’s a legacy but it’s still something to consider.
---
Yeah... don't care what level you are, I don't want your junk... just want those challenge atoms$$$!
---
(The kool-aid is actually Nukashine.)
---
I've been saving up thousands of cork because I knew there was going to be something that had made me use thousands of... Cork
---
You can one shot mole miners and deathclaws with a non-legendary pipe bolt action rifle
---
I love my unarmed full health carnivore. With a couple food buffs you hit Plenty hard. Leaves so many perk spots for other options.
---
I didn't watch it. I am truly sorry if I sound overly cynical, but I thought the best case scenario would be hearing about a bunch of cool stuff that gets you excited only to be a letdown when it launches. That's the best case scenario.  The worst case scenario is outright disappointment at a lackluster presentation.
---
I was also afraid they might completely ignore numerous issues that have been brought up repeatedly in this sub Reddit, and that's something that I just can't bear to watch. It would be an insult.
---
I know that a lot of people were expecting a trailer for the upcoming BOS content, but I had my doubts.
---
Patch 21 convinced me that they are not serious about this game.   That's not to say it won't keep going for  a while.  I am not declaring the death of this game like some people on here. I don't think the game will die anytime soon.  More like it will be on life support for the coming years.  They will put enough effort into it in order to keep it barely alive and making enough from monetization to justify its existence.
---
But my days of hoping for a great game are over.
---
What is your account on? 
---
If you have it on PC, the bethesda launcher will let you login to different accounts but only need to install the game once. Steam will do the same. If you know someone with an updated version, if you login to their computer and at least get the free atomic shop rewards, even if you can't play. 
---
If you are playing on a laptop you could take it to your boyfriends and update bethesda launcher or Steam Versions on his wifi. You could do the same with a full desktop, but get him to move it - it may weigh a lot and you might need to take a lot of stuff, like monitor keyboard, etc. Just use headphones for sound if you do this. 
---
If you play on PS4, will it allow you to login to his PS4 as you? Then you could play on his some (though he wouldn't be able to). Or you could take your PS4 to his house and update there and both play on his wifi, but you will need a TV or monitor to use at his house - does he have an 2nd TV you could hook up to?
---
Last, do you have internet at home, just not wifi setup? Or do you not have service at all, yet, at your new place? If xfinity is in your area and their store is open, you may be able to go in (you may have to schedule an appt) and get a self install kit. 
---
Can you use your phone as a Hotspot and run on your cellular data? You need a good 4g signal to even try this, but maybe you can switch to unlimited data for a few days with your provider. 
---
Lastly and most shady, can you jump on any neighbor's unsecured wifi? Depending on what type system you use, you may be able to use a powerful external wifi antenna to expand your wifi signal reach and stability. I don't recommend, though.
---
This is where the whole 8-player instance concept runs into problems, because apparently, due to the fact that it's entirely first-come-first-serve, there's no guarantee that you can actually join the event with your *team*.  Some may find themselves in a separate instance, and there's nothing they can do about it.
---
This was vacuously solved in Vault 94 because it only accepted 4 players, and so it was natural to roll in with your team.
---
Save it, we overshot by 80 million I think
---
I mean for gameplay in general you’re totally right. it doesn’t do much for the viewer. She actually does play the game and streams, albeit I can’t attest to her skill lvl. Maybe this event is just a lot harder than it looked? I know they’re employing faking debris. Couldn’t tell how much damage it did. 
---
Like I said, it’s kinda difficult when she’s the face of Bethesda’s content now to have another person come in and say “hey guys, I’m random developer chad.” I think they actually tried this before and the guy was so nervous he could barely get his lines out. I get where you’re coming from though! It’s a problem that could be easily fixed by just hiring a couple more people who engage with the fallout community, or bring on some youtubers that would appreciate the gesture.
---
thats actually the plan
---
i started a youtube chanel like two days ago where i kind of review different builds that you usually dont see 
---
stealth gunslinger and a non stealth vats energy rifle build ao far
---
i have to improve alot though the videos are quite trashy so far :D
---
Looking forward to the C.A.M.P. contest tomorrow where they are sure to praise camps which are no longer able to be built.  Gonna be awkward.
---
My overall experience with this game has not been kind, and I've actually been bullied by high level players. But I guess that's the Xbox community.
---
I understand the time thing, don't want my whole day wasted on this game either.  Kind of why I was wondering why you would bother with NW.  Especially with high Int you could clear a higher level zone, probably for almost the same amount of xp as NW in less time.
---
I have a formula I use for selling stuff at my camp....
---
* plans at 10% of the suggested prices
---
* Chems at 1/2 suggested prices
---
* Mods at 15
---
* ammo at 1, explosives at 5 - probably going to lower to 2 or convert them
---
* Fusion cores at their charge rate
---
* legendary items depend on the rating and what they have for abilities, but less than 1000
---
I'm on xbox and my camp is at the campground overlook near Foundation, stop in for a nuka cola and roasted radtoad any time! :)
---
I'm making a brotherhood field medic character for if they are a joinable faction soon. Also doing Cha and shotguns it seems fun so far
---
I mean, the bombs DID just fall ~~25~~ 26 years ago.
---
The amount of times I've died is wayyyyyy more than last time for sure but I don't actually care lol
---
I told you Bethesda wants people to Min Max lol
---
Didn't we have something like 85 million more than the goal without calculating in what could be turned in today?
---
What makes you think it will be much different for the others?  Because they are a bit harder to obtain?  You underestimate the community if you think we won't hit those numbers easily.
---
Lmao
---
Agree
---
Nuuukkkkaaaaassshiiinnnneeee!!!!
---
Serum recipes, bullion, Sheepsquatch recall cards. There's always something to spend it on.
---
I was expecting a multi cam view of the fight to watch from different play style perspectives. Then again, I attend too many Zoom meetings for work, so that’s my headspace during the pandemic.
---
Like going commando?? XD
---
Slum it outside McDonald’s in a car - their wifi is free
---
Nah, I've seen dupers with literally 1B of quantum. There is a 0% chance some PC player with first didnt literally spawn 100x the amount of scrap needed to complete these. 100x over.
---
It annoys me. Yes it's for the score challenge but I bundle up 308 and 45 and 556 ammo into bundles of 100, for 1 cap a go. It's a nice quantity people are happy to buy. So when three or four idiots come along and buy three separate bullets it messes up my system.
---
If there was any possible nerf to bloodied, it's never going to happen now after that stream hahaha
---
I think that becomes a separate issue.  I think that screams more of how the game is being managed and funded by the company.  I assume they use agile methodology because of how popular it is, and they are probably told “You need to bring in this much money this month” and then they need to prioritize based on that.  Every PI they probably have to prioritize the Atom Shop items (and we see even that backfires) and then with whatever hours left is where they work on new stuff and bug fixes.  It’s probably not enough. 
---
I blame all the issues with this game on upper management and the time constraints that are put on the devs.  You see it with other games (Anthem, No Man’s Sky, Assassin’s Creed, etc)
---
personally, as a high level player, i have a lot of fun and enjoyment from giving or helping newbies, so I'm glad to read your first experience was pleasant!
---
despite all of the faults of the game, and the passionate criticism from the playerbase regarding many issues, it still brings joy to see that this sub still sees a lot of *these* kinds of posts. :)
---
When I joined a couple of months ago I had a high level player give me some armor to help me in my way and in return I have been helping others as I can. Whether it's armor, weapons or Aids. And it is a great community all wastelanders join to together to make a better world.
---
Over half the original goal.
---
I mean “only” a day in a 4 day span is pretty great. We actually hit the quota somewhere shortly after the 2-day mark as we were at 170% of the needed supply the next day.
---
Our community isn’t massive, but I’m pretty sure we’ll hit those quotas pretty easily. Bethesda wouldn’t want to risk a number they didn’t think was feasible as they’d either be called liars for posting way too big a number or cheap for denying us the reward anyways.
---
You realize that's not how any of this works right?  Nothing has changed with the "stability" of the servers, Bethesda doesn't even DO anything to the servers outside of uploading the latest build of the game, they don't even OWN the servers because they're renting them from Amazon, hell the server don't even "EXIST" because the game is running off of Amazon's instanced cloud servers.
---
Even beyond that if your game is getting low fps and freezing those aren't even server issues, that sounds more like something wrong with your system.  If you were having server issues you'd be experiencing issues related to connectivity like rubber banding, lagging or disconnects.
---
Having a lobby full of players with stashes full of legendary gear, each with their own conditions, damages, resistances and such, can't possibly be good for game performance. 
---
Even having a lot of notes and plans in your inventory slows the game down (on ps4). So I can only speculate that legendary gear in a stash can have a similar effect on performance. 
---
If players were to be able to scrip an unlimited (or very high amount) of legendaries, all of those separately tracked variables become a single variable. The player's scrip bank.
---
The limit on scrip can then be shifted to how much you can spend in one week/day. 
---
Disclaimer!
---
I don't pretend to know anything about game performance or factors that help or hinder lag on a code-level. I only have my experiences and those of my friends to draw conclusions from.
---
They could also be a Smurf ;). Crazy gear on a low lvl character
---
As long as it’s both options like the greenhouse I’m cool with it.
---
Because for whatever reason I don't accumulate a lot of XP per day overall, so the "it's so easy" 100 point repeatable fix isn't quite the option for me that it would be. 
---
I'm trying to not make it a grind, doing what I want within the limits, but yeah. Diminishing returns now. A bit of desperation.
---
I donated the same, been on since the start and was fine as well.  Always nice when there is something really rare, but I would rate it the same!
---
I always like to build nuclear fission reactors for the lower level players that come into my team just so they can build up a massive collection of those highly coveted items called gears!
---
Yeah bought on release day... there isnt a thing im looking for anymore. I build fancy looking camps now... and then they broke that too.
---
You can use this [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/daily.html) to see the dailies and weekly before logging in-game.
---
If you wait some other player swoops in and gets the kill, it's really just about the atoms
---
As soon as I logged on yesterday I noticed it had been nuked. Then someone else nuked it again about 20 min. later.
---
Because it would remove a way for them to make people log in everyday
---
**Usually**, I can just do it a second time and I'm good. But sometimes I need to do it more than that. I wonder if talking to someone else really fixes it, or it's just another one of those circumstantial things.
---
As an example, I've been hitting one of the fast travel bugs recently - many times I go to fast travel, and instead of a loading screen I am just taken back to my normal play view. I read somewhere that "moving a little bit" helps, so I started doing that and it seemed to work. However, recently I just decided to try to fast travel a second time, and that is usually working for me. 
---
I did word my post poorly. I was trying to state that I've found nothing that would prevent it from happening in the first place.
---
I like to build lvl 5 guns and armor to leave at the overseers camp
---
so dodgey isn't just a clever name
---
You can get cork by scrap any pipe weapon, using scrapper perk Its easy to farm. Come on guys, let's do it, don't give up!!!
---
Yeah i think you can only notice that if you solo Queen.
---
I’m pretty sure all quest progress is only saved after leaving an instanced interior. There’s even a loading screen text telling you to make sure you finish a quest before logging out of instanced space(areas where only you and your team can go together).
---
If anybody did anything but laugh in Bethesda's face when they announced FO1st, I have no sympathy. They are enabling and validating the very worst behavior of the gaming industry.
---
You need to have the junk on you. Not on your stash or scrap box. 
---
Also be sure it’s in its “steel” form. Not in bulk.
---
It's been there for over a month BTW. I know this patch was bad, but just to be clear this is a problem that just wasn't fixed.
---
This certainly needed to be a post.
---
Probably a dumb question: where do you claim the beret?
---
I wonder if it has to do with the new “currency” listed in collections called, Perk Points.
---
Sign me up!
---
Fair enough
---
Haven’t noticed that, but I think they did fix the bug where lifegiver was healing players. So if you’re not for sure you’re taking more dmg, that fix could have made you seem weaker
---
People have claimed we were 85 million over, but I have no clue how they would know that. The counter filled and then stopped.
---
Emergency protocols? What else do you use in bloodied PA?
---
They certainly don't understand the game well enough to stand a chance if beating it without that sweet bloodied damage. Definitely can be done, but not by those yobbos.
---
I’m pretty sure that’s for legendary perks, but who knows if it will be for both.
---
We already did according to the official website
---
Absolutely!
---
Yeah, that's probably it. I noticed that, wasn't sure what that was. Thanks.
---
As someone on their third character, I've better things to do than go farm treasures. I'd rather sell them and put some caps in my pockets.
---
That's fine, but the quest was bugged, no interaction possible, and the elevator wouldn't let me leave the area. My solution was to quit and uninstall 76 again. I don't think I'll come back this time.
---
Hopefully they'll understand it needs to be a mid fight change up, not something we have to go into several menus to get to.
---
Yeah not like they can make more. Honestly its not that you can see your progress. they update it manually so they can do whatever they want with those numbers.
---
This.
---
Ive learned the hard way how for I can fall without dying.  Always pt on PA before I hit that height, just in case
---
The speed demon &amp; life giver/rejuvenated bug has been fixed, so people with bloodied builds are actually dying way more often now, not saying that you can't be tanky still, but way less.
---
People saying it's not fun etc. well, that's rather subjective, I have always liked glass canon builds in my games -- so I'm glad I have that option. At this point however I would probably change to something else, but there aren't many other options, nothing truly interesting, for me bloodied is at least somewhat engaging (despite its flaws and micro-management). Last but not least, let's not forget the massive boost to EXP thanks to high Int, and let's be honest -- it's quite unfair that we have it.
---
For me it's not that big of a deal, some tweaking and introducing/changing a few other armor types and/or mutations would do it, but Bethesda has been lazy. What is REALLY not Ok however is the fact that the game allows for completely broken setups to exist, "SBQ dead in a few seconds" type of builds due to bugs etc.
---
308 burns through ammo like crazy. I’m aware I can use ammosmith and superduper. Along with my ammo machine from the raiders etc. But man does ammo go by quick. I currently have a 3 star furious explosive and I forgot the third effect. I only use it to shoot down the cargo with the nuclear keycard in it. 
---
The roll you got on your weapon is really good. Specially with the right perks and build for it. But you’ll notice how easy it is to get trigger happy.
---
Ricochet, blocker, on the PA itself, calibrated shocks, targeting helmet, and em protocols 3 points in fireproof also.
---
The burnout is real. Everyone needs a break. If I put my name on it I’m going to make sure it’s sound because it reflects on me. That’s what I mean between passion and just showing up.
---
It would be cool if you could put it onto your favorite wheel so it’s fast and easy.
---
Pretty sure only part of that team is still on 76. Their studio has mostly just been picking up the slack on minor bugs or projects from other studios by how it sounds.
---
Have you tried it? Because it’s pretty damn fun lol I mean yeah it gets old after a while just one shotting everything But it’s a queen killing build for sure, also good for leveling because of the unyeilding. But even so, all it takes is to unequip the bloodied weapon and use something else that maybe you’re not even specced for and then you’re all balanced out, damage-wise at least. I pretty much only equip my bloodied weapons at fissure site prime, they’re literally not needed anywhere else in the game.
---
LOLLLLLLL!
---
Certainly a game changer, leaves other builds in the dust mostly. I see why the game and market is flooded with bloody and unyielding everything, lol. As OP stated, not much benefit in much else.
---
Yay. I can get this done fast after work and then play the Avengers beta. Thanks for the post!
---
I completely hear you on that.   
---
I'm just trying to brainstorm more ways to improve the investment each month. 
---
Right now it just feels like I'm paying for a glorified stash box, if that makes sense.
---
*we're looking into this*
---
Yeah I'm on Steam too which they said was one of the triggers.  The ones I finished were killing scorched with shotgun, pistol, and took over the last workshop I needed
---
Sorry to hear that and I get it, just wanted to let you know why your progress wasn’t saved. I know the final vault heist has had a few major bugs
---
No battle royale or online multiplayer fps will be popular if it isn't developed past beta. It's 100% Bethesda's fault that not a lot of people are playing. They have abandoned it. They have a unique BR and a good formula, just terrible technical execution.
---
You are a sweetheart
---
Yep, burnt through 500 rounds before the Queen even mutated. Was good for sweeping up the mob though.
---
They really need to. I mean anything would have some value, but if they're making it new there's no reason to settle for less.
---
Nice. Have around 170 levels to spend on my main. I just may make him a bloodied PA. Thanks man.
---
I’ve personally donated 6,000. 3,000 were from my scrap box. And the other 3 were from weapon farming west tek and server hopping for the past hour. 
---
I’m a high level player so there isn’t much else for me to do. My daily challenges can be done under an hour. So might as well get some xp/ammo and kill mutants. 
---
I’ve gotten a lot of alocohol, caps, ammo, but believe it or not, not a single plan yet. I believe the number is real. I mean how many other people like me decided to turn in steel just for the hell of it.
---
Cork isn't Steel though.  And we need *more* Cork than Steel.
---
The things that supply Cork are very finite - only about a dozen in all, mostly boiling down to Baseballs, Golf Balls, and Globes.
---
It's seldom a resource you are swimming in, nor one you're likely to keep around in Bulk (for those without Scrapboxes) because it isn't used for that much.
---
Thank you for your comment. I’m not locked into any direction on this because as you suggest, there are quite a few variables, I simply know that my recent experience has been not encountering this problem and now suddenly encountering it consistently. 
---
I never get on Reddit to ruffle feathers or be a dick so I try to keep an open mind. You are the fourth or fifth person to say this so until they “fix” this or it just naturally gets better or something, I’m just going to make a new character who doesn’t rely on single shot head pop off murder tricks. I’ve been wanting to make a heavy gunner power armor build for a very long time so I’ll give it a shot. Thanks for your comment :-)
---
Yes. I tried and still retain my bloodied build PC. If i wanted to play the game on super easy mode then sure, I'd play bloodied but it's get old immediately. To each their own but meta is mega... boring
---
&gt;They could have these people testing things such as skins, quest, weapons, perks, etc so when each patch comes out we don't have an absolute crap fest of "Hey let's see what's not working or gotten worse this time." There is once again a patch where some things that are super busted such as my Raider ALT right now can't even play the game because the quest are so bugged I can't do them at all.
---
it all comes down to money.  Someone higher up has determined that there would not be enough return on investment to move resources from whatever project that those people are working on to FO76, as It is I wouldn’t be surprised if some of the resources for FO76 had to work on more than one thing, only given a % of their daily capacity towards FO76 (also there was a hot fix yesterday, the raider quest bug should be fixed for you)
---
Apparently the queen is complete immune to explosive weapons, or simply has a huge damage resistance against explosion. Your weapon will still damage her obviously because of the ballistic damage, specially if you put the prime receiver on it. But figured I’d let you know explosions don’t do much against her.
---
Yeah, I can see switching between weapon types. I have mostly heavy gunner but then I can switch it out for shotgunner or gladiator on the fly.
---
Aren't there some baseballs at the amusement park? That's a few more...
---
The counter has a number on it. Over 200m. Doesn’t display properly on mobile.
---
I'm quietly confident they chose their numbers based on what they find people typically loot of a given resource because I assume that's a statistic they have.
---
But I don't think they counted on the potential drop-off or unwillingness of players to engage with this event.
---
i load fallout 76 assets into nifskope all the time. get the newest version and you‘re good.!
---
Makes sense. Thanks.
---
Gotta pad the inside of your PA with something. I guess. Maybe.
---
Hmmm...
---
Interesting. I haven’t had an issue with fire. What platform are you? I’m Xbox.
---
Assuming you don't get the reward unless you donate, giving people a chance to donate would make sense.  I don't know if that's the case though.
---
Yah I def understand. If it was a flat fee I’d be on that, but $100 a year? I’ll just buy a new game w/ dlc each year instead. They’re really trying to copy eso, but they don’t have the ppl to make content that expansive for a membership. Seems like most the FO1st weren’t even to peeved until Bethesda started getting cheap with regular content updates too. I think if they just introduced dedicated servers for you guys and employed a better trading system so you can easily sell items even when you’re in a private lobby that would solve a ton of problems rn
---
But that’s also a massive add on
---
Yes but they still have people working on it. It's like literally nobody working on it even logs into the game more then once to look around.
---
If you think it will be free, I have a hard copy of Fallout 76 to sell you.
---
There is for the ss armor I just bought the ss underarmor plans and I made some and it won't let me camo it
---
Nice love this kind of base, much more fun!
---
There’s still those players who never revive during Scorched Earth, can I get a F for our fallen comrades who never get revived 😭
---
Wrong, if the event fails I shall find your home and fill your truck or car with chopped cork and loose screws 😎
---
Very fun build, loud and proud. If you fully commit to PA, you can stop carrying regular armor at all. Make sure to get a good selection of mutations(adrenal reaction without doubt!) The points let you switch to melee or shotgun if you want.
---
That sounds like the better time personally.
---
Literally looking at the website right now on a desktop. Counter says 125m.
---
When ever I see someone reach one of the mile stones, lv 5, 15, 25. I always stop by and give them a present. Everyone gets a brotherhood recon sniper, at max damage, a partial or full set of PA at your level, a nukashine and all my known plans that have accumulated since the last gift. Great fun seeing a lv 5 pass out and wake up outside the entrance to the secret service
---
Heavy gunner/melee is going to be a new classic, going to make a lot of people happy. That and rifle/automatics.
---
Jokes on you, I'm homeless.
---
You don’t, your locked in forever! Mwah ha ha!
---
Oh darn it u figured it out.
---
Yup. Thought the same exact thing. They are so out of touch it hurts.
---
I sell stuff for cheap, all my ammo is 1 cap a piece, if I see a low level eyeballing my stuff I usually see if they need something specific and help them out the best I can.
---
I really think this has to do more with the consoles being able to run it correctly
---
Edit: I play on xbox so I'm not bashing the consoles, but this just shows the issue with the pts being pc only
---
That's a lot of failure to achieve in such a relatively short post. Take a deserved bow.
---
Same.  I gave 0 steel because of the poor rewards.  If they did 4-5 BoS themed items, like they did for other gift type events, then I would have been all over this one.
---
Thing is cork and concrete aren’t near as common as steel.  For the 100k steel that I have, and I don’t hunt for, I have about 5k cork and 5k concrete spread across 5 characters.  That’s roughly an order of magnitude difference in materials from casual play, forget farming where you can hunt steel easily. Hence why I think we’re gonna see very low numbers on cork and concrete.
---
I’ll do that with a curling iron
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if for many of them, they do have a passion for it.  They probably know there are bugs out there that haven’t been resolved.  They don’t get to make the choice of waiting, to get more resources to fix issues, or even to give out better compensation to players.  
---
That is something I can speak from personal experience on, it is one of the worst feelings to enjoy doing something, but being given the direction to release something that’s not ready. You have to options - quit and they do it anyways without you, or stick around because you believe you will be able to fix it but you have to put out a product you aren’t comfortable with. 
---
Obviously, for a lot of people, quitting just isn’t an option no matter the passion you have for your job.
---
Okay this helps a lot, I played the game at release and got to level 46 with all the original quest tracks almost finished and just recently got to 50 last week so I’ll probably get to doing that
---
I don’t think I mentioned the full health part initially. I really wanted badly to do something really really different from a bloody build... but full health PAHG just leaves a lot to be desired imo.
---
I would love other builds to be viable in this game
---
There is a community spread out across the three platforms who are nuking Atlas constantly. I dont think they realise, they could just use one silo to nuke it every three hours as the blast zone and cooldown are the same 3 hrs, then everyone else could just be useing nukes for SBQ or to hit scammers and bullies.
---
I find this particularly odd because there is seemingly so much new content coming in the next 4 months that we know nothing about. 2 new questlines, new events, new features. I was expecting at least a release date for Steel Dawn or something
---
They rly probably don’t. Some ppl were saying it could be as few as 10, and most of those are 3D designers with only a few coders. My guess is they’re just pumping out cosmetics and throwing it at the the guys that need to apply it and then it gets sent out. At best they are probably using a 1 or 2 player models to check. This project is being treated like the equivalent to sending the intern on a coffee run. I wish BGS would put more ppl into this, even if it meant Starfield or ES6 cane a bit later...
---
Blocker should just be called anti ghoul, you run into so many more of them than other melee enemies, and melee scorch are just a joke.
---
OP doesn't know jack shit. The actual answer is that it will be available in the Atom shop on August 11.
---
Nice!
---
I have a suspicion it's fake I don't think they would bother creating assets that are not going to be used. I believe the goals will be reached whether it's legit or not.
---
Hahahahahaha
---
I mean, its only been in the game for months now.
---
Checking on this to see where we're at!
---
Over 3k is a crit sneaky headshot, from a bloodied, fully unyielding rifleman using an instigating lever with 50% limb damage.
---
I could also use an instigating HM (no further prefixes needed) for 2* 1.5k crits, but the lever is more fun as for me vats is really really accurate, starting around 35%.
---
Are there archives or replays available for these twitch streams?
---
You weren't really allowed to build fancy looking camps, you were breaking the law, now you will have to be punished! 😡😡😡
---
I noticed this too.
---
Agreed, that’s why I change it up and use other legendary prefixes with low health, I’m specced for rifles but I mainly run around with a station pump and a  10mm pistol to feel human. I pretty much only stay low health and whip out my bloodied stuff for queen fights because I like to be the one dealing huge damage. I only started playing like this recently, where as my first 400 hours I was full health with no “legendary” build, I’m sure I’ll get super bored and tired of it because I can already feel the monotony setting in but being bloodied is still pretty fresh for me.
---

---
 &gt; Checking on this to see where we're at!
---
Unfortunately in the current state, not many builds get close. Most of us are disappointed that the meta is so uniform :-/
---
Even some of us bloodied builds hate bloodied builds.
---
Which version are you using?
---
On the bar itself. Like I said. Some browsers aren’t showing it correctly.  It’s 208m I believe.
---
That proves that it still needs some work. Anyone remember getting a drill after completing the vault 94 raid?
---
Sure and I agree Cork in particular is what I'm least sure of, but I've only been back a short time after playing at launch and can contribute 1500 cork right off the bat.  
---
If 200m is the number for cork, and assuming there is roughly 400k players like was stated in some other threads, each person needs to contribute 500 cork over the course of that period of a few days.  Considering players like myself will be contributing 3x that number, and even more who are out there who have been stacking up those resources since F1st came out, I would wager that we shouldn't have much trouble, but we will see.
---
And you cannot craft the fishbowl helmet for the captain cosmos outfit.
---
I'm impressed, cardboard shacks have come up in the world what with electricity and cable internet 👍
---
Yeah I wasn’t expecting a whole lot but I was at least hoping for some kind of tease or trailer or content reveal for any of the many DLC’s in the next couple months haha.
---
Hey that’s a neat idea
---
wasted outrage yo
---
At first I only read your title and wanted to answer, “Is it... music?”
---
Haven’t had that bug before!
---
The mirelurks have taken me in. We do not ask for any blood to be shed. Snip snip
---
I get that all the time too! I just assumed ghosts/Bethesda
---
mine is still on because i never took the rainbow icon lol.
---
No reason for me to think that's an accurate count, then. Just as I assumed.
---
But pistols are garbage.
---
Yep, just cause 8ppl can play it by themselves doesn’t mean multiple servers can handle it. The game did have some major lag when they started the stream though
---
Scrap those bad buoys
---
A refrigerator box, to be precise. My home/office/rocketship.
---
I was trying to listen to the robot right outside of 76, and all I kept hearing was him heavy breathing into his microphone and whispering stuff to my character... then as I got out of the menu he emoted and said to join the enclave in a raspy creepy voice, after that he was gone. 
---
I’ve since subbed to 1st for the private server, but I plan on making my way back into the depths of roleplayers in public lobbies after I’ve got a decent CAMP and supplies. I’m excited to meet more like him.
---
I hear the sound every time I get a notification in the upper left hand of the screen, for example every 5 minutes it reminds me I’m suffering from Rad Worms since it’s a day that ends in Y.
---
Usually the following Tuesday when they update the Atomic Shop.  That's how it was with Project Clean Appalachia last year.
---
So craft them and scrap them. Rinse and repeat ??
---
Got me a JE combat rifle for 5k during faschnat. 
---
I was so grateful.
---
I'll try some of those and look up some videos.  But the thing I dont get is why the game just wont work. Even if only one console is on, it wont connect.  And it worked fine for months until they rolled out the update a week or so ago
---
Thank you so very, very much! It worked perfectly!
---
I was reluctant to cancel the subscription because the only option to manage it in my account was to cancel the subscription. I kept finding things that said Microsoft Store subscriptions were non-refundable. I was worried that some kind of linking/transfer of the sub was possible but getting a refund was not, and I'd just be making a bigger mess of things.
---
But once I clicked "cancel" it did say I'd be getting a refund!
---
That's alot of shitty grenades and alcoho.  Thank you community. Was to busy playing the actual game rather than donating more than the 250 I put in to check the loot table.
---
There are plenty that were duped so while people may want a rare item the trade is simple enough to find.
---
I don't even have a build, i just use my favorite perks and favorite guns, outside of the few bullet sponge enemies you really don't need all that damage.
---
And if you’re PC, it’s my civic duty to craft you a few.
---
i didn't know i could sell them.
---
thanks for the info.
---
This is what the patch notes said:
---
&gt;**Please note:** Today’s update brings the new Public Event “A Colossal Problem” to the game. However, we are still making some performance tweaks and doing additional testing before we enable the event. We are planning to make “A Colossal Problem” available with a follow-up update in the next couple of weeks
---
It sounds like they were putting polish on it before activating it.  Isn’t this what we want? Them to be actively fixing the stupid issues before the release it?
---
&gt;I have a suspicion it's fake I don't think they would bother creating assets that are not going to be used.
---
This *is* Bethesda.  They are the kings of making unique content that few players will ever see.  That's kind of their shtick.
---
If we don't get Atlas to its max state now, you can probably be confident it will be by the time Fractured Steel happens.
---
Same here! Got asbestos lined leather chest and keep getting set on fire from Gulpers. I took the upgrade off and put it back on again, but don’t recall if I’ve tested it since
---
I call that the invisible rake, because you randomly take damage while stepping on nothing.
---
Beth... I canceled by Fo1st monthly sub today that I had since day 1 it was offered as these constant patches that break just as much or more than they fix is complete disrespect to all of us that have been paying for fo1st sub since you offered it day 1.   For the most part I only play NW since January of this year so I've been paying for a sub I don't really need, but I was trying to support your product and team because holy crap we need updates, patches, and \*FIXES\* and I was putting my money in support of that.
---
What broke the camels back for me is this latest patch you fix Adrenaline in Adventure but not in NW.  This shows me literally NO ONE at Beth tested this patch in NW, as you would see it first attempt.  How long does it take you to release a map for NW?  We are like the red-headed step children, and it's sad because its an endlessly fun game mode.... (edit: also the teams still get broken up partially between matches pretty often so that issue is not completely fixed...)
---
I'll consider re-subbing if you can prove with a track record in the future you can in fact make patches that fix what they set out to without breaking stuff in the process, I know development is hard, but that's the career path you chose.
---
I hope you can course correct, but until then, I have to stop rewarding your incompetence of just giving you money each month for 'this' level of service.
---
Drop the fake rage. They said it needed tweaks. Running it at Quakecon doesn’t mean they lied or anything. If it’s two weeks away that means it’s playable even if there are minor issues.
---
at least by them still experiencing the Fast Travel bug we know they weren't on some magical internal server w/ all the fixes
---
Good luck my friend and all the best!
---
Isn't cork used to lighten armor weight? Makes perfect sense for them to need all that cork with their heavy ass armor.
---
Its fallout 76 so not as intended lol.
---
This is awesome to hear. When the game first launched and was really unpleasant, I would see a lot of griefers. since wastelanders came out, things have been a lot better. I have only run across a couple of people griefing and everyone else has been awesome. I have done what I can to give things to low level players as was done for me when I was low level and I think it helps the community grow for sure
---
At this point I'm more interested in bug fixes than having to wait for another opportunity to farm furious rolling pins. I do appreciate the upgrade over the nocturnal rolling pin I got from the sbq, but I can wait a couple more weeks. At least if it acts up after the delays  we can flip out with a clear conscious.
---
For the many problems this game has, the community completely makes up for it. I've never played another game with a community like this before. That's what makes the game so addicting.
---
I love helping newbs wherever I can (I'm still one at like l22).
---
Just the other day I was visiting someone's camp and their vendor and saw their turrets were broken, so I repaired each one.
---
It's the little acts of kindness that helps us all :)
---
some weigh less. And you can sell bulked stuff to vendors
---
you were probably higher level and had better gear because you didnt bum rush the main story the first time...
---
And how exactly? With the same limits, if bethesda doesn't want to make them bigger, it will be the same 9800 caps per week, or 1050 scrip per week. Just instead of worrying about it every day, people could adjust their play time better. Scrip cap definitely should be atleast 2 times bigger
---
Yep. Watoga Brotherhood vendor always sells several scope plans, but besides those, get to scrappin’.
---
Hello there’s a great community I joined not long ago called PKOA
---
Definitely go for speed demon for your mutations! That way you can zip around the battle field to revive players. I’d probably focus on whatever perks effect a flamer and the Charisma perk that allows you to heal players via flame. Though I’m assuming your charisma will be high for all the healing factor perks. I’d also do  the luck perk that gives you extra chems from chest! Sorry if that’s kinda rough, I just got excited to think about how I’d play as a healer in 76
---
No one believes you.
---
I wish i could explicitly only sell to low level people
---
I wanna price things low but dont want some scumbag buying it to resell it
---
Only thing i care to really make a profit on is stable flux
---
Have you tried logging out and back in? Could be the level was set by another player in that area of the map. Relogging might set it at your current level.
---
Idk if anyone else brought this up but with the new update teslas are broken and after a while of shooting they leave what can appear as chain where the shots have arked from. I’m on xbox and me and my pals were testing it out and after I died a few times I could see the whole wss roof was just covered in things that said chain. Don’t know how this happened but any server where people may be shining teslas the more they use them the laggier the server will get.
---
Lmfao thanks
---
I heard it causes lag on the server it runs on. Game cant handle it as usual.
---
That’s great to hear and like you said, just pay it forward.
---
Bethesda: *desperate to not allow 76 to become a meme*

Also Bethesda: *memes themselves*

I haven't even finished downloading yet but that idea sounds awesome healing with a flamer didnt even cross my mind as an option thanks for the idea!

---
With Adrenaline proc and VATS, your Instigating Plasma Caster will get to 1500+ damage. I was fortunate to get Instigating/10%/15% on my very first roll! What a fun weapon that is.
---
I understand the appeal of Vampire's, but with tank build you simply don't need it. Cola Nut / Blocker / Born Survivor / etc makes you all but invincible. Remember I haven't died to anything in over a year... hundreds of levels ago.
---
Happy hunting!
---
Your own thing being getting 45% less XP.  Sure.  Stupid, but it's good you own it.
---
And then make the damn vending machines take the same thing.
---
Do you also owe your soul to the company store?
---
It’s the bass riff which has started to accompany top-lefthand notifications, and it usually starts after you hop into Adventure after being in NW. Really ups the grooviness of being notified that you’ve contracted glowing pustules
---
I don't think they will.
---
Swimsuit...?  You mean the 50’s era one piece lol
---
Some you can only sell to vendor bots as bulk
---
Yes, we do.  But people forget that A Colossal Problem was *already delayed* by a month.  It was supposed to be in Patch 20, not 21, and it missed that mark completely.
---
Sure, take the time you need to get it right.  If it needs work, it needs work.  But don't take our patience for granted by announcing another delay at the absolute last minute.
---
Serums
---
Because there's a lot of sexist, misogynistic people out there.   Including Bethesda, who makes the outfits.  But for some reason won't make a male thong bathing suit... or even a 50s style male bathing suit.  Go figure.
---
The grown-up among us want this, yes.
---
SQUEEZE ME MACARONI!!!

Yeah and his dick is pretty big, no homo

You're arguing semantics of a language you clearly don't speak.

---
probably it depends on how many worlds are created on a physical server. I play at nights and for me the game goes well but at prime time I have experienced some troubles with register and response time. private worlds work just perfect. I guess the main problem is a total quantity of spawn items for a single world. While other mmo transfer coordinates of players to u the fo76 transfer the whole bunch of items u can interact with in the area and coordinates of other players, their camps and basic stats of their camps. The world itself has all of it multiplied by number of players with all their stats and inventories. So if u move so much data u need to have a good hardware. So many heavily loaded worlds at the same time. What hardware can handle this?! as a network technician u can respond this question for urself.
---
Everybody gets the rewards. Keep your steel.
---
I thought they were out of touch because they didn’t play the game? Make up your mind.
---
It’s a rarely used build but still something that is very useful! Im definitely gonna look more into this when I get home, it sounds fun!
---
What makes you think there’s animosity? Bet you also believe they removed a trailer for NV because Bethesda was sooo jealous, right?
---
My guess is the colossal delay was so last minute they didn’t have time to find something else to showcase, so they just went for the PTS demo. I mean, what would you showcase? Wastelanders is old news, and none of the others events like Legendary Run and Atlas amount to an entire presentation. The rest of the FO76 panels are just camp tours and speed runs. This game ain’t in the healthiest place right now.
---
That wouldn't surprise me, with so much crap going on during the event.
---
On the other hand, as some have pointed out, is this event really that much heavier than Project Paradise?  Seems debatable.
---
Recall cards? What do they do? And bullion only do once a week :( and my man I completely forgot about the serums recipes. Thanks!
---
Events like this should have an ingame display, after all, there's a spare few cm on there for more popups.
---
Do you have marsupial or a jet pack?
---
Sweet Jesus please yes. I'm so tired of scrolling through a billion keys (and all the accidental duplicates).
---
Can't drop
---
Can't scrap
---
Can't stash
---
Can't can't can't
---
•___•
---
The monster mash mask is known bug. Usually logging out and back in will get rid of it. And daily’s for rep reset at 8pm est.
---
The game is one of the easiest online mmo type'ish games i have played in 20 years. If you find Fallout 76 difficult i have some news for you.. It not the game that is at fault.
---
It's fucking ridiculous. I don't even know what to keep or drop at this point. I then also have to dedicate some of the space in the stash box for vending which is a shit show in itself.
---
Hate this queen fight. I go to the fight to hunt the adds, I will help kill the queen if the crowd seems to be struggling. All the trenches over there break up your line of sight and vats. Also if you die you respawn in the rads for sure. I skip these fight unless I really need some treasury notes. To each their own!
---
Well the dailys should be reset if I haven't played for a few days, or am I wrong ?
---
Lots and lots of nuka grenades!
---
Are you online now?
---
Haha any release date given for upcoming content would mean absolutely nothing. I think we've seen ample evidence of that in the last year.
---
How many hours do you have to sink into this? I have 2 hours per evening max, at a push.
---
Compared to FO3 and 4, this is a nightmare.
---
Gorge Junkyard has a black titanium extractor
---
I remember when I first started playing, and I was bumming around some train station at level 7 and a level 147 came to me and dropped me a furious explosive pipe rifle and a resistant brotherhood officer suit. Now I'm level 178, I still have the suit equipped and the pipe rifle is hanging in my C.A.M.P above the bed.
---
Because some people will only log in on a Saturday and want to be able to get something for the steel they've been saving up like it was announced they could.
---
Yeah usually it only happens the first couple of times I talk to them, but there's been times I almost just didn't turn in a daily because I couldn't talk to them, so I decided to go turn in a different quest, come back, and it worked. Today I was trying to turn in my photos to the girl at Crater and I could not get past the first thing she says. Probably did it 10+ times, then decide to talk to some guy working in the field, went back, and it worked the first time.
---
I'll have to try it more, but it may be something that fixes it.
---
I've gotten the fast travel one a lot too, but at most it's taken me 4 tries. Usually it works by the second
---
and u can consider this as a some kind of help for new players.
---
Basically what others said. Some items are so common they need to be bulked to be worth more than 0 caps.
---
I snuggle my tent up to one of the little copse of trees, where she can't land anyway.
---
I hate Ward I hope he stumbles off a cliff....
---
My favorite part is the crazy special boosts. With max unyielding SS armor plus jetpack, I can reach just about anywhere.
---
People still getting plans and caps for it.
---
Lotta new people, particularly from the MS game pass, that don't have most of the plans and turning common as dirt steel in for it is a great thing.
---
Explore the forest, ash heap, and toxic valley until you're levelled up. The mire and bog aren't meant for early game. Trust me once you're well levelled and equipped it is way too easy.
---
Stop bringing up politics and all this drama, this is a game for god sake.
---
I have mine in an Emmett Mountain hazmat suit.
---
I just got off. I don't believe that I have that plan but I do have a few mini nukes and a handfull of missles.
---
I would guess the majority of work is on the large content updates (previously Wastelanders, now the upcoming Steel Dawn and Fractured Steel), it does look like there is a lack of manpower allocated to the regular smaller patches between those. And then some parts of Austin may be working on other projects, or it is just not a large studio in the first place (according to [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin), many people were laid off in 2015 when BattleCry's original project was canceled).
---
I usually end up picking them up from random players vending machines, they usually sell them at the default price of 25 caps. Not sure where you'd find them as spawns.
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc](https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc) 
---
Check out this map, it shows roughly the level caps for each zone. If high level players have been through an area recently, the enemies will spawn at the level cap for that area. At your level, you should be finishing up up north in the Toxic Valley and just starting the Ash Heap. The main quests will take you to areas you aren't ready for if you don't slow down and do side quests and events to level.
---
Also, this should be addressed with the One Wasteland update where everything will scale to the player. This is due out later this year.
---
Pretty sure all the pipe weapons have cork when scrapped.
---
Ahhhh, that's what the cats are from.  I've seen the cats before but not the bot.
---
Well in the year 2050 we will probably be able to communicate with our computer via thought. So, when this comes out, it will be super easy and intuitive.
---
I think that's the problem - I'm just not levelling up. I regularly see players with triple figure levels and wonder how the hell they got there?
---
I don't know what marsupial is and I have a jetpack mod but haven't equipped it for a t-60.
---
I found I mixed and matched perk cards with both rifles and commando as I got to level 150. As long as your invested in perception and agility you should be able to look through upgrading those cards and experimenting. I’d fully invest in commando for perks til you reach a higher and more equipped level. Use rifles for small enemies then bust out a full auto handmade for the big boys.
---
This is one of the easiest games I've ever played. You don't get everything in the beginning and you need to work for it. Take your time and level yourself. Maybe plan your build out a little.
---
Level 50 is about when I started one shotting enemies.
---
Do you have them pending in your quest log by chance?
---
I bust out my tesla and avoid sneak. Tag everything and I'm virtually unkillable anyway so who cares if I get hit.
---
So honestly, seeing this kinda made me sick. I'm also kind of concerned that one of the players was using a "magic" weapon given how quick the health dropped towards the end with half the team dead.   
---
I don't know how this game is every going to stand a chance at balance when the dev team is actively supporting one of the most blatantly broken playstyles in this game. 
---
I mean it looks like they balanced this event against bloodied builds.
---
I actually am playing rn and got two chainsaws, one from the mountain side B n' B and the other from the lumbermill, I got the more range mod from scrapping the second one and am able to apply it so I guess they are learnable afterall, maybe you had just been unlucky ?
---
I left the game pretty early on, and was always afraid to return out of fear from the stories I've heard and personal experiences from other online multiplayer games. Maybe I'll have to check it out again sometime.
---
No I don't
---
You get caps, booze and plans.
---
For new players, of which there are a lot, the plans are excellent and the caps/booze are nice too.
---
Right, but with Bethesda's track record on installing patches, their attempt at installing a big would end up giving every player in the game a huge buff
---
And not everything will be for all players. I say that as also having played from launch and have just about all plans. 
---
I’m fine and see no need that all events should be geared with me on mind. This event is good for new players and helps them play longer.
---
I personally like my extremely non-optimal PA rifleman build, with a side of solar armor. Though lately, I’ve had to resort to sneaking...
---
Power armor frame is your safest bet. That will also protect you from log outs.  A safeguard as you describe it would not.
---
Thanks man. This is the kinda stuff players like me need lol
---
My understanding of the game is that the tasks got more difficult as you progressed through them rather than actual zones of the game being more difficult than others - that's definitely quite a change from the other games I think.
---
&gt;picking up the slack on minor bugs or projects from other studios by how it sounds.
---
Sounds to who?  Some flunkie on YouTube?  Where are you getting this from?
---
Perhaps you are just joining us, but we saw this exact same pattern in the months prior to Wastelanders.  The A-team is likely working on Fractured Steel while the B-team tides us over with content that does little more than buy time for A-team.
---
If you're still stuck next time you play I'll help you. I hate mirelurk kings they're stupidly powerful and its annoying when dont even drop good loot. I have many nuka grenades
---
While tons of people do play, I don’t understand how they’re reaching those numbers with the less than worthless rewards offered. Unless you’re a BoS fan there’s not much purpose to help them.
---
Same here.  I don't do Junkie's or Bloodied.  Everything else is on the table. I can see doing bloodied with a gunslinger build (weapon too weak otherwise) but haven't come across a good set of bloodied pistols to give it a try and VATS/Gun Fu are too buggy to make it enjoyable.
---
It’s a mutation that allows you to jump high. The easiest way is to just jump on top of a ledge that leads you straight to the wendigo, as he’s much weaker than the mirelurk kings
---
I always sell my valuables at a low, affordable price. But I’m always concerned that jackasses are flipping it for a profit. I mean, the cap limit is absurdly low and it’s easy to hit it. Why not? Who needs that much money?  
---
Then there’s that guy I saw buy my plans and legendaries for 100-250 caps selling all the same items at his camp for 1,000-25,000 caps. Fuck that guy
---
huh, I guess so. I was told by another more experienced player that you could not learn the mods and I just took as gospel. Learn something new every day. Thanks bud!
---
Well as usual with Bethesda patches we need to all be prepared to expect things to go bananas.
---
Anyway...best of luck y'all hope your games don't drop or lose frame rates.
---
If you're on PC I'll help ya dude.  I went a heavy gun build and tons of stims and meds and all buffed I run and gunned it.  I failed miserably for days then went back in a power armor suit weeks later with a better build and roflstomped it
---
Poor poor baby
---
Sometimes slow and steady is the better option. Look for better gear. Explore around a bit, do some events around your level, make sure you focus your build a bit. It’s ultimately a survival game. As you get to a higher level, you’ll find yourself going through things faster, and you’ll have to compensate for that unless you’ve got a great build for your character started early. Weapons are a big deal, and you don’t have access to all of them at your level, so keep poking around.
---
yeah, that too
---
They already have our money, but I think I'm done with 76 for awhile, maybe if they ever fix their shit. Delaying a big event several weeks only to add it to the game but not activate it for players just to show them that it works, and yet somehow breaking more stuff, it just baffles me how they seem to think that not talking to their player base, not fixing bugs that are seemingly game breaking for some people! I mean I've put time into the game and will probably be cancelling my 1st subscription!
---
What platform are you on?
---
Erlay.
---
I have 1 character that I played for the first year, and he has over 100 key cards from the Battle Bots event. I wish I had known you didn't need to loot them each time.
---
12 year olds need their boner juice
---
My advice would be to target events on the map that you see others attending as there is good xp from competing those which will help level faster. Forget the main missions for now.
---
At level 25 start work on obtaining the plans for and building a suit of excavator.power armor.  That will help your survivability.
---
This might help 
---
https://youtu.be/MSXrU2droE4
---
It’s tasty too!
---
Got double that or more meself.
---
Yeah, you can still get the boxes, but I have a booze collectron already, have pretty much all the plans and am at the cap limit, so I don't really get anything out of it, besides the satisfaction of helping people get a hatten.
---
So I can go back to tossing it on the ground like I usually do because even at 8% weight or whatever the 90% and 20% reducers work out to, it's still a pain in the butt to carry around.
---
vampire flamer combo with friendly fire. EVERYBODY HEALS!
---
If you’re on psn, I’ll run through it with ya.
---
They're removing the arc for it , they did in the pts but it went wrong in 21.
---
"So I'm a pvper and use Teslas cause they make it fun and easy " 
---
This is why it is removed of its arcing ability. Go aim bro
---
Well the issue is that enemies are leveled to the player.  That is say you need to get to uncanny caverns at level 24.  If no one has been there, the enemies will be leveled to you.  If my lvl 240 self wandered by before you though, they'll be leveled to me instead, and well beyond your capacity. 
---
It's been around for a while, but look at the level map and figure out where you can go.  Level up, gear up, and come back later.  It's really all you can do besides log out to menu and log back in, hoping the leveling goes off of you this time.
---
For some weird reason the mid-20s to late 30s are a a tiresome grind where you feel stuck in limbo between being over-powered in the forest and under-powered everywhere else.  But push through it, it evens out around 40, then you find a weapon or two that makes you over-powered.  It's weird.  In the meantime, join the new event groups and take advantage of their help in XP grinding.  High levels players generally won't mind - the understand.
---
Which items are you dropping?
---
Lag?
---
Your instance may have been caused by high level players in area spawning higher lvl enemies. Stay in the east half of map. Do events. If you have 1st take workshops and the events they trigger will level you up quickly. Lvls 10-40 or so can be grindy but after that you shouldn't have many problems. By 100 or so you'll be praying for more difficulty.
---
Very much this. 
---
I used Marsupial just the other day (paid 400 caps for it) just so I could complete this on my Ironman/ No deaths character and he is level... 38 at the time. 
---
Just once you clear the first two chambers after jumping up, no sneaking, he won’t trigger if you sneak in
---
There is an early to mid level grind that can be difficult, but once you hone in on a build style the later game content can become overly easy. 
---
From a build point of view I'll generally focus on one type of weapon, and avoid all QOL perks in favor of damage based perks for the weapon I've chosen to focus on. 
---
Once at level 60 I'll start integrating QOL perks again as my combat perks should all be in place. From there it's weapon and armor optimization, and quest completion.
---
Hop on this discord server and you can find someone to help you with that I bet.

---
When I was lower leveled a lovely 200+ leveled gentleman followed me around with a flamethrower and proceeded to kill me, find me after I revived and do it again. Even found me when I switched serves. So kind. But then after I called me a jerk and he heard I was a girl on the mic he gave me a decent gun and ammo. Have a feeling if I wasn’t a girl he would of just kept killing me though.
---
*Recall Cards* are used to summon the Sheepsquatch Imposter, for the Encryptid event. If you've never done it, it's fucking challenging.
---
Thank you, good sir!
---
The Camo sold in the atom shop uses the one sold in gold bullions. They don't work.
---
BuT mY gReNaDeS aNd AlCoHoL.
---
Buy three mining maps, it'll give you all the black titanium to craft a set. Power armor and two handed melee power attacks is easy mode until you get some useful legendaries.
---
Ah that explains it cause on PC I’ve seen the ark still works but on xbox it doesn’t show and can end up leading to 1 tap anything
---
Isn't it just 30% less XP from not having the +15 INT from full Unyielding?
---
It wasn’t until we all died that the kindness stopped... interesting food for thought.
---
This game will let low level players go places where low levels have a very difficult time surviving.  Once you hit L35 or so, things will get a bit easier, adn again at l50.
---
The is a marathon, not a sprint.  Slow down, go to Toxic Valley, which is more level appropriate for a 24.
---
Revisit the ash heap and the excavator mission in about 10 more levels.
---
  You can get black titanium from the L21 deathclaw at deathclaw island, the resource node at gorge junkyard, and lower level mole miners in the town of Monongah.  Sometimes server hopping at blackwater mine will give you L4’s instead of L40s (but not very often).
---
I often sell excess black titanium to bot vendors.
---
As to the other question , about 1200 hrs for me to get to L226
---
I wonder if they used magic guns...
---
hmm.  I think it is related to my tamed mega sloth!
---
Ah I'm on Xbox. Thank you though
---
It does not. I am using one.
---
Cork though?  Who would dupe cork?
---
This game was supposed to be shaped by the community. Y'all sure aren't listening very well or at least implementing the good suggestions.
---
The duper with the cork? No idea WHY they would, just know if they had it, they would.
---
Stop blaming the glorius brotherhood it's that scumbag cheapskate Russell Dorksy
---
Oh boo hoo.
---
That would be correct.
---
Just saying, maybe that's what is causing the bug? Why not just use the repair kit through your pip-boy, unless you're also modding? Extra steps is all, but you do you. Curiosity addressed :)
---
Atom shop paint items?
---
Bos =smart raiders
---
Probably around the same amount. Even running bloodied I rarely die. Plenty of perks to help negate incoming damage. As for armor, It's nots just unyeilding. There's also bolstering.
---
Yeah, the game doesn't really explain this and many, many people have come here complaining that Rose sent them off to do something that they weren't ready for (in fact there is another one of these posts on here today). You are meant to fully explore each area and do side quests and events in those areas. The game does get a little difficult in that 25-40 range because it starts pushing you to higher level areas where its a toss up whether you get enemies at your level or over-leveled for you.
---
I don’t understand that but ok
---
Junk/plans/ammo I dropped a loot bag about 10 minutes earlier at someone else’s camp then I went to use the ammo converter at my camp after I was done I was dropping stuff to reduce weight and nothing showed up I did it 7 times to make sure I wasn’t missing something
---
I knew I was forgetting something.
---
Are you at your camp? This happens to me all the time now if I drop items at my camp.
---
My lady wears the witch costume. I wish she had green skin. Oh and I am female.
---
Edit: I’m the one wearing the swim suit 😝
---
Fireproof 3 + dense do shit against flamer-type damage. Those goddamned flamer floaters still chew through FP3+dense armor like it was nothing. I'm wearing a full SS Unyielding set too, BTW.
---
So out of all of those the only thing that would work is bringing my PS4 to my boyfriend's house which is something I didn't think of, and that would totally work! Thank you!
---
I wish customers were this understanding of me at work imo
---
Instigating isn't ideal for an automatic, only the very first shot doubles. Instigating works much better on a powerful single shot weapon that you can stack with other perks and effects.
---
I fairly consistently sell at sightly below the middle of their price (so, if it says 3000-7000, 4500 will generally sell, at least for the high priced stuff). And what was the gamma gun? It is possible that, with very few of them being sold, a single big sale skewed the prices far too high.
---
I do low-ball smaller items. Can't buy a 3000 gun if you're too low to realistically have it, and if you do have it, you probably have a better weapon)
---
I'm on psn, BRADfromOZ, I'll run you through it.
---
Can someone fill me in? What is this fast travel bug?
---
Plastic is farmable, it would be really hard but doable.
---
Concrete is rarer and will likely fail unless a duper or some guy that spent the last year farming concrete for no reason does it for us.
---
Cork won't happen unless a duper or Bethesda does it.
---
Hate to say it but if they made it to where you could do it just by playing a few hours here and there, the community would absolutely lose their dang mind and complain and complain and complain over and over and over about how easy it was.
---
Yup it was at my camp but I also dropped stuff outside of the build area too and still no loot bag showed
---
Especially gold. Imo if you have the caps, you should be able to buy it lol I have to wait literally like 2 months to get my armor because theres never events anymore. They just barely show up
---
Well, can't blame you for that but I can definitely confirm that they are learnable! Though they might be rare unlocks so you never now but well I will be checking chainsaw spots regularly now until I can mod mine to suit my needs, though I can already get 5 damage per hit without any mod so that's a start
---
Was about to post the same question.  This has to be a pretty bad sign for Bethesda's long term commitment to the game, right?
---
Thanks for giving me the finger, Anon. :)
---
I did that for a long time too!  I don't miss it.  Unyielding just makes everything so much more enjoyable imho.  Leveling is a breeze, damage output is phenomenal, I can carry SO much more stuff, I can run for miles at high speed, and so on.  Oh, and the low health means there is occasionally a hint of actual challenge to the game.  But if you enjoy what you're doing instead, more power to you.
---
As someone with 1200 hrs on FO4, it was a mindset change when I started playing FO76. The enemies will scale to the players in the area, so if a high-level player was nearby, you’re seeing enemies that were spawning for them. Don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re probably too low level to be venturing into the lower and right-side parts of the map; the game is designed like FO4 in that enemies will be progressively more difficult as you venture from the upper left area of the map towards the south and east. You might want to level up to around lvl 40-50, as well as start to focus on a particular play style (melee, sniper, commando, etc) and acquire some appropriate “legendary” weapons (like 2-shot guns).  Yeah, it means you may have to take a break from the storyline &amp; side quests and just grind for XP, but it will pay off...
---
Are you on PC?
---
I'm on ps4 but thanks for the offer unless there is crossplay.
---
Ahhh right so that's why the event appears is because someone used a card? It is indeed but lucky for me I found someone selling a fixer plan in a vending machine so got lucky as I've never finished the event.
---
And the ability for it to snap to foundation's.
---
My PvP commando has no issues with them. Mostly because they’re taken out with a VE or BE laser rifle from a distance. My PvE melee character (FP3 and Asbestos) hates acid and cryo damage but shrugs off fire damage like it’s nothing. Maybe SS armor is bugged, because the melee uses heavy combat armor.
---
Stealth and headshots.
---
I started off the same way and feeling abandoned by my friend group because of the publicity the game received. After a few months I’m finally over lvl 200 and I find myself donating 25-50% of my resources and 100% of spare ammo when possible.
---
My favorite thing is dropping extra canned meat stew to help boost lower players XP gains and it’s non perishable. It’s even better when you get a friend request and boost them with a shared “inspirational” perk
---
My only problem is that I can see the team leaders quests anymore! It’s been that way since wastelanders dropped. Anyone else?
---
I love helping new players but some times I don't know what to do to help.
---
Being Bloodied is more than the weapon. If you still have Adrenal reaction, you're still below 50% (esp 30-20%HP), you're still "Bloodied". 
---
I'm 20% Bloodied and my current main weapon is a Junkies Primed Ultracite Gatling Laser.
---
Events, especially ones like Radiation Rumble and Line in the Sand have alot of enemies that spawn.
---
If you can tag them by dealing damage to the enemies, you'll still get exp when they die, even if you didn't kill them.
---
I've been occasionally having my lower level alt join events and get exp that way.
---
It's gone from level 10 to 30 basically doing the daily reputation quest for Settlers and any events that pop up while I do they daily.
---
ItS sO sKiMpY!
---
That's 100% valid and absolutely a concern I share - bloodied builds outclass everything else by ridiculous margins, and if the devs are all playing it, it doesn't bode well for future content. It was very telling that not a single other build was present.
---
This game is absolutely not balanced for 90% of builds, and I hope they eventually give us some buffs, I was just pointing out that it is totally not required to stick to the meta to play the game if you hate that playstyle (which I do, I'm normally full stealth sniper in any game, shotgun/AP+ is a new frontier for me)
---
I guess we'll see how future events go. It may just mean making a second character to enjoy new events so I don't have to mess with my main build. :(
---
Let's not talk about how they were all Bloodied therefore it'll never be brought more in line with other builds, ironically they all got wiped cause if it, the Fast Travel bug hit u/ladydevann and she looked like she was going to die, and oh the reward was complete and utter shit.
---
Same here dude. Sending a report ticket today. Kind of super mad. It’s pretty obvious what happened here though. The backpacks were sinking into players backs, they fixed that (still not the nuka cooler backpack tho) and this backpack was obviously made and tested back before that bug was fixed... aka they broke this backpack the day they released it. And they tested it and made it jut out too far to account for the sinking into your back bug... Jesus Christ
---
I just recently had the monster mask glitch, first time I ever played the event.  Logging out fixed it.
---
Regarding the other issue, I found playing the game during ANY of the reset times (10am, 6pm, smiley gold bullion reset - mountain time for my location) pretty consistently causes problems.  So I just make sure I'm off at those times.  A pain to have to play a game that way, but until they fix it, it is just easier.
---
*Instigating gang*, ***RISE UP!***
---
wouldn't it be easier to have end game fights if minimized to 8  players run on one of the players private servers almost ?
---
Imo it is a lot easier to learn how to install mods than it is to scroll through the terrible ui
---
Probably. Did you actually go to both locations and the quest didn’t trigger? If it doesn’t at 8 then I have no clue. Maybe sent a ticket in.
---
Quad ffr I forget the last star.
---
So get a bunch of stealth boys and suppressed weapons? I could go around the second king and assassinate the progenitor buy ballistic or boot
---
I enjoy it, actually. It's a high risk high reward build where, if you fuck up, you die. Mind you, I don't have a broken one-shotting legacy weapon of doom I picked up from a duper. Just a pain bloodied Gauss Rifle, unyielding gear, a jet pack, and a very clenched sphincter whenever I go from hidden to caution without knowing why.
---
I enjoy playing the game where I am more threatened by ghouls than super mutants.
---
Junkies does well enough on its own, especially since high fire rate junkies guns are essentially magic weapons. What needs buffs are other legendary effects. Change Mutant's to gain +10% damage per mutation, max 5 mutations. Change Nocturnal to not lose damage in the daytime. If Vanguard is the full health version of Bolstering, then we should have a full health version of Unyielding.
---
yeah they suggested viewers to join the PTS to be able to play Colossal problem too
---
How can buy it, thought mutations just came from excess rads?
---
Yeah thank goodness they thought of the new players when they made this event, wouldn't want them running out of booze while they pick up all the plans the level 100+ folks are dropping
---
You have not played fallout 76...
---
PC - hence the crash haha
---
Lol rly, females have so many outfits that are built specifically for their bodies and almost every male focused costume has a totally different female reskin for it(Grognak costumes), but someone sees a belly button and everyone’s sexist and horny haha
---
- There are 0 important Notes
---
- There is 1 important Holotape (*Missile Silo State*)
---
Ran into it a bunch
---
No when they made and tested this one they accounted for that bug, by making it jut out too far(cuz backpacks were sinking).I’m sure it would have looked fine if we still had the bug. I can’t understand why you would change its positioning to try and account for a bug you were going to release at the same time as the backpack
---
I did go to the locations and talked with all NPCs who can give a daily just to be sure and as I said it's "wastelander-dailys" so the one I get from my camp-companion as well as photo-opportunity didn't trigger either. I didn't focus on the wastelander-dailys aspekt in the post as I had yet to check them all.
---
I will try again tomorrow and send in a ticket if it doesn't work by then
---
True in real life too, tbh.
---
I’d hope it is a section in the pipboy next to status and effects where you can rename and save builds as they are set. Then select like an armor piece or weapon. I really hope we are not limited to just 3 or 5 tho
---
Ah damn
---
One - fastest downvoting on a post of mine ever - I'm impressed with the push back, and Two - sexism isn't politics, just like racism, homophobia, xenophobia, fatphobia, etc.  Just because it takes place in a game, doesn't make it right.  The fact you don't get that proves the point of my post.  Downvoted all you want - it doesn't change anything.
---
Yeah I know, and technically that’s just low health build. Bloodied is bloodied because of bloodied weapons. Without the weapon you’re just a low health junky or whatever prefix you choose to use. And that’s what I meant by using any other weapon even if you’re not specced for it because adrenal reaction and nerd rage will take care of the rest for you. My favorite weapon right now is a mutants explosive lmg with all the low health jazz.
---
I incidentally was visiting the sub-reddit and saw this thread. It sounded like an awesome idea (I don't see many camp games especially) so I just had to check it out. You did a great job! And most importantly, people were surprised, enjoying it and having an interesting and unexpected experience. This is exactly what the game (and camping) needs right now. I hope you'll continue building these types of things! Good stuff!
---
that it is!
---
just realistic. Women have a lot more variety in style than men.
---
No, stacks of keys still count as 1 key.
---
The only ones that you absolutely don't want to pick up more of are the Battle Bot keycards, as they don't stack.
---
Well I guess it will be gone tomorrow then and well I don't know what you mean with the reset times, was it just recently? It's 11pm where I live right now and I didn't really check, just got on at 10pm
---
Hi. Is she in one of the houses/shacks - generally - or just wandering around the area? I want to try and find her.
---
Yup I’ve got my alts and my level 20 is about mole miner level. Super mutants scare him.
---
There's been a mod manager for PC just for 76 for a while that works for most available mods. I made a pinned post in our Discord that's just 6 steps, two of which are just making a mods folder and installing 7zip.
---
I'll never understand why people are in such a hurry to complete missions. This game has so much more to offer.
---
I didn't say it was sexist.  I just wish I had more options than tee-shirt + jeans/sweatpants.
---
The game is easy enough for almost *any* half-sane build to be "viable".  But I get what you mean.
---
Really wish the game had more than 2 viable builds, and builds that do something other than boost damage.
---
Be glad thats all you've seen.  I've seen some mighty creepy camps out there.
---
Is it alright if she has a sack hood on?
---
There's a lot of stuff promised this update that hasn't happened along with even more bugs
---
What system are you?
---
E: Shoot, PC. I am xbox and would put you together a care package, if you were too. Can our PC community come together?
---
No, I'd prefer them incorporate this and get the UI into the 21st century
---
I know right? It's like no one realizes Gramps has a hot bod to show off too.
---
Because Sofia knows that she's a sexy mf and likes to flaunt it boyyyyyy take that puritan bs somewhere else
---
What exactly would you dupe cork for
---
Ah yes.  I agree with you.
---
Eh, bloodied heavygunner, formerly bloodied melee. Zero stealth outside of what I get from the Unyielding AGI boost, and I only use that very rarely. 
---
Used to run up to dudes and swing till they're dead, now I get up a safe distance, spin up my gatling laser, and shoot in controlled bursts. I just weave about to avoid gunfire, or stim when I'm getting shot a lot.
---
Im pretty sure theur punch troughs are filled with the blood of their sacrifices.. but yah.. koolaid! Sure! Now in High protein!
---
I’m In the same boat yo.
---
Family man,2 kids,full time job &amp; odd jobs some nights if the pays right.
---
Wanted a few different items outta the run,&amp; I’m nowhere close.
---
But I came to the very same realization just the other day,&amp; I’m cool with it.
---
I’m hopin they come down the pipeline again at some point,possibly Atom shop or w/e,
---
but I don’t wanna NOT enjoy the time I DO get to play,as I’ve met a great bunch of people Ingame,&amp; when I get the chance to link up...
---
I want it to be ENJOYABLE.
---
So I said F the grind,I’ll get what I get.
---
Luckily most of the people I met up recently wit are also parents,who understand this RL come first deal,&amp; are usually of the same mindset.
---
We get on &amp; bang around when we can,&amp; do our RL’s accordingly.
---
I honesty still haven’t had the chance to really dig into Wastelanders that much,inoculated the 2 factions &amp; that’s where I’m at,cause when I do get on,I “usually” have a friend that wants to get up &amp; bang some ish out,so I tell myself,
---
All In due time.
---
I had been wanting something like 76 ever since I was playing &amp; building In FO4,a game where I can chill wit other players In the Wastes,&amp; show em my builds &amp; stuff.
---
While the game has its bugs,name a Bethesda game that doesn’t.
---
I’m grateful for the community,&amp; the developers even though the F things up sometimes.
---
Trail &amp; error I s’pose
---
Regardless I’m happy to play now would be the long &amp; short of it,&amp; I’m happy you play to.
---
Everybody stay blessed &amp; healthy,&amp; hope to see ya out there.
---
Sorry for the rant as well,was gonna be a quick post,but I just steamrolled apparently.
---
Much Love ya’ll
---
Quick edit &amp; then I’ll shutup:
---
but even the atom shop stuff annoys me some times,like the junk walls being in a bundle,cause boy would I like them junk walls,but I’ve no interest in the rest of the bundle,so again,hopefully they’ll release em standalone at some point,&amp; until then...
---
I’ll enjoy everyone else’s creative ass CAMPS &amp; take inspiration for when I do aquire em on my own terms,Lol
---
I wonder if any of them has reddit (or even an acc on their forum) and if yes why they only let the two/three CMs run around instead of bringing full on communication like they promised. Having a Lead designer or designer in general explain how they intended X or how they fixed something like that and modders potentially offering direct help to those people could really help improving the game.
---
Thanks a lot for this tip. I just spent an hour or so at Poseidon and now I've got 13 or so fusion cores.
---
- Better Inventory
---
- IconSortingTags / Kit's Killer Strings
---
In the vending machines, there's only text, you can't see the items in 3D like in your inventory.
---
Why does this post have awards
---
Thanks. Not ready rn but will keep you in mind when ready.
---
Yeah pretty much. Make sure it's something accurate
---
I would put money down that 76 will be kept on life support until literally the day the trailer drops for Fallout 5.
---
" If you were having server issues you'd be experiencing issues related to connectivity like rubber banding, lagging or disconnects. "
---
That is what is happening, did you read my post?
---
I was a stress tester from the start and am now just hitting level 50 the only kind thing that has happened to me is players dropping animal wall head plans they don’t need and I can barley do anything with what I have, I’m done and am not getting another fallout game until other people play it
---
How come for some people they could see them¿
---
Thanks, not ready rn but will keep you in mind for when I'm ready
---
I AM BECOME DEATH
---
Welcome. I think it can be boiled down to a visual glitch.
---
Sorry, the bugs in this game can get so frustrating sometimes.
---
TBH there aren't enough mods to even warrant a mod manager. I do it all manual
---
The link doesn’t work if you put it in the title.
---
Ill be on at 5 pm
---
It would be my honor as a 1st responder to assist you however i may!
---
Psn egroegy
---
Weird. Maybe the last time you played was prior to 8pm and it needs to see 8pm roll over. That one I don’t know honestly, because I’m still on everyday. Hopefully it’s a simple thing and sorts itself out.
---
I was just about to make a post myself I didn't play during the time this was a thing but today while I was playing I had this happen to me on almost every enemy using unarmed/black powder rifle, that#s a huge problem as my build is based upon big damage one-shots.
---
Damn ok...chill out... I'm sorry i didn't know?...
---
This was bad for me prior to the most recent patch.  It's been much much better for me ever since.
---
Dude this is awesome
---
First of all, you just called a big part of this community sexist, mysoginistic etc, just cause their non real game character wears swimsuit. Second of all, everything is politics nowadays, big companies and politicians using BLM, sexism, feminism and everything else for their own agenda, and with the likes of you, who just likes to come here with accusations, they’re succeeding. You’re ain’t right. It’s a game. No drama here, nothing. Deal with it and move on.
---
A Colossal Problem isn't a "big event," and it's time people stop thinking that. It's a new boss battle being added to the game, and once it's here, it's here.
---
You can play however you want. I'm talking about people who cry there are too many bloodied builds. It's ridiculous what makes people mad these days.
---
The community hit 97.6% of the goal at the two-thirds mark. 
---
I think we’ll be good, especially since we were notified ahead of time what the materials would be. And all of them are common and easy to farm.
---
Hey BradfromOz Egroegy here. :) i like helping newer appalachians too.
---
It seems that for a lot of people the same quest has been broken after bethesda introduced the legendary run. I'd either server hop a few times or report it to bethesda, though i have no idea why it hasn't been fixed yet.
---
Thanks. I'll need to recover and restock but I'll give you a shout when I'll be ready
---
get a troubleshooters weapon and plug em in the leg.. tshooters armor piece wouldnt hurt either..
---
Thanks.  Fixed.  Sorta (since ya can't edit titles).
---
If it works I’d be up for trying it out. The trade system we have doesn’t cut it.
---
I may have rushed through too much so I'm level 11 trying to kill the Wendigo for the key fragments.... Gonna go level up a bit hahaha
---
Well as I said it shouldn't really matter if it was before or after 8pm est the last time as I was not on for 3 days, this being the fourth and yeah I also hope that it'll just sort itself out. But I might just need to sent a ticket. 
---
Thanks for your reply anyway
---
Sometimes, when people go to fast travel the have to select the location... TWICE! *gasp*
---
Thanks for sharing.  I also have not had time to grind out the new content and with Seasons, I just didn’t have any time to spare. I’m looking forward to being able to actually finish Wastelanders as well.
---
I’ve seen so many complaints about that quest. It seems like an exciting time until you actually get there lmao.
---
The mole miners have taken me as one of their own. As a representative they ask if you all would kindly stop killing them for their few caps... it's all they have left...thank you.
---
Then why are some (a lot) in their underwear or the swimsuit? Personally I have Beckett in the nurses outfit and he looks amazing.
---
What loot bag are you using? I seem to remember an issue with the paratrooper bag clipping through things.
---
Pro tip: anyone who can run you through can supply you with some decent gear/fixes. When i said im happy to help i mean w/e. Im a junk hoarder and teammate by nature. Never killed a player, never stolen a steel scrap. I got very lucky falling in with the right group when i started. They had one motto. Pay it forward
---
I’m sorry to hear that friend. It’s causing me to have to make a brand new character and I’m extremely poor in this game so a new character ain’t no easy thing. But, I’d rather enjoy myself and be able to rely on my damage than have to worry about running out of bullets pumping three and four shots into things that should die in just one. 
---
I don’t know the source of this wether it is a patch bug or server latency issues caused by the patch or that it’s always around and it’s just more consistent now or what, those semantics don’t matter to me. What matters is that I wasn’t having this problem for quite some time and now I am having it consistently and I am sorry so many of you are too. Here’s to hoping it gets resolved, however that happens, soon.
---
Glad it helped, those power plants are a game changer for PA!
---
How long is colossal problem happening for?
---
Jokes on you, I have two bulk cork. For no reason but to sell it later.
---
2 pieces Poison Resistance armor negates nearly all poison damage except for maybe the Mirelurk Queen. Serendipity negates at least 45% damage outright, Ricochet can negate another 6-18%. That's up to 63% of attacks completely missing you.
---
The damage that _does_ get through, gets reduced 30% by Blocker, 30% by Dodgy, 45% by Sent gear*, 30% by Suppressor, and 25% by Empath (33% damage reduction, 8% damage increase in team) with Strange in Numbers and Class Freak 3. 
---
I also boost max HP with Cranberry Meatball Grinder to increase my possible 20% HP from 40 to around 70.
---
Bloodied run-and-gun is _extremely_ doable if you have the right damage mitigation perks.
---
**clarification: each Sentinel piece reduces damage by 15% 75% of the time as long as you don't move. I have 3 sent pieces because I'm reserving the last two slots for Acrobat*
---
Level 325 here right now and I always price my guns / armour on a simple system that been.
---
1* - 250 caps no matter what it is
---
2* - 500 caps also no matter what it is...
---
3* - 750 caps because I don't need the pixels in my stash weight..
---
And all my plans no matter what it is all got in at 25 caps.. I'd rather help people then out price everything on my vendor I hope those prices are affordable to most people by the time they hit the whitespring
---
🤘
---
I agree. And I do really enjoy the new life the updates have brought back into the game.  I’m not bitter, but I had to remind myself that this is the way things are with the games new direction.
---
Really glad people like it, thanks!
---
The majority of events seems to be run by their Austrailian players. Everything on Sunday is super early in the morning for us Americans :P
---
Its a bold move for them to stream when game literally flooded with bugs. Well, if they actually played the game before they would know that.
---
I don't care that people play bloodied builds, I just wish there were more things for me to choose from than bloodied or junkie's that weren't terrible.
---
Boooo!! Hiss!! Wasting our time with another generic bitchfit.
---
I've had a little luck on some items. I'm on XB1. I know the RNG is different on every version.
---
Surprisingly buff for an old dude.
---
Why no junkie? There is next to no negative side if get the right addictions and the damage is nuts.
---
Thanks man! You started it all :D Likewise hoping to see your next masterpiece!
---
I’ve seen just underwear and the prisoner collar.
---
I've had it happen as much as 8 times....
---
Average is 3
---
Yeah I didn’t know the exact instrument so didn’t want to be told ‘uh it’s actually xyz’ can see how it doesn’t make sense 🤣
---
First time I’ve experienced it was today
---
No I'm the guy that doesn't need to buy legacies because I have legit ones. And I have more than one character so I can use the fixers I don't need to sell them. Caps don't interest me much.
---
So is this intentional?
---
But wouldn't it be nice if the price of that wasn't intentionally gimping yourself to a fraction of the damage the others are doing?
---
Or they just didn't get that desperate...
---
Trying to get these both going right now... Better inventory doesn't seem to be loading (I used Vortex... probably should look up how and do manual install).
---
Haven't tried the IconTags yet. Saw that one, too.
---
How do you install your mods?
---
My girlfriend was in there and managed to solve it and not die. I wasn't sure at first if yours was the house she was excitedly talking about, but I showed her the video and said "that's it!". She said she sent you a message thanking you, and even now saying how awesome the experience was.
---
Nearly 300 hours in and I'm still learning new stuff about the game. Even "where can you get fusion cores?" Google searches just brought up locations of drops and power armour. Nothing I searched brought back results of "there are literally machines that make fusion cores" responses.
---
Yeah I am really happy to confirm this, it's the first time I am encountering it though, I really hope it won't be ignored for too long as I don't have any other characters or the motivation to make an entirely new one.
---
Not at all. Obnoxious/amusing? Yes.
---
If the reward hadn't been a rolling pin then people would have cried that it was cheated to make it look better. Its a lose-lose.
---
It's not ready for testing yet.This is how it looks right now: [https://prnt.sc/tvynvg](https://prnt.sc/tvynvg) (some fields needs to be hidden)
---
Basically, just API is done, nothing related to UI, yet.
---
Ah yes - just found it! Thanks!!
---
My favorite is the one shot kill without vats and the full clip kill with vats (health regen)
---
You ever find a fix for this? Take thing happens to me. I've found her 5 times, just dialog no plans.
---
My Wanderer wears a hunters long coat and black cowboy hat so its not all of us but there are a lot of them ill give u that
---
same error here, for fucks sake the game is two years old and an early game quest is still bugged how the fucking fuck
---
Vault Tec loot bag then I changed it to a guts loot bag and still nothing
---
i wish this happened to me i had my boyfriend play with me one time to try and get him into the game and i ended up just getting harassed by these two people in chefs hats 🥺
---
we were both level 5 &amp; 7 and were primarily using melee they shot us down at level 34 ...
---
You should be one shotting everything with even just a non bloodied plain Jane gauss rifle if you have adrenal reaction and nerd rage. Especially if you’re sneaking there should be no contest with any enemies with any gun except for queen mobs. If I can sneak around one shotting most enemies with a pipe rifle running a low health(bloodied) build, your bloodied gauss rifle might as well be a legacy weapon of doom. Basically what I’m saying is a bloodied gauss rifle ain’t nothin to scoff at, it’s a pretty deadly weapon even without the prefix.
---
But bloodied unyielding with serendipity and dodgy is tankier than most full health builds
---
They’re really only geared towards new people who weren’t around for the Christmas presents or mole miner pails. And by that, I mean new enough that they’d have trouble even donating 250 steel. Way to go Bethesda, a “colossal” failure.
---
Your junk weighs less when bulked. Not a lot less, but noticeably less when you have a lot of it. For example, say “item x” weighs .2 lbs. Ten of them would weigh 2 lbs. Then it takes ten pieces of x to make one bulk so you do that and now “bulk item x” weighs 1.5 lbs.
---
There's a difference between playable and ready for consumers
---
people with LOTS of steel.
---
Trust me I felt the same way lol. I thought it was a lost cause till someone posted that thread lol.
---
You're welcome.
---
Since day one, my 'unstoppable monster' with radicool has always beat ANY other combo, damagewise, by a country mile.  I agree itd be nice to have that kind of power in ANY other kind of build, but alas here we are.
---
I'm pretty sure I got a 3\* drop from the SE event yesterday (not looting the queen--auto added to inventory by event). u/eckserah could probably confirm the latest odds.
---
I will say though, I do between 2,7-13k dmg and had been for some time and I have never encountered the bug until today (my first session after the patch) but I should also add that I have, as many others also reported, been getting insane lag spikes as of late, which might be causing it somehow.
---
Sure. I love a good handy j.
---
I've played the game since the beginning, and I've NEVER seen them. I thought it was a normal thing, now you made me doubt
---
Especially explosive ones.
---
I’ve had this happen a few times as well.
---
Only melee damage
---
Where I see your point, I'm a firm believer that the weapons and armor should*  be linear. Certain things shouldn't even be in the lvl 50+ loot/reward pool. I understand RNG but this RNG is a fucking joke.
---
Okay
---
Did anybody else not realize this was a ploy to find the dupers with really high amounts of junk that has been duped just for this occasion?
---
Ooof. Well played.
---
It is just too bad that Private Servers don't allow persistent ownership of Workshops.
---
No, the Bloodied build is because of the synergy of low health mutations, perks, and weapons. The name for the build back in Fallout 4 was "The Incredible Hulk" Build, because it relied on getting the damage bonus and tankiness from Nerd Rage. 
---
If you're low health, have adrenal reaction, you can carry an instigating gun, a junkies gun, or a bloodied gun, it's still teh same: you're "Bloodied", aka low health, high damage build.
---
UNY doesn’t increase def/hp and dodgy is a skill anyone should be using though. And as a bloodied, I can guarantee I take way more dmg than even my full ho sniper friends. If you ever want to find the bloodied builds, just play encrypted.
---
Keep in mind steel is the easiest resource to obtain in this game. One glitched line in the sand will yield something like 2500 steel if using unyielding and scrapper. The steel goal was never really going to be an issue, backlash or not. Cork on the other hand may be difficult...
---
I have nine characters across two accounts.  I, too, like leveling up new characters.  I enjoy using my knowledge of the game to be more efficient than last time.
---
Enjoy being a self-entiltlled pick.
---
Well never said it was free, actually I'm sure it'll cost some sort of in game currency but i dont know if I see it costing actual money. Clarified: I can see them charging real buckaroos for it honestly, but I have some actual high doubts about that happening
---
This is an easy thing to say but a kind of hard thing to implement, especially in a game like FO76 where player power levels are extremely varied.  Bloodied players will one-shot mobs before others can tag, so metrics like damage dealt and mobs killed may exclude people who were trying but were constantly one-upped.  In other games, healer/support players often get screwed even though they play an important role (so many times I got Silver rank in FFXIV because I play SCH and not a tank).  I'd rather it be certain that all players get rewards, even if it means AFK'ers get it too, rather than risk an active player missing out because people around them were just more capable/jerks.
---
It’s ambitious. But it something I could see people using. A trade hub that’s searchable would be amazing and is quite needed.
---
When Fallout 76 was designed and released (such as it was), Bethesda predicted that we'd all be psychopaths, and we all proved them wrong *so hard* that they had to change the whole game because of it!
---
My earliest memories, too, are of high-level players helping me out. I must've been level 10 at most, dutifully building the most complicated camp I could with the sparse plans available to me, near the covered bridge that led to the Overseer's Camp (before the stupid pub stole my stupid place damn it). A couple of level 100+s stood and watched me for a bit, and I expected the worst (this was before pacifist mode), but instead they ran over, gave me a thumbs-up, and dumped a bunch of camp plans at my feet, before beckoning me to follow them and see their own camp creation (which was awesome!) not far away.
---
I never got the chance to repay their kindness, but I always tried to pass it on. And isn't that what the human condition is all about, at the end of the day?
---
Do you not understand the terms you're using here or what?  FPS loss and the game freezing up aren't connectivity issues.

---
Tl;dr?  You're not describing network issues, you're describing a problem with your system itself.
---
The ONLY time you would experience FPS loss in a game and could attribute it to a server issue is if you're streaming the fucking thing like whatever Google's failure of a gaming platform is.
---
Lol, it’s Cause I searched up videos and some people are able to see them
---
Great just what I needed another anixety attack from what was once my shining light in a otherwise dim world.(Fallout was my favorite series along side Elder scrolls.)
---
As far as I know non-vats shotguns still do extremely bad damage, the reason they are viable right now is because they often cause what has been dubbed "magic-damage" when used in vats, which allows you to one-shot a lot of things. But feel free to correct me if I am wrong, haven't used them in a while.

My female ally wears the regular grognak outfit and a prisoner collar.

Reminds me of this one time I took the airport workshop to farm water for caps (I was lvl 30 or so) and this guy lvl 200 something kept killing me got my mic and said I was just tying to make some caps he said that’s cool I thought he left but really he had a stealth boy hid somewhere I could see him and as soon as I retook the workshop he kills me.
---
I'm name mine mr. Handie for a day j4u.
---
if the trader spawns she'll be inside lost home itself. You can usually hear her talking. She could be tinkering with the power armour or sitting down. 
---
It's a random encounter area so it could be blood eagles, robots, super mutants and their pet floater, a bear, dead cultists, 2 different lots of talking settlers, or one of the camp allies.
---
Thank you !
---
I'll try to make a combat armor piece and dense it up to confirm, but I suspect the results will be the same: flamer floater chews through what little HP I have like it was nothing.
---
I have zero fear from the acid one because I have two Poison Resistance pieces.
---
So many of the prefix's make this so weird lol
---
Raiders with hygiene.
---
Less about not getting a plan and more about getting recycled plans from prior events. The plans that are dropping are the same ones that were duped en masse not long ago, and much of the player base already have them. Plans were dumped by the hundreds and the public servers were literally littered with them.
---
I've been doing my score chores every night and the only breaks I have taken were skipping a few NW ones. I've recently demoted my fallout 76 gameplay off my big screen TV down to my computer monitor and I play while I watch TV. Running around doing challenges doesn't really require full attention anyway so this has made it a little more tolerable for now. 
---
I'm taking the weekend off and getting out of town. I'll have to see what kind of withdrawal I suffer through knowing my chores miss me so. I'm mostly looking forward to finishing the legendary run just so I can have a few days off.
---
So it's not the skin per se, it's something else in the ash pile. That sucks.
---
That's the best part! You could get a double handie if you tried!
---
I know this was what happened in fo4, but didn't play any other fallout games before that.
---
1) Steel is super easy to come by. Just doing Line in the Sand can get you easily 2K minimum. 
---
2) A vocal minority of this small subreddit was saying they weren’t going to do it
---
3) This subreddit does not, has not, and never will represent the full player base to any degree.
---
These are human rights - not political.  If people use them as political weapon that's their own fault and we let them get away with it.  Those who don't see this as an issue most likely don't deal with the Fallout of living in misogynistic societies.   
---
You are right about one thing - it is only a game.  But to some people it is a safe haven from a more hostile world - an escape.  And to immediately dismiss any idea of this kind of thing not being influenced by sexism in this way is part of the problem.  It's like giving a free pass to people who harass gay people in games, throwing slurs and threats.
---
The funny thing is, my original post was actually just intended in part to be lightly humorous, but your flippant response and the downvoting made me realise that SOME people on this sub have some growing up to do.
---
Heavy spiked rocket
---
+15 agility with dodgy DEFINITELY makes you tankier. Having a 45% chance to avoid one-shots is a massive boost too. Being able to stay in stealth for much longer before getting attacked factors in. Dealing multiple times the damage of another build makes it far less likely that you even get attacked in the first place. Then you tack on nerd rage that boosts all of those important things: damage resistance, damage, ap regen. Playing bloodied unyielding makes the game a joke, there's a reason even the dev panel today was full of bloodied. They couldn't afford taking risks while live on the panel
---
A lot of players have joined recently and these plans are all new to them.
---
Eh, I think we’re both right and I don’t feel like getting too technical. If I’m low health with a junkies gun but I don’t own a bloodied weapon or intend to ever own one am I really a bloodied build? I would just call it a low health junkies build that’s what other people call it. It’s a junkies using the benefits of a bloodied build or conversely a bloodied build using the benefits of a junkies weapon if they have the addictions. To me it goes both ways I just don’t like calling a build bloodied unless it’s wielding a bloodied weapon.
---
And the vast majority of the people who play this game are not in this reddit.
---
You can buy both the serum recipie and the mutation serum itself from a vender near the end of the main game quest in a bunker. Players also sell both, don't spend more than 300-400 on the serum itsel from a player, and make sure you have starched genes so it doesnt disappear with rad away. 
---
If your xbox, i can make any serum for you, but your PS4, damn.
---
I swear it seems like VATs got even worse for me
---
This is one of the reasons I hate the idea of seasons. It makes people do things other than just enjoy the game.
---
I believe your right. I thought they explained they had developed their own structure to have more "Freedom"
---
Also I'm level 43, who are these weapons meant for if not the people who picked up the game in the last couple months? No regrets that a level 250+ can't get another weapon to add to their collection. I have 2 legendary weapons that I actually use and one level 30 legendary leg armor lol
---
People will really get upset at anything hey?
---
When you craft the secret service, foundation, and raider weapons/armor it consumes legendary modules for a random legendary. I went through a lot to make my bloodied secret service armor, the arms are both one stars.
---
I got direct3D crashed once since patch 21. It was.. surprising. After that i updated system and no crashes anymore.
---
No you can't do the same damage. Bloodied has access to all the same food chem and other buffs you do as well as bloodied, nerd rage, and adrenal. As well as the stat boost from Unyielding. It really is on a whole different level than anything else in game.
---
I should just make another account already. 5 slots aint enough for a main, mule, and every other type of character and build there is to mess with. Nine characters though, impressive. Its nice to have multiple characters so the majority of weapons you find can be used with a toon instead of just trash
---
This reminds me of that Anthem stream
---
It's not me being a nice guy.  I just have so much crap and I want it gone now, but my pack rat nature makes me incapable of just throwing it away.
---
No idea if i helped you or not, no idea if we are even on the same platform, but you are very welcome :D
---
I got a handy from mumbles once. It was terrible.
---
For using the medic's prefix- build a vats character, use shotguns. You need to build crit points fast , because the crit hit heals you and nearby teammates. Shotguns work best for this because of the pellets. Each pellet adds to your crit bar, then when you trigger a crit, each pellet heals you and nearby teammates. To go whole hog, put points in charisma, there are a bunch of medic/support perks to maximize your efforts( health or AP regen when you stim a downed player ect.) Note: don't run with the perk that removes all rads on the player you're stabbing, bloodied builds need their rads to stay effective.
---
I feel ya, I always had high level players giving me plans and making ne weapons and armor and everything to help me survive. One actually did a ton of missions with me to help level me up
---
You're awesome, thank you. I've been playing forever.. doing dailies FOREVER and it still hasn't dropped.. I feel like that is pretty not cool.
---
Science here. Well observed.
---
They didn't "announce" it, they tucked in quietly into the patch notes.
---
It was partly because there used to be a limit to the length of the archive lines in the ini, so it combined them into a few ba2 archives.
---
Im glad there streaming it. That proves there actually dealing with the bs we deal with on a daily bases. Even if its just a couple times. They need to learn that this is not a functionable game.
---
My biggest hardship with this game =(
---
Fallout since 2008 (my first game) has been teaching me to hoard literally everything I can see. Imagine my surprise when I found out you have a stash limit AND it's fairly low!
---
Finally,Someone with the guts to h-AHHHHHHH
---
The last ally I saw without clothes was the (male) raider ally. All he had on was a slave collar. As for the swimsuit, idk why anyone would even want that, as it’s not flattering and there are better looking outfits than it. 
---
My primary point being to one of the original posts equating this to sexism. A horny kid doesn’t mean sexism. And Bethesda has offered a large variety of outfits, which have have been pretty modest throughout the fallout series, it’s just usually easier to notice the skimpier ones because the settler in overalls doesn’t really draw your attention. I personally have seen more people going for campy/funny costumes
---
I’ve tried this. Never worked for me, how do you trigger the bait to explode?
---
Yeah we have to donate more cork then steel but how the fuck do you get cork? I have about 100 cork in my stash but I don't even know in what kind of junk you can get cork.
---
All the fixes? Can't get it right for us, you think they can for themselves?
---
“For queen and country, I’ll get the Deathclaw meat myself!”

I cannot see anything in vendors.

3 stars is the best she can do

If you "inspect" the website (I'm using Chrome, just right clicked on the progress bar and chose "inspect") you'll see the real number. For me right now it says "212.34m". There's a number above it that says 169% which also looks right (169% is 211.25m, 170% is 212.5m)
---
uff.. another hater found. 
---
\-  and how critical steel is to maintaining ammo production 
---
only a noob could write such bullshit.
---
I get it, it may not be the biggest event, but they advertised for it, used it in their marketing for the game. To me that makes it seem pretty big, the community has been hyped for this event for awhile now!
---
Chaotic neutral is a respectable position (IMHO). It's honest, it's not malicious ... you run off respect, not fear. A 10 year old can inspire fear with an Uzi. it takes an awareness of yourself to get (not demand) respect.
---
I am also competitive, but i had to learn humility. I have always like d the expression "I don't lose. I either win or learn from my mistakes".
---
So you build the item and it comes out legendary?
---
-takes one shot at the collosus- fuck... back to base damage... kidding of course I love different builds, its hard to pull away from the meta though.
---
My interest in explosive shotguns evaporated once they nerfed the Enforcer perk's synergy with them.
---
I think it works now which is an improvement
---
The people who only want to do 5 can do 5. Why should I have to miss out?

Modding scrip armor with an ultralight mod had me saving cork pretty much since the Purveyor wandered into Appalachia.
---
This must be it! He must be tired of only having radstag to work with
---
Handy McRifle is my only companion
---
This is my go-to when at the big events. It's great fun but super ammo hungry.  I know they fixed fuel crafting from what it was but I would love another ammo bump cause it's still limited use.
---
Many melee mods are obnoxiously rare. If it makes you feel better, my level 356 main has over a thousand hours in the game and I'm still at 5/8 for the sledgehammer
---
Laying LOTS of pipe
---
And good news - we're still getting it! And the fact they're taking extra time means it's big deal to them too!
---
Two of my characters are just low level (15ish) mules.  Another two characters are nearly level 300 and have full ally status with both factions.  Other characters are between level 100-200, I have no interest in farming ally status with them, haha.  
---
It’s funny to me, on my first character I struggled so much with keeping my armor repaired and updated, etc.  These days a level 45 character still has level 15 armor because I keep thinking it isn’t worth the effort....I’ll be level 50 in a couple more hours, lol.  I’m sure we’ve both learned a great deal...it’s fun to use that knowledge.
---
Yup. Same as Encryptid. Same as Project Paradise.
---
People will go berserk for it for a few weeks, and after everyone is sick of it/have gotten everything they want from it, you'll see it rarely attempted, and it will be back to Scorched Earth.
---
Im talking 3* SS armor/wep not a normal 3*
---
I do not support harassing either, and yeah, sure, SOME of us need to grow up just cause your post got downvoted. I heard your opinion, everything’s good, let’s just end it here and stop the political debate in this sub. (Ain’t you got Twitter for this kind of stuff?)
---
You don't want her, she is hugely annoying
---
I just want it for the extra damage,all my guns aren't that great, except my melee I got today, and a 2* combat rifle I got for 700 caps, which I can't even use yet
---
Awesome, thanks so much for the info. I'm gonna server hop for a bit and see if I have any luck 😅
---
Wow, I secretly hoped that some previous visitors of the maze will show up here, but never thought it would be so fast! I'm sincerely happy she liked it! Also, how did she sent the message? Sadly don't remember recieving it
---
No this is a community event no games ever let these things fail even if we didnt deposit anything
---
Every long time player I've heard of is talking about how many thousands of steel they donated, and with the game on gamepass there's likely a healthy influx of new players. I imagine we can skip the conspiracy theories and just assume there's a vaguely healthy player count and they set a realistic goal that we met.
---
Last month I was gifted an x-01 that had some mods already done to it so I know that there are good people. It's just about having the right equipment for the job.
---
Seems like someone else is being a prick.
---
More than that and sometimes it takes you somewhere else instead
---
Damn dude. Well, I just got 2100 hours and I just realized that I needed like 80% of the mods for the ulracite Gatling gun too. Stupid drop rates lol
---
Berserker with a full set of(broken) lifesaving armor.
---
How is that even a rebuttal to what I said? Just an idiot talking out of your ass with no reading comprehension skills whatsoever. I hope you enjoyed the stream bud.
---
A "slightly cheaper" -- resource wise, at least -- of making fuel in bulk is by crafting level 40 flamers. At least it doesn't use waste oil to make, and each level 40 flamer drops 100 fuel. Serendipity also applies. 
---
Once you're done, equip scrapper and shred the extra flamers to get some of your scrap back.
---
Followed shortly by the pissing and moaning that new content needs to be added to the game.
---
I found a middle ground of messy with nice thimgs
---
Pipe rifles give one....  golf balls give cork
---
Agility increases AP and stealth, it has no affect on defensive stats and like I said, anyone can use dodgy. You can’t compare it when it’s not a bloodied skill... Once again, bloodied build is different than a stealth build, tanks can have stealth stats too.
---
Last time I saw the math, a bloodied’s health with all the perks equipped is worth about 76% range protection of a full hp build with no defensive perks and 89% melee protection. That’s before tanks get any of those same stats reduc like blocker, dodgy, etc. tanks are also gain plenty from serendipity if they choose to use it, it just benefits a bloodied more often cause we’re constantly near 0.
---
The devs do awful in that event. Did you not see it? Devann especially died the moment she spawned and at one point all of them were dead at the same time. They were absolutely destroyed with bloodied builds lol.
---
I usually have Daguerre wear the civil war era dress and a prisoner collar.
---
Im given to understand sneak is what you're after. Have you done the questlines for the raidersysettlers to the point of choosing sides? The Chinese stealth suit will drastically help. Otherwise sneaky lightweight armor with proper perks and stealth boys. (I can supply those if needed)
---
Edit: you have better PA than i do :)
---
No real harm or foul.  I'm just feeling salty.  Have a good one.
---
(oh and the struck-out name above was not the actual character's name, just my lame example. That'd be bad form.  :)
---
I like it. I hit 100 after buying the last 15 tiers. The dark matter one is really nice looking. Using instead of my t65 atomic onslaught paint. I like the sounds it makes
---
Didn’t they say they were putting finishing touches on it?
---
Yes you must have just played NW
---
You pick a location to fast travel but the game refuses to teleport you.
---
Equip(but don't use) the fireworks mine from the legendary run, super fast reload. It just works.
---
If ya need some plans man just ask on here usually anything not super rare just gets handed out like candy on Halloween
---
Don't forget furious, they're always great. Especially if they are also crippling.
---
And stalker's. In fact it works with most of the legendary effects, and not just weapon ones. Auto stim anyone?
---
Damm so nobody can see them, that really sucks cause I had bought something and when I saw what it was I regret buying it smh
---
Got a bloody handy couple days ago, it had a +33% change to finish you off. It was only 2 stars
---
Where are the clips guys!!! Come on we need to laugh at them.
---
Not beforehand no
---
Once you step foot in a workshop zone, you are fair game. 
---
I only do workshops for the SCORE challenges. No real reason to mess with them otherwise. And I stay crouched when I'm there, so no one sees me on the map. And I immediately move to the border of the zone until the shop is fully claimed, so I can dip out of the area when I'm done.
---
If it makes you feel any better they got the fast travel bug during their stream and they got wiped.
---
Yeah, I had to restart it also, luckily I wasn't as far along. Second time was bugged, but I managed to get through it. We have self driving cars and remote control dune buggies on Mars but Bethesda can't code a stable quest in an engine they've been using for what, a decade? Such is life.
---
I build a small shack, but with just enough space to fit a workbench or 2 in it
---
Oh, look at that. Another one of *these* posts.
---
yeah fuck nuclear winter. i wish it wasn’t in the game at all.
---
I got one from fertile soil in Flatwoods.
---
I love to go find new or low level characters and drop plans, recipes and stims for them. A couple times I followed them and would watch their encounters and from a distance and take out enemies after they’ve gotten a couple whacks in.
---
Well, as a half hour ago.  Yes you can.  Did so got a nice box in return.
---
From the first paragraph, I thought you were gonna be talking about Skyrim.
---
Would love to play with you sometime. Lowly level 21 here on xbox with no one to play with due to the bad reputation but really wanna play with some people and maybe some help on events lol
---
They’d better make some of that count as concrete, or better, cork.
---
Charisma is your go-to stat, max it.   Team medic, anti-epidemic, inspiration, friendly fire, philanthropist, pharmacist, chemist, pharma farma, starched genes, class freak, traveling pharmacy are all perks you’re gonna want.
---
I get it...but why would the dupers donate at all?  These rewards are in the 10 trillion large presents they have.
---
My camp looks awful.  I just don’t play enough to spend time on it but eventually I will.  Right now it’s just a functional setup of workbenches.  I really just want to find a safe/hidden spot to put my camp but just haven’t run across a location yet that would suit me.
---
I have a furious handy that gets me off
---
I do the same. I care not for CAMP building. Just the essentials and I’m good.
---
What is a sluggish super sledge?
---
did u try to play the game instead of crying here?
---
I love this community so much. I was a measly level 17 during the last double co event, and this high level guy gave me a ton of stuff, invited me into his friend group, helped me power level to level 120, and taught me a lot about this game, and we are all pretty good friends. You definitely don’t get an experience like that in New Vegas lol
---
To each his/her own!!
---
After everything Bethesda has managed to screw up in the most ridiculous way, you want them to add try to add more mechanics? That would probably completely destroy the game. It would probably be something like:
---
1. Add 250 concrete to donation box
---
2. Everything in your inventory is deleted from the game 
---
3. Game crashes
---
4. Support team tells you to screw off.
---
Only if you're injecting a super stim.
---
Ah yes anything thats any more than 15 health is a tank
---
My aid is laggy now.
---
I'll not be donating anything further if there's a large possibility that it will just be excess anyways.
---
that was easily some of the best writing in the entire game lol.
---
Actually they don't. Since fallout 1 till new Vegas whenever you take off killed NPC's armor they lay in their underwear.
---
You too
---
Yup only claim a workshop on a public server for the score.  If I need to farm resources I go to private.
---
I spent more time writing this comment than I did thinking about donating steel and actually donating steel combined.
---
But you still got the armor legitimately right? From crafting it using modules and Vault 94 steel? Just want to make sure the images I'm seeing on Google aren't the "custom" legendaries from hacks a while back. I'm still worried they might've undone their fix and now they're not rollable again. I haven't gotten any chameleon either.
---
I know this doesn't totally answer your question, but to add to your data: I got a 3\* SS armor piece from Fasnacht.
---
I think we wouldn't all hate 1\* drops if there weren't so many garbage effects available for 1\*.  Like Nocturnal.
---
I agree. i named my main character qwark when the game first came out not knowing i’d fall in love
---
First it was "the Dupers will do it in minutes"
---
Then it was "it'll never be completed because everyone is boycotting" 
---
After which came "Bethesda will fake it when it falls short" 
---
And now its done..."i don't believe its real, I just can't think of a new Troll comment atm". 
---
Do the math, it's not difficult if a large number of players donate even the minimum amount. People who donate several times that will easily carry it over the line. 
---
FYI - between a Collectron finding me ammo and scrap weapons, an ammo maker, a converter taking unusable ammo and making it usable,  the scrapper perk, and just general junk collection/scrapping I've not bought or made any ammo during the event or had to make special efforts to supercharge my steel finding...the result is several thousand donated. Easy!
---
there's going to be a similar event for the enclave
---
I have the plans for one but haven't built it yet due to my lack of ballistic weave. I working on a "final" armor set for the game and am planning on a light/sneak set. Just need to get my weapons situated bc I have too many on my person and in my stash.
---
This game should be dead
---
Why should it bring you out of the game?  
---
That was the purpose of Vault 76, it is your job: Rebuild america.
---
It’s the great food truck race!  I saw another post  like this a few weeks ago, that’s too funny.
---
Once I got a Junkies Gauss Shotgun I realized how little damage I’ve been doing for the past 120 levels.
---
lol get the fuck out Hewlett Packard
---
Yeah, modules and steel. Chameleon doesn't exist in loot pool
---
Mine actually is like a small town along the road. My goal was to make it look like it was part of the game
---
BOS is just the military doing military things the enclave are the fan boys that were thrown out for being weird
---
I have plenty of bf for ya. Happy to help allocate weapon usage too. Be on in a couple hours. (Think i have 200 ballistic fib)
---
I wish you could at least get the weapon or armor they're using instead of a random one! Someone attacks you with a minigun and you get a sledgehammer, or you see someone attacking you with a plasma rifle and you see some shitty pipe revolver on their corpse.
---
Lick them boots clean boy ;)
---
You can already choose to only do half the quests. I already skip anything more difficult in NW than "Place Camp" or "Survive 10 minutes." If I level up, great, I get the challenge. If I don't, oh, well.
---
Why should I miss out on the additional 5 quests because someone else is lazy and doesn't want to do the minimal work to do the already manageable quests?
---
I'm at 75/100 skipping multiple challenges. It's doable as is.
---
That was just the stream having issues
---
Finally someone not wearing rosy coloured glasses of nostalgia boners remembers NV for what it was at launch....
---
A broken, full of game breaking, save wiping bugs piece of trash. Only FO/ES game I traded in after owning it for a week.
---
Poorly.
---
More seriously, I would guess that it will be an option in the Perk menu (so Pip-Boy -&gt; Perks to access), and if we're lucky we'll get 5 "slots".
---
Things I don't think we'll have:
---
* Different SPECIAL distribution per loadout
---
* A fast way to switch between loadouts (some in this thread are talking about in-battle switching) - Hell, I wouldn't be shocked if it's a new 'computer' that we have to deal with (I'm looking at you, ammo coverter!)
---
* A way to "copy" perk loadouts. When you start working on slot 2, it's a completely blank slate
---
* A way to "clear" a loadout. Want to start over? Going to have to remove all the perks to do it
---
* A way to "name" a loadout. It's loadout 1-5 and you'll learn to love it.
---
‘Merica. Fuck yeah!
---
Guys, I've been playing bethesda games since Morrowind released on the original Xbox. Bethesda specializes in bugs, just not fixing them.
---
You mean the ones who have soundboards at the ready to blast obnoxious meme crap as soon as they do it?
---
They're trolls/griefers, that's what's up with them.  Bethesda has set them up for success with workshops.  Oh, and also with un-patched exploits like explosive bait mines.
---
Not sure how about others, i just throw out stuff like heavy ammo and meds if i have too much on me :)
---
You need to be looking for those junkies handies. No other handie like it.
---
i have no idea what your talking about having the right build means bloodied doesn't mean shit tank assault build chomps though adds
---
You love junky handies?
---
there is one type of vendor who either has bow or drug plans. They suck.
---
I was a little suprised. I only donated once at 250. I had just scrapped a ton of weapons from events and used that steel.  Didn’t dip into my own stash.  Just wanted to see what the provisions were, and it was underwhelming.
---
Or you can just put a switch and not spend time writing a reddit post
---
Lol when it was released it was the worst fallout ever! Boring areas lame story line etc etc, Jesus it used to wipe your entire save! Hundreds of hours gone, don’t get me wrong it was a great game but everyone treats it as this imperfect game, and also games change over time remember no mans sky? Literally biggest flop ever but guess what games actually good now.
---
Cheap is cheap.
---
Nothing was said in here that isn't already on the front page.  Why did you make a separate post for this?  Clutter the sub.
---
Wow okay, i am level 120. I actually knew about the bug, but i am so used to it that i forgot it existed. I thought there was a bug i was unaware of.
---
shut up ad victoram
---
Good idea.  Thanks for sharing.
---
Faster firing becomes an unwanted roll.

Just don't go charging any wind mills....
---
Yeah it doesn’t make the slightest amount of sense.
---
Definitely. I like little shacks or tents and a small garden and campfire.
---
With all that cork and screw you'll be able to build something.
---
I'm more surprised why they made 1. different amount of resources goals 2.most common resources have lesser amount goal than more rare ones..
---
Pvp is a part of the game. It’s waaaayyy better now then it used to be. Before, they could just gank you outside of the workshops. With score challenges, you have to take workshops. Before you can claim a workshop you have to spend time killing enemies in the area. That takes time. Or, you can just take one already claimed by killing the person who owns it.
---
I only donated for steel because I could easily acquire it. I won’t be doing the rest.
---
I've been playing Bethesda games since Morrowind dropped on the original  Xbox, was one of the games that led me to being the gamer I am today, along with halo two. Trust me when I say Bethesda specializes in bugs, just not fixing them.
---
We also have a handheld device that’s more powerful than computers a decade ago, but use it to downvote people on a forum for a dying video game
---
I think masochism is the name of the game lol
---
Brothehood scum. America now and forever.
---
I did that when survival mode was here. I wanted to be more inconspicuous.
---
as A bloodied person. Ima just say it isn’t hard to hear an active radcleaner or see floor pressure plates to activate one. 
---
Though I will say that sometimes A person will leave A radcleaner on at the only entrance to their house as if they are trying to force you to use it.
---
Ok, thanks. Hopefully it's just bad RNG and not a bug. 
---
Have you heard that all the legendary prefixes have to cycle through on the Vault 94 before you can get a duplicate prefix? 
---
I don't believe that's true because now I've got 2x Vanguard, Weightless, etc. but no unyielding yet. Just curious if you had any anecdotal experience
---
I tend to either leave them some purified water and food, or i tell them to trade with me for super cheap plans or anything in my inventory i dont use. Always makes me happy to help low level players. Only problem is, the fecking "no button to accept trade bug" keeps me from doing it sometimes. 😠
---
They don’t in New Vegas, not sure about 3 and the previous ones though
---
In their defense any issues with it aren't a problem for them. More a normal day.
---
im looking for something that says “dad likes leather”
---
Ok? I run 50% hp, but try again. Maybe sarcasm will get you somewhere this time! :D
---
Isn't that useless on the queen though?
---
Canceled my Fo1st sub. I cant take it anymore, I played to check wastelanders, I am sad what they did to my fav game franchise. Back to New Vegas I guess.
---
Oh, look at that.  Another one of *these* comments.
---
I was being chased by a high level Yao Guai pair (one diseased and one glowing). This level i think 168 came in. Saved my life. And dropped me a bunch of supplies, plans, and some weapons (a few legendaries). I still have a few of those legendaries in my stash for when i become high enough level. I'm still living off the purified water he gave me
---
your not the Americans your just some idiot hiding the secret service(confirmed bothers) are the real Americans
---
But ... coal is useful.
---
Are you just this agitated all the time? First of all, English is not my first language so im sorry if im not expressing myself right. The problems are clearly with the servers. Not my system. and they are being reported all over the place. so either everyone's system is having a melt down at the same time, or its the servers. Fps can also be caused if the developer has overloaded some assets that will overload any system which looks like they did to meat piles at least here on consoles. But it´s also a lot of disconnected from server and lag when im playing. So do you want me to explain further?
---
Tank killer stacks with aa for rifles, at least it used to.  Is that really different from heavies?
---
President Eden begs to differ.
---
There are no vanguard weapons, but things like junkies work at full health
---
Yes, they can be distracting and bothersome sometimes.
---
Yeah. I donated first day after patch 2k steel without even opening first box. It's later I discovered rewards were meh. I'm sure I'm not the only one who donated some amount in a row before opening those boxes. Besides steel is the most common resource and the goal was not that high considering how many people play this game.
---
Vampire weapons regenerate health with each shot, pairs well with Vanguard
---
I use to build huge things but not being able to have my camp placed all the time has kept me from caring so much lol
---
Did you check if he was actually there?
---
 Lucky, gifts would’ve been nice on my end. But, all I got was a level 300 and his friend who purposely destroyed my camp, and then my cousin’s camp, then us for about an hour straight. XD Everyone else was nice though after that.
---
So I got this problem as well now... Does it happen because you don't do things in the right order or is it just random?
---
Did you not get the memo - all camps are bad now.
---
Apparently the Good Camp builders have left the game en mass because they can't double wall any more.
---
It must be true, I read it on Reddit.
---
[Various junk](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cork_(Fallout_76)) and supposedly some pipe weaponry (i've seen it suggested but haven't verified myself, also not revolvers)
---
Well, I'm curious how many players are also Detroit
---
Lions fans. Pretty similar situations. Failure is more an expectation than something unusual.
---
I tend to make stuff that fits into the world. My current camp is a small shack with a watchtower and a platform with utilities that looks like a Responders' road outpost, it has cables running across the center comfortably above people's heads to avoid clipping and overall looks functional but rather messy.
---
Does anyone know if you can build the ammo machine in other people’s camps? Say, if you’re on a team?
---
You can turn on invincible building in the options too
---
The green area kinda needs a little bit of more higher level enemies to be honest it gets boring but when you step out you get smacked down pretty fast. I’d try farming a little on the leader of the pack event then head to wavy willards area for a little more of a challenge. Maybe a group will help for events.
---
i don't know I've never seen him and ravan rock where he was held blew up so unless i see him and he gives orders for the brother hood to stand down leave
---
well not really, taking down the sbq or collosus with an average build would suck, you almost have to be bloodied to do it without wasting thousands of rounds, But any other enemy in the game is easy to kill with a lackluster build.
---
You'll get the bare minimum and that's it. Don't push your luck.
---
Vast majority don't want PvP because the vast majority of the Fallout franchise fanbase have been playing Fallout for its immersive world and story-telling that has been going on for two decades in a single-player environment. Multiplayer should be focused on creating an even more engaging world somehow, not figuring out how they can compete- in any capacity- for a PvP fanbase. There are enough games that fill that niche. Bethesda has never been a PvP game-making company. I doubt they'd be very good at it.  
---
They should stick to what they have historically been good at, and focus on creating engaging worlds with deep, immersive world-building.  
---
Nuclear World can be a fun getaway from the PvE, but PvE is what Bethesda has always been good at. You *will* be disappointed if you try to get Bethesda to make Fallout PvP fun.
---
I really like seasons in The Division 2. You have three months  and I feel that is easily doable. I have finished the first one under month (because covid) and second one in month and half.
---
But it works completely different.
---
I don't believe it is true. Just shit RNG
---
If your on xbox grounded looks pretty promising i haven't played it yet since i play on ps4.
---
She also wears that dress at my camp, but with a Deathclaw mask.
---
They could also do things like adding more mobs to filter out afk people. For example Encryptid and SBQ fight both have tons of mobs beyond the legendary that will attack you if you are just sitting there.
---
Vanguard is pretty tanky. Keep that health at full.
---
That’s my point I have to many no one gave it to me they dropped it and I pick it up
---
I expected the community to be more like GTAO community. Most people shoot on sight. But i decided to give the game a try and was shocked i wasnt instantly nuked or gunned down.
---
Any perks that I should pick up?
---
Bloodied needs a pretty serious nerf...
---
To put it into perspective you would need a Junkies, Furious, Anti-Armor, Two-Shot weapon to keep up with a Bloodied build with Adrenal Reaction. 
---
Plus or munis the Two-Shot part depending on what numbers for Anti-Armor you want to use and on the numbers used for Adrenal Reaction.
---
Either way, it's still pretty damn broken as it is now.
---
Do Vampires Explosive  Shotguns with vanguard gear and luck of the draw, allows for max health and constant regen. Or alternatively you can try an AOE build mixed with vanguard gear as a support character.
---
Always stocking up on aid
---
No but I wish I did
---
I checked out my stats while having a sniff and it said it was restoring 4HP per second while high on pipe
---
Pipe is life... literally
---
Vanguard by itself is underwhelming...I had a full set, but I felt flimsy.
---
These are the kind of things I wish I get to do. Literally see nobody fun on Xbox.
---
I hate PVP in this game, HATE IT. Its a mess, but with that being said....
---
You got one shotted (short of being really low health i find that hard to believe) in a clear PVP zone. You knew the risks, claimed the shop and now you're mad that you were killed? 
---
So you'd prefer an old school dueling mechanic be added in lieu of the immersion of surviving the wasteland? "Pardon me good sir, I want what you have. Shall we turn around, walk 5 paces turn and fire?".
---
Good lord. Post apocolyptic world dude.
---
It can be good, especially for the upcoming colossal problem event, but you will be doing a lot less dmg which can get boring endgame when all you want to do is one-shot the weaker mobs. You just need to be very particular about how you build your character and what weapon types you’re using. Don’t get any vanguard legendary perks though! Damage resistance is useless after 350-400. I would invest in a couple auto-revive armors if you’re looking to stay in the game. 
---
Besides that I would suggest just looking into tank builds online. Lots of players have lots of opinion on here, and it can be a pain to figure out which one of us is right. Once you find a build you like, use nukes and dragon website to edit the build how you want it and it’ll let you know the order you should start collecting the needed perk cards. Plus it lets you see how mutations and cards effect all your stats!
---
Why?
---
I just got to 52 and can do almost everything with a general solo build with just 30% shotgun dmg buff through perks, minmaxing now to a full shotgun build, just to be able to do really everything solo
---
Thought ya ment nobody ever gave you any I’ll take all extras off your hands if you don’t want them lol
---
Allegedly that's isn't for another 150-200yrs from when we opened Vault 76. I've never actually seen a president before, but I still hear their voices. Enough for me to believe in restoring America. I'm old enough to actually remember America and want to restore it to it's former glory.
---
did you hear something over there?? Oh man, I think that was shot fired!?
---
Camp building is my endgame. I try to make my camp scream *microtransactions* as loud as possible
---
Exterminators
---
Ok, my bad. I wasn't actually directing my initial comment towards you despite posting in your topic. I just get so tired of all the people complaining that bloody is too strong. I play with a friend who plays a full health shotgunner. He handles his part of our missions and events fine. He can one-shot most enemies as well. My point is the game does have variety and other builds that are viable alternatives to the risk/reward of playing bloodied.
---
And thank you! Let me know if you have any questions and I’ll help how I can
---
Because you get diminishing returns on DR/ER above around 350....unarmed scorched chew through you like no one’s business.
---
Assaultrons and Gutsys will kill you dead too....and get staggered by Yaoi Gui? Dead too.
---
I run a set of zealot’s scout armor and I can stand in the Queen’s face and laugh.
---
I run a troubleshooter set and I can solo Encryptid with a vampire heavy weapon.
---
It's a tradeoff right now, as you gain more survival and less stat bonus. I am non-PA blood right now for the int boost, but will probably do the same and swap to PA in the future for a lark.
---
Nice 1
---
A B FFR WR plasma caster...because I wasn’t a bloodied build when I crafted it.
---
So, basically, they played a completely normal Fallout 76 event?
---
do you have too many active dailies?  Not sure of what the max number is, but I also could not get new dailies.  I rejected a few I had no interest in doing, and started getting new dailies in my list.
---
And the witch mask too I hope? It's weird how hard it is to get the witch costume compared to the skeleton, but it looks great.
---
Please keep to the script...
---
1. Bethesda bad
---
2. Devs lazy
---
3. Todd evil
---
4. 79 dead.
---
Its terrible when people try to insert a bit of truth or reality, stop immediately. 😁
---
There's already a huge downside in bloodied builds, you are less than 20% HP and 2-3 hits most of the time.
---
Nice try saving your ass. People complain about "server instability" every fucking update like clockwork and then quickly forget about it because it never actually exists. If there were ACTUAL issues with their servers you wouldn't have someone here and there complaining about it, it's the fucking servers we're all playing on so everyone would be experiencing it. If you're experiencing issues and this sub isn't 99% people complaining about the same shit then the problem is either with your system or your isp.
---
This games does that to ya man, it’s just one of those special little traits that you come to love cause only you know about it, no one else does. People call these things imperfections, but really, that’s the good stuff.
---
People probably look at me weird as I charge the sbq with a Vampire Mr. Handy with +50% limb damage, but I don’t care because infinite life.
---
Yep. He was.
---
Still had to put the meat on the grill at Hemlock Holes as normal, then fast travel to him to get to the vegetables part, then fast travel back to him after placing the vegetables to end the quest.
---
Lots of food miles there
---
Thanks guys!
---
ah but you see those eyebots and broadcast don't exist and I've seen the president and got orders from an army general so slink back to your hole
---
Anti armor faster reload reduced weight gauss mini
---
Furious faster fire gauss mini

Anti armor faster reload +33 vats gauss shotty

Unyielding sentinel food and chem weight reduction ss chest.
---
You need to keep the original weapon which you can then upgrade to a higher level. But you need to keep the original. 
---
I’d you got rid of the weapon that sucks for you. HOWEVER you can buy that weapon off another person. I’ve seen a vendor here and there selling it for cheap. Or you can simply make a new character, ask a high level friend to help you fast travel to the mansion and grind the mission as quick as possible. As soon as you unlock the three weapons simply give them to your friend to hold on to them for you. That way he can upgrade them for you, or you can upgrade them yourself when you swap back to your other character.
---
&gt;English is not my first language
---
And yet you argue with people about a minor point of semantics, and don’t apologize when it’s carefully explained for you to demonstrate you were in the wrong.
---
It’s not an issue if English isn’t your first language.  That just means that you may need to take a step back and realize you misunderstood something or misspoke on your end. Especially when it’s a fine detail.
---
Yes. I have 19k. duell1ty
---
Fun/enjoyable build &gt; exp. Nothing stupid about that.
---
As I've been told when I started to play it's an old ignored bug.. It's indeed very inconvenient because some legendary and modded items can have really long names and it's impossible to see what it actually is without preview. ironically the preview button does nothing because it doesn't work. I don't know how long it's been like this, but I play this game for like 3 months and never been able to preview anything in player's vending machine. people say it was like that long before, so I assume it never worked.
---
I didn’t realize you couldn’t sell raw meat. Huh weird. 
---
That display clip is a pain it has to like hover off the wall or at an angle to sense it.
---
Because it just works.
---
I want to share my experience with this bug. I always had this bug with my shotgunner, and sometimes with my stealth build. I moved to another house, with better connection. Now it never happens.
---
Same computer, same everything. Just different latency.
---
It's still shameful that this bug depends on latency. It shouldn't work like that.
---
Definitely worth doing!
---
Actually what a weird bit nice experience, in a roleplaying way :). At least they weren't Yolo jumping towards you and just mowing you over
---
A small price for salvation
---
True, but are there enough new players to warrant alienating the current ones? I know I have 106k steel and the BOS isn't getting a lick of it.
---
I don't have anything to trade with unfortunately all I get is junk.
---
Killed a wanted teammate once
---
The thing is, it's just raw Yao Guai, I could sell all the other meats I have just fine
---
Well I only had three or four as far as I can remember and as I said I could get non-wastelander dailys and do them, like the one where you fetch targets, bury a "soldier" and eat hot dogs
---
I started building a set of Exterminator effect armor for doing Vault 94 runs, but I ended up never being able to complete a run without crashing or getting stuck somehow (got stuck downed once so no one could revive me, but I also never died).  I've scrapped everything with the effect ever since!
---
Though if I got a RW Exterminator's flamer, I might keep it for amusement.  Like my Hunter's spear collection, or bloodied sickles.
---
Lol they were implied.
---
underrated comment
---
With Covid I have been stuck home almost exclusively. I am super high risk and my wife is pregnant so there has been no going out at all, even for groceries. I didn't think the isolation was getting to me so much until I was doing tea time and there was another player there and we waved at each other. Just a simple interaction like that felt so nice. I miss people and I feel like this game kinda helps me.
---
Welp I donated 8 times then said screw that. Save your scrap y’all—you’ll get a better use for it anyway
---
I did a combination of this and another suggestion of running analysis before putting in the fuse and that worked for me. Crazy game
---
I lost count going to the purveyor and getting nothing but junk. Not even something worth trading.
---
Lmao yeah honestly I can live without double walls but having to remove the wall entirely to change it to a door and vice verse is the annoying part. Like, if I wanted to change the material to brick or something, I would’ve built with that material in the first place.
---
A 3rd party program has been going around for a long time that allows you to dupe and has been rewritten by a few people after the person who started it quit. Basically if you know what you are doing you could have that much cork in minutes. I know a guy who had all the steel needed in his 1st box just by scrapping leather left arms with high INT. I can't imagine he is the only person out there who chose to do that.
---
Shot in the dark but are you sure you don't already have her guitar as an item you can build under the ally tab? If you have an ally already you can still find them out in the world too, but they wont have any dialog to recruit them obviously. It's weird, my old camp was a spawn point for NPCs and on multiple occasions I had 2 Gramps walking around my house.
---
I just sell everything for one cap.  500 caps is the max price in my vendors, don't care if it's some bloodied god-roll, someone else is gonna get more use out of it than me, so why hoard it?
---
Dig it!
---
Edit:GT:Kung Fu Magik (Xbox)

If anyone see’s me on &amp; feels Inclined to link up feel free.
---
Lmfao! 😂 I am not trying to sound cynical here, but it kind of looks good on them. And it makes a point that the game is far from fixed after 22 months. These silly issues should have been resolved in the first quarter of the game? And we are here now with the same dam issues that are supposedly fix, and aren't. And this is coming from some one that has made an effort on many occasions to point them out, to be told it has been resolved, and swept under the carpet on every opportunity they can get. 
---
I have been playing this game for over 3700 hours from launch, I have asked the community manager if they would like to have me report to them on a ongoing basis to help improve the game, and because of ignorance they ignore me like the plagued they have created. 
---
So that being said, they reap what they have sown, and aragents is bliss.  😇😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
On another note, I do wish you all the best!
---
Thanks didn't realise there was a fo76 market subreddit. Thanks I'll have a look. Not much caps though only 19K. Hopefully something worth trading from the purveyor soon. Did fasnacht every hour. I do uranium fever twice a day in the weekend. Junk. Junk. Junk.
---
Add in super easy to gain caps and people selling the ammo they dont use. The last time I did anything with shotgun ammo was buying 5000 for 5k caps. Between it being common on moleminers and people selling it, I dont think Ive crafted shotgun shells ever.
---
Me too
---
Guitar isn't there.
---
Yes. Its no differant than getting it from Mama Mumbles. Just build it at your weapon or armor worlbench.
---
It really was cool. Dickheads yeah but cool nonetheless
---
There was a hack being used around it and people were sharing on YouTube.
---
The display bug is fucking awful. Beth served the community up a big old Cleveland steamer with this patch 💩
---
It works totally fine for me. I saw you said it moved closer to you when popping up from the dirt, wdym by that?
---
RIP
---
To be fair, though, if you stand perfectly still and don't shoot anything...you barely notice the lag. 😜😂👍
---
Faschnats is irrelevant

I think he's going slower over time. His fuel gauge used to hit full every day around 9pm PST, but I noticed recently it's happening later now.
---
So it’s a perk that makes fire heal but exclude the 2 main source of fire in the game? o_0
---
I love the term "Bloody Lemming" and shall use it to describe my low health bloody build from here on out. Thank you.
---
I have a bloody and a PA heavy char, and I enjoy both. Right now i focus on my bloody for the XP boost from the unyeild gear (and because I have most of the weapon plans on them so I have a shot at fixers and other high value legendaries). But as soon as I am comfortable on my lead on the teason, i plan on swapping back to the heavy to play with some new goodies.
---
You’re worth more than caps to me...
---
The funniest part is she is a community manager
---
What is your problem, There are multiple sources for this just look around this sub. People reporting lag, disconnects and rubber banding all around. im sorry if im not using the right words. But something was gotten wrong in this update that is effecting game play, why yall so angry about this?
---
Thanks for that 🤣
---
Yeah. the perk card is even a flamer
---
I actually get a kick out of it when I see a camp where the owner obviously, and totally doesn't give a F. Just an overgrown field, its dark, and rainy, and all you find is a cot and a vendor being powered by the smoke spewing generator. Somewhere is a stash box, maybe down a ravine, and some crafting benches half off the ground next to a tree. It's like they where evicted by the sheriff and all their stuff was thrown in a vacant lot next door.
---
Can you post a link to where Bethedsa states arcing is being  removed. Who aims when there's vats? ADS isn't ideal either because everyone has duped stealthboys.
---
Ngl, the end of your video had me rolling. Nick cage is king lmfao.
---
Yeah so go in a river or if your really tryinggto aboid it put power armor through their window or something.
---
Like when I click "E" to select the shelf, the whole shelf picks up and moves about 6 inches toward me, so i can't just repeat click to sink the objects because it moves out of the "sink hole"
---
Not a dev. Remember she fields all the shit we give and is a fan.
---
Happened to me at SBQ other day, got no loot. This NEEDS to be patched...
---
I dont even have a radcleaner. Also bloodied builds can go get rads themselves instead of making posts about peoples camps.
---
Maybe it will
---
Are they overhauling the combat? For some reason, I was under the impression that they were just adjusting it so that enemy levels would match player levels when combat is calculated. For example, if a level 10 and a level 30 is fighting the same enemy, it would be adjusted so that when the enemy hits the level 10 player, it would calculate it as if a level 10 enemy hit them. While as if that same enemy hits the lvl 30, it would be as if a level 30 hit them.
---
OP forgot to mention he’s level 9000 with legacy weapons and strolling through the wastes in full T65 armor.
---
Honestly take it as a compliment everyone is too scared to fight you 😘
---
u would cry more playing buggy event.

Hope, hope never changes

I recently hit 225 as a casual player. I enjoy helping newbies as much as I can but please .. DO NOT HIT ME UP EVERY TIME I'M ON! This has brought me to taking workshops from low levels just to destroy their hard work. I WASN'T ONE OF THOSE PLAYERS! YOU MADE ME ONE OF THE TOXIC WASTELANDERS! 
---
Sorry... Had to get that off my chest. If you're on Xbox, hit me up and I'll help you. :)
---
I know, but it's not the only problem, sometimes you just wanna see the outfit for example. besides with the server lag sometimes it's a risk to accidentally buy stuff you didn't mean to.
---
Yeah, usually somebody paid around 1800 caps to run that event. Unless it's their first time and they're using the one from the quest.
---
I believe it is called "Box of Targets" or something like that. It is from a daily in the Toxic Valley.
---
I was going to say the exact same thing. This is the reason why. Everyone hits a wall around levels 20-40.
---
1 cap
---
For everything except the rarest event plans.
---
Me and a buddy both had vampire flamers he runs friendly fire and mine had bashing damage with reload. so we traded he can bash heal in radiation rumble and heal the nice by a third of thier health.
---
its so nice

Unyielding AP Refresh Sentinel SS Chest
---
I am actually looking for an exterminators shovel, but thats just for the lols
---
I am guilty of being the asshole that's comes and buys all the cheap weapon up, if they can be resold I will stick them in a vendor for a "reasonable" price. Mostly though I just horde scrip weapons, I have 5 alts so I burn through 750 scrip a day and I'm fucked if I have the time to collect that much myself everyday.
---
Something similar happened to me the other day at munitions factory. A level 200+ (I'm level 90) just came busting through looking at the oil extractor I had placed out. I was just watching them and they look over and just immediately kill me. Little did they know I had put most of the oil away (I've learned from past experiences, yay.) But they still decided to kill me and attempt to claim the workshop (my dead body was contesting lol) I was super annoyed afterwards. I get that there's pvp but jesus christ, that guy was a loser.
---
You basically just described a overhaul. They are rebalancing the game it takes a lot of work not just simply changing some numbers around.
---
I would think the best route would be to remove item levels from the game, just have level requirements for items. Then balance PVP and PVE around the same base damage, so there isn't 5 version of each gun, you just have mod upgrades and the same base damage. IT will also make weapon sharing easier for low levels.
---
I'm aware of the questions you have, and am actively working on an answer.
---
aye. no crashes but lots of server not responding messages
---
I thought it was intended that SBQ can't be crippled.
---
Cool!! I've put off the raider and settler stuff so I'll get on that
---
I think we will get something cool for donating cork. i have like 5-7k  cork for 900+ hours of playing.
---
It's a fairly slow weapon as is. Based on the comment I'm going to guess it also didn't have any swing speed buffs.
---
Have you met this community ?
---
Its the only way I am sorry to say. :(
---
Does it say, waiting for response from server?
---
Only way out of it for me is to quit the game from home menu.

I do believe I'm an army general as well, with access to the nuclear silos. Why don't you go back to your crazy house. Oh wait. I also very much doubt the president would waste his time with scum such as yourself. Restoring a pure America should be all of our goals. Not being technofascist hoarding valuable technology we can restore America with.
---
BGS says it’s a bug
---
I know. But my point was that it needs to be fixed or the button removed because it just makes no sense. Another bug that will likely never be fixed :/
---
Why did the chef have smelly fingers?
---
Knock Knock
---
just wait. it will be worse! and worse and worse. untill ur brain get older.
---
I can already smell the salted blood
---
I bought fo76 when it  first came out and have been a gamer since before dirt. My son tried to talk me out of it. Needless to say some moron in an uncle Sam outfit kept killing me after 2 weeks in. I gave up. 
---
I came back a year later with Wastelanders. I've loved it ever since. The community is awesome.  Thank you.
---
Who's there
---
wrong brother hood buddy we don't carve technology yet
---
It's not latency when PvE-ing, only PvP-ing...enemies are not bound to the servers, only players and their interactions with each other.
---
Neah. I regularly sell BoS underarmor plans for 1000-1500. Marine armour plans i usually get about 750 caps. Marine tactical helmet plans i've been getting 3k for recently.
---
some mod and weapons plans have a really low drop rate from only a few events and cannot be bought anywhere.
---
The vast majority of plans are worth 1 cap but there's a good chunk that aren't
---
This  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR\_El8/edit#gid=2043760311](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GSBbydRo8dbqZP0iXdGXg3RYat8k4qljPcW50tR_El8/edit#gid=2043760311)  tells you where to get mods and plans. If it can be bought from a vendor it's almost worthless. f it has a low low lowwwwwwwww drop rate then it's worth something to someone.
---
A years worth
---
Never mind.
---
How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop
---
Who’s taking about the update?  I’m talking about *you*, specifically.
---
Sarcasm appreciated!
---
3000
---
For junkies? Nope. Just get a junkies weapon, get addicted to 5 things, and do regular perks to maximize damage depending on weapon type.
---
Not the devs
---
To me, it doesn’t matter. Except for like the BRCC plans and the Fixer...everything else I sell for 1 cap each.
---
I get what you're saying.  Each of 10 daily challenges would be worth the same amount, a max of x SCORE per day which can be acheived from any 5 of the 10 events. Nobody misses out on SCORE, it's just up to each player to pick the 5 challenges they'd prefer to do.  And yes, it would suit me better!
---
I am not lazy; I do them all. BUT there is a life/family/game balance and some events can take a little too much time. Lack of time on some days does not make a player lazy.
---
That is a badass weapon. You got it for a steal.
---
I actually enjoy the PvP aspect of contested workshops, it's the only time I feel any kind of tension in the game anymore.
---
If I'm hanging out in a workshop building it up for materials I will make a point to not store my junk just so I can feel that small tingle of danger when another player runs up.
---
Nah it was completely absent from the drop table for a long time the only way to get it was from a container/super mutant gore bag. It was fairly recently that they fixed it.
---
I think there are quite a lot of new players just from looking at the map. I don’t think we have exact data but I don’t see any trouble in giving new players an opportunity to get these plans.
---
Leaving a bug ridden game...to play an even buggier overhyped mess. Good choice
---
Hell no. Then you'll get trolls standing in your way for hours. Dobt nake griefing easier. Just avoid cliff bases.
---
I farm Blood Eagles for their stims. God bless the return of NPCs.
---
Because he kneeded a poo.
---
yeah my "Lets cook" emoji (the pot stirring one) was fast af last night.  it was hilarious.  it eventually slowed down before I signed off for the night.  Its Bethesda🤷‍♂️
---
Little old lady.
---
I really have no idea, but if they are happy so be it. I'm fine with that.
---
IRS takes a while to learn the values of plans because they change and vary so much, when starting out trading properly I was about level 100, my simple rule was if I came across a plan I didn't know I would look that plan up trading forums.
---
it only lasts a few seconds but it's been enough to get me killed a few times. Also suffered some lag where i was shooting things that turned out to be MUCH closer than they appeared and i basically shotgunned myself to death.
---
Once a quest is complete just open and close the pip boy will skip to showing rewards text next. (Assuming the game isnt repeatedly showing that legendary you picked up 40 mins ago still)
---
Value in the eye of the beholder.
---
What was the speed demon bug? I haven't noticed any diff playing.
---
Assuming no full-auto on the handmade?
---
So random question, but what exactly are you going to do with it?
---
You can only sell 1400 to the vendors, and its very easy to do that selling all the meat/aid you pick up anyway.
---
You could make ammo, but since you've been able to acquire 104k, you clearly gather it far faster than you use it.
---
You could sell it in your vendor, but ultimately you can only hold 30k caps anyway on a single character, and its highly unlikely anyone is going to sell genuinely rare items for caps.
---
Which leaves hoping someone on the trading forums is willing to swap something actually good for an abundant resource (albeit in a large quantity).
---
Dont get me wrong - you gathered it, so you do what you like with it. I just dont really get the point of hoarding vast quantities of the easiest obtainable resource. Rare resources like BF and stable flux I understand hoarding, but not one where a run of westtek+ area will get you 500-750
---
Fight the patriarchy by stealing their ammo.
---
Yes. If youre a big guns build, the Gauss Minigun is badass.
---
Ah yes. Fear me and my two legacy weapons. A bloodied pump and a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet lol.
---
When I do that it just skips the rewards all together 🤷‍♀️
---
Did you hear about the constipated mathematician
---
       Don't worry, he worked it out with a pencil
---
What's black and white and red all over?
---
It doesn't mater they're worth way more or that you could trade them towards something?
---
The chaining was never removed on PTS. There was a visual bug which caused the chain lightning to not be visible while outdoors (but still dealt damage). The bug appeared to be fixed in a later PTS update, but the fix didn't seem carry over to live.
---
Bethesda has been fiddling with the chain lightning to fix the damage desync bug (the "damage bug") which had been plaguing Tesla rifles since release (now fixed on live).
---
/u/dayytripper
---
I had no idea. Lol. 😀 I have been reporting to Bethesda.net, and on a few occasions have offered my help, to one of the community managers on their  blog. I was only trying to be of help to improve the game. And I have never had any response to date. It only makes sense because of the amount of time I have invested into this game, I was off work for quite a while because of a surgery that went wrong, I  was playing this game for hours on end to pass the time. You would think that It would be a perfect fit to document issues on a ongoing basis, I wasn't asking for anything in return. I just was getting fed up with the issues. But nonetheless it is what it is. 
---
For every thing else there's Mastercard, right! Just priceless. I wish I could have been there to see it for myself. 
---
Hopefully these ongoing issues will be finally resolved for good in the near future! Wishful thinking I guess.
---
Liberty prime has joined the chat.
---
What's blue and orange and lies at the bottom of the pool?
---
What's blue and fucks grannies?
---
Even at that I can't sell. Just dropping most now...
---
So? A build is a build. It's meant to take advantage of certain mechanics. Just like Junkies', Berserker, Suppressors, etc. The game isn't broken because people are playing it how they're meant to.
---
I did that and the only difference I could see was the dialog with the 'bot when you return to Wayward.
---
Nah for me it's a fusion generator setup on the highest point (most add waves are ground based without firearms), connect all the extractors (by this time the first 'defend' kicks off) then on to the next. I only do turrets in first on certain ones that adds seem to spawn near.
---
I never do power plants it's such a waste on private server when with contractor I can shit out fusion generators in seconds.
---
I’m level 537...there isn’t anything I need or want. My endgame armor and weapons aren’t tradeable anyway. I’d rather other players be able to get the plans they need.
---
You gotta burn off all of that grilled meat somehow!
---
I didn’t know I had a gem and I was actually gonna give that and a bloodied gamma gun away to someone for their gg collection but they flaked on picking it up, so it just sat in my inventory until I looked up it’s worth.
---
I know. If you don't want to use a bloodied build, go ahead, just don't cry about it.
---
Oh no you are gonna make the new Vegas lovers angry
---
Hit me up ign is same...
---
I got you! Go to Blackwater mine right next to White Springs hotel. There is a shed near to where the robot is, the bigger shed with stairs. On the first floor when you enter, turn right. There's a box right there by the lockers you can pick up.
---
Yeah I always play public but if I'm farming, it's private all the way. No bullshit. No PvP. And the loots ALWAYS there.
---
Idk... I guess cause I'm actually really frustrated and i just wanted to say it myself...
---
Forget it, whatever you want to believe.  I already explained this and now it's just talking at a wall.
---
I love mine. Fantastic gunslinger weapon, stealth suit synergy rocks.
---
I would actually love it if they added in a new event where he pops up around the map and asks for meat from creatures in the area
---
Yassssssss.
---
Don't feel bad OP. A lot of the regulars don't know how to disagree cordially. 
---
I'm with you on PVP -- I wish there were no NW, no workshop thefts, no friendly fire during events -- but only one NW challenge each day isn't too bad. 
---
Remember, it's Bethesda. It could always be worse! ;)
---
Well it wasn't so much a choice that I got that much, fish in barrel... Excuse me Line in that sand gives about 3-4k steel an event. So I'm just waiting for them to patch that and never be able to get those quantities again. I trade it occasionally, but I normally makes ammo or anything a new player needs. Just knowing I never have to think about again brings comfort I will never do that grind again.
---
It's ridiculous that they made this a feature in their quake con event at all.  What they desperately needed was an in depth trailer for the BOS content. This  would reassure he community that they are still taking the game seriously. 
---
Instead we got another rehash of shit we have seen before, at a time when frustration and anger in the FO76 community is at an all time high.
---
I don't know if they are completely clueless when it comes to PR, or if they have just given up on this game.
---
Yeah, I don't know.  I could have sworn there was going to be some kind of developer panel back when they were originally talking about QuakeCon@ Home like there was in previous events (albeit from home, of course), but it doesn't look like we'll get any of that this year.  This is pretty much it as far as Bethesda talking about Fallout 76 in an official capacity - the rest of the planned content is fan submissions.
---
I do think it helps hearing the developer side of things, and in the past, panels with them have led to some early teases about upcoming stuff, and a kind of humility about the state of the project that I could empathize with.  There really isn't any developer communication in the PTS either - it all flows through the CMs.  Sure, they probably don't want to subject the devs to some kind of knock-down drag-out "defend your design" argument, but at the same time, putting a human face on the game shouldn't be underestimated when it comes to communication.

Found a guy claiming he dumped at least 1 million dupped steel himself so he could have caps for shopping.
---
So Bloodied is "How they're meant to?"
---
Guess I've been playing wrong all this time.
---
Yup. Many of those in this game :S
---
They don't need to nerf bloodied.  I always hate nerfing in games, unless it's absolutely necessary.  Instead what they should do is buff the other builds.
---
Place one of the posters with lights (Mr. Pebbles ofc) and you can perfectly fit three of the smaller displays on top of it.
---
What did one snow man say to the other?
---
Lol same man but with a Junkies Mini gun. I went to test it a fissure site and killed a legendary SB in like 2 seconds. It blew my mind.
---
The same reason Steve Jobs used an iPhone that crashed every 5 minutes during the first unveiling. 
---
**BECAUSE $$$$$**

(Aka Kool-Aid but better 👍)
---
Maybe she's just not that into you.
---
My camp is awful too. It just 2 hangars next to pleasant valley station. One day I want to build something militarized in the desert of savage divide, but now I’m too concentrated on upgrading my gear.
---
I sounds like you are happy that you do not have to play the game more than you already do. Maybe it is time to take a break or something. I am not saying this to be mean, I am just saying that it sounds like your are burned out.
---
&gt;you have to watch your ho
---
When the wife is in booty shorts and gets up to grab a beer before SBQ...
---
What
---
Walk up to someone doing the 'shoot' emote. The one where you basically Fonzy it pistoling 'ayyyy'.
---
Theyll stare at you confused.... Then slowly draw a weapon and that bounty will soon be gone lol That's how I ditched mine.
---
Huh
---
if you actually look into it you only have a weight reduction when bulking for lead and aluminium, everything else has exactly the same wait/unit the only weight you safe is that of the plastic you used up bundling it.
---
I've been trying to log on for the last 15 minutes I get disconnected as soon as I join the server
---
I'm genuinely curious
---
Woah, Woah! We got a Badass over here! Hey Everyone, OP is Badass!
---
For long enough teams would bait people into PvP with a bounty, they would hide out of the way and as soon as you attack three player would jump out and ambush you.
---
Bloody gets the highest low skill dps damage and now they are demanding people changing how they build their camps to cater to them , lol some people
---
I had a game breaking bug in Elder Scrolls: Arena in 1994 that prevented the main story from progressing...
---
Someone recently did this exact thing to me. Multiple times. Even looted all my junk. That’s fine...
---
I spawned close by, ran, in, and stealth camped my workshop to keep him from claiming it. This is how I spent my game time - almost 2 hours - keeping this punk from getting this workshop. He couldn’t claim it because he couldn’t find me.
---
There were a few times I’m sure he thought it was glitched. He’s run way off, and I’d claim it again. He’d undoubtedly show up again, kill me, and rinse and repeat until he got the fucking clue.
---
It's only for selling and it does safe a small amount of weight for lead and aluminium.
---
Yes!
---
I have sofia wearing a matching outfit to me. Enclave officer outfir and hat with a surgical mask.
---
Fun when my buds come to came and mistake her for me.
---
Edit: Eventually I gave her my old bright red rescue Responder backpack and switched myself to the parachute back pack. (Goes great with the outfit)
---
I've heard that if someone already talked to her recently, she won't give you the dialogue.
---
In case this helps, she spawns sometimes in the area where Grafton monster roams across from Poseidon energy plant. Also, she spawns nearby WV lumber company, a bit down the road from there. And also near Prickett's Fort, above the fort on the cliff near a small pond.
---
You absolutely intended to limit the camp system, which is why there are so many restrictions that didnt exist in fallout 4. And you also have been limiting building behind your paywall the entire time, the most egregious being the new junk walls, again just ripped right out of fallout 4. I've canceled my fo1st sub, wont be getting it again.
---
Wall paper on both sides and give us triangle pieces
---
It's not that I'm burned out. Au contraire, I fully enjoy playing the game, exploring, doing events and enjoying the ambience.
---
I just don't like time gated grinds, especially when there's more than one at the same time
---
Yes, it is a known issue
---
Anyone got a link to it
---
While I wish the rewards were better (alcohol and floater grenades?? Really???), I am glad they didn't put in rare plans as well. I'm a high level and I spend a majority of my time collecting resources and building, so I have plenty to spare, but I wouldn't want to blow it all on some RNG drop rate plan bullshit. I'm sure low levels don't either, while dupers could get it day one and then want to trade for super rare weapons and shit.
---
Any build in particular. Doesn't have to be bloodied, though you're able to use it. And by "how they're meant to" I meant using the games mechanics to your best advantage and putting out the highest damage. If you're not running a build, good for you, but don't bitch when you see people actually using one.
---
Not even an hour after patch dropped I saw someone nuke observatory lol
---
Scrap has market trade value when dealing in the 10's of thousands of it, and has no weight to store with FO1st. Nice to have around as an alternate currency when the situation calls for it.
---
Ok that makes sense. I thought you had got it through regular play (e.g running west tek)
---
Are you on Xbox? It's on Game Pass.
---
I'm broke too. 😊
---
Use a railway rifle with a proper pvp build and you’re solid , I’ve only ever loss these two guys that told me they paid $300 for these two legacy’s , bloodied explosive laser rifles and some armor. Usually I love fighting blood because it’s easy but they killed me a few times it was fun tho
---
If your on xbox gamepass is like $1
---
The worst part is that they decided to categorise a few useful items as MISC. Why gunpowder isn't considered a junk mat makes no sense to me
---
I've seen it twice, once while someone was actually dropping stuff off.
---
Oh man, everyone is nuking the fucking mine where the event isn't happening yet.  😆🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
---
You’re welcome to join my therapy group. Uny-Sent is always tough for me to let go of.
---
I don't think it was ever gone if I'm honest.  I've experienced it since forever :(  I don't even need to one-shot an enemy - just any damage occasionally rubber bands back to what it was.  It presents as a bug, but from what I've witnessed I believe it's a latency issue.  Which is just a different kind of bug because the latency isn't my fault - it's their laggy servers fault.
---
r/FO76 : Cesspit
---
They did it?
---
Nice! I didn’t know that. I play on my husband’s account, so I like the game but am far from good at it!
---
Epic.  That's evil.  I can't wait to launch a nuke.  I've been so afraid.  I refuse to finish the questline.
---
OP then you must truly love the floating, boxy abominations hanging by a staircase off a cliff.... Jesus.... I just can't deal.
---
I'm on PC sadly.
---
Well, all of FO76 is like that. Playable but not really ready for consumers
---
I was surprised they weren't using an instigating vats build on the wendigo spawns. Seems a waste of bloody melee, unless the spawns are tougher than normal.
---
I'm on PC.
---
I'm on Xbox and have a butt-load of resources and plans/recipies. I'm actually hopping on now
---
I had a few problems on Xbox this afternoon. One hard freeze, and one Disconnected from Server. Figured it was a message to go back to work on the building project I’m doing in real life. 
---
Making a structure is so much more complicated than a C.A.M.P. Just the angled roof alone is taking me forever.
---
Got an AA/25/DR Ultracite Gat for 500. biggest steal I've come across.
---
Yoooo I got her on my second hop!!!
---
We can only hope
---
Not sure if it's connected or not, but xbox is having a free live weekend, all the extra users might be overloading xbox live.
---
You'd be willing to give someone (from reddit at that) your name and address for a game? Sounds like a bad idea bud.
---
Can't end the quest, it's a new bug with "patch" 21
---
Probably not, plus that means it's not fixed on the current build of the PTS
---
Sounds like a benefit more than anything.
---
Well than thanx!  I have sold plans cheap in the past except what use to be considered rare.  Now I try and make some cheap caps but to be honest my stash space is worth more to me so I really have no issues giving them away.  If your on ps4 I would give them to you
---
Give ammo. At low levels, ammo is the worst problem. You're unlikely to be using .38 or 10mm, so hand it out. I stock my free vendor over near the wayward, clearly marked, where I plop 50 of each in whenever it gets cleared out (only 50 at a time, to prevent high level ammo converters from \*snerk\* taking free .38, and I can't believe that's a thing) and some low level weapons when I have the stash space. That and spare stims and radaway.
---
She had clean space suit, longshoreman, and 2 halloween witch costumes  😂
---
I do it pretty much every session. 
---
Gas mask, level one hazmat suit, upgraded marine wetsuit, meds, food, ammo, plans, and low level legendaries when I find them.
---
It does, but it still comes on one slow fade at a time.
---
And often ends with the most important thing behind a "..."

How are you doing on that radium rifle?
---
Do you smell carrots?
---
Sorry dude. Wish I could help.
---
And you thought it was bad when nobody closed the door at \*your\* camp...
---
Don’t sell yourself short. You could just drop it anywhere, instead find someone who could use it. Well done!
---
It’s wasted on my rifle build. It’s just trade bait for once I find a nice fixer.
---
The most one Isn't new ... for fracking ever.
---
I always like the grimier side of things in these sorta games, and that's why I built a warehouse in the forests of Cranberry Bog, which houses my homemade porn studio. I feel you though.
---
Just checked. Gamepass version also works on PC.
---
Don’t you mean [RADIATION KING!](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Radiation_King_%28location%29)
---
I'm on PC. a friend of mine said to check here.
---
I really don't, most plans I just plop in my shop for 5-50 caps depending on what they are.  I'd rather them not take up stash space.  And if I have a whole lot of them, like Mole Mine Gauntlets, I just don't even pick them up anymore.  And if I do happen to, I just drop them on the ground.  If they sit in my shop for more than a week, I just drop them at a train station and they are someone else's problem.
---
It's okay dude. Don't worry.
---
That's a nice guy who has no point for caps anymore, but everything does have a fair market price. Not saying that everyone knows how to sell items at fair values, because not everyone does 🤦‍♀️ unfortunately. Although, for high levels like myself that don't have absolutely everything they want yet, it makes sense to still sell things at their fair market value. Plus when you do sell thing for extremely cheap like that you will 100% run into scalpers that'll buy up all your great gear just to re-sell it at it's higher value.
---
LMFAO 24/45 haha
---
Xbox crashed todau
---
I hear you just traded my spare q ffr Tesla for a rifle I wanted.
---
But I love odd weapons
---
NOT TRUE. Mine is in a bathrobe. With a prisoner collar. In a cell. Behind a fireplace secret door.
---
I noticed the same thing.  Had absolutely no problems running on high before this last update and never dropping below 40fps.  Most the time I sit between 60-100.  Specifically missions with lots of "piles" such as radiation rumble or line in the sand.   I have seen dips down to the low teens to even 8fps at one point during line in the sand.   If you turn and look away from the piles, boom, shoots back up to normal.  This wasn't even close to an issue before this last update.
---
It is f'n impossible to aim at 15 fps.  Even bringing VATS up doesn't always work because I'm killing the frame rate even more.   
---
It's like... I want to love your game.  I want to have faith you'll fix it.   I even came back after I lost faith and Wastelanders renewed my love for the game.  FFS...  STOP BREAKING STUFF!
---
Thank you!!!
---
I'm a level 400+ and I still have to get help to mod those. Players that can do that are dedicated.
---
Isn’t this the dream pvp build😂unlikely to get that gear but yes that would be perfect pvp gear just about
---
But isn't Gamepass Games on PC not optimized? I've had it before because it was $1 and the games wouldn't run well... and that was on lowest settings.
---
Literal regular play, before line in the sand glitch etc, i had over 100k in a month of first. Its the easiest to farm..im down to 300 alum.... that's my issue today.
---
It kinda pointless...  you don’t go through your inventory when using a key.. and they don’t add to your weight 
---
So what the point in a keycard ring?
---
I'm hoping ghey gave up and are putting there good people on a new game to get it out as quick as possible.
---
So you can JUDGE them
---
Hella dedicated. The sheer amount of junk needed to craft enough of these guns is insane
---
I got a quad handie from a super mutant once, not enjoyable.....
---
It's fine, the other day they were hotfixing servers one by one. That's why folk couldn't get back into the same world.
---
I have all common plans from bot venders and not so common as fixer, bear arm etc from events. If u put them bloody cheap they Will disappear fast. Thank u for being Nice!!
---
There is a perk to limit the amount of screws and a magazine to help. I'm slowly collecting those mags to take the plunge at some point.
---
Perfect thanks
---
In my defense, I have my male ally in his underwear.
---
Also in my defense, how have we gone through two summers in this game and not had any kind of swimsuit additions to the Atomic Shop?
---
Yea it sucks man 
---
I was expecting info on daily op and perk deck and even expect them to announce build balance to go with the the lvl sync feature they are adding soon...
---
We got nothing
---
Which perk?
---
Yeah, it's a pain to close every door after each iteration of the maze. But to my surprise some players do it themselves!
---
You need ghoul and wolf and mole rat
---
No but I might now!
---
Step 1: get baits
---
Step 2: walk into players camp 
---
Step 3: keep throwing them down untill base goes poof, or rude boy players logs out.  
---
Step 4: lots of lettuce
---
Ive found that stripping my armor and using the "taunt" emote followed by the "help me" emote usually does the trick. People are a lot less scared to kill a naked guy begging for death.
---
So just keep throwing them down until it eventually blows up then? Explains my problem. I only made two. Lol
---
Having a double nat situation can keep you from connecting, and although rare isp's sometimes make changes to your router during updates etc.

I would have to look but I want to say science expert.

Upvoted for visability

If true then shotguns will be pretty much pointless
---
In my 20+ years of online gaming... this happens in ... every single game?
---
Your cutting edge, top of the line power gamers - that have time to farm / min-max to the bone - run very similiar builds?
---
The better question is - what's viable?  I've never felt the need to min/max a build in fallout 76.  I run a nice balanced/mixed utility build, that maximizes my enjoyment of the game.
---
Hey, I sell my legendaries for 30 caps when stock is moving slow. Don't know if it was my camp you visited, but if it was thanks for clearing out the space, and the booze money.
---
I just repeatedly got killed and and my base kept on getting destroyed no matter how many times I moved servers.
---
These are both solid ideas
---
Exactly, you need all of the different DNA samples in your inventory to activate the centrifuge and sequence the vaccine.
---
While the game is a love hate for me I agree. This community has been one of the most welcoming, generous groups towards new players. I had a high level give me stims, plans, ammo and even a level 35 laser Gatlin for when i get to high enough to use it later on. And then asked if there was anything I wanted to do like, quests or kill legendary enemies. I tagged along for a few hours and then we parted ways. I was kinda caught off gaurd by how nice everyone was and so I try to be the same way towards new people now that I'm a little higher in level.
---
They should have streamed an XP or steal scrap run. All we're doing now anyway.

I don’t think any physical copies were ever made for PC. They’re all codes so I doubt someone is still holding on to a code that they bought.
---
Had to restart several times with Ra-Ra's adventures. Really quite frustrating, certainly gave me no reason to do their side again. The foundation's side is so effortless.
---
Make like 30. probably takes about 10 to blow apart a whole vending area for example. I'm really not sure if it's an exploit, but there isnt much else in terms of PVP karma in this game to keep the Rats in check
---
The quest did not say to get wolf and mole rat only ghoul samples.
---
Lol this is embarrassing, nice reaction though.
---
It’s just a good measure to shit on griefers. Don’t get me wrong, I’m an OG in terms of FO76 and have several high level characters, but they’re all melee builds. Can’t exactly PvP on that. It’s a good way to shit on the assholes that are shitting on newcomers and low level people.
---
It's on gamepass on PC as well.
---
Well they should have put in the patch notes which they did not
---
Well I mean I just like it cause of the ark factor. I main a pa build with my plasma with formula p so my shots are tight like a laser rifles shots are.
---
You could get a quad handie, I mean it’s the wasteland
---
That’s because they just changed in the newest patch to only ghoul samples, I can’t explain the bug thought, the others that responded must have not known or skipped over it
---
Vanguard/ap refresh/sent SS left leg. I am bloodied and run unyielding.
---
Say this to my stalkers handie
---
I had the same problem lucky I figured it out but when I got there and asked the guy about it he was like what you haven't been listening to your radio
---
I have no idea either. If I hadn't seen the uproar on here, I'd have no idea there's some major community event going on.
---
I’ll try this.
---
Yes. I’m aware of that. But I’m doing the moth man dance.
---
Yeah,they really should focus better on communication , because nothing changed in the game if you don't come here you miss almost everything.
---
I feel like rose sends you there for something, maybe the enclave? Idk it was a while ago so I don't remember, anyway its near the sons of dane to the southwest lol you donate 250 steel for jack
---
Weird I guess maybe I should pay closer attention if I ever find a reason to log in again.
---
Yeah I know it is easy to get, but I guess maybe my going-in assumption was bias because I am a heavy gunner...  I use A LOT of steel pumping out .50cal and .308 rounds.
---
Exterminator’s gauntlet
---
If that's intended, it's a damn shame. Finally started using a Shotgun and now their main use is gone.
---
Sofia and I wear the BOS fatigues with SS backpack and maroon beret now, use to wear the mountain scout outfit but with the fatigues being an outfit and not under armor I made the change
---
Bethesda is just showing how tone deaf they are to their player base.
---
They don't give a fuck about us and how we feel. It's obvious they did this demo to try and draw in new players that watched quakecon for other games to try and draw in their money for 76.
---
It’s on sale over on steam right now.
---
This game needs to pull a rainbow six siege and announce an operation health.  
---
Take a season to fix bugs, refactor code.  But easier said than done.  Maybe the codebase is too conveluted.
---
NOICE!
---
By level 110 I would think you’d have been there by now
---
Some folks have weird kinks. It's what It's.
---
I dont have access to a private server
---
you still get the rewards for donating though so it’s not entirely wasted
---
I guess harpoons are now the new shotguns
---
We're at 169.87% on the steel, perhaps we should stop?
---
I don't run a Bloodied build and kill stuff in 1 or 2 shotgun blasts just fine.  I think the hate towards Bloodied is overblown.  It's powerful, sure, but has its limits.  I see people die all the time and everytime the server does Encrypted they just stand around waiting since they can't activate the pylon themselves since they'll immediately die.  Luckily my 15 natural endurance shotgun tank character can be a pylon for all 3 while fighting it and just feel a slight tickle.
---
Plenty of builds are viable, not sure why people say there's only 1 or 2 viable builds in the game.  The game is pretty easy, to be perfectly honest.  You could probably do everything with an even SPECIAL spread and zero combat/damage enhancing perks
---
I just like making them waste time. I just hide so they can never take it and they don’t ever find me. 
---
Two people they bought some cheap extra plans I told her that they are on the second accounts because I kinda did the same she said well let me join them and drop the rest of the plans. They leave the team after we try to help them to take over a workshop owed by my friend we were actively act. One of the dudes leaves and comes back with his second account I trick him by putting in in a space he that has no doors so he becomes more and more wanted and hurts himself like an idiot due to his explosion bullets. I the. Shot him with the shotgun killing him. The thing is we told them no and they just kept getting more and more mad so I asked them what they wanted and I swear people are stupid as hell. They told me they wanted to just do the daily challenges and I told them why not go to one of the other works shops if you level on your second account 300 you should know where they are at. They said they didn’t have much time to waste and wanted that one Cause they had to leave soon. They wasted 1 hour trying to get one workshop and 30 more minutes trying to chase me down and find me after I took the other one they had. Daily was one one workshop So they didn’t even need to reclaim the workshop I took because they both by that time got the daily done. They didn’t care about the daily they thought oh I’m a high level even though I mean technically you could get to level 50 and have all the perks you needed if it’s your second character. That was my second character they tried to get me to go on the main to take the workshop back and threaten me to go on their main or even did a stupid idiot move. These where adults they told me oh I’m going to hack your ip I’m going to find your age blah blah blah your ip begins with a one. Couldn’t believe I was talking to adults acting like children on PlayStation.
---
Do you have a power armor chassis?
---
She got moving after the third try, though. To really experience the bug, you have to miss a whole SBQ fight because you can't ft.
---
I do think you could dub over the audio after the second try with the opening lines of Sound of Silence and it would not be out of sync with her face.
---
I sometimes feel bad gifting new players stuff (mostly tons of stimpaks or ammo) because I feel like they just came out of the vault and get my stuff and now there either overencumbered or at like 190/200 carry weight. I tend to leave gifts at lower level camps so they can at least put the unneeded stuff away. Like I have 150 fusion cores to a level 22 at their camp and saw him slowly walk to his stash. Made me feel bad about those I gave like 70 stimpaks to not near a camp or stash box.
---
It's fun on PC exclusively and only if you mod the bejeezus out of it. Seeing how Outer World's was bungled makes me reconsider my stance on who really messed up New Vegas the most
---
That means you're still using the old Kit's strings. Steps should be:
---
* Rename old *strings* folder to something else
---
* Run tool and load SeventySix.esm
---
* Set Destination language to your language. I use English (en).
---
* Load Kit's strings as translation with "Overwrite everything" setting.
---
* Do Finalize to generate new *strings* folder.
---
I didn’t donate.
---
What’s wrong with the beret?
---
You realize not everyone is supposed to finish the season ,how else would they make money off of it
---
Impressive.
---
Well. Find yourself a shishkebab and you can be the difference between failure and success
---
I actually sought out a party member to put me down. Accidently looted a locked safe that was in a workshop zone.. I forgot it makes you wanted. Event tho I've done it before. /slapforehead It took awhile for them to figure out what I wanted, but it eventually got done.
---
I did the raid twice got pushed though a wall and fell into the void the first time the second time full server crash while smashing the heart......
---
It’s merely a NW cosmetic at this point.
---
Oh c'mon now, they've been plenty busy fixing the double interior wall glitch so people can have wallpaper on both sides THAT NO ONE FUCKING ASKED THEM TO FIX.
---
Red rocket workshop, Whitespring clubhouse and pool, Dyer chemical
---
This sub downvotes anyone that points this out. Everyone here is also using the same bloodied build and acts entitled and angry whenever anyone suggest that it needs changing.
---
I sincerely hope you listened to him.
---
If not... well... that may be an issue.
---
You have inflated expectations because (from your work) you don't know how to code, know about algorithms/data structures, or have any understanding of network engineering
---
sadly not imo
---
I like the steel look to it.
---
Fitting, being the Brotherhood of.... Steel
---
They look sad sitting in the vending machine,  
---
Shotgun Shells (5941) 1 cap each.
---
I run a heavy gunner junkies healer build. Pick out 5 addictions you want for junkies so you can still do good damage, then pick up the friendly fire perk, and team medic perk. These two perks are honestly all you need, but if you want to buff teammates as well, max out charisma and pick up extra perks like inspirational, and strange in numbers. Use a flamer as your primary weapon since this is the tool you will use to heal your teammatea directly. Plus, a good flamer can output massive damage.
---
I’m ShinyKittySurprise.  I have two mules with gear.  We’ll find something for you.  
---
I play evenings US time.
---
Yeah, its been super laggy of late, I was hoping it was just my internet, but I see others are having similar issues.
---
My apologies for coming to such a harsh conclusion
---
Yes. Am I supposed to equip it first?
---
I do seriously love the community! My husband and I started playing recently and weve both had multiple high level players shower us with so many things. I was soooo confused and was just told this is how the players are. I've never played another game with such helpful and kind players.
---
Come on, do you think Bethesda even gives a fuck about their community managers? They're not even allowed to do what their own job title says - manage the community.
---
If Bethesda doesn't even care about their own reputation, they sure as hell don't care about their CMs getting embarrassed.
---
What happened there? I haven’t really kept up with it o:
---
Too busy making new bugs.
---
I received around 20 plans from 60 donations. Of those, 3 I did not have. Not sure that was worth my 15k steel.
---
This. So just don't be transferring during the unannounced hotfixes👍
---
Wait... this is a thing!?
---
I donno. I mean how does anyone really know? They don't tell us. And how would you test it. I just pasted 5300 hrs, and I'm still like trial and error figuring shit out. I was we could just have a question and answer gimmick with besthda. Me and someone else had to use 500 flamingos to figure out all the shit in camp budget for fuck sake. The game there but we have to make our own instruction manual and figure shit out ourselves.
---
If we can get every community manager to say it about 1 bug at least once, maybe, just maybe, that bug will get worse.
---
Yes but on ps4
---
I would clear out 308
---
Damn, someone needs some sex, definetly sound sexually repressed over there,  blow a fuse on a post on reddit about wording. You must be a voluntary incel.
---
I thought some people tested it via pvp a while back.  I can try and find it.
---
Yep! I thought 3.5x damage at night was normal from both perk cards maxed out, but apparently I'm supposed to be doing 3.75x damage as I learnt the long way around lmao
---
Always worked for me, but I had a friend sta, there with me.
---
Also a bit confused. The wanted status seemed to vanish every time I fast traveled or was in someone's camp. Does it normally do that? Or just a visual bug?
---
You have to deploy it near the power armor workbench thing
---
You need to put a power armor chassis in front of the  power armor station before you can craft power armor. Select it in your inventory and place it in front and you can make it.
---
How are we at 170% of 150 million steel?!
---
That really sucks, and I was almost finished with building up my alt for a shotgun build. Well, I guess that means that I will have to switch to either melee or heavy gun
---
Any way I can still watch that? I didn’t give a shit about it but I should have expected it to be a bug filled developer stream. Definitely regret not tuning in
---
I don't have money.
---
Gamepass games aren't good on my PC.
---
\*Laughs in my Melee-Talk build\*
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
I was talking about a Download off bethesdas launcher
---
When I was a new player I got wanted once trying to lockpick my way out of a trap camp. I went around begging for someone to kill me to clear my wanted.
---
Deploy it near your power armour crafting station.  When you try to craft from the power armour station then it will automatically move the power armour into the station and you should then be able to lroceed.
---
The gat laser takes fusion cores.  If you didn't make a typo, that might be your problem.
---
Technology raiders
---
Because it's wrong ammo type.
---
&gt;The community and Bethesda relying on modders is why their games are a complete joke in comparison to other games
---
????
---
The community and bethesda **allowing** modders is why their games still top the charts 10 years after release, with huge modding communities that keep the games alive forever.
---
How do you know it was intentional? It wasn’t in the patch notes.
---
Wait, what do you mean "behind"...?  I have these two perks and have never seen 3.75 damage?
---
Ah, thanks.  I could have sworn it took plasma cores.
---
I really want to know if there is something im not getting. is it that you dont belive me unless 99% of this sub is also complaining or? Because it's not happening to you it's not happening?  You also belive because it snows in winter there is no global warming. WTF is wrong with you, im trying to explain problems im having with the game and you are just being nasty. go search for a life under one of them fat flaps of yours.
---
Pretty sure it’s a bug. I submitted a ticket.
---
Hi mate, I'm on PS4 and can help you if you like. Tough cave at that level.
---
I'm on most mornings, some afternoons and most late nights(GMT time).
---
You'll maybe be looking for a dig out after this too, so add me on PSN.
---
My handle on there is - stov1es (icon is a Helgahst helmet from Killzone)
---
This stuff never fails to confuse me lol
---
Dupers are the only reason that we can even succeed at this in the first place, but there needs to be an ingame display on how much has been donated so we didn't waste so much!
---
Lmk if you get them👀😂
---
Take both perk cards off, then put Mr. Sandman on first, then add covert
---
I like your analogy of rebuilding Appalachia together. So much that as a matter of fact I think we keep rebuilding FO76 together by doing our "Dailies" at this Sub feedbacking Beth all the time, right? :-)
---
Update, Bethesda responded and told us to try restarting the console....
---
We made a new camp budget lost Cuz the one that was out there was old. Who's know now ours is probably outdated too. When a patch happens all the "magic weapos" might be shit too. I had done weapon testing myself and found LD better than ffr. But I don't pvp, and went back to stabbing everything to death. Instead of a handmade build. Found out they had changed stuff there too.
---
i guess flair checks out?
---
whaaaaaaaaaa
---
If you mean galling PLASMA then you might want to check which receiver is on it, if its a prime receiver you gotta use ultracite plasma cores that take stable flux to make. Alternatively you can put a normal receiver back on it so you can use regular cores. If its actually a galling laser you need fusion cores to use it.if you put the perk card "power user" it will doubly your ammo capacity
---
No one blew a fuse. You misspoke and made illogical accusations, and I found that humorous. And once proven wrong, you didn’t even have the integrity to admit the error. 
---
And once again, you clearly demonstrate your novice grasp of the English language. 
---
Just FYI, you can’t voluntarily be involuntary.  That’s an oxymoron. 
---
Have a good day, kid.
---
It was never 100% safe. There was always a risk. But something has happened since the last patch. There have been lots of posts claiming people have lost their items using this method.
---
How about I just nuke ur camp instead if you are going to be inconsiderate and rude. Fuck whatever you have to sell.
---
Right!? I've seen clips of people getting the 3.75x multiplayer and was wondering what was going on. Turns out the perks just act weird in a certain order
---
Fart jokes huh, and I'm the child... perhaps you need to git gud too? :P
---
I'm on Xbox and help out as much as possible for lower levels as when I first hit level 50 I had a level 400+ drop me a legacy and I still run it bc it is God tier I swear. (Vampires scattered plas gat)
---
\*Sees all the comments\*   
---
\*Laughs in Melee-Tank Build\*
---
Correct.  For both cards to stack correctly, you must equip Mister Sandman *before* Covert Operative.
---
I very be much like the building in the game. I have already rebuilt my camp 5 times. Everyone has been in a different location. That's the fun in it. Finding that perfect location. I have seen some very awesome camps and I like getting ideas to build from those that I visit. Camps are as unique as the people who build them. Seeing how people maximize the space in the bubble is truly amazing.
---
Ss soon as people figure shit out the rug gets pulled out and we gotta figure out what they did.
---
It’s always worked for me. But earlier this week people were complaining about it.
---
I've been doing it wrong this while time!
---
Half the diameter?
---
Nope I peg her for 600 DPS on average. Higher when I hit in vats sometimes I get 5-6K  a second seeing all the card damage pop. Literally the most broken gun there is the splitter makes it fire like a shotgun instead of the green flame so you get the pellets at full damage and you get the magic if you do it in vats.
---
Admit what error? My game is lagging and im getting disconnected left and right. Do i need to apolagize to you ?
---
Wooooowwwww I feel stupid... Thanks u guys!!!!
---
Then be careful.
---
Wow man I feel dumb 😂😂 thank u!!
---
I'm sure it's already been commented, but I don't have time to read through all the comments. It's not that bloodied needs to be nerfed, it's that the other weapon &amp; armor types need to be reworked to be viable end-game builds. Vanguard build can be tanky as hell, but there isn't a decent weapon type to go with it and the team dynamic isn't like classic MMO where you have a tank, a high DPS and a healer. They basically force everybody to DPS because of the loot mechanics having a damage threshold for boss fights.
---
Any way to stop them shuffling when I server hop? It seems to revert to the wrong way 'round.
---
No need to - Its not exactly obvious and we all had to figure it out at some point 😁
---
Thats the Plasma Gatling you're thinking of.
---
Ah ok, hardly surprising I suppose lol
---
On a related note, I tried the I Am Become Death quest a while ago when I was probably level 50 or 60 and wasn't prepared for it as most enemies were high level, but this time (I'm level 95) most enemies were around level 20 - 30 except for level 50-odd major gutsys. Even the sentry bot was in the 20-30ish range. Was just odd
---
Don't feel dumb, it's not really too obvious if you've never used power armor before.
---
What the actual fuck.... How is this *able* to be a thing. Thx OP this is insane to know!
---
That game died a DEATH
---
I'm not sure. Have you tried unequipping all your agility perks and equipping sandman and covert before the rest?
---
I know the feeling. I gave this guy a hypothetical example about something and he whined that it wasn’t proof.
---
Now that he’s revealed English isn’t his first language, that makes more sense. But unlike most people that aren’t native speakers of a language who will recognize that they may have misunderstood something, he digs in his heels and refuses to acknowledge he might have been wrong.
---
That’s hilarious. I’ve made errors in Spanish and accepted those and rolled with it. Imagine how insane it would be for me (a native English speaker) to insist to a native Spanish speaker that my interpretation of a Spanish phrase or wording was superior to theirs?
---
Hahahahahahaha 😂
---
Taco_lawd
---
You're welcome to watch, I keep getting asked how I manage so much exp so I recently started a twitch stream incised they wanted to know :)
---
Welcome dude! Its awesome having 1000 shots per core instead of just 500
---
Ever since this update I've been having the same exact problem
---
Haha no probs dude! I'm glad I reshuffled my perks. I've been using these perks incorrectly for so long now
---
I hate this update... fix the issues that cause issues. Leave my building alone! Its been 2 weeks since I played... the lag is incredibly horrible now... no fallout 1st for me this month.
---
I don't think anyone ever does, as evidenced by how they locked it off without needing to adjust any existing quest.  It's pretty much an orphaned location with its own self-contained backstory (some kind of top secret weather machine).
---
That said, you see the observatory from a number of points in the world, and its odd shape probably draws most players toward it.
---
you don't die running bloodied... use nerd rage and emergency protocols etc.
---
You still don’t get it. 
---
You abandoned a discussion where you were clearly wrong, still insisting you were right. 
---
And now you’re doing it again. 
---
And I find that hilarious. 
---
/r/notlikeothergirls
---
*laughs in my Vanguards build*
---
I've ALWAYS believed x3.5 was the ceiling for the pair.
---
Easy. They don't want to lose access to review copies.
---
Omg 😅 ppl are weird lol
---
Not really, the complaining players in this reddit trying to boycott, stop the progress, nuke atlas ect, represent a extremely small portion of the total fallout 76 players. The vast majority still contributed to the event. The only one I think has a chance to fail is the cork one and that's because almost no one has much cork in surplus
---
Just look it up🤣
---
&gt;jobs for the working class
---
*America starts sweating bullets*
---
The new problem is work shops don't always show claimed on maps. So I crack a safe or tool box at Red rocket and boom I'm wanted. Woops.
---
This is a bug the 3.5 is the normal, when you put them on in the right order it is 3.75 but this is  bugged  it's only supposed to be 3.5
---
You also have to level 25 to craft it i believe.
---
I tried all of this, but in the end I had to totally move my camp for it to rest set. Sucks but glad it fixed. Thanks
---
Personally i love being naked while running at my attacker then wave hello and then heart them. They freeze for a second in confusion lol
---
Even if this event came out perfect, they have been hyping this event up for ages now, I can't imagine the long-lasting appeal to it.
---
New Vegas is my fav fallout. I’ve thought about returning after this latest update
---
No way in hell I'm going into a nuked zone while bloodied. For varieties sake I do run bloodied primarily cause I frankly find being a glass cannon fun but when it comes to a nuke zone? No damn way. I have a seperate build revolving around nuka cola and alchohol called the "Nuka Knight" same special build as my bloodied cause I don't like switching characters that's basically my own take on a power armor build with an extra liquidated kick that lets me survive in places that have some more annoying things for bloodied characters.
---
Not to mention I have a 3rd build coming up revolving around shotguns. I pretty much change builds weekly for my own sanity but it is funny to know the stream showing it off had a lot of bloodied builds. I'd be devastated if they nerfed it but I wouldn't be surprised either.
---
Wait a sec... isn't Id who made Quake (one of major PvP games around) also part of Bethesda? I could pull out a ton of positive PvP implementation made by Bethesda and/or affiliated companies. From reading your post I can tell straight that you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
And this abomination which is supposed to represent PvP in a Fallout MMO is called Nuclear Winter.... and it's even not in the game, but a separate mode.... a horrible Battle Royal "don't miss the train" attempt. Why it's even there? Oh yeah right, for $.
---
I myself come from PVE in Fallout. Of course. All Fallout fans did that. But 76 was meant to go a different route than all titles before. Did you miss that?
---
I log in to kill the SCORE dailies now and that's about it. I also canceled my FO1st sub so within the next couple days my stash is going to be thousands of lbs over limit, but I just don't have enough fun with the game anymore to pay every month. I picked up Elder Scrolls Online and am having fun getting into that. I may get into their subscription with the money I used to spend on FO1st. We'll see.
---
If you play on PS4 i have guns i dont need so if you want you can have them. Ive made my friends on that game just by giving them things i dont need when theyre low level. I love helping out the community.
---
i did know  about this from watching older captainoob videos, used to do it, now i'm too lazy to swap perk cards out
---
This exact thing is happening to me as well. I'm waiting for an answer too.
---
Dang, this post is like stumbling on a batch of loose screws or ballistic fiber amid the devastation of the Wasteland.
---
On the same page here.
---
Just lackluster you know, this game has so much potential and they give us at hat, it’s just more sad than anything
---
Nothing wrong its just bland for needing to donate so much, like think about this one "250 mil cloth" for the BOS collectron, and we all know that thats nothing for people, I have over 367,000 just stocked up from looting over the games life, steel on the other hand i only had 100k of so it shows the pointless need of actually donating steel for a small blandish beret
---
Stroke your crystal balls!
---
They were turned into an outfit instead of under armour. Why? IDK.
---
Always done it solo on a private server. 
---
Dozens of times. No issues.
---
Transfered my full set of unyielding armour 2 days ago.
---
&gt;Add post-rank 100 incentives for people who finish the SEASON early; once you hit rank 100 there is no reason to continue earning SCORE
---
No reason to continue earning score is the incentive...
---
There are 3 silo hatches in the world, they are surprisingly far away from the silo entrance.
---
Yeah. That's odd because they specifically noted that they were trying to do something a bit more customized but it seems like tons of scrap code and bits and pieces are still being used from fo4
---
Obviously.
---
I'm currently running a build like this. Add a full fireproof card and a dense chest piece and as far as I can tell, you are IMMUNE to damage from explosions. still get crippled from them though.
---
I've been searching around near the entrances, when you say far away do you mean like halfway across the map?
---
I don't sell anything higher than 2500 like that's a 3* junkies or bloodied gun. I'm constantly at Max caps, I don't understand charging so much for Guns or more than 1c for ammo.

Mr. Sandman is supposed to add 50% sneak damage to silenced weapons at night, covert adds 2.50, so logically shouldn't it be 2.50x + 1.25x as it's 50% of 2.50?I trully don't know as I just figure this out
---
And are they on peaks or are they lower?
---
Or learned how to use Google.
---
Thanks I haven’t gotten a lot of feed back on this and I really feel like they blew a major story telling element here
---
Or people who enjoy fun?
---
It was advertised as a challenging area, not quite a raid challenge but something that would require a team of high levels to slog through.
---
What we got was a couple of tunnels with ghouls that feels like a walk in park.
---
Someone here advised me to remove Healing Factor mutation and said it would fix it. I reluctantly gave in and wiped my mutations until HF was removed and I reapplied my other lost mutations. Two weeks later and I've only gotten the fast travel bug twice since. So it didn't fix it entirety, but it reduced it dramatically.
---
I just realized how intuitive carnivore could be. Just replace my serendipity with good with salt and dodgy with the thing that reduces food weight and you have a pretty great build. Hate to steal such creativity though. (And would hate even more to cure my marsupial mutation.)
---
I thought we were boycotting this shit wtf guys y'all are spineless
---
What kind of... ”issue”?
---
Can someone link the stream?
---
Starting to think of goro. lOl
---
Well as long as you haven't spam posted please give me everything you've grinded years for like end game weapons and materials and just begging In general. that's awesome. Glad people are helping you. Since game pass introduced fallout 76 I've grown to hate the new players just due to constant posts of begging I'm new please give me everything. I even stopped running silos because of that. But hey if you're not doing that awesome! There's hope for my prejudice :)

Do you know if I can get more off of her by hopping or do I need to use a different character now that I've already bought stuff?
---
Im online now
---
Thank you. Such an honour
---
Wow that's is fucked.
---
I always thought it was in the base game originally because it's just like any other high level area with lots of ghouls.
---
It's stupid it wasn't added as a temporary fast travel point even if you've not discovered it yet. The people who will benefit the most from the rewards are low level players who are also the least likley to have found it yet. 
---
I took time out from my L230 to level my L10 and thankfully a team member had a camp nearby...i say 'nearby', it was still a long walk up the rail tracks to claim those 3 boxes.
---
I’d call that “best day ever!”
---
Xbox here.
---
Multiple crashes and freeing a day.
---
Yeah - this has been mentioned a lot. No worries. Some people still might not know.
---
It depends.
---
Go for it, and no need to get rid of marsupial. On the contrary, get most of the mutations, stack them up. Depending on your armor situation, you can grind out the fridge backpack, voila no need for goodw/salt  Thru hiker is a must however👍.
---
I think the last time I got wanted was over a year ago when I dropped my controller at a friend’s camp and shot something at his camp.
---
Ah, my bad
---
One or those 'AHHHHHHHHHHHH' moments before I settle down for bed
---
I don't disagree. I have a couple of Bloodied builds, but my main is an underpowered stealth-pistoleer with 1-hand-melee seconday Mistress build. Both could really use buffing.
---
Upvote as I'm from old Kent road myself 👌
---
Not halfway across the map. Id say about 100-150 clicks away
---
They arnt right next to the entrance though
---
It would be if it weren't for the lousy one star drops but oh well haha
---
I drop the .ba2 files in my Fallout76/Data folder.
---
Then you need to enable them with a Fallout76Custom.ini you create in your MyDocuments/Fallout76 folder. There should be documentation on how and what lines you add on the nexus
---
Wait, you are talking about the game, right?
---
Still an issue, I've submitted a ticket. Really hope this gets addressed soon. Even though it's an entirely optional portion of the quest I really want Rocco dead so I guess I'll hold off until its fixed :/
---
It’s all good, mate. Enjoy the rest.
---
My camp is a maze as well. Since the patch, I cannot change the wall into a doorway and walk through, I have to traverse the whole damn maze now. I have one single vendor that I try to keep stocked with one free item, usually it’s a shitty legendary for anybody that is willing to get through the maze. But it’s free. 
---
Surprisingly, the amount of plans and ammo and guns that I have in the other vendors keeps people coming to shop. About 3 to 6 people an hour deep in the Ash Heap.
---
Same, I haven't played since I posted this.
---
I missed all the parts I knew I wouldn't enjoy. Picked it up after Wastelanders came out. I knew buying it before then would be trash, at best, because while id made Quake- and the OG, actual creator of the word "deathmatch", Doom- little of that is involved with Bethesda. Speaking of knowing what we're talking about, Bethesda doesn't have any subsidiaries it leverages. ZeniMax does, though, the company that actually owns id.  
---
Nuclear Winter is bad because it was always going to be, and it should give all the expectations of what future PvP content will look like. What cash cow from other PvP games do you see and hate? Expect to see it if Bethesda went for PvP. It requires too much resource to attempt to create an entirely balanced and original system from scratch. That's why one big attempt gets made to change the landscape every so often, and then all the other major devs copy it.   
---
So, no, I didn't miss it. Feels like I called it pretty right. Picking up FO76 after Wastelanders dropped, I've gone looking on reddit about aspects of the game, and all I come upon most of the time are year-old posts about all the aspects of the game that were always going to be present until they went the direction Wastelanders is attempting to bring the game.  
---
But yeah, I have no idea what I'm talking about because I'm not expecting Bethesda Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks to be able to leverage the creative talent of separate corporate entities who are not involved in the creation of their project. Simply having talent in a company doesn't mean that it gets leveraged on each and every project they're working on.
---
Now I'm getting a bit of a mad scientist feeling cause I'm trying to map out the build in a document and I'm starting to think about the possibilities of a carnivore bloodied build. Combining the two will certainly be experimental but OP honestly made me feel like I could get a bit more creative.
---
Yeah I’ll place u one now
---
I would think again... this is bethesda we’re dealing with here
---
I guess but the only viable harpoon is the quad. Reloading after every shot is just too much of a hit to damage.
