))) good point

Either that... or target for a hunting party
---
Tell me more about this festive grandma skin ?! I hope it's like an ugly Xmas sweater rather than the Silence of the Lambs thing I'm picturing.
---
Ya I’m sitting on tons of perks, however I can’t believe there is no to spend caps option to respec? You can’t try out a new build just for fun without completely re rolling, if it’s your main you have limited perk re rolls so you can’t spend freely. Not to mention we could use more cap sinks.
---
Dude... play Outer Worlds, lol. It's great.
---
My life in Appalachia is basically player vendor hopping, hoping to stumble across any legacy explosive energy weapon cuz I missed out when they were around, even though I know it'll never happen. Same boat, but with one character, where I float around at max caps just... doing... nothing. YET. I. KEEP. PLAYING.
---
88 for bloody ffr handmade . I currently dont own any handmades...
---
That is crazy, I just saw it for the first time last night. I was like scammers???? Lol
---
I can relate. Probably a month ago that happened to me. Except I had probably 4 others and we couldn't take her down. I ended up just farming the violet flux and went back to camp.
---
Yes! I meant to include this in the original post. How could I leave it out? Thanks for reminding me.
---
Troll level 9000
---
Please do this every week.
---
Anything else y'allwant to complain about?...like the way they wear their clothes?
---
Yes, and if you can't see the difference you're already fucked.
---
Journalism can be bad or good, but there are agreed rules and those who break them are held up to contempt.
---
People who accuse all journalism of being corrupt admit of no oversight, they deny that it is even possible to try to be objective or informative.
---
The first thing a liar says is *all the others are the same*.  That is his biggest and most dangerous lie.
---
It was too good, I couldn't resist...
---
The caution DOES stop the regeneration stuff, you can counter that with the photosynthesis perk that regenerates health during the daytime but I think that's a waste of perk space. Also, while in caution you can still gain your x3 sneak damage with the sneak perks equipped
---
Me either, you just beat me to it
---
Haha I agree 100%
---
🤣
---
I mean, have you seen how Todd and Pete dress? It's an affront to good senses and taste...
---
I have a 50 Cal Sniper Rifle Bloodied explosive.
---
It can put out insane amounts of damage per Shot. 600 x 3
---
It is pretty much useless at SBQ fight.Too much happening to make it practical.
---
I tried using a Bloodied Minugun at SBQ ,that also was not practical.Going through Stimpacks for very little damage gain.Running with low health and all the Heavy Gun Perks i was lucky to get 90+ damage per [shot. Wieghing in at a whopping 20.00 + So](https://shot.So) i got rid.
---
Using the same Heavy Gun perks with an AAE Gatling,running with full health ,using the same Ammo,i can get 200+ per shot..
---
50 Cal Machine Gun uses up too much Ammo for me.
---
They try very hard to give you an offer you can’t resist like a legacy weapon or something very rare but the catch is you have to give them the item first or worst of all scammers are JUNK scammers they want to buy a lot of JUNK then they send you a team invite and BOOM he shoots his scamming partner and kill you, take your junk and leave OR they tell you to come to their camp and they have traps so you can die and lose your junk
---
I too lost my pirate hat!
---
I know right it's like somehow we've all turned into ghouls just looking for our next chem fix.
---
That's it! That is the secret agenda of Bethesda! We're all doomed to become Hancock!
---
OP, in all seriousness I've never submitted a ticket but I have heard horror stories. I guess it depends on what you submit, I hear anything Atom Shop related warrants a quicker response than bugs, glitches, etc.
---
I meant more that they aren't bringing income. Bethesda might care about player numbers to get funding, but would a parent company care if they aren't generating revenue off those players?
---
I just don't know the economics, so apologies if I seem ignorant.
---
I have over 1600hrs in the game so yeah that must be it. No I'm tired of Bethesda stringing everyone like myself along for what is sure to be disappointment. You really think a multi billion dollar company cant get a team to jump on this game it debug it in 12 months.
---
Wait... People play this garbage?
---
Paragraphs, bitch, learn to use them.
---
I never trade with anyone,  if do its someone I know
---
How could he put that on his website?  He doesn't know it because he doesn't play the game.
---
Don't expect it to be like FO4. So I expect npcs to be in particular cells and stay inside a region. The story is going to be cheesy fetch quests and nothing you do actually impacts the world.
---
I wish these were for ps4
---
In two months, auto repair robots will somehow be interpreted as pay to win and dominate the sub with a fresh batch of complaints for a solid week.
---
[deleted]
---
Thanks, that makes more sense.
---
Key tips 1)never have junk on you and 2) dont trade/ drop items for someone you don’t know
---
What stops a person from changing their gt and be untraceable?
---
The control to select body parts is the same as your movement making it difficult to use
---
When are you gonna talk to us about Bailout1st?
---
Ive had it persist through server changes. But only for a couple hours. If you walk far enough, you will eventually fall through the terrain. A workaround I found is jumping in the water, as swimming mechanics come into play. But soon after where you would fall through the terrain, theyou get a loading zone error message and the game crashed
---
Yeah, they were bold to try and require a $15/mo subscription fee out of the gates on top of the $60 price tag. To this day that is why I've never touched ESO.
---
still enough to make some juicy half millon videos on youtube talking about it
---
It did not sell well at all. The game cost at least $100 million and only sold maybe 2-3 million copies. While Fallout 4 sold around 11 million.
---
I never trade. I put the items in my vendor.
---
I was talking about the .50 machine gun. Assasins only works on players, and its a really weak effect that needs a buff. Shotguns are in a bad place now and have been for a long time.
---
yea tell me about it
---
i have 15 characters and they are all pretty much full with caps
---
last time i checked i had somewhere around 350k caps
---
0,5 lb
---
I just wanted to clarify as ESO Plus and Fo 1st are very similar in content offered.
---
 river there runs full tilt.  read an article, sprinkle opinion sell sell sell.  new gold Rush coming through
---
The only time I've been remotely close to engaging in class war actions was when some one with the freaking protectron dance had the audio playing the entire time that the Project Paradise event was going on. I was about to open fire on that person myself, because it was so utterly distracting during the event. If you want a 1st subscription, fine I've got no problems what you do with your money, but keep the idiotic sound effects and distractions to yourself especially during events. 
---
This is probably an unpopular opinion among people who are 1st subscribers, but maybe those 'dances' and sound effects should stay on the 1st sub in your Private world and shouldn't actually work in the public servers since people aren't policing themselves and are making a spectacle during events.
---
"We have decided to drop support of the game. We will maintain a small crew to finish and release Wastelanders. With this in mind we are shooting for summer 2022. Feel free to continue your 1st membership as no new content is coming."

Luckily I don't value the opinion of useless twats. And I wrote it in 5 mins of a 10 min break at work something all those worried about the grammer will never understand anyways since I'm sure their idols Kim K use proper grammer all the time. Not directed at you of course but thanks for the advice.

Of course like ugly Xmas sweaters, not the skin of  grandmas lmao.

The ranger coat was the one thing I wore along with my owl head at Mischief Night. I even did the mothman dance a couple times while the goals were updating. No one gave a shit and were even amused by what I was doing. 
---
Where is this mythical "class war" going on?
---
They will keep on ignoring everything thanks to the dumb cunt 1st subscribers.
---
You do realize probability, ther thing the op said, is exactly about multiple events?
---
 For which weapon?
---
That seems rather weird.  I haven't heard much about performance drops in Morgantown, but I can relate because for me, Whitesprings is almost always a chugging disaster.  Not unplayably bad, but noticeably sub-60 fps with a fair bit of stuttering.  While it's obviously popular with CAMPs, which bog things down when they spawn, I'm convinced there's something endemic to the Whitesprings area itself that's very taxing.
---
I have 1st and I don't play on private servers very often because I like the random interactions of other players and vending things, both of which you'll miss.  The one thing that the private servers excel at is responsiveness with respect to terminals and timers.  Pretty much any scenario on a public server where you're standing around muttering "OMG, get on with it" doesn't happen on private.
---
Yeah, few months, I was mad when mine spontaneously just disappeared along with my t-60 set of power armour, i emailed Bethesda, but you know.
---
Nope. Tried that. It says the lake near Grafton. After all that lake ia closer to Clarksburg than Grafton. Makes you wonder why it's called the Grafton dam and Grafton steel.
---
OK boomer.
---
I wonder how much they are paid
---
The overseer for me was bland af. The real good voice acting for me is a lot of the flavour stuff like Colonel, the lady in the storage closet at Morgantown Airport, Abby and a few others. Rose was pretty good too, as annoying as she was (which seems to be the intended effect).
---
Yes!
---
Ok everyone it’s been bout an hour I’m stopping this now and I’ll review the numbers picked and post your names in a few . Thanks to everyone
---
It's a sliding scale. People liked 3 more than 4, 4 more than 76. Does that mean they'll like 76 more than Wastelanders following this trend?
---
Ive always felt the community has been pretty small, especially the last few months. Everytime I’d play, every server had a few (player) names I’d recognize, making it hard to believe there’s a million active players.
---
Getting an upvote just for the typo!
---
It was definitely weird. I don't remember having \*that\* much lag in Morgantown on AM worlds, either. So it was really odd to see Morgantown being so much worse on the private world, but Flatwoods being so much better. It didn't really make much sense.
---
As far as your mention of responsiveness with respect to terminals and timers, I didn't have a lot of interactions with timers but my terminals, menus, and logging in/out were all pretty consistently better. Hell, when I play AM and then logout the game actually continues to hog my system's resources to the point that I usually reboot, but after playing a private world and then logging out my system would actually recover quite fast. So it did seem like there were improvements... just not the kind that really matter. Roaming the world and shooting things needs to be as smooth as possible the majority of the time, and at least in my first 20 hours that was nowhere near the reality. xD
---
But given that most of my slideshows were initiated by enemy encounters, it seems like something that \*could\* be fixed, if Bethesda is putting the time into it. For all I know a lot of my lag was caused by having more enemies around me than in most AM games-- and maybe particularly scorched, which I think are problematic in other ways in this game, though molerats were also giving me some chop.
---
That's fallout 76, I'm only talking fallout 1st, the sub, is apparently doing better than even they expected
---
&gt;so make sure you enjoy looking at the Empty Pumpkin Rack
---
This is where I laughed through my nose. Great job.
---
I bet people said that about Valve and Half Life 3 :p
---
69 for the win for the bffr!
---
Why would someone downvote this? My understanding is atomic shop stuff (refunds) get a response super fast but this entire sub is filled with horror stories regarding game tickets.
---
I have two XB1's and I play on both at the same time .. my one, the game crashes all the time for no reason, the other one runs fine, never crashes, so it depends.
---
Definitely try clearing your cache as well.
---
Likely the reason for Whitesprings, and possibly morgantown poor performance would be due to large number of npcs in relatively small area.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sadly this is a historical issue with FO3 (in city) , F:NV (new vegas general area, hence multiple zones instead of one for city), Oblivion (cyrodiil, especially battle scenes), Skyrim ( any battle scene hence low number of combatants), FO4 (downtown boston) simply being that so many NPCs especially if they are in conflict with another faction makes the game more and more unstable with the performance issues to go with it. More powerful PC helps with issue/s but won't get rid of it.
---
As for your question about shadows, is that they are still there, merely the imagespace modifier is different as being night, they won't be as obvious, not sure if it would make a difference to performance but doubt it. If you think shadows are an issue for your PC then recommend you disable them entirely as that would make a difference.

Remember when we used to drop stuff and our bags fell through the map?

Hey, I mean, some people genuinely like getting pooped on. Like, they enjoy it. Obviously I can't account for everyone's tastes.
---
Enjoy your poop.
---
Hey, I can tell you this. It's the top RPGMMO right now. It beat WoW. This last expansion really brought alot of people. And it just has changed alot since day one, even One Tamriel. The sub is worth it now imo cause you get all the expansions free plus the crowns and unlimited space. It's worth getting to beat a dlc or 2 in a month
---
Hey are you around? I need to get this to you  before I log off
---
Grenadier doesn't effect explosive weapons. 
---
Also, demolition expert is wasted on explosive pistols. It only applies to the explosive part of the damage. 
---
Let's say your base damage is 100 + 25% for the explosive effect 125 damage total.
---
Those 5 points in denolition only effect 25 of the damage only the explosive part of it. So you'll only add like 6 damage for 5 perk points. It's a waste of Special points unless you're using missles or grenade launchers.
---
Ah, so the ones saying men not only have a right to have an abortion but a right to federally funded abortions are playing by the agreed upon rules, but the ones saying Trump's a 4d chess master are the ones not.

Take it back Project Paradise is one of the only good events we have
---
How can bethesda keep fallout going for 5-6 years adding new content without a little extra help? Dont forget after the 2nd week it was free with thumb grips... without some support it will go the way of anthem
---
I'm shocked! Shocked and appalled!
---
Do you remember when Russia was the USSR? How about "separate but equal"? By you're logic way to go Putin and water fountains for all. 
---
Obviously this is euphemistic relative to a game but it's a good example of why progress is a shitty lense to try and judge something through.
---
Bethesda has done a relatively good job in the progress department but the game as a whole has rarely been in a good spot.  And in some respects it's regressed with pushing back Wastelanders and FO1.
---
Ok. I guess I must of messed it up. Thanks.
---
 Everyone always has stuff they're looking for.  My level 282 character runs out of water from time to time. Sure, I don't "need" free stuff, but if you tell me you're giving out free stuff specifically for high-level players, it's not "greedy" to take a look.  People will probably think you're giving out high-level "junk" legendaries.  Some of us do that when we hit the limit on stash space, scrip and caps.
---
Manually trapping people you catch in a room marked "Low levels only" sounds a lot more fun. Remember, you get a notification whenever someone takes something from your vendors. Just check their level on your map and try to get there fast enough to throw the switch.  Sure, some will get away, but you get the benefits of witnessing it all and only killing those who actually deserve it. 
---
Side note: multiple radiation emitters don't stack rads, but the rad damage does have a falloff range.  Just spread them out close enough to make sure the entire floor gets the full 30 rads per second. Here's a reference for the rad damage dropoff: https://i.imgur.com/mikrI3N.jpg
---
Cheers
---
For sure, the more you had saved up before that first shot the more that first shot hurt.
---
Thank you what perks should I take instead
---
Would it kill that NPC for everyone on the server?
---
Either your end or the game itself, not private servers. Private servers are very stable.
---
Try reinstalling maybe, otherwise you’ll need to wait for optimisation improvements.
---
Right, or in the ice box by the golf club door.

Hey you know the Summersville Dam?
---
The closest town near the Dam is called Gad, not Summersville, so it should have been called Gad Dam.
---
Yes
---
Range hit register? You mean range attacks not registering as hits? It’s not just ranged, melee attacks don’t always register either. And it’s both VATS and manual.
---
Here's a grand idea, if you don't want spoilers, or "content ruined" for you, don't watch the videos or read the articles about it. 
---
I understand that you hate it, that you consider it cheating.
---
Personally, I don't have the free time to sink hours trying to figure out the steps to gain a cosmetic item in a game. So please, give me the steps so I still have the opportunity to enjoy the content and still put in the hours to put food on the table for my children and pay the bills.
---
Don't start badmouthing others for their choices while gaming when you don't know where there coming from.
---
It’s because people keep paying them money. Why would they keep wasting money on fixes when everyone is buying atom shop items and fallout 1st?
---
I gave away literally every outfit I gained. I always put them in the costume box at the start point of the event.
---
Yes, too bad there isn’t a way to award the entire server by doing the event particularly well or even just as a random occurrence. Maybe even with a server wide notice: Player X has fed all the people.
---
I can live with the little funny bugs from previous titles but Fo76 drives me crazy some days to the point of rage quitting this is not the average Bethesda title and if you have played you would not imply it is.
---
For me I actually have to resort to using Melee to kill things but yeah I heard about melee not registering on first contact but like never about it completely not working. That being said this is completely inexcusable.
---
Da fuck does Trump have to do with Fallout 76 😂
---
Link is broke
---
Yes. I also get the enemy audio lag. You kill a mutant, then you hear him speak and then hear the death scream. Initially I thought another player was stealth sniping at first.
---
Never happened to me tbh and I play only private and everyday for the most part
---
I put a month in on this game.... as in I played for 6-8 hours a week for 4 weeks. The only "fun" I had was meeting cool people that were already level 100+. This game still feels pre-alpha (if that's even a thing) after being out for over a year. It's just a re-mapped/skinned cash grab with a few new creatures.
---
It's not ALWAYS greedy, I know. 
---
But a large chunk of higher levels are VERY greedy, and I don't get why. 
---
They have higher level items, a wider range of collection places, and know more things about the game. 
---
Yet they say: "*Hmmm...* free stuff, and a sign that says 'low level, take what you need'... ALL MINE!"
---
It just gets annoying
---
The vast majority of people on the Fallout subreddits seem to think Emil is still the lead writer for Bethesda games, while he left that position a good while ago.
---
I have this problem and I hate it, showed up a few patches ago, I haven’t figured out a workaround

---
Sounds like something a synth would say...
---
Now you get it. Lol.
---
I'd be willing to test it - personally I think at least a month ahead of full release they should put it on test servers to at least knock out some of the large common bugs
---
When I log on later I'll check my stash I'm certain I have sometging I can hook you up with.
---
I don’t actually agree with some of the features like the scrap box. That should be available to everyone, not just those of us that have the sub. The servers though, should cost money. They cost Bethesda money to run so if they were free, they’d be a drain. It makes to charge for them. The atoms are ok too, they sweeten the deal.
---
It’s mostly the scrap box and deals on atom shop stuff.
---
Thank you I would really appreciate that
---
Do you want to send me a friend request
---
Here's another. 
---
https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Fallout-3-so-loved-and-Fallout-4-so-hated
---
I know it’s relative, but realistically if you can’t afford 15 aud a month for everything you get in 76 you can’t afford to buy any in game purchases, which means it’s not a case of the price being too high but a case of the person just barely earning enough to support themselves.
---
Have you tried subscribing to fallout first?  I heard that might prevent the glitch.  Oh, and while you’re at it, feel free to take a look around the atomic shop.  There are many bargains.  
---
(And do it before end of fiscal quarter please.  Investors are watching)

I Member
---
All of the reviews were and are good now. FO76 was panned by critics and review bombed into shit. And it plays better now than FO4 plays now.
---
Also check the wiki the game was generally well accepted at launch with good reviews as well.
---
You can't offer shit for free and expect anyone and everyone to not take it, no matter who you are visibly catering to...if it's free, people will take. I could have given you the result without the social experiment.
---
Psn matt0927
---
Yeah i really do too. It really sucks. I even got 5 kills one match and i still only got about 400 points.
---
It most definitely was not I still remember playing at launch and after reading a review or two I refused to read anymore as I personally loved the game and for that matter I love Fo76 I just don't see where Bethesda really cares about it beyond getting us to spend our money on it constantly.
---
For me it doesn't happen.
---
But when the server lags or for whatever reason, there would be unkillable enemies that looks like mob models that are not fully loaded.
---
Added I'm going to see what I got
---
One night, while about to log off at about 3 am, I found a guy with 40 jetpacks and 140 calibrated shocks for X01. I spent every last Cap I had that night, about 15k. 30 jetpacks and 60 shocks, and my customers bought them so damn fast.
---
I don't know they did some pretty good games but they have had their fair share of meh and bad games to I enjoy a good Obsidian RPG and I have both Fallout New Vegas and The Outer Worlds but I also remember buying Dungeon Siege 3 and Tyranny from them..... So claiming they would just be amazing at everything is kind of just well Fanboi specially since they have no MMO titles under their belt.
---
Thanks I would offer to give you caps but I just spent it all on a powerfist
---
Hey, I'm with you on that. I was just pointing out some of the problems with killing *everyone* who enters the "high level" room.
---
It's cool if you just want an reason to kill people (the username is kind of a dead giveaway) but I'm just saying, a lot of times it won't be justified.
---
My Commando plays with two Fixers and a 10mm SMG.  Clearly the SMG isn’t as good as the other weapons (even with the same modifiers, B25), but I like that I can waste 10mm with it rather than .45s.
---
if its a weapon in the game it should be viable no matter if anyone uses it or not - they should at least have a niche 
---
I even run a heavy medic in power armor that used to use a shotgun when he was just walking around on foot but its gotten so bad my poor Anti armor explosive pump can't even kill a freaking brahmin unless I'm in melee range while a lower lvl pistol murders them fine
---
Oh, and I meant to say twice in a wave of 7-8 enemies, not 7-8 times.
---
I don't post because I hate the game. I post because I enjoy it and want to see it get better. You people make it seem like any criticism is pure hate. Bethesda has always done the bare minimum when it comes to their games. They have relied way to much on modders. If they aren't pushed to fix this game they will leave it like it is. They don't have modders to hold their hands this time. They have to actually do the work.

Talk to BSG about your issue, they made the Damn vending machines to offer to everyone regardless of your wants and needs. Don't expect anything that is free/heavily reduced price to be around long, high or low level shoppers.

For some reason the Wikipedia page for FO76 says he is... If he isn't, who is? Is it all design by committee?

👀
---
Well I'm just wrong on all bases. Lol
---
I'm a fan of the game and I wanted it to success until they decided they wanted me to pay $220 a year for shit that should be in the game for free like the scrap box.
---
As much as expected. A troll with no real knowledge of the game and no real opinion.
---
all hair styles should work on all genders. hair in the wasteland should not be so picky on how it is shaped.
---
To be fair...
---
The username has nothing to do with killing people. I've just been using this username on everything for about... idk, 8, 9 years now?
---
But imo, it's better safe than sorry. I'd rather kill a few innocent players than let the greedy bastards get away. 
---
Besides, if an innocent player messages me complaining, I'll open another door to a decontamination shower that will get rid of the rads for them. I might even give them a few stimpacks to go. Just to be fair
---
One point is worth getting. The facts: Exploding is 20% extra damage. The first point of Demo Expert is 20% more explosion damage, and each additional point is 10% more.
---
So let’s do the math.
---
1 point gives you 20% x 20% = 4% net damage.  Close to as good as Bloody Mess, pretty decent!
---
Points 2-5 give you 20% x 10% = 2% net damage. Not nearly as good as most damage buffs!
---
If you get all 5 Demo Expert points, you are only getting 12% more damage after all those points.  So only do this if you exclusively use Exploding weapons *and* have perk points to waste. I personally only recommend the first point,
---
Is there any chance of getting stuck in there or corrupting my char? If not I would love to see this myself but if you can please post pictures so we can see what you saw. Thanks.
---
You mean like the "PVPers vs Food Builds" elitism,  or the "I'm a Raider" excuse to act like a griefing asshole elitism?
---
No problems with those issues, but THIS is "harmful to the community" ?
---
The only "true divide" is between your logic and reality
---
Yeah FFR is better most of the time.  Exploding has an advantage if you can 1-shot with the extra damage or are able to hit groups.  Also, you may save ammo with Exploding over FFR.
---
Guess we don't get any karma lol
---
If you're okay can I have multiple if I can only have one can I have the bloodied plasma pistol 33 vats chance 250dr
---
Hahahaa
---
Thanks, how do you know?
---
So much for being a supposed "dead game" 
---
Watch the haters say it's because it's "Stockholm syndrome" or something like that, cause they apparently cannot comprehend the idea that people unironically *like* this game
---
5 points really isn’t worth it.  I provided the math somewhere in this discussion. Only the 1st point is a good value.
---
We all know it happened right? 🤪
---
it should but there are some that are gender exclusive hairstyles found that out the hard way
---
I remember that you needed to get naked for awhile be for leveling the world or you would mess up your carry weight, for awhile there.
---
they forgot to include games crashed during event
---
Hey, you do you. Hope ya get some good laughs
---
I actually enjoyed much of 4. Especially the undertones of the ethics of intelligent AI and killing them/making them slaves, and then the whole question if you actually were a synth yourself.
---
I have it. It is borderline too goofy. I want them to bring back the clean white skiing outfit.
---
I'll gladly hook you up with one. You may have the Bloodied Plasma
---
Sorry, I run a shop lol. If you're interested in others I'll trade or sell them when you have caps. Most of these are not for sale right now.
---
Let me know when you can log on and I'll give it to you.
---
Honestly, Reddit can fuck itself sometimes. They all think that because you didn't specify that you didn't want advice in the post that you actually do want and NEED it. It's such a weird thing to bring up with someone you don't know, but everyone here acts as if you invited it. Nobody thinks to *not* be *that* guy.
---
I agree 💯 that Obsidian has put out some crap too ( I shivered at the mention of Dungeon Siege 3). BUT I never said that "they were amazing at everything" , I just said they'd not be having the issues that Bethesda is in the buggy-ness of FO76 were they running the franchise. And to be fair FO4 still remains my fav in the franchise, followed very closely by FONV. I just feel like Bethesda has gone downhill badly.
---
I love it. It’s goofy enough for me. Have a screen cap of another player in my camp with it on. So jealous. If they do bring it back with the ski outfit, it’s be super cool.
---
Ok shill
---
Thank you I'll be sure to save up my caps for the others
---
+karma thank you so much!
---
+karma welcome !
---
You've learned nothing.
---
i almost wish there wasnt a hazmat suit to force me to use PA
---
I e been having same issues!  It’s so random too
---
Friendly reminder that New Vegas released downright unplayable because Obsidian thought they could bum rush it out and refused a more lenient dev schedule when BGS was offering. So assuming "This would never happen if they were running the show" is simply selective memory at it's finest.
---
Fun Fact: IRL one of the TNT domes is known as "The Mothman's Lair"
---
Aye. Fucking dispicable they take away the best pvp game mode in favour of battle royal and private servers.
---
Usually I just make my own radio mods for seasons, like only an hour ago I went through each olde/classic christmas song and replacing with respectable length to each of the ones from fallout 76.
---
Now I have never ending nightma-...christmas songs playing round my camp 🤪
---
First thing encountered with a friend during beta
---
A little help? 100 bucks a year is outrageous and a sham For how little you get
---
Because of the way it is.
---
Crickets.
---
Sorry, I would love to help but I've played nw once.
---
You may as well go and kick a dead horse with a boot made of marshmallows because Bethesda will never change
---
Source?
---
The didn’t exactly said they couldn’t, they just said they had to do so slowly and test how it affects the servers. Using first is a good way because people are paying them to develop it and it reduces the amount of strain on the server from tinkering with stuff like that. A lot less people have 1st so they can be Guinee pigs. 
---
Scrap is also identical too so really you just have to track the same amount of item types .
---
Long dogs! I almost forgot about those
---
I hated that the mohawks were gendered. Truly I hate that any hair is gendered. I would of bought all the mohawks if they were unisex.
---
Those days have returned. They removed the damage minimum in the last patch so all it takes is one hit and hiding till she's dead.
---
bump
---
id love to see them bring legendary power armor into play, say for instance you can craft a part with a legendary roll if you know how to make it's parts. Example the Excavator could be rolled as a legendary if you buy a legendary module and use it to craft a new part with the piece. maybe 1 module per star you want to try to roll.
---
That would be giving Bethesda far more credit than they deserve.
---
So I went through the credits for FO76, and he's listed as the Design Director, which is indeed his 'new' job at BGS. He's not credited as one of the quest designers/writers. While this does indeed mean he probably had some oversight on the general gist of the way quests would play out or the design/atmosphere of the world so it'll be a coherent whole, since 'design director' is such a broad title that probably has many wider responsibilites, he's not primarily a writer and likely does not do anything regarding actually putting the words to a script.
---
Also, as /u/Riomaki said, the atmosphere of FO76 is quite well-done despite the game's other flaws, which means Emil's doing his job capably. The man's writing certainly isn't perfect, but he's done some good work in his time.
---
I love this idea.  Even a toned down version that shows ghoulification in a simpler way would be cool.  The wasteland of West Virginia is really missing a lot of the waste part if you ask me.
---
They’ve done the bare minimum for this trash all while adding anything remotely cool to the overpriced atom shop and then to top it off, asked for $100 extra for extra QoL features. Posts like this make my ass mad haha
---
Its 30k now and yes you lose the caps. Lost about 3000 caps yesterday. Was playing dangerously close to 30k, about 28k and a real big spender hit my camp and was buying lots of stuff. It's all I could do but quit to dashboard on the guy to avoid losing anymore. Now when I'm over 25k I close my vendor's.
---
It pays for itself in atoms as well as saves time not managing junk mules the scrap box was the biggest selling point for me I had 6 miles with junk sorted now it's all on 1 character I dont have to load a mule everytime I need flux for something
---
How much do your legendaries normally cost
---
Definitely not enough.
---
I remember playing the beta and paying full price on release, and now I drop in once every few weeks to do nothing.
---
Those eyes resemble the eyes of Stevie Nicks.  I don’t like Stevie Nicks.  I’m not lying.  She’s scary.
---
Anyone who has even a shred of goodwill to them considering all the shit they have tried to pull/did pull....I'm sorry but they deserve it. 
---
You can't fix stupid: If people are still supporting them even after all the bait and switch with cosmetic microtransactions or the special edition bag or the bugs from previous games showing up in 76 despite some of them being fixed by their own community in 4....... and now they have the balls to put up a 100$ subscription???? 
---
You can only feel so bad for so long for some of these people, they keep making the choice to go back and play or spend money on this garbage. 
---
Even If you have fun with it to ignore everything that has been wrong with it/is wrong with it and for some of these people to also be upset at times like it would be anything new blows me away.
---
Well I want to make my own because of my nature of approach but I still appreciate it. If you ever find yourself on a dark path in the playstation Appalachian mountains, his light will shine on you at the Appalachian church
---
Seems legit
---
Perk would be nice. My endgame hunt right now is aggravating. Trying to get a full set of Weightless Reduced Weapon weight scout armor so I don't have to worry about carrying every gun imaginable on my Jack of All Trades build.
---
They're definitely not fresh servers. Logged in and all the ghouls at Whitesprings were level 9 and 15. I'm over 100.
---
Remember when...
---
You couldn't fix the token machine at Prickett's Fort and couldn't complete that quest?
---
You had about a 90% chance to crash during Scorched Earth?
---
The entire lobby of WS was filled with robots that wouldn't stop spawning?
---
All the trash cans and vendorbots at WS would be filled with legendaries?
---
When no one realized you had to inspect 3\* legendaries to see what the other 2 effects were, so for a time you could get some epic gear for next to nothing?
---
The map had no camps marked on it and the game felt empty unless you went to WS or Watoga?
---
When Artisan's Corner was the place to be?
---
When slap damage was still a thing so you had to watch your back around other players?
---
Anyone could wreck your camp for no reason?
---
Jerks would set up turret bases right behind the Golf Club and kill all the ghouls before anyone else had a chance and lag the crap out the server with rocket launchers?
---
Wood armor would only drop as 1\*?
---
You would get drills and syringers from the queen instead of legendaries?
---
When you got rad worms and it doubled all the positive effects of all your mutations?
---
When you cured rad worms and it eliminated all the positive effects of your mutations?
---
When Bethesda had weekly events were you got buffs for doing certain things, like even more xp from sleeping or wearing certain outfits?
---
When there were no patch notes and you had no idea what you'd find when you logged in after a patch?
---
When you could always get a ton of stimpacks from the Watoga mayor's office?
---
0.001 x1000 is?
---
TL:DR : With all the previous signs and decisions the F76 Team has made you shouldnt be upset or have any goodwill left and if you do then that's on you for supporting something after they've lied so many times already.
---
They tend to bring stuff back for about a week especially the popular stuff. So I’m thinking pebbles is a good bet eventually. I’m just sad I missed the Camden park jumpsuit. The Halloween sale of almost all the bundles make me pretty good there will never be a exclusive one time offer except it was a cash bundle.
---
Actually, it does make sense:
---
Rifles are the most versatile weapons in the game, and their weight is usually the only liability. 
---
Your choice of mods also controls weight, as well as the accuracy, durability, stealth, and VATS capability. 
---
Weapon weight reduction armor is optional .
---
Choose wisely.
---
Ah okay. Sorry you didn’t get the jumpsuit.
---
RIP to newbie me deciding to go for a shotgun build.
---
What goodwill??? That shit left a long time ago...
---
I can’t comment of course on such a theory. 
---
But I just love how this community has so many delightfully creative role players.  It’s what gives Bethesda games decades of playability.  That, and the atomic shop of course. 
---
I would like to say something else though, while I’m here.  It’s about Stevie Nicks. She’s really overrated.  I’m not lying, nobody should listen to her music.  Ever.  
---
Ok. Thanks all!  Get ready for the next Elder Scrolls!  It’s going to have 16 times the fun of Skyrim!  16 times!
---
Reflex sights would be a godsend. I have an Anti-Armor one I use and that sight makes it a pain in the ass to use in 1st person.
---
r/usernamechecksout
---
It’s ok thank you for your advice
---
It also adds more headshot damage.  Easily tested with super mutants.  Anti-Armor+50% Limb is a very potent combo as well.
---
Yeah I use armor with weapon weight reduction
---
I love FO76!!!
---
yup I remember that and I had the DVD version with no updates till I got the DLC
---
Spending anytime in this games is a waste of time... they haven’t cared since the release.
---
It is good to finally see some positivity creeping back into this sub
---
No problem because you use pistols I'll sell them cheap or trade for stuff I use. I'm a Junkies Heavy weapons/melee build.
---
Oh also let me know when you can get the pistol. I put it in my stash for safe keeping
---
The first room *always* has a meat pile, that's a static spawn, I think it's story related, same with the dead ghoul in the corridor. What I **never** have encountered on a fresh private server (and it's my personal freshness indicator): pre-unlocked doors and safes. 
---
Even the double doors in Fort Defiance (that you have to push the button for to open) are always closed. And *nobody* who's been in there to loot the place has *ever* shut these doors again when seeing themselves out...
---
I'm willing to bet that because I'm barely level 50 I don't have anything of use
---
The best things I have are an anti armor deathclaw gauntlet
---
An explosive exterminators harpoon gun
---
And a suppressors auto grenade launcher
---
I can also trade ammo or buy I'm very low on caps since I've been buying mutations although I have at least 3,000
---
I'll be able to get on tommorow or Saturday at the latest
---
&gt;What does a level 280+ want with 10 bobby pins?
---
Hey, 10 caps is 10 caps  😐
---
&gt; skeleton crew
---
Made me my mind think there's a bunch of dev skeletons wearing the Old World Blues hazmat suit just sitting at a desk, entirely on autopilot.
---
Keep them. Also try out the Harpoon gun add the Fletchets mod and it's pretty freaking sweet.
---
Also because you're sub level 50 and still relatively I'll throw you a second gun
---
Yeah, because it just works.
---
Ok no problem
---
Damn they removed this wish I woulda took a screen shot lol
---
Yeah. I'm just leaving it at how the game was rigged from the start.
---
It’s been a ongoing issue for months now.
---
There is nothing wrong with ESO and it's generous content. The subscription in that game is worth what you pay compared to this nasty garbage so let me stop you right there.
---
I wish they’d make it a costume like Mr. Fuzzy. Or even just a head piece, and then wear it with the spacesuit.
---
well the last few nukes I have launched have now been back on public servers. I am capped out on scrip I have plenty of fluids and mass, and private server is boring without people to watch. definitely more enjoyable to launch on public servers. I think it will steadily pick back up once most of the high levels get bored of soloing it and mischief week is over. it will pick back up.
---
eso's justice system with the thieving is still such a amazing thing . Esp as its a whole other way of just making money.
---
yup this that carlo said. if you go through all the bullshit of reinstalling and it disappoints you again you will feel less urges to return :P
---
That’d be super cool, a Mr. Fuzzy outfit. One of my friends loves Mr. Fuzzy! He’d love that.
---
Excellent. This makes my start look like the first HALF of this post.
---
Yes, for a $200 subscription.
---
Thank you I only hit level 51 yesterday
---
I bought the mod plan but haven't leveled high enough to get gunsmith to use it
---
Thank you so much could I have the tse pipe pistol
---
&gt;Stealth shotgunning is pretty effective
---
That's the most immersive-breaking thing ever. Shotguns are loud. You can't silence them. Plus, any other silenced/Stealth build is 400 times better. You don't choose a shotgun to play like that. You choose the rifle, the silenced pistol, the knife. 
---
Shotguns are for going into battle, cursing the enemy, blasting away nv
---
I've played this dumpster fire for a year and get alot of enjoyment just from the multiplayer aspect I got a great crew I run with and if I wasn't playing this I would have easily spent $100 on other games
---
Would probably cost $100 a year
---
Sometimes, qffr crit spam works. Other times, it does not.
---
OMG I've had the exact same issue in the same spot. I kept talking to him to get him to move and even shot at him but he was stuck in some jump loop. Kept getting hordes of ferals and it just got annoying.
---
More like: Let stupid people, be stupid. They like to be f*ckd in the ass.
---
It’s Bethesda. I have no confidence they even care to fix the bugs. It’s just going to be released in an unfinished state and slowly patched over time.
---
I work for a company that has made some bad decisions before, but I have always spoke my mind on what is right. I didn't lose my job, and you won't either. By avoiding communicating with the people who are upset about the sub, doesn't only look bad on the company, it looks bad on you. Don't let Bethesda ruin that for you.
---
You really got the gears turning. I had forgotten most of this stuff. 
---
Also, remember when you had to go to Harper's Ferry or Watoga by level 25 to buy the Handmade Plan or else you'd have to grind Patrol Duty or Prison Break to have a chance at getting the plan to drop?
---
Of course you can. $20 per rifle.
---
i love it, its great, especially the prototype hazmat suit, its got +5 to grinding
---
but seriously i headshot for like 1400 and i don’t think anyone has seen me ever, i don’t even remember what i look like.
---
Yes! Good one.
---
What? Bethesda gave Obsidian 18 months to make NV. I’ve never heard anyone say otherwise until right now. Do you have a source?
---
Absolutely!! I'm always happy to help out a fellow Vault Dweller
---
oh I think i figured out the cause of the jet pack BS. low fusion cores. I could not get off the ground yesterday . I had just finished the queen fight. in my inventory I had a crap load of 1 and 2 % fusion cores. I threw all them away got out of my power armor took the 4 % fusion core out and reloaded with a 100. then it worked great. my theory is since it loads the lowest fusion core in inventory if you have low ones it gets bugged out trying to reload mid flight. not exactly tested extensevely. i do know low fusion cores play havoc with my laser gats and they get loading bugs. i expect power armor would suffer from the same issue.
---
Are you really thanking Bethesda? Lololololol.
---
Man, i hope they continue making hard for everyone who still defend them to play the game.
---
11 hours from now I will be on!  Paulbrett7
---
Eehhh... I don’t think that’s the main problem. Could be part of it i suppose.
---
In b4 wastelanders is released an unfinished bug infested mess that gets slowly patched over time. That’s gonna be 100$ a year, please.
---
It's nice to meet a giving vault dweller such as yourself
---
yeah
---
im 277 now.
---
thats just the way
---
the cookie bounces.
---
" Your PA must smell quite bad inside :) "
---
it smells like sweat, ozone from fusion core burn off,  and victory. and if I am in liberty prime it smells like america, :P
---
I also run 4 rifles, carry over 300 Stims, 150 dog food, radstag steaks, and run around with 275 weight and about 100 to spare
---
While playable ghouls and super mutants are something I'd like to see, I'd rather they hold off on that until the next single player fallout game.
---
right. I accept crafting sucks getting in and out and jump jets are no good for pvp. I am tanky and do medium hi damage as a junkie. i could be tankier at cost of dps or i could do better damage at cost of tankiness. cant have everything !
---
There's a lot of us out there. I'm around lvl 260ish (I stopped keeping track lol) once you have a good build and caps get easy to come by what's a few pistols amongst friends. 
---
I'd rather help a new friend than hoard these for the sake of hoarding.
---
The bourgeois will prevail
---
You have no idea of which post I'm talking about and are speaking in generalities. No, criticism isn't pure hate and that comment alone reminds of how idiotic people are on this subreddit. Also there isn't any "you people" here. I dont side with the brainless fanboys and I dont side with the cynicism of fools who left a long time ago and just like spewing hate cause it's not a bloody single player game.
---
This comment aged like milk.
---
" As far as I am concerned, the thing that keeps me out of PA the most is the sneak penalty, though. But I am unsure whether anything should really be done about that, to be honest. "
---
I feel like that would be imbalanced to allow you to sneak in PA as well. that and its just so bulky it wouldnt make sense to. stealth boys are good but the loud clanking is perfectly executed as is in my opinion. a pa user shouldn't be able to sneak very well.
---
Only recently I have noticed, I'm not getting disconnected much anymore.  This is great.  The frame rate however is distracting.  This should be improved.
---
This Suppressor mod says I can.
---
If you have to get up close to deal the most damage anyway, you might as well do it without drawing aggression and with a 2.5x damage bonus.  Ever since they were last tweaked, the damage falloff on shotguns has become very aggressive.  It's still good enough for proc'ing Enforcer, which relies on hits rather than damage, but for all intents and purposes, shotguns are "melee guns" in this game.
---
&gt;I bet it wouldn't have been anywhere near that big of a deal if Obsidian was running the show.
---
Right, that's why Obsidian had to ask Bethesda to step in and help fix FONV after it was released and was so damn buggy it would even load or if you got it to load it'd eat your save game files.
---
Yet you played Anthem. So not only do you know nothing about the game outside from biased Youtubers and crap reviews, you also enjoy even more alleged "mediocre" games then Fallout 76.
---
Again troll, your toll wasnt paid, so go back to your bridge.
---
It’s ok I later started really liking mr fuzzy but now the craze has temporary went down
---
You have to understand this kind of people. When a videogame "saves their lives", they start to make it their world. It doesn't matter if Todd Howard comes to torture them physically or sexually, they will still be thankful because their real lives are inside this kind of games. They probably would kill themselves in real life as well if the servers close for good.
---
These are the kind of people companies like Bethesda, EA, Activision / Blizzard, aim their products at.
---
There's no argument that would make them see reality. They only see the game, their game friends, and their lives inside the game.
---
LOLOL that TSE nerf almost made me uninstall. so I started out pistol got fairly high level and ran into a wall and swapped over to rifle. this was back in early early days I have been playing since beta. anyway swapped over to rifle and was doing a little better but pvpers were still kicking my butt all over the place. then after a lot of work i managed to save up enough to buy a tse gauss. I finally was able to start defending myself. not a win every time but if they made a mistake and i got a full charge lick in they were toast. I enjoyed being strong for about 2 days and then they nerfed it. man I was pissed.
---
Noted and thank you for the tip.
---
Please note that this is an opinion. I am in no way trying to offend anyone. Also like all purchases I make, I bought FONV over 6 months after initial release. Comparatively I didn't start playing Fallout 76 until January, giving them a few months to at least patch the initial product as technology should be far improved herein the 20 teens. I have and am been an active player of 76 and I feel like the bugs and glitches get worse as time progresses not better. of all games in the Fallout franchise I experienced the least in Fallout 4. I just feel like no matter what they try they're not getting 76 or right at this point and it makes me wonder if they ever will. Again all just my personal experiences and my personal opinions.
---
You know, it's been a while, but I seem to recall there was some challenge about this which actually meant photographing the river that runs behind Grafton Station, despite how it sounded.  Maybe that would work?
---
Unfortunately you are one of the few I've met
---
Here is an update to my build I plan to swap out demolition expert for gunsmith if the weapon isn't explosive
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=16148ff&amp;d=c72eh0pe2pb2s00ir2ib4a30a02al1au0ak1ap2ad2lv2lu0lk2lt2l12l71&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
it should work on both because of the perk card not designated between the two weapon types. only way to know for sure is to test it with tank killer on then off.
---
I never experienced a disconnect, but I did suffer my share of lag.
---
Its safe to say if you're still in it at this point you'll never leave. They've kicked the shit outta their fan base and people still try the "If you dont stop it i'ma leave!" card. Nothing short of shutting down the service will drive anyone still left away.
---
They both work with auto rifles. I run both.
---
 I don't have the link, but I was shown the ESM data where it showed there was no specification for auto/semi for either perk.
---
Not only do they both work for auto rifles... but ground pounder works for non-auto rifles as well, despite the description.
---
I would think it would be Grafton Lake which is situated near the pioneers camp. Where the event 'swarm of suitors' is...
---
all of those things individually yes. all together like that. no lol.
---
I don't know I was planning on Xbox but I did not buy the game until over six months after initial release and I never had a single problem with it no bugs no glitches no nothing. So that was my personal experience. Which left me feeling like obsidian did a better job with that game then what Bethesda is currently doing with 76. 76 has been running 4 almost a year now and I just feel like nothing is getting fixed. It's just frustrating
---
yes
---
I decided to try this tonight. Got on and went to Dyer Chemical and didn't find one stranger bloom. Joined another world and went to Dyer Chemical and this time I was able to pick 7 strangler blooms(14 with green thumb). The Heart of the Swamp wasn't going and it was dark.
---
So if they removed it, "they" must have been offended by the truth, as it is seen by the peons. Hitting a little too close to home it seems. I didn't get to see it but my wife did and she told me a little about what it said. Would love a link to read it somewhere if you still have it.
---
Congratulations! May the world (and wasteland) hold a loving future for you both!
---
That makes a lot of sense! Thank you
---
Bethesda went full on robbery since the release of fallout 76. I asked for a refund a year after release with a heartfelt message saying i had faith in them, defended them in youtube comments, And when i recently tried the game again, The lag was worse, some perks still simply dont work, Bugs everywhere. floating t pose scorched and things like that. When i asked for a refund they told me Everything works as intended and denied my refund. I made another ticket accusing them fraud and false advertising, their response was You downloaded the game so you are ineligeable for a refund. The only way this gets better is if we stop playing. Nothing else can work. Period.
---
I seldom post on here, because the criticism can be so harsh.
---
You'd think they'd realize after a post like this every week for months and months with zero progress.
---
similar threads have been posted dozens of times all ready. and my response to all of it is. life, life is an experiment man.
---
I love this game but i agree it suffers a lot of issues. I, nonetheless, want for it to succeed so bad. I hope it does. I really do. The idea and framework if FO76 is extremely AWESOME and unique, but was unfortunately, for a lack of better words, poorly, if not, terribly executed. Nonetheless, I'm excited and glad to see Bethesda still working on the game and releasing patches.
---
and the "it just works" meme is fucking old and dead can we please move on from that tired ass repetition. have an original thought of your own please.
---
Yeah I’m not sure on how to link it. Bullshit that they removed it and didn’t even bother to tell me.
---
I’m pretty keen on keeping an eye on this at least, I love editing the little videos I have and I usually bring them down to about 30 seconds. It has definitely been the culprit in the past but I try to keep it all under 10gb!

It would be sweet to find a group for couriers
---
That's fair I guess, but it's just annoying that the series has been around for this many years and we've never been able to play as anything but human, even though it's a really easy addition to the game, at least for ghoul characters.
---
I miss the tse days was more simple yet deadly time
---
Go to the island near the scout camp. That worked for me.
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
I have had very similar issues around morgan town in both public and private server. seems to hit when the ghouls are all rushing at once.
---
There were a bunch of complications for both of us. Ah, well. Over with and done.
---
please god no christmas carols
---
Yes so much yes please.
---
Remember when you’d exit a workbench and the game would forcibly re enter you onto it? Oh wait, that’s STILL a thing a year later 😂
---
There is a subreddit for groups. Fallout 76 factions. Try that in the search.
---
And it all comes down to how laggy the server is or isn't. Hit-reg is usually pretty awful in this game, especially as a melee user, but some times I get lucky to be in a good server with reasonable ping and the difference in hit-reg is night and day, on both ranged and melee weapons.
---
Are pipe pistols (not bolt action) affected by rifle and pistol perks
---
I remember there being some backlash when Feed the People became Feed yourself. People commented that it made sense that everyone on the server got some canned food, it IS called Feed the PEOPLE after all. Oh, and remember when those stew cans expired? How did that make any sense?
---
Pipe revolvers and Bolt actions are. I don't remember is this is one of those which double dips perks. I just saw pipe and used it for the description.
---
Just slap a rifle stock on it and see if it gets bonus damage from rifleman.
---
I play on PS4 as well and for the most part it’s pretty fair, once in a while you’ll come across somebody and the only thing that fucks up the encounter is a lag or some bad connection...
---
What would being a courier entail?
---
Same here have all limbs are 20% weight reduction (80% total).  If I also used a chest piece with 20% weapon weight reduction I'm guessing all you weapons are weightless.  As it is,  I can carry a TON of any weapon type as it reduces weight of any weapo not a specific class.

Thex for the input
---
Having the same issue on PC
---
Ha, I see what you did there.
---
That’s not true at all. Or can’t be. I can solo her all day as PA bloodied melee. The time it takes to kill her versus with others on a non private server is night and day. 
---
PS. Awesome kill.
---
I thought that was like it's only viable purpose lol
---
Wow tank you so much for this. Definitely gonna be looking at this in the future
---
so basically every mmo ever created
---
Being a delivery guy for trades basically

melee, 1\* vampire switchblade as a primary weapon.
---
Made L150 last weekend,  Can’t complain too much
---
That’s another list - things that should have been fixed by now but still haven’t. Uh, Trade Glitch?
---
I just want a supressor.  They do really exist in the real world BGS.
---
It does not.
---
I have to say I agree with this.  It’s 16 times too old.  16 times.
---
It's the most aggravating bug I've had to deal with day to day. Hopefully it will one day be fixed, I hate having to selected a location 7 to 8 times.
---
I honestly don't understand how your performance got so bad. Know I've been through a few of the places you've mentioned, and nothing, all performs great
---
Are you on PC? If so add me on discord TheGeminaii#0917 I’ll hook you up
---
I would like to see it in game, but tbh. just as many players want to play want to play as ghouls i want to play as a protectron. They could add the parts system from automatron dlc instead of armors and it would be lit. Bethesda plz, i'll pay for it! Just give it to us!
---
They work. I've been incredibly lucky, in 900 hours I've gotten nearly 30 pies. My bf has gotten 4 in that time. 
---
The nuke silo machines are always kind to me.
---
Absolute bs to force everyone into a bloodied build if they want reasonable damage to deal with bullet sponges.
---
They don't have ammo weight perks and haven't figured out the game will be throwing tons of stimpacks at you, so they're just free caps from vendors. If they keep playing, they'll start cleaning out ammo and anything worth selling being offered for free just like veterans.
---
Been killed through a wall by this guy way too many times and there are plenty more like him on daily basis .
---
What was the oddest thing you looted up there?
---
Well that ain't a fact
---
Preach! It is big time stupid. :(
---
Thanks
---
Ah okay
---
Supposedly
---
Oof
---
For now I would take a screen shot of your inventory to make sure they can give you your stuff back if it wasn’t fixed properly

Found this on r/Fallout76factions:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions/comments/ds6y7w/bloodhound_caravan_company_now_open_for_business/
---
Do you remember when people could skip to launch prep in the silo by popping through the ceiling with power armor?
---
Do you remember floating camps?
---
Do you remember the queen flying away and never coming back?
---
Do you remember the Tesla sound loop?
---
Do you remember melee not connecting for the first couple hits?
---
I do. Because none of these have been fixed
---
Yea I actually just joined
---
Yes it was fixed.
---
FONV, at release, was the single buggiest game I've ever played. It's still very buggy and crashes for no reason. There has been some serious revisionism about Obsidian and that game in particular.
---
Skin turns green
---
*Its just allergies*
---
Lol.
---
Any 1TB HHD or at least 500GB SSD that supports USB 3.0 should be sufficient.  It has to be at least USB 3.0 to max transfer speed. Anything less and it won't play as well.
---
It was apparently fixed but who knows what will happen come the next patch. Bethesda are known to reintroduce previously fixed bugs back into the game.
---
works fine here on my xbox one x. also "anyone who beats me in NW is a cheater" so sick of that crap. no one is cheating. git gud
---
Mine is named Fisto and believe me he already does ;)
---
I do. I have 2k hours in game. My characters are lv300, lv200, lv100, lv50, and lv25. I'm not leaving the game but I log in less and less ever since private servers divided up my friends list. Since mischief night ended and I got all the rewards on 3 characters, the only current new goal is the NW limited time skins and NW is simply unbearable due to the hackers so I guess I'm not getting those skins... 
---
I don't even get my daily scrip anymore, I barely even do the atom point dailies anymore. There is nothing left to do for a player like me. I miss survival mode and I'm waiting for wastelanders but what do I do today?
---
I wish
---
Despite they (me included) had really great time with the game during its first year, there are a lot of bugs that still tend to annoy people every single day. I think it's a common practice among people to complain if something doesn't work as intended and accentuate the negative. I guess Bethesda wouldn't fix even a fraction of what we have fixed now if it was not for playerbase complaints.
---
But I totally agree with you, there's more than enough fun for 30-60 bucks if you spent several hundreds of hours in game.
---
Did you hear? They fixed the sound loop on the Tesla / sentry bot / 50 cal.
---
*narrator voice* it was not fixed
---
Three to six months to create content that some players burn through in less than an hour, and then complain about "no content" again 🤔
---
Some of em are kinda wonky. I managed to get it by doing most of the lakes southeast of the Whitespring, but for whatever reason the Twin Lakes one would just NOT register, even if I was right on top of the map marker.
---
wut the fuq
---
I had something like this happen during the event. I had supply drops dropping on top of or right near me for a few hours. The first one fell through my roof when I was upstairs repairing stuff and it scared the shit out of me, and the drops kept happening the rest of my session no matter where I was. Mine were empty, though, so it just got annoying after a while.
---
Stealth melee with a *** instigating/power damage combat knife. Absolutley love it. 😊
---
There is a brotherhood of steel roleplay group. I think they call themselves the hellfire chapter?
---
My TSE gauss rifle was my go to since everyone else had way better then me so that’s how I would gain respect I think I read that TSE gauss rifles are legacie weapons now
---
They will keep pushing for more lootbox content at exhorbitant prices, disregard any player feedbqck and languish on the white whales that still "believe they can make the game great". 
---
Time and time this has shown that Bethesda simply doesn't care nor won't acknowledge the playerbase's thoughts and opinion about what *needs* to be done for the game as a whole. 
---
Instead we get seasonal events with more lootbox, less activities for Atom points and a whole plethora of bugs. If you have pride, or somewhat left of it, please do yourselves a favor and bail out of this game. Don't buy it, don't recommend it to others and instead sway them off. I have friends thay complain that there is either nothing to do or that Atom Shop is excessively too expesive vs what can be grinded thru quests - not even mentioning the books filled with numerous bugs (both new and "supposedly patched) and hackers roaming around servers with aimbots/inventory hacks and cheats.
---
The game's not worth the investment.
---
Got people who hunt on fallout first members. Yet they defend themselves they are in the wrong?
---
I have a vampire's explosive light machine gun. OP, but expensive to run full time.
---
What I don't get about the whole "Story" is that it reportedly comes from FIRST subscribers.  The FIRST subscribers report this rampant class war, they are forced to endure, or so the story says, not the non- subscribers who are labeled as the malcontents who want to ruin the game for everyone.
---
Then when you read FIRST subscriber accounts here, the vast majority (almost all) say they have NEVER faced any type of discrimination or harassment from non-subcribers, but quite a few go on to blame the non-subscribers as the malcontents who are making it all up?
---
Huge publicity stunt orchestrated by Bethesda if you ask me, to drum up interest and get the name of the Game back in the news/media so that the game doesn't get forgotten, due to Wastelanders being postponed indefinitely.
---
So unlimited ammo storage is next by that logic. It works the same way doesn't it?
---
That was only to shut ppl up for a short time now it's back to like it was at launch but they not getting as much hate so no need.
---
Considering the only real options are on the barrel, it depends on what you want the weapon to do. Do you want a short range tool that has higher DPS, or something that can reach out at the cost of some damage?  It depends on your play style.  
---
I like distance, otherwise I’d play a melee character that doesn’t need ammo. Plasma does have a travel time, unlike lasers or standard ballistic weapons, so you have to learn how to shoot in anticipation of where a target will be when the plasma reaches it.
---
On the other hand, maybe you have a higher range/accuracy weapon for distance and want the plasma to be more of a close quarters tool. I find the spin up on rotary weapons to be less than ideal for close fighting, because incoming staggers and heavy damage can interrupt you and force a new spin up before resuming fire.
---
I’d try out a few options in actual play, and figure out what you like best. I personally dislike plasma and rotary weapons in general, so I stick with a harpoon gun, 50cal and LMG on my heavy gunner.
---
I remember always going to the Enclave and buying cheap legendaries. Also plans being in the blue suitcase in Watoga.
---
I have a fairly spiffy setup with an I9-9900K, RTX2080, 32GB ram. I have graphic settings maxed on 3440×1440 resolution. Running ethernet to fast cable internet. This normally runs at 60fps even with lots of action and explosions. But there will be slowdowns in hard to pin down circumstances. Being around camps in certain locations (like Whitespring) and, it seems like, in certain lighting conditions, can pull the frame rate down into the 30's with no real action going on. I feel that these issues are more game engine related than server related.
---
Thanks!
---
It's fixed.
---
18 months vs 4 years and engine they never used that's trash hmm.
---
I’m guessing the Fire Is Lit lit up something in a little glass bowl, and this epiphany wafted out of the smoky haze.
---
The few things Bethesda doesn't charge extra for
---
What an amazing flaw in design that just gets accepted.
---
Next patch notes, GP is “fixed” for auto only.  It was good while it lasted....
---
Bring back the Bot!!! "FREE WATOGA" i wish we could write our own protest signs!!!!
---
LOL ok that one was a lil better.
---
Screenshots shouldn't be necessary. Since characters are stored on their end, they can just look in the history and restore whatever is missing.
---
I've asked several data miners about the damage type of the legacy weapons and I've been consistently told that it's the correct damage type. It's explosive with an energy subtype, which is normal.
---
It's depressing that I came here to post about how I'm experiencing the fast travel bug too...but it's a -different- fast travel bug. The one where I'm over-encumbered while carrying 310/335.
---
I heard every November 14th, if you stare in a mirror and say "Fallout 76 is an experiment" three times, Todd Howard appears and take about tree-fiddy out of your pocket. 
---
They say the next time you play Oblivion, Horse Armor DLC is somehow installed
---
I haven't ran into the problem at all and I subbed day one of the offer.
---
 I’ve finished second a handful of times and won once.  Lol I didn’t even realize I was the last person against a whole team till I died.  Bush hiding is the way to go..
---
There's still people trying to like a game that doesn't like them.

You can do this on ultracite armor also
---
“I’m bored, give money back”
---
Woah...
---
Saw him there yesterday.
---
Ayo quit giving Xbox player's a bad name

Nope, they couldn’t restore people’s stuff so they gave them a random supply
---
Do not give them more ideas to rip money from us again like with the fridge!
---
You would think tho lol
---
I can't wait for this one - **"Inside the vault : How do people fly in Nuclear Winter?"**
---
I’m not a hater but my “Stockholm syndrome” lets me take breaks away from the game without making a post about it every time, always come back enjoying the next session
---
ah damn it, that set already powerful enough!
---
Thanks for telling us exactly what a shotgun build is “supposed to be”. Not that I don’t have the same mental image, but a player can do whatever they want with their character.
---
Suppressors for shotguns do exist in real life. They might be pointless, genius or just a proof of concept. It doesn’t really matter.  A silenced firearm is the thing that doesn’t exist. Even a .22 makes noise.
---
Probably coming next in fo1st
---
I said it just works because his username was Todd Howard
---
Life, uh, uh, uh uh, uh, finds a way
---
Thanks! That worked.
---
I've run into both high and low level ass-hats, but what i was getting at is while they may have a higher capacity to give, higher level players will tend to be less appreciative of little free stuffs. Not necessarily that they are entitled (poor word choice?), but that they'll see a few stimpacks, waters, and think little of it. While a lower level would see that as something bigger, more generous, and maybe feel less inclined to empty out a vending machine of free stuff.  It's cool that you're a high level, and nice that you're not entitled. However, do a few events and you're bound to run into a high level meta build legendary killer that has no regard for anyone but themselves. But again, not all players are prone to such ass-hatterey, but higher level ass-hatters shine brighter than most.
---
There needs to be something soon, but unfortunately higher ups is probably telling them not to talk about it because they talk about what’s going on or planned for the future, some might ask about the lack of communication with Fallout 1st which could cause some frustration.
---
It’s also concerning since the holidays are coming up and there’s been no transparency for about 3 weeks now and that silence needs to break for the peace of mind of most players
---
yes it does chris and elt are both mistaken, dodgy works as well. I will caveat by saying I don't use either of them any more and I tested them both at whitesprings vs ghouls pre player vendor days. 
---
Dodgy turns into nothing but an ap drain if you get mobbed. 
---
without unyeilding armor serendipity wasnt that great and I felt better off not using it in power armor. medic pump or born survivor were better for me in PA. ended up using jet packs and I am now a junkie build so even sole survivor got dumped. I just hit the big old super stim if i really need a bump and for light battle damage I drink purified water. you can drink it in or out of combat and even at full health if you predict a small amount of inc damage you can preload the regen with a few bottles of purified water. takes 2 water bottles every tenth of the health meter. makes thru hiker a must but you can loot purifiers and not craft stims ever. I roll with an average of 50 purified water for light damage and about 20 super stims and as much pyschobuff as I can get my junkie hands on. also I am committed to not crafting cooking or stim making and since I have thruhiker for water I also carry melons and have the herbivore mutation. one button food water with no cooking. good with salt is nice to have but its not essential for the melons.
---
It does for me and I run the Good Doggie Perk so get tremendous benefit from dog food.
---
I agree about the voice acting and I'm a cinephile so I am always comparing it to what I would expect to experience in a well acted film. With respect to the writing it helped me to watch a couple of youtubers who connected the segments of different stories together to see how cleverly the developers had constructed the narrative. I was always rushing through quests trying to stay alive and not paying enough attention to the story.
---
Have you looked at "My Support Tickets"? They record all responses there.
---
&gt;I am sorry you have such a negative view towards people using fo1st but please feel free to add my accounts to your block list IGN: Karthathan , TheHoboSeer, EmeraldAshura, and KarthsKubby as I am sure our personalities would not mesh well. I tend to enjoy playing with chill, laidback, and positive people, and rejoice that I can effectively stack my server now with those that are like-minded.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I wish you luck in the wasteland!
---
\^ You are welcome to also add me to your blocklist :)
---
Okay, I just dropped by Abandoned Mine Shaft #2 in the Ash Heap to test this again.  The smoke plume coming from the cracked ground immediately next to the blue building is an easy-to-find toxic air location.  The toy fire helmet doesn't give a PER penalty, but it also does NOT give airborne disease protection.  Sorry for the misinformation!
---
I can confirm, however, that ordinary bandannas will give protection.
---
whatever . your dumb. welcome to the block list.
---
My rifleman carries a bloody combat knife for mole rats and such. It’ll easily kill a lvl 42 ghoul in one hit, and I have no gladiator perks.  I imagine it would be great with ninja and gladiator added in. The stealth blade mod adds .5x sneak attack damage, which is nothing to sneeze at.  With 40% faster swing speed, it’s insanely fast.
---
I don’t think a knife build will ever be a new meta, but I’m sure it’ll do just fine in PvE.  Go bloody with any weapon type and you’ll cut a swath through Appalachia.  Lead pipe, 10mm pistol, you name it.
---
Not really lookin to spend my free time filling out bethesda’s Jira system.
---
Dude, if you don't have time to play, don't play and take care of your kids. This is no excuse to cheat.
---
LOL so there I was neck deep in a radstags ass, grahm was passing by. He got confused. I went to pet chally and grahm said to stay away from moo moo.
---
I played a funny sound clip in area chat during mischief night and a guy dropped a legacy for me after I gave him the link to find the original YouTube video I made the clip from. He even asked me if I had anything I wanted duped. I politely declined.
---
Which platform did this occur on?
---
Im skeptical tat there will be any content past wastelanders
---
Unfortunately, I'm not on PSN :(
---
So glad the Canned Meat Stew doesn't spoil anymore, stockpile them and grind out XP.
---
Damn y'all really still out here thinking this wasn't one big cash-grab stress-test.
---
Sadly, same things happen with single shot weapons such as lever action. I suggest you quit vats and aim again. That usually helps
---
LOL my wife runs its. she loves it. I dont think she could keep up with the ammo cost if I didnt funnel every ounce of lead and gunpowder her way. I use laser gatling and fusion cores she helps me repair the power plants I help her with feeding that little never ending pit of bullets. I honestly think it takes two to keep a 10 mil smg well fed and happy. aaaw its like were raising another baby in the game together.
---
tbh I'm just hanging around to see what the last straw will be
---
I don't think there will be one
---
The only reason it's even still on my HDD is because I want to see how Wastelanders is when it comes out and I don't want to have to re-download the fucker. Definitely zero plans whatsoever to play it until then. After that, hooray one less FUCKING launcher on my system
---
Oh it will, the names in the video aren't censored so this falls under "witch hunting" or some other bs damage control excuse.
---
The deletion glitch was fixed, but the crafting priority was not.  Crafting will still prioritize unscrapped junk in your stash box over scrap in your scrap box.  Please keep this in mind if you're storing any rare junk.  You'll need to put it in a vendor, display it, temporarily drop it or store it in a world container.  
---
Just tested it again tonight to confirm.  I have a few hundred steel in my scrap box.  Picked up a dozen clothes hangers from Whitespring and dumped them in my stash, unscrapped.  Then I made a bunch of throwing knives.  All of the hangers disappeared from my stash.  I've sent in a ticket about this, but I don't know if it's been officially noticed yet.
---
no griefers already have enough loopholes to exploit.
---
Well unfortunately you're in for a sad awakening. This company is greedy and doesn't care about making this to the point of ESO. It's pretty sad to see people like you out there supporting companies and games like this. It's the downfall of gaming.
---
it works but you cant see because its camo. I painted my shit then promptly lost it :p
---
move the decimals three right it weighs 1 pound. (if the bandoleer reduces it to .001)
---
I don't think the 500 atom skin was a mistake or a decision reversal or any of the theories you mentioned in the video, I think they were simply testing the waters and removed the pricetag when the skin wasn't selling. No loss giving away something for free that nobody was buying anyway, with the added bonus of making themselves look like they are being generous. 
---
They are testing how deep our pockets are and protests and outrage play no part in the pricing. The skin didn't sell for 500 so they made it a freebie.
---
What about instead of stealing things, you could use the pickpocket skill to put funny hats on people? I assume most people play in first person POV, so it would be funny to see how long it would take to figure out you got funny hat on your head
---
No it doesn't. Power armor gets emergency protocols. Without power armor you get serendipity.
---
I remember!!!!
---
The subscription is worth it NOW but right before launch when they were trying to sell it as a sub like with WoW, people where really mad. And even after they changed it before release, it wasn't nothing special. Until one year came around and the game did a 360, plus more. ESO is perfect, almost, now. I used to like the level scaling but now I'm with people on not liking it. Plus, I suck at builds. But their sub system is 100% worth it imo
---
I think most of the players coming out of the vault now are alt characters. Sure you you get the odd player trying 76 for the first time since launch but not many. You can tell by watching them. Alt characters will have an agenda and just crack on doing what they do, wheras a newbie will be looking around staring at things not really doing much.
---
This is happening with Tesla rifles, too. Automatic mod makes it happen so much it’s basically useless.
---
Says you
---
I also have a 1060 3gb card, I play on low settings and I use several ini tweaks to improve the game. I highly recommend disabling grass creation, that's a solid 10fps boost, and disable depth of field and motion blur.
---
There are lots of guides to make these changes on nexusmods but I would recommend starting with cloudys mod manager, it has everything you need with just one click to make the game run WAY better.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/221
---
I don’t know about you guys but if I die &amp; I’m overencumbered I still can only spawn at 76. Camp doesn’t show up or anything. Kind of ridiculous but not gonna complain about it, my fault for dying
---
I’ll join
---
Psn is GrantWolken
---
I started an alt as well. but what reminded me about why I like 76 so much was the conundrum I had when dressing my melee guy. I couldnt find a look or role that made me happy he was just generic mr punch things in the face guy. I tried grognak but that feels like it needs an axe to be properly played. 
---
my heavy is an army dude in camo and camo x-01 currently. obviously he is rebuilding america and was a member of the military and is still hoping military command will return to Appalachia. 
---
my rifleman went from the cowboy trench to the new ranger outfit. a lone hunter / self sufficent sort. 
---
my pistol guy uses a clean lab coat and will eventually use a laser pistol ( a nod to jack cabot from fallout 4) a scientist and builder of things. mostly shoots when things attack the camp. 
---
but my melee fist guy. couldnt decide on a look/role. then I got the preacher outfit and added a fedora. the battle monk was born. throwing knifes and fisticuffs with a bible in his back pocket. I cant say I completely chose those roles they sort of happened on their own.
---
Wow... I am... Not surprised at all. You are toxic af
---
I love my prison shank bloodied swing speed Bowie knife with the usual melee perks.  It rips through enemies and it’s surprised some in PvP to some degree.  Haven’t tried stealth on it though but might be worth playing with.
---
I love the protest signs in game so i second this.
---
I use long shot on my short barrel automatic handmades degined for max hip fire results and my two shot handmade really seems to improve with long shot enabled.
---
its been so long since I tested it I am not 100% sure on this anymore. I still have the perks I will test it out.
---
I agree with your point but people do harass you for having 1st. Happened to me multiple times. Mostly when it first launched &amp; I was running around in my ranger armor. Not as much now but I think people genuinely hated 1st subs at the start
---
I find the private world is not much better ( if at all ) from public worlds in regard to server performance.
---
Bit of a disappointment.
---
1rst of all dump your preconceptions. what and how things work in every other fallout game does not matter. Every fallout has been different from the other. 1 and 2 were very similar but the rest all had some pretty big differences. not good, not bad, just different. so if you go in with a preconceived notion of how things "should" be you're already in for a let down. 
---
2nd if Emil is the writer for skyrim, fallout 4, fallout 3, that is fine in my book. fallout 3 was my favorite story line wise but I liked the stories in all the other titles as well. I felt like the story in fallout 4 was a bit short but at the same time with all of the moving parts, settlements and new things they did they were limitied on that a little. overall I loved the game and the story from four but I get why a lot of people didnt like it. 
---
3rd I dont think they showed us more of the writing because at the time when they released the videos I am betting they had barely started working on the writing lol I think this is them laying a very small base line and then scrambling to fill in the details before release date lol.
---
It. Dosent. Work. With. Power Armor.
---
I do it just to get the event done, I don't care about the xp
---
At some point, you shouldn't. But really, that's the time to kill and farm all that steel to turn it into moar ammo. Don't know about you, but I'm always wanting lead (Lucky Hole Mine!) and steel.
---
I've been having a lot of fun withy faster swing speed junkies combat knife. Cuts through scorched like butter. Not much use on big enemies but fun to change it up.
---
Max level I’m assuming? 20k-25k
---
Nick is one of the more interesting characters I have met in any game ever. his end rant where he ends up claiming ownership of himself and his decisions was both conclusive and also inconclusive. He is nick that was and is and he sounded like he found peace with that but at the same time he still had some conflict left in his voice. depending on how I looked at it I could conclude he was finally at peace with himself but I could also conclude that he will never be at peace with himself. its like the story answered yes to an up or down question.
---
What this guy said. Stop being bitches and address the problems that the community is dealing with and reporting.
---
I don’t know about powerfist mods, but I had the same experience scrapping a lever gun today. I was bummed.
---
I have to test it to get the ocd worm out of my brain. either
---
A. my memory is faulty because I distinctly remember testing it back in the early early days and it proccing.
---
B. its been nerfed or changed in the many many patches since I tried it last. 
---
C. yall are wrong and going off of heresay which needs to be corrected for your sake and my sake because OCD. 
---
D. You guys are trolling hoping some OCD fuck like myself gets triggered and ends up wasting game time testing it. in which case congrats you have succeeded in triggering the fuck out of my OCD lol. 
---
regardless I have to know now. I still have 7 hours of work left. this is going to worm at a corner of my brain till I get home and see for myself.
---
Voted
---
Unsure, but I believe I have all the mods unlocked if you want me to mod it for you. I’m on pc.
---
Forgot to mention I’m on Xbox one. After scrapping 10 surely mods should have unlocked. Just wondering what’s going on with it
---
Have low hopes, I just hope it functions and adds cool mechanics that add to the life of the game specifically pvp stuff and faction wars
---
nope. it would be exploited. somehow someway within the first 30 minutes of being live. kind of like the the whole slap damage thing in beta. dude was running around bleeding peeps out with a combat knife 30 minutes after it went life. sure the knife barely did any damage but the bleed effects did just fine.
---
Also I was there at 76's first Christmas they only ever released Christmas themed atom shop stuff 
---
So please lower your expectations they are far to high lol but for real that's what they did last Christmas there was no event, scriping didn't exist, player vendening wasn't around, nuclear winter was above the dev's pay grade and mental capabilities  and the robot on messenger event got stuck on everything and usually failed the mission as you yell at him in anger saying "move around the rock u fucking retard it's not a hard concept... it failed, god dammit Bathesda!!"
---
We didn't get an event last year because the game was a mess. There not being any data in the game yet doesn't mean much since it's still early. I'd imagine if they do do something it would be earlier in the month or be set on a schedule like Meat Week was, without needing a patch that day
---
Or so I'm hoping, I took a break for about a month around the holidays last year because I was getting disconnected three time in an hour so I missed all the holiday stuff (or lack thereof)
---
Well I’m fairly certain you get at least the puncturing mod from scrapping. It’s random whether you get an unlock or not unfortunately, so it’s technically possible to go 100 without getting an unlock. All up to luck.
---
I suggest equipping super duper when crafting them for mods, and scrapper when you scrap them.
---
Why do you want the game to be boring?
---
I would really want an anti-armor perk for handguns first but that would be nice. Then I cam carry a rifle as a side arm.
---
You literally are a snowflake, because you are getting upset because someone killed you in a video game. Your ego is so fragile that you want to ban anyone who kills you or inconveniences you in said video game. If you want a safe space go play on a private server, bethesda made those servers so you could have a safespace :)
---
let me guess with no counters to stop the pick pocketing. so stealthboy in screw another player over for free stims. no fuck that that's only entertaining if you're douchy enough to go fuck over another player.
---
Oh yeah! I totally agree. I loved the event and the concept behind it. I for one am already counting down the days to next Halloween and Mischief Night.
---
...Or can not because of lags, disconnects and bugs.
---
Got a bloodied one as a drop and modded it up. Once space frees up in my stash/vendor putting in so it finds a good home. See you in the wasteland. 
---
[IGN same as here. PC]
---
Gendered hair REALLY doesn't make sense when they got rid of gendered clothing
---
I found him up there the week before Mischief Night started. Spent at least 10 minutes just listening to all their lines. I was a bit disappointed that we didn't actually interact with them much during the actual event. Would have been hard to hear what their saying over all the explosions though.
---
I’m not opposed to counters I just want this game to feel less like a childrens play ground. Yea that would be funny to rob people of all their stims
---
I scrap my vending electric lines to get off the map and lock my vending machine bungalow door.
---
Dont price items in vending machine when totalled which could exceed 30k caps limit.
---
Maybe they were showing you theirs and you went to the wrong one to try and get in? If you still have it then clearly they didn't steal it.
---
Excavator pa is replaceable, you can craft it again in the pa station but yes that person was a dick for doing that
---
Super easy to deal with...
---
Just give the player an alert that the camp is under attack...
---
It's up to u now...
---
I'll help you move your stuff off your mules to mine.
---
Same here
---
You can open packs during a NW game, but can't change the perk cards. I know that's not really helpful if you're running around trying to avoid being shot but if you're hiding it saves time for load out switching in the lobby later
---
Yes, exactly the same way and you're not wrong. Basically anything which doesn't have condition is handled as a single object (database query) regardless of quantity owned.
---
Well how bout you quit for good. Seems you got your characters deleted months ago for doing god knows what and done something again and got suspended permanently
---
Was there any rats following the boteye?
---
Very big mad eh?
---
Don't think so. Even as a vanguard melee serendipity is stupidly useful.
---
I got attacked by a bunch of FO1st members. A group of 3-4 of just kept following me and dancing every chance they got. Didn't want to fight enemies or me and they were in pacifist. They just wanted to show they were better than me with their stupid emote &gt;:v
---
Class war is real!
---
Correction: I'll be hopping on half an hour from now.  Shit went haywire at the bar and had to kick people out and ban them.  
---
If people can't help tonight, tomorrow around noon thirty works too.
---
The "hate" is but a criticism of the game. The way the game was presented, launched and handled from there deserves most of it. You can call it "hate" as a defense mechanism of something you love, but it really isn't. Even those who want F76 to fail and die are not hating it. How so? Well, easy. When you see your beloved franchise becoming effortless cash grab, you get scared. If this works out, you will never see a good game from the same studio ever again, because that would not make any sense at all! Why would a company spend years on carefully crafting a great game, if you can sell ANYTHING at all, and people would still buy it, and on top of that, instead of fixing the game, you can add MTX and get even more money with no work at all? As business you add P2W components next, and it works out too, even more money for nothing. 
---
As part of the community, I would think this has to be it. Finally, the time (Although way way way way too late) for the community to unite and say, No, Bethesda, that handling of the game is not right. Please do better. We don't want to lose Fallout series, we would want to see it improve and become a really good game. Yet, I come to forums and often see the "I have paid you so much Bethesda so that you can keep on with this game without fixing it. Please, do not give up, just keep on going the same things you were doing since Fallout 76 launch with all your games, I am adding extra support for you with my money". One thing is that I do not understand this desire to kill future Bethesda games, another is, I cannot really do anything about it. I mean, there is the fundraiser for ruining games, the Atom shop, but there isn't one to give them money for bug fixing and quality improvements only. I would gladly pay for anything of sort, just to improve the games, but honestly, when people try their best to donate to ruining my favorite games, I have no idea why do you do such cruel thing to me and to those who love Bethesda games.
---
Yes, put my stuff in and its still there.
---
Ps4, but thank you!
---
Sadly not. He was muttering something about "It's bitter being here", I was like "Oh, I'm sorry." Paid my respects then left on my adventure.
---
Is this an NPC or an actual person? I'm a bit confused
---
Wanna know how I know? Spent 100 levels with it on. Read a post it didn’t work so I took it off. Switched to an unarmed build around lvl 200 and watch the proc effect go off nonstop.
---
If your power armour is still in your inventory, they did not steal it. Just had a similar like it? And such power armours are really not that rare
---
What makes you sure it was your excavator armor? Was it the exact same skin combination you use? Maybe they noticed you had the same skin as their set so they jumped into their armor to show off their collection?
---
You on PC? I’ve got a full set of wood unyielding sneak
---
I might do that, but I really enjoy the settings and environment Bethesda usually creates in their games. The world is full of surprises, even after 100s of hours.
---
I dont understand were from and by who the "witch hunt" bs started ??
---
I mean we care about the game, report non stop, trying to do something. and we not allowed to make video of our experience in game because these names of other players.... we not trying to frame one guy... its a disease game wide.
---
Umm...
---
Hate to break it to you but you're like 2 weeks too late.
---
Better luck next time.
---
If I can roam around the wastes as a glowing one that gives Salisbury steaks to folks that would be my life from then on
---
yeah, I guess we all have different play styles. If I had one month of 1st, I would be grinding like crazy, let my OCD run wild. Get enough junk for at least 6 months.
---
I’d say it shouldn’t be a subscription. It should be an added benefit you get to buy and keep. Plus it shouldn’t be 100% to bethesda. With all the bad press it should go to a charity (even if partly) I think Bethesda is worse than EA at this point
---
pacifism prevents damage to others from you, not damage to you from others. This has been the case since forever.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44182/~/how-does-pacifist-mode-work-in-fallout-76%3F
---
No, I haven't hear of such occurrence until now.
---
Let me see if I understand the timeline: this account was suspended during the '100k rare item' wave, finally wiped and released after six months, you did not bother even starting the game since and now a few months later it was suspended again despite the inactivity, did I get that right?
---
If you definitely have not played on that account could someone have gained access to it and 'get it in hot water' so to speak?
---
On my original xbox i have no lag at all even on a public server the only thing i get is messages that disconect me
---
I would definitely consider getting one if it was for free
---
I have a nice legendary plasma and I think it’s ass. I’m looking for a .50 or LMG now
---
I mean my camp has been nuked 3 times this week and the people who nuked it activity did the throw up emoji as I was running around in my ranger armour so I'm not sure, take what you want from that I guess 
---
Some other points im level 50
---
And my camps not by any landmark
---
I never played beta so I can't comment on that. Yes, i'm sure the game has grown and evolved. But the pace at which it is evolving is not the right pace.
---
I put about 90 hours into fo76. I finished all main quests, finished all but one side quest and did most of the smaller/miscellaneous quests. There is little else to do for me in game at the moment other then vault 96 or NW.  
---
NW I don't play because of rampant cheating. Vault 96 is fun and all but I can't be bothered doing the same thing over and over and over again.
---
TL;DR this game needs more content at a faster pace. People are getting bored with the game and that causes frustration. Thats why people complain.
---
I mean did anyone really expect anything different at this point?
---
I agree. Bethesda has really doubled down on micro transactions and has zero shame in trying to make as much money as they can from the shrinking amount of people who play the game. 
---
It’s a real shame
---
How much can you store and how long would you estimate it lasts?
---
I dont play any other games online like fallout, only war thunder there you can cheat but it wont give you too much advantage. And some how other game that pvp based manage to deal with cheaters, there has to be a solution. Like anti virus that scan every thing and searching for cheat code lines. In my opinion this is not too hard of a task for AAA company like Bethesda !!!
---
No problem! I know, this quest is a pain and I wasted plenty of time on it too. Like someone else said, most photos just need to be taken when you're right on the map location marker, but some (like this one or the fishing holes) are unmarked. Not the most user-friendly of quests.
---
K
---
You 100% sure you both were in pacifist? By chance you spotted a message saying you or team member attacked someone? Usually play with pvp on, but when i do pop pacifist it works like a charm, mutations dont engage pvp anymore aswell
---
There will be no new content until next spring, beyond some atom shop cosmetics and some new utility features for Fallout 1st.
---
Yup we both checked I never change my settings and it is on pacifist and my teammate confirmed he had it on as well.
---
Shotguns make excellent decorate items when placed on weapon racks.
---
I don’t know that it would, but I do know you won’t get enough participants unfortunately.
---
Also he shot me from a small distance.  I believe he was sniping.  I dont have the mutations that cause a reaction from mele anyway.
---
Like someone else said the only real choice is the barrel. And the splitter on a non explosive gattling plasma is very meh, shoots a green fog like a flamer.
---
But on an explosive varent it turns it into a full auto shotgun of death.
---
To sum up, explosive use a spittle, non explosive use the refined (or whatever its called)
---
Damn that is strange, maybe just after the event was done the game for a moment did not realize you were in pacifist? Cause i am sure with the changes they made there is no way of engaging pvp attacking someone in pacifist anymore
---
Ive had other people try shooting me before but never got killed by them so how is this different?
---
Nice try faking hype for broken game
---
I thought you had left the game forever? You made posts saying 'goodbye and good riddance' recently
---
Idk its not the first time that piece of shit did that to me in the same scenerio.
---
No chance you recorded the kill? Im curious to see now what happened..
---
What are you talking about? The massive overhaul was already done for 76, readding quest givers isn't a massive undertaking on the technical side, it's just a hassle to redesign the world taking them into account again.
---
Oh I probably shouldve but once i spawned back in i just ran off to fast travel somewhere otherwise he wouldve kept on me like before.
---
I probably shouldve recorded it.  I was too irritated and discussing it with my teammate.
---
Can ya
---
I won’t deny any of that, being a tool can be fun. Though I was not lying when I said there should be a counter. I believe in balanced gameplay but I also believe that in this sort of game chaos and freedom of player choice should be able to rain free and not be inhibited by limiting silly rules
---
15 slots if I remember correctly and it lasts 50% longer. I cant estimate the actual time because the bottleneck is always the high radiation fluid and mass. so on a couple nuke trips I don't bother farming the flowers I just go after mobs. when I have  nice stockpile of fluids and mass I will go do a picking run. I don't have to worry about the timer because I go right to camp and convert to stabilized right away. once it's stabilized it doesn't spoil so its all good then.
---
Double dip! I double dip on mine, heavy damage. I run a bloodied pipe pistol build. Currently using be pipe revolver n a bloodied ffr bolt action. It does turn them into rifles but I still consider it a pistol build. If you're using gunslinger it's a pistol build. I just use 1/3 of all the gungsliger perks, which let's me use other beneficial agility perk such as adrenaline. I max out all rifleman perks with crack shot and 1/3 concentrated fire.
---
no im gonna keep playing because im having fun
---
Ahh ok thanks I have an explosive one. I want to use for the queen.
---
sure thing the .5% of the player base that is the haters on this subreddit not logging in all at the same time. man I bet that will scare the crap out of bethesda.
---
I do choirs in between / dishes / vacuum and mop / keep an eye on the screen / jump in play / repeat
---
stop suggesting implementing new bugs.
---
Did you own a workshop?
---
Ya thats not gonna happen bud.
---
“Worse than EA” 
---
The company that releases the same game/s every year at full price with micro transactions 
---
Also fallout 76 is no where near the same level of a let down as anthem. Yes it’s a let down
---
Nope i dont do those due to pvp neither did my teammate.
---
He didn't write Far Harbor, that was entirely a different guy
---
You *can*. It's not going to do anything.
---
I’m not talking about the game. I’m taking about the monetisation of the game. Eg. Atomic shop and fallout first
---
Most of those wouldn't of have been changed without consistent community whining though.
---
Like Bethesda didn't even recognise them as problems or it was a glitch.
---
well, your scrapbot seems to wander randomly. If you could confine his path so that he constantly randomly wandered over pressure plate switches attached to lightsz that might simulate some of what you're looking for?
---
The Perception vs Intelligence and whether or not that's bad wiring is honestly a stretch. You needed high perception to understand Christine in Dead Money and the writing for that DLC was damn near perfect
---
And when Phoenix would was bad ass and would go out and fight all the other bots in Watoga so you had to find him or kill all the other bots so you could trade.  Good times, my friend. Good times. 
---
And when you could find a certain civil war plan and craft a ton of them quickly and sell them all for your daily caps.
---
I thought of that, minecraft style, but i just didn’t want to resort to it as i like him walking out and about
---
At least you aren’t looking at $22.95 a month or $179 a year!
---
Nerd
---
Odd. Generally you or one of your team needs to have pacifist turned off or have a workshop. I'd chalk it up to bugthesda and if it hapens again, submit a ticket (whatever good that will do)
---
Cheater
---
Don't put it in the god damn atomic shop or fallout 1st
---
A Ak 47 weighs 9.5 pounds.
---
A Handmade assault rifle Customized weighs like 22 pounds in game.
---
The m134 Mingun weighs 85 pounds.
---
A minigun in fallout 76 weighs 18 pounds.
---
No source calling Bethesda offering an extension, but Obsidian did take that contract, knowing that they could ask for a bit more time in development _during the contract deals_ given how much history its developers have with the IP.
---
They’re getting there. Every new release is like a modded version of their last game, same bugs, same combat, just with decent graphical improvements. Star field will just feel like modded Fallout 4 and ES6 will feel like modded Star field and so on
---
I haven’t cheated, but gaming police are such nerds, especially when it’s towards someone who probably didn’t do anythin
---
Nice to see some Singaporeans playing as well.
---
You could have had your account details leaked and someone used it for hacking ect
---
Can't wait for my Bloodied Explosive Bow.
---
76 isnt balanced though. at all. its not pvp centric. its full of glitches bugs exploits. 
---
and I want to walk back some of the trash I said in the other comment about pvpers. thats like saying everyone who plays football is dumb and thats just not true. 
---
The fallout 76 pve community are more like marathoners. ever done a 5k half marathon or really any sort of long distance running event? most of us have no hope or desire of winning it. we just show up wanting to participate and do our personal best. sure we have the serious guys who really get on it and blow the rest of the feild away but the bulk of us just show up and try to complete the damn thing. along the way we encourage each other. at the end of the race we all pat each other on the back regardless of where we place. just completing one of those is a nice accomplishment and we congrats each other. 
---
the pvp guys are like a football team. completely different game completely different mentality and mind set completely different rules. griefers are essentially football players who gear up and tackle the shit out of marathoners midrace. they laugh they giggle then they cry when the police drag them away. 
---
workshops are like the dev team at bethesda put a football field and scheduled a foot ball game AND ran the marathon route right through the middle of it. really really shitty design on bethesdas part by trying to combine two completely different gameplay styles and communities. all that does is make make marathoners like myself really hate footballers and footballers like you really hate "snowflakes" like me. 
---
pick pocketing. fuck no. that's giving the footballers who tackle the marathoners a fucking taser. no way in hell am I down for that.
---
I don't think many people here want to see Fo76 fail. We are disgruntled (to say the least) about the way BGS is handling the game but I think the majority of us want to see it succeed and still love the game itself.  
---
We are angry that BGS decisions are, in our eyes, killing the game. All we can do is voice our opinion here and maybe exaggerate a bit in the hope BGS sees this and stops killing the game with piss poor decisions.
---
I have private server and plays with my son. We r ok to have some friendly players join us if they r keen. We wan to complete the scouts badge n possum badges with friendly folks
---
Very likely he done something. He got all his characters deleted and that wasn't done for no good reason. And those that support cheaters very likely are cheaters themselves, or someone associated with one
---
The corporativist are here, so many downvotes for being ethical.
---
It’s less than minimum wage even for a monthly sub instead of yearly, which is even cheaper.
---
I’m not saying it’s cheap for everyone, I know different people have different financial situations but realistically it’s not expensive.
---
Aussie Aussie Aussie
---
Thanks for the correction. I thought he'd had his hand in everything to do with Fallout 4. Seems like I was mistaken.
---
so ten bucks you're good but 13 heeeellll no that's 3 whole more dollars a month. LOL
---
nah I think you just want free shit. nothings free. ever. even breathing removes oxygen from the air.
---
this bug was introduced since the patch they've added jetpack to ultracite and raider. I hope it'll be fixed soon...
---
We are very real, good sir.
---
Lol
---
Agreed. Rifles are the most versatile weapon in the game. One or two rifles in your inventory are all you need to kill anything you want.
---
You can't do the same with pistols; they all have various drawbacks so you'll often have quite a few for different purposes, or cycle between multiple without reloading.
---
You can't do the same with heavy guns; Ultracite Gatling Laser may be great for damaging Scorchbeast Queen in the air, Furious Gatling Plasma better for her on the ground, Bloodied Gatling Plasma with splitter for all the adds, and an 50 Cal MG better for penetrating the energy resist of the Yao Guai and radscorpions and crickets. This is an extreme scenario but if you want to min/max you need to swap to the right heavy gun for the situation.
---
Most explosive weapons have very specific uses as well: AGL for killing many adds in a cluster, Fat Man for higher health targets, etc.
---
But one Bloodied / Junkie's Handmade Rifle works perfectly for pretty much every enemy: it's hit scan, it's very high physical damage with a high rate of fire with auto receiver, and the ammo is plentiful. And against robots and such? It still perforates through their higher DR no problem.
---
Yea I did put one in as my tm thinks he was hacking somehow idk we will see if they do something about it.  Just thought maybe someone would know what happened.
---
Yeah, I'd go with an explosive. Pretty sure each beam dose full dmg, it fires so fast though it's hard for me to see, speacialy with the secondary explosion dmg
---
I will be online for a little bit tonight. Let me know if you or your son needs anything.
---
XD and then host started attacking for no reason then they decided to leave. Hey i got robbed phew phew
---
I've found that it seems to be server related. Change servers &amp; it works again. 
---
Also a slow network speed seems to also cause it.
---
 While I'm away at work, the network is pretty bad at night &amp; that's when it seems to happen. When I'm at home with a faster network it does occur less.
---
But yes please fix as once I had to do it about 30 times to fast travel. Now that sucked.
---
Ah richard buffman the astroturfer returns with his fake ass ground roots anti gaming company making money rhetoric, huzzah way to make the effort sir keep it up. I am sure bethesda is 100% convinced you and your three fellow minions with 50 alt accounts are really ticked off hordes of pissed off consumers. you're doing great. keep spitting the narrative that beth is bad and 76 is bad. you are really getting to us as a fanbase. I have been playing since beta and just one of your sentences almost convinced me to uninstall. I asked myself wwrd what would richard buffman do? but being a weak willed sheep I just couldn't resist the predatory consumerism that bethesda uses to make me play and didn't uninstall. it was horrible I really feel like a victim. I couldn't control my hands !! what witchery is this ! I am pushing the log in button! holy shit I shot that super mutant off the roof and his head rolled in front of me like a basket ball and I could not help myself. I smiled! OMG they control my emotions!  they are EVIL sir keep fighting the good fight.
---
dam. hope you do well. ussually guys that care they go the extra mile and put effort in it. if he didnt . it means he wasent serious.
---
Same here. On xbox. Doesn't matter whether or not I play NW, it doesn't work, and there is no longer an option in the atomic shop to equip it. I also don't own any of the other loot bags.
---
Couldn't agree more, it's like a marketing university graduate with zero real-world experience writes those articles. We don't buy this kind of communication devs...
---
😂 Ker-ching!
---
Nope. Maybe fallout 1st members will get unlimited ammo stash in the future but the rest of us won't.
---
LOL that sort of is a blessing and a curse lol to good to throw away but heavy as hell. I would at least keep the jet pack  PA .
---
Did you end up uninstalling? 
---
I gave up on this game long ago but if I had stuck it out till this part I definitely would’ve left after this. Fallout 1st is insulting. They don’t care about you except what’s in your wallet
---
There are some strange hackers in adventure mode. I've met a few players who can unlock doors without picking or gaining a bounty, but this sounds pretty crazy
---
It can also collect water and food. And it can be a rare drop from a lunchbox =)
---
Weird that there's loot out there, cool find though.  
---
Was the map going to be bigger, or do game devs put stuff out of bounds just so the map edge doesn't look like a drop off into the void?
---
No, my record is still 12 tries (12th was successful) ;)
---
everything auusex said. its always the worst when you get the whole slide show stutter going.
---
You really need to get a sense of humor and more than likely, a man in your life.  Go paint your toenails or something and knock it off.
---
This all started from clown shoe wearing “peasants” throwing a tantrum over Bethesda adding the 1st subscription, then thought it’d be a good idea to go after all subscribers along with nuking their camps (when applicable). So now, a little dirt gets rubbed over their faces with jokes and satire, causing people like you, Ashley, to get so far stuck in your liberal minded feelings that you forgot this was a “game” and meant to be fun. 
---
So I’ll say it one more time for the people in the back. After you’re finished with your toenails, Ashley, myself and my fellow l’rds and ladies will have some Expresso. You can fetch the Royal fool while you’re at it. 🧐
---
:-)
---
We are good. Thank you
---
Have you completed the tadpole quests for the base pack?
---
&gt; 308 and a decent rifle teach them to go slow, crouch, and aim for the head...one and done
---
Problem with that is .308 is LMG/ Hunting Rifle Ammo, you'll get cleaned out everytime.
---
.38, 10mm are the low level Ammo
---
Funny because now everyone is paying a subscription fee to play fallout 76. So you were wrong.
---
well he has some sort of exploit figured out or the guy you teamed up with betrayed you by engaging in pvp on the side. how well do you know the person you were partied with?
---
For me it seems more like "resistance". Because majority of players I see have Fallout 1st and only few don't, so they outnumber.
---
Gotta at least get the standard backpack quest completed first
---
that would be awesome in a way though. put that bot to work on light duty as well :P
---
I’d like to see NW maps either in the ash heap or toxic valley. Visually they’re my favourite zones in adventure but are ghost towns with little to no players. I’d like them to see a little love in NW.
---
wow
---
theres a spot near thunder mountain near the workshop. i just moved out. got tired of fast travelling in and landing underwater. tons of room for purifiers though. I ended up going cross river and only setting up 10 purifiers instead.
---
If he goes to the event you are in, disengaged that event for him, he would just need to get hit by a stray bullet to be able to kill you. Pvp even in passive doesn't block it. I did that to someone at scorched earth becauss he kept pulling the queen into the middle of the rad zone and all of our high DPS people were melee. I went in to the zone, quit the event, popped up in front of his bullet spray and falling down I hit twice killed him. I rejoined the event and brought the queen back.
---
When i was leveling up an alt, a player waved Gift and dropped a bunch of stimpaks and nuke colas in front of me, what a gentleman! I ran to my stash to see what i could gift him back, and realized only thing i had on that character was some mutation serums, so I grabbed some and put them in front of him, he stood there never moved a muscle, I waited and waited, then fast travelled away and back, he was still there standing like a true sentinel guarding the paperbag.
---
You're several months too late. I started without you.
---
We're they using explosive weapons, by chance?
---
No I haven’t but it allows me to make the small backpack just not my atom shop ones
---
furious increase x9 per 5%, so maximum bonus is 45%.
---
Off the top of my head it's .01%, I believe. 
---
I'll run through the math real quick. 1 in 10 chance of missing, the first is 10%, the second is 1/10th of that, so 1%, next is .1%, then making the final .01%.
---
How is this PA irreplaceable? Did you mean the mods are hard to come by (such as shocks)? 🤔
---
Just put a request into support. Could be entirely legitimate and they just haven't gotten around to banning you until now. Could be a mistake.
---
Either way, contact support and see how you go.
---
Thanks added it to op.
---
You say my IQ is low and yet you ignore all my arguments about your fragile ego. You also ignore the fact that this is a multiplayer game and multiplayer games have interactions with other players good and bad. You say you are smart but apparently instead of just accepting that there are griefers in public servers and moving to a private on or even just doing something as simple as putting on pacifist mode is either beyond you or not good enough for you... both speak volumes about your character.
---
Lets move onto your “intelligent” arguments:
---
I am dumb because I lack respect for people and enjoy pissing people off. 
---
Firstly I do respect people but only people who deserve it and show character traits i respect such as strength ability to admit faults intelligence self awareness - and you only really have to have one decent trait for me to respect you. Before I’ve met somone or know them well there is literally no indication of any of these traits. I’ve met many players ive killed in game and they’ve brushed themselves off said gg and called it a day I respect these players - you are incapable of doing that it seems and therefore I don’t respect you.
---
Secondly it doesn’t make any sense at all intelligence is a completely different variable to lacking respect for someone someone can be a psychopath and be good at maths or another subject or good at learning or have a high IQ.
---
You also follow this up by calling me unintelligent because I’m unable to find things to do in game that don’t have to do with other players and pissing them off.  So again makes no sense also there isn’t anything else to do in thing game besides grind levels gear and mess with players. I’ve finished the quests that interest me I have most of the gear I want players in a game are content too I am content in the game for other players. It can be conflict induced content for something which you prefer like karaoke nights or camp building. You are more intelligent than me because you mindlessly go grind events all day doing the same dungeons over and over again while I am searching for ways to innovate  how the game is played like robbing players for junk saving myself hours of farming. I am now working on a method to make robbing players junk even more effecient. Setting up mule characters with high charisma to sell materials and drugs to make caps.Expanding a trading inventory for when the meta changes.Predicting what the market is going to do and trying to be setup for the shift of items.
---
So now you go onto insult me because I’m a young male and that high test  somehow makes me inhibited because I’m competitive? And want to establish dominance.The result of high test. Ok you can think that if you want but competition drives innovation look at wars its a sad loss of life but technology always rapidly increases around them. Businesses compete against each other to be better. There is downsides and upsides to everything I’ve accepted that you dont see eye to eye with me.
---
I honestly don’t care that I’m hated, all I’m asking is you put on pacifist mode go to a private server instead of ruining a game that has so much potential. I can’t do anything to you then but instead you complain here and ruin other peoples gameplay. And you cant say I ruin yours because it is within your power to prevent me from doing anything to you with pacifist mode or a private server. But you have 0 self accountability so you want bethesda to build rules to protect you because you cant do it yourself.
---
I understand that. Congrats on finishing the main quest. Now you have all the time to do events and loot.
---
to answer your question - as far as I know it works per pellet, so if you shoot big enemies you can max damage on second shots.
---
Wasted 1500 scrip at murmrgh’s today, completely trash tier, and they come in pairs. Two ghoul slayers with bash in a row, two hunters with bash in a row, etc. This happens even when I server hop every a few tries.
---
You cant skin the small backpack. Only the standard. You need to do the quest.
---
Thats 3 dollars i could use for food!
---
Nice try being a dick
---
Tested it, it works but it doesn’t. Bot eventually phases trough the wall
---
Yes I understand you are not competitive you are not forced to enter the competition and can run your marathon. But what you are doing is setting your marathon to go right through the football field impacting our game. You don’t need to do that and that is why the pvp and pve community clash heads so much. There is pacifist mode that would allow you to go around the football field but instead you mess with our game. all we want is for you to stop doing that.... pacifist mode can ve a mode that protects you from any pvp content what is wrong with that?
---
I think you answered your own question. Random switch does that.
---
Did you buy Fallout 1st? No, that's your problem.
---
L
---
Or it'll cost like the scavenger collectron
---
So if I am correct your point here is that they released a broken game, which is now after 1 year somewhat playable and this makes them look better? Bug and performance fixes should be taken for granted. Added free content and listening to community feedback is the thing that is important.
---
Yes because everyone needs to see a 'i've stopped playing' post when you can make like anyone else who has lost interest and go play something else
---
Class war. Class war never changes.
---
Oi Oi Oi
---
Eyyy, congrats! \*lifts a lead champagne in your honour\*
---

---
0
---
Amen
---
nothing is wrong with the current set up as far as I am concerned. In private I farm a weeks worth of fusion cores up at a time uninterrupted by pvpers then I go hang out on public servers with no worries. 
---
The original topic was adding pick pocketing to the game. I say no fuck that. its been my experience that griefers will abuse the fuck out of it. re open survival mode. allow that shit there.
---
I'd do this but my main concern? My camp is positioned on Seneca Rocks ._.
---
it was fixed within hours.
---
and was never a major issue. this happened to only a handfull of players. which have all gotten their stuff back
---
Should do it all the time especially if the turrets don't kill whatever they are firing at within 10 seconds (meaning a hard ass enemy) it's also partly the reason I moved to Seneca rocks and holy crap 4 turrets took up so much of my budget its ridiculous best move I ever made
---
They still have a vault to open... they said 2 raids, not one... Besides this is a ice related raid.... maybe they could go for that? But i think is under ice.... I fell they just dont have the man power to do most things they promise...
---
Hey, so.  If the government kicks down your door and arrests you for a crime you absolutely didn't commit, we should just assume you're guilty from the get-go.
---
You know, because the fact you have been charged with a crime is evidence are guilty of said crime. Also, your lawyer is also guilty of general unspecified crimes because they defend you.
---
This is trash reasoning and you know it.
---
No i tried it but it just acts like any other switch
---
Instead of repairing.. he destroys
---
Uff, probably not a good idea then
---
Or make like the Scavenger somehow invincible
---
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking lol either way I could never figure out how to tame an animal so
---
This is my main complaint about NW. 
---
I've never played a BR game before and I sort of suck at this one. The time I have to wait between dying in one match and getting to try again reminds me of unskippable cut-scenes/FMVs/dialogue before difficult boss fights in older RPGs, which just added to the frustration each time you lost and had to sit through the same interminable bullshit before getting to make another attempt.
---
While this "feature" is present to some extent in almost all of my my favorite old games, it's definitely not an aspect of them for which I have ever been nostalgic.
---
If your power armour is in your inventory, they do not have your power armour. They just had one similar. It's that simple
---
I don’t play this trash game anymore, they drip feed content and now they’ve delayed wastelanders to replace with fallout 1st. Don’t get me started on the non-existent endgame that’s been there since launch, have they even added the vaults yet?
---
Oh hes one of my good friends he wouldnt do that to me lol.  I know him well.
---
The usual, whitesprings, westek &amp; the purveyor are your best bet. Awol armaments can be a good event. 
---
The queen is generalky pretty crap loot, but good xp &amp; flux. Uranium fever at your level is good for scrip.
---
Sometimes player vendors can have a bargain. Yesterday I picked up a junkies ffr less vats laser. Although it's not my thing, was a good pickup for 5k. Believe it's worth possibly 4× what I paid.
---
Even though you've probably been everywhere by now, revisit places you haven't been in a while &amp; you might be surprised.
---
 Also lookout for horde events -don't kill the main boss &amp; then legendaries will spawn in,  that better suit  your level.
---
If u have enough caps u can buy a good gun out of players vendors,go shopping!gather scrip and buy legendary’s from the perveyor @ berkely station i think its called.for lead go to lucky hole mine in your escavator PA.goodluck
---
But the event was over after it ended he killed me when i was walking to the station.
---
No it was regular ammo I think he was sniping maybr a .308 dont know for sure.  Im sorrybi really dont have much i nfo on what he used as i didnt see him anywhere and it was too crowded with people all over the place.  Even though the event was over it was chaotic.
---
Lmao it isn’t about it being expensive. It’s  about the fact it’s absolutely pointless and not worth it at all.
---
Stop spreading misinformation.  Half the garbage you posted are fake rumors that have been debunked.  You can't even get the price of the sub right.
---
And if you think Skyrim Together is 'seemles's you're just trolling.  It has so many restrictions and limitations.  It's nothing compared to an actual multiplayer game like 76.
---
Wait, Ark? No bugs? HOLY SHIT that's hilarious.  You gotta be trollin'
---
Lol same here
---
will try tonight and hopefully get back to you
---
Currently redoing my shotgun build i did back at launch.
---
Hi, from reading your reaction I assume you signed up for 1st. I'm just genuanly wondering, is there a price point where you would feel like it may be a tiny bit expensive for what you actually get? Say it was double for example. Would you still have gotten it?
---
What system? I'll be on xbox at various times over the weekend.
---
No, you have to turn bulk items into scraps.
---
Have to scrap em to put them in
---
The real issue is the users that post here and don't play the game at all. Marketing/advertising workers getting paid to turn you away from a product and towards another. I fucking hate those people.
---
If you're gonna do that, don't use unauthorized third party program. Simple. It's like using biochemical weapons on ISIS and saying it was for the better good
---
They literally don't work. I tried.  Most things simply heal from shotgun blasts
---
If they were a level 200+, there is probably nothing that they need and either they had weapons they don't use or overweight to fast travel. That's what I do sometimes (i'm level 249). I even spent 6500 caps on a level 35 handmade rifle I did't need and crafted them a excavator power armor. Higher levels tend to help out the lower levels. Just pass along the good deed when you become a high level.
---
But with that reputation they've had, everyone already expects Wastelanders to come out bugged as fuck and require months to fix. So that excuse doesn't work. SEcond, thye can just tell us they're fine tuning Wastelanders as best as they can. Doesn't matter if the community thinks it's bullshit, it's better to say something than nothing.
---
Sorry man I’m calling your bullshit. NO WAY you finished everything with 90 hours. You might think you have but you haven’t. 
---
If they spend months to add new content and you are speed rushing them, you’re not enjoying what was created. You’re never going to be happy with what’s put out because content takes time to make, and you’re not giving it time to enjoy.
---
It goes poof. Be careful to not have too much more than your limit for sale, especially lots of ammo and decent legendaries. Had a guy buy 10k ammo from me and them some decent heavy weapons, probably lost 3-5k caps over it. Lesson learned.
---
I don't do trades either.
---
I remember when games released and you didn't run into bugs until you got to the point of boredom and started doing things outside the bounds of expectation for the game.  From SNES to PS2, before the time games could be updated via the internets.
---
Today, release dates barely mean a thing.  I have no doubt as a non-fallout 76 player that this game will eventually be "good" or the playerbase will die out so bad that it stops being supported (hard to tell which will happen first), but if the playerbase stays strong enough and that day comes, i don't foresee myself playing this game at it's base form (no additional payments beyond the game itself), and i don't foresee myself paying the $1000 (by that time) to feel i actually get the full experience.  On top of all the games that come out or that i'm waiting for to go on sale, i also don't foresee myself picking this game up on PC (My choice for visually impressive games) nor on xbox one that i will have to hook back up to my tv in place of the Xbox two that will be out by the time this game resembles a playable experience by my standards.
---
The things that have improved in the game so far given the list of the OP and some of the comments, what i see is literal numbers tweaks for a good portion of it.  Ctrl+f works in code editors and game engines just as well, so the conglomeration of those probably took 30 minutes to fix.  As for everything else, i'm sure it took some time, but 1 year?  Activision and Treyarch together successfully release a full Call of Duty game every year together (2 year development cycles).  I'm willing to place a bet that most of the "hard work" that has gone into F76 is on the atom shop and in meetings talking about how to turn this dumpster fire into profit.
---
To those who can admit that this game has about 10% of the objective value that a AAA game release should have and are still staying because of the community; hats off to you, i respect that.  To those who continue to try to defend and support this release encouraging developers everywhere to devote resources away from quality control and put those resources into paid content development (such as a $20 skin "microtransaction"); gain some self respect, maybe go back and play a link to the past, super mario world, or many of the other games that literally saved the gaming industy back when the market was full of dumpster fires like Dr Jekyl and Mr. Hyde on the NES.
---
It’s-   it’s not like that at all
---
in other words a way to exploit people into pvp most likely.
---
You're stuttering bro
---
It’s definitely fixed, you just can’t spawn at other player camps
---
Because op is not using the brain they have.
---
I'm on the public European servers and I've yet to see anyone with recognisable Fallout 1st assets. In fact, on several server hops last night there was barely anyone online at all...
---
I just saw that this got deleted, sorry to see it go. It was one of the most fun things in the forum in ages and brightened my day, so thank you for it anyway. You still got my vote!
---
If you gooify enemies with an energy weapon like a gatling plasma they will drop nuclear waste most of the time.
---
Lead is easy. Lucky Hole mine for ore. Charleston Fire Department, Green Country Lodge, Eastern Regional Penetentiary all 3 silos have gyms with weights.
---
For steel you can scrap weapons from enemies at Grafton Steel, West Tek, anywhere really. You can pick up weapons to scrap from Uranium Fever. You can grab a tonne of ore to smelt into steel if you look around. If you want acid you can get a lot from cave crickets. There are a pile of cave crickets inside the tree at Tanagra Town.
---
For Legendaries try Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, AWOL Armaments or even farm fissure sites for legendary scorchbeasts.
---
With the failure of vault raids, and the lack of any other meaningful content outside of a few face rolling events, what are people even doing in this game now? Especially since Bethesda isn't really doing much to keep the flame of hope burning, outside of dangling the prospect of Wastelanders being released next year?
---
Yeah we do. But more than half of those are issues that should have been fixed before release, and the fact it took them almost a year to fix some is already bad.
---
But we kept playing 
---
Then they pushed down the line the biggest update planned, and we kept playing because we thought, hey, whatever, it's for the best, they want it to be perfect.
---
Lol bro. They just want to ensure you can talk to NPC only if you're a member of fallout first.
---
Even better
---
Yeah I eventually got it as well. Made it my mission for last night lol. 
---
I don’t remember the name now ofc. But twin lakes and one other would just not count for me as well. 
---
Those were ofc the first ones I did XD
---
Fake news spreading about Fallout 76 and Bethesda? What a surprise...
---
Note: I'm not denying all the shit that Bethesda has done, but inventing fake news is just scummy...
---
No, it was 400.
---
Not a lot people invest in charisma perks with their main. In NW you have overpowered Charisma perk at 9. So up charisma to 9pts (at least)
---
I thought the cap limit was 30,000.
---
femiwhat
---
Please add me. I'm sure you're overwhelmed by now, but...please.
---
Ps4
---
Fallout blurst
---
Workshop still won't get a person killed unless you or one of your teammates is at it. Don't even need to own the workshop either, since all someone has to do while you're in the area is to start claiming the workshop and you get automatically flagged for potential pvp.
---
 It does not make any sense to add the color codes in Adventure mode since in this mode, only the way you wanted to build your character is important.
---
Actually yes, that would be great. Paying 15$ a month just to play on an “isolated” server and having a scrap box is not what I, personally, wanted to get from the subscription. Allow us to customize our servers, and run them in a way that progress on the server does not go to the main servers. I want to roleplay god dannit’
---
Bulk items are not scrap... so no... not a glitch
---
This is certainly true and very hard to understand.  Some of us see very few problems and others with very similar setups see huge problems.
---
You will not be able to do that if other guy will have pacifist on.
---
In case you missed it from the other replyiers op. bulked items can be scrapped at any bench. then you can put that in the stash box.
---
Not all high level players are like this. Im only a lvl 155 and im very generous. I would leave full sets of leather armor, a modded out pipe rifle, an all star bat ammo and chems on the two dead bodies outside the vault. Never stuck around to see who took them. I also know that as i was leveling up plenty of high levels would drop stuff for me. So the few are not an example of the entire community alot of good people play and are very generous.
---
WTF?
---
No he checked it was on.
---
Interesting if there is really a legitimate way to force pvp somehow we will have ‘fun’ time on adventure servers 😐
---
&gt;"If you gooify enemies with an energy weapon like a gatling plasma they will drop nuclear waste most of the time."  
---
&gt;so this whole time (been playing since beta) I have been laser gat heavy gunner I have had plenty of nuclear waste. the whole time I never even thought it could be my weapon affecting it.
---
It’s because you haven’t spent any money.
---
it should be a repeating clip of myself doing the mothman dance.
---
The point of bulking scrap is to save space in your stash box.
---
The point of the scrap box is that you have unlimited space.
---
Why would you bulk together items to save space in a bottomless box?
---
I agree with you dude. Thirsters want the game to be piss easy for them but still dont understand that farming a private server with all your own settings would kill the entire economy. 
---
Supply would be way up and demand would be way way down
---
Pc users can use tutorial guides to run multiple Fallout 76 characters on the same account in one game. These characters can meet each other in the game and trade.
---
You didn't know you could do that?
---
Thank your for this post, now I can say something positive.
---
IMHO, yes. If it is the same guy. But that is because I liked the story and dialogue in past Fo games.
---
Also, I must squeeze in here, I think BGS does a great job in visual storytelling, especially if you slow down a bit and actually see what's in your surroundings.
---
Passive mode is null in a workshop setting so I can imagine they would easily make it null in a situation like I mentioned too.
---
Ditto. I'm even playing on potato internet most days and would still know the problem is with my XBox and not the game if it crashed every time I tried to play FO76.
---
the body you see through the crack in the wall holds an access card for the main questline.
---
I was taken back a little when I booted it back up in July after not having touched it since beta. 
---
I was all like "Nah they did something here"
---
&gt;The responders vendor bot has been murdered!! Changed the room behind it, added a basement.
---
yup, they changed it a few months ago, im glad your excited about the area changes though
---
&gt;And the top floor is not accessible
---
it is acessable, you have already seen where the card is hidden. theres a new typr of goodie knvolced there as well. happy hunting!
---
Did you do any data mining? Heard there was a ban wave based on software (something ominously called a cheat engine) they use to look at the game files.  Just a rumor.
---
This happens to me sometimes when I stealth. Maybe it's a bug with stealth, not specifically with shotguns?
---
Everything I’ve read/seen is 50% total bonus.  I’m not saying 45% is wrong, but where did you get this number?
---
But like, not even that though. I know it's easier to get stuff in a single-player game, but in F76, it almost feels intentional sometimes how scarce things seem to be. I could empty out entire neighborhoods and only be 20-30 units above my Carry Weight.
---
I don't, but poll was posted to me so I answered.
---
Why are you so offended by this when this post is about the high level players that cleared out the vending machine.
---
Could it be that you are one of them, and that's why you got triggered?
---
ah yes, the "go eat cake" route
---
Yep reason I don’t bother with junkies because for most enemies I use my instigating one to one hit them and any boss is going to take multiple shots anyway, so furious is perfect on a shotgun.
---
it's not a rented server though
---
I certainly haven’t gotten my stuff back. They said they’d notify me when it was replaced, and I’m still waiting.
---
I certainly haven’t.
---
&gt;TSE weapons killed pretty much everything in one shot
---
i miss that so much
---
both two shot and explosive are so meh now
---
shotguns are flat out trash now lol
---
don't remind me LOL
---
i hopped for hours to get jetpack and calibrated shocks for me and my SO
---
Baaaah
---
I haven't nor currently play any CDPR games, nor has CDPR scammed me. Besides, how does someone being unethical justify someone else also being unethical???
---
You pay 13 for one month of mobile service and home internet service? 
---
Try 200+ here in the good old U S of A
---
I did the event just twice. just to see. I don't really care about costumes since I am always in power armor. then the rest of the time I carried on with my daily business. when the event was on there was usually a mass of 5 to 10 dots doing it and then around the map were another 5 to ten players not giving a crap . so that's not 72,342 players in game . that's 72,342 players doing the event.
---
&gt; The servers though, should cost money.
---
they are not servers though, but yes, actual servers obviously can't be free
---
I'm pretty sure the argument isnt the improvements. But the fact that 70% of the "improvements" shouldnt have been needed in the first place and that there release of content is that it releases completely broken or breaks other things aswell as the lack of time said things took to get boring if they wernt already. I played since the beta. The things this game are doing are downright terrible and shouldnt be praised.
---
You lose anything over 30k so I keep it at around 15k.
---
Not sure why they decided to have such a low cap limit or even a cap limit at all.
---
In this case a rumour based on fact.
---
Long story short a handful of people that found a serious - and exploitable - security flaw and reported it to the developers so it could be patched before the shit hit the fan got rewarded with a ban.
---
It is my understanding that despite customer support's best efforts at incompetence the matter has now been resolved.
---
Fanbois still downvoting every comment that mentions 100$ customer support dlc or similiar xd
---
It's pointless, mainly because even with all reddit readers will join (which 100% won't happened, since some people don't care and some actually have fun), reddit community is just a fracture of all player that play F76. 
---
So forget it - if you don't like it, there are millions other games you can play in the mean time.
---
I get better performance experience on private servers, for the most part.
---
Since you always get gear appropriate to your level from the Purveyor, in your case max level, I find that she’s really the best source of legendary equipment. You’ll need unwanted legendaries to break
---
I personally spend a lot of time on the eastern side of the map, and tend to walk from one daily quest to another. The Mire seems to be the best area for stumbling across legendary enemies, at least in my experience. Daily quests pay out scrip as a reward, and it’s fairly common to get one star armor as well.
---
Between events and farming, I have no trouble breaking down 150 scrip a day, plus extra.
---
Utilize player trade forums and get familiar with what weapons/armor are highly desirable.  I guarantee you’ll get just about any gun you want for an unyielding/ap refresh/sentinel heavy combat armor piece or bloody/vats crit handmade rifle.
---
If you get a heavy gun with interesting effects, try it out. Just because you heard that a two shot gatling plasma is the best doesn’t mean it’s the best gun for you. I personally hate rotary heavies, because of the spin up mechanic and aiming bug, and I do more than fine with a 50cal and LMG.  I prefer the Furious effect with faster fire rate, because I like my heavy character to operate at high health, and I find faster fire rate to put out more DPS than explosive ammo. Is it the highest DPS? Probably not, but I find it the most comfortable to use.
---
I had a friend.....once,
---
Because not everyone has the ability to coordinate teams together for stuff like this. And I like the hunt. I would do what you're describing but it doesn't replace the stalking and waiting aspect I liked about survival.
---
Yes, yes it was
---
Lost so many caps buying plans just to find out I already learnt it
---
Armor
---
The FFR gamma is fuckin deadly. When I'm sparking up with a couple people and the explosive laser and gamma waves come at me at the same time it's 100% over. Not only that it ruins you upon respawn cause now you're at nerd rage rad levels.
---
Let's agree to disagree.
---
It still happens for me from time to time
---
For real? They posted a summer roadmap when summer was almost over. Roadmap for 2020, if any, will most probably come in May-June
---
   Even the event speaks for itself. Came on 29th before the holiday and some rewards were not there until the holiday was over.
---
Is your account actually banned, or did you just get the message? They sent me a message saying I was banned forever but it was just another error
---
Luck, bloody mess is a must. Charisma, tenderizer or suppressor.
---
Armor, because you are more likely to deal with physical damage.
---
My guess is patch 15 will come next year with wastelanders. The servers will probably be empty by late December
---
Those teslas though 🤷‍♂️, it's a hard choice. Had to fight off 2 different people tonight with exploding gatling plasmas tonight lol. Ebay weapons.
---
It’s $8.33
---
“At least”. That’s a different currency.
---
A rare piece of wisdom! Love it or hate it, it's just a video game.
---
"All future Fallout 76 content will be completely free you guys!"
---
Congrats. I hope he treats you better than Bethesda treats it's playerbase.

Yeah totally get what you mean, I mean the ideal scenario is to grind for both then have both in your inventory and switch our when you need to. God damn Tesla’s are annoying AF, you could be having a great duel and then some kid gets salty and whips out a Tesla and stealthboy, I mean I know it’s in game and all but man Tesla’s are no skill boring-ass weapons, I’ve got my tesla about two months ago and I haven’t taken it outta my stash since the first week I’ve had it. It’s so much more fun ducking for cover and aiming during a fight than some invisible dude just sprints up to you and starts shooting around you and still gets tags. I dunno I just think the PvP element would be so much better without tesla or VATS.
---
You gain more than us in average, believe in me.
---
This is my point, $13 is not too much to you, but if you consider other countries, $13 in a considerable amount.
---
Appalachias first ladies and gentlemen!!! Come on down and fly free
---
No. Just freaking no.  Two words come to mind when reading this, greedy and entitled.
---
Don't worry guys, the absolutely mind-blowing, never before implemented idea of NPCs in an MMO will be released ASAP**.
---
** Bethesda retains the right to delay content updates until they are satisfied they have sufficiently fucked the community into the dirt.
---
Haha thanks buddy! It was too fun :)
---
Just think of the plastic you'll be saving now.
---
I was talking about the explosive effect in General.
---
Now we understand each other.
---
Yeah, I'm sure the millions upon millions they made when this game released wasn't enough to put some fucking NPCs in the game. Fuck's sake.
---
That's the state of how games are developed today. You will obey the shareholders, fuck the gamers.
---
Yeah it is, but really all of it can be considered cheesy. Like you said vats is bad too. Just tap a button and auto aim lol.
---
You got the right idea my dude. This pile of shit will never be playable. Don't waste your time and money by giving it to people who literally couldn't give a fuck less about you.
---
Tenderizer. Increase damages.
---
Just compare it to the amount of content wow has and then put their prices side by side. One of them isnt worth it.
---
For a proper weekly blog series you need a decent game a certain amount of players are willing to play and you need a transparent developer.
---
Both is not given.
---
Armor. I use it all the time unless I need to switch to high capacity because I got too fat.
---
Someone I’m the comments corrected me.
---
Awsome. You should have a grate floor with  some fan ceiling lights underneath it,to simulate the maxi fan that makes you levitate in these indoor facilities.
---
They made a design decision to make the players the only humans in the game.  They decided that was a mistake.  Fixing this mistake is definitely costly.  They don’t have a time machine to go back and change that original design decision to not include human npcs in the game.
---
Thanks. Definitely never seen it.
---
Too bad you're getting downvoted , you're so right. Infinite junk could have been a thing since a long time ago.
---
Dude... I am 37, been shooting for twenty years. Instructing for ten. Subsonic ammo can be very effectively silenced. They don't 'click, click' like in films, but you would never say 'someone Is shooting' if you heard it next door. 
---
I don't know if it legal in your country, but even home made silencers make a difference. 
---
Sorry if you felt offended, I didn't mean to. Peace.
---
Depends on the build.
---
For my Gunslinger. Plasma Flamer.
---
Pros:
---
 
---
 * large Mag
---
 * high dps
---
Cons:
---
 * short range
---
For my Commando build. Handmade rifle.
---
 * overall the best automatic rifle without cons
---
50cal
---
I think Bethesda uses AWS, there’s no cap on servers. If they need more servers they spin a new one up. 
---
They didn’t reuse them for fallout1st. They got rid of survival because few people played there. That’s where you used to go to run vault 94 because less people = less lag
---
Yeah I really like the world of FO76 but the gameplay through which the story is actually told didn't really do it for me.
---
It was a question directed at @Baronik , the guy who corrected you.  But thanks for the response. 👍
---
Outer World's is just "OK" in my opinion. Unless you play on hard, you will quickly grow bored of the combat. Even on hard I am straight up one-shotting almost every mob. The only other play option revolves around continually eating and drinking. I honestly would love the game more if the combat was significantly more difficult.
---
I don't whether you can actually camp there, but Lake Eliose next to vault 96?
---
The slide still rattles is what I was getting at.  Suppressors are definitely not legal in New York. I’ve shot an mp-5 at a show once, but that’s it.
---
My buddy and I used to fill a paper towel tube with toilet paper and tape it to the end of my little Ruger 10/22 when I was a kid. It actually worked alright.
---
Its not just shotguns that this happens to. Every TS weapon I have used also has this issue. And its really really fucking annoying.
---
That’s a really good idea! Next time :)
---
Good luck. 
---
If you get a reply out of them, it will most likely be "Too bad, so sad." :(
---
Gotta say... you kind of come off like a jerk and acted very rude to the poor customer service rep.  
---
I am guessing there is more to the story here.
---
Get armor and don't pvp
---
Well,. That’s how Reddit is supposed to work.
---
If the post isn’t adding value to the discussion at hand (and a snarky comment about the subscription is not adding value) then it‘s supposed to be downvoted.
---
Bloody knuckles
---
Pros-no ammo,great damage,looks amazing, and works stealthy and charging in wolverine style
---
Cons-range...and I'm not wolverine :(
---
You do realize in order to code npcs to work with the more the landscape and the enemy's isn't an easy task they probably have quite a large team on it meaning they are paying slot of people for this said people are probably working overtime now as they wanted this realsed much earlier than it will be and now have to pay them even more the average salary per year for a programmer in the US is about 72k now Bethesda has around 400 employees not all of them are programmers lets say only 50 of them are and lets pretend they are all working on this disaster (I say pretend because I doubt there's that many people but who knows) now 50 x 72000 =3,600,000 a year not that's not including artists, voice actors, writers ect. Imagine paying 3.6 million dollars a year to people who just write the code for you yeah your gonna try to squeeze every penny out of their code as you can
---
I've put thousands of hours into this thing as well.  My advice to you, would be to add some other games to your rotation. 
---
Additionally, consider reaching out to get some proper help for things in your life that are eating you up.  Video games may make passing the time a lot easier, but they aren't going to help you get any better.
---
This is awesome! I wish people would share more of these types of videos to show the fun you can have in this game.
---
I have a hard time believing they didn't have a plan to release a DLC, and within that plan NPCs didn't exist. I don't think they rewrote or scrapped whatever entire DLC they had planned due to people stating they miss NPCs.
---
You leave the one person who handles the support alone, its very hard when you have to use bing translator to find out what emails say.
---
You've put way more thought and effort into this than Bethesda ever has. I LOVE this concept so much
---
If it gets enough upvotes, they'll usually give some kind of response. I dont really mind if it's an atomic shop item since the northern lights power armour which had alot of additional things on it like the lights and the sounds was only 500 atoms which is quite a bit cheaper than most power armour skins. Also even if it was fallout first , that's a pretty good skin to be getting on top of all the ranger skins and the other bonuses for £11 a month
---
Without warning? Read TOS. Without explanation? If you would only read... they are still investigating...
---
Maybe but why do it so early. Good chunk of US wasn’t even home from work yet to purchase it
---
And never get a response from them because hes not a FO First customer and therefore doesn't matter to Bethesda.
---
You are to me!
---
There was a recent bug or exploit which leaked user data of those using the exe. based launcher instead of their launcher. Or at least that is what I heard from the author of Map76.
---
I can agree, however I have one issue with it being permanent. This game isn’t like other fallout games, and permanent means something completely different then any of the other fallout games. In those games if you didn’t want something, you’d just reload a previous save. In this game you can’t do that, so normal people would have to have a 3rd bar they need to keep track of. I get it doesn’t work with the lore, but is the constant ability to change your character’s face and gender lore friendly? This game has proven a couple times that lore is not it’s main concern (cryolator, vertibots, mutations being fully cured from rad-away, etc.) so why would it force you to be a mutant? I’m not saying you need a “human serum” that prevents all mutations, because that still locks out your abilities and choices permanently. This game is all about change with your perks, mutations, etc., so why lock people out of a choice if that’s not a part of this game? Even with Wastelanders, they said during a conference that nothing was permanent.
---
Yep. Tell them you want to pay for a subscription and you'll suddenly see your character and all your inventory reappear..
---
Take your own advice. Most people don't have the anti-atoms zealotry and absurd entitlement. People getting something extra for paying for it if they want to and can afford to is something that exists in every other component of life. 
---
It's been clearly shown that the vocal minority that impotently rages about things like this are the "few" and most people don't have the issues. 
---
Your idealism and detachment from reality is undeniably fanatical as you can't even see that maybe it is actually YOU who might be wrong and that anyone who says anything other than you believe with your shit colored glasses is the idiot? Lol. 
---
Yeah. Ok son. 👍👍
---
"content".  If you meant 1st, that's not exactly content.
---
Love the plasma flamer but one other negative is the ammo consumption and rarity.
---
I agree.  Quite steep for basically solo mode.
---
An itty bitty extra ER isn't gonna save you. You will have better luck wearing leather armor. You'll deal with ballistic DMG way more than energy, and explosive damage is ballistic too.
---
But then one day you'll come back and not have any junk
---
Xbox?
---
Who tf do people think they are. What kind of a dickhead would participate in something that they *know* you don't like! OP must be stopped.....       
---
Seriously though get off it.
---
I still wonder what his deal is. Was he an eyebot that worked as an advertiser for the house of scares, is that why he hangs out there? He’s such a strange character and its a shame that we have absolutely no lore on him.
---
It does sound like a possibility, after all, everyone still gets the expansion for free in the end. However, I am not sure if this would be a good idea, there would likely be a huge outrage, and it would spoil the full launch of Wastelanders. In my opinion, it might be better to use the expansion to encourage new sales of the game itself instead, maybe even give 1 month of free subscription to anyone who buys a copy at launch. That combined with a free weekend would make the game attractive to many people who prefer a single player experience similar to the previous Fallouts, and did not buy FO76 until now.
---
I think it's a fun idea! 👍🏻🎄🎄🎄
---
When I first played the game in November 2018 I noticed how close u have to be to do mellee damage, compared to fallout 4
---
Hmm that’s interesting, I haven’t noticed too much wonky with the one 2 handed weapon I use, which is like a hook on a broom stick lol
---
It's absolutely impossible to know, since your account could have been banned right after you stopped playing months ago, whether this was for legitimate reasons or not. Why even bother to dig this up now and immediately post angrily on Reddit? Not like any of us can do anything about it or have any way to prove whether you deserved it or not. How do we even know you DIDN'T get a "warning or reason" if you stopped paying any attention at all to the game so long ago? This is a knee-jerk reaction without waiting for a response from Bethesda, and you are just yelling on the internet and stirring the pot. Have some patience and let the evidence and official response come in. You already supposedly waited "months" without caring to play already. Give it a week like you should have done, THEN go complain publicly if you still feel slighted and have some evidence you weren't doing something naughty.
---
Tenderizer increases the damage your target takes by 20% for 10 seconds after the first hit. It's very powerful, especially when paired with an initial splash damage attack like a grenade.
---
Oh the memorys
---
They knew you wouldn't buy the fallout 1st membership since you quit so they had no interest left in you lol
---
I still feel bad for the level 20 I had to kill poor fella rage quit before I could scrounge up my mike.
---
Two reasons, then you listed four, I must of missed something here.
---
Oh..... whine whine whine moan moan moan. Get over it. Join the other side. Don’t be like those people who are against the 1st membership. It’s worth the money for a tent that can be place anywhere for quick scrap. Box and sleeping area with instrument and cooking station. Atoms every month. Exclusive skins and outfits, icons and emotes. Seriously, are you done yet?
---
Gatling Laser all the way. High tech, looks cool, sounds cool, easy ammo (top reason tbh), great damage. Just the spin up time is sometimes annoying.
---
ROFL, I preordered the game and have played from the broken ass "beta" where you only had a couple hours a day to try it out. I can tell you this game has gotten worse and worse with each patch, the only time it was "getting better" was around fashnacht. Has nothing to do with "youtubers hating the game". The problem is the game sucks right now, it has almost no real end game content, it has no real economy as caps 30k limit is less than most legacy weapons values, you can literally buy any of the serums/PA mods/etc. at vendors so no point in being a crafting character. The server stability is absolutely atrocious with people even getting DC'ed on private servers. The amount of hackers is insane, and bethesda does nothing about them.
---
But yeah it is just the "youtubers" causing this games problems, not the buggy mess of a game that got released a year too early.
---
Also your claim that if you have no friends it will suck, then why is bethesda literally selling private servers to play on solo? LMFAO
---
Why am I becoming over encumbered so quick?
---
*Opens inventory*
---
*30 missiles*Huh
---
The other fun part of melee is htting the enemy, hearing the sound that you connected, knowing they should be dead and then getting hit by them one more time before the game catches up and they finally go down. At least that was my experience, blocking almost never seemed to be timed right either. 
---
Granted I will admit some of these problems I had might have been due to my slowish connection, YMMV. 
---
 My first character was a melee one but I got so frustrated at times that I just changed him to heavy guns with only occasional melee. It also sucks during events when people kill the legendaries and other enemies from range before you can make it there to get a hit in.
---
try the sledgehammer, I've died A LOT by missing attacks on enemies that are right in front of me. Never had that issue with 3, NV or 4
---
I have accelerated TS minigun. It melts enemies but also my ammo.
---
PlayStation sorry!
---
The sooner this sort of talk goes away forever, the better.
---
How’s about it be in the base game I paid 200 bucks for? No? Okay then fuck those greedy fucks. I’ve pumped so much money into Bethesda because I love fallout, but they’re getting no more cheddar from me. They’ve destroyed the brand and over marketed it to death. There is so much fallout shit it’s ridiculous. I’m tired of it.
---
Sounds like the pole hook. It’s a great weapon, especially with the armor piercing mod.
---
I remember post with datamined numbers. They can drop, but chances are something like 0.0001%
---
Nearly every good weapon or piece of armor I have was purchased from the purveyor. Grind events like Leader of the Pack and Uranium Fever to get crappy legendary items to sell for scrip.
---
Only scrapped items in the scrapbox. If they allowed bulk items that would actually double the item count in the box and make it more resource heavy. That's why everything always gets automatically scrapped by the box when you try to put it in there. It treats bulk like the other junk items that have uses and shouldn't be scrapped. Once you bulk junk you have to put it in your regular stash.
---
I know the chances are extremely low, I want someone to explain to me why only 4 out of 5 masks emerges lately...
---
In the end it doesn’t matter.  The posts should be down voted because they aren’t adding value.  It’s been what, two weeks now, the joke is old and stale. At this point, I would almost wonder if some of the people who are just SO mad with the game that they have to keep making comments like that, yet stay on the subreddit, or worse, stay playing the game, are dealing with some type of sunken cost fallacy issue - where they can’t just walk away from something that they don’t enjoy anymore, to the point they need to try to make it so others can’t enjoy it either.
---
That happened to me the other day as well, got the same email and guess what haven't played in 3 months. My only character was level 52 not hacks or mods, also play on ps4 so its too funny. Hence why from my own opinion I will not be buying trashthesda products any more gg trashthesda
---
I'd much prefer a harvesting bot to grab all of my crops while I'm away
---
Just purchase fallout 1st and you'll get unbanned
---
Idk some might be mad, i can understand why but it’s more like funny to me how ridiculous bethesda is now
---
Yep. Quite the lazy "balance" mechanic.
---
It's pretty bad and I'm sure it's because of how laggy the servers usually are. De-sync is a bitch, the enemy is in front of us in our screens but due to the high ping, by the time when we hit them, they are in another place already on the server, that's why there are so much unregistered hits even though we apparently had hit them.
---
On the rare occasions when I get in a smooth server, it's a night and day difference, not just the hit-reg is way better, but the whole game feels less buggy.
---
If a video game is capable of causing you "so much pain", you're doing wrong.
---
There was twitter post with a guy in excavator power armor and sun mask on fasnacht time. The only time i have seen it
---
😕
---
I gotta change my passwords.
---
That's exactly what I down voted it
---
Every time I find t-51b I paint the parts in Nuka Cola paint
---
I have had no pain, it doesnt effect me. Fallout 1st was a terrible idea but it doesnt effect me, so i dont let it ruin the game for me
---
i don't know. Post is deleted for now https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3r5hr/fasnacht_mask_drop_rate_poll_results/
---
And people keep saying nothing has changed with this! Mostly people that don't even play.
---
I remember the stress test sessions. I actually recorded them for some reason lol
---
If so, and masks haven't appeared on the market because they were stolen from dev room, means they've been legitimately dropped and only duped to oblivion due to recent duping glitch?
---
I think so! My friend was talking about this yesterday haha
---
See ya when star field comes out
---
Too lazy to translate that but i don’t mind people still having fun in the game and im not trying to stop that but the fanbois that keep defending bethesda not matter what, can fuck straight off
---
No OP comments or replies since posting... Troll.
---
He’s working at full speed!
---
I use an array of different shotguns, some explosive and some not...have you noticed if 2shot makes a difference as well? I’m gonna try my nonexplosives tonight. Thx for the tip
---
This kind of issue has been around since launch. Consider it a feature
---
Shills rise up
---
Yeah fallout 76 for me on one x will hang up for up to 3 to 5 seconds sometimes and and opening the map can sometimes take 8 sec depending on if alot of stuff is around me.
---
Some guy went into the dev room and grabbed those 4 masks which can only be done on pc and now those same 4 masks are being duped or they just grabbed a bunch and are trading them for goodies. Hacking is insane on Pc right now its a shame...
---
So TS and Explosive cause the “damage heal”?
---
Only can be done Pc
---
Im a fo first customer and it's been 12 days with no response
---
Wish I could do this since I'm around level 80 but I'm always broke as shit
---
Its been like that for TS for me, I've never had a TSE. Only TS weapons. And everyone I have used the thing I'm shootings health with drop and then go back up.
---
&gt;(I hope I don't get downvoted to hell for some reason)
---
If you’re downvoted it’s probably for good reason, this type of post doesn’t add any value.  You’ve made up. Your mind.  There is not discussion to be had.  The only purpose it can serve is to continue stroking the hate circle jerk.  
---
I mean, in posting this, what reaction are you expecting?  You’ll have the people who agree with you, or the people who basically will just be ”Ok, whatever, I don’t care your leaving”.
---
No it actually hasn't. We are still sitting on 12 days of no response from customer support after making multiple tickets
---
This is literally the reason I quit the game
---
I was thinking of something along the lines of the Hadron Collider 😂⚡
---
Yeah but wasn't that basically a result of restoring their entire character from a backup, so they lost some stuff between then and the 'event' but got everything for the most part back.  
---
I don't think they can do anything past that and that method would be laborious i'm sure.
---
I was doing a daily photo challenge where you had to be naked in a fashnact mask - used my witch one with my teammate and i dropped it on the ground for him to pick up and then my game crashed. Logged back in - all gone.  
---
I had timestamps, obviously the pictures i'd taken proving i had it etc etc they can't do diddly.
---
I dont even want to imagine working in some of the departments of Bethesda right now. I bet some of them really have it hard. And they dont even make the choices, they just have to ventilate em and try to sell them to the public.
---
By now this reminds me off the kermit meme "this is fine" while the house is burning down.
---
Yeah I’ve  priced that with my TSE pump action and combat...gonna try some of my other non TSE’s when I get off work. Thx
---
Exactly this. The only way to truly show Bethesda how you feel is to not give them any more money. No more money spent on the Atom shop, no subscribing to Fallout 1st, and no pre-ordering/buying their upcoming games. There is absolutely nothing you can do regarding Fallout 76 to make them change direction, this is what their investors want and they are going to get it. The only hope to change things in the future is to let their future titles bomb. Look at Ubisoft and the new Ghost Recon Breakpoint as an example.
---
Yes. My melee character uses a meathook and deathclaw gauntlet and combat knives and machetes. All instigating or furious. Its terrible. Yao guis are like the bane of my existence cuz if i miss its over. Been this way the whole time.
---
This game is embarrassing for Bethesda so it’s mutual
---
I ONLY want to know why he stole 4 not 5 (whole set)...
---
Sorry to hear this my experience with this game and community has been great. I do experience disconnects but what Bethesda game isn't glitchy ( it's just part of the experience) the player base is what makes this game great and the bugs are kinda like the toll you pay for driving on the highway.
---
Apologies for the delay! You taught yourself English with Fallout? That's very cool! And obviously, you did a solid job!
---
I think I started with Tactics (Fallout 1 and my computer weren't getting along). This was fairly recently, so I can't say the graphics kept me going. For me, it was the immediate "find the GECK". Having heard of the GECK from newer games that I had played, I was hooked! I shared how much fun I was having with it, so my husband started his up... and almost immediately went racing past where I was.
---
I struggled a bit with the interface  (what do you mean, use a bomb?? Where and how do I do that?). In the end, totally worth playing. Wish me luck! I'm still not done it. At least Windows is more stable than it used to be! 😄
---
Bethesda: Whale Hunter
---
Fallout 1st is basically an atom subscription with bonuses thrown in. I don't know that I can afford it, but I love it.
---
I would never buy it then because I sit afk all the time.
---
I thought that logo was a wolf .\_. 
---
the more you know....
---
Happens on every weapon in the game, and has since launch. It's my #1 issue with the game and ultimately the only reason I don't play anymore. As far as I know, there's no fix.
---
Fixing the damage bug should have been their #1 priority, but they've neglected it forever. I could ignore all the game's other flaws if I tried hard enough, but this obvious negligence is what has made me lose faith in Bethesda.
---
Let me know if it does.
---
I don't think Two-Shot would make much of a difference because, correct me if I'm wrong, Two-Shot only adds 1 additional pellet to shotguns instead of a whole separate set of pellets.
---
Ps4 1st is 15.99 a month. I never once said anything was seemless, but ark and conan can actually hold themselves up better that fallout can, and are better deserved of their monthly pricing. And yeah, never played ark. However its servers function similar to conan. 
---
Its actual shit thats been going around on ps4, not debunked "garbage" as you put it.
---
My question is why can't they just post this?  Give people something to look forward to. Why aren't they teasing game play video from Wastelanders?  Honestly anything would be good.
---
It's in Institute.
---
Well, I don't know then. It doesn't even play the burning animation for me, it only gives me the option to TAB) back...
---
definitely looks like a wolf...
---
Me too.  I've been rocking the Arktos lab coat forever, and had to take a closer look when I learned this.
---
I've been back and forth with them over something stupid(50 atoms, two challenges completed without me doing anything. That play NW first then log into adventure bug. I didn't know about it at the time). Provided everything needed(challenge names, screenshots, etc). They've had me provide it all three times. Still no resolution. I'd venture to say the only ones they want to support are the whales and fo1st members.
---
Same thing happened to me a few days ago, pretty much played it as a solo game and bought 1st just so i could completely solo. Level 151 and just banned with the exact same message you got.
---
yeah..so im confused about the bear now
---
When I got the White Wolf Fedora, I knew that labcoat would fit perfectly lol wore it until I got the Ranger outfit, I occasionally switch out outfits
---
I saw a guy on Tuesday wearing the old man winter mask on xbox.  I thought this mask was insanely rare? He initiated  a trade and the dude was carrying mountains of god roll weapons and armor.
---
He already had it, iirc. They just think they know it all and don't want him "cheating"
---
Yes, that is pretty much how most online games restore items, if they don't have any kind of system in place to see what each character has and had. 
---
The fact they don't have a system in place like that is even worse, and shows why they will never be able to stop dupers, because they have no system to watch what is in players inventories.
---
Can we stop suggesting to Bethesfa more ways for them to rip people off??
---
This would only be cool of it was given to EVERYONE as a christmas present.
---
No one's forcing anyone to buy it if it were implemented. If someone wants to spend their bought or hard earned atoms on something and enjoys what they've purchased than it's not really a rip off. And since this is only conceptual, if this were to make it into the game, maybe Bethesda would have it as a NW christmas reward
---
I came here to say this. Lots of sites out there that sell compromised accounts, and Bethesda sucks when it comes to security. So best to change your passwords often.
---
Yeah, bethesda had a massive bug that caused account info to be leaked. It is why they did an "emergency patch" on Saturday.
---
Very easily he could have had his info leaked in this bug and hackers accessed his account and used it to dupe or hack. That isn't his fault that bethesda had a major security breach.
---
Yeah sorry my bad i meant 50 caps just sold 2 in my vendor don’t know why I said 70
---
It's lag for an additional $12 a month you can have less lag.
---
I don't understand you, I'm sorry. I mean the burning animation that destroys the card and gives you the ticket, I don't even have the option to redeem them, sort to speak ...
---
Shotguns with all ranks in enforcer.  My ts pump action cripples almost all enemies in 1 or 2 hits. Compiled with a good backup melee weapon
---
 bethesda had a massive bug that caused account info to be leaked. It is why they did an "emergency patch" on Saturday.
---
Sure go ahead. Whatever floats your boat.
---
That's what I thought originally, but looking at it now the snout is broader and more bear-like.
---
Really? I've never heard of that before. Do you know where can I find more info about it?
---
Time to change my password.

There is a terminal in the Clarksburg location listing banned customers and customer complaints, the Lewisburg might have a similar terminal, I’ll check that out when I get a chance later today

You're right. If we don't act soon this could lead to dancing

Hey, I've been to this camp before a few days ago.

---
* can one-shot most level 68 enemies 
---
* high raw damage

---
* shotgun with sniper accuracy when zoomed
---
* satisfying harpoon sound
---

---
* missing a shot can be life or death
---

---
* no cosmetic skins
---
* no prime flechette receiver
---
Sit back and see for yourself.
---
Yeah once you you mentioned the bear it looked a lot more bear like
---
supplies: just playing the game  
---
spending caps: unless you really like building, do not buy plans. They drop enough from other things and spawn in at a lot of locations.   
---
building a camp: I am a builder and I can tell you the first stone is the most important. Having a natural resource close by is important in the beginning of the game.
---
But 1st includes things that are content. Like private worlds, stash boxes and probably more in the future.
---
Host thought she got robbed when she saw same excavator power armor, gave thumbs down then started attacking to those guys. I was just imagining things at side of random guys who were just socializing and dancing peacefully
---
I mean... you get the Bear Arm... not the Wolf Arm...
---
Yeah, look up what happened with the dataminers recently about 2 weeks ago. They found the bug and reported it to bethesda and ended up getting banned for it.
---
I have refrained from any comment until yesterday's JC video lest I muddied the waters further.
---
Now I'm truly confused.
---
overall: try to decide what kind of build you are going to use as soon as possible. You level up now very quickly so it is easy to change your build but after level 100, leveling up is much slower which makes it difficult to change your build. In the beginning it is okay to focus on more than one weapon type but after a while you're going to have to choose if you want to do serious damage.
---
I've heard that if you're not on game pass it's not really worth $60 dollars. I mean some people feel it's worth it but it only has a 20-30 hour campaign from several people who played through, some are already on their third playthroughs. Basically I've decided to wait for a sale on it
---
I just thought it was a wolf
---
By randomly collecting it for a year and not using it?
---
Last I checked I had ~700 BF scrap, without ever going out to look for it.  I sold most of it for ~8-9 caps per, and it flew out the vendors (in small batches, but very quickly).
---
Were it a bad game, I'd tend to agree. As it is, I still believe they should have fixed some obvious stuff by now, but the game itself (when 'it just world's actually works) is not a bad game.
---
&gt;If you died while over-encumbered you could only re-spawn at V76?
---
Just experienced this yesterday
---
The app leaks a lot of personal information still - although thankfully it does require some hacks/tweaks to get to it.
---
And my experience as well.
---
In u.s...and you're getting ripped off sounds like, both my internet and cell comes to less then 100...that's a phone with 25gb data and internet with 300/100mbps...
---
Why the hell are you paying 200+ dollars?
---
You can absolutely farm it.
---
Honestly? Figure out how to make 5.56 ammo in bulk (lucky hole mine with excavator armor + acid + steel + gunpowder). Trade that for the gun you want using LFGs, reddit or facebook.
---
Circle gets the square.
---
I read so many comments, and no one mentioned turning into Thin Man when you exited your power armour!
---
A TDM would be nice, specially for lvl 100 grinding...
---
Balance for Bethesda means a day and a half transitioning from one meta to a different one.
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn. :D
---
Does this apply to console as well?
---
- As a pure pve player I’m considering to change my build from melee + cal50 to Laser Gatling too. 
---
What (expensive) perks are a absolute must-have in your opinion?
---
- Regarding your question, a legendary super-slash and a decent cal50 was the whole year my way to go as a PA heavy weapon build in pve using just a lead workshop and my camp on a steel deposit.
---
Yeah but the actual players of the game want to see it improve
---
&gt;People who accuse all journalism of being corrupt admit of no oversight, they deny that it is even possible to try to be objective or informative.
---
So what does that say about this sub that 'grr games journalism bad' gets the upvotes?
---
Shooting you a pm so we can talk more directly.
---
Dancing...Dancing never changes.
---
**Prepares to Carlton Dance with malicious intent.**
---
Maybe they'll bring it in with factions! Might make more sense that way
---
Holy shit!! Didnt notice it  because i dont use tesla rifle so much but i guess ill have to store it in stash..
---
Wait for 3 more badges and get extra room
---
Say it on one of your other accounts my guy
---
You would have to ask the dataminers that found the bug, I know very very little just what they have said in passing. I know it was bad enough for bethesda to push out that patch on a weekend, so it must have been bad.
---
Dude you’re getting trolled.
---
No hitboxes are operating as intended. Its just a feature to make melee not too OP by making it harder ;p.
---
YES!! it’s like a one star pole hook or something that I picked up early on(I’m only lvl27) that’s still my main melee weapon, decent speed, decent range, decent damage
---
There was a rumor going around that the map we got now is not actually the full map but more like the middle with barriers stopping players from going to the other parts of the map wit speculation that BGS will release those parts later.
---
Refrigerated.
---
Yea way too much money, rather buy an extra month of xbox game pass to play tons of games on Xbox and PC. But yea if its 5 dollars a month I would buy it.
---
They already did this work for Fallout 76. The noclip documentary talked about the effort to stop making the engine center around 1 person.
---
for me its the bloodied explosive gauss the gun that makes my rifleman build worthwhile in comparison to commando builds that without doubt are still superior but not by much under certain scenarios  
---
pros:  
---
\- Up to 10k dmg per shot on the queen with the right buffs and circumstances   
---
\- 1.8k without buffs  
---
\- 1 shot most of the mobs  
---
\- Ammo is cheap to craft  
---
\- Gauss rifles looks bad ass  
---
cons:  
---
\- 1 shot per second slow fire rate  
---
\- The sweetspot dmg distance is quite annoying  
---
\- Ammo must be crafted since you can't rely much world spawn 2mm ammo for being so rare
---
It is as little as $8 a month. That is like an hour of minimum wage in most places.
---
I don't think it works as intended. With an auto rifle, your first shot, does exactly the same dmg as your last shot. I pulled it out of my set-up, and have been using other perks in it's place. 
---
I think it's bugged.
---
No I take "junk" off peasants actually, confiscation. Why do they need all of that junk? They don't have things, therefore they don't need all that junk, so in turn it would be better if it was in my private server. I have things that need fixing, my workers use it up quite quickly. One would guess they steal it and I may have to make an example of them.... As for now I will pour some more tea and think.
---
Bahahaha game has been out for like a year and you're already getting married to someone you met on there?! 
---
Like others have said why rush it?! You've got nothing to lose by waiting a few more years together. 
---
You fucking fools. This is going to end in a divorce.
---
Hasn't even been a year and you're getting married lmao.
---
Combat shotgun 
---
Advantages
---
- best weapon IMO for a vats build since each  pellet count as an individual hit for four leaf clover. 
---
- Great utility due to above mechanic for enforcer which cripples enemies in one shot (especially with explosive effect). Also makes legendary effects like vampire, furious and medic much more efficient. 
---
- only shotgun that can have armor penetration without the anti armor legendary effect
---
- more ammo efficient when within its effective range compared to automatic weapon builds. . 
---
Disadvantages 
---
- takes more to kill heavy DR enemies since each pellet deals low damage rather than one large burst like a rifle. 
---
- deals greatly reduced damage when outside of its effective range. 
---
- ammo is slightly more expensive to craft than other ammo.
---
Seemed to work against a turret. First hit was 60. Second was 72. PvP interactions are too tense for me to look for the numbers.
---
I have gotten emails from who knows trying to sell accounts so that could be the reason why, thia people might have hacked your account and sold it to someone else
---
I really think they expected to be dropping wastelanders right already. So that's holding up everything else. No real news to give us because it's all held up. Atom shop is thin right now too. Once wastelanders actually hits I think we'll find a lot more appearing.
---
I do like seeing the stats after events in a vague kinda way. Not exactly life changing but I like to see them.
---
Yes, they do if they used some unauthorized third party programs to 'datamine' stuff. Is this really that difficult for you to understand? You shouldn't do that! Why do I have to explain this to people?
---
It doesn't show me anything when I click on it
---
All platforms are available, one struggles with decision making, especially now I'm getting on. Still I've got it though, indeed. My wife says I'm most excellent when it comes to a good rogering. Splendiferous.
---
Probably that bug is only on PC?!
---
They hated Jesus because he told them the truth.
---
welcome to my world :P
---
Just responding as if it weren't cringey roleplay.  It will go away if I ignore it, right?
---
What is wrong with you, stalking me and talking about other accounts?
---
Vampires .50 cal .  No dmg other than radiation, large ammo capacity.
---
The ditches all around watoga would be awesome for hiding in.
---
That's a quest door
---
Yeah, people don't sleep for 8hrs or anything.
---
Yep, chemical valley!
---
Gonna guess not at all. Unlike the Greenbrier Hotel, Bethesda wasn't going to get an all access pass to a chemical plant. Besides, like many buildings in the game, Arktos has a moronic layout for an actual business.
---
Yeah, Coronation Street has been crap in the last month
---
Even if it ran 100% perfect, it should be part of the base game and completely free. 
---
For that reason, I'm out.
---
Except they didn't, they just reported to bethesda about a major security flaw that allowed others to steal other peoples accounts. It is why they put out the emergency patch on Saturday.
---
Yet, the people who reported this major bug all got banned even though they were trying to help bethesda. I mean ffs they literally flew dude down to the studio to test out NW, so they obviously trust them and value their opinions or they wouldn't have paid his airfare/hotel just to test out NW&gt;
---
Not really. The game is incredibly short. Grinding the same event 2000 times is not a prerequisite for finishing. I finished the main quest and all the side quests in way less time too, and that was counting all the dozens of hours I have spent just fucking around with my friends or building my camp.
---
It's crazy to me that a year later,  we havent had a single new perk option since launch.
---
To open a bar one day and also to go and one day make a large amount of Union Uniforms and hats along with muskets and arm everyone.
---
Ash heap. Yes I had that problem. I tried to move him away from the fire but it just didn't work.
---
lol k
---
that sounds like 700 atoms or a 1st content
---
Srsly you should stay away from pvp. You have no idea what hackers can do. They litally do 500k damage per hit  what's a 60 energy resistance do about it? You really shouldn't get too serious about pvp in this game bro, unless you are planning on griefing low lvl players without the ability to retaliate
---
Was all that Map76 controversy? I've read that post before and how they got banned when they discovered (and replicated) a major exploit, but didn't know that exploit involved leaked data
---
Yeah, I've had this myself pretty bloody annoying even though it clearly connects to their head
---
Wtf is wrong with this guy.. Kids these days, man...
---
Yeah, I use melee and a rifleman build that km currently trying to combine won't be the best but I'll make it work
---
The 10mm is massively underrated. I have one I keep in the stash (90% weight reduction ftw) and take it out when I have about 1300 rounds. I burn through the lot in an hour and stash it again until I accumulate enough ammo. Weirdly I've not had to fix it in about 4 runs too. So 4000+ rounds. Its still at about 150% condition too. Weird.
---
Better sights would be good though yeah.
---
It wasn't just Map76 it was also the dataminers from this subreddit, and they are still banned with zero communication from bethesda.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dtbg1h/despite_not_having_played_fo76_in_months_they/f6wbm8g/
---
But, yes that is the exploit, it allowed others to steal accounts or gain the information to steal the account. It was very hush hush, and not made public. From what I've gathered from the dataminers and others it was pretty major bug though that compromised entire accounts.
---
Try the [NukesDragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) character builder. There's a subsection for NW perks/stats.
---
Primary weapon dmg perk is essential, Tank Killer for rifles, frog legs for mobility, demo expert if you like explosives. Everything else is negotiable.
---
ok boomer
---
I'm about a half hour from there right now at the edge of the actual Ash Heap.
---
Tell me about. Sometimes I hear the sound of the hammer smacking the enemy and still nothing
---
As I said, it would be all cool and nice if they didn't use unauthorized third party programs in the first place. Who the fuck are they to accuse others when they are cheaters themselves?
---
I'll leave you to embarrass yourself here alone. Good talk!
---
Lol that's awesome :)
---
They didn't use any third party programs, they only used bethesda made GECK modding tools to look at the files. Using their own tools isn't unauthorized third party programs, it is literally the programs made by bethesda specifically to look into files.
---
Do you remember when you get an actual finished game with your hard earned money on day 1?
---
I loved reading this. I think I will hop back on and give 76 another go.
---
My friend purchased an account from one of those key sites and it ended up being a stolen account or something. So maybe someone stole OPs account and used it to cheat
---
I honestly didn't know there was a gingerbread in fortnite, I just knew it was the kind of game that doesn't adhere to any aesthetic discipline.
---
Doesn't help you got banned when a ton of PC exploits leaked that were being autobanned pending investigations by bethesda. 
---
Bethesda should've issued 72 hour initial bans and permas for second offenses and called it a day instead of trying to investigate every burner account a cheater used under the sun
---
You absolutely have no proof on that and I know a thing about banning  and they will not, repeat they will not ban anyone unless they are absolutely confident he or she cheated. I report people all the time and none of them gets banned. They keep asking for more proof and they don't ban them in the end. Imagine what fuckery one would have to go through to actually get banned
---
I requested a refund based on then fundamentally changing the game and locking balance updates and content behind a paywall.  The haven't responded in well over two weeks. Good luck friend!
---
I'm down
---
I mean the previous festive power armour skin didn't adhere to the games dystopian post apocalyptic art style, I thought why not make things more festive. Realistically we have to assume in the fallout person atleast 1 of them made a miniature gingerbread power armour suit for Christmas instead of a gingerbread house
---
I gotta know; what CPU do you use? I get a solid 120 fps at 2k, but you do it twice? I'm very impressed with your CPU and must know what it is!
---
ROFL, you talk a lot about proof, but offer none of your own.
---
Great, what’s ur gt?
---
Damn I’m wondering if its cause the facebook page is private :/
---
Jesus, now I'm scared... I hope this gets a solution ASAP
---
That could be the reason
---
Not sure
---
I agree that if we get it, it would be a shop item, but even int that case I would still save up my atoms to buy it anyway. The reality is (whether we like it or not), functional/convenience items will be sold in the shop.
---
I play on an HDD (I don't want to commit a yet-unknown amount of space on an SSD to this) and don't get lag beyond the usual suspects: a tiny bit in a nuke zone or at the Whitespring when there's a lot going on. Otherwise, a smooth 120 fps at 2k.
---
I remember playing the "beta" then having the game 40% of a week later. That's all that matters to me and I should have finished the PayPal dispute.
---
🦀🦀🦀 Bethesda customer support is non existent 🦀🦀🦀
---
I wish Bethesda would give me a Mr. Handy lol
---
What proof do I have to offer? I ain't the one getting banned or the one banning people, you drunk? Go ask that map76 guy or Bethesda
---
Another lie, as usual.
---
So basically expect an aid box in the future.
---
The Android app?
---
I don't remember this event.  Where does this event trigger?
---
I got lever action. Won’t be online for a while tho 
---
Do you just need to mod. I have all the mods learned
---
I'm genuinely curious: why should it be free? I don't really play any other online games, so I looked it up, and it seems to be reasonably standard to pay for private servers.
---
Undeadh1tman69
---
Lmg- 
---
Pros-
---
Fast fighter rate with high damage 
---
Common ammo type
---
 Kill bitches like its june 6th 1944
---
Cons-
---
Blows threw ammo
---
Hard to find
---
They already explained it, they were banned for reporting a major exploit that caused bethesda to issue a patch on saturday. The onus is on you to prove they used third party software to do so. They didn't, so it is on you to prove your accusation that they used the third party software.
---
And as for your claim "oh they wouldn't ban someone wrongly" have you been paying attention to this game? They already have multiple times.
---
Lever action plan at Camden park
---
I buy them at vendor and sell the for 2x at my camp and ppl buy all the time
---
Doesn't look like anything to me
---
Sneaky
---
pushed back
---
Here’s the a Pic of the Original post on FB 
---
[Original Post](https://imgur.com/gallery/t7eYyQI)
---
Your character name too.  My account name isn't AgShroud but that's what pops up in-game.  
---
If you use the default name, then you've given someone the lock, told them there are keys around, and to take all the time they want to figure it out.
---
Make friends bro. That's really the biggest best tip I have and that applies to any game. You're going to have more fun and stick around longer no matter what you end up actually doing in the game if your hanging with some cool people while doing
---
I've spent entire nights that only felt like an hour or so hanging on discord with people while farming events,hunting legendaries, or even just messing around in camps
---
And why the fuck are you believing them so easily? We've seen many banwaves so far, and all those that claimed innocent turned out to be liars and actual dupers or mules. On what ground you have such belief on one party and so much disbelief and hatred toward the other?
---
if its anything, rest assure its going to involve atoms.
---
Tbh I'd rather see different shots of local areas depending on where your camp is or something. Like my Camp is in the savage divide and have it show some areas of Top Of The World or even some of the wilderness. The photomode thing would be good too but I'm just thinking about how it would be done other than just a still or a slide show
---
There never has been a "technical limitation."
---
&gt;And why the fuck are you believing them so easily?
---
Because the dataminers have been working on datamining this game since launch, if they were hackers or something they would have been banned last year during the major ban waves. Instead they WERE INVITED TO THE AUSTIN STUDIO BY BETHESDA.
---
Why the fuck would bethesda invite people they think are hacking to the studio? Are you really this stupid?
---
Haha it’s kind of a death trap :) just a fun one
---
Remember when the scorchbeasts didn't have a pause between screeches so you either had to run away and hide, Kill it or die yourself.
---
Ill wait for a message on Xbox. See ya then!
---
&lt;3
---
During Beta night time was actually dark
---
Yeah sorry I got distracted I’m getting on now
---
Well you said it, datamining require third party program. Wtf?
---
Omfg cazadores. Thanks for bringing back that trauma. I did especially enjoy blowing them to pieces with thump thump though.
---
Arctic has bears, Antarctic does not....
---
LOL ok bud whatever you say.
---
No datamining uses a BETHESDA MADE PROGRAM. GECK is made by bethesda, so it isn't a third party program, it is a first party program. Which isn't against the ToS anywhere. Not to mention third party software is only against the rules if it is used to CHANGE FILES, looking at the content of files doesn't modify them.
---
GECK for FO76 does not exist. So you are saying those hackers made GECK for FO76 and are using it atm? Dang this is worse than I thought
---
Or you know.... they went to bed and possibly are now at work like a normal human....
---
&gt;then fundamentally changing the game and locking balance updates behind a paywall
---
Okay, now that's some real bullshit and you know it
---
No, the file extentions for this game are the same for every other creation engine game, which is why the GECK a tool made to look at those file extensions in the creation engine work in the creation engine.
---
Submit a ticket via Bethesda.net. Support will likely ask for two pictures be added to the ticekt. First a picture proving you own Razorhawk. And second a picture showing you cant add it to your Character.
---
That's because people aren't killing them
---
Packs of spaghetti dogs roaming the bog.  
---
When the hoppers at Mama Dulce's would destroy armor, weapons, and anything else that might have accidentally been put in it when spamming the button.  
---
Players would appear elongated and naked after exiting PA.
---
Scorchbeasts' sonic assaults were a never-ending bombardment
---
Storing an object in your camp build menu allowed you to build any variation of it without actually knowing the plans
---
When it took an act of god to find unruly golfers at Whitesprings
---
People would get stuck in their PA and be unable to exit it
---
T-posing super mutants only wearing underwear 
---
Killing a scorched would sometimes result in its neck being stretched like silly putty 
---
You were constantly told to kill a wendigo while wearing a clown suit, no matter how many times you did it
---
When deleting a blue print that contained wires from your camp menu would not remove the wires from your camp budget
---
explosive bobbleheads could be stacked to ridiculous degrees
---
Yes, because I base a game around some numerical rating.
---
We'll see...
---
Seems you are more upset he is calling Bethesda out than of the actual problem. Good drone, the Atoms will be dropped in your account shortly.
---
An extreme spike, no. I have noticed an increase in enemies spawning, generally, and maybe a modest up tick in legendaries
---
Bayer Pharma is actually German based.
---
Did they get their reddit account suspended too?
---
Did Bethesda release GECK for FO76 yes or no?
---
You had no problem trying to use those rating when you claimed anthem is a "more mediocre" game. At least with anthem there haven't been multiple lawsuits lost by anthem like fo76 has.
---
It was 1000 atoms and it was because it was T-51 only
---
My two shot Tesla rifle is fun with swarms.
---
Yes, bethesda released the GECK for creation engine games, at no time did they claim it was only for one game, but for the engine itself.
---
Who knows lol. People said item loss on vault raids was a troll too and look what happened.
---
Excellent additions, thanks!
---
You’re in favour in fallout 1st, that instantly gets you downvoted
---
SBQ is probably the worst chance to get a good drop.
---
Then it's Bethesda themselves to decide whether it's allowed on FO76 or not since they didn't announce nothing until now
---
Breh I drink use any rating. I used experience. I also dont give a shit about lawsuits and never have lol.
---
Inactive accounts are often targeted by hackers. Happened to me on Origin and Battle.net accounts. One time I received an email stating that I was banned for spamming, even though I haven’t touched the game in more than 8 months. Hacker’s IP was from Beijing, so I thought it was a bot selling gold or something from my account.
---
Those were people actually playing the game. My guess is there's way more to this story than OP is letting on.
---
Outer Worlds is pretty okay. The colors are beautiful and the characters are good. Everything feels shallow to me. 
---
Definitely worth it if you can get it in game pass. Don’t think it is worth $60.
---
Bulking only saves space on lead and aluminum, it is mostly useful for selling to vendor bots.
---
They DID announce before hand by their inviting the dataminers to their studio to play NW prior to it being released. Not to mention the numerous times the beth employees such as devann coming into the datamine threads and congratulating them on their findings and thanking them for their help.
---
So bethesda absolutely already stated it was okay with their handling of players using it for a year prior without issue.
---
When you're the only one on the server, ofc it's going to look like more.
---
People have multiple accounts and/or characters.
---
no. it's yours to keep
---
Nope! You get to keep it. Only thing it stops is the free atoms and use of the scrap box, and I believe the ability to place the survival tent
---
So by medicore, you mean in your opinion, not the opinion of the rest of the world. Got it.
---
One patch before the holidays sounds realistic, with the drought of news lately, they tend to be announced weeks in advance in the Inside the Vault articles to have something to write about, so that suggests patch 15 will come in late November at the earliest (definitely not the 12th, 19th is doubtful, maybe on the 26th). Then the holiday break begins in only a few more weeks, which seems too short for patch 16 to fit in with some additional time reserved for a possible hot fix.
---
He was being honest, after presumably having his account banned for no reason, I completely empathize with him and would be just as upset.
---
I don't really see why we need to treat Bethesda in a professional manner when  they have abandoned treating us in kind. If you go work for them I dont condone shooting the messenger but they sure signed up to carry live grenades with this one.
---
Issue is this was a Bethesda account suspension not just fallout seemingly. Maybe it was done by bethesda for security purposes. The lack of info in the ticket is an issue. If op used cheats it would have said so.
---
If you’d actually read the thread, we got to know each other on the game but we’ve always known of each other. We’ve lived in the same town our whole life and went to the same school, you fucking keyboard warrior. Take your bullshit elsewhere.
---
What does that have to do with Bethesda allowing GECK for FO76?
---
Enemies will detect you if you're not crouched I think, but still v good in pvp
---
If I listened to what the rest if the world had to say, I'd painted my bathroom with my brain matter a long time ago.
---
I'm not really in favour of it nor do I own a First sub, I have grinded out every atom I have ever spent and have never spent additional real life money on the game. if you look at my post history, you'll see my past arguments against Fallout First. But as  of late I've come to understand that there's no point wasting my energy ranting about it because they're not gonna remove it from the game.
---
If they didn't support that, they wouldn't have invited the people using it to their studio, nor would they congratulate them on their findings in threads with literally screenshots of the program open showing the files.
---
how is that bullshit? this is exactly what they did.
---
I have a fixer plan from yesterday. How much would you offer?
---
Apparently it's not even worth one piece of unyielding lol
---
Bye.
---
I got it for 500? I used the 500 I got from buying the game to get it and also there have been other skins which are free and for all power armours like literally every skin from Nuclear Winter and the engineer skins that were free for most power armour sets, so it's not out of the question to get it either at a lower cost or free as part of a seasonal event.
---
practice more and you won’t need Long Shot. then you’ll have a free slot for more damage/health perks!
---
That's just your assumption. Maybe higher ups didn't agree with that and decided to land a ban hammer. And I know nothing about them being invited to Bethesda studio to play NW would like a confirmation on that
---
"Upon further review, we have found that you have been storing an unlimited amount of scrap in an extra container and deploying a second CAMP location. This account will remain banned.

I'm not a fake account, I never even played 76 to begin with. I was just interested in at what point you would consider it too expensive. I care because I like gaming and I see this kind of stuff too much these days and way too many people are apperantly okay with it. I like to play Wow for example, 15 euro sub. I love the game, so I'm just about okay with paying that. But I would never go around telling people that it's somehow cheap, because it's not. It's pretty damn expensive. If it ever went to 20/mo, I would stop playing in a heartbeat, not because I can't afford the extra 5, but because at that point I would actually feel ripped off. You are basically saying that you are okay with paying 15/mo, for stuff that at absolute max should have been a pay once to unlock dlc type of deal.
---
I don't disagree. They did say it would be free.
---
I don't mind there being a charge for the servers. That makes sense to me. Maybe even some atom shop items or skins or something. But the rest of it looks an awful lot like something that could come with one of those "free DLCs" we were tokd about at launch...

The Steam release was probably meant to be tied to the launch of Wastelanders, so I guess it was delayed to 2020 as well. I would not say it is necessarily a "lie" though, just a delay, as the release was in all likelihood really planned in 2019 at the time (more than half a year ago) when the original announcement was made.
---
1st does not count as balance changes, mate. You know what that means, roght?
---
Where? Besides picking up 4-5 bags per day lol
---
What enemies drop it that you can farm?
---
No one is farming anything at those pathetic rates. Calling people peasants and trying to pay 0.01 caps per lead 😂
---
You can still take junk out of the scrap box, you just can’t add to it.
---
Seems fuckin legit. Fuckin' beth
---
I believe 2shot shoots an extra shell. The shells contain pellets so I’m not sure really. I’m fairly new to the world of Fallout, 76 is the only one I’ve played and didn’t even pick it up till 6 months ago or so. I’ll let you know how my “experiment” goes
---
Damn dude.. I gave away my last award to a comment before.. if I hadn’t I would’ve given it you! I know that’s not what your looking for tho! 
---
The way Bethesda have been treating is community in regards to fallout 76 is beyond atrocious, but in your case.. I am lost for words! You deserve a job at Bethesda.. not to be shut down by them!
---
Yes right ^
---
Oh you mean the months long content droughts with padded shit activities?
---
Bruh i've been subbed to WoW for 13 years, half of that was easily wasted content wise, so let's not go there.
---
You’re such a weirdo
---
It's a daily that comes up relatively often but it does not kick off just by going there.  You just have to be in the forest for it to spawn in your menu.  Make sure you have that quest set to "track" in your pip boy or it hides it.  I get it like every 2 or 3 days.  Every once in a great while on consecutive days.  Did it just last night on PS4.
---
He's not a dataminer, he just collects bug reports from others and comes up with an organized post. He's quite known in this subreddit who the fuck do you think you gonna fool?
---
I don't buy this BS idea of: Let me have this issue, post on Reddit about it, ask a question then I'm gonna straight to bed. blah, blah, blah. It's a troll just jumping on the karma whoring, Bethesda bashing, love fest that this festering sub has become.
---
House next to the Tea Pot
---
So yeah, you don't know what you are talking about:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/
---
One time someone or some people dropped all sets of full power armor down the road from the vault. Complete sets too. I was a level 30 or 40 or so, so I grabbed a set and left
---
Thank you for this info! I turn most of my quest tracking off, but will definitely turn this one back on.
---
Well OP, you might wanna tell us somthing special, they don't suspend without reason, so I say your clearly lieing... Might has somthing do with you cheating in nuclear winter maybe?
---
Said the uneducated peasent. You're so damn annoying boy. Go on will you, back to where you came from.
---
Nukacrypt
---
It's not less than minimum wage in Ohio..
---
That post you linked clearly state that he's a bug roundup guy and there's a section dedicated to dataminers and he's not in it. Are you blind?
---
Tryed i know the numbers but when i put in the location info just tells me cant find
---
Seriously? Seems like you have such an axe to grind with them that you can't wait for clarification and more information first before passing judgement. If Bethesda fucked up, I'll call them out like I always do when they fuck up. I believe YOU are the one with the agenda, here....Hypocrite much???
---

Man, people would LINE UP to talk to that NPC. It'd be like the start of the purveyor all over again!
---
Move to a socialist country then fucknuts, won't be whining about capitalism for long I bet.
---
You laugh, but that's kinda what I am. I spent the first few months of the game hunting every food recipe I could. I snagged so many that when they invented the "Learn recipe' quest, there weren't enough left in the game for me to complete it.
---
I really love the cooking system and wish that they'd upgrade it at some point.
---
Past that, I've doubled into high Int (15) and high Cha (12) with low combat stats left over. I'm a helper who doesn't team. D'oh.
---
It’s 4 - I’ll keep trying.
---
Depends on where he bought it, MS or Sony will ban you for doing a chargeback, not sure about steam though.
---
I want different battle types instead of battle royal. A full 30 player server in team deathmatch for example (odd coincidence that 4 players is max as is the same as a team in Adventure mode), deathmatch, capture the flag, king of the hill, ghoul hoards that increase every level, boss hoards. I mean something come on.
---
Again, doesn't mention he has anything to do with datamining. Just linking posts that has nothing to do with the subject doesn't magically turn your claims to be true
---
Do you know...where to farm all the things?
---
Nuke codes are from specific enemies that spawn when you get 8 different codes for 1 of the 3 nuke silos allows you to launch a nuke. This resets each week and you have to decode the codes at the enclave base or skip the proses and use a site that just gets the weekly code.
---
Steam does not have the game, and you can persue legal action against the company that band you for that!
---
He wasn't shut down by them. Hes giving up on the company. I don't think they realize how much this will hurt them.
---
One is having trouble believing you don't want to snap up this offer... Otherwise why are you here?
---
Ill be your family member, dextrouspick539
---
How about the camp water purifier and farm glitch? Don't remember the specifics, but you could wake up one day with your camp budget maxed out only to find out somehow water purifiers and ESPECIALLY corn had duplicated in your camp placement budget, but you couldn't even delete it. . . Mother of God, so much corn.
---
Yes i know but there in the enclave you can get a list whos alive and dead,where they are located is what im looking for.
---
The people who were banned were banned for reporting a major bug. That is literally what Aten_Ra does, as does esksera dude, who is close with aten_ra and was banned.
---
If you notice, by your own admission ecksera also isn't listed as a dataminer, just a bug reporter, and he is one of the ones banned.
---
Are you on pc? I’ve seen a whitesprings station camp with PA frames on furniture.  They had it set up like a display.  But it was just the frames left. No pieces
---
Family member?
---
Sounds kinda desperate.
---
Did aten\_ra guy get banned as well?
---
Sorry it only for rp purpose in the game
---
u/valseek and/or u/ladydevann should comment on this, but I bet they wont.
---
He hasn't said one way or the other, from what it sounds like, yes. Most are just trying to give bethesda time to fix it, but ecksera got tired of waiting for a response after being banned for 12 days with no response at all. same with Trekkie.
---
And there is almost no cons to it. 
---
ammo is weightless, 250 round mag. No spin up, high damage with the right legendary and/or perk set. You can drop a SB in the air quickly and easily. 
---
I guess maybe the cons would be you need PA to use Stabalized and you have to use 3 points in Bear Arms because they're heavy.
---
So hes salty as fk because he thinks he deserves to be treated like a beth employee. Mining and making guides is a thankless job. He has no proof thats why he was banned just an assumption. Than says he read about an exploit, did it and claims discovery...well which is it?? You dont get to do whatever you want under the guise of helping because youve become delusional and entitled.
---
I noticed low level enemies spawning the one time I was on my bros private server, is this normal?
---
Another assumption. I just checked his post history and he does not mention about him getting banned. Your logic is based off of assumption and when I ask for facts and proofs, you won't give any of that. Why the fuck do I have to care about anything you are saying?
---
Wireless, particularly using USB devices is going to be challenging. Whenever someone fired up the kitchen microwave you're going notice it when online. 💣
---
If you haven’t done this quest before, just need to interact with the robot wandering in/near the house to trigger the quest the first time.
---
Yeah that sucks.  I have an Scrolls (another Bethesda game) character that I better not lose.  I haven't played that at all since FO76 came out. Maybe I should check that. Plus I am on a break from FO76. If that happens to me I am done with BTHSD.
---
Who's history? ecsksera? You are right he didn't post about it until yesterday after giving them 12 days to right the issue, and they didn't. So he finally went public. But if you read the info it was the discord members who were all banned. Which includes Aten_ra, why not ask him yourself? 
---
Here I'll do it for you. Hey /u/Aten_Ra were you hit in the bug report screw up that hit the other dataminers and bug reporters?
---
It's in their ToS, so you can't pursue legal action. Plenty of people have had they're whole account with thousands of dollars of games taken away for doing a chargeback when they were refused a refund.
---
i use melee-rifleman build and melee hitboxes are broken af atm, wasnt that broken few months ago, hearing the sound of hitting, still not registering it.
---
He should downscale updates and improvements but continue for the fallout franchise and the community...in his free time or whenever he feels like to
---
Nice to see they just stabbed them selves and just waited to bleed all
---
If you are farming Serums they are worth 480 - 500 caps at Bot vendods albeit you can only sell 3 a day.
---
Also, here is Aten_ra himself confirming they banned people reporting bugs that have been known bug reporters in the past:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dso0c0/hey_bethesda_could_we_please_be_blessed_with_any/f6ri9mm/?context=3
---
I feel my man. I put together a whole weightless cav set thinking "If I'm standing still you won't see me, and when I'm running away you'll do less damage" but there's just something missing from the weightless mutation. I can only see it as a nice addition to a berserkers build who wears no armor at all. But no one does that.
---
Oh so you had no idea about him after all and claimed he was banned. Classic
---
No for ballistic fibre apparently...
---
Tell me more! What enemy drops it! I DEMAND TO KNOW
---
I didn't uninstall. No point to reinstall and re-download the game and patches later. But I log in, do my dailies, get my atoms, and restock my vendors. Then I log off. 
---
Nothing else to do ATM.
---
I mean, what are the chances someone was trying to log into their account, but logged into someone else's? I mean, that isn't possible right...
---
/sc
---
You may keep it.  
---
But please note: This month, Bethesda was hoping to have gold-plated toilet seats installed in their office... but thanks to people cancelling their subscription, they must now wait a few additional months before they can afford it. Oh, the humanity! And if this trend keep going the way it is, the staff will never know what it is like to poop with dignity. All because people have cut their subscriptions short.  
---
That is the folly of man.  
---
We must learn to think of these horrible outcomes before we act selfishly or else... I fear... AAA game developers will be forever doomed to a life of only semi-luxury.
---
I'm going by the fact he is part of the discord that lost a ton of bug reporters to the ban for reporting the bug.
---
Yeah but did they ban him?
---
Excellent reference!
---
Hey I’m Bethesda!  We leaked your user data, oops! Someone may have cheated on your account. So we’re going to ban you indefinitely. :)
---
Be careful folks, they banning people for not playing their games, the big irony on the hips.
---
Mine's a 4690k and works very smoothly. Granted, it's overclocked to 4.7 GHz. All of my gear is now outdated, but my game has never crashed to desktop. I've been booted off a server, but I get 120 fps at 2k anywhere outside the Whitespring (when  it's busy) or a nuke zone.
---
That, is a shame. Dude obviously put a put of time into the game.
---
Still, replicating an exploit before reporting it wasn't the best choice.
---
Nobody cares that you uninstalled the game.
---
Not to diminish all the guy has done, but seems like a knee jerk outrage reaction.
---
Also, when someone says this is the "gist" of the response i get highly suspicious. Why not post the full response and let us decide how outrageous it is, rather than tailoring it to your spin.
---
Will have to wait and see what he says himself. Either way he will vouch for those that were banned from his discord. That I'm sure of, seeing as ecksera has told me he would, and I do know they are friends.
---
Yeah but did one of the biggest bug reporters got banned yes or no? If some of the lesser reporters got banned for reporting bugs, Aten\_ra guy surely would have gotten banned right?
---
I do my CPU stress testing with Rocket League. I've never looked into WHY it works, but it seems to crash if I overdo my CPU overclock or don't have enough power for it.
---
Still playing casually. The game gave me over 1k hours of fun.
---
No other game comes close.
---
Also, I just got 1st, so enjoying that.
---
he does a lot more than you think. he wasnt the only one of us to recieve a suspension. multiple people who are part of a group of players who find and report bugs and exploits directly to the bethesda cms were suspended pending investigation recently. After 13 days i was finally unsuspended but others are still having issues including him. you should really get your facts straight before you start acting like you know anything about what is going on
---
I just asked him, we will see.
---
A lot of data miners have been banned in recent weeks, not just him. Probably because Bethesda wants to crackdown on future leaks regarding more terrible updates to FO1st, since that is how the leaking began in the first place.  
---
It sucks that they are just disregarding people who actively make the game better though
---
After reading the comments below there have been some pretty good ideas and interesting points made. However I've got to say that this would never work from a programming aspect for Bethesda. They can't even get us an option to change the color of our targeting reticle. The amount of hours of programming that would be invested to even create something like this would be far beyond what they are willing to do. I mean he'll how many patches did it take to try and fix the machine gun noise on the sentry bots and white spring? Just saying.
---
Well it is a really cool idea there is no hope that this will ever take traction.
---
This.
---
In a private server, they are your legendaries to farm.
---
On normal servers, people pretty much insta gib them.
---
I am surprised you are only seeing double the amount.
---
Again, you had no proof from the start and NOW you are doing the fact checking. Shame on you
---
This sort of stuff blows my mind.  People like this person are ***exactly*** the type of fans you want. 
---
By dropping the ball in such a spectacular way, not only did they piss off this person, they've also alienated those of us that look up and admire people with this level of talent and dedication.  Treating your loyal fans (AKA customers) like this is completely unacceptable.
---
I haven't played in a while, but I've been holding out for wastelanders.  Although posts like this really make me less excited for it.
---
I uninstalled to make room on my hard drive for Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order. Hopefully I won't regret it.
---
Remember that terrible light bulb in the Watoga High School bathroom?
---
I did do it, you just don't want to admit it. You may not trust the ecksera guy, but aten_ra does, and in turn so do I. Just because you don't trust him doesn't make the info untrue.
---
You sound like a trump supporter whining about whitstleblowers. LOL
---
I play on an out-of-date Intel and don't have any problems at all. Have you been overclocking it?
---
No you say for yourself. You are a shame for claiming something out of no grounds. That's a manipulative behavior and must be stopped
---
Sad.
---
I liked Map76 and the way they treated him for exposing and reporting bugs is ridiculous.
---
Now lets see them backpedal and apologize like they did with the riot paint.
---
Dm'd you
---
I don't know nothing about him. Never heard of her and I don't know if I should trust him or not. Aten re seems like a nice guy maybe I trust him. But you I can't trust
---
ROFL, I said what? Go back and read what I said, "He hasn't said one way or the other, but from what I gatyher, yes." At no time in any of that did I claim for a fact he was banned, just that from what has been said there is a very high likelyhood as it was the group from his discord reporting bugs, which he is known to do.
---
Also, what do you consider "banned" Since he has over a half dozen accounts, is he banned if one is banned, or does it have to be all of them?
---
I never go off 1 side of a story though most people do to fit their bias. I appreciate his contribution this is a typical fk bethesda rant with alot of entitlement due to his time commitment. With him now saying they dont care about 76 because he got bit. Most of us knew a long time ago they didnt care. Thats why everyone hated on 1st.
---
Aten_ra already vouched for him, that is the point, if you trust him you should trust eckserah as well.
---
Fellow Vault Dwellers really are the best
---
You did say people were banned for bug reporting. Did aten ra report bugs or not? Is he banned or not?
---
and why isnt FO76?
---
If they'd test their games properly, there would be nothing to exploit. It's bad design, not exploiting.
---
This is absurd. It's really stupid, but at the same time it's not uncommon.
---
Know a few people who accidentally bought something in the blizzard store, charged back and apologized, and instead of removing the digital item from the account?
---
They ban people with like 10 years of game times. 
---
It's unbelievably shitty but companies do not fuck around when it comes to their nickels and dimes.
---
They were banned for reporting this one specific bug, I do not know if aten_ra was involved in that single bug report or not.
---
No I don't trust him. Why should I? Whether I trust him or not is something I should decide. Why would you want someone else to do your decision for you? What a mentality
---
They said if you bought it on bethnet, you'll have to buy it on steam.
---
Front line customer service reps are just trying to do their job.
---
How many extra sets of armor can be stored by someone with all the extra free loot space added to their inventory?
---
If thats the case then due to the base games lack of content this game shouldnt have existed
---
ESO plus for a full year  is 11.67 a month.
---
Oh so you are moving goal posts now? Yeah too late for that. Gtfo
---
Poor game design doesn't excuse poor behavior.
---
Seems kind of silly to uninstall if you plan on coming back... even sillier to announce it.
---
And how dark Watoga Station was right in front of the restrooms? Creepy.
---
Have you ever played  a game for 2,000 hours and not gotten bored of it?
---
It's his solely developed as well as personally paid for website. Dont be greedy, this man had his account banned.
---
Hah!  I never thought of putting them back painted, great idea!  It's too bad the atom store paints can't be traded.
---
This is what I'm doing (and leveling again to respec).
---
Because OP's full of shit and we all know it. This ain't exactly the first time someone's been "falsely banned," y'know. And OP's attitude towards customer support isn't helping their case.
---
That wouldn't send a message whatsoever though
---
So you say you trust aten_ra but you don't trust his word on others? Interesting, you must have some extreme paranoia if you act like that.
---
Do you not trust what trusted people tell you? If your buddy you trust says, "hey my friend here is a great person" do you automatically assume that isn't true?
---
Man what a sad life you must have if you think every single person even those who have been vouched for by trusted people are untrustworthy.
---
Emil left that position, furthermore he worked with the Maryland studio, not Austin.

This is a different event than tea time?  I don't recall ever seeing this.  I will have to check it out.
---
Sorry, I'm on PS4.  It must be a subconsious brain-think thing kicking in.  But I do like the idea of random forests of PA frames appearing in locations.  Maybe even by some gnomes who are coordinating the effort.
---
Welp... glad you finally see the light.  Cant say you were not warned over and over and over and over again.
---
You are an ass. Easily accusing anyone about cheating with no proof 😒
---
...dude, seriously?
---
Did you *really* just say that?
---
I clearly said 'maybe' I trust him. Learn to read. No reason to trust a total stranger I know from internet
---
Not moving them all, go back and reread my first comment mentioning it. I clearly state it was for reporting the bug that was causing the account security breach. The one they patched on Saturday. Literally said that in my first comment about it. 
---
Maybe get some better reading comprehension or better memory before making completely wrong accusations. LOL
---
It's $17/month in Canada which is $4 more a month than a Playstation Now subscription
---
THis is stupid. If you want to boycott the game, boycott the game and company, not the people who support them.
---
Wow, are you barking up the wrong tree.
---
https://map76.com/
---
Well, the important thing is Bethesda trusted him and even trusted him enough to not break an NDA. Says more than anything you could. LOL
---
I'll teach you to fish rather then give you a fish.

Yes agree bud they are not worth while as operate just too slowly. Needs to be looked at and addressed
---
Yo, I'm doing this from now on.
---
Giving first players better storage options directly impacts game balance.
---
Yep.
---
I have a low level alt. Around 70 ish? But no point in playing him till we get an AA system that they promised us months ago.
---
Well yeah and not you are saying they were banned for reporting 'one specific bug'. Oh, okay. So you are not moving the goalpost but you are making them smaller. Very small
---
The terminal will give you a quest one by one that tells you where each code is
---
Yes. Based on the other responses, I would categorize this as a repeatable quest (not exactly a daily but can be done multiple times).
---
That's fantastic!
---
Armor Plating. 
---
Its far more  likely to find ballistic damage than it is energy or radiation.
---
Most things use bullet guns.  Energy resist will only come into play when you are fighting Protectrons, Some Mr Handys, and Some super mutants.  Even then, you are still more likely to find bullets coming at you than lasers or plasma.
---
What does Bethesda trusting him have anything to do with me? Trump supporters trusting Trump have nothing to do with me. Srsly wtf? I really don't get your logic
---
ROFL, so that is all you've got now? "Well I was wrong about you moving the goalposts, but your comment is about a very specific thing!".
---
Yeah no shit, that is how a well formed argument works, something you obviously know nothing about.
---
"We are currently investigating this issue. Whatever it is."
---
You think fallout is going to be any better/different ?
---
Exploiting is done within the confines of the game mechanics. Hacking is poor behaviour, exploiting is just normal human behaviour.
---
Ive seen this before, but other than picking up world spawns, there is no enemies who have it drop, besides those two rare ones.
---
Or maybe you were that Dude at launch and then Everything stated happening, With all the nerf and complaints ... I mean there is Fallout 1st 😅
---
&gt;I finally got a response, on this. The gist of it, I spent some of the atoms, so I can go fuck myself.
---
what did he expect? he used the atoms he isn't entitle to a refund
---
Well nobody gets banned without a reason Sherlock
---
No you are not informed at all. You claimed bug reporters got banned and you have no idea if aten ra got banned or not
---
Because the cannon sucks
---
ROFL, 5 comments later and then you bring up the trump comment. God you are horrible at these arguments. Like a typical trump supporter.
---
You argue like a trump supporter, ignoring reality and claiming "fake news" about anything they disagree with, or claiming "oh if they talk about trump and don't lie for him they are against him.".
---
I don't farm via enemies alone, I spend time farming world drops. I think I have 63 sitting in my stash as of last night. Most from world drops.
---
Poor behavior like leading the community charge to fix bugs or poor behavior like making community tools that were widely used and appreciated?
---
Thanks for the awesome theory. No thanks for giving me a reason to fear the gnomes now.
---
Fallout 76 has the same decisions  as Elder Scrolls Online. And according to every website on the internet, ESO is one of the best MMOs ever made, despite launching as a buggy mess with little content and poor endgame progression.   
---
\&gt; It took The Elder Scrolls Online over a year to finally find  its legs, but now that it has it's quickly become one of the best MMOs  on the market.  
---

---
I heard outer world's was gonna take the place of fallout anyways, so basically good riddance. The free market at work, folks!
---
Back when people got upset that private worlds were under the subscription, I was like "Yes, they are gonna be, that's just how this goes."
---
Still doesn't explain why I have to follow through a total stranger's decision
---
i think you can use a disease cure to remove the weeping angles disease...
---
 lol j/k
---
well thanks for this new nightmare ill be having of weeping gnomes!  i may never shut my eyes again...
---
As if Bethesda cares for its cunsumers anymore...
---
QE Harooon is hands down the best weapon in game.
---
This is Beth we are talking about. Specially when op says he hasn't played In a long time. I'd rather think innocent until proven guilty. How about his account being hacked, for example? Seems to be lots of noise about it lately
---
So is lying and stealing. Justify those, too, while you're on your high horse.
---
Maybe if you are a criminal...
---
exactly. and that is just the start. 
---
there will be legendary weapons and armors in the atomic shop by years end. 
---
quote me on that.
---
There'll likely be atom shop sales, like there was for Skyrim's B-day and Fallout 4's b-Day, which both had creation club sales.
---
You ignore any evidence that goes against your view even when it has corroborating evidence, just like trump supporters are doing with the testimony about him pressuring ukraine.
---
You are acting just like one of them. LOL
---
Fallout new hubris
---
I dunno if they're sad or not but they certainly are obtuse.
---
Yeah they just don't *have anything* for us. Unless they do a surprise release of Wastelanders, FO76 is going to be really dry. Given what's happened in the last month that's really not good for the game.
---
Wastelanders will make or break this game. If it's a success there is so much more they can do. If it's a bust, they're going to have to rebuild this game ite abandon it.
---
They don't know how to fix it.
---
...that's not what balance changes mean. *At all.*
---
Balance changes are **PATCHES,** not goddamn content. You saying "they're locking balance changes behind a paywall" means you're saying they're locking *patches* behind Fo1st.

 It doesn't goddamn matter if a Scrapbox is incredibly useful and frees up your stash space. That's not a balance change, and I don't think it's exactly game-breaking that Joe has enough space to put another full set of Unyielding armor in his stash or another Handmade that he'll never use away in the box
---
He posted this on here already.
---
Your evidence is not worth anything. Why would you think anything you provided has some power to change someone's mind? It's shie and conflict with your own claims. That's true narcissism right there
---
They're targeting the leaders within our community now
---
I use shotguns exclusively. I absolutely believe this is happening, I'm simply unable to duplicate it. I prefer VATS crit, but I do have two Quad Explosives that see frequent use. I don't use any TS.
---
They're a bunch of assholes trying to create a class war just because youtubers took the rumors of one and blew it up.
---
I don't think YOU understand what balance means. Better options for storage directly changes the way the game is played. It effects the meta, it effects pvp, it effects pve, it effects how people approach end game content.
---
Executioners swing speed deathclaw gauntlet (90% sure I remember the 3rd effect being strength too!😎). I will* be transferring my exec. swing speed walking cane to my old man melee. And looking for similar golf clubs as well as vampires swing speed canes &amp; golf clubs.
---
I don't have fo1. But i am seeing more steady flow of legendary's in events like scorched earth and census violence.
---
I feel like I've noticed this with my hunting rifle too. (Yes, I'm low level and using that POS haha) I'll be chipping away at an enemy forever, then their health just springs back up. I use shotguns as well, and have definitely noticed it there, too. In general, I feel like enemies take forever to kill because their health is often regenerating.
---
Jesus christ, fuck this. I can't argue with you anymore with this kind of shit logic.
---
\&gt; I submitted a **tickler** 
---
There in lies your problem lol
---
You're a complete troll.
---
That's how digital goods typically work.
---
I prefer to leave the suppressor off, that range drop-off is a beast. I do have a shotgun with a suppressor for melee-range kills, though. Comedy gold.
---
i9-9900k with a 2080ti. It does pretty much cap both of those out if I run both at 2K and ultra settings though, and I kept crashing when I only had 16GB of RAM - wasn't enough. With 32 GB though I have no issues. I even stream 1080p using Faster CPU encoding and pull a consistent 60 FPS. Hard to play at 60 FPS when you're used to 120 though.
---
Lying is fine, it's up to you to figure out your truth. It's normal. Stealing however, leads to jail time. There are no loopholes that legalize it. Scamming still has tons of loopholes. Take Bethesda as an example of both. They lied to their customers (still do), they're also scamming people. Nothing can touch them because it's all legal. At least until US congress does something about it (at least I think Bethesda is US-based).
---
Good on you bro
---
You have no idea what specs I am running or how my PC is interfacing with the game, yet you're completely comfortable claiming the fault is on my end right out of the gate. 
---
I have better than a 'decent' computer, and no other game I've played recently has given me issues like 76 has. Lots of people who have great computers have also posted about issues with this game performance, not just bugs.
---
"You didn't know any better" is such an arrogant comment to drop, too.  I'm gonna go ahead and put you on block for being such a douche that you firmly believe the problem is on my end when, again, you have zero information to base that on but a series of assumptions and stats about your own experience. 
---
Nice 'methodology'!
---
You think I'm trying to change your mind? I'm here just to make you look like the tool you are for everyone else. There is a reason why you are always downvoted to the point you comments are collapsed and unseen 90% of the time. LOL
---
You're right, it's entirely Bethesda's fault for people using every exploit, hack, dupe, and cheat.
---
The person creating the content shouldn't have been penalized for reporting an exploit, and should be commended for the work they've put into map76, and the bug reports.
---
Using the exploit they were reporting was a mistake, while I don't think they should have been suspended for it, they also shoudln't have done it. The ideas aren't mutually exclusive unless you already have some hate boner for Bethesda.
---
So bethesda wont test the game themselves, and punishes anyone who reports the glitches.... they just want it to stay buggy as hell I guess
---
TBF doing a chargeback when you actually bought an item willingly is basically fraud most companies will (and rightly so) ban hammer your arse into the next decade for doing it.
---
If you want a refund ask customer support getting your bank to rip the money back normally means telling them it was fraudulent in the first place. 
---
Getting buyer's remorse is not good enough of a reason to do stuff like that.
---
Blizzard are still jack-boot licking scum though.
---
The idea of taking players' photos is really cool.  The scale of it might be unweildy, however, unless there could be a community system even like reddit does, to bubble good ones to the top.
---
That way it could be cool to even have character pics, but the ones that'd be really interesting are the ones more photogenic, rather than campy (at least imho).  Sometimes campy can be fun, however... I have a photobomb from a super mutant.  I often snap pics of my character carrying weapons, just to get a look at it.  One time I was doing this during a "wear formal" challenge, my female char was in a red dress, carrying a broadsider, and I didn't hear but a super mutant was charging up from behind about ready to pound the char.
---
You know, we could just make a Reddit that is only for pics &amp; videos from the game, just to show this sort of thing out of game.
---
I've found that swing speed weapons combined with martial artist gives me the best results, especially with an already quick one hander like a combat knife or dagger. That was I can land several hits without the slow recovery of the two handers.
---
You're done it again. Beautiful.
---
They frequent a lot of places, reddit is one of them.  
---
They have a twitter, a twitch, their own official forums, facebook, their support twitter, and this subreddit.
---
Bull fucking shit.
---
Sorry that happened to you. 
---
As for the Fallout 1st issue, any game subscriptions I have, I put on my credit card. One of these reasons, is I can cancel the payment as I see fit...within reason: i don't just get a sub, use it and cancel the day before next payment is due. 
---
Also had a car rental company try to continue charging me for tolls that I didn't use. Canceled the transaction, listed why, boom, they took it off my card.
---
If I were to buy 1st I would have put it on my card, and when Beth says no to my cancellation, I cancel the subscription  when the next payment comes in.
---
Also kinda crappy that you tried to help them fix a problem and they repay you by banning you. I know they stopped caring about players months ago...just sad to see they still don't care that people are trying to enjoy something but they keep screwing it up.
---
So yes, your opnion, not the opinion of the majority of the human race.
---
THat's dumb af. Every company besides retail gives holidays off as that's the right thing to do, and it's also the law.
---
If that is so, how am I sitting on much more karma than you are? You've been on Reddit for like what, 6 years now? Can't imagine all the downvotes you got lol. What a tool haha
---
Except that most people aren't either of those things, and people need breaks. We shouldn't take away people's chance to not work because you want a good DLC.
---
I dont value the majority of the human races opinion on a game. I value my opinion of it. I dont care what others like or dislike. It's about what I like or dislike that dictates what I spend money and value.
---
I went from being an avid, daily FO76 player for months, to only playing NW, to not playing at all. Now I only belong to this sub so I can keep track of how badly Bethesda keeps screwing up, and to wonder why anybody continues to spend time or money on this trash heap of a game. I have been playing Bethesda games since Morrowind and am now dreading the new TES and Starfield games based on how dreadfully Fallout 76 has gone. It's one thing to release a half-finished and bug-ridden game, it's another to refuse to fix that game despite having over a year to do so, it's entirely another to keep introducing MORE bugs and problems into the game, and it's an infuriatingly different problem to continue breaking promises and milking customers for more money despite all this. On top of all that, NW is completely unplayable due to Bethesda's refusal to police cheaters. FO76 still isn't the worst game I've ever played, far from it. But it's the biggest fiasco and most disappointing game I've ever played, especially due to its potential.
---
I don't think a single game has ever damaged a studio's reputation quite like this one. An unmitigated disaster. Looking back, I'm almost mad at myself for everything I forgave, thinking it would get better. Somehow, things have gotten *worse*.
---
It can be an honest mistake. And in one of said instances, the charge back was for a 60$ "service" his kid bought accidentally, whom he ticketed them for, was denied, and then charged back.
---
It was the dumb level up boost they sell, and hes s single dad with a kid. Like 20 years old
---
I do not know about the details of these bans, but did the banned people use Cheat Engine, or any other third party tool, or debugger, or DLL that allows for access to the memory space of the Fallout76.exe process while it is running? That kind of software is not allowed by the TOS, although it is unfortunate that non-cheaters got banned by the anti-cheat system, and hopefully they can get their accounts back.
---
It would be different on the other hand if anyone was banned for merely having data mining tools installed, and not actually using them while the game was running.
---
Pure is stable.
---
Bethesda has finally responded:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xy_H5uK8vk&amp;lc=z23lylvxvsbasb3qr04t1aokggcpybqhhdkjkjfv0wtqbk0h00410
---
Same here, even got disconnected during a game of NW
---
They released Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter for free. Hell, NW was a beta that just happened to get huge amounts of support and got to stick around as the full deal earlier then was actually announced, all for free. Bethesda will definently release wastelanders for free.
---
Combined at the chem station if I remember correctly
---
Truth is subjective, if a colorblind person sees a "red" ball but says it is green because that is what he see's is he lying?
---
See but I don’t just want 63...
---
I want to break into the thousands as I have for almost every other material. Picking up bags takes too darn long
---
I can't cheat. It's impossible to cheat since I uninstalled this game when I realized they'd go in full scammer mode. [Educate yourself on game scams here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNjI03CGkb4)
---
Only explosive kind of sucks
---
I think it's fair to say that this game does not perform consistently from user to user, which is part of the problem. I remember when the media reviews were hitting last year, and many of them were talking about various bug and performance problems, while my game was actually running pretty smooth. And I can guarantee you that the average reviewer is running a pretty badass rig. 
---
As I mentioned in the review I had a worse experience with private worlds this week than I had playing Adventure mode in the months after launch. 
---
And as I just mentioned to some other douchenozzle, I've got a got a setup that runs other games quite well, and even handles FO4's Downtown Boston in large gunfights with little lag. FO76 is just a game plagued with problems and instability as far as I've seen. Often those problems haven't been bad for me, but my 20 hours with private worlds were definitely not stable or fun. :/
---
dude spends his time helping them find exploits, bugs, gives the community a tool to help them play the game and enjoy it more, even is insane enough to be a fallout 1st subscriber and he gets this. It took you awhile buddy but i think you finally learned your lesson in having self respect.
---
Don't get me wrong, of course you are entitled to your holiday, but if you cannot finish your work after the holiday, there will be consequences.
---
In the words of my IT bud,"Did you try turning it off and back on?"
---
Hope that helps.
---
That's not even a good non-answer. Hacking isn't "illegal" either, and apparently is just human nature also, or people wouldn't do it. Nice to know you're advocating on the side of liars and hackers.
---
Because if you look I only started using this account less than 6 months ago, I made it as a throwaway years ago to troll trump supporters. 
---
Also, here is proof you are wrong and bethesda fucked up banning them:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dthe7w/map76_officially_closed_creator_gives_explanation/f6wncx7/
---
I'll also start by never checking this subreddit again. Thanks for the advice.
---
And yet you're mad that people have their tents happenstance in places where your camp is and will be?
---
Exactly, and being a asshole to them isn't gonna make things better. It just gives people (including me) more of a reason to not believe you
---
They actually used to work faster pulled scrap but they changed that a while ago.
---
I actually don't get crashes at all these days. Not a single crash in the 20 hours with private worlds. Which I'm thankful for because crashes are generally more frustrating. xD
---
People stopped playing it.  It was depricated.
---
No more survival, it may come back later.
---
What a shame.
---
Really is a shame that map76 was shut down, used to use this a lot to exactly pinpoint location of items and ore crops.
---
Oh well, back to writing notes and map locations down I suppose.
---
Shame about the guy having all this bs on his head though, swear it was posted a few days ago already though
---
Easiest way to do that is to find a spot with a good concentration of Snallys and server hop. It will take time though. I tend to do this with ticks, for stimpak crafting.
---
I don’t see how this should be praised
---
Any terms of service that blocks a lawsuit is not legally binding, they're shooting themselves on the foot by implementing such a clause as it invalidates their entire TOS!
---
Snallys drop BF?
---
Bethesda doesn't run the servers though, AWS does. And they have said that they'll change private worlds with feedback as feedback comes in.
---
JuiceHead made a video of this. It was not a dupe or a cheat, it was account related. Also banning an account for confirming was silly, how they were supposed to know the exploit would work?
---
I was playing Destiny 2 last week and it was perfectly smooth. I was playing Classic WoW a few weeks ago and that was perfectly smooth as well (though I didn't expect a lot of lag in that game in the first place).
---
Oh? Please tell
---
You can find quite a bit of Cobalt flux around the Whitesprings.  They are blue plants, and blue blobs stuck to the base of some trees.   Start around the Railway Station and move south along the tracks and you'll scoop some.
---
Haha a troll account? Wow you really are a tool aren't you?And you sound so proud about it
---
Not lying, but just as in this case, they are still wrong.
---
It's OWS (Open-world Survival game) And a lot of fallout games have looting mechanics in them.
---
So you admit it’s pay to win, no thanks. I think I’ll just keep crying. Fuck Bethesda.
---
thanks, good to know your still enjoying it as it is...
---
How is that not content?
---
My video card is better than yours and yes the game is installed on a samsung SSD.
---
I have no reason to believe this is a problem with my rig, if I had issues with other similar games I would have included that in my review.
---
Making room for other current games isn’t silly.
---
Yes this account was made to troll "the_donald" and I didn't want to have my main account tarnished with that subreddit. Likewise I don't use my main account in regards to gaming subreddits because they are all cesspools.
---
Love how you ignore the part where you are now 100% proven wrong since eckserah just got unbanned a couple hours ago. LMAO
---
Actually they don't blame me for being out of coffee. It's Mothmen and Sqatches.
---
My bad.
---
Or work when possible and not rush the product out as the product quality is more important, just because they are working on it, doesn't mean that they get to be treated as slaves and lose their holiday due to the Entitled Gamers fanbase.
---
Hacking, not the CNN version, goes beyond the confines of the game design. Hacking is the unauthorized modification of a piece of software (that's what a game is really, software) and it is in fact illegal. Some people are rotting in jail over that right now. 
---
They also could not possibly have tested it nor guarded against it, so it is done by no fault of their own. There is no "entrapment" of sorts here.
---
Camps not taking damage was supposed to be fixed and workshops only open pvp when you're in them. Not so sure how it is if you're in a team and one of your teammates is at a workshop, claimed or not, but I'd figure it's the same as if someone in your team gets into pvp with someone elsewhere on the map that isn't workshop territory.
---
Damn fr? Im sorry bro, im not to knowlagable about armor trades (i only really trade weapons) i figured it woukd be worth it
---
Love it! I keep deleting a lot of my pics to make more room, but I will always save a similar Photomode shot I took. Admiring my new Enclave officer uniform, only saw the feral behind my toon as I clicked. I'm standing there, hands on hips looking all cool, about to get munched on. It's great.
---
Oh look another exploiter banned.  Booohoo  Cheat elsewhere.
---
Never heard or map76. what was it?
---
&gt; You have no idea what specs I am running or how my PC is interfacing with the game, yet you're completely comfortable claiming the fault is on my end right out of the gate. 
---
I do know how your PC interfaces with the game server. I'm aware of how client-server relationships work. I also know that BGS rents cloud computing from Amazon (AWS), and while I'm not advocating for them (in truth I think their cloud computing servers are kinda of garbage, given that I've played 3 different games on them that all suffered horrible latency (note - latency, as in bad ping / lag, not FPS loss) with too many clients connected - those games were Rend, Atlas, and Fallout 76). I'm far from an expert, but I do work in IT, and I know enough about how games work to know that your FPS issues are the same ones that are present in Fallout 4 and Fallout 3. Big cities with lots of NPCs and textures are very taxing on your PC. If you don't believe me, open up Task Manager and watch your CPU / GPU / RAM usage in big cities. If you're hitting 100% consistently, you're going to have issues.
---
&gt; I have better than a 'decent' computer, and no other game I've played recently has given me issues like 76 has. Lots of people who have great computers have also posted about issues with this game performance, not just bugs. 
---
This game does have poor performance, but you're blaming it on private servers. You made an assumption that private servers would suddenly fix the poor optimization and low performance that Bethesda games are known for in big cities in games like FO3, FO4, and now FO76. As you've noticed, private servers have nothing to do with FPS performance, since you get poor performance regardless of private vs. public servers. Private servers MAY help with performance in that you don't have to load other player's enormous camps, but only when you are in the area that would have had that enormous camp. 
---
For reference, Doom on max settings looks a hell of a lot nicer than Fallout 76, but I can get 400+ FPS there. I doubt I could break 160 on Fallout 76 (not that it lets you anyway). The engine used by Fallout is generally very poor at optimizing. This is the performance issue you're seeing. I don't doubt that you have poor performance and an OK computer, however, you are blaming private servers, which is incorrect.
---
&gt; "You didn't know any better" is such an arrogant comment to drop, too. I'm gonna go ahead and put you on block for being such a douche that you firmly believe the problem is on my end when, again, you have zero information to base that on but a series of assumptions and stats about your own experience. 
---
I say something that you didn't want to hear and argued with facts and logic, which you can't refute, so you put me on block. OK Boomer. Go back to your safe space then.
---
Who is wrong? The person telling the colorblind person the ball is red? Or the colorblind person saying the ball is green? To both of those people their subjective view of the color of the ball is correct and the other one is lying.
---
That is the crux of why truth is subjective, as our whole lived experience is subjective.
---
Nahh my guy not your fault just some greedy bastards lol
---
The last thing anyone needs ever is an "I told you so" and definately not one from a stranger.
---
I don't think Bethesda should have suspended their account, that sucks. I also don't think they should have used the exploit, that sucks too. They could have just reported it, where they found it, and left it at that. The devs obviously took action based on their reporting.
---
Nahh ,y guy just some greedy bastards lol
---
This might be a dumb question, but how do you leave a set behind....like in a bag without the frame?  I thought PA got reclaimed and you had to store it or scrap it to get it out of your inventory.
---
I play 76 because I love bethesda games, and fallout games. Just waiting for wastelanders.
---
I say he keeps posting it, day in and day out.  We don't all come to this sub every day, and every FO76 player needs to read this.  Hell, I was about to crosspost it to the other Fallout sub.  Bethesda deserves for this to be shared far and wide, because it's literally the way they're treating ALL of their lifelong fans.  So, I'll allow it...and I'll keep allowing it.
---
I have a picture of mr pebbles on my wall, a hero that my cats can look up to. A true American hero.
---
I like how they don't even give you a reason. Just "pending on investigation". Garbage.
---
You do realize dupers were unbanned too right? He was banned for a reason and maybe Bethesda felt like forgiving them for once. That doesn't mean he's innocent.
---
The sales item changes every day -- usually they list it on the website which item is on sale on which day, but it doesn't look like they've done it this week.
---
Well shit
---
I mean, rushing now kinda means work when possible. If they want to uphold their reputation or their jobs, they need to work fucking hard. 
---
With little time left, if having the holiday means work is not going to be done, then they are either stupid or irresponsible, the least they can do is rush now.
---
Yeah the economy is hella inflated atm. Tbh a duping wave might help this economy out a bit
---
Wait for it to go on sale and it will be worth it. I don't recommend it at full price. Plus when Wastelanders comes out next year (basically a new game hopefully) you will be ready for it.
---
Thanks for taking the time to provide your response.  It has some incredibly good information and points for consideration. Sadly, I am not in CA but I am an active voter in the U.S. and my personal politics align with addressing the issues you raised. Again, thank you!
---
Hacking absolutely is illegal:
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act
---
Data miners who exploit the game to make money from it?  Yea not the type of fans you want.
---
They ruin the fun and enjoyment for the player base.
---
I love how every YTer was like TOW should scare bethesda.  
---
It's a 10 hour game that has fetch quests, scavenging, and good writing, but bad shooting...
---
That's a nice tin foil hat you are wearing.
---
For a dying game it's kinda surprising things are still so expensive lol
---
I guess
---
Surprisingly, it didn't work
---
Why would I get mad over a video game? It's more frustrating trying to explain something simple to redditors that have very little reading comprehension skills.
---
But wasn't TOW supposed to scare bethesda?
---
ROFL, yup trump supporter.
---
They nerfed explosive damage when they nerfed TSE's last winter.  The problem with those weapons is ammo is heavy and expensive to craft, the weapons themselves break quickly, and the dps on them is pretty poor compared to almost everything else.  
---
With all that being said I would love to see these weapons get some love.  I would enjoy having some builds outside of bloodied, junkies, and commando.
---
I think everyone needs more "i told you so's"
---
The world is filling up fast with pompous "i'm always right" pricks fast.  They need a good many does of mental shame.
---
You know a company is in trouble when even its most dedicated sycophants use arguments like "They don't have to treat you like a person, it's right there in the TOS"
---
&gt;This is Beth we are talking about
---
Yeah, the same Bethesda whose bans so far were all for legitimate reasons. 
---
Literally every single time someone has complained to here about being 'falsely banned,' it turns out they were banned for being a duper or going into the dev room or some 3rd thing while they're trying to play the victim card 
---
So it's not exactly unfair to be skeptical of OP. I for once think he's full of it since he has yet to reply to any of the comments on this thread, and it's been 10 hours
---
I have recently stoped playing till they fix the game
---
Stable is dark to me at table so it caused me to wonder
---
Dang.
---
This. If you look at your stable flux you will see that the scrap components are pure, which is indeed a bit confusing if you don't pay attention.
---
Yeah, its crazy how much shit is nowadays.
---
Funny you think I'm American
---
You say using the exploit, but how do you expect them to accurately report it if they can't replicate it?
---
It doesn't block the lawsuit, you're just guaranteed to lose because the ToS states that they reserve the right to deactivate your account and remove the leases for all purchased content. You sign and agree to that ToS when you create your account.
---
Buy an external hard drive...
---
You do know that can't really give the info a bug report needs without triggering the bug/exploit or whatever at least once as without knowing the trigger conditions replicating it is basically impossible.
---
And narrowing down the trigger may take a number of attempts at activating it if it depends on a variable outside of your immediate control  (I.E like a sever state or number of players you can't directly affect them)
---
The ban is understandable as it may have been automatic the really shitty bit is the no reply from support. 
---
Also, the fact that players feel the need to take it upon themselves to fix issues that Bethesda should have had in hand if they where competent leaves a very shitty taste in the mouth. They charge full price game + a $100 a year sub and basic bugs are still kicking around 6 months later.
---
I have a friend who would probably join you. I have stoped playing the game for the time being
---
"little time left"
---
They have all the time in the world, maybe we don't think so because so many people are quiting, but to be honest, people on this reddit saying they're quiting is a blip, small one at that.
---
Patience is a virtue, bethesda will work on wastelanders, then whatever winter event they have, then the holidays will be vacation days for employees and then they'll come back and work somemore.
---
Was expecting this whole thread to be full of BE handmades and I was pleasantly surprised. I mean I love my BE25 handmade but...
---
BE laser rifle with beam splitter and whatever capacitor is beast
---
Pros: full auto explosive laser shotgun that turns to a sniper if you scope in, lights enemies on fire, instakills in pvp, uses super common fusion cells
---
Cons: breaks quickly, will kill yourself by accident often, literally unobtainable outside of trading a kidney, does basically nothing to highly armoured targets like sbq or imposter squatch
---
To be fair, at least a few of the suggestions by the OP are similar to what is already in [ESO Plus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:ESO_Plus). In particular, increased camp budget was already announced to come eventually, at least for private worlds, and 10% buffs to XP, the rate of learning mods, and the daily vendor limit would also be in line with the other subscription, putting aside whether the idea is right or not.
---
Deathclaw Gauntlet. Feel the fear.
---
"Tested the exploit" lol come on bruh. Is that your job now? You just really cared about the game's integrity that much eh. 
---
Honestly, I think they should communicate with you and lift the ban, but I just don't buy this part.
---
don't blink
---
Funny you think you have to be american to support trump.
---
&gt; That's kind of targeting the PvP crowd. 
---
The crowd that specializes in duped gear and exploits and is rampant with cheaters?  Wow, what a tragedy that would be.
---
Cowboy Outfit with Chaps probably. Very valuable.
---
"Beth quit giving a shit" Lol, no.
---
Preach
---
Bethesda have already broken their side of the contract.
---
You’ll have this moment of “Wow, I’m playing Fallout with OTHER PEOPLE! What a time to be alive!” That’s about where it ends.
---
Do I lose my atoms after the subscription ends? I just want to buy this whenever I need atoms...
---
I got you fam!
---
Just google mmogfails. Too much stuff to list, but looks promising.
---
As far as we know, he wasn't using the exploits for personal gain, but rather to verify their existence in hopes of getting them patched. Example:  There's a big difference between someone duping a nocturnal pipe gun to prove a dupe exists so they can report it and a scumbag duping legacies to sell on eBay. One is doing a service to community, the other is destroying the economy.
---
Just wow
---
What system do you play on?  I'm on a xbox one x and I dont have too many gameplay issues. There may be lag here and there, but nothing to break the game.
---
It's a server/client communication lag issue. Try resetting your router or playing on private.

What resolution are you playing at, I had to dial back to 2k res from 4k if I wanted to play at ultra settings higher than 40FPS on a 1080
---
Thus ends a era
---
Why the fuk would I support him? He's sucking money off of other countries to make 'America great again'. Well yeah he's good at that alright more reason not to support him
---
Yeah companies do not fuck around when it comes to chargebacks.
---
I have this pop up on my HUD every. Single day.
---
If they're colorblind, how would they know what "green" is? Their opinions on ball color would already be suspect.
---
The colorblind person is the deficient observer, they can "believe" the ball is green all they want, but if 99.99% of all other people see the ball as red, then the ball is red.
---
Yeah he posted it already here few days ago.
---
The only difference i really noticed is in the room straight to the right in west tek, the locked one, ive run the place so many times i know how many and where the muties are, but i swear to god every time i run it on private its like there is a second "horde" spawning in that very room, not just one, many of em.. and no, they are not aggrod from the other side of the map, cause i find them all clearing the place, its strange, only in private.. I actually need to test it out counting ahah
---
How does the healing work? Perk or Vampire?
---
This is outrageous. I just uninstalled the game and contacted Bethesda. I’m sick of this. Stop spending money on this dying game before it’s too late.
---
Sorry that Bethesda delayed a DLC to make it good.
---
It was a limited time outfit from the atomic shop back when the game was first released
---
Comment history is a thing. -Sorrow TV
---
In that case, i can see why he did it if you went through support and it was a reasonable ask and get no traction and you need the money, you need the money.
---
Still, the company is within its rights to assume you were acting in bad faith and take whatever action they are legally able to so and feel is necessary.
---
Little time left is literally, 2020 Q1 ends in 31 March 2020.
---
Only dumb fucks would think they have a lot of time.
---
Uninstalled a few months ago after experiencing bugs with the vault raids.
---
I might come back with Wastelanders, but what I'm really hoping for is a permanent improvement in Bethesda's *processes* - I'm sick and tired of having bugs dominate my game experience and decision making. Hearing about the issues with their latest event doesn't leave me optimistic at this point.
---
This is a client/server entity location mismatch.  As a result, you'll see similar behavior from:
---
1)  Any weapon that fires multiple projectiles (client sees that x projectiles hit, server thinks y projectiles hit)
---
2)  Any weapon with an AOE component (client sees that entity was in range for the AOE, or a specific number of instances of AOE, server disagrees)
---
3)  Sneak Attacks (client thinks you are hidden based on entity position, server disagrees based on its actual position)
---
4)  Non-VATs locational damage, such as headshots (client says you shot the target in the head, server thinks you hit them somewhere else or, more likely, not at all).
---
5)  In extreme cases, all damage will be effected as the server location for the entity vs the client location can be wildly different.
---
Not 100% sure what causes this the location mismatch, but I've noticed a couple of things that help:
---
1)  Playing over a hard line connection instead of wifi seems to help.
---
2)  Playing on low-population servers helps.
---
3)  Playing on private servers with no more than one other player helps substantially.

With that being said, there's no reason why they couldn't have made a different decision about it in the interests of better customer service, but expecting a business to do more than what they are required is folly.
---
The lead extractor is a bit of a joke when you can pick up more tin cans and scrap them for more lead than it produces much faster. One trip to crevasse dam to get the 4 can chimes there and you've beat the extractor in 5 minutes.
---
Refrigerated, I'm a food build
---
They never said when they'd release it, hell it could be Q2 for all we know. That's how delays work, they'll release it when it's ready to be released.
---
Its not that he wants to cancel, you can easily do that through Bethesda.net, its he wants a refund for buying 1st.
---
They did say it, Q1, check your facts.
---
500 atoms have been deposited into your account.
---
The Mannequins in fallout 4 kinda do this too.
---
Or maybe let him do an April 1 event.
---
Can you at least put junk in it that's not scrapped?
---
Same.
---
Crap
---
Yea noticed that majority of the time no one does it either. Makes sense to keep hard events only being able to be triggered the old fashion way since it does take quite a bit of planning.
---
maybe for christmas
---
you found Todd's Bunker!
---
Here’s the best build I’ve come across while playing the game:
---
Literally play any other fallout game until 76 gets fixed
---
That game looks promising!
---
its because everything on the continent want to kill you all the time
---
Okay then.
---
Yep lol, my pvp ender. I just picked up a quad last night so im waiting to use it on the next person that bashes me while im in a vendor. 32 rounds lol, dont even need ffr, the signal repeater makes its fire rate like 90. The ffr one tho is a absolute riot, also have a exeutioners now, which does scale the radiation to the +40% for those bloodied builds. Im just tired of certain people and figured these would be a great fix....and well i was right 😅
---
&gt;Beth quit giving a shit about Fallout 76 and it's players a long time ago. It is time we all stop giving a shit about it as well. Here, I'll start.
---
I’ll start by never getting a Bethesda game ever again, for any reason, ever.
---
Me too! I was like "one more fucking time and I'm running there..." Then it worked lol
---
Yea workshops were amazing in the beginning and all of them were owned on every server but nowadays no one wants them so this would help if they got a buff.
---
Yup, trump supporter if you think he is helping america.
---
Become a 1ster, enjoy no lag for a measily 12.99...
---
Remember if you're not first..... You're last.
---
If he'd only bought atoms, I might be inclined to agree.  But the atoms (which the game itself gives away for free to begin with) were part of the subscription.  Should people who used their scrap boxes or a private server prior to requesting a refund be denied as well?
---
Yep agreed
---
I was hoping from the title it was talking about breaking point from the constant comments about quitting the game, I installing the game, boycotting the game, etc.
---
Testing exploits for the exact purpose of reporting them so that in hopes they can fix the issue... that isn't cheating.
---
Bethesda/Zenimax only care about ONE FUCKING THING, and that is looking good for investors, they're monetising everything they can, whether it works or not does not really matter, upper management is locked on course and I feel for the developers coding this stuff knowing it will go down as well as shitting on your mother in laws new designer sofa, slapping her with a kipper and demanding a cuppa.
---
I've found the "missing required ammo" most frequently afflicted Prime guns. Even after reload, and showing a full mag, it wouldn't fire until swapping back and forth.
---
No. The weight is their only downside. It's called balance. Manage your weight better.
---
Do read the notes or announcements in the future.
---
Have a sign that says, please show your junk first lol.
---
Ok? That's not comparable to a Gauss Rifle which is worse than other rifles such as the Lever Action or a Handmade when it comes to swarms.
---
yeah i see the same people alot too that arent on my friends list that is
---
Because they were already able to find accurate information about the exploit, to replicate the exploit?
---
Again, I don't think they should have been suspended, but personally, if I found out about an exploit, I would report it without replicating it.
---
Naughty raiders get the back hand of the almighty Todd
---
Have you tried NW. It's a blast if you find a group to play with.
---
Or you might think it is going to be released in 2021.
---
that'll be 7 bucks
---
But the rest of the product isn't fit for purpose, he is entitled to a refund.
---
I hate you because now I can't blink.
---
What?
---
&gt;  I burn through the lot in an hour
---
So how is it underrated when your time using it is so limited?
---
This gave me a good laugh
---
Maybe they...
---
Did?
---
What if... They have been testing the game this whole time, and the one or two glitches right now that the community gets all up in arms about are just really unlikely glitches? That weren't yet replicated by the testers?
---
What if they fixed 100 glitches and we are seeing stuff that slipped through the cracks?
---
I see glitches in The Outer Worlds that get pretty game breaking, so one or two doesn't bother me.
---
Yes. They just let you live to death.
---
You have zero proof that the Subscriptions are going to Fallout 76’s development. They just want money.
---
They are not scams.
---
All business are very keen on selling as much as possible.
---
I'm on Xbox one. It had happened before,  always with a melee attack. The game freezes, makes a hellish stutter noise and then the whole Xbox shuts off
---
Because the most common type of colorblindness people have can't tell the difference between red and green. To them the ball looks green like grass, because their eyes literally don't have the cones to absorb the red spectrum.
---
By your claims that the colorblind person is the defienct viewer, then the one who see's it as red is also deficent as the ball also lets off tons of other colors outside of that persons field of vision, just like red is outside the colorblind persons field of vision.
---
bloodied unarmed and yaogui are the devil incarnate.  tip get the anti stagger chest mod for them
---
Haha
---
Well Junkies I'd say
---
Doubt we’ll hear anything from them on this.
---
Bethesda wont admit it, but this is an issue with their cloud storage being corrupted. Facts are there. The consoles work fine with other games, and even FO76, UNTIL you connect to their server. I don't have a solution, and i have the exact same problem. Hopefully theres a patch soon.
---
me too
---
Your anger is amplified because you feel Bethesda owes your a certain degree of attention since you spend your time on their product finding bugs,etc... You don’t work for them so they owe you no more attention than the rest of us commoners. I will tell you though....if you DID work for them. Things would be better for us all.
---
Am Im Reading it correct, you were banned due data-mining? You know, that this us against every agreement in almost every game?
---
Im a developer by myself and ofcourse you can downvote me to Valhalla, but datamining and leaking was never a welcoming thing to software developers and content artists everywhere.
---
Oh Bethesda bad.. Duhhhh... Come on dude, if his account got hacked, it's his own fault. But he might knows how you gonna taste, if you crawl up further the other end.
---
If you drop PA it becomes available for anyone who can use it., it doesn't go in a bag.
---
I know that some people using cheat engine, either for Datamining, NW shenanigans, or Dev room stuff got swept a few weeks ago... Do es any of that apply to you?
---
Please do us a favor and vote for that native indian woman. Please ffs make other countries happy. Make America shit again. You deserve Hilary
---
I was more referencing the "hacking", or use of 3rd party programs and minor file modifications you see in here, than actual hacking, which I'm aware is illegal.
---
Oh geeze. I run a melee build too and,have never had that happen... Do any other games have weird issues like that or is it only fo76?
---
This happens every time with any weapon I have equipped.
---
tip for melee and flying creatures in 76.  honestly just switch to a gun for flying enemies.  melee vats was fixed but it's still a pain to Target them.
---
You're not vetted and you're not trustworthy, how you expect anything else is hilarious, as part of a dev studio we would never condone exploit hunters without explicit permission, especially since there's a high probability of those exploits being passed on to others than Bethesda.
---
vampire
---
I've posted this many times before but I will again so hopefully we get a bit of traction.
---
Workshops need to be buffed.  Right now they really are not worth the hassle to take.  Workshops need to have the extraction rate increased by at least double in my opinion.  I would also love to have existing workshops reworked to produce more valuable items.  Basically each factory would have a terminal that produces items based on your selection, similar to the way the ammo factory works. For example:
---
\-**Textile Factory**\-produces cloth, leather, or ballistic fiber.
---
\-**Nuka Cola plant**\-produces nuka products.
---
\-**Canned food factory**\-produces canned food products (dog food).
---
\-**Gun factory**\-produces finished firearms and weapons (for scrapping or sale).
---
\-**Pharmaceutical factory**\-produces medicine and chems.
---
\-**Oil refinery**\-produces oil,plastic, and acid.
---
\-**Gold/Silver mine**\-produces precious metals (these need the value increased per piece).
---
\-**Cattle ranch**\-produces meat, milk, fertilizer, bone, and leather.
---
\-**Farm**\-produces grain, vegetables, fertilizer, acid.
---
\-**Water purification plant**\-purified water and antiseptic.
---
\-**Restaurant supply**\-produces salt, pepper, sugar, syrup, coffee, honey, or other food ingredients.
---
\-**Brewery**\-produces alcoholic beverages.
---
\-**Repair shop**\-produces springs, gears, screws,glass, etc
---
\-**Mineral mine**\-produces aluminum, copper, lead, iron, titanium, nuclear material,  etc.
---
\-**Ammunition factory**\-produces all ammo types including energy/explosive/grenades. (currently needs an increase)
---
\-**Junkyard**\-produces a wide variety of all junk items just like now.
---
There are many more workshop ideas I'm sure but these are just a few of the top of my head.  I think this would be an organic way to re-introduce meaningful pvp and possibly factions into the game.  With the right buffs the workshops would be something that people would actually attempt to control.  If you were to allow people that are aligned with your faction to share in the loot it would be another incentive to team up and control the workshops.  The feed the people event at Mama Dolce's used to award everyone on the server with canned food, and I would like to see something similar set up for the workshops. The defense events for the workshops could also scale in difficulty based on the value of the workshop providing a true "horde mode".
---
I think we already have a large variety of pre-existing workshops that just need to be tweaked a bit.  Currently we have gorge junkyard, sunshine food production, various mines, nuka cola plant, etc.  Again we just need to have these changed up a bit to accomplish this.  
---
Thoughts?
---
But apart from all that it's still.pretty good yes?
---
It'll be 9.99 new during Black Friday sales.
---
I'm sure it costs some time and money to run it, and if the company who made the game backstabs you, I can totally understand wanting to invest neither.
---
Not that big of a pain if you choose your addictions well. For exemple when I really need damage, I use some psycho regardless of the addiction. When I use it while being addicted, the debuff leave until psycho stops. Addiction are really not that big of a deal.
---
I’m going for anti-armor judging from a detailed post. TS hits your accuracy down. Junkie’s brings with it a lot of negative effects to get the most out of it. Any ideas and what armor or major and minor for the 50 cal or another weapon with AA?
---
I haven't played the game in months and stuff like this keeps me away from Bethesda out of reputation alone. The reality here is that no product manager, game director, support team, or community outreach team would behave like this (and get away with it) unless it were mandated all the way down.
---
It is plain to anyone who isn't emotionally invested in this game that the little development and support fo76 gets is never going to be considered a value, no matter the price Bethesda puts on it. They are going to bleed the fan base as much as possible for as long as possible before they taper off all support.
---
IF the community is lucky, our best bet is on their way out, they give us true standalone servers, but I can think of a few (very good) reasons why they won't even do that.
---
its not your pc/hardware its becourse bethesda its useing unoptimized code i have a i7 8700 and a GTX 1070 this game just dont seen to work with stable 60FPS 
---
you cant do much about the shit bethesda is pooping out
---
You don’t know what data mining is do you? How exactly is this guy making money off it?
---
Quite the list but that looks too complicated :/
---
No, use them to your advantage. Let them in to farm, take a cut. I think you should join a very exclusive club friend.
---
The Apocolyptic Aristocracy is opening its doors to all F1s.
---
Hmm. Maybe.
---
Gold versions of perk cards you already have don't become tickets for some reason.
---
Where exactly did he mention making money form data mining? And do you think all data miners are bad?
---
No, the red ball *absorbs* violet/blue wavelengths, and *reflects* light waves in the red spectrum. The ball is red. 
---
It's why colorblindness is labeled as a deficiency, or impairment. They are not seeing the correct color.
---
I do find your exploitation of colorblind people just to prove a point, a bit insensitive.
---
bethesdas treatment of player base is dooming future fallout games. dont' let bullshit divide fans.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dthe7w/map76\_officially\_closed\_creator\_gives\_explanation/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dthe7w/map76_officially_closed_creator_gives_explanation/)
---
Sounds nice. But I’d prefer to specialize in one thing.
---
I feel a troll here. 
---
You cannot have Sent and Cav on armor at the same time, so All of it is Sent and Cav tells me you are full of shit.   
---
Going back, I also cant understand how someone who has played 300+ levels and claims to have tried everything and owns everything cant figure out what is best in life. 
---
I will tell  you what is best in life.
---
To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of the women.
---
Does Bethesda do community management? Surprised no one has reached out to assist.
---
I never find myself using chems. I always forget about them :P
---
&gt;You know, that this is against every agreement in almost every game?
---
Not if the same company gives you the tools to do it.  If Bethesda didn't want people prying around the files, they could have encrypted the ESM in some way.
---
Plus, we're talking about a company whose games host a vibrant modding community which, by definition, has to reverse engineer things Bethesda did just to understand how they work.  Your argument is invalid.
---
Then why should he?
---
Ah thank you :-P
---
#Fuck
---
#Bethesda
---
Ah. But which ones do you recommend?
---
Lmao chill Jeff Bozo.
---
i'm crying over here lolol.  i love it
---
The game IS fun.. Bethesda just can't stop making stupid and detrimental decisions with it.
---
Is it a good time to call Bethesda a dead company yet?
---
It was an amazing interactive map that included locations of basically everything in the game they could find.  The time and dedication they put into it must have been crazy.
---
What on earth are you on about?
---
shit, ill post it on his behalf too!
---
He had an account banned, so he kind of was shut down by them.
---
No, my point was that the normal visioned person is also lying, as there are people with 4 sets of cones that can see extra colors. So "normal" vision is also deficient:

Making us pay for a buggy battle royale would've been the joke of the century. They will release Wastelanders for free, the question is when and will there be enough players left.
---
&lt;Kevin voice&gt; Noisce
---
Wow, you don't get what happened the person doesn't exploit for gain. There's people that hunt down bugs and exploits for fun to report to game developers to help improve the game and take some of the weight off the developer (especially when its shit that might slip past). That's not cheating, its fucking game testing.
---
NOICE
---
OMG, i just about died. I had to walk out of the office as i was laughing and couldn't stop!
---
I think you’re the troll. There are people who level up doing casual stuff. Doesn’t mean they know anything. It’s not both on the same armor. I have both sets of this and I have different pieces of course. If you can’t give me a description about what I asked just don’t post please. I think you’re the one that’s full of shit. Go to the bathroom, open a window and let the sun shine on you so while you turn into stone the turds come flying out with a loud BANG! Troll...
---
I would maybe try and see if there are other reports of this and if it's not a common thing, maybe try to uninstall and reinstall. I honestly don't know what else could really be done :/
---
For simplicity I like executioners.  I run a stealth sniper build and normally get in a first shot sneak hit.  Executioners effect usually finishes them off.  Honestly all the effects you picked are pretty solid.
---
Haha. True.
---
I've spent a few hundo on Crystal in my day.  But only when she works the main stage.
---
You should probably avoid the Vault 51 lobby, at all cost. 
---
That place is a non-stop punchfest. 
---
Frankly, it disturbs my delicate sensibilities.
---
The deleted comment was a nazi whistleblower...
---
Oh hell yeah dude this is what I was looking for. Also just failed NNN
---
NO. If you are thinking about failing no nut november, don't. I believe in you. You must stand strong and push through. Think about how good you will feel on December 1st after you completed the challenge, think about how embarassing it will be when you tell your friends that you failed NNN. You must stay strong, I believe in you. Now, good luck on your mission, soldier. ^(I am a bot, and this action was preformed automatically.)
---
Sounds like Raiders in Disguise to me.
---
You can drop it like anything else, if it is on a frame it will not be in a bag.
---
For FO76 it's a scam when the game doesn't function well at all and breaking the promises that made at the start. It was a bait and switch
---
How about no..?
---
A thriving business is built on going above-and-beyond customer expectations.  It's the reason why despite all of the hoopla swirling around Amazon's monopoly, people *defend* Amazon.  Because they know, by and large, that Amazon will have their back if something goes wrong or needs to be returned.
---
If you are a business, sure, you could tell your customers to take a hike because that's what the book says.  But you do so at your own peril.  A smart business realizes that a gesture of goodwill is worth a lot more than a measly $14.
---
Yes, this is a good impersonation of the dumb reason Bethesda refused to refund him.
---
/sarcasm at the bottom of their post.
---
Can't wait to hear later about how y'all got nuked, or trolled by the nuke mine dupers lol. Starting a class war is petty as fuck.
---
Wow this bot just made me lose NNN
---
Some things to consider on a gunslinger build. 
---
Gunslinger gets its damage from stealth and vats criticals.  Two of the three weapons you mentioned have no stealth ability.  And the third lacks significant damage.  Best gun I found for this build is an automatic bloodied 10mm pistol.  
---
I would reduce intelligence quite a bit.  You don’t need to run gunsmith 5 all the time, if at all.  And demolition doesn’t add enough damage to be worth the investment.  More points in perception and learn to use concentrated fire.  
---
While all three of the guns you mention will work, they all made me cringe at the thought of having to work with them.  Short of a bloodied, the pipe pistol is a dud.  You’ll never stay in stealth with a black powder anything, or the western revolver for that matter.  
---
This is a challenging build that can be fun but will never match the other builds in terms of total damage.  My gunslinger made it to level 105 or so before I got bored and haven’t really touched it in a while.  
---
I predict you’ll drop adrenaline in favor of guerilla9, stealth 3, and covert ops3.  Use armor with AP refresh instead of ActionBoy.  
---
Good luck with it, and have fun!!
---
Okay, troll
---
Aside from the hyperbole and the YT (and other crap journalistic sites), how often have you run into instances of actual bullying?  Like, non-ironic, non-second hand bullying?
---
A world that belongs to only you and your lady murmrgh 👌
---
This is completely inaccurate in the US, chargebacks are a consumer protection mechanism run by credit providers. If you take issue with the quality of the goods or service you can initiate a chargeback.
---
You're talking about making a false fraud claim, which is different, and is actually fraud.
---
I was used to craft some psychobuff on my sniper, but since I made a melee, I'm spamming it. It's worth it. The downside is the thirst going down a bit faster, you have t be careful, but since I heal through Nuka, it's okay.
---
One of my good friends made a really fun explosive build back in January.  He was having a ton of fun playing and I would give him all the grenades, missles, and nukes I would find.  The whole build just came crashing down after the nerf.  All the materials needed to craft explosives and repair just weren't worth it.
---
I gave you an upvote peasant. As for getting nuked... We have the best with us. We are thee Elite and tonight we hunt. (Grief).
---
I see. Thanks for the input
---
lol.. well played

its not really private if you have any friends, they can just join your world with no invites

If younger players can't deal with what comes to a 18 rated game they shouldn't be playing it should they? It's supposed to be a guidance for who should be playing and if they ignore the guidance it's their fault.

no.. I don't have this happening on PC
---
Have an upvote pauper.

o7
---
I am so glad that I didn't have a computer capable of running the game at launch, now I know, I would play the game, but only if I got it for free, there is so much trash going on, it's not even funny anymore
---
To be fair,  Feed The People feeding ALL THE PEOPLE was awesome.  I wish they brought it back to cure some of the toxicity going round.
---
imo its not worth the money right now. you need to pay the subscription to get the full experience, there is still alot of bugs and most of the utility items are behind a paywall. 
---
even though there is a decent of content to the game, there is going to be alot more next year. if you are going to buy the game, i would wait until wastelanders.
---
Some of the original raiders were aristocrats stuck at the ski lodge so...
---
Nice! If you could make a list of combinations that work for most things, I’d very much appreciate that!
---
If you run a game as a service and you thumb your nose at the people helping build your community, you're not going to be running your game as a service for long. This has been true since the dawn of the MMO, probably before.
---
Something seems off about this post. Bethesda/Zenimax are known for sending Cease and Desist to all unlicensed sources. This is speculation but maybe this dude got one of those letters and is a bit salty. The way this dude is venting seems like there's a bit more to this.
---
No trolls here, only entitled Gentlemen and Ladies.
---
Fair enough, that works
---
Salty angsteenyear old downvotes. 
---
You’re right. I read the post. Dude actually performed and exploit and had buyers remorse. I paid for Fallout1st too and it was exactly as advertised. Yes there were bugs. That’s not false advertising though. You got what they said you’d get. Private servers ARE private; he just didn’t understand that when they said you and your friends. Not Bethesda’s fault if you randomly add people constantly and your friends list is more of a list of people that’s you’ve encountered once in game. I have one single person on my friends list that isn’t an actual friend from another game and that person was a weapons dealer before shops existed. 
---
Dude is in no way entitled to a refund. He just feels like he is entitled because he’s apparently special and the rules don’t apply.
---
Best of luck with that. Reporting this post, and account. It's clear you only made it to be trouble, so if the mods see this, hopefully they will deal with it.
---
No, I use Calmex...and lots of it.
---
/Sniper.
---
Thank you I am not too concerned with it being meta as my two other characters already fill that area, additionally I would love to use other weapons but I simply lack the time to efficiently grind for legendaries
---
As for using a concentrated fire auto pistol build, this is mostly for fun as my other two builds are kinda boring plus since concentrated fire is mostly broken I really don't want to use it
---
He said he has no one on his friends list.
---
Wait it doesn't spoil anymore.  Shit I really need to hit up Mama Dulces again.
---
I'd say it's Anti-Armor for guns, Instigating for melee.  Vampire if you find yourself in need of health regularly.
---
He didn't.  Did you read?   He actively participated in a site that used and exploited exploits.  Duplicated an existing exploit and reported only that.  Not the other exploits.
---
Two-shot and AA is very basic jack-of-all-trades primaries. Works in every situation.
---
Explosive is a great secondary (combines badly with Furious) or Fast Fire Rate for auto weapons. Or swing speed for melee.
---
Third stat is mostly personal taste, I like 90% weight of so I can carry more stuff.
---
I’d go for AA after someone wrote a detailed description of the pros and cons of each legendary. Vampire is mostly extra health. But that works nice as I have weapons with this prefix.
---
r/oddlyspecific ?
---
The game is in a good place and has been for awhile. There are still bugs, but they're mostly minor annoyances. Some are more major but they are incredibly rare or require the player to be doing something they shouldn't be doing in the first place (the inventory loss bug from getting disconnected during a raid involved a fairly convoluted set of circumstances that's trivially easy to avoid). 
---
The story and atmosphere is by far my favorite of any Fallout game. I *liked* that there are no NPCs in 76, in part because of why there weren't any. There might be another free trial period when Wastelanders come out like there was for Nuclear Winter.
---
It’s hard to believe that this is the same company that released Skyrim, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4. I’m frankly amazed how far Bethesda has fallen.
---
Yeah, and is this just a bunch of neat rocks or do you do massage therapy or other stuff with those things?
---
Also, have you got any salt crystals? We used to give the horses salt licks if they were low on sodium and I remember they always looked kind of pretty in the packaging... Yknow before they got covered in horse slobber :P
---
What on earth do you mean peasant? This is friendly game play...
---
Nice!
---
Entitled indeed.
---
Remember, remember, the 8th of November.
---
The day the Elitist and Entitled... were shot dead.
---
Well, the krill have been whale hunting lately so might as well
---
I dont need to uninstall. It uninstals in its own.
---
Leveling my explosives alt atm. Need to do something with all these rockets I keep finding.
---
Make sure you tell your bank to block any attempted billing from them.
---
lmao you’re so poetic 😂
---
I quote "try reading.. The patch notes"
---
Does not work anymore like that, damage is now null while in pacifist, both taken and dealt, so there is no "legal" way of engaging with someone on pacifist mode.
---
Sweet! What would be the best third stat? Should I go for a heavy, or a commando? Something else?
---
Even in the world of greedy corporation refund is not unheard of. I read on Reddit from time to time how customer service refunded a microtransactions. I guess that's not the case with Bethesda.
---
Awesome. I’ve got them all :)
---
I've watched this game slowly get worse and worse. Glad I deleted it months ago. Bethesda won't get a dime from me for at least a decade. Or until they can prove customer loyalty.
---
&gt;Ad Blocker? Consider an upgrade to PRO to remove ads and get extra features.
---
He makes money from map 76, which uses the mined data.   Would not be suprised if some of the data was obtained through using in game exploits as well.
---
You're an idiot and you obviously don't know anything about the technical side of shit if you think "data miners" are some shadowy figures out to ruin the game.
---
I've just screenshot your gt, fortunately I'm on xb. See you soon.
---
Great stuff!
---
yeah but because they said they were a female and it's the only game they like since the 90s she want more outrage
---
I pretty much lost all interest in this game when they released NW. That was the first major hint that the game was going in opposite direction of what I though it would be. Many new issues popped up since then. The absolutely ridiculous subscription on top of a broken and unfinished $60 mobile game was what made me lose all hope in Bethesda as a company and now I don't even care about Wastelanders or their other titles.
---
Well if you are not investing time into this, might as well not play.
---
Shit like this is exactly why I have no hope left for the game. Bethesda won't respond to any of our concerns, doesn't fix long-standing problems, and doubles down on the kind of shit the majority of the community has said they don't like. 
---
I'm going on another hiatus. I'll check back in a few months to see if it has gotten any better. I'm not holding my breath though.
---
based on your stipulation of always relevant regardless the condition id say anti-armor.
---
bloodies/jumkies/beserkers all make you adjsut hings accordingly
---
2shot is notorious for negatly affecting accuracy
---
explosive got nerfed hard and is not that great without a few perks geared for it
---
instigating is amazing (and my favorite) but if you dont kill it first shot you might be in trouble with a mob
---
vampires is great but really only on automatic weapons to get the most from them
---
Quad comes in at 3rd place as its always helpful to have more ammo without reloading
---
executioners comes in 2nd place as its always nice to get that boost when the enemy health is low
---
and as i said above, Anti Armor needs no other perk and just gives outright benefit, and stacks with a few perk cards if you decide to go that way... but no perk cards are really required as you get AA straight away
---
Thank you. You’re kind for applauding me ;)
---
Lol. Seriously the best PvPers have 1st.
---
You openly admit this is a call for griefing. It's petty, entitled, and utterly childish, and as far as I'm aware, it breaks both the remain civil, and no witch hunting rules. If you plan to attempt to insite a class war to target a specific demographic in the game, it could also be considered targeted harassment, and get you banned.
---
100% AA/FFR. I wouldn’t go with anything Explosive as it deals self damage, therefore making CQC impossible.
---
For those of you who are just learning about this meme like I did, watch it with subtitles on. I was very confused for a while there.
---
The base game only cost $60. The other $140 you paid went to the special edition stuff and anyone could have told you that stuff was overpriced from the start, getting it is more of a status thing than anything else. Fallout 1st doesn't change or lessen the base game in any way.
---
Not likely.
---
Unlikely.  Reporting some exploits while using them to prevent other people from being able to abuse them as well is one of the many methods used to gain credibility and ill gotten gains.
---
He very much was and is using data mining and exploits for person gain.
---
Yeah. I have this isdue with my instigating excllosive combat shotgun.
---
😂👍🏻
---
"Normal", as much as I dislike the word, would reflect the majority of the population, making people with *more* receptors than the norm, as much an abnormality as people with *fewer*.
---
I’m going to play AA!
---
Because there is no new stories or quests, y'know, what 99% of people consider "content" to mean.
---
When you spend a LOT of time, money, and effort helping a company make millions in profits without anything in return, I dunno what should you expect? I would expect that company to want to hold onto a free resource.

Technically I am a qualified crystal healer and meditation instructor as well as a practising witch. I have a few salt lamps and Himalayan salts.

Lol, ahhh calmex.. Great stuff, helps spotting the peasants so much easier.

At this point Bethesda respond time on tickets is most likely super slow due to trolls

it's not a private server, it's a private world
---
But please try. I'll gladly be the one to get you banned. I'm screen shotting this entire thing, so please, try. Targeted harassment, even online is actually against several laws, and has over the years evolved to include games. So please, pay my mortgage for a bit, and give me a reason to get you banned.
---
I really really tried with this game and honestly loved it. It had the concept for a fallout game I've been looking for. 
---
But after all the shit that Bethesda keeps doing since the day of release.. I think I'm finally going to just delete the game and get Outer World's. 
---
Breaks my heart . I've always been a die hard Bethesda fan. This fucking sucks.
---
Doesn't change the fact that to them the person saying red is wrong because they can see more of the color spectrum.
---
\*thumbs up\* you made myself and the fiance chuckle
---
yes, but you emphasized PRIVATE in all caps, as if that makes it the end all accurate description.  it isnt.
---
if Op ever adds a friend he should be aware they can join his world anytime without an invite.  Op seems to enjoy playing solo so he deserves to know before he decides to spend money on a private server.
---
No, friendly game hunting.
---
I run a Heavy build on my main, but that is mostly because I love power armor and I happened to have a TSE Plasma Gatling from before they became legacy, so it is a very nice Heavy Weapon, but there is a lot of fun heavy weapons (flamers, gatlings, minigun, harpoons etc). I do commando on my alt, have a few Two-shot or AA Fast fire weapons. Man, they rip people apart.
---
Both are fun builds. Hard to say which is more fun, which is why I do both!  
---
;-)
---
&gt;do you think all data miners are bad?
---
Nope.  However they almost all assist exploiters.
---
&gt;Where exactly did he mention making money form data mining?
---
If you think he was not making money you are kidding yourself.  Map76 is proof enough.
---
Not how it'll look to anyone with more brain cells than teeth.
---
I totally agree. Also, the timer before the event starts doesn't give you enough time to shut off the robots and go through that whole part of it which can make a big difference and it's one of those events where you want to change your perks and equip for.
---
We have mutual friends, who have already offered me a way to your server.
---
You do a chargeback on Sony, for ANY reason, and they'll ban your entire PSN account in a heartbeat. They don't give a shit if it's fraud, consumer protection, accident, etc.
---
They're cutthroat about it and unapologetic.
---
That must be it, then.
---
Awesome! Commando or heavy. Hmm.
---
Uhm.... no!
---
“ such a great idea but I won’t accept the idea because they may put it behind a paywall”
---
-95% of players on this sub.
---
Sure, just remember that AA has little effect on low armour targets, and it is bad for melee as melee has the 75% AA perk.
---
and it's usually dormant accounts
---
He verified the exploits existence then reported it. He was doing the important part for Bethesda
---
Since you need Power Armor to let heavy weapons benefit from the Stabilizer perk, I suggest going for T-51b power armor because it has the highest damage and energy resistance.
---
now hold on here before i get downvoted into oblivion, do we have proof like text messages between bethesda asking for the refund and the ban messages?
---
The nuka paint plans are in game not atomic store.
---
Interesting, my mother took me for crystal healing a few times when I was a kid. Can't say I'm a believer, but I've certainly benefitted in the long term from having been brought up around a more open mindset.
---
It’s become painfully obvious that the people making decisions for Bethesda aren’t gamers and know nothing about how gaming communities work.
---
It's funny to see people still actually care about this game. It's been a lost cause since February.
---
in survival before it closes damage was rendered to only be the event of perks not legendary arena. They will probably do the same in adventure mode in a few patches or they next one.
---
The fact that they're perceiving additional "colors" from the ball doesn't change the fact that the ball is still reflecting lightwaves in the red spectrum. They are still not seeing the ball correctly.
---
1 person sees green, 1 person sees a rainbow, 98 people see red. The two are outliers, and are not, in fact, seeing the correct color.
---
You mean that's the 2nd or 3rd *weak* in a row
---
... I'll see myself out
---
Would Strangler Heart suffice?
---
Think Junkies is the best overall. Yeah that addiction can be a bit of a pain in the ass but when it comes to dmg output, it just demolishes anti armor
---
go vampire
---
Fuck Bethesda with a tire iron. They’ve systematically destroyed their entire fanbase over the past year. 
---
I don’t know who in their right mind would buy another game from them, but I know Reddit will be right back out there hyping their next release like nothing happened. It’s up to us to shame Bethesda, but more importantly to shame and downvote people who try to shill for it.
---
Ah, thank you!
---
saposed fanale pisset   is my Arcade Fire cover-band name

&gt; charged back
---
A chargeback should be the *last* resort if you don't get it handled properly by the company. It's intended to be used for *billing errors* that the vendor refuses to handle, or merchandise that was ordered but was *not received* or was *damaged* and that the vendor refuses to acknowledge.
---
Instituting a chargeback immediately for something you purchased accidentally is flat-out wrong -- because the vendor gets charged fees for chargebacks and can be assessed other penalties if they get too many! 
---
Doing a chargeback for what is basically your own "honest mistake" is forcing the vendor to pay for your error, and I can completely understand a company penalizing their customer for it.
---
I’m more of a casual player. I don’t mind losing out on damage output, I think it’s more fun to pump things full with lead! Rambo style.
---
Friendly reminder that no company would refund your money after you spend money in cash shop.  
---
  
---
It was many times in news how someone's kid spent hundreds of dollars in cash shop and they won't get their money back
---
cool
---
After reading this I don't think you met your partner on FO76 it sounds like you met a local boy who plays Fallout.
---
I understand wanting to nerd TSE's, but all they needed to do for that is make it so both Demolitions Expert *and like Shotgunner or Rifleman or what have you boosts the damage. Make it so like if both are equipped only the better of the 2 apply to your weapon. And leave other explosive weapons alone. They weren't OP. Oh well

I've been attacked at Hemlock Holes twice, once when I wasn't even holding the workshopm but instead was talking to the cook for the event.
---
 Same here with the lead, I had my camp on the spot where you can claim lead and junk nodes, and when I was noticing how little lead the thing was producing and how utterly ugly the Toxic Valley is, it was time to move elsewhere. Not to mention, a junk node is great but when you're stash is pushing the limit, it's sort of pointless to keep managing it because of excess junk.

...no

According to patch notes, nothing regarding pacifict mode was done save for this in 1.2.1.18

&gt; Pacifist Mode: No longer appears enabled for characters below level 5 in Adventure Mode after playing a Nuclear Winter match.

And this way back in 1.0.1

Wasteland Workshop for Fallout 4 had no new stories or quests, how is it not content?
---
Blue screens on ps4 are way up since last update. I hadnt had 1 in months. Ive gotten at least 1 a day since last update.
---
Well considering there is little time left this year, this it is impossible for them.
---
They have less than 100 people in Bethesda Austin while Zenimax (TESO) or Digital Extreme(Warframe) has over 200.
---
What makes you think concentrated fire is broken?   I’m using it to get head shots all the time.  Except when enemies show up as friendly of course....is that what you’re referring to?
---
Auto Grenade Launcher you mean.
---
Load up that big ammo case with snow and get to pelting!
---
Anyone else gonna just pretend the recent controversies and data mining didn’t happen?
---
If it is not ready yet for release, then there is not much that can be done about that. Although it might not be a bad idea to release a new trailer, or 5-10 minutes of gameplay footage, assuming the expansion is still set to release before the end of Q1 2020, there should be enough playable content to show by now.
---
You can still solo it. I can't but I know people that did
---
You really made an entire account just to troll?
---
I wont be bothered searching up the internet after i finish working, you on ps4? Ill let you attack me as much as you want and you'll see for yourself, not on ps4? Just attack a random player and see that beautiful 0 dmg come up on the screen, the only way of doing any damage is with pumpking grenade and nuke mine via the rads damage they do, and ofc they have to stand still.
---
You're wrong (for the most part), chargebacks are *not* for if you make a mistake or have buyer's remorse, it's for when you've encountered *actual* fraud or have a dispute with a company and can't resolve it with them.  It's not intended to be a front line 'do over' as you described.
---
There are penalties to companies when someone does a chargeback, and it can significantly effect the company (not so much at Blizzard's size though).  It's possible to lose your merchant status with the credit card company if enough chargebacks are registered.
---
If you order something, and initiate a chargeback without contacting the company for resolution (which is what you seem to describe), you can pretty much expect that they'll treat it like fraud and ban you.  In fact, even if you go through the customer service process, and the company doesn't agree with your complaint, they can still ban you for doing a chargeback.  You have virtually no protection in the US that tells a company that they have to continue doing business with you under almost any circumstance, and certainly not under the one you describe.
---
Yes, this was the sole point I was making, very astute!
---
Plasma mine plans too.  I finally saw a guy with one On PS4 but he wouldn’t sell.
---
Troll? What on earth do you mean?
---
Anti-armor, no doubt. And faster swing for melee.
---
Hoping they release one for the 1 year anniversary to look forward to the future
---
Probly the same bug that keeps coming back with melee weapons pretty sure theyve patched it more than once now
---
Scout masks ( forrest &amp; urban ) as well as the BOS, white springs and white powder jumpsuits are a drop after completing savage divide events. I got the whole drop after doing, One Violent Night.
---
Citation required.
---
Ive supported my claim, with the very thing you tried to use to support you.
---
The burden is on you. Ill wait.
---
Yeah! I agree completely. At least there are the older games to still enjoy
---
Last few times it has popped for me, I go repair all the turrets, clear mobs...and then I watch the timer hit 0 and no one has shown up.  
---
And there's really only so many times I feel like soloing it on my rifle character.
---
All I want is to unlock the damn backpack skin...but nooooooo.
---
95% hit chance misses at times with all weapons, not just melee.  I suppose it's why it's listed at 95% instead of 100% but in any event, it is what it is.  
---
As for hit boxes I think it depends a bit on your platform.  On PC at the moment it seems to mostly impact the 1st hit - it will show a damage number but no health loss - but then after it's good to go.
---
I'm referring to how to select a body part moves your character
---
It looks like he wasn't banned for the data mining, but instead for reporting an exploit.  He and his team checked to make sure it was valid and then reported what they knew to Bethesda.  Bethesda banned all their accounts for exploiting.  This stance on exploits makes it so if a player finds one, they will just keep quiet about it and use it repeatedly since apparently they are going to get banned either way if Bethesda finds out about it.
---
It's noon somewhere...
---
What does that have to do with this discussion?
---
Pretty sure havent pvped since i went to use my black powder only to find its completely useless a month ago
---
The rarest item in the game is...
---
a game.
---
Pffft, the changes were made, a patch note exist, if i have some time later ill search it up for you, i just wanted to clarify something that was written wrong, as i said attack anybody and see for yourself
---
r/Acurrate
---
That's a good point! Just very frustrating. It's like if someone follows a movie franchise for years and it suddenly takes a big turn for the worse, people are going to complain. I guess there is no dedicated sub for hating Fallout 76 (except maybe this one)
---
What a fantastic place to go. God, i wish i could be so lucky.
---
We definitely will be getting an event.
---
Last year at Christmas, the news banner at login had a blurb about checking out Deathclaw Island around this time of year for a picnic or something akin to that. This happened right during Christmas time, and eventually disappeared come January.
---
Just like every event we've had so far. 
---
A lot of the basic parts of the holiday content was pre-planned/pre-developed at release.
---
Pretty sure we even saw the addition of Valentines Day content from data miners months back, well after Valentines Day.
---
I wouldn't get too pessimistic. Only part I'm ready to be grumpy about is Christmas content releasing the day after Thanksgiving, as is good and proper tradition in a capitalist society.
---
Very acurrate.
---
This makes *a lot* of sense lol
---
I take it youve never heard of kixeye. Theyve had a rocky game filled with pay to win vices. Amd have several times, fully refunded customers who were blatantly lied too. 
---
Also, Australia. Anyone who used their refund got back their atom spending aswell.
---
I really hope no one touches the next game they make
---
All game developers do this. That’s why a lot of companies (like Bethesda) rush their games out in buggy, half-baked states. EA did it with Battlefield V and Anthem, for instance, in order to meet the Fall deadline, when games are available in time for the holidays (Bethesda did this too). It’s why Blizzard banned blitzchung because Tencent, a Chinese company, is a HUGE investor for them, and Blizzard believed if they supported him, Tencent would pull out. Investors are vital for game developers, especially AAA ones. Investors put a lot of stake in these companies, and if they lag behind, they pull out, and the companies falter. It’s a vicious cycle of pleasing them, only for their games to be bad, only to sell poorly or receive huge criticism, then playing catch-up, and the cycle repeats.
---
Everyone is different and it's these differences that allow us to experience the Universe in a unique way
---
I loved this game and defended it despite the negativity and reactionary rubbish pushed around by people who never even gave it a chance.  I found a lot in the game to do despite people saying there was nothing (utter rubbish).  The lack of NPCs annoyed my at first but i got used to it and Bethesda seemed to be in the process of fixing it by actually LISTENING to the community.  
---
Then Fallout 1st happened and I haven't played it since.  Bethesda don't care about us and this is an excellent example of that.  Make Fallout 1st free (which it should be) and then I, and many others, will come back.
---
People can spend their money on whatever they want
---
&gt;You're a T_D poster
---
Nice meme. Do you have an actual argument? As an aside, I don't see anything wrong with data mining either. It's certainly a flattering gesture toward Bethesda.
---
Does any1 know what happens to fo76 after the wastelanders dlc, or will they just leave it to die?

fireproof + dense chest armor mitigates explosive damage to ones self.
---
It's *not* inaccurate - the chargeback process is intended to be used *after* you have unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the issue with the vendor yourself. Doing a chargeback should never be the first step.
---
And as the previous poster said, buyer's remorse or "user error" or "my kid did it" is not a sufficient reason to do a chargeback.
---
So u want it to be released when its not ready?
---
So you know, I am a economic wizard. I took two classes about it in college and read a lot of columns about stocks! That doesn't make it less shitty, I don't really get what point you're making
---
Go sign up for a Warcraft sub. Then, 2 weeks in, after using your level boost, and getting banned, demand a refund. See how that works out for you...
---
You won't get one. They won't renew your sub at the end of the month, but you won't get a refund for the month you played during. 
---
He's not entitled to a refund unless he paid for more than one month of access. He doesn't specify if he did that or not.
---
Todd Howard is kinda cute ngl
---
Howd he help them make money? Seriously. The maps a nice guide for the community but its a self project. In the end hes an outsider telling other people how to do their jobs. Making a guide doesnt entitle you to anything from the developer.
---
I had my camp in the same spot. No one comes. It's far out of the way so you spend more caps traveling. So many people use that spot so there's a 50/50 chance your spot will be taken. I moved close by White Spring Station but not close enough to overlap anything else. Made a very minimalistic camp that's only half budget right now and I like it. I PvP a lot so I already had it leveled once and it cost like 40 steel, and a bunch less of everything else to repair and I was happy about that.
---
Haha, so you’re saying that the information and service he provides. The amount of time and effort THAT EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT FROM doesn’t deserve to break even? Dude, in all likelihood he has a dedicated server running that website to provide for everyone interested in his findings. But nah, fuck ‘em. He’s not selling the information on eBay you Twat Waffle. He’s spending hours doing bug testing that Bethesda should’ve been doing in the first place.
---
Indeed, if you have the room.
---
Counter-intuitively newer PCs are affected significantly by the poor optimization in the game. I have a 9700K with 16GB DDR4 PC3200 RAM from end of last year and have more crashes and lockups than people on older machines with fewer processor cores. The game isn't as multi-threaded as actually well built games/game engines are. Any Blizzard game, for example, runs like butter on my machine.

Fallout 76: Wild Appalachia Patch Notes
---
March 26, 2019
---
"Slap" damage has been removed from Adventure mode. 
---
All incoming damage from players you are not hostile with (A.K.A. "slap" damage) will now be automatically reduced to zero, effectively removing slap damage from Adventure Mode.
---
Source: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_patch_1.1.1.2
---
Junkies if you dont mind having a couple of negatives  in places that wont affect your damage dealing.  Its always 50% more damage provided you have 5 addictions and you can run at full health.
---
AA if having lowered special stats affects your gameplay in a negative way.  But its only a 28%(ish) damage increase but again you can run at full health.
---
Both of these are more flat builds that dont really need to take into account situational parameters like armor or health level (you or your target) and do more reliable, less spiky, damage.
---
no just that it WAS sopposed to be the last update of the year
---

What??? That's not the point why fallout 1st is a joke
---
Bethesda in Australia MUST refund because they have customer protection. When you look at FIFA, World of Tanks, War Thunder etc., All of them have a rule: "If you bought something in cash shop and used it, you can't refund it"
---
Oh the head disappearing still works. You just need multiple of a headwear type and to switch between the 2 versions rapidly. Eventually the game will try to load 1 but won't register it as equipped so it loads nothing.
---
Sweet! Just what I need. I will be using Anti-Armor. What weapon type would you recommend though?
---
Can't see a comment if it's deleted and I don't know how to work Romeveddit or whatever it's called either. Considering how many times I've seen excessive shit thrown at supporters and non supporters alike, I figured this was one of those times. If not, my apologies and good on you for calling out an actual Nazi.

Sony is a bunch of cutthroat assholes and their customer support is well known for banning accounts for minor issues. You do a chargeback for any reason and they'll ban your account and won't restore it for any reason.
---
Blizzard would have treated this guy the same and their CS is usually well viewed. They don't refund used game time or used in-game assets for people who have been banned. Period.
---
Do you have proof or is this just wild speculation. Since hey, you’re a terrible person that needs to be making money off of every little thing. So everyone must be exactly like that. 
---
Or maybe you’re the one using the exploits and you’re pissed off at him for reporting it.

---
They advertised Atom shop discounts for First subscribers, so they'd probably still charge for it.
---
I hope someone at Bethesda reads this and gives a shit.
---
you need to learn what fallacies are, and then learn them again.
---
I see a lot of people suggesting anti-armor, but that is only good for heavily-armored enemies. If your weapon already deals more damage than your target's damage resistance, then even a mutant's prefix (10% more damage when mutated) will end up dealing more damage than anti-armor. The anti-armor description may say that it reduces the target's armor by 50%, but that doesn't mean that it makes weapons deal double damage. I know you're looking for something that works in every situation, but everything has a condition.

What ur saying might be true buy its no secret that company is not great for consumers as far as i know theyve not released numbers for what it costs them every month if im wrong let me know and if theyd quit doin these controversial things they might be able to make money of the sales but after the 1st fiasco i think that boat has sailed
---
well it alternates with the ecological balance daily so one day it's strange brew the next it's ecological balance
---
That has nothing to do with pacifist mode...

I liked PP before they essentially nerfed it. Now it is uncommon for others to join and even when they do, I have had the alpha spawn as a non legendary. Seriously not worth the time and effort.

Enter Arenanet - if you buy something from the gemstore, and it proves to be what you didnt want or it didnt work. Within 30days, support will refund you the item. However, youd be unable to buy the item again, for a period of time.
---
100% agree.
---
Crazy to me that people are still shilling to Bethesda.
---
That!s a bummer. What would you recommend instead? Vampire’s or Quad?
---
You using that in this scenario makes you sound like you belong on r/hellofellowkids
---
My bad. It’s been 7+ years since I’ve played the game and looked at the credits. But yeah, it’s sad to see them go. So many good memories.
---
Good bot
---
aa affects all weapons the same.  you get a \~28% damage boost against enemies above a certain threshold of DR/ER regardless of the weapon.  So looking at it from that lense there's no "best" weapon to put it on as it affects every last weapon in the game the same way.  
---
But if you must have an answer then I'd guess it's best on weapons that have no other way to pierce armor.  So that would be all the revolvers and probably some other pistols I can't think of off the top of my head.
---
The only weapons that really “require” (and that’s a strong word) PA are heavy guns, since you can run stabilized with them (additional accuracy and armor penetration while in PA). Running PA also decreases your ability to engage stealth, so a lot of rifles and sneak attack weapons won’t favor it. There is no best AA weapon, it’s build dependent. One of the best things about the AA affix is unlike junkie’s or bloodied it isn’t dependent on your character, so you can go wild and play however you like. Do you like heavy guns? Machine guns like the handmade? Shotguns? All will benefit greatly from AA. The most popular seem to be AA explosive or AA FFR .50 cal and Handmade.
---
Try unplugging your router for 1 minute and console. If your using a PC defrag. A ssd would surely make a difference if you have the money for it.

Stop calling it bullying if it's in a game, or even online. Because you can avoid it entirely by just cut the power and doing something else.

Him and a few others found a security exploit and reported it straight to Bethesda, Bethesda then fixed it and banned them, imagine if that happened with the credit card canvas bag ? If someone told them of the security flaw BEFORE people’s cards and info were exposed.
---
You kidding? Removes completely slap damage, pacifist or not. He could not have been killed by someone because the bullets or swings do 0 damage. You need to be actively engaged in pvp, which cant be done in pacifist since he said there were no workshops involved man
---
Depends what build you're going for. Explosive is great for pve and faster firing rate for pvp. Go with power armor if you choose a heavy gun and equip stabilized.
---
I’m going to go for the 50Cal. I’ not much of a stealth player. Thank you!
---
Never said i liked it,  but people buying it are being teased and griefed
---
"We here at Bethesda don't believe in putting out functional products and make you PAY to be what is essentially a game tester. After you've paid, we'll ban your ass for supporting our trash with your money time, and resources and skills that pinpoint our bugs... I mean features" honestly, when are the rest of you gonna say enough is enough?
---
An AA Pipe revolver with assorted perks sound nice. What else on this weapon would you recommend?
---
AA without a shadow of a doubt. Vampires would be the most beneficial in another way.
---
Man. That was epic. I needed a good vid like this to get my day rolling!
---
I kind of want to buy fallout 1st just so I can get in on some of this bullying.  I find it's too hard to get into pvp these days :(
---
That's exactly how basis QA is done, but this guy doesn't seem to understand the difference.
---
I haven't seen anything in game that indicates any of this is going on. Is this even a real thing or just fake news?  I played a lot during the mischief event and I didn't see anyone getting griefed. I didn't hear any chatter on the mic's either.  
---
The only negative stuff I have seen about Fallout 1st has been youtube and on this sub.  I have my opinions about Fallout 1st but if people want to buy it I think it's their business.
---
This is really it.
---
Patience I'd rather wait for a completed expansion. If Bethesda said it isn't ready can you imagine how incomplete it is given thier track record?
---
It won't.
---
It technically is the best power armor in the game, but it takes a lot to obtain. That power armor alone is better than most legendary effects if used with very fast weapons like the minigun, but it has a chance of crashing your game.
---
I’ve heard explosive decreases weapon durability much more than something without it. I’m more PvE since survival was removed.
---
i guess your right
---
Enjoy! It’s a lot of fun
---
It's a bug, not a feature
---
Where does it say that pacifist mode PREVENTS damage to you from others? Nowhere. Absolutely nowhere.
---
Two Shot doesn't produce an extra shell for shotguns, it either simply shoots 1 extra pellet, or adds as a percentage of damage like most TS weapons since its nerf, can't really remember right now.
---
Mostly because I haven't touched a TS shotgun for ages. The real problem with TS is how it DESTROYS your spread accuracy.
---
You can mod it all you want, you'll never put every pellet in a ghouls chest unless you're firing point blank. 
---
It's difficult enough contending with the inherent shotgun distance based damage modifiers having each pellet do 1 damage while a few steps closer hits them for max, adding in spread issues just makes it unusable.
---
This game runs terribly but if u have alotta stuff on you i can almost assure u thats part of the problem
---
Drama aside, I'd like to know what parts aren't ready and if they honestly needed First to help fund or just milking.
---
I’m banned for posting YouTube links haha :)
---
Getting your camp destroyed is a good way to clear out some space in the stash:)
---
Purple Tier: Gauss Rifle
---
The biggest issue explosives have is the condition of the missile launchers and such. Two shot missile launchers, fat mans, and grenade launchers are all really good and do double damage compared to a stock one, they fire 2 full strength explosives, but they also break twice as fast.
---
My two shot missile launcher does around 1600 damage but it only fires 8 rockets before it breaks. Maybe the grenade launchers would fare better? I haven't tried them. I also have a two shot fat man that does 3000+ damage that i haven't tried yet, but I would assume it probably breaks quickly too.
---
 Rank 3 of ordinance express, in strength, reduces the weight of explosives by 90%. So carrying them becomes a non-issue. You should probably focus on making a good heavy or rifle build that carries the explosives as a backup. Its not viable as a primary weapon because of the durability. My heavy character carries around 200 missiles but I can't fire them in any reasonable time frame because your basically shooting repair kits out of your rocket launcher that point.
---
I know about the crashing and I fixed that myself. What weapon would you recommend else than the Minigun for strangler heart? If I’m using Strangler Heart should I even be using Anti-Armor?
---
Bugs are features silly, fixing them would be removing content.
---
Not unless you have 2 Xbox’s or a trusted friend. I wouldn’t risk just dropping it.
---
Thank you! For now I have decided on AA.

No, I dont even play the game they haven't gotten a dime from me concerning this dumpster fire of a game. I've just been watching since its release and would like my fellow gamers to be more aware and more conscious of what is going on around them.
---
oh lol.  I subbed now so I'm all set
---
:D
---
He runs advertising doesn't he?
---
It seems obvious to me he is trying to weaponize the community. Bethesda wronged me, so I'm shutting the site down. If that upsets you, get angry at Bethesda, not me.
---
Given the quality of 3D printers.... maybe?
---
I've always hoped there would be a 'weeping angels' type encounter with the mannequins.
---
Sadly they are always static.
---
Heavy weapons (except the harpoon gun and the cryolator) can't have the Quad prefix. Since you're already tanky with power armor, my guess is to go with mutant's since nobody really plays without mutations.
---
As far as I know AA works the same on every weapon so whatever weapons you like bro.  Plus I dont seem to be in the majority with the weapons I personally like. For instance I dislike the tesla and handmade intensely and prefer my assault rifle every day of the week but they are both metas to everyone else and do more damage than the assault rifle. And last night I spent the whole night whacking things with a shovel because the noise it make is amusing to me.  Shovels are the worst melee because no perk buffs their damage.  Just thought it was funny.  In my defense the gf did too lol
---
THE DAMAGE IS GONE, POOF, EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT IN PACIFIST. Pacifist mode prevents you from attacking someone by mistake and flagging yourself for pvp. But the actual hits will deal no damage. In any scenario.
---
Dude are you a brick wall? Stop for a moment and think. Or try in game. Its silly what we are doing right now. You will not give me reasons, fine. Try it for yourself.
---
If you liked fo4 then you can probably get your moneys worth out of fo76.  It feels and plays very similarly.  
---
You will probably at first be like "huh I wonder why this game got such bad reviews?"
---
Definitely in my top 3. Awesome for when you get swarmed by high level mobs, keeps you right in their face.
---
That’s the most likely scenario but I’d hope Bethesda is at least attempting to scrounge some content together for the coming months. At least a few new events would be nice
---
Yeah I feel like Bethesda does not understand GaaS at all. Ive been watching from the outside, wanting to get the game but after Fo4 I told myself to let their games bake for a few years (which in GaaS services of late tends make them past prime after 2 to 3 years).
---
Dense plans aren't as rare as the rest of your list for sure.
---
Orange: Prototype Stealthboy
---
Purple: Combat Shotgun, Gauss Rifle, Scoped Lever Action Rifle, Automatic laser pistol, Tesla Rifle1
---
Blue: Assualt Rifle, Scoped Hunting Rifle 
---
Green: Double Barrel Shotgun, Pump Action Shotgun, Pipe Revolver
---
That's all I remember
---
Yes.
---
I beleive it is like a 5 minute window.
---
I transferred the other day, I had loaded main and placed him near my alt.  Put stuff in a box to try, logged out, switched charecters and loaded into private and the stuff was there.  Went back to main and put the actual stuff I wanted to transfer, logged out, switched charecters and loaded back in and all my goodies were there.
---
Slightly risky because of the time window, but easier then waiting for a courier or trying to find somebody on reddit.
---
Give me a one star Bloodied Handmade with a supressor and I'm good in any situation
---
I pay for an ark server on nitrado. (I'm used to overlooking bugs in games. Lol). You can also host a private server from your xbox for free. It's a bit restricted, as in you need to stay close to the host. Its something tho. So I think there should be a way to play on you own map, even in if it is one player only.
---
The unlimited scrap box is what grinds my gears. Stash limit has been peddled as the cause of a lot of problems with the game. Now it isn't if you pay? 
---
I enjoy the game itself. I'll still play, but I wont pay. I'm pretty sure we were told content like this would be free. Cosmetic only mico transactions. I may be wrong about that.
---
Id make an angry face too not becuz of 1st but becuz the ncr are evil
---
Only on certain weapons is it that noticable. I run my BE 50 cal on multiple queen runs without it breaking while mowing down multiple enemys. Where as my BE gatling plasma might only fire around 750 rounds i think. I believe rifles see more of durability issue since they are more precise and heavy guns are meant to spray large amounts of ammunition.
---
Oh, I use an Xbox control on PC. We don’t have that problem.  Yuck, that sucks!!   I don’t consider myself a vats player, but it’s kinda important for a pistol build.  Maybe one day they will let pistols dual wield to make up for lack of damage!  We can hope.
---
Hah, yep I’m all for fun!
---
If you can get an AAE Handmade that would be perfect.

Anti-armor only works well with fast firing low damage weapons like the minugun and against heavily armored targets, but a Gatling laser would be another good option.

I already laughed when I read or heard the word "dongle." Now it's even funnier. Thank you for that.

Agreed.  I'd love for workshops in general to be more appealing seeing as they are the last refuge of pvp on adventure mode for the most part.

Gold: granade launcher and rocket launcher
---
Purple: handmade,gauss,pole hook,laser rifle and pistol,marine armor.
---
Hot damn! This might be a reason to give it a try! Thanks!
---
Pipe revolvers benefit from Gunslinger and Rifleman perks with a rifle stock added. They're a pretty solid backup/main.
---
I would do a test run.  Just to be sure.  Even if game crashes, I still beleive you have around 5 minutes.
---
Worth a try. Thanks.

https://fo76map.com/ here’s another fan made one
---
They are shareholders and business men. Bethesda is becoming like Activision/Blizzard where they ONLY care about money. Once you give it to them, they don't give a shit about you. I'm at the point where I'll likely not buy any more of their games if this is how they are going to treat us.
---
I mean I got called “a broke bitch” on this sub for refusing to get 1st. I encountered a lot of people on PS4 the first week it was out, who essentially told me the same thing. Thats why I’m on strike until wastelanders. Sure, maybe its a minority of assholes, but they do exist, and they’re toxic AF. The whole experience made me swear off online games for a while.
---
Just because its not part of your everyday experience, doesn’t mean it isn’t real. Like melting of the polar ice caps, or duck-billed platoipi.

---
RIP to the site though. Used it quite a bit in the early months.
---
Well, GameStop is giving an extra $5 on trade ins, and that is definitely tempting. That's definitely more than I'll ever get for FO 76 from anywhere else. Paid like 14 bucks and I definitely got my money's worth, but I'm just so tired of the constant disappointment. I keep telling myself that the game will turn around like Battlefront 2 or Siege, but it's evident Beth is just milking what they can get from whatever playerbase is left. 
---
I would be playing Wastelanders now, but that got pushed back and instead we get FO1st, I don't even know if we're getting Wastelanders it at this point. There's been so much damage caused, especially the FO1st controversy and the silence from the devs. Do you think that has helped the game sell copies? If it is actually released, Wastelanders better be amazing, but as evident with vault raids, we're probably going to get a broken buggy mess that won't ever get patched (we still have the 250 dmg resist bug that's been broken for over a year).
---
Now we have Beth targeting a die-hard fan who made a community resource that many people used. And honestly, I don't think they even care. They only care about the people who spend hundreds on the game for cosmetics and subscriptions, while ignoring the majority of the playerbase. But when the playerbase leaves and even the income from the whales start to decline to the point where servers can't be sustained, they'll have no one to blame. Servers will be shut down and people will have nothing to show for the hundreds they've spent.
---
Same here, it happens on my private server as well (bought the month as a test)
---
My day to day with my stealth sniper build is with my instigating lever action.  I pull 1600+ headshots with it using common .45 ammo.  It one shots most enemies.  Then for the occasional tanks you ruin into, I go with AA handmade.
---
One month later: "Start public events on your private server with fallout first!"
---
I run a power armor / bloodied build the power armor is the strangler heart power armor with emergency protocol mod I use bloodied fixer or a quad laser rifle.
---
I hate to be that 76er but... seems a bit rushed doesn’t it?
---
It's pretty much the industry standard; yea.
---
Amazing!
---
I can confirm this, dropped loot in a container, logged out back to main menu, game crashed to desktop (Xbox), heart sank, logged back in with alt, same world, items were still there! Root Toot!
---
That looks fair,
---
Maybe it was one of those accounts that was suspended, they released it and then realized it was a booboo and resuspended it.
---
&gt; the players were supposed to be the vendors / quest givers / and role players 
---
I really don't understand why people even remotely think this. There are literally no mechanics or systems for this to happen. Apart from the vendor crap I suppose but that was added later.
---
If you have 2 accounts you can do any transfer imaginable without needing 1st in any way.  What makes you think you need 1st for this?
---
Sent and Cav armor have completely different effects.  Sent reduces dmg standing still, and Cav reduces dmg while moving (jumping).
---
My pistol playthrough my non legendary pipe revolver did about 25+ more damage than my lever action, and with way less vats cost. Pipe revolvers are a hidden gem.
---
theres a lot of things being done atm when it comes to this specific topic. finally got unsuspended after the long haul of working with it.
---
Those two will never post again unless it's in reply to a fallout 1st owner. This is fact.
---
i guess again it depends on the actual weapons you want to use, it sounds like you enjoy the action of getting into the fray, so id recommend automatic weapons with +1 agilty to keep you mobile and maybe faster fire rate to deal out wasteland justice with extreme prejudice, also good centenders would be increased VATS accuracy if you use VATS at all (can can couple that with VATS critical meter fills 15% faster )
---
for armor, it sounds like you are on the right track with vanguards prefix and sentiel/cav pieces,a nd since oyu like to get up int he middle of a fight, maybe use some autostim pieces to keep you alive if you dont take that perk card
---
and again id suggest +1 agility on armor so you can be "upwardly mobile" lol
---
they don't give a shit about you dumb shits who keep throwing money into this shit
---
My bad. I should have said two profiles. Sorry.
---
My #1, "if I only got to keep 1" gun (for my HW build).   
---
\*\* Instigating Gatling, with 25% Faster fire. Can basically snipe with it because of high base Gatling dmg and Instigating (particularly good if you can get headshots). It might have a 3rd star, but I don't remember what it is.   
---
FFR keeps it viable after first shot drop off. Works great with VATS or out. Lightweight ammo, doesn't chew through the ammo like a min gun, spin up is quick. One shots low level mobs easily, still effective on high DR mobs while using Stabilized. I use Adrenaline, Bloody mess, Tenderizer and suppressor perks in addition to Stabilized for maximum fun. :)
---

---
Also your little comparison with the purchase of a car is completely off and misleading. If the price of the gift card was as much as the value of the car itself no car dealer is going to reimburse you for the car. Very weak comparison.
---
Finally your extensive use of swear words throughout the entire article makes it so sad to read.
---
I would agree with this.  I am mostly an auto rifle build so I lean heavily on vampire and AA weapons.  Handmades, Combat Rifles, and Railway Rifles specifically.  I also think the explosive effect attached those prefixes works wonders along with FFR.  I’m not as concerned about reload speed as Ground Pounder perk can help you there.
---
Yes please return it back to how it originally was, let us trigger the start of the event. I've been asking for this since they changed it, it was my go to event and overall a great endgame event for high level players to challenge themselves with. Please BGS just do it.

u/ladydevann Mind commenting on this instead of keeping your heads buried in the sand pretending that everything is fine?

The real problem here is that publishers who don't act this way are becoming more and more rare, they're basically the exception now, and with them signing contracts with more team of developers, the future of AAA videogames is not exactly bright.
---
Harpoon does have quad I know I have one with fletchettes and explosive effect.  It’s bad to the bone.
---
I know that.
---
Anti-armor suffers from diminishing returns. If you have a 50% AA Gatling Laser, that means you ignore 50% of the DR or ER of your enemy. However, if you couple that with a 45% AA effect from Stabilized, you get (1 - (1- 0.5) \* (1 - .45)) =  72.5% armor penetration, not 95%. Furthermore, most enemies in the game don't actually have obscene amounts of DR/ER so raw damage bonuses often provide more damage than anti-armor; exceptions may be in PvP with people running around with 500 DR/ER and the Scorchbeast Queen who has 300/300.
---
The sole exceptions I can think of are pistols since they lack armor penetration in Perks and melee/unarmed since you can "replace" the Incisor perk if you are short on Strength/need Blocker or Traveling Pharmacy, but even then Bloodied/Junkie's/etc would typically serve you better.
---
I'd highly suggest seeking one of the following prefixes depending on your preferred weapon:
---
\- Semi-auto Rifles: Instigating (one shot kills, especially with Sneak Attacks), Bloodied, Junkie's, and if a non-PA stealth build Executioner's (Sneak Attacks are like a built-in Instigating, so Executioner's will finish off tougher enemies). Limb damage is actually pretty decent especially for staggers and cripples, but explosive tends to be most sought after for raw damage, and faster fire rate for something like a lever-action.
---
\- Automatic Rifles: Bloodied, Junkie's; Vampire's as a backup rifle to reduce reliance on Stimpaks. Explosive and faster fire rate help with staggering with Tank Killer, crippling with Tormentor.
---
\- Big Guns: Furious, Bloodied, Junkie's; Vampire's if you just want to tank. Explosive, faster fire rate and/or Gatling Plasma's splitter mod help with crippling and staggering with One Gun Army.
---
\- Shotguns: Instigating, Bloodied, Junkie's, even Furious since each pellet stacks the effect; Vampire's if you want to focus only on crippling and tanking. Limb damage is actually good on shotguns especially paired with Enforcer, but explosive is typically preferred and faster fire rate is best for combat shotguns.
---
\- Pistols: I have no insight into them and they seem to be in a bad spot anyway.
---
I think OP read this post - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dthe7w/map76_officially_closed_creator_gives_explanation/ and has poorly paraphrased how the individual mentioned in that thread was banned for reproducing and reporting an exploit.
---
I *almost* feel some sympathy for you, since you actually provided something valuable to the community of this game, but if you have been critiquing this game and still bought in Fallout 1st, you're still just supporting everything they're doing and ultimately part of the problem, so I can't exactly feel for you entirely.
---
Either way, to anybody reading, what companies do with their packages and services is not new at all.  When it comes to premium services like this, they usually offer additional things like a digital currency not for *your* benefit.  Having a digital currency allows them to make stipulations that their service is non-refundable because it includes digital currency that can be spent on things, and that effectively allows all sales to be final regardless whether the customers are satisfied.

Look through reddit it is not a great literary art. I only wanted the assholes to see past it as a literal fact and see it as clearly what I wrote several times my opinion and see the various points and perhaps instead of fan boying out offer some reasons why Bethesda hasn't given up on Fo76 and I haven't seen one.
---
Cool story bro
---
This would be a lot funnier if it wasn't true.
---
Fallout 76 is rapidly running out of time to make a come back. Next year new consoles come out and a wave of new games between then and after that. If 76 doesn't establish a foothold soon there will be little chance of new players and returning players finding reason to choose 76.
---
Wastelanders is a real make or break moment for many of us. The instability and bugs for a premium service on an already infamous game is not a good sign of things to come that aren't paid for.
---
My best suggestion for finding Graham and Chally is to stop looking for them and not need them for anything.  Sounds stupid but it's true I swear.   Now that I don't need him for anything outside of meatweek and I am just waving to him I see him like every other day.
---
I spose I could suggest just finding somewhere to server hop that's close to his path and hop, wait a few minutes to see if he comes by, then server hop again.
---
Alternately just walk his route.  This works 100% of the time if you have the time lol
---
Somebody is mad his exploits are getting patched.
---
Your question makes it sound like all other weapons have no drawbacks at all  :-p   but yeah to answer your question: I was exaggerating when I said an hour, it's more like a couple of hours most probably. I can kill half the creatures on the server in that time. Killing them with something else could conserve more ammo than the 10mm... And take much longer.
---
These are some very sweet details and well written. Thank you! I may use both Vampire’s and AA.
---
What is scarp?
---
Welllll I'm an obsessive hoarder so what I meant was not having double the amount of things to repair was cool lol.
---
Considering Bethesda does not perform individual investigations and only uses algorithms, it’s just luck of the draw.  You had some combination of numbers that the algorithm did not like.
---
No one compromised your account.  You can buy keys for $3.75 and level 100 accounts for like $20.  There is no value to the game unless you had single click purchasing enabled and what exactly would be point?  Black hats do not waste time, the skillset generates money, and Fo76 is worthless.
---
And weirdly, it will be the only time you ever play the game when her door will be closed.
---
Sooooo hard to do.
---
Yeah, I decided to level up my level 20 alt, and seeing it trigger is...triggering? Like, hey, I wish I could do that, but I'd get squished and get low level drops.
---
This is isn't phrased right. The person who was banded admitted to *using* the exploit/bug, *then* they reported it. They were banned after using the exploit/bug. Not defending Bethesda for throwing down the ban hammer, but this is spreading misinformation.
---
Spreading more misinformation, great.  That’s been the story of this whole game, ruined by shitty clickbait you tubers who have no clue what they are talking about
---
Guess you just have to get fucked hard enough to see the truth
---
Beth: "communicate with us! Let us know about bugs and exploits!"
---
Community: *does that*
---
Beth: "You fool! You fell for one of the classic blunders!" *bans community and ignores everyone*
---
Camelot unchained. Made by gamers. Funded mostly by gamers. Still being developed because they had to create their own game engine from scratch (Unreal Engine is in everything even today) to tolerate the scale of pvpvp going down. Highly recommend giving it some attention if you’re looking for a good game
---
I can’t grasp why anyone still played this shit game. 
---
Bethesda will never learn its lesson if people still keep on sucking their balls and gifting them money for useless in game currency in a full price AAA title....
---
Came here to ask the same.
---
Reread it as sarcastic, and it still reads as you not being happy someone gave you a bunch of free stuff, sorry.
---
Bethesda is impersonal, everything is automated replies, even banning is done by an algorithm.
---
I agree with you there
---
\#hotcakes
---
Those were the days...
---
Yes, and if that had brought in the numbers they were looking for, we might have only needed to deal with that level of BS. It's obvious it didn't, so here we are.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again, IF YOU ARE STILL INSISTING ON WASTING YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS CLUSTERFUCK GAME YOU DESERVE TO GET RIPPED OFF. Period.
---
I hope everyone that continues to support this game gets progressively more cheated, deceived, and disrespected by Bethesda.
---
Inside the Vault lately has just become a place for Bethesda to inform us about promised features and fixes that have been pushed ahead, an event that only lasts 5 or 10 minutes that happens every hour.
---
I'm still waiting for Inside the Vault to be a place where Bethesda tells us about how they're working on requested community features/content that will be added *free* to the next available update that aren't just Atomic Shop bait.
---
So rather than be mad at the game company for releasing a terrible game you want to be upset at this guy? Nice priorities.
---
I guess that’s why I prefer my combat shotguns....better range. Thx for the info
---
I member
---
Can confirm. Bought the wrong dlc coded item for fallout 3 on ps3 (hard to explain all i know is i didnt get what i paid for) when i was younger, asked my mom to call them for me and they pmuch just told her to f off and that i wasnt getting the money refunded to buy the correct item from the digital store.
---
I call bullshit.  Ive reported a ton of bugs and have never been banned.
---
The only people they ban are cheaters and dupers and I would bet a million dollars whoever got banned was one of them.
---
 Take your fake news and fuk off.
---
They were making sure the exploit was real to report it as such, and not make Bethesda waste their time with an exploit that didn't even work.
---
Careful with the shills, man.
---
Breaks are a good thing, yes, but the limited time Halloween event that drops unique outfits and legendary weapons is inaccessible to players with this 'glitch" because the game is fully unplayable. Totally locked out.
---
Hit detection for melee and unarmed in Fallout 4 and 76 in general is just very janky and awkward.  It's not nearly as responsive as it was in Fallout 3/NV, which is saying a lot because those two games had their own weird melee quirks, but nothing as strange as the last two games.
---
Yeah I know, I read the post. Sucks that they got banned for trying to help
---
No, I didn't get banned, though they did hit many of the data miners, bug/exploit reporters, etc...
---
Totally agree. So tired trying to do the event and it ends up being me and 1 other person. Event fails.. Time wasted. I think having ut like sbq and encryptid where u have to trigger something is wise
---
It does suck indeed.
---
Chargebacks and this aren't even close to the same thing.  Chargebacks will get you banned from virtually everything.  I used to work for wireless carriers and chargebacks could actually get them to cancel your phone service and charge you a cancellation free.    
---
The only time you do a chargeback is if it's absolute fraud, and you have no problems never doing business with that company ever again.
---
I read through this whole thing thinking, “Why does he keep going to Beth? Why doesn’t he talk to someone else at the company?”
---
I wouldn’t judge too hard. I’ve logged into my account on eBay and ended up in someone else’s account before.. I understand it’s a different concept than a game, but strange things happen..
---
That stash limit and the incessant over-encumbrance cured my obsessive hoarding.
---
Just once.   
---
Got teamed up with someone in NW match that instantly started ranting about "we should boycott Bethesda" and wanted to "punch anyone wearing a Fallout 1st outfit". "Hey come punch this guy, he's got a Fallout 1st outfit on". I blocked and muted him. It was weird.   
---
Such a colossal waste of time + misunderstanding of what "boycott" means.
---
It's a steep hill.
---
I have a lot of ts explosive guns and its all nerfed. I simply resolved this problem by uninstalling fo76 and playing outer worlds instead
---
Nope, have not gotten it back. Just a ticket &amp; a promise that we will be getting an “assortment” of scrap back at some point &amp; would be notified......
---
Gold is also the nuclear briefcase
---
u/Eckserah has been very patient with this, and overall it doesn't look good when multiple dataminers get banned at the same time, hopefully it will all get straightened out before long
---
It adds something like \~12% damage.  Up to you if you think that's worth it or not.  
---
also makes any other explosive better.
---
+1 for surprise pounding from behind.
---
Nope.
---
&gt; An exploit was leaked about a month ago on an obscure forum. We discovered it, **BOLD** tested to make sure it was real...
---
Big mistake
---
TIL
---
I can dig up the math, but yes, the diminishing returns make the perk absolutely useless for buffing legendary explosive effect damage.
---
Someone told me to use the dead body in the same area as Vault 76 as a container.  It works, I have traded between my characters 20 plus times now since the introduction of private sessions.  As always, there is a risk.  One time, I tried to log back in and it took almost 2 minutes for the same session for my mule account.  I was able to get my stuff, just started to get really nervous.  You have around 5 minutes before the current session transitions to a new session.
---
When will Obsidian buy the Fallout franchise
---
Who would have thought this game would go down the toilet? Oh right. Everyone except this fucking sub and all the dumb shits in it.
---
I was not hit, but several of the key Dataminer's were, which surprised us.  
---
Hopefully it will get straightened out shortly, as some of us have been trying to get the issue resolved for those involved.
---
releasing a broken, buggy dlc isn't going to make anything better.
---
Good luck because tow will last two weeks
---
Several of the dataminers were, they've been silent out of respect as the issue gets sorted.
---
Gotcha.  I've only heard 1 or 2 passing comments while playing (not NW), but it didn't fall nearly into what I'd call abuse or harassment. I'm (somewhat) convinced that this whole class war is more isolated incidents and overblown 'reporting', and less of an actual problem...but I only have my own experience to gauge it by.  
---
I tend to dismiss overhyped posts and usually dismiss clickbait articles (if you couldn't already tell that from my language).
---
He wasn't banned for data-mining, someone reported an exploit to them and they verified it was real before sending it to Bethesda.  Bethesda then banned them for the exploit that they literally reported.    
---
I work in software myself, it's basically obligatory for someone when they put in a support ticket for them to at least attempt to explain how to replicate the problem.  This is a nonsense ban that shows there aren't any humans behind the helm at Bethesda's public relations and customer/technical support department.  I used to deal with these kinds of hamfisted management decisions in shit-tier companies and it's amazing that a company this large could be staffed entirely by amateurs.
---
Really is.
---
People like this guy is who they need to not only apologize to about the fuck ups but offer him a free bit of Fallout 1st after refunding his cash.
---
The level of fuck up this is is honestly astounding.
---
ohhh I'm a lesser reporters, brutal!  
---
I did not, but several of the key dataminers were.
---
Don't you mean trash tier
---
What we dont know is how bethesda differentiates between 'finding a bug' and 'using a bug'
---
If you found a bug, how many times will bethesda allow for you to attempt to recreate it before reporting it?
---
Personally, adding a monthly subscription for atoms would be pointless because you can already buy atoms whenever you want. Having the subscription give free monthly atoms plus any additional stuff (such as cosmetics) and paying for a private server was a good idea. However, I will say that the scrap boxes and tent should just be available to everyone
---
And clearly everyone buys it too. Dude is using personal reasons to weaponize the community. He isn't being forced to close his website down, right? He closed it to bring attention to what happened to him in hopes Bethesda unbans him.
---
And I'm not mad at anyone, website owner wants to make yall mad at Bethesda for something he has control over. The dude is holding his website and the community hostage because he can't get a refund.
---
When did they mention a timeframe?  All I recall was it will be launching on Steam, I don't remember Bethesda ever mentioning it would be this year.
---
Blows my mind that Sony is as good as they are and that Spencer was able to get Microsoft's heads out of their asses.
---
If your mod discovers an exploit they'll ban you.    
---
Also, considering Fallout 1st, I wouldn't think for a second that when mods do come, they'll either require fallout 1st or make them paid mods like they tried with skyrim.
---
**IT! JUST! WORKS!**
---
Pretty sure the pump action is blue tier.
---
I didn’t get my flux back but after putting a few tickets in, they did give me a wide variety of scrap items. I can’t tell you what and how much as my scrap box already had loads in.
---
Bethesda is welcome to come here and explain.   Their silence tells you everything you need.
---
He’s right, nobody can truly form your opinion for you. 
---
Just be careful with how much you spend and keep your expectations low. The majority of players feel the way they do for a reason.
---
That’s simply not true. Please show me a TOS that explicitly bans data mining.
---
Now i understand. And you guys keep attacking me beacuse i decided to stay here only for drama with bethesda and good Laughts. Im done XD! Now i will say it: CALLED IT! TOLD YOU HA!
---
I just tested with my BE Handmade on a couple of scorched. Without Demolition, the damage was 414 and 18. With Demo 4 it was 414 and 40. Is that worth the perk points? It's up to you.
---
wow so hostile. Your whole post history is just taking the piss out of everyone you can find.
---
You'll get a husband in no time, trust me.
---
Not hard to believe at all that the game that created the paid horse armor DLC for Oblivion and tried to institute paid mods in Skyrim would do this.
---
Whats prices would you put against that list?
---
I have no clue how Bethesda Support even operates this well, tbh.
---
There's absolutely no fluidity to it, it's done solely over old school email, and there's a new support person replying every time so there's no continuity leaving you to explain everything again in every email.
---
can I have your stuff?
---
Probably got caught up when he was verifying an exploit, not terribly surprising that could happen.
---
I like the guy, there's a few people I've interacted with about mapping and data mining that I've gotten really good vibes from.  He was definitely one of those.  I don't assume anything nefarious there, but 'verifying' an exploit is a dangerous thing to do.
---
Never was, never will be
---
about time gamers learn they're just cash cows.
---
NW wasn't a terrible idea but it's a glitchy mess, has massive lag issues, and is full of hackers.  
---
Execution has been about a 2/10 and it does suck because they easily have stuck a ton of development resources into it.
---
No, I just like to call out stupidity when I see it.
---
 I appreciate you taking an interest in my post history though!
---
 I don't much need a husband, I have a beautiful wife ;) Thanks though!
---
Yes and bethesda don't even bother to check this game in smalles point.. Leave this crap while you cab
---
I feel bad for what those two have to put up with.
---
They really do need something big to make a comeback.
---
2 months was all I could take of the gameplay loop, and even then I have so many questions:
---
-why is every nuke silo the exact same fight?
---
-why doesn’t every region have its own unique ‘nuke’ boss?
---
-why are these giant bat dragons so damn annoying and not dropping loot?
---
-how did that person kill me with a shotgun from 200 meters?
---
-how did half these enemy NPCs make it through testing?
---
-how did I overfill my stash box and why am I over-encumbered after my first time logging back in after months?
---
-why are all the bullet sponge enemies limited to flying creatures?
---
 -did they think they were going to get away with importing so many digital assets from FO4? We played the shit out of that game, how in the world did you think it would be wise to release a title that rehashed all those tired, generic weapons?
---
0, unless they are feeling generous.  If you cheat, they are allowed to have 0 tolerance.
---
I like the guy, I think he needs to be reinstated, but I don't blame Bethesda for their actions, short-sighted as they may be.
---
No need for a reagent, just roll it back to pre patch where it just had it's own timer and entering the area triggered the quest :)
---

---
I like to grab as many frames as I can and leave them in a friend's camp. (all lined up like soldiers, or decorating random spots).
---
&gt;private worlds not being private at all
---
This is kind of a funny and also spooky thing to discover, source?
---
*You* were suspended, too? Fucking hell.
---
no snarky comments here, just genuine concern, you seem so angry... 
---
and it sounds like you hate the actual players whoa re still playing the game as well...
---
honestly, no snark intended, you should seek help if you are so upset over a video game.
---
maybe try spending time with friends/family instead?  get a new hobby, one where you actually ENJOY what you are doing?
---
If it does. (I think it won't) It will be like Skyrim. Regulated and Taxed.
---
Hopefully the issue will be sorted out shortly
---
1) bethesda is a company,if this isnt blown out  by all those “gaming news” youtubers they really dont need to bring attention to it
---
2)their silence could mean multiple things such as not even knowing that this is 
---
3) bethesda as an entity did not ban him, whoever controls the cheating or exploit monitoring did
---
and i really doubt they would be “welcome here”
---
That got away from you there..
---
juice and nthapple are the only ones I can stomach watching anymore..
---
The direction was *probably* going to be different than what it is, but the expansion was planned probably before release.  They (again, probably) ended up rewriting a lot of it to add people to the mix.
---
It's also possible they've always intended to add people in at this point, and are just *saying* that it's a result of feedback, but I don't know if I'd believe it was that much of a conspiracy.
---
I have had fun had a guy just give me so very cool loot yesterday after not playing for almost a year but I also have a crash every single day some so bad my ps4 has to be unplugged.  I have not decided if I am renewing my ps+ I paid 120 for this game and was cheated IMHO I have had some fun times but more fun with a 20 buck game than this 60+60 game I have gotten a few good games from ps+ but I wish they gave us choice or credit if we owned the game
---
\*that shows up is fraudulent plagiarized footage of bugs at launch.  I don't even remember the last time I saw a T-Pose.
---
That's honestly the worst part. Same thing with Battlefront. If EA/Activision/Bethesda/Ubi want to crank out some dogshit game and make horrible monetization decisions with it, good for them. The problem is that these games are often really good underneath all of the bugs, cash grabs, and shitty management.
---
Do you not get atoms from subscribing monthly already?
---
Smart thing would be to backpetal and fix his accounts but they won't as majority of the time they don't backpetal instead they ignore it like they did with Fallout 1st.
---
It makes the game easier to play. There are people who may have gotten frustrated and quit if they didn't have that map. Instead they continued to play and potentially bought Atoms or the subscription.
---
Tools like this can indirectly lead to a lot of revenue. Game companies that actually know what they're doing treat developers like this very, very well. In some cases they will even compensate them somehow or even invite them to come work for them or act as a consultant because of how much value they add to the game.
---
I already quit the game. Have not played basically since NW came out. Why haven't you guys stopped playing yet?
---
Its not that they are purposely banning innocent data miners. If you were detected with or used cheat engine, ye got the boot.
---
the stupid part is that you gotta be closer to the enemy to hit them than they have to be to you when they hit you
---
Can't remember where it was said but I've read that Bethesda is trying to go public... so they're looking to fleece anyone who will give them money to show they have as much revenue as possible.. Think we all know where this is going lol
---
So is Bethesda still banning players by picking at random again?
---
I don't really deal with these things but most of them are trade only, and I see people tend to ask for other outfits for trade.
---
You might find people selling a Forest Scout Mask, Dense mod plan, or Hunter's Longcoat for below 10k though, if you are lucky.
---
Cringe
---
Thanks for the tips
---
InnovSurvivalist!
---
Juicehead is a bit more even handed these days, I still enjoy watching his stuff.  Innovsurvivalist (sp?), Rifle gaming, captainnoob, finalrender are a few other ones I've got on my list as well.
---
Same here. I stopped playing the beginning of the summer just because it was summer- I still had fun with the game and planned on coming back once the kids were back in school. I haven't felt a huge urge to get back to it and honestly there seems to be a change in the way this community is feeling about the game and that isn't really pushing me to play again. For all the shit people gave this game since the day it came out this subreddit was generally positive and kept my hopes up for it getting better. It's hard to feel that way anymore.
---
Looks like you got downvoted for having human emotions lol. People like to blame those two for everything when really, they're just the community's punching bag anytime something undesirable happens. Totally agree with you though
---
i think this is an attempt at satire -  or maybe not
---
Well I do know a player on Twitch, Sabahe, he is on PC and he does nice auctions, trades, and he looks like jesus.
---
Tl;Dr:
---
Guy who got scammed and was continually being scammed finally realized he got scammed.
---
You were hellah late to therealization, but I'm glad to have you on the right side now.
---
Just how I feel about people with hundreds of hours in the game crying they got ripped off and demanding refunds
---
Because we are better than simple numbers in their stats ? Because we aren’t CORPORATE ? Because we care about people and the franchise despite Bethesda clearly don’t giving a crap ?
---
Well to be fair they wanted it that way. Whole point of Fallout 76 is to be a live service game where modders can't add stuff and that includes fixes. Still reloading my Lever Action Rifle on Fallout 4 like a chump with 5 bullets everytime because its still broken and if I use mods I lose access to achievements.
---
Pay it forward.
---
Do I detect sarcasm?
---
once you start eating lunch its still lunch till you stop no matter what time it is.
---
Darthsithiss.
---
Though that guy just posts random funny and weird stuff.
---
No commentary or discussion on any topic at hand or any  current issue, not are any opinions given.
---
Excellent!

Melee is op in general. I have a level 37 character with a super sledge and I can take on 3-4 level 62 ghouls witout much of a problem.

Ive been superstitious about those fucking gnomes since 3.

 NukaCrypt had one? Mind passing the link?
---
I've had really good luck spawning south of sunshine meadows at the hot dog place. And running north across the bridge towards the workshop.
---
I saw one and only one of her videos, couldn't stand it.
---
Here's something intelligent: they exactly know how much money they make and this will be the basis of their future decisions :) not your crying
---
I used to defend this game to the death. I was always a fiercly loyal Bethesda fanboy and I really loved Fallout 76. I had been playing since the moment the first beta became live.
---
After the Fallout 1st BS, I went from playing constantly to just having no desire. I'm not really that outraged, or sad, or anything, just all of my desire is gone, and the time I did play a few days ago, it just kind of seems like the magic is gone. It's hard to get into a game run by a company that  treats its fan base like that. Especially it being Bethesda who I always thought was great at connecting with its player base. 
---
It kind of feels like your old fun step dad suddenly started ignoring you and treating you like shit and you don't know or understand why.
---
Pressing enter key instead of clicking helps
---
I feel that way about the people who make Fallout 76 videos but show Outer Worlds footage the whole video. Just make fucking outer worlds content for crying out loud.
---
You are paying for those worthless Atoms, they are not free. You also pay them for a seperated word limited only to you, which means "Open World MMO" isn't a criteria this game offers to you anymore. Any yeah you are right, silly simple game mechanics that are already in the game since fallout 4 (workshop settlement inventory) should be a thing that is avaiable for everyone, but think it through from a different perspective. They limited the storage, because they wanted to make money with it later on through a subscription. And yes they got what they wanted. Selling Bugs as Features monthly...
---
I think it should not be call a diminishing return because the perk damage only diminishes once.
---
Were Ina wealthy lad, I'd award this comment
---
Lol, nope
---
All it does is set up a resource that helps people play and in the end helps ensure Bethesda gets more money for a broken game there by rewarding them. Fuck that. If Bethesda can't give a damn neither should we
---
It’s pops up everyday for me, as soon as I log in.
---
When i click the fb page all i get is the thumbs up logo with a bandage tied around it.
---
Is this directly related to fallout 76
---
gamerZsoul is good
---
Chargebacks are supposed to be a last resort if the merchant refuses to refund your money, or the main option if your card has been stolen and fraudulent purchases have been made. They're not supposed to be the first thing you do.
---
So you bought something knowing what it was, spent the currency they gave you and still expected a refund? Seriously? This world is just so entitled these days. You people are pathetic. How the fuck are you gonna spend the atoms and then still expect a refund?
---
I read the post, damn Bethesda.
---
Other than nerd rage for bloodied, stabilized if you're using PA and maybe gunsmith... What else is there in intelligence that's worth using but demolition expert?
---
Captainoob for weapons
---
People literally do this as a hobby to verify bugs and exploits so they can forward the information on to the developers.
---
I deleted this game and the launcher weeks ago and I'd advise everyone else does the same, if you're really upset about it. I gave up trying to give Bethesda/Zenimax the benefit of the doubt in some of the older issues. Nowadays? They're just showing their true colors. "Fuck the fans and the people who play, it's all about the money!'
---
Never again. And posts like this just solidify that fact for me.
---
Wow! Ok so trying to use it on your phone is probably a no go.
---
I see him a bunch on the road at the acid workshop in the toxic valley.
---
Is it while moving or just while sprinting? I thought sentinal was the one that had people jumping to move while still counting as "standing still". I've got 2/5ths of an Unyielding/Cavaliers heavy combat armor set and I've been sure to always be sprinting to try to get the damage reduction, but my guys tanky enough that I probably wouldn't be able to notice either way. If it's just moving I can probably start doing SBQ with my health around 20%
---
You're the triggered one sweetheart, it's why you responded, I only responded to clarify things darling.
---
He must be talking about some diner in Bethesda, Maryland.
---
TIL.  Thanks for humoring me.  For some reason I always thought no matter how you dropped PA, it would recall.
---
Wait for meat week 3
---
Weapon, not wapon. Legendaries, not legendarys
---
Lvl 81 yet to get anything with explosive on it.
---
I payed full price for the game specifically cuz I wanted to support the idea and development. But it's course thus far has been a train that keeps going off it's rails and doing things we were told it wouldn't rather than the things it needs to. So I haven't and won't be adding any money to it. No buying atoms or subsriptions for me till they start doing their jobs better.
---
Normal. I got to level 100 or so trying to make a PVP pistol character. I couldn't get anything better than a 1 star pistol, but the queen dropped me a fantastic 3 star rifle, so I changed my build for it.
---
By level 200 or so I got two more rifles replacing the first that are high to god tier imo.
---
It's normal but you're better off trading for a good one
---
Most people have decent ones they dont use because they have very good ones
---
Either try shopping around or other subreddits have traders
---
let me explain something to you. yes i used cheat engine to view the games memory, however i do not use it to exploit the mechanics of the game. my goal with what i do is to help bethesda find and fix issues with the game. I'm also a developer on xedit and help with keeping it up to date for fallout 76. the security flaw that i found was most likely already known about in the darker circles of the playerbase and would actually explain the amount of stolen accounts being sold online. after they fixed this i was checking to see if they had gotten everything and thats when i ended up getting suspended pending investigation. this took 13 days and multiple tickets among other things to be able to get resolved. People like me and those in my group are what you would call white hat hackers. we may do things like use third party tools to be able to see whats going on with the game but we dont exploit that knowledge we instead pass it on to the community managers which we have direct contact to.
---
some of us do want the game to continue on and part of that is making known the hows and whys of whats going on with exploits and bugs. debugging is not easy on something like this and figuring out why a specific thing happens only when done a specific way is what i do. im a programmer, reverse engineer, and a dedicated bug hunter and will continue to do so no matter what.
---
This.  If you're going to talk about a game and give your opinion please provide footage of you regularly playing the game so we can see what your opinion is based off of and not just one game mode the majority of the player base doesnt play.
---
Totally helpful response.
---
Unfortunately they is so many things in fo76 that doesn’t work as advertised 😔
---
Captainoob. Duh.
---
I got my decent weapons from the purveyor. Scrip all those random drops and go roll for better gear.
---
Useful is a wide range of things, and could mean different things to different people.
---
I had a 'useful' rifle around the time I turned 50, and didn't get a better one for ~100 levels.  It was a 1 star (instigating), and it served me quite well.  I eventually got a 'better' one with 3 stars, and was disappointed that it made very little difference.
---
What exactly are you looking for?  What build, weapon type.  Are you trying to use VATS a lot, are you looking for a trash weapon or a queen killer?  Are you trying to go sneak?  If you're doing rifles, are you doing auto or semi-auto?
---
All those will make a difference in what a 'good' weapon means.
---
Blindly accept shit from Bethesda will get you what you deserve, don't bitch about it and next time think twice before you buy something from them.
---
Level 118 on 1 char and 49 at another. Only 2 good finds both happen to be BE. Other than those they were all Pretty bad

Many A True Nerd is good with the other Fallout games, but he doesn't care much for '76.
---
I remember I ended up with meat in my inventory all the time. I never knew where it came from, but I was happy to eat it. Then I heard they changed the quest and I was like, oh
---
From what I understand, he used a cheat engine to detect the bug.  The detecting and reporting of the bug may have been noble on his part, but having a cheat engine on the account is what got him whacked.
---
My Vampire+SS Pitchfork. Dead serious. It outheals everything and still one shots almost every enemy once you have one stack of adrenaline and low health with adrenal. Most resource friendly weapon I've used, and the swing speed allows me to kill packs of ghouls without getting touched (unless the game bugs out and doesn't register melee damage).
---
Only drawback is it doesn't do as much damage as bloodied, but I have plenty of those too. I use this weapon for 90% of PvE content.
---
I would just do a chargeback on my card if that shit happened.
---
They cant add people in a game about a new world expedition, filled with players as the npcs. The game would be somehow extremly overloaded. A MMO with progression is something very rare. Something like Wow isnt common anymore. IF Beth is even doing this. All i have seen in the Trailer are generic Preston Garvey Settlers. It somehow makes sense that all those wastelanders that survived somehow are not going to waste time in a scorched beast infested enviroment or died through the pest-like sickness. Thats the part what makes Wastelanders maybe playable. To find out why all those npcs are coming back to this territory. The first reason is of course because all vault dwellers defeated the scorched queen etc etc.
---
This makes me sad :(
---
GamerMomOver50 and WickedChickady are two that I enjoy
---
You know, I would have said that about his videos a couple of months ago but lately if it isnt a patch for NW he approves of it feels like he just resorts to the doom and gloom reporting every other youtuber does chasing those dollars.  Think I liked him more when it was less a job and more just something he really loved doing.
---
This reminds me of the time a Responder Fireman with a Flame Thrower equipped came by my camp and wanted to sell fire insurance. It was back when camps could still be attacked. I gave him 50 caps in insurance money and he left me an insurance note (You Have Been Insulted), and then he left. 
---
Man, the wonderful people we meet in this game.
---
&gt; An exploit was leaked about a month ago on an obscure forum. We discovered it, **tested to make sure it was real**, and reported it directly to the community managers. 
---
"We knowingly and deliberately used an exploit." When you hear about a potential exploit, you and your buddies aren't supposed to verify it works before you report it.
---
Nope, Wastelanders was always on the the road map.
---
It's sheer luck with a low probability.    
---
My best advice: try to earn 150 scrip per day and spend it when you are close to capping out at 1k.  Try to earn 1400 caps per day until you have at least 25k total caps saved up, then bounce to player vendors every time you log on and switch to a new server and try again before you log off.  
---
Eventually you'll find something decent either from the legendaries you find farming for scrip, the purveyor, or player vending.    
---
You want that 25k caps as that's the maximum someone can charge for an item in player vending and a god tier weapon is worth that amount.
---
In Soviet USA lunch buffet eat you
---
I can't believe they gave us possibly the most OP weapon/legendary combo as a survival reward **twice!** The Unstoppable Monster is so ridiculously OP that the only thing that beats it in melee is the bloody meathook's perk double dipping.
---
I don think I pulled any god rolls until about 130.  I just hit 180 last night and maybe 5 drops would qualify.  My main is rifle still isnt top tier.
---
No, you don't lose anything with the scrap box. You can still remove existing scrap from it, but you cannot add anything new to it.
---
As far as stacking is concerned I'd hope the service is smart enough to just add \~30 days to whatever your current expiration date is for each month purchased.
---
The fire rate on a hunting rifle is trash. I'd call that a downside.
---
its About 34 dollars for a 2 gig a month  mobile plan 99+ for unlimited.  My internet is like 84 bucks and is 400 down / 15 up.
---
Doesn't seem like that to me, though honestly I think I'm more in the 'doom and gloom' camp lately, so maybe it's just bothering me less.  He definitely seems to have stopped seeming sensationalist, and when he reports problems the description seems more honest than clickbaity.
---
I predict almost none. "Content creators" have a massively inflated sense of their importance to a community.
---
People like you and who upvoted this bullshit comment are partly the reason why Blizzard, Sony, etc ban you forever for chargbacks. Not only you misunderstand what the chargeback is for, you pretend you know you do and advise others to abuse it.
---
Oh, I'm so sorry you feel that the community is entitled to use the tools he made and give zero shits about anything else. He spent his time and money on his project and feels like it isn't worth it anymore because of Bethesdas decisions regarding his and others' actions. Guess none of that means anything to you, you just expect him to keep it up and running forever despite it all. Really cool of you man.
---
It's his tools and his website he can do what he wants with them, but you sure sound mad because he decided to take it down after the disappointing actions of Bethesda. He wants to walk away and take his project with him? Deal with it.
---
Ignore only erased your position to him on the map.
---
I think the bigger problem is them refusing refunds for a broken/not as advertised product. They have done this numerous times with Fo76.
---
1.	The game itself was vastly different and broken from what was promised
---
2.	canvas bags
---
3.	fallout 1st is not what was advertised at all.
---

---
There were a load of maps upvoted really high made very simply with this a few months back. I used those imgur links for a ton of stuff before realizing I could do the same thing with literally anything using the nuka crypt map.
---
You can also do an item search instead of a map search to try and find the specific ID of an item like a rare piece of junk or something. 
---
I haven't used Map76 in a while, was it the one with a bunch of big icons on the map like google maps pins? It was good, but had quite a bit of inherent bloat. NukaCrypt suited my needs better.
---
Not sure why my previous comment got downvoted, probably not great talking about its competitor in its drama thread. 
---
But yeah, just saying what I've been doing and using.
---
I only pressed ignore but I couldn’t get back into my camp because he’d decided to stay in there and wait 😂 . I ended up just switching servers in the end.
---
Right you can’t see their position either. But if they know where you are they can still fuck with you.
---
As much as I enjoy the ongoing saga of shenanigans, stuff like this is upsetting.
---
oh also Sinisterhand
---
You can use it on your phone. Especially since most people will only be searching for a few specific things at a time.
---
Whaaaaaaaat. Oh I wonder what's going on! Kojima / Metal Gear Solid is one of my favourites! Gonna check Metal Gear subs, will report back if I find anything!
---
Not at all what I was talking about.  You don't seem to get the ticket if the gold card duplicates an existing red card of the same effect. It treats them as different cards. 
---
Getting a gold card that duplicates an existing gold card will indeed grant 4 tickets.
---
This makes sense to me now, thank you!
---
Let's be honest, vanity is addictive. If you create an extremely popular tool that a community praises it's difficult to believe that you'd simply shut it all down because of a minor inconvenience. Even if he was banned, it's not the end of the world. It's easier to simply buy another copy of Fallout 76 then build a large following.
---
It would probably be a fallout 1st subscriber perk. I have a feeling anything that makes life easier will be behind the paywall unless it’s more kits. Or something like the collectron. Since the subscription is basically paying for convenience and community suggested/requested things since launch
---
Oh god no. I used to run a very carefully balanced inventory in the beginning, hoarder as I am. At one point, while fleeing enemies I suddenly could not run anymore after a sudden and unexpected "over-encumbered" message and got killed. I later discovered some cans of stew in my inventory that had caused me to become over-encumbered. While it would not bother me these days, I still hate that old "surprise stew" after that incident. 
---
I have to admit, I was one of the people that bug reported it. Repeatedly.
---
It’s worth it and not worth it in the same time here’s why: it’s true that you are getting only 12% extra dmg total with 5sp but there is no dmg fall off for explosions dmg with distance what makes it much more useful when fighting sb or hunting nuke cards. As well if you are already using all other dmg perks it’s the only option to boost it further, and last but not least higher intelligence equals more exp.
---
Make some friends in-game. It's definitely the way the game was meant to be played and Xbox has some built-in functions that make up for a lack of in-game social tools.
---
GT: DunwichCultist if you're looking for someone to add. I have a Mistress of Mystery build on an alt fairly close to your level. Or a couple of high level characters if you're not a big story person and want to hurry up and get to endgame content.
---
all I know is never drop into bags only containers or bodies
---
"Miner Miracles" is what you need to do to get the power armor station.  "Belly of the Beast" is how you get the UC armor. 
---
You can start the first by examining a Garrahan Mining poster.
---
I agree. What a bunch of entitlement. They alexpect a live service game to be supported for free. They want the game to get better years after its launch but dont understand that costs real money. Cosmetics only are not enough support!!!! ITS THAT SIMPLE
---
Oh yes, gold cards are not considered "duplicates," but rather premium, animated upgrades of existing standard cards.
---
So, you did exploits (admittedly), got banned for it;  ordered a product and used it (spent the atoms from it) and then tried to scam your way into a refund.  And now you're butthurt about being told no?   
---
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  
---
My dude, I hope this is a life lesson for you.  Ain't nobody here a "dumb greedy piece of shit" but yourself.
---
I've walked his route backwards multiple times.. I feel like when I start walking one, he starts on some other route.. lol. I'm just going to have to post up on one of his routes somewhere..
---
Dont forget the scorchbeasts are just skyrin dragons with a reskin.
---
What system are you on
---
Kevduit!
---
yeah long coat is usually around 4-5k
---
What backpack skin?
---
Capcom owns the Metal Gear IP, it has nothing to do with that title.
---
And yet most people here will keep paying and keep playing, allowing Bethesda to continue their scummy ways. They'll drop a comment about how awful BGS is and how this shouldn't be allowed, then go boot up fo76 and their fallout 1st server. Hope it's worth it to you people cuz it's hurting everyone else that stopped defending and paying them a year ago.
---
they have less then 10 people actualyl working on the game. its why we see a shit ton of content delys
---
yeah the pip-boy games are a pain to collect
---
Why has no one started a lawsuit yet? Lol this is getting ridiculous.
---
It also hits about 2x as hard as a handmade so............
---
Is your NW character level 100 or higher?
---
Negative Ghostrider.
---
Could this maybe be more Death Stranding content for 76 like Days Gone got you think? Personally, I’m not sure if that’s something they’d do but either way, I wonder what he’s doing there (if that actually is Bethesdas office)
---
Nope, I'm level 52.
---
I'm still running around the corner like, oh yeah there's a door there.
---
I think they're more docile in FO76. Maybe this is before they became violent, as in FO3 there are countless scenes of gruesome death involving numerous gnomes. Maybe they're biding their time. Maybe the survivors of Appalachia are where they learned to crave the flesh of man.
---
What's it selling for these days?  I'd say about $29 is a fair price for it - just don't expect it to be a smooth as Fo4 or the combat to be 1/2 as good as Fo4.
---
Hey man, just got back into it last night after not playing for a few months. 
---
Are TSE handmades still thing? I thought they all got nerfed. I have one of those as well as a TSE lever action. I spent so much time looking at all the new stuff that I didn't even fire a shot to see how they held up after all this time.
---
Last time I had to email them I told them they needed better support and I’d personally volunteer for phones and live chats if that’s what it takes. They never got back to me lmao their system is fucking useless.
---
Nah, they have that for non-ESO+ members in ESO, so I think it would be doable without connecting it to a premium here too.
---
This is an unoriginal post
---
Understandable
---
Hey buddy I can tell you a good place to get some fries to go with that salt if you want.
---
They'd have to rework/remove a bunch of skills but I'd prefer it if there was just one perk card similar to Martial Artist that covered weight reduction across all ranged weapons and gave a bonus to either reload speed or fire rate.
---
If you want something that's going to be good in just any situation you're going to want anti-armor.
---
AA weapons weather ballistic or melee (Energy works now too, but for ER not DR) work well regardless of character status, playstyle, enemy type or time of day. So long as they've got armor (and virtually everything does) you're going to be doing decent bonus damage (~130%). A specialized build (bloodied or junkies for instance) will always do more damage overall but that comes with certain other penalties to your stats and requires constant maintenance and attention. Maybe it's worth it to you. After 1,000 hours it hasn't [yet] been worth it to me.
---
On the armor, you should definitely consider a variety pack of bonuses rather than a full matching set. Chameleon is good for sneaking, cloaking less so. And weightless is great IF you're going full Sneak/Chameleon build. Auto-stim/regenerating/life saving are nice so you don't die, tho they can largely be replaced by perks -- but if you do use them to run a 'full health' build you might want to mix a Vanguard in there somewhere. That's a nice bonus. Conversely for a low health build benefits greatly from Unyielding/Bolstering.
---
I don't much recommend the enemy-specific armor, unless their sub-perks are unbeatable. And Nocturnal is pointless. Maybe one day I'll do a hardcore vampire roleplay that uses exclusively Vampire's &amp; Nocturnal weapons and armor but today is not that day.
---
He already posted about this himself
---
I actually enjoy 76 more then 4. Before someone start talking about bugs 4 isn’t better just a year ago i was trying to play it on survival difficulty and couple quests bug out and I couldn’t complete them without console command (that’s not available on survival). Finally even tho I play solo quite often ability to play with friends and making friends in game (with some help from discord😅) is a make or break for me.
---
It wasn't. Wasteland Workshop and Contraptions Workshop were item packs. Far Harbor, Automaton, and Vault-Tec Workshop were the only FO4 add-ons that had any new content.
---
You do realize a teammate can build your camp for you right?  All one would have to do is add them to the team. 
---
A friend of mine used to troll teammates by leaving a thousand (*slight* exaggeration) lawn flamingoes in their camps. I did it a few times stacking mats on a hidden spot to max out their budget.
---
I'm always game for more active friends.
---
GT: DunwichCultist. If you add I'll add back when I'm on later
---
Ok snowflake
---
Starts at about 30k+ trade
---
*zenimax
---
?
---
You have always been able to fight people in adventure, as long as they fight back.
---
Definitely not 30k.
---
They go for well over 100k, more like 150k. And normally only for trades, very rare you will find one for caps
---
So it lines up perfectly with Bethesda’s ideals then?
---
literally no evidence whatsoever that this is the case, but keep fearmongering more!
---
I still need plans from this event but since they put it on this crazy random cycle i can’t complete it, especially that I want to do it on private server that is actually much more responsive and less laggy.
---
As if this post will change anything.
---
My point still stands. They have more than weight as a downside. I would know. I use both.
---
Was that recently added or has it been a while? Because something like that might convince more people to subscribe to f1st. And since Bethesda is under pressure from Zenimax to look good and have a steady cash flow since they are in the middle of a buy out they might just add it to the perks. Wastelanders DLC and F1st was supposed to come out at the same time. But F1st was complete before the DLC and they pushed it under pressure. People inside the studio weren’t happy with how it was introduced and felt that it wasn’t the right time.
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Maybe you shouldn't have been cheating.
---
Coming to the Atomic Shop: An absurdly massive, towering backpack skin. 😂
---
Yeah, that's right. He can do what he wants with the website, and he has.
---
I'm not interested in all this outrage culture stuff. This subreddit looks for any excuse to hate Bethesda. They don't really know what they want to accomplish, they just want to be angry. I'm done being angry. 
---
Bethesda sucks in this situation, there is no arguing that. I am arguing that we shouldn't be so polarizing on this subject. There isn't always one person in the wrong and one in the right. Both people can be in the right and both can be in the wrong. I believe both sides of the story suck here. I focus on people's motivations. I believe website owner only shut down his website to draw up more public outrage in order to make Bethesda look like the bad guy in hopes of getting his account/refund.
---
I didnt actually, never play on teams, my bad.
---
Who's Spencer?
---
There are a few people who used to do this. I'm sure a few still do. 
---
Just join their world and have them add you to the team. Anything you build comes out of your inventory. You can't access anything they have stored (though you can see the budget). You can't build Atom Shop items in their camp, but are free to build any other item even if they don't have the plan unlocked themself.
---
Depends on the primary perk. If it’s something like a suppressors then it can go for pretty cheap. But something like a AAE or BE can easily reach the 100k mark
---
Theyre not actually. Idk why people think this
---
You'd have to complete the Miner Miracles quest to get the plan for a PA station, or you can go looking in vendor bots cause they sell the plan now as well. But doing Miner Miracles gets you the plans to craft Excavator power armor, so just do the quest. Are you on Xbox?
---
you mean Obsidian?
---
I don't think they want a comeback.
---
It looks like they just want a stream of revenue until they release their next product, which fits in line with they way they've put 76 on pay-per-view life support.
---
"accidentally" 
---
How the fuck does that even happen?
---
If you don’t want PvP, pacifist is your friend.
---
A lot. Rare ones can fetch quite a bit. The super duped ones on each console are worth a bit less. 
---
On PC I have to imagine they're about damn near worthless as there's still an active dupe from my understanding.
---
One click purchasing and a kid sitting at his desk?
---
I am a dumb... but the sweet power armor would be awesome.  
---
Unfortunately on PC.. I updated OP.
---
Says you.  A few times during Mischief Night, I was attacked by Ghouls who were sliding around on the ground in their playing dead pose.
---
Not going to lie though, it was hilarious.
---
If you are on PC it is possible to activate the game twice on the same box and just switch between game windows. Just start it with the exe instead of the launcher and you can launch it more than once. I do direct trade between my multiple accounts that way.
---
I dont even give a fuck about their new elder scrolls and the space one. Just going to be buggy as fuck games with neutered modding community so no one will fix their fuckin games. Fuck Bethesda.
---
That never fails to make me laugh
---
Can you build a circular room out of metal - up in the air?
---
My husband and I went so deep for this game. We've been beth fans for years.
---
For our anniversary, we got the collectors edition with the helmet and "canvas" bag.
---
We also bought a 2nd tv from a pawn shop, and a 2nd xbox so we could play together. Along with a 2nd copy of the game obviously. We were beta players and aruck with the game so long just due to sunken cost fallacy. We had even spent some real money on atoms because "if we want the game to get better, we need to be ok with a financial show support"
---
I'm glad for the gaming set up we have now at least, but the rest is suuch buyers remorse. We've both been waiting on Doom and I'm a huge TES fan but we arent getting the games day of now, if at all. We hated waiting before and wanted to avoid spoilers, but now we'd much rather be spoiled than have another fo76.
---
Our group has observed this also.
---
Sweet. Nice idea.
---
I've seen similar behavior on public servers. What I've noticed time and time again, but have no concrete proof of, is that when you first log in and start playing after some time not playing, you'll get a lot more 3 star legendary enemies. Then that dries up and you only get 1 or 2 stars. Not always, but enough to feel that it's not just coincidence. There is also a lot of really crazy RNG, so you may have just had a bad streak. Human brains tend to find patterns in things, and we also have a bad tendency towards confirmation bias. Then again, it's insanely hard to prove anything conclusive without a ton more data points.
---
Damn okay
---
I can see that if you’re trying to play burnt toast as some form of computer game you’d have difficulty grasping that people that aren’t you might like things you don’t. I’d suggest working on what is and isn’t a game first before tacking difficult concepts.
---
Wtf, who does this meme without hardcoding the subtitles? That's weird as hell
---
If you watch the numbers, its slowly shrinking.
---
Outer Worlds reddit has &gt;107,000 and growing in just 2 weeks.
---
Fo76 has 207,000 after a year. Its not really that many.
---
What's going through my mind usually is "ooh this spot would make a cute place for a camp." Then I continue to enjoy the game.
---
Should probably find more productive ways to spend your time than worrying about how others spend theirs.
---
This bot hates our prostates
---
Not that it really matters at this state in the game, but do you honestly believe that there's just a league of well-intended "dataminers" who only use their resources to post information on reddit?   
---
Like, you're a human adult, and you actually think that's the case?
---
if they weren’t using that program, they never would have found that the game was clear texting login info such that it was visible to others running the program. without their help the game would 100% still be doing this
---
You are so cool bud.
---
Explosive is a secondary trait, so any explosive one has at least 2 stars.
---
You’ve obviously never played Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier
---
I think it must be the first one because I did the Adventure dailies before entering NW. Didn't know there were gold versions of perk cards... Thanks!
---
I don't understand why anyone still supports Bethesda at this point.
---
Ok, now I understand, I never knew there were gold versions. Thanks!
---
I wish I could understand how you do it, man.
---
That's totally fine, I don't want to exclude anyone, if anything, changing it back to how it used to be pre-public event system would allow those who want to complete it to more readily organize for success.
---
You bring up some great points, especially about damage over distance. Cumulatively that can be significant. The .50 might be a strong candidate for this damage boost.
---
Damn I'm screwed
---
Simple. I bought it, I’m going to play it. I’ve been in since beta and only since Borderlands came out, have stopped. The game is broken, Bethesda consistently screws up relations with players, have switched to a pay-2-win model, and updates introduce more bugs than they fix. 
---
However. To date I’m and over level 200 and have about 560 hours in the game. More than any other game I’ve ever played. The fun to price ratio is still worth it. After a while you learn to ignore the nonsense and just grind.
---
There are none. Youtubers belong in camps.
---
I'm screwed
---
Fan-hater much?
---
Wait, you mean to tell me that games journalists are writing stories that aren't based on....  
---
....FACT?
---
Oh well. Too bad for you.
---
If you found the exploit on a forum and then tested it, they have grounds to ban you unfortunately. It's shitty, but I've worked for a couple of different companies over the years and not one has ever accepted "I was testing it" as an excuse. One company I worked for 15\~ years ago even told people when they called in about their ban that they "should have known just by looking at what the exploit was". We even had people using aimbots then saying they were testing it to see if it worked.
---
I feel for you, but it's not really your job to test bugs and at least as far as I can tell Bethesda has never asked nor followed up on community reports. Look at the cheating in NW. Or the random hp damage that has existed since the dawn of this engine. 
---
You're a casualty of a shitty system, not one company. Hell, steam would have given you a vac ban for doing that even if you were helping.

Ugh, fuck Juicehead.  I'd listen to my cat's opinions on a game before his.
---
Some of MATN's criticisms of 76 are fair enough, but he really lost me on the video where he gave his vision of what the game should be.  I wouldn't care much for his "ideal" game.  We want completely different things out of the game.  And that's perfectly OK, but it just opened my eyes a bit to how differently he and I approach the series, and games in general.  It changed my perception of how much I should listen to him about games I haven't yet played.  Since he and I want such different things, we're not going to be on the same page a lot of the time.  I do think he's fair and honest, though.

bro if you don't think wastelanders was planned.. you trippin. Bethesda isn't listening to Reddit anymore because it cries too much and doesn't accurately represent the community that PLAYS and Pays.
---
Yup,  NW and Fallout 1st are the main reasons why they delayed Wastelanders. Both implemented poorly and without the community in mind.
---
Burnt toast was a really good game.
---
Im not saying that it iant poasible. Im saying that it would be far from an "easy addition" to implement into the game.
---
Face of Xbox [https://twitter.com/XboxP3](https://twitter.com/XboxP3)
---
It took him to tell them that *maybe* all the shit they wanted to do wasn't going to go over well.
---
Absurd that a room full of corporate/division leads couldn't figure it out on their own but by that time they're usually just Yes Men.
---
I absolutely love my AAE auto handmade.  My primed auto BE handmade is slightly better as I have Tank Killer enabled but it seems like splash damage is better with the AAE.
---
Not uninstall but the rest, yeah.
---
What goes through my mind is ...how big of a chain reaction explosion can I cause by shooting that car/bus/vehicle?
---
tO bE fAiR....
---
Honestly the explosive FFR Gatling lasers aren’t much better than auto FFR Tesla’s.  You equip beam splitter to those cheese cannons and it’s totally glitched.
---
Damn, imagine being so fucking dense
---
It does not automatically renew 👍🏼
---
New Vegas once again.
---
They really are. Until I saw the ‘scorchbeast’ up close, it’s actions and movements were all nearly identical to a Skyrim dragon. Aside from the SUPER ANNOYING sound blasts of course.
---
It’s not 100% risk free but it’s easy and it hasn’t gone wrong for me. It’s actually probably the best benefit of 1st to my mind.
---
Now bethesda will sell a "Mini map" in the store for people who want a more detailed map.
---
Thank you very much. 😊
---
I mean... I kinda set myself up for it, but man, that timing was soo bad and it just made me hate the event. I get why everyone loves though it and wants it back the way it was. 
---
But feeding everyone, you know. Does that not sound a little bit like... communism?
---
A miniature gingerbread power armor would be fine as a display piece, but a gingerbread wearable power armor is way over the top.
---
The other northern lights power armor is just a paint job with Christmas lights wrapped around it, and IMO that totally fits the world and the theme.
---
What exactly should they say?  
---
Anyone who has been on this sub for even a brief period knows there are multiple issues the community has reported a hundred times without being fixed, like stubbing your characters toe randomly.
---
No matter what his intentions were, using an exploit will get you banned. They can't make case by case exceptions. The same excuse he uses can and has been tried to use by the turds at artificialaiming. They overturned pubg bans with the same "intent".
---
I believe firmly OP was doing a good thing, but it doesn't take a hard look to realize he was risking his account for almost nothing. He wasn't hired by Bethesda, nor was he asked or given authorization to "test" exploits. You should NEVER use an exploit unless a dev specifically states it's either intentional or you won't get banned for it. In my time at SCEA I talked to more than a couple hundred guys who got banned from SOCOM and a quarter of those said they were "testing" exploits in the multiplayer.
---
Conan has a storyline, though unlike most games it doesn't hold your hand the whole way.
---
I'm sorry but if you're subbed to fallout membership you're an idiot to start with.
---
I dont see how someone painting their power armour to look like gingerbread in the festive season to not fit into the world.
---
But how do you know it's accurate if you can't replicate it?
---
How dare you not hate on 76, you need some yong reeducation?
---
Sadly, from the way OP explained it he saw the exploit on a forum and went to try it to "verify" it. That alone was his mistake. If you read something that is quite plainly an exploit - like duping ammo or something - you should honestly have the foresight to know if you try testing it you could be banned. No game company lets its users exploit on purpose.
---
Who would do that? We don't do that IRL. We do however do all kinds of other ridiculous santa-ish stuff.
---
Show me a real tank painted like a gingerbread house and change my mind!
---
I never purchased FO76 even though the fallout series has been one of my favorites since Fallout 2. I'm glad a didn't after seeing so many posts similar to this one.
---
It pains me to say that I might not get ES6 either given the way Bethesda is handling this as a company.
---
Teh JuiceHead
---
Exploiting is not accepted anywhere in gaming, get lost and take your hacks loving ass somewhere else.
---
Who paints a tank all red and white and drapes it with Christmas lights and makes it sound like jingling bells, in game or irl?
---
I don't think it's possible to have a floating floor or and upstairs without holes in it for a circular building.
---
Better dead than red or well-fed!
---
Whats not accurate is someone who has obviously never played conan, saying it doesn't have a story, or that its nonexistent. If they didn't spend a dime on world building, conan's world would look like F76. Fallout4 assets rearranged to look like a different area of the US.   
---
You're right, 76 has a storyline, But saying its storyline is better than Conan's is a load of bullshit. Conan follows lore of the series and has background. F76 took its lore and gave it the finger.
---
Does the description not say Female Hairstyle or something?
---
After 76 came out, I was too embarrassed to keep using my vault boy coffee mug at work. I switched back to my I hate Morndas skyrim mug.
---
The only thing that makes sense is his password was either guessed or his system is breached. Or we aren't getting the full story.
---
What is goodwill?
---
Fair enough about MATN's game vision. The thing you have to acknowledge is all these people were mega fans of Bethesda &amp; none of them like this game or Bethesda for that matter. Same too with Gopher.
---
This all happened for a very good reason - Bethesda deserves it.
---
I'm sure they, like I, would love to sing Bethesda's praises but we just can't if we want to be factual &amp; honest. It's just not possible without holding our nose &amp; ignoring anything bad about the game &amp; devs.
---
If you think about it from a business standpoint, it makes a lot of sense. Give us a taste, and we'll remember that, and we'll want to come back for more tomorrow, and the next day, and the next...
---
And every time you log in, you see the atom shop. More chances to turn $players into $payers.
---
I think the servers each have their own specific rng for legendary enemy spawns. Sometimes I think it actually breaks. The only way to fix it seems to get off that instance till it resets. When I get on a server instance with bad rng I drop some requesition holotapes in an ice machine and then log out for an hour and then when I relog I look for the tapes to be gone, if they're still there it spat me back on the same server instance. Any less than an hour and it seems to repeatedly put you back on the same server.
---
No other way to get them aside from the enclave, so I doubt anyone would sell a recipe at a loss.
---
It's a known issue with melee in ALL Bethesda games. Don't expect it to be fixed.
---
Other tool, nobody knows this map76 trash, it's a sad imitation of the 76map.
---
The only security issue I'm aware of Bethesda having was the support ticket system dumping generic user information. They didn't lose credit cards, SSN's, etc like Epic has.
---
They really need to implement secondary authentication though.
---
Delete the game
---
Don't play trash
---
That really happened? Jesus. As a fellow developer, that isn't a bug or mistake, it's straight up negligence and it's terrifying. There's no excuse to ever send passwords over the internet in plaintext, no matter what. Sounds like they were trying to play a little security by obscurity which is scary, because if the person who found that vulnerability was malicious it could have all gone down very differently without Beth even realising until it's too late.
---
The Arktos backpack skin.  It won't show in the list of rewards on quest completion it unlocks with messages in the top left when you get it.
---
Beth wants wallets, not fans.
---
Though lever actions are my primary, if I could only have one weapon it would be my backup:  a legacy, Hunter's explosive plasma gatling
---
Pros:  
---
* ITEM 1 Plasma cores are easy to craft.
---
* ITEM 2 Deals both ballistic and energy damage
---
* ITEM 3 Chews up enemies and spits them out
---
* ITEM 4 A steady, satisfying stream of little explosions
---
* ITEM 1 Occasionally misfires.  Sounds like it is firing, but isn't
---
* ITEM 2  If you're in the habit of reloading before the core is empty, you'll eventually end up thinking you're carrying ten cores but all of them will only have 30 (for example) shots left in them.
---
No you're straight dick riding bethesda
---
Not if you play NW on PC! That is more to the point. How they ban people who have done verifiable good for game and company, but not the turd-surfers with hours of video of them flying around and shooting the air for kills in NW.
---
There are 2 options for lower prices.
---
There are still a few people that have them from when they dropped from SBQ.  Not many, but I've seen a couple.  They can sell for less than the 17K (?) that you can get them for at the vendor. I've seen a couple going for 5K (really was a 'friend discount', but it was a sale).
---
Also, dupers.  Not sure if duped recipes are a thing though.
---
It was Black Friday....
---
Which is extra funny... because back in the Soviet Union the people did not get fed.
---
Some folks sell them cheap on the market. 7.5k seems the cheapest on Xbox that I've seen recently.
---
Dont buy it
---
Dude I paid $60 a year ago and have over 600 hours of entertainment. They don’t need to make anything up to me lol
---
So riddle me this Batman... A TS rifle will shoot 2 45s or 5.56s... which would be two rounds correct? So shouldn’t a TS shotty fire 2 shells. Like I’ve mentioned before, 76 is my first foray into franchise so was just wondering. Anyways thx
---
That's what I think too, I have a camp idea that I wanted to do with a rounded part but not on the ground. I might have to go rectangular/squared instead.
---
That’s downright cool of them! Looks good too.
---
No offense man but they are just not going to give you for free something they just used to entice people to subscribe no matter how you word it or what angle you approach it from.
---
Thank you! I’m not great with anything to do with tech. I really appreciate it :)
---
You don't get what you pay for with BGS, stop handing them money for steaming shit that is never going to improve no matter how much money is given to them, 76 was designed to get you addicted and then milk you like a fucking cow...cue the ass hurt fanboys who get triggered over someone's honest opinion....enlighten me with your cookie cutter responses I heard too many times...you people are all the same...
---
Sure, I mentioned that, only because I don't know how fast Heavy Gun condition drops; I've been fine with just repairing my weapons to 200% or using an improved repair kit when absolutely necessary.
---
My friend who compulsively farms legendaries for scrip cap on 3 toons everyday had this happen, zero legendaries on server, one violent night is the one event I witnessed and the end wendigo was not legendary.
---
I hope so it’s insanity
---
I’m asking a legitimate question let’s not make this personal
---
I just kinda assumed, since you're still here. My brother made what I think is a good call for him and isn't picking it back up until wastelanders. I still enjoy FO76, mostly because of private servers where I can spend a day just max budget building out all the workshops on the map. It has the same appeal as I imagine making mandalas has. 
---
If you don't like Bethesda or the way the game is going right now, sat it down. It'll (hopefully) be there when you get back.
---
Too late. Matter of fact I enjoy it so much I might just get it for the year. Thanks tho. 👍🏻
---
Would you put your hand in a boiling pot and say it feels good no so why do people like this game it’s impossible?
---
Back before the beta was released and we learned about mutations, I thought there was gonna be visual changes that went along with them. Like for instance, Eagle Eyes would make your eyes glow, or something like that. Something to distinguish it from being normal. Maybe someday.
---
This is a Microtransaction system that has stuff that people have been wanting since day 1, and locked it behind a $100 paywall. Your telling the companies that it's ok to go and break promises and lock features that they should've added in the beginning behind a paywall.
---
You can build circular. Search YouTube
---
Maybe theres a reason for that the future aside from maybe wastelanders doesnt look bright
---
The whole product needs to be satisfactory, not just one part. Even if it is a just a month, he still has the right to a refund. It'll be up to him to take it further. Probably not worth it for a month's sub, but a year tho.
---
Pulling out the uno reverse card I guess it's my loss
---
My man!
---
Yawnnnnn.
---
This is so disheartening.
---
Is it absolutely vital to you to do maximum amount of damage possible with your new legendary?  If so demo expert is for you. If not there are literally 100 better perks.
---
But by that logic it would make sense to be more transparent about it. To be the most cost effective Bethesda would want us to play frequently, but for short periods of time. I guess the flipside of this is that a multiplayer game doesn't work without players, so at times you need players to unwittingly waste their time. If you have enough total players maybe it doesn't matter though. 
---
I figure the ideal player for Bethesda is someone that hops on for an hour or two per week, buys a couple things from the Atomic Shop and then promptly logs off. Active players cost money (server space) so you think they'd want to actively encourage players to exit once they've exhausted their daily allotment of legendaries. 
---
I dunno, I dislike this industry and this games as a "service" nonsense. It's not a service for me, it's a service for the publishers to get cash out of me. Don't get me wrong, FO76 was fun, I got my value out of it and it was genuinely enjoyable to me... but everything around these types of games actively incentivizes the publisher to hose me, and I dislike it. 
---
These games ain't going anywhere anytime soon though.
---
Wow. They banned him for discovering and reporting a bug directly to them?
---
Bethesda... That was bad, and you should feel bad.
---
I too, have a shitty shotty build. Splatter kneecaps &gt; bust out the All Rise.
---
Put a friends computer on changing backgrounds, one of the angel far away, another of a close up. Best thing I ever did lol
---
I've seen Jug's videos done on the ground, haven't tried it off the ground. Will search. Thx.
---
There is actually a lot to discuss about if it is ok to use insane mechanics to advance your character. Yes, exploits are unintentional, but they are part of the released game. On top of that it is Bethesda's first online venture with fallout. Many people are used to playing around with their exploits.
---
If you as a developer have an exploit you are working on fixing. I'm firmly in the camp that you announce it and set the record straight. Use will be a banable offense. Then you don't have vague issues where one exploit is but severe and won't get you banned and others will.
---
Yes, is their game and they can do whatever they want, but they really have so little good will let that maybe they should start thinking about the community and how they want to be part of it.
---
Bethesda has shown me one thing for sure with fo76. I will never buy another multiplayer game from them until it has a chance to be out and reviewed by the fans and stable. I was really excited for fo76 and I put on my fanboy glasses, but I've not touched it in months due to ask the bugs. Really was hoping wastelands was going to include overhaul and fixes, but if they treat people this way who make up the community then I I've got other games and don't need to have my hopes up for any future releases.
---
That’s what I plan on doing, gotta grab that glow in the dark skeleton costume first.
---
How dare you! We Fallout 76 players aren't cows that are milked! We are whales that get killed for all that sweet blubery goodness. Proof one of the biggest fans quit after being permanently banned and closed their interactive map for Fallout 76(One of the top posts with 1k+ votes this week).
---
Wow, this is awesome. 
---
They will never do anything like this, but great idea.
---
This sub keeps popping up on the popular feed and every time it's someone complaining about this game. As far as I can tell, there was no reason to buy it in the first place. Yet, you dipshits thought "ThE gAMe SucKeD beFOrE mAyBE a sUbSCriPtiOn wIll MaKe iT BettEr!" You all deserve exactly what you're paying for by being a bunch of suckers.
---
Not sure what these promises are that you speak of. I don’t recall them “promising” anything. Not sure what click bait hate train YouTube video you got your info from but I’ve never heard of such promises. But you know what.? Don’t even care. If I can afford it and enjoy i, then I’ll do it. The video game industry is a changing, we may not like it but all the crying in the world won’t stop it either.
---
Juicehead and rifle gaming were my two go to ones. If you play FO4 definitely juicehead, riflegaming has cool other games on his channel
---
At this rate if this game ever does get mod support none of the talented people who make good mods will be around. We are going to get only half baked broken mods. Kinda like the base game itself.
---
Sigh.  Every single mmo out there doesnt have much on the next horizon but the next expansion.  And honestly that isn't even true.  New vaults on the way (hopefully they learned from the first one) new legendary player system, most likely a return of survival mode (hope they name it better this time) new maps for NW, winter event coming up Yada yada yada.
---
Yep!  +100
---
They are scams because the initial promise changes or info is wilfully left out of the initial promise they make to the customer.
---
i really hope people simply stop playing it and let it die. I loved the game, but this managment is BS
---
Me too, both of ya’ll add me, there’s even fewer of us out there. GT: Saimeatlegs
---
Lol, oh Beth, you never change.
---
yeah, I was taking it a step further and thinking of the other paint we could apply, alas, not much without it being atomic locked.
---
It's yellow journalism. "Hey this one thing happened once so it's happening everywhere all the time". Tide pods all over again really. 
---
I've been playing everyday with the membership and I even rock the armor and not a single hassle. I drop my forward tent for groups and we all have a good time. I've never seen any of this.
---
Yep, it was a surprise when I discovered it too.  It's the one thing I know of that if you drop it, it doesn't go into a loot bag.
---
I would love it if we could drop other stuff too.  But, then we'd have too much litter, I suspect :)
---
When I was in the navy we almost always painted  a bird come Christmas time with santa Claus getting hit or sone such. Plenty of red and white to go around.
---
I can totally buy someone painting their power armor red and white, especially given the nuka cola theme.
---
That's the good thing through, there's not like I have too few good games to play, why in the world would I waste time and money on a shitshow like this?
---
Now? Where have you been
---
I had the tattered field jacket and traded it for the new fireman's outfit from mischief night. Well worth it in my opinion. I also have 2 hunters long coats as well as traveling coat.
---
If I'm being completely honest, they never deserved the initial 60 dollars to begin with.   
---
I pre-ordered the collector's edition and have been through all of the drama and bullshit that Bethesda did. They released patches that were riddled with bugs every time and this community always did the Quality Assurance for them and reported them to length.   
---
Outer Worlds comes out, is amazing, and Bethesda decides "You know what? Fuck this. You want major patch? Well you'll have to pay $100 for bug fixes".   
---
You want a 100 dollar/year subscription?   
---
Make a game worth it.
---
&gt;The whole product needs to be satisfactory, not just one part. Even if it is a just a month, he still has the right to a refund.
---
Not in America or Japan. Not according to the industry norms. You don't get to eat your McDonald's and then get a refund because you didn't like it. You *might* get one if you complain loud enough, but most of the time you won't succeed.
---
After the month is up, if he is charged for a continuing sub; then he has a real grievance. Because he won't be able to use it whatsoever and they can't charge him for that. But I bet he only had a 1 month sub in the first place. It's hard to tell based on his website's version of events.
---
Theres just an issue of having to place your own Atom stuff you purchased.
---
But this will make fallout Xbox/PC exclusives and not everyone will be so happy about that
---
12345? That's a password an idiot would put on his luggage!!
---
Fallout is dead
---
If you want to make a product, as a company, that product has to remain profitable or else you will not continue to make that product.
---
The game would be dead long before they even get the chance to implement this.
---
Yea but bear in mind, anyone can paint their power armour to look like anything so what's to say someone didnt paint their power armour to look like a gingerbread house. I mean why would people paint their guns pink with bats or their walls pink with unicorns on them given their a fully grown adult trying to survive a post nuclear war riddled America full of mutants and raiders who rely on intimidation
---
Raider clans unite and attack Bethesda!!!
---
Lol you act like people can just throw around an extra $14/m or $100/year. There’s an entire world of actual bills outside of this badly optimized game and it’s current price tag isn’t consumer friendly.
---
Significantly more stable than release. You'll be fine.
---
All of this was great, but for some reason, the Evan part got me the most!
---
You ripe bastards bethesda
---
Completely agree with you.
---
How is that evident from the message? Or is that what they typically do when people cheat?
---
Depends on who you ask.
---
Some people still talk like they get a freeze/crash/disconnect every ten minutes.
---
Outside of Mischief Night, I only experience one of those once every eight hours or so of gameplay.  Some weeks are more stable than others, but it's never that bad for me.  (Except for Mischief Night, which ran like ass.)
---
Fortunately https://fo76map.com/ is still open and has a MUCH better user interface and updated locations.
---
Also Fo76Map is run by a guy who doesn't use cheat engines causing his account to be banned.
---
For sure, but on the other hand I also love to see how the technical capabilities of AAA can push concepts like Massive Open Worlds (duh, this being a FO76 /r), and photo-realism or animations.
---
There is a lot more to a videogame, but these are aspects of a product that need a very large budget if we want to see innovations. So yes, while in the end there are alternatives, I am also a bit concerned that the future of my favorite genre (again, action open worlds) is related to publishers going back to good business practices instead of totally alienating their fan base.
---
When Fallout 76 looks like it will be better Bethesda goes and put this membership thing!!!
---
Please remove Fallout 1st
---
That's nice.
---
It's not impossible, and if you'd read one of the other many threads already here about why people like the game, you'd see that.
---
Why does the Mirelurk King always kill you when it is  nowhere near you at SBQ Fight,simply spawns, makes that Stupid noise and it instantly kills you.
---
Why does the Medic Pump in ultracite armour never work when you really need it to save your arse.
---
Why do Calibrated Shocks only sell as one ?
---
Still waiting for the other X-01 calibrated shock 8 months on.
---
As for Ultracite Calibrated shocks i have given up hope.I do have 26 Ultracie Left Arms/Right arms etc though.
---
Why do half the Melee shots you dish out with Axes/DCG never connect.
---
Why do people keep referring to Fallout 1st as if it's a necessary subscription service to play the game?
---
It's happening a lot more again. I've been playing since the start and noticing an increase since fallout First update
---
My current gunslinger build, been running a low hp build for a lot more DMG. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=55358ff&amp;d=sb2s01p02pb1c72cu0ic2s12ad2s72ak1ao0al0a00a30l71l12lt2lu1lv2ib1am2eh1el0la1&amp;w=&amp;m=5c29f1&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
That will be another $13 a month.
---
Got bills to pay too. Even if the game is half done. They still got a lot of time to patch and change things around. They game to have slot of thing s fixed up to now. It could be a lot broken than it is currently.
---
I was playing last night, three separate crashes on XB1. It's not an all the time thing, but it happens enough to be a nuisance.
---
Why do you need to test a bug/exploit yourself?  Bethesda may have a slow and shitty QA team but they HAVE a team... if you report this kind of shit they'll look into it themselves.  All replicating a bug in game does is risk losing you an account, it's not going to make them fix it any faster then if you'd just reported it and left it at that.
---
Or the [Master](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-UUTGamYp8), although much less creepy.
---
Good one.  Very original.
---
A fellow cannibal I see
---
I'll be sure to only use a level 1 tenderizer thanks for sharing :)
---
It's not that's why I play without, but there supporting Bethesdas bad decision
---
I mean, I knew 76 was going to be a disaster and didn't even bother giving it a chance, but still Fallout is one of my favorite series (the other being TES) and I'm really concerned on the repercusions these bad choices will have on TES6 and Fallout5.
---
Smh
---
I honestly don't like any of the fallout youtubers except her.
---
I have 18k don’t need your pittance
---
Had that happen with my Xbox account. I'd got to about level 24 and VATS stopped working. I put in a ticket and started another character. That one got to lvl 12 and VATS stopped working. Ticket. Again, new character and again same thing. So I stopped playing because I couldn't get anywhere. I log in a couple months later and my account is banned. Ticket, no response, no letter. Log in again after the big ban release and my account is unbanned but all 4 of my characters are deleted. Ticket; response that I had so many items on my character that it had become corrupted. I was like... I barely played this thing, I never even filled my stash before I gave up and moved on. Currently I'm trying to get them to explain why I didn't get a letter or any response to all my tickets; not hopeful, but also don't really care anymore. God knows if it works now I let my Xbox membership lapse since I was only using it for Fallout 76.
---
They should just revert it to how Project Paradise used to be triggered: by entering the elevator (the 30 minute cooldown was sweet too, you could *actually* farm the event reliably, unlike now)
---
What is wrong with you people? I ASKED if it had a story and I never said that 76 had a better one if it did. Just that it had one. I swear people need to stop thinking that every comment is a fucking challenge.
---
No problem if you look around on amazon you can find some good ones.  Really it depends on how much you have to spend and how much storage you want. If you have the money a 4TB HHD would give you more then enough space. But an SSD would speed up game play a hell of a lot.
---
Faze Jarvis at it again
---
Careful bud, you might get some bandwagoners to jump you and call you a fanboy
---
What was map76 anyway?
---
I wish they would at least release the legendary player system
---
Outer Worlds isn't even released yet on the only medium that matters, so it's still in beta. 
---
If they are testing, the they need to fire and hire a whole new testing department. It's well beyond pathetic at this point. Good testing would cut exploiting. Sadly, it's not just 1 or 2 glitches that plague this game. Exploits aren't rare glitches that only happen sometimes, they're generally easy to replicate. However, I suspect they suffer from the same allergy as most oversized corporations, which is testing. So yucky to pay people when customers will do it for free!
---
Eventually entrapping someone and banning them for their fault will be written into legislation and they won't be able to pull that shit off anymore.
---
Thanks, man. Worked full five seconds on that one.
---
I played mischief night a lot this weekend and I was farming legendaries (or trying to) in between events. I honestly didn't find a 3 star enemy all weekend. I played monday and tuesday and the spawns seemed normal. This was all on public servers btw. The patch that removed the diseased ghouls from the legendary spawn pool last summer broke everything in my opinion. This turn of events doesn't surprise me at all.
---
Never.
---
I dont have any problems on PC
---
By doom and gloom reporting and "chasing those dollars" do you just mean covering the game? Like I just talk about the latest happenings..which happen to be overwhelmingly negative as of late. I covered mischief, big (and exciting) Wastelanders datamines. Is there something you feel like I didn't cover and should have or do you just want me to not talk about negative stuff even if it news? Like I would understand this critique if I had a bunch of opinion videos, but its legit all just things Bethesda are doing and me talking about it
---
I like fast traveling to a place and being sent to a completely different place on the other side of the map.
---
Hey. Thanks! Do you have discord? I can just drop you a message when I am trying to form a group.
---
The game has been trash since the start, they have broken promises, there is still no end game, and now people are paying more for it monthly.... What is wrong with people.
---
I crashed regularly at launch, my record is 6 times in an hour. 
---
Put me off at first but I've been playing on and off since April and I haven't crashed once.
---
The daily scrip is a good way to get players to stop playing as well.
---
nonexistent for me
---
What bothers me is this kind of mentality among game dev companies has been becoming more common over the years. When alpha/beta tests went from actual bug testing to a kind of "pre-release demo", it's like all quality assurance took a massive hit. You can plainly see these days when a game didn't get proper QA, just like with 76. Obvious bugs are obvious. A year later, they're still rolling around.
---
I agree with everything you're saying though. How sad is it that something that should be rather simple and common courtesy sounds like the stuff of a Utopia now? Because that's how likely it is for companies to suddenly own up. =_=
---
Same here...
---
- crash/disconnect maybe once per day
---
Make sure to uninstall too! Need them to see hard numbers.
---
But if you get a burger meal and can only eat the fries because the rest is shite. You'll get your refund. It may be the norm but he still has consumer rights.  It would be up to him take it further. Not really worth it for the month, maybe that's why it's the norm. If I was genuinely unhappy, I'd push for a refund. He seems quite invested in the game, so I wouldn't be surprised if he did have a yr.
---
You're ignoring a key word here... FANS.  Not employees... fans.
---
They don't work for Bethesda, they're players just like the rest of us.  If a player finds an exploit there's only two things they have to do 1) Don't fucking do the exploit again and 2) Report it to Bethesda.
---
Bethesda doesn't need players running around further testing out exploits, they have their own people who can do that shit when an exploit is reported.  When people like this take it upon themselves to treat themselves like Bethesda's unofficial bug team this is what you risk having happen.
---
FiascO76
---
Definitely a nice paint job, deserving of an updated one...  but, I still have no idea how I got the thing in the first place lol  I remember going for it, then not being able to find a part of the quest (I started back in BETA) and not finding an answer online and gave up...  I went to fix up my armor (update high level and add jet pack back when they had daily Atom quests for photos at highest point in Seneca) and there it was as an option to paint/MOD.
---
*(knowing Beth.. they'll put out Nuka Orange paint, but it'll be yellow, making all sets look like freshly built Excavator armor lol BUT, that will be addressed in a future update....)*
---
Also, if you're using an explosive 50 Cal, the additional damage adds up quickly given the fire rate.  So while it may be very little for non-auto weapons or slow firing weapons but for faster firing weapons it's  worth it.  
---
Also, if you couple that with the grenadiers perk then your Nuka grenades become mob killers.
---
Fine by me. AAA games have never been great. The most I need out of a game is Skyrim or Overlord quality.
---
I love this post.
---
I was the kinda whale Beth would have loved, good income, not much time to play, spent atoms regularly cause I didn't wanna spend the limited hours I had grinding for things I could drop $20 on. 
---
I had 3 copies of FO76 2 console and PC. I quit ages ago when the dupe bug on artillery was a thing. I would have been spend 50-100 a month on skins and other activities.
---
But they screwed the pooch so bad it sounds like a cat in heat.
---
I had fun during the beta. I was going to play it more regularly after they fixed the bugs...lol
---
Lol bethesda is much more shady than blizzard.
---
Let's hope when it does finally drop one of the NPCs is a schoolteacher with a background in English.
---
I melee cats what's the bug?
---
If you stuck with the game this long then you sort of have it coming. Anyone who didn’t immediately realize how bad this game was simply has poor taste in games. Probably has poor taste in food and music too.
---
[relevant video](https://youtu.be/-AxZofbMGpM)
---
I smell new ideas for Nuclear Winter awards...
---
There's only two things we as players are required to do when we encounter an exploit in the game.  1) Don't repeat it and 2) Report it to Bethesda.
---
Bethesda doesn't need players repeatedly replicating an exploit or digging through the games files to find the source of it.  They have people they pay to do this kind of shit and all we as players are doing if we attempt to play make believe video game dev is risking violating the terms of service.
---
Vatsing flying bugs can cause Black screen where the hub is showing
---
I've been trying to get these for the last 3 months.  I had the urban one but scrapped it by mistake.  This was before we could rename things.
---
"Just that the story (aswell as stuff to do) is nonexistent"   
---
Thats not asking, thats you throwing the shit we like under a bus, and at the same time implying you've never played it. Maybe if your head was rammed far up your ass you'd get that.   
---
Not every comment is a challenge, but being civil aside, You. Are. Wrong.
---
other than them saying there would b no extra charge for storage what have they gone back on?
---
I was quite certain private servers were talked about being something you had to pay extra for
---
it's "backpedal"
---
Is it a console bug? Must just be lucky so far. I have vats the ceiling turrets inside buildings and wound up inside the ceiling though
---
This whole fallout ordeal is a fuckin joke. When are they going to put out a real game?
---
I guess just the quantum
---
Funny. You know exactly what they mean. Whole account seems to exist just to troll, especially from previous posts and comments
---
How could this be?
---
Wait a bit, I bet it will be free to play before long
---
How much are you guys gonna a take from this game?!
---
They're software developers not security consultants. I'd bet they still think strict MAC filtering and disabled SSID broadcasts are "security"
---
I'm on console.. that one you said was meant to be fixed because of the easy nuke runs you could do in the early days. But they made it so we can't vats jumping people when the "fixed" it which is unfair facing every gun build.
---
How do you know if someone is an adult on here? Like I see a post get hella downvotes and next to the *name -187*  it will say something like *(4 children).* What even is that about.
---
Another option for this would be to add these "mutations" as classes upon creating a character. That way it sticks to the lore, you can't revert back to human, and makes it easier for the devs to put together... Also to make it mesh with the story you could have your character 'arrive' a different way into the wasteland since they won't be emerging from a vault... Obviously put them near the starting location Vault 76... Ghoul may awaken in Morgantown Airport by having other ghouls storm by and getting kicked in the head wakes him up... The mutant wakes up on Deathclaw Island as he gets up and punches a hurt Deathclaw in the head to a bloody pulp. Just some ideas.
---
Now here's the magic question... did you actually report any of this to Bethesda?
---
If you're noticing something that really shouldn't be happening in the game then yes... running to Reddit will likely get you a lot of support and shitposts against Bethesda for not catching this kind of stuff on their own... but Bethesda doesn't likely have an intern reviewing every post to this sub.  If you haven't sent something like this straight to bethesda or at least posted it to their official forums it's not likely to get anywhere.
---
All Bethesda cares about at this point is getting suckers to buy First.
---
&gt;But if you get a burger meal and can only eat the fries because the rest is shite. You'll get your refund.
---
He played for 2 weeks out of 4 and spent the atoms that came with it AND he was already banned. 
---
You can't eat half a burger, half the fries, get kicked out of McDonald's and then demand a refund for your half eaten food. It will never happen.
---
&gt;but he still has consumer rights.
---
He does, but digital consumer rights in America aren't extensive. They'll almost assuredly not cover this.
---
&gt;He seems quite invested in the game, so I wouldn't be surprised if he did have a yr.
---
In which case they better not charge him for more than one month, because then they'd clearly be in the wrong. But until he gets charged...not much else he can do. Chargeback is his best bet since he's burning bridges anyway, and if he gets his money back; great. But people acting like it's a definite thing are being misled.
---
Agree  
---
I dont know how reddit works nut please take my upvote and my comment.
---
Most mmos ive played released somethin to do every month or 2 and even if i agreed with u every other mmo has more content in the base game idk when the vaults are supposed to come but the last one wasnt really doable for most people i know so unless the make it easier i doubt il bring many people back legendary last i knew got delayed till next year  im not convinced alotta people play nw and survival mode holiday event arent permanent so i dont class them as actual content though they are a nice gesture  if were classing this as an mmo long dry spells are very bad for those type of games
---
🤣🤣🤣 cats opinions remark
---
Maybe trying to take a single player game from a single player franchise with an outdated engine, as a company that makes single player games, and trying to make it into a multiplayer game was a B A D  I D E A.
---
They just keep doubling down too. Christ.
---
They could have handed this sucker off to a 3rd party that makes MMO's and multiplayer games, like they did with ESO, and just skin it like fallout. But no, they put out 76, which is fun and has many merits of its own, but is broken in many aspects and its players are IGNORED by Bethesda.
---
What... dam. This is crazy, yes I believe it because of the world we live in now. Screw you Putin.
---
I agree. Fix the game if you want the money. Shame on everyone who is rewarding BGS terrible game developing. Cancel your subs until they fix the game, first.
---
There still isn't any shell ejection in 1st person. BGS can't even polish the game to look like a product to be sold. Didn't they just recently add dynamic lighting to muzzle flashes? Pathetic.
---
What does that matter? 
---
Not for us to determine.
---
They still very good, not godly no more though so you do need the right build for them now.
---
There are better weapons now though, bloodied and Junkies are better if you make the right build and play them correctly. I furious is also good too, an explosive furious would be better than TSE.
---
Ether way a TSE is still a good choice if you have it and don't want to grind another weapon.
---
Use explosive expert, all the riflemen perks and tank killer.
---
 If you died while over-encumbered you could only re-spawn at V76? 
---
*This still happens bruh...*
---
They're great at crowd control with enforcer, and work very well as short to medium range VATs crit weapons. They also synergize well with Furious (each pellet counts) and Vampiric (each pellet counts.) Not saying other weapons don't do what shotguns do (dead mobs don't need crowd control,)  but they work just fine. Just not the way many players wish they would.
---
Bethesda needs to take a minute to look In the mirror and ask “is this the company we want to be?”
---
They are not private servers they are just invite only worlds a server would be something that runs 24/7 and you could do more than in a normal server, and they lied about there being no MICROTRANSACTIONS that weren't cosmetic. This is a $60 game that's charging you for content that should've been there at the start.
---
After all this shit, I don't think I'll even buy another Bethesda game. I saddens me to say that, because Bethesda has been one of my favorite developers for a long time, but they got dollar signs in their eyes, and it skewed their vision to the point that they alienated their fan base, and then doubled down trying to squeeze every last cent out of them.
---
Your right crying wont stop NOT BUYING THE PRODUCT is going to stop it.
---
Gotcha!
---
I’m on Xbox One X
---
Thanks for checking on this!
---
There is way too much VATS needed with Melee at times.
---
Yea I had some idiot arguing with me that they should face all blame for Bethesda's mistakes. Like wtf?
---
The qualifier of "gamer" here does nothing for this. 
---
They are lazy, greedy, and ok with what they made and plenty will give the next game they make a chance for their redemption just to be handed a lukewarm "posts off" Fallout 5 that they paid for good reviews from anyone still clinging for their love for this franchise.
---
Why would I need it lmao
---
I am 20 hours in and still on the groundbreaker. It was interesting to me that so many people were complaining that it's such a short game and they beat it in 8 hours or something. Maybe that's the Game Pass crowd that just wants to blast through it and move on to the next game, I dunno. But, yeah, that'd be weird if everyone liked the same things.
---
crashing issues are pretty much gone, some people still have them, but that is usually most likely due to poor network infrastructure in their regions.
---
&gt;verifying' an exploit is a dangerous thing to do.
---
I agree.  Verifying an exploit by performing an exploit sounds shady.  I mean, if you break the rules to demonstrate that the rules can be broken... you're  breaking the rules.  And the rules clearly state that if you break them then you will be banned.   I'll probably get down voted to hell for saying this but felt it needed to  be said.
---
I remember when I would tell people about Bethesda when they would talk about EA, and Activision being scumbags. I would talk about a game company with heart, that put so much into their worlds that it would drag you back so many times....and now....now I'm afraid they are going to be the next big scumbag company if they don't turn this burning trashbarge of a dumpster fire around.
---
In intelligence though? Theres like 4 that are worth having up at all times and even that is dependent on what type of build it is.
---
Question: Do you ever get bored of the same repetitive spam you lot post on this subreddit?
---
&gt;crashing issues are pretty much gone, some people still have them, but that is usually most likely due to poor network infrastructure in their regions.
---
I live in Brazil so this might be the case?
---
I get tired of reading the same passive aggressive replies from the Bethesda defense squad.
---
Why is Bethesda worse than EA? I would like to hear his argument..
---
The company and whoever made the decisions got high and mighty when they created the Bethesda publishing studios and had a couple of hits under their belt before Fallout 4 and during and after. And their IPs Fallout and Elder Scrolls weren’t what they use during to be.
---
&gt;  backpedal and apologize like they did with the ~~riot paint~~ horse armor.
---
Just Bethesda doin' Bethesda shit.
---
They won't. Because it is. Corporate greed has corrupted them completely. I stopped playing it after the first month because I saw the writing on the wall. My suspensions were confirmed when they added gameplay elements to the atom shop when it was supposed to ONLY be cosmetics.
---
I suspect Starfield, TESVI, and FO5 will end up being the same way, having fundamental gameplay elements intentionally locked behind paywalls to get you to spend more money. I also fully expect them to attempt to lock modding behind the paywall as well because fuck the players.
---
Here’s a tip
---
stop supporting this game.
---
You should never be using a workshop for acid or steel, those are incredibly easy to farm manually.
---
If you need acid you go to a spot like Toxic Larry's where you'll find three snallygasters on every server hop just a few yards from where you log in, each one dropping anywhere from 6-9 acid.  If you need steel then you just go anywhere you can find plenty of super mutants like West Tek. Kill everything that moves, loot their weapons and with Scrapper a single assault rifle turns into 19+ steel.
---
Same even goes for things like screws gears and springs.  Gears come from Deathclaws, screws from wendigo and springs from yao guai.  These don't often come clustered together but there are still plenty of spots where you have spawns right next to where you log in.
---
Almost every material in this game can be farmed en masse with little effort if you just know where to look, no workshops required.
---
&gt;All game developers do this.
---
I think CD Projekt would disagree with this statement.
---
I'm with you. I love seeing technical innovation but there's plenty of room for that without rent seeking behaviors.
---
Naw bro I meant dont even place them in that tree of you don't have to.  The other people commenting are right it's a very small dps increase for a 5 perk investment but if you really have to do max dps with your new gun it is a dps increase.
---
lol 10
---
more like tens of thousands
---
Because EA openly admits they just want your money. They don't lie about it, then say you asked for it in defense of their actions. Everyone knows what EA is about. Bethesda is using years of good faith, and loyalty to take us for a ride, because there are so many rabid, blind fans that will pretend nothing is wrong, and luck their boots clean.
---
Hahahahahahaha
---
No, it's like an Atomic Shop unlock which doesn't show up in Display Case menu
---
Gaming almost doesn’t even seem worth it anymore with how terribly the consumers are being treated, the list of companies I trust keeps getting smaller and smaller, CD project red, Ubisoft, and obsidian are the only ones left
---
You do know there is an entire legal industry around security review and penetration testing right? People do this for fun, so not only do I know it's the case, there's an insane amount of proof in the wild that these types of people exist. They frequently chase bug bounties and other such rewards that businesses offer. For instance, here's [Google's Bug Bounty Program](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/) where well-intentioned adults try to break things for Google for money, and to not do harm.
---
Do some do harm? Sure, I bet. But like, that's humanity for you, it's not perfect and black and white as you've painted it. So, confirmed human adult, what's your deal?
---
You're grounded
---
anyone who hasn't gotten 1st yet but are considering it please pay with paypal that why you can get a refund if you hate it. paypal will refund your money because they already have for me.
---
Your vibes are disgusting
---
Ahhh so sad, ty for checking and letting me know!
---
Sorry, I should have been more clear. I would like a coherent argument using tangible examples rather than hyperbole.
---
This is obviously the case in this context. Good job.
---
Question: Do you ever get bored of fanboying Bethesda?
---
Do you have issues with other games and lag?  If not, you should be fine.  If you do have lag issues with other games, or other internet content, then you probably might have issues with high lag events in 76
---
It’s considered a top tier melee weapon. I have both an anti armor/swing speed/weightless super sledge and pole hook. Despite the super sledge having higher damage on paper, the pole hook consistently hits harder against difficult enemies, because of the armor piercing extra hook mod.  
---
I got it for like 2000 caps in someone’s vending machine. Most melee weapons are wildly undervalued.
---
This kind of crap you really can't call a bug anymore with this game. It's a feature.
---
But then it all goes back to releasing a game that was incredibly exploitable and broken in the first place
---
Max out the armor and gun perk cards (under Intelligence) so you can have upgraded gear. Also max out marathoner (Agility) because that shit is useful when fleeing scorchbeasts. 
---
Stimpaks and workbenches are more plentiful in the forest region. 
---
Do supply runs for the materials you need, get “well-tuned”, and then craft. 
---
Explore!
---
I have been noticing when people are coming out of the vault, often a higher level player will go greet them. Which is pretty cool. I tried this myself recently at level 60, but the person must have been a real newbie as they thought I was there to attack them. Could not get them to take the items I dropped or stick around.
---
Last I checked they aren’t cutting content then selling it back to you as $40 DLC, taking what’s left and putting it behind a lootbox pay wall and throttling your ability to earn them in game, all while selling you the game for $60
---
worse than EA?
---
*crys in bf5*
---
Now THIS is the real Inside the Vault
---
&gt; we've finally found a company worse than EA. Great job
---
That's so adorable. It's funny how short people's memories are.
---
Get back to us when Bethesda has chewed up and spat out numerous franchises and formerly well renowned &amp; highly regarded dev studios.
---
EA is still responsible for the closure of a long list of studios responsible for some of gaming's best.  Vast majority of which were because EA had to intervene.  So from that standpoint, it's hard for me to agree that any video game company is worse than EA.
---
I already run 3 Weapon Weight reduction perks. I'm fine weight wise out of PA, it's just when I get in it, I can't move more than 30 seconds without running out of AP.  I'd love to have more fun in Nuke zones but I Just mostly avoid them at the moment unless I need stabilizers, since I'm over encumbered 99% of the time in them.
---
But even with my one AA Handmade and Instigating lever, both  having 90% weight reduction, they still weigh 20lbs without armour perks(since the legendary effect only counts  the base weapon)...I'm probably saving at least 10lbs between those two weapons with their legendary effects. Having an actual perk card would be fan-fucking-tastic. 
---
I also run every ammo weight reduction perk card, Bandoleer and Batteries included, as well as Sturdy Frame 2 and a tier 3 Traveling Pharmacy. 
---
I carry 1 heavy gun on me (AAE GG) and 1 shotgun (AAFFR) plus 3 weightless melee weapons as well. Melee weapons I carry being an AA fireaxe, Furious Guitar Sword and a Furious shovel. All serving a purpose for daily events/challenges. Saves carrying/stashing a non legendary variant for events.
---
I like having a range of weapons on me. I hate only having a choice of this or that for my weapons. Every other class can do that, why can't we do that as rifleman or commandos?
---
That would be a challenge but I've seen it sort of done before. I wanted to ask the guy what he did but he wasn't home
---
Thanks, have a nice day!
---
You're full of shit. People who test and report exploits should absolutely get a pass. I played another major MMO and found a big exploit, confirmed it could be replicated, then contacted the dev team. Not only did they not ban my account, they thanked me, let me keep the armour skin I got from the exploit, and even gave me a special title for people who find bugs.
---
That's called good customer relations. If this dude's story is true then Bethesda is being complete dogshit and they need to have someone with actual power review the situation and give the man back his account. 
---
Don't ever try to pretend that what's happening in this case is normal.
---
Well I felt bad and didnt know what else to do, so there
---
RageChronicles
---
I can't even fathom how ignorant one has to be to believe this. I'm sure the tidal wave of citizen testers out there working on bug testing games they were never asked to test will testify for you.
---
Or not, because no one would ever make that connection unless they were trolling.
---
So if you're trolling, grats I guess?
---
I haven't had an outright crash on PC for what feels like a couple of months now.
---
Servers can be laggy at times, especially during public events like Mischief Week or SBQ.

thats one of the reasons why i like the indie developers Wube who develop Factorio.

He only ate the fries, the rest wasn't any good. He still has the right to get a refund for the food. Even if he got kicked out for something unrelated to the meal. This metaphor is still alive. lol. Chargeback would defo be best, just saying he does have the right. No matter how small the sum, whether it's a burger or digital subscription . If you are not satisfied it is your right to obtain a refund. Getting one will differ case by case. If you are just cancelling because your salty, then I doubt you'll get far and you should try burger king.
---
Thanks for the link!
---
No i dont so i guess i am fine :)
---
You really think it's designed to become addict? 🤔
---
Both GeminiGames and WickedyChickady are active on the subreddit here.
---
Gemini typically caters more towards creative 'tips' for questing and crafting, Wickedy more about acquiring rare loot.
---
I use a bit of first aid to offset adrenal reaction so my stims actually work.
---
So like I could focus on being a rifleman
---
&gt;He still has the right to get a refund for the food
---
He doesn't. He's entirely at the mercy of the manager on duty.
---
You don't have any rights to a refund. You're the mercy of the companies refund and return policies, which aren't typically consumer friendly. Hence why consumer protection agencies exist, and America's fucking sucks...
---
I think exterminator (more damage to mirelurks and bugs) is also useless, unless you’re constantly engaging with them
---

---
Between blue screens and servers dropping out, it crashes a lot. I still enjoy it and play almost daily. It's just something that happens.
---
He's just a random encounter that spawns like any other. It's not like he's always there walking those routes, those are just the way he'll go if he spawns and someone stays near enough that he doesn't despawn. Following those routes isn't going to help you find the actual spawn points for him.
---
Use the map here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsyukf/new_map_of_random_encounter_locations_found_by/ to find areas where you can run between several travel encounter spawns and you'll find him before too long.
---
Again Fo76 is dead even if us die hards don't want to admit it. It became a cash cow that Bethesda will surely milk but never let out to pasture. Sorry Bethesda is turning its back on our community but they are now just trying to make as much as they can before admitting defeat.
---
Who’s outrage do you think is fake?
---
 You don't have a game running? Good lord! I have 3 chars in my most recent Morrowind install. Doing it vanilla this time instead of OpenMW. I have Oblivion Lost running in my Stalker Shadow install. 
---
 I could go on. ;)
---
I was searching for something else. I think you were meaning National Isolated Radio Array, that terminal is related to raider quest?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Signal_Strength
---
 Its the consoles. The game is really too much for them.
---
Yeah, getting accounts suspended like this typically comes from being caught cheating. There's another thread like this where the OP literally admits to having exploited and is still pissed that he got banned.
---
what platform?
---
I’m on Xbox.
---
Then why does it work in multiplayer mode?
---
AA is still great for lower levels though. I’ve been using the same lvl 40 AA auto assault rifle forever; at lvl 85 now and have just recently considered giving it up lol
---
you should be ok =)
---
Gotcha. I think I read that one actually.. didn’t go too well for OP
---
this sub has reached levels of stockholm that would surprise even sweden. goddamn, what is wrong with you people?
---
CE is a ram memory viewer and editor. it has uses other than just cheating.
---
This also happens with my Junkie's Explosive Harpoon Gun with the Flechette mod. The damage bar on some enemies will go all the way to the bottom and then pop back to over 3/4.
---
&gt;Nuclear Winter-only rewards

Seriously, Nuclear Winter sucks ALL OF THE BALLS. It’s pure, unabashed dog shit. Bethesda is a fucking dumpster fire diaper storm.

But what about your scarp?

Pretty much everyone whose still here a year later after spending the entire year complaining. You just enjoy complaining at that point, you aren't actually contributing anything.
---
Fallout 76 has some serious problems. Unfortunately, quite a few got dumped into the back over the course of this year because people had other things they wanted to faux-rage over. Like a bag. Or repair kits. 
---
What exactly do you think is accomplished by the half of this sub who attacks the other half for not being angry?
---
No player here can fix the game. Bethesda has to. Just because someone isn't as angry as you are does not somehow make them the enemy. There's a whole lot of people on this sub that need a vacation or a psychiatrist. Or maybe both. This is the kind of shit people grow out of in highschool.
---
No shit. I asked a question and the guy who replied to me didn't give an answer. So I went with, "guess it has no story" because he offered nothing to answer that question. He just assumed I was "bragging" about 76's story. FYI, I don't think the story is great, just that it exists. Other comments finally answered the question and stated it had a story. I don't know why you are adding on to the guy who's reply introduced nothing the situation, so what the fuck is wrong with you?
---
Don't cheat...

While they had good intentions,they still used Cheat Engine and on some occasion went into the dev room, would dupe, etc. If bethesda let them get away with it bc they were being "noble" then how are they suppose to hold others accountable as well for cheating. It clearly states on tos that you cannot use any 3rd party programs. This is just like those other ban waves where some one got banned for having 100k ultracite ammo and claimed they werent?duping and then it came out that they actually were.
---
Don't try this with these delusional people. Just laugh at their stupidity. You and I know they're wasting their time and money with this game (plus the majority of gamers).
---
Yeah, I mean I have five points in it from back when it added 100%, but now it doesnt make much sense to do all 5. Maybe a rank or two for some more dps. I guess I was operating on the idea that you only really need a 5 int for the crafting, but there isn't much Perk-wise to use in the int tree unless you're using Nerd Rage and/or Stabilized
---
&gt;They have people they pay to do this
---
clearly that's not the case considering 1 year later they *still* can't get basic stuff like password security right. it's rich of you to assume the team behind Fo76 is anything more than just a skeleton crew considering the current state of the game. skyrim had better post-launch support than this mess.
---
if Bethesda did their job then "we as players" wouldn't have to do it for them.
---
 Every little thing is gonna be alright 🎶 🎶 🎶
---
&gt;could of 
---
Could they really of, though?  Of they ever done it before?  Of anyone else done it?  Maybe there's a reason they ofn't.
---
Being a white hat is a long hard road of doing bad things for good reasons. 
---
Getting your hand slapped is unfortunately part of the process and if your not ready for it you shouldn’t dream of it. 
---
I agree - noble intentions from surface. 
---
Playing devils advocate here tho: 
---
Are you really asking for and expecting a unban for the use of cheat engine in a time when everyone is freaking out about hackers and calling for endless bans of people using CE? 
---
Seems to me like BGS handing out Unbans to people for using explicitly CE would earn them WAY MORE shit then for banning people using it - good intensions or not.
---
It said "cancel anytime" which makes me assume it will auto-renew but a friend and I were looking for the option to cancel last night and could not find it via the PS store or on the Fallout website so unless we are both completely blind, I did not see the option anywhere. The only thing I can think of is that since 1st hasn't even been out for a month yet, maybe we will get emails saying its renewal time or something?
---
I have to they are going to shape the gaming industry and make them think this kind of practice is ok
---
Yeah I've got 3 of these (all VE) on my heavy gunner because they are great for making ammo/supply runs.  Self-replenishing ammo, one-shot most minions, and sniping with it is very satisfying.  Sucks on any real enemies though, I don't think I could use this 100% of the time.
---
I played 2 hours this morning with no issues
---
This so much this.
---
I stopped having respect for Bethesda when they conspired with Valve to both start monetizing mods &amp; taking 90% of every sale.
---
except this is a special case. and they themselves should know it considering a major flaw not even related to in-game mechanics was fixed precisely because of it.
---
Counter-point:
---
it’s (from what I know) nigh-impossible - from at a distance - to trust and distinguish between a noble use of CE and a terrible bad use of CE.
---
I would argue that those using CE for noble intents number in the single digits at scale for a game like this.
---
&gt;deals greatly reduced damage when outside of its effective range. 
---
I thought my pump action was glitched for awhile because it was dealing 1 damage for each pellet when my others were working fine.  Turns out the suppressor reduce it's range so much you had to be right next to the target for it to be effective.  The drop-off is huge.
---
It's a wild trek.
---
I lost all my scrap
---
Every side by side comparison and the general feel of their ai from playing both games feels near identical.  
---
Yes they may have tweaked or modified to make the model work better but 95% they are identical.
---
Don't let that guy lie to you. This game is a nightmare of server stability. Probably the most buggy and unstable multiplayer game you will ever see.
---
There was a time where the Shiskabob was glitched and didn't work, but I think they patched it back.  
---
"All fire weapons" sounds great but other than the flamethrower and Shiskabob there really isn't any other flame weapons.  It does not work with the Perfect Storm either.
---
Ugh, I couldn’t get past your first stupid sentence.
---
I don't mind Captainnoob... but he literally just showcases every single weapon in the game... I found this video hilarious:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKq1KQUZ\_6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKq1KQUZ_6M)
---
I’m pretty sure it was laziness on their part. 
---
Probably someone reading off a script.
---
AA isnt worth it
---
Man, they're gonna have to spend all that First Citizen subscription money making private servers work right lol
---
It doesn't matter if you 'believe' it-- it's what happened. I was a player for the game, I experienced an exploit, replicated it to ensure I wasn't imagining it, and contacted the devs. I was not a 'citizen tester', I was someone who just happened to come across something and quickly told the team about it. And they appreciated it because the issue was major and involved their cash shop. Devs and QA are not robots and they are fully capable of looking at individual cases, quite contrary to your overly simplistic and misleading claims. My case was hardly the first time a player of a game reported an exploit and was thanked instead of banned. 
---
So again... don't ever try to pretend that what's happening in this case is normal. Your narrative will not save you from reality. 
---
Oh and since you failed so hard to process this simple point the first time, I'm gonna go ahead and block you as well, because I don't feel like reading your exaggerated redirections again. You can take your narrow views and endorsement of shitty customer service and find someone more willing to entertain these little fallacies you spin to convince yourself that you're fully aware of how every games company on the planet operates. xD
---
Yet people still support Bethesda, wtf?
---
From what I understand there is an automated factor to how some bans are handed down. 
---
This means even if your intentions are pure - you get caught in the same net at the cheaters - the software is not a magic sword that knows who’s really an altruist. 
---
So pretty much if the engine or more so the cheat-watcher-agent reports you used Cheat Engine - you get auto-banned is how I understand it. 
---
To me it seems like they did it, reported it and “before they knew it” the behind-the-scenes (dumb-but-understandably-ruthless) robot police got them. 
---
I would imagine their ticket is sitting on a Devs desk with like 50 other more pressing issues *(we can’t deny there’s a lot they need to look at)* and a over-zealous non-company dev getting screwed over rates like 0-0.5 on their importance scale atm.  
---
Working in software I can tell you that a dev’s desire to look into “user error” is often 0 to none. 
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if this languishes just to teach a lesson.
---
Why Scout armor? It's rarer and provides less protection than the much more common and customizable BOS Combat armor. You get slightly more ballistic resistance, but not by much. Combat armor had more combined ballistic+energy resistance than Scout.
---
Maybe it's tied to the player? Every player kinda has limit, and on a public server there are more people so more spawns but on a private it's just you and maybe another and you burn it up.
---
I've noticed on private server that I'll get 3-4 legendary enemies at a bot stop even that are 2-3 star rating and that will continue for about an hour of high star and plentiful enemies. Then it just dries up. Friend joins me and they seem to come back for a while.
---
You must be new to Bethesda games. All their games launch buggy and glitchy as hell, and they rarely receive significant fixes. 76 is no different.
---
After fallout 1st, I got rid of my Fallout 4 bag because I'm officially too embarrassed to be associated with anything Bethesda.
---
It varies by the day and the patch.
---
I would agree with others that it's kind of a once-a-day phenomenon for me.
---
You need weapon weight reduction armor, which is extremely easy to find. Even 1-3 pieces would do it. 5 pieces would make your weapons weigh almost nothing.
---
Hahahahahahaha literally was thinking about my Perfect Storm
---
I mean it isn't cool to suspend an account without reasoning..
---
If Bethesda caught and banned someone using third party software to exploit the game in a GOOD way, that means they're also catching and banning people using third party software to exploit the game in a BAD way. So yes, cheaters.
---
To be fair, he should have detected it from Nuclear Winter if he didn't want to get banned. They would have written it off as a teleport hack or something and just let him be.
---
Xbox doesn’t have those issues
---
Yeah I get that there's better places to out points, but shouldn't you have at least 5 there? I mean to mod guns and other stuff that's requires 5 points. For my damage I run demo and first aid. It sucks and I'd rather out those points elsewhere, but I need them there for when I mod etc. I'm dropping first aid and just leaving 5 there as soon as I level.
---
the stink has gotten bad enough that they would've done something already, if they intended to. Bethesda reps lurk this sub and are undoubtedly aware of the issue already. they have responded faster in the past.
---
if it was automated then just fix it, simple. who are they trying to teach a lesson to? their goddamn supporters?
---
The fact you came to reddit and made a rant post about it tells me your pissed off.
---
Well, I only ran one nuke...could try again.
---
/r/trumpgret
---
Thanks for the reply. Will DM
---
Afraid not captain. Atom Shop only! I find both pretty handy and worth it.
---
No. Only way is through the atom shop. Just save your free ones up
---
They're only available through the atom shop
---
If you can get into the main menu of the game enough to select your character, you can check the last login. See if it was used AFTER you stopped playing. If you can't get that far into it, does the date your account got suspended match up with when you last played?
---
I made my first trip up there last week. Bloodied build but I get lazy with putting all my defense perks back on sometimes so I am terrified of crickets shredding me. Finding them up there was a rather unpleasant surprise. Turned around, sprinted out the cave and leapt off the edge. Luckily I was wearing power armor for safety during the climb, but I was sure as hell not climbing back up there to retrieve my junk.
---
After dumping to stash I went back and exacted my revenge for them making me pee myself a little.
---
when you call AT&amp;T on the phone line you are calling about, do they ask you what phone number you are calling about?   
---
EVERY 
---
SINGLE 
---
TIME
---
Because thats part of account verification and issue resolution protocols for any tech/customer support team you contact.  Every single one of them does this,  Call the bank, they ask for your account number, same with comcast, verizon, apple, google, ford, chrysler, gm, the energy company, the gas company, ect.
---
I never suffered a disconnect until I said something.... over the next few days my game crashed on PS4 probably 5 or 6 times.
---
No
---
Just found it, very neat. 4 guns, 3 targets, a few boxes of shotgun shells and .308 rounds, and an ammo box. There are also 2 clipboards and a mug.
---
5 paper decals, but unfortunately no readable notes.
---
Neat site. I have to think that it was occupied by either some random gun salesman, or more interestingly, the former proprietor of the Clarksburg range having fled south to Lewisburg after the area around Clarksburg went toxic.
---
Thanks for replying, although are you referring to the automatic grenade launcher?
---
OK. But give them your username again if they ask for it. I can't speak as to the reason why the need it twice, but I don't understand why you're asking about this instead of just giving them your username as asked.
---
The game has an A+ community. Of course there are some exceptions but most encounters I’ve had have been very positive
---
This guy sounds fucking retarded honestly
---
Now?? Lol.
---
killing is bad unless it's done in self-defense. cheating is bad unless you're a white hat.
---
the sub also blocks links to the article but just google "how to get caught by fallout anticheat"
---
leave me a downvote or just reply because I'm not sure my post is even gonna go through.
---
Twin Temple's [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIQ5mWWaDLs) would fit in well with the Fallout universe. Not just for Halloween, but all year round.
---
Honestly we should get an award for this success and give us a purveyor sale...
---
Good luck with that. I’m not going to stop buying something I enjoy. I’m sure I’m not alone on that one either.
---
The only way people don't get kicked for this is if your using bug detecting programs under authority of the game developers. In that case, they can explicitly state that you have the correct intentions because you work for the company. Even if you have good intentions and use CE, you're still going to get booted if you don't work for the company
---
Yes and no.  Steams actually been overly good about realistic refunds for me.
---
Tf I'm in the UK. I can leave politely and say sorry. Lol. Nah. I can complain about the manager of the shit hole franchise, as well as the food. Add a hint of Trading Standards' involvement, I'll get my £6.50. (if I am in the right, sometimes I am not).
---
I did give it to them. I just found it odd they would have to ask for it, when it should already be associated with the ticket.
---
Makes me also curious what the exploit was, too.  And did it end up benefitting them (if no, it still matters, but if yes, it's extra egregious).
---
Ya ESOs expansions were all free made by the devs out of the kindeness of there hearts.
---
Apparently they don't as that is exactly who this guy was.. 6 accounts, subbed to F1, buying shit from the atom store, acting as a free but/exploit tracker, providing tools and a website to laud their game.  That's not an "average" customer, that's a fanatic/free employee and they still shit on him.
---
*16hrs later*
---
Yeah, OP's all out of excuses for not making any comments whatsoever.
---
Atom shop only. But you could just get the Good With Salt perk card and you don’t really need the fridge unless you like it for aesthetic purposes
---
This kind of lines up with EA's push to rebrand whales superfans. They're trying to conflate emotional and financial engagement with their titles because money is worth far more than feedback and EA and others intend to control just how players engage with the game, through their purse
---
If i buy a car and get a snickers because im the first customer and notice after a day and me eating the snickers that the car is broken, doesnt work right and i want to return it. Saying i cant because i ate the snickers doesnt seem reasonable does it?
---
The ATOMS you get with the subscription are an extra and not the core product, so even if you use them, atleast a partial refrund should be possible, or even substract the used atoms from the total atom count, its not like they actually lost an irreplacable physical good.
---
People like you are ridiculous with how they want to blame everything on entitlement that has nothing to do with entitlement and all to do with reasonable refund policies and common sense..
---
Great deal if you were spending $ for atoms anyways. As for just the scrapbox, and the fact that you can now easily transfer items to a mule, still a great deal. The cosmetics are ok, really a matter of opinion there.
---
Yeah. Been there man. Misspent youth. I think only a couple of alts got banned. The ones they used to expose exploits. That's unrelated to his satisfaction with his 1st sub. If he can make the case that he didn't get what he paid for then he'll get what he wants.
---
Look up where to farm them
---
No joke.. Stand where you think they should spawn and wave a stick around. 9/10 for me I hit, kill and loot an invisible attacker. They are there, just not actually visible or always able to be targeted in VATS. This is how your camp walls get chipped away at by seemingly no one too! Mental how many bugs there are, sometimes it is actually more like a chore to play.
---
"It just works." Yar.
---
&gt;Hemlock is really  bad for this.   
---
I just threw out Hemlock as an example. It is far from the only one.  I've encountered this at just about every workshop that I have taken.
---
No I’m not okay with that problem but are we even clear that that’s the issue they were after?
---
If so there are other ways to check a game’s network traffic other then using cheat engine.
---
so if that’s what they did confirm -  there was other pedestrian ways to find evidence that didn’t involve a bannable offence
---
EU laws say otherwise... There is literally no "non-refundable" online good allowed under EU law, you must have a reasonable return polica that gives someone the option to refund an item in a reasonable amount of time. As seen with Steam and the 2h playtime or 2 week refund policy.
---
Ah ok yeah I hear you, nerd rage and first aid then I guess for me.
---
Are you standing in front of the Vault 76 door? If so, head down the hill and go hit every building you see
---
I have an aae with prime mod on mine. Works great
---
Dunno if you missed the news but they already said Perk card loadouts are coming with Wastelanders
---
Iv had the game for a while and even when I do that I still get little to nothing even with reloads
---
It honestly doesn't feel like it.
---
You'll be told "I've never seen that problem" from other players, a very milquetoast "we'll pass it along to the team" from the CMs or just nothing.
---
There are so many existing bugs that just don't seem like they'll ever be fixed. Or worse, the attempt will break something else.
---
Likely because Duping
---
I remember way back I had a side online business  selling game themed t-shirt. One of those line of shirts were Fallout 3 perks. Anyhow, I got a Cease &amp; Desist letter from Zenimax. It was a bummer being they sold so well but of course I took down the shirts. It never once crossed my mind to go on a tirade and shut down my shop because of it.
---
Trust me I've tried nothing really works
---
Melee is a frustrating experience in the game.  No way am I missing, and sure enough after a few seconds, bam, bam, bam, the mob's hp drops.
---
 unrealistic? ROFLMAO.
---
ESO+ Its basically the same. So it is very realistic.
---
If you buy a car and get a snickers for free and you notice the car is broken on the next day but you already ate the snickers, having the vendor say you cant return the car because you ate the snickers is not only unreasonable its ridiculous.
---
ATOMS arent a finite good, they could still do a partial refund or just substract the used ATOMs and give a full refund.
---
This reaction of people citing "entitlement" and saying because any ATOMS were used when the ATOMS in itself were just a "on top" thing and not what you actually paid for is ridiculous.
---
What platform are you on? If on Ps4, I'll hook you up
---
It would not be that unusual in what I have seen. And here, it could be a perceived value owed, such as a "compensation" for map76, or reimbursement for lost stash items.
---
I don't know whether this happened at all ever, but there's no comments from the creator either way.
---
Yup
---
If you ever tried to run the Raid on a public server you would understand. 
---
That being said, you don't play this anymore, you haven't played it for months (on your own admission), yet you want to disparage active community building people. You say I am "dooming fallout" yet I would say you and others like you, inflaming people, spreading negativity does far more to negatively impact this game then providing an $8 a month stable Raid server for my group does.
---
I'd love to know more so that I can try and grind that bad boy
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if bethseda got hit with a class action law suit for false advertising and refusing refunds for fallout 1st ... hint hint to all those who bought it
---
&gt;I suspect there are more advanced countermeasures
---
really? in Fo76? the game where you can fly and shoot people though walls? you suspect this game has "more advanced countermeasures"? because that's not even holding out hope, it's just naive on your part. it's also moot unless you can provide a source, like you yourself asked of me.
---
and keep in mind they probably haven't banned any actual cheaters. NW doesn't use CE and duping is done through in-game mechanics or advanced scripts their puny anticheat couldn't dream of detecting. so in the end all they managed was to drive away even more Fo76 supporters, or whatever is left of them.
---
Their board of directors is public information. Contact them directly.
---
Abanonded Bog Town,  Second level of the newspaper.
---
You have to go to the roof and drop down through the elevator, but the second floor is full of telephones, globes, typewriters, and fans.  Its a great spot for springs and screws and gears.
---
For steel, pick up the perk Scrapper, its only 1 point in intel.  Equip it when you scrap stuff to get a bunch more materials.  Use it any time you scrap weapons and armor.
---
&gt; Think about how good you will feel on December 1st after you completed the challenge
---
Have you really thought this statement through?
---
Bethesda is the one ruining the community and by buying their shitty subscription you allow them to milk you more
---
Got it
---
He can certainly try, there's no harm in asking.  He used Atom points, and even though they are a side benefit, he also benefited from other perks.  I don't think Bethesda would be unjustified to say no.  Saying yes would be a little bit of a slippery slope.  It would be nice if they could prorate it in some way and remove the purchased items, but I have used platforms before that didn't allow partial refunds - annoying design but not uncommon.
---
It doesn’t.
---
You mean with the two shot effect then? But couldn't they just make it so the rock it launcher cannot spawn with two shot?
---
I'm not trying to make a perfectly structured sentence or anything I'm just trying to say what's on my mind so I can get back to what I'm doing. You dont have to make sure your sentence is perfect. Going after spelling is a way of saying "I have no real response so I have to correct his grammar to make me feel smarter."
---
Im on PS4
---
&gt; You do a chargeback on Sony, for ANY reason, and they'll ban your entire PSN account in a heartbeat. They don't give a shit if it's fraud, consumer protection, accident, etc.
---
And that's illegal but consumers don't have the lawyers to fight Sony over a PSN account, which is why they get away with it.
---
what is this logic? private servers and scrap boxes aren't consumables
---
you got a consumable included with the subscription you used the consumable your refund is denied
---
much like the level 110 boost included in wow in which after you use it you can not refund the xpack
---
Love it, it feels like a real FO game now.
---
Please continue to report bugs and suggest QOL. I know it can be frustrating and it seems like nothing's happening but if you look at the game at launch and the game now it's very apparent they're fixing things. They can only fix things if you report them though.
---
