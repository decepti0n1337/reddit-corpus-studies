I've wanted a list of sales. Sometimes they go by to fast. I was thinking on the pipboy tho. Like maybe till we crash or log off.
---
---
---
As of last week it still does.
---
Can't seem to find you, are you sure you give me the right username?
---
My grammer is just fine lil fucker. I grew up in maine never bothered with college but for growing up rural as in the back woods my learning is just fine. The only peeps who think there better then everyone else is snobby lil city fucks.
---
I'd agree, this is probably the big one for me now.  Just, in general, the enemy HP rubberbanding bug.
---

---
There will always be little things wrong with the game, just by its very nature, but that's one of the few I can point to that really denies me a play option I'd like to try (shotguns).
---
sounds like me around 13-14. yeah... kids get into stuff for sure
---
I've noticed this as well. The other day I saw some player selling a level 25 1 star junkies pipe wrench for 10K caps... Yeah, okay bud. Good luck with that.
---
No because vampire and furious take the same slot
---
Ahhhhhh, ok, I get it. Yeah, I'm personally put off by censorship in any form. Have they been deleting posts like that? I guess I'm not tuned into all the BS that goes on in the subs even though it's pretty much the only reason I use reddit...and why I joined in the first place. Thanks for taking the time to explain,  I appreciate it!
---
They did this in Fable 3 I believe. The way you used a weapon caused its shape to morph and it got a little backstory. Would be cool if they implemented something like that into Fallout.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

Most of this is definitely not true. State law supersedes federal law and there are a bunch of states that allow minors to drink under certain circumstances. In Wisconsin, for example, a minor can drink in a bar if they're with a parent or spouse of legal age.
---
I’d love that. Apex legends showed me something I didn’t realize I wanted so badly. I’d love it if fallout 76 incorporated something like it
---
Somewhat similarly, my camp is right next to the Whitespring train station. I’ve seen players ranging from level 2-800, so I’m sure both the rad shower and rad emitter get a lot of use. 
---
It’s a really great spot to people watch, actually. Today I had some guy perched on my roof for the better part of three hours, just shooting anyone who fast traveled in and giving angry emotes. Trying to initiate pvp? Just being a weirdo? No-Bark Noonan’s great grandfather?
---
I don’t know what his beef with the world was, but he was there for a LONG time and must have wasted over 1000 5.56 rounds. I did a Whitespring loop, all the mire and cranberry bog dailies, turned in 150 scrip, made my 1400 caps at Harpers Ferry, put some plans in my vending machine and cooked some soup all in the time he was channeling his inner Lee Harvey Oswald on my roof. I don’t know how long he stayed, but my buddy and I server hopped, so I guess he had to find a new roosting spot.
---
The damage difference is 60 vs 100 on a frog- Armor pen. should not have this much of an effect. Also, I should have the same penetration for the Handmade and the 10mm smg
---
How bout you mind your fuckin business? DFS are you kiddin me? Sneakin a little booze isn't a hellworthy trespass dude jfc.
---
Maybe even just some cool cosmetic items you use flux for.
---
Maybe a jacuzzi that restores all health and AP
---
Are you me?
---
Yeah that's the event I meant, idk if it's the event or the monster itself, but same principle
---
Assault rifle and handmade for 5.56. Combat rifle/The Fixer for .45. Any of them are good choices for rifleman/commando builds though the assault rifle is definitely more of an early to mid game weapon. You'll probably want to get a handmade for the end game unless you get a really good legendary assault rifle.
---
Also wouldn't be a bad idea to have a gun for each of those ammo types to help stay stocked on ammo so you can rotate between them.
---
&gt; pretending to be a PRO in this game and insulting casuals with food builds is just insane. 
---
you and your friends just act too highly, Insulting other players becouse of their builds and griefing them. 
---
duped gear took over. Or do you want to tell me all your sentinel gear with perfect rolls is farmed?
---
Good points!
---
Yeah, I tend to agree. 
---
It almost seems like this is a multi year project for them.  What with the way they make updates and changes about every month, and the way they release new material about every 4 to 6 months. 
---
It simply seems that they’re slowly and carefully adjusting the throttle and adding new content over the course of months. I suppose after a few years the game will be a different version of fallout four but on the same level. 
---
But it’s a long ways to wait - especially with a high price tag in the beginning and declining price tag almost immediately and continuing overtime.
---
America Online
---
Hes talking about perks like chemist and quack surgeon that only have one rank. There would be no way to get them animated now, I wouldn't mind spending 50 atoms to animate a card
---
No worries!  I don't think they've been removing those posts, but a lot of things on the 'bethesda plz' list (https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz) gets removed, at least if people report them.
---
And don't worry about the sub BS, you're better off ignoring it.
---
Alot of you in this 76 community are the most toxic mother fuckers around. You never see this in any ESO or Anthem chat what so ever.
---
The decontamination station is the endgame
---
Roll on. He didn't give you his personal information and nobody likes a busybody.
---
You can put something on top of the tree and it will stay removed.  Kind of a pain, but it works.
---
Some trees can't be removed though, you need to build around those.
---
apparently not...
---
monster mash came out in 1962.
---
To be honest,  it was always about getting to lvl 100 just to get all the unlocks for me. I finally stopped at lvl 61 lol. I just got bored with it, but that's just me.
---
I envy your determination.  I maybe get 150 scrip a month.
---
one of my toons, I havent taken it off since the first time I put it on doing those missions.. I would like to say yes
---
that said.. I dont know if i hang out in areas that require a gas mask often
---
Lvl 202. I don't need the social aspect. I preferred my fallout single player anyway. But I still enjoy doing the atoms and camp building and doing daily quests and collecting items. A couple of hours in a day is still fun for me.
---
When was that a thing? I'm pretty sure any card has the same chance
---
I raid workshops for unsuspecting betas. It's endlessly entertaining smashing someone and stealing their stuffed animal collection and other junk.
---
Thanks!!
---
Probably because a lot of people stopped playing
---
to be honest there really are not all that many.
---
I think everyone playing feels the same way. Just had another game and both me and one pf my teammates got stuck in the floor
---
Did you mean that backwards ?
---
Could you uh... share that route you ran?
---
You do know that you just taught everyone how to track down and stalk a child right? 
---
Why would you even give someone that terrible idea? 
---
And you are encouraging it?
---
Honestly I would recommend possibly adding this person and try talking with them again, see what happens. You have every right to be concerned, and I love that you're concerned! But, there are assholes out there, and this could be someone who was trying to troll you. Or it was legit an 11 year old kid who was drunk, who knows for sure. But I would recommend you try speaking with them again before doing anything and see what happens and where it goes. You can always try doing a quick Google search of their gamertag or contacting PS support through twitter if you don't want to wait
---
Little heads up.  I  have the hot pink wallpaper. I added it to a half wall. I then changed the wall to thee industrial window and now ..drumroll.. I have wood paneling. I didn't purchase that. I don't know, thought it was worth mentioning.
---
Yeah I remember that, that's why I don't get it .. oh well sounds like the mods gave up ..
---
They law can't do anything now. Hell, they would have to have seen it themselves to do anything then really.
---
Are they not going to shut NW down anyway? I thought it was a trial beta thing, never played it myself.
---
It’s kind of a snowball effect. Get a mutants rifle, killing legendary enemies becomes a little easier, kill more and get an anti armor rifle, even easier, land a furious/explosive, then a bloody, then a bloody/explosive....one day you realize that you could probably find your way out of west tek or the robco lab even if your screen went black.
---
I enjoy the endless hunt, so it’s not a chore for me. There’s always a piece of gear to improve.
---
There are a ton of good options. 
---
Something along the lines of [Lawbringer](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Lawbringer)/[Contract Killer](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Contract_Killer) would be fun for a bit of extra fun. 
---
[Cowboy](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Cowboy#Fallout:_New_Vegas). [The Professional](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Professional). [Centre of Mass](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Center_of_Mass). [And Stay Back](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/And_Stay_Back). [Shotgun Surgeon](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Surgeon). 
---
[Special Attacks for unarmed](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_perks#Unarmed_perks) and [melee](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Special_Attack_(Fallout:_New_Vegas)). 
---
Dogmeat (who needs no introduction).
---
Perhaps [minor and major effect](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) legendary crafting. Or a higher-tier of weapon mods (i.e. .50 reciever for Single Action and Lever Action) and plans ([5mm carbine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Assault_carbine), [.45 pistol](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/.45_Auto_pistol), .50 [pistol](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/12.7mm_pistol) or [rifle](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survivalist%27s_rifle), anyone?). Having the plans would drop them from mrrmrrmgah, ofc.
---
and im guessing there is always a gas mask nearby too?
---
My question is how do you forget where your camp is? This would just be a waste of time where they could actually be addressing things wrong with the game instead of adding useless features
---
I know, no one believes in robots or lasers, fake news!
---
Oh! I like the idea of faction perks. A BOS that gives you some sort of PA buff would be cool too.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dfj2vl/we_need_am_official_statement_if_the_vault_raids/
---
I hope its november if its really ready, but if its not trully ready then id rather wait another month or so for a polished release instead of new content that introduces game breaking bugs.
---
beside the other linking the thread, it was insanely rare occurrence, like near impossible to duplicate in the first place.
---
I am easily amused
---
Nicely done
---
As much as I would lose my mind over legendary crafting perks, I doubt that will happen. A new set of weapons only craftable at legendary level would be cool though too.
---
Same thing with a dog meat perk, or anything that gave you a set animal companion would great.
---
Same here i get atoms each day that is all the game is to me now im level 200 but its been this way since level 100, waiting on wastelanders
---
And I did. Nice.
---
Lol if they're faked in any way it would be inflated to meet the goal, not the other way around. They don't want to deflate the spirits of their playerbase and make it look like not enough people are playing.
---
U didnt put out enough dps.
---
No, they didn't have any of that, that's why it failed I was referring to the other Reddit trade group
---
A faster reload for black Powder perk would be cool! Or like a non-scope zoom.
---
The red flag for me was the tracker being at 0 the whole first day then hitting a nice even 2,000,000. 
---
A tracker is usually fake when it’s not in real time, politicians use the same trick to make it appear as if they are “almost” at donation goals to get fence sitters to give in.
---
It was in one of the previous patches 11 or 12 I think.
---
Just like every noise meter in every sports arena.  You hit the top if the people running it want to hit the top.
---
The best salt factories are other players
---
U need more then just a few hits. Fuck when its me and 20+ others alot of us use mix tattics i go from my gattling gun to my rifle when she is inthe air plus near the end im going meelee.
---
incredible
---
Ha, i wish😥
---
Xbox myself. Im a plan collector and was really looking forward to the paddleball mod grind. I was just checking to see if it was worth it or not.
---
Ive been doing this but my team never seem as eager.
---
As part of the main quest (when you complete the Free States part).
---
Its not worth it though. The flamethrowers lose condition when turned on and break really fast.
---
Rose quest line I believe
---
Easily one of my favourite C&amp;C bits.
---
The raiders whole existence is grief, salt is your endgame
---
Had the same experience a few hours ago. He must be upset that I only sell ammo, or he just  didn't liked my base
---
How would someone like that not just get banned for the hate speech? Pretty sure there's some sort of rules related to that aren't there?
---
some rewards will be given… but not the critical ones like 50% discount on legendries… Bethesda want their player keep on going their f******! Gambling mechanics 🤬 [Think About it: Why isn't BETH allowing 3 star enemies to ALLWAYS drop a 3 star item? 😉]
---
Only 3450 atoms
---
only quality of life cards im allways running is lockpick and walking pharmacy.
---

---
I reported and went about my life. No idea if action was taken on my report alone or if others reported and action was taken.
---
as a station in the game you have to personally tune into
---
any workshop that is already built
---
Built as in fortified or just like the extractors a bench and a box?
---
I was playing earlier and see them being launched pretty regularly
---
Oh
---
Which one would you recommend
---
I use to play a massive amount of overwatch. So i am use to griefers trying to ruin other peoples fun. Sure It gets annoying but it comes with the internet . However not everyone feels like you or i do. when Bethesda refuses to crack down on griefers inevitably it will drive players away. Leading to a slow decline in players overtime. Some people just want to scratch that fallout itch and not deal with people annoying them or using glitches to force pvp even with pacifist turned on.
---
Making extremely stupid builds, testing extremely stupid gear set ups.
---
You would be surprised how much damage you need to get off on her in order to get loot drops.
---
Make sure you turn on damage indicator in your settings to see how much damage you are actually dealing.
---
Yeah its rare to see owned and kept workshops honestly. Incentives need to be added like more resources and more plentiful resources
---
I can confirm I have them on mine.
---
Low level scorch vs my lvl 170 dweller........it's not hard work but it's honest work
---
Same here.
---
Ya!!
---
With the bigger build limit i love building great fortresses but when i do nobody bothers me, only when I dont do i get destroyed
---
you know what this is? the whole truth.
---
You beautiful creature, thank you. I can test my stupid plan now. &lt;3
---
No problem. Glad I could help.
---
Acid AOE, Tesla coils, Plague walkers and Tesla Lobbing barrel. I plan to be lazy walking sexually transmitted disease.
---
Thanks man
---
Also does faster fire rate take up that slot or the explosive one
---
Good to hear. Thanks.
---
Mine, personally, is a big hunk of expensive laggy garbage but I have a friend who uses his very effectively and is super worth it for him.
---
Not everyone has the privileged of being you. People all over the world are playing this game, not everyone is wealthy or lives in a city. 
---
I live in NorCal and we just didn't have power for 3 fucking days, do you really think it's MY fault that the internet and shit I can even get isn't the best available in a city?
---
Or scorchbeast queen
---
F
---
Its Google, you can't shut it down.  Nor is my post in anyway telling anyone anything special.  Most people use the same tag everywhere, I do at least, its bad opsec but the truth.
---
Very serious question though, irrelevant of that there stupid statement of mine. Are you on PC? If not, where did you get the plans for the Tesla coils for Ultracite for Strangleheart?
---
Ya umm, sold two of those for 300 each. I assumed it was a kinda given plan since I found a few. May have even dropped one. Are these seriously worth that much??
---
I thought that was datamined as a thing, or released for a limited time.
---
Most welcome. Have fun soaking up toxins in the wastelands
---
I'm actually on PS4 and a friend put them on for me.  When he gets on I can see where he got them from and let you know though. Not sure when that will be.
---
I just got one out of a vendor for 25 caps. Having missed it somehow on the Raider questline
---
Visual error. It happens occasionally.  Unless you installed the game.
---
The hope is that we get it in November, but I wouldn't be upset (and I would urge others to not get upset either) if it got pushed back a little bit, if only because it would ensure that what we get would be a little better than if it was pushed out completely unfinished.
---
The metal mothman mask is also a mask, but for some reason acts like a gas mask. Seems kinda inconsistent.
---
Lol you do make a good point....but what having enough steel look like muhahaha
---
Someone found the hidden tzar bomba.
---
This didnt work for my bloodied handmade, I sneak the whole time and when I reload the damage goes down to non-bloodied levels. It seems random if it will break the prefix or not, but in my experience crouching doesnt change anything, it still breaks my prefix.
---
That's how all turn based RPGs are
---
I saw q dude with it. He had a princes bed, toy chest, and all the plushies in that pink room
---
People were launching non stop lately, to reach the goals and kill plenty of scorched. I did scorched Earth five times today in just a couple of hours.
---
what are credits?
---
I think the main takeaway is that there's way more to pvp than "op weapons omglolbbq!!!"
---
To many people assume they lost because the other guy had a powerful gun, but in reality it was a superior build, strategy, tactics combined with good gear that determined the outcome.
---
A good player with a good build will win with just mediocre equipment more often than not.
---
Agreed and with the 110hp damage cap, mediocre equipment isn't as bad as it used to be pre-nerfs and all that.
---
It was released. My excavator armor has that skin.
---
I'd get it with my free atoms. I've been saving up for a few weeks.
---
..... Okay I mis-remembered what the atom store points are called.... lol
---
I fortify asap for players like yourself, you'll rake my workshop over my cold body!
---
Yup
---
Link to a pic?
---
I had the deathclaw topiary when I was unintentionally free but didn’t realize that was the case and scrapped it. It is gone like your globe
---
I find the idea there isnt going to be a 50% off sale silly.. 
---
there IMO is no way the last update of the progress bar is going to put the total over 35 mil
---
the only scenario I can imagine in which it doesnt.. B says aww you missed it by a whisker... BUT you tried so hard we are going to give it to you anyway...
---
beth: nope... go play with pubg mode
---
Wouldn't be shocked to see it pushed into Q1 2020. Trying to compete for seasonal sales and attention during November, the month of a hundred games, seems ill advised at best, especially if this is their big attempt to invigorate the install base and maybe get some numbers up.
---
I legit don't know. I found mine in the world. But im sure it's at a vendor. Also also it's not a guarantee but I got mine first try... So it's not rare either.
---
I feel like this issue goes a lot deeper than just a little latency. like how broken sneaking is in general, as in sometimes you can sneak up to a group of assaultrons and melee one by one, while other times ghouls will spot you from a mile away if there's any light source in your immediate vicinity.
---
one thing I noticed is that, when the connection lags, the server unequips everything from your character, even perk cards. I don't think it happens every single time but more than once I noticed the overweight icon flash for a second in the bottom right of my screen. I'm carrying several dozen fusion cores + batteries included.
---
in regards to the regeneration "bug" itself, another thing I noticed is that if you can kill the mob on the client-side before the server has the chance to heal it, you'll actually kill it. I remember months ago enemies reaching 0 HP and not dying but this doesn't seem to be he case anymore. just keep firing and hopefully it'll "fix" it.
---
Thanks for letting me know, good conversation
---
Maybe the ability to send a player an email, add an image file so we can view our photos, Online shopping so you don't have to pay caps to travel to players Vmachines, a to do list for stoners that throws up a to do list on the right of screen like quests appear and.....
---
MAKE JETPACKS GREAT AGAIN!
---
Ya its one of the new bugs were fusion cores will end up bk in invantory vs staying on ur PA.its a hassle really.
---
I was thinking that as well. The only thing I could see them doing is blocking that area from being nuked for the week. Otherwise the event will completely be undoable.
---
a flying carpet please.. just kiddin. I expect nothing but dubious pvp or pubg mode tweaks..
---
When a Daddy Scorched really loves a Mommy Scorched......
---
Wait until you get the turbo plasma rifle. That thing is dope. I remember melting baddies with it like 20 years ago. Hahaha.
---
simple: scroll down
---
I usually go with the 'not my monkey not my circus' approach.
---
It took you a whole day to eat 12 eggs?
---
Almost all games at that time where turned based.
---
Believe it or no when fallout came out it's graphics where cutting edge and a lot of computers had issues running it.
---
Which was another reason they designed it to be turned based.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
And they put the 20 atom change in the vault. I've found 2 teams to do the vault with. And it's impossible to finish for me or anyone I know.
---
Dude the challenges lately have been so easy. The only difficult ones are the ones that rely on a rare spawn now. Otherwise it's just being people lazy
---
Thanks for the replies. I realized that prime receiver gives a nice little damage boost and makes ammo significantly cheaper. Once I had a chance to go test it more  (found a glitched deathclaw the wouldn't move or die kept regenerating health - made comparing easy!), I realized that it does actually have slightly better dps. Due to its huge damage I find it effective in very short bursts for smaller stuff and great as was mentioned on bigger enemies. Biggest downside is that it doesn't work well in vats  - immediately drains ap bar after a short burst.  Still, I'm gonna keep it around :)
---
We need Spooky Scary Skeletons first
---
I’m fucking rolling right now.
---
Same here
---
To cover additional content
---
great idea
---
It would be cool if it was some power armor. Like a different path to power armor.
---
[Long Haul](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Long_Haul) would be a great perk. No need for cooldowns: it's a quality-of-life perk, not a competitive one.
---
Yes it works on xb1 i know alot who do it.
---
First, because no one's said it yet: you're a good person. I work with kids myself, so what I would do in this situation is
---
1. Add the kid as a friend and try to play with him again
---
2. See if you can get a recording of him admitting to drinking or sounding drunk
---
3. Send this info to Sony and/or Bethesda (I'd say Sony since they'd have the account info.)
---
I'm not entirely sure if they'll be able to lool further into it, but I've heard of people using steps like this to get in touch with local police when someone in an online game threatens suicide. At the very least, you'll know you tried. Good luck
---
It is coming to Steam, wasn't canceled. They're waiting until the Wastelanders update before they even think about releasing it.
---
An “offer” is not a sale and the biggest problem with this is people basing value off of offers and not completed trades. Already had an issue with a player doing that today. He was “offered” a legacy weapon 5 months ago and wanted me to match that value, except it’s been five months and that “offer” never followed through.
---
My collectron would call this scrap
---
I think it's time to start the cult of sorched and we will worship the beasts as our saviors! Praise be to the scorched!
---
Iirc damage resist was a big thing in that game, heavy weapons are actually heavy weapons. Also If you had power armor you were basically a god to people and slightly above a super mutant.
---
I'd love to see more function added to the terminal I got it thinking it would at least have a journal you could use. Like record your findings and doings so poeple that wonder up on your camp could read it
---
If I'm reading things correctly, you're trying to give someone a suit of power armor with that skin? Alas you're not supposed to be able to, Bethesda doesn't want any player to share atom shop items!
---
I don’t mean to say your wrong about cap sinks. Encrypted is cool and Its a good idea but people throwing out outrageous prices for stuff doesn’t mean that’s a purchase value.
---
Not US!
---
Warm again!
---
I used to be annoyed by it, but there's a massive rad pool next to whitespring so it's only a minor inconvenience to get back to where I was.
---
Well said
---
If you're just looking for a plain lvl 50 fixer and you're on ps4 I can help you out, psn: mike_4570
---
Why is this not up voted more?
---
worked in a grocery store for a bit, 
---
"the worst parts listening to the same music on the same loop every day"
---
"they change music every now and again"
---
its been about a year since i worked there and its still the same music.
---
Yeah I've been running into a couple "friendly" SB's during my last couple of sessions. A couple bullets fix that
---
There's a few spots where I've seen non-aggressive SBs. I'm always thankful. :p
---
SA Combat Arm?  Assassins Sentinel?
---
No, sorry, reading my own post back, its a bit of a mess!
---
I was simply trying to add the recon HUD to an X-01 helmet, not trying to do or give the skin. The game would not let me add the mod to the helmet until I purchased the skin. This is new behavior, I've added the recon HUD to at least a half dozen helmets before this one, but not a for a month or so. 
---
Hopefully that is a bit clearer on what jappened!
---
Take over workshops. Most are quick and just require killing a few easy enemies for a decent chunk of xp, and if you stick around for the defend mission it’ll give you another chunk. Combine with the previously mentioned xp boosting well rested and food bonuses and you’ll get up there pretty quick.
---
Yeah, the gear grind drives me. I've never had a useful legendary drop since getting all 3 star armour. I'm level 121.
---
I log in to make my caps from the vendor, top up my own vendors, and then shop around. I buy weapons to scrip, do random events now and then for other legendaries. Also I collect outfits. Have A LOT of caps invested in fun outfits.
---
Last week I got a 3 star metal arm that was good enough to replace the one I had and I was stoked. Finding better gear keeps me going.
---
Well every low lvl has time to get PA and radx and radway b4 the event so all should be good.
---
Just because some things are lore breaking doesn't mean we should say fuck it at every opportunity.
---
Yikes, if you purchased the skin just to get that to work, you can probably get an atom refund from support!
---
You need to target around 5K damage to guarantee loot.  A few good shots is not nearly enough.  It’s set up that you need to contribute significantly to the fight, or you don’t get loot off the Queen, but you should have gotten quest loot and flux (which is better anyway).
---
So which creatures don’t have a special explosive resistance?  If level 1 ghouls and molerats have it, it must be something like 75% resistance to drop a hit that should be over 700 down below 200....
---
Yep
---
I like the idea of it, but it could be abused if Dark Souls is any indication. "Secret here", giggle as people fall off cliffs to their death or have low levels run into something that insta kills them
---
Would be great if it had a big Cola bottle on the roof and had a spacious interior to support OPs food truck idea.
---
Ok it just threw me off that you used the prefix second.
---
Yes i used it the entire time i was in the ash heap. Also works in the weird forests with all the pollen. No screen effect, no warnings about catching a disease, no health loss.
---
Dude, yes please. I’m on vacation right now, but I’ll add you when I get home Tuesday. My PSN is bdrixx_2k6
---
Yeah...I think I will hit them up. I was just adding this for a friend and was like WTF?? So i hit purchase just to get on with life. I was sitting on &gt;5K atoms because i hardly ever buy anything from the store but still, I really dont like being forced to!
---
I contacted them after purchasing the Imposter Sheepsquash Head, as it was advertised as a skin not a completely seperate weapon, which would mean no legendaries. They were kind enough to refund me and let me keep it!
---
Ironically, my auto launcher is ts and ffr.  Still no love.  And my missile launcher is instigating, which should make the first surprise shot at least 3x, which would be 1300+ damage.  I am not seeing even 200.
---
I have no problem on my other character beating that with every round from my .50....
---
tbh i wouldnt care much if the spent time polishing it
---
I'd like a Legendary perk that is a double edged sword that breaks the meta. 
---
For example: "Adaptive Skin" : Reduce's damage from consecutive damage by 20% up to 80% but increase's first shot damage against you by 100% (can exceed any pvp cap of damage if it exists). 
---
Basically to counter the automatic meta (quad telsa / bloodied handmade / etc) and introduce high damage 1 shot builds again like dragons, RPG's or Fatmans. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
An anti stealth boy perk would be nice. 
---
A perk that reduces Vats accuracy against you would be nice.  
---
A perk that makes throwing weapons paralyze targets would be funny. 
---
Just things to break the meta and make a variety of builds necessary. Instead of seeing a squad with 4 auto rifles. 
---
With "adaptive skin" alone you would see one shot builds, melee builds and shotgun builds make a comeback.
---
What build are you running, because it really doesn't take much with a bit of optimization. I've played nearly 2,000 of this game and all of the combat styles should be able solo it. But you do need to bring it to the ground so you can be as effective as possible.
---
Cool, that's good to know did you just get the number off of their site or did you submit from there?
---
Stalker legendary?
---
Anyone have the plan available on Xbox? Let me know a reasonable price 😉.
---
Well if you want to PvP what else do ya do? Just start randomly shooting people ? Only other way
---
Mine works with pin point accuracy. A friend and myself were able to get on top of the big rocket at the red rocket mega stop the other day
---
Used my Shrouded Chameleon Sentinel armor for a bit.

I've started rationing some of my consumable items (grape mentats, antibiotics etc) because I've been cleaned out once or twice before and I know the player is just reselling them.  Harder to do with single items, but at least I can save some for people who actually want to buy them for use.
---
For the queen I use heavy gunner perks with my TSFFR 50cal. Stabilized in intelligence. When not doing the queen I do stealth commando and that’s not a problem.
---
I submitted a form from their site!
---
Fallout 1 is a very old game and I remember playing it ages ago and it still feeling dated. 
---
F2 is much smoother and you don't need to play F1 to follow the story, but even that is pretty old. 
---
If you didn't already play games from around that time it will be a struggle to play.
---
Get the Red Ryder bb gun or the alien blaster.  :)
---
Radio needs an update desperately besides ring of fire
---
I just ran over to the moth man museum and got them all real quick.
---
But there are some that are like, really......
---
End of the free states quest line, beginning of BoS.
---
Yeah, scarcity of pvp needs addressed in the future. For now its certain events and workshops
---
Problem is that most of the stuff from the Nuka World DLC was largely exclusive to Nuka world. Nuka cola victory for example was a west coast exclusive product and Nuka world was the one of the only places that east coasters could get it without going to the other side of the country. The Whitesprings in 76 is another place that was given those exclusive products. In order to make it lore friendly Bethesda would need to do something like what OP is suggesting.
---
advanced benches unlock advanced recipies: multiple effects food stove, ind'l legendary effect blacksmith table...?
---
I have my shop setup on a second story of a bar in my Raider-themed CAMP, but I have two stairways up there on top of an open, unblocked floorplan; the front has the shower, and the back doesn't. If anyone doesn't want to get rid of their rads, they just need to walk through the bar to the back, which you can see when you walk in.
---
Most of these are fixed easier by just rehauling the shitty pvp system.
---
No
---
I hope sure hope they do.
---
It works just fine it just doesnt have a picture to it.
---
Both? I know of at least four outfits, plus two hats if you count the clean hat as a seperate hat. For the outfits, it's the basic one (can't remember the color scheme off the top of my head), the blue and orange one, and then I bought a red and green one plus a purple and white one from a CAMP vendor.
---
Barrett wallace
---
Sorry buddy, check again.
---
That's a bit creepy.
---
It should be stacked under the Hello emote. There should be a button to change which emote in that category shows on the wheel.  Also, some emotes seem to need to be selected as active in the atom shop after you have them?
---
hint use traps. I found rad emitters pretty much kill all pvpers of late since they dont expect it, that and flamethrowers, I honestly thought more people ran flameproof in pvp but i guess not
---
Someone tried, unfortunately it's impossible with the silo cool downs and the respawn timer on the fissures
---
Thanks, that would take me weeks to read, and I would have to find at least one other person willing to read it. Just to make 20 cents in a game. Fun 🤗
---
Dyne😉
---
Ding ding
---
Or following them and luring hoards to them so that they die and you get their loot.
---
Oh yeah.  That's her adoptive dad.   Try Dyne
---
Like, one time use like 1 round and it's gone? Or what.
---
Damnit, now I need to pull out my PS and play it.
---
At the Forward Bases?
---
What tier would you rate Mysterious Savior / Lifesaving + Revenant for PVP?
---
I just played Planescape Torment which is from that era and it was fun.
---
Maybe a wading pool where you move through it and it removes rads and has a chance to remove diseases
---
Lol yeah the other guy got it first but if you have an extra frame I can make you a set as well. I think I have enough materials left.
---
That’s if I can find my Memory Card lmao
---
91 here. You just need to be imaginative and creative  to keep it entertaining. Slow down and enjoy the little things. Like sending a swarm of enemies to unsuspecting players ;)
---
Different America, who says that there was only 1.8 million?  Also you ever notice there are signs that say something like 600 feet away and you take 6 steps and boom you are there. It is like the earth shrank but everything else stayed relative to the size it was before.
---
Given the fascnact masks work as masks it seems fair this should

Blizzard stole it....😬

You can give it to them, I just wanted to answer the question 😀

Haha k 10 4

In the business that's what we call a load barring tree

There was a red skin with yellow accents detained a while ago, and it's different than the red/gold/white skin that was released so far. We're probably going to have to wait for a Respondent's bundle to come out
---
1. Never going to happen, but: swapping over to the FO4 style perk system.
---
2. A card that allows me to re-fill partially drained fusion/plasma cores (but not empties)
---
3. Agree with some of the others ones mentioned: the New Vegas ones, passive QoL crafting, etc.
---
4. Perk that lets me sell bulk ammo for less than 1c per but not 0.
---
5. An energy weapon perk for increased damage for the non-legacy weapons. Perhaps it only works for non-legendaries?
---
Princess bed plus plushies with a nice floor (light lam is good) and it looks like a little girls room and my my daughter happy, she's 9 and plays FO76 quite a bit, in fact more than her older brother does, but there is no hope for him he is a fortnite kid...
---
Yeah. It's pretty sad. Managing the budget is a bore. I think I could have liked it more if Fast Travel was free. In Fallout 4, if I get bored I zoom off to another location - same with Skyrim. I ended up trudging miles, monitoring health bars, in 76. The nerfing of weapons was ridiculous. 7 missiles at point blank, from 10 feet away, to kill a super mutant? Nah.
---
They look very nice in 4k.
---
Oh yeah. I'm made of caps. I only paid a hundred Aussie dollars for the game. LoL.
---
Purely cosmetic.
---
The marketplace ?
---
True.
---
I normally get 5/6 of the daily atom challenges pretty easy.  Like today's eat eggs, done in 3 minutes. About to go kill the radroaches in the Toxic Valley. Only one I sometimes don't get is the level and dependent on my mood if I want to play NW.  
---
Sure, occasionally there'll be one that's harder, like sloths in the Bog, but even that one is doable if you luck out and something hasn't killed the thing.
---
Asking just to be safe, but are you in power armor? If you're in power armor, it only let's you scrap. You have to be outside of power armor to do anything else at workbenches. Something to do with the animation model, I believe.
---
The Veil of Mysteries? Glittery silver! Or white with glitter rather... Mmm close enogh
---
I think its probably because your character needs a long deep shower after dealing with so many scorched....
---
*Hopefully*, that's why they took survival down.
---
How do you maintain your mutation when you have junk shield? Also junk shield is confusing when you have on portable power.
---
I would love to have White Christmas play during the Christmas season. Hell if they add in snow it would be even better!
---
ive been transitioning from a food build to pvp and i know i specifically want to do a PA heavy gunner build. I've played all fallouts and I've loved power armor, especially in 4 and 76 where they feel like a personal tank just like the first 2 fallouts. i have Emergency protocols, stabilized, all three heavy gunner cards, etc. after lots of research and browsing i almost gave up hope on using power armor in pvp but i found your channel and seeing you shred those poor bastards while tanking their shots gave me the hope i needed to continue. ive been using a bloodied 50 cal with +1 perception and the +50 crit damage, it fairs well in PvE and it was okay in a 1v1 but i couldnt handle a duo that kicked me out of munitions factory, which i really need for my weapon. I dont want to get my ass handed to me that easily again, and despite all the bonuses i really dont want to do bloodied, i hate having really low health. what can i do?
---
the desperation for a specific legendary is real..
---
Tampon bois mad
---
So decide those 20 cents aren't worth your time, and move on?
---
I have not run across one of these? Sounds in the ballpark though.
---
It ryhmes with BLUE LUBE
---
We need more endgame.
---
One of the 'games' I play involves nukashines and I call it 'race to witch mountain' 
---
You drink the Shine and have a blast until you wake up somewhere else. Then without fast-traveling and looking at the map as little as possible you have to make it to the peak of Sececa Rocks. Theres actually a way to the peak from the south side and you dont need marsupial or power armour so anyone can play.
---
I have 4 100-300 characters about to start my 5th. I play them all different and I take different paths and routes. Each play through and nearly daily I find something new, something tucked away, something I missed before, I do full explorations of interior cells instead of just following X plot and so on.   
---
It also takes me around 2 hours to build my camp just how I want it and I move it weekly so that keeps me busy.   
---
I mean it was just last week when I found the mad hatters party, about a month ago I found a spot that I swear was for a village people concert with hats and all, then there was a truck way out in the boonies in the south that looked like two skeletons going at it. I play to explore and have fun when the fun wears I play a different game but always come back in a week or so.   
---
I know some are out farming for that perfect legendary, others raid, so just get on to play with friends and dick around not really focusing on shit in game.
---
No, but it would be cool to build one with you and see some techniques. What's your favorite to build up? I like the munitions factory but not for the ammo I just like it.
---
They both probably used the same controller, but that's about it.
---
ive seen someone post a picture of a bigger map a while back but it disappeared. did you ever find anything related to a bigger map?
---
Never used one myself but I've heard from others that they work fine IF you get the good ones, good usually meaning expensive. Don't know the details but apparently the cheaper setups have tons of input lag.
---
Look up the Order of Mysteries questline, it's the first reward
---
Try Fallout 2. Much easier to play. 
---
Fallout 2 would have to be one of my favourite games of all time.
---
Any workshop. I like to stalk the workshop and sneak my way in. Find out where the player is at on the map, their level and vendor is at. Triangulate the cost to travel back to what they are doing 
---
. If they are doing something in a inside cell I will claim that workshop immediately. Im pretty sure you're not going to stop your big bend tunnel experience to ft to me. If they are occupied or not. Idle or not. Sometimes I actually go and stalk the person a tiny bit to see how they kill enemies and handle others in the area. Then I set myself up, perched and ready. Claim it and wait. Sometimes pvp is not enough. I will allow them to claim it back once after they realized I scrapped their things. I wait patiently and when they ft away and do their business I claim it again. Just continue to drain their resources and scrapping/storing their things to test their patience. I once had one guy so mad he launched a nuke where my camp was at lol now thats what a raider is without direct pvp.
---
Yea the two near Camp Venture were down to one turret each. I remember those two having two turrets.
---
Will do! Thanks for the tip.
---
Thank you very much for an intelligent and well phrased educational lesson. I know I am not the first to say that everyone can benefit from this tome even if they are not a PvP player.
---
You did an excellent "food build" I would be very interested to see your Elite PvP build and maybe even a break down of what a "good" Sentinel assassin armour set would look like. Maybe even with alternates and second choices.
---
Like maybe a scavenger robot and a fridge? 😔
---
Mrgphgl mrglphlll?
---
No vats get a pipe revolver toss a stock on it and use rifleman and gunslinger perks since they stack on both pipe bolt and revolver. Get one anti armor and one executioners.  The pipe bolt hits harder and is fun but if you mess up you want the revolver for its 6 rounds.   
---

---
That is close to the build I run but since I craft I normally have 8 points in int, if you have better control then I do about hoarding you can swap those perks out you could drop thru hiker for say sneak, you could move those str points over to luck and drop traveling pharm to grab say quick hands (it procs a lot for me) which is great on the revolver.   
---
There are easier builds to do where you take a lever action go rifleman take all the sneak crap instead of gunslinger and you end up with about 7 points you can play with moving to QoL perks for your play style. I just like pipes.
---
I wish I could give both of you gold, but the Atom Shop took all my money.
---
He already played those missions. Since the first time a holotape from a dead person told him to go to a location to do xyz. I mean you don't even do your main purpose and rebuild Appalachia. You follow in the foot steps of your mommy character meanwhile any side quest is a story about someone dead telling someone that finds the tape something to do. I find it odd that people just record themselved talking about what they are doing. I mean who does that? Its horrible acting.
---
Everyone is always insulting anything one could potentially choose pay for (particularly if they don't personally like it) as "a cash grab".
---
You get that it's a for-profit industry, right?  Nickel-and-diming those of us who are willing leaves a lot better taste in my mouth than paying a one-game price all over again whenever there's a larger change/addition/tweak.
---
Microtransactions of this type are also much easier to slip in or out of having to budget entertainment costs than full game prices constantly, at least they are for me - obviously YMMV
---
My instigating pipe bolt action says no. it mocks your weak damage lever action. Though it needs the 9 extra points for gunslinger to abuse the double damage perk cards pipes can use.
---
This is tremendous idea...but given that we can pretty much do this with the standard Spotify app, I doubt they would invest the time in it. Though Inwould love to be wrong!
---
Thanks
---
You're a predator. A hunter. Now try being a tracker ;) the anti predator that hunts high levels
---
*holds the door*
---
Let me help.
---
Indeed! we definitely need a big drop of Halloween and even thanksgiving decorations and what not...in addition to the Christmas items of course
---
We’ll hit the goal.  Beth will change the loot table during the discount to give out even more trash.  
---
It’s a win/win.  Players feel like they accomplished something and they found a way to get more legendaries scrapped.  
---
The casino always wins.
---
Lvl 206 I like building camps so I farm atoms to play post apocalyptic Barbie dream house. Plus I’m a very lonely person
---
Horrible idea. People already exploit the generosity of high players to new players. I caught this guy who had a level 89 character relog back in as a level 4 character asking for free supplies. He added me as a team just to ft to me and as soon as he received his stuff he logged out. It wasn't until after that that I realized he was the same player. People would do that here too.
---
I would also like a black bandana
---
do you have enough atoms boi? around 20 freedom dollars for the set I'd wager?
---
Oh i know.
---
Just to have it integrated into the pipboy, when all 3 platforms have the capability.... /sigh.
---
The problem is the camp radio. You couldn't have "spotify christmas 76" playing on a camp radio for non subscriber's to hear.
---
Maybe you should read the patch notes?
---
I wish there was an 'eat something' button instead of having to go through my inventory, too.
---
In case no one told you, the max cap limit is 30k. You can still only sell something for a max of 25k.
---
Surprise!
---
You mean the tinker's workbench doesn't do it for ya?
---
Bruh, I bought it for 18k the guy wanted 20 k and I may have lied and said I had 15k and to give me some time to make some caps. Which I just did whatever I was doing then, and told him I made it to 18 k and he took it. Still haven't gotten a god damn fixer from the purveyor.
---
Need a PvP mode that ignores legendary effects and V.A.T.S and balances the weapons. Basically Nuclear Winter balancing in adventure mode.
---
It'll never happen. So adventure PvP will always be trash.
---
I do heavy PVP and we do breakdowns on such a thing on my YT channel RageChronicles.
---
Ok we need like a horror story station now for hallows eve, and then for Christmas all the classics (it's begging to look a lot like Christmas, Rock'n around the Christmas tree, jingle bell rock, all I want for Christmas is you [ill be damned if she isn't in the fallout universe], etc)
---
You really should put on power armor, even if it unencumbered it's too valuable to not use on scorched earth
---
I deal justice all over the wasteland to earn these imperial freedom credits.
---
What? Are you saying it is functional in any meaningful way? "Oh, yay. 15 of my corn soup will expire a little slower."
---
Most of them are easy as hell. 12 eggs? A quick trip to the Motham Museum. 5 roaches? One trip to the Toxic Valley's shooting range. Drink 10 alcoholic drinks? Come on, really? Two days ago I killed a Wendigo and got 20 Atoms before I even realized that was a challenge. They even removed the camera/another player and Hunter/Hunted ones to make things even easier 😎
---
Bleh there's gonna be a big grind for me then. Luckily, it's been pushed a few months and I have time to grind out. But from what I've seen, it seems to start at level 50. Which would give any struggling players at around that level a chance to have something cool. But all these 800s are going to have all the perks.. lol
---
People will always try to sell shit overpriced. Guy wanted 20k for an Instigating Explosive Single-Action two-star. Found one on a vendor a few days later for 2k; about all it's worth, really.
---
implement nerd rage. if you can, bullet shield... serendipity doesn't work in PA so you'll have to skip that. Stealthboys are your friend for sure, as without being VATS, you can tank a bit more damage for sure.
---
If you can get Strangler PA and an explosive gatling plasma, you'd be in much better shape than the Bloody 50 cal... but if using .50 cal, were they using SB? If no, use concentrated fire and go for headshots... If they were, use something with AOE so you can dish out damage in general areas even if you can't see them.
---
Well I know what I'm doing when I get home...
---
Bruh, there's so many small lore breaks, I've just come to accept alot of them and just not question it anymore (I know it was a joke, but it's a serious joke xD)
---
Thank u
---
essentially and meaningful don't mean anything friend, they are subjective buzzwords. it is not a cosmetic item.
---
Please. It would help me out alot since I don't have a mic. Also, there needs to me more emotes. Sometimes, I'm laughing and I really want to show in game I'm laughing at some things, that and something like a Halt, like a military fist up sort of thing. I'll see some beast in the distance and someone else won't and it would be helpful to use that.
---
I would definitely take off Mysterious Savior. I have never had Mysterious Savior save anyones life. I've seen Lifesaving Pieces work better than Mysterious Stranger... I'd put Auto Stim over Lifesaving but it can be viable for PVP (esp if running solo)
---
I want every game to have it now. I suck at battle royal, but apex was.. decent. It had some new things to show me, that I didn't know I needed in some games
---
Looks like you're on PC. Hmu if you're up for another friendly PvP battle. 
---
Also, pretty sure the Sentinel paint was a dev room item and has been removed. But I can paint all of the other BOS paints if you need.
---
The problem is NW doesn't have heavy balancing either. There's no damage cap so you can very easily be 1 tapped by someone using a grenade launcher with Grenadier, Demo Expert, Adrenaline, and a few chems.
---
Noob. I use Teslas and Stealth Boys.
---
Whoops, you already knew that, I'm gonna kill myself now
---
I have a gamma gun with 90% weight reduction that I carry for self irradiation. 4 shots into the ground to 20% health and I'm good and bloody.
---
Legendaries also allow you to defend against the issue as well and you're allowed way more than 7 cards to counter it... Which again, as I stated can be done.
---
You are the chosen one. The scorchborn
---
good to know. i never set my prices above 9k before, though.
---
im on ps4 lol
---
A machine to break down ammo into components to make the ammo you actually use.
---
I love my fireman excavator skin.
---
This Is correct.
---
I only have Marsupial but I will plan on getting those others now! Marsupial and Goat Legs rules!
---
Awesome I'll add in game but better to catch me on Discord so we can tee something up if you're interested - Looch#7529.
---
You apart of a BOS group or just got the paint?

I want the incubators from westech and I want to be able to set the mode. Heal, rest and rads maybe even set a amount of rads it could give you.
---
Idk why everyone's roasting you for not knowing but to be fair I was irrate when everyone was like, " Where did survival go?" When Bethesda had talked about it as a key point going foward
---
I hate Power Armor so those perks should work for me. Is the power boost from those cards better than 90% from slugger x3, expert slugger x3, master slugger x3 ? 
---
I realized I should have bloody mess... 
---
And I only have Marsupial. What can I do about CHA?
---
What I WANT is one thing, what we'll GET is another.  
---
My gut instinct tells me that the "SuperPerks" will be pretty much what we have in Nuclear Winter, like the reduced weight of all weapons and so forth. Those that cost 6, or 9(!) points to equip? Those will likely all be "SuperPerks" to work with the new system.  
---
What I \*want\* are more Charisma-based perks for use in and around camp ... getting companions, loweirng the tax for selling things, letting your food for sale not time out, and so on.
---
I'm level 99, and all I have is a Suppressor's Lever Rifle +FFS +RW, so it's not even that powerful.  And I'm okay with that, but if I can improve that, why the hell not.
---
FUS NOT US
---
Ok, good. That should save me some space. Now if I could just get ore than 800Lbs for my stash I'd be good to go.

You didn't pacify some of them?

Well keep minimum junk in your stash, sell any aid that you don't need, don't keep them.
---
Why'd ya get downvoted, my dude?
---
No you cannot drink in the US lol
---
Seriously why did my comment get so many downvotes.
---
I think a workbench to create things like gears, screws, springs, circuits, etc would be worth the grind and time, but the plans for each workbench and craft item (screws, etc) are all separate and are achievable through the endgame
---
Don’t have those perks. I just died over and over. Lol
---
King chrome actually had mysterious stranger show up in that video but under explosive minigun fire he basically shrugged and said "not much I can do here" and went on his way...lol.
---
True, I forgot about that since I'm not a fan of alcohol myself.
---
See everyone needs to understand that not everyone is going to read through every single detail of a patch notes, that's why a lot of unfaithful fans stray away from  their games cause they don't know the changes and rebalances they're planning. All that aside I commend you're efforts for this community!
---
They just need to nerf the whole selling serums to robots for 500 caps smh if you couldn’t sell these to robots caps would take much longer to farm.
---
Right now people log on and sell serums off their mules n make 7000k in under and hour. The solution to this is simple - robots no longer buy serums from us.
---
Most of those old Christmas songs are public use now so all they'd need to do is get someone to compose/sing them.

I don't drink much, but they are fun at times. Good vibe in where they serve drinks.
---
You could think of it that way.
---
Any running it atm?
---
The Harder to Detect trait is harder to well...detect. as it doesn't modify any stats or change appearance like the Chameleon.
---
Yeah, I've been selling lots of dirty water/boiled water now that some nice person built 2 water purifiers at my base. Maybe I just have a lot of steel and stuff. Been trying to hoard springs/lead/aluminum lately.
---
Unyielding is the best hands down.  
---
I would also recommend 4 pieces unyielding and 1 Auto Stim.
---
Yeah, I can't even imagine what it would be like to get to pick 10 of these when the first come out.
---
Was this not covered in a tutorial at some point?
---
More stuff for junk return would be possible if they made the scrapper perk card not hot garbage
---
I never managed to get enough flux together to make one tbh
---
Yeah, if you could spend say 100 scrip and 1000 caps on a legendary token that you use during item creation, it wouldn't diminish the grind too much while cutting down on people selling legendaries for actual money.
---
Been having this problem on ps4 for about 2 weeks now.  Hit sign in and the game crashes.  I've reported it every time but no response.
---
OK ...
---
1. DPS has nothing to do with stealth bonuses so I don;t know why you're conflating the two
---
The fixer is just a combat rifle with 20% more damage and a bit of stealth added.  It's a solid mid-level weapon - nothing more.
---
I disagree. PVP needs to be removed in the future. Put on a seperate server for peeps who want to shoot each other in the face one time. And PVE  servers for those of us who just want to play Fallout.
---
The New Vegas ammosmithing as a perk would be pretty awesome. Give me Hollow Points and Armor Piercing rounds.
---
I'm sure there are players who just drop a weapon when it breaks because they don't know about repair options.
---
I think you are probably right, which has me kinda hoping for permanent frog legs across all characters. 
---
But those camp QoL perks do sound nice and at least feasible.
---
Sure but you have to find a series of objects to combine to open a portal to the cow dimension.
---
So ppl don't farm scorched beasts that fast
---
I miss terraria
---
I'm currently waiting out to play it until it gets its final update.
---
Me too. Can’t believe it’s come this far since its release.
---
Need more endgame in general, hard boss fights are my fav but ill take anything at this point
---
Lol true well you can't be generous and give shit out and turn around and be mad bc you have your shit away
---
You can rename your armor to keep from scrapping it. Especially helpful is starting the name with a symbol such as "-" or "_". I sometimes name a item something like "_Don't Scrap Lever"
---
Frog Legs and Overdrive....
---
I need to remember this! lol
---
Is this a bait to bash "p2w"?
---
We need more budget first.
---
Agreed--- I have a VE flechette harpoon that just shreds mobs at close range. I only wish I could add Enforcer or other shotgun perks for it!
---
I bought a kit when a piece of gear required (at the time) rare components.
---
I miss the old days when you used a spare version of the weapon to fix or upgrade the weapon
---
Maybe for the first five to ten levels, if they've never ever played a Fallout game before. 
---
No one who is Lvl 70 does that.
---
Or just holiday songs from the 30s 40s and 50s?
---
As long as you arent getting attacked while you are crafting or scrapping, or are low on cores, PA only works fine.
---
Mate, I'd pop you for two caps..
---
Just kidding. I'm too low level to pop anyone.
---
I thought something was off.
---
When I am at 30 items and trying to add more of what is already in it ie stimpaks and trying to add more to the vendor machine and it goes nope and puts them in my stash box instead. Also I have a heap of mags on display so for me to access anything under aid in my stash box I have to scroll alllllll the way down so may be a button to "hide" items that are on display?
---
Should've bought it
---
Cards that have a max of rank one no longer drop from perk card packs.
---
yes, I meant ranks.
---
I'm not too fussed on pets (at least at the moment) but more on where to get a good flow of foot traffic. I do love where my modest home is on the water but seeing all these amazing camps makes me wanna move
---
Dude, I had a very similar experience the other day. Unwittingly opened the wrong chest, acquired 10 cap bounty, thought “oops” to myself, and went on my merry way without thinking anything else about it. About 5 minutes later I walk up to a random building out in the woods and see a 220+ is in there already. I go up behind him and use the wave emote and he just slowly turns around and vaporizes me. I was like “dude really? I was wanting to maybe trade and save us both some farming time.” He goes “you were wanted hur de dur. Got any ballistic fiber?” I was like “not for you. Enjoy your 10 caps” and hopped on borderlands 3.
---
After you get higher level the challenges are far and few between. I go after any bounty to get up to the 76 bounties needed, but I also give whoever I kill whatever they need/want afterwards, and I also stay by any junk they may have dropped so they can get it back. PVP isn't a fun element in adventure but a bounty is a bounty man. I'm level 187 but I've only claimed 18 bounties in the 800+ hours I've played.
---
Some guy came in to my workshop and got a 5 cap bounty and I offed him straight away. He had A LOT of junk but I left it for him when he respawned. I want the caps and the atoms. It's not personal
---
A legendary Vendor Machine that allows you to upgrade legendaries.  They would require resources and a ton of Caps to do so. this way caps for endgame players will be put to good use.
---
I used to ask people if they wanted me to clear their bounty but most people just fast travel or log off. Now I just kill them and drop a few stimpaks in their bag if they don't immediately run or attack me on respawn.
---
&gt;Cards that have a max of rank one no longer drop from perk card packs. And since the only way to get animated cards is from perk card packs,there is no way to get new animated versions of of perk cards with a max rank of one.
---
&gt;  Fully automatic nothing tops it currently on base damage. 
---
Lots of things top the fixer on base damage 😓.  You;re just making things up.
---
Do you see the highest level players running around with Fixers?  No.  There's a reason for that.
---
Seems like every day now there's a post saying how great the Fixer is.  My guess is that someone is trying to unload some Fixers for inflated prices and wants to use these posts as justification to some poor sap.
---
Turns out my ps+ expired, so I couldn't check. Go ahead and give them to others who need it more. :)
---
&gt; Personally I don't think there are many weapons with a higher dps than handmade/fixer except the plasma gatling
---
Personally that's a lot of nonsense you're pulling out of your butt
---
A Brahmin boss? That would be udder madness.
---
Google fallout PnP 2.0 for a solid effort to bring fallout 1 &amp; 2 to the tabletop.  It will answer a lot of questions about why you dont seem to do damage, especially at range.
---
Also you may find that your unarmed chance and damage is significantly higher than ranged of any kind. Especially when you use targetted attacks (vats).
---
Well with the radiation you wont go over. If you dont build this person right youre gonna die way more then you already are lol. I got mine pumping out like 9k damage but at a cost of a sneeze away from death lol
---
I'm always low on cores...hard to find them
---
Or a switchblade.
---
Are you sure about that?
---
Real enemies dont respawn
---
No lol.
---
It should also protect from water borne diseases
---
No. I didn't know about it for a bit there.
---
If you've played sekiro I'm envisioning something like the blazing bull, but scorched. Just thrashing about and bashing people with 4 horns
---
My bad :P
---
No, I've managed to get it to work here an there but it still doesn't work at some points :(
---
"You were wanted." does explain everything.
---
Heavy guns and power armor go good together. I run bare arms and my 20 heavy weapon's all weight 1-3 lbs.
---
Ewww, you're new to Fallout.
---
On a serious note, you could very well be the only player who didn't know this, no offense.
---
If you want more people to visit your camp, the major cities would be best. Near Watoga for the people who hunt Queens for a living, Flatwoods for the new players (or new characters of old players), Morgantown, Whitespring, Harper's Ferry, Berkeley Springs, Pleasant Valley etc.
---
Charleston and the towns in Ash Heap are pretty much deserted, not many people going there for fun.
---
Well thoes of us on xb1 dont have that manny issues compaired to pc and ps4 once the crossplay goes live.
---
I’m on Xbox as well, I rarely get lag when around people’s camp or anything
---
\_THIS IIIISSS GRAAFTON'S MAYOR, WIITH A PRIIIORITY MESSAGEEE\_
---
Do you know about searching with perks like Pharma Farmer or Butcher's Bounty?
---
An emitter? What did you place? Or is there an actual item called a radiation emitter to place?
---
Yeah, fingers crossed they realized they needed to make a serious overhaul of the concept and after Wastelanders is well established and keeping everyone busy they do something with that.
---
Last time I got a wanted status (accidentally), I had to beg someone to kill me.
---
I really enjoy it. I play it almost every night. Taking a vacation currently so I haven't been on in a few days. It's definitely a limited amount of people that play it. I tend to see the same people in the lobby.
---
I genuinely hope they keep the game mode. It's the only thing that's kept me around til wastelanders. I can only drop so many nukes and farm so many times before losing my mind. Joking, of course. In all seriousness, it's my favorite battle royal. The only I really enjoy playing.
---
The item has no tangible value, outside of it's cosmetic use. Temporarily storing 15 food items doesn't help you in any meaningful way. You're getting caught up with semantics.
---
How about mechanical pump you can stick im the grouns that collects DIRTY water. Or better yet, makes boiled water?
---
Same.
---
Make sure you use up all your perks before 50th level as you wont be able to gain more special points after 50th level. But you will be able to move them around after 50th so you can change your focus if you get an amazing legendary weapon.
---
I think I did this up to level 30 or so. Bought a repair kit with atoms I had earned and then realized the whole time I could have been fixing things at a workbench. It’s not really covered in tutorial that I remember.
---
Chameleon still has a benefit in PvE, in that also makes you harder to detect by NPCs. It's just obviously much better than the other effect when it comes to PvP.
---
Ave, true to the queen
---
Do you have a m on mental to talk about our lords and saviors, the scorch beasts?
---
The events right now suggest yes, but, they just pushed back DOOM to next year, and have been just as quiet about Wastelanders since QuakeCon. Time will tell I guess, but I'm surprised that we are potentially well-short of a month out and we have next to no details on upcoming changes. I know quite a lot of people are concerned their camp locations are going to become no-go zones; it would be nice to at least have an idea of the 'scope' of changes Wastelanders could bring. Whether we are getting a lot of revamped areas or whether it will just be the Anchor Farm and Space station changed with additional spawn variation to other existing locations.
---
I fixed at workbench till the repair kits dropped then started buying them as there easyer to use vs hunting down balistic fiber all day. Not knowing if someone already farmed the area clear.
---
More like the mods you find in the world I imagine where you can attach them to one piece of kit and that’s it
---
Wouldn't you want lifesaving over autostim then?
---
you spent too few bullets.
---
&gt;The New Vegas ammosmithing as a perk would be pretty awesome. Give me Hollow Points and Armor Piercing rounds. 
---
At this point, it'd probably be OPAF.
---
Could always add more ammo options to the 2nd star of legendaries though. Explosive is pretty much the only one.
---
People have asked Bethesda literally 1000 times since launch to increase the CAMP budget. If they could, they would have by now. It's the way it is due to engine limitations. There are already super laggy camps, I don't want it to be worse. 
---
Leveling up does not increase camp budget. Players who have been around longer know what items take up the most budget (eg turrets, lights and other items with functionality) and use them sparingly so their camps look more intricate as a result.
---
My man i know i agree the item is useless apart from its cosmetic aspect, but it is not a cosmetic item. You still are using tangible and meaningful, two words that usually are connected to strawman fallacy. For example if i say this;
---
Game has many gamebreaking bugs, its barely playable at this point.
---
Would this be true? We know game has severe bugs but is far from an unplayable state; we know fridge is useless but its not a cosmetic item.
---
But all PA (T45\~X01) look the same with this skin. I hope Bethesda could make them different.
---
A bit of background, this was posted to artist Chris Ortega's Artstation portfolio (artstation.com/artwork/RYJVPy) and found by Wiki staffer Tagaziel. We obviously don't have this in the game currently, but this shows the ideas were explored during development. This could be cut content, upcoming features or something that never made it off the ground, so don't get your hopes up. Bethesda also lurks here, so i suspect they'll be monitoring your reactions to this post.
---
Fat fuckin nuts
---
What's the bloody point in playing if you're going to cheat?? FFS get good or go play something else. Cheating is for scumbags.
---
First thing that would happen is. Nuke the Interloper
---
If Bethesda was going to put its thumb on the scale, it would be for more rather than less.  No game company wants to publicly say “I guess there aren’t that many people playing...”. It’s not like a 50% discount costs them real money.  “Be careful.  We have to ration the one and zeros.  We’re losing $10 every time someone visits the Purveyor.”  They only lose money with giving away digital products if its a lot of data that has to be transmitted or stored (A LOT of data) or if they gave something away for free that people were going to buy.  Even then, it’s debatable because they are supposed to make money by keeping the player base playing.  There are about 10 mobile games that have revenue over 100 million dollars a year and all of them are free to play.
---
With survival mode gone and the PVP crowd lacking a home any bounty is pretty much a death sentence.
---
I just switch servers.  You get new animals to hunt and the spawns might reset. It’s rough when they want you to kill a radscorpion surrounded by 20 radstags like you’re gonna be able to hit it at all
---
There's more than just one play style you know. Power armour is great but has it's detrements. Such as cancelling out serendipity, my armour effects, and unable to use unarmed weapons.
---
Yes. Yes I am.
---
Yeah, I need to get more perk cards for making weapons weigh less! 
---
I also need to lookup how often I get a perk pack after 30.
---
I hope we can get a new DJ with the new npcs
---
I'd still argue that's the exception rather than the rule. I think most people would figure it out pretty quickly. 
---
Maybe on PC or XBox it's not so obvious but on PS4 it is. 
---
Like Ray Charles could see the Workbench Repair option.
---
They need to make a more fearsome deathclaw.
---
There are always good options around for weapons and armor:
---
- when you see player vending machines in your area check them out for bargains. Often as players level up they retire good armor and weapons and tossed them in their machine because they’ve found better.
---
- I visit legendary scrip machines at every train station you visit. Sometimes they don’t purge scripped legendary items immediately and you may score a nice item to use or sell for just the price if some scrip.
---
- I highly recommend grinding low level events like Leader of the Pack for chances at legendary items. This got me my first really good armor and a nice machete early, plus other reward items will drop like stims etc.
---
- make a higher level friend or two and team with them and see if they’ll shepherd you a bit. Great if they’ll share the “Inspirational perk card to help you buff up XP. Many are also happy to “pay it forward” and craft armor and weapons for newish players, just be respectful and offer materials and generally don’t  be a “leech”.
---
Going luck!
---
Human mole rats are the most terrifying things I've ever seen.
---
Don't bother, People get Them online
---
Very amoosing.
---
If you're looking for a group to hemp get you back up to speed, hit me up.
---
Sentinel Looch (Discord Looch#7529).
---
Pretty fun fight, hope we get some more fun fights like that one
---
Just wait. If the people get their wish granted, this game will just be like fucking Ark on pvE. Server lags at a steady 80 ping and spikes reach 250+
---
Some people are just plain hoarders and will make 50 foundation, 10 story buildings just because they can
---
I think people coming in late assume the worst about the game based on the reputation people give it online and just assume that you can repair weapons as easily as past games. That was the case for me, maybe it wasn’t for you or many others but I could see it being the case for others. Never said it was the “rule” but I feel like saying it’s the “exception” is also wrong, people don’t explore all the options in all the menus. Many people don’t realize they can rename their weapons and armor. Renaming power armor chassis to know which is which is a common thing I have had to teach people.
---
On a simply one shot vs one shot comparison my BE Handmade outperforms the BE Fixer on per shot damage every time. That being said ammo is easier to make and less costly to acquire with the fixer and the stealth bonus is super nice. If you’re going commando and burst firing then it “feels” about the same but you’ll expend more ammo with the fixer for the damage on tougher targets. Really though with a correctly configured Bloodied stealth commando build you’re one-shotting almost everything anyway so you could argue the fixer is better for the stealth bonuses. 
---
In summary having used both, I’ll say this:
---
Normal enemies: The fixer has the edge for the stealth bonuses it gives and easier ammo, you’re one shotting everything anyway if your build is done correctly. 
---
Tougher enemies like scorch beasts, sheepS, Queen etc: I pull out the handmade it has the edge with damage per shot and ammo capacity,
---
Let me know how it goes. I've been wanting to switch from xbox for a while now. But not having any cross save made me stupid with the xbox.
---
I will pay 100 caps to come and kill you for a 10 cap bounty, criminal scum!
---
I was making a lead run to the penitentiary, fully expecting the normal compliment of mutants. 
---
Imagine my shock as I round the corner and discover the entire yard filled with Behemoths! No less than 12 just meandering about!
---
The Brotherhood must purge mutant scum like that!
---
Advantage over who? If you're only hopping on a tiny bit every week you're still going to be behind someone who plays an hour or two.
---
Then you'll be shocked that this is actually the second post about it, because OP is not alone.
---
We also need more endgame bosses, fighting the queen over and over again is getting boring
---
I'd definitely be down for one that defends the camp or collects from crops for me.
---
I’ll check you guys out for sure. I’m just not super into the big RP clans. I’ve got a small amount of people on Xbox that I trust very much, and the big faction issues between each other was also what made me leave Xbox. Just the overall toxicity of people like The Beach Boys and stuff😬
---
So far it’s running smooth, clean, and excellent. Just gotta make some caps and get a nice bloody melee character going for farming, and I’ll be set on making money and stuff once I’m 50.
---
It’d have to be some sort of bunker-busting nuke, no? Like maybe fired down from Kovac-Muldoon (The orbital strike satellite thingy). 
---
A change of pace in the way you go about nuking things would be nice. Like maybe unlocking new wings of the enclave bunker, or using a free-states bunker to hack a satellite. 
---
That or... backback nukes. You gotta protect the poor soul who has to hike a heavy-ass nuke into that mine. Set a timer, then run!
---
I do feel you though idk why I bought this game on Xbox rather than PC originally. I couldn’t even play the game on Xbox for the first few months because it literally ran in single digit frame rates on a brand new Xbox one S.
---
Power Armour is pretty average, unless you're a heavy weapons build or have Strangler Heart. 
---
Armour with good Legendary effects is a lot better, if you're lucky enough to have a decent set.
---
It is interesting this idea that a player could turn on you&lt;OO&gt; and i understand it fits into the survival aspect of the game.  I am pretty new to the game and i have not joined a group and if i had the chance i wouldn't it could be more scary than surviving on your own.
---
I think it’s super great, but largely bc I like the looting system, the pinging system, and (at least for me) was just so smooth to play. Rarely any hiccups in connection.
---
I bought it on xbox because I had a few friends who where hardcore fans of the fallout series. I thought they would have stuck to it.
---
Understand completely. We are not big on RP, just BOS fanbois who help each other out I suppose. 
---
But I do have to say, we are relatively drama free and don't get involved in internet politics and bullshit. 
---
Also don't involve in faction "wars" like other factions.
---
One works while on the move. The other one doesn’t (chameleon)
---
I wish you could leave notes on your terminal other players could read
---
You do you man, experiment and find out for yourself. I had better luck with auto then lifesaving. Use a autostim with superstims, id rather take a definite autostim over a chance of being saved. Either way with bloodied that 60 second cooldown is a real drag vs 20-30 seconds when the superstim is countering damage
---
Cool! Maybe you guys are a cool group of people that are pretty chill. There’s a few.. interesting to say the least sects of the BOS on Xbox.
---
Well Virginia and Pennsylvania were already explored in Fallout 3
---
No. I found five of them though. Saves buying plans.
---
The plan for crafting it is bugged atm
---
Nope.  Never.
---
Are you sure you didn't pick them up from any other avalible stash in the world?
---
You could do a single event and have enough acid for a day or more worth of gameplay.
---
Doesn't seem like it.  They've brought back items in the Atom Shop and they did an encore of Meat Week.  Here's to hoping they do Faschnacht again too, hopefully with increased drop rates for the rare masks.
---
Pots for growing all the plants including chem ingredients.
---
Automatron workbench with bots that harvest crops and defend your camp.
---
Junk crafting station.
---
Urm... Are you sure about the shot per shot thing? Is this calculator wrong?
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Cool, I just read so many people talk about it and I didn’t think about it ‘till now.
---
Nope.
---
As a matter of fact outside Nuclear Winter - which is fair enough IMO, there are enough problems with people using Cheat Engine, we don't need to add mods into the mix of unfairness - we have been pretty much free to tinker with client-side stuff.
---
We can even edit the vanilla .ba2 files - this is how we load custom fonts - freely.
---
To date there have been no verifiable punitive actions taken on anyone for using mods. None.
---
Moreover there has been no animosity from the devs towards modding. They even made allowances and changed the way the vanilla files load when we hit an inherent limitation of the .ini files
---
Sadly I think this was the point of the entire game..
---
“Survival” not hoard everything like in fallout 4 and never touch it again cause you forgot about it. 
---
But I’m sure a small loud minority wanted more stash, more cap, more space in general..  
---
Old habits die hard..
---
Just browsing the front page of popular mods on Nexus is freaking crazy dude. I’m gonna have a hay day tonight. I thought I was going to bed, but not now.
---
The OP makes some very interesting and illuminating points. The damage cap and necessity for damage mitigation will no doubt surprise some. That VATS is no longer our reliable friend, equally unsettling. What becomes ever clearer is the commitment in gear, perks and tactics is considerable. With that commitment in mind, it's perhaps easier to forgive those who actively seek out PvP. Ultimately I'm left pondering what do I want from my build, Fallout 76 and perhaps gaming in general.
---
You don’t need the codes (items) to launch a nuke.You just need the decided launch code that you can get from the internet.People launch the nukes that way.
---
Silos are a good place to get all kinds of resources,you just need a lot of ammo and some decent guns (Having the enforcer perk and a combat shotgun turned it into an easy mode for me-lvl 55)
---
Oh no I agree 100% and I read all patch notes for games I follow closely, I'm just saying it's apparent that sometimes people fall off and miss certain key changes that's all.
---
I think at the very least vendor stations could be capped (as in each camp can have X amount, if this isn't a thing already) at let's say two but each holds 100 items instead of thirty. 
---
Whatever is in your vendor shouldn't count towards your stash.
---
This would be much fairer and still within the spirit of the game, as it were.
---
You are in for a treat :)
---
One stars don't drop two and two stars don't drop three.  Ones drop ones.  Twos drop twos and ones.  Threes drop all three.
---
yo sandman. just wanted to add . play syles and builds are diferent depending on the platform .. in pc you can stack nuka quantoms with lead belly and truh hiker (so you can carry 1k quantoms with you ).
---
or use traveling pharmacy and carry 300 super stimpaks and be imortal. (its what i do).
---
o and vats is pointless since most people just spam stealth boys lol.
---
In settings&gt;audio there is an option for whether you speak to people in the area or in team or muted. Might be y
---
I know, it seems to reset to mute on login. Only done it since 13 was released. Weird but not hard to get round. Usually keep it set to team
---
It's a feature
---
Camp budget will increase if you learn camp plans.
---
When I played it always dropped the correct amount of effects
---
I have 2 legendaries right now...I need to find more. Both are kinda crap.
---
Oh that'd be so annoying but it's just last time I did the raid I did it with randoms with now mic and they took what we needed to use to advance and didn't know how to use it
---
Junk ammo!!!!!!!!!!!!! Recycling rules
---
You could always make alts, each character has a scrip cap of their own. So you can transfer items w/ a friend or 2nd account and get more scrip.
---
:/ when i played they always dropped their star amount of effects
---
That would be even more annoying,
---
You can find two .45 submachine gun at Camden park. They are usually on the knees of two dead raiders on a sofa in the middle of the park. Sometime they clip under them. If you can't find them, server hop and you should at least find one.
---
It wasnt like that when i played
---
They did actually mention something like this before the beta, I can't remember which interview but they mentioned turning into a ghoul through exposure to radiation 
---
I wish they would include this for players but I feel if this comes it will be the new wastelander NPC's and not us
---
Suit yourself, I too work retail and I still love Christmas music. 
---
If I can play GTA:O since 2013 listening to the same songs on repeat, I can do it with Christmas tunes for a month or two. It also probably helps that the place I work sources the worst Christmas music and leaves the good ones mostly untouched, so I can unwind with Bing, Nat, Sinatra etc after 8 hours of the Muppets 12 Days and whatever pop trash “Christmas” songs came out in the last 10 years that no one likes.
---
I agree with you on the atomic shop part - hence my suggestion for it being endgame requiring flux or whatever - maybe a nice quest or something, maybe even a raid reward (built using vault steel) with a 'clean' atomic-shop version but it seems that Bethesda are more keen on ideas if they can monetize it.
---
A scrap station would be fine too, my suggestion wasn't just for an acid one - that's just what I need. Ideally you would have a lead one, iron one, etc. etc. All would take budget and / or maybe you are limited to a number of extractors so it couldn't be abused.
---
I know that wastelanders is just around the corner so we'll see if they add more endgame content with that but as it stands all there is to do is grind for better guns/armor and once you have it.... well that's it really. 
---
You can go the 'pokemon' route and find all the magazines or whatever but they don't provide any ongoing benefit. Having to save up for something like extractors to save up for would be great. As an example I'm not running the raids at the moment as it's not worth the resources. I don't use power armor much and I can't really solo the normal and hard difficulties due to the time limits  (which is terri-bad game design to be based around timers, even without the lag element but I digress) but having a prize like this would tempt me.
---
Exactly, i was going to put this lol
---
I don't do PvP myself unless a person is wanted, it doesn't matter if the bounty is 10 or 90+, if that person is wanted they are fair game lol
---
Not in my experience, but I’m only 1200 hours in.....
---
You sure you were playing 76? I don't believe it was ever like that.
---
In that case, Power Armour is probably better for lower levels until you get decent Legendaries. 
---
And you can can find chassis with some parts all around the map.
---
Probably the third.
---
I wouldnt mind a "share" option that lets you push perks to all characters (if they are shared).
---
It's under the trap tab. You need plans to make it.
---
Huh? Mischief night? Where can I find info on it? Idk how I miss stuff I literally play for hours every day
---
Nice! Thank you. Picked one up to mod it into a radio/prop. 
---
Thanks for the info
---
Bullets as currency makes more sense than bottle caps
---
If they where to do that, I’d prefer a separate station rather than mixing it in with the current radio.
---
Not so I can’t here it, but so I can put the radio in the unreachable (to everyone but me) room in my camp and leave it on the Christmas station the whole time. Don’t want anyone turning it off now do I?
---
PC
---
That's how it was on launch and for a month or 2 following it actually
---
Mix some stealth perks in there, one shot most things in the head. Don't get hit/seen. Done.
---
Yeah idk what all these other guys are smoking. On launch it was the number of stars the enemy had. 3 always dropped 3 and so on. After that they nerfed it and for some reason non legendary enemies would still drop legendary items. Then they patched that out and we got to where we are today
---
I just upgraded from Raider to the T-45 (mostly) I think. Just need a leg piece. I've been farming a place every morning when I get home for an hour or so for PA parts and XP.
---
i agree, id love to see some other options, like the Auto Doc. attached would be a terminal that changes what it does. including Full heal, cure Disease, Restore HP, Purge Rads, Heal Crippled Limbs. to compensate for the wider selection, i could see the cost of construction being high.
---
This needs to happen! I hoppe this catches Bethesda's attention and know that we want this as a feature.
---
Change your task manager to “stay on top” that way you can close FO76 without going to more desperate measure. Stable on my PC but I understand everyone is different.
---
I'm sure it'll be alright, when has Bethesda ever failed us before?
---
Shit I wasn't planning on getting on but I am going to right now. 
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
Thank you so much . Means a lot friend
---
What platform are you on? 
---
If you're on PC I can craft you a piece. 
---
It's usually 1 piece that you can never find to complete a set, which is usually a left leg.
---
Just make a ticket. Its possible that someone realy connected on your account.
---
I'm ok with the grind, have always enjoyed the rewards after bullshit, but I can see where you are coming from. I'm just making ammo and trading it for caps and then for armor and weapons, tho I know most don't do it
---
In my opinion, Top-Tier melee armour would be:
---
- 5 Unyielding pieces (Heavy Combat, Scout or Marine) with:
---
- 3 Sentinel
---
- 2 Cavalier
---
- 2 AP Refresh
---
- 2 Poison Resist
---
- 1 +1 STR
---
Bethesda : makes multiplayer games | also bethesda : let's not think of any features needed in a multiplayer games.
---
I swear skyrim together seems better made.
---
I kill a scorched everytime I see one and do all the "scorched invasion" events.
---
Ad victoriam !
---
I got it better than most in the bakery at around 1pm, had a really cool grandma coworker that was really into listening to that 'gangster rap' from her grandkids (she meant stuff like beastie boys and jurassic 5 but that was fine with me) wonder how old they were.
---
Ghouls first, please!
---
I wear that on my EXC ... and Blackbird on my X01
---
Happens to me all the time. I wouldn't mind if the animation to put the fusion core back in wasn't that long, and on top of that, it requires me to press A again to enter into the PA. It kinda sucks when I just log into a server and notice there's a SBQ fight going on already...
---
This is not a big it is a design choice
---
Jetpack and Marsupial Mutation are very handy when on Cranberry Bog for example, as that terrain is a pain in the ass to cross by because all the fissures, creeks, holes and stuff
---
I think it IS the Left Leg! I'm on PC. My ID is the same as here.
---
That would be awesome!
---
I'd kill you for the minimum which is 5 caps
---
Request sent. I'm on now. 
---
May be easier to tee up something on Discord though. Add me if you like - Looch#7529.
---
Will you be renaming items any time soon? Learn from that.
---
Favourited or atomic shop skinned items will not show up in some menus. Maybe collect all of the items from your stash to your player inventory (look at the weight) and vice versa.
---
Wish we could use safes different to stash. You can put what ever you want in a safe with a level three lock. but it can be locked picked and stolen. And make it so like theres a 100cap bounty to the person stealing it. And if you are the ower who gets revenge you get your stuff back but if someone else gets the bounty you lose your stuff, the person who stole it keeps it and the person who gets the bounty gets money
---
Do you have damage numbers turned on? Do you know approximately how much damage you did? From my experience this only happens when you haven't done enough damage to the queen. I believe the threshold is something like 1% of her health at minimum.
---
Just need to do more damage concentrated on the queen.
---
Pic?

Assuming Wastelanders drops their presence around the world I'll be glad to see them and their shitty loot go away. I've been killing them all week and haven't seen a single legendary one.

I'm expecting a full server meltdown as players new and old return but I'm optimistic that Bethesda will sort out the server side problems and it'll be a good release for wastelanders.
---
I did over 4hrs last night just blasting scorched.

---
Not of the blackbird, the Firebreather’s that you said you have on your excavator.
---
I had the same problem with no room having to stop playing after 2 hour (all full) but since the last patch I'm having a hard job finding even half the scrip per day (PC).
---
Edited, not fire breather ... firemans
---
I found the fireman one.

No, begins year 2 so the 14 of November, next week I hope there will be news
---
Yesterday I've been running through Big Bend back and forth what felt like all day, with switching servers in between. Got at least several hundred of the bastards. Gonna continue once I'm free in the evening so nobody can say the Enclave didn't do its part.
---
I make several Cranberry Delish and store half in the fridge. Profit IMO
---
The brotherhood continues to do its duty...
---
Sleeping heals you though
---
I needed this kick up the arse. I'm sorry my fellow wastelanders
---
Im pretty sure we all are
---
Anytime ive usually heard about people losing gear is when its renamed
---
don't rename your gear. on PC, rebind the reload key to whatever works best for you (I use T) and physically remove the R key from the keyboard. if possible, apply an atom shop skin to whatever legendary you're afraid of losing.
---
the vault raid bug has been fixed, supposedly. but on top of that you have mismatching credentials, possibly. which means someone who logs into your account by error could just delete your characters.
---
Bethesda does have the ability to restore lost things, from items to characters. their tools are rudimentary but they **do** exist. **they just refuse to do so**.
---
We freeze on console too
---
Yeah this would be ideal ish.
---
It's awful and it has been happening more often now too, at least for me. On top of the noise, it tanks the performance too, I'm on X1X and I can feel the framerate dropping to the 15~20 range, and the melee hit-reg becomes even more unreliable than it already is.
---
Brother..we salute you. You are promoted as of today to commander in chief..no longer an enclave general  ;)
---
What do germans think of shooting nazis almost every fps? Nothing at all.  It's a videogame.nothing important.
---
Brother I salute you. Still two days needed and I am full on too
---
Agreed. Keep fighting brother. We need an all out 24hr assault this weekend.
---
Well done brother. Keep fighting..we need a massive 48 hrs now
---
Brother..let's paladin their asses!
---
I'm currently at work :( I'll accept when I get home though.
---
What is the interloper???
---
I have one character like this. he is my "hard mode" character. he has 15 str and 15 chr for weight reduction perks and to share ironclad lv5 to the team. I have empath and no damage cards at all. I wear a horribly mismatched full set of weapon weight reduction gear and carry a LOT of gear and junk.
---
I love this guy, I call him "first book harry potter" because he isnt a wizard yet and he still lives under the stairs (my camp is dollhouse style built under a set of stairs). 
---
If I die, its VERY bad because im risking losing hundreds of flux, but im also extremely squishy because of the terrible gear and Empath making me take extra damage so im forced into a much more safe playstyle.
---
But I love the benefits of being able to share empath and ironclad 5 and it never falling off, its VERY good when shared with low level players or players in hazmat suits.
---
Pretty sure the communists in china banned this game along with many others. They have crazy restrictions...because theyre communist

How bout we get that outfit, huh?
---
an Auto Doc would be pretty cool
---
Bethesda rushed the beta which was admitted by Todd and I'm hoping that extensive dev testing of wastelanders will show that we dont purely over rely on beta for when this launches..that said, beta is the true acid test but Bethesda needs to learn from past mistakes, bugs and glitches. Server stability should by now show accurate online play numbers at peak times across the world so this should be factored in..as with anything new, it will always break but it's how prepared we can be, how hot fixes will need to be on red alert as for sure..there will be a mini apocalypse...
---
I do. I couldnt tell how much damage i was doing because the gun deals ballistic and explosive damage. I think there where a couple of 100s in that bumch of numbers.
---
The optimal "meta" set up for PVP is AAE Laser rifles with the beam splitter, backed up by Strangler PA (for Acid) and stealth boys (to avoid VATS).
---
Nice read for people that can't get ahold of Legacy lasers and raid gear though.
---
Dont want to dump on it, but missing incisor seems ... poorly chosen.
---
I'm hoping the thru hiker and enforcer and similar are place holders for other dps options / adds
---
I rename all the gear I use to be sure to not sell or drop it accidentally. I dropped some .44 and I was alone at whitespring train station, immediately after that I realized the armor piece was missing, I checked in the paper bag but it wasn't there. It happend after the classic "server not responding" issue so I guess somehow the game scrapped it.
---
Yeah but the flux are a pita to get.
---
To be fair Destiny 2 also went free to play
---
Because whitesprings was the main point of focus in FO76, where people who stayed and worked there lived for some time, people from all around would go there for their little peice of civilisation (like how all the players go there now for the robot traders) and at the rime of the war it was running a nuka cola promotion where bottlecaps would be accepted s currency.  
---
  
---
This doesnt explain why pre war money isnt accepted by helps with the caps)
---
I don't even use that because I was told it would mess with my mutations is I didn't have starch genes
---
Food heals you faster than sleeping, and Healing Factor makes moot point out of both.
---
Nah think I'm hanging my hat up after wastelanders. I really can't see them adding in stuff like this, I wish though
---
I lost 500+ scrip two days ago after a server disconnect. I had about 580ish on my main saved up. Got disconnected "server not responding". Log back in and go to the train station to turn in a few legendaries. Turn in 3-4 various ones.and look, I only have 120 scrip....wtf. I sure as shit didn't spend it,.I've been saving.  Thankfully my alt still had all his. But wtf man so annoying.
---
Well they've had a year of input to get their shit straight. We shall see....
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
Look that sounds like the shit nightmares are made from. IM IN!!
---
I've never had one hit me in the forehead but I have had several hot casings go down my shirt. .22lr kinda sucks but it's kinda funny but a hot 30-06 down your shirt sucks ass.
---
I was working in the lab late one night
---
It's easy enough to route the Arch power through a switch first, but not everybody thinks of that. I appreciate the arch but I don't ever need it, all my characters are bloodied
---
I built an actual bathroom for mine lol
---
Love this idea
---
What's the point of leaving ur camp if u could have 20 extractors making everything u need, u would never explore or risk taking workshops. I have almost 100k ammo in 556, 308, 10mm and 45. I enjoy the grind and taking workshops. This is on top of all the other stuff I grind for.
---
I think I know what the next Stephen King book is about.
---
There suppose to be incisor, it is on the video i probably mess up something when copying my build to nukes and dragons.
---
No. But I don’t think it’s the game’s fault. It’s your infrastructures fault.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/The_Interloper
---
I'm actually in the market for both.
---
Got the Scorched Plague? That's a paddlin by a Paladin.
---
Handmade at Lv 45: 45 Base Damage   
---
The Fixer at Lv 50: 48 Base Damage  
---
The Fixer does in fact have increased based damage, mostly because handmade's level caps out at 45. And you don't see a lot of high level players running around with fixers because they weren't in the legendary loot pool for months so no one cared about them and continued using handmades.
---
no but i did make a lovely spread on the park bench, only the cleanest of 200yo unwashed plates and uncooked yaoi guai meats for fawkes...
---
till i got into chems...
---
There is quite a lot of datamined stuff that never saw the light of the day, so im not surprised at all.
---
FOR THE EMPORO... heck wrong franchise
---
Knight Moreno to I guess.. No one?
---
FOR THE HIGH ELDER!!!
---
A little yeah. This game is like an old car that doesn’t go in to get fixed unless absolutely necessary. You’ll see more problems pop up before new patches are released.
---
Non-Hostile scorch beasts do occasionally spawn. I spot one around my base from time to time.
---
FOR NARNIA!!!
---
Bruh do you even recipe?
---
Non-aggressive ones appear from time to time, you have to start attacking them first before they'll attack you. I always just assumed they were running errands for the hive mind and weren't in kill on sight mode.
---
It's fucking on now, chaps.
---
So is it in game
---
Yep, look in the cavern near fort defiance
---
Well you then reap what ya sow..that's the game currently so it's very easy to say
---
Don't bother with that guy he could not care less let him think he is a comedian
---
A water fountain that fully hydrates you and slows your thirst for 20 mins.
---
What a response "don't die then" 👏
---
Thanks to you both for feedback. I’m just so tired of this happening for several months. What game have you EVER played does this much disruption to general computer processing / console processing
---
I’ve got a new scratch on my forehead from yesterday, so it was “ fresh on my mind”.
---
Let us list all the thing that freeze up the game!! 
---
Food/drink/chems/ ANY consumable used from EITHER the favorite wheel or the pipboy. 
---
Entering a new area that isn't loading. Yep just walking around. 
---
Muting and unmuting my mic.
---
Being anywhere close to another player in the raid reward PA set. 
---
Being close to anyone using an explosive ffr gattling. (so basically everytime I go to the queen) 
---
I have a badass PC. The problem is not on my end and I am so tired of not having events to do, people to play with, and bugs to tip toe around.  I've been shutting it off after an hour. There's nothing to buy. Every zone has been nerfed to shit. Ledge enemies are no where to be found forcing every single user to do what may be the most boring events I have ever "played" in a game ever. It's almost like the game is intentionally trying to drive players away.
---
Does the same when I equip my 50 cal.
---
Include gold in a pack of skins that include solid red, blue, yellow green and black for every gun. 800 atoms for skins on every gun come on bethesda easy money
---
I back this 1000%
---
All too exploitable: they will come with a friend who will immediately take the wanted status off them and hand back the bounty if needed. And if they gave us real safes, I'd hide those under a concrete floor und would have, what? Unlimited storage? Not going to happen.
---
No kidding. My character always has some kind of bandana on. I should have realized I didn't get the warning I was risking disease. Lol
---
That’s awesome. I would love to see that. Had to be hilarious!
---
YouTube is free.
---
Best endgame for me personally:  Increase the build limit and make my camp perimeter square so we can build next to people.
---
Nono you are right; Heavy Metal armor has the highest DR! But at higher levels there are (in my experience) 3 things that can kill you in this game:
---
- Poison spit attacks from Mirelurk King, Queens and Hunters: Hence the poison resist armor.
---
- Melee attacks from specific boss enemies, such as the Project Paradise boss: Hence the Sentinel armor
---
- Head-mounted laser attacks from high level Assaultron and the Imposter Sheepsquatch: explained below.
---
To avoid being killed by Assaultrons, you'l want to have a high Energy Resistance (ER). Metal Armor providea near zero ER. Basically the choice you have is to run Heavy Combat/Scout, and have excellent DR **and** ER. Or to run Heavy Metal and have perfect DR and no ER. 
---
You'll also want some ER to stand a chance against Tesla Rifles in PVP hehe
---
Except where the president is packing the courts with people who espouse his ideology. What media am I not supposed to be believing? This is all from the president’s twitter feed directly...
---
I recognize other countries are worse. I’ve lived in 5 and traveled to 21. That doesn’t mean this president is not dangerous.
---
I'm worried the DLC is going to turn the literally turn the community against each other. It's going to have us choosing sides, right? ..so fighting pvp instead of how we've asked to work together to restore the wastes and rebuild the land? I hope I'm wrong cause if that's the case, I'm done. Best part of the whole game is the community.
---
Taking more distance and trying a few other positions helped. Thanks
---
Probably not, we have people who can do it and don't paint it often.
---
How much are you thinking though? We're on PC.
---
A true Bloodied build!
---
By using autostim you're missing out on 3 STR levels from the missing unyielding piece though? Wouldn't it be way better to equip a level 1 Born Survivor Perk card? Essentially that 1 perk point enables you to equip all 5 unyielding pieces, which means +15% melee damage from those 3 extra STR levels.
---
Yeah, about workshops...
---
Hardly anyone uses them. If you need the shit, it’s probably there for the taking. If someone else has it and you feel like you need it, it’s much easier to just hop to the next server and claim it for free. People just don’t use them very often. They’re not a hot commodity. There’s no good reason to steal a workshop—not in this climate.
---
There are other ways to do PVP.
---
 You forget the value of a player hardly looking for the "dream" weapon or armor. I'll guess 6 out 10 players will stop playing this game once they find what they’re looking for. Okay, they’ll check out the new staff for a while...but then. Cause there's not much end game content until Wastelanders arrive and this gambling mechanics is a kind of insurance for Bethesda for not losing players.  
---
That’s also the reason why Bethesda slow things down artificially there indicators too:  
---
 \- CAP for Legendary tokens  
---
 \- CAP for the amount of legendary items you can scrap per day  
---
 \- 3 Star Enemies with no guarantied 3 Star Item (Even the Queen)  
---
 \- blanks aka guhl-slayer etc.  
---
 
---
the list can go on.  
---
Conclusion: Atm the game is a lottery and the risk that to many player turn into millionaires over night with that 50 % discount to grand that. (millionaires normally stop playing lotto).
---
The legendary effects I think should be removed:
---
Mutant &amp; Ghoul slayers
---
Mutant
---
Troubleshooters
---
Nocturnal
---
Hunters
---
Exterminators
---
There's probably more, but those are the ones I can think of that I'd like to see taken out of the game. Also please REMOVE THE BASHING DAMAGE LEGENDARY EFFECT. And also drills from dropping in place of a legendary!!!
---
and they will block next dem president ith the powers they have just as their peers are blocking this one now! :) democracy does not mean right/wrong, it means checks and balances. trump is not installing some vile ideology into US system, he is just appointing GOP nominees, which will be slowly replaced in 5 years. Cycle goes on, without bloodshed. dems =/= freedom fighters, gop =/= devil incarnate. its just another political party. This is the beauty of democracy.
---
and yeah he's been real lucky with that, already outdone obama by 2:1 margin in his first 3 years! dunno if it was luck or some error in obama's part (maybe he appointed old judges? idk I have to look it up my man)
---
I want a facepalm-emote. That's all.
---
How about just adding legendary effects to drills?
---
That's a great idea
---
SCJ has been an interesting twist, I don't think no one expected that. Ruth Bader is still standing though. Nonetheless that will be Trump's (or McConnells) unknown legacy for sure. 
---
These last 5 years the world has been reacting to something I guess, I'd wager its rapidly changing social environments and people's resistance to it. Animals dont like change. Every country I've spent more than 6 months now including my own one have embraced more conservative opinions. Oh and every single one of these countries had a toxic media that catered to extremes of a conversation. I've not lived in US for 6 months, but from what I can tell, you guys seem to have it too.
---
I agree with what you said, but I think OP to referring to the strange creature sleeping in Lucky Hole Mine (which I'm not sure is actually the Interloper, and not some mutant created from sacrifices or something).
---
It's a unique asset and very well hidden so easy to miss, which makes me think there must be something more to it.
---
Omg, you were saved by Captain Scorchbeast!  Niiiice!
---
I want the friendly scorchbeast to be my pet.
---
Try /r/falloutlore
---
Scorched slayer on a prime weapon is technically worth it . But let's be honest the reason those exist is to give value to the better and more desired effects. If everyone is running around with the current meta weapons this may as well be January 2019 with all the dupes running rampant.
---
I don't because I sell it. But it's always fun to go out and find legendaries. Besides, I don't stay at my camp often enough to farm it
---
I’m a weirdo and got my camp on a tree. I like the branches sticking through like that.
---
Yoo thanks for sharing OP. I like the idea of an NPC faction of molerat humans, hostile or otherwise.
---
Yeah i remember that.
---
I like this but the counter argument to that would be why would you ever use anything else?
---
Chameleon has no drawbacks
---
Marsupial is always worth it
---
Speed demon is always worth it
---
Ardenal reaction is arguably always worth it
---
Pick one other you don't mind the down sides for.
---
It was like that for 3 months after release
---
Healing factor, for me. Less stimpaks to use
---
I started playing from day 1 and quit about 2 months later and i can tell you it dropped always the correct amount.
---
And maybe you just can't be bothered knowing other people will do the dirty work for you...
---
Keen.
---
Thought about it. And tempting because I want a new character run through anyways.
---
I would definitely buy this, just for the black skin.
---
I have a ghoul slayer two star tesla rifle faster reload and its awesome at white spring. 
---
I totally agree though there's nothing worse than getting the exact gun you want but having a slayer effect on it since its totally situation based I think the only exception is ghoul slayer on the  right weapon as it  can be a great one time deal thats worth the weight sacrifice since ghouls swarm much more than most enemies and can be a nightmare to deal with.
---
I have maxed rifleman and commando perks.  I like being able to switch between the two for a change of pace.  Tank Killer is also nice to have.  If you are bloodied, consider radicool under endurance.  
---
I run max grim reaper sprint under luck.  That seems to mesh well with my character because a lot of my kills are in vats.
---
I think at this point we need to leave realism and in lore consistency at the door :) 
---
Besides, you could argue 'nukes did it' that works for everything else. Also it depends on your definition of a lot. You would have to have a rich vein for it to be worth building a industrial sized extractor, perhaps the amount produced in a camp would be deemed miniscule.
---
Also, I'm all for the upgrades idea... Infact it's worthy of its own post but that I don't think it detracts from this idea.
---
You sound like a criminal being sent to jail or shot in real life. You were wanted.
---
I used to be paranoid about diseases. But as a melee user who doesn’t use vats, idgaf about diseases anymore.
---
Being able to play pool or darts would be really cool. They’re really easy mini games to produce, and would add a lot of usability to our perfectly fine billiards equipment
---
This bug has been present for tesla and flamer in every patch since June (which is when I noticed it--it may have been present before that).
---
Nah man, you see that other post about the playable super mutant/mole man mechanic? Clearly this is an easter egg about playable ghouls.
---
&gt; The Fixer does in fact have increased based damage, mostly because handmade's level caps out at 45
---
That's a 6 % difference in base damage - easily made up for with a single perk card.
---
48 Base damage is a *lower  level* weapon.
---
Move out of the forest, man! The savage divide has some great views.
---
Again my counter would be this is beaten by any non Slayer effect (except stalkers and nocturnal but we don't speak of them :p)
---
*He dosen’t quite get it but he’s got the spirt*
---
Unless you lower the price to ur fellow wastelander
---
1k is less than total amount of scrap you can get now.
---
True. My AAE Handmade is a better weapon overall. (And stalkers and nocturnal are for scrip!)
---
If I can’t farm what else am I supposed to do?
---
*atoms
---
Interesting... maybe the way to do this easier would be to like, introduce a new Exchange area at the Whitespring. It’s made up of MODUS terminals, one for each player on the server. A player can build one in their camp, which wirelessly connects their stash to the Exchange, and they can assign items from their stash directly for sale on the exchange. Then all a player has to do is head to the Whitespring and look through the various terminals that are connected to every player on the servers inventories and buy what they want remotely.
---
Just a server wise auction house would work as a kiosk linked to each camp would work and be much easier to implement. But yeah great idea.
---
Life is hard when you're dumb.
---
This is a great idea. I dont want to be forced to have my camp around Whitesprings just to get some traffic.
---
I’m 100% sure we will see mannequins before this game retires. But when
---
I'm really glad you disagree :) I was after a discussion and people to change my mind :)
---
My counter argument again is... Mentality replace the slayer effect with, say aa (or any non slayer effect) and is it better or worse?
---
Definitely agree with the safe deposit boxes and sharing caps and stash among characters...not sure about the central venders tho. I like to check out players camps while spending caps and without vendor machines you can't see their camps unless you stumble across them while exploring the world.
---
Just have the Grafton mayor sing to us, he already talks to me every game.
---
For the mutants effect we are talking about that is not a drawback - it's not as positive :)
---
Man. I would pay 30k for a stash box on an alt character full of this stuff haha. I make a joke cause I need the same stuff all the time.
---
I imagine if faction pvp is coming, it’ll come as part of Wastelanders, since it’s introducing entirely new joinable factions. Would only make sense!
---
And BoS/Enclave stuff is DEFINITELY coming. They’re like two of the most popular factions in the entire franchise; hell, the BoS is Bethesda’s baby, they can’t NOT put them in every Fallout, there’s no way they don’t have content planned realizing what moneymakers they are.
---
40k
---
Me and my brother were talking about this yesterday.  It would help with pricing stuff for sure.  See what other people think prices should be.  Help some low level people not starve or die of radiation dozens of times right away lol
---
Now that’s something I would bid on
---
id love to be able to turn into a super mutant eventually
---
I'm selling a few, but can't find any under level 30. Low level players (between 5 and 20) always ask me if I have any suitable for their level, because they don't have any/a full set of power. I was going to craft some low level Hazmats, but I can't
---
I wish I could read it better but Jesus, yes. Please
---
&gt; OK ...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; DPS has nothing to do with stealth bonuses so I don't know why OK ...
---
DPS has nothing to do with stealth bonuses so I don't know why you're conflating the two
---
The fixer is just a combat rifle with 20% more damage and a bit of stealth added. It's a solid mid-level weapon - nothing more.
---
Lol sentinel looch 
---
🤣love you man
---
Happy cake day
---
We all have different value for items. But no matter what you will have the FotM items like junkies, junkies sucks compared to bloodied but it wasn't duped as much and is 2-3rd strongest affix thus making it have a great value. 
---
If next week some youtube tool decides that screw the math executioners is better then it will be. 
---
So while you say push value off to the second star and let us have move "useful" first star I say there are by far already high chances to have a great two star as bashing is the only real crap one. 
---
I say slayers has a place as both a junk filler to maximize "flavors"  and on occasion usefulness
---
It was only a 2 star.  No big loss.
---
Also re nocturnal, the only reason I don't like it is the weight issue and the fact that it is worse than non legendary during the day. But I'm not talking about nocturnal - I think it, as effect can be fixed/improved easily enough. Discussion for another thread.
---
“WOAH, WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE?”
---
I just aquired a junkies faster fire rate fixer from the purveyor, even without sneak perks it makes me super sneaky.
---
Wasn't impressed with non legendary fixers but it's surprisingly effective.
---
Cringe worthy.
---
Explosive weapons have there use in countering a melee build I’ve found the stagger can be a pain completely stun locking me before I can get close.
---
Great minds think alike? Lol
---
I'm on ps4. So your saying 120 per bulk cloth?
---
Sure at this point
---
I think there's a strong possibility they'll decide they let the pendulum swing too far like PvP'ers have been complaining about. But hoping we can chose to be Responders at least (assuming they would be neutral to factions, and "off limits" like IRL).
---
Yeah ur right.
---
Delete and reinstall it. Worked for me
---
FOR GONDOR!!
---
Better yet. I wish they would set up a simple algorithm that auto-suggests price based on average price sold for same items across the game.
---
&gt; Explosive weapons have there use in countering a melee build I’ve found the stagger can be a pain completely stun locking me before I can get close.
---
Yeah. The stagger has less to do with explosives and more to do with cards like Tank Killer, One Gun Army, etc. The AOE makes it so its easier to catch someone out of VATS running or moving I'm sure but its amplified because of these cards. Everything has its place and I was not saying explosives are useless. I'm saying people who are running around with TSE handmades and TSE shotguns and expecting to absolutely melt people are going to be sadly mistaken without a proper build.
---
I actually give it away to people who help me farm ingredients. As for lowering the price if ur on my friend list and need it I sell it half price if ur not then why sell it for the same price then what I can sell at vendor bot, I'm the one grinding for it ends up being a waste of time.
---
Yeah, which for me, is actually a turn-off because it suggests a game has every reason in the world go to pay-to-win.
---
A thousand souls to burn. 
---
Look into my eyes. 
---
Your souls are stained by the blood of the innocent. 
---
Feel their pain!
---
That's a great idea also, very cool idea thanks
---
I'm good either way cool idea thanks
---
Nocturnal Doesn’t work anytime it’s dark or during all evening hours. I was just taking about this with a teammate last night. We could be wrong but we felt the nocturnal perk kicks in at 11pm. Regardless it’s a very specific time limited designator.
---
Joining ya now
---
Yeah I had a camp there once and was destroyed by scorched beast 3 of them. Fun fun times
---
I do as well just feel it would create competition between vendors for better prices.
---
Would love it but not going to happen, by looking at the amateur crap they do like link everything to stash box we ain't getting one unless they charge us a subscription fee.
---
Or at least make use of all those ham radios you find laying around.
---
I want a robot workshop like in the mechanist and an helipad to call some kind of aumotaed helibird for more immersive fast travel like in previous fallouts
---
Terrible idea, people would start charging 150k for guns and it would be like the grand exchange from Runescape in which everyone just stands around the GE rather than playing the actual game.
---
Unsure if you got in time, but we just finished it. We are switching servers and I have an extra key card for later though!
---
Yes and replace that music for the intro music that sounds they have since update for battle royale.
---
Something I’ve done is just set my PS4 to record the screen when I know I’m leaving for a little and then stop it when I return. If I’m missing caps I open capture gallery and watch real quick then delete.
---
There's no trading on this sub. (Rule 10) 
---
Try the market.
---
Depending on how much time I have, I try to launch nukes daily.
---
If you haven't done all the at challenges for killing scorched with different weapons, it's a good way to keep track.
---
Getting 6 chr, with rank 3 Lone Wanderer and rank 3 suppressor (swapping out LW for other peeps like party boy/girl or quack surgeon) let's you share 2 perk cards with a team and optimize damage when alone.
---
Getting rank 1 in each type of rifleman perk should do well. You can also take rank 3 of tank killer, and a rank in sniper. Fire in the hole 1 will help with thrown weapon precision. Long shot might be good as well.
---
Adrenaline rank 1 will add damage to killing sprees. Action boy rank 3 lets you retreat or reposition often.
---
Bloody mess 3 gives you a big damage boost, starched genes for those mutations.
---
Blocker would be good for reducing damage when you get caught up with by a melee enemy, walking pharmacy 1 will gives you the ability to keep a few extra Chems on ya.
---
Gunsmith 5, for give, of course.
---
Aquaboy and fireproof 2 lets you escape anywhere and gives you a bit of defense against explosions (a grenade tossed your way will run a day).
---
[Here is the build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4936545&amp;d=sb0sg2pd0pk0pl0pp2p60pr0pj0l71lt2a00a72ic4c71cm2e00eh1&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
There are 20 perk/special choices for you to make, so you have some wiggle room to make it yours. This is expected to use lots of cover and not rely on vats, you can choose to add the vats perks or make it out for a bloodied build, or add a side specialization like pistols or shotguns.
---
Never thought of that sucks for low lvl players trying to get half way across the map just to buy some cheap stuff good thinking
---
Sorry I thought I posted to the market I’ll delete
---
I just missed it :( GT is Pork Sword 00
---
[removed]
---
It's to keep players logging in everyday I doubt they will change it and if they did it wouldn't be a huge increase, probably like 300.
---
Nooo :( well I have another card and we'll be doing it later!
---
Make an instanced suite at the whitesprings, and have it cost like, 5k caps to own. Then you can have a sweet-ass house, as well as a camp, and your companion(s) can just chill at the suite. Also, make it upgradable with different utilities like the megaton house, and add a robot butler that we can rename.
---
Voila.
---
My guy is level 3 or so,  but I'd love to have the set for when i hit 25.  Let me know when you're going to play and I'll go online. Thanks!
---
Hey, drinkall97 I'm looking for informations about FO76, I'm a big fan of Bethesda  but I can only read commments about the game telling that it's a f\*\*\*ing joke...
---
I love MMORPS and Fallout. Do you think the devs are going the good way to improve this game. Or I have to pass my way ?
---
I’d be down to run it later today around 5 pm eastern time, 105 here
---
 Sweet. I will
---
I actually run a junkies build and like it due to... not dying so often but I think I could be convinced to go bloodied - topic for another thread :)
---
My argument is:
---
A) there is too much rng the game and its frustrating for everyone. I can't see how they could re engineer the game to not be so rng based without breaking it entirely, best bet would be to reduce the pool of unviable weapons. 
---
B) A situational weapon needs to be either so much more effective than alternatives that 'gearing up' for it is worth while. When you kill a mob in one or to shots with aa, twoshot, even mutants... well there is no beating that. But perhaps that is a problem with the game difficulty in general. 
---
I'm not saying that there won't be fotm weapons, but if I went to the purveyor and got aa, ts etc I would be happy (well no but you get the idea) but if it was slayer one I would almost certainly scrip it. No matter what my build was. 
---
For me, I think weapon rolls should feel: 
---
Ok, better, best, wow
---
not crap crap, crap... Some time later if the stars align... amazing. Bashing needs to be removed OR be so big it becomes on par with normal melee.
---
i just want halloween camp deco so i can do up my house right.
---
Only if they include the hit, "Chally the red-nosed moo-moo".
---
+karma Nice!
---
Anybody who dresses like a commie is getting bullied. The only pre-war parents who bought that one hated their child. It was only made to identify possible Chinese sympathizers in the community
---
Nuka cola themed workshop :(
---
"It's just allergies" hahahaha
---
What exactly is the advantage of a Fixer to a stealth build? I mean it does slightly add to stealth but not a huge amount. With max sneak and evasive cards I can pretty much crouch walk to about 20 feet of enemies in power armor without them noticing - *without using a fixer*  
---
 The weapon itself is basically a combat rifle with a little more stealth and damage (48 base)
---
Worst of all you can't even scrap the thing - you have to drop it or sell it and good luck selling it.  I've had fully modded out level 50 fixers in my inventory for 250 caps and *no one buys the thing*
---
Need more proof of it's mediocrity?  Go to any decent vendor selling weapons and armor.  Now Try to Find a Fixer - you won't.  They don't sell - mid to higher level players poeple want more effective weapons. The fixer *is* a great weapon for low to mid level players but anyone above level 60ish starts to use other, more damage intensive, weapons.  It's like a starter weapon for legendary effects.
---
Sometimes I think these Fixer threads are made by someone who acquired the plans and wants to start buzz to sell his Fixers at inflated prices.  There is no *buzz* here - the vote count in this thread suggests I'm not alone in this assesment.
---
I would love it if we get clean variants of the halloween decor we can already see in game, as well as fresh jack-o-lanterns, and a candy bowl (basically a punch bowl, but for snacks) that you can put any candy/snack into.
---
Most you can hit for is 110. Depending on who you fight, getting that 110 can be easier or harder than what you output. This is based on their ability and setup to mitigate damage and why I would use concentrated fire, to guarantee these 110 hits.   
---
Its my understanding you can do MORE than 110 with one of the syringers. I've heard all sorts of weird stuff about syringer usages and have tested some and confirmed they've worked. VATS crits to body also ignore armor, but even non vats crit headshots ignore last I've tested.
---
+karma
---
I would really like a full black handmade rifle and fixer.
---
Dragon born shout for “Bitch, scream at someone else for once!”
---
True. Lord knows why any american kids would dress up like that.
---
Still would be nice to have in game though.
---
i have sooooo much Halloween candy saved up, like 1300 pieces currently, I'm gonna spend all day halloween wandering the xbox servers in costumes handing out candy. i can't wait lol.
---
Yeah, he sent friend requests to us and we did accept, and planned on gaming with him again.
---
It feels like he's obviously dealing with some stuff because at the time his PS profile said something to the effect of "Don't friend me, I'm fine alone." -- he has since changed that.
---
i was wondering about this too.  is it a function of stealth or luck?  (luck seems to spawn more random encounters of enemies fighting each other (until they become aware of your presence of course))
---
I agree with the other guy, how you gonna get a resource just anywhere?  water works because the water table is under us at all times, resources are only where there are nodes
---
I don't think Chinese nationals living within the borders of China are allowed to play Fallout games.
---
Thought it already suggest price not sure what it's based on but know when I go to add a item it brings up a price automatically what generates that do u know?
---
When I was low level in the early days of the game, I got ambushed by some bots. Low on ammo and health I thought I was super screwed when a scorchbeast came flying over the forest. But lo and behold, it decided to blast those metal bastards to oblivion while leaving me free to scamper away and live another day.
---
Praise be to the SB.
---
Im on xbox, so ill try and see you around lol
---
Nope. Events got nerfed.
---
I love the game. Now is a great time to start it because by the time you finish the quests and stuff wastelanders will be here. People get annoyed at the moment because there isn't much end game content but if you haven't started yet you'll be fine. It is leaps and bounds better than it was when the game released.
---
Which resource are you referring to?
---
As title says its alternative to bloodied, not everyone want to play low health build. Even tho it’s full health you have enough dmg to do everything in game (including imposter event solo). About thru hikers and good with salt i explained in video that those are crucial to get high dmg as food bonuses are amazing for melee builds.
---
First of: The central bank/safe deposit one i like
---
The auction house has been suggested a few times, however there are some downsides to it (just the ones I could think of right now):
---
\- camp visits would drop to a fraction of the current ones
---
\- prices would increasy massively for certain items because people are able to control the market more or less directly (its debatable thats a bad point tough ;) some people like their trading empires)
---
\- people would cluster at the auction house, which would decrease the "lived in" feeling you get out in the world, it would be mostly auction houses or events where you meet other players
---
It sure seems like it isn't, hardly ever see a legendary enemy.
---
lol that's a little disingenuous to say the game hasn't gotten better just because you're upset we can't proc Project Paradise whenever we want
---
Not really, still laggy and buggy, but now you can't just do events you have to wait for them to pop up.
---
One of their dlcs was a terrible quest to get a backpack if that interests you.
---
The other dlc was about a robot who likes sheep that ends in a battle requiring a team or the whole server to kill one enemy.
---
Player vending is cool, plonk a machine at your camp and load it with stuff to sell then your camp pops up on the map.
---
If you didn't enjoy it a year ago there's not enough new content to make you enjoy it now.
---
People say wait for Wastelanders which will be adding NPCs and new stuff to do, so I guess wait for Wastelanders.
---
Thanks for replying me ! 
---
I think the community is very good here. And your prove it :D.
---
So I finish  Fallout 4 DLCs and I will begin my trip on FO76 ! See you in game maybe one day ! Thanks again Drinkall !
---
It’s what I’ve been doing, and tbh it makes the game fun too. In all the previous games I’d hoard everything. 76 completely changed that and it’s actually good. I get to play the games without worrying about collecting every little thing.
---
For some of these comments : you guys want to be devs? You have my axe
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. It also doesn't go into any of the quality of life additions. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda games are
---
I can think of two right off the top of my head that’d be equally useful that i’d kill for:
---
-Disease curing station (an Auto Doc maybe?)
---
-Addiction curing station (could also maybe be an Auto Doc, or maybe something else)
---
I appreciate your perspective and passion.  We have friended him, and will continue to chat with him.  I understand the challenge of DCFS, we have had them called on our own kids, twice :)  In both cases it was just a busy-body neighbor, and there was no cause found.  My pref would just be, if we keep seeing similar behavior, to just find a way to ping the parents and find out if everything is okay.
---
If someone else has it and you need it, its better to let them be in the workshop, contest and take their bag. This allows you to also obtain all the items they've had and you'll have a workshop with the work already done for you in terms of defense and excavators in place with power, etc. I don't farm or have farming routes but I can tell you there has been countless times I've come up with thousands and thousands of pounds of junk using this method.  
---
Bounty Baiting, and Low Level Baiting are some of the easier ways to get PVP, as "Food Builds" prefer to beat up level 20-40 characters over fighting someone in their own level range.  
---
I prefer to fight anyone, regardless of level. No one should feel safe. Thats my gameplay approach and let us remember its just a game before anyone takes it on a personal level.
---
any or them, yeah let me just plop this acid extractor in the dirt and make acid magically appear...  like I said, water works because the water table, or the water deposit if you like, is everywhere, just have to dig deep enough, whereas oil, gold, lead and other resources are only found in random pockets, that's how it works irl as well as the game.
---
No worries. Drinkall97 is my Xbox gamertag. Hit me up if you ever need anything
---
"ends in a battle requiring a team or the whole server to kill one enemy"
---
You make that sound like a bad thing. That's end game content. It's probably the best event in the game
---
You paid 10K for plans in order to be able to Purveyor-scrap maybe 50 to 100 more legendary weapons until you get ... a legendary fixer - which may or may not have the legendary perks you actually want?  
---
Well that certainly sounds like a good deal ...
---
what makes you think they are going to be perks?  I think they are going to be more like legendary effects
---
Can’t brother, got a paper due. :(
---
i even have a few tricks up my sleeve for those who don't play along heee
---
Meanwhile pretty much everyone has TSE weapons, etc. You want me to say TSE have all been farmed legit as well? If your complaint is the gear and the fact its been 'duped' everywhere, then why don't you have a set by now?   
---
This post explains how there are methods of countering and it fell on deaf ears by people who would prefer to hate an entire section of the player base instead of take the knowledge being thrown out here at face value. And yet we're always the toxic ones.  
---
Pot, meet Kettle.
---
Sorry didnt know about that that would suck
---
Sellers choice is right bud, albeit a terrible one
---
Bethesdas way to make the grind longer and calling it content or maybe reason for scrip kits in the future, you can never tell till it hits you like a bag of bricks.
---
Now you are talking sense
---
I would certainly welcome a single "peoples" vendor at a central location like Whitesprings. I'm not sure I'd enjoy visiting a separate vendor for every person on a give server though at such a location but it would be cheaper than fast travelling to each base. You would lose out on the chance to tour other player establishments though. I do enjoy my tours.
---
AntAgonizer costume. We’ve already got a bunch of Unstoppables costumes and the Mechanist costume, why not bring back this one?
---
‘Pumpkin King’ outfit: What I’m picturing is like, wood armor with strangler vines wrapped around it and a jack o lantern as a helmet.
---
Sickleman costume. We don’t know what he looks like, just that he exists. I’d love an outfit for him.
---
Why not let people “rent” store fronts already in game at top of the world?
---
Well, they are going to be on your character and not your equipment, so I'm assuming they are going to function more like perks at least in that regard. They could have effects similar to those on legendary equipment though. Having a permanent cavalier ability would be pretty nice.
---
What else is there to do in this game that doesn't involve what you just listed? You basically said for them to not play as much which is exactly what they are already doing as a result of the cap.
---
Yea 50 scrip less as 150 x 7 = 1050 but even then I would like to grind it all out in 1 day then come back the next week.
---
So a warlord has 700 hp, 135 ballistic resistance and 80 energy resistance. Let's make it hard and use ballistic weapons, and let's say we are doing about 100 damage per shot.
---
An AA weapon makes the income damage reduction go from around 53% to about 40%. This means the damage done would be 60 instead of 47. Take the same guy and make it mutant slayers and you get a 53% reduction on 130 damage, that's 65 damage.
---
So in theory a mutant slayers gun that deals 100 damage would kill a warlord in 11 shots, while the as would take 12. Over time, or if you need to reload, that extra shot might be useful.
---
Bethesda should fix F76 first.
---
An AntAgonizer costume would rock!
---
It’s probably going to be rough for the first week or two. I fully expect a hotfix or two. But I’m not too worried about it, since it’s going to change the game so radically this is like, the one time I’ll forgive them if there’s some bugs and issues.
---
I just do my daily/weekly atom challenges every day to save up for cool stuff, personally speaking.
---
It’s just a preset general price made by Bethesda,  not based on market price.
---
I'm down :) Gt InfamousPM just sorting my inventory atm
---
You don't get any warning as to how hard it's going to be, no message saying "this enemy deals more damage than the Scorchbeast Queen on steroids and you need to activate all 3 life draining pylons to do any damage to it", pretty much everytime I see it get started the player is under level 50.
---
Also the loot table is terrible, a white hat, sheep pajamas and an actual sheep cosplay. The best thing that it drops is a plan for a gun the was only recently made useful, the fixer.
---
I see ur point, yeah I have posted this before and only got like one response. I'm sure ur right about prices, but I guess in my mind like with serums even tho u can sell them to a vendor for 500 u still see players selling for well under that price. I also dont see it as a auction house more of a flee market where vendors sell their wears. I also fell u would get a variety of items. U see players who concentrate on a few main items u get a group of those players selling the same thing could cause player to diversify or completely change their inventory. Another feeling is low level players would have better access to cheaper items. I do see ur point thanks for the comment
---
My bad I thought I bought a Fallout game not a Fortnite(Battle Royale)/Ark(Survival Game) knock off. You enjoying the constant chore of feeding your Tamagotchi rip off survival mechanics yet?
---
It’s been happening since launch, there’s never been any strange activity on my characters, and it always works after a few tries.
---
Lol, socialist governments don't work like that. Do they even see Reddit? Honestly, I don't give 2 craps. But I don't want to see 100 Chinese hackers per every 1 serious player.
---
Ok lol. Your winding me up right? You do know that irl there aren't just acid 'Wells' dotted about the place?
---
I'm sure you can't be suggesting this game even vaguely represents reality? Gigantic bat's firing sonic waves at you OK, snaligasters, aliens etc all ok - but a magic machine which produces acid, na a step too far :p
---
But really you could say it came from decomposed bio matter. Gold, trace amounts, iron lots of trace amounts :p maybe a nanobot goes out and finds it... There are plenty of ways they could justify it. Or maybe not just have it as a thing which happens and not question it too much and worry more about the gigantic bat's with sonic shreak attacks :p
---
Nice one mate its great when little twats like him get what they reap. I don't mind the pvp element to this game but i do hate little trolls like him who give the pvp community a bad rep
---
A silver SMG skin so we can be a proper Silver Shroud.
---
As an enemy, a mole rat king is nightmare fuel.
---
I hate those things as a sniper.
---
cool suggestions, i'm very much on board for #4!  
---
altho technically im sure its much more PITA, id like to see: lfg tool, deck swapping, and, as always, moar stash.
---
seems like they are still making effort to tweak what/how/who they want to make this game for (pleasing everyone will please no one) but hopefully we've passed the stage that for every step fwd there were 2 back.  i may be mistaken, but fans of the fallout IP tend to be older, smarter, and have more disposable income, so trying to cash in on the kiddie market won't work; getting the grown up FO fans to [indoctrinate their children](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4433-CUSA00744_00-KMP0000000000009) however, is another matter 
---
\#5, if they want to make global events (that the whole sever shows up for), theres all kinds of game improvements needed.  (super choppy when more than 8 ppl show up somewhere).  making the events level appropriate (eg prime cuts).  however, from what i understand the new system is to help reduce load on the server, so it may be here to stay
---
  how neat would it be if there was a server wide benefit for successful completion (ala people's soup glitch)?  for example, successful completion of arktos = stimpaks are x% more effective for (time until next event), where x = # of successful players
---
Yeah I enjoy seeing what players build very cool understand that point. I guess I picture a market like in FO4 in nuka world but having maybe 2 vending machines for each player and u can dress up ur shop any way u want with a budget of course. Thanks for the comment
---
Just to correct your post on vault raids. It's not a gauenteed armor reward. 
---
You get a plan for a piece of armor when you complete a raid on standerd or novice. It is gauenteed untill you have the plans for 1 full set, 33.3% chance of getting a plan from a set, so once a set is complete your chances go down.
---
You get steel from the raids, 2, 4, 6. From novice, standerd, expert
---
Each piece takes 10 steel (with armourer) power armor takes 27 (with power Smith)
---
Well thats weird. I have never seen a report of a bug like that. I think you still should make a ticket to Bethesda to ask if they could do anything about it.
---
Well it aint working well based on number of disconnects I get during scorchbeast queen fights.
---
Thank you so much! I forgot that planning website existed &amp; I didn’t know backpacks were a thing!
---
My current armor rating sits around 240DR 190RR. New armor will definitely help! Ima get on this after I get back from the Zoo today!!
---
I do it for the guaranteed 3* enemy with more possible spawns. I've spent over 100k caps on it. I don't even have the mutation recipes, I should take a break from Encryptid lol
---
I'm eager for wastelanders to arrive, but also worried that it will arrive in typical buggy bethesda fashion. If they don't get this right, the game is likely going to flush itself down the toilet. If it wasn't for hardcore fallout franchise fans it would have likely gone down already, and I'm not sure how much more trash the community will put up with.  I truly hope I'm wrong.
---
Always wondered thanks for the info appreciate it
---
Hello, sir! Do you have the player name so we can all go for a tour?
---
Ttue about the damage but they're super good a keeping the beast stationary. Almost like a stagger effect. I have found it helpful for finishing them off.
---
Too true, i knew he wasn’t gonna fight back so when I realised where we were while he was doing his little troll dance it felt like all my Christmas’s came at once lol
---
I just killed four during the SBQ I just did, not including the queen. Six pieces total from the event.
---
82 scrip in five minutes.
---
More reason to add option to be raider again, don't like prices then blow up vending machine. Don't like not being able to access workbenchs inside the house then blow up door. Don't like floating camps then nuke it.
---
Depends on survival vs damage and personal choice. I have a bolstering powered chest piece and the rest are unyielding powered, one arm has +1 S and the other +1 A. I swap out the bornsurvior perk as needed but always have on the one where stimpacks work better and most of the time rely on my own timing for the stimpack
---
I get this at my camp too as of late.  Not sure why so many griefers out and about.
---
So in anticipation of this...I've been loading up my vendor with full costumes. Witch and hat, skeleton and mask, etc. And some role playing ones, mechanic suit and hat, etc. Hopefully will get some sales.
---
You may have a point if you were only fighting warlords but, depending on your playstyle wouldn't you prefer aa vs no benefit when you get jumped by a load of mirelurks? You would need to be killing them in 5 shots to be even remotely worth it. But even then think most would go for aa. So do you think the slayer perks need to be modified not removed or do you think they are OK as is?
---
the extraction process and the deposits themselves do not work or look like they do in game, but the principle, you ignorant fuck, is the same, water everywhere, oil on in pockets...  and giant bats fit the fucking lore, extracting resources from anywhere doesn't...
---
I really need to stop replying to dumbasses...
---
That's crazy, I think most I've ever seen was 2 legendaries and the SBQ
---
Well played sir, well played
---
I am always interested. GT SaltyMcNultey
---
I can only imagine the look of surprise on his face when he realised what was happening. It just baffles me why some people act like that i can understand the pvp urge. But to do that to someone's camp and just run when the other person goes after them? It really shows what your dealing with my guess a little kid probably or i hope because if its an adult they got issues.
---
I just mean, that the sentinel effect does not work when crouched.
---
Wow never thought of that, that is a very cool idea, dont like idea of paying o do it but like the location might be a bit difficult for low level players to get to. I like the location kinda already set up for it.
---
I got this last night from Encryptid.
---
Either that or a YouTubed lol
---
Just thought of something, how about a wall of player vendor cathode ray type monitors with the face or icon of each active player? Something like the bots and terminals in Fallout Las Vegas?
---
Central vending idea sounds interesting but would reduce camp visits. 
---
Possibly have it offer you access to stores from people not on your server instead? 
---
Definately against the idea of a central bank or stash transfer though. Both those ideas would help the high level constant players with 5 characters and hinder any casual players. The current cap limit and stash limit would be multiplied by 5 and create higher prices. Its bad enough people are already pricing things well above the one character cap, this would just encourage it.
---
Well now you do get a warning that its hard. And it tells you on the loading screen to activate the pylons
---
I have a nuclear keycard if you want it,im not going to use it.
---
I mean we already get 1/10 taken off from sale at our vendors. They can use that as rent imo
---
Either way he got what he sewed its great when little twats like him get a taste of their own medicine
---
I think they're good in cases of knowing what you're getting into. If you know you're gonna go fight s ton of mutants or ghouls, a slayers weapon would be optimal, likewise exterminators would be good vs bugs or Lurks, and hunters vs animals.
---
I think weapons that are good all purpose will always be more popular, but the specialization effects will always be more effective if you plan out your exploration beforehand (knowing what you're about to get into and planning accordingly).
---
What about Free States? 😧
---
Disease destroying chamber
---
Sounds kinda cool, I love new Vegas that game rocks
---
OK, calm down no need to get abusive because someone ribs you for not thinking it through :p
---
If you find it step too far then fair enough, for me nah. 
---
Also your wrong about the water if plants can't do it the no amount of magic machine will :p 
---
As for oil, have you heard of rapeseed?
---
All I'm saying is that I'm positive that a lore friendly explanation could be dreamed up. 
---
Peace man.
---
My only guess is boredom, but man it’s so petty.
---
I'm gonna take a guess and say you and OP play on console, you see console is full of 12 yo brats that play Fortnite and COD and Madden.  PC doesn't have nearly as big a troll problem as console.  sure you get one or two A WEEK, but that's it...  I rarely run into trolls, like 99% of the people I meet are chill af
---
Thank you very much but luck played the biggest part
---
I didn't know you guys had came out of your bunkers, praise the lord and pass the ammunition!
---
it took 10 days to get 8 mil, I doubt we hit it
---
Interesting so would you be in favour of a damage buff.
---
I can understand that. Thanks
---
Well you guys never wanna play with us. Lol
---
Not with that attitude, at the very least we can still try
---
The whole point of the game is to rebuild America, not to rebuild a neocapitalist society.
---
That would be nice, it is too damn easy to catch a disease.  I have 1 piece of armor with environmental resist and 2 in vaccinated band still caught shit all the time.  Gets old.
---
Sorry but your bunkers have a bad fungus infection and well you guys kinda smell funny, just saying
---
I've played with the idea in my own camp, I made a large market hall with individual 1x1 rooms with one door and a bar on one aide, multiple lines up each with a door and a stash box so that player vendors could set up
---
No matter what people say the Stangler Heart power armor set is fantastic. Best pa in the game. Same resists as ultr, but better rad. And make all your attacks deal acid dmg.
---
As for weps, no longer attainable, but are available threw trade, exploding gattling plasmas are absolutely insane. My BE is crazy, VE is great when at full health.
---
...and let people into those hand-scan locked rooms, would love to know what shenanigans are going on inside those
---
My camp is over by Tygart water treatment, and I get plenty of traffic.
---
This idea is uniformly terrible. The game isn't about vending, and I sure as hell don't want it to become that.
---
You’re seriously over level 1k. How many hours of gameplay is that? Highest I’ve seen was 500.
---
I think the system is fine, they just need to adjust the cool downs.
---
Ya but I have all the video game holotapes and I have lots of stockpiled food and weapons and armor and ammo. Oh oh and I have some Power Armor you could borrow maybe if you wanted...but only if you come over.
---
Uniformly terrible idea. I have zero desire to watch people play Capitalist. And that's exactly what 76 would become under this scenario. No thanks, extremely hard pass on this very bad idea.
---
Noo, I lived down the street from Summerville for a long time. Can confirm there aren't any better spots. It's central enough that traffic shouldn't be an issue, I think.
---
&gt; The fixer is currently the best rifle in the game
---
Really?  Better than a TSE or a bloodied or a two shot furious assualt/combat/literally-anything-else gun?
---
Well all rightly then .....
---
Whenever this player hub idea comes up, people seem to forget that many players under level 30 may not have travelled to the Whitespring yet. Putting a vendor hub in anywhere other than the Forest makes it a high level only feature. Secondly, that place will most likely become a griefer’s haven since everyone will flock to it. Personally I like the current set up because I can check out what people do with their camps.
---
Yeah.  Grab a bloodied fixer and a bloodied any other gun and the fixer wins
---
You mean like the hand pump?
---
Well on xbox anyway it dose just fine. I have run 5 sbq since completing my set. With no dc. And not noticing anyone around me dcing. I also run an exploding gattling plasma, so if anything is going to crash it, that'd be it
---
Hopefully more carry weight i never have enough
---
I'll see, maybe I'll stop by next time I'm in your neck of swamp.
---
the first goal was 8M, then they hid the stretch goals, something they didn't do last time, then when they revealed the last stretch goals it was 15M away from where we were, nearly double the original goal, they pulled this shady shit on purpose, they set the last goal just out of reach intentionally.
---
*cough* whitesprings bunker atrium *cough*
---
Lmao glad to see my example food build being put to good use
---
Why though??
---
Hey sandman, i really like your videos, you and clowndaddy open my eyes about pvping. I was goin to give up for this game, cuz i ve done everything, wich is pretty easy, but pvp is what keeping me log in now...and scraping legendaries  offcourse. Its really fun and you never knows whats gona happen. I was wondering are you planing to move to pc? Im sure youll get a lot of fun, friends and foodbuilds to wreck.
---
You know there are legendary ones now right?  Those sell for often a lot. You are not seeing them in vendors since they are new and only drop from the purveyor as of now.
---
Well every society is built on trade one form or another. I have skill to build a house u have skills to bake bread, I trade with u and build u a house for a Yeats supply of bread. Might sound stupid but society was built on barter good or bad. It's really those looking to take advantage of people that ruin capitalism. I want to even out prices in the market and get players to diversify what they sell how many players sell berry mentats I use them all the time and never find them in a players vending machine so what did I do I bought the recipe and have started making berry mentats to sell because I feel there is a need. I dont see it as evil and sorry u see it as a bad thing. Thank u for the comment tho appreciate it
---
I think a damage buff would make them a bit too strong. If you put it in the context of perks a super mutant slayers gun is equal to all 3 base damage booster perks for that weapon type. A ghoul slayers is equal to a rank 2 damage boost perk. Having a free 2-3 perk points vs a specific enemy type is pretty good imo.
---
Beginning of the beta until now. Day in day out of no-living ;)
---
If you get good weapons you'll rank up really fast. Every 5-10 lvls I think.
---
I would like to get a pick with you lol
---
Actually I live on top of a mountain facing Wavy Willard’s lol
---
Top of the world would be perfect.
---
FOR THE HOOOOOORDE!
---
Hah, I got both! 2 sets of Strangler Heart PA. 2 BE with Faster reload Gatling Plasma! With another BE Gatling Plasma having some other random tertiary effect.
---
A pick with me? What do you mean?
---
One that burrows in the ground and appears behind you?
---
Pretty sure that guy is on a list at the ATF offices.
---
I might have been to ur camp, I've also seen individual 1x1 building built with vendor chair and stash box. Now I'm feeling like this might not be a good idea, when would u see players homes. Thanks for comment very cool
---
Hmmm... How about a damage nerf for the others then of do you think fine as is?
---
I ask because I think aa is 'roughly' 30% buff, twoshot is 30% (with accuracy drawback). Etc. Just doesn't seem 'worth' it over alternatives in any scenario. But I guess that's subjective
---
In ESO the markets in the mayor cities are bid over by the guilds, and the winning guild has rights to the market stand for a limited time. While market stands outside the mayor cities function the same way, they dont get as much traffic. This is mainly what moves the economy in ESO and I believe this can work in Fallout if certain changes to how items work at a programing standpoint.
---
This. This is what they need. Best FNV mechanic ever.
---
Yes Xbox, PM me and I’ll get in touch with you later on, thanks!!!!
---
Lol, are you serious? 
---
That's just the beginning. I didn't want to fill the thread and i don't think Reddit gives me enough space to write all the crap nonsense Beth has done. Even within the last 2 months there's not enough room. 
---
Btw, also no more survival. So players are getting ganked like crazy in adventure mode. Don't take workshops, pve players are boycotting them. Only griefers are using them like bait. Random attacks on players is on the rise, again. I can go on...
---
Attached is my build. I swap out evasive and dodgy for others as needed. When i want more damage i swap out lone wanderer for party boy so booze kicks out more damage with 1 rank of tenderizer. If im on a team i throw on 3 ranks of temderizer with strange in numbers. I use the bloodied meathook w/ +1 S and fss so my perks in S are a little weird 😅

---
I don't know why more online games don't go the GTaO route, they have hundreds of game modes, not every online game needs hundreds, but surely you can handle more than 3, COD set the standard with story mode, online and zombies, and online has multiple modes within it.
---
tldr yes, we should have the ability to start a lobby for multiple PvP modes
---
No offense to the poster of this but what makes you think the developers have the skill to create this? Hell, they can’t barely raise your storage space with crashing servers. The concept you seek is found in actual MMOs with literally millions on line at a time. This is what 24 per server, with a fraction of that on at one time? They’re not even gonna consider this. Be lucky they gave you the option to even sell at your camp.
---
I know what he is referring to, sorry I perhaps wasn't clear enough. I just think the creature we see should remain mostly a mystery. I think to turn the Interloper into a monster for us to fight and kill repeatedly would take away the mystique and creepy factor of it. 
---
Remember the first time you fought a Scorchbeast in 76, now compare it to your hundredth. Scorchbeasts are now something I try to avoid as they're an annoyance, but I used to avoid them for fear of death.
---
I get it's shady, I'm disappointed in them, again. But I'm going to do my best and get a lot of xp and loot in the process. After it's over then I'll complain. They've dropped the ball a lot of times, it'd be nice to see them try to make it up to us. But right now I'm going to go cap some scorched, I hope you can join us.
---
Picture sorry. In game style.
---
Ah!
---
Unyielding for a bloodied melee build, bolstering for a bloodied ranged build, vanguards for a vampires ranged build,
---
Why 2 sets of pa haha? And you must be on ps4. Xboxs be plasma has +1 per. I'd love faster reload on mine lol
---
Not gonna lie, it would be kinda cool
---
Did you make that up or is that legit? Either way, best explanation I’ve heard.
---
Ah, OK, yes. Low level availability is a bit of an issue. The only reliable source of hazmat suits for low level players is Poseidon power station with that one suit on the roof and a few damaged suits inside the power station.
---
Interesting idea. I personally like the fact that currently it makes you get out and visit people’s camps. I love having visitors!
---
A place where everyone can have at least 5 items in it at a time. Some where in white springs people can search for anything they want.  SO each server would have everyone's Universal trade items. So some people wouldn't have to have a base or vending machine.  also a limit so there isnt 600 items it would be 100 if everyone on the server had a total of 5 each.  But it gives a way to show your best 5 items. to everyone.
---
Different characters. One heavy melee and one heavy guns special.
---
how is you reaching an unrealistic goal them making it up to us?  I get it, we all want to reach the goal, my point is the shady deed is already done, whether we reach the goal or not.  hiding the stretch goals and making the last goal nearly double the first is already shady as fuck, reaching the goal won't change that.
---
http://imgur.com/a/WpqSw4w
---
The only real excitement in this game is pvp.
---
And then have the old school leaderboards where highest scoring players input some three letter moniker.
---
What do you mean by aggregated the vending allowance?
---
And honestly, how many hours a day are you playing to get that 1400 caps?
---
Gotcha. Very nice
---
You can always play a different game
---
No pictures of me. There’s a reason why my true ign is anonymous! Sorry buddy.
---
I take the three power plants no problem, plus if you keep your extractors unlocked you won't have to care if people take your workshops. Pvpers who take workshops NEVER check extractors or anything, they're just there to kill you.  You can probably keep looting them if you defended them against the NPC enemies enough
---
I guess I dont see the difference as to where u place a vending machine camp or market people will still use it and buy and u will always have players who go from camp to camp checking prices. U already participate why not centralize it and make it easier for players to get to and find best price for what they want. Thanks for comment
---
Understandable. Worth a shot
---
"Hey, who turned out the lights?"
---
Indeed, it seems to be more of a PC related issue.
---
U can make it a no pvp zone. As for new player maybe make it the first visible map maker that they can travel to when they have the caps and it doesn't have to be whitesprings, Charleston is not a bad place to get to at a low level. Thanks for comment
---
Im not sure about hundreds of game modes but I think we need something for people that want to play pvp modes.
---
They dont need to reinvent the wheel, survival mode was a mess. Plus I dont think they would need to dedicate mutch to making a deathmatch mode. 
---
If it took off they could even have player made maps and stuff, I cant imagine it being too hard to implement that either.
---
I like to think of it as a way to auto collect junk without being tied down to a junk node. I’d like to get one so I can pop my camp over to a lead or iron deposit. But that voice. All that talking. Maybe if they give the guy a vocal off switch. Or a Handy option.
---
Unyeilding and the secondary, tertiary effects are? What are they for bolstering and vanguards?
---
It's not, that's not what I meant. Reaching that goal won't change that it's shady, but it with get EVERYONE a 50% sale. I'm hoping that this will get more great items out into the market. Everybody wants unyielding sentinal scout armor with a BE fixer, but only a very few get those pieces.
---
gonna nope the hell outta there if they start burrowing
---
I guess man when I hit endgame and have everything needed I don’t see the point in charging that much for anything
---
Unyielding, AP refresh, and the chance to reduce damage when running. Bolstering, ap refresh, and chance to reduce damage when standing 
---
Vanguards is similar to bolstering
---
Make sure you put the civil war outfits in there as well! The outfits are almost certainly gonna count as costumes!
---
This has never happened to me
---
Yeah sorry dude. I'm an ass hat sometimes so I apologise, just automatically assumed I was being attacked, don't judge me too harshly sorry again ❤️
---
The fact that it's decentralized is one of the FEATURES of the system in my opinion. It means we can do a bit of shopping in a lot more locations, and I don't know why you don't see that as important because I promise you it is. What you're hoping for will result in a big empty wasteland with literally nobody in it, not even us, because everyone is hanging out around the vendor area.No thanks.
---
And my point was that they WON'T find the best price. You don't understand basic economics I guess, but the tendency of humanity is to RAISE prices prohibitively in an effort to earn at least SOMETHING when they see a cheaper deal they can't match. So no, again, the result would likely be the opposite of what you intend.
---
So AA is finnicky because of [how resistance is calculated](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance) , but the general idea is that it struggles when armor is really high or really low and is best vs med armor enemies.
---
Meanwhile 2 shot is effected by armor per shot and so it's weaker vs high armor enemies and does better vs low armor targets.
---
A slayers/hunters/exterminators does a flat damage boost, which is usually more effective than others vs high armor (as the more damage you do the less effective the same armor is).
---
I think the damage boosts vs specific enemy types fits in with the idea of "side grades", not strictly better or worse, just situationally more or less useful.
---
People have mentioned it would be tough for low lvl players, I think whitesprings and top of the world would not work because of that but both place are really set up for it. Thanks for the comment
---
Yeah, they have a really solid track record. I’m not worried about it at all.
---
I hear ya
---
Boys becoming men, men becoming wolves.
---
Wrong, I take Poseidon all the time and can't hold it for over and hour or two. Maybe 3 or 4 when it's like 3am and a mostly empty server. And taking the ammo factory. Maybe I can hold it for 30 min or so. No longer before some random try hard comes around. I'm on pc and this happens all the time.
---
It's the swamp butter
---
So like an auction house.
---
Yeah there's one always around the steakhouse in the cranberry bog area...I use him as my hound dog...he sniffs out enemies and I kill em....his name is Belvedere
---
The diehards will vote this down cuz it’s the truth. If you like to come on just to fix your camp then come on back. If you’re looking for new content to provide longevity of play, go to the other Fallouts with some new mods on them.
---
Should be able to break down and combine cores.  2 20% plasma cores are useless, let us fill up emptys with other ones
---
This idea is absolutely genius, I love it
---
Must be the platform then, but hey we all have different experiences
---
That’s also a pretty cool thought, but my main reasoning for my idea is that it doesnt revolve around staying on the server. Like, we all know people dont use workshops because if you get disconnected then you built all that shit for nothing; same thing would happen with a rentable storefront. What if you finished assigning all your items and then just got disconnected? With my idea the terminals just auto-sync and you dont have to build anything.
---
Not that your idea is bad! I really really like that concept! But unfortunately I think ideas like buildable/rentable storefronts at Whitespring/Top of the World won’t be viable until bethesda fixes its server problems/lets us save workshops.
---
You gonna run around nuke events not in PA or rad suit?
---
I didn't know that about two shot - TIL, thank you :) I assumed it was a flat increase in damage and the 'two' thing was purely visual.
---
Not for low levels unless the map marker was revealed at start of game then it would work. The place is already set up for it ur right about that. Thanks for the comment
---
I love my prime Zealots FFR Handmade for queen events .
---
I’m curious how much a Yeats worth of bread is hahaha. Yeet!
---
I've never played ESO. But if it works then we know it's possible it FO76 thank u for the knowledge very cool
---
Fuck yes gimmie the lucky 38 all over again
---
Does your armor have asbestos mod? I’ve never noticed or tried getting damaged by fire so I’ll check it out
---
lol if anything they would want us to hit it, that would look so bad if the community doesn't hit the stretch goals. It means there's a population issue in their game. What is there to gain from putting it out of our reach? Can't think of anything, maybe if they were giving out free money but this sale means nothing to them. I just don't understand the argument
---
Id like containers that dont share items. In fo4 i had individual boxes for guns, armour, ammo etc. Having to go through my entire inv for a certain item is a joke. Although i did lose a box on fo4 containing 100 cores it would be a chance im willing to take
---
Same as ballistic: commando for auto and rifleman for single shot. Tank killer should work now anti armour buffs energy weapons. You'll need the science perks for modding and maybe batteries included if going full auto.
---
I feel like this could be implemented by some npc campaigns. Modus presses on with FEV experiments using the player to acquire some samples from west tek, then he applies it to the player and that player becomes a super mutant, all human npcs flag them as hostile and the other mutants flag you as friendly.
---
Likely b/c of the stories/reports of traps set by some people - afraid there’s someone hiding nearby w/ a super weapon.  Someone attacks you, theoretically to take are of the bounty problem for you... and the chameleoned other player kills us for whatever happens to be in the junk bag.
---
But what do they gain from it?
---
Yup and I heard it's going to be as good as the raids too!!!
---
Wow and where did you get it?
---
Honestly Unyielding for a ranged build also.
---
Keep in mind most of those days were weekdays where servers are usually less active. It’s now the weekend where more are online.  Time to get to work.
---
As I stated in another post don’t go for headshots in a team. Tag the limbs so one scorch kill will count more as a kill each for all involved
---
I doubt it, it might help with vats but you’d get more benefits from bolstering considering the low amount of health
---
Someone sold it to me, I was surprised because they never dropped in legendary form
---
More thinking the armor for non-nuked areas, but they're always the rad reduction perks and radx.
---
The game is an mmorpg with vendors included in camps. Sorry it's not your cup of tea but for others it is.
---
Another Getto story
---
It's the friction in the market caused by the inconvenience of travel that supports medium prices. If there were a central frictionless market there would be an instant race to the bottom for prices. Serums 50c ea. Stimpaks 1c. Frictionless markets are horrible for sellers, great for buyers.  
---
Raising caps limit by any means just causes inflation unless sinks are built in.
---
The problem with Fallout 76 right now, and by extension our constant lag issue, is that every item with a mod/legendary effect, is its own unique item. ESO dosent rlly have this. You can have 999 spices taking only 1 slot of your Bank space in that game, with the only exception of the rules being the weapons. If Beth can somehow optimize the way items are tracked in this game, it will not only allow for the features that you sudjest, but it will also greatly improve the stability of the game.
---
I have vendors in my camp, and I enjoy the occasional boost to my caps stash which it provides.
---
The point is that's an AFTERTHOUGHT, a supplemental, not the point of the game by any reasonable description. And I definitely would not want to see that shift in focus.
---
But where did they get it? And how much did it cost you? Sorry I have so many questions but I’m green with envy.
---
There is nothing in game so far that is no PvP zone, other than events. So it will be an event?
---
Grind all day legendaries then grind for the mats you spent grind those legendaries.
---
I'd put it in the Top of the World's Mezzanine level.
---
I'll trade it for my Drill
---
I do not know where they got it, it costed me a mutants explosive laser, an a instigating explosive hunting
---
Sorry didnt know that, not sure about the creators skill level but I think it is shaping up to be a really good game, server stability has been greatly improved. Also this is a first for fallout itself and I'm sure they did not spend the money they could have not knowing if it would be accepted by the fallout fan base. But I believe as time goes on it will be better and I feel that bethesda does listen to its player's since so many things have changed based on what the community has wanted. I'm sorry u feel this way but understand thanks for the comment
---
I am on the opposite side of the idea.  I like players visiting my camp. I took my time and created a community property near Vault 76 (free fast travel). Everything unlock, no walls or doors.  Just tents and all of the atomic shop upgrades. Water, crops and low price items for low level players.
---
I juggle four characters inventories. Selling in large volume profit. Walmart style pricing. Transferring goods from one character to another. Slashings prices to move items quickly. As soon as I log in. Three or four players are already waiting to look at my inventory.
---
Mostly plans/ammo and some junk.
---
Oh god that's actually a lot worse
---
I haven’t posted on FO76 for a while.  Still love the game, just had to respond this is such a cool idea to change things up, even if it is just temporarily there.  Like a seasonal shopping mall in the wasteland lol.
---
Fucks sake Bethesda
---
A final stretch goal which is double the original goal is actually pretty basic and standard. Hiding the stretch goals, maybe not great, but not shady asshole behavior either. Sorry you dislike the model. I'm fine with it.
---
Easier than you may think.
---
There are at least 12 PA spawns in the forest.  Each may have a 25% core.
---
Plus there’s a large number of generators with lootable cores.
---
With batteries included and power user perks, even 25% cores last a several hours, and the cores only weigh 0.3#. 
---
Line in the sand drops between 1 and 4 depending on the number of critters you kill.
---
Camden park can have up to 5.
---
Some non-robotic critters drop them as loot.
---
Yeah didnt think about it til now but love visiting players camps. Maybe the real answer is allowing players to build closer together to be able to form ther own markets. Who know it was a thought and I laid it out. Thanks for the comment appreciate it
---
I've got dense which stops explosion damage, but even if I was to get naked and stand in fire my health won't move.
---
An example of the type of fire I'm talking about would be the entrance to Top of The World, there are gas puddles everywhere which you can ignite, the fire left behind in the gas puddles won't damage you. Makes for some great photo moments but yeah, it's just silly, probably the only game I can think of that fire isn't hot.
---
I've been deliberately plinking at them with a peashooter .38, so that other people can hit them too, because I was hoping this was the case.
---
But then no one will appreciate the efforts I put into my camp for the consumer!  I pride myself on my building ideas and love seeing folks at my camp looking at all my preety stuff!
---
That's a thought not really sure best way but not a bad suggestion thanks really appreciate it
---
I think it is a fairly safe bet that there will be bugs, just hope they will not be too numerous or severe/game breaking, and that the new content is decent enough.
---
Haha that’s hilarious and what an idiot for entering a workshop area. I had someone do this at my camp today but they were only measly liberators. I was behind my camp and could see what he was doing and he ran off as soon as I got near him. Didn’t think about seeking revenge as I’ve got really important scrap to collect. Just thought what a loser.
---
I just want a homemade cardboard power armor costume
---
Well as a bloody commando I have slowly moved from mostly bolstering to mostly Unyielding (4 pieces to 1) I gave not noticed the DR reduction.  You also have to factor in Dodgy that trades damage for AP.  Quality armor already has a good amount of DR.
---
No, no they didn't lol. I guess we don't really have a way to prove this either way :p
---
I believe I have (at least one) extra NC machine plan.  I don’t recall if its in my vending machine or stashed. 
---
I’m also PS4.  Aj-ninetyeight.  Likely will not be on tonight until after midnight.  Same for Sunday night.
---
Bro no you are one of the best Xbox sellers you my homie on Xbox 😪😪😪😪😪
---
My understanding is this is a rare drop from some crowned bosses.
---
No plans to move to PC. All of my friends are on PS4 and I will remain here.
---
When you visit a vendor or machine switch to the notes tab.  Recipes and plans you already have appear at the top of the list as (known) plan: xxxx
---
Scroll the lisr.  Anything there listed as plan: xxxx, you don’t have.
---
lol yeah it made me LOL, figured I'd use it.
---
Hero of my day. Well done!
---
Yeah - I just heard about the Legendary ones - but it seems like [the chances of getting one are pretty small](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d40pgm/discussion_how_do_we_get_the_legendary_rolls_on/f06n9u3/)
---
Yeah I love visiting players camps so I do understand that. Maybe it's not a forced market more of a choice. To some players who enjoy pvp taking ur camp out of the equation and still being able to sell might be a good thing no one wants their camp destroyed. Thanks for the comment
---
&gt; Tag the limbs so one scorch kill will count more as a kill each for all involved
---
How do you know this is true?
---
No sells plain old wood and I’ll buy that all day. I build a lot and am lazy at this point haha
---
Scrip is worth a LOT more than caps to some people. I hardly ever sell legendaries in my machine. Maybe a one star instigating rifle or furious machine gun for 76 caps to get someone started.
---
Because when you tag an enemy and when it dies you get the exp as well as others. How the system works. With such a small community the goal be impossible otherwise
---
When I started playing in March each vendor only had 200 caps. Different factions within the game each had their own allowance. So you'd have to visit 7 different vendors to make use of the total allowance of 1400. Now that amount is available as a pool across all vendors. I do play most evenings but at any point I can see how much of the vendor allowance is left and make as many suits as is necessary to take the remainder of their caps.
---
What kind of wood armor do you sell? Is it any good? Can you mod it a lot? I never looked at it tbh.
---
Only when I don't repair my armor or don't get all the perks.
---
\^\^ The switching of cards is what I want to emphasize because it seems most people don't even take it into consideration and use both bodyguards and lone wanderer on at the same time, with picklock and hacker cards as active cards during PVP and then are wondering why they are losing when they could use using those points for other cards related to PVP.  
---
Thats how I think we all play, with switching cards around based on what we're doing rather than leaving the cards on as an 'end all, be all' build.
---
Yep, I got lucky to Find an Instigating 10% aim in a player vendor for way to little.  Love it as my sniper.  Hope to get a decent bloodied soon.
---
Just the usual, not that there’s a shortage. There’s quite a few areas where good numbers spawn naturally ( the farm house between vault 76 and Flatwoods for example ).
---
Found it was a good time to finally start on those kill (x) amount of Scorched with (y) weapon challenges. Made some good progress with the black powder one last night.
---
BL is BL, FO is FO.
---
I hear u I'm very proud of my camp and think it should be a choice to participate in the central market or sell at ur camp thanks for the comment
---
Thanks for the honest feedback. Thats appreciated.
---
Maybe it'll come back. It's been like this since the PvP "balancing" in adv. It was kinda fun blowing up cars and see morons die :)
---
Yep, I sure am lucky
---
Belittling someone is a hostile act. Listen thanks for the comment and appreciate ur input but this is just a post in no way shape or form will bethesda change the game to create this highly unlikely. Thanks
---
Caps are poor value full stop in today's market
---
It would be neat to have the option of one (1) machine there. It would be even cooler if with the possibility of private severs a few select members of the sever could have their machines open 24/7 so they can make sales without having to be online
---
Sorry to be thick but what is the correlation between entering a workshop area and taking one shot to make him turn red? Doesent he need to shoot back as well to turn red? Im not 100% up on this defending workshops thing...
---
getting xp does not mean it counts as more than one scorched dying
---
To be fair it was a mixture of me being very lucky and him being very stupid, either way it was feckin hilarious 😂
---
A farmers market would be nice
---
The pinging system and message system are very different. Also in DS you're much more penalized for dying than in FO76.
---
My buddy has a full set on ps4 and ot literally lags the whole server be it the queen/encrypted/ or even arktos.
---
Maybe have it possess other things like how that flatwoods monster does, and you see the vines grow from the ground and stuff around where theyre possesed
---
People the push in PvP matches tend to be stealthed or else VATsable and soon dead unless real tanky. But there is a lot of variety out there, keeps it fun.
---
Why was this downvoted this is art
---
PvP game modes attract assholes.  but it is 100% true that consoles have more bratty kids than pc.
---
What about a seasonal monster, so you can only fight it on a certain day of the year in an event
---
If you want to keep you mental conditions, just stay away, belive me.
---
It almost makes me want want to get back fallout 76 for the first time in 3 months
---
Or repair a mincart track and then defend the cart as it travels down carrying the nuke
---
No if you are in an unclaimed workshop area and I claim it, then I can initiate PvP with you by shooting you. If I don’t shoot you, you stay white. It’s a mechanic to stop third parties delaying the claim process as if I claim an unclaimed workshop and there is a neutral within the WS area then the claim progress bar stays still and does not allow you to claim it until the other person leaves or you kill them.
---
I use two "Slayer" weapons: a Zealot's .50 (primed), and a Mutant Slayer's Explosive Gatling. They get the job done, and I haven't found anything better yet.
---
Like a doctor to cure addictions? Or a Nuka Cola cooler to boost Nuka Cola effects? Or a cool Col Gutsy for home defense and one liners? Scavenger droid and Col Gutsy can go at it with one liners all day (maybe a mute option).
---
I bet this is coming later. After the wastelanders. They said they will continue to bring new things to the game
---
My but your skin is paper thin. Disagreeing with an idea and explaining that I don't believe you understand the economics involved is not belittling. You need to toughen up a little bit if you're going to have an internet presence, because it gets a LOT worse out here than the extremely mild words I used.
---
Back when I was low lvl (around 20 25ish) I got suprised by a scorched beast and ran to a near by camp, I was hoppinh they had turrets that could take care of the flying asshole. As soon as a turret broke and the camp got swamped with scortched I relised and felt like an ass.
---
Just by the numbers that can’t be true. There are almost 2 times as many of players worldwide than console players.  Something like 1.2 billion pc players to almost 700 million console players. 
---
Just with those numbers it can be assumed that there are just as many if not more children playing pc than console.
---
Monkey's paw law: the effects you don't like are removed, but the legendary drop rate decreases proportionately.
---
I 100% agree!!! :D
---
Maybe there could be a place for low-lvl like in Flatwoods or someplace near that area? Maybe west of the Nuka factory?
---
Then we could have one in whitesprings and then in Watoga for mid-lvl and high-lvl respectively?
---
&gt; /u/Toxic_Razz  : Grab a bloodied fixer and a bloodied any other gun and the fixer wins
---
So a bloodied fixer has greater damage than a bloodied Fatman or a bloodied 50 cal or a bloodied (or furious) LMG.  Why that's good to know !  Great info there Sparky !😂
---
That was me and your welcome ;)
---
lol this is not a bug, you are not guaranteed to get  a 3\* from a 3\* creature
---
Yes the Level Designers did an Amazing Job
---
True, doesn't mean they can't take a few ideas, like a proper trading system.
---
This! Yup, this is what I’ve been working on over the last few weeks!
---
basic algebra?  if a given population has x% of trolls, then a larger population is going to have a larger amount of trolls, the percent doesn't change but since the overall population changes the number of the troll group also changes
---
And they'll grab those suggestions, give to their boss, and he'll use to wipe his fat lazy ass before telling them to add more "convenience" atom shop items. 
---
You know, so they can charge us for a band-aid fix to problems THEY created. May not be pay-to-win but it sure as hell is pay-to-waste-less-time. And what a waste of time it is. Jesus Christ.
---
Yeh a couple of paedos lured a scorchbeast to mine while I was away. Since survival closed, there’s more bored turds about
---
They all used to live in survival mode....
---
Because Bethesda removed survival
---
okay, for shits and giggles I did look it up, according to Statista in 2018 there were \~267M pc players and \~644M console players.  so what was it you were saying?
---
I was shocked some one had it for only 3500c in a vendor, snatched it right quick.
---
You know that China has a huge gaming population and most of them play on pc right? You obviously have not done any “research”because those are real numbers repeated everywhere with a simple search. If you had done so much research you would know. 
---
I don’t even know why you are arguing with me unless you are a child or an idiot. Why would you choose to argue and look stupid when you could easily google it and find out you are mistaken.
---
A slayer Gatling plasma destroys scorchbeasts and scorched. 
---
Had a guy pay me 4k for a 90% reduced weight slayers Gatling plasma yesterday.  
---
So all in all it’s worth it for me.
---
sounds like you’re gonna be living on top of Owen’s Wavy Willard at this rate
---
The results of no survival mode.
---
I'll sell you as many as want for $500 caps.  DM me and they're yours
---
{crickets}
---
Haha I don’t know where you found that bs number. Add a billion to the pic number and you would be closer. Did you forget about the entire Asian continent? They mostly use pc.
---
From what I have seen from some dude on youtube that wall breached the doors to the governors office, There's nothing in there. Not even floors. I'd be willing to bet my last Moon Monkey that it's for some form of future content update bethesda is toying around with.
---
Which they said they are doing in the next event update, we got 1 of 2 main event changed they have planned
---
do you even know what Statista is?  or what global means?  yes, China has a large population, and accounts for a large portion of the gaming market, and it does outweigh the US, but it doesn't outweigh North America, Europe, and Australia, all of which have more console gamers than PC gamers.  to me it sounds like you didn't do research and just assumed that because of China pc was more popular...
---
but since you won't look it up and are just going to assume things here are the links:
---
[pc](https://www.statista.com/statistics/748072/number-pc-gamers-world-platform/)
---
[console](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=12&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjG24qnjpflAhWPTt8KHQriAlcQFjALegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statista.com%2Fstatistics%2F748093%2Fnumber-console-gamers-world-platform%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0vvsJPsL0zAopn8n_mO51Q)
---
next time actually do your research and don't just assume
---
For a workshop, how about Kawaha Nuka Plant? Take the workshop, make sure you have power, and the factory can produce nuka cola.
---
It got love a long time ago
---
I have so many legendaries constantly that I always use up my daily scrip and sell the really good ones in my vendors. So I don't believe this stuff about a *'nerf'* to legendaries. They are jist as common as always.
---
It came out months ago
---
Wasn’t even thinking of the 38 and NV!   Excellent call-out.
---
If you have around 650 weigh in your stash and put a lot of one type of ammo, like 50000 556 rounds it will bump you over the stash limit because math hard.
---
This!
---
Hey frogo
---
I love this game and it's always improving. But lets not pretend the state it released in was acceptable. It's better now but at launch it deserved all of the bad talk it got.
---
This genuinely made me chuckle :)
---
This tactic is becoming fairly common, unfortunately.
---
Min/max’d stealth bloodied melee. They can put out some ridiculous numbers. There was a video here showing that kind of stuff yesterday.
---
I like the Arktos skin for Excavator
---
Yeah he is obviously an ass and an idiot cus he deleted it now.
---
Good plan
---
If you find any information on that please send it to me!!!
---
Had a wanted guy show up at my camp today then he started trying to destroy it.  Was not in the mood so I just logged off.
---
Thanks bro
---
I will donate 10k caps to the person that can show me this build in action and teach me your ways!!!
---
Power armour frame increases str by 4 which equals 20 lbs. Maybe that was it?
---
Both hands, you say?
---
I prefer bone raider personally
---
Nah they just need a pvp mode again and to have workshops actually usabke by the majority of its pkayer base instead of the few people who collected invincible arnour and 1 hit weapons
---
Almost bought that one, it is good.
---
I personally have been getting a shit tone of legendaries lately. Been doing lots of SBQ runs and I always get at least 3-4. I also do any horde event going on as it’s a guaranteed legendary, most of the time a 3 star. I’ve found Whitesprings has been giving a few more Legendaries that usual as well
---
So did you get this from the dev room or what frogo?
---
Just curious what makes people believe the game will die. Even with the single player games they added content for longevity even fallout 3 people play to this day. I feel like this game could last a really long time and feel that slowly the base to fallout games is slowly trickling in from post I have read. Well I really enjoy the game and wont do private servers only because I like seeing other players and trading with them. With private servers I worry the market will die and public servers will be empty. I guess time will tell.
---
I like how everyday there's a shit ton of (good) suggestions. It's been like that since launch. But people, Beth can barely deliver and maintain their scheduled content so all of this is borderline fantasy at this point.
---
That’s crazy, some people take that shit way too seriously. My camp is miles out of the way on the edge of a cliff near the munitions factory and I’ve never had a problem spawning it in, I think this dude was just clowning around and got caught. Or maybe he was pissed off that my camp was so far outa the way it cost him a ton of caps lmao
---
Yes actually. Stealth low hp build with bloodied handmade does slightly more dps than a power armour build with a bloodied ffr 50 cal. So if the fixer beats the handmade that means it also beats the bloodied ffr 50 cal.
---
Also, Sparky, would love to see you clear the inside of a building with a fatman or kill anyone in pvp (that isnt an excavator wearing food build) with any of those weapons you listed
---
Yea, they never dropped with legendary
---
F for your minigun
---
Probably wasn’t for the caps. There’s a challenge for completing a certain number of bounties. They’re hard to come by so I’m sure people take em when they see them.
---
This is probably the rarest thing in the game. Whoever let it go really lost out
---
I wish Beth would update progress more frequently, it’s been showing 23.98m since yesterday afternoon.
---
I drop a few everyday.
---
Unarmed bloodied weapons are your go to or junkies if you can get a bloodied, with all the proper mutations adrenal reaction,twisted muscles and talons and 2 vital perks Radicool in endurance and nerd rage in  intelligence,
---
Edit: the rest is meats, vintage Nuka shine, bobble heads and magazines
---
Fuck me that’s a great idea.
---
I don't think that will work proper. They just don't have the kind of server numbers for it that Final Fantasy 14 has. Just look at their core server list! There's hundreds to choose from - meanwhile FO76 has what? 4 core servers per platform? seems a stretch. But who knows, it could happen.
---
True sometimes it’s just not worth the effort
---
I don't need 10k caps. Here is my build in action  https://youtu.be/pEqIYDbqZKY
---
It's a bloodied stealth build. With a meat hook you get both unarmed and single hand perks. I also use sneak and ninja. 4 pieces of unyielding and one chameleon. You need mutations like talons,  twisted muscles and carnivore. Also use whiskey,  fury and meats that add strength and melee damage.
---
Ah sure we had fun while doing it that’s all that matter lol
---
They need to make it so players with one freakin item in their machine don’t show up as a “vendor” what kind of vendor has like no items lmao.
---
Building camps is  a fun aspect of the game . 
---
You learn alot from building  .
---
 I just completed a underground maze and it's fun to see people wondering inside you're camp trying to figure it out . 
---
Some people love , others hate it because they can not get to you're vending machines the way they know it  , fast travel , run to the machine , fast travelling to another camp .... That's how 75% of the people play this game .
---
People want fast access to them and don't bother to figure it out . 
---
Sometimes they fasttravel away from my camp because they don't take the time to look around , then I fast travel to them to show the solution .
---
This is a adventure game , you must seek for clues . I always leave clues ,but players are not used to search for  clues to reach a vending machine.
---
Just get into building modus , it's fun . The only thing Bethesda needs to fix , if you store you're vending machine you should of keep the inventory that's allready inside , it's a pain to refill those machines
---
&gt; /u/FrazzleBong : Yes actually. Stealth low hp build with bloodied handmade does slightly more dps than a power armour build with a bloodied ffr 50 cal.
---
That's just word salad.  If the 50 cal does more base damage than a Fixer (and it does) than the bloodied version will always do more damage as well.
---
There is a reason that you don't find Fixers at player vendors.  There is a reason why the OPs post got so few upvotes and 25% downvotes.
---
Agree but u never know as the game grows that wish could become game content. I agree all post are basically a wish list and bethesda has listened and changed a few things do to posts or comments. I think it has to do with game growth and player retention, eventually they have to add content as u could tell from the last meat week that dwindle off really fast after the first few days after that I really never saw anyone at the prime event and the cook out. So we will see. Thanks for the comment appreciate it
---
👌🏽 solid
---
That’s amazing. Do you think I would get the same results with a DCG or powerfist. Or is the meat hook the way to go?
---
I think it would be a great idea to have some kind of "farmer's market" one week  a month. There could be a designated place set up where people could set up vending machines to show off what you are selling. There could be special games or events to entice some to show up. 
---
We used to do this in the post apocalyptic mmo "Fallen Earth"(rip,) where every month or so there would be a "crafter's market" ran by players. Everyone was welcome and we would have a convoy of vehicles to bring lower levels to the event, there would be live music, events like a destruction derby or best dress. Everyone would donate money or items for these events. People would buy and trade items. It was a great way to build a community and bring people together that involved more than just shooting stuff.
---
I'm sorry what?
---
It's not about the caps! People will show up to claim the bounty even if it were zero caps. I know I would haha.
---
I think that they flock moreso to the different games. Fortnite and CoD for example. I dont think fo76 has much of a problem with this as the people who do play are mostly nice
---
Its an ok game if thats the only game you play lol. You're probably one of those players who just logs on and goes idle a little bit at a time
---
if you find me the same piece i can pay 8000 caps
---
As far as I know when u highlight the camp on the map it shows number of item maybe I'm wrong. But yeah that would suck spend caps to travel for one item....unless u mean when it says say 10k ammo u get there and its 10k 5mm or something like that?
---
The reason there are no fixers at vendors is because no one is going to sell a bloodied or aa fixer for caps because it's the best gun in the game currently. The reason the handmade and fixer out dps the 50 cal is because of the sneak multiplier of x2.5
---
We will See those in the Atom shop in about 4 months now
---
only when I'm mixing a G&amp;T   haha
---
I just read the first paragraph. A lot of people play fallout because it has vats. If I couldn't use it, this would be a bad surprise for me. I suck at aiming with a controller, I play on PS4, there's no option for mouse/keyboard. I also never played NW. 
---
I would hate it.
---
I’ve never played but looking to get it; would like to know as well
---
Still an issue. PS4.
---
No surprise "looking into it" turns into a multi month wait for a fix.
---
I not only appreciate the tale, but how well it was told.  Thank you!
---
Lol no. Water purifiers already exist. No difference between that and a bot except for cosmetic reasons. A farming bot is ridiculous. Almost no one farms anymore since the game gives out food to the point where I feel fat in game.
---
What are you doing here?  The curator has dug up another body at Pricketts fort.  Get over there and bury the remains.
---
Not sure if it helps, but I was on Xbox playing a couple hours ago. No issues.
---
It’d be a cool community quest set up to clear the floor out and renovate it to make it ready for activity.
---
OMG this is even a better idea, great job very well thought out. I love this idea. I'm going to add this to edit is that okay?
---
You can get similar numbers with a dcg.  Meat hook gives essentially 12 perk points and dcg  with maxed cards. You can get very close with all the ads of meat and alcohol. Also use Party Boy to maximize alcohol effects. Vintage nukashine is awesome,  but I usually use it after her first mutation if I have time.

Nawh I just hate when I look at the map and see like 20 vendors but only like 4 actually have more than like 5 items in their machine, I’m thinking like they should turn blue or some other color if they have more than a certain amount of items in their machine
---
nope.. just logged off a nice long morning session.. and have been playing for days with no major problems of this sort
---
Explore, join global events for free and just join the endless grind!
---
Disagree. I think the weapon effect should be buffed. The armour effect is fine just how it is though
---
Oh hell yeah, great idea.

You one of those people that just likes to argue?  Good thing I don't care what you think 🤣🤣

Having player vendors in one market location, it’s a brilliant idea.

Same Answer

How are they already waiting if you're not logged in?I'm confused because Camps don't show up if you're not logged on.

I'd love one of those cabins. But ....

Thank u my only concern and that of other is no foot traffic to show off ur camp. A few good ideas have come up and I added in an edit to original post. But thank u really appreciate it and thanks for the comment
---
This would give an unfair advantage against the many people using a vats build so I'm gonna vote no even though I dont use vats myself.
---
Joy...   lol

This game is in the top 10 most played games on xbox so the game isnt go a die any time soon.
---
How about learning from your mistakes and not die? Know where the fissures are and stay away. Save it for someone more prepared kiddo. See a single ghoul out there? More than likely there's a pack hiding somewhere. Jump up somewhere high where they can't storm you and your little pee shooter. If I see a loot bag it's earned that I take it so someone learns their lesson. Sometimes I take everything except for wood. With wood you at least can cook something in your inventory to help with your newbie flu symptoms lol
---
They should also allow us to play on safe servers with no radiation damage and no nukes and.... 
---
It's Fallout!!! Vats was here before anything else. Leave Vats alone.
---
Had this happen yesterday for the first time in a long while.   I wasn’t doing anything different from what I normally do in game.   I was thinking it’s some kind of unhandled exception or memory leak, but then I saw a recent comment that it was happening to someone within 5 mins of playing for them.
---
Are you trying to argue for the sake of arguing or actually show me that the 50 cal is better? 
---
If you're going to show me the 50 cal is better at least provide some evidence as to why instead of stating totally arbitrary things like the upvote count on ops post, or "BuT iT hAs HiGhEr BaSe DaMaGe"
---
Feels like I'm talking to a fox news junkie right now
---
Ew, a youtuber.
---
Ok thanks.   I do have a lot of stuff I like, like the hunter Gatling laser, a legendary fat man, and chameleon armor.  I have way better luck looting legendaries than getting them from the vendor.
---
Vats is not "just an aimbot," but an important mechanic for busting through damage mitigation builds. Considering players are able to hit 75%-100% damage reduction through things like Emergency Protocols or Assassin's/Sentinel sets, Vats is an integral counter you cannot remove without removing several other items from the game. You see, Critical hits are able to bypass any damage reduction. 
---
Many people will say to just stagger the enemy so you can remove the Sentinel effect. Pistols have ZERO ways to stagger an enemy outside of a limb cripple (which is completely negated by Adamantium Skeleton). This makes critical hit builds mandatory for pistol users. It also makes them viable in a game where everyone thinks they are worthless. Just the other day I met a PVP player with a brand new set of assassin's/sentinel + legacy weapon. He was convinced stagger was the only way to kill him. He asked for a friendly demonstration and I dropped him in about 1-2 seconds with a pistol.
---
Removing Vats removes any diversity in PVP builds. My main PVP character deals less than 80 damage per shot, yet is able to drop anyone, no matter what gear they use. You think that is broken. I think it is fair as it allows people to be effective in PVP without the most broken items in the game. The most dedicated of PVPers are only going for the broken stuff: unobtainable legacy explosive energy weapons and full sets of assassin's/sentinel. What chance does a normal person have without the same? None without Vats and critical hits.
---
I go for prefixes first depending on my build and once I have a full set I start to look for pieces to swap to get my ideal set. My ideal combat set: leather arms, combat armor chest, metal legs. This offers great balance for ballistic and energy dmg resistance. Obviously heavy versions of everything would be ideal, but I just don’t have the patience to grind enough to get all of that so I take what I can.
---
I remember a time , maybe four or five months ago . A friend that I play with , had one of his real life buddies just get the game. They were very low level and didn't know anything yet. I was helping him gather items to build his first camp. I was telling him when he hits level five to turn pacifist mode on. He was still level four. We had just entered a small raider camp passing through , next thing I knew I was instantly dead. Said I was killed by j_e c_ol . Fill in the blanks. Y'all were running up to low levels and test hitting to trigger pvp. The noob had just become a level five. Ever since then I've never teamed with anyone. None of my friends, no randoms . I play solo now. I never intended to play pvp. I have never claimed a workshop . I always have pacifist on. And thanks to you guys . I will never help any other player again . That new player , he deleted the game , never came back. My other friend that knew him , quit around that same time. Keep pvp consensual . Go use workshops. Lots of people quit on PS4 because of your crew . If I personally know a couple , imagine how many I don't know. You are bad for this game. I'm all in for protecting pvper right to pvp. What you do is hunt for ways to exploit ignorance. Turning pve players away from the game.

Every fps Is easier with mouse and keyboard in terms of aiming, since the genre itself was created with such design in mind. In fact, even when I have spent most of my gaming years using controllers, I can easily place one headshot after headshot with a mouse, more easily.
---
Some of us will add fuel to the fire and mess with players ;)
---
My Fiancee and I are using full sets of strangler heart PA because it pairs well with the stabilized perk and our Explosive Gatling plasmas. Plus the +50 acid damage it gives is crazy.
---
[deleted]
---
In order... prefix (unyielding, chameleon), RR, DR. Color and the like is absolutely unimportant as I wear a costume over it.
---
This.  Nuff said.
---
I disagree, the game was very playable at launch. Most of the really bad bugs and glitches came in later updates, and were also exaggerated.
---
If I played with you, I'll trap you for your loot and bounce. A raiders life is taking from the fools. See you in a workshop soon
---
Tbh I hate wasting caps fast traveling to other camps
---
Yeah I hear u me too. Thanks for the comment
---
It would be cool if with the introduction of human npc’s there would be some central hub city kinda like whitesprings where people can setup or rent stalls to sell stuff at
---
Two things. Stealth and strength.
---
My commando had a laser rifle as His secondary weapon so he could save his "good ammo" for important battles, but I liked it so much it became my main weapon, above my TSE Assault rifle and my furious plus limb damage handmade.
---
You wont get nothing from me raider scum!
---
Gold painted is not "gilded". Some weapons spawn with a gilded skin.
---
Raiders aren’t even in the game
---
Batteries included Is not that necessary, really.
---
Don’t worry you can get an atom refund.

https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
No not new to fallout unfortunately. This game just felt so different that I didn't realize I missed the part where you can fix it on the bench. In my excuse I assumed you needed to either earn atoms or buy them to keep using your good stuff. Doesn't help that I don't take this game too seriously. Just casually.
---
Lol just about 40 bucks. Nothing to sweat about.
---
Thanks guys, I'll be sure to give these a try
---
Thanks and submitted
---
I Will totally transform one of my characters into Preston Garvey, whatever it takes.
---
You’re part of the problem that encourages releasing unfinished games
---
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure even the most casual of players knew that, chief... I'm not trying to make you feel bad, I'm just letting you know.
---
Why wouldn't people use them. They are advantageous. I'm not mad that people use them but IMHO, they are one of the worst things ever to be added to the franchise.
---
When you crouch, you dont show on the map
---
if they were singular legendaries like how they are in fo4 it would be more balanced. but the 3\* items make it so that you can get certain rolls in combination that are definitely high tier. It is what it is.
---
Yeah I guess I'll die here then
---
Hey OP would you agree that if this was achieved by using an outside hack to add legendary effects it would make you kind of scummy?
---
Can I just have the 10k caps I’m poor with a wild 700 caps
---
I'm actually wondering if Beth bumped the respawn rate a bit. 
---
Teamed with another player yesterday, and went to the fissure site near Whitesprings for some Ultrasite (and maybe a Deathclaw hide). 
---
Spent an hour, spawned 4 Scorchbeasts, and each one brought about 25 to 30 Scorched to the party.
---
Had just enough time to re-arm, heal, and loot before the next SB emerged. 
---
Nothing impressive about the drops, but the ammo expenditure wasn't unreasonable - maybe 2k .50 cal + less than 300 .45 / 5.56
---
Would probably have spent more time hiking / FTing different locations for less XP and Ultrasite otherwise.
---
This is an awful idea. No further comments
---
As I log on, players fast travel to my location. And "wait"in line to use my vending machine. Only have one. So players line up.
---
Obviously you have to log in for you camp to show up.
---
just for clarification, what's wrong with that?
---
On God we’re all Vault Dwellers too😟
---
But, if he didn't walk into a workshop like a dumbass. Would you haves till had fun watching him taunt you while, you can do nothing? Because this was my brief experience with this horrid title.
---
LOL Ok so you chose to join a team with hot-heads and were mad that they didn't put on passive and ATTACKED BACK?
---
And you let that one instance decide you would never play with these people?
---
You have much deeper rooted issues than I can discuss here, buddy. Sorry you're taking the game that seriously.
---
We will do what we will do, as in the end... its a game. Reading this confirms we're doing something right. Its players like YOU, who will fully stop playing with people simply because they didn't listen to your every word, and become toxic to any who traverse the wasteland not searching for junk such as yourself, that are the real toxic scourge of this community.
---
So something we already have?
---
That's not how it went down, the kid had just turned 5 as y'all come up. I'm hunting the video I saved rn
---
Now imagine, you have your fully mutated molerat companion and over the course of 200 hours they slowly get rid of their mutations and become marriagable!
---
Dont post stuff like this youll get whoevers coming up with events over there fired lmfao
---
That wasn't the point, but if that's all you're going to get from it, fine. Yes, some issues can be attributed to people's systems and internets, but  Bethesda has made games crash for their entire time as a business. Fallout 76 still has bugs that existed in freaking Morrowind, and Skyrim, Fallout 3. But yeah, it's everyone else's fault.
---
Then what is this game about?
---
A player I think mentioned earlier about turning it into an event like market getting attacked help defend type. It will be interesting to see how wastelanders NPC's will work. I'm looking forward to it. Thanks for the comment very cool
---
Well that’s k you very much, it’s no war an peace but I like to think it’s not totally illegible
---
I hate the PvP aspect as well. I keep pacifist mode on so that I don’t accidentally start anything. I like workshops with junk nodes, and try to avoid the power plants. Sometimes it doesn’t matter which workshop it is, some people are just assholes.
---
That's what I did with my Batman character. Every piece Is +1 strength, shadowed ultralight heavy combat armor. Except the chest, which Is the one which gives increased stealth. Plus more strength from underarmor, I usually have 22 strength. I have an unyielding set stored, but no need for even More damage.
---
I enjoy the game very much I got back into it very recently can can’t stop playing. However, I feel like the game after level 50 is just a loot a grind for some people this is fun for also I can see why they don’t like it. However, the nuclear winter mod is very underrated and is probably one of the most unique battle Royale experiences currently. If you are playing this game with friends this might be the most fun game ever. Most people are very friendly when I play and talk and there is nothing better when you ask a level 200 to help drop a nuke. I did this when I was level 32 because I bolted through the main quest which was a little lack luster just because you knew everyone was dead but it was still fun. All that needs to be added is survival mod and just have the base game with no pvp restrictions no leveled enemies or weapons rarer strong ammo and basically what realistic overhaul mods do in fo4.
---
It’s getting fixed this next patch
---
Gotcha. And what about stats? Anywhere remotely close to combat?
---
I'm sorry I misread ur original post my bad so sorry, I'm working 12hrs today and trying to answer every post, things are getting a little blurry my bad. Thank you for the comment really appreciate it
---
Ok so you stated to him 'don't attack players'. You stated to him 'turn on passive'. He didn't do these things, and so you stopped PLAYING WITH HIM... AND HIS BUDDIES TOO!?!
---
Holy hell bro. Thats rough. Thats taking a game wayyy too seriously. I'd hate to be your friend in real life if thats how you act. "Hey, you didn't listen to me about the one thing I said. Now I won't come hang out with you ever!"
---
LOL Damn. Sucks to be that guy. Thats toxicity right there. Meanwhile he's all like 'ok dude, i didn't know. i just wanted to play. i didn't know' and you're all 'NO. I WILL PLAY THIS GAME SOLO BY MYSELF FROM NOW UNTIL INFINITY'
---
I couldn't imagine losing a match and then disowning my friends. Thats a lonely world.
---
It's garbage. 
---
99.99% Of pvp in fo76 is just gankers and griefers. NW is dead. Most people are boycotting workshops. One shot killing is still happening. Hackers and cheaters are everywhere, and can by pass the damage restrictions. I myself soon will drop this game since Beth constantly slaps the face of pve players.
---
Getting the vid. Multiple people quit playing because of predatory crap. The player didn't try to hit you back , you dove in front of him while he shot something else. Just like halls recent uranium fever video. And that guy was an ass . He was toxic. I am calm . I was only making a point. New players have quit because of you. Before they get a chance to learn convoluted mechanics. It's not easy to explain how to get to pacifist turned on. To some new players I've met. Not worth the headache.
---
Well, I learned something new! I haven’t ever seen a gilded one then and I have played since day one almost daily. So, this is insanely rare! That’s cool!
---
They left the game because the got killed once? Seriously? It's just a game...
---
You’re dead right my friend. I don’t think they’ve got the PvP mechanics of this game worked out at all and honestly PvP has only been going backwards since launch.
---
Haven't items that covered your face always given you -2 Perception? Like because they're impacting your peripherals
---
Start &gt; Settings &gt; Game &gt; Pacifist Mode &gt; ON
---
How is it not easy? Please, spare me the victim card. You can put that back in your deck.
---
I suggest you choose some quality of life perks. Good stealth, good DR, reduced weight for some ítems, etc. 
---
Good thing about rifleman builds Is that you start early in the game with the hunting rifle, which is a great weapon.
---
Well, I'm glad you were at least able to screw this bastard up. It does actually make it even better than he thought he was untouchable!
---
Yeah, taking a workshop from anyone should be a challenge. If someone wants to build up lots of turrets, and defenses, it shouldn’t be so easy to one shot them. Even if they are a lower level than you.
---
&gt; /u/falcon880535:  You one of those people that just likes to argue? Good thing I don't care what you think 
---
Lol love the idea, hope with NPC's these towns will become populated and maybe one day they will decrease the camp circle so we can build closer to each other kinda hard to rebuild the community if u can build close to those people. Great idea I would stop by
---
Rebuilding society after a nuclear war that ravaged the world doesn't, to me, mean "earn caps from your vendors". In what way is that anything other than ancillary to the main objective? I'm not here to become Mr Moneybags, I'm here to save Appalachia from the Scorched plague. And I still make money from my vendors. I just don't think that should be a focus.
---
I'm still friends with my buddy . I don't team with anyone. Chat in party . My friends like taking workshops. Then they bitch about getting ganged, I tell them to stay out of pvp territory. Still friends . I don't team up.
---
I like that idea. I was joking to my husband; "you think they are gonna utilize making us pay for camp spots?" But i love the idea of having a market to slap a vendor at
---
Lame story
---
I think they shoehorned it in because some people complain if an mmo has no PvP. I wish it were entirely gone from the game tbh
---
My firebreather helmet says it's broken when I try to wear it then says it's not when I try to repair it    :(
---
Ok?
---
There are a lot of weapons better than TSE ones, but it just seems to me like you've never gotten one from a drop or cannot afford the caps for one, so you want them removed.
---
You clearly don't read everything that you respond to . Such is a common fallacy nowadays.
---
I've never tried the vaults because of the whole losing your character stuff; but down to have a pop now. Lvl 205ish play on British time and my GT is Badgerist
---
You may want to learn a little more about the game. Player damage is capped at 110 per shot. Two shot weapons aren't particularly accurate and explosive damage can be easily mitigated in most cases. There are plenty of legendary effects that are much more useful with fewer downsides.
---
Clearly... you are upset. Clearly you stopped playing with your friend solely because of a mistake he made while not in passive. Clearly you're very tender on this situation and I don't wish to upset or victimize you any further.
---
I've had one, tried it, and hated it for how unbelievably easy it made the game, the grinding aspect of 76 is the reason why I play, and the fact they decimate players is just bull, so I turned it into scrip
---
I like it because it could create more foot traffic and increase ur odds of selling. There are down sides. Thanks for the comment really appreciate it
---
Simply ignore him, he'll go away...............
---
Aye, I throw every TSE (and other explosives) in the vendor as soon as I get them for the most part.  They're fine, but people put too much value on them.  And a lot of 2 shot weapons go straight to the scrip machine.
---
I'm happy to sell them to whoever wants them, but I'd rather have more effective effects.
---
Welcome back, we’ve missed you.
---
Just a few random things...
---
No more survival mode.
---
PVP only if you hit back, or in workshops
---
New dungeon at Harpers Ferry
---
New dungeon (hard), at vault 94, near Jack’s
---
Scrap legendary items for scrip, machines at RR stations. Turn scrip into random legendary items at Berkeley Springs Train Station
---
Currently an all servers challenge to kill millions of scorched
---
I dont care what the game mode is, but I want to terrorize Appalachia as a deathclaw &gt;:)
---
Cringe thanks for reminding me I'm on Reddit.
---
I've got 1300+ hours logged and rarely die, I got the idea for last stand from playing Borderlands 3 a lot and remembering this terrible games mechanics.
---
I have a character that i started when Nuclear Winter debuted. I highly suggest this route fir anybody that just wants to have a high ranking character at the start(if you’re a nuclear winter buff anyways, i kinda woremyself out in the first map- guy was level 35 at final departure therefore a level 35 somerset special!)but He hit a growth spurt once i got rifleman, expert rifleman, and tank killer maxed out, master rifleman 2, caught me an instigating hunting rifle early on and since the last double xp he has since passed my first characrer in level and once that happened i kinda ran with him, and he just hit level 102 last night. S6 P12 E5 C5 I7 A12 L8
---
Pairing this with secret agent/covert operative and actionboy/marathoner is great for sprinting around. Stealth is big for me on this character so i’m trying to figure out how to boost his rifle skillls even more, and i think i might go charisma 3 to keep partyboy/LW3/HB3 available, and maybe take a point off of strength to add into perception to build the perks out like
---
Rifleman3
---
Expert Rifleman3
---
Master Rifleman3
---
Tank Killer3
---
Glow Sight3?
---
oh so you're 'that' friend? The one who doesn't help. Gotcha. Hey man, to each their own.
---
I understand very well how to turn it on. Many people get frustrated with menus within menus and panic. Making it very difficult to explain anything to them . I was thanking you for teaching me to alter my playstyle , I've never been killed again. There is no benefit to teaming , unless you need to share perks. Which I don't. I still play with the same people. Those two friends quit because of you and others like you. We still talk in party daily. They quit giving Bethesda business because of you. You like to try to twist things to piss folks off. I've seen your channel. And you are failing right now. Because I enjoy this shit right here.
---
Which is exploitable ;)
---
Oh look, half the server is there! Lol
---
I guess you are new to the game or haven't been killed enough times with a plasma flamer or a junkie's handame to understand that TSE weapons should not be your greatest fear.
---
Same answer
---
You get it from Nuclear Winter no?
---
That's why i put my camp near a busyish place. I also try keeping it well stocked to entice players from across the map. Haha and thank you for the awesome suggestion i hope it makes it into the game.
---
If you are going to make public content you need to have/develope a thick skin or you don't bother doing it otherwise you spend so much time handling made up dram you won;t get anything constructive done, assuming doing constructive things is your goal.
---
You weren't thanking me. You were trying to pull some passive aggressive blame game against me. You're the reason your friends quit. Because you don't team up with them so they have no reason to play with a 'friend' who won't team or help them or assist in defending the workshops or anything.
---
You are the reason Bethesda isn't getting business out of them any more. Bethesda designed workshops for PVP. Designed slap damage handshakes for PVP. Designed the game to HAVE PVP. Its people who shun their friends, who ignore their friends... who play for self... who play selfishly that cause friends to stop teaming and playing with each other. Thats on YOU. I'm glad you've seen my channel. I'm sure you leave a hundred thumbs down while fully ignoring your own friend's requests to play.
---
Very toxic of you.
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but I am cautious
---
Seems like you have no clue what you're talking about. TSE hasn't been the meta for 8 months and are relatively weak compared to most other Explosive weapons and faster fire rate weapons now. Get informed and then make a post about how you want everyone else's game to be affected because of your personal view on a weapon you have the choice not to have any experience with.  No weapon "kills players even if they haven't shit back" either unless you are in a workshop and then its your own fault. You dont even have to PvP and you dont ever have to use one. Bethesda definitely wont "listen to their community" if its one salty guy whines mad he cant win in PVP.
---
I'm with you, the game is great. Yeah, bugs. Whatever. Mostly they're funny, and when they're more serious, like losing a 3\* to Mama Dolce, well it sucked but it gives you an excuse to find something better.
---
Right! Mine is by Arktos. Been there since Beta. Just wanted the acid mined. Now it's a lot bigger and prettier since the Beta days!
---
Well the lore behind bottle caps is that each cap is worth a bottle of purified water for water merchants.

We need more content first
---
If Bethesda had waited six months to polish the game before release, it likely would have been much better received and might not get all the hate now. It was rushed out the door to meet a deadline with the idea that they could fix it after launch, which is never a good thing. Hopefully Bethesda has learned their lesson and we are now seeing that with the Doom Eternal delay. Personally, I love Fallout 76 and can't get enough of it despite my initial apprehensions.
---
1. You cant be one shot because the PvP damage cap is 110 so you didn't get one shot. 
---
2. Workshops are PvP zones for balance purposes and they arent the most efficient way to get any recource so you dont have to use them.
---
3. You never have to PvP if you dont want.
---
LOL I wish I knew what that meant so I could maybe be inclined to take offense, but I'll call you soft instead. Good luck out there playing solo.
---
This subreddit hates youtubers because in the early days of the game, people were rightfully bombarding it saying it was terrible, and considering the state it was in they were more than right to do so, but like with every release of a bad game on the planet, there's some people out there that religiously defend it.
---
BE gatling plasma with strangler heart PA is the most OP setup I have found. Obviously you need all of the right damage reducing mods and perks and all of the heavy gun perks too.
---
or open the executive quarters area in the white springs bunker
---
I personally find it hard to believe you claim to be the level you are, with the number of hours logged, and the gear you claim to have. and you don't know this information already
---
What would this build look,like? Is bloodied really the most powerful?
---
Bloodied is the highest damage output and even though it has the lowest health pool it also has the potential for the highest damage resistance in the game making the small health pool last longer than a full health bar. I believe it is currently king. As for the build I would have to check when I get home.
---
On the wastelander update it would be cool to see something like a world auction house in the human settlements that they add.  Maybe like a big central “diamond city” type place with a auction house that players can use
---
PvP??? More like PvG or player vs griefer... 
---
PvP can be fun IF you’re playing with others who like PvP... but if others aren’t doing the fighting... it’s literally just killing and griefing as we’ve seen. 
---
Taking a workshop? If you don’t like PvP then DO NOT complain about getting griefed or killed or PvP. Bethesda literally warns you with a pop up warning you about this when you went to take it. 
---
I’m one of the older players and I freely admit my reflexes suck and I’m not a great PvP’er at all...lol 
---
• I leave pacifist on
---
• I don’t take workshops at all
---
• I never take blind team invites
---
• I don’t trade with randoms 
---
• I know how to block and leave a server quickly 
---
Is it full proof? No, I’ve been hit and almost killed with nuke mines even with pacifist on (radiation will get you quick!). 
---
But most of the posts involve taking a workshop, shooting back or joining randoms... 
---
I can see Bethesda making pacifist mode where you take no damage at all AND you can’t turn it off without leaving the world.
---
For Melee (with less chance of fluke hit deaths that Bloodied brings):
---
Instigating, Fast Swing, +Str or Power Attack, +End
---
Vanguard, +Str, Sentinel/or Sneak Bonus
---
Me: oh look! A building with all the doors closed! Looks like no one has been here *opens door*
---
Turrets: **RRRRAAAAAT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AT-AH**
---
I'm super down. Also take my upvote
---
Yeah I'm a melee build and a tse handmade did Jack shit for me
---
I suppose simple players need to stay together and cover each other. React quickly and stuff.
---
I recently started a bloodied build after playing for so many months. The damage u can achieve with any Weopon is insane but maximum with melee. I clock 2000+ with my 2 star meat hook. Other mellee weapons can do better.
---
With bloodied pistol modded into a rifle u can get 800+ damage.
---
Rifles with ffr and miniguns will simply tear thru the toughest enemies.
---
So there's no  best bloodied weapon..any weapon can be made the best as per your playstyle and perk distribution.. 
---
Good armor and damage resistance is more important than the weapons I feel.. U definitely need a good set of unyielding..
---
Yeah that would be cool diamond city was a really cool place...great idea thanks really appreciate it
---
I can’t even put words to how many times I’ve wanted this type of stuff! A bank at the LEAST, holding all our guns at the minimum and or extra caps, doesn’t even need to be locked between players alts but would be great! This wouldn’t even tax the server stability (their reasoning for camp limits and such) just let us store guns only even so it clears up camp space! 
---
And a central sale place would be so awesome, make other players aware of how SHIT their prices are LOL, and offer so much ease of checking everyone’s sales, Hell they could even do a auction house instead! Think of how wow does it, they take one central area and we bring our stuff there and everyone can see the whole servers prices at once!
---
If you want a challenge don't use legendaries.
---
You're right, of course, and I admit my question was defensive.
---
I grant you you opinion, even if it's based on shit posted on youtube several months ago.
---
If you were actually playing this game you'd know that "two shot" is shit, because it kills any accuracy and the second bullet does only base damage (if it hits at all), as for "exploding"... lol... read up on "dense" and "fireproof".
---
That's what pacifist is for.
---
In OPs case though, they sidestepped it by kiting mobs.  Bold move.
---
My next character is going to be a raider. I've heard Pipe Bolt Action Pistols benefit from both rifleman and pistol perks? Are there more "double dip" weapons? I already got a set of unyielding armor with sentinel and AP. Can my armor be better with other legendary traits?
---
I have never participated in FO76’s pvp. That’s what GTAO is for.
---
Gatling? no
---
Pipe bolt? yes
---
Also PA displays would be great
---
Another player mentioned having it as a monthly event that way players can have it both ways a central market and still be able to sell at their camp. I feel that's a good idea. I also feel whitesprings is a big waste of space, so much empty space wish we could utilize it in some way. Thanks for the comment really appreciate it
---
The damage limit is per *hit*, not per shot. There are quite a few weapons which deal multiple hits per shot, or shoot 9 or more times per second, that makes the damage limit meaningless. Gatling Plasma and Laser Gun, with legacy Explosive effect (which have been duped a lot), can do *both* of those things.
---
If you're in the area of a workshop—*even if it's unowned*—and someone else begins claiming/contesting it, *you become flagged for PVP*.
---
The PVP rules are very complicated and unintuitive, so it's too easy for the average player to unexpectedly get forced into PVP.
---
At least they're easy to kill.
---
Bloodied doesnt help in PvP anymore because of the damage cap. Doesnt matter how powerful your gun you can only do up to 110 damage. As far as pve its nice to use unyielding for better drops etc and kill creatures much faster. But i dont think you get better resistance with bloodied because you could still use vanguards and keep serindipity and nerd rage on with full health and still get the benefits when your health is dropping. I switched away from bloodied recently but kept all my gear in case the change PvP again.
---
It's just that there is so many of them already!
---
You admit that you cant be one shot like I said and that you can avoid PvP by leaving workshops alone then....
---
Personally, my stuff is alread all selling for 2c, while ammo is free. Mind you, I sell some weapons, a plethora of stempacks and radaway, and plenty of magazines and plans.
---
I've have over 100 stempacks and my stash box is full. Please take my stuff.
---
Honestly, tho, with the frictionless market, we have to stop and remember that selling isnt our only way of earning caps.
---
And, we can sell at other vendors.
---
The gattling was patch a while ago. I believe the pipe bolt dose double dip. The normal pipe gun dose not
---
Martial arts no longer increases crank speed? Coulda swore it did now I have to friggin check it out.
---
If you're on xbox i can join you. I've got the same!
---
I'll be on in a bit what's your username
---
Yep. Xbox.
---
Technically it's the power fist because it has a mod that adds armor penetration, but the deathclaw gauntlet deals the same damage with the extra claw mod.
---
Because of how the game handles damage resistance, armor penetration becomes useless at very high damage numbers. If you can reach damage numbers that make armor penetration useless, which is easy to do with unarmed melees, then the power fist and deathclaw gauntlet are equally the best unarmed weapons.
---
It is.  The problem is it runs like shit.
---
Divide and conquer it is then!
---
I'm still looking for the stats of the mods for the bear arm. This unarmed weapon has a lower base damage than the deathclaw gauntlet, but it has the potential to be better if the mods are good.
---
Why hate something you never properly tried? I love pvp because the game is too easy and other players are the only threat. People who wait hiding for a low level to claim a workshop and kill him are not pvpers and probably wouldn't stand a chance in a proper fight.
---
Lol
---
You'll get one npc per month lol
---
Bloodied commando - bloodied 25% fire rate 25% vats cost fixer / handmade. 5/5 wood unyielding with shrouded mod +1agi/luck. Ap refresh if you dont know how to use consumables.
---
I guess, I just enjoy the game and the process of making videos.
---
Haha awesome. I've only seen one person outside of my group with any raid gear.
---
Running with the bloodied gp is a bit over kill haha. Everything does to fast to notice the acid. Good new though, I've fought the Queen 5 times or so now and have not crashed
---
Just use firepeoof..theyre not anything special in PvP. For most weapons like the handmade the explosive effect only adds like maybe 10 damage.
---
Same as username on here
---
Nice! Nice, nice.
---
Dont forget that eso is made and patched by zenimax
---
&gt;  I myself soon will drop this game since Beth constantly slaps the face of pve players.
---
Oh noes!  Quick - sell all your Bethesda stock Boys - this guy is gonna quit !
---
Thanks! I prefer DCG instead of the Power Fist with that annoying hissing sound.
---
I'm seeing it frequently. For example, Whitespring Station is a hotspot for vendors and the poor robots are left behind on the rocks next to the station.
---
To hear the legend Bing Crosby singing  White Christmas whilst playing this game would just be fantastic.
---
Shoot one shot with a high-damage shotgun, or Gatling Plasma or Laser Gun with Beam Splitter muzzle mod. That one shot causes multiple hits. So that is, by definition, one-shot.
---
Other weapons can shoot multiple times before the target can react. That is not *technically* one-shot, but the distinction is purely technical. In practice, it produces the same result of making the damage limit meaningless.
---
If a player simply passes through a workshop, there's no warning they're being exposed to PVP. The warning only appears if they try to claim a workshop, but they can still be forced into PVP even if they don't claim it and never see the warning.
---
Im glad they pushed Doom out. After this disaster  they learned their lesson.
---
I always just keep am extra plant stored as it wont expire that way. Well I used to do that. Now I just have my base inside of a bridge by harpers ferry so no enemies can get in there and all my stuff is safe
---
Hmm, so would you recommend it in the state it’s in?
---
We have to only bury fire on the queen or we crash.
---
Sure, Zenimax Media. But they're both owned by the same parent company, Zenimax. They both share bean counters (accountants). Both employed specifically to work on these projects. They'll be given the same resources to fix their game. Remember, even Obsidian had to call Bethesda to fix New Vegas shortly after release because it was too buggy
---
Fpv ftw.
---
Best PVE, not best pvp. Best pvp builds are assassins powered sentinel gear with quad FFR Tesla’s and explosive legacy lasers and good ffr handmades. Bloodied pvp is stronger then the general public but I get my ass handed to me when I go against the full health sentinel players
---
I use a BE gatling plasma and confirm that even with a beam splitter it does NOT one shot.
---
Insult not who berates me upon homecoming. Preferably also has dinner ready.
---
That's a bummer, maybe it since there's 2 of you haha. I don't lay into her like I use to for fear of crashing. But I do spray her for a few secs at a time and have not crashed yet fortunetly
---
Bloodied meathook with either swing speed or 40% more dmg on power attack. SS for dps, power attack for raw huge dmg.
---
Is the minigun any good now though?  I haven't played heavy guns since before the summer and the patches that affected them and back then the minigun was pretty garbage.
---
So you think that constant FPS drops, duping, and server disconnections was playable?
---
The meathook is the strongest hitting weapon PVE weapon in the game right now.
---
Thanks for your input man
---
I’ve come to find out that after wasting3-4 drum mags on a person pvp initiates. I know this cuz this guy kept shooting at me because I guess my base was plopped right where his was and he was mad? I simply waved and went sell my stuff at the whitesprings vendor, cue me selling a ton of crap and 3-4 drum mags wasted on me later pvp initiated while I was selling stuff, he killed me but he didn’t get any loot because I picked up my junk for fear of dying and because I have crippling junk collection syndrome that causes me to be at my carrying capacity limit at almost all times.
---
Mines hitting over 7 now. Stack those meats!
---
She dies crazy fast though either way. If we could just lay into her non stop she would probably die faster than she could heal.
---
Mmm, it's getting better but still wouldn't dive in yet. Definitely wait to hear people's reactions to Wastelanders. They say it will completely change the game. So if it is too much of an overhaul, you would essentially be learning the same game twice. Personally I really enjoy the game, so kind of afraid it changes it too much. But I mean how much could it really change lol
---
I will give u my PSN I will take them all what ever the level.
---
It happen where servers feel and look empty now with the change to public events. Just your luck you didn’t see any but they are still there. Did a few today.
---
You're absolutely right.
---
Sutton 15 to 20, Helvetica 25ish, Morgantown trainyard 12, Morgantown airport 30ish, collision course event, Morgantown highschool 30ish, wavy williards 30-40, palace of winding path 20ish,  line in the Sand event, fissure sites 10-15 per scorchbeast spawn. The tunnel is probably best, but if you are near any of these clear em right quick. My team and I will puncuate by launching multiple nukes on the queen, everyone show up, get hits on everything, and don't be afraid to drag the Scorched Earth event out, farm them!  Me and closest teammate have several hundred kills a day. The pain is not getting enough legendaries for daily scrip, but farming Scorched Earth helps there.
---
The deathclaw gauntlet beats the meat hook, even with the gladiator perk bonuses.
---
The deathclaw gauntlet with the extra claw mod and brawler perk (+20% damage) deals 83.16 damage, while the meat hook with the extra hook mod and brawler and gladiator perks (+80% damage) deals 77.11 damage.
---
If you don't believe me, see for yourself: https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
Hell yeah I'm on Xbox
---
You’re thinking the Hellfire armor skins.
---
I’ll be blue whenever I sell thousands of .38 and .44 ammo then.  
---
I think the pop-up on each vendor on the map showing how many items they have in a particular category is sufficient.  If you consider hovering for a few seconds over each vendor a waste of your time, I bow down before your hyper-efficiency.
---
Just buy the game. It’s rather cheap these days
---
Have a market with 24 stations, they get assigned to players that have camp vending and display all the wares. Maybe use the motel by Flatwoods.
---
I would prefer to see a market like this anywhere but Whitesprings.  There are other locations in the game, y’know!
---
Nah I got 3 of them in the wild a couple weeks ago. Scrapped them cause I didn't know people view them as 'rare'.
---
Had a normal one drop from the Behemoth near twin lakes, I'm a melee build so I played with it for a bit and sold it. Seemed to act like a blobby shotgun and stuck glowing orbs of stuff onto the whatever it hit. The damage was minimal given my build, but visually it was interesting.
---
I'm on Xbox and I get offers up to 25k for mine or stacks of weapons. Personally I wear mine all the time since it hides the backpack. I would trade for things you need and not caps you normally get a better deal. I was tempted to trade for 5 legacy lasers and 4 bloodied last week.   
---
Takeaway average 25k, maximum whatever you can get in item trades.
---
It's funny that some people think China like Korea or still think we are a socialism country. A lot of Chinese play this game. In fact, the Chinese fallout 76 online group I am in has more than 1000 people and we share SQB event, encryption event, good deals in the vending machine, tradings, and so on.
---
A weekend isn’t enough to even scratch the surface of the game 🤦🏽‍♂️
---
Ha! I enjoyed reading this, and it sounds just like me too hehe
---
Why I like to use bloodied .50 cal.  If serendipity works on a per hit basis.  Not gonna work well if I’m throwing 250 rounds at you plus i got serendipity as well.  
---
If both parties use it then it should neutral out. Then to counteract you have to throw out more hits than the other player
---
Ps. Serendipity is one of the few perks not needed yet.  Post like this is why sentinel armor was nerfed.  Now this is next on the list.  Next thing you know everything on the game nerfed to a point where we are playing halo 3 type gameplay. (I.e. shoot a whole magazine into a guy and whoever performs beat down first wins)
---
Hey man atleast that’s not just two bad plans and an over priced super stim! And a few seconds on two camps adds up especially if I’m looking for something specific, I’m just saying it can only help 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
My GT is BLUBLZRedeux. I'm out this weekend but intend to play Monday.
---
You mean cut content, they would never create new models for the mutations as its incredibility time consuming along with making working with things like sleeping in beds and using chairs.
---
My stance is, if you don’t feel like you really want it, hold out for something better
---
I have a similar problem. If im in my excavator pa when i load in my carry weight is 545.
---
If i get out of my pa or load in not in my pa, my carry weight is 445.
---
So i have to hop in my pa, leave the server and relog. Or deal with reduced carry weight.
---
Seems a bit like the central auction house like in other MMOs. And I personally love the idea.
---
Bethesda doesnt work on weekends. We will have to wait till monday.
---
Heck add option to decorate it and people would gladly pay it daily. Could even have an option to have one set up in Watoga and Grafton if you did their questlines.
---
Ill go back to using my scorched killer.
---
Oh you guys in silly armor. But really, I'd love to Sendipity proc in PA...
---
I wish they did, they left survival mode a week after it debuted when they learned they kept getting their ass kicked by actually good pvpers!
---
I am in the middle of this now...battle hard, battle long, we need to be at 5 million required by tomorrow at the most.
---
Dude I had these to low levels run thru the silo to the end and were trying to use the targeting system after I swiped my card, like they were trying to steal it. So I just didn’t punch in a code (mistake on my part in hindsight) and forced them to use their own shit since they wouldn’t move. They then proceeded to cover the whole dropsite area and ruin the whole server basically. We had already done one, so there was already the perfect spot to re hit. I even sent him a message like, if your nuking the queen just rebut the same spot...it’s the best place. When they did the opposite I was pissed. They tried to hit me with a mini gun so I led them outside where I could move around and quickly melted both of them! Then they didn’t even go to their own nuke event! They just pissed away a card to be a troll I guess.
---
ladies and gentlemen its debbie downer!
---
&gt;Is this game better now? Should I buy it?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning
---
Report posts like those. We have this page specifically for that. 
---
Also does anyone know where I can farm glass?
---
No problem.  I personally do not wear the helmet because I do not like the -2 perception.
---
I just wasn’t sure if I punched in the code that meant the targeting system was just “unlocked” or whatever to anyone. Really good to know, thanks!
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
That is also 99% of the problem
---
"Avon here!"
---
Happy cake day. :)
---
LET'S A GO!!
---
You are safe... what i have seen ppl do which is naughty is stand by the code pad, u insert the keycard and they enter the code and they will essentially “steal” your nuke...
---
👍👍
---
Does it have a little beaver dam next to it? I used to have my camp next to one. Does it have a giant van crab spawn on the bridge above it? Does it have water below it? Does the bridge above have holes in them?  
---
It was quite the Enclave bunker. Loading bay, power armor bay, president's room, backdoor, crew quarters, generator room... now, I have one in a cave, in the Savage Divide. It's not as good, but it's decent enough. Too open for my taste, no real bunker vibes there. We need more bunker CAMP items. Anyway, where's yours?
---
I did a few there last night. Breach and Clears, a Bot Stop and I didn't quite make it to the one where you have to protect the robots and then run before it caves in, whatever it's called.
---
Don't get me wrong, I don't care about haters at all. I was just wondering, why is this so or maybe I missed something :)
---
You bet it is!
---
Lol not even close
---
I play on a desk top and a laptop, switch between the two all the time. No issues like you claim.
---
I was automatically expecting as I had no reason not to, and they're all I wanted, so I could show off all the outfits I've collected
---
Ive got outfits in stash id love to display at my camp.
---
It will never be completely balanced, like any MMO. The idea is that there are various builds. You either build for PVP or build for PVE. You can be one of the metas or be something unique. Any build has a weakness and everything can be beat. Not every PVP player uses Serendipity because they can either focus on power armor or focus on high health so it will never proc. That is the balancing. 
---
In all honesty this will never be a successful PVP game, at least adventure mode. Fallout was never supposed to be, it was just supposed to have PVP elements. They already leveled the damage field, now people want the perks and armor leveled...so again, why not just go bare bones and play NW?
---
Lode bearing.
---
I give u that it is a spot that seems already set up for it. The only worry is low level player. I think whitesprings and top of the world so far have been the big winners. Thanks for the comment
---
The thing is, you essentially just need to spec into damage reduction with the gear I mentioned. The broken laser guns and acid DoTs are enough
---
Yes the bridge itself has a dam under it. I used a glitch to build inside the base of the bridge itself. The bridge has holes in it above the dam. North east of harpers ferry
---
They need to apply this to Watogoa, Morgantown, Top golf the World and other crowded places.
---
Oh what!? I thought that the keycard was the same way! Because I’ve put in a card and my buddy couldn’t use the keypad and had to enter his own card. Then I came back that evening and the card was still active all I had to do was hit the keypad and I was good to go.
---
That is the first time I heard the motel at flatwoods not a bad choice. Very excellent idea thanks
---
I know a few players have mentioned that and unfortunately I was not aware of this I might have added it to my post. Very cool thanks for the comment
---
Nice to know they are still spawning. Thanks!
---
Sorry to correct - pipe bolt does benefit from rifleman and gunslinger perks - I managed to get higher damage per shot our it than a hunting rifle with same lengendaries....albeit at a very heavy perk cost.
---
In PvP, this would only be good against slow weapons. A minigun will shred people who only use this perk for defence.
---
Not that compare to bloodied
---
Exactly! I had one time where it was actually a fun match because we were both around the same, but only once.  I would think the challenge of raiding a built up workshop would make for a fun mini dungeon challenge but there would have to be major changes to the turrets to make them actually effective and a menace.
---
Nope. I use a BE galting plasma with a beam splitter and it does nothing against it.
---
Well written
---
I tested and it didn't for me
---
You can’t learn recipe? Do you mean “lobbing barrel”
---
A few people have maybe that old saying great minds think alike applies..lol it seems to make sense to a lot of people, one player mentioned just having an open market once a month which I think is a great idea that way players still visit camps and once a month u bring the community together to trade and sell. Thanks for the comment really cool
---
Turrets can't even kill mobs, let alone players!
---
The game already got a price drop. Best bet is when Wastelanders drops like they did with Nuclear Winter.
---
( •_•)&gt;⌐■-■
---
(⌐■_■)
---
Glad to learn this.
---
It is very rare to find one from Big Boss enemies (if they drop a tesla, they can also drop lobber).
---
IIRC, legendary Tesla lobbers are legacy.
---
Use paragraphs
---
Oh to be young and dumb.
---
Don't worry after level 50 you'll get the normal treatment.
---
Who cares
---
I'm thinking if there was a central market then prices would level out so it would get rid of player vending farming. Some players disagree and believe the market would shoot up and cause prices to skyrocket,  but I'm not sure about that.well thank u for the comment appreciate it
---
I sold one for 1500 caps a few months ago
---
Nice. I think I’ve just been unlucky. Of course it doesn’t spawn when I’m looking for them. Haha
---
I can confirm neon billboards are crazy expensive in terms of CAMP budget, it's not just you.
---
On pc iv maybe had 2 griefers since launch. I accidentally shot the one guy so maybe more like 1.5 griefers in total
---
tse weapons suck lmao
---
I'd wait.
---
Wow great idea like having fraction markets very cool idea I love it more immersion is way better. Got to be a raider to enter lol I do understand what ur saying about low levels and agree to an extent,  I always hate to exclude anyone or discourage aspects of playing. Thank u that is a great idea.
---
I am talking specifically about the issue you described.... there are other bugs that are the game’s problem... but that isn’t what you are complaining about.
---
The first ever MMORPG Ultima Online developed a "Bank" and player vendor system 21 years ago.
---
You or you wouldn't take the time to comment. 👍
---
Kinda like u need a key or a key pad. It's possible I would think. Thanks for the comment
---
Naturally. :p
---
I'd go with a heavily armored one or one that goes invisible since that was the primary reason for the original DNA chosen
---
You're clearly not listening to me, so have a good day.
---
Well you could've sold it for 90,000 caps right now if you held onto it
---
Another nice feature would be a refund option that’s only available for 30 minutes after buying, and refunding immediately deletes any of that item that you have built.
---
That is really cool so now we know it's possible, I believe if it's something players really want then eventually bethesda may implement it. They have been responsive to players needs I feel. Who knows we will see. Thanks for the comment and information
---
My. Vanguard junkies commando can open a huge can of woop ass on any bloodied player. You just can't out dps me lf Even if half my shots are null by serendipity.
---
Running into a bloodied player is the dream. It will be over before they can do anything.
---
I am... you talked about a high frequency of crashes.... something that just isn’t the case for people with a decent connection. If you asked me 10 months ago I would be with you. But the game is pretty darn stable now. Still has some issues but if you are having constant disconnects or cannot even login, that is 99% likely an issue on your end.
---
You believe bloodied is the only way to go? I'd highly suggest go search some Youtubers who have put that to shame. RageChronicals is just one. Bloodied was the meta but definitely was never the only. Many people have found a much more effective build you just have to sacrifice your damage number in your pip boy which means nothing since there is a damage cap in PVP now (a product of balancing). 
---
You ever try Vampires? Ever use Dodgy? Ever focus on high health with Auto-stim/Born Survivor mixed with cards that benefit stimpacks? 
---
Hate to say it but there are more than one viable option but like I said, no one talks about them on here because everyone is focused on the raw damage numbers which mean dilly dilly in PVP.
---
Thanks for the feedback and comment.
---
They are not what they use to be, back in the day very valid complaint. But yeah TSE sucks.
---
This concept works well under the lable of "Legendary Mutation."   But instead of the "common" monster pool, pull from the cryptid tables.  Super Wendigo.  Super Flatwoods Monster.  Super Freaking Snallygasters.
---
That doesn't seem right...
---
I don't know what to say to you man....let's hope someone else weighs in. 
---
I messed around quite a bit with the benefit of adding a gunslinger perks....and then alternatively having all the gunslinger cards with just two levels of perk and full bloody mess instead. The damage output from my AAE Revolver, TSE pipe bolt and IE pipe bolt all adjusted depending on the number of gunslinger perks added, so I know it has an impact.
---
Ultimately having 6 to 9 perk slots dedicated to getting the most out of pipe weapons wasn’t worth it (compared to what I could do instead).
---
I prefer equipping dodgy and adrenaline instead....
---
Yes, a glowing lime cake.
---
I usually list mine for around 1k. No idea if that's good rate though.
---
Why don’t you wait? If you don’t love it wait. If you do love it, buy it and have no regrets.
---
No sir. The damage cap exists in Adventure as well. It was not mentioned that it WOULD exist in Adventure but it does. Speaking from experience.
---
Nope.  Not bugged.  The neon billboard and sign have absolutely ridiculous camp budget costs. 
---
As much as I typically jump on Nuka-Cola theme items I have refused to buy them.  I bought the West Virginia set and have yet to include them in a final camp build due to the budget demand.
---
Yeah. Pretty bummed this hasn’t happened yet. Not sure if mannequins are considered non-animated actors or NPCs so that they’re capable of wearing outfits and armors.
---
Then buy it?
---
That's where I have mine set up, how do you have your camp set up to deal with the mobs from the campsite nearby?
---
Pa doesn't do shit against other players. It's great in pve but, Its all about perks, assassins armor, and the best mods for armor in pvp. I hate pvp in fallout 76, but I sometimes do it when someone is being a dick.
---
Junkies build doesn't out dps a bloodied build in PvP because the PvP damage cap is 110 a d junkies doesn't have damage reducing or damage ignoring perks like bloodied so at least half of what you said cant be true leading me to question the other half. I have a JE minigun and JE laser rifle, I've tested them out with a full junkies build and they are outperformed with bloodied.
---
Actually it's the other way around. The 445 is the normal carry weight. There's a bug (been there from launch) that gives you an extra 100 carry weight in excavator when you log out and back in while wearing it. It 'fixes' itself when you get out of the PA and get back in...
---
If you log off, is your camp saved? I'm barely a level 10, so still learning a lot.
---
It is right.
---
I found three of those models somewhere, and did the same damn thing.
---
Man if someone i trolled followed me around the map AND made a Reddit post, that's a job excellently done
---
I've seen rage chronicles. He is good but the way he beats bloodied builds is by bring in a team using perks to heal each other spamming stims. Alone his build does t put bloodied to shame, also he only shows the clips where he wins l. I'd imagine he gets put down a good bitm
---
I think you are missing DLC files. Go to the Bethesda.net launcher to repair your game files.
---
Thats what I'm saying. Its so weird to me that people would stop playing with friends over 1 instance, or leaving the whole game over a death they got... in a game thats mentioned that there is PVP since its release.
---
Seems strange to me but I guess.
---
I would wait a bit. At level 10 you are not ready for the ash heap or the cranberry bog. Need to gain some XP first.
---
Yeah. I feel a system where you could go into the whitespring mall and put your items up for sale with a cost of 5-10% per item price. Say you list something for 100 caps you payed 10 of those to sell that item at the mall. Basically a system to sell items while you aren't online but there is a balancing factor in it.
---
Adding what OP describes wouldnt detract from "the main goal" it would just be something on the side as you say. And with this logic why isnt player vending removed all together as it takes away from "the main goal"
---
It’s a defined limit based on the number of players on the server.  It adds up to a minute or two.
---
BS this idiot and his friends hack and use aim bot. Ever heard of beefcurtins thats the 3 of them being idiots!
---
every. fucking. time.
---
Had a guy gank me during a defend event I was so confused by what was going on I respawned and he ganked me again. It was a dirty dirty tactic.
---
A smaller idea is a traveling brahmin merchant. You have an NPC like a Mr. Handy with a brahmin that travels around camps and carries items you give them to sell.
---
I always carry a banana to ward away diseases I’d get in an airport. Filthy places. Sometimes if I’m in a hurry, I’ll carry plantains. Not quite banana but it serves its purpose when I fly cross country
---
Have a look around RobCo, there should be a few sitting around on desks and cabinets.
---
As I said it's ancillary. That doesn't mean it takes away from, it means it supplements. Is there a reason you're deliberately taking my point the wrong way?
---
I'm not beef curtons LOL show me the proof of me using aimbot, I was recording the whole time yesterday of me whipping your ass
---
Please. No need to explain survival or caps to me dude.
---
I thrived off of bloodied players junk. At the end they wouldn't even come to survival cause the PA players could tank em... Railway wrecked anything in vats and telsa made people be honest with stealth boys.
---
Bloodied was a competitor at the 190 cap but even then a stiff breeze made them go down.
---
Everyone gets beat. 
---
Please dont ignore the main point. There are other build options besides bloodied. You dont need a team for a high health build it just helps.
---
Maybe any ammo effects are only for non-legends?  It's a shame to be able to craft all these guns, but really only to learn mods. Give the "regular" guns a boost so not such a huge disparity?
---
Ah yes, war never changes.
---
I agree. YW and thanks for the reply!
---
Lol that is a really cool idea kinda like FO4 with making trading routes. Great idea very cool thanks for the input do u mind if I throw this in my edits on the main post?
---
Nice! Thanks.
---
Wow. He owned himself so hard he deleted himself.
---
lol there are entirely new CTD bugs that happen now that didn't 10 months ago. The Aid bug? Many people have experienced that in the last few patches.   
---
Ok, maybe if I term it different way? If a game is so poorly optimized for middle ground systems/internet, that not having the highest possible connection at all times causes your game to crash, the game dev is at fault. If people playing the game on great internet, but also on a PS4 experience crashes, it is the devs fault for not properly optimizing their game for "common" systems. A person should NOT need to be on A+ internet AND A+ hardware to play a game. Sure, A+ everything should make the game have higher fps, and better water graphics and whatnot, but one shouldn't need to relog over and over and over just to make it to the initial splash screen.   
---
I play a variety of online games, THIS game has the most crashes. Heck, I can play RDR2, a variety of Mario games and various other online games and not crash at all. Yes, my internet isn't great, but if I never crash in OTHER games that require internet, and ONLY this game. Then THIS dev team is responsible. Not my internet, not my hardware.
---
Ur welcome
---
Except nobody is using a bloodied build in pvp due to the 110 dmg cap
---
Go ahead!
---
FACE THE LEAD!
---
I disagree. I use sentinel assassin armour, and from what I’ve seen faster fire rate weapons shred right through it, even with Serendipity and Dodgy. Tesla’s are even worse.
---
Congrats on your upcoming ban.
---
brown and white are basically the most common and least valuable after weathered. you want yellow, pink and forest - the red is the grail. blue and green can probably fetch around 5-7k, the top three for twice that, and the red is "priceless".
---
please correct me if I am wrong.
---
The game doesn’t do a great job of matching the storyline to experience levels.
---
You are not right
---
Nope saw several last night
---
It just a way for them to take caps out of the game. Give caps a bit more vaule
---
I’ll give my whole inventory for this bad boy 😂
---
DudeYou actually didn’t answer the question at all
---
I didn't mean that you were not right, it's just that with how the perk has a chance to ignore damage with every hit, it should average like a damage reducing perk with fast weapons. The perk by itself should not be able to ignore that many hits in such a short amount of time.
---
Bloodied is useless in pvp due to the 110 dmg cap. Its still very solid in pve tho.
---
Best build for pvp would be a commando
---
&gt; I have spent about $200 in real money in the atom shop and have no regrets.
---
Nice try Todd.
---
Did the same shit
---
I won't argue there.
---
Great pic, some of my favourite shots are in nuke zones.
---
Especially the ones with my friends who no longer play anymore.
---
The good old days 😢
---
I think with Wastelanders they have the opportunity to really clean some places up in a lore friendly way, providing they become repopulated. Fingers crossed for Top of the World becoming a raider city.
---
For what lol
---
Bloodied is useless in pvp due to the 110 dmg cap
---
Everytime I read comments like these I wonder if people even read the post.
---
It's a currency dump. It helps regulate the economy. All mmo's have them.
---
haha just realized that, sorry, automatically entered the soul-crushing despair mode of someone who has grinded to many hours looking for the outfits.
---
I would be happy to just get 1k ot 1.5k for the brown one. the white is even more common.
---
Ouch. I feel awful doing this even without paying.  
---
However all is not lost - in the Frat house with the blue door there is a chess set which uses robot figures as pieces. There are loads of them there so check that place out to get replacements.
---
Sure you did... truth is I dropped frog and his 2 hacking friends 1vs3 several times lol you rezkilled me dude not impressive. hows that paintball gun holding up big dog LOL I feel sorry for you frog, go make some real life friends this trolling crap is pathetic. Your dad told me he wishes you would stop yelling on discord HAHA
---
It's freaking rediqulous. Even lore breaking. Paying for FT is also just asanine. But hey, want do we really expect from Beth now a days. Only slap after slap to the face.
---
then again, it comes down to the crazy collector walking past your vendor machine. you could probably put it up for 10k and someone will eventually think it has to be super rare and buy it.
---
The critics were mostly wrong. Seriously on the first week people were only complaining because it was online, then people were complaining because it had graphical bugs and pretended that it was unplayable BECAUSE of this, which was not the case and wasnt the bugs that the game had that made it unplayable for some people. Seriously, when "Critics" were saying that they forced themselves to finish the game like it was horrible as fucking vietnam war, and when you played the same game and maybe encountered one or two of the bugs that they say they encountered (which is strange because so far only those particular youtubers encountered all the bugs in the game), you seriously ask yourself "what the fuck is this".
---
The game wasnt perfect but people spreading misinformation about it was nothing making everyone else experience wrong. People who didnt cared about those critics had for most a game experience just fine, not awesome, but fine.
---
Now I agree with you that hating on EVERY fallout youtubers is 100% stupid, because we need people talking about the game in the good way, and seeing Fallout 76 videos is always refresing and can be interesting if done correctly, but saying that we hate all youtubers because of rightful critics (that existed, im not denying that) is also wrong, as wrong as those particular youtubers that amplified the game's problems by spreading missinformation and making the game look worst than it actually is.
---
No offense.
---
Dense chest piece or fireproof perk will fix that.
---
I have the slowest internet offered in my region, 25 mbps and have no issues. That’s all I can say.
---
TSE weapons rely on hitting you 4 times per shot, with 2 being Explosive damage, which are always Physical in this case.
---
You can reduce this damage by adding:
---
-Fireproof  (Endurance)
---
-Padded or Dense torso armor mods.
---
- Serendipity (Luck)
---
-High DR value.
---
-Adamantium Skeleton 3 (Endurance)
---
Use DR to reduce the damage further. Explosions are calculated as another hit, doing 20% of the bullet's damage. Your DR actually reduces this damage twice.
---
The TSE will trigger the explosion on both bullets, but the secondary shot deals reduced damage. It's explosion will be 20% of that reduced damage.
---
If they are spec'd to maximize the Explosion dps, they will be unable to damage you. If they are spec'd for raw damage, your survival is dependent on the first, more powerful hit to be negated by Serendipity.
---
This happens 20+ times until they reload.
---
Adamantium Skeleton 3 (no limb damage) will counter Tormentor 3 (15% to cripple limb on hit) from proc'ing 4 times per shot.
---
Inaccurate and break fast as hell.
---
I think you need to play the game. Usually that helps level you up.🤔
---
I don't have any power armor paints, and 3 paints for all types of armor seems like a good deal, but I'm not sure if a basic red, blue and aqua are gonna be good long-term.
---
Junkies Explosive Handmade user here. Get good 😉
---
Super duper doesn't work with ammo Smith like it doesn't work with crafting alcohol. It just doubles the base like I said. If it did work you'd make 84 .45 rounds per proc. Instead what happens is ammo Smith makes 42 rounds and super duper doubles whatever is the base is without ammo Smith card perk card equipped.
---
No it seems no one really did lol
---
This one got me in the feels 😢
---
Gots to do the walking so that the story keeps talking unfortunately.
---
Not as far as I can tell. I've been wandering the Forest clearing Photomode locations from the Challenges for about an hour now, and no glitches or disconnects.
---
Alright. Good thing that I’m the mayor.
---
I’ve had several disconnects and crashes this last week
---
I don't have good enough gear to progress. I keep dying can't kill anything,or complete quests, or get better gear.
---
I lost the protectron that way. Thank god I have my Mr. Handy.
---
I really love X01
---
Again, you cant out dps them because of the damage cap and you dont have the damage reductions perks of bloodied so you original claim cant be true.
---
I'd pay good money to get automatic doors or a circuit timer that can serve the same purpose.
---
Yes.  The camp disappears so no more damage can be done, then you can hit play again and it will log you in to a different server (world).  Also recommend putting pacifist mode on.  I took it off for some reason.  There's a lot to learn and wish I had know about this sub before I started.
---
The odds of getting a legendary crowned super mutant that has that gun in its loot pool has got to be astronomical.
---
I’m guessing the seller got it while unstarred legendaries were a thing, but only that player knows.
---
Quite a unicorn.
---
I have it ad have tested it with a full build. Unless you get staggered your almost invincible.
---
Aaronholdt homestead. Lots of flat ground out there for building, and low level area.
---
I am not right that my BE gatling plasma gets Ignored by people with sent assassin and serendipity? Weird because I tested it with friends so I guess the game is wrong and you're right. My bad.
---
AAE all the way
---
Shit spawns inside houses, can go through walls. It's not like a closed door keeps literally anything out. But....lock your doors, and put something people can interact with next to a window?
---
Not a bad idea very appropriate for a farmers market or flee market. Very good idea thanks appreciate it
---
Combined with sent assassin it doesn't get through
---
Wait, if a player is in a workshop and you claim it they become enemies?
---
- 1 chameleon piece
---
- unyielding to fast travel, barter, vats, sneak, ap, crit refill, share perks, melee damage, scrap/learn from equipment
---
- sentinel for pvp or combat while overencumbered 
---
- reduced weight weapons for walking arsenal
---
- cavalier for melee or low perception build
---
- exterminator, poison resist for vault 94
---
- wood armor for pve
---
- bolstering for bloodied, vanguard for junkie
---
- ap refresh is the best secondary slot
---
- rad resist for bloodied (backpack does it better)
---
Kill all the things that got you from level 1-34.....just keep grinding and pick your perk cards wisely.
---
Sounds like someone is crying because things require at least a little “effort”.
---
Trading and PvP
---
I'd say 1K is fair.
---
I spoke too soon. Just froze on me lol
---
Rifles would be stealth commando
---
Agree
---
Yeah, we've been asking for a "craft all" option since BETA lol
---
Me
---
Creatures open doors too.  Camps break.  You’re going to have to live with it.  If you have vending, more people are going to come to your camp and they’ll get spawns.  Not all spawns are obvious to visitors.  The number of times that I’ve heard distant gunfire to see a scorched or super mutant sniping someone’s camp at maximum range is pretty significant.  I’ll take care of obvious stuff, but I’m not doing a security sweep of everyone’s camp I visit.  And I wouldn’t expect them to do it for mine.
---
I was getting so many Glowing Mole Rats attacking my camp that I would average one legendary a day from those that my turrets killed.  But I wanted vending income, so I had to put up with it.
---
The community is awfully rude and narrow minded. Other than that I love the game. Just play alone like any other fallout🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Definitely makes the quest a ton easier; I did it *after* I nuked Prime... kind of kicked myself in the butt for not doing it sooner lol.
---
It’s all personal preference. If you want some paints for free play nuclear winter. There are a few skins in there.
---
All you can do is make fake stories. Truth is it was a 2v2, you had Hillbilly on your team. I was recording the whole time, I wasn't hacking, you only killed me *once* and that's when you turned on your 1 shot hack. I was recording dude. Also if my dad told you something, would you be enlightened to tell me his name?
---
Just add the 10% to whatever you were going to charge and make the buyer pay for it. Doesn't work for small things like ammo, but it's good for everything else.
---
I mean, I thought of setting something like that up but I can already read posts like "I got trapped in a CAMP!!1!" Cost of business, I suppose.
---
It's a stupid way to do a caps dump.  
---
It makes no sense to put a tax on a machine the player owns. There's no government or group you belong to that could tax you.  
---
A good caps dump would be a usable item that the player needs or wants regularly and cannot (easily) get by other means.
---
Haven't thought about NW. I'll probably just play that
---
I sneak through people's windows all the time, if there's something I can interact with. All you have to do to get out is FT.
---
There is a cap? :0 thx for info
---
Yeah, I count it as cost of business, but man, it's either 3 liberators, 3 supermutants or three mongrels hell bent on my chemistry workbench and anything in front of it for some reason. Every time I fast travel they spawn next to the door, it's not like they're hidden (except the ones that bug through the floor, that's not on the visitors)
---
Leader of the pack in the forest can net 3x 1* and its pretty easy. Not sure about farming it though, I don't know if it's been roped into the new event system or not (don't think so but don't want to fully assume etc).
---
Straight from the dev room with his paintball gun and laser musket! I wonder how much of his parents cash he spent... I feel sorry for your mother!
---
You could also build your camp over a high cliff side, and if someone is inside, grieving you, log off and drop them to their death....unless they’re in PA lol
---
What’s this new event system my dude? Does it affect how often events spawn?
---
I do that too, but there are players unfamiliar with that
---
You're rushing the game. Explore. Do side missions and events in lower level areas.
---
Note: It doesn't matter what settings I run it at. It just runs terrible.
---
Specs:
---
8x2 DDR4-3200MHz RAM
---
Ryzen 5 3600 4.2GHz
---
RTX 2070
---
any suggestions on where to farm supplies for armor or ammo?
---
I literally couldn't play due to a graphical issue that made my game play like I didn't meet specs, glad I gave it a try this year cause it runs perfectly fine and wasn't a waste of $60, but ignoring that that happened to me isn't going to fix anyone's problems.
---
Either put the machines outside and lock the doors, or live with it.
---
Most, including me, will open the door and have a look at the machine and then ft to the next machine.
---
Why? Because it takes for fuckingever between opening the doors and being able to close them, and I'm lazy.
---
reminds me of doing that mission for the scouts with the bug parts and NOT FRICKING USE SCRAP ALL...
---
It's the same UI across the board BTW.
---
I think there is a mod on PC to return the workbench repair UI to how it was before repair kits. Wholly unnecessary imo, saves one tiny step.
---
Haha sick
---
&gt;they spawn next to the door
---
That tells us that you built right atop a spawn point. If that bothers you much, you need to move .)
---
As much as I dream about buying it I have no expendable income for the foreseeable future:( is why I was hoping
---
Contact support. They will be able to restore your account.
---
Most fire damage in this game is calculated as an explosion, so dense applies. I think the on hit fire effect from Perfect Storm and Flamers as well as the Fire Trap are the only true fire damage.
---
It is also possible that you are seeing 'ghost' visual effects from an old fire explosion.
---
My argument for these "community" missions is make it so they can canonize the decrease in the amount of Scorched across the map.
---
Ah yes. That's my favorite part of the lore. Where they very specifically covered all vending machine transactions were 1:1 and had zero operation cost.
---
If it comes down to it, kill low level super mutants and scorched for their weapons/ammo/caps/junk.  Sell the weapons and junk.  You don’t need legendary equipment at that level, just use the money to make sure you have level appropriate weapons and armor.  Use a melee weapon if you are low on ammo.  Killing a level 5 super mutant with a lead pipe you picked up is hardly challenging.  Go to Morgantown airport and slaughter all of the Scorched there with a melee weapon.  With 1400 caps a day, you should be able to work something out.
---
It’s a really good idea for level 25 characters to pickup the Excavator power armor.  It’s difficult to get non-PA armor right at that level and Excavator gives a lot of carrying capacity.
---
I think that people are confused and think they can just do the main quest and nothing else.  Side quests are part of any Bethesda game.
---
I mean, it's pressing a button before fast traveling. But I understand, to each their own playstyle.
---
Except I don't have either, your buddy bombo has them though 🙂
---
Sorry, but with the latest event nerf, farming for legos has been killed. Yes, they now only spawn here and there. With some rediqulous timer. So going to the spot and starting the event yourself is not an option. And getting  good event is rare. Only low level events pop up on the regular. Do 1 UF and you'll be waiting for about 3 hours for the next. Or server hop like the rest of us. But even that is not very reliable anymore.
---
My game was fully playable at launch and I had no issues at all, so it was very different from person to person and I think most people didn't suffer from any severe issues, it's usually the minority that sounds the loudest. But yeah it was very exaggerated
---
Uny grants bonus AP, sneak, crit refill and vats accuracy. It is much better if you can delete enemies before they detect you.
---
By level 35 you should have completed a lot of the overseers quests which are mostly low level to include getting your excavator armor. 
---
Stick to forest area mainly to resupply and kill lower level enemy.
---
Damn, I guess I’ll just have to hope on the server hopping, thanks for letting me know dude it’s a big help
---
Man they really messed up these events.
---
He did have a paintball gun and musket at one point though
---
Buff the damage to +50% and it will be perfect.
---
Tried reinstall? My only suggestion for starters.
---
Beautiful story
---
That was satisfying to read.
---
Don't worry about that man, you came up with the original thought and I just added to it. Just a great idea to have these kind of events to build a real community like in Fallen Earth and Ultima Online.
---
Yeah it made me chuckle a bit
---
Awesome find. Are those super great or something ? I got a two star version of the suppressors minigun from the purveyor with the +10% damage but never use it.
---
Thank you I’m trying but there isn’t an option on the help site to describe what’s happened. The only account recovery option is for my Bethesda account. The game is still recognizing me, but it’s like it’s not finding the saved information about fallout 76. I’ve tried syncing from the cloud, clearing the cache. I don’t know which category to submit a ticket under.
---
I just found it out. Apperently you can't have G-sync on and you need to lock your monitor at 60hz. Because if the game is locked at 60fps but your monitor at 144hz then that means your game drops to 12fps for some reason
---
If he could add effects, why would he add suppressors or 10%dmg?
---
You should level up more when I was lvl 12 I was questing in Charleston. And most 1* legs give like only 5 script not. Worth. It.
---
There’s a ton in the nukashine college frat house thingy, if I remember correctly there’s a bunch on a chess board
---
Certain events have been designated as public events now. You’ll get a notification on your screen, you can travel to them for free, and you won’t lose anything if you die there. This new system has changed the frequency of certain events 
---
   
---
I don’t think Leader of the Pack is a public event.
---
It takes maybe two seconds. If two seconds is that important to you, fine, but that's kinda lame.
---
The paint on it is VEEEERY rare
---
I need to look into that, thanks!
---
I’m hoping it’s just my bad luck.
---
I always scroll through my junk to see if there is anything I would rather display nowadays, before scrapping
---
I have a pic of me and all my friends during the first week of launch. 
---
All of them except for me deleted the game😔
---
Idk but automated trading system has tax in all? mmos...
---
This is usually due to people not realizing the level-up process has two steps, where you choose a SPECIAL to increase on the first screen, and then choose a perk card on the second screen (which, by default, filters perk cards based on the SPECIAL chosen in the first screen). It's possible she's getting mixed up between choosing a SPECIAL and changing the perk card filter.
---
If you're certain this isn't the case, my only other thought is if you're on PC and using mods which haven't been updated to the most-recent game version.
---
What's a blind junction
---
Oh didn’t know that, I’ve not scrapped any legs, I’ll get my levelling done then, cheers dude
---
that's the thing though, the scabber one is completely different. completely might be an overstatement but it's definitely less golden (more metalic-looking, like cheap paint) and the wood is brighter, the original gold one had this coated-looking wood. no rust either, or skulls.
---
some people don't like the whole raider shebang. plus there was a silver one:

---
As someone else suggested, scrap enemy armor and weapons. If you feel like that's not enough pick up everything you see and scrap it. You can bulk and sell the excess to robot vendors.
---
I usually do the same, well not this time. :(
---
Although you can mix and match to get a quite unique looking set
---
Ill probably be on most nights. Add me so that way i can jump to your location. Rellik-066 is my psn.
---
Its good, but there are way better heavy weapons like the gatling plasma or 50 cal
---
There is alot of challenges you can complete. I mean, if you like it, buy it. You rnt forced to buy atoms with rm in FO76, just dont be lazy (not trying to assume u r).
---
I one shotted you because I am blooided and unyielding with chems, no hacks just a fun hybrid build with a really nice auto handmade blap blappp and AS armor that's how I dropped 3 of you at one point... I gotta admit winning a few rounds 2vs1 then 3vs1 was pretty fun. Why don't you all play NW? I have never seen any of you in my NW servers. I see happycabbage and neinbeast even fentor plenty but never you guys...
---
If you take the power plant workshop and have it processing cores and are off questing across the map, can anyone then kill you or do they need to contest the workshop first? Not sure how it works.
---
 Hi there. Nothing wrong with your Special numbers but can you post a. Screenshot of your perk cards?
---
That lever rifle is fine but you need the Rifleman Perk cards to bump up the damage, also if rifles are your thing add all the stealth perks so that your sneak shots can be multiplied up to 3.5 times. 
---
As far as mutations go, the most important for you might be eagle eyes for VATS, healing factor for general health, adrenal reaction boosts strength when low on health, definitely speed demon and of course marsupial. I have most of those in my vending machines but if you’re desperate I can sell you some if them for 100 caps each as you sound like you need a hand :)
---
Yeah, at the absolute least for boiled water. Does anyone really worry that they won't have the 5 dirty water they wanted to keep in their inventory?
---
Perseverance, luck and stupidity. Thats all it was
---
They put some of them on a list of sorts, and only one of those will be active at a time. Was a patch or two back. 
---
I still get notifications from a mod on PC for other ones however, that I don't think were added to that list, Leader of the Pack still procs with that mod but the others show up in a splash screen like Scorched Earth or Encryptid (Camp Fire Tales is on the list, One Violent Night, a few others).
---
More or less the same for me, to be fair to them I was a die hard fallout fan before them. So I was never going anywhere..... But unfortunately the way the game started out lost my friends, and I've had no luck at all getting them back.
---
No you were hacking, you did the same shit vurk does, you broke my 150% repaired chest piece in 1 shot. What rounds did you win? All I saw was you dying tbh. I don't play nw because of people like vurk.
---
Oh also I can make you a max level lever or handmade for free if you can help out with some screws...
---
Would be easier to implement the first said option tho. Also completely reasonable.
---
I have been trying to collect cooking oil since fasnacht, I feel your pain.
---
Whitesprings needs to be moved towards playerhub status, full stop
---
I farm for specific things like adhesive and I’ve visited quite a few camps that had crops.
---
I really want to know what he was saying on the mic before and after lmao.
---
I waited for them to go on sale for this reason. They seem like a decent deal, but I didn't know if I'd ever actually use them.
---
Seems a lot simpler to run different areas solo and one shot everything instead of taking time for a whole team to tag stuff and use pea shooters. Everything respawns for each person when they enter an area anyway. I ran big bend tunnel at least 25 times today and not once found it empty despite seeing a ton of other people doing the same thing.
---
Gym Equipment that gives stat buffs like in Fallout 4.
---
Sell a Gym Rat bundle with some wearable sweat towels, head bands and sweats added to the mix.
---
that it is. I can't comment on the combat armor thing except for this: there was one instance in the past where an atom shop skin for the pump-action shotgun was removing 2nd stars from 3\* ones. like a two shot explosive with faster reload one would become two shot with faster reload. that roll shouldn't even be possible.
---
it's happened only once and was fixed, but still. I don't know if the affected weapons ever returned to normal, either.
---
I play on PC too and lost 4 pieces of gear, 2 of those legendary. since I changed the reload key and started playing without the R key on my keyboard, I haven't lost a single one. do take this as anecdotal evidence though, as you could lose items to a vendor or the scrip machine as well.
---
I think it only affects goo and ash piles. energy weapon users should loot everything in those piles or else new enemies won't spawn.
---
It was/is playable. I have a fucking Platinum trophy. I played the game. I will play the game tonight.
---
https://i.gyazo.com/b52b36ef55544107be9a1ef7964e148c.jpg
---
Nothing special tbh i need more cards which ill get after 50
---
Idk if i have screws. Also i have no clue what those mutation are tbh i dont know much about the whole endgame i had the game since it came out but i just came back. 
---
And I think i like shotguns more but how good can it be
---
Open a ticket with Bethesda if you’re worried about that happening to anyone else
---
Okay, sure. I participated in the Beta, so I actually wanted to play an unfinished game.
---
Just grind the daily missions because they give 2-10 scrip directly per completion and there's about a dozen you can run a day.
---
Leader of the pack is OK but you only get 15 scrip total from all three legendaries and usually someone else swoops in and grabs at least one of them before you get to it.
---
You can run any event though and there's a chance for legendary enemies and a chance for a legendary as a reward afterward. I've even had 3 star ghouls spawn at Fertile Soil before (lol it was a 3 star level 1 ghoul).
---
It’s all about resources. First off, you need caps. Early on I found the easiest way to get caps was selling water and tatos. Set up as many water purifiers as you can. Then plant tatos, with the hard bargain and green thumb perks you get 4 caps for each tato. Log in daily even if you aren’t going to play much and hit the vendors.
---
Weapons and armour. Stick to the forest and kill all the scorched and super mutants you can. Scrap the weapons to get mods and junk. Mod your weapons to be better and use the junk to make ammo. Also pick one type of weapon and get more damage perk cards.
---
Xp. Sleep in a bed before doing anything. Once you have modified your gun and have a few stimpaks, store your junk and try some slightly harder areas on the map. You may even be able to bag a legendary and get a better gun. If you die, no worries. Try again. Repeat as necessary. Also, following the overseers quest isn’t a bad idea.
---
I definitely found that between levels 25 and 50 felt slow and grindy. But by level 50 you should have your perk cards in order and access to good weapons and armour. Makes life a lot easier.
---
I never close mine. Deep in the Mire ... its really kinda peaceful. ;)
---
Dont take it too literally. After you get your ticket to a person, they will attend your individual problem.
---
I'd be polite and somehow introduced it tho, since it wont fit to any issue descriptions.
---
Good luck!
---
Didn’t know daily missions gave scrip thanks dude
---
Many detractors of Fallout 76 haven’t even played it once, just read clickbait articles and reddit rage posts.
---
It's the fuckin wasteland bro you expect these people to have manners?
---
I I don't think these guys remember it's a literal bitch to find ammo around lv 35 you're struggling so hard can't kill anything. are you on PlayStation 4 I can make you a decent gun give you some ammo so you could get some kills these guys don't fucking remember at level 35 you could be buying bullets for eight caps each from that stupid machine because you need them that bad to kill something I was there and I struggled now I make bullets by the tens of thousands
---
I think your right. I will rather frequently see meat piles remaining but new enemies. If there are goo piles may as well just server hop and throw a facepalm.
---
Use a build site like www.nukesdragons.com to plan out a build. For all the attention that legendary weapons get, they’re only a small part of the equation. Your build is really what determines how much damage you can do.
---
I did it till i got to the caverns and then bailed cuz i kept dying, i went back and turned the quest on but it told me to start from the beginning of the quest. But instead i just went into the cavern and found the last tape which finished the guest for me
---
You just called your friend vurk out for hacking, good job! I don't know how to hack nor do I because I don't greif people and only PVP for fun not competitively so why would I waste my time...
---
Thank you that’s what I did. I don’t understand how something like this is even possible. I knew something was weird when I turned the game on and the character option in the main menu was missing, then when I pressed play it didn’t give me any option to choose a nuclear winter server- just sent me right to the beginning of the game with the cutscenes. I quit and restarted, same thing, cleared my cache and restarted Xbox, same thing, cleared local saves to sync from the cloud, same thing. It doesn’t make any sense.
---
For some people hating on Bethesda’s Fallout games is part of who they are. They’re gonna lose their minds once anyone at all criticizes Outer Worlds.
---
When you start completing it with a team is all but a waste of resources.
---
So? Everyone already knows he hacks, you can just go on YouTube and find videos. Yes you do know how to hack, stop playing dumb.
---
Go to the party house in morgantown or one of them in the frat area. They have a chessboard with loads of models that look small but are near enough the same size when you display them
---
Shut up
---
I’ve been having issues this week. Load screens are often not loading—it just looks like freezing, but still eventually takes me where I was going. Also lots of random crashes to the main menu.
---
That's amazing. I hate the feeling not being able to do anything after someone kills me simply because I don't have great armor or weapons, but this gives me so much hope that I can do it someday.
---
I remember the days before vendors when we had to grind to get stuff....  
---
-old man
---
This post was made to send a message to someone, your on PS4, why can't you just message him yourself instead of making a whole post about it.
---
you should definitely have a "build" at level 49. 50 is essentially the cap. you don't need legendary weapons to have a strong character, although even 1\* ones help immensely. ask around the market and I'm sure people will sell you 1\*s for cheap.
---
you like what? bolt rifles, semi rifles, auto rifles? shotguns? melee? you \*should\* pick one and specialize on it, but that would require you to move special point around (after level 50). or you could just pick all 3 rank 1 cards for each weapon class (rifleman, commando, shotgunner, slugger, etc.).
---
Thank you, it wasn’t specified when I had read about it.
---
Level  50 is where most gear caps, so once you get there you can start acquiring better stuff. Before then it's rather a waste.
---
These are starting to sound like Craigslist missed connections! It's a game bro.....your "eyes" NEVER "met"
---
Yes, some players find it distasteful, but the community has accepted it. Some players just raise their prices by ten percent to offset the tax. 
---
There just isn’t any good cap dump for endgame players. We can easily find anything we need and just craft the rest. 
---
They could make basic resources much more scarce but that only hurts the new players even more. 
---
The most popular cap sink idea seems to be some variant of “build your own legendary” where you can pay big caps to mod a legendary or narrow down your roll at Murgrhrgr’s shop. Something Beth would never do.
---
It sounds like you probably haven’t picked great perks. That usually leads to low damage, which leads to excessive ammo use and quicker degradation of weapons and armor. 
---
Rewind a bit, go grind some low level areas to get a few levels, invest the new perk cards in damage cards for the weapon types you want to use.
---
You think that was a real Beta?
---
I don't think it's in the social event list, I've seen it a few times in the last couple of days.
---
I love shotgun but i feel like the down side to it is having to be right close to the person, but if i can 1 shot em then no problem. Else I see that people use energy minigun builds that looks pretty decent
---
Yeah i figured im almost there
---
Right! AND you could name your stall and place camp decorations for aesthetics as eye-catchers!
---
Your perk card set looks like you’re set to do basic amount of damage with most types of weapons. You should pick a style of weapon to use and focus you cards into that. Like heavy weapons or shotgun, rifles and commando. Weapons like that share special categories so it’s just a matter of switching out a few cards to get max damage bonuses. The other thing I would recommend is only use lockpicking and hacking cards when picking locks or hacking terminals. Otherwise you are wasting that special point instead of adding additional damage bonuses.
---
It's concept art, so I don't think calling it 'either cut or upcoming' is right. It might have never been anything more than an idea. 
---
They aren't committed to making something out of every sketch an artist makes!
---
Just to hear you whine about it would have been satisfaction enough for me.
---
Interesting that one of the triggers is the Punga Fruit from Point Lookout.
---
What do you mean? You can't get exp? Even shooting level 1 mobs gets you exp eventually? So you can't go against level 68 Super Mutants, but you should still be able to level up.
---
Yeah true about lockpick and hacker i thought about it but i dont think ive got any other good cards yet. Also I love shotguns but the downside of having to be in front of the mosnter sucks. If i could have a shotgun build whern i want and switch to energy minigun?
---
Yeah you got me frogo, I'm a L33T HaCkOr tottaly! Ask around everyone knows lol seriously I am just a Bloodied unyielding hybrid with chems lol that's a really nice complement though, I appricate it! I once accused speechify of hacking and then realized he was just really good at PVP and running a bloodied unyielding build.
---
I can tank a 5mm Minigun with Serendipity alone.
---
I crafted all my gear until around level 65 when I started getting decent legendary drops.
---
 I never had an issues of not having gear or problems leveling up.
---
Yes, because 1 shot from a handmade with bloodied and chems will 1 shot me and instantly break a 150% repaired chest piece, I was recording the whole thing. Stop playing stupid, oh wait, you can't stop playing stupid because your are stupid!
---
Agreed.
---
Go straight to the cavern and skip the 1st few parts. 
---
 Once you find what you are looking for in the cavern the quest will update
---
I'm on PC, can't tell what platform you're on. But I'm sure I have something decent laying around you can have, I can set you up with mutation serums too if you want. Need starched genes perk to keep them up
---
NM see "PC help" tag. Add me if you want, secthegreat
---
I would recommend nukesdragon.com it has a good special builder that you can change cards until you find a layout that works for your play style. You can also level up shotguner perk cards to increase the damage. Level 1 +10%
---
Level 2 +15%
---
Level 3 +20%
---
This is the same for most if not all the weapon perk cards.
---
Im on pc too, what SPECIAL is that perk card in? Will make sure to pick it up
---
The problem is that there is no incentive for newer people to try hunter/hunted and seasoned PvPers have 900 other ways to start PvP.
---
Hunter/hunted need to be a permanent status instead of an opt-in station.
---
Sidenote: Please make the radio station repeat less or not at all. My sanity is very thankful.
---
tip: don't.
---
I've never bought bullets from a robot vendor, anyone that does is crazy. 
---
Find lead, find steel, find gunpowder ingredients, make bullets.
---
No, that would screw what little long term appeal the game currently has - the hunt for that perfect item (gun or armor).
---
It needs to be some consumable item that has a benefit that makes players want it. E.g. something that gives you an XP bonus or reduces the item decay rates of guns.
---
Oh you can equip a level 1, 2 and 3 at same time just not the same lvl
---
Example if you equip a level 1 rifleman ,level 2 expert rifleman ,and level 3master rifleman at the same time you would get 45% damage bonus to rifles. 
---
Level 1 rifleman +10% cost 1 special point
---
Level 2 expert rifleman + 15% cost 2 special points
---
Level 3 master rifleman +20% cost 3 special points
---
So this would use 6 perception special points but give you the 45% damage bonus to non automatic rifles. The levels or cards  could be in any combination with a max of all 3 at level 3 costing 9 perception points and giving you 60% damage bonus to non automatic rifles.
---
i think you'll find love from ppl who are into fallout particularly and rpg's generally.  there will always be fastpaced yolo games, but fo76 just can't run with them.  its like driving mom's camry vs her new boyfriend's porsche.  hell, in the old beth games swinging a sword was just an invisible dice roll whether u hit or not lol!
---
imho what differentiated fallout was the stories, characters, quests, and environment.  fo76 def nailed the environment, but it was just missing those other ingredients in the formula.  i was so conflicted exploring (my favorite zone, "biome-wise") the toxic valley, and the quests consisted of picking up beer bottles, or broken token return @ civil war battlefield.  (altho wavy willard mystery was very good, and they added some stuff from sheepsquatch upd8) if we asked around, the mistress of mystery would probably be described as the most "fallout" of all quests.  i think fallout players want to know why they are shooting a thing (or if i can talk my way out of it, haha).  these are the friendly fans that stick around to lvl 282 and help newbs.
---
or maybe the players just want a grindy looter-shooter legendary drop fest, i can only speak for myself.
---
but y'know the architecture of an always online game also means that things can never change (haha, get it?).  we can *find out* about all those stories, but hot damn, how nice would it have been to influence those outcomes.  if we could stop (or cause) the christmas flood... players have this function in the launching of nukes but b/c of the very nature of ol game the change/consequence is impermanent.  that also short-circuits branching quest design which adds player choice (always a good thing imo)
---
finally, the game was straight-up broken when launched and not worth the starting price.  (even No Mans Sky worked when it first came out)  its like i made this wonderful, tasty cake for me and my friends, but i didn't quite exactly finish cooking it; now we all have diarrhea (and radworms).  we'll see how things shake out with wastelanders tho
---
Also just to add, I can no longer connect any wires up, leaving me off the map for my vendors :(
---
Wrong. On so many levels. Try using vats on head. I shred every sentinel user with 2-3 shots easy
---
Because would anybody believe him if it was a bloody explosive? lol
---
Yes only through world drops, not even Murmgrr... Can't learn the mod though.
---
Some people don't need fusion cores. I only ever keep 3 and dump the rest.
---
I made a base like this. Rocket turrets on a flak tower.
---
I found mine back in January from a scorched. I have it on display at my camp. This is the second one I have ever seen.
---
Also, scrap assaultron heads and hot plates.
---
Account for your taxes with prices. 
---
For every 100 caps add on 10 caps. 
---
That way you know you're selling for that 100.
---
Isee, then i could use STR for shotguns and play with both a shotgun and rifle. But tbh i want shotgun and minigun . Also i got speed demon randomly and locked it with genes perk
---
I like it for the ability to place 6 or so industrial water purifiers and they produce significantly faster than my camp ones do
---
They're worth a lot of caps tho, and if you use power armor alot its insanely useful
---
This same thing has just happened to me, all three of my characters vanished sometime within the last 11 hours what do I do? I’m on Xbox. It was working fine 11 hours ago and now everything is fucking gone.
---
Seriously tho, there's a Grafton next to it that I farm all the time he drops some lit loot and has some decent xp
---
The Enclave and BoS disagree.
---
Great listing here:
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
(that includes all the things!)
---
Or do what I do, and charge 1 cap for all your items.
---
Yo what do you play on(PS4 pc or Xbox)? sorry about your friends it happened to me as well...
---
Yeah there's another one to the east in Charleston too
---
Yeah I don't need caps either. I only use my PA in a nuke zone farming flux and 3 cores do just fine. Other than that, it never gets used.
---
It's op
---
Still tho
---
Cap economy is a bit high rn but in a good place for ammo but guns are much slower because good drops are trade only and having all acounts maxed caps is profit waste and going to buy legends to hold for the cap placeholders is the current only way to do it. That and capturing places but why do that when i can just do a westek run get a couple cheap legendaries sell for 150/star bloody/unyeilding/bolstering for 500-2k  and just buy what i need from somone. The vendor tax on stuff was a good start but we need more cap balancing as the game stands and the room idea is cool
---
What paint is that? I had no idea weapons paint existed in game outside of the atom store and the stuff that came with the special edition of the game
---
Until the survival rejects kills you, lol
---
Nice, it's norwegiantitan. Time to grief you again, isn't it? Legacy aren't as good as you think if you know how to defend against them. I used to bring my heavy/bolstering/sentinel leather set , insultated backpack, fireproof and the usual pvp perks. legacys weren't doing shit to me.
---
Greets from xXDemolisher
---
Nah like I said it's never contested
---
Gilded
---
I see your point. Just not something I need. I only take workshops hoping someone will come take it. I don't ever build anything on em.
---
I wish this happened more often. Griefer scumbags need to pay
---
I usually build but not at the power plant since it's essentially built for you
---
It’s fear mostly.  In reality, I’ve seen it happen a bunch of times.
---
It’s important to remember that many players are suffocating in caps.  The idea of more caps is meaningless.  If you get great revenue from Fusion Cores, I think the community as a whole is happy for you.
---
Last time I took a power plant I was killed in the initial defend and then hunted after I respawned twice. Had to leave the server. Haven’t touched one since.
---
I have probably attempted to take a powerplant about 13 times, mostly just for the exp and loot, as you described.  I have been disconnected from the server on nine of those attempts so for me, I stopped trying because I got tired of being over half way complete and then randomly being disconnected.
---
I don't do it for the cores (I have 15 in my box) but I would take the workshops for the resources nearby only problem is, the last few times I've claimed a workshop, someone waits until I build up everything then one shot kills me and takes everything over.  Super annoying and frustrating when you're a level 80 being destroyed by a level 50 with some kind of super kill-o-fragilistic weapon in one shot.
---
True
---
Not sure about how you play or what not but just based on you wanting shotgun/heavy weapon build. Here is a quick layout to get you started in a better direction. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d984c55&amp;d=sb1sd0su0so0sq0s21sx0s80s30sp0sr0p01pc2pp2pe0e60em1e00eh2eo0c72ib4ic4ip1a71as2l71ls0lt1&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Hope the link worked.
---
Why would Bethesda give a flying fuck about your caps?
---
Your pops needs to wash your mouth out with soap and teach you some respec! That isn't want your stealth friend said about me being RS, you know the guy who was supposed to clap my cheeks or something lol that didn't happen we actually chatted about how you and vurk are buttbuddies and just play to greif people. Everyone at the nuke was laughing about you all sharing beefcurtins and making videos LOL such a bunch of shitkids...
---
Thanks i think yours look more interesting than someones else linked me.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f194c78&amp;d=sd0so0sp0s40sm0sn0se2ss2sv2c72a72a00as2e82ee1eh2l71lt2lu2ic2s12ip2id2pe0&amp;w=sq2s32sr2&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
His has 1 P so i cant even lockpick anything
---
same here
---
It sounds like this to me, too. I did it a few times myself when I was just figuring out the system.
---
You need to play more then. After level 50 I never held one for over 4 hours. And that was once real late at night.
---
 The mod is fairly cheap. I just need one myself. ;)
---
Did you buy the plan and not learn it yet maybe? Check your notes just to make sure
---
At least once a day, alot more for this event.  Drop one, then while my friend runs the silo I go hunt a new keycard, drop another, off to a new server.
---
Thought you'd like to know, I saw this pic used on Facebook. https://www.facebook.com/168777943288296/posts/1402386356594109/
---
Says the one who came to my discord to call me a jew f*g, who is stealth friend? And I'm not beef curtons for the last time.
---
The Pipe Revolver and Pipe Pistol benefit from both as well
---
personally I don't ever lockpick anything but you could just move 2 points from endurance, intelligence or strength into perception for the 3 lockpick cards, I guess. power user and batteries included are a great combo, yes. for power armor + gatling lasers.
---
as for legendary gear, anti-armor, furious, instigating (for melee), quad and vampire are all great options, but the best would be junkie's. get addicted to alcohol, daddy-o, daytripper, med-x and mentats and you get 50% more damage. you can get addicted to other things but those chems I listed have arguably the "best" side-effects.
---
I'll craft it for you if you bring some materials 
---
(17) Adhesive    
---
(17) Aluminum     
---
(14) Asbestos   
---
(9) Nuclear Mats   
---
(5) Cobalt Flux.    
---
(5) Violet Flux.
---
I see, also why power armor + gatling lasers? I really need to make fusion cores or find more somehow
---
Think you're just unlucky
---
The best way is to murder all the sentry bots around whitesprings, switch servers and repeat. Also a good way to get cores and antiseptic.
---
 Strange. Mine is close to those specs and running a 4k screen and it rocks. The G-Sync I forced on my Free-Sync monitor does make  small difference to smoothness.
---
 You do need to enable Fast Vsync in your Nvidia setting for the game, if you use it.
---
I sent it I'm Babu7Babu ok?
---
That's rough buddy
---
Yes got it thanks, if you're american time zone though will always be difficult as I'm UK!!
---
odly enough my dcg hits harder than my pwf.  maybee it's the extra energy mod on it but it's still 30 points lower
---
I had to lock my 144hz monitor to 60hz and disable g-sync for it to work properly
---
Damn, that's kinda cool.
---
and beer
---
I tried to use your same special layout but I’m sure it could use some tweaking. I don’t run shotguns or heavy weapons so they are definitely not my specialty. I run a full health vats sneak sniper/commando build. 
---
The key is to allocate your special points in a way that allows you to maximize your build damage bonuses while giving you the versatility swap in function cards like lockpicking and hacking as needed.
---
Edit: tweaking
---
Trade for ammo is easiest way
---
they changed the cap on all modes unless I'm thinking wrong.
---
Damn yeah i wanna use that gatling laser
---
Try it. The delay is already 2s.
---
For me it's just a bother to step inside, turn, and to wait those 2s.
---
More fake stories huh? No, I came into the discord to troll Raider Legend, I pinged him with a honkler emoji and then you white knighted him. We don't harass people, pvping in a video game is not harassment. Me and Vurk are not beef curtons, you expect a "kid" like me to know how to code hacks and shit? I didn't care about getting kicked from that discord, you never told me that you "refuse to play with cheaters" actually, back then vurk didn't even cheat. Sucks to suck right?
---
Put that button right next to the last machine and I'll hit it. But there no chance that I'll go back. :)
---
The key word here is "under."
---
Don't know why I would try it, as I already know the extremely negligible amount of time it takes to close a door. About 2 seconds. Like I said, if that's too difficult for ya then that's kinda lame.
---
Radstag outfit and hood, rocked that for awhile
---
In my opinion. Prefer the 50 cal a lot better not sure why, but feels so nice to use
---
And scrounger.
---
I prefer the .50 in general, because of the lack of spin up. They can both good though...which one do you have more fun with? :)
---
I just dropped a guy a level 20, 30, 40 and 50 Fixer. Feels good to help someone on their quest to murderize ghouls and scorched.
---
I'm not taking your bait.
---
Have a fish instead.
---
Also I talked with my stealth friend and he said you guys never talked about vurk and I, you lie more than your iq dude.
---
Kind of a longshot, still can't get the Alien Blaster from the purveyor?
---
No use for it, I'm an Herbivore.
---
I got speed demon randomly, How do i make it into a mutation syringe shot so i can keep it and try getting other mutations ?
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Ok Karen.
---
I make fusion cores with the flux I farm, no need for the power plant at all.
---
Changing texture quality to low from medium stopped all of my crashes
---
50 Cal is more fun, and slightly easier to make ammo for.
---
Did you try logging into your Bethesda account?  Perhaps you were logged or locked out of that one
---
You need a build. As others have said, pick a weapon or two and focus your cards on that. Since you're on PC, you can use [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124) to quickly switch from fighting to crafting or scrounging. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QN5TnFq98L6MOyKUv7Czw7WUIcFXrPfKH-JHmt-XxHs/edit?usp=sharing) is how I have my loadouts set up, for example. Someday Bethesda will release a version of the loadout manager.
---
In my Fallout 76 Nvidia settings I have Perfomance for the Power and Fast for Vsync. 
---
 Anticipating disbelief I DL'd Experience and I have an FPS counter in all my games now.
---
  I cannot get F76 under 56 FPS on my 75 FPS monitor. Full 4k and mostly Ultra,
---
I actually had a spot and a good turret setup that did a good job killing cave crickets and anything else that came by.  I just think it would be fun if workshops required resources and skill to take away from another player. Right now, it’s a waste of resources building anything up around them.
---
Its happening pretty frequently now, ive been playing NW from when they first implemented. Never had this before. It seems like a bug that people are exploiting just like the ones in adventure mode.
---
For someone so confident in themselves you sure are wrong. A Fixer with powerful automatic receiver does 53 damage unperked. A .50 cal with heavy barrel does 49 damage. And you can run a stealth build with the Fixer so with sneak bonuses and VATS crits it destroys a .50 cal in damage dealing capabilities.
---
Sounds more like madeup fan-fiction than actual events. Could have screenshot  or something.
---
It is a good weapon, could be worth some good caps/items depeneding on the other effects. If its just a laser rifle, then itll be less, but if its a Gatling Laser, then itll be worth more.
---
Note: If its Gatling, im interested.
---
This is my all STR weapons build. It allows me tp use most weapons in the game except for Rifles:
---
STR- 15
---
PER - 3
---
END - 6
---
CHAR - 4
---
INT - 11
---
AGI - 9
---
LUCK - 8
---
If mutations arent your thing however, you can dump the luck stat to 3 and assign the 5 points to were u feel most comfortable (recomendation being to INT and AGI).
---
RIP all that amazing shit lol
---
That’s exactly what I expect to hear every time I complain, so thank you for confirming what I know is the smartest move...: cause I thought of it
---
You’ll just have to take my word for it I’m afraid. I’m a casual gamer, I play very infrequently due to work and life commitments,
---
I’m 100% on board with this. Best idea I’ve read today!
---
Maybe the Brotherhood of Steel is on to something. Clearly we can't be trusted with this dangerous technology
---
Fallout Amazon - Every player can go to a "personal terminal" and list up to 5 things. You can purchase them from any terminal and they are delivered by carbobot.
---
Not really I pvp everyday against people who want to pvp
---
They'll eventually go on sale, so I'd wait until then. There's also a chance you'll be able to save up enough atoms for an even cooler skin that comes to the store.
---
you sir have all the best ideas
---
This has happened a lot to me and my friends, the only thing we have found that fixes it is logging out and back in to a different server sometimes :(
---
Good luck out there
---
Are you an internet troll that can only speak in questions thanks to a curse from Todd?
---
They changed it so now you can only be killed if you are at the workshop.
---
Yeah but at the same time were covering up hard materials with fabric outfits and no external appearance change whatsoever. I see no reason to not allow it frankly. Especially given some of their atom shop options that you essentially never see unless running around unarmored.
---
No need to go dragging realism into it, that boat sailed long ago.
---
I doubt others would be as enthusiastic about it as you are
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
I'm gonna say no. Too much P2W for any good. Plus the other backpack skins don't unlock any backpack or mods by purchasing, still have to go through the hoops.
---
 You are running a lot of useless perks. All the Picklocks should only be equipped if you are going to pick locks.
---
 There are quite a few others like that and replacing them with actual Damage and Defence can help a lot.
---
I know already changed that :P

Nice job moving the goal posts but you're still wrong. Unperked, the .50 cal does out DPS the Fixer by about 60. This is easily made up with sneak attack bonuses and crits. It's barely worth talking about.
---
But now if we move the goal posts yet again and compare fully perked out stealth commando vs. heavy gunner builds the Fixer widens the gap significantly. Full bloodied, tank killer, nerd rage, etc Fixer deals a DPS of fucking 5940. Full bloodied, stabilized, nerd rage, etc .50 cal comes in with a limp dicked DPS of 2673. Less than fucking half.
---
So yeah, the Fixer beats the ever loving piss out of your weak ass .50 cal. The reason you don't see them at queen fights is because they're still quite rare, not because they're bad. 
---
If you'd like to see the carnage for yourself, you may do so here:  
---
/u/frazzlebong come see this dude get rek'd
---
Yeah, I second that. Even if not for selling, it would be awesome. I imagine a sleeping bag ordeal where a prearranged blueprint could be set up anywhere, temporarily. At the very least, a tent, sleeping bag, cooking station, and stash box. This wouldn't have a huge in game impact because you can't break junk items down... And it feels like that was the direction Bethesda wanted to go at first.
---
One thing Beth did right, they cut down the radioactive half-life quite bit.
---
Would give and award but broke
---
Just kill those baddies!  But yes that is the case.
---
Killed a dude the other day while i was taking a workshop, guy no exaggeration had 1100 Lb of junk on him. Piñata is exactly what I thought when I saw the bag! Why do that? Why carry so much stuff if you know you are going into a PvP zone?
---
I don't like being killed by PvPers.
---
I've wondered what the supply/demand equilibrium looks like for stuff like this. Profitability should be maximized where marginal cost=marginal price. I just don't see how this stuff is priced right unless basic microecon just doesn't apply here?
---
Yeah I took a SHOT at a photo! Get yourself a cold Nuka-Cola bud and relax a bit!
---
Because all the opinions around the game - the reviews, most reactions - all came out at the release of the game, when it was almost as buggy as 7 Days to Die (no, I love that game too.) That’s what you’ll see online for the most part, initial reviews.
---
Thanks but i dont need a award, very cool that someone read my insane thought and thought it was a good idea...thank u appreciate it
---
This actually made me lol
---
Assualtrons Swingin' on poles, Assaultron massage with an unhappy ending...
---
What time on Monday does it end?
---
So you can't find even 3 vendors selling them and you won't buy them yourself for resale - at what should be a bargain price to you.
---
Says a lot :)
---
Like I said never contested
---
Just like you feel invalidated by my reply, cause you know.. you replied
---
The thing is, this would fix so many problems, like loading screens between camp fast travels, camp space, people trying to destroy said camps, those are just some from the top of my head but I'm sure theres more I cant thing of rn
---
fallout 3, fallout 4, Bioshock infinite.
---
I heard it was a collaboration between Michael Bay, and Ed Norton. /s
---
The main Bethesda Game Studios team in Maryland oversees the writing and quest design, or at least they did for the base game. If you're asking for specific names, no we don't know who specifically wrote what but it's all collaborative anyway.
---
honestly even any combination of all these are super great ideas, any market of some sort and just a damn bank of any sort for caps and even just guns would be SUCH a help. It really hurts me from being a fallout geek since 3 and stocking hundreds upon hundreds of guns and armor coming to 76 and having basically no freedom to have a bunch of diff guns for a flavor of the day D:
---
Fireproof perk &amp; dense armor. :) doesn’t take away all of the explosive damage but it cuts a massive chunk out of it. 
---
These weapons haven’t been the meta for a while. Fire rate is meta now. Faster you can put the hits in the faster they go down.
---
I’ll tell you what, I promise this is the last time I will reply to you on this thread. That way you can get the last word in like you so desperately crave lol
---
I want the gun emplacement plans
---
Thanks! Got 2 successful photos with it. Will try more tomorrow
---
My first play through I kept dying and therefore couldn't finish before I had to go to work. Finally on my day off I logged on and decided to hit the last transponder as opposed to hitting all of them. It worked, I got the glassed cavern waypoint and went from there, so at least that works.
---
Untrue. We tested a bloodied dragon with all crit perks and it didn't.
---
I see that you’re complaining about mobs and stuff, nobody on this post has said it dude, if you just set up a few missile turrets they should take care of any enemies?
---
The rug trick doesn’t work on the glass thingy? I can’t believe this.
---
You said to much, your word aren’t worth a paragraph, silly man.
---
Also good to know, thanks!
---
This post is about serendipity mainly and when it is used with dodgy and sent assassin you are almost invincible.
---
No spin up delay
---
You’ll get level ups occasionally, I would give it a uncommon rating
---
I think it's based on your level. I get 7,000+ xp from winning pretty often.
---
My thought was mainly about protecting my camp, i want to sell but also dont want to be visible kinda of a conundrum lol
---
Lol, yeah now it does not work. There is a 110 damage cap. Before they nerfed sentinel, before the damage cap, you could one shot full assassins sentinel set users with a critical hit.
---
The most i got when i won was 3000 xp
---
Hopefully whoever wrote Fallout 3 and it's DLC Point Lookout.
---
Its in adventure aswell
---
It has not
---
Dodgy: take 30% less dmg at 30 ap per hit (something like that)
---
Dude, are you slow? You do understand we aren't talking about craftable Fixers here, right? As I said, I can make those myself, I would never buy them from someone else, especially not you.
---
I agree
---
&gt; So, why is there still so much hate for it over the internet? 
---
Well excluding the "hater's gonna hate" point about it being such an easy target, the main issue is that you admit yourself that you didn't follow the game all that closely.
---
If you were active from the time of the announcement through to today, you would understand why some people have a distinct dislike for the game. 
---
For instance, Cohhcarnage, a popular Youtuber who was an avid Bethesda and Fallout fanboy went from being highly optimistic about the game -&gt; being open minded -&gt; being hopeful that this terribly buggy game would improve over time -&gt; outright feeling betrayed by Bethesda and disgusted by the game. 
---
Bethesda again and again failed him. Game breaking bugs, fixing no bugs with the Day 0 patch, doing a poor job at "fixing" bugs to reintroducing the bug they actually fixed previously due to incompetence with their patch management.
---
He quit a fair while ago, so did most of the dedicated Bethesda/Fallout Youtubers. There are barely a handful of people that are still covering Bethesda content when there use to be multiple dozens.
---
People who stayed on also saw Bethesda break a commitment to the Atom Store being cosmetic-only, not at all delivery a feature they promised in their roadmap (prestiege perks/legendary players), terrible implementations of end level dungeons (Arktos Pharma), buggy and laggy end level Vault raids, poor implementation and eventual abandonment of Survival PvP mode and the list goes on. This barely even scratches the surface of the issues that have plagued the game.
---
There have been some good things too. Nuclear Winter battle royale was good but that even was tainted with its own issue.
---
The TL;DR of it is that you weren't around since the beginning so you missed all the reasons why people still dislike it to this day.
---
What i do is buy lots of steel from players and just farm acid and lead. I can make 34k .50 cal per day
---
308, 38 and 10mm are everywhere.
---
damn that's rou...lly only one person's experience.  yes the can, do drop as legendary.
---
If you're in there harvesting cores, and someone contests, they can kill you. You don't have to do anything. And if you're in lag, you might not even know someone contested the workshop.
---
rl comes first.  good luck on the paper
---
Have any goodies to give away?
---
you fly the friendly fruit as well?  cheers
---
You will be fine.
---
it legit does. at least in boot camp I couldn't see shiz
---
Centralized banking/markets always leads to price fixing. I don't like it
---
This happened to me a ton before the latest patch. No idea what fixed it.
---
It’s versatile and high in potassium
---
Your having a battle of the mind with an unarmed opponent my friend. Just leave it, the guys a total idiot
---
Same answer, pal
---
Hmm so maybe there is no more Emil?
---
Lmao thanks for the tag and link. Just start replying the the guy "same answer"
---
Still better than Emil lol
---
LOL. Out my way I see. I would just go to the Fissure nearby and troll a couple back with me ... if I did that kind of thing. ;)
---
People not turning the rad shower off after they finished using it. Rad showers are a privilege not a right. I've resorted to removing the power to the rad shower when I'm not in my camp because I'm sick of coming back and finding it turned on and no one in sight.
---
Oh yeah. Sure thing! Anything that helps the community.
---
Depends. If it’s faster fire rate or explosive it’s valuable. Otherwise not so much
---
Is that the guy who came up with the awful chat wheel in fo4?
---
I'd wait. We should have Halloween stuff in a couple of weeks, it could be good, it could be meh, but it's worth it (to me) to wait. 
---
And if that disappoints wastelanders will be shortly behind that. And then Christmas after that. (Although Christmas will most likely be rereleases of last year's items. Red and white lights, Mr and Mrs. Claus outfits, animated snowman)
---
Best to wait and save (and grind)
---
I'm sorta scared to buy shit from people now lol
---
100% agree. I like the way my underarmors look, but not with huge ugly robot armor on top of it. One of the coolest things about this Fallout is being able to wear your favourite outfit without screwing up your armor, it's a shame there's no outfit version of underarmors clothing.
---
Hell there are a lot of underarmors on the Atom Shop that look awesome but you can't use them as your outfit without sacrificing your armor and even your underarmor mods. At least add an outfit version for those.
---
Personally I bought the raider tank top thingy that has the raider outfit and the tanktop underarmor, and while the outfit looks nice I rather have just the white tank top. But I can't afford to remove all my legendary armor just to look good.
---
I don’t know how the heck everyone is going to manage their inventories when the 50% off purveyor sale comes. They should really at least implement something temporary for this
---
I’m pretty sure, he also wrote fallout 3 too I think
---
The same dude wrote 4
---
Lol, I know, I just can't help myself sometimes.
---
I figured this was just another thread to shit on Emil.
---
It is insane how much it costs specially the small version of it. I made a nuka cola dinner but i cant place the damn thing
---
Me too lol. I try to educate people even when I know it wont work. He may also just be trolling. Hard to tell
---
Again, not what the argument is about. You must be like 12 years old.
---
And 'The Pitt', the hardest moral choice ever in Fallout
---
Eh do it anyway.  I'll cover you.
---
I liked 3 and 4 story’s quite a bit, I would just like more choice other than which factions you have in
---
Myself and 2 of my friends usually end up making base at Poseidon on regular basis when we are all on. Get the fusion core generator running, we then stick around get the plant running share the cores that get generated. We stole it a couple times. Got annilihated once, held our ground a few times. All of us PA so those cores come in handy, especially with the energy ammo perk.
---
This civilian gets it
---
Heeeeeere's Johnny.
---
Same answer, Pal
---
The guy is like roland emirc. It doesn't need a family dynamic dude. Just let me get the water or stop the cyborgs. I don't need a daddy drama wrapped up in it!
---
I sell bloodied laser rifles for 5-10k depending on other stars. 
---
But also in saying that. I've unlocked every laser gun mod so I kit then out for specific use before handing them off,  seem to get a bit more money doing that.
---
Lots of posts have the answer but you seem possibly newer and may need more direction.
---
1) You want to have excavator gear.  It not only gives you 100 extra pounds of carry weight, but also gives extra ore when mining.
---
2). Visit Lucky Hole Mine at the southern part of the map and mine while in your gear to collect lead.  You'll need acid to smelt this into lead bars.
---
3) Hold onto some cloth, you'll need it to make gun powder.
---
4) Collect acid.  I find cave crickets to be the best for this but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  You can find a lot of crickets at Tanagra or whatever it is called.  It's the huge tree on the far East side of the map.
---
5) Put on the perks: Ammosmith and Super Duper.
---
6) Craft ammo until out of one item.  Make gun powder as needed.
---
Note:. You can capture and hold multiplayer workshops at a time.  Snag all the lead and steel ones.  If you're having issues getting steel, I suggest the mine just east of whitespring station - where uranium fever happens.  They drop plenty to scrap and if you keep your eyes peeled, they very often drop a weapon on the floor instead of on their corpse.
---
If you are using more ammo than you can craft to get your materials, you may need to level more if you're under 50, or change your build a little.
---
Hahaha
---
I think that wants personal stuff you drag in before bigger events and that’s one of the problems because it limits options
---
Bravo 👏
---
*Me'gaton*
---
Adding in any fun content is not currently on their to do list, jk, just wait for the npc update next month
---
welcome brother!
---
&gt; Especially given some of their atom shop options that you essentially never see unless running around unarmored.
---
That's the funny thing about it, they would literally sell more atom shop underarmors if they allowed it. Hell, at least make paid underarmors able to use all mods, there's no way I'm spending money to screw up my special stats.
---
.50
---
Because it is cool.
---
Cheers dude, I’ll keep my fingers crossed in that case
---
4 teammates killed within 3 seconds, one shot each. It cant be just a sniper. Maybe im wrong but i would be really shocked
---
You do know that there are 3 powerplants, right?
---
A lot of people run builds that mostly use Instigsting and AA weapon, not massive damage like bloodied/junkies but still pretty viable.  I have wondered about a golf bag build with weapons specialized to the different foes could be kind of fun.
---
Not really an outlet for these people though. These bitches wouldn't last 2 minutes in survival. Mostly they are preying on people in Adventure mode to catch them off guard and don't have the armour+weapons build / perk setup to deal with it.
---
I feel the need to emphasise though: they are bitches.
---
it's an amazing view up there with ole Duke but foot traffic usually takes 15-20min to start flowing. per server hop I mean.
---
Which one. You've changed your answer like five times trying to find something you weren't wrong about.
---
Was on the xbox about am hour ago when we had a server disconnect. However we lucked out and it was just a couple of minutes after the fight. Just enough time to quickly loot her as her body was going still, unequip pa and go home. Had just enough time to look at pipboy, eat, drink and realize I accidentally used a lot of stims then I was booted. Maybe this was a global thing? Wish we are able to ping servers manually and select. [XBOX]
---
"Hello member, would you like to browse the Enclave Surplus Store."
---
another plus side is that it's in the perfect spot for fast traveling.  having the free vault76 on the other side of the map means every trip 8s half the price
---
I miss survival and love your proposal but that’s a boatload of development you got there.
---
Same Answer, pal.
---
Nukes literally create ultracyte underground. Which is then picked up by bats underground . We can't nuke this problem, we have to solve it by going under the map and killing all the bugs to starve put the bats ;)
---
I understand how heavy this idea is. But if they take even the smallest amount out of this and put it in the game then that'll be just that much more content for the player base
---
Cave crickets for acid?  I haven't seen one of those in so long that if I had relied on them for acid, I'd be SOL lol.  Best place I've found to farm acid Hemlock Foles Maintenance.  There are three acid veins from which to place extractors on.  Also a gold vein there too I think.
---
Vanguard Vampire/Executioner
---
I want a high lvl area, where the mobs respawn faster than anywhere else.
---
50 cal for sure. Then again, 5mm ammo literally weighs nothing at all with my stats so that gatling gun is looking hot
---
Balls.  There were a few more bugs at launch, but many people (i.e me) didn't run into them.
---
"Internet Historian" put together a stupid "hate FO76" video, large parts of which  weren't even about the game.
---
Buy steel? There are so many sources of steel.  Everything from scrapping dropped weapons to killing robots I mean I have never been short on steel.  I'm always dropping so much steel it's not even funny.  You're wasting your caps buying it.
---
A food dispenser machine!.. Like the good old Port-A-Dinner or Eatronics, make them into a vending machine, and the owner can earn some caps.
---
Theres no way your base lasted a sb attack
---
Had that happen a few days ago, he only managed to destroy a few walls before i co-incidentally fast traveled to my camp.
---
A friend and I spent the next 15min gaming up two silos.
---
Launched one at fissure prime. Waited for him to show up and commit to the fight.
---
Launched the second at his camp, didn't notice a damn thing :D
---
Yeah but the Charleston one is the good one
---
use diluted stims for bloodied my dude.  it will heal you enough and save you stims.  good hunting
---
I didn’t say it did. But I built it...
---
&gt; If you were active from the time of the announcement through to today, you would understand why some people have a distinct dislike for the game. 
---
Would you? I started with BETA and I still have no clue why "some people have a distinct dislike for the game".
---
Cool! Let me know how it turns out.
---
