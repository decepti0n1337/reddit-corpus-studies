Throwing grenades at random shit is always good clean fun. All the cool kids are doing it!

Thanks for the post.  I couldn't figure out what the heck was going on with Grahm as he was destroying my camp.  He has done it twice now and I can't find a way to stop him, he just seems to stop on his own.  
---

---
I couldn't wait three hours so from now on I'll just let him at it and go do something else.    What a bunch of junk though.  If you can't control the NPC just remove him!
---
Yeah that’s very possible, especially if the guy was in god mode or stacking chems and Crits w concentrated fire
---
It would be worn more if the mods dropped more often. I've done hundreds of queen fights and *finally* got the Calibrated Shocks (.081% chance of drop) a couple of days ago. Now hundreds more to get the Emergency Protocols (.315% cod).
---
And now it's pretty much outclassed by the T-65 PA.
---
My set up isn’t that good either. I just keep moving and sprint from pylon to Pylon and hope I don’t get Goku’ed
---
What's the old lady gonna do, scold me? She abandoned us! She's got it coming!
---
I am going to a full health build because of this glitch.  I get bored when I never die but I hate that glitch so bad haha
---
Does this really work? It's happened to me about 3 times and I have just quit out of the game and lost my legendary rewards.
---
^you ^shouldn’t ^have ^SAID ^that. ^Now ^the ^Sole ^Survivor ^is ^going ^to ^KILL ^your ^character ^RELENTLESSLY ^with ^his ^Fallout ^4 ^weapons ^and ^armor ^that ^are ^more ^OP ^than ^your ^BEST ^guns ^and ^BEST ^armor. ^YOU ^WILL ^DIE ^BITCH
---
The people in game are really cool.  But this subreddit is awful I have never seen so many complaints. This is also the buggiest game I have ever played which probably is the cause of that.
---
What?
---
Yes. And the fact that you can transfer items to miles using your private server makes it a no brainer.
---
Respawn info here: [https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0](https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0)
---
I’ll help you out, gt is JJnsyd, I just completed that myself
---
Go sneak bloodied commando. You don’t need a legendary weapon, get as much unyielding armor on you as possible. Take all damage perk cards, and get a handmade with silencer. You need a psychobuff, around 10 super stims, before the imposter go down.
---
That’s so dumb lol miniguns should not be capable of fulfilling the role of long ranged one shot killer. Maybe this game isn’t worth getting back into lmao
---
sad
---
No she flies away if she's ignored. The only time it actually makes a negatice difference firing at her in the sky is if people have staggering perks on like one gun army which causes her to stagger in the air so she won't land. Otherwise, despite popular opinion, firing at her in the air keeps her attention and makes her a little less like to decide something in the nuke zone is more interesting.
---
It's worthwhile to keep it for that reason to me.  I spend as much time on my camp as I do my gear and stuff.  It's a major facet of the game for me.  I have a display case with the blade of bastet, the eye of ra, tattered dress (for now), veil, and phantom device.  I was seriously bummed when I discovered it was gone and I really have no idea what happened.
---
I enjoy watching people mindlessly attack it
---
It works for me and everyone I play with
---
Shhh. There really is something satisfying about getting a 1500 damage headshot with a pipe revolver.
---
The sequence will be like vats shooting (~15 bullets) -&gt; quit vats and heal -&gt; repeat. I’ve never done a sneak shotgun vats run it could possibly work and maybe quicker.
---
You can’t just leave the game bc you got stomped in pvp one time by a guy that probably has a specialized build for killing people like that, just avoid workshops until you get better gear or you run the risk of getting killed like that
---
I found that having any object above my toon's head would let ft fail.
---
Supposedly June 30th.
---
To answer one of your questions, picking up junk and loot off the floor or from the environment will mean others can't take it, but in all honesty most players have an abundance of all resources, so feel free to take any good junk you find. Plus, it respawns fairly often. Picking up loot off of corpses or containers however is only for you, meaning every corpse or container will have instanced loot for each player. You're not swindling anyone by looting bodies or boxes. Fair warning however, you must actually do damage to an enemy for it to drop items (ie letting other players kill enemies means you won't get any loot or xp). The only requirement is that you hurt the enemy, you don't have to get the killing blow for loot to drop. Even if you're in a group fighting a high level beast, just doing any amount of damage will net you full access to loot and xp (excluding the final boss of the game, no spoilers, but you must do at least 1000 damage to it to get loot)
---
Pretty much,  on a public server it turns into a mob there's always a few that don't stop so at that point God knows if there gona land so it's burn it down in the air.  Now if nobody else starts firing wont start it. But there's always somebody who what no idea.
---
Personal preference.  You should be able to level much faster on an experienced character, but having a leveled alt has it's own advantages.
---
I did know actually bud, but the design in these games barely resembles the original designs
---
They shortened the length of time it is dark, yes. They also adjusted the day/night lighting.
---
This.  Op or ops teammate kept seeking revenge. This let the other player continue to pvp.
---
Just respawn instead of seek revenge if you don't want to pvp.
---
Thanks, I'll give it a go.
---
[removed]
---
I never get disconnected usually either. Its just been the past 4-5 days. Nothing has changed and everything is running consistant on my end. Why all of the sudden am i having to deal with this shit.
---
Night time is the same exact hours of the day as before wastelanders. They just changed when it gets dark. Sandman and nocturnal were not affected by the change at all.
---
With a bloodied minigun, adrenal reaction, the heavy gun perk cards, nerd rage, bloody mess, and a couple other perks, 1 shotting a player is easy.   
---
Same with Junkie, some chems, and some perk cards.
---
To bad it won’t happen cause you have fallout 1st
---
This would be cool if there wasn’t an almost zero percent chance to be on that server.
---
Yep
---
A racoon pissed on a isp box 3 blocks over. Litteraly could be a the answer.  There's way to many pieces to source remotely.
---
Oh shit you're right lol. 
---
I usually just save scrip during the week then do a big batch on the weekend so my bad didn't think that through
---
I've never gotten a 1\*, but I've dumped so many 3 and 2 star piece of complete trash it's depressing.
---
Exactly!!! You would think it'd be all vault themed.
---
Easy fix, Playstation Gamertag is Farthing1
---
When i logged in today, still no marker. But it was showing up in the 'Daily' section, so that's something lol.  Thanks
---
What! Are you serious? So 5 a day, thats insane. Im trying to get stangler heart power armor. That means will take what, a month and a half to 2 months.
---
Yes that would be PERFECT! Exactly what I had in mind
---
i left the game 6 weeks after it came out because it was broken af with no end in sight, and all content had been had. 
---
If literally any gun can kill any player from any range, wtf is the point? I’m lvl 87 and have DECENT gear, not god tier but you can’t tell me ultracite PA is weak, and that 340 health isn’t beefy. Idk
---
All good dude! I prefer the 3 a day so I don't get bogged down with too much leftovers
---
If they fix magic damage and don't fix health rubber banding I'm deleting this POS.
---
Any caps I make from the daily quests have been already used for fast traveling. Often, I’m losing more than I make. Faction hubs should really be free.
---
yeah.  the weirdest parts are the places bethesda added wastelanders npcs... but didn't unclutter the area with dead bodies.  like...  they took the point to remove and shuffle a bunch of items, like the apc that was outside the guard shack on the road to the main enclave bunker door and the truck that had all the signs near the witesprings train station.  yet they can't be bothered to realistically get rid of dead bodies.
---
i think they did remove some of them, like a few that was in the church in flatwoods i think are gone, but i can't remember.
---
I guess. Shit just makes me wanna throw my console at the damn wall when it happens. Its discouraging as hell.
---
Server hop, as much as you have scrip for :-)
---
1 shotting someone with a 5mm shot out of a minigun from 100+ yards shouldn’t kill any lvl 50+ player with armor on, at all. Maybe just my opinion
---
76 got sealed and all oxygen got jetted
---
Often loading completely into a different game, then backing out and then reloading fallout 76 will fix these type of errors for me.
---
There’s a whole group of “firerunners” on ps4 that I know of, all of em know their way around the fire and the briefcases to say the least.
---
The fallout has never been PvP argument is asinine (no offense to you personally). You know what else Fallout has never been? Multiplayer. 
---
Saying Fallout shouldn't have PvP because it wasn't in past games is as bad as the people who said Fallout 3 shouldn't be a FPS RPG because 1 and 2 were turn based RPGs. This isn't the past games. This is its own game. Just because a franchise is not known for something doesn't mean they can't include it or do a good job with it.
---
Balancing PvE vs PvP kits is not as ridiculous a task as it may seem, especially when you consider the fact they could literally balance them almost completely separate of each other. They already have shown they're willing to do so as is evident from the damage cap PvP has. With some thought and effort it could absolutely be done. Shit, half the changes that need to be made to Adventure mode PvP have already been implemented in Nuclear Winter so it's not like they're completely clueless as to how to make PvP work.
---
The vast majority of the player base could care less if PvP was balanced or not though. The majority of the player base seems to have no interest in it, and typically just one bad experience makes them feel like PvP is toxic and should be removed. I'm getting downvoted to oblivion for just for saying that a part of the game should be made better. I get PvP isn't in a great state, but I want to see the game improve for EVERYBODY who enjoys it, not just one specific group.
---
i could help you with the revive, but the game isn't letting me log in right now for some reason.  will poke my head back in here if i manage to get in.
---
I thought the same thing at first then when I join a friend to buy something I saw that I could buy more lol
---
If ur having trouble you can post here and alot of people would be willing to help
---
Someone rolled up to my camp and left Communist Propaganda in a bag on my doorstep once, does that count?
---
The last time I got stuck in a 3v1 we were in a nuke zone approaching the final ring, I was a bush wookie with Chameleon and an ample supply of radx/radaway.  As the ring settled I'm on the far edge as they begin sweeping up and down in a grid looking for me, as they start getting close I pull out a grenade and launch it at the opposite side of the ring.  They all turn to look and I dash for the center, none of them see me.  As the ring begins closing they return to the center and are just meters away and one of them with a 50cal just starts shooting in a circle hoping to flush me out.  Just as his line of fire reaches me he has to stop and reload but didn't stop moving so as soon as he starts firing again the first shot zooms past me.  The ring closes in on all of us and they're just standing there with no clue what the fuck is going on, probably thinking I'm a hacker.  As the damage ramps up I hit my last stimpak, stand up, hit the hello emote and fall over dead a meter away from all three of them.  Could have probably won it if I'd had just a few more stimpaks.
---
wouldn't we need to be on the same server as you too lol?
---
Yup, encumbered, can't fast travel, waiting for the communist bots to refresh my daily ration of scrip/caps/bullion.
---
Loop is mostly staring at a wall or server hopping looking for Census Violence so I can finally get shielded.
---
So loop is basically communism.
---
Cool cool just let me know. If not it’s all good.
---
Yea if you run two characters both max daily scrip and caps, it would keep you busy for a while every day lol
---
In order to try different builds it’s a lot easier if you have different characters instead of moving the perks around on one character.
---
Yes but you can server hop to find it if you think you have the right location
---
Cuz reeding iz hard
---
noobs will get lit up trying to go in to do missions
---
I love that spot. It’s been popular for a while, but since Wastelanders dropped, my camp has been more likely to not be able to be placed :)
---
Nice
---
But my free meat.
---
Indeed
---
Thanks, ill look into it
---
Done
---
This is what I will do.
---
Awesome - Now I am an UwU-Raider
---
Most people I've encountered like to talk because they are just playing the game to relax. 
---
To find like minded people wait for the Update 20 that is bringing Public Teams. 
---
If the loot is in a container or a creature then every person has their own loot to pick up, a creature will not drop any loot if you do not do sufficient damage to it before it dies. Loot that is just laying around will disappear after someone picks it up so only one person in a team can pick up free-lying loot. 
---
Most people do not assume that you are a griefer as long as you spam the "Hello" emote and you stay by the side and not in their way. 
---
Getting scammed in this game is pretty difficult, if someone baits you into PvP and knows the location of your base they can seek revenge, go to your base and destroy it entirely. Players can only damage buildings if they are engaged in PvP, don't fight and you won't get griefed. Turn on Pacifist mode in your settings to ensure that you will never accidentally shoot someone.
---
That’s what I thought. I wasn’t sure why op doesn’t want people shooting at her in the air.
---
I stopped buying from Smiley because there isn't really anything else I want from bullion, although I'll eventually buy the T65 just to have it as I hit cap.
---
I'm almost out of things to spend caps on too.
---
I'm stockpiling scrip in the form of modules because my SS armor is "good enough."
---
Only time I use mister sandman and nocturnal weapons are on my stealth character with night eyes so I know when to use the nocturnal gear
---
Maybe not, but frankly doubt it was one shot anyways. Most likely got hit 2 or 3 times and just didn't see it. A minigun already fires fast, if it has 25% fire rate increase, it'd be almost indistinguishable.   
---
The player also could have used a crit in vats to headshot you, I use vats with my minigun to save up crits for certain fights and they are devastating.
---
I just activate all 3 pylons and run around in circles and hope the other players take sheepsquatch out pretty quickly, last time we finished in like 4 minutes and I didn’t die once. It helps that I use my x01 power armor with the medic pump
---
Or we could just get text chat instead of trying to coordinate through interpretive dance, but that's another feature we get to miss out on thanks to consoles.
---
O haha ok i feel dumb. I thought it was 5 steel a day.
---
Until loadouts! Maybe I will do this though
---
And the protocols
---
Nice!
---
It's happening. Check out the cemetery at flatwoods sometime
---
I actually came up with workaround month ago :
---
1. Switch card in agility that gives 90% reduction weight on consumables
---
2. 1-3 beers in inventory all the time that gives +50 carry weight
---
100% Agreed, although I do think fallout 4 and 76 did power armor much better than 3 and nv, since you actually feel like a walking talk and become gigantic like in the originals
---
I wish we could have a jetpack or backpacl visible. Not both mashing through each other
---
i actually built my own vault under a bridge in the forest
---
They're a good way to find the Tourist, but other than that they are useless. 
---
Last time this was brought up one of the CMs said something to the effect of, "Good idea, I'll pass this along."
---
Derek, is that you? lol
---
I just picked up a spare fireman's helmet. now if I could remember where this would be exciting news BUT I bet I'm not the only one who has so ,,,,,,
---
Me too when it was happening but seriously, what the hell? Dude was just standing on top of the building when I got there waiting for anybody to show up.  Guess I didn't give the right reaction because he left after about 2 straight minutes of shooting missiles through the door at a about a handmades fire rate.
---
Made my game lag like hell but whatever.
---
lately I've been seeking out newbies and offering to help them level. I'll offer a decent legendary for them to use, a few stimpaks and me as a bullet sponge for them. it's hard to find low level players who actually need help, though, often it's mules for high levels.
---
Loadouts only equip/unequip perk cards as a set, won’t move SPECIAL points around right?
---
Maybe that's how much exp you have pooled together in total
---
Derekm carried the game this morning. Yeah, it was him.
---
for what it's worth I'm on PC and never experienced this bug
---
If specific magazines, bobbleheads or locations had assigned names gear you would have to server hop to find one someone did grab already. I'd pile up a certain ones myself.
---
I have 7 AGI and still don’t have enough AP to get more than 3-4 shots off in VATS with my gatling gun. I’m sure minigun has less AP cost per shot but still. Never thought a heavy gun VATS critical build was a thing. Sounds cool af tho
---
They are adding player interior cells to CAMPs at the least, says on the roadmap at least, so hopefully that leads to more opportunities.
---
Ammo efficiency.  If she never lands it takes way more ammo to take her down.
---
No stagger and she will land more often.
---
Well, Vault 63 is just sitting around doing nothing
---
collecting plans. I just always enjoy it, it let's me make my camp look good and always feel nice finding something I didn't have, well that and I just like running around collecting anything
---
Yesterday I logged in at a station when my timer was up that I had fast traveled to earlier which required being during the day (+STR) bloodied unyielding (+STR)  Party Girl Whiskey (+STR) Marsupial (+carry) and pepperoni roll (+carry).
---
I recycled all the 1 and 2 star piece of crap I had and sold 1400 caps of glowing steak, purified water, mirlurk whatever and rad away or stim packs or some other drug.
---
This let me fast travel without whiskey and being daytime!  WOOOOOOOO!
---
Uranium Fever was up... okay, boom, 3 or 4 more legendaries.  All total trash.  Don't even look at 'em anymore until I got to scrap.
---
Okay, time to do a bit of farming oh... Manhunt is up, easy caps, another legendary.
---
Okay, now... oh, Guided Meditation is up, 4 more legendaries.
---
I now can't move without whiskey and daytime again... oh... One Violent Night is up... 3 or 4 more legendaries.
---
Can't fast travel no matter what.  Toss a 3 star on the ground and a couple 1 stars.
---
Decide that I'm done for the day, fast travel to train station for next day, 2 legendaries fighting outside the damn station.  Fine.  Whatever.
---
Log out so full of chocolate, I can't run.  Ready to repeat the next day.  Ridiculous.
---
I use the tax red...was supper excited to get the bright...till i saw how junk it was
---
It was a great surprise that launching two with MFA didn't work. Setting up the MFA was easy; the Google Authenticator made two entries: one called Bethesda.net and one called Bethesda.net(1). No issues there. For gameplay, however, I just disabled MFA for the second account.
---
I guess the solution is to run a VM and use the Bethesda launcher from there, but I haven't tried that and am not sure if 16gb of RAM is enough.
---
ETA: Another solution could be to use Steam for one and the Bethesda launcher for the other. Is it possible to point Steam at the installed game files or do we have to download and install the game all over again?
---
Hell yeah then I could role play as a lady of the night and have a secret spot to bring clients all while holding down a classy camp.
---
yeah, gonna go on the side of not going to be able to.  still stuck on the same sign in screen with no progress.  something is dreadfully wrong in some capacity somewhere lol.
---
&gt;So 5 a day, thats insane
---
most raid teams got 7/ day from the raid, 12 __IF__ you had a team that could do expert.  not really insane for just running your normal daily nowdays
---
&gt;That means will take what, a month and a half to 2 months.
---
it was even more rough with raids, at least this way you just farm your normal scrip,  we had tp do a ton of prep work, find a server that would run smoothe, deal with the various raid bugs, and finish it all under time.
---
current system is way beyond fair especially if you use the probable bug
---
Exactly this
---
leader bobbleheads would be farmed by people server hopping and they'd start charging silly prices for them.
---
I put my CAMP their but it keeps getting nuked
---
It's from the atom store. It's the contemporary housing building set.
---
I just got 2 from Feed the People
---
Leadership, strength, heavy/small guns, energy gun, the magazines with poison resist, damage % resist and such too.
---
Oh snap which dlc was that?
---
It probably felt like a 1 shot but think about it you probably got hit by quite a few bullets. 
---
Try spinning up a minigun and ONLY firing 1 round. It very hard. 
---
Now a B/J FFR minigun with an accelerated barrel could seem like a one shot but you've just been hit by ten/twenty rounds very very quickly.
---
TSE Guass rifle, and TSE Tesla rifle it was when I didn’t understand that they were legacy weapons and sought after
---
Mine is the opposite, even in the day I need pipboy light. At night my character just sleeps because its too dark to do anything.
---
Oh yeah I know, I don't move my special around. The loadouts I'd want all work with my setup
---
Your analogy to prohibition seems spot on, yet most of the player base seems antithetical to this concept
---
Daytime is perfectly fine for me but I agree night never looks like night.  I also want some real weather... It's just a basic cycle, clouds have no real effect.
---
I hear that man! I do need some goal for it all though, especially after this length of time
---
I do love me random looting though
---
When I started playing after the beta , I got a couple of TSE Teslas but since I was using pistols and thought, Im only going to use 1 character( now have 3) sold them like it was candy, now In starting to feel a little tear coming out.
---
I will admit that I have not done the mission for this yet, I have however jumped into the even when I see 5or so people already in it and to be honest I have no idea what is happening except for I shoot at the sheeptron unless it’s invisible...I also jump onto the shed and just unload from my 50 cal
---
Yup, great item. Should be back again at some point.
---
With items like the red asylum uniform, people won't sell for caps. Or at least, not for 30k.
---
Wait 15 minutes for it to land and immediately take off 4 times. After 20 minutes it lands for more than 5 seconds.
---
Run in and kill it with 75 rounds of ultracite 308 from a limb damage LMG just to get this shit over with finally.  If you've been shooting at this thing for 20 minutes and you don't get loot I dont know what to tell you.
---
Are you playing Xbox? Seems to me no matter the game, Xbox has nobody in voice, either no headset or in a party.  Meanwhile every other platform has all kinds of people chatting.
---
I used to like the loneliness of 76, but now I just want people to adventure with.
---
there is an awesome PC mod for that
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
Yeah that honestly makes sense, it’s just the range that it happened to me from made me butthurt tbh lmao. Like that gun is usable at any range against any enemy at any time. GG. lol
---
The weekly Encryptid thread!
---
With the same responses.
---
...So anyway, yeah. I dunno. I get it, everyone's running a friggin bloodied build, but swap your shit up for a minute so we can actually complete this. I don't have enough fedoras.
---
I am now strong enough to put some bullets into the Imposter and have it mean something, but prior to that I would just grab 1-3 pylons and hang around the perimeter where robos don't flood in, stimpack myself every .2 seconds, and hope someone with some badass guns would take Imposter down.
---
It depends you've also got to look at it could of been a lucky shot. I've fought with a Junkies FFR gat Laser it shreds but I'm not very accurate most of the time however I've had a good few lucky shots. Haha
---
I was doing the one violent night event when 2 level 200 something player killed the legendary nightstalker and i couldn't hit it.
---
those lvl 50s should distract the robots while we endgamers finish the sheepsquatch
---
Yeah, well outside the range of the workshop and without becoming wanted. Killed him back a couple of times but got killed way more than id have wanted.
---
I didn't know about the seek revenge option. So selecting means that the pvp was legitimate? For you and any of your team mates.
---
And presumably if a third party then attacks they become wanted. There was an even higher level player lurking nearby who I hoped might decide to join or at least provide a more challenging opponent but that would explain why they didn't get involved.
---
I was until I got that kill your file error code
---
Is there a time limit on revenge?  I forgot I had pacifist off and was swinging away by myself in whitesprings golf club, and a guy ran in, watched me killing them, then quickly stepped in front of the swing. Instant pvp, and I’m dead. Then I took revenge and tracked him stealth for a long time (about 20min)?, then when I though he forgot about me, popped out and ........no damage, as I was the aggressor. He returned fire, and dead again.
---
Its like a 5%or lower chance for most of the good weapon mods
---
I have a bloodied minigun that has 15% faster crit fill. With 10 base agility, with full unyielding armor I have 29. My base damage on the minigun is 155 at this point. Better criticals adds even more in vats. I can use vats for several enemies before having to regen, but with lone wanderer and action boy, it takes a few seconds, and I refill my crit bar every third kill. 
---
I dont use it all the time because I'm pretty squishy doing this, but just when I put my sneak perks back on its brutal, and it conserves ammo when I'm running low.
---
the boss died almost instantly for these types of events, usually its nice if people do one shot in and wait for the rest of the people to join, but you only find people like that in radiation rumble
---
I can't believe I actually have the atoms for that business right now. I'm stoked. Gimme the donuts.
---
I was actually super tempted to pick up the unusable coffee mug that Beth Gear has up for my shelf I never finished. I've spent so much there I had a coupon for $20 off...so, you know. I ended up getting the My Blood's In It tee instead, but that mug is super cute.
---
I think the scrapbox should be in the atom shop for like 2k atoms. Everyone can earn it easily.
---
I've noticed in the last few weeks that sometimes FT to Vault 76 takes you to Vault 96 instead.
---
So we've got unreliable free travel to 2 closed vaults.
---
I still have legendaries to scrap from before Mama was first added
---
Fatsnack destroyed my storage
---
Ngl I read the title before I realized what sub this was on lol
---
First, you can adjust your monitor settings..
---
Second, I remember the dark days, where you could not see much with the pup boy light, and it's not like you get a option for a flashlight torch ECT. 
---
Beth changed it to be brighter at night, cause our in game eyes just don't adjust like reality and even with full brightness settings on, was dark.. 
---
Many newer players don't remember this, simply because it was a huge issue at the start. You could hop servers for fifteen min before you found a day time one, and the adjustment to night length helped quite a bit to allow us to see.
---
Most people don't expect you to have a mic. When passing by players I always give a wave as I pass. It's fun sometimes to chat during events, especially if you start to mesh well with other players. The best time to have a mic is if you're on a team, as it really helps with communication, "hey I've got a legendary over here, come tag it." (Because you only get loot from things you have shot, so if you are on a team and kill a legendary without letting the others get a shot on it, they won't get the legendary loot off it 👍)
---
Honestly though, you joined at the right time because Bethesda should be adding public team matching with the next update. It's supposed to have multiple options for matching up: looting, events, and even role-playing I believe. 
---
Anyway, welcome to the wasteland! Don't die, stay safe, and have fun!
---
I have reached a point up until where I really don't have anything left to do besides the daily quests, and I find it hard to enjoy this repetition.   
---
My main problem is after +220 hours of ingame time is that I really don't want to stop playing FO76, but having spent tons of hours on building new C.A.M.P.S on a shit loads of different locations, trying new challenges with the builds, helping new players etc.   
---
It just gets, well stale. And I am grateful for having played a game where I get so many hours worth of entertainment, but oh boy would I love some more quests added, but that won't be happening until the end of the year at the earliest.   
---
So I was also wondering what kept people playing for so long.
---
Honestly, if we knew how much they be worth I would have kept em but well stash limit those days especially at 400 wasn’t very ndie
---
Every single time I've been there and someone has gotten on mic to say "get off the fence" she has landed more or less the second they got off mic with absolutely nobody moving an inch.
---
I'm generally out in the grass myself.
---
Ok here comes the noob...I have done about 20 queen runs now, still haven’t launched my first nuke so I am kinda riding off the back of others...but why should we not shoot her in the air...and why should we get down off the roofs...I placed my survival tent there and it seams to help get people off the ground to escape the trash mobs she brings in. Not trying to be a jerk or troll...but seriously asking?
---
Who takes time to bury a stranger during a post apocalypse.
---
It’s a known bug.  Just like the Overseers Tapes when the game released. 
---
I’m sure Bethesda will tag it as a non-quest item in a later patch.
---
Yes
---
All but 1, just need to switch some perk cards round. Also, speaking of legendary weapons, how the hell do the legendary modules work? I want a legendary cultist dagger
---
lol
---
Just takes practice keep on flying you'll get it.
---
And the SMMG!
---
Boy was that a struggle, no back packs either,  only way to manage weight was using scavator PArmor.
---
My one PERSONAL issue is, for some reason, all load-in interior cells lag/stutter without fail for me. Whole giant appalachia, not one issue, small trailer load-in cell when you find the lost raider for wasterlanders startup, hell. I don't know why, same level of issue no matter the scale of the interior.
---
Where are my Excavator PA homies at. We have like 2-3 skins for Excav PA and they are just paint Variations and not actual skins
---
Watched the entire thing, and am now questioning what in my life led me to watch the entire thing.
---
This is the high quality shitposting I love in this community. Carry on
---
It did, but the handies forcibly have been keeping it running while dwellers are still inside.
---
Stick to top left part of the map. If enemies are too strong you aren’t supposed to be there yet
---
Did you compare by just looking or actually changing the gun in your hand. This actually makes a difference.
---
I miss the vault power armor paint
---
Itscmillertime.
---
Maybe they could appear for the player only (as in Diablo 3)
---
It’s more a pvp Weapon imo . I would use a ballistic weapon for SBQ
---
Helping lowbies, and camping.  Ilm grab a random lowbie, give up a set of armor and a weapon or 3, then try to party up and work their camp a bit
---
I am a vampire build. 
---
I will shoot my mini and .50s till I'm out of bullets to tank her while y'all run around thumbs downing me. 
---
I heal while shooting. It's fun but crafting and buying ammo takes  time and I'm willing to put in my effort to help those that pay for the cards besides my self. 
---
I shoot her to distract her from you guys. 
---
Can y'all grab the pylons for me ? Ibask because I've tried to do it solo, but with the system lag between the server, my device and the server again, I can not tank three or one pylons and her. 
---
The damage should be negated bit sadly isn't. I even use chems, mags and trouble shooter armor to make sure there is no issue, but the instability of information makes it a bit more challenging.
---
I know right, it's June durrh!
---
On a side note, I have decided to hold on to mine for in case they become needed for the up coming stuff...and if not I’m sure we will be in the area to just turn them in. I hope they bring the BOS back to Defiance and maybe play into the quest line that there was already...maybe give something extra to those who have done it already before the update. I know people say it should all be equal to old players and new players...but it would be nice for them to acknowledge the older players who are still playing
---
Bird bones mutation will help with that as well. Plus better fly time👍
---
Same. I reaaally wish they'd let the vault suit be an outfit you can wear over your armor too :(
---
i hide my camp on the river at the very very edge corner of a map so i can make water and not have it stolen, having all the vaults plus crater and foundation as free travel would help a lot so i dont have to spend so much going allllllll the way across the map
---
It's called Vault-Tec dlc for Fallout 4. Hands down my favorite Bethesda dlc of all time. It's so fun, you get to build a GIANT vault and populate it, it's great.
---
Same
---
I was at one recently where someone was telling all the fence crew to move. Eventually they all did and the queen immediately landed. One shotted the lot of them. I was crying.
---
Getting ganked is not normal or common but it does occur sometimes.  I haven't been ganked at the vault start but I have been at work shops occasionally.  One thing about.work shops is that after you claim them they can be over in by critters at which point other players see it as unowned. If they then claim it, you will be prompted to reclaim it. Someone looking for pvp will use this as an opportunity to strike. Additionally, the temptation can be to respawn for revenge but likely you'll just got stomped again, unless pvp is your jam. Another place ganking can happen is after the scorchbeast queen. I have only seen this once out of a few dozen events. The reward for that event is stable flux which is an ingredient for some endgame things like mutation serums and power armor mods. It's also junk so it is dropped on death once the event is over so a devious player can clean up by killing and looting all the other players after the sbq dies. Especially beware around players with a wanted bounty although that label can be unintentionally picked up by absent mindedly picking a lock inside a workshop owned by another player which I have done a few times.
---
Yep, Rocksy has stopped giving me quests. Between this and the buggy rep reward from Wren I've been stuck watching my rep bar twitch and barely move for a month now ffs.
---
Thanks mate, it melts just about everything. Shame it's not more effective against SBQ
---
Did this rwo days ago with a party of over 8 level 100+ next to me. We failed it
---
That’s an excellent idea maybe Bethesda will put that in a future update maybe.
---
Yes! This would be a great idea
---
No they've always cost money. The lower level you are the less caps you pay (same with moving camp), maybe that is what you're remembering?
---
I crafted and scrapped more gatling plasmas after your confirmation and got it on the 7th one so thank you
---
Jet pack is only worth it if you're willing to run 2 Acrobats legendaries for zero fall damage. It's too much of a headache worrying if you'll die because you went a little to high or missed a jump or something.
---
Not worrying about fall damage and the extra mobility from the jetpack can be a game changer though. It's completely worth the investment in my opinion.
---
First you go to Abbie's bunker and there is a discolored brick in the southeast corner that you need to interact with.  That will bring up a keypad on the northern wall with the passcode 776180 unlocking a hidden terminal in the wall.  You need to pass the hack since the words are random.
---
After that you need to go to Tanagra town and enter the warehouse with the enclave under armor plan slightly east.  Once there you need to find a megasloth and feed him the tape so it isn't in your damn inventory anymore.
---
Pretty sure i was just at your camp. Round build with 2 windmills on top, same GT on ps4 as yohr reddit name?

Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it just isn’t good for the SBQ. She is largely immune to explosive damage, which is what makes those weapons so powerful—because they output a broken amount of explosive damage. They break way too fast to use for that event as well.
---
~~That's not true. You pay less caps to move your camp but fast travel is based on distance.~~
---
Edit: Looks like this was changed patch 11.
---
Its not a fun or well thought out event imo the fps drops to the single digits you get constantly one shot, and odds are you wont get the fixer plan. That and being a conduit is essentially killing yourself and no one wants to do it.
---
On the plus side, this seem a good way to attract players.  I heard what I though was a battle while at brim quarry, traveled almost to the bridge before the nuka factory to find this happening, spent 2k at his shop while there
---
I rocked Ultracite power armor for a looong time, primarily because of the glitch that allowed me to attach the jet pack to my left arm (which I believe they've fixed now) and FWIW I also ran it with the NW Slocum Joe's PA skin. I retired it once I built my T65 armor but now THAT doesn't seem to have any paint jobs (that I've unlocked). Looking forward to Season One tho. Datamining looks like they've got some sweet skins to reward.
---
I loved the glitch where when you log in while wearing the PA it would give 100+ more carry weight which was wonderful on top of the already 100+ from the excavator pa
---
Have you tried logging onto any other game and then 76?
---
It was suggested to me and it worked.
---
Blasted that sucker across the room!
---
Thanks!
---
I think the best thing to do is not compare this game to other fallouts or other similar games.  It's not and never will be for better or worse.  If randomizing bobbleheads makes you travel the map then that's good game design by them in my opinion.  If needing to take sometime to get lining plans or server going that's just the 76 experiance.
---
Bethesda will never make a scrap box with atoms
---
Yea, it still crashes when I try to sign in, I could probably leave it on the press any button to start menu for as long as I want but 30 seconds after I try to sign in it crashes with that error code
---
I just said screw it and deleted it off my external hard drive and I'm gonna redownload it onto a newer external hard drive at my buddy's place who has great internet
---
Or do cushioned ss legs mod
---
Woooooaaaahhhhh so badass!
---
Can I just exile Page and take over foundation?  Turn ward out to pasture as well.  Mabye turn the whole.place into a Old possum brewery?
---
Fast travel is based on distance and level.
---
My suggestion is to make the Grove the new meeting point but the wendigo can spawn there now so that probably will never happen.
---
I like delta but it has roofs so the whole thing starts over again.
---
Cool, thanks man, appreciate it.
---
Should you be able to scrap at a cook station too?
---
Fast travel cost also definitely based on level
---
Maybe a half wall +flag and then flamethrower it down. Place the railing, repair the flag, and see if you can scrap the wall. Probably wont work but worth a shot.
---
I have both as legs cushioned and still take fall damage
---
Exactly
---
So the devs added a max damage cap, but forgot to put a cooldown on it.
---
Typical.
---
Yes remember doing the glitch, also I think i barely had any junk Store and also play overcumber most of the time ,.now I just ditched PA and had to script a lot of unused gear.
---
I agree but honestly it doesn’t make much sense
---
Yeah, good point actually. And it doesn't need to make perfect sense, the multitude of bugs certainly don't.
---
There is a perk that makes it cost less, but it's always cost caps to travel anywhere but your camp
---
And vault 76
---
Seems like they changed it back in patch 11 to make fast travel cheaper for players under level 25 and I just didn't get the memo. After that it's exactly the same as before though. Did some testing and it seems to be 25% the cost for a level 6.
---
Yes.
---
If I can scrap on a power armor station or a chemistry set, I should be able to scrap on anything.
---
Wow, thanks for all the replies. I'll get to going through them all once I'm back home. My niece was just playing on my account and she said people kept walking up and giving her guns and loot. That's just awesome. I'm only level 5 so that saves a ton of time getting a few hand me downs here and there
---
Two pieces of armor with 50% fall damage are great.
---
I wish they'd put in an 'ooops, sorry I shot you by accident' one too.
---
No chance in Hell that Bethesda will move the scrapbox out from behind the FO1st paywall. Having it there gives them enough leverage to keep people paying every month.
---
This would be the dream and steps I would happily take
---
Restores hunger, heals a small amount of health, and gives a miniscule amount of Radiation.
---
As I just found out this is only true up to lv25.
---
I've engaged murdomscalt in negotiations to relocate the SBQ to a standardized location. The fate of our tribes depends upon it.
---
As much as stuff like this would sound nice, it will never work. You can be using the text chat mod and be talking on the mic on PC, and people will still be shooting. I’ve gotten to the point where I just don’t care any more and keep pulling the trigger.
---
PC: I love my Secret Service jet pack. I use Bird Bones and one Secret Service Cushioned leg mod, my other leg has Sleek. I can easily jump off the highest cliff and land softly. You have to time your jets of course and sufficient AP is necessary to supply the required thrust but I've found it to be pretty similar to PA Jet Packs without the earthquake in landing.
---
Art
---
It's ok, we'll spank the raiders into shape with fire and steel...
---
somebody forgot what it's like to be 20 levels under a group of enemies :p
---
There is no scrapping tools at a brewing station.
---
Sounds like my camp. Did you go underground?
---
All the more reason for you to shape up and join...
---
I don’t have the flamethrower to try it I don’t think. Thank you for the suggestion though!
---
Same here buddy lol.
---
*munches on crackers*
---
Id end up part of the Outcasts
---
Sadly I don’t think this will ever happen. Developers won’t shift their time to work on something unnecessary such as this. They’re really focused on the season passes and BoS content.
---
The fact that when the game unexpectedly crashes it doesn’t corrupt 78 hours worth of gameplay. I’m looking at you, Fallout 4. I had 3 days and 8 hours on that. And every single save, except for one of the beginning ones, with only 3 hours hours on it, became corrupted.
---
It's just you.
---
Here's a thought. How about no free fast travel points. It's a survival game. Everything you want to do should take resources that are difficult to get.
---
It also always gives me a chuckle since it's the Fallout universe version of Spam.
---
Your point? There's nothing like that on a chemistry bench or PA station either. Both allow scrapping.
---
Free would be absurd, but I agree it should have at least one more rank; if not two.
---
40-60% would be a more reasonable ceiling, imo.
---
It still needs to cost something.
---
Check summerville houses. There is one with every board game in it or outside on a tavle including unstoppables
---
The Legendary Modules work with the new weapons &amp; armor plans sold out of Vault 94, after completing the new Wastelander storyline. I don’t recall any dagger plans in the inventory but I could have missed it. It takes 2 modules to make a weapon but every thing is a random roll, all legendary effects and whether it’s a 1, 2 or 3 star.  I bought plans for a Gauss pistol that I built and it was pretty cool for a while, but I got bored with it and traded to the purveyor.
---
They don't need to be at crater or foundation. Joinable events at locations around the map. They could literally be anywhere
---
Wow you got me there.
---
It increases the pellets by a single one.
---
Very clunky to play after being introduced with modern fallout but i can see they're great games.
---
It doesn’t restore any of my health or hunger
---
That sucks. );
---
tuck and roll muthafucka!
---
I thought so, but I'm still very disappointed to have you confirm it. I was so excited about it too. Disappointing.
---
The jet pack works fine for me, I use bird bones, nothing else. It's for flying, not jumping off buildings.
---
I spent 5 hours today and countless caps hitting the Sheepsquatch spawns. Find the nest, or the super mutants that got killed by one. I hear Baaaaaaaah! but one NEVER spawned today.  Normally, I would not care. But its the daily challenge that is worth 20 atoms. At this point, I feel I have earned the atoms at the least for all the time i put in... Will I get them? I'll hold my breath...
---
You have herbivore mutation then
---
No lol. Was vendor hoping than a friend needed a hand.
---
This build mode exploit was be used today by a couple of griefers on a public PC adventure mode server. The owner would access build mode once you crossed into the zone and surround visitors with a triangular column of punji boards. No special traps required. Didn't matter what your Pacifist Mode setting was you simply died in seconds. They were taunting their victims naturally.
---
Well with strangler heart you really can't use any atom shop skins without the vines clipping through and looking bad which sucks.
---
Took me a while to check but that’s exactly what happened.
---
You're right, and it's unfortunate that it'll likely never change. But hell even something like a mega atom bundle that's say 20 bucks that includes a stash box that isnt infinite but maybe 200lbs specifically for scrap would be plenty for a lot of people. At least that way when I lose my junk that I have on me, I have a backup so to speak.
---
One pellet adding 25% damage
---
I think train stations is a better idea
---
All I'm saying is, 'believability' went out the window a long time ago, if that's the concern.
---
If I can pull apart a combat shotgun and learn a mod from it using nothing but bunsen burners and beakers, or I can rip screws out of a deskfan using a massive liftframe designed to hold power armor, then I should be able to do the same on a cooktop or brewing stand.
---
If nothing else, it would make all crafting stations consistent, which they aren't currently.
---
[deleted]
---
Legendary and perk times have not changed. 🤦‍♂️
---
I think a legendary perk is in order here.
---
if they would give us all scrapbox, noone would pay the monthly subscription , its just P2W item, thats all
---
I had it for the longest but have been playing without it for a week now and I don't really see the huge convenience factor. There are reasons to have it, atoms, survival tent, scrap box, etc, but to have a good time you don't need it at all.
---
If you're going to be overencumbered anyways, why not carry all of your weapons on you and stash your junk instead? O.o
---
One regen
---
And if you’re on PC, there are reports of people using hacked weapons to melt her
---
Vault-tec Workshop DLC.
---
I used Google Authenticator to setup both of my accounts. When you scan them in, the entries in the Authenticator will have the same name and description (Bethesda.net) so once you scan one in, edit it to provide the unique account name it’s tied to. One thing I didn’t see was an option to produce backup codes in the event you have to wipe your phone. I have to look into that more.
---
I’m on Xbox, I literally had a group of people in PA melt her in 30 seconds
---
Do I detect heresy?
---
This. I only have one piece but use bird bones as well. I call off the highest mountain and I barely get a scratch.
---
Saame, my how things have changed
---
Would be better to make it use ultracite ammo as well.
---
I haven't been able to get them to work on the railing, but I have been able to place them on the porch. Just above the lattice.
---
I hope you guys run out of fusion cores. Our paint jobs are cooler too
---
I wasn’t really getting your point, but you convinced me here. Why not just have the scrapping option on every crafting workbench?
---
Well as long as you don't mind being mediocre with it. Mutations have a lot more benefits than just pvp, but to each their own.
---
Can't run out, we own the power plants 🤣
---
try hopping on top of the display and look down at the helmet. i was able to grab mine off the statue bust (PC)
---
Not fooor long. Meg and the gang bouta run ya shit
---
I think that’s an account locked plan. If it’s bought with gold it usually can’t be traded with other players.
---
Yes!
---
Reach max rep with Raiders. Buy from Mortimer with Bullion
---
You'll need to get max rep with the raiders to be able to unlock the plan for it
---
How much of that is the fault of the bloodied builds and how much of that is the fault of the broken "magic weapons" that melt the queen?
---
The only thing I think that needs tweaking or capping on the Unyielding effect is probably the Int and Charisma stats. I think they should be capped since it sort of nullifies the point of perks like Hard Bargain, and the XP gain at such high INT is sort of insane.
---
Otherwise Unyielding only gives one real benefit for combat: Action Points/Vats. That's useful for people who are built to use VATS, but others don't really use it.
---
The most difficult enemies in game are the SBQ and the Wendigo Colossus. Any build can solo the SBQ if they use a "magic weapon" and by this point pretty much everyone knows about them. It has nothing to do with the Bloodied/Unyielding build. In fact that only real Bloodied weapon option for a "magic" weapon against the queen is a bloodied minigun, since with the barrel mod it can go over 200 ROF and leaves the option to get the triggering "magic" effect on the 2 star part, rather than the first effect.
---
Bloodied Gauss Minigun can solo the queen, but that weapon is stupid broke. Same with the Gauss Shotgun. That's an entirely different convo that needs to happen that the Gauss weapons need tweaking in of themselves.
---
All other enemies are cakewalk. Before I switched to bloodied PA, my defensive perk loadout oriented heavy had no issues with any normal mob in the game. I could mow them down with any old trash legendary gatling laser or gatling plasma and never had any issues staying alive. 
---
I think we've all become skewed on what balance is when we're using the ability to solo the Queen as a metric here. Just my opinion.
---
Plans can't be traded/sold. Can only get it from the Raiders with gold bullion after achieving maximum (I think?) reputation with them.
---
Edit: yea, have to reach "Ally" with the Raiders, which is maximum reputation
---
Mine always glitches out and I fly above the map and fall to my death lol
---
Why would I want to help the melee meta builds kill her before I get enough damage done to earn a reward?
---
those are not hacked weapons just bugged ones (mostly), few specific "heavy guns " are broken few months already, wont name them (u can find them on youtube tho), it can literally delete SBQ health in instant after she lands  
---
 BUT when u try them on private servers, they dont work, its probably connected to server lags (more ppl on the server, more lags)
---
Mark ass comment
---
thank you
---
I collect all the high-end weapons from my legendary runs and sell them off when my avatar's inventory is full. As others have mentioned water, drugs, and food you don't use sell for a good amount of caps and are plentiful. 
---
I've also purchased at least one serum formula plan for each flux type. I try to join every SBQ battle and save the stable flux drops and use them to craft serums. Each serum sells for 400+ caps at the NPC vendors (don't forget to use Hard Bargain  when selling and Super Duper when crafting perks). I also stock these serums in my vending machine until I hit the 30K cap and draw on them at the end of the day if I haven't already hit the daily caps limit.
---
you mean the error code that means i have to spend upwards of two weeks downloading the game files again?
---
blegh.  just got back from taking a bath and no error code, but no successful sign in either.
---
gonna dream of sexy-should-have-secretly-been-a-synth astronauts and try again after work tomorrow.
---
I got three last week.
---
That actually sounds awesome. I'm gonna do it. But I'm going to start with zero gear.
---
Right!
---
I'm not even mad. I'm actually impressed. I laughed way harder at this than I expected to. 
---
Keep up the great work!
---
That's how we did it, just put on some underarmour and set out with 1 stimpack each

[here is my energy weapons junkies rifleman build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3d345ee&amp;d=sb2p00pd2pk2pl2pp2eo2c72i11s12a72s72a03a32an0lr2l12lt2lu2l71)  
---
I recommend going vats crits with rifleman and using marsupial to escape mobs, I went energy because the plasma flamer is the best crowd control weapon for rifleman.  It’s super OP and will burn anything down very quickly
---
People do it for the flux, not your camp.
---
I moved out cause "Camp can't be placed" nearly every session
---
Sorry but these same exact posts are always blowing up, are y’all just farming karma or something?
---
I found a triple star legendary weapon in a beehive during Fasnacht. At first I thought the bees were just really sneaky but now you have me wondering.
---
Sounds like you need to adjust your tv.
---
I've been wanting this for a while now.
---
The goat legs perk card helps. Along with a piece of armor that has reduced full damage.
---
thx a lot :\^)
---
The apocalypse happened twenty six years prior. The bones that are left should be easy to lay to rest now. It kind of makes sense that you'd still find remains out in the wilderness but in the same tent shared by a settler? I don't think so...
---
No. Just thought that it’s a good/unique suggestion. Are you butt hurt or something?
---
As an FO1st member, I don't PvP.  I have a private server if I really wanted to PvP.  And that's with a 2nd account.
---
OP isnt saying he was over encumbered, you can easily play with all of your junk on you under the weight limit with perk cards, but having a bunch of different weapon types is not really that viable.
---
Honestly though, why?
---
No, I’m just asking because there’s hundreds of the same post that have been going on since fallout 76 came out. I don’t mean to disrespect or argue with you.
---
My apologies then :)
---
"This isn't a 'Bethesda shitpost' or an attempt to drive hate or stir up shit within the community, but to get some clarity about the current state of the game..."  
---
"question is though, despite being told we're going to see them repaired and they're "looking into a fix", what are the Dev's actually doing up there at Bethesda? Because they sure as fuck aren't looking into fixing bugs. Unless they're very incompetent and it actually takes an age to fix these bugs, there's been bugs that have been pointed out and have received response from the Dev's as being said to have been 'looked into'."
---
  
---
At that line it went from not being a bethesda shitpost to being a bethesda shitpost. Enjoy your bot upvotes and karma farm I guess. Too bad to because the TLDR was actually respectful.
---
Fallout 1*
---
Yeah i wondered why not myself.
---
It is 750 bullion I believe and becomes buyable from the raiders with max rep. Mortimer sells it once you hit max rep. it will make every ammo type except 2mm, missiles and mini nukes.
---
Oh damn, I sided with the settlers and I got super low rep with the raiders, nvm I guess...
---
Maybe he keeps it there for recreation
---
Because if we get everything we want for free, we'll bitch even more about having to work for something
---
You know every once in awhile i scroll past a fo76 post not seeing its a fo76 post and wonder to myself "wait what the fuck?"
---
You have a good point.
---
Yes that's the one lol good luck
---
From a visual stand point grenadier does not but this is the first time i am using grenadier so idk if it is just hit box increase and visuals stay the same
---
I don't see a problem with this. That'd be fun.
---
Yes I’m on xbox, I just hit level 100 and I’ve only talked to maybe 2 people ever.
---
This game really hinders new players no wonder the population dies, can't believe devs would design a game like this and not expect customers to leave.. I know its being fixed but it should have been years ago.
---
I think they said something about persistent camps at some point
---
Laser and plasma weapons are also pretty sad. I compared an AA 1* combat rifle to my AA3* ultracite laser rifle and the combat rifle outperformed it at every single fight.
---
It’ll probably be added on Tuesday again.
---
No problem. And you don't have to buy anything! Just focus on making your experience fun
---
honestly, i feel like fo76 is a lost cause. i paid for the game. i paid for fo1st. im lvl 140~. i gave the game a fair shot. i am a diehard FO fan, so i will admit i was slow to finally give fo76 a chance. but i did (it took me awhile to try fo4 tbh). the game is stark barren for an mmorpg. no procedurally generated endgame. little post game content. the building mechanic is not only more limited in scope from fo4, but just not as fluid, anything outside of a basic box and CAMP just fights you the whole way. the game is made from the slashed up remnants of the Creative engine used in fo4, an engine mechanically based in solo play, hence all these weird glitches. the economy is shit because honestly, there isnt much to buy, especially by endgame. the enemies and weapons are just all over the place. explosive weapons are literally hit or miss. enemies dont scale and the tick rate makes combat a gamble (ever been hitting your stimpax hk and them shits just aint healing?) i am in an endgame state, but what i got? dropping a nuke? most of the events are a chore at my level. i can get dem gold bars but what am i going to buy? armor, weapons? to fight what? jesus, the (supposed) baddest big bad is a FLYING enemy, the most annoying type in video games. which is especially weird as flying enemies are hella rare post fo3. its fun with friends, but me and my friends can be fun no matter the game. i really *dont* want to hate this game, but its asking for so much but offering so little. for context, i came from Warframe before getting into fo76. the whiplash was severe. i played Warframe for a straight year and always felt like their was so much to do. before that, Division2. just when you thought you beat the story, some harder mafks come rolling in. then theres fo76, where im literally roaming the map looking for missions, quests, treasure hunt, something! im sorry for the rant yall, but these constant threads about fo76... we just need to let it go, stop rewarding Bethesda for releasing a crude incomplete game and then actually continuing to give them money. fo76 is not a good game. the premise keeps us going, but the game is bad. just old yeller this fn game.
---
That sounds great until all your quests tell you to go into those high levels lol
---
I had toyed with going energy but I acquired the grounded mutation :-/.   What kind of armor do you use if any.  I see videos with people only using the Chinese Stealth armor
---
I love this so much, I have 2 pieces of -50% fall damage and I can run and jump off absolutely anything without losing any health, jetpack perks or armour mods not required
---
Would anyone be willing to build it in my camp ? I'll pay good caps ?
---
Congratulations... You and they are why the games dying and can't get new customers.
---
Would anyone be willing to build it in my camp ? I'll pay good caps
---
In my experience, it absolutely does. I've gently landed from the highest of heights by thrusting right before landing. Granted, I have Bird Bones, but those falls/jumps would have killed me outright before. Now? Zero damage.
---
I’m not sure that’s possible either. Otherwise I’d be seeing a lot more around.
---
I have my small collection of Fasnacht masks on display. I got about 20 jester and sun masks during the event, so I'm missing quite a few. Came back to camp the other day to find that someone dropped a soldier and witch mask in my doorway. Probably one of the nicest things I've experienced in an online game.
---
Events suck for lv 100+ players as well.. The events just suck, also the damage on builds is just too damn high.. The whole game needs an overhaul, damage, enemies, mechanics you name it it needs it..
---
She's overseeing your performance as a field agent. We still representing vault tech while rebuilding west Virginia
---
I dont have it unlocked yet, bur im sure someone would take up that offer, possibly on a trade sub
---
People really need to learn that staying off of fences,tents, and buildings is far more important. People need to remove stagger when shooting her, but she does need to be shot in the air to keep agro. If you don't shoot her in the air at least a bit she can shift agro to a random mob near her pit and has a chance to reset and refill her health. 
---
And for those asking ; if the queen cant find a entity to agro at ground level ( aka not on an elevated surface) it confuses her and she will not land.
---
All locations should immediately be available to fast travel to. Characters should start out with all weapons and outfits. Any hit should be an insta kill. The physical CD should be warm velvet and cuddle me to sleep at night. This game should make my parents get back together and initiate peace in the Middle East. This game should read the player's mind and create a customized perfect gaming experience for each individual. This game should replace our current gods, and craft new realities and if so necessary, replace all life as we know it. Fallout76 should be the last thing the universe experiences before all implodes in a great crush of atoms and quarks. Fallout76 should dissolve the boundaries between heaven and hell, revealing only a vast unimaginable emptiness.
---
Actually, yes, I believe it was. I was in that area exploring and was attacked by ghouls. They always have chems on them. Ha
---
Someone else put a jackolantern shorts suit in their vendor for 0 caps 😁😁😁 mine now
---
You can build it at only your own camp. Better start hunting down all them vacuum tubes are former raiders if you want it.
---
I don't run those perks, and don't have any fall damage armor, and I've always soft landed with the jet pack, no matter the distance of the fall/jump.
---
I do have Bird Bones though. Before jetpack, even with Bird Bones I sometimes killed myself with a huge fall. But with jetpack, I can thrust and soft land absolutely everything, taking zero damage, not even an 'Oopf' sound effect.
---
You have to have some upwards movement to avoid full fall damage. Either initially, or at some point in the descent, you need to use enough AP to get a slight upward lift. Then you can use it to slow enough to avoid damage.
---
I have a ss jetpack that came with 50% fall damage reduction, that means I didn't need two arms or legs. So I was finally able to swap out my marine armor left arm for my scout armor 3-star with reduction ammo weight, and whew, it's awesome.
---
Bird Bones + Jetpack will allow you to gently land any fall.
---
Depends on what you want. If you are interested primarily in stuff you can buy from vault 79 (mostly the armor), keep it as it will shorten the gold grind. 
---
If you are primarily interested in the gauss shotgun or minigun, split it.
---
Its this game in a nut shell and why the game is on life support.. Why they added it to steam.. Its not getting better sadly.
---
And people here say the populations are so nice...
---
Those scorched are asking for it. The muties, too. I'm the fucking deputy. 
---
Recognize.
---
Totally agree. Medic Pump is perfect for this and the Born Survivor perk.
---
Shouldn't have to P2W anyway.. we paid for the game already.
---
This could really improve the community. Having a market of sorts and allow a larger amount of people to be in the vault at a time for more interaction
---
Can we address the fact he was a guest and let you die?? I viciously DEFEND people's camps when they're attacked while I'm shopping. It's the right thing to do.
---
The reason why we can't go back to vault 76 because the life-support systems for the vault were supposed to shut down after 25ish years after the bombs dropped. That's vault tech for ya.
---
I ll buy it for 1 caps, lol, wow feel Sorry for that person, but once I found a forest camo suit por 50 caps in vendor .
---
I don’t even go stealth most of the time.  I have and love the stealth suit but it’s honestly Boring after a while because everything dies without engaging you.  It’s fun at first but I like a little more fight, it’s cool to clear out west tek and never take a bullet but it gets boring being crouched and never fighting.
---
I’ll generally kneel down with the gauss rifle to clear an area until I get noticed and then I switch to plasma flamer/Tesla.  I was using full vanguards sentinel combat but once SS came out I just focused on the sentinels because you don’t need vanguards with DR that high.  I like my secret service armor very much, and it’s great having mixed pieces like poison res and fall damage etc.
---
No only if your wearing a skirt
---
I'd prefer a social tool that all mmos have called a text chat...
---
I only need one fixer plan. LOL. Just one. When that plan drops I will be so excited.
---
We've been begging for this 4 ages, it seems they cant control their own engine cause some claim even daylight is too dark but most of us cant tell the difference between night and day.
---
i just gamble with serendipity lmao
---
Constantly :(
---
Dark nights mod from fo4. Scary because you only see via pip boy light.  More jump scare situations.  Night on 76 is lame.  No surprise
---
More like 4 to 5k dmg per shot
---
You keep your "conduit" status even when you get downed(not dead), right?
---
It's always been broke. Since day 1
---
I find my explosive pipe rifle is extremely effective.
---
... And that's all we have time for this week on "Appalachian Hoarders", be sure to tune in next week when we catch up with _n00bp3wn3r_ in the cranberry bog as he tells us about his addiction to carrying hundreds of cooked meals that will all inevitably spoil.
---
On a serious note, the weapon weight or ammo perks may suit you better if you find yourself needing to carry additional weight on your character... Also consider making a bank alt character called Lydia to "carry your burdens" until you can free up some space.
---
I'm on PS4... if you ever need a hand transferring, I'd be happy to help!
---
Heavy weapons with ‘magic legendary effects’ then
---
Angry turtle had a vid if I recall correctly
---
I don't even care if it's functional, I want a cosmetic fridge...

&gt;at fort d
---
I think I got this process down pat.  I made a character on my friends account that I group with and afk at defiance.  That characters base is right next to the fissure and my survival tent is next to VTU.  If you don't loot the scorchbeast you can keep using that body to get the DNA over and over.  Just keep fast traveling for free to all these places while watching some tv in the background and it isn't that bad.
---
You keep it even when you’re dead. At least for a little bit
---
Honestly! I feel like it's common courtesy at this point
---
Night is basically pitch black in some areas for me. Stumbling around enough already, please don't make it darker.
---
She glitched out for me. I finished the quest that involves gold and gave her back her holotapes. I haven't seen her since.
---
I’d say as a solo player for my 1600 hrs that you can keep to yourself OR find people to stick with, reddits perfect fir matchmaking I’m sure! Don’t pay over 2k caps for anything until youre near the endgame, and basically dump all your junk scrap into the stash box ASAP when you’re on a claimed workshop, they can claim it from across the map(boundaries if workshop*) and if you die they’ll prolly grab the loot too. 
---
Don’t expect to run up to any random player and get a bunch of free stuff, but you can honestly be there at the right place or time when somebodys unloading plans or ammo on somebody a fraction of theur level. Adds a nice meta kevel to random encounters. 
---
If you want higher level unique weapons(aka mission rewards) try to grind up to 45/50 before taking on major questlines. I’ve done this on my two newer characters, each is still about 6 months to a year old right now but yeah i have two whole character slots basically ready to collect all of those weapons and armor at a top level! I’m unsure of if say, you’ll get more stimpacks or other aid/loot rewards but the weapons &amp; armor def level to your character!
---
I haven’t even done this yet but get the Possum Scout badges ASAP(8 of em) you can have like an extra 120 or maybe 150 idk on carry weight with the high capacity mod.
---
Good Ore to mine is Copper and Uranium, then Aluminum, and once you can run thru the Miner Miracles mission to get Excavator armor, Lucky Hole Mine can be yielded up to 400 lead ore and a decent amount of crystal as well(with excavator mining bonus) Otherwise, Hemlock Holes is the spot to get Acid, if you set up camp on the Acid deposit outside of the clubhouse(not in the workshop but like 200-500 paces West) you can yiekd an additional 10 acid per hour, on top of 30 per hour at H.H. Iron Ore and Lead ore smelt for the biggest yield, 1 acid-2ore=5 scrap(currently there’s no way to add to that aside from SUPER DUPER(Luck) which lets you rabdomly generate duplicates. So that and making sure you have a lot of cloth to craft gunpowder(Collision Course Event usually drops 100 prewar money=100 cloth) you can have a goid stash of lead, but if you’re not investing in Fallout 1st for the unlimited junk scrap box, be sure to collect acid often(yao gaui and cave crickets drop about 5 a piece almost guaranteed) and smelt if you’re going to be big on collecting ore, if not just farming ammo- the Ammo Factory Workshop is nice but highly contentious and the current output isn’t worth getting there all that often these days so i just farm lucky hole. 
---
Perk Tips; just make sure to spec into the weaponline you want, like gunslinger for pistols, slugger for melee, iron fist for unarmed, etc. Also realize that if you want to hack or pick thru expert level locks you have to have a total of 6 perks invested if you’re unlucky with perk card packs. I’ve had like ten characters at this point, after playing thru the first 20 levels that many times and having accrued a total of like 750 levels overall i’d say that its like a 1 in 8 chance to get a ‘hacker’ or ‘picklock’ card, so early on it may be wise to fill thise in the second you see them, definitely helps with missions! Starched Genes comes thru at level 30, any mutations before this get washed away with radaway, so until you get this perk card, only stock up on any cheap muration serums you find, then when youre level 30, pop the serums, THEN put the perk on, if you starch your genes before you mutate, then you wasted the serum. Class Freak+Starched Genes+switching out Bloody Mess abd Super Duper is a decent Luck list for anybody that wants to focus on other elements of the build, but you can always change it up, once they give us perk loadouts im sure many guides will pop up on top of whatevers already out there but yeah there’s some basics. 
---
Also for pre-smelting, lead can be obtained in bulk at weight rooms located at the Lodge outside of flatwoods, the charleston fire department, &amp; vtu! at least 80 scrap per room! &amp; super mutants drop caps/gunpowder often!
---
Isn't there already an emote for that? I swear I've seen people use it in nuclear winter.
---
I wanna upvote this 20000 more times.  I use this set to make an okish looking postwar kitchen, and I've yet to ever have upper cabinets.  Forced to fill my kitchen walls with eat-o-tronics and vault-tec posters.
---
You can still get it. Just keep on doing the dailies for the raiders and you can stil reach ally with them, thus giving access to these plans.
---
Wrong sub, find a marketplace. Or a tin cup, beggar.
---
because fuck the servers
---
Be nice if these ideas were ever looked at by bethesda.
---
I have both medic pump and born survivor, I barely ever die even if I’m trying bloodied weapons
---
Been that way since beta. I don't think they'll ever fix it.
---
Yeah it should be -13%, I take this stat is persisting across different servers?  
---
all other mutations normal too?
---
I'm going to build a springboard trap and attempt a couple of flights. My camp is on a mountain peak over looking Watoga and the fissure prime. Might be a bit of fun.
---
I got a shotgun called Civil Unrest yesterday after completing 'Falsely Accused'. It's a random encounter triggered quest near the penitentiary. Pump action shotgun with +10AP built in.
---
Not 100% sure, but I don't think that works with the ammo fabricator.
---
If I had it, I'd try for you, but I don't have it either
---
There's no doubt it's not just one thing. Combat overall is unbalanced. Magic weapons are a part of it, sure. 
---
However, as I mentioned I main a bloody build so I know first hand how overpowered they are. Anyone who mains a bloodied also knows too. Unlike people like me, they're not honest about how OP the overall build is and don't want to give up that power, even in the name of game balance.
---
In that comment you were responding to, I wasn't even referring to the SBQ or ISS. It was stuff like MLQ, regular SB, behemoths and stuff like that. They're not scary, powerful monsters that are some challenge, they're a trivial obstacle to get past for XP or legendaries.
---
&gt; The only thing I think that needs tweaking or capping on the Unyielding effect is probably the Int and Charisma stats. 
---
See! It's exactly these BS half-measures I was talking about. A loss of an xp boost and sale price aren't meaningful but why should only the non-combat bonuses be singled out? ALL of it is broken. 
---
No one should have a better carry weight bonus on each piece of armour that's better than deep pockets; that overall is better than an unmodded backpack. Same too with nullifying the need for 3 ranks of the sneak perk, crazy boost to AP, etc. etc.
---
ALL of it should be nerfed, not just the things that are convenient to be nerfed.
---
However, as I mentioned, it's not just bloodied. It's a combination of things but even balance those out, bloodied is still OP and needs nerfing.
---
Don't get me wrong, I've had WAY more enjoyable encounters with people at my camp, other people's camps, and public events. The people in this game are the reason I keep playing, just genuine people having a great time sharing experiences and game knowledge with one another. However when something like this happens, it really just catches you off guard, and I lose my will to play for a while. This is my second time having this happen in my 400 odd hours of playtime, and while it sucks, I'm not going to lose a night of sleep over it. The community is what keeps bringing me back ultimately.
---
You can’t put it in people’s camps for them.  Just the same with not trading plans or the weapons for the wastelanders update.
---
That sounds like fun, what are you playing on?
---
I just need to pray to Todd next time, lol
---
XB1. You?
---
&gt;People do it for the flux, not your camp.
---
&gt;
---
Erm no. Every time I see their camp there, it's nuking time.
---
The wallpaper choice just sets me off.
---
Keep the gold you lose some rep but the gold is worth it overall
---
It keeps track of players who have been on your last server or two, there is no way to know who dropped loot unless you see them doing it and check their name then and there.
---
I may have gotten that lol.....was it the one that had mostly psycho and mentats?
---
Hahaha I hear that ... nothing quite like the anxiety of wondering if the main quest is going to bug out!
---
I'm not too worried about stuff like that, although it absolutely is a legit game loop to dive into
---
You get screwed if you don't keep it and after the mission everyone just forgets anyway.
---
Probably. I always seem to have a lot of psycho and mentats. And rad away. I could not understand why I was so over encumbered until I saw that I had 40 rad away on me. Ha.
---
What's stacking damage?
---
Actually i lost half a bar of rep when i kept mine.. but it was still worth it over the gold collection insanity.
---
AC isn't really offering anything, its just his way of saying you can give him bullion for plans, same as the vendors that will become available for you once you complete the raid.   
---
If you're asking about the choice you have to make in regards to screwing over whichever faction you did the raid with, check out the "Gaining Reputation" section of  [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zTLDp5d4hNtsWkZnUKw8Ek-EYogqbaJ7UdAc7i5kIuw/edit#gid=0) document to get an idea of how much rep you will gain or lose.
---
Mr. Prize Bot would say “Congggrrrraaaaaaattttttttuuuulllllaaaaatttttiiiioooonnnnnnsssss!!!”
---
It's easier to get the rep back than gold and there are no repercussions other than the temporary setback of rep.
---
100% keep the gold. Any other choice just makes your life harder.
---
Awesome idea - we need a questline/event chain to restore the railway network in Appalachia! 
---
Considering the scope of such an undertaking it could be a great way to introduce more collaborative/community projects to the game. 
---
Most of all, it would be an amazing way for players to make a real impact on the world (as well as having real agency within it) - both from a gameplay perspective (making fast travel much easier, perhaps pooling connected train vendors stock together and/or providing greater quality and/or quantity available from a vendor, or just make vendor prices cheaper thanks to more easily available supply?) and on a narrative basis (restoring the local logical network being a major step towards restoring civilisation and improving everyone's standards of living).
---
Players would still pay for tickets but the price to distance ratio would be much better (balanced by limiting train fast-travel to only being between train stations). 
---
Perhaps if a player is over-encumbered they can still fast travel via train but have to pay extra for the "luggage" (weight over carrying limit) they are taking with them? 
---
I'm not sure how viable it would be, but I'm imagining the state of the railroads could be server-specific, persistent and dynamic; players have to work together to rebuild the railroad, protect it from attack/sabotage OR join raiders holding up and robbing trains (maybe not fast travel trains to prevent griefing - but that also could be a great PvP opportunity; perhaps cheaper fares for "risker" train rides - i.e. open to player attack?). 
---
This both generates PvE, crafting and PvP content and doesn't invalidate the original fast travel system: as the ease of fast travel via the railroads can improve or degrade based on player action (or inaction) - on top of railway fast travel being limited to railway stations, non-train fast travel would still be viable, even optimal at times.
---
You could even create and customise your own personal carriage to use during the loading times! A team can collectively fast travel (with discount for travelling together, maybe?) in the team leader's carriage, for instance.
---
Personal carriages coulda also serve as a passive income flow - the railway uses your carriage when you aren't and therefore pays you a portion of the revenue made using your carriage; you could specialise your carriage for transport cargo or people, upgrading its luxuries and/or equipment to transport 1st/2nd class passengers (eg a bar, robot butler) or more difficult to handle goods/materials (eg lead-lined walls for radioactive material, specialised storage for computer components) thus earning a higher income!
---
Ouch! Yeah corruption sucks. I've been lucky and only lost a save in one game (at least in the last decade that I can remember)
---
Keep shopping around player vendors. I see them every now and then.
---
Parachute landing fall, my friend.  Gotta PLF.
---
I'm sorry to say but i haven't people search my shops then shoot up my home.. drag enemies in as you have encountered.. Just scum on Oceanic servers, many can't even speak english.
---
It'll probably come back at some stage. All of the items do eventually.
---
For free?
---
Heck yeah! Heard some commotion the other day, up by my neighbor's CAMP, so I hoofed it over and killed the glowing Radstag that was pummeling their ally NPC.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Scrub.
---
Pretty sure they removed it because of the uproar of it being an item that stopped food items from spoiling and people were super pissed that you had to pay for it from the atom store rather than it being an in-game plan you could find.
---
Don't quote me on this however
---
The only thing that makes it too bright during the day for me is when it's misty. But I suppose that's like real life. Otherwise it's fine.
---
I agree re. darkness at night though. I don't know why it was ever changed tbh. Walking around in the Mire at night is how I'd love all areas to be in terms of darkness at night.. just to make the void that little bit more threatening.
---
Exactly my point.
---
Great advice thanks.
---
Oh yes. Like raids where you have to defend foundation or crater from an incoming attack
---
That’s actually being added in Winter. Or something like that.
---
I don’t think so. There have been several updates to the fridge since that original one. They’re embracing it.
---
I know it doesn't exactly fit with the logic behind weight reduction perk cards, but I wished they applied to stuff in your stash.
---
I see, thank you. I'll need to pay better attention then. Thanks!
---
Damn... I remember the OG one that came out that got people extremely riled up about. Maybe they'll bring it back one day. Who knows
---
A bloodied weapon is important but you can still do decent damage with a bloodied build without the weapon.
---
Also, finding bloodied weapons in player vendors isn't that difficult. You should be able to find a basic one at a reasonable price eventually.
---
Well, shoot. Then those knuckleheads at the event I was at last night had no excuse to not take that sucker down while I was on one knee for 30 seconds with all 3 pylons. I think there were about 8 other people.
---
I thank you for reminding me it's smiley day.
---
Bows kinda worked better in Skyrim. 3rd person view looked better and arrows stuck in targets rather easily.
---
been a while since I last played, but iirc both the pipe revolver and pipe bolt action benefit from both rifle and pistol damage perks if you have a stock attached
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one who shoots her while she is cloaked. I run a Vamp gat laser, and I'm happy to fire continuously and draw the aggro (and stay healed).
---
In a game where junk and scrap are essential, a scrap box locked behind a paywall is just plain wrong!
---
I had the BOS jumpsuit with the bomber jacket.  I have no idea where it went honestly.  Just one day I couldn't find it anymore after wearing something else for a bit.
---
It’s been back! Many times. The last new ones I saw were a Nuka Cola one and a small wooden one both a month or two ago. Don’t worry, some form of the fridge will be back in a week or two.
---
I've been playing since the beta and never has this game been so dark that you can't see. The only time I've ever needed to turn my Pip-Boy light on was deep inside some of the mines. I've literally never not had perfect vision at nighttime.
---
Yeah the others are correct. I jumped sergers once and didn’t change. Weird.
---
2 poison resist pieces of armour and you’re good.
---
You’re right in that there should be other ways to get poison resistance but the armour is currently the only option
---
Now that sucks even more,.since you know you had it but cant find it anymore, happen to me , but than realize it was on another character,  felt like a super noob.
---
QE handmade, JE railway, and a whole assassin's sentinel set I was transferring to myself on a private server
---
The ice box is technically considered a fridge if that's what ya mean by the wooden one, and I remember a lot of people got misled by the nuka cola one thinking it would 'chill' their nuka colas and thus people were screaming for a refund
---
Then you had better settings on your monitor , on Xbox one with my 35 inch TV, before I upgraded to a better tv, it was horrible .
---
I'm glad you didn't have the same sight issues that many of us had however, and I hope you continue to enjoy the game
---
Oh, crap. I didn't know it was rare and sold mine at my shop for 10 caps. -_-  I made some player very happy. Ha
---
Don't forget to mention continued updates to the atomic shop...
---
Ahh I would take you up on it, however I'm on PC unfortunately. But yes, it might be time to create an alt character!
---
Scrap the wire between your vendors and the generator
---
Go buy a serum recipe.
---
just scrap the power connection
---
All PA needs love. I only use the excavator PA with calibrated shocks for the increased weight. I  have a x01 with calibrated shocks, but even then it doesn't come close to my over 400+ weight.
---
I've never played with anyone that's couldn't see at night, I would say either you played with the glare on your monitor from the actual sun or lighting indoors or you had your monitor brightness turned way down. I've actually tried turning down my brightness in game to give the illusion of actual nighttime but the only way to make it look dark made my Pip-Boy almost completely black. Which is why I keep my TV at standard brightness but even still the god rays are overpoweringly bright and nighttime looks like nine in the afternoon at best.
---
Yep, it’s a thing. Server lag, I’m told.
---
&gt;OP isnt saying he was over encumbered, you can easily play with all of your junk on you under the weight limit with perk cards, but having a bunch of different weapon types is not really that viable.
---
Considering junk is *the only* thing you drop on death it's the last thing I'd carry on me if I was low on stash space.
---
I was doing some of her quests (which is considered Main Quest Line) and its just so ridicilous...man...I hated it so bad, so I returned to doing side quests that are more interesting and somewhat close to what Fallout Quests used to be like. Solving murder mysteries and doings pioneer boy scout quests was far more interesting than this... \*cough\* \*cough\* to my surprise Wayward and Overseer came out as one DLC (correct me if I am wrong), but I had a lot more fun doing Wayward missions and felt somewhat attached to the plot line...I even felt bad when they killed Crane...And I just sat there for 5 minutes, kinda depressed.
---
Its kinda under rated as builds go, and between the gauss mini , regular mini faster fire rate, prime omg, and explosive 50 all vamp weapons, I don't get why so many people write it off. 
---
Vanguard's armor, two 50% fall damage parts, ammo and weapon weight reductions, and plus strength is a awesome build for pve type play. 
---
I loathe pvp in the current game, but love going toe to toe with about anything and walking away full health and some times a bit of rads
---
I've somehow gotten a bug where I perpetually have the thing Ward wants, I never have to retrieve it and it gives me scrip twice. On the other hand Rocksys raider quest hasn't popped for a few days.

I need that card. I bought the marsupial serum from a vendor and went straight to another vendor after drinking it. That vendor had a radiation thing that cures rads hidden and it went off as I enter. Cured me of my mutation. I had it all of one fast travel. Ha. I'm level 70 and I haven't received that card yet. Does it appear at a certain level or just randomly?
---
Oh, ok. It's so weird.
---
Thank you :) I guess i will be using my laptop along side my tabletop. Or just ignore the MFA on my mule account.
---
Ok, I can let some glitches past like when I fight the scorched queen and try to loot her and get nothing , but transfer own items on private server its just to much.
---
Thx for the answer :)
---
cut off the power
---
It’s the moon that’s too bright, add in half moons and nights without moonlight, it would make night appropriately scary!
---
Yeah I'm a big trader on PS4 so it hurt, I was still able to get my AAE Gatling plasma without it but it took a lot longer for sure. I'd done it so many times before without issue too.
---
I'm sure you could find someone that you can trust
---
And you use your railway rifle to fix tracks. And now you have a backstory for why the weapon exists for lore, it was used on the railroad by an inventor/train engineer
---
Ah I'm PS4...
---
At lvl 50 you have access to all the perks. It's a 2 star perk card under luck. Rank 1 makes you less likely to lose your mutation and rank 2 makes it permanent until you unequip the perk card
---
Sometimes daylight is near unplayable
---
Thank you so much! I'll keep that in mind next time I level up!
---
I don't know if they're lighting works directly off of moonlight or not, but I feel like the ambient light in the world itself is just too bright. I'm okay with getting blinded every now and then by a ray of sunlight and having really nice bright days but I would like for that to be contrasted with dark nights or at least incrementally darker nights with an actual moon cycle that could affect brightness
---
Can we add the backwoods camper and the fact the walls no longer support pictures or decor and simply SINK into it. I miss that too... It looks shit without the walls being solid enough for pictures and plaques.
---
Why the duck does Reddit’s weeb mafia have such a hard on for fast travel cost? It’s not worth a quarter of a moment of a single persons time over at Bethesda. If you can’t afford your fast travel costs I’m surprised you managed to navigate a keyboard... shits perfectly fine. I don’t care if they did nothing except 5x the cost. Wouldn’t matter at all compared to non-functional game systems. Get back in the basement.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
In what way does it barely resemble the original designs? They're not 100% the same, but they seem pretty darn close.
---
Genuinely curious, which aspects of the ultracite do you feel better reflect the original T-51b design?
---
Items rotate in an out, in sure it will be back
---
I have the stainless steel one mixed with the red rocket counters/red cleaned stove
---
Who the hell plays pubs anymore.
---
And then when you finally get the Fixer plans you'll go months without even getting a legendary one.
---
I personally recommend building them in a enclosure. People can still purchase items from your vendors power or bo power.
---
What they should really bring back is paint ball guns
---
I have this one pretty often. The worst one version happened when I was at the Whitesprings golfclub. When I died, the game "respawned" me outside the building as it does but I couldn't move or do anything except open up my map/camera mode. Camera mode showed that I was alive but even with my map open, it didn't get the option to fast travel but to specifically "respawn". Issue was, I was overweight so the game wouldn't let me.(I really didn't want to leave that world since I had just killed a legendary too lol)
---
What platform are you on? I’m asking because I’m on Xbox and run the prototype skin.
---
First of all, make those workshops teleportable.
---
I like her, but today I died while she was following me and that bitch just stood there while I bled out.
---
im level 235 with a junkie commando build. when doing events with groups, i use a level  40 junkies 10 mm submachine gun. It doesn't melt things like my other weapons. I do that to make sure everyone gets y chance o hit the boss.
---
That’s dumb. I absolutely DETEST PvP in this game, but you should know the risks of having junk on you. Either stash it or risk it being taken.
---
pretty easy event with the right build, people just dont know how to do that.
---
Tech data can also spawn in any of those round filing cabinets you find. Sugar grove is usually good for 1-3.
---
Do what u really want to do, pistols aren’t really all that powerful, so keep that in mind, I love myself a good junkie shotgun build, makes the one shot kills really satisfying
---
The whole thing
---
I use goat legs
---
Whatcha talkin bout Willis?
---
ouch
---
If we do get bunkers I'm inclined to think something along the lines to that of free states bunkers. Where you can expand by building rooms up to so many rooms.
---
trickle that shit down yo
---
You can get the helmet from the same location
---
Sorry but if you do the mission siding with crater then the settler quests are disabled
---
Not going to get fixed.
---
It is, but it’s not that common. I say this a few hours after appearing at Fred’s Shack and suddenly watching the foxes keel over with no other players in sight.
---
Lmao, my main has been running around with at leaat 250 rad away and stims all diluted with around 150 of each non diluted, i cannot live with traveling pharmacy
---
I see what you mean, because idk about you but for a 62 lvl ghoul in an area where I just need to check a terminal is kinda wack
---
Sorry bud. You're locked out for that character.
---
Was that "someone" you by any chance...?
---
yeah I honestly think that 4 Games could pull off a better 76 than Bethesda
---
This is one of the nicer subreddits I'm a part of, but people don't just typically give out Bloodied weapons. They're either sold/traded, or scripped due to their weight. Best bet is keep on that grind, as that is what 76 is all about.
---
Sadly I wish it could be explained like you stated, but no monitor, no glare. 
---
Xbox 1 and a tv. 
---
I'm sure things in the PC version were better then on the console however, my experience was as stated and the update to the lighting should show that I was not the only person with this issue.
---
I did try maxing out my settings but it didn't help enough. To the point that I can recall howuch I hated night time.
---
The night eyes perk did help but had to be crouched and that's annoying. I'm glad the world was made brighter for us console users
---
Yeah it flags for sure. Killed him right after his explosive bait blew up (he did not throw it at me, but a piece of furniture). All I did was stand on his explosive bait. Perhaps this + what VoltaiqMozaiq said explains it. Likely an easy fix on Bethesda's part.
---
Some guy was nice enough to give me a Bloodied 50cal but I’m looking for a bloodied Gatling gun
---
Yes. Scorchbeasts especially. I lost a number of 2~3 stars
---
For what it’s worth, you’re really not missing anything down there. It’s just one big room staged specifically for a meeting with Mother Lode. A few things to loot, a bed... you’ll survive without it.
---
Man thats awful. Idk why the skin doesn't just get scrapped and the weapon allowed to drop normally.
---
If you don't want to go through much work, turn off your vendors and lock them.
---
Bet nothing special then
---
Nothing special at all.
---
&gt; It's a survival game
---
Not really.
---
Yeah I hear you and that’s what I think, do what I really feel like doing. I’m just having a hell of a hard time deciding. But actually tho I created this powerful pistol build and was able to kill anything you see out in that wasteland in 5 shots or under. Except for the queen of course. 😂
---
Cleaner for your display case glass coming to the atom shop soon.  Only 1000 atoms.  Be patient.
---
Been using Ultracite for a while now but have been upgrading to T65. I have pretty much all the rare plans except for Targeting HUD. I can see how it can prohibitive though if you don’t have Cali rates shocks.
---
About 1/3 of this subreddit is people bitching about griefing.
---
Fallout 1st makes it all go away.
---
I got a full 1500 atom refund for the log cabin bundle and still get to keep it.
---
I simply asked for one and they gave it to me was quite surprised also worries me they won't be a fix for a while
---
I have a switch inside a locked building that I turn on or off.
---
Are you still playing?
---
It's terrible, IMO.
---
I get like a 100 fusion cells out of it a day
---
Irl day or in game day ?
---
In like a 2-4 hour session
---
Just a heads up, whenever you see wandering traders they have a chance to be clothing merchants and every time I have found them, they have 2 Hunters Long Coats on them.
---
and I wish i had a tiny violin emote
---
With all the one’s I’ve seen I have never had that happen.  Will be on the lookout.
---
Had a similar thing where someone was being attacked by a legendary scorch beast and hid in my base. My base which is at whitesprings. Like how do you even do that?! I dont know if it was like malicious and I wasnt even at my base, so it pretty much destroyed everything. Including my shower which I had JUST BUILT
---
It is fun to leave things for people around the map. 
---
Back when vendors were supposed to be released and then delayed, I got tired of keeping so much stuff in my stash...
---
So I decided to take everything that I had saved for my vendor and traveled around the map and gave all of the items to people, making sure it was level specific. It was everything from 1\* weapons and armor to 3\* weapons and armor, including TSE stuff (they are not my thing when it comes to playing). It was great to hear people say thank you and give lots of &lt;3 emotes.
---
Just bind them as favorite and use up
---
Go buy some plans you don't know or go search camps for weapons armor you want.
---
Buy gold from the wayward guy
---
YES! But it has to display the captain Picard picture when it does it!
---
“Right” is reserved for regular Stimpaks. But you can bind it to any spot on your favorites wheel (“Up” instead of “Right”).
---
I lived in some vault in Fallout 4 and the space was awesome, but they probably can’t do it with a server.
---
There were codes to spawn bad guys. I built an arena inside the vault, would spawn something like some super mutants, raiders, and a death claw, then watch the fight from above.
---
That's a cool one.  got that drop on first the try.
---
Hmm. Well, I know what I’m doing with all the propaganda my comrade robot brings me.
---
Lol.
---
I have the fixer plan in my vendor for 25k caps.
---
Will it sell?
---
Probably not.
---
But I just like people to know I have a spare
---
I was literally just building in there. Put up a little bistro with the Red Rocket bundle. I'd post pictures but am rather new to navigating Reddit. But could definitely understand the frustration involved on your side. Sorry that is happening.
---
All the places should be free fast travel. Why they charge for fast travel is beyond me.
---
It looked like all the armour had the sneak perk on it, is that how to get Covert and Sandman to constantly trigger? Also ultralight build all around for AP boost.
---
Can I get one
---
I don’t see the rare outfits merchants very often but it’s true, if you happen to encounter one the Hunter’s Longcoat and Longshoreman Outfit are usually available.
---
That’s pretty funny honestly.
---
I also use Ultracite! Coolest looking in my opinion.
---
All jokes aside I have like 48 of them. I’ll gift ya one for the funny post. I’m on Xbox GT blublzredeux (the giveaway guy)
---
This happened to me today for the first time, after killing the imposter sheepsquatch the body just, was not there. Never felt so defeated after such a perfect  run before
---
Pipe is life
---
Hmm, I dunno about that...
---
[https://i.imgur.com/5M18tlg.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5M18tlg.jpg)
---
man we should have the ability to change that. I just made like 1200 stimpak diffusers. Or if the game could recognize them as stimpaks, that would be helpful
---
I think a US flag emote like the one they made for the 94 raid would be sick
---
Happening to me as well when. I spawn in
---
No, but you get a few caps and maybe some junk when they dig.
---
depending on the height, you can take between 1 to 3 honey's during your descent, and you can thrust all the way down. No damage taken that way too. I jumped off the tallest building in Charleston and used 3 honeys to get to the bottom. The top of the lighthouse to the bottom takes 1 shortly after you jump.
---
It's the explosive part sets you back, not the fact that it's an energy weapon. The SBQ has extremely high explosive resistance, even against broken weapons like explosive lasers. Laser and Plasma Gatlings (non explosive) do wonders against the SBQ. Your weapon is fantastic for basically 99% of the game, you just need something else for Scorched Earth.
---
Yes Im aware of.how hard and the risks of getting scam these days with trades are and to lose something that was difícult to get hurts a lot. Im pretty sure you ve gotten some good things to compensate for the loss ones.
---
It used to work well like three or four months back, then one day it decided the walls weren't solid anymore. Such a shame its my favourite prefab.
---
Unfortunately, with the influx of new players after WL, they weren't here before BGS borked the entire PP event. There used to be veterans, and dedicated teams when you could trigger it.
---
Now, I'd be surprised if any of the 100ish players knew what to do.
---
I never keep my caps over 25k. Rather than shutting off vendors and loosing out on potential sales, spend the caps and get something useful. Theres no need to keep that many caps. If you finished the Wastelanders questline, buy your weekly gold from The Wayward. Thats 6k caps easy. Then visit vendors and see if theres anything you want. Another cap sink is treasure maps. Buy those from vendors and find the treasure. You can get pretty decent mod plans from the divide, mire, and bog treasure maps.
---
does this add with high capacity mod or is it one or the other thanks
---
From my experience, people don't generally use chat unless they need to get something across quick(like a phone call vs text message). Usually when people do talk, everyone seems to be pretty courteous and welcoming. 
---
I tend to run about solo so I can't really say about collecting scrap with people. I'll just go about my business and leave them to do whatevver. You could always try inviting people to your team. I usually accept invites almost immediately for various reasons. The main reason though would be fast-travel points. 
---
As for the loot, I believe that it tends to be available to whoever got a shot in on the enemy. During events, it can sometimes be anyone within close proximity as well. I believe loot laying around tends to be a first-come basis. 
---
Most people I've seen tend to only go to other camps to either buy stuff or use it as a pit-stop for the benches and stash(sometimes fast-travel points again). So I don't think there's all too much worry unless you somehow manage to piss them off pretty directly. If your camp is destroyed(like another comment said), your C.A.M.P. should give you the option to repair everything so long as you have all the materials. If you plant anything, I could recommend you plant at least 1 extra and store it(press square twice in edit mode) so you don't have to go searching around for the specific produce. 
---
The only bad thing I've noticed(aside from bugs, glitches, and such) is that lower level random players(maybe up to to 50\~60ish) tend to loot your junk the moment you die. Higher level players will usually leave everything alone though. The community overall is pretty nice but I would just suggest that you don't die with a ton of junk on hand while near other players. You're simple bound to lose it whether someone does get greedy or simply just thought someone dropped it.
---
I can help you out as well if you need gear, aid, materials, or just doing missions.
---
Nice, I’m on PS4.
---
Fast travel should just be free
---
My current theory is that everyone who knows how to complete this quest already got what they wanted when it first released and no longer bother joining. All that are left are new players and the occasional veterans. 
---
The current status of the event is the perfect cocktail that puts new players off, so much that they abandon it all together (never learning the objectives in the process). The only real time they try the event is from someone else doing the Imposter Sheepsquatch mission.
---
I'll re-iterate from past threads. It needs a revamp. At best, an increase to 20 minutes total (maybe increase the imposter HP to compensate a bit) automated audio queues to inform players of the current situation, a bit less chaos (lessen the spawn rate of the other robots by a bit) and a super reduced price tag to restart (500-1000 caps for the Assaultron Keycard circuit board). Too much happens in very little time. I think lengthening the overall event, while adding audio queues to inform players will help in the long run.
---
Very true. Friends and I get a stack of 10 each and take turns digging. Best to wait till the end of the dig prizes popping up before starting next dig. Same as opening xmas presents or the moleminer pales.
---
same here, seems like the only plans I get from the queen are either Ultracite PA or various jetpack plans. I don't get why the queen would drop plans for the armor when it's given to everyone as a quest reward.
---
Thanks mate, that explains why my explosive fat laser doesn't do much either.
---
You can't use a cutscene as proof lmao, I'm talking about the in-game armor design
---
A Canadian flag on July 1st would be cool too. But I understand there would be a lack of them in West Virginia. I bet most people living there can’t point Canada out on a map.
---
I dig it. I would like to see Workshops changed into Faction Outposts with this very idea implemented at them, removing PvP of course.
---
Exact same thing happened to me last night
---
I know a spawn on the kitchen table of the house near the Landview Lighthouse (Path to Enlightenment).
---
I've wanted to do that a few times.
---
Rewinded out of there huh.
---
The Wood Shop huh? I wonder what they're selling.🤔
---
I’m all smiles! GT FireFire88
---
Yes I agree. It's hilarious that communist flags were put in before American flags.
---
What they should do is there is something else that you need to buy with gold and it makes it so you take little to no fall damage
---
Message me on Xbox. I’ll hook ya up tomorrow. I’m off for the night.
---
5/5 wood shop there again
---
High cap mod takes up the only mod slot, so you cannot have 2 mods at once
---
So having two cushioned modded legs doesn’t do anything, or is it diminishing returns kinda thing?
---
did you attach the wires?
---
I think once you get to max reputation with a faction or once you complete all of their main quests you should get free fast travel points to their bass places like  the Enclave bunker and foundation and crater and so on tho at the same time if they don't do it I won't be surprised I just have a bunch of water purifiers going 24/7 so i make my money back when i sell them
---
Heavy guns or bust imo.. when you meet that duo of mirlok queens and 6 mirlok kings with a large side of mirloks you will wish you went heavy..
---
Why did they delet your post. That’s ridiculous
---
One man's war against arguably the most docile of the mutated creatures who generally defend nothing but the waters edge... Can you please expand into Mole Rats for the love of God.
---
U on xbox I have ultracite calibrated shocks plan for trade
---
[honestly though, that’s like half of the fun with the jet pack ](https://youtu.be/MvkN3003iU4?t=58s)
---
It says removed rule 6... I guess I’ll have to look that up. I rarely post but I’m always on. One time I do haha
---
Yes. They will try and reach them through windows too.
---
Yes. I just noticed the vendors are empty and my display cases are empty too.
---
[Done](https://i.imgur.com/M3F3xbW.png) &amp; [Done](https://i.imgur.com/emhdeSR.png)!
---
Thanks! *edit: Used an M79 grenade launcher. IDK if power armor is required. Shit happens.
---
I seen what rule 6 was and I don’t feel your post shoulda been taken down. Either way, I enjoyed it.
---
Money sink
---
I put mine behind garage doors. When I flip the switch to close the doors, not only do the doors close but power turns off on my vendors. This cause my camp to be removed from the map.
---
To you. I’m not traveling to babysit your camp. There to shop and move on.
---
&gt; Also, the purveyor should have always been free
---
Wait, it is?
---
It is a pretty good area to farm yellow flux and the best for fluorescent flux and high radiated fluid. Btw today I farmed 19  Stable yellowcake flux in the Foundation area. I would love to nuke the Crater but I am scary to death if they will make me to start over their stupid daily quests.
---
makes sense since it would come in a later update, as an event just as described to help either faction secure a new location/settlement area/whatever this shit writes itself
---
I woulda grognaked emoted next to you while you died. Why do you think the bags not specifically for you after you die? It’s almost like Bethesda intentionally made it that way on purpose!
---
Happened to me this weekend.  Everything got de-listed and put away.  Hope nobody robbed me from that rumored stash exploit but everything critical looked there.
---
Is it only those, I have a quad limb damage.
---
No, because I can never actually see shit when games are "real night".
---
Grab a tesla rifle. Tag everything.
---
got it. ty!
---
You can get it for a month FOR LESS THEN 2k Atoms worth. You can easily farm up enough junk within the month to make it irrelevant.
---
Ahh you're right, my bad!
---
Fixed it!
---

(I dunno if those full-suit sprites really help either way though..., but at least the inventory icon has some more detail to it)
---
All my stuff is in my stash, nothing is missing, it just won’t show my vendors as being powered even though they have power, and they are empty as well as the display cases. Did our have to put everything back?
---
I get wood every time I shop there.. Lol
---
Yes and they should show when you put in your first item.
---
Thanks! I’ll be on tomorrow afternoon sometime or later this week. I appreciate the hook up!
---
Fair point, my memory is worse than I thought
---
Vendors need power and stuff to show on the map
---
I said they have power, more than once.
---
-sips tea in Canadian-
---
Mole rats and Rad-scorpions are next on the list
---
Cool hit me up. I do the giveaways at 8p EST so I’m on around then for an hour. Anytime before or after 8-9p I’m free.
---
Maybe they were just feeling very existential and realised that the heat death of the universe is only around the corner and that in the end everything is meaningless, so they thought "Fuck it I'm out."
---
I would try scrapping all of your wires and reattaching them again , works for me whenever my powered door stops working
---
&gt;soft landing
---
You need a '59 Corvega for that.
---
You also said they are empty more than once🤦‍♂️
---
The plan yes the outfit no
---
The sack at whitesprings railroad
---
The plan is pretty rare at this point, but I see the outfits for sale from 100-750 caps from those who know the plan
---
Wasteland Wanderer gives you a 2 hour 5% xp boost when you sleep. The effect is called Kindred Spirit &amp; replaces Well Rested. She gives you constant positive affirmations too 🥰
---
That only happens on the sets crafted after wasetlanders. If you crafted it before it's fine. Also solar/thorn as well as the v94 mask armor crafted before wastelanders lost their vines
---
No, vendors don't need power to work. Turning of power just removes the map icon.
---
ye
---
Fuck I'll be camera-man if that's the case!!!
---
If you're gattling plasma is non explosive do not use the splitter.
---
Just sounds like the suppressor perk card
---
Nope, sorry.
---
ok i am dumb
---
Pull up your camp and set it back down.  Free. My camp is complex and I have it set so I can drop all the building down quick. I’m at whitesprings and do this when I’m about to get nuked
---
It is but with down sides
---
i know how to do it, i just don't activate pylons because i'm a bloodied build and whenever i do activate a pylon i always die pretty quickly, so i let someone who has a different type of build do it. i could spam stimpacks but i don't have enough and even if i did the game is too laggy and non responsive, i find myself dying in any situation that requires me to use stimpacks quickly simply because the game doesn't respond to my pressing the hotkey for stimpacks.
---
Don’t give them any more pay to play ideas
---
Thanks. I just fixed it now. I had to scrap all my vending machines.
---
Snowbirds.   :)
---
It does, fingers crossed!
---
Happy cake day btw!
---
Well the new T-51b isn't perfect either, looking back on the originals, there's definitely some tweaks that could be made. 
---
And regardless, they definitely need more paints/skins for the ultracite, very underappreciated. 
---
I would love one that makes it look closer to the classic T-51b coloration. Until then, I've been using the Outcast one from Nuclear Winter, it's not bad...
---
Could you do mine if your free?
---
If you store you vendors you will need to reload them. If you build a room there is still a chance, maybe small, that someone can get to your vendors when your camp is loading.
---
Bruh that's what I am saying!! I was fucking hit with a wave of ghouls, all-around level 25 thankfully, and there was like 6-7 of them. That cunt came back running out of the different room when I was done with them... -\_- Like god dammit...not only you lack leadership skills (I don't understand how she even got the position of the overseer) but she has a fucking laser pistol....And she is not even using it (but when she is, she misses like 70% of the shots...
---
still waiting for a fix to the lighting bug on the wooden floors. really disappointing.
---
Happens to me alot as well (xbox), i find half of the time i can still “collect” the items by tapping A even though the loot list is blank but even then thats only half the time. The other half of the time the light will turn green/yellow and still have nothing in it.
---
Started happening a few weeks back around facshnat
---
A lot of the time I play it like Minecraft; I enjoy gathering resources and inventory management, so I see everything else as a bonus. Falloutcraft. I have a heart flutter every time I take the pile of plastic plates from the table in Morgantown HS gym, clink clink clink.
---
Having a consistent group of people to play with helps as well, I think it'd be a miserable experience playing solo all the time.
---
Finished it on xbox this morning, so probably just bad luck.
---
My Red Asylum Outfit took me two straight months. Every single day I would server hop 10-20 times looking for it. I'm never going in that fucking asylum again. Especially after the time the Wendigo was in the fucking elevator waiting for me on Floor 1.
---
Lol, I spent over 100 modules to get a full set of 3* Unyielding Secret Service armor. You crying for 2?
---
Yea honestly love the ultracite power armor, I hope in the fall when they're rumored to be adding the bos will hopefully expand upon it, maybe they could add ultracite armor that isn't power armor
---
I'm not near the rebel you are.  Today out of sheer boredom I went camp to camp cleaning out all the junk from collectrons that players never put on a lock.
---
-slurps poutine in Canadian-
---
So what lottery numbers are you picking?
---
Haha seriously that’s half a normal day
---
I'm waiting on the Thanksgiving displays to come back. Nice shelves, no glass, storing heads and other body parts in my kitchen will look so much more natural
---
Anything that gives puts out legendary items. There is no specific event, creature, or machine that gives it more than the others.
---
I got Healing Factor mutation at low level by accident, then the bug started. After a couple days with that fuckery, I took a shower to remove it and never had the bug since.
---
Fingers crossed! 
---
I hope power armor in general gets a little more love with the fall/bos update, especially ultracite.
---
I've had it quite a few times. I've often farmed the ghouls at the whitesprings golfclub and there have been a few times after I killed a few, I suddenly hear a bunch of ghouls just die. I think it might be a bug with a mechanic that is supposed to kill off some of the "mob" npcs to make sure they don't just keep spawning. I remember one time the mechanic didn't kick in at all and for some apparent reason, I had 30+ whitespring Mr. Handys turn on me over by the service entrance(there was more or less a sea of them and everything was lagging HARD).
---
I was thinking that or maybe another possible mechanic of where another player spawns in and the game is trying to "reset" the spawn for them.
---
While this has been discussed here numerous times already, i have to say.. There is plenty of daily caps in this game already. If i had a choice in the matter i would remove the 150 daily scrip one, as we got similar cap now with gold bullion. So many benefits out of removing scrip limit. Inventory space included.
---
Dude, I don't want to do that again. Never again
---
Or you could stealth, find any legendary mobs actually worth killing, one hit that mob, loot it, and avoid the shit show of killing mirelurk's, namely the kings and their terrible loot table.
---
...they weren't, though? I've had a US Flag since some time last year, I think... it just hasn't been available in the Shop for a while now.
---
No kidding lol
---
Lmao maybe if I wasted my life away like you did playing the game I wouldn’t?
---
That too, I’m just holding legendaries waiting to trade them in. But yeah I had figured this is a topic that has been previously discussed several times. My frustrations have just finally peaked as I basically just threw away 14 legendary modules.
---
In my opinion power armor in general needs more love
---
Took me a month to get enough gold and rep. to start crafting and saved all the modules the hole time. 100 was enough for a full set unyielding - one piece with sentinel.
---
It was a little painful and I'm still struggling with full stash box, but I didnt loose my mind 🤯
---
Indeed. American flag has been around since early last year an has 3 variations. Regular, sun yellow, and mono.
---
I had to craft 25 pieces on average to get what I wanted (5 3*Unyielding) for every limb. Not complaining. Now on to get 4(got one already) really good pieces now that will be a grind;)
---
I stacked a set of the cabinets from the "Modern Tables" plan using the glitch to clip items together using terrain, then made an overhang on the top by placing a couple of them on a small rug and clipping that into the top cabinet. It's janky under close scrutiny but it's the best I could manage; I can take a screenshot later if you're interested. I've seen a video where someone managed to clip the coffee table from that same plan into a wall with three of those cabinets on it, it looked great but I have no idea how they managed to pull it off.
---
Also helps for dissapearing mountain camps  when the owner disconnects.
---
Lol, I work a 9-5 and barely play 2 hours a day and I still have time to grind away at my rolls. Full SS armor and bloodied 3* gauss mini.
---
If you think you can get All the cool stuff in life without doing any Work, I'm affraid it might be you wasting your life...
---
Yeah, it's a bitch
---
should’ve been saving up modules man
---
if you are on xbox and you are still missing some of them common or uncommon masks let me know i have like 30-40 of each kind, ill give you the one missing
---
AA FFR automatic silenced 10mm shreds everything (except main bosses solo, but it's still a viable build for group boss events) in a matter of seconds if you play a low health stealth build. Vats headshots ftw. One of my alts runs that build an it's lots of fun I can tell you -))
---
Still, pistol builds need their own separate armor piercing perks (as other builds do) to make their primary affixes more viable. I think they must put'em into perception instead of agility since it's already a problem to slot everything in if you wanna play a stealth build and also wanna have some basic things like action boy for instance.
---
Standing on the roof can keep her from landing, so it's discouraged.    
---
    
---
I don't know why shooting her in the air is a problem. That's been pretty common every time I've done it.
---
Id bet money more West Virginians can find canada on a map before canadians can find west virginia
---
Oh snap ok! That’s perfect thank you!
---
I've been dressing up as a black bear and hopping up to new players and giving them level appropriate hardened sniper rifles and about 50 rounds to boot. I then give a thumbs up/ heart/ gift emote and hopping away. Bouncing bear bares gifts. Spreading the love across West Virginia one bolt action rifle at a time. I love the Fallout 76 community. Makes me happy and I'm sure it makes some people wonder.
---
Chinrse stealth armor.  So easy to get and literally nothing can touch you.  Its God mode.
---
I'm on a break until the colossus event comes out. Nothing wrong with some variety in your life.
---
Do you even have to go to a wayshrine didnt play much of that game but im pretty sure you could to any wayshrine youve found from anywhere
---
Wait vendor's are back online?
---
Also goat legs if needed
---
U paid 100 script, u should get a 2* 
---
Change my mind.
---
Can save your cash and renew at a good point between the next 2 first cosmetic drops.  Nothing wrong with letting it lapse, you won’t be missing much id wager.
---
They found me when i teleported to take a picture at that alley place, i got jumped, i was glad i was using my build.
---
I went to some dudes camp and bought all his 3 star garbage weapons to scrip. He jumps on the mic and says he’s got 10 more for 2k caps. I agree. He drops them and I leave. When I went to trade them in I notice an AA explosive laser rifle....... not sure if that was on purpose, but lucky me.
---
Yeah I have the plans for that through the mission, but if I wear it my bloodied build is nowhere near as effective as the it gets rid of my old unyielding set that I’m wearing until I build a new SS unyielding set and the under armor I have.
---
What challenge needs slim pack diffusers? I’m curious because I have hear about stimpack  diffusers but I never knew how to get them or what they do
---
the only way to get a legendary fixer is doing pulls from the Purveyor or trading for them in general.
---
The vault was designed to permanently seal and cease life support functions after the final resident left (you.)
---
There is a rare issue where one day your vendors will be emptied. Your map icon will become a tent since you are no longer selling anything. 
---
It appears that everything is moved to stash. Just redo the vendors. I’ve not read that this is a recurring issue for most players. 
---

Lol it took me 30 rolls to get a good gauss shotgun. Think I did 10 or so minis, got bloodied bash lol called it good enough for now. I'm on sabbatical til the colossus event comes out
---
Trust me i understand people told me to to do all sorts of areas and to stay away from high level mobs, news flash high level mobs are everywhere and high level players cause it.. certain areas are always high as well which is just annoying as you are trying to progress..
---
From a role play perspective, it doesn’t matter if it’s survival or not, paying to fast travel makes no sense? So if you’re assuming it’s a survival game that is entirely realistic 1. you should never pay for fast travel 2. No one can fast travel (and who would play that?) 3. You can implement a system where there’s a “Robbery Risk” which may take some caps. Say, you’re fast traveling from Cranberry Bog up to the Scouts up North. Since it’s so far, there’s like a 70% chance of being robbed and losing around 40 caps, Idk, something like that. 
---
But the argument “It’s a survival game” doesn’t hold up when you realize it’s a role playing survival game.
---
Or have it like GTA style u can chose one of many buildings and have that one as house
---
Thank you! I agree with justaguess, I'm not sure if the power armor is required but I was not able to do it without it for some reason. Get close to the far right already in power armor and jump on the case and had to move around until it gave me the 'pick up' notification.
---
I don't see personally why you would want or expect a pipe weapon to be decent at anything. The point is that it is literally a rudimentary crafted gun because no real gun was around for the owner. It should not perform as well as actual machined weapons.
---
How do I get that tricentenial and other tags people have on names
---
Wish I could relate &gt;:( I’ve been playing since B.E.T.A. and I still only have around 2,000 caps on me on average. Sometimes I drop to like 400 and have to promise myself not to buy anything for like a month just so I can save up.
---
I let my Fallout 1st run out i'm not returning till Fallout 76 leveling overhaul comes and they fix the damn dailies to actually be daily again.
---
They don’t drop off legendary enemies or events? I thought I Knew someone who got one from faschnaut? And someone told me radiation rumble but I’m not sure
---
Do what ever you want, I got 4 characters. I'll never run out of things to do;) But somhow I need to tackle the ever growing pile of games before it gets to big.
---
Psn: alphaboomer
---
Thanks!!
---
Tadpole Medic badge. It would be one of the easiest badges (craft 3x antibiotics, disease cures &amp; stimpaks; use 3 stimpaks; use 3 stimpak diffusers) except you can only get the diffusers from crafting them (or buying/receiving them from another player) and the recipe is a rare drop from Project Paradise.
---
@OP: I wish you were on PC, I'd be happy to buy them for 300 caps, let alone get them for free. Kudos for paying your good fortune forward.
---
You get a private world a scrap box with limateless storage and a few skins and enough atoms to buy a mid price pack from the shop not really worth it the scrap box is amazing but really not worth the price
---
Oh thanks, I never did the tadpole quests and I wanted to start them so thanks for letting me know!
---
I guess they believe shooting her with some perks equipped still breaks her landing animations and she remains in the air for much longer this way.
---
Also, why spend tons of ammo shooting her at a great distance (thus doing rather small amount of damage) while you can do much more damage per round while she's closer to you (and easier to hit) on the ground?..
---
ya, i know, i got all that - im just wondering if they publish what the rotating bonus is...like this month, its some scout/wood paints. but how would anyone know if they didnt already have it? or how long it will be available for?
---
I don't get why people do these grinds.. I must be strange but when i see the odds and the requirements i just go fuck that.. Am i just not the standard.
---
Sorry we don’t all play the game like you do. When you have a heavy gunner load out, primarily using the minigun, 5mm rounds can get pretty scarce. Even fifteen minutes in Cranberry Bog can drop 3,000 rounds for me. So buying rounds of ammo is a little quintessential
---
It's possible. Destiny 2 has cross-save across consoles and PC. But it's not a common practice, so I imagine there are hurdles involved (bureaucratic, if not technical; I know they've had headaches with Sony before).
---
The Fasnacht Event provides you a legendary reward with the same pulls you can get from the purveyor :P
---
I think the only real way to know is be subbed..
---
Awesome! Does radiation rumble also? If you know
---
You're welcome ♥
---
What update/leak is this? Can't find any information anywhere
---
Yeah, bugged guns work wonders when you need to end unnecessarily long fights. Sadly devs seem to have fixed some of those on PTS already. Tested a jffr lmg there: doesn't work anymore.
---
Bless you !  I’ve been searching for idk how long for this thing 
---
Psn: gloryofthelost
---
Damn, you beat me. I was too busy thinking about Kermit the frog sipping his tea.
---
Lucky guy. Wish I had that RNG the past few days. But Congrats
---
I run a bloodied PA Heavy character, so honestly none of what you suggests really even effects me. I'll agree with you though on the basis that things do need to change, I'm just the kind of person that's more in favor of buffing other things than nerfing other things. I'd rather see quality and variety brought up.
---
One thing I'll slightly disagree with is how you stress things like regular scorch beasts, MLQ, behemoths... I don't use sneak damage at all and I deal with them just fine in a few seconds, not even using my bloodied weapons. I can kill them with my vampire's gatling laser only relying on the weapon bonus from Adrenal mutation. I can't one shot them though, if that's what you're referring to the Bloodied Unyielding doing.
---
Now the near god mode levels of sneak, I have no experience with. I've never played a sneak character so I'll take your word on that. Playstyle never suited me at all so I haven't touched it. 
---
Let's be honest though, currently the meta of Bloodied Unyielding is the most popular because it grants the best results. Players swarm to what will allow them to clear content in the easiest and most efficient manner. Not saying EVERY player does that, but it's a common occurrence. Bethesda seems content to keep adding enemies that are flat out ammo sponges or long winded grinds that take literal months to complete, thus inadvertently increasing the appeal of a "maximum efficiency" type of build like Bloodied Unyielding.
---
I hear you, I really do. Being a power armor user, even running Emergency Protocols/Nerd Rage/Adrenal, I still feel lesser and sub optimal when standing next to a friend of mine who runs full bloodied unyielding.
---
Wood and wood accessories I see.
---
&gt; if we had events that added some action specifically at these landmarks.
---
Same here. There's always other stuff to play in the meantime. Most people have a decent backlog.
---
noobs trying to do missions would get lit up
---
Dude he’s literally stating facts. You’re not listening to him, and you’re calling him intolerant when all he’s saying is “Hey, some of us need Fast Travel. It shouldn’t be taken away from all players because some of us don’t have the time to walk everywhere, because we have jobs, kids, a significant other, or other life events we have to deal with. If you don’t want to use it - say, for role playing or just a general difficulty you put on yourself - don’t use it. But don’t ruin it for the rest of us.”
---
Don’t call someone intolerant without listening to their point. That makes YOU intolerant
---
I don't really know haha, maybe..
---
You know they are swimming in caps when you see the neon signs. That plan costs like 10k.
---
I just want an Australian flag. It would be cool if they released a world flags pack.
---
Currently it's just purveyor and the daily ally quests
---
sweet melt..
---
I recommend starting with the athletic badge, that one is without a doubt the easiest. If you can get someone to help, the swimming badge is also easy, but it requires reviving a player that was downed in a body of water (hence getting someone to help). You need 3 in total to progress to possum. If you can't find diffusers for medic, I'd suggest mammalogy or entymology; those are both primarily focused on taking photos. Entymology also requires a mothman wing, and mammalogy also requires milking 10 brahmin. Note that pictures of corpses will count; for example, I photographed the static honeybeast corpse at the Freakshow when I was doing entymology. All the other badges are way more grindy imo.
---
Same here. I just come there and wait for her to land. Got enough firepower to do enough damage in couple seconds just to get the loot. Why bother doing more damage if there are people who can't care less about ineffectively wasting thousands of rounds to shoot her in the air?
---
The caravan walls/windows are broken too, you can just walk through.
---
Support gives every user a free refund. Probably 1 each year. So don't worry, they fixing it and your refund are unrelated.
---
Yeah welcome to the purveyor grind. Enjoy your stay. I get more enjoyment every day of trying for the pie from the machine at the purveyor than the crafting of my two legendaries per day since I know my crafts will disappoint me.
---
I've been trying to a bloodied plasma caster for a month now. So I've spent around... 60 modules on plasma casters? Best I got was a 3 star instigating I use. Everything else has been trash.
---
Thanks for the tips, I do appreciate it! I’ll try it out later today, thanks
---
This is what I do for the event so I can take all the pylons and then shoot some robots when I can.
---
I have a medics pump shotgun, with bash dmg. According to my dmg on weapon, it is my weakest shotgun.  But when I use it in vats, it one shots everything. My other shotguns with dmg numbers much higher,  still take at least 2 shots alot of the time.
---
Sweet melt?
---
When I read what they promised to FO1 subscribers and MOOOONNTHS later they did not deliver anything.  personally, I would not believe they are going to publish any rotating bonus, haha.
---
Sadly it's fixed in current PTS build.
---
So like vault 21 in New Vegas?
---
and that's the sad reason bethesda won't do anything about this...
---
-says "Sorry" in Canadian
---
I always have one room at my camp that's locked for just such an occasion. If I need to step away but don't want to log out, I'll put myself in this locked room. That way these jerks need to pick the lock to pull that stunt, which gives them a wanted bounty, then you can kill em and get your stuff back.
---
Its not a sure fire solution, but better than going AFK out in the open.
---
-says "Sorry" in Canadian-

Next to the wood emporium, the wood space, woods r us...

Imagine my sadness when I realized Strangler Heart is Ultracite. :(

3/6 peices in.
---
Nice one! Unless I’m miss-remembering, the Pleasant Valley Station vendor has been selling them recently too. 
---
Now also, do I have to be in a team to make the quest work, or can I just let off a Diffuser with other, random players around?
---
Play with a nighttime mod for FO4 then think about how that would go down in FO76.
---
Literally cannot see more than a foot in front of you.
---
Are you judging my first daughters name “glowing diseased bulbous feral ghoul”?
---
The leveling haul I hear vague mentioning about - is there something written about what that means?  I haven't seen anything specific.  I'm kinda a sucky player and rely on being overpowered a bit.  Will this change mean I'll face level 105 characters if I'm 105?  That could spell my doom....  'get good' is not in my skill set.....
---
You can move your camp and it should repair, even if you just move a small amount.
---
Add goat legs and it's like "what's fall damage?"
---
That's an awesome gesture, but I'm on PC. Thank you, though.
---
Did you do any server testing? Meaning if your first 2-3 pieces didn’t result in Unyielding or Vanguard (as I understand those are harder to roll) then server hop and roll again?  I try to store up my modules until I have 30-40 and do it this way.   I don’t know if it makes any difference or not though.
---
I placed the camp inside the bottle and started with foundations and stairs in the water
---
What other legendary effects do you have on your shotgun, any armor pieces with Blocking effects on them, just asking because of magic damage on shotguns.
---
What.
---
I've built a separate building with the windows on the opposite side.
---
Sounds like a good idea
---
Must reread this when I get home karma will repay you my friend 👍
---
Damn that's news to me. It's kinda sucky as this is something we *bought* ya know.
---
Yep it’s been oct 23 2103 for 2 months now
---
Another option would be to claim any intact boarded up house on the map and say you are reclaiming your pre-war home as long as it's not earmarked fora future update.
---
See the problem there is that a level is not necessarily indicative of experience. I am 190ish but have only really got the hang of it over the last few weeks and I have done it a lot! Levelling up can be done quickly especially with the xp events but it's time playing and failing that gets you the experience needed for this event. It is a tough event, it's meant to be, so unless you have op weapons then you need a team of Coordinated people to plan exactly how to do it. One of the ingest problems with the public side is that you have very little time to prepare when it pops up randomly and for this event most people need to prepare either sorting out ammo or perks or both.
---
&gt; I forgot the last
---
SPICY
---
The vault sealed, and it wouldn’t fit with the “leave the vault and fix the world” theme 76 has
---
Does FFR not work at all on it, I would’ve assumed it would work, maybe it’s because it has to charge up, iirc the Gauss Rifle has the same issue.
---
your ignorance is flabbergasting
---
gl
---
Really? I feel stupid for not knowing this, thanks!
---
Ok! If you say so! Just giving my input :)
---
Make some friends. That makes things hella easier but don’t take advantage of it like only use help when completely necessary like to get past the bit that’s rough and then try again solo
---
Oh wow! so that is actually a thing people do. I thought it was some sort of glitch because I actually got some decent plans out of it.
---
of course it is. cause i do it.lol
---
i check their prices first, if they are selling too high i just let whatever it is attack their camp
---
it really speaks to the state of things that saying "we shouldn't have to p2w" gets you downvoted
---
delet this
---
could you build a half wall, put a roof on it, place the cabinet and then remove the roof and wall and put a full size wall there?
---
Yes, that would be amazing for them to do that cause for me atleast it feels as if I am always at 40 caps because I need to buy stimpaks and 45. from every vendor on the map just to be prepared for something that is on the otherside of the map and the only thing close to is Vault 96 for example. now, if Bethesda ever follows thru with this. it is up to the future to know.
---
Anywho, good luck out there fellow Vault 76 dwellers. See ya out there!
---
Thank you, sad about the PS4 thing but I did learn a lot from your post so thank you for that :)
---
I know the Guy that runs that shop. Given him many a wood piece because it’s worthless to me.
---
Cushioned is a 40% reduction, even with two you need something to cover the last 20%
---
Cushioned is only a 40% reduction so two pieces isn't enough to cover all the damage.
---
Level stops meaning anything past 50.  From there on you can simply trade or buy the best gear.
---
I don't think there are any limitations to it, as far as services &amp; hardware go. Been playing COD:MW a lot recently &amp; I can seemlessly move between my PC &amp; PS4 if I so choose. It's also been nice to finally play with my buddies as I'm very much a PC guy but the rest are console (and still heavily divided there). Crossplay has been wonderful. 
---
The thing is there is a genuine concern over the PC based hacks &amp; what impact that could have on the currently separate console servers.
---
That said I've put in near 1000h on PC (and 60ish on PS4) and have yet to see any first hand. I don't, however, play NW &amp; I'm lead to believe that can be a nightmare. But if they followed suit with COD &amp; give players the option to allow crossplay or not, I don't know what the big issue is (as far as NW goes).
---
It could impact the "economy" but again I don't bother with trading via outside methods, or at all frankly, so can't really say my opinion on that is worth much.
---
Vats hit him?  Vats is messy in PvP. Works with railways and gamma guns I believe but not much else.
---
It's just weird that it would happen as I'm battling them. Just suddenly decided it's time to die and their life bars half full. Ha
---
I can't wait for proper mod support.  Treat the server's like ark or rust where if you play on officials then you follow all game rules just like we are playing in now.  Custom servers would have its own player characters seperate from the official servers and that server would be modded the way the sever owner has it, you need all the mods that the sever is using and play there.  
---
The reason this won't happen is no one will need to pay for cosmetics or 1st so Bethesda would stop making money off custom map players
---
Oh, shoot! I would have server hopped. Ha
---
Yup. Really not a survival. In a "game challenge" and a "game genre" sense both.
---
IMO that's another fail of Bethesda - poor game difficulty balance.
---
Doing all FO76 questlines with no-\* common weapons is quite easy.
---
So ... why do I need to grind for faction rep weapons/armor then? For killing SB easier so I can grind SB even easier?
---
I'm constantly dumping chems. I'll gift them to fresh out of the vault players a lot. Some get confused and take off. I don't blame them.
---
When we say we're sorry, we mean it eh?
---
Haven't got the helmet yet but did get the uniform, yay!
---
Be aware you will cause a mess, so pick up anything loose in the room that you want to keep before you do this.
---
For example today I learned that [all the books in the shelves outside that room are individual assets](https://i.imgur.com/hdU7R8c.png?1) even though you can't pick them up yourself. Whoops, sorry lady.
---
Ha, that is a thought!
---
Why on Earth do you guys ask for stuff to pay for in the Atomic shop? it's so weird.  
---
An American flag shouldn't be an paid for features, especially in the culture that is in Bethesdas Fallout.
---
Yeah it should work.  
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hc70vz/any_way_to_fix_my_camp_ive_been_building_since/
---
Also make sure you have Contractor Level 2 to reduce construction costs by 50% when building or when repairing manually.
---
She's got a robot to clean all that up. It's all good!
---
Ahh I see thank you
---
Yeah I tried vats and no vats but he was tough lol
---
I just want some good quality quest for ones :'(
---
You do realise the new gauss weapons without the clandestine paint look like a mess and dont fit the secret service look at all. And what kind of skin should be added?
---
You might like Fallout Shelter you're essentially Overseer of your own Vault and you can build it however you want
---
And all your crops break.
---
Oh hi, it’s me, the wood guy! Glad you like the shop, this is like its fifth incarnation, I really liked that little prebuilt spot. (and hey, free wood extractor, unlocked for free samples)
---
Anyway if you need wood, hit me up, I feel comfortable saying that I have the most comprehensive inventory in Appalachia. Been collecting the stuff since it started dropping with more than one star (and before then, but the shop started once the stars happened)
---
I also stock non-wood items as well, full list here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PjDOtlEGYEFh7nurW0FZOrG6pvhCWEq_72s57mxK3Bk/edit
---
There is actually alot of vault themed stuff.
---
Could you honestly expect any less with Bethesda given their track record over the past couple of years?
---
All they care about is spending the absolute bare minimum effort and try to squeeze out every last cent for it. 
---
The atomic store shit we got in that free bundle for all the vendor/display case problems we had to live with over the last couple of months or so speaks volumes. There wasn't much in the bundle at all, it wasn't unique or all that interesting and it was just a cynical recolour/retexture of existing items.
---
I stopped reading at 'took a workshop' because I've seen so many of these posts already. You took a risk and you lost. I'm sorry. Learn from it.
---
Maybe he was using super stimpack and other healing item 1st b4 battle u
---
Go to the main FO76 sub, click on the top right corner (on mobile) and "change user flair"
---
I meant it overall, the gauss weapons are just examples. When survivors bow could look "rugged and bones" around it, why not guns? Wild **example** \- animal/bear jaw/bones around it, similarly like bear claw weapon, instead of wires in it, it would be a weapon in it :D.
---
Plus, not everyone is using gauss weapons with a secret service basic look. Tons of people are using cosmetics - either atom store, or rare in-game costumes.
---
Why pay upfront for something you don't even know the quality of when it lands. There really isn't much to patch 20 at all so it may not be worth it until the next major content drop.
---
If I'm right in assuming you pay monthly for your sub, I'd just stop it and see how things play out in a week or so when it launches. If it looks good, go for it. If not, wait for the next major content drop and reassess your sub then.
---
That’s what I was thinking cause he healed real quick but oh well
---
wood doesn't look like a word anymore
---
That grind for mods on my strangler was real, ended up trading for mine but found the calibrated shocks in a vendor
---
I've started just buying from the purveyor again. I have yet to get a single Wastelanders weapon that is what I actually want. At least if I buy stuff from the purveyor I can sell some of it to other players. I like the idea of crafting legendaries and the way they did it with the solar and thorn armor works. One module, a bunch of vault steel and it guarantees a 3-star. But the rolls for the new stuff are so badly rigged and getting a one star is just insukting, especially when you can only get 1-2 rolls a day due to the scrip cap.
---
There are 4 sets in Watoga, usually T-51 and T-60. Only grab what you need from one of the chasis and then server hop.
---
Ok, thanks
---
Or alternately, have a settlement with buildings just south/east of sutton with the name "Vault Town" which would include a vendor marketplace where you can personalize your vendor with custom paints and an emblem :D
---
if youre build isnt made for pvp, you stand no chance
---
most survivability in pvp fight comes from perks and legendary effects that reduce damage rather than DR
---
dps on a decent build is simply so high that DR doesnt mean a lot
---
even with a fully specced pvp build your enemy can chew through your health relatively easy if he is doing it right and thats why aid items and healing became a necessary part in pvp fights, nuka cola quantums and super stimpaks with their respective perks are very powerfull and quantums can even be stacked
---
as for your weapon, tse is still viable in day to day pve but with perks and armor mods you can pretty much nullify explosive damage so youre basically left with a two shot weapon, wich divides your damage into two seperate projectiles with less damage individually, wich due to how the game works have a harder time penetrating armor
---
overall, you can feel like a god in pve but still wont stand a chance in pvp unless you highly invested into it
---
i made a pvp character once but didnt stick with it as i was in an odd place, where my build and equipment was good enough so that i was pretty much invincible to every casual player but got melted by pvpers because i couldnt adapt to the mechanics like aid spamming, stealthboys and such
---
My friends and I get ours online at [MODERNMASKS.CA](https://MODERNMASKS.CA) There is free shipping Canada-wide and they're soo stylish and comfortable!
---
It's a pretty house decorative gun. You can get them from the Pleasant Valley Ticket Butler. I'd say maybe like 1-2k caps. Usually you can get one every 10-20 rolls so I don't think they are worth much buy that's just my opinion. They look great on display though! I love the skin for them.
---
But not everyone is looking like a insane psycho with bones on their gun. Some may fit this look but the bear gauntlet is big and takes a lot of space so it wouldn't be very enjoyable. Maybe just some scrap metal would be better.
---
Yeah right now the turd squad are pouncing on anyone taking over workshops because the update is about to end their teaming up on people. Had the same thing happen to me. Didn't have as much stuff on me as you did but I was still pissed. So if you take over a workshop you are wide open for this crap. One more week and they're done. Just be sure to server hop after you get a workshop's items.
---
Thank ypu
---
Every Legendary effect has the same chance to drop, Unyielding is just as rare as Assassin's and all the other effects.
---
Its a pump with the gilded skin on it, making it quite fancy! Congrats! I have a bloodied fancy single action that i will probably never use. What effect does your pump have? Im curious if they are all set effects or not.
---
I subbed just for the attractive selection of tents, xmas in July.
---
Pvp is broken in Fallout 76. Part of it is a result of their Perk System and lack of leveling. It is so broken they just removed it from the game instead of fixing it. I don’t know why they don’t just finish it and remove it all together. 
---
Or add Survival mode back and fix pvp. Balance combat and the system.
---
Yeah, ive done that a few times and just feel sorry that they are often that afraid of high levels
---
At the white springs location?
---
Yeah, but no atoms only houses. We need a good cap sink. There were *always* gold sinks in ESO that 76 doesn’t have.
---
This. You have to hit it and hold it right before landing. Cushioned mods help but thats only because they're the only mods for secret service legs atm.
---
Fallout 1st is a rip honestly. Not worth the money in my opinion. It costs more to use fallout first then a whole year of Xbox live. Let that sink in.
---
*Finally, someone with the guts to exile me.*
---
dude, This is a fallout subreddit not r/endoftheworld also how did you even find this it is two months old and has nothing to do with real masks
---
You could also add things like a decent anti-cheat or adding a cool down timer for aid items to stop Quantum spamming, but I think the Pacifist Mode would get around the need for that.
---
Pipe weapons need more mods to make up for there weaker damage. Remember these are jerry rigged weapons and are supposed to be extremely customizable. Maybe add pipe only mods, like extended drum mags, bladed stocks, m79 grenade launcher barrel attachment.
---
Elder scrolls online runs a terrific shop.   Maybe they should work with zenimax more often.
---
Maybe a suite at the Hornwreight Towers costs 15k caps and one in Watoga is 10k? A house in grafton is 8k?
---
That's why you need to strap a broadsider on the Brahmin's back. The poor girl has got to have a way to defend herself.
---
Having PVP that’s engaging would help too. Waves based, capture the flag, resource turn in, anything but what we have.
---
Seriously what numbers.
---
Also dang I wish you’d stopped by the older iterations of the shop, I’m still working on that spot. For example, the shop lived down the road from Dolly Sods for months: https://imgur.com/a/FJrFNqL
---
That’s why I said “wild example”, it could be anything thematic, just  not the recolor, imo.
---
It’s worth is only slightly more than a non fancy version. Duping once again has ruined something nice.
---
The amount of modules and rolls doesn't matter. You have a shits chance every time. You could get on one roll, or, on roll 568, doesn't matter.
---
I'm sure you are doing this but make sure you have Super Super on, you can get more pieces that way, and in that case, doing 30-40 is better because you'll get more pieces from super duper.
---
I mist agree, some skins in ESO are amazing. However, at the same time, I am glad wr dont have these gamble boxes, lol.
---
Locking them behind new challenges would be good. I don’t know, caps only I could probably clear pretty fast. Maybe another rep grind based on turning in resources tied to a quest so FO1st players don’t have an edge.
---
I feel you on that man I just don’t play the games to pvp my build is entirely pve focusedso I’m outta luck
---
It may be you aren't doing enough damage to the SBQ to register rewards. I think you have to do like 1-2k damage to register. Otherwise they can also lag after they die and it won't show rewards for a few minutes after.
---
Day 1 bug fixes? Don't think so at this point
---
Do you have any mules? I mean, with fallout 1st, you might as well make a couple of mules with full pocked gear and have them hold on to some of those weapons to free up inventory. You could even decide to play one as an alt which means you can spend a bunch of caps buying plans and a bunch of script rolling for weapons for that new build.
---
This is true. More and better quality PvP content would be nice. 
---
I would play Nuclear Winter more if it wasn't for the hackers or long wait times to start a new match. 
---
But I've suggested this in regards to the upcoming changes to PvP, which a lot of people aren't happy with.
---
Him and that nudist poser samuel.
---
I doubt it, you’ll most likely end up hostile till you relog but if I ever get around to launching a nuke I will let you know :)
---
You can also have a full set crafted for you.  Many people have full set plans after the winter holiday rewards.
---
Yeah that’s a good idea, using other than just caps to purchase.
---
Vote with our money. I usually only buy items which are uniquely modelled. Re-textured and direct port from fo4 are no-no for me.
---
Pvp was most of what I did in WoW 12-15 years ago. As much as I didn’t like arena, it would be an improvement over NW. ANYTHING theme based that isn’t battle royale I would queue for.
---
Diminishing returns.
---
The only way to get 100% reduction is 2 Acrobat's armor pieces or power armor, or the Nuclear Winter version of Goat Legs(flat -100%). 2 Cushioned legs, 1 Acrobat's piece, Goat Legs 2, Bird Bones, and Strange in Numbers still has you take some fall damage. That should be quite well past 100%, but the game doesn't calculate those bonuses that way.
---
Hahaha. Yeah. :)
---
At least Samuel and page are in the same spot. I hate looking for ward now that he isn’t sleeping 90% of the time.
---
I'm a bit of a novice at the game, but I assume you mean for a nominal fee?
---
As interesting as that sounds, we are already getting internal instanced spaces for our camp. I'd settle to just have more free fast travel zones for Foundation, Crater, train stations, vaults, and maybe vendor camps. There's nothing more annoying than being at max caps and wasting a bunch of change traveling to vendor camps in multiple servers with casual or overpriced offerings.
---
They have been for at least a week now.
---
Yeah. Are you on Xbox? I’ll craft a set for you tomorrow if so.
---
It could work similar to GTA 5.
---
I'd say mess with your brightness in the in-game settings
---
I see no lies. I wood shop there in a minute.
---
This is a good idea
---
If only we had a crew of people that could break into a vault.
---
Thank you!
---
It annoys me SO much when people have a staircase leading directly into a door. No matter how nice or interesting the camp is it automatically loses points when I see it.
---
Legendary Fixer can drop only from purveyor, ally daily, and special events that use purveyor loot tables like Fasnacht.
---
20,000 caps and it’s yours
---
Unfortunately I'm not. I'm not very far in the game anyway, just planning ahead. Thanks, though.
---
Nope,  only from purveyor, ally daily, and special yearly events that use purveyor loot tables like Fasnacht.
---
I found one at a player vendor for a good deal a little while back. I was excited because I mainly use my shotgun anyway. Thought it'd make me unstoppable.  The accuracy was so bad you have to be about a foot away to hit something. Didn't help much to put a long barrel and a scope on it. I ended up going back to my generic combat shotgun and selling it.
---
Fallout 76 pvp is a joke. No skill required. They have been removing it because they would rather not balance it. At this point it’s a lost cause. They probably should remove it all together.
---
Would be great if we can build bunkers or vaults but the camp size will need to be increased a lot i built my vault in fallout 4 I loved it
---
you are leaving a LOT of damage on the table
---
In terms of roleplaying, who exactly are these caps even going to?  It's not like Skyrim where you pay the guy with a wagon.
---
Yeah, I don't think that we're able too. But I guess these instanced buildings Bethesda teasered (see roadmap) would add a lot more of personal touch/space.
---
You mean I should definitely go for proposed changes?
---
Well in my opinion it needs to be free to fast travel to the camps that sell stuff in there vendors cause you sell any thing you lose the 10% for selling it in your vendors and where dose it go to nothing you lose it so if you sell stuff for the 10% tax you should be able to fast travel to camps for free
---
Username checks out
---
I’d love if this tied to the faction bases. If we are getting an instanced shack or cellar or bunker, then we could have Motherlode burrow in. Crater, Foundation, the Overseer’s house, and the Rusty Pick all have interior cells that go underground and it would be wonderful to just burrow there. The selections for where Motherlode pops up do save a bit on fast travel costs around the map, but they aren’t exactly convenient. Tying your camp to each of the highly trafficked bases would be very nice.
---
I have honestly thought about spending my CAMP budget to make a maze for people (similar to the maze in that parking lot in Fallout 4 - I cannot remember the name). I could set up traps in certain parts of the maze. If the person makes it to the center, there will be a vender machine with free stuff on it.
---
Yeah I don't even stress about visiting those crazy cantilever-over-a-damn-cliff vendors anymore, I used to avoid them like the plague!
---
Don't know if i fancy whole wood. Might swing by for a bag of splinters.
---
All aboard the metro exodus train...choo choo.
---
Who's moronic idea was to to charge to fast travel?    
---
Does the Pipboy EAT the caps? Does some vendor with magical transporation powers you NEVER see show up take the fee and POOF? So stupid.
---
I think it has to do with the weight reduction legandaries/backpacks. Ever since I got the chem reduction backpack, it's been happening to me rather often.
---
Single action revolver or shotty?
---
You can rent a room at Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast...
---
It has no mods
---
Damn. Ok well thanks for the help guys. I find it's great in VATS and smokes most things in one shot!
---
Combat outpost: Point of interest in each region that settlers and raiders try to take over that starts one of the following events:
---
1. Vantage point: event starts by choosing sides (settlers/raiders). Help your side to fight and claim the empty location, only assigned weapons are usable in the event and pvp is enable. The side that wins claims the location.
---
(The location has to be unclaimed to start this event)
---
2. Hostile takeover: same as above but one party will be defending and one party will be the attacker. (The location has to belong to a faction to start this event)
---
3. Defend xxx: defend the place from random waves of enemies and spawns a mini boss at the end. Failing the event will result the faction to abandon the location (it will become unclaimed).
---
Reputation will be given as rewards, raiders/settlers will spawn more frequently in that region of the point of interest under their control. 
---
That’s my idea for this.
---
It has a bladed tip mod
---
There are and have been quite a few free items added before, this could be no different.
---
Bloodied 3 🌟 Fat Man
---
Yea but it is still useless better of getting a chainsaw or a ripper
---
Single action revolver.
---
You can repair things, its all still there just broken.
---
You can repair all at the camp module if you have everything.
---
Use nukes and dragons for build planning
---
100 scrip gets you a three star weapon, so you should get a 3*
---
The fast travel cost is ridiculous anyway. Thematically it makes absolutely no sense. 
---
There’s no way a fast travel cost of say 30 caps is my fella buying vital supplies on his journey. I can even buy some fancy lad snack cakes for that cost, let alone a decent meal. 
---
Unless of course the cost represents a estimated number of glitches you would encounter if you walked, you then pay that number back in caps to avoid. That would be fairly in line with Bethesda’s business model.
---
It also overrides bird bones.
---
Some of the weapons are a little lacking I agree. The camp items and PA skins seems to be the focus Atom Shop, and that kind of makes sense. As you pointed out you can barely even notice when someone has a weapon skin, but their camps and PA really stand out. Good weapon skins to show up every now and again though.
---
Get rid of the shotgun stuff and only 3 endurance for fireproof
---
Agreed, same thing with foundation, crater, and the overseers house
---
Yeah after 50, the numbers are meaningless for levels and you can only swap out Special points and collect cards. If they souped themselves up as a bullet sponge with some legendary armour and weapons and you didn't, then there's the difference.
---
At the end of the day, we're all still Level 50s.
---
i tried pumping up grim sprint today and i couldnt keep up activating criticals every 1-2 seconds This is awesome!
---
I just want to know who were supposedly paying all this money to.
---
Here is a good post to read all about the *advertised* bonuses of FO1st
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gnb6zv/can_we_get_serious_here_for_a_moment_bethesda/
---
19%, energency protocols inly triggers under 20%.
---
So do the Nerd Rage perk.
---
It is purely a gag weapon and I fucking hate it
---
funny enough, i underestimated bandolier as i thought bullets weigh so less even when carrying a couple thousand rounds. I tried switching travelling pharma to bandolier today and huzzah! carry weight from 300/350 to 165/350
---
Just found out all the Fancy Pumps are the same 3 star drops. 50% DR while aim; 50% limb damage; 50% ignore target armor.
---
You realize the vault's oxygen was turned off after it was sealed, right?
---
From what it says on the roadmap, we will be getting instanced camps or something of the sort so I assume indoor places kind of like how Elder scrolls online is.
---
Not so much swimming in caps, but been playing since beta lol
---
My PSN is HereComesAGoose
---
Man, I hear ya, but until we get half-size foundations it’s the best you can do sometimes
---
It’s impossible. Best of luck.
---
We stock both, you’re in luck!
---
I'd rather get rid of rifle - shotgun is just too good for critting and crippling. Rejuvenated is underrated, 50 ap regen is massive
---
Did have some 3-star fat men (mans?) a while back, but it was junk like Suppressor’s, so they went to friends as jokes or just the scrip machine
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=69845ae&amp;d=sd0sg2so0sp0pd0pk0pp2pl0es2ek1eh2c72ic4a02a72as0a32l12lr2lv2l71lt2p02&amp;m=51a&amp;am=1625-1620-1622-1621-1626&amp;wp=w9w5&amp;wm=1b2430-1b24&amp;ad=158a7
---
All you really have to do is put 2 floor tiles in front on the building and THEN put the stairs. That way it'll look way more natural and realistic.
---
Oddly enough if I recall correctly I've got a Bloodied or Junkies Fat Man can't remember the effects
---
Ah right on. I imagine the revolvers are all one star with Bloodied then. 3 star would have been nice at least.
---
I feel like that's what the locked off white spring houses are going to be.
---
Pastor's Vestments count for responder gear for the daily.
---
Not sure why, but its what I use.
---
Hey what platform are you on? Might buy a couple thing I'm PS4 btw
---
Watch captainoobs video
---
PC unfortunately, sorry
---
Yeah, always ‘wondered’ why I couldn’t move into one of those nice, secure bunkers that no one was around to use any more! Would certainly be something I’d get as a mod in an offline game. If they add instanced camps, I’d love to see one added.
---
Not at all.
---
Oh that's a shame anyway good luck with your shop :)
---
Why would you think that's weird?
---
Yeah, if you log out inside a PA, sometimes you make a core. I do not know why and how... but my stash is full of cores and I carry like 100... 
---
I do not use gatling lasers... yet... but I think I should search for one, lol :)
---
Normally, yes, I’m all on board with keeping it more natural looking, but this spot in particular has weird constraints, particularly when I decided it’d look cool to put the shop kinda propped up by the truck that’s under it
---
Its a mmo its common.
---
I keep one on display &amp; any others that drop I can move for around 12k caps.
---
Sometimes it is hard to know how people react towards certain things. So I don't know if it is actually weird or not. I am curious what people think about it.
---
Thanks! May your country roads always take you home!
---
It’s 2020 do whatever you want, nothing to be ashamed of
---
If you see a female character and legitimately believe it's a female then that's weird. Make no assumptions and then some gruff voice over the mike won't shock you.
---
Is that the only mod available though?
---
Very helpful, thank you. And what 'attribute' is that? Bug in VATS?
---
Well, it does not have to take place in the center of the town. They could set it up so that the attack happens along a part of the town that is rarely used and you have to fight off the invaders to prevent them from entering the town.
---
I think so its the only one ive gotten after 100s of drills were scrapped
---
Hmm... That does suck. Granted, I've gone at least 20 scraps of a weapon before getting a new mod. I just want a Laser Rifle Stabilized Stock.... Is that too much to ask?
---
Its the 50% limb damage that causes the extra damage in VATS
---
I'm only a couple days away from getting the jetpack, but I've got a build that can survive a jump from the New River gorge bridge. Bird bones, marsupial, goat legs level two, and three armor pieces with a fall damage reduction.
---
The population is nice, but it’s also the wasteland where anything can happen.
---
And repair it in half an hour
---
You on ps4 if so I can mod your rifle for ya i believe I have that stock
---
I feel like this post is directed at me
---
No. Xbox One.
---
The fake responder girl didnt even try to bury Dassa properly &gt;:(
---
You sure? I can't see well at night. Maybe your brightness is too high?  
---
Also if you ever been to the wilderness at night, where there's no city or town nearby, you would be surprised how bright night can be.
---
He's talking about the dead rotting bodies of the people that died to the sorched plague
---
Black widow perk. Always played as a woman in any fallout series. It’s just too powerful.  FO76 doesn’t have it but it was still habit and I rolled female.  I wore that red sequin dress for ages too. Badass when you are wrecking things in evening wear.
---
Depends on the genre for myself if it’s a story heavy game with choices like mass effect I play a male character so I can project myself more onto them, if it’s a game like 76 where my character is voiceless (or basically faceless) and I’ll be putting in many hours I find it preferable to play as a female also I don’t wear anything slutty as you say haha swimwear in 76 isn’t all that attractive anyways. For the few people I’ve spoken to over the mic none seemed surprised I was a guy.
---
Nah, this post is me trying to decide whether to use a mic or not. I just don't want to make things awkward towards other people.
---
Do they stack
---
Yes. I'm having the same problem right now.
---
Found a backpack loaded with almost all the mounted head plans today. Dropped the excess plans for another to enjoy.
---
As long as you give those level 50s whatever legs you get from the sheepsquatch, sure.
---
So? Earth got more lmao. Also when there’s a will, there’s a damn way.
---
Yes, they do.
---
I can build a fusion generator, I think I could get some ventilation fans and water pumps going? They could make a whole quest out of it.
---
I would do 8t just to be safe. You never know at this point.
---
I am gonna start gambling with my friends for caps in with serendipity
---
If the event scorchbeasts ignored my camp, i would have left mine at the fort defiance lead deposit. I started feeling guilty towards the participants of line in the sand
---
The use of the words “Trap House” so much In this sub makes me giggle.
---
I would definitely go for blocker rather than barbarian, especially if you plan to acquire a secret service suit.  The percentage based defense is always much, much better than DR.  After about 300 DR, you don’t gain much from higher numbers.  Serendipity is another great defensive perk if you go low health, and Dodgy is very good if you use an unyielding set and have a deep AP pool.
---
I personally use endurance as a dump stat and use aquaboy to minimize rad intake, but if you can fit lifegiver into your build, may as well.
---
You don’t really need a full adrenaline card with a bloody rifleman or commando.  I use one rank, but I’m blowing almost everything away in one hit anyways.  5 ranks will allow you to one shot scorchbeasts with a full stack, so it’s not without merit.  If you like VATS, gun fu is good.
---
Really, you want to maximize damage, have solid defense, and avoid wasting perks on QoL stuff if possible.  You can probably squeeze in Thru Hiker, but it’s up to you.  Food is everywhere, so I don’t bother hoarding it.
---
Super duper has no effect when crafting legendaries. The perk sounds sometime as if it was triggered but you never get two armor pieces, only one.
---
It's not weird at all.. All the people I play with most are males playing females.. I am the only true female playing female in my group..  Play however you want!! Game on!!
---
I would love this and other basic commands like, look there, stop, go, ready, not ready.  I wish they would make something useful for people that don’t often use microphones especially since there is no chat.
---
Had a two shot caster at one point but was stupid and in my spam scripting lost it 
---
Well after trying to get another good two shot or something like that I got a bloodied one 
---
Only down side is I hate bloody builds wish I could of sold it.
---
And you got the achievement for being in the blast zone when the nuke landed :)
---
as someone with butcher's bounty i'd love to have this service around
---
That would be cool. Why would someone downvote you for that?
---
Oh come on. Camp destruction is part of the fun, especially when a person for whatever reason engages you at their camp. It’s a wasteland, y’all gotta stop turning it into some pacifist utopia lol.
---
It’s already been neutered enough. Leave it be.
---
I only roll excavator for the carryweight bonuses. I have an ultracite in inventory as well (got it unintentionally for free thanks to shitty code and lag, was actually raider pa i found in the wild)
---
You can use The Motherload for free fast travel 😎 and your base and Vault 76
---
I wonder if people asking for paid content wants F76/beth to fail? Or have they forgotten the backlash when utility items and 1st sub came out. To be fair OP didn't ask to buy it though.
---
2525?
---
Just get two pieces with acrobatics on them
---
Yeah, not everybody likes the pitch black experience. I personally love dark nights but early on when you haven't gotten all the equipment to work around it... it's a pain
---
Graft on Steel Workshop
---
I need that too send me your psn and I will add you next time I'm on
---
I got tricked into pvp a while back at grafton steel. I was using the Tesla rifle to kill the mirelurks for the defend mission and then a guy walked in front of my shots. He was cool at first, we traded (which now I can clearly see was to see what junk I had and if it was worth it) then he backed out and killed me almost instantly with a 50 cal machine gun. 
---
I lost so much junk I collected. About 500 plastic and 100 ballistic fiber if I can remember. From now on I claim a workshop then dont do the defend mission because I dont want to get killed and lose all my earnt junk.
---
How can you make 2000 per week? I thought you could only get 200/day from notes and 300/week from Smiley (1700 total).
---
I think the plan was only dropping from the Treasure Hunt event with the mole miners. Anyway I have it and I often craft a bunch of outfits to sell to the robot vendor @30 and quickly reach my 1400 daily caps.
---
the motion blur makes it more funny
---
Just seen you posted it will add you later
---
That is true, he could mean just a free flag but that isn't usually Bethesda's style with most objects.
---
I seriously heard trumps voice in my head when I read “it’s gonna be great”
---
Just adding Text-Chat. Voila, every „Emoji“-Problem solved.
---
I'll gladly pay for them, PSN: Gadawg.cmour
---
I never meant it to be a shitpost from the start but as you’re writing you do begin to get more and more annoyed about the current situation the more and more you think and write about it.
---
However, in contrast to a lot of the posts that rip Bethesda a new one, this really isn’t half as bad.
---
Why do enemies only target crops? My croos have more defence around them than my actual house and shop.
---
Ya there’s a “repair all” option in your little camp box. You’ll just need some scrap to fix it
---
All I have seen that could be called offical is this saying the 30th. https://twitter.com/jg93/status/1273957170900619264?s=19
---
I don't really care if my camp is destroyed. Just repair it with scrap that can be easily farmed in the game. But I'd say that the majority of players want to see it gone. 
---
Also, the "it's a Wasteland" argument is getting pretty old. The majority of players clearly don't want to be dragged into PvP that they weren't expecting or prepared for. 
---
For those who want PvP - let them have at it. For those who don't - keep them out. 
---
But I also understand keen PvPers being pissed at Bethesda for the upcoming patch. It's going to be the nail in the coffin for PvP. 
---
Just trying to come up with a happy middle ground.
---
Merry me 🥰
---
I'm level 303 , hope this will convince you. 
---
And I'll give You a bloodied handmade as an engagement ring 😜
---
#allpowerarmormatters.
---
Ign Gaeus! I'd like to take a look =D
---
I didn’t even think about that, having a noob tube on an assault rifle would be so much fun
---
That's always the risk in workshops. They are PvP areas. 
---
Always crouch and stash your junk often.
---
I’d love something like the Overseer’s home. That felt right. Almost like the home from Vault 76, only less cold - it‘s cozier.
---
in videogames; genre is fluid.
---
idk why you have to pay for fast travel anyways...who are you paying and why? It's pretty stupid.
---
I think the reason it’s set brighter in 76 is because there are too many cliffs in game. People would die too much.
---
Events/places with lots of enemies. Loot all the bodies for weapons. Equip scrapper perk. Destroy all the weapons.
---
I haven't a clue where you are on about but this is so cool
---
Motorcycle won't happen, because consoles can't handle it(unless they abandon this gen and move to next, which would be a dick move).
---
Amazing idea, straight to the point, and written so it’s very understandable. I agree 100%
---
uranium fever event. make sure you get at least one hit on most enemies with shotgun or any weapon, then collect everything after the event is finished, scrapper perk -&gt; 400-600+ steel
---
if you have lots of acid lucky hole mine with excavator suit -&gt; 1000+ steel
---
if you have lots of caps: buying bulk steel at robot vendors (if u have lots of lead but no steel to craft ammo eg)
---
People will always assume you are a man.

I have a feminine gamertag, a female character, and a selfie of me as my gamerpic and people STILL act surprised when I start talking like "OMG A GIRL GAMER". They most of the time assume I'm a dude on his girlfriends profile but surprise surprise I'm a chick and so is my partner lmfao
---
I heard it was giving 100% bonus damage before, now it's 60%.
---
Now us PS4 folks need a wood baron of our own.
---
My max budget camp with an acid and lead node.[.](https://imgur.com/UPHQmHF)

Anywhere with super mutants, scorched or miners will be profitable when weapons are destroyed with scrapper perk. 
---
I like Welch, West-Tek or near Top of the World.
---
If only they could fix skyrims major horse bugs and port mounts in. Doesnt have to be horses as the lore is iffy and such. But mutated mounts could be quite cool and less janky than mortar driven stufd.
---
Question... What would you want for that two shot FFR gamma gun? Caps, trades, or...? (I am PC to btw)
---
Have a great night bud!
---
at one time in the past the weapon damage increased as a weapon was over 100% repaired, i read stories of viable whitesprings runs with a fully repaired, modded drill. good ol times
---
That’s 60% of the extra damage right? Not the base damage? Which is 20%? That’s what I was told and that it wouldn’t add much I’m trying to see if it’s true! That doesn’t seem like a HUGE nerf
---
I have totally thought the same thing! It is seriously lame to wait for events to spawn to leave them to just get where I want to go for free.
---
You a girl gamer??!11!
---
I play both genders, just to switch things up, but don't use mic. If I did though, I'd just say I used to be a dude, but swimming in irradiated water for so long, this dude looks like a lady.
---
You're missing out on an insane amount of damage speccing into two different weapon types.
---
Nope. Nothing to see here. Move along now. 🤫🤫🤫
---
Haha, sorry for laughing. Sounded like my super lvl 35 a few months ago logging at my camp in ruins. 
---
Was it near Morgantown?
---
check out the random travelling settlervendor at tanagra town (usually spawns in the small house with the sleeping bags near the bus stop)
---
i got mine here finally and another one for a fren at another encounter here
---
I’ve always envisioned an NCR veteran ranger riding a deathclaw into battle against the Legion right at the climax of TF2’s “The Calm”.
---
It's 60% of the 20% explosive damage. Its really not that great
---
I still need to do the challenge, I also do not mind paying for them. Psn: gerra011
---
That kinda sucks ass 😒
---
I thought it was the opposite maybe!
---
If you want to use it only put in 1 or 2 points. That's the sweet spot, 5 points of it is kind worthless imo
---
What you got to trade?
---
Aww I see! If I get my pump to do “I think 148” what do you think 2 points would put it up too?
---

---
It's hard to say without having the gun. But you can put everything in there and see the damage differences
---
can't see how. maxing weapon damage perks is very inefficient - triple the cost for another 30%. skeet shooter feels redundant - on shotgun optimal range I get at least 75% accuracy to head. everything else is in build - bloody mess, better criticals and gun-fu+adrenaline. Taking covert operative is going into stealth archer territory, nerd rage is just a big NO. Junkie build is strong af on its' own, no need to inflate it even more.
---
It’s actually extremely easy to swim in caps if you pay enough and it all depends on what you do. Btw you definitely need mules thou
---
this bug reliably happens if i am waiting in sneak for a fren to fasttravel in to get loot as well. after 1,2 minutes they just keel over and die. mostly scorched for me tho as i think more about it...
---
Cool! Thank you! And grendeier isn’t for explosive bullets is it? Only grenades? Last question lol
---
Ultracite has a respectable amount of skins and a variation of its own known as the Strangler Heart Power Armour
---
Hahah nice
---
Some people say it works others say it doesn't. I for one havnt found it to work.
---
Now I'll have Aerosmith stuck in my head all day.
---
Yeah its diminished returns after the first rank but thats still a whopping 30% damage youre missing out on. You're dealing "okay" damage with two different weapons where you could be dealing a shit ton of damage with one weapon. If that's how you like playing thats cool and all, but you'll never hit as hard as a build dedicated to one weapon type.
---
It’s really easy... on your decent about 15 feet from the floor start using your jet pack and you will still land but you will fall slow enough that you won’t take any damage. A very limited amount of skill is all it takes guys come on.
---
Ok I’ll prob leave it alone then, thank you!
---
birdbones and 50% reduction on armor (x2) does work, all others do not really help because you will still die instantly  whatever the falldamage/healthbar once you drop from a certain height.
---
the fallspeed seems not to influence the falldamage. only the falling height i presume.
---
I dont mind giving you a hand will add you later
---
Super mutants are great for this as they drop Combat rifles that give 19 Steel with Scrapper perk.
---
u/CrazyOO1 wanna test this?
---
If one-shotting a charred feral is "okay" then shit ton is just isn't fun.
---
West tek, uranium fever. You can nuke tanagra town too and keep hitting the ultracite nodes in the cave, it’ll just keep respawning scorched.
---
I've done a few lately where the grove has been the meeting point. It's quite cool as all the minions seem to spawn in the grove rather than magically appearing out of thin air but you're right, most want a chance at the wendigo. Also, no matter where it happens there's always  going to be tents.
---
that would also be a fun addition. stomping scorched and bonus points for revivals/and holding :)
---
Yeh it struggles to load when I’m sprinting around. If we had motorcycles, the draw distance couldn’t handle it and it’d be like playing Vice City again with building popping out of nowhere and enemies suddenly speaking directly in front of you.
---
I think I have one but I’ll have to check tomorrow
---
I don't think there is a gatling gun paint? There's a minigun paint that is a NW reward.
---
Yes!! A guy running under the map running fast with a motorcycle on his head 😂. And also they could sell skins for a lot of atoms. I would also add 4x4 vehicles, skates, bikes, horses and dragons
---
Damn dude. You could throw a woodstock festival with your wood stock. 10/10 would stalk your wood shop again.
---
Dont have to worry about that. Infinite stash
---
I am a new customer? Games not dying
---
Oh I love it, I can just hear them now!
---
"Bringitt then mate oilll fuck you up!"
---
If it works like that whit harpoon it should do the Same whit a shotgun , as long all bullets hit at same time probably
---
God now I miss my deathclaw inspired camp that was next to the Deathclaw Island, I sold Deathclaw eggs as a novelty item to wandering individuals. Would make deathclaw wellingham to those that would help me out, had a pet deathclaw and had many deathclaw related decorations all around the camp.
---
there are no arrow plans there are full modifications that give you the desired effect of say explosion or fire or poison whatever. But you just made Gerald's for the ball with doesn't have any special plans
---
I carry one on my heavy gunner in order to save ammo. Even with no shotgun perks I'm one shotting max level mutants, scorched and ghouls as long as I use vats.
---
I rarely bother with a mic and have only used it a few times when trading. I have an embarrassingly large amount of hours into this game.
---
All content can be done solo though some is quite difficult ... but the best thing is that most events are more easily completed with help. That help can be fairly unobtrusive and....abstract. It doesn't have to be in-your-face. On ps4 it is quite neighborly.
---
Thanks for the feedback! It does seem as if the explosive bait is the most logical option after seeing other posts describing similar encounters. At least this is the first time other players have destroyed my C.A.M.P. in over 1000 hours of play.
---
Then we'll have bag-baiting PvP.
---
&gt;	I feel comfortable saying that I have the most comprehensive inventory in Appalachia.
---
It's safe to say if he don't got it, the next man ain't got shit.
---
Well, in the roadmap they do say that there are going to be instanced camp interiors
---
It's probably not possible simply due to engine limitations. Fallout 4 mods that tried alternate ammo types on the go or those kinds of attachment "weapons" had to go through a whole heap of workarounds taped together with spit and toilet paper
---
DR/ER isn’t really important, buffs/perks/aid are what matters, as does the right gear. Level wise, if you have a build planned, you can be an absolute beast as soon as you hit level 50. Vats is busted in pvp for almost every weapon, it’ll show you doing damage, but nothing is actually happening on the other end. Railways, gamma guns, and explosive lasers are the only things that currently work 100% in vats. You on Xbox?
---
I specified that the BoS doesn’t know about the enclave specifically. Come on now😂😂😂
---
I disagree with your statement that the brotherhood doesn’t have a grudge against the enclave. They do, they just don’t know it.
---
I’ll try and simplify what I meant.
---
BoS is anti American government 
---
Enclave claims to be the remnants of the American government
---
Bringing up that not everyone in the government knew about the secret shadow government isn’t really relevant. 
---
So, if the factions interact, they would probably be hostile to one another.
---
Think about it
---
Ohh okay how much would it cost I’m assuming a lot but if your just charging materials I will have enough
---
Yeah I’m on PS4 and Ohh okay how much would it cost I’m assuming a lot but if your just charging materials I will have enough
---
There is no bos gattling gun paint, there is one for the mini gun however. Unlocked at level 30 something of nw
---
I'd paint your pa but am on xbox unfortunately
---
Thata a pretty cool one.i got a couple as well but not as well timed.
---
You can hop from a military outpost/base to another, theres a few next to each other in the zone where the Queen spawns. That's my farming route and honestly it always paid well.  
---
Start from the one near Harpers Ferry (the most nearest) then move your way down (theres a few around for defiance as well). You can recognize them because the icon is a circle with a military star in it. That means it's an Army outpost and usually they have power armors, plans, ammo and stuff. In no time you can farm them, then server hop and do it again.  
---
Good luck :)
---
Text....chat
---
That's odd, it usually comes up with a warning "you have loaded into a nuke zone". Sucks your camp got damaged though, if you go to the little camp machine you can select to repair all rather than have to go round fixing everything individually.
---
Did you atleast get the achievement for being at the epicentre of a blast ? :)
---
Leave event, run in front of person shooting, get hit, kill them, problem solved 😂
---
And how are we supposed to have a cap sink?
---
The market shouldn't be a determining factor for them adding or removing content from the game. Not only is it already fucked beyond any hope of repair, but it's something that very minutely affects gameplay for the average player. The big boy traders with 10 mules full of duped unyielding sentinel gear and bloodied explosive guns will always find a way to trade something else, so it quite frankly doesn't matter how bethesda tries to regulate the economy.
---
With that said, bethesda themselves said they will add them back after temporary removal for changes. That was nearly 18 full months ago so clearly they don't plan on keeping their word. Explosive energy weapons are completely untouched since they were removed, they're still horrendously bugged and none of the future changes (explosive damage, energy armor penetration) have been applied to them. I don't care about their status as "legacy" as the traders hyped them up to be, nor do I care about their value, I just want them to fucking fix it. These things are laughably broken in so many ways. They promised us a fix, so they should give us a fix. If that means nerfing them before adding them back to the pool, that's more than justified, but as an owner of an explosive gatling plasma I got as a drop, I can tell you the current state of explosive energy guns is absolute cancer for everybody involved
---
Honestly legacy weapons shouldn't be a thing and should be removed.
---
Off topic but damn that's a good roll on your gauss shotty.
---
Nah, that will force tons of people to stop playing
---
I was about to ask if this post is sarcastic, but seeing what other subs you're used to, this may very well seem chill. This is also one of the better times because there's a massive content drought, believe it or not we used to get semi-frequent updates at this time last year. Once every two weeks even! Then once they delayed wastelanders we basically got nothing until then, maybe a half-assed patch for a couple small things once a month. And now they are back to that same half-assed once a month patch schedule, so the only people sticking around are the ones enjoying a more steady gameplay. I can promise you things will get a lot more heated once the next major update drops and everybody is realizing how many things are still broken or complaining about whatever the next update will inevitably break
---
Why can't you? Clearly that's what the original developers wanted T-51 to look like.
---
This sub is chill if you only state the hivemind opinion and ask for more atom shop emotes
---
Also do you have the perks for it go make it have super durability? Just as that’s why I was trying to get a hold of the plans instead of just finding parts of it
---
Same here as well, it takes some practice but you should be able to jump off anywhere and land safely, try moving forward at the same time and counter thusting on the way down.
---
Would be more inclined to do something with it if they would just let us buy the friggin mods for caps. 2/3 of the mods I'm still missing because queen bitch keeps dropping jetpacks and other parts.
---
Cant tell if sarcasm or not...
---
Agreed. Every - single - word.  
---
Lets hope, with upcoming one wasteland and combat balancing, they adress these issues.
---
I’ve never understood the legacy obsession. I have several bloodied and junkies explosive lasers but I dont use them because their power is is so extreme that I kill myself when an opponent gets near. I wouldnt trade a good handmade or fixer for a legacy laser. They are great PvP weapons, but I get attacked once in a month so its not worth carrying them IMHO.
---
Your slogon should be "Got Wood?"
---
the boring loops are starting to have the opposite effect: I'm no longer a daily player and it feels liberating. Haven't played for three days and I don't feel like I'm missing anything.
---
You can no longer get it. Used to get it from completing the vault raid on standered but they took that down. Not sure if it's tradable either
---
When I first started playing 76 my friends stocked up on explosive ammo and guns for me to use when I got high enough. Broke everything in about 30mins. I wanted to be the master blaster and ended up a sad panda.
---
And your vending machines
---
I like how people say last couple of years as if this is something new. Bethesda has been releasing broken games for over a decade now. The problem is that people keep buying new ones, expecting them to be any different. I set my expectations low for all of their games, and I'm never disappointed. The times when they actually manage to come out with something really neat is just a bonus.
---
I know, but better than not stacking at all
---
Oh, we do!  They're just in the form of Gauss Miniguns, Gauss Shotguns and SS armor pieces.
---
Not sure if this applies to you, but I've had friends that didn't play on Saturday when Smiley resets, and they were unable to buy gold from him the entire rest of the week. Two people on two different Saturdays. Neither one has missed a Saturday since.
---
This. I don't think every weapon should be balanced across the board. A baseball bat shouldn't be as effective as a super sledge, there should always be tiers.
---
The minigun paint is a NW reward so the person having the paint wouldn’t be able to give you the minigun back
---
I really wish that was a more viable weapon... I've got a two-shot mirv named "exterminatus.". It's a blast to play with...but just not very good at actually killing things.
---
To be frank, this build is severely under-optimized as others have said; the inclusion of things like Chem Fiend and Rejuvenated, not fully speccing into one weapon type, having Starched Genes but no Class Freak leads me to rate this a four at best. Others have pointed out your weaknesses here but you seem unwilling to actually change your build so I don't see the point of this post.
---
Yes it does, I tested it multiple times jumping off a mountain, it just takes practice
---
Y'all PC nerds guys stop learning on that like a crutch. Nobody else wants it.
---
One shotting a charred feral? I was under the impression any build could do that to be completely honest lmao they aren't tough... like... at all...
---
Grenadier works for ballistic weapons with the Explosive legendary trait. Do not apply it to your shotgun. Trust me. You'll end up killing yourself all the damned time.
---
You need to bring the windex and lemon pledge from home.
---
Yeah, same. You'd think a miniature *nuclear explosion* would be useful, from a realistic and gameplay standpoint.
---
There were constant complaints about two shot explosive griefing so they nerfed it. Then they got constant complains about the nerf.
---
Bethesda can't really do anything right it seems.
---
Oh shit thanks brodie!
---
Yeah i think i got super lucky to get the queen in the photo too aha
---
I feel like no matter what way they go about that at least SOME ppl will complain, but I feel like they didn’t have to nerf it this much
---
Turn the Brahmin's pacifist mode on.
---
If you put scarecrows, the enemies will aggro on them instead.
---
If you are doing an event with lots of people, consider using a Tesla rifle. It will allow you to "tag" a lot of enemies quickly, so you can loot them afterwards. Supermutants are best. Scorched and mole miners are good too.
---
:0 I didn't know that. What happens after its destroyed? Do they then attack crops?
---
I very, very,  dry rarely see Morgantown nuked, so you *should* be fine there still. I am sorry about your pet, though.
---
Nic etypo 🤣
---
Well the build on my other char doesn't even have the weapon damage perks and bloody mess - and it still oneshots level 68 enemies. This time I'm using more fitting perks - and I make short work of the same enemies... with level 30 non-legendary guns. Like, come on, that's way too much damage, think about utility and quality of life for a second! We don't have any enemies for that much damage IN THE WHOLE GAME! 2-3 people with bloodied builds can carry the SBQ with relative ease, that's just broken.
---
What do you think women did before games had female characters?
---
Sorchbeast meat is so heavy. I drop or eat it raw it if the vendors are out of caps. Lol
---
I think if you're in a team you'll also get the drop.
---
well, no? Look at most of players at SBQ, can't even fend off the adds.
---
Oh my God, that shop is impressive ahahah, but aside from the wood stuff, a bloodied dragon? WOW, also I effin need that fixer plan :'(
---
😳
---
but notes are incredibly easy to get via events, something most people would rather do than do those dailies again at that point, at least with friendly or neighborly you are getting "something new" to help ease the pain while also feeling like your being rewarded for your effort
---
You need a stimpack by the way.
---
We would think by now everyone would have moved on from the old *neck beard nerd*  cliché, the whole world is online now, there has to be at least a couple of girls in the pack somewhere😘
---
If anything, I think the contrast is funny.
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday. The nuke landed right after the loading screen finished 😂
---
Install a stock with bashing damage. Increases the condition bar the most of all laser mods. your laser will last about 75% longer
---
But when something *does* touch you, you wish you had on SS armor.
---
yes, same situation for me pretty much throughout the evening.

Same as now, make dinner?
---
Well instanced interiors should be coming in a couple months so maybe people will be able to make their own vault apartments wherever you want, this idea is still really cool though.
---
I can confirm for the ally’s daily quest reward as I got a 2* Fixer once.
---
I have two limbs of Unyielding and had intended on getting two more with one piece of Chameleon eventually.  That plan was before I knew about the SS Set.  
---
Good to know about the DR. I have already put two points in Barbarian so I will skip the third and go to blocker.  I used blocker on my Heavy Gunner but this toon already had one point in Barbarian.  
---
I've been watching Angry Turtle's videos and I modified one of his builds.  I'll see how it goes.  RNG was not good to me today.  I farmed around 10 legendaries between Scorched Earth, Uranium Fever, and Monster Mash but struck out on anything useful.  I had to keep one of the heavy guns because I ran out of ammo lol.  Tomorrow will be grinding lead day.
---
Personally I say server hop till it reappears.
---
Once you get used to those unyielding stats, you never want to go without them again.  That's why I cringe every time I have to get into PA or when I need the stealth suit at Radiation Rumble.  My carry weight goes to crap and I end up trying to grab the ore overencumbered and walking at a snails pace LOL.
---
Thanks everyone.  I appreciate the help you've given.
---
like the sentiment but these buffs are crazy strong for something so easily obtainable.
---
just having a bonus 5% XP with any ally would be plenty since it means people can pick who they prefer not what gives the most useful buff.
---
otherwise if the above was used i would immediately switch to commander no questions asked as well as most other folks.
---
again i like the idea but you cant be overkill with buffs, otherwise min-maxers will find whats best and pretty much "force" a meta meaning everyone will be using the exact same ally
---
% damage reduction is multiplitive, not additive. So PA,lone wander and emergency protocols reduce your damage by 76.8%.
---
After that 76.8% reduction your damage reaiatance value is than applied to the remaining incoming damage.
---
The scavenger trader vendor near anchor farm has one for 780 caps, took me 2 server hops to find
---
Depends what level the event is at. The game doesn't encourage you to go to those locations until you're level 20, so they could set enemy levels around the 20-30 range. It would mean the event isn't very challenging for level 50+ players, but I suspect they'd be doing it more for the reputation &amp; treasury notes than any legendary items that might drop.
---
Quick question, how do I do daily’s/ missions to get my rep up for the raiders and stuff? I actually just finished main story missions and need to do those now! Prob a obvious question I’m asking lol
---
It’s gotta be bugged as the other key card is always there (at the location it’s suppose to be). It’s a keycard that suppose to be paired with keycard pair 02. 
---
So I don’t know.
---
srsly? i built a goddamn vault under a bridge, thought vaults were the shit but no a woodshop...

 Did your team mate fall for it?

---
No motor cycles it wouldn't even fit the fallout universe since vehicles in fallout are completely different from the real deal all the way down to the fuel and if I'm not mistaken the bombs disabled all of that stuff
---
Have to disagree with the no dropping aid part and survival mode being shit, PvP has been whack because of the constant aid spamming, people shouldn’t be carrying around hundreds of nukas, stims, stealth boys and chems, it all just contributes to the big cheesy garbagefest that is PvP in its current state. This wouldn’t be a problem so much if duping wasn’t a thing but since it is, dropping aid items is necessary tbh. What we really need is proper weapon balancing and damage caps for each specific kind of weapon, for example, the damage cap on an automatic handmade should be much lower than say a lever action, weapons should be closely matched in DPS to allow flexibility for different builds and playstyles and several weapons just need a flat out nerf like teslas. Stealth boys should be like the NW prototype stealthboys and an easy way to fix the issue of damage bugged legacy weapons is just to make them do no damage to other players, rendering them useless in PvP. VATs and whether to have it enabled for PvP or not is something you typically get a lot of mixed opinions about, personally it’d like it disabled but I understand why some people want it.  I enjoyed survival(until they ruined it) and adventure mode PvP but I feel like Survival has to come back with major adjustments like I mentioned before people take an interest in PvP again.
---
She just hangs around the basement when I go to see Davenport for the daily. Kinda weird there is pretty much no meaningful interaction with her after the main quest lines.
---
Good info.  Thanks.
---
That is beautiful! I'd go camping there, let alone buy wood.
---
I'm always in party chat because the quality is much better. On general we aren't very chatty in the party. I would recommend a mic when you plan to team up, makes communication so much easier. we do the difficult events together but in between we do our individual thing.
---
IMHO, it is difficult to find somebody to loot with because of the different play styles. Some people loot everything and go very slow, other people rush through rooms and loot afterwards. You both need the same speed when clearing rooms.  
---
It is not very easy to lure a builder into PvP but it is doable so the builder you are following will be weary when you are there.  
---
'loose loot': who takes it gets it and it is gone for other players
---
'loot in containers': each player can loot  
---
There aren't many players looking to trash you camp but as mentioned, it is possible.
---
This could be related.  I played but did not purchase gold on the day it should have become available.  I went to buy it a couple days later.
---
Obviously, the buffs could be tweaked.
---
Out of curiosity, what do you find strongest with Sofia? She's not who I would personally use, though. I would be more likely to use Beckett or maybe the Wanderer. Is it the Strength bonus?
---
Danot you EVER disrespect the moth man poster and twin bed.
---
Keep searching until you come across a solo random spawn. Takes awhile.
---
Yeah I've heard it's pretty much down to Sony.
---
PC AND Xbox are gucci.
---
IMHO split the gold, rep farming takes forever while you can get 200 gold per day. 
---
IIRC you get 500 more bullion if you decide to keep the gold, which is only 2.5 days of grind. Reputation is reeeaaaally slow to get to allied (took me about a month), so every little bit helps here.
---
I loved the experiments lol was so funny
---
Sorry to hear about that.  I bet he had a.. blast.. watching it though.  
---
On a side note,  Morgantown is great for cobalt flux.  So it could be someone lowish needing to stock up on that for something they're building.
---
I really want them to release a gas mask bundle. Maybe a couple new models and some cool redskins.
---
Dont fall for it! We all know its no such thing!!!
---
Pfft. It's mine. All mine. I did all the work. Only one that even helped me in 79 was RaRa. The rest didn't do shit.
---
It didn’t get moved to the other vendor with the rest of the 94 loot?
---
Uuuuugh yea that damn projection light, I've tried all the tips people suggest and it doesn't work. I made a whole new camp recently and placed one down Boom work! So happy. Came back later never worked again since..... Its so annoying because its such a cool light when it works. =(((
---
Nope it is now legacy, along with the green strangler icon, the flag pose, and the emote
---
You can't just add the numbers/percentages, that's not how it works. You can look up the actual formulas [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance), including a nice table how DR scales against different damage numbers. If you are hit by a very low damage weapon you may get a reduction around 90%, but you will never be immune.
---
Awesome, thanks
---
I fart in his general direction.
---
Would be nice to have a few brightness settings in game
---
 You can build a bike on 7 days to die on Xbox and it handles it pretty well,  and the map size is about on par with the 76 map size.
---
I'd rather they add some new displays all together, but ye cleaner options would be nice. That white display cabin that you can't use should be added as one too.
---
New player here.
---
What are legacy explosive weapons?
---
Heck what are legacy weapons?
---
 I'd also love a two shot gatling gun if anyone has one

I wish they'd fix the light effect on the fire barrel /trash can too! Why is a fire casting out bright white light?!?
---
Problem is most peoples build is terrible and they don't want to "waste" stimpaks.
---
But even long distance running can cause textures and structures not to load properly, and insert Speed Demon to that run and it will happen at some point.
---
Don't you worry, they are saving all the good stuff for when seasons release, there will be little free atoms with seasons and the prices of atom items will go up, same for the quality. Feel free to quote me on this when it happens.
---
I believe it resets for everybody at 8:00 pm Eastern on Saturdays. The group I play with all completed the vault raid on different days, and purchased from Smiley as soon as possible, and we all reset at the same day and time.
---
I use my Final Word to take potshots at her while she's flying, as long as there aren't mobs bouncing me all over the goddamn bog, because I find it's pretty easy to land long-distance hits with the 50 cal MG. And my attention span does not allow that I just kindly wait for the old girl to take her time and find the perfect spot to pop a squat.  
---
Of course, when she does land I unload with the MG42. Lol
---
I despise the Crown store. It's overpriced as fuck for most things. Plus they have cancer boxes. No thanks.  
---
The moment they introduce loot boxes it's the time for me to get the hell out of this game too. It's unethical and damaging to the game. And it's asinine to compare crafting legendary items to loot crates. Seriously, what?
---
Wasn't there a car in one of the original Fallouts? Fallout 2 if I remember correctly.
---
When im at 25k+ i purchase agressotron keycards for the encrypted event. At whitespring station you can buy 2 of them
---
Oh the two shot caster is horrible, it truly shows you how far the shots spread out.
---
Ha ha ha.  That's great.  Come get some be-atch.
---
People are still surprised in 2020? I mean 20/25 years ago it was rarer, but these days?
---
I never did understand why people think it's weird that women play games too, like duh they are fun. Why wouldn't they?
---
Farm West Tek, Super mutants drop lots of lasers, boost intelligence before scrapping the lot of them, you should get a few mods at least after a couple runs.
---
Then there's a good chance you're friends mother also smelled of elderberries 😬
---
And damn I wish 7 Days still had console support. It was awesome.
---
I haven't had any luck myself with this but have you got loads of build limit left at your camp? I think you need a good chunk of space to add them to your camp.
---
I have done all the quests for bullion (both sides until the point of no return) on my 5 characters so I can conclude: NO. Not 1 of the five was able to do it without some bug that made me switch servers.
---
the STR, INT and LCK would be pretty strong in their own right, doubled magazine and bobble heads would be dead simple to buffing the already absurd damage the game already has and the 5% exp would stack with the INT stat buff with which INT if i recall is 3-4% bonus exp per INT.
---
Most of us don't realy care to be honest, I do chuckle to myself when I see a female toon in a game who has a deep james earl jones style voice on chat though.
---
Even raiders aren’t that scummy. Meg would beat your ass lore-wise.
---
Could make a triple barrel shotgun out of that too ha ha 2 shells and a 40mm coming at ya
---
I haven't found West Tek yet, and even then, my last encounter with Super mutants resulted in them being at minimum 30-50 levels (I was level 25) higher than me at that satellite array thst you head to for Rose's quest. If it's anything like that, I'd be doomed.
---
Ah that golden oldie, pretty accurate still today.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5tamj/the_comprehensive_creatureanimal_taming_guide/
---
Only need to use max rank Animal Friend and rank 1 Wasteland Whisperer these days. But my favorite spot for searching is in the top right. There's a pond up there with a crashed Vertibird that can spawn a solo random creature.
---
I should have. Instead I just repaired it all in one go because I'm a builder so of course I have spare scrap (no 1st tho so now I gotta restock) and the shit kid side-kick was obviously irritated. Especially since I kicked my teammate so they couldnt redestroy it. Why are there even little crotch goblins on an M rated game 🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
Someone from higher ups wanted to have it's own *Fartnite* and here we are stuck with this.
---
Overpriced skins? Check.  
---
Silly skins for kids who wants to be OG? Check.
---
I would sub for €5 (it's €14.99 on steam in my region)
---
25% faster fire rate &amp; 25% less vats cost = God Roll
---
There will always be griefers as long as there are people with friends stupid enough to fall for their shit. Chicken or the egg.
---
Yeah it’s a lot more than Roses quest spot lol but West Tek is actually pretty close to that location, the mutants there should scale to your level but I’d advise gaining a few levels before attempting it alone. 
---
Grafton is a nice place for lower level super mutants but you won’t loot as many lasers there.
---
Well a level 95 scorched deathclaw, a level 60 something mirelurk queen and 5 Yao guai is a little different from one level 60 charred ghoul so I dont think that's a fair comparison 🤣🤣🤣
---
Yeah I thought it might just be a patience thing. Thanks!
---
ahaha fuck meg, she dont know what it is to be a true raider 
---
raiders 4 life!!
---
I think so. That's a good tip though - I'll check.
---
Awesome! I'll go scout it out! Thank you!
---
They don't fill up camp budget anymore as I recall.
---
Can you show the decrease for each one separately as well? How much does each decrease the base regen time. 
---
I'm running with core assembly and this has given me a substantial boost in AP regen. Action boy / rejuvenated / lone wanderer were insignificant in comparison... Core assembly feels like 2 pieces of powered legendary armor.
---
Fallout 76 has to be the junkiest game I've ever enjoyed playing. The game has TONS of issues, truly an unlimited amount, I wouldn't want to be in the shoes of the developers.. I get stressed just thinking about it all, but at the very list they should put a priority to the atom shop stuff, we are supporting the game after all, at least I have been subscribed for 4 months now and have also purchased atoms on the side, it sucks to see so many broken store items. The Nuka girl outfit has also been broken since day one, so I have little hope of seeing fixes.
---
I'm level 30 now, so I've got decent Power Armor to help with that. I've been around Grafton and done the quest for the Mayor. I absolutely hate that place. I'll find West Tek after I finish the Brotherhood questline, which should yield some Laser Rifles on its own from quest rewards and corpse loot.
---
More like one scorched champion and a some scorched molerats
---
I don't get why anyone wants pvp on the main game, it's such an unbalanced game with perks that you'd need to build up the perfect character with the perfect loot to stand a chance... Fair enough if you want to but there's a reason other pvp games don't have such overpowered options. Don't see people in COD running around with an explosive plasma rifle and armour you probably can't shoot though all while he's invisible....? Some new game modes like NW would make more sense to me. Level playing field for everyone... I'd get rid of perks there tbh
---
Honestly it's about damn time they actually fix it.  If that's the case then people really need to get their shit together because it's the only thing that has stopped multiple events from failing lately.
---
Really?? I'd best go hunting for pets again then! Gotta admit I've never seen the tame option tho
---
Yea I use a tracking rocket quad launcher on her in air...I will say i have seen people talk about staggering and I remove it before the fight. Once she lands I use a Hunters mini gauss
---
Shit I wish thats what typically spawned for me. On my days off I'll do anywhere from 12-30 queen runs a day and 9 times out of 10 its always a shit ton of big enemies with some blood bugs thrown in for good measure LOL
---
I figured that the bobbleheads were balanced by being a finite, rarer resource. I was also trying to find a reason for the perks that let you find them easier and Collector for x2 duration to be more useful.
---
Maybe she should give +1 Per, Cha, and Luck instead?
---
Damn never played 2 didn't know that  but apparently it's the only one 
---
Either way functioning motorcycles or vehicle would feel so out of place
---
I want a bicycle with a little bell on it.... Ride it into a deathclaws face while it's sleeping &gt;=)
---
I've done quite a few at the grove in the past and had never noticed this before, cool little detail.  Usually so much happening at once that I don't even notice where the enemies are coming from.
---
Other than the few times I've had a mirelurk queen or king materialize out of thin air basically on top of me.   I noticed those times lol.
---
Did you know that they also reduced the time when the game is 'dark' in the past? yes, nights are much shorter, also, try going to the toxic valley at night, there's some glow from the water there that literally makes it as bright as day. Also, go post on the forums and/or use the form over at bethesda, I feedback from reddit goes down the drain, unless the thread blows out of proportion.
---
They should just fix them like they said they were going to originally. Switch them to the new, not-broken explosive effect they put on the Gauss weapons. If that’s not possible, then come up with some unique legendary effect to replace the broken one with, then go ahead and re-add them to the drop pool.
---
the big ones are mostly getting obliterated right away by those who carry the event, and then they proceed to wailing at queen, while all small things are free to harass the 70-80% of players on event.
---
Sometimes my ap spazzes out and it shoots me into space and I just float back down to earth like welp I’m dead now
---
Yeah,  I still play it every now and then.  Just a shame it'll never get updated to the pc version.  😔
---
the only thing weird last night was that I got both Raider Rep Quests in the same night. Went to Crater, received the Rocksy quest as per normal, and a few minutes later when I returned I got the Communication one, even though I hadn't turned in Rocksy's yet. They both worked out normally.
---
First time that's happened to me.
---
I mean.. it probably would've been quicker and easier to change your password than it was to make this post and wait for answers 🤷‍♂️
---
Happens allll the time doesn't it, oops I out ran the matrix better stand still for a minute
---
CAMP braces. 
---
No, they'll forever be there knowing there's nothing you can do, mocking you until you move your CAMP somewhere else only to find the same problem on a different wall.
---
I've never had that problem.  The only times things don't load in for me is when I fast travel to someone's camp then get stick under it.  
---
I'm on Xbox one x if that makes any difference. Not sure if it loads slightly faster than normal xbox one.
---
I changed it right after making the post to be safe, plus I remained logged in the entire time
---
I was specifically alluding to the low effort, often recycled atomic shop items but sure.
---
Updooted, great guide, I don't really have anything to add to it, I think you covered everything. Sadly most of time everyone just congregates in Hab A or B.
---
So what was the point of the post? What would you have done if people unanimously decided that you shouldn't change your password?
---
Lol, no. I'm jumping from monorail and still ok. No bb mutation/acrobat armor. Just press and hold jump button with at least 1/4 ap left before you hit the ground
---
YouTube video. Pointed out a dec twitter saying the next patch will be Tuesday with a screenshot of it
---
I'd rather have a bunker option, if we could build a basement door in camps that leads to a unique player bunker I'd be so happy! Think there was a mod for F4 that added it n it looked SO damn cool!
---
Not enough cap sinks in game tho :&lt;
---
You forgot the fact that their mother was a hamster.
---
I'll do that in a few hours and post what I get. However, I feel you already know the answer.
---
Core assembly is a very obvious and huge difference compared to the other pieces. As a Junkies build, picking core assembly over a QOL such as jetpack is a no brainer.
---
That friggin emote
---
Nope. Reread :)
---
We're getting shelters this winter.
---
My mistake.
---
I'm not sure how ore fits into this but here is a good video about respawns.
---
https://youtu.be/YUGQ0xvqT-0
---
Apparently there's a whole team of 'pvpers'
---
1 of them is looking for taken workshops and attacks the owner, while 3 others travel straight to his camp to level it as soon as the first guy lands his shot.
---
And to whoever downvoted this: may all your legendaries be Exterminators rolling pins.
---
Hamsters are insulted. 😐
---
must've been me
---
Yea now I just stick to the Habitat with the least people. Don’t even care the legendary drop anymore, just want to make sure little clawie don’t die.
---
seems like ur gear is shit
---
You were gifted duped stuf, we're proud of you!
---
Pretty much this. I dont see an issue except for the people who want them and dont have anything close to trade for them.
---
I've seen a few poor souls fall victim to magically appearing kings as they go to loot the queen. RIP free flux.
---
Actually happened to me before once too lol scared the hell outta me, so I changed my Bethesda password and just recently Enabled the  the new 2 Step Authentication that Bethesda came out with.
---
So I am not allowed to be grateful or what?
---
I reckon for Deguerre you should get the boost from playing a holotape game at your CAMP instead!! It'd encourage peeps to play them and push scores. I love that shit! Good idea OP :)
---
That's what I'm running in my Excavator - Junkie's with core assembly, 2x calibrated shocks and internal database :) I'm running at around 50% hp to get an extra boost from adrenal reaction and still have lots of HP to react to large hits.
---
I guess you are, but it kinda spoiled your progression,  maxed out caps, gave you plans others worked their asses for. 
---
Just saying, just saying.
---
I used to run with b25 50cal and shoot her mid-air, but switched to jffr lmg couple months ago. Now I just quickly make a dent in her hp for 1/4-1/3 of the pool when she lands for the first time and chill until others finish her off.
---
If the fight tends to go longer than 3-5 minutes, I just finish her off after she lands again.
---
this is way better than those shops "offering" fastnacht masks for 1000+ caps a piece. i have \~100 in stock and they sit in the shelf like dead meat... guess i´ll take the "tour de suicase" and "donate" them to the public...
---
Yeah, totally lost track of time and thought tomorrow was the 30th. Stupid quarantine...
---
just being curious... do you have MOUNTED BEAVERS for decoration in your shop!? :D
---
This is where paintings and clocks come in handy.
---
Thanks for the guide. Did this once and i got lost in the building, with no idea where and which the habitats were (admittedly i joined mid event)
---
That explosive dragon..is it for trade? If so, what would you like for it
---
Bethesda released an update that removed energy weapons from being able to get the explosive legendary prefix from the game, so any weapon that can't get that prefix is considered legacy.
---
but only once. its rather easy to get this amount of caps together.
---
nobody knows how, it just does.
---
nah, near helveta
---
Yea it takes sometimes to get used to it. There’s actually signs on wall pointing to where the habitat is, look out for those.
---
Wouldnt be an issie but we have limited build soace, severly limited. Asthetics is nearly impossible, at lease for me, every single part of my base has a purpose, except 2 objects which can be removed or swapped.
---
Did you accidentally salvage it?
---
Legacy weapons are certain legendary combos on weapons. Some of them are broken for just being too powerful. 
---
Explosive energy weapons are a big one. Getting hit by a TSE flamer is nearly an instant kill in pvp. 
---
They are still available, but only through trade. They were removed from the game in the sense that they were removed from the loot tables. You can have either a flamer or and explosive weapon, but not an explosive flamer, using the same example from earlier.
---
I used to farm the Charleston Fire Department for lead. There's a gym in there with lots of weights that can be scrapped for about 100 lead at a time. I noticed that I could sometimes go four or five days without it respawning, and sometimes I could come back later that day (on a different server) and it'd be refreshed. 
---
I've heard some people say it's a 24-hour refresh but that doesn't seem to be the case, as I've tried 24-hour intervals on my private world where there's no chance other people could take the loot I'm after and had no luck. I've also heard, which appears to be the more probable but I'm not entirely sure, that it's to do with a loot count, whereby you need to go out and loot, let's say, 200 other items for example, before the stuff prior refreshes. Like a loot-cycle. 
---
You loot a static item (lets say a Teddy Bear for example) and it becomes item No. 1 on the loot cycle. Then you loot something else, and the Teddy Bear is now pushed to item No. 2 on the loot cycle. Then, you loot another item, and the Teddy Bear is pushed to item No. 3. 
---
1, 2, 3, ...... 195, 196, 197, 198, 200.
---
This goes on and on as you loot more stuff, and eventually you loot 197 more things and the Teddy Bear goes from item No. 200, to no longer being on the loot cycle, and it refreshes the item back into the world. 
---
NOTE: The use of 200 items and the Teddy Bear are only examples. I'm not sure how many items are actually in the loot cycle, nor whether this is even the case I'm just going off what I've heard, it might not actually be how it works.
---
I was just talking to todd about this, he punched me in the face and screamed "SKYRIM PS5 WITH BUSTER SWORD DLC!!" Then ran out of the room screaming hysterically "IT JUST WORKS!" over and over...
---
I also consulted my trusty magic 8ball about the situation, outlook not good.
---
I agree.
---
But my Biggest Problem is that the Brotherhood Paint only works on T60.
---
Why no T-51 why no T-45 or a Ultracite Version.
---
Salvage a legendary piece?
---
Explosive meat will break your walls then they'd use it on you.... If someone wants what you got... It's just a matter of when not how.
---
So next time you pick up a desk fan remember people are watching
---
I didnt read all the way. Deleting soon.
---
"Worked their assess" off sounds like jealousy. Why try to guilt trip someone who didn't actually dupe anything themselves?
---
Unyielding ap refresh was the legendary stats, apologies.
---
I failed my reading comprehension check
---
Leave them for us cannibals
---
Technically it was pve since the player got ghouls to do it....
---
I usually run a fairly nice 3 star bloodied combat rifle. Had an overflow of .38 and decided to mod out and use a 1 star bloodied pipe rifle with a hardened receiver.
---
.....It's actually pretty awesome. Fires as fast as I can pull the trigger and hits pretty hard and has low AP vats cost (character build helps too).... I was surprised and have been using it for most things except queens &amp; sheepsquatches.
---
There are plenty other pretty damn powerful guns in possession of lots of players, so I don't think that fixing "magic guns" will lead to spike in event failures. We will just switch to other good or even god-rolled weapons we used prior to the bugged ones. Honestly, I can't even remember when for example scorched earth ended up as a failure and I attended several hundreds of these events since game's release.
---
As I said, it's not a sure fire solution. It's more of a deterrent or at least a delay if you're going to be AFK for just a few mins.
---
One could also PA through the wall.
---
I want the grey wallpaper back, I missed it.. :(
---
lol im sitting on 12k atoms at this point. i guess bethesda doesnt want me to use them.
---
I guess its a game for me now, how many atoms can i accrue before i use some. 
---
they cant even be fucked to do simple black skins or camo skins for all weapons, easy simple shit that lots of people would get. but nope, at this rate we will get a sprinkle pink skin for the broadsider
---
After this post I'm sure the reason he's crying is because he's laughing so hard... way to go in the insults btw... real mature...
---
The treasury notes where in their when I got there, I thought that locations where suppose to be instanced, last time I had turned in notes was yesterday and that was 20.
---
Bloodiee and Junkie are kings in combat. They are broken because they're superior, none of the perks on this build will make your life easier than a player with an optimal build, so utility and quality of life are clearly not your goal. You haven't got any perks related to hunger or thirst, none related to carry weight, none related to radiation management, none related to increased resource collection. So this a combat-focused build, thus its objectively inferior to to the god-tier builds that can solo SBQ and Impostor with ease.
---
You don't want an OP build? Thats fine, you do you. But why ask for it to be rated? It makes it look as if you a) think you have crafted an OP build or b) want to improve upon this design to make it more optimized.
---
A Raider offering to hold a person's burdens..... What could go wrong XD
---
Ps: I'm joking I'm sure your '' decent mutant''
---
I haven't done the encrypted event yet ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ lol
---
Thanks
---
My windows are on the opposite side of my vendors.
---
Good idea
---
Let's be real here, most Public Events are just as boring and repetitive as the new (and old for that matter) dailies. The difference is that I can complete all three dailies for something like 9 notes in the same amount of time it takes to complete one Public Event and maybe start another. Considering most Public Events reward 2-3 and most 4 I'd say it's worth the time to do it, especially if you're already monotonously grinding T. Notes. 
---
The final rank takes more points to max than all the previous levels combined. I don't think it's unreasonable to save a juicy reward like another permanent free fast travel spot for those that put in the effort and completed the grind. If you give it at an earlier rank you have to give something even better at max rank otherwise it would feel even more unrewarding grinding all those points.
---
How much work is required to get that same setup?
---
Appreciate the feedback.
---
I’m new to trading, how could I buy the combat shotgun from you?
---
Yeah, I'd argue the whole Purveyor system is just an in-game loot box, just you actually get a choice of category.
---
The mystery pick is a lootbox in all but name.
---
Not in the next update but it is on the roadmap.
---
its **2020** and this game doesnt have a brightness setting.
---
Same thing happened to me! I kind of wish I had some cute power armour to wear because I learned not to wear my red dress around a bunch of pervy gamers during the Fasnacht event. Sometimes a girl just wants to wear something nice!
---
As you can see in the display case i know some tricks for building unique camps. But a clock and a painting does not fix the issue.
---
I've been buying plans at Whitespring resort. The plans are still expensive while I'm using the hard bargain (rank 2).
---
Thanks.
---
I make a "Find the Object" game in each of my camps. I place a shelving item with the rules and design my camp around leading to it (it's always clearly visible from spawn point and brightly lit). I then have a seat at my tuba and alt-tab into Planet Zoo or some other pause-able game and wait for visitors. My camps are generally elaborate living spaces with plenty of clutter to hide the targets (usually the little cement vault boys or, in the hard-mode one, silver shrouds. I get so much joy out of hosting the silly things.
---
In regards to ores I’ve seen a lot of numbers bandied about, so I don’t know exactly, but it definitely seems to be linked to the number of items you pick up elsewhere in the world. For instance on my private world with just me on it and only doing a quick vendor tidy and collecting some acid and ore, I’ve had it where it’s been days and the ore at hornwright didn’t respawn, but If I’m busy doing things and picking things up it refreshed numerous times per day. 
---
This has since been confirmed by me in other areas, for example farming static plan locations. The shielded lining plan spawn also only respawns after actual activity looting other things in the world regardless of time passed. 
---
I believe this is some rudimentary device by Bethesda to try to stop over farming in short periods of key mats. It works to a degree but I’m sure you could still game it, though I haven’t for instance tried dropping/putting 200 items in a world case and looting them to delve deeper into how it works. 
---
The enemies however, in regard to glassed, should respawn with a server hop.
---
Anyone who initiates PvP, can't see why kids love Cinnamon Toast Crunch.  Garden Statues ass fools.
---
Can confirm this as I've redone taming in the past week. Just don't tame a scorched pet or a glowing one too unless your in the forest area that sees no scorchbeasts.
---
Yeah I could use some wood
---
 Ok.  I did read it right though yeah?  Thanks for clarifying
---
Days Gone called.  They think your idea is great.
---
The only data mine post I caught never presented evidence of being a vendor, did you happen to see a better post?
---
Maybe? I lost my 3\* two shot explosive handmade the other day, tried to pull it out and heard the empty hotbar noise. I 100% did not scrip or sell it, it's just gone... "sorry we don't return items, thanks for your understanding" was all I got from support. Sad times.
---
They posted in one of the "here's out plans" things that they're looking at retooling them to be more useful, but it was a comment, not a post if I recall, so who knows what might happen.
---
The best thing about the Wood Shop is Marianne gets wood with you!
---
Not sure if the lvl requirement of twice it's lvl is a thing anymore as I was able to tame a lvl 91(pre lvl 182) scorched deathclaw up in that spot. Had to find out that they in fact didn't fix scorched pets at all the hard way. Did find a lvl 21 deathclaw in that spot that's my current one right now
---
Yup!
---
If you would read more thoroughly, you'd notice that I'm already running junkie's with addictions that have minimal impact on vats performance. I'm running bloody mess and all essential crit perks, running enforcer for shotgun and tank killer for rifle. There is no worthwhile way (apart from going bloodied and/or stealth sniper) to make it more stronger without going minmaxing.
---
 There are no perks that reliably slow down hunger and thirst, but why do you think I have 8 endurance? I swap in dromedary and slow metabolizer, refill bars from zero with 4 soups and swap them out. As for rejuvenated - I am have a freaking vanguard VATS build, I need all the health and AP regen I can get, grim reaper's sprint isn't that reliable.
---
Carry weight is manageable without those perks, really - slap a 120 weight backpack, put deep pockets on your gear, take only as much ammo and chems you need for your build - you're golden, 130ish out of 325 lbs is quite the buffer, really.
---
So yes, I want people to say that my build is fine - not to tell me it's shit because it's not meta.
---
Their daytime doesn’t sound quite right, but the nighttime is identical to what I experience in game. It’s just like a grim, overcast day. Nothing to do with tv settings as it’s something they adjusted from beta, which had pretty dark nights.
---
Agreed or atleast fix the explosive damage so its on par with other weapons., ya know 25% not 100% damage... they wete renoved from the loot pool for a reason. 
---
If you quit the game because you over paid fornin item that shouldnt be in the game still than byeeeee. Get over yourself.
---
That sucks, they for sure are able to return lost items as they’ve done so before. But I guess I don’t expect much support from them anymore
---
Haha yeah I guess there's some irony in that... It's probably the ones that say they're responders that you gotta look out for though!
---
I have been that poor soul a handful of times over the past year.  Gotta love it when you can't even see the thing because it's standing inside the queens corpse attacking you while you loot. Now the second she dies I make a bee line for the nearest tent to stash that crap, I need my flux more than the 1 star lead pipe she has waiting for me.
---
Thisnis exactly what should be done. Have an upvote
---
‘Look we gave the old, dusty shitty cases opaque glass, and made it impossible to put anything in the snazzy, shiny display case. What more do you want from us?’
---
The thing with this is Points 1 and 3 are already how it works. 
---
Point 1: If you have pacifist on and are not inside a workshop you cannot harm or be harmed by other players. It also protects you from Wanted Players sparking you. 
---
Point 3: Camp are invincible unless you decide to pvp next to your camp. That one is on the camp owner to not give in and start a fight at camp. 
---
As for Point 2: Workshops are a pvp zone. If your going for resources and someone contests it immediately then sure that sucks. However that is one of the functions of a workshop. All players are warned about it when they take a workshop. Having a cool down so you can run away seems pointless on two parts. Removes the pvp part and means you took the workshop for nothing if you are just going to run away.  Best tip is to store all junk safely before going to a workshop that way if you die you just lose a few caps and nothing more. Spawn away from it and your good.
---
Edit: So by request, I did this a few more times and for a few more combinations.
---
Surprisingly, I came up with some really interesting numbers. In short, it looks like Kinetic Servos are definitely under-rated. 
---
It would seem the best combination to get a 4-second refill of the bar is Assembled + Kinetic Servos.
---
The absolute best fill is All of the combined (AB + LW + Rejuv + Assembled + KS) for 3 seconds.
---
However, I believe it acceptable to run just assembled + Kinetic for a 4-second regen and save 5 points by not using AB and Rejuv (LW I will always use, because of the damage reduction).
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/Taax0Vl](https://imgur.com/a/Taax0Vl)
---
It would seem from my testing, it is more efficient to run Assembled + KS and move AB and Rejuv points to weight reduction points to make up for the +100 weight for calibrated shocks.
---
5 free points into QOL weight perks will most likely be worth much more than +100 carry weight.
---
Why's that? Do they die on the way back or something? I really want to get a yao gui for my camp
---
I've taken down 10 scorchbeasts (including a few queens with server help) during a session. By the end of the day, I'll end up with maybe two SB meat. Dropping loot isn't the problem for me. I just get lung, heart, bones, wing fragments, etc, along with the usual nocturnal rolling pins  and .38 ammo.
---
GIVE ME THE MEAT! (Wait, that didn't sound right...)
---
Ok so this appears to make sense and have some logic behind it. If I've understood right, he's saying it's 2 factors:
---
1 - your personal item pick up list. Your personal list is the last 255 items you picked up. 255 makes sense, that number is commonly used as a field size in database tables. 
---
2 - The server item refresh rate. So if i took everything from a room then just sat on the same server it would take hours for that stuff to respawn. 
---
So to get around this (and assuming ore follows the same rules as junk..), pick up all the ultracite, go store it, then go pick up 255 items of junk elswhere. This will push the ultracite off of my recent list of 255 items. The server would remember that I'd cleared the ultracite from the cavern, so log out, server hop and go back to the cavern. As long as there isn't another player currently in there, the ultracite should be back. 
---
I will test this later.
---
Yeah, all the ones both LadySoySauce and myself stated. That Quad Limb is a keeper! Try it out in VATs!
---
It's a riddle that should help you find the location. My dad wanted to do something that could help lower level players so he made X-01 and hid it on the map
---
Angry Turtle is so underrated.
---
So from my testing, it looks like it may be worth running Assembly + Kinetic Servos and saving the perk points for QOL weight perks to make up for calibrated shocks.
---
Should'a called it The Lumbermill.
---
Holy shit, I just now realized why I keep getting trouble shooter crap.
---
Thanx for the guide :) Very concise and thorough. I hope this info gets spread
---
The case is one item no matter what is in it
---
I don't get it. Why go through all this effort when you could possibly miss out on the chance to bag guaranteed xp and legendaries.
---
I mean it's not like Bethesda motivates anyone to complete the objectives.
---
Until Bethesda changes up how event rewards go and clearly indicate objectives such that even an illiterate moron could follow them, I don't see objective-based events having much of a different outcome.
---
I stay subbed in case I’ve missed any advances/announcements, and to see what the current community mood is like. I’m much like you in that the list of needed QOL improvements has just gotten too long, even if you ignore more fundamental issues like weapon balancing and endgame.
---
I think what he means is: "People at lower levels wandering into foundation and crater to advance story missions during these raids would get caught in the crossfire, which could adversely affect their gameplay experience. It would be more suitable to have these events at locations not related to any main story quests."
---
I consider the subs, the forums, the community pages all a part of the entertainment package for games nowadays.
---
when the game you're playing gets a little stale you can always count on the angst of a dedicated fan base to give you a chuckle :)
---
This glitch happened sometime in January of 2019. I forget what patch did it but boy I hated it and still to this day they never fixed it. There is a way to fix it but it's not permanent.
---
You can 'wiggle' the foundations and floor pieces basically 1inch in any direction (this is what causes the glitch in the first place, they're not supposed to be able to be moved at all.
---
Or you can select spam the floor. Select it then un select it then reselect it again and keep doing it until the floor realigns itself.
---
If it doesn't realign itself you can do the manual way I said earlier.
---
Is it true you can ‘heal’ your animals by using the Friendly Fire perk and a shishkebob?
---
Would you not go to prison for picking up and not returning a suitcase full of money stolen from bank during robbery, dropped by robbers when policed chased them?
---
Loving the month Python references in general
---
Ok. Good to know. I couldn't find the vertibot but i did find a bunch of other players scouting around there.
---
PVP needs to be removed completely from Adventure!
---
Yeah, that's not happening.
---
What Bethesda should actually be doing is just removing these legacy items. They're more trouble than they're worth and will keep being so until they're properly dealt with.
---
PVP needs to stay. Whether it's at workshops or if two players tag each other to fight!
---
Consider this fact also, 5 free points don't have to go into QOL.
---
I run all weight reduction weapons (my mains are a JERW LMG and J50LRW minigun) and the only weight reduction perk I run is Traveling Pharmacy, to whore stimpaks. I am always sub 100 weight and sometimes 120 or so if I have to pull a full weight heavy gun out.
---
All other perks are loaded into damage/defence.
---
5 extra points are like perk Christmas, I don't even know what perk I want because I have so much choice.
---
There's a huge difference between morals in real life and in a game.
---
Clearly, at first, the OP didn't know that the items were duped, either. Either way, he is not to blame for duping.
---
Can anyone tell my how much atoms cost this bundle, I really want the log cabin and I must save atoms first
---
LIAR! I asked Todd while he was hiding under my bed and he told me that they are gonna release first SKYRIM ON PC WITH 16 TIMES THE DEATAILS! Also guys quick question, how to remove Todd from under my bed?
---
Yes. That’s what I run at the moment. It was the first one I crafted.
---
I just saw someone today with the black bos paint on their t60 and wondered where it came from. I’ve done forbidden knowledge almost every day and haven’t gotten any of them😢
---
Is the gas mask still -2 perception?  I haven't used one in forever (prefer the bandanas) and I always just sell them at the nearest vendor bot.
---
Phewwww, dense armor is the way! Explosive plasma gatling gang assemble!
---
I think splitting it is the easier route, grinding reputation is way more time consuming than grinding for gold bullion imo
---
Thanks for your reply! Will try this after work.
---
Have and AA 50 Vats 25 Vats Gauss Shotgun so yeah it's possible.
---
You can make 1,700 gold a week. It takes much longer to grind rep. Split the gold.
---
QOL?
---
Sometimes I wonder, how hard would it be if they allowed fanmade weapon 3d models in a contest, give them free atoms for their effort if they hit top 20, implement those skins into game with small changes if needed, quality check (which won't happen) and import into the game and monetize maybe half of them and put others into recipes and random drops from all around. No story or deep lore needed to give us a new weapon or skin.
---
Nice roll 👍🏻
---
Exactly. Can take over a month to grind rep for a faction whereas keeping all the gold is only about 4 days of gold bullion grind. (1,700 a week)
---
Story of my game!
---
My friend could scrap one item and learn the rarest mod and I would be on the 100th.  Good luck😀
---
There's a cave of bloatflies and honeybeasts up there. If you find that it's directly north from there. From Freddy's it's northeast, and there should be a river/stream that'll lead you there too.
---
You don't need an AA gauss IMO. That thing can one shit kill most things in the game. 
---
There's better effects you can go for.
---
I understood that reference.
---
Yay, pretty pony popsicle broadsider. Can't wait. 🙄
---
Yes that should work for all friendly creatures.
---
I have a quick question, does only one alpha spawn or is there an alpha per habitat? I've never been in the vent when there's been more than one habitat attended to lol
---
Junkie, but not optimized. Minmaxing is optimazation, its what makes a god-tier build. But you're not just lacking in minmaxing, you're missing over 30% bonus damage on rifles or shotguns, thats equivalent to two Bloody Mess cards right there. Its an insane drop on damage. A player with these cards and without Better Criticals would outdamage your criticals!
---
QoL perks are shit, hunger and thirst are a non-problems in this game if you know what you are doing. My point is that you cant hide under the argument of QoL or utilty because you have neither of those. 
---
Whats the point of asking your build to be rated if you WANT people to tell you its fine? That DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF ASKING PEOPLE TO RATE YOUR BUILD. You want to play with this build? Go ahead dude, why do you need people to tell you its good when you clearly know its not ideal?
---
Why is this getting downvoted?  It’s truth.
---
The shotgun has a fixed 3 star effect.  The Revolver has a random 1 star effect.
---
They aggro your camp and won't defend it either. Nothing will get destroyed and if you remove the item they are attacking they'll find a new one. Glowing pets will turn scorched near scorchbeasts and from what I've seen sometimes randomly too even if one isn't nearby.
---
Ok I know that spot. Sweet! Thank you!
---
Thanks fir the additional tests! 
---
Personally I think the extra 1s from kinetic servos is not worth it. I much prefer the 100 extra carry weight. Core assembly removed the only annoyance I had with PA - very slow AP regen.
---
I want to be praised because I can't praise myself.
---
100 percent correct. I’m from a very rural area. It’s more common to be able to see at night than it is to be pitch black like they are requesting.
---
Any tips for getting enough feed for the animal spawn? Whenever I do it it there just doesn’t seem to be enough
---
That slow moving reputation bar is ridiculous, I’m still having nightmares about it lol. You could potentially get that much bullion in one day if you buy out lucky and cash in 20 tickets
---
I heard you must have at least 15% camp budget remaining for it to work. Don't know if that's true, haven't tested it. Mine only works a bout half the time.
---
You can't be praised for theorizing such a shitty build, sorry xD
---
1. Not quite what I was saying. I think Pacifist Mode should be changed so that when it's on you can't deal or receive damage. Period. 
---
Currently, if you're in a team with someone and they initiate PvP that opens you up as well. 
---
Some people join teams purely to shoot their friends and drag the squad into PvP. Some people don't have Pacifist on and then go around shooting people intentionally, and some just have really bad aim and hit people by accident. 
---
The whole squad shouldn't be forced into PvP because of 1 member. It should be each player's choice. 
---
Also if you have Pacifist on you can still do damage to players with Bounties. 
---
If while in Pacifist Mode you just didn't receive damage from other players then that solves all of the above. 
---
2. I get that. Workshops are PvP zones and there is a giant message that pops up warning you about this. There also needs to be some risk for the reward of workshops (which I know isn't much and you're better off just farming elsewhere in the world). Maybe leave as is. But people need to stop whinging when they get filled in a workshop. 
---
3. I get that too. But as above sometimes you're dragged into PvP. 
---
I'm not whinging about PvP btw. I don't mind a bit myself and have been known to whack a few players at workshops and shoot back at Muppets who hit me by accident. 
---
Just putting some ideas out there for alternatives to the upcoming PvP nerf of Patch 20.
---
I understood it was a riddle lol couldn’t solve it
---
All I can say is good luck lmao
---
I rarely see anywhere but whitespings and fissure prime nuked on public servers but it happens from time to time. 
---
If I fancy nuking somehere for a change, or for a photograph for my collection, I usually do it on a private server so as to not mess with peoples camps or inadvertently nuke a load of newbies.
---
Hope you get robbed by some new exploit for saying that shit about my glorious build :P
---
Can you do one for Encryptid, that seems to be another one people struggle with.
---
Numbers are messed up for some reason. But you get it - 1, 2 and 3.
---
L O L
---
Haha thanks ok Alexa solve this riddle 🤪🤪🤪
---
Quality of life improvements
---
Pretty sure he is a static spawn in foundation some where
---
Only the one alpha spawns after the last wave of enemies.
---
I bet you're also one of those guys who were camping sloth with legacy weapons at Fasnacht. Also, chances are you're also a Russian.
---
What's your strategy for plan runs? I haven't noticed a pattern for plans and just stumble across them.
---
Sort of. I decided to mostly only play on double XP weekends because while I love Fallout and I do like the game, I hate grinding so much. But I still browse this sub every day to keep up with what’s going on even when I’m not actively playing
---
That's true and it comes down to personal preference as well.
---
I Maria Kondo'd my inventory so weight doesn't mean much to me anymore when I can just jump out of my T-51, into my Excatavor and fast travel.
---
You are right in that the 1 second isn't a lot, but from a percentage basis that is a 20% reduction and it is noticeable.
---
Having said that, I think my observation kinetic servos is underrated has been misstated. It's more likely that Core Assemblies is underrated. There is absolutely no way I would run a Jetpack compare to CA considering how ridiculously powerful it is.
---
L  O  L
---
Personally I enjoy the event, it's one of the only halfway challenging ones along with encryptid and scorched earth.
---
Unpopular opinion but... your friend is why they're changing PvP. Got "baited" and lost and since you had to press a button to fix your camp you fly into a rage. Sorry for sounding harsh, but its really that simple.
---
It’s not just the fight it’s the floor flooded with the remains that finishes you off 😅
---
The DR is trash and not everyone uses stealth. Also, SS has better DR and you could just use stealth boys or roll a chameleon piece. I feel like CSA is gimmicky and only really useful for the rads resist. I’ll throw on the CSA in a nuke zone when I don’t feel like wearing PA just running around for flux
---
Yeah, sure some1 dropped 'metric tonne' of event limited stuff, seems legit to me.
---
When I was lvl 30ish I had a guy come around my base, dropped me 2 hacked .50 cal, and hacked laser rifle.
---
I did not touch it.
---
Just the other day some1 offered me and my teammate gifts, we refused.
---
Either he's a moron or he's like 'fuck it this game is one big dupe fest anyways'
---
It was a question, not a statement.
---
Nah my health is good. Right where I like it!
---
Oh no! You're playing a  post-apocalyptic game of anarchy and death and someone stole your junk!
---
Oh no!
---
It was initially a event that was put into the instanced event list like Scorched Earth and Encryptid. So it was great for team play but for whatever reason it cycled into a random rotation.
---
I agree with you as I have one of each roll and prefer the instigating roll over them all including Bloodied or AA 
---
But as with everything it's personal choice.
---
Anywhere with low level scorched carrying weapons like Morgantown airport. Scrap their weapons and you'll get a good amount of steel.
---
but they also give some of the best buffs in the game, one of the biggest damage buffs for bloodied for example is the unarmed or melee bobblehead and the reduced crafting cost magazine could make it so you could reach near free crafting with this buff
---
And when you crouched the bow turned sideways. Which I really REALLY miss. :'(
---
He is always in the foundation underground lmao
---
Full disclosure, I pretty much knew (or at least found it reasonable to assume) they were from duped presents/pails from the get-go. I'm on PC (so dupers are prevailent there), my char is lvl 130 (so not really a newbie) and I've been "around the block" a few times to know what kinda stuff is fishy and which isn't.
---
But that still doesn't mean I can't thank my unknown benefactor somehow, right? 
---
Even if they are "ill-gotten gains", at least they dropped them for someone who can actually use them, instead of selling them overpriced (especially that Scorchbeast head).
---
Saying this respectfully but that is 100% false. Today alone I had 3 legendary modules and ended up with 5 pieces. It triggered the first and third time and game me two extras.
---
If all you care about is legendaries and/or XP, there are plenty of other more efficient ways to farm. Taking the time to complete the Project Paradise event successfully is primarily to get the unique rewards (bear arm, stimpack diffuser). Same deal for Encryptid.
---
Now here's a man with a holy mission.
---
He was probably glitched. Hopefully you encounter one later that does fight back.
---
Should have visited my camp during fasnacht, lead pipes, wood armour and blooded boards galore..
---
I use to be like that with destiny. eventually I gave up on the game.
---
Lol
---
It is, especially with the bug where half the time Ward doesn't reward rep if he has two seperate lines of dialogue as you turn in the stolen equipment but before you click on one of your 3 responses.
---
for me, theres far to many clean and flashy stuff and not nearly enough lore friendly stuff, hell scruffy clothing and objects for cheat would be a neat middle ground.
---
and dont get me started on the beds, some are beyond to clean AND SMALL my characters look squashed by the bed size, no adult would willingly lay on those if they have sleeping bags or raw mattresses as option since it would give you incredibly bad back pain
---
Were you able to take them out?
---
Well I don't think we should be thanking dupers, dropped for free or not, they are ruining the atmosphere of the 'survival' element in the game that a lot of people do enjoy.
---
Most people, I think would have left it there so that it'd despawn eventually and be one less batch of duped goods roaming around the server, but, as you say PC is prevalent with dupers so it wouldn't have made that much of a difference to be fair. 
---
But again, reiterating the fact that it's probably not a good idea to be thanking them for ruining some aspects of the game. Maybe find a way to be grateful in silence instead of showing support for duping.
---
Unfortunately I can roughly get 20 for 2 habitat or almost 40 for one each time when I try doing solo. You just have to hope people know what to do.
---
That's because the nuke has already touched down when you spawned. OP spawned seconds before that happened.
---
On a side note, I hate this lazy loading. Gotta wait for quests, some even spawn different points on login which i think are a waste of server resources, stats and bullets take a while to load as well.
---
I play in spurts, then log in for the next 2 weeks just to sell.  Though I'm close to near perfect gear so  I might drop out till next content comes out.
---
👍
---
Just because you have the money to burn doesn’t mean that you’re being a smart consumer. You’re still being foolish for supporting the laziness
---
A bit late, but I've got a good one for any future reference! Mostly for console/lower end PC. With the SS jetpack you can fly right up to the 3rd floor through a hole in the ceiling (after you walk through the double doors on the left). If ya cant make it, jump the the ledge, then through. 
---
This skips the elevator loading screen. May only save a second or two depending on how long that load screen is. But as I'm sure you're aware, any amount of time saved adds up fast. 
---
Hope this can help you or anyone else in the future! Best of luck farming!
---
Unless I completely missed it in your post don't forget about formula P that can heal the 3 animals that appear.
---
Are you on PC? Can you transfer keys? I've got it. And never go there.
---
No clue, I dont have a need for perception so I don't notice a lack of it.
---
Thanks mate. I just did it once and I hope from now it will be a little more easy for everyone
---
Go to smiley. Spend 6k on gold.
---
Except none of those things are able to be purchased with cash which is the entire criticism of lootboxes. Spending real money on gambling.
---
Ah, I see. Guess I’ll delete the post then. Thanks for the insight!
---
Although, I imagine presents and pails can be traced to duping, but the items out of them come with a completely new item ID, do they not? Since every one of them is generated from a random loot pool.
---
It’s because the rare plans are worth it. Good legendary Bear arms and their mods are very valuable. Stimpak diffuser is a must for that tadpole challenge and the backpack...well it looks nice as a collection. There are people that care less about legendary drops. 
---
It’s not hard it just require coop, and the more people understand what to do the easier it gets.
---
The mothman encounter is not a boss fight by any means, but you'll need to be on your toes when you come across a non-glitched one. That is, if it decides to fight you and not just bail out of the situation like a rocket.
---
Hey man! I know I'm super late, but I think I may have a tip that could help. Primarily just if your load screens are long like mine, but time it and see if it helps.
---
With the SS jetpack you can fly right up to the 3rd floor through a hole in the ceiling (after you walk through the double doors on the left). If ya cant make it, jump the the ledge, then through. 
---
Best of luck if you're still going after the red asylum dress, or to anyone else in the future who is!
---
I don't know about explosive gauss shotgun but explosive on shotguns now suck balls almost useless
---
Mothmen who spawn by cultists are supposed to be unkillable and non hostile. They’re just there for the prayers.
---
I wasn't actively playing during the Christmas Gift event. I suppose that's true for the Mole Miner Pails. If the Christmas Gift worked in the same fashion then I would suppose that's true, yes.
---
Sure. Although they are plenty enough out there. (More so than other guides) but I admit this event will take a whole server of high levels to fail or that one single person that knows what to do to complete.
---
 That doesn't make sense. You seem preoccupied with the idea that everyone else needs to play just like you do. I don't and won't.  The game has a mode specifically for pvp, just like WoW servers. If you want to fight, go there. It's that simple. Now get back in *your* hole, ganker.
---
Clearly he was bugged. The real one can be quite terrifying at times and certainly will attack you and able to be killed.
---
Oh shit. Yeah. Oh well. Can you get in there without doing the quests?
---
Oh no I’ve never knew that. You mean the chem can heal the animals?
---
I think the explosive legendary effect cancels out the innate explosive damage that the new gauss weapons have, and it likely does less damage.
---
Where you farming it on a private or public server?
---
I've had to fight 2 scorchbeasts up on this tower with a shotgun while waiting. FML!
---
I've heard to use vats
---
Both. I understand, however, that with the public server it differentiates in the event that someone else on the server got there and looted before me.
---
I bet his mother was a hamster and his father smelled of elderberries.
---
The only rare one is the settler wanderer, the old guy and the raider punk can be found in the wild or in a static spot in foundation/creater
---
Aye. I got a junkies on my 5th roll or something which is exactly what i wanted. 
---
I have a furious as a back up but only because i decided to have a backup and it was the next one i rolled.
---
Afaik they both work the same - hell, they even seem to share the same loot pool :P
---
But yeah, you're right - I actually shouldn't be thanking people like that publicly. I remember getting REALLY salty when the SH armor got duped to hell and back, and now I kinda see my hypocrisy there. Thanks for the pep-talk :)
---
That's the prompt that comes across the screen when the events is going on.
---
  I have never tried it myself but I have heard others say they have.
---
Right right that's good to know
---
And laser snipers for plastic!
---
This is really useful!  Thanks!
---
thanks for the LOL.
---
As a rule of thumb Whitespings should be for the poshest of camps only. I feel bad for the rickety wooden camps on those plush lawns, especially when your neighbor is  super smart and stylish:)
---
I have way more than that free atm, it's just busted.. It worked when placed hasn't worked since. Nothing else changed =/
---
Thats how I feel about most cosmetics too. I always avoid the clean items. They just ruin the atmosphere for me.
---
I ran a loop in the cranberry bog. Youtuber wickedychickey had it on her badge guide.
---
Btw you only need rank 3 animal friend and the 3 charisma it takes to equip it.
---
I literally just updated the post with a final conclusion, might want to quickly refresh the post before you make any changes :)
---
Once you find the spot just server hop til you find what you want
---
Oh that valuable info. I have to test it out myself to make sure.
---
Giddy up buttercup I think would be pretty cool, being as we already find their parts in the wasteland
---
I don't know if you are able to give it to the animals or just by using it on yourself near the animals but I do know every time I play that event a prompt comes across the screen that says formula P can heal your ally animals or something along those lines.
---
I always forget to bring some even though I have the recipe
---
Not worth if you are good at managing your stash
---
I think one of the problems is server lag.
---
I've definitely had times where I touched down light as a feather and promptly dropped dead. I've also had times where a full AP bar worth of thrust didn't make a dent in velocity. During Fasnacht, sometimes I would fall short on a jump I've made 100 times, but there were a few times where tapping the jetpack booster sent me flying, to the point where I reached the tip of the steeple with AP to spare.
---
Using Vats w/ explosive shotgun is bugged and it's spread will hit that spot
---
  *There is a slight change in color or a sticker on a weapon and it is considered "a skin"* 
---
Dude, that's literally what it is though. "Skin" was the longest time synonymous with "texture". Hence the word "Reskin".
---
Modern gaming just changed the meaning to "something that looks different in a spectrum ranging from miniscule to extremely".
---
That's a skyrim bug i always had. Extra carryweight bonuses were never calculated until i opened my inventory
---
I had a similar discussion not long ago -   
---
It's obvious Bethesda knows what kinds of things will sell incredibly well, things that players want and the design principles attributed to them that excite people. We know this because they made the Ranger armor a premier component of Fallout 1st.   
---
So why exactly aren't they jumping straight to cosmetics that they know players will buy? Whether that's because they have really grungy apocalyptic design like trench coats, gasmasks and bandoleers or old nostalgic designs from previous games?   
---
Are they afraid they'll create a redundancy in the Atomic Shop? Or is it more of a pride thing?
---
I already can't see five feet infront of me in the Mire at night without using my Mr. Fuzzy Mining Helmet™ to help me see.
---
upvoting for an awesome idea
---
Lucky hole is full of lead, not steel.  Testing site 3 in the ash heap has a few lead nodes and a decent amount of iron as well.  From there head to blackwater mine and where you spawn in after fast traveling go straight ahead  and a little left to the cliff wall and there are another 8  iron nodes all near each other.  It's a quick trip to do both and smelts to maybe 600 steel or so.
---
Scrapping guns is definitely the cheapest way to get steel though since no acid is required.
---
It’s not an insignificant thing. We paid for the items expecting a spinning wheel then they broke it a week later. It’s unacceptable frankly that it’s been a month and that damn wheels just sitting outside my camp looking derpy.
---
I haven't played the game in over a week so I don't know if they changed anything with FFR on Gauss guns but for me personally FFR had zero effect on fire rate. I also saw this in Angry Turtles video on Gauss shotguns. I also noticed that the gun fires faster in third-person.
---
It also regularly glitches out and no amount of food will let it go past lv 0!
---
If i find a shishkebab im gonna try it. If i didnt scrap it, i'll also put on the extra flame jets mod i had found in the wild
---
Update 20 coming next week, 30th of june
---
The basement code is 970930 for anyone who doesn't know.
---
What would you like for the BE gatling gun?
---
this guide is bad. all you need is a shishkebab to keep the animals alive by yourself and you absolutely can get the bear arm plan with only 1 friendly animal alive, thats how I got it. just solo the radkelp area
---
Thats coming in the winter
---
Is that confirmed?
---
Yeah I believe so at least im 99% sure they confirmed it
---
Why is it always the console people who have trouble reading sub rules?
---
Any idea on a source? Been a little out of the loop for the last few weeks.
---
The Mothman design is actually super adorable to me. It should probably look more scary to fit the lore/look like the statues in game, but I'm also fine with getting attacked by such a cutie! Sorry it took so long to see him, and a bugged one at that. I love doing the Path to Enlightenment just to commune with him!
---
Whats with Batteries included? it's not like you'll be using energy weapons...
---
You have to actually arm the bloodied weapon to see the damage difference.
---
Instead of being sarcastic maybe you could just point me in the right direction?
---
My opinion they're both at fault. One is a tool for fighting back and losing and crying about it the other is a tool for trying to get somebody that doesn't want to PVP to PVP.
---
I came back to the game yesterday after not playing for over a year and in my opinion the game still needs a lot of weapon balancing... 
---
I stopped playing as the games balance sucked melee was king and well it still is.... The time and resource investment to make ammo and repair guns would be fine if this was to balance out guns being the best dmg dealing option but they are by far the worst and the being safer at range arguement is kinda pointless in F76 too.. 
---
Just go full on melee run round 1 or 2 hitting things to death taking zero dmg and costing you nothing... It should be the other way round in my opinion guns should 1 or 2 tap things but you get total HP penalty for using a guns, melee should take more hits but give you a passive defence boost an no penalty making it the tanky option.
---
Some Bethesda employee’s twitter. Looks unintentional but probably not.
---
Thx will have a look
---
Its really not that hard to figure out, especially when you have instructions every step of the way... i barely started a month ago, and i soloed encryptid on my 3rd attempt at the event. To be completely honest ultracite vampiric primed gatling laser helps a bunch with that, but otherwise it all comes to following instructions, and a bit of thinking, like if theres 2 objectives to defend, and 8 people, the math is pretty easy there... some people just dont have the ability i guess xD
---
I've noticed a lot more griefers / grievers than before wastelanders. I don't know if it is people who maybe wants to give you the "raider" experience.
---
No because some outback hunga bunga will always complain how his unrecognized cow poo soaked land doesnt have a flag pole in fallout.Some flags would even spark fights which is not what I would like to see in a game...
---
My missus hadn't been outside Vault 76 for more than 30 seconds (not an exaggeration) before she'd been shot at and rifle-butted.
---
Other people are assholes.
---
Im pretty sure yeah
---
It's free money I'm a bloodied build so I put all my cores in my vendor no matter what charge they have, priced at however much they are charged a core with 56% charge goes for 56 caps. I can't keep cores in my vendors for more then a few hours sometimes
---
You got downvoted for... not being all knowing?
---
That is one reason why player voices volume is set to 0 on my game.
---
Yea removal is random but with trading serums it's far easier to start anew or replace what fell off
---
Thanks... I've never been able to do this event. :(
---
No, they got rid of that a while ago.
---
People don't like to accept that they're part of the reason that Bethesda continues to do it. They'd rather blame the people who pay for atoms or are 1st members. I'm able to acknowledge that I'm part of the problem. But I always end up pouring 100s of hours into their games, so as far as I'm concerned, they've earned their money from me.

Diluted Rad Away takes away the last applied mutation. Regular rad away gets rid of them all.

Now off with you before I taunt you a second time!

Mayb
---
You're overestimating players willingness to read and follow instructions.
---
From my experience in gaming, and in this sub, you'd be surprised at the lack of basic knowledge.
---
I feel you. DO not hoard to0 many modules because you get caught up crafting looking for that roll. When space and all limits are reached you will be dumping SS armour on the floor. It's a very unique pain :(
---
Tbh I don't think it was to do with griefing, more like pushing their weight about. They were looking at the vendors too and seen I was on one they havnt looked in yet.
---
So my guessing they were impatient and thought aggravating the lowbie to get him out of the way because they are more important being higher level
---
Lol so true.. why no UzBekIStaN flag????!1!1
---
But that's a price I'm prepared to pay.

(Sorry, Uzbekistanies)

Thanks :)

This is stupid and a waste. It’s like if all the battleships carrying troops to Europe sank themselves after the voyage over. In Fallout 2 you see what a “real” control vault result should be with Vault City. Use a GECK on the area around the entrance, creating an area for farming, habitation. Slowly build a settlement that is defensible allowing people to transition from the protection of the vault to the settlement, and Vault eventually becomes your storage, water treatment, and power plant - and still be an emergency bunker if some army lays siege to your settlement.
---
Bots ;)
---
The reason ppl nuke Morgantown is because of the ridiculous amount of ghouls that live there. All those tiny level 3s turn into glowing ones
---
Another user has done just that and i now realise i mistook this sub for another called r/fo76marketplace. Sorry about that.
---
I thought I was the only one who was spending more time doing research in the reddit for issues or potential pitfalls than I do in the actual game. 
---
After considering it I got a little ticked off there’s more content on the Reddit than in the game.
---
I dont think intelligence increases xp gain in 76. Just the other fallouts. I have 15 int on my character and I've seen no increase in xp gain.
---
I’ve chatted to some of these “dedicated raiders” and they are stone-cold sociopaths. They’re not here for fun in any reasonable sense of the word. Good riddance to them.
---
If you don't have them already you can buy serum recipes somewhere for a large amount of caps, that's what I'm working towards
---
50 hours, you didn't "fall in love" with it.
---
Have u seen riflegaming’s video? U should go check it out if not
---
Only you know the answer to that question.
---
I'm on mobile so it's not for me I'd have to access another page, and as I said I mistook this for another marketplace subreddit because of the similar page picture. Simple mistake, my bad.
---
Yeah theres been alot of griefing in the past few days.Almost ended up in the same scenario.Also double check your teammate he may be in it all along.
---
Heeey, i want that too, im burning thru them like crazy, especially now that i primed my vampiric GL... high radiation fluids are a b**ch...
---
I'll bring the Acid. Let's do this!! ;)
---
Here, here. Maybe there should be an option to have it darker for those players who want it. I don't want to keep falling into ditches or off cliffs and dying.
---
That’s weird.  I’ve never had super duper double a crafting of secret services armor in over 150 rolls.
---
Encryptid? Damn near killed 'em.
---
Nice !
---
I keep 15 or so on my vendor at all times for 20 caps each.
---
If there were an ingame text chat I would give them away for sure. I dont use mics and am too lazy to organize stuff ingame on reddit.
---
Very cool of you though!
---
Uranium fever is great for getting steel, equip a Tesla or just try and get atleast a shot on any miner you see. They usually drop weapons and with the scrapper perk you can get 10-20 steel per weapon. The gauntlets give you mole rat teeth just so you know too. There’s a weapons work bench right by the start of the event so don’t worry about becoming the weight.
---
Essentially the wastelanders car horn, i do the same thing all the time
---
It's actually hilarious how stupid and baseless your comments are
---
If it was around midnight, he was spawned by the Cultists and cannot be killed
---
Got another one this morning. Brings me up to 20 again.
---
I blame bethesda for this, there is only one 3* legendary in the whole event. Its normal ppl gather around in one habitat just to kill the sasquatch. All the high levels do it, just as they watch the Legendary mole miner spots in uranium fever or how they only tag enemies to kill legendaries in radiation rumble. Nobody plays the objective, then you have a low level like me being a freaking conduct on encryptid for my team with a bloodied build. High levels do it just as bad as low level players that dont know how to play.
---
Once again— why are you booing this man? He’s right!
---
Damn, I would love this
---
Ok.ill start to buy the ones I need incase I erase it  accidentally
---
I would recommend checking out Fallout 2, Fallout 3, and Fallout 4. You can play them in any order you like, but these ones give you a good idea what Bethesda is like with these games and the franchises soul. Fallout: New Vegas was made by another developer and published by Bethesda (which is why I didn’t mention it until now), but it’s still the most fun Fallout game in many fan’s opinions. I like 4 the most personally, but please check them all out! Lots of great stories and really fun gameplay to be had. Much more fun than 76 to me. Hope you have fun!
---
The lights only work if walls etc load in before them.
---
I liked the cartoon, kinda cute.
---
The base damage with no perks on the explosive is 162 and 288  for the other two.  If you add in all the other perks the other two are 704 and the explosive is 334.  So that is a huge difference.  126 points no perks and 370 with all perks.  I think it is bugged.
---
That’s why I stopped playing for now. I did the same boring shit every day. Log in, do the dailies, exchange legendaries for scrip, receive bullshit rolls on my armor, log off. It just isn’t entertaining. It’s work. There are other games right now. I‘ll take a look at the seasonal model but tbh, I don’t think it will change much of the overall endgame experience FO76 has to offer.
---
yes vats works well but you usually miss the first shot.  You need concentrated fire maxed out.  The accuracy on these things is 49 % so it need to be kitted out to improve that and orange mentas does not hurt.
---
It seems like Bethesda tend to nerf, many other AAA game companies balance their games. At least that's what is feels like, especially when I'm playing Reddit76.
---
yes my Q 33 +1A does more damage in vats then when it is not in vats
---
I've got the paint myself so I'm able to use it and stuff but I got it over a year or so ago so not sure if the drop chances have changed or something now but it just doesn't drop when my mate hands in the tech data.
---
The Gauss shot guns do pretty well, they take a little to get use to but man the pack a punch.  They also have better range.
---
Sounds like the synopsis for a Friday the 13th sequel!
---
yes but how do we get other players to actually do it lol.
---
Still havent seen a girl playing a male toon.Some blokes will play fem toons for the reason you stated and various other reasons but there has always been dudes who pretended to be girls so they can free items in online games...
---
Haven't you noticed? This is a Bethesda Apologists Hive, once you poke it a bit -- they all come out to get you. I love Fallout 76, I am counting 500+ hours in only 3 months time and I don't plan on stopping, but they can do better, and if we don't speak up.. then I don't think anything will ever change. There's something wrong with the higher ups, the management, they should get their priorities straight.
---
Seems qol is code for game too hard or game doesn't reward enough for doing nothing like diablo 3 I guess.
---
Have an upvote from a strictly PVE player.
---
I'm using this sub as the equivalent of the "what are you waiting for kid" meme.
---
I look at the announcements, the Itv, the roadmap, thinking damn it could be cool.
---
Then I go play games that actually work.
---
I have quite a few male friends who play female characters. No issues here
---
Ditto.
---
I find if you pop up on their map when the event is on, there will most likely people joining. 
---
Some people don’t because they are not confident that they will know what to do in the event. So if more people would know how to run the event, more will likely show up!
---
You want Quecus to run the project. If not you will have no chance at getting Bear Arm plans or bear arm mods.
---
ONLY if you're doing the base budget glitch.
---
u/glittermace
---
Not that it's a game breaker but dragon corpses, sorry I mean scorchbeast, have been following us on FT since Skyrim........
---
All I’m addin to this is that I’m not stimming anyone in an event because they took a knee messin with their jet pack
---
Shoot liberators, robots, etc
---
Before u start the event, there is a door u need a code for.  In there u can activate formula P for the animals.   They will heal themselves after each wave.  
---
Only downside to this, friendly animals will now attack instead of running away. 
---
Personally I don’t like doing it this route.
---
I love this game. If your worried about QOL then you should have played on release. Yikes.
---
Can confirm. I’m usually that guy who just stands but the friendlies and makes sure they’re full health. 
---
Did that during Fasnacht too and most commonly during Riding Shotgun as well.
---
Nuka Shine Paint on a T-51b helmet looks sexy af
---
Im just curious, can you salv legendary its via workbech target scrapping? Ive never tried but it works on loads of stuff that isnt scrappable
---
What about the mansions in the south? My group wanted to be able to make that place into a collective home for all of us so badly. Even if it were just an instanced interior we could all go on.
---
I'm here because I love the game and want to know what's happening with the community / updates.
---
i never get the fall damage and i only have bird bones. you should slow the fall with the jet pack actually
---
.... So it's still bugged massively? How can you fix what loads in first?
---
Definitely this, which is why I'm always baffled by the "darker nights" mods for most games... more often than not, they just make it practically pitch black, even though that's not actually even remotely realistic! And I just wonder... why?
---
I wouldn't say it was a bug. Just how the game spawns Camps etc. It's the same with the glowing pumpkins.
---
I do it to see reactions to new updates
---
Oh yea.... I forgot that was in the roadmap 😅
---
ty
---
Ye that's bugged too lol I'd definitely call a light element that doesn't light up bugged. I've seen the pumpkin load some really weird purple static pattern instead of the face projection.
---
Data Miners have confirmed it's pure RNG.
---
Don’t think so, hasn’t ever let me do it
---
It's not just you; on PS4, I used to have my CAMP in the Mire, and it went from "sorta dark" to "ominously creepy and imposing dark", enough that I'd actually slapped a couple constitution lights on my roof just to light up the surroundings a bit!
---
People don't want to play pvp and they are not gonna add pvp because miniority of player want it back for god sake they even try to make people play survival with giving away free legendary items in game where end game is getting good legendary items people don't like it and they don't have reason to add it just let it go
---
I just started a hiatus from f76 or id test it myself rn. Id have to reinstall. :(
---
Yes. I enjoyed it a lot when it was released despite its many flaws. I get on every once in a while. When wastelanders came out I played for a few weeks. I like the potential this game has and I check in from time to time to see if they have met it yet.
---
Well, hes not wrong.
---
Being a 1st sub *immediately* makes the game a better place for low level chars. Aside from the general benefits of the comped atom points you get monthly and the infinite stash storage, the ability to roll private worlds is a huge game changer. No high level players spawning high level mobs in lower level areas/events. The game progresses at exactly your level.
---
Then for the builders, collectors, and camp artists theres no worry about some sociopthic asshole ruining your camp just because they can. Especially right now as there is a group of griefing twats running around "protesting" the upcoming pvp changes by trying to ruin things for everyone else.
---
Yeah I just have zero interest in PVP all together. That’s not what I play fallout for.
---
Separate servers would be nice. Or just expand/improve on modes like nuclear winter.
---
I pretty much agree with this. You cannot make PvE and PvP players happy until you separate the modes completely. That was the biggest reason Survival failed. Don’t like the extra risk? Don’t like that people actually fight back? You can just go back to Adventure mode and club seals at workshops. 
---
Ultimately I think they need a more more thought out interpretation of Survival Mode, but until then, just separate the damn servers. Everybody deserves to be able to play how they like, that would at least stop the bleeding.
---
The last month for me has been logging in just to turn notes in and getting off. But I browse the sub regularly just to see what everyone else is up to
---
Been playing since the beginning and am almost lvl 350 now.   I’ve acquired some of the best armor and weapons in the game and have literally seen it all from the early exploits to the countless overreactions (nerfs) by Bethesda as they try to cater to the very vocal and obnoxious duckies and bunnies crowd. 
---
I was thrilled when they came out with survival mode because I like shooting and killing and blowing things up.  While I have a decent camp and enjoy player vending I’m not a grinder or a builder.  
---
Instead of simply trying to optimize survival the anti PvPers (that probably never went into survival) complained and Bethesda nerfed the shit out of it and eventually pulled the plug.  In its place they developed NW which is/was an abomination.  It’s neither nuclear winter or PvP.  Not with all the cheating and exploits. 
---
All I want is some semblance of back and forth and the occasional drama and anxiety that came with survival.  The random encounters - not knowing what to expect - were fun as hell.  Honestly most of the time it wasn’t about spawn killing at WS train station but tracking and hunting and exploring not knowing who might be lurking around the next corner.    
---
Now, outside from an occasional planned event like Meat Week the game is pretty damn boring.  Make PvP great again and quit taking advice from the non PvP crowd.
---
You have to relearn the plans. 
---
And yes, you have to learn the fixer plan to get it as a drop.
---
I agree but I was shouted down for the mere mention that they should add Ultracite plans and mods to vendor pools.  Seems like people want you to grind the SBQ till your fingers bleed for some of those rare plans.  Like the grind of everything else is not enough.
---
I'm being facetious. 
---
Basically it's a Bethesda problem because players are just going to chase the XP and legendaries. Completing the event successfully is less important than bagging legendaries and xp.
---
It's why other events like Free Ranged are infuriating. Same too with the megasloth during Fasnacht, even though it gave you a shitty legendary.
---
It does light up though. It just doesn't project if it loads in before everything else.
---
I keep saying that the monthly atoms and the private world is enough for me to keep my Fallout 1st sub, and that the scrap box should be for everyone. Its such a game changing thing that I’m still a bit annoyed that they keep it from everyone.
---
What would you like for trade?  Would ammo or caps work?
---
Thanks for the info, however im talking about damage **reduction,** not **resistance.**
---
So ONLY learning the fixer plans on an alt will drop fixers far more often from the purveyor yes?
---
Something like PvP Anchorage sim would have been skippy.  Just drop everything to to level 1 and turn it into an old school PvP akin to unreal.
---
Honestly it does feel like the PvP crowd is majorly neglected, but also torn against themselves...
---
Workshops are one thing I guess, being Opt-In and all, but hardly anyone seems to claim them specifically for PVP, but for the resources (which in Adventure Mode, makes sense), so PvE players usually come into conflict with PvP players this way. 
---
Another Opt-In PVP feature in adventure mode is Hunter/Hunted, that I have never seen start since release, and is exclusively designed for PVP, which leads me to believe that not all PvPers want to fight other PvPers, and would rather an easy kill at a workshop.
---
Nuclear Winter, being a "Pure" PvP mode is a good start, at least, but it doesn't solve the issue of PvP vs PvE players.
---
Survival mode was the perfect option, an Adventure Mode for PvP players, but all the bonuses caused FOMO for PvE players.
---
So yeah, separate them all.
---
Adventure for PvE players, Survival for PvP.
---
Keep Nuclear Winter as it's own thing, but remove Hunter/Hunted since it's useless in either mode.
---
There’s a gas mask in the raider bundle
---
Alrighty, definitely let me know lol
---
Theres a metal muzzle -the one the scorched man wears in the wayward- I think its in the raider bundle but I’m not sure if its hazard proof though by the look of it, it should be
---
I play jsut cause of routine I suppose, or I start looking for say magazines or since wastelanders I'm keen on grifnibg for unyielding secret service armor and getting the t65 armor. I still oaky it cause it is a beautiful game, that map is huge, there's plenty of stuff to do if you know what your doing, the stability of the game could be better but eh I still play it
---
I still enjoy the world and the grind of trying to get every plan/mod etc.  Just general completion-ism.  I've been playing for about 1 year now.    
---
The game's biggest shortcomings are obvious:  LACK OF END-GAME PROGRESSION CONTENT FOR GROUPS.
---
That is a pain I wish on no one and I too have felt it.
---
I tested this as soon as i seen your post and  ... it doesn't always work that way, i had empath, talons and healing factor on my low level alt, i ate a few rads and got speed demon ( thanks :D ) and as i used the diluted rad away, i lost empath ( old one )
---
Not really. I love the game but can still see how all the minor bugs and stuff like cap\scrip\gold limits, janky UI, inventory space, etc. can still put people off after they play for awhile. 
---
Also the lack of endgame imo, other than SBQ and events to me, isnt obvious till after that amount of time.
---
haha all good man the days do blur!
---
It's not the right game for PVP, they could make a stripped back survival server with no perks no legendarys and no special stats. Something like dayz or rust, spawn in find loot survive. Maybe have persistent servers so you could get a clan together and control a workshop? Wipe it every so often to keep it fair and push survival elements up. Temperature, radiation protection, food and drink and to top it off drop instant healing from stimpacks and have them slooooowly build your health up. Could add rewards like NW has for competing tasks.
---
Is that still in the Atomic Shop? Can't seem to find it.
---
I would rather see smaller dedicated pvp modes/zones like a fighting arena or capture the GECK where players have their stats normalized and only get the gear and consumables found in the arena.  This way its about fair fights rather than having perfect builds and legendaries to demolish all competition.
---
I think I’m just about there too...usually I don’t hoard the modules but the last few days i had that thought of maybe if I save them up I’ll get a few amazing rolls...this of course is completely the wrong way of thinking
---
is this confirmed about the veil? I've used it in the ash heap recently and have never had any issues..
---
Yeah, that's the one I had in mind. You see it a lot on Blood Eagles. Can't seem to find it dropping anywhere, tho
---
I think you’re dead on with this. They know what we want, they’re just not going to make it available until there are less atoms to earn in game. 
---
Hoping today’s selection proves us wrong though.
---
The Veil of Secrets does have the  SURV\_DiseasePrevention\_Inhalation keyword, so it should work, AFAIK. [Here is the Nukacrypt entry](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0010A09B) for that keyword. Klick on the "ref" tab to get the complete list of items.
---
I don't know. All I know is that I've gotten sick twice while on it, yet never with my Assault Mask.
---
Mhmm mhmmm and how do you make it load in right? It's a bug.
---
If you bought the game on steam how is not there?  Should just be able to download it
---
The game is so much safer now than it was in the beginning.  I had my camp destroyed numerous times for no good reason and got killed many times by high level people just looking to grief and raid but honestly it was a right of passage.  It forced me to adjust my tactics and gameplay.  
---
That’s the bottom line folks - instead of complaining do something about it or change things up.  Some people make themselves an easy target and we don’t need any more nerfs.
---
Don’t diss my fucking bed like that
---
It's pretty fucking lame to be honest. Like it or not PvP is the endgame for f76. There are no dangerous mobs, only dangerous players
---
It's actually a separate cash pack available in the MS or PS store.
---
maybe you just dont understand what skin means...
---
goat legs boi
---
Would the game be banned if they do a Chinese flag.. rofl
---
The only way to get a legendary fixer of any kind to drop in any way is to learn the fixer plan.
---
But you can still buy a fixer from another player, or cross your fingers and transfer something from your main to the new character using a world container. (I do it all the time.)
---
I never played until recently. I heard the horror stories and stayed away. I only know the post Wastelanders version of the game. I like it. Feels like a Fallout game and it's enjoyable. It's buggy as all hell and has some frustrating things about it but all in all its fun and that's what counts. It looks great and the game mechanics are actually pretty solid. Tried playing Fallout 4 again recently and man you can see huge leaps forward in graphics and especially the controls of 76.
---
Bleh! So no PC availability?
---
The fireman helmet is a costume helmet so no.
---
What a brainless safe bet. I'd follow you if there's one like this
---
Some of the stuff is pretty lackluster. I'm surprised they don't take note of the top mods from F4. There were some weapons, outfits and camp items that look great.
---
Leaving X-01 so a lucky lower level player can use it... When they reach higher levels... Um.
---
Any bandana will do it.
---
If the Microsoft Store doesn't fit the bill it's also on the Bethesda Store.
---
So it is just random.it wont remove the last said mutation
---
Crack spackle
---
Thanks for the tip! I needed high rad fluids and was able to gather 8 in 20 or so minutes. And now I have more bloatfly glands than I'll ever need!
---
Hm, will look into that. Thanks for the info.
---
You're welcome
---
The PVP player base is the minority, but the ones I know are THE MOST dedicated players. They typically have the greatest understanding of everything in game, and are better at PVE than PVE-only players. I think they deserve to have a Survival Mode or a PVP-only space for sure.
---
Yeah inventory space is enough of a limit. The scrip limit just has a mobile game mechanic feel to it that really puts me off.
---
I'm gonna go and talk to a wall instead, have a great day. Xx
---
You can solo it with bloodied, sneak, quantums and scorched beast meat to heal... without even triggering all the bots. I love this event solo, hate it in public servers people are just dumb
---
I fall into neither of those categories, but I am a rather new player. I started after some free trial on Xbox, and I must say I wish I got this game sooner.
---
Through maybe 100 hours in so far, there haven't been any game-breaking bugs that I have seen. The most common bug IMO is enemies spawned in the ground that are nonombative, and cannot be killed. It's annoying but doesn't affect you at all. I have been disconnected once, but since then it's been smooth sailing.
---
The gameplay is amazing and what drew me in was the lore. Bethesda does a great in letting you roam around the map, but will make you regret those decisions if you're underleveled. I love that type of gameplay. Some don't, it's not for everyone. It makes you plan out an adventure and makes the journey so much more.
---
All in all, I love the game. Seasons is coming out soon, and some new updates coming over the summer and fall are exciting.
---
Pros: Lore/Fallout gameplay, not too many player interactions (griefers), community is awesome, huge map, tons of fun locations to keep you busy
---
Cons: higher-leveled enemies in random servers based on total player count in server, repetitive daily missions, recycled events, and no (current) post-end game content
---
Ur right. It is possible to get bear arm plan with 1 animal.  But the chances are greatly reduced.   U should have played the lotto that day.  Chances of that happening again are slim to none.
---
Only if you make it weird. ;)
---
&gt; IF PEOPLE DONT WANT TO PVP DO NOT TRY TO FORCE/ENTICE THEM TO. 
---
That's the essence of it. I as a solely PvE player, I don't care that PvP players can have their PvP fun. It should NEVER involve people who never want to be involved with it. That includes workshops and Monster Mash event.
---
Why would China ban the game for a Chinese flag?
---
They should have an area in the map that's PVP with a warning before you go into it. Like Runescape. 76 would be so good if they took some inspiration from Runescape. Even stuff like Woodcutting Levels and Cooking etc.
---
No downside beside crafting using flux.
---
Except it's not?  An early trailer showed it and the Fireman outfit being used to explore the Burning Mine, and it can be found in a couple locations in the world space that a person would logically need to wear one, I found mine in a tent in the Ash Heap.  Plus if a bandanna can function as a gas mask I don't see why this shouldn't.
---
I think your theory is sound.  Let us know how it works out.
---
Awesome, thanks.
---
It's sold by the toy vendor in whitespring for not a lot of caps
---
Why are you even here? It's not like I sub and read the subreddits of games I dislike. Why waste your time like that. It's pretty sad actually.
---
Because then you have to Treasury Note grind which means you'll play more.
---
Or they'll microtransaction Gold Bullion.
---
Real answer; it's not as game-breaking as the rest of the bugs plaguing the game.
---
How do you know a fix isn't coming in Patch 20? Why don't you hold up til next week and see.
---
Yes the ammo.
---
Performance point of view? Lmao are you crazy it won't touch your performance
---
They can do better. But I suppose we are just pioneer scout archers at the end of the day.
---
Sir,  
---
best

troll  
---
ever  
---
prime reciever 20 lvl fixer :D  
---
I know it was not your intention, but still ... kinda chuckle here :D
---
&gt;I haven’t for instance tried dropping/putting 200 items in a world case and looting them to delve deeper into how it works.
---
Why haven't you?  Report back when testing is complete.  And make it 255 items.  Mounted head plans preferably.
---
Holy shit. I thought this was a troll. This guy has more wood than I've ever seen; he could make Paul Bunion blush.
---
Nice well i've not met any nice ones.
---
One container ?
---
Correct. It seems to be last one more often, but it's random.
---
No
---
What the hell!? You're right! Just checked Nukacrypt, and they DO have the DiseasePrevention\_Inhalation modifier. Just saved myself a lotta cash. Thanks!
---
Probably because it's a low priority for them. 
---
It doesn't directly impact their revenue and it doesn't seem to impact player numbers or threaten to take away sub money, like the player vendors and display cases not being addressed for a couple of months.
---
If you kick up enough of a stink, maybe but Bethesda just don't care.
---
Super baddies and scrapper perk for steel.  Excavator PA and lucky hole mine for lead.  Tangara town and the railway down south for acid(snallygasters and crickets).  Ammo crafter level 2 and super duper 3.  Enough ammo to choke a snake.
---
Decontamination arch. Buy them.
---
That's a great idea to use the gun displays as a canvas over that gas station sign.  A+.  Is this your IGN on PC?  I want to come see it in person.
---
And yes all workshops are a giant waste of time.
---
Its based on a calculation. When you start going downwards, it takes the highest point you were and subtracts the lowest point before hitting the ground. No matter how slow you are going, that higher number being too high compared to the lower number will kill you.  
---
In order to survive, you have to go even just a tiny bit upwards before hitting the ground. That way you get a whole new number for "highest point" that will be much closer to the ground.
---
I remember when Rock* did this with GTA; new personal property, double the cost as the old. Works good.
---
My brother.
---
I could be wrong but I believe they work one after the other if that makes sense ((I always forget if this is "additive" or "multiplicative") as in if you were to take 100 fall damage with 2x cushioned pieces it reduces damage by 40% (60) then again by 40% (36)
---
the stimpack diffuser is the rare one. I've gotten the bear arm plenty of times
---
anecdote is the the plural of data
---
:)
---
This \^ And the only workshops worth a damn to me are ones for Acid and Fusion Cores.
---
I play after work, to wind down, I've been playing since the beta.  
---
I now play to get reputation to the 2 factions and try to see the wendigo colossus.
---
shortcomings:  It is easy when you are well equiped
---
Agreed i never understood this community.
---
Craft it.
---
Lucky Hole, Silo gyms, and Can Chimes (Camden Park and Whitesprings Golf Course) for Lead. Scrapper Perk and Uranium Fever for Steel (pick up every weapon you find).
---
Ammosmith 2 + Super Duper 3 = Craft away.
---
Its a good one, not godroll, but a solid one, id det 15-20k worth
---
I'm with you on separating them. I used to do a lot of PvP games and honestly I play Fallout because I don't want to do that. I find it boring, but hey a lot of people love it and that's okay. PvP as of now is people tricking others to get teamed up on and getinng ripped off or having their camp destroyed. It's not competitive it's mean and ruins things for people just trying to have a good time. 
---
Also the PvP needs to be taken out of the workshops. This is a real problem. It opens people up to be attacked and they are just trying to get resources. You already fight waves of enemies to get and keep a workshop. Why put PvP in there?
---
i've had the sound and gotten the picture on the screen, but never an extra legendary
---
Lmao I was trying to craft it as quickly as possible since I wasn't sure if he'd walk away all of a sudden. Only when he picked it up I realized what I had done
---
Are you talking about patch 20? That's due for release on the 30th, next week, not today unfortunately
---
Use a gatling gun for a daily driver. 50 cals and lmgs are a pain to feed.
---
Good advice. Do wish it was locked to level 50 still... Players below level 50 without a good turn out will have a bitch of a time.
---
Kinda hard being forced into Oceanic servers where 99% are Asians that don't speak English. But hey i try to communicate they just run off.
---
hmm... definitely gonna have to pay more attention now :)
---
All we ever do playing this game is wait... grind this, wait for that, it should be a high priority for them to fix if it causes issues with players collecting bullion since it’s not like you can just go once and unlock what you want it’s weeks of grinding and without the extra bullion it takes even longer.
---
The only PVP I ever participate in is workshops and by "participate" I mean "get two-shotted by a level 780 player who jetpacks out of nowhere 3 seconds after I claim a workshop"
---
I haven’t tried that before. I may try it though, at this point I’m willing to try about anything in that game.
---
Yes if you are 105 and your mate is 75 you will see 105 enemies they will see 75.
---
Ditto
---
I see what you did there
---
i would say so, and i wouldnt be surprised either
---
The pve crowd can be so cancerous about these topics. They rather kick out all pvp players instead of giving them their own mode.
---
have noticed if the damage is less than one you could craft?  I got an instigating explosive from the same quest.   The base damage with no perks on the explosive is 162 and 288 for the other two I crafted another instigating and a Quad. If you add in all the other perks the other two are 704 and the explosive is 334. So that is a huge difference. 126 points no perks and 370 with all perks. I think it is bugged.
---
Personally, I run Quercus anyway - I’ve done the event a few times recently and for the most part, the subjects don’t attack the alpha.
---
Also, while I know you don’t recommend doing it, here’s the information for anyone curious about how to allow him to run it:
---
Head to each sector and find the lab space. There will be a printer with a piece of paper next to it. They contain a code (970930) which can open the engineering wing. During the event, the terminal in this area gains a shutdown code for the main computer, which can be shut off from the same terminal that starts the event. The code remains the same, but the password must be retrieved each and every time the event is ran.
---
I’ve had that happen to me a lot as well. It has never actually made extra for me.
---
There are some real fools in game with much too much time on their hands.....
---
It will only drop on the character that knows the plan, yes.
---
Again the griefers' days are numbered so they want to take out their frustration on people just trying to have a good time. Angry virgins lashing out.
---
Yea power plants...I built on a acid vein so I'm usually swimming in it.
---
Ga.. gatlened? 🤯
---
My first experience in the game was stepping out of 76 to be greeted by a half dozen 100+ players meleeing me while I was trying to find my way around the starting area
---
A lot of the underlying problems with the game at launch still exist to this day. However, Wastelanders added a layer ontop of this that made it fun enough.
---
I would NEVER pay full price for this game ever. Wait for it to be on sale before buying it. At least then you might have a chance of getting your money's worth out of it.
---
Best thing to do for lead is to clean out the work out rooms of lead weights at fire station and green county lodge, then server hop.  There’s also a bunch of weights on top of the monorail elevator.  Equip ammosmith and super duper cards when you craft and you’ll have all the ammo you need.
---
You could create a "jack-of-all-trades" set of scout or combat.  Piecing together ghoul slayer, mutant slayer, zealot, troubleshooter, and exterminator.  That would give a nice damage reduction of 15% from most creatures.
---
You dont know how happy I get when I actually hear a female voice from a female character....
---
Im pretty sure that was always the case. When you buy it on Steam it asks you to link a Bethesda account. You will always need a Bethesda account to play. Once you link it though, it will just automatically login for you.
---
If you want a code fix now, learn to code and submit the fix. I'm sure they'll enjoy the help.
---
How about do your research rather than whining on a forum. The workaround has been documented and is out there. DO NOT enter the Wayward in between buys. That means if you buy 300 gold on Sunday, don't enter the Wayward until the next Sunday. This works for me and several of my friends. Of all the bugs, this is among the least annoying.
---
Seriously, they are working on bug fixes and new content probably as fast as they can given COVID-19 restrictions and what not. I get you are inconvenienced, but it's one of the least annoying bugs in the game.
---
All the people saying that it's not a high priority i disagree.
---
Grinding gold bullion is literally the only new end-game activity we have.  It's quite literally the only reason to load up the game.  It should just work.  The fact that this is still an issue 2 months after release of wastelanders is absolutely inexcusable.  
---
I haven't been able to buy gold from smiley 4 weeks so far.   This is 1200 bullion I missed out on or 6 extra days I will have to log in and put 20 notes in the machine in my quest to get every single bullion plan, once again, our only current end-game content.
---
It’s beautiful
---
Beat me to it.
---
???
---
The game tells you as soon as you get to level 5...
---
I see, does the bear arms mods drop with one animal alive too?
---
Unicorns don't exist.
---
Bugs and lack of endgame is a better argument than QoL stuff.
---
Ask the wall how you make it load in first
---
Very good point here.  Day to day operation you dont need more than a gatlin gun.
---
Youre kinda correct, but Whitesprings has dedicated spawns. No matter what level you are, you should be getting primarily ghouls with only a few robots at the clubhouse and entrances.
---
Have we always had this challenge? I only just noticed it this week. On the matter of another Bethesda fuck up. I don't know which is worse. This or not fixing the Scorchbeast Queen objective for the "Kill Different Kinda of Tough Enemies" challenge.
---
Wastelanders main quests and side quests were a lot of fun.  The problem is once they are done they are done.  They only added 2 new events to the rotation so you end up playing all the old content over and over just like before.  
---
I have 1100 hours in and I still enjoy it but I am to the point were I have bought nearly all the stuff that interests me with gold bullion.  Unfortunately the end game crafting is time gated by legendary scrip of which you can accumalate only 150-200 per day (which gives 3 or 4 new rolls on items).  This is the real game killer for me.  I have started playing less and less waiting for a new content drop.
---
Good advice. I've done this several times and never completed it. People just run around and do not protect the animals. So frustrating.
---
I think the main issue is how popular bloodied builds are, they are glass cannons that just can’t stand the damage output
---
Depends if your use vats alot.  If you so the 33 can be a great star if not then no.
---
just bring a shiskebab and you are the MVP of any event with friendly npcs. arktos pharma will never fail if you just solo the radkelp area and heal your own friendly animal. hopefully other people do well in their sections too but you can ALWAYS solo the radkelp area to lv3 easily and not "miss out" on anything.
---
Great post! I do want to say one thing though. In survival, the amount of aid dropped was changed because players were dropping hundreds of stims and other items. IE it was totally random amounts and not set. You could lose everything or nothing. Which is bad if you spent your time collecting rare shit (such as Nuka Quantum) for a fight.
---
Honestly I've stayed subbed for the occasional laugh. The amount of people complaining about the shit that made me quit the game indefinitely last year  is almost as amusing to me as the people who keep requesting QoL changes when half of the game is still in a buggy, nightmarish alpha state. That and the absolute torrent of angry posts when something completely breaks is enough entertainment for me to stay subbed
---
This guy gets it..
---
I didn't get a notification about this.
---
Let's not pretend 76 is entirely consistent with its UI...
---
Lucky hole mine with excavator armour on, hornwright testing 3 again with excavator, west tek super mutant guns and drops with scrapper for gunpowder and steel, Tanagra town and abandoned train station in mire for acid. 
---
I will say that unless you wanna do nothing else .50 cal is a bit much for all the time use on ammo. I used it for just big stuff harder fights and the queen and ran other stuff for just wandering. Once you’ve done your first major farming and built up a stock of like 10k it gets easier to just do a quick sweep whenever you’re on to keep it stocked up rather than do a huge effort once a week, but it depends which method you prefer
---
No better than people going to random camps and dropping level 50 legendaries
---
100ish Plasma Casters for a Bloodied Plasma Casters.. and it's not my favorite.. Seems like they programmed the game to give you the opposite of what you want.. Will have to respec for Vanguard/Vampire and see if it drops more Bloodied. Most armor I get is Vanguard.
---
Pretty sure a plain old bandanna works.  Give it a try. The veil of secrets always worked for me too.....must be a bug or something.
---
Sounds like real outstanding members of the community...not
---
Shame you had such a troubled beginning, I hope you found out that not everyone is like that, most of us try to at least help out as much as we can.
---
I make low level items whenever I get chance to in low level areas and leave them in the overseers stashes. I don't upgrade them too much to make it too easy for them, just enough to not spoil the experience and give the player a sense of achievement in levelling
---
Well 20+ vertiberds circling an event location to pick everyone up would probably cause some lag
---
Diffuser plan is not the rarest one.  Bear arm mod plans are the rare ones.  Cause u need to learn bear arm plan for them to even drop.  
---
And im calling bullshit if ur trying to say u get bear arm plan with only 1 animal alive plenty of times.
---
I would explain it as a ,, anti-tutorial screen ,, rage when I was playing alt.  
---
But when I returned, nobody told me about it :/  
---
I remember, I was slaughtered every SCQ fight :D
---
You need to start crafting them.. Here is a helpful link for farming materials.

---
yeah, we have the technology to make this a word :D
---
We can make it one. We have the technology.
---
Someone didn’t read all the responses
---
ive never seen the bear arm mods or stimpack diffuser drop with 1 alive, just the bear arm plan itself.
---
I ran into a level 55 Vengeful mothman and a level 62 charred ghoul hanging out on top of one of those survey towers. It was the single weirdest and scarieest moment of my Fo76 adventures. It was my first encounter with a hostile mothman and it was relatively easy to kill actually.
---
There is something called 'phantom budget' in which say, a turret gets destroyed, but you repair it. It then disappears but still takes budget. This can be solved by placing things like turrets on a rug, and then if the turret ever disappears you can store the rug and it will return the turret to your stored structures tab in the build menu.
---
Yeah I've seen some high-ish levels hanging around The Forest, basically following level 4s around. You likely have enough time when they level up to 5 to kill them before they get a chance to put Pacifist on.
---
Aloofer? Is that even a word?
---
I run 2 accounts at the same time. I get twice as many chances at the drops. I have seen the bear arm plan drop many times but none of the other rare ones when I solo the radkelp area.
---
Thanks for the heads up.  Nothing is every truly fixed in this game.  And if it is, it can always come back later.
---
I'm never using display cases. I just don't trust they'll ever fix it. I've got the Bobblehead display, but those are easy to replace.
---
They're probably needing rid of them because they have so many. They're not going out of their way to craft something someone else can't use. What a great gift. Why not craft Excavator?
---
What is to stop a person from claiming every workshop on the map and not having it contested though?  This would just make people camp all the workshops all the time. I think they need a solution to that problem before they remove pvp from the workshops.
---
Nope
---
For all the people having problems... the workaround is to not enter the Wayward for a full week between purchases. So wait a week since the last time you went in the Wayward, then you can buy your gold.
---
IE: I buy gold on Monday nights at 8pm. Stay out of the Wayward until the next Monday at 8pm. Easy peasy. This workaround has been posted before.
---
It works for me and my friends. We have no problem regularly purchasing gold from Smiley.
---
Someone read all the responses to this chain and not the other one yes. Cheers for the downvote, don't worry I haven't reciprocated despite you making a mistake ;)
---
Did you by chance join a world where your camp couldn't be placed? If you hit "stay" there's a good chance it'll shuffle your vendors and stash boxes. Just wanna rule out this bug.
---
Ok I added to the post. Thanks for clarifying!
---
For me there is no reason that they can solve. I just don't want to PvP in Fallout.
---
Out of curiosity are you a console player or pc?
---
I play PC and nights are as bright as the op mentioned. So bright it looks like a mildly cloudy daytime scene.
---
And no, my monitor brightness has nothing to do with it. This seems like a shader issue and im curious to see what gear the "dark nights" players are using. When the game first loads, there is this very brief moment when i can see the game world with no shaders enabled, then a second or so after, the shaders snap on and everything looks "normal". If that brief moment with no shaders occurs at night on the server im loading into, it looks much MUCH darker than the nights i actually experience once the shaders enable.
---
I dont mind being downvoted for being honest about games. Im the ff7r forum ice lost about 900 karma for mentioning the chucky doll face animations half a dozen times... lol worth it imo
---
Not the mention the budget reduction glitch
---
I trigger Encryptid a LOT. I could give two shits about someone melting him, I want the Event Rewards, not the Legendary Drop.
---
Depends on attendance on levels for most things. If a bunch of 30s and lower show up to SBQ to mooch Event rewards, melt away. They're not going to help anyways. If there's a few heavier hitters with you, or whoever launched the Nuke is there, hang back at the start before you melt, let people get some damage in to get the loot.
---
For my personally, if I can loot the boss, I'm fine with it. Encryptid can be a pain if attendance sucks (and being Bloodied I'm usually doing cover fire from the roof to keep bots off the Conduits) so I d the Event mostly to try and get Fixer Plans to sell for fat stacks.
---
I agree - the tower defense and building aspects of workshops are really fun! But pvp in workshops is heavily biased towards attackers. If they made it so you can only have one workshop at a time it would prevent someone from just taking all of them. I feel like that would be a decent compromise - or at least part of a decent compromise.
---
I’ve seen the bear arm drop many times myself.  But only ONCE with less the 3 alive.  
---
Are u trying to say u see it drop many times with only 1 animal alive?  Cause that’s what I’m calling BS on.  Not that it dropped cause i know it does, but many times?  Naaaa I call BS.
---
Obvious troll post
---
Damn I didn't think you'd be butthurt over a free gift
---
My wife plays. Has a female character. Isn't even using her mic and gets non stop requests. She has a group of friends she'll play with but other than that is into that solo life. These guys trying to friend her don't even know if it's a man or not. It's crazy. 
---
So is it weird to be a man playing a woman? No. I encourage it. Maybe it'll make the creepers simmer down a bit.
---
What's your gamer tag?
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. 
---
I have no idea why you'd think that walking around with *all your junk on you* was a good idea...
---
What if you died just from regularly playing?
---
Clear out your inventory a bit (and pare down your junk too, you don't need a ton of every junk item, just keep the important bits).
---
No, I've not gotten a "camp can't be placed" message at all in the location I'm at now. 
---
I doubt this matters, but you never know - the player who purchased the item had a camp very close to mine (not within bounds but just down the street).
---
Yeah, if his camp is over budget he could be exposed to the stash steal bug.
---
Yeah in the bunker. At least, that’s what I’m working on when needing a big cap sink.
---
A lot of people in the RP server I’m in are like this. Love the setting, but feel the game needs change, so they (mostly) only play it rarely.
---
uhhh it does.
---

---
imagine being one of the five losers who like pvp
---
This happened to me as well.  Whenever i get that message now I just close my game and I haven't had any issues with it since.
---
70s  
---
high five ! :D
---
HOW DARE YOU POST SOMETHING I KIND OF AGREE WITH YOU SEMI REASONABLE HUMAN BEING.
---
I'm not at max budget and haven't used any glitches.
---
Bird Bones, Goat Legs and save a bit of AP for a short burst right before you land and you'll never take fall damage. Honey and coffee are great for AP.
---
What system are you on. I am on Xbox and I too love building on wood generators - but in my case it is because I get most of my money from hunting, and I don't leave the mire much. I have shop called Shallow End Bullets and Booze down the road from you on the shores of the gnarled shallows.
---
Kinda annoying especially if you’re the one who triggers the event. 
---
I was farming encryptid for the fixer plans and sheepsquatch outfit, and the last like 6 times some level 500 turned up and just insta killed it so no rewards off the actual body. 
---
The queen it’s easy enough because theoretically the thing to do would be allow the regen to proc then go to town. That’s usually enough to allow everyone a go.
---
You’ll never stop it though, because now magic weapons are so “common” everyone there is afraid of getting no drops so they all just go to town instantly to outdo anyone else who may destroy it first.
---
 It’s an arms race where mutual fear is causing them to become trivial, and for me even beyond the drops (which are mostly shit anyway) it’s more about the event and experience for me. I like to see level 50-90’s turning up and popping away and feeling like they’re in a fight and it being an experience, I know that’s what I liked more than the rewards, than the triviality of just fast travelling and waiting for the first OP weapon to destroy it and make it kinda meh and boring. 
---
I don’t see how it’s fun after the first time of doing it really, I have a couple of those weapons and I don’t use them at all because it’s boring as fuck honestly and I don’t feel it creates a good experience for anyone, me included.
---
Just shy of 500 hours in about 2 months, if you're a fan of the series you'll get more than your moneys worth. Plenty of bitching and moaning about the game but i think because the launch  went so badly the complaining has just snowballed and no one will ever be satisfied.
---
Yea I could care less... if I wanted to make the video games I would be doing that for a career we pay plenty of money for the software and add ons. Should be free of issues... I can’t play this game for 8 hours eveyday like some people so when I am able to get on I would like to be able to compete things and collect what I need to, I get the end game needs to be a bit of a grind but when you are talking months to get something it’s a joke.
---
Yeah that's a great point. I'd be okay if it only forces the PvP while you are in the workshop zone. So you have the choice to forfeit or fight. As of now you can be hunted anywhere on the map just for claiming a workshop. That's what should really change.
---
Probably would be best to limit the workshops then, say a player can only have 1 at a time. Though they should still be contested for those who want/need that workshop. Perhaps make a contest they gotta participate in, who ever kills the most ghouls wins or who ever if the first to die in a ghoul swarm attack loses
---
4 things:
---
1. They need an arena in adventure mode for people that want to pvp.  Give it different modes like 1:1, 2:1, etc. and maybe be able to suppress certain things like mutations, aid, etc.  This could all be agreed upon before commencing battle.  Add in cool rewards to entice people to play.  Give it a Raider feel mimicking the Roman Coliseum of old.
---
2. They need new teams and color codes for the upcoming team mechanics patch.  Create a team that is pvp and gets boosts from being in said group. Being in a "pvp group" makes you susceptible to pvp at any time.  Also making the player names color coded would be great.  Green=pacifist, Yellow=non-pacifist, Red=enemy.  This would help pvp'ers and pve'ers identify each other more easily.
---
3. I don't think separating the servers is a good idea.  It just didn't work well with survival in my opinion.  It just made the whole server/map a pvp battle which I think would work better in an arena. Part of the problem is trying to find others that want to pvp and having a condensed area would help alleviate some of these issues.
---
4. They need to work on NW a lot more.  I don't care for pvp games all that much but I do enjoy my time with NW when I'm working on getting the rewards.  They really need some new maps and game modes that change things up a bit.  Capture the flag, 1 vs. everyone, etc.  Zax should be testing our abilities to be Overseer in more than just team battle royale.
---
What? That still hasn't been fixed?
---
my only exception so far is the white tux, got a pure luck, intel and charisma character whos is dressed for gambling, soon as vault slot machines come into camps from the vault-tec dlc from FO4 he's running a themed camp :P
---
i mean his luck is high so i just make it out to be he was lucky his suit survived the bombs
---
I've always advocated for this, but continually got downvoted by the hordes of people running full god tier gear, and "legitimately gained" thousands of stealthboys/chems.
---
I had always been of the mind that in PvP all legendary stats should be negated. Even stat buffs too
---
I'm guessing he happened to be at your camp as it was loading which gave him access to your stash. Good thing he didnt clear you out!
---
New characters should start as pacifist from the get go and have a pop up or something show up to keep it or change it once you leave the vault or something. Either that or read up on some of the "seperation of servers into pve and pvp server" posts. :)
---
It has not.
---
check my post history. 3000 hour player with many many characters.
---
Aw man, an arena where you could bet caps to see what monster wins?  
---
That'd be awesome.
---
For real, folks in this thread are getting downvoted for saying they like pvp and want it improved...and that maybe the pve players aren't the ones with the best suggestions for how to do that.
---
I'm mostly a pve player but what I've learned from my pvp friends is that if you want pvp success, you have to actually have a pvp build. You can't just have all quality of life perks and expect to perform as well as a finely optimized build. 
---
I think what OP is suggesting is great... separate servers would make the most amount of players happy. Pve players aren't going to be enticed into pvp while the pvp crowd is completely neglected by Bethesda.
---
This is True. On my last 2 characters ive created i am attacked all The time until i reach lvl 40-50. All of a sudden they stop showing up.
---
And they dont stop until you either fast travel away or just let them kill you. Had a guy chase me around a pole for probably 10 minutes, was pretty fun actually
---
Is this a known bug or speculation?
---
I have the one star auto stim perk under agility (I forget what its called) it helps so that way you dont have to worry about popping stims yourself as much. I personally dont like the nighttime perk you have but I'm not a stealth build and I dont find the card cost to be worth it if it's only effective half the time. As for your rads/health. Definitely should keep it around 25-30% that way you have enough health for your auto stim to go off the moment you get hit and then rely on serendipity for the rest of the fight, you might need to manually pop stims but you do so much damage it won't matter especially with a sneak build
---
I think they changed that mechanic.  I don't believe you can be attacked unless you are in the pvp zone right now.
---
What if the workshops were actually worth fighting over?  Like maybe they produced way more stuff or gave you complete items similar to the way the ammo factory works or the food factory.  Would that promote more organic pvp by having something that isn't useless?
---
Time to get the big iron
---
This old thread just saved me, or have they fixed it yet?
---
I'm outraged! I want to speak to your manager.
---
Yes - you are horrible.  A bad person.  Give me that gun right now and all is forgiven.
---
;)
---
I would max out concentrated fire if you're commando. Its  currently bugged and giving 20% accuracy per shot at rank 3 instead of the advertised 3%. Also, I'd drip adrenaline down to 1 and add 1 point of gun fu as well. Maybe swap travel agent for lvl 1 tenderizer as well for even more damage. 
---
You should be at 19% hp to benefit from nerd Rage and to maximize the damage from adrenal reaction and your bloodied weapon. You'll also get the max stats from your unyielding armor at that point as well.
---
I could crush ghouls all day every day with the build I have as could most people once you get high enough level.  
---
I do think potentially limiting it to 1 workshop might work.  But then you may end up server hopping endlessly to get your preferred spot.
---
Hopefully Bethesda is looking at this a bit more.
---
I really cannot emphasize enough how much scrapper perk upped my ammo production. Guns give so much steel where before I was always starving to get a batch made.
---
Also, OP, don’t overlook gunpowder in containers and being carried by super mutants. It does take some strain on the acid supplies to make gunpowder.
---
No one is asking you to play 8 hours a day. We are asking that you do a little digging before you whine on a forum.
---
Seriously. How hard is it to stay out of the Wayward for 7 days before buying gold again? I found that answer with a forum search.
---
That seems like a lot of time and money invested. Did u buy all three systems to specifically test this game?
---
Couldn't* care less
---
That I'm not sure about. Had someone attack me at my workshop but I was about to do something else so whatever. Didn't care and I took off. They followed me to an event and were still able to openly attack me. Made me and a group of lower levels fail.
---
Smart-ass lmao
---
Hmm good point, in that case in such challenges legendaries should have their effects nullified to level the playing field and make it both fair for the players involved
---
to be clear, all base weapons (like shot guns) will still be in the purveyor. You cannot make an alt and learn only the fixer to get only fixers to show up. But yes, if by not learning other plans that trigger more items in the purveyor you are limiting the pool
---
It was new, I think with wastlanders. The missions for atoms are quite shot
---
Well to be fair, If you finished the story... We all responders, raiders, brotherhoods, free states, enclave, settlers and raiders 2.0
---
I threw grenades at every cool display case in Whitespring. Managed to not aggro bots! But nothing popped out of the case, sadly
---
1. Go Nerd Rage levels or don't bother, imo. A good set of Uny and Nerd Rage will save you from most hits that Serendipity don't dodge. Try and lock down an Armored Backpack Mod too.
---
2. I use regular Stims for the bigger initial recovery burst. I carry Diluted Rad-X so my mutations aren't affected. I keep both RadAway and Diluted RadAway with me. Regular in case I'm really in the shit and need more health. Diluted for management. I also carry a couple of Toxic Goo with me if I die and need to bring my Rads back to Nerd Rage levels.
---
Chinese Stealth is your new Nuke Zone protection. That's only when I use it. Try and lockdown a High-Capacity Backpack mod for when you have this on as you'll lose a shit-ton of Carry Weight with the loss of your Unyielding effects.
---
Get rid of Mister Sandman and up Sneak to 3. Especially for Commando where the range is shorter than Rifleman. Staying Hidden for them Sneak Bonuses is key.
---
Armor Perks depending, Bandolier 2 might be unnecessary. I run Bandolier 1 and Traveling Pharmacy 1. Dealer's choice really, but I carry about 2000 rounds of 45 and 2000 rounds of 556 with me but one piece of my armor reduces Ammo weight and with all the Unyielding and Radicool, I have MORE than enough carry weight for my aid and ammo.
---
Maybe swap Travel Agent for Tenderizer 1. Especially for Commando, that first round will have the Sneak Bonus, the rest should have the 5% bonus (though I've heard this Perk doesn't work).
---
Beta player with 5 toons. What’s ur point?
---
Weird. I thought they patched that out a long time ago.  
---
So a team would get together and have 1 person go to the workshop and start claiming. The other teammate would go to the player who owned it and wait. Once it was contested it opened you up to pvp anywhere on the map and people got crabby and rightfully so.
---
A little of both? It got a lot of attention because it was brought up by a prominent community member. No one has really been able to substantiate it though.
---
On sbq fight I would say yes unless it’s been going on for 10-15 mins, or you launched the nuke. Depending on where the nuke was placed it could take 30 seconds to run to the fight just to watch it get melted. Encripted I say melt away. 
---
But you do you.
---
Yes! I do this too.  I keep my camp's bathroom locked so when I got to the bathroom, I go to the bathroom.
---
You've got some good stuff!
---
Good points. I hadn't really thought about it before last night but doing it back to back kind of made it feel hollow and not fun. On the queen I'll definitely try to hang back. You're right, though... when she lands and everyone starts blasting it's hard to even tell if you're melting her or someone else it.
---
You could free up 2 perk points from fireproof by running a torso dense mod.
---
Nope but as far as I know they will add mods with patch 20 to buy
---
Thank you for writing this 👍
---
Awesome
---
HeHe, cheers bud! Enjoy, sorry for being a grump!
---
Yeah, there's been a bunch of times on Encryptid that I've dumped a ton of ammo and still failed so it's harder for me to hold back there. 
---
From now on I think I'll focus more on crowd control for at least five minutes or so.
---
I should pay more attention to who launched the nuke, also.
---
There should be a spot for everyone no matter how you play. The problem is the people aren't doing PvP. They are ganging up on people to rob them or destroy their camp. It's not PvP players, it's assholes hassling people. So yeah these people make the PvE crowd hate all things PvP. Not fair to the non asshole players who just want a game mode that appeals to them.
---
Only sour crybabies. No real loss there.. 🥺😁
---
Hello, when you've submitted your report on the support website with these details included, could you send me your ticket number?
---
Additionally I'll send this forward to see if this is something known, new, or otherwise. Thank you!
---
It's worth it to keep a set just for the imposter imo. The other stars and armor type don't matter, just troubleshooter. Between the prefix and the blocker, lone wanderer and fire proof perks you're taking very little damage from the imposter and the horde, especially if you stay close to the imposter. That way she only attacks with melee and her short range flame attack. Use cola nut or first aid/ field surgeon to buff your healing as you'll need big bursts to heal through the pylon damage. If you do, it's pretty easy to run the event solo.
---
I use a troubleshooter dcg to fight her, just because you can buff melee so high even at full health. But any weapon will do, so long as you keep her visible and stay on your feet. 
---
Last bit of advice, I don't die often but when I do and I've got all 3 pylons, I just punch out immediately, come back and take them again. That way I don't have to worry about other people killing the imposter while I'm down waiting for a revive which might not come.
---
Hmm if we're talking about the same bug, maybe that person had the stolen items on display at some point, unless they were cleared out completely.
---
Sorry if that's just a mess to read, I'm at work. But you should know if something big sneaks up on you and you get hit you will die as a bloodied build dont get frustrated it's a part of it
---
Or they don’t like certain aspects of the game and wish they would change or get fixed.
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76).[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
my point is that ive solod this event enough times to learn the bear arm on every character and have some to spare but I still havent seen a stimpack diffuser. one friendly animal will get a bear arm.
---
Pacifist does stop all damage both ways unless the player is wanted. That is a rare occurrence and very very easily avoided and they are changing the team tagging.
---
I don’t blame people. Honestly for a lot of folks it’s just a formality they want over as fast as possible for the rewards. I bear no real ill will to people who do that stuff but it’d be nice if they considered others the odd run through. 
---
As fast as I’m concerned though, if you do the silo/pay for the recall card do what ya like, if you turn up to help them maybe just give it a min or whatever. It’s not like any decent build is ever in real danger of dying at the queen fight in particular so hanging about for like 5 mins isn’t the worst hardship when someone else did the work.
---
It still seems to happen. This was just two days ago. Unless I'm the lucky victim of some loophole.
---
Awesome! Glad you found the info useful!
---
Yup. Bloodied is Risk vs Reward. Get Serendipity and pray. Auto-Stim is not worth it to me. You either dodge, survive, or die.
---
I have two different apps that give the locations, or you could use this site:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_locations_(Fallout_76)
---
Agreed 100%. These people who don't agree are the ones who have never had it happen to them.
---
Here's how Bethesda fucked up Survival mode:
---
1. Allowed players to xfer characters from Adventure.  
---
2. Failed to ban cheaters, dupers, and hackers.  
---
3. Made people visible on the minimap.  
---
4. Failed to make fast travel locations sanctuaries.  
---
They purposely broke the mode and then used negative player sentiment as an excuse to get rid of it.
---
Can't remember the last time I had to craft gunpowder.  Loot so much from ammo containers that even after crafting a few thousand rounds I still have something like 600 more left in reserve.  By the next time I have to craft it will be restocked again.
---
you have been given some very good suggestions to optimize your build..
---
Ye "I want pvp coz my guys basically god" and they wonder why nobody wants to play xD
---
You're fine. You're not really reaping the full benifits of bloodied unless you're under 20% health (nerd rage threshold), but you're still dealing increased damage at 60% health and below.
---
 I find dirty water an easy and readily available source for rads. Don't worry about toxic goo, the weight and time getting it, aren't worth it, IMO.
---
Stick with diluted radaway and diluted stims. I dilute everything, and my bloodied main is actually a good source of unused stims/radaway for my alts.
---
With a dense mod on your torso armor, you can drop fireproof to 1 star, or drop it altogether for something else. I run 3 adamantium, 1 radicool vs ghouls and other melee mobs, but swap those three point around as needed.
---
Marsupial &gt; dodgy/evasive. The only mitigation perk I run is Serendipity, just make sure you're not trying to go toe to toe with gutsies, minigun mutants, crickets, or ghoul packs. Elevation and cover are your best defense.
---
Pics or it didn't happen.
---
Mine never spun
---
5 point on Gunsmith is generally not needed. Just run a few queens for a stock of advanced repair kits that take your weapon to 150%
---
Can't add much other than what's been said here, but the Bird Bones mutation gives you an extra 50ap &amp; increased sneak, and Aligned mods for your rifle reduces AP cost per shot. It'll let you get many more hits in. If you haven't learned the mods yet, most gun wielding enemies drop combat rifles to scrap
---
No...let pvp die, remove it completely so we never have to hear this unwanted argument again.
---
Please Bethesda, spend your time fixing the multitudes of other problems.
---
There is no way to bring it back, it was fucked up when they let the pvp trolls have free run and permanently gave pvp players in this game a horrible rep, Which they deserved from what I've seen in 3900 hours since 2018.
---
I say take it out all the way and be done with it for good. Spend resources fixing and developing some new content that doesn't get old and repetitive after 2 weeks.
---
Pvp does not need to be a part of this game EVER again.
---
Water wheel is supposed to be fixed with patch 20 but we will see.
---
Upvoted for a solid sensible idea, I don't PVP much in f76 but I have no issue with it and I can't argue with anything you've suggested. 
---
Every other game runs separate servers for PVP, I see no reason why they can't do it here as well.
---
Can I ask what your graphic settings/system you use?
---
Just out of curiosity, what do you think Pacifist Mode does?
---
Imagine how many times you didnt even see him creeping on you...
---
Did they kill you?
---
Im not denying that.  Its the plenty of times remark.  With less the 3 the odds are greatly reduced.  So I hard time believing U get it plenty of times solo with 1 animal alive.  
---
Me and my crew farm this a lot, all 3 alive all the time and it’s so rare to get bear arm plans still. We get them but i wouldn’t use term a lot.   Hell I’ve gotten more stimpack diffuser plans then bare arm plans myself.
---
I just sent them a message warning about doing stuff like that. I invited them to dump their junk in my box (oooh matron) before someone whacked them and took it. 
---
I would have done it myself but that would involve turning pacifist off.
---
*\*lights up flamethrower\** Can't. Resist. Temptation.
---
GJ! Nice shop, woodworker!
---
Store your vendors.
---
Go buy out a ton of ammo from player vendors and/or go buy serum recipes. I always end up stocking up on ammo and plans.
---
It was pretty fun but I hated so many of the mechanics.  The leader boards showing your exact location were stupid.  Why couldn't it have been a decent sized search circle or something?  It would have been fun setting up traps and such.  
---
I was around level 200 at the time and every time I got killed I would lose 400 caps.  That sucked too. I just wanted it 1 cap per level until level 76, meaning at level 200 I would lose 76 caps per death.  It also wouldn't completely ruin a low level who got killed. 
---
I think limiting camps and adding more players into the servers would have been good too.  Maybe even give people a survival tent that you can place once every 15 minutes instead of a camp.  Make you use the workshops and workbenches you find out in the world.  This way they could add like 50 people to the map making it feel a lot more dense.
---
Console, xbox specifically - you're thinking the lower processing power means we're not getting the issue causing shaders? If I follow correctly, pc gaming is something I know nothing about lol. Interestingly unlike most games on the xbox Fo76 doesn't seem to have brightness options in the menu (unless I'm being a moron)
---
I'm on PC with a GTX 1050, I can't see shit at night.
---
It's fine. I can see the flaw in the idea but hey, if the person has damn good power armor at level 40 that can help farm the SBQ and get plans and legendaries, its something to do
---
It’s the same damage as a hardened reliever and ammo is more expenive. You just get bonus damage to scorched on top
---
I wouldn't even mind missing out on the NW cosmetics if there was a seperate PvE mode with equally cool rewards. Give the PvE players a mode to grind as well, an' everyone should be satisfied.
---
But I absolutely agree with just seperating PvP and PvE servers.
---
Shit, for real? I have to redo this whole thing 😖
---
&gt; they just don’t know it
---
I believe I said that in my first post, and you took issue with it.
---
[Whatever they say.](https://images.wikidexcdn.net/mwuploads/wikidex/thumb/0/03/latest/20170617010358/Ditto.png/200px-Ditto.png)
---
From a purely role playing standpoint, I agree that fast travel doesn't make sense. But for someone like me, this game would impossible to play without it. That said, I do think it should drain your resources in some way.
---
the games need to evolve. they removed survival servers. but didn't update any of the PVE files to remove the PVP guns and armor. what is the point of having assassins gear if you can't attack players? 
---
and survival servers had a leader board. why? just so it could pinpoint me so i became fallouts most wanted? this alone was the reason i stopped playing no matter if i was actively hunting players or just building my camp. if ou were on long enough you became the #1 person on the server. this was moronic and it let you know where to avoid people as you knew where they were. you want to revamp survival servers thats your #1 fix. 
---
 \#2 automatic defense systems. nothing killed me more then a forest death camp. out of the blue a missile blows you to fallout jesus. all the camp is is AI weapons and a guy hiding inside foundation blocks. so no camps. you want to survive. find a work bench.
---
\#3 earn pvp points in survival. so i dont have to be a bush wookie. i can quest i can farm i can hunt players . its very deserving. and if you dont want to flip the dime. i will let me rent a server and set the rules. open to all who wise to enter.
---
but they wont fix it they dont care. i miss survival servers. was a fin diffrent change of pace.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f154fe&amp;d=s01p02pg2ph2pi2pp2eu0c72cu0ir2ic0a80ar2an2ao0a51a12a01lt2lu1la2lv2l71lg0&amp;m=51c2fe8 I run something similar to this, and it works pretty well. Also survability it's high enought if you don't rush like a crazy elephant (1 or 2 stims in a SBQ, and you can solo nuke silos in 10-15 min). I also run with 4 uny pieces + 1 lifesaving (this one it's very important, you wont regret it), just be sure majors and minors minors have, at least, 2 pieces of AP regen, one of reduced falling dmg (very important this one T_T), and others with WWR, so you can carry more stuff
---
to avoid this problem I'm using this strategy
---
1 place the camp
---
2 go away and teleport to your camp
---
3 mark where you gonna spawn
---
4 make the vendor away from that spot with some construction on the way to them and make them high, so far no one Rob me again.
---
I have an epic image of the Scorchbeast trying to fly 'through' the 'squatch, and it grabbing both wings and basically slamming the thing down. God I wish those fights were conematic.
---
I’m really enjoying it, I just stopped playing to finish far cry 5. I bought a bunch of games when the quarantine started, and now I’m swamped. This is my first online game, really, so it’s a fun change from the single players I’m used to. And I love the building.  The story is interesting too. I’m trying to piece together what they had in mind before the big Wastelanders expansion, and it feels like it would have been really dark and lonely if you didn’t have a team to play through it with.
---
I earn treasury notes faster than I spend them I'm at 300+now, wish they would raise or scrap the daily billon limit
---
Appreciate someone posting positively about PvP. I mainly PvE now but used to enjoy PvP more (I do still play NW though). Totally agree with your main point that there shouldn't be incentives to try to get otherwise uninterested PvE players to join in. As much as I would love the return of survival mode but without legendaries or something else more nuanced like that, I think your suggestion to just have separated PvE and PvP servers would be the easiest to implement. Meaning maybe there's a chance of that happening.
---
But given the track record so far and the recent statement regarding players not being interested in PvP, I'm not going to get my hopes up.
---
as they say.. you cant fix stupid...
---
All weapons should have multiple skins by now, it's just so shitty they've not bothered.
---
I like many aspects of this game yet I can't fall in love with it. There's just too many flaws in it that keep me from wanting to waste more time on it. The main flaw being that there's just not much end game content. Also that whenever I play with friends I'm disappointed by the lack of fun multiplayer content.
---
Update 20, in theory, fixes them.
---
Pacifist mode - it should prevent me entering PvP via - deal dmg to players and initiate PvP.  
---
While I was fighting SBQ ( you know how messy it gets ) I tend to hit players, non intentionally, ofc.
---
I think there's a lot of QOL improvements to be made but I was willing to tough it out because I enjoyed it.
---
The bullet sponge enemies are what caused me to stop.  Having to create around 500 rounds of more to use all in one firefight was too much for me.
---
But I still like this game so I pop in every once in a while just to see what the state of the game is.  I'm sure I'll play it again in the future, especially if they fix the bullet sponge enemies issue.
---
there is a popup when you reach PVP level..
---
the only way another player can kill you is with explosive bait...
---
Yes, I would come back if they did this. Please.
---
Word I didn’t see this last night but I’ll be on Iater today.
---
Definitely is!
---
One issue with splitting PvP and PvE is that it strains resources.  Every gal or guy you have monkeying around with PvP balance is one who's ignoring some of the glaring PvE balance issues.  Content developed for PvP is less content for PvE.  You end up half-assing both.
---
It may be necessary to acknowledge that has a PvP game, FO76 is lousy.  They can keep trying to force it, but they're never going to get something that's going to nurture more than a handful of diehards who like the branding.  At least they're slowly but surely removing the griefing opportunities, which as far as I can tell seems to be a lot of the purpose of PvP mechanics at this point.
---
Are you on PC? I have a hefty amount of regular .50 I can give you at no cost what so ever :)
---
I've swapped to Ultracite .50 and don't need my stock of regular anymore.
---
Let me know :)
---
I saw one long time ago but he ran. But couple months before wastelanders i finally got one and killed him outside the fence of whitesprings then I saw more and more. Then when wastelanders came out they’re even more being the mothman cult. There’s so many different ones so you gotta make sure you have one that attacks. And if you want a photo do it quick they turn into ash
---
Well the helmet itself is not a gas mask. It is just a mask. Unless it is hooked to an scba it it just eye covering. While a gas mask has a filter that is part of the mask itself
---
Just if we are getting technical.
---
I do agree it would be nice if it was a gas mask though
---
Are you on PC? I’d love to check out your camp
---
Caps not worth anything anymore and already have bear arm plan and ammo
---
It was part of the recent twitch bundle.
---
Ou believe me mate, ive seen my fair share too, at this point i doubt anyone is able to surprise me. In games or otherwise... 
---
If anything, i learned to underestimate everyone in online from the start, that way i get to be pleasantly surprised once in a while...
---
In my experience it helps a lot and has made me half worth something in pvp as a non stealth bloodied build (I run heavy)
---
12k will sell quick on vendor. 15-18k for more profit but probably not as quick selling
---
Yep, same fears. Thankfully if the item displayed has an atom shop skin on it, it won’t be available for other players .
---
Yes I've seen it done.
---
The way I see it, those two events are more about the event reward then the drop itself from the boss.  So I could care less about instant melting on those events.  
---
If I get the tag i get the tag.
---
my dislike of the raiders is only surpassed by my distaste for the settlers.. they are way bigger assholes IMO..
---
that said.. I wish the game allowed many more NPC from both factions to be shot in the face to death than they do...
---
Definitely hasn't been like that since, and even at that moment it was mostly funny (until about five minutes in) and they dispersed pretty quickly. Game community has been fairly chill overall.
---
It's not that deep.
---
I disagree OP, separation of servers is not the answer. You are correct that Bethesda is at fault here, but you're missing the mark I think.   
---
PVP was destroyed before the game ever went live because of legendary gear, perk loadouts, mutations, and consumables. There was never going to be an even ground that a fight could happen on under these game systems as they are between the casual PVE player and even a casual PVP player.   
---
If this were fixed, and PVP changed to be more of an even keel I think you would see more interest from the casual PVE crowd dabbling in PVP.
---
i like to see all the "bethesda please" posts
---
and then i try to imagine why people make such posts when bethesda isnt going to do anything about it, so it's pretty much an attention seeking post.
---
which leads me to imagine what kinda life they have led, which made them try and seek online gratifying approval for their internal opinions. were they not loved as children? were their parents too harsh? was it because of their teachers, not complimenting them when they needed it?
---
then i start thinking about how school education is like in my country, how young kids are going through a rigorous streaming process that will determine the course of your life at 10-12 years old. if they do well in school, they generally have an easier time in life because most kids with good education have better job opportunities and better earning power for a higher quality of life.
---
but what about the kids who can't afford to go to school? or nations where the kids are neglected because of culture? would they even have access to the internet, something that Elon Musk's spacex is trying to do, which is to provide global internet coverage whereever you are?
---
then i think about technology and nuclear tech, and what would happen if a war really did break out between china and the US, that would mean nuclear war, and total devastation, we could be living in a wasteland 5 years from now.
---
so, i stay on this sub, for post apocalyptic tips. like how to go to the whitespring's sulfur fountain to cure covid19.
---
Any decontamination arch. Overseer garage? Don't remember honestly.
---
start with forums at this site
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76)
---
Which platform do you use?
---
The bonking sound near the start was enough, I couldn't stop laughing, had to watch the rest. Worth it.
---
&gt;and survival servers had a leader board. why?
---
This completely destroyed my interest in survival servers, a mode I was very much excited about until it became obvious the mode had nothing to do with survival.
---
Make the workshop revert to unowned if not defended.  If somebody wants to spend literally every minute of their play time defending workshops more power to them.  It wouldn't be the norm I think.
---
Looting one container no matter how many items are in it only adds one item (the container) to the 255 item stack or recently looted items
---
That doesn't really negate the points I made
---
Raiders stealing from the weak? Sounds like fallout 2 me
---
What you missing mate? I have most of the common/uncommon spare I think.
---
Alright, carry on.
---
Yeah I didn't mean like it would literally be a gas mask I just meant the resistance to environmental effects, if a bandana can do it I think the fireman helmet could do it too
---
People need to realize that not every game has to do everything. The game already struggles with having updates on time. The more effort that's put into assisting the incredibly small amount of people that want to pvp in the adventure mode, the longer everything takes. If you want to pvp, just go play nuclear winter or play another game. The most reasonable situation here, imo, is to just let people set their private servers to pvp if they want. Done. Anyone who joins the private server is PVP engaged.

Because China has great cultural confidence per Present Xi?
---
those mutations they are like chems? like they have time? or are permanent? I got one from a fight but it just stayed up for 1 hour
---
Fyi sleek doesnt stack with speed demon, so you can easily go double cushioned. Learned this the hard way myself.
---
I like pvp lol
---
Good post.  
---
Unfortunately at the end of the day no matter what you do will still eventually become allies with both factions if you do the daily's.  
---
It should have had three options in my opinion. Hostile, Friendly, and Neutral.
---
Hostile means you are attacked on sight and can't buy anything from said faction.
---
Friendly means you accepted and still have tiers to achieve for the highest rank of purchasable items.
---
Neutral.  Accepted by both but not able to buy the higher tier, stuff, ever.
---
Check the suitcases in train stations whenever you're in one, plenty of us leave free chems/ammo/plans in there.
---
I played a hunter/hunted event few weeks back.
---
I won and got a default (non legendary) lvl 15 light leather left leg .... im lvl 250
---
Read the description of that setting. "Other players can still murder you."

It seems odd to only add one new lifetime challenge. I did recently complete the challenge for collecting 76 player bounties. Seems an odd choice to unlock that challenge though. Thing is, when I noticed it, I thought the objective were broken like the queen, because some of the missions weren't completed that I have done plenty of times. Mistaken Identity is the only one left for now. So, the challenge itself must have not been availably until this week for me, which is the same as the OP mentioning it.
---
Why can’t PA be a freaking tank. Should have more DR and more carry weight(at least double what it is). We also need legendary prefixes for it. 1 or 2 stars only. Hell I’ll even take a PA backpack type mod(similar to the mods we get for actual backpacks)
---
When bethesda can finish their game (how about regular new weapon releases, mods for all weapons, some of which have 0, bugfixes x1000) PVP would be OK, it requires so much effort just to balance. 
---
Until then, PVE players know that you're never going to get a solid PVP experience so why bother. Don't waste resources on something that is hamstrung from the start.
---
Thievery punished by death? When the Raider offers caps, it's an attempt to make Foundation whole again by allowing them to replace the object that was found. 
---
And you'd have to accept what the Weaver of Lies himself, Ward, says about the equipment's origin. Daguerre gets intel on new equipment via radio scanner, it's possible Ward does the same, and the raider just beat them to the punch.
---
I have a j 33 HM 2 \* as my back up/ farming and it rocks.  i rarely miss with it.
---
Honestly I think its just because of the sheer number of folks who do all of that and *are* still guys, its usually a safer bet. But that reaction of 'oMg uR a GuRl?!' is so stupid too, like yes, now move along.
---
he reset for me the other day. 
---
probably took over 3 weeks.
---
You get locked out from buying it if you don’t buy it at a certain time. 
---
I think you can only buy it on Sunday and Monday. Even if you didn’t buy it that week and try to buy it on Tuesday or days afterward, he’ll just say check back next week.
---
I'm aware. Though a bandana actually covers your mouth and nose. While a fire fighters mask dose not. Unless hooked to an scba. Just being obnoxiously technical. As someone very familiar with a fire fighters gear haha
---
They are fine. Since they were last fixed dont take one persons account as happening all the time when they cant replicate it. Its getting to a point where if you cant replicate something, you shouldnt say shit.   
---
Reporter: "I had this one thing happen this one time out of nowhere."  
---
Tech: "Well what were you/ did you do?"  
---
Reporter: "Nothing out of the ordinary."   
---
Tech: "Ok we'll look into it. ::deletes conversation::"  
---
What needs to happen is:  
---
Reporter: "I emoted twice, turned around three times, fast traveled, jumped five times then died and it happened."   
---
Unless a tech knows an inkling of how whatever it was happened, theyre in the dark and youre asking them to perform a miracle.
---
As do I. I'll gladly pay to have just the server and the atoms. Make the scrapbox available to all and put the tent behind a Pioneer Scoitd quest line like they did with the larger backpack. In the meantime, I have a note above the scrapbox at my camp telling low levels to message me if they need camp help, gear, or things like that. If you're high level and don't have many plans unlocked or are just short on scrap for something, I'll also help out there too.
---
That's really what I was picturing since before this game. Spawn as a raider/vault dweller/fiend/etc. with nothing and find stuff, just like DayZ or Rust. No massive amounts of health. If you die, you lose everything and spawn anew. 
---
I just don't enjoy a system that you have to boil down to an exact science and spend hours researching and creating a perfect PVP spec. Not to mention however long it takes to RNG the perfect weapon. Boring. The things I shoot at should die, and I should die when being shot.
---
Only PA skin I bought was the nuka shine since T-51 is my fav and its all I wear lol
---
None that I've found. If you have enough of the flux on hand you actually get a higher yield per craft of Ultracite ammo than ballistic ammo. Have slowly been priming all my ranged weapons as I accumulate enough flux to keep them fed and haven't looked back.
---
That PVP kids usually blow up low levels because they cant kill other players. I remember to blow a few that where showing their BE legacy gatlings.... just with a gamma Gun and a pipe rifle 😂
---
Thank you, I sent you the ticket number.
---
Exactly. I drop bags for people on a regular basis and really don't want them to be suddenly marked as wanted because I gave them a gift.
---
I bought the game and played maybe 20 minutes of it and went back to NV and 4. I love the Fallout universe so I stay here for the updates. Maybe I'll go back to 76 some day but right now, I'm perfectly content with just playing 4 for the 90 millionth time.
---
Do you really think that thievery is the least of their crimes?  In your post you mention the blood eagles who are known to be some of the most vicious and evil raiders in the wastes.  How many innocents have they robbed and raped and killed?   
---
Either way this is a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  There are no courts of law or justice department.  You wrong a party and they will retaliate.  Stealing something and then offering up some measly caps as a replacement just because you got caught.  They had no intention of paying until they got caught.  
---
It feels weird even having this discussion because it really isn't that deep lol.  It's just a daily designed to be a way to occupy a few minutes of your time to deliver you treasury notes.
---
To be fair. I run a bloodied build on my alt and I have them perched on the fence or cabin (fence for the queens dusting only) and (cabin for when I’m near the sheep’s beam. Doesn’t hit me but I always die when I’m close proximity)
---
Monster mash is purely pvp event what do you want to just run around and gather candy by your self
---
Ha ha dude, that’s awesome!!
---
No joke on lmgs.  I have an AA FFR one that is super fun to use but it had been in my stash for 150 levels because I wasn't going to prime it and regular 308 crafting is terrible.  Finally unlocked the ammo machine and set it to 308 and now I'm actually able to use the thing once in a while.  The regular one eats ammo fast enough, adding FFR makes it just stupid, but the gun is too fun to use for me to get rid of it.
---
This is why I stopped making nice camps. I like to move a lot and it just got annoying.  
---
I use a 2x2 floor for all my stuff and another 2x2 floor for my vendors now.  Never had a problem again.
---
I love it. I built a sky high “dollar store”. Everything is one cap. It sure is fun to make a unique shop for people to enjoy.
---
I dont deny that.  
---
But it prevents most of PvP griefing.
---
I think raising or changing the limits isnt going to do much in the long run other than change the windows within which people complain about limits.. 
---
it will never be enough...
---
!delta
---
I had entirely forgotten about the state-sponsored torture the Blood Eagles did with Weasel. Screw them.
---
" I suspect this may already have been raised,"
---
Oh really???  You don't say!
---
The separation of PvP and PvE servers is the most simple solution and like many other basics Bethesda seems to not understand. 
---
I think as far as the Cola's go they should just get rid of the Cola Nut perk, that would help a lot. Then it wouldn't be any "better/worse" than than spamming Super Stims in Power Armor.
---
lmfao fair enough xD
---
No...no...you buy.
---
The scrip limit is easily my least favorite "mechanic" in the game.  The purveyor used to be a bonus to get a few more legendary rolls per day.  Now with vault steel and modules being the endgame crafting method it sucks horribly.
---
\-They need to up the daily scrip limit to 500.  This would allow myself and others more time to grind and build new sets, not log off in disgust each day.
---
It would also be a great cap sink for players who are going to buy junk legendaries for scrip.  Think about all the caps that would disappear (along with legendaries)!
---
People would have way more stash space and not have to play inventory management simulation all dang day.
---
I've definitely talked to him once in between resets because I couldn't remember if I bought on Saturday or Sunday.  Went the next day and bought from him no problem but since then I go every Sunday and that's it.
---
Maybe I just got lucky or the bug only happens randomly if you go there.  Not really sure.
---
Interesting
---
Uranium Fever is amazing.  
---
If that isn't going just run Westec.
---
The scrapper perk makes a huge difference.
---
HAHA I was just scrolling through thinking "why do I stay subbed here?" This is exactly why. I have the game taking up space on my hard drive even but I RARELY even load into it, and usually I do for about 5 minutes and it has either crashed by then or I'm already bored.
---
Pacifist doesnt stpp you from being hit, just hitting
---
Tbh im on console too and i also cant see shit
---
I mean, its a blessing for certain but only cause it gives you cores at all, only issue is the gatling laser doesnt load then next lowest charged core...if it did, id have no complaints honestly
---
YEah... actually the event is pretty challenging without PvP if you ask me. So I don't see why it needs to be PvP anyways. Make it PvP in a PvP server but I don't see a problem with a PvE version being in a PvE server. IT doesn't need PvP for challenge.
---
Well, it's not rare, it's a static spawn on Roachie (the radroach). This scene you came across is Bethesda's nod to Monster Factory's Final Pam from fallout 4!
---
I agree 100%! 500 would be perfect too, giving you the option to buy 10 modules a day (or however many vault steel or legendaries you’d want) and give you what would feel like a fair shot at getting decent legendary rolls in building all these new plans from Wastelanders. 
---
And yeah it would probably boost the caps market/player vendors as people would travel from vendor to vendor trying to get more scrip for that day or the next.
---
Uh.... I'm pretty sure they changed that a long time ago. It now works exactly as what you want.
---
Challenging lol
---
Hey don’t kink shame
---
Yup, I have gone through this also. So now, I have no intention of ever moving my camp again.
---
I didn't even know this was an issue myself until I found out the hard way.
---
Thing is PvP as implimented on release was basically player Raiders vs PvE crowd.  If it released with NW or some other balancedd mode we would be having a different conversation.  In pretty much every fallout, including 76, raiders are strait Evil in game and story.  Very few people want that game play and almost none of those are healthy to the general player community.  Not saying PvP couldn't have worked well on release, just that it was obviously beyond devs.
---
While I can't speak for general audience, my crowd has wanted a coop fallout since FO:NV.  It's a big reason the few I know that still play forked out the cash for fo1st.  It's pretty safe to say the changes to allow MP to work got the game throughly slammed by community.  Despite game in general being more stable and polished then last few releases.  I would be curious if the social craze these days would have impacted FO3 / FONV as bad.  The purists on fallout sub considered FO4 poo at best with the shift from dialog to action.  The changes have always been decisive, it's just easier to see now.
---
PvE/PvP balance I've never seen done in a level based game.  Only ones that made it work had to do dedicated assets for each mode.  Devs don't have the manpower to even stomp bugs, betting that's why they did NW that way.
---
Right, I would never one-shot a legendary in Uranium Fever or anything... I'm all about the .38 chambered combat rifle and the "come here" emote in that case.
---
On the spongier guys, I felt like maybe I was saving people time and ammo but it ended up feeling hollow.
---
I would argue a decent chunk of god tier loot is duped. I personally hope one day Bethesda deletes all duped items. An easy fix imo is just raise the weapon level cap to like 80-100 and actually lock down duping. 
---
The problem with duping imo is Bethesda let it go unchecked for so long that those items are now just part of the economy. Especially after the create leggies hack
---
Perhaps you're not bugged? I've read where some people don't encounter this while others can't buy for weeks. I know my group hit the bug and we switched to the posted strategy. Works like a charm for us.
---
I recently swapped my perk cards to craft some ammo, forgot to switch it back, and accidentally healed my carnivore mutation. I was pissed, and server jumping looking for one, after 2 hours i found one, selling them for whooping 2000 caps! I only had 1k on me, and even if i did have it, i wouldnt pay such a stupid amount. 
---
Anyway after another hour i found a reasonable vendor, selling all for 460 caps, but he didnt have the carnivore. I wrote to him in desperation if he wouldnt craft and sell me one, and he did the same thing you encountered, just dropped it for me. I even wrote back to him if hes sure, as i dont mind paying for my mistakes, but he just did heart emoji, and fast traveled somewhere. I really appreciate the community in this game, there are some dumbasses, true, but overall its been great here.
---
I play female characters usually, switching between my treasure hunter outfit(which makes me feel like Laura Croft) and the civil war dress which I think looks rather cute. Though considering I’m a melee build and run around with a wardrum I think it makes it seem pretty funny.
---
The raider filter mask from this set is really nice.
---
That’s such an exhausted excuse at this point. Yeah, I get it some people RP as legit raiders but that doesn’t mean you can just force your RP style on someone over and over and over just being annoying it’s not even pvp or being a raider that’s literally just being an asshole toxic gamer. PVP is not PVP without consent. You can’t change my mind. Without consent you’re just an asshole.
---
The biggest issue surrounding PvP is that there's a directly opposite paradigm between PvE and PvP Players. PvE players don't want PvP at all and PvP players want to kill PvE players. Some PvP players may be ok with fighting other PvP players, but in reality, deep down, they just want to ambush and kill PvE players. Some don't want to fight people equal to them, they want to gank and fuck over normal people. Both of these things can't exist for both PvE and PvP players to be happy. The Survival Server was close, in that there was an incentive for PvE players to jump in for some time, so PvP players could get their rocks off that way, but I don't think there was enough incentive, so participation was low.
---
Two possible solutions come to my mind.
---
1. Add Survival back and ramp up the risk/rewards. Double or Triple rewards from events and dailies, increase Vendor and Legendary Scrapping limit. Add some kind of reward for surviving a PvP encounter. PvE players have to take the risk themselves to get the better rewards.
---
2. When joining the normal server, add a choice of whether you want to be a Hunter(PvP Player) or a Scavenger(PvE). Hunters are branded and appear as red marks on the compass(not on the map unless made Wanted) and their names are red. They can be freely killed even when the PvE player is set to peaceful(or add an option for peaceful only against other scavengers). Add some kind of new currency (let's say Ears or Fingers a la Fallout 3) to the game that you can only earn through PvP, but make losing at PvP trivial. Like you go down, but then automatically get back up after 10 seconds and can't be targeted for PvP for another 30 minutes(this would not apply to Hunters) and you don't lose caps or junk or aid items, just the Ears or Fingers you have. Then add a reward vendor that deals in ears and fingers(Raider Camp makes sense). Perhaps you can trade in sets of ears and fingers for aid caches, cap caches, scrip caches, gold bullion caches, etc. that way it's more universally useful.
---
Those are the two best ideas that come to my mind for keeping the game balanced between the two ideologies of PvE vs PvP.
---
I agree expand other modes like nuclear winter, but depending on the player you don't actively progress your character in NW besides a hint of xp and caps which are easy to max out.
---
I think there should be rewards, but nothing like a legendary, being back survival and add junk/already available plans/scrip awards to either challenges or kills (this would bring problems about friends farming tho so there would need to be a work around such)
---
do you just have a total lifetime amount of names or how does it work?
---
To me Fallout 76 is one of those games that has so many missed opportunities. Let players create quests for others, give us a base wars mode, actual events players work towards and depending on the outcome the world changes, a multi-world exchange, cross-play, etc.
---
Hey u/Enpsyched the water wheel will be fixed in Patch 20. I'm checking on the status of the nuka lamp and projection lights now as well.
---
Once I'm at cap limit if the item isn't a legendary, contains junk pieces I need, gunpowder or ammo, I'll leave it. No point in burdening myself over extra crap. I agree on a weekly limit rather than a daily limit to help those who may get to play once a week or so; it just needs to be something appropriate and not drastically high nor low, but then agreeing on that limit may be the problem. I feel it should just be all 7 days of what we currently have for the time being, even if it is not a flat 10k or w/e.
---
Don't forget to get their LAST osmosis kit back, only to find out they have dozens of them but it's the principle!
---
Also, keep in mind Ward has said he's a former Raider, so I mean he kinda knows how the Wastes work when you need to get something you want.
---
We're looking into the missing collision on the walls, this may be related to you not being able to place items on the walls as well. I'll let you know when I get an update on this issue!
---
Not true for me. I bought from him last Saturday night which was the 13th. I wasn't able to get on over the weekend. So I tried last night and can't buy. Hell can't even enter dialogue. And no I wasn't in the Wayward in-between that. This is the second time this has happened to me.
---
The serum giving you mutation has two effects, one lasts about an hour, and suppresses negative effects of all mutations.
---
The mutation itself stays for good, until you cure it with radaway/decontamination arch. If you have more than one mutation, it removes one random per use.
---
Unless you equip luck perk card starched genes, which will prevent you from getting a new mutation, and will make it impossible to cure existing ones.
---
Legend has it that the greät Möth himself sometimes creeps next to you when you're sleeping in it
---
You should definitely play the other Fallout games. You can get really cool shit in those games without even the need for an atom shop. Quite a few things in the atom shop are actually just standard items in other games.
---
If they aren't wearing Power Armor or the CSS.
---
Wouldn't want it any other way
---
I'm trying something like this with my SS set and trying to get awesome 2nd and 3rd star rolls like ap refresh,  acrobats (jetpack), and weight reduction.
---
PvP in 76 is one of the most alienating experiences you can have in games.
---
You start with the base combat experience, basically, what it's like in nuclear winter. It's adequate. Definitely not good and honestly worse than any shooting or combat game I can remember playing in the past 2 generations. Every single muddy brown mil-shooter I've played had tighter, better combat BUT....... technically it works.
---
Then you stack on: an aim-assist
---
Invisibility
---
Unbalanced legendary weapons and armor
---
Mutations
---
Perks
---
An incomprehensibly powerful consumable buff system
---
An ancient game engine
---
Server lag (I've been killed by someone I'd already killed, who'd been dead for about 10 seconds and hadn't respawned yet)
---
And the cherry on top, instead of addressing any of the imbalances, they just slap a damage cap on that tanks all but a few builds. 
---
What you get is a miserable experience that will never appeal to more than a small fraction of the player base. I used to joke that Fallout 76 was the only combat game I've ever played in which the snipers are the ones who can't shoot LOL but since single shot VATs is tanked due to the damage cap, now it's a combat game dominated by bizarre trolls who shoot the ground with weapons they don't have to aim, and can't be damaged because they chug a bunch of soda pop. That's so unbelievably stupid it's weird just typing it out.
---
Definitely!!
---
Permanent...

I’ve had a goal since beta to get a full collection of every weapon of a certain prefix in the game. Finally reached my goal and started to rename 1-99 and got the notification that I’d reached the limit . Just want to number my weapons for management and fear of loosing one . Not mad just don’t understand this particular limit seems unwarranted but maybe there’s specific reason they have but I don’t think it’s necessary.
---
Yeah I’ll try that but I am wondering currently if I should make a heavy metal set and a vanguard marine  and what the second effect should be aka sentinel, cav, etc
---
I'm 150+ now and still vividly remember people being like this to me when I was low level. One of the biggest reasons I go around trying to help other low levels now and do so with a pay it forward policy. Still do get griefed on occasion, but not near as often as I used to.
---
Agree completely. If anyone here plays ESO then you know bethesda is completely capable of balancing pvp and pve and it boggles my mind that they can’t just apply the same system in fallout. To duel someone in ESO BOTH players have to consent to dueling via an interacting wheel that pops not by hurting the other player and see if they hurt you back patiently waiting so you can get the jump on them. It even gives you like a 5 second countdown to begin the fight. Why the fuck can’t they do that in fallout?!
---
so wen I have mutations radaway removes that right? so how do I remove radiation if get to high?
---
I’ll admit that I’m as casual as possible, but imo Bethesda isn’t really helping make PvP enticing. The combat in fo76 is not great to begin with. Several weapons are broken (both too weak and too strong), making a perfect build can be a grind (especially if you picked some bad perks while leveling), finding the perfect legendaries is a grind, and generally there is not a great variety of ways to play to keep things interesting.
---
Yea I think the sleeping bag respawn thing from Rust would be good. If you manage to set up some kind of base you can store loot there but anything on you is up for grabs when you die. Would be good to have factions like you said too, just so you know you'll have some allies in the world. Maybe force an even split between factions when you spawn in so one doesn't have an advantage
---
Yeah that's undisputable
---
Leather with sentinel is always highly coveted by the pvp crowd.
---
I never imagined a day when we would have to ask consent to kill another player in a game.
---
True
---
I wish my magic heavies had that kind of power but nope.
---
That’s the good thing about building in this game, you get better camps placed faster because of the experience building the last camp. You learn more and more with every build. Don’t dread moving camps, see it as a chance to improve and you won’t mind it as much
---
There would probably be farmers, maybe even bots,  sitting on every workshop.
---
I am so sad now.  I cant believe Bethesda wants me to actual be fair with enemies...  I'm gonna die a lot more now....
---
I had someone in FO1st gear start shooting at me while I was at the legendary exchange machine at the Sutton station. Hadn't even been there for long. Being a fellow 1ster, I kind of wanted to sarcastically message them about how they should go hop on their private server if they want immediate access to everything, everywhere, all the time.
---
I considered that, but I think it'd need a respawn timer so that a base is actually raidable after its population is killed. The more beds, the longer the respawn time. I'm not familiar with how Rust's system works as I only played maybe three hours of it.
---
They can be rather good against people who run bloodied builds
---
I'm having bobbleheads vanish from my inventory.
---
I'm taking items out of specific vending machines and the machine stays at 30/30.
---
Few other inventory bugs.  It's a complete mess.  I'm amazed I have anything left when I log in.
---
Because you do in literally every other mmorpg lmfao people like you just need to stick to cod and halo
---
The legacy explosive ones are OP, but hard to get
---
See I never really experienced this when I started because at the beginning everyone was pretty low level apart from those who experienced the beta.
---
I help people because I know how it feels to have practically nothing when starting out for the first time and how much of a slog it is to acquire a decent weapon. I make it easy for them but not too easy as to not spoil the experience
---
Well, I’m with you fellers.
---
Yeah, I've picked up two lifetimes worth of plans. lol
---
I got straight up hunted elsewhere in the map by the person who killed me at my workshop. I didn't seek revenge or anything. How'd this happen? A glitch? Or some hack on their end?
---
i rebuilt my camp 3 times yesterday night couse it was clipping on an "existing item", but was on a flat plane with nothing there, one thing that I saw on some 1 year old post is if you are having this save the diagram with out the door/door frame, I need yet to try this.
---
You are correct, that did not sound right.
---
A B2525 pipe rifle downs the SBQ solo :-)
---
You know how long it took me to farm that spit and toilet paper?
---
I think it's just a set hard cap on how many named items you have at once
---
I don't play games solely for pvp and dislike CoD, I don't even disagree with the post OP made, I just never knew people took gaming this seriously.
---
“pvp in workshops is heavily biased towards attackers”
---
This is so true. In a FPS where 1-shots are the norm, it doesn’t matter how fast the defender can react. They’re gonna die.
---
Also, it’s kind of backwards. The winner is gonna he the guy who doesn’t need the resources. The rich get richer. That is, if they even really want the workshop. More than likely they just want caps from killing noobs.
---
Yeah i really dont think it is either.
---
Build your camp, blueprint everything except the foundations. Start new camp, build exact same foundations, and then drop blueprint which will now snap to the same configuration of foundations.
---
I came across a group of settlers being attacked by a group of raiders, i was friends with both, and watched the attack go one. There was one raider left, i shot him once, and got settler rep. There should definitely be an event version out there
---
im still waiting for the day that bethesda will add stuff to the hairstyles and tattoos.
---
i want like KS Hairdos styles and raider-like haircuts instead of pre-war nanny cuts. also full body tattoos instead of just a heart on your face or some lame stuff like that
---
I like your idea but I have a simpler one. A long time ago I played this game where PvP was highly regulated but everyone stilled played on the same server. This was done by joining a PK (Player Killer) society. The change was permanent. Once you join there is no turning back. It presented a big decision too. Once you joined you're given a Crest as an item and forever marked for PK. You could hunt or be hunted by other PKs at will. Something similar could be done here.
---
I've never nuked it, but the time's i've seen it nuked, it's great for high level mobs. Plenty of mats available for making flux.
---
I don't know.  I can't EVER remember workshops being super farmed, even when the rewards were much higher during beta/launch.
---
I only saw pvp/competition at the ammo factory.   Everything else was basically ignored.  Maybe the power plants when  they were making fusion cores at a higher rate. 
---
I see occasional grabs now that I suspect are just dailies getting done.  Hardly ever come across a developed workshop.
---
Very rarely see anybody trying to grab a workshop that has been claimed by somebody else.  Happened maybe a half dozen times since launch and I tend to grab them for fast travel points if I am putting time into the game that day.  Probably been killed over a workshop....3 times maybe?
---
Yup, will happen with quick travel too.  I've quick traveled to an objective way outside the nuke only to have it stick me inside the nuke zone.
---
Make sure you put your platform in your post so people know if they can help you or not!
---
Same here. I noticed something called an "Observant Radstag" and blew it away. The CAMP owner came out &amp; looked confused someone would be so thoughtful. I gave 'em a thumbs up &amp; hoofed it to Whitesprings.
---
This is something I thought they fixed. If you hit players during an event, they don’t take damage but as soon as the event ENDS, if you’re still going crazy trying to kill stuff, you’ll damage other players. Then they can kill you. Maybe I’m wrong but I feel like that’s how it has been for awhile.
---
What if they did charge fire instead. Ie gauss weapons?
---
Fallout was always a single player game. The PvP has been rammed into an engine that has really only been used for single player and into a game balanced around single player.
---
It's fine if people minmax builds using rare legendaries in a single player game, but it means PvP is nearly impossible.
---
Sry IM ON XBOX
---
I think that's how it works, you get a certain amount of respawns at your bag but then either a big timer or you have to spawn at the beach with nothing so you'd be pretty useless trying to attack again. I think they'd need to make recourses for building harder to get for bases to be a reward / challenge. Maybe just increase the materials a lot n force you to build from wood then upgrade to stone or metal. It could definitely work tho. =)
---
^ this right here. 
---
I played survival to up the challenge level but my experience was the there was no balance. Every player was either well below my level or so far above that there was no “fight”, just one shot encounters.
---
You need that starched genes perk to keep mutations when using radaway. 
---
Thats what i did even before i started looking for mutations. You only need 2 lvls to invest, and is really handy, i have like 7 mutations, and they make a world of a difference. 
---
Get that perk card, buy serums, and while youre at it, you also need to get another luck perk class freak, if you intend to have more mutations, as it suppresses negative effects of mutations.
---
At least a lawn mower or a vespa
---
i get what youre saying, basically like legendary overwatch skins, that make them look identical instead of just a re-color
---
battle royal games have shit tons of vehicles and shit loads of players. I mean i know fallout is a little more extensive but i feel like it could probably be pulled off. it’s just a bad idea, the grounds too fucked up. I get stuck walking on weird rocks.
---
make them separate games...
---
(looks online for a second)
---
there's lots of pvp games, go play them instead.
---
The other day myself and about 6 level 100+ dudes had an epic SBQ fight but she wouldn't land.  We got her health down to about 15pct before time expired.  Where were you? Lol
---
I lost the same one last week
---
That's me. I've put a few hundred hours in and really love the games potential. I got bored a few weeks before Wastelanders and figured I'd come back for that. Then I heard about the inventory and vendor problems and decided to give it awhile longer. I can't find the motivation knowing the same grind and bugs I'd be going back to. I stay subbed here in hopes of some magical update that has people posting about how great the game has become. I hope that happens.
---
Hi, that was me. Can I have my laser rifle back pretty please? LOL
---
My psn is bleachbrunette
---
You can buy wood for your camp there
---
Apparently if you teleport from your Map to a wayshrine it costs gold, if you go to a wayshrine and use it, you can travel to a different wayshrine for free.
---
Honestly not sure why they thought people wanted pvp in a fallout game to begin with. People were already lukewarm at best about it being an online non-single player fallout game. I'm all for splitting the servers but I feel like eventually they would just kill the pvp servers due to lack of playerbase. This just isn't the game type/series for it.
---
I've had the message pop saying my gear prevented me from contracting disease. My first thought is had you used a radaway recently? Shouldn't matter in gear that says "prevents waterborne disease"... But maybe disease resistance from water is like %100 with gear and other factors brought it down to possible. I don't think it should be like that, but just a thought
---
76 upvotes. Heh.
---
I just need the heal one, but thanks for the explanation mate gonna start working on that, thank you :D
---
Maybe they could add a single display case
---
I will always and forever put down any Blood Eagles I find like the sick dogs they are. Wasteland justice must be served. I’m relieved when Ward sends me up against those posers.
---
But really, nice job. A solid take on the faction disparities. I kind of like that surface appearances are deceiving, and it’s a little morally grey on both sides.made the Wastelanders quest very fun for me.
---
One note on the raider runaway quest, you can also use a Strength speech check to persuade him to come back to Crater. You get a bit more Raider rep bringing a peaceful resolution, and Rocksy is totally cool giving a second chance. Maybe even happier that way, but I may be reading more into it than is really there.
---
What’s your psn? I’ll stop by.
---
You need to scrap the belmets to learn to craft them.
---
This goes for Combat and Metal helmets.
---
How the fuck is killing 3 or 4 ghouls that are next to a candy bucket even remotely challenging?
---
It reduces the weight of fusion cores.  Not necessary at all, but handy if they start to stack up.
---
Yes and a full unyielding int set
---
Nah had a random player that joined my team a few days ago that had this exact thing happen. They also killed my friend I had joined because same team.
---
I didn't play during the beta but did start playing the day it was released. It wasn't too terribly bad at the start, but mostly because nearly everyone else was the same level as me so the fights were more fair. I noticed the biggest uptick in griefing when they got rid of the survival servers.
---
When Wastelanders dropped, I made a secondary character so that I can main with the Settlers and still experience the Raider Vault quest line. Gave me a pretty good reminder of how much of a pain it can be just starting out. Like you, I make it easy for the new players but not too easy. I spent a lot of Fasnacht running around dropping ammo and stims for people, thanks to vendors being down. Once people started nuking Helvetia, I started offering hazmat suits to the low levels as well since I have the crafting plans for it.
---
Like I said, free karma
---
Search the sub for Plan and Mod Database for locations, costs, and drop chances.
---
My new place is a definite improvement over my last one. I figured out how to add a second floor and since my last build, I found an bunch more wall mounted plans to put up on the walls and such. After it was done I was happier with it but it was still frustrating because I ended up using all of the screws I had in inventory which by themselves are a bitch to find. 
---
I ended up having to spend almost a thousand caps to restock because I’m trying to do that excavator power armor quest so I won’t be so naked going into blast zones to take down the SBQ. I’ve done it, but going against that thing with only a hazmat suit and no armor makes it so much harder than it has to be. I’ve gone through to level up to the mid 70’s having never used power armor at all.
---
Yes?
---
Yep, same here. And once i bought and learned them all for serum crafting purposes, I’ve went back and bought them again so I can potentially sell them for a loss in my vending machines.  I’m working on purchasing my fourth set of them now since I don’t have anything else better to spend caps on.
---
I happier with my camp now so I’ll never move again either
---
as a pve flithy casual, id be more inclined to pvp if they removed legendary magic/mutations, etc.
---
Oh my the Bloodied FFR GG is sneaky good in PvP especially against bloodied builds.
---
That’s fine, same here. But do you live under a rock? People take gaming very seriously hence why there is a debate on this in the first place like every other day. Every single other mmorpg has a system where both people have to agree to pvp or duel. No loopholes or anything. Just a basic mutual agreement. There are games without pvp consent like dayz and Ark but those aren’t rpgs they’re more pure survival and crafting where there’s no build bias and everyone has the same advantages regardless of how they play. Fallout 76 is not like that therefore it needs consensual pvp to be balanced.
---
I got a lot of plans doing the dailies for Wren at the Crater.  But by the time I got to that it was pretty end game for me.
---
And such a conspicuous number, if I may add.
---
i feel the same way. the game as a whole, engine. how its played, balancing, all of that has basis in fo4, a dedicated solo game. i feel thats the root of all causes, the foundation of the game is just not built for multiplayer play. but to then bring in an enmeshed pvp? thats crazy. to the minimum, let it be where whatever you *unlock* in pve mode, you can use in a dedicated pvp mode. if youre a dedicated pve player, the frustration of trying to parlay that same build in a pvp mode is going to cause players to hesitate on that mode. and pve aint perfect, it mostly just amounts to more firepower, theres no actual team mechanic or change in gameplay, especially end game. a team cant even all finish a mission together, you gotta swap around who is team captain.
---
YOU'RE pretty sad actually. So Na Na Na na na na.
---
Well yes but actually no. I always take all three power plants and Summerfields for the Saddle Up Salisbury Steak. Graded A+.
---
I can, but I won’t be on for a few hours.
---
OH I DIDNT EVEN REALIZE
---
Sick. Just found a BFFR15 gamma gun
---
I was just making you aware of this since you posted on a post of mine noting you needed this challenge completed.
---
Yeh BR games are like a third of the size though. They run on small, relatively basic servers with hardly any real-world items that can spawn or move, and no NPC’s needing power to navigate walking etc. This is complete off the top of my head, but I bet an early game of BR on Fortnite used less CPU power than loading the whole of Whitesprings externally . There’s so much information to load and render, and all the individual drop items in the building all take up space. 
---
On New Vegas, even the internal hideout at the top of the Lucky 38 was so laggy after I created an actual decorated space. That’s what takes up time, because all of those individual items need to be able to be moved in an explosion at any given point, so they’re all independent resources taking power.
---
Don't forget the Welsh flag - Apple took ages to create the  emoji but when they did they put a lot of thought into the Dragon apparently.
---
Yeah, that is true.  If you use trading, it’s really impossible to say where any of that gear comes from.
---
I’d be all for a level cap increase and bound gear to combat duping.  I don’t know what it would do to the economy, but it would at least put power creep behind an effort barrier.
---
I thought this was your post so I didn’t read the OP at first... once I figured it out I edited my post. Lol, thanks a lot, super cool to tag me!!
---
Yup I remember back when I played archage during the beta. Despite being "open world pvp" players didn't really kill each other except in 2 specific areas and they were generally guild vs guild fights were the leaders got together and decided on a time and place for it. Running around ganking people in games is generally a dick move and this game is no exception. PVP in 76 has turned out to be exactly what people were worried about during the reveal.
---
So too dumb to learn after he first time? It’s on you to change your settings not Todd
---
My level 43 is constantly having to fight off level 200, 600, 1200 assholes. I end up bringing my 176 in because that has Quantums, BE laser, QLD Tesla and drugs.
---
This is all great. Upvoted. Im a HUGE pvp fan. In fact, most games i play i play to pvp. This games pvp however is so damn broken itd take quite a bit to fix. Lets say we get pvp servers, im down. Lets say we also fix all the exploits, hell yea! But are we also getting rid of all the chad legendaries too? Pvp on the pvp server free of healing exploits would still be infested with chad legendaries and then it would just devolve into the same thing it currently is, just trading one shot cuckage all day, that shits lame dude. There has to be some sort of balance with the weapons themselves, but even if that were to happen the exploiters will no doubt figure out a way to fuck it up anyway. I really wish there was a way to make the pvp un this game GOOD and FAIR and BALANCED but i just dont see that happening honestly. I pvp on other games and jump on 76 to chill and GGGRRRRIINNNNDDD.
---
Helmet in the back workstation room at Slocum joes.  I assume it’s a permanent spawn as I’ve been there loads and the helmet is always there. Dunno about plans.
---
No your right. Op is bad and shoots people after the event and qq’s about forgetting to turn on passive.
---
If on xbox I'd def buy it.lmk have a 2star j10damage hm that rocks
---
Holy punctuation, Batman!
---
I think fair is something determined by both parties. You may not think it’s fair but they do 🤷🏼
---
On his hip
---
This is why nobody does Hunter/Hunted anymore.
---
I don’t leave gifts because I want them to end up in someone’s hands rather than dying with the server, but I’ll happily overencumber people I see with diluted chems.
---
They won't anyway. Pve players are here to play a fallout game not pvp. Look at the roadmap and the wastelanders update. Beth figured out people want fallout in their fallout games and that most of us are here for story etc. I'm all for splitting the pvp onto their own server but I also won't be shocked if they do that and eventually kill the servers due to "lack of players" .
---
it is challenging, but i enjoy the chaos, its one of few consistent places to just fight a bunch of high lvl ghouls (super handy for double xp weekends). i purposely built a big guns build specifically for that place, which of course is also awesome during radiation rumble (my fav event, even though i get rocked most the time, i can never get through the deathclaw horde before they kill the workers)
---
When I was a low level player I admit I would take the scrap from collectrons I feel bad now that I’m a higher level(70) and realize that I really didn’t need any of it. So, now I try and give back as much as possible especially to low level players but, I also like to put of deals and sales in my vendor just to make people happy. It’s way more satisfying because I know I love/d it when I was gifted or found an awesome deal.
---
Just don’t use it then?
---
Your original post was a two parter. You stating that the BoS has no knowledge of the enclave and the other part being that they don’t have a grudge against them.
---
I said it’s not necessarily true, for the sake of the argument that the two factions could possibly become hostile this early on, that the BoS don’t have a grudge against them. 
---
I thought that was clear from my response but maybe you didn’t understand it.
---
I didn’t take issue with anything lol
---
I’m just trying to explain to you that your claim may not be as concrete as you think it is
---
Even without the radiation damage (stealth suit, power armor etc) the physical/electric damage is legit.
---
No problem.
---
I’d recommend a full unyielding suit.  To me, the chameleon piece is irritating and the uny stat boosts are more valuable.  It’s up to you.  30+ ag will make you very, very sneaky.
---
Thanks captain obvious!
---
Were you wearing just the helmet or the full suit because the suit does the same thing. Going to upload a small video with just the helmets.
---
Agreed OP.  I do think a good item trading screen/feature would help this. I know there’s a lot of folks sitting on good gear that doesn’t match their build worth more than caps but they’re afraid of getting scammed and not comfortable messing with the whole courier thing. A multi-item trade feature might open the market supply/demand and normalize some of what you’re seeing.
---
yes!  give me more battlefield and less skyrim for pvp!
---
agreed, if only there was a viable way to directly search markets and trade in a way that uses a viable currency that wasn't just a giant annoyance and liability
---
I went back to my x01 cos of it
---
Value in this game is pretty subjective.   Someone may only want one type of item because that is what they are looking for to fit their build.
---
Also, if you're trying to trade a few not as good items for one really good item you're going to have a  bad time.   Lots are much more difficult to trade with as it usually just creates more work and storage issues for the other person.  Not sure if that's what you're talking about but I see this as a common issue over there.
---
All they gotta do is revamp the hunted hunter radio to fully open yourself to pvp in the world and make it so u only see others on the same radio in pvp. Also add a damage reflected back for those not on pvp to stop people from griefing non pvp players (maybe only pacifist mode). You dont need a seperate server at all. Just fine tuning here and there.
---
GTA V would like a word with you.
---
I totally agree and it would just be nice if I was selling an item and it was worth 30000 caps and you are selling an item worth 30,000 caps that we could just do a trade that's just seems logical I'm not going to trade a Chevette for a Ferrari in real life I'm not going to do it on a game
---
It is mainly The scorch for me as well. But I've had ghouls do it, too.
---
The elite just trade amongst the elite while I sit here with a few measly caps... 
---
It's pretty true to life tbh
---
If you mean the recall keycard thing, you need to buy it, the quest gives you your first one for free.
---
What prime fissure site glowing in the circle?
---
I had the sentry bot become an unstoppable death machine. Couldn't be killed, could shoot through walls, could follow me all the way back to the start of the mission. It was like a terminator.
---
As a big time user of the trade sub the value is determined by both party's. An item is worth what ever the owner of it places in it.
---
And yes after 1.5 years of the game being out a lot of people have their best gear. And are only trading in A-S tier items. At that point it gets very difficult to work something out, especially since people tend to want to trade up.
---
The best thing you can do is start small and work your way up. Keep an eye out for good deals and be ready to swoop. It's hard but it is what it is.
---
Unfortunately with nothing really new added to the game (weapons/armor) that is trade-able most people only want the meta stuff or the really rare cosmetic stuff.
---
You cant be surprised when someone wont trade you a bloody fixer rifle for an exterminators handy buzz blade.  Just how it works bud.
---
If the devs did a balance patch to make things more viable the trading market would be a lot more fun.  But right now Junkies and Bloodied stuff is what people want.
---
You gotta ask yourself, would you trade a god roll item for 3 lesser tier items?  I know I wouldn't and I don't blame people for holding out.
---
You bring the women, and I’ll bring the gin.
---
that was one of my favs
---
Totally agree...its a tough one.  Even with fed76.info its great but not always perfect or taking into account demand.
---
Full suit. I think someone posted that you have to have the full suit for it to block water disease. But the Marine helmet blocks water disease with just the helmet?! I gotta get one lol
---
yes. please and thank you. 
---
stop putting rewards *only* in PvP mode that we mostly use in PvE game play. allow those rewards to be attained in all modes and used in all modes. it's ok to want to PvP and it's ok to want to only PvE. and I agree - it should be separate servers entirely.
---
I hear ya... It seems like most people put a ton of stuff up for trade, but only want 1 or 2 -very- specific items. The likely-hood of someone having one of those 1 or 2 exact items, seeing the post, and actually wanting what they're offering is extremely low. Sadly this is the way it is as Caps are so over-duped they have no value anymore, and because of this, getting an accurate value on anything is near-impossible.
---
I heard the thing about only going there on the correct day before so I'm careful about it now. It wasn't a problem that one time but I'm not going to push my luck with it just in case.
---
The main difference is that both factions have dubious traits, but Crater is the only one who is honest about them, ironically.  Foundation always treats you (and, for that matter, anyone outside their flock) with sneering condescension, believing you aren't good enough for them.  Paige is dripping with it.
---
But Ward is another beast entirely.  As you point out, Ward settles for nothing less than murder, and if you refuse, he'll badmouth you and lower your reputation, which is something neither Wren nor Rocksy does.  Moreover, most of these tools are being "stolen" through Ward's own incompetence.  He seemingly loans them out to everyone.  For that matter, no matter how many times you double-cross him, he'll still enlist your help to recover the tools.  And when they aren't being stolen, he's lying about it.  He lies about the osmosis kits (which the thieves claim they need to purify water).  He lies about the bonesaw (they've never needed one).  And how convenient it is that Rocco was "exiled" from Foundation by Ward after he "found out" about the deal with Lev to sabotage the Raider Vault plan, right?
---
Totally man my exact point but better. Lol
---
absolutely!
---
I did a queen of the hunt and was expecting the usual wendigo as I approached the last target. Really made me jump when a mothman whooshed up right behind me.
---
You should be ashamed of yourself...
---
Dude yyeesssss. Get rid of the fuggin chad legendaries thats what ive been saying! No legendaries at all (theyd have to scale back some of the enemy hp pools a tad tho i think). Make it a bare bones server. Noone is ever visible on the map. Youd still lose your junk but make it so theres some more incentive for taking out players or something, tokens? Tags? And trade thise in for loot/swag? The only thing that would suck would be the exploiters who will no doubt find a way to fuck it up.
---
Personally, I think putting the PvP players on their own servers is a mistake. It basically guarantees that PvP in the game will fail because there are simply not enough PvP players to sustain a separate game mode and it will always get the short end of the development stick over the more popular PvE mode. This is ultimately why survival mode didn't last. Yes, Bethesda butchered the mode, but many of the players that used it were, like you said, only there for the rewards.
---
In my opinion, there are three things they can do to improve PvP in the game.
---
1. Add more modes to Nuclear Winter. Battle Royale is great and all, but there should be shorter smaller modes as well. Stuff like Capture the Flag, Wave defense or Team Deathmatch, etc. They can look at any number of games for examples of how to do this.  Nuclear Winter is anemic right now. It doesn't have enough content to keep players engaged with just two maps that are way too big to effectively encourage PvP. They also need to adjust the rewards so that kills get more XP than just hiding. Also, the rewards should be like the gillie suit and be geared more towards giving an advantage in Nuclear Winter, not fun camp items that people want in Adventure mode. Maybe some type of legendary Nuclear Winter perks for example. As for the bush wookies, just make a Watoga downtown map where there are no bushes and watch them all die.
---
2. Fix the exploits that allow players to force other players who don't want to into PvP. I'm talking about Nuke Mines, Explosive Bait, etc and tricking people onto PvP teams. If people don't want PvP then don't force them into it. Pacifist mode should mean no other player can hurt them or their camp in regular gameplay in any way. But it should also mean that they can't take part in PvP events or content. If someone in pacifist mode wants to take a workshop, have it give them a dialog box that says "If you take this workshop it will turn off pacifist mode while you are in the workshop area. Do you want to do this?" Then make a way to trigger friendly PvP that doesn't include shooting random players until you find someone who wants to do PvP. Maybe a different icon on the map for people who aren't in pacifist mode.
---
3. Have certain events and spaces in the map that are PvP only that you can't do in pacifist mode. There should be more content like Monster Mash and Hunter/Hunted. But to do this right, they need to have an alert come up on the screen for any pacifist player warning them that they are entering a PvP zone and this will turn off pacifist mode while they are in the area or event. Make them a separate instanced load screen that forces people who want to enter to say, yes they are aware that other players can kill them. For example, turning the Watoga Civic center into a PvP arena with a weekly leaderboard and rewards that would help PvP players like special assassins weapons or something. Or  a separate free-for-all map of the Pitt where anything goes that is a super high level hostile area where players fight each other or really high level mobs. Even some of the cut PvP events like the reenactment one would be fun to add back in.
---
Agreed, do both story lines and the settlers actually seems like their the bigger A-holes. 
---
The raider quest line for the vault actually made me feel more empathy for their characters. Weasel was awesome! 
---
The settler quest line felt more like helping a bunch of elitist jerks get their stuff back.
---
no and i don't understand why people do that. at least, when they come in just to laugh or shit on people that still play, or blast their hot takes and edgy comments (not saying you do that, i wouldn't know). it's one thing if you are interested in what is happening with the game, or you may want to jump back in or whatever, but there are a ton of people that don't even play that show up just to shit on the game and players. it's fucking stupid and you're kind of just a shitty person if that is entertainment for you.
---
They should do something for the pvp players but to say "don't listen to the non pvp players" is basically you saying "ignore 98% of the playerbase". Bring survival mode back for the 2% that care and balance things differently for it without adding rewards to try to force people who don't want to play it to join.
---
Ohh perfect, thanks so much and psn is Braydn778 al be on tonight about 8pm(Uk time) if that’s any help?
---
Do you have a screenshot of the nuke zone?
---
I too miss Survival mode. It wasnt perfect (far from) but damn if it wasnt exciting when you were in the right frame of mind.
---
I use an Automatic 2 Shot GG and it's quite effective in PVP. Just VATS their torso and hold the trigger, and say goodbye.
---
Sounds good to me. I have no interest in PVP and I doubt I ever will. I play this as a Fallout game with "friends", not against them. I switched on pacifist mode pretty much as soon as I got out of the vault. 
---
I haven't had many issues with griefers but there has been a couple of occasions where a random group will appear at my camp and start trying to blow shit up. Pretty annoying, pretty pointless when it's obvious I'm not going to fight back. If that's your thing then a dedicated PVP space makes perfect sense.
---
In my case, it posted my father winter PA helmet instead of another item i had in my vendor... I took it off as soon as I noticed. People didn't believe me... Especially since it's non-tradeable...
---
There is already the confirmation from the AMA mentioning some interiors being used as phased interior camps. I half expect one of the vaults to be opened up for interior player camps.
---
But how does one STOP touching themselves, when they ARE themselves!?!!

No but my problem is when I put up an ad that I'm selling a JE very nice 50 cal and what I'm looking for. People reply and then offer you something comparable, then tell you what you have isnt good enough after they replied to you??
---
The gun or the effect? Probably a furious faster fire rate lmg if not using bloodied or junkies
---
Shouldn't need a full suit when the description says it for the separate helmet piece. Added the video.
---
You do much organizes pvp? I’m wanting to get into it but not really sure where to find people
---
Omg THIS
---
.50 Cal is the easiest ammo to get through crafting as the resource reqs aren't much and you get 100 rounds per craft. Using Ammosmith and Super Duper nets you 200+ per craft.
---
If your level 50 or above theres no reason to go for a 2 star you might get that speacal weapon you never want to let go of...do you want it to be a 2 star?
---
Gotta give it to ya, the late reply shows initiative.
---
It's like wanting a Ferrari but needing two Ferraris to trade for that Ferrari
---
Well 76 wasn’t a control vault though. Vault tech is kind of know for being a huge waste. Going out of their way to make life hard on vault dwellers is kind of their MO. I’m sure if new players wasn’t an issue they could have just collapsed the thing.
---
Both really. I haven’t a clue what to be looking out for. Got nothing else to do in the game so thinking of things to look out for to keep me occupied lol I will look out for the furious lmg, thanks
---
Did you have the bobbles on display before?
---
My mothers cooking would make the bitch roll over
---
It's possible. I hope there is, as currently it sticks out too much, so being able to blend it in better would be welcome.
---
It would be really nice to see people represent their nationality at their camps this way.
---
True, lets see what I get from now on. Thanks OP!
---
Thanks for this, I’ve wandered into this event a couple of times and have indeed been very confused...maybe folks should wander down there when the event isn’t going on and familiarize themselves with the space...it’s easy to get turned around
---
Or your lambo lol

Source post? Again just trying to verify before I spend my next 100 modules not getting what I want :)

I thought that was the whole crux of the bug to begin with...
---
i think the great majority of skins and costumes are really dope, actually.
---
my issue lies with valuation. how the fuck can 3 power armor skins cost as much as the game, brand new? i get you can earn atoms for free, but if you are selling them, you are giving them a dollar value. who in their right minds thought it was okay to sell power armor skins at $12+ a pop? it's ridiculous.
---
And it’s a shame I’m not a bloodied build as I’ve got a bloodied faster fire rate LMG haha
---
Haha
---
This may have already been stated but they *did* have the servers split and they stopped for whatever reason (assuming lack of interest but could be wrong)
---
The hoarding is real
---
Not really, I just keep my GG with me in case any PVP does come up. 
---
I'd suggest taking key Workshops like Ammo Factory or Fusion Core ones and seeing if anyone comes to try and take them from you. Aside from NW which doesn't let you use your actual character or gear, that might be your best bet.
---
Why not? It’s way cheaper and the 3rd minor effect isn’t worth the 50scrip, imho
---
You in the wrong place for downing West Virginia and it's people.
---
If frank is three stars, frank is gonna die.
---
Strictly PVP rewards are rewards I'll never bother trying to get because I don't care, I play fallout for the PVE as I have done for the past 20 years.
---
That being said, for those who do like the PVP, I agree with what you're saying, give them separate servers and let them murder each other. Win win for everyone involved
---
I saw a threat on here recently where people are nuking that place because it has tons the flowers. And you can get a lot of flux farming done there once it's nuked.
---
because it doesn't benefit you. if it benefitted the players, we would have gotten a hotfix week 1.
---
What is that outfit the dude with the mask wearing? Looks cool
---
I still have yet to find any tickets, from a *whole* lot of kills and looting. Any suggestions to find them easier?
---
I've never even seen this guy appear so it would be nice if he did for me.
---
I'm not a PvP person, but OP pretty much sums it all up (even with potential solutions). I'd be quite happy, along with most other PvE I'm sure, if the PvP had somewhere suitable to wreak havoc on each other.
---
I can see the whole '76 thing coming from players saying something like "I wouldn't mind co-op Fallout with my friends". But that was always going to be a PvE thing. I guess someone was keeping an eye on how much cash/popularity various other online BR/survival games were producing.
---
I think if they remove all buff effects it'd be hard to exploit stuff? On console anyway suppose you can always cheat on pc. Rust 76 here we come ha ha
---
As a small added tip, it is a very good idea to generally have local chat on for public events like this. Aside from some outliers, this is the most non-toxic community I've ever been apart of. I, along with a lot of others, are always happy to explain mechanics to anyone that asks in-game.
---
Yes, please! Forget skins for that one outfit and tent. Give me skins for the ugly eyesore of a scrapbox.
---
I didn’t buy Skyrim 3 times to get games made this shitty lmao
---
5mm ammo is THE ammo to craft instead of buy, like thats legitimately the most important ammo type to craft&gt;buy.... you can dump out ridiculous amounts of 5m ammo using super duper and the ammo crafting perk. mono rail elevator + bunker workout rooms + lucky hole = 20k 5m ammo... if youre paying for 5mm ammo then you have less brain cells than caps... do you really think its ok to spend 500 caps on one magazine?
---
I save them up and ‘test’ the server.  Again not sure if it matters but I ‘feel’ like I got my vanguards and my unyieldings in a batch.  I also have mules that scrip everything other than gold-crafted items that I can’t drop to mules.   And it allows me to have the space to hold LOTS of SS armor waiting to be scrip’d... it’s so disappointing
---
I believe it's called Engineers Uniform or something like that. Don't remember where i got from unfortunately
---
i feel like most of the playerbase wasnt here for the good ole days of pvp before broken legendaries were super common. they think pvp = somedudewithahackedweapon1shottinganelementaryschoolsworthofplayers
---
You get the backpack on hard mode
---
I just finished the Wastlanders questline weekend before last. I claimed my bullion that weekend. I had read about not interacting with him until it has reset, so that is what i did. bought first 300 on June 14th in the am, and went to buy my second set this past Sunday June 21st in the evening. I had no issues and was able to purchase both times.
---
just my anecdotal experience for anyone wondering
---
If it increases your chances of not getting total crap by reducing the scrip you pay to roll then, yes. But if you already have great weapons and want something just a little bit better, then no.
---
I have mules whose sole responsibility is carrying plans.
---
Agree... jiminy jilickers...
---
There is little they could do with the current mechanics. Outside of a workshop the responding player has more of the upper hand since they get to decide when the fight turns real. In a workshop the initiating player has the advantage because they can just hold V to activate PvP and you won't see it coming.  All of this overshadow the fact that pretty much anyone that is actually trying to PvP other people is going to be geared for it specifically. Trying to fight a guy with an auto 40mm GL that has explo, assassin is a nightmare. You get stagger locked just from the splash damage alone. You could try to use a stealthboy but you have that damn cursor over your head and they barely have to try to hit you once.
---
Something not working as intended/described in Fallout76?
---
Colour me surprised.
---
Bethesda’s game of risk, get to it before it explodes LOL
---
I take workshops off and on hoping for PvP and rarely get it. Occasionally I'll contest someone else's but it's rare to see anyone that wants to fight, even people running raider emblems. I generally only go after people lvl 200 or higher unless they seem like they are looking for PvP.
---
I think too many people look at level versus build. I've been smoked by a level 40 guy running a handmade that knew how to fight. Afterwards I gave him a thumbs up and told him good shooting. 
---
While I do enjoy Nuclear Winter it is a he'll of a lot different than normal PvP. Being forced into a tiny zone with random weapons is a different type of challenge than having a PvP build and using the weapons you like. 
---
Hunter/Hunted is also kind of a joke. Half the people that start it are usually lower level players that don't know what it is and the other half seem to be people that just want to hide instead of fighting.
---
I agree with everything except #1: I liked the ability to go back and forth. When combined with the other suggestions from OP, I think having that option is helpful for those of us who want to occasionally spice things up or play with friends (in either environment). I absolutely agree with #4 - that was a disaster.
---
I mean, there's skins for Tents, which are 1st exclusive, so yeah, they probably could do it.
---
Although, this is one of those things that makes me think they screwed themselves over, in a sense.
---
People love stash box skins, and some pay cash for atoms to get them.
---
But, the stash box is 1st exclusive, so they really can't charge atoms for skins, without giving a version to everyone, which they're unlikely to do.
---
That does make sense that since he is bigger it should heal you more. I wish that there would be some type of dialogue for when somebody sees you do it. I accidentally ate a dead settler in front of their friend when I hit the wrong button. It would have been funny to hear them call me disgusting or something. Instead they just stood by and watched.
---
People really expect you to turn on your mic and go like "up excuse me would you perhaps like to pvp as long as we have the exact same gear and its not competitive in any way." Its truly lame. It should be worrisome when a couple bad dudes roll up on you looking to fight
---
I believe it was Socrates who said 'I got you fam'
---
What's your GT?
---
Survival mode was only ever a stopgap. I doubt they ever really had any intention of keeping it around long term.
---
I had a female character so I thought precisely this, so I tried a voice changer. I thought it would be fun roleplaying as a female. Ended up making friends with a someone very nice and wanted to be honest with them, but I had been using the voice modulator every time we played together that I was scared to use my regular voice. I avoided using my mic at times that I didn’t feel like setting up the voice changer, which became a pain in the butt. I eventually came clean, and they were super cool about it. They didn’t really care, and they had already guessed correctly anyway. I am so much happier, now, being able to be transparent, which is the way I generally like to live my life. So, if I’ve learned anything, it’s to just be straight up and honest from the beginning, especially about something that may be harder to come clean about as time progresses. Also, it’s fun being a guy playing as a girl. I have a friend, who’s a girl, that plays as a guy. It’s not strange at all. And it’s fun! (: 
---
Good luck out there, 76.
---
That’s weird. One time, someone launched a nuke and I went to go check on the map and FSP wasn’t even in the nuke zone, there was a small gap between FSP and the nuke zone. I chuckled cause I thought he messed up but then to my surprise the nuke landed and started scorched earth still.
---
The hunter one and the crossbow one were the easiest for me personally. I just ran around near vault 76 with the crossbow and had naturally already done 50% of the hunter one. Mammalogy was super easy for me, just milk the brahim in flatwoods, you may have to server jump a little bit as there is a cooldown.
---
Just reinvest in bullets you can have unlimited caps if u do it like that...
---
I've got a sort of [modular camp](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14o212dNGKnhn-TpcFP9GOageXThzHtz9/view) that I can move around. Mostly all four foundation buildings, I put my fusion generator in a building with 2 vending machines. It's sort of the powerhouse, so I put it down and can wire the other buildings up to it when I sit them down. Everything's been going pretty good with moving it, but there's some kind of hitch with my workshop building every time when I move it. Conveniently, it's the one building that I was able to blueprint the entire structure. So, when I move and rebuild, if that building won't go down, I store the entire thing, and rebuild it from blueprint which works like a charm. I've been trying to figure out what I'm doing to that building when I'm decorating it, that is preventing me from just putting it back down as is in a new location.
---
LMG, 50cal, gauss minigun are the probably the best queen killers. For legendary perks that aren't bloodied or junkies, look for furious or to a lesser degree anti armor and faster fire rate. There are also some glitched weapons if you search YouTube, but these will likely be patched out. Also, make sure to stock up on food and chems cause you'll need the extra boost.
---
Ward being a lich that's not-secretly-at-all spreading death and dismay for his twisted amusement is probably the more interesting of a premise than the entire of Foundation itself.
---
Up and at them!
---
More like game of suicide
---
Sick idea!!
---
Is it made of cardboard boxes?
---
Agreed, YouTube is also a big part of that for me. I only got into the Dark Souls series because it has such top notch content on YouTube, and I ended up finishing the whole series because it’s awesome.
---
There’s a decent random spawn point at the Cranberry Glade, when you fast travel in walk ahead into the carpark and there should be a tameable creature there.. server hop if you want a different animal.
---
😎
---
I was gonna say blankets
---
Cheers, I’ve got furious handmade at the mo and like how that works.  Will try and get some more furious items if they the next best after bloodied and junkies. Also fast fire rate. Thanks again 👍
---
My pleasure. Good luck!
---
Sorry, your authority is not recognized in Fort Kickass...
---
Last week on 4 characters on Monday I bought gold. This week on Tuesday he wouldn't sell to 3 out of 4. 8 days without going to the Wayward and 75% failure rate. Piss poor percentage. Smiley is a terrible businessman.
---
That's crazy. Seems like there are still some bugs that are so rare it's hard to prove they happened or how.
---
I recently quit. The only reason I played was for PVP. Everyone is a cheater. That is why nobody wants to PVP. Whether they buy duped aid items, duped legacy weapons, or outright hack weapons and armor into existence, the majority of all PVPers are cheating.
---
The last two workshops I took had blatant cheaters. One of them was a level 40 using some hack that allowed him to shoot his grenade launcher and bow like a rapid fire machine gun even while dead. The final time I played the game, there were two dudes in power armor who took zero damage unless critical hit. This was most likely hacked sentinel/assassin power armor. I still managed to kill them twice a piece, but they eventually came back with beam splitter LMGs and orbital strike cannons.
---
I have accepted this will never be fixed. You need to cheat in some way in order to "compete" in PVP, and I won't be a part of that. Bethesda doesn't care. They don't want balanced gameplay. They want to appease the majority of their audience in some hope they buy their atomic shop crap.
---
Same reason a lot of other bugs haven't been fixed...
---
Tried to play it earlier during awol armaments. Didn’t hear that infamous noise after killing a 3* gutsy so needless to say I lost lmao
---
Glad you're enjoying it :) it really is a wonderful game
---
Personally I have no problem with the MTX considering all the DLC is 100% free and MTX are 100% optional
---
Did you read/listen to a single note/terminal/holo of past and present raider groups? Literally any single one is enough for me to shoot their kneecaps off on sight.
---
Can't believe you tried to moralize Blood Eagles, I feel more empathy towards robots I kill than them.
---
Yeah. Not sure if people would really know this or not as the majority are probably wearing the helmet and suit as a set and not one or the other. And since the suit protects as well, you dont know the helmet part doesnt work right with water diseases.
---
Yeah, I'm sort of in the middle of the two camps.
---
I'll take workshops for the plans, and do the retake events, and maybe the odd defense (as long as it's not Molerats).
---
If someone tries to contest it while I'm there, I'm up for a bit of PvP, since we're both expecting it (Hopefully, but if they're trying to take it from me, without expecting PvP, that's on them).
---
If I'm not there, they're welcome to it, as I'm likely already running round retaking/defending the rest.
---
I definitely agree that each "mode" has it's own flavour though. 
---
Random gear in NW, and a shrinking area.
---
Occasional ambushes at workshops in a confined, yet customizable area.
---
And while I haven't gotten to try H/H, I'd imagine it's basically the closest to "True" PvP: everybody's geared and prepared for it in advance, with the whole map to fight in, like a mini-survival mode.
---
Edit: forgot some words.
---
Search the sub.
---
You need an alt
---
A bffr lmg will shread the Queen. But really any gun will do just fine. The problem with an lmg is it eats expensive ammo. You can easily blow threw 1k rounds a Queen fight
---
PC, and IGN is Ephesos
---
I just hate pvp because it is fucked in terms of even being able to balance to begin with. A bloodied consecutive tesla rifle can delete me from existing even in my maxed power armor before I can react. Add on net code, lag,mutations, and chems and you get the most unbalancable pvp you could get due to sheer amount of factors.
---
In your defense, they didn’t always provide this. At launch you needed an actual gas mask (or the Veil of Secrets).
---
At some point post go-live they changed this, but I don’t remember the announcement.
---
Nice, but I’m on PC
---
Not an rpg. I’m talking about class building rpgs like ESO, Diablo, neverwinter, WoW etc. all have a consensual pvp otherwise it just wouldn’t be balanced. GtaV is like more along the lines of survival which I mentioned in another comment like DayZ and Ark. Non consent pvp can work in games like that because that’s the name of the game, survive and everyone has the same basic advantages so it works. If fallout 76 was called Fallout:survival then we’d probably be having a different convo right now. They tried to make fallout an mmorpg just a mirror image of ESO but in the fallout universe and it’s not even close. And I’m not talking about server size and map size, totally okay with 76’s small servers and smaller map. It’s all the other mechanics that would make 76 even more amazing that they failed to implement.
---
It’s trade only, and likely reserved for a heavy alt I’m leveling
---
I still need to decorate the inside of the shop, like I said it’s still a work in progress right now
---
Not an RPG, I’m laughing my fuckin ass off
---
That’s all the trolls use in combat an RPG 😂
---
Glad you're enjoying it! The world is by far my favorite they've done so far personally. If your on PC feel free to add me and I can hook you up with some gear/supplies! (same username in-game)
---
Simply put, this game tried PVP several times since launch. Every single time it failed. At the end of the day the devs are just not good at designing PVP content, and the majority of the playerbase doesn't want it. 
---
The solution: Stop trying to make PVP work. Yes, if they listened to reddit maybe they could fix it. But they won't because that's not how anything works. Professionals don't get paid to come to social media, take notes, and implement suggestions in place of their own ideas. They can take notes to bolster their own productions, but they can't and won't design something by drawing on a crowd.
---
So in the end further attempts at PVP are a waste of their time and resources until the base game is in much better shape. I'd say Bethesda could revisit PVP in a couple of years, when a lot of other more important things are fixed, and maybe after a round of new dev hires to get experienced PVPers. But that said.... I doubt it will ever happen. IMO Fallout 76 is a PVE game from here until eternity.
---
Lol my base is called “Fort Badass”
---
So, here are my two cents:
---
1. It's my belief that *most* (not all) PvP'ers aren't interested in a real fight.  What they actually want to do is harass other players.  We had PvP-only servers in Survival mode.  They didn't stay there.  They kept coming over into Adventure mode.  They knew they had both easy targets geared for PvE rather than PvP and a wide array of insurmountable exploits to use against them.
---
2. Game development is a zero-sum practice.  Developer time is finite, as are the dollars involved.  In a game where, by your own admission, the vast majority of players are in PvE, does it make sense to continue allocating resources into failed PvP modes?  Especially if this team seems incapable of thinking about the long-term welfare of these modes?  PvP isn't a one-and-done thing.  It requires a dedicated group for dealing with exploits and balancing problems.  We've seen in Survival and Nuclear Winter what happens when this group doesn't exist (or doesn't do their job well).  Personally?  I don't think they should continue throwing good money after bad, especially as PvE perennially struggles with meaningful content additions and bug fixes.
---
Saw a guys camp once easily a few hundred garden gnomes on display. Craziest collection I’ve seen and can only imagine the amount of time it took finding that gnome army .
---
As well as the numerous fixes and rebalancing PvP needs. I would really like to see PvP events that aren't shit. Monster Mash is one of the few events that can be pretty fun with a few friends or even some randoms. 
---
As far as workshop PvP goes there are a lot of various issues with it. I think the PvE crowd don't seem to want to accept that it's a PvP zone and says it before you can even claim it. That said I don't think some level 20 being mowed down by someone that is level 100+ is good for the game in anyway. What I would like to see is either different types of PvP specific areas added or giving the option to mark a workshop for PvP for extra resources from it. Mark a PvE workshop green and give the current resource rate and make PvP workshops drop double and Mark them red.
---
Claiming workshops hoping for PvP has generally been a waste of caps in my experience. My lowest level character I regularly play is 197. Too many people think level magically make someone better so I rarely get anyone that wants to fight other than people I've fought before. I think a Survival mode with no legendary gear would help ease a lot of people into enjoying PvP. Knowing how to spec a character for PvP seems to be the biggest issue for a lot of new people. Couple that with getting blasted by legacy weapons and instantly dying and that sours most people's experience.
---
Just as bad back then, if not worse... have had my camp destroyed for no good reason by high lvl players back when TSE was OP... several attacks to steal caps and junk when the limit for caps weren't in place... 
---
No less rough back then...
---
does it make you upset that you can't smoke weed in the game too?
---
I gave out a delta regarding the Blood Eagles - I had forgotten about the state-sponsored torture of Weasel.
---
I've been using the Final Word ever since I got it and it has served me well.
---
If I ever get a Furious FFR .50, Minigun or LMG I might switch but the RNG in this game hates me, so it's not a very likely scenario. :)
---
I had thought you might be - given the spreadsheet - regardless, keep on with your bad self. :)
---
Huh? What u smoking son lol.. Have u been to China? The majority of mainland Han Chinese are quite OK with Xi. There are plenty of other reasons China might want to ban the game, but allowing players to display patriotism with a flag sure ain't one of em haha
---
LOL, what pvp?, a proper pvp game has balance, a game where someone is killing everything in his path with his duped legacy tse gatling plasma/quad explosive tesla, flying forever thanks to cola nut, while eating scorchbeast steak's has no balance, you would have to remodel the whole game to make pvp fun. It would be much more easier to make a pvp arena where you would have to use non legendary weapons/armor from a carefully balanced selection, something like the arena weston takes you to but for players only.
---
Literally go to anywhere where there are enemies that wield guns (lower level areas are preferable due to being able to easily smack 1-shot enemies with a high level melee weapon even if you have nothing specced into melee), loot all the guns you can carry, equip Scrapper perk, and viola tons of steel.
---
For gunpowder just do that piss easy daily Responders event at Morgantown Airport for over 100 pre-war money to turn into gunpowder cloth. You can combine this with the above piss easy steel hoarding, and maybe even get some claim tickets off the Scorched for a different purpose.
---
For lead, go to Lucky Hole Mine while wearing a set of quest-completed Excavator power armor for literal hundreds of lead worth of ore. Aside from that, just highlight lead in the components list and you'll find that there's a lot more of it than you might think.
---
The only actual "farmed" material is acid, which can be tricky to get a lot of. Faschnact was amazing for acid since you could loot the hives hourly for shitloads of acid, but that's over.
---
Like the other allies he's a PITA when it comes to dialog
---
Easy with the personal attacks there, buddy. OP is correct, you are wrong. You can leave an ongoing event via the Pip Boy, which drops you from the event team and enables PvP handshakes. So if Scorched Earth is going on, a griefer could drop from the event, stand in front of people hoping they don't have Pacifist enabled, and then kill them if they accidentally initiate PvP.
---
I run bloodied stealth commando and rely on VATS alot much like you. Grim reapers sprint is a no brainer so is fully ranked concentrated fire.
---
I also run below 20% health most of time with nerd rage. To make this work I have couple of defensive perks:
---
- Life-giver, at 20% these 45 points of health really do make a difference. Ditch fireproof and put a dense mod in you chest piece. You get the same results.
---
There is also a bug with this perk if you have the speed demon mutation (but no healing factor mutation) that will give you magical health regen to 45 pt of health, even in combat. Been there since day one.
---
- Fully ranked Blocker. So you won’t get one shot by melee. Really useful against ghouls. I would recommend ditching bandolier for this. You don’t need to carry all of your ammo with you.
---
- Serendipety. Obviously.
---
And lastly stealth. It is *the* best defensive and offensive ability in the game. I would recommend maxing sneak. There is literally no limit to sneak, *all of it stacks*, shadowed, perks legendary effects, you name it.
---
I personally run full unyielding thorn armor with bloodied fixer, the queen can be in my face and she won’t detect me while I shoot at her.
---
Edit: to manage rads, use diluted radaway and diluted rad-x, to gain rads, find a water source and start collecting or shoot gamma gun at your feet.
---
Here is my build:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f444ce&amp;d=ao0an2ar2pl2pk2pd2pp2l71lk2p02a30a03l12ir2c72sg2la2ii0ee2lt2&amp;w=ij2at1iq2if2&amp;m=c1f35942&amp;n=One-Tap%20Commando%20V10
---
Hopefully this will help you maximize your damage potential, while remaining relatively tanky.
---
Are you going to go into build mode during the fight and try to build a roof over her? Lol
---
I'm not subbed but I'd definitely say the potential is what keeps me reading the media and sometimes logging in to build. 
---
That said, I have doubts they'll ever make good use of that potential unless they open up mods. The pace of updates is just way too slow and new problems are introduced as old problems are removed. At this rate it could take them 5 years to really have this game up to snuff.
---
Come on down to Ted's wood shop and and other fine goods Emporium where you can find wood and other fine goods.
---
The older I've gotten I just personally can't derive fun from pvp anymore like I used to...I jsut prefer solo and coop experiences now. Not sure how Bethesda ever expected this to work
---
[https://fed76.info/weapons/](https://fed76.info/weapons/)
---
Same problem in my last CAMP location, fixed it when I moved  my CAMP elsewhere because it seems to be caused when placing foundations in uneven terrain (at least I think that is how it works).
---
Very true. The only MTX I really have an issue with are the repair kits, since they actually help you in the game and aren't just cosmetic.
---
Just from my camp on the ground I can make it from R&amp;G Station to Huntersville. I love the springboard! (I just built it so I could fly to foundation)
---
P.S, I bring my house to every SBQ battle. So I build and enhance and test my defenses regularly and thus know my sht :)
---
I've even created mega structures out of 1-3 Blueprints and learned how to scale down their materials without degrading efficiency. 
---
That's why I want diagonal tiles so much,  takes up less space, less materials.
---
Is there a list of what's new? I just built a new motel, looks pretty cool but already thinking of changing as my budget is non existent with such a big structure.
---
Point #1 combined with point #2 meant the mode was dead on arrival. They closed some exploits, but they STILL haven't removed glitched guns and legacy weapons from the game.
---
I might give you a look. I have some pretty good gear at the moment, one of my weapons is a 2-star hunting rifle that ignores armor.
---
I have a Zealot's Primed LMG with Limb Damage &amp; Faster Fire Rate - it absolutely shreds the Queen &amp; kills regular SB's in about 1 second (Legendaries don't even get to mutate).
---
Thanks for fixing the inside of Berkely workshop for me. I appreciate that!
---
Yeah, it's progressively gotten worse. I've made some good trades there, but you are right, lately it's all B2525's and Legacies. But, I will say it is still better than the markets on Facebook. They are atrocious. Still asking for B2525's and Legacies, but only want to trade duped Christmas presents or Fasnacht masks.
---
I must of been lucky then because I never really encountered it. I remember when my tse was OP tho, killed me more times than it killed enemies lol.
---
I remember the old trick pvp'ers used to do with one being wanted and the others cloaked so you didn't know they were there. Only fell privy to that once and after a while you kind of notice when they are pulling that trick to avoid it
---
Is there a vetkoek recipe in game?
---
Legendary drop from SBQ?
---
I am a huge fallout fan. Own quite a bit of FO inspired stuff irl. Haven't played fo76 in quite awhile now..but i stay on here cuz some peoples stories, houses etc are worth it. The game may be lackluster but the community is awesome
---
Exactly it’s fucking stupid. Pvp like that isn’t even fun.
---
Ffrr .50 Cal is a beast! Although the recoil is a pain to stay on target for Furious to kick in properly.
---
Yeah I'm still looking.  Will you be on tonight? IGN is j0hnicus.  I've got some legendaries I would be willing to trade.
---
Really?
---
I didn't know that was a thing.  Interesting.
---
I always found it stupid that it turns it off by default. That said I killed a level 94 and a level 12 when they decided to attack my level 8 character. I was surprised at how had they were and how easy it was to kill them with a level 5 pipe pistol.
---
The fix they implemented while they had the vendors offline only addressed the related dupe exploit. They didnt fix the shuffling.
---
They would just release scrapbox skins as the monthly F1st freebies. Most of them other than the Atomic Camo skins have been skins for 1st exclusive items anyway, like the skins for the Ranger Armor or Survival Tent.
---
Hopefully. Right now I use the drop glitch method to skink it into a cabinet an hide it.
---
Nuka grape soda from the soda fountain 2nd fl. In White Springs removes rads with no side effects.
---
I feel a *little* bad about this, but every time something breaks like that from the Atomic shop I immediately submit a ticket requesting a refund. They have - so far - refunded the Atoms every time but not actually removed the items from me. I figure as long as they continue to break items, I'll continue to request they fix them or reinstate my Atoms.
---
Imo they should also remove VATS, and Tesla Rifles from PvP
---
They get real mad when I fuck them over using the pistol you start with though
---
Yeah, but on the other hand of that every time you fight the queen you get about 4 untradable versions of those that repair weapons and armour to 150% rather than 100% from the store
---
I have like 40/50 of those at all times lmao
---
And the weapon artisan and fix it good perks repair weapons and armour to 200%, so the store kits aren't as good as either in game option
---
The technical state of this game is a shame.
---
Nearly nothing is without bugs, descriptions are often wrong and all that over 1.5 years after release. Add on top that most stuff is literally copied from Fallout4. What the hell are the devs even doing?
---
I don't get it. Are you there to trade, or get recognition and understanding for your puny human feelings? It's not like the whole trade system is stacked against you - you're just letting your emotions get in the way.
---
What determines a "fair" trade? If a person sells low because they don't know what it's worth, then they get their "fair" trade in return for their impatience. If someone doesn't know the value of an item and sells it for less than half of it's worth, they get their "fair" trade for their lack of research. If someone researches the price of an item, negotiates properly, and waits patiently for the right trade - they get their "fair" trade.
---
Despite what my Communist Collectron thinks, this isn't a communism. We aren't here to give you "nice items". You get what you earn. You are complicit in the trade. There is no gun to your head. There is no time limit saying you must accept the first offer. Research an item to find it's worth, don't buckle under lowball offers, and wait patiently for the right offer. If you did those things, you never would've been driven to making this post in the first place. So what exactly is not fair? 🤔
---
As a builder, a lot of the camp items are also pretty bad. The atom shop is not particularly good for a builder, which is made worse by the fact that the base game rarely updates with new camp items. Every Tuesday I come looking to see what's new to the atom shop and most of the time I just sigh and walk away because it's either weird, ugly, or just not what I'm looking for. 
---
They're especially bad at updating structural camp stuff like walls variants, roofs, floors, glass windows, etc., though that's been a bit better lately with the wallpaper variety and contemporary set. If they focused on a lot of new stuff like that, as well as more detail objects that can be used more than once like containers, chairs, plants, etc., then I'd be spending regularly on this game and having a great time.
---
You can get better Repair Kits in game, plus there's Workbenches never far away!
---
how to fix nuka spammers: add a new card that inflicts reduced healing effects on the target ala Grevious Wounds from LoL.
---
or ya know, a 5 second timer between nuka effects and remove the ability to stack them. PVE players would never notice those changes.
---
If that's how you feel about it, then stop playing. Take your own advice and move on to something new.
---
His meat is all gristle. You want a nice plump Blood Eagle which comes with the extra chem flavoring.
---
Used a courier once through the 76 market an they scammed me. Never again.. reported to admins with SS of convo etc. Said because the actual scam wasnt caught on video they cant help me. Even though I had discord DMS of them admitting they took off with my items.
---
It's a disappointing week, the July 4th stuff couldn't come next reset? You know, when it would make more sense
---
Hey if you're on PC, I can hook you up with the fixer plan (IGN is Ephesos). The dragon is trade only and probably not for sale, it's my "holy shit fuck around" gun.
---
Yeah, I meant that they can't monetize the Scrap Boxes even more, without devaluing 1st.
---
I've had more fun exploring in this game than any other fallout game tbh. I love just spending time building camps and stuff and opening shop and letting people come see it. Would say that a common complaint which is fairly true is there is a lack of endgame, but it is what you make it. Went on last night and was pretty bored until the server got hot with back to back scorch beast queen fights and Encryptid etc. Really is great played at your own pace.
---
Thank God, i can save atoms for the vertibird PA.
---
Seems like your post history is only to rip into games about miniature bugs.
---
Check out angry turtles op stealth commando, it works a treat for me.
---
You want to get your health down to 20%. 
---
For a sneak commando build, get yourself leather uny pieces. But they’re few and far between Rn. I’m struggling to find them.
---
If u leaving then gimme your stuff 🤭
---
Dude hell yea! Thatd be so awesome and as far as i know it shouldnt even be that hard to pull off. A hard meta would evolve as far as perks are concerned but thatd happen anyway. Oh and no vats, that shit is cheese (alter vats centric perk cards). Simple, brutal and it gives everyine a lil something. Pvpers will get their nut and if you mostly pve you can still do that, just go out for a farming run, run back to base, depot your loot and roofcamp if you suck at pvp. Wishful thinking tho.....none of this will ever happen : /
---
The moveable quick camp is nice, I've had first for 2 months and still havent opened a private server yet, and literally the only reason I pay is for the scrap box because I'm a hoarder. The free atoms for stuff in the atom shop is mostly irrelevant for me.
---
They have all the stats they need to see how people play, and I think fallout has a lot of hoarder type players. 
---
The scrap box will never be free, because it's one of the main value props for it, which is clear by everyone wanting it.
---
Good data, much appreciated. 
---
I (used to) run Kinetic Dynamo in my PA for dodgy, but KD is completely broken and no longer works with WL. Gonna swap to assembly now
---
Great post. Clear, concise, constructive
---
I keep coming back for the melts on reddit...
---
Where’s the mf garage
---
Not really for sale, and it'd take a lot for trade.
---
Thank you! Yes, it's our state motto...Mountaineers Are Always Free!
---
Is it time for me to complain about the garage yet?
---
.
---
WHERE MY GARAGE
---
What level would you consider to be "Endgame?" I see that there's tons of more dangerous regions to explore when you're Level 50+. Figured there'd be plenty to do in those places.
---
You got your flag, but you have to pay.
---
PC, unfortunately.
---
Vertibird PA?
---
What the hell happened to RedRocket Garage prefab? Did it ended up get deleted from the game asset?
---
Just cripple it's legs and it will be powerless like all other big enemies.
---
But what does that achieve really?   
---
If you don't expect of somebody for something to change it won't?   
---
I want to like this game it pushes me back on every single step.
---
you can decline the event with your pip boy. thats was the worst trick in survival mode. someone would start encryptid then decline the event and absolutely slaughter everyone while they tried to fight the robot.
---
I've heard it said that you should go for the two star until you can find a really great main that fits your build style. It's quite a bit cheaper to roll for that over and over. Once you have that you then can go for the 3 stars. I'm a sneaky vats build and lucked out the day the vendor shops opened back up and managed to nab a two star instigating explosive lever action rifle. I had been rolling a while for it so I knew what to look for and swooped on one for under 4k caps the second I saw it. It's not perfect and could have had  a 3rd vats boosting or two shot perk as well, but it's my *Bamboozler* and damn near one-shots whatever I point it at. 
---
Down side of rolling 2 stars is you wont get as much return on scrip for your junk rolls or as much caps reselling your decent rolls that you do not intend on keeping.
---
Damn, wish I could've seen it! Any surviving screenshots?
---

Update 20
---
Meh...
---
This was discussed last week. Speculating that there is some budget exploit going on with it that made them held back on releasing it.
---
Yo I'm missing garage on my burger.
---
New PA skin that was determined. It's a BoS item, its jetpack is vertibird rotor blades , and its pretty badass overall
---
I would play Survival mode if they made it similar to the Dust/Frost mods: extremely harsh survival, full PvP, no Legendaries, death deletes your character.
---
Yup, Ephesos. Discord handle is ephesossh#7715, which is an easier way to get a hold of me.
---
Lol brutal. Glad I haven't discovered that yet.  Thanks for the warning  !
---
Amen! And it keeps vending interesting between the various dupe fiascos.
---
Thank you for posting!!!
---
I have seen this before too.  Showed up not really paying attention where it was placed on the map.  Got there and checked the map again to make sure I wasn't in the blast radius and noticed fsp was outside of the blast zone, by more than just a little sliver.  I chuckled a bit but she still spawned after impact.
---
I have also one time seen the fissure get hit and no queen.  Only one time though out of hundreds.  There was already a nuke zone active there when I joined the server so I'm not sure if they nuked it too soon after the first one and that caused it or what.
---
I say endgame in terms of finishing all base quests, wastelanders and side quests. When your quest log is empty and all you have is repeatable dailies and events it can be a little samey. I've got to this point after about 300 hours though, so even if you get a little bored with doing events etc, it's still well worth the money invested. I paid £12 for the game second hand before wastelanders came out, that's well worth the 300 hours I've spent, and now I'm a fallout first subscriber! Looking forward to the new update for seasons.
---
Next week is a Free States pack
---
Think it worked!
---
Well, if you're on PC, I'd just want to know what you have for trade. If you wanna negotiate, hit me up on Discord, it's easier: ephesossh#7715
---
Glad to know I’m not going crazy. About 10 mins after I logged in yesterday, I got a notification  somebody had bought my marine armor helmet and 2 insurgent outfits. I never placed those in my vendor or display case and thought maybe it was just a glitch.
---
I went to my camp and checked my stash, sure enough the outfit pieces were gone and I definitely did not receive any caps for it.
---
If you're going after a bloodied build, fuck yeah.
---
You cant have limb damage and ffr on the same gun, those are both Major modifiers.
---
Make use of the tent be it free fast travel to the other side of the map, or at a hotspot, or anything in between. Pick up EVERYTHING and scrap that bad boy. Hard habit to get out of when you’re used to being selective, but grab it all and put it in the scrap box. Even if you cancel 1st you can still access all your scrap in the scrap box, you just can’t add to it anymore, so after a month if you cancel you effectively have “free” massive amounts of scrap stored for free.
---
Edited content below for more info-
---
It’s safe to transfer in your own private world as long as you’re careful what you click. I was unaware of this until the other day, someone on here posted about transferring items using a case at a station then loading back in with your other character quickly and picking them up. 
---
I’d love to give credit to the guy who posted but I’m on mobile and can’t search right now effectively. Make sure you do it fast, the servers are as stable as they can be and don’t click adventure when you’re logging in with the second toon and you’ll be golden.
---
Yeah, unlike the rest of the game which we didnt pay for. :)
---
It just works.
---
I wanted to like this game and I do like it... 
---
It's like that person that has flaws, but you accept as he/she is... 
---
Or like others suggested, simply move on if you can't accept that and make new friends with someone else  \[other game\]...
---
I mean, that's basically what happens if you don't run back and defend it during a wave even if you've got it all set up with turrets and what not. Why not just have a defense timer and if it runs out with them not showing up, the workshop becomes unclaimed again?
---
Well even though those are just random dailies without much debt I'll take the bait:  
---
Maybe the Raiders are just bad a keeping their tech in working order, why we have to scavenge the wasteland every second day for the same components because they can't be bothered to be carefull with such complicated electronics while the Settlers are more competent with theirs and know how to keep it running on their own. The other Raider daily is also a bit more complex, you get sent after a poor person by Roxxy similar to her other hunters that she sent, just to make sure somebody completes the job one way or the other and she makes clear what goal she has when she sents you on your way. Dare you to come back and try to tell her the ex-Raider just wanted a change of life and rather wants to be a settler in Foundation instead, you can't. The only option for you is to tell her one way or another the job is done, you sometimes even have to lie about killing the raider instead of just being honest and tell her he fell victim to somebody else.
---
Meanwhile the Foundation daily is a simple theft, somebody stole important equipment and got away. There's not much to defend here as the Raiders or whoever might've taken it could have also asked for help if they had wounded people that needed treatment or asked for the knowledge to build a similar device on their own. Instead some Raiders even have the guts to tell you when asked that they intent to resell it as it looked valuable. Even as an ally of the Raiders or even both it shouldn't change the outcome, especially a ally should be able to tell you if you do wrong there might be consequences that might not be to your preference. If the thief dies Ward even shows regret and that it shouldn't have to come that far while Roxxy is just glad her problem 'vanished' and occasionally also expresses her disappointment in some hunters being unable to kill their prey she sent them after.
---
Oops....I meant faster reload. You’re correct.
---
Happy 23th!!
---
Wow, another absolutely terrible ATOM shop.
---
anyone know the difference between scabber and waster raider bundles? so confusing
---
they could make it so only assassin weapons deal damage to other players. boom, everyone got roughly the same gun.
---
My kingdom for a diagonal wall.
---
I'd say that you're getting bored after 300 levels, then the game did its job. So many folks want a game they can never get bored with, but that just seems like an unreasonable expectation. Especially for a game like this that is not so FOMO like Destiny or WoW.
---
Thanks! Been around since beta so I've accumulated some stuff.
---
"Safe" except the ever looming possibility of a server crash.Beyond that, as long as you log back into your private server within 10-15 mins its safe.
---
Loot and scrap EVERYTHING.
---
I use my tent as a fast travel point, leave it outside foundation and get a free fast travel there, which makes it cheaper to get to the bog etc from my camp.
---
In terms of transferring, haven't tried it myself but will be soon with a mule.
---
Please don't activate the terminal down there... it'll cause the friendlies to charge at the Alpha and they'll get killed in one hit
---
Zealots wouldn't be a bad option to start with but executioners would do well for second half of her hp
---
Good shout! I never knew how much crap I hoarded until I took out all my scrap. Just cleared about 600ibs!
---
I have so much acid from running Vault 94 raids so often, I can hook you up lol
---
You know nothing about Chinese government. Anything involving China can trigger them and result in a temporary or permanent ban, regardless what a role China plays in the game. 
---
When I said cultural confidence, it's actually a quote from Xi being sarcastic, while Chinese government can see any kind of criticism as an anti-China statement. You thought those who are active online represent Chinese? Naive. 0.6 billion Chinese's monthly income is lower than USD142 and you expect them to be grateful to Chinese government? Only 72 million Chinese make more than USD708 per month, which is roughly 5% of the whole population. The data is from the minister of China.
---
Sounds awsome man! I had a kind of a small military compound there once, but could never get The other players to use it during scorched earth
---
Pick up everything you see and shove it in your scrapbox. Put your tent at an opposite end of the map from your camp and get free fast travel. Bonus points if it's by crater or foundation. Go on private, claim the munitions factory hemlock holes and a power plant and then rebuild your camp and stock you vendors in peace and quiet. Do Uranium Fever and One Violent Night alone and reap the rewards. 
---
As for transferring stuff, there is still risk, but if you use a 0/0 world container and immediately switch characters and go back to private being extra careful not to accidentally choose adventure and close down your private world then you can almost always safely transfer stuff. But being a Bethesda product private servers will still crash or glitch and you can lose your stuff. But your biggest risk is your own self accidentally clicking the wrong thing or waiting more than five minutes which is the shut down for private worlds.
---
Yep. Guarantee this is what's the issue. Anything that has 2 variations where the variations cost different budgets will cause this glitch. They need to normalize the budgets..
---
No its just fall speed, however it does add +4 agility which will improve your sneak and AP points, so its not technically incorrect.
---
ETA: Its description has been wrong for a while in the PIP boy.
---
Primed gauss minigun is my current go-to. It's beastly. I use a Bloodied now, and a Furious before I rolled that one, and both are damned good.
---
Good shout, thanks dude!
---
"update"
---
Nothing is new.
---
I agree completely, and I'm not really bored - I still play daily! Just saying that can be conceived as a general complaint from what I've read on here in this community.
---
Start filling up your Scrap box. Pick up and scrap everything you find, as much as your weight limit allows. Make sure you have Scrapper active when scrapping weapons and armor. Before long you’ll be full of scrap and never have to go out looking for something you need. Imo this is one of the best things about F1st, how it removes the need to scavenge for scrap. 
---
As for moving items between characters, F1st makes this much easier than using a public server but keep in mind that a private server is not 100% reliable. Don’t use one to transfer any item that is irreplaceable.
---
You know how you make survival better ? 
---
1. All loot and gear drops on death.
---
2. No fast travel, but fast travel alternative
---
3. Seperate characters 
---
4. replace damage perks with effective handling
---
5. More crafting options (looking at you bullets and farming)
---
 
---
There's more but this would be pretty "wasteland survival" to me lol
---
Thanjs bud. I'll make a note of it
---
Tbf, if there's a vast level difference going on, you shouldn't get *any* rewards for PKing. A level 200 capping a level 5 or 10 is not a challenge, so they shouldn't get a reward for it.
---
Nah dude I prefer the scorched, you can feel the bacteria flowing thru and I really like the green crunchy bits
---
It is, because they don't even know about the enclave at this time. You're trying to twist this into a pedantic argument.   
---
There is zero evidence in canon pointing to knowledge about the enclave at this time.   
---
We know that they know about Mariposa, but that has zero ties to the enclave as a group.
---
Mosaic tiles, here I come
---
I hear ya there bud.  So tired of seeing 5000k serums in vending its obscene!  Did you expect to sell 4 serums to pay for the recipe? Its just a rip off  then if you say anything they lose it.  As for weps I price check them on fed76 and sell for lowest value in most cases. Im not selling script fodders just not top tier gear. Sick of paying Todd! When you go over though or gotta shut it down on people it sucks.
---
All power armors need love. They are so ass right now. As soon as you get up in the levels and get some decent armor you start realising how gimped pa really is. id argue that most high level players wont ever step foot in their pa unless theyre doing sbq (i dont even running a bloodied build), and even then its best to just pull her out of the radzone anyway...#makepagreatagain
---
True. A nice plump bloated glowing one has a nice tang to it as well, but all that fat goes right to your hips.
---
We get a full page warning that we can now be attacked, but nowhere does it say how to prevent it.
---
Ahh okay, will spawns reset if I leve the orivate server then go back to it or would I have to go onto adventure mode then back to the private server?
---
950+ hours in! No sign of stopping so far
---
Can the Liberty Prime be muted?
---
I think it's worth it, and to save money, I'd subscribe for only a month to build up scrap, then re-subscribe only when I needed to store more scrap.
---
Thanks dude. Noted!
---
If you wana feel even worse there are countless people running around on PC with clean versions that came from dev room and no one cares \*shrugs\*
---
Yw, have fun.
---
If you click on the bundles it lists what's inside, they have different items
---
I feel the same way the other vaults are the same color as vault 76 and your camp is a yellowish color so why not as a vault dweller I’m able to fast travel to other vaults for free
---
R.I.P Mr. Spike
---
I have nuked Morgantown once (on my private server) but only because I live in WV and hate Morgantown.
---
I was chocknfullno junk after a sbq fight but super low health due to rads, popped a radaway and instadied.....GG
---
Hope to hell it will work with t65.  I don't have all the pieces still because I don't like the torso and helmet and there is no way to skin it.  Still rocking some t51 parts on my suit.
---
I screwed up and bought plans for the plasma caster not knowing what a piece of shit weapon it is and didn’t know it couldn’t be sold.  Sure, I can cash it in for 40 scrip but it sucks you can’t sell them
---
Ah, the good old days! HeHe. I'm good thanks though! Snallygasters down at the Flooded Trainyard is the new farm!
---

---
Wait till next week when patch 20 and seasons is suppose to drop. Better of saving atoms anyways.
---
I laughed way too hard at this
---
I think the crater and foundation should become a free fast travel if you have neighborly with both factions
---
Jesus Christ, another fine example of how Bethesda can never fucking win. Look back at essentially every other holiday where they waited until the last minute to add themed stuff to the shop and people freaked out that they were only able to decorate for a few days. Now when they release holidays stuff a week ahead you still have people's whining about how it's too early.
---
I forget I have the cannibal perk and I accidentally eat some nasty stuff just trying to jump
---
A few people now saying similar things so maybe it's just random and actually unrelated that it happened to my display item. I logged off so quickly, no idea if I got caps for it or not.
---
What trickery let's you see underwater?
---
Spawns are a little weird in 76 and have cooldowns for your character. You can get Whitespring ghouls to respawn every 10 minutes for example, but world containers won't respawn until you get stuff from enough other ones. Also stuff like power armor frames and magazines and bobbles dont show up as often in private worlds because there are fewer players getting them to load in. Angryturtle did a great video explaining how spawns work.
---
They have lost thousands of players because they neglected the pvp aspect of the game. So many friends have stopped playing. Its sad this game used to be so fun griefing and even survival was fun. Now its just farming and that gets so boring. We used to have a blast pvping in 76. Wish they would figure it out because I think a lot of people would be back.
---
Almost like letting us see what server we're joining would be a *benefit*. Instead we get the "feature" of "never seeing" the server we're joining. Ffs, if we *could* see what server we were joining, we could *deliberately* join PvP-on or PvP-off servers.
---
They still doing some changes with CAMPs this Summer? They may have budget fixes planned for that.
---
Those rapair kits really are pretty useless when you start joining scorched earth. Scrapkits are more useful in my opinion
---
The jet pack will probably work, hopefully the rests works. I just finished my T65 set after getting the SS set and gauss shotgun and I like it. Just saving up for the jetpack now
---
I hate them all honestly, because without fail one of them is on their way or already in the act of using the workbench i need when I return. Every single fucking time.
---
So of course with 4th of July stuff they are on time but Halloween stuff and such happens on the day of?
---
Finally, I can buy the Scabber Bundle, the globe, and the umpire outfit.
---
Been waiting for the scabber handmade skin!  Does anyone know if you have to buy the bundle?  Or can you buy it on its own?
---
You got kicked because of your base
---
Agreed I think they released the 4th of July stuff too early as it could have waited till next week. With next week being the next update I would hope they put in something nice or special
---
That looks really exciting, but even still there have been datamines older than patch 20 that still have items never sold.
---
Ahh okay, thank you. Yeah, I just checked a couple power armor stations and they were empty
---
I crafted an AA one last night, but a bloodied one..hah, doesn't exist!
---
If it still doesn't work for you, scrap Beckett's Bar, quit, and rebuild it. The questline will pick up at the last save point.
---
Does it apply to workshop ownership as well?
---
Don't forget to go kill Mirelurks at the raider fishing camp next to the Nuka Cola factory, doesn't give much rep but still better than nothing.
---
I agree so much I have been thinking about how cool it would look at my camp waving in the air I would also enjoy it more then my meat week flag but also I would not want it tattered I would hope it would be like the clean wall mounted flag we already have.
---
Wouldn't there be a backlash for people who traded near God rolls or paid real cash for one?
---
They actually drop the 4th of July stuff a bit early, next week would've been ideal.
---
They need to fix the dam servers! 3 times in one day I was dropped off my private map...😒
---
Straight up garbage again i think the only decent one is the scrabber raider bundle for those that like the raiders... kind of a shame that the atom shop updates have been wacky since they have have so much cool stuff that haven't appeared in a while
---
I was excited for today's shop update but I clicked and saw what it was and I immediately got disappointed. Just rehashing old items. I get that they want to give everyone a shot at grabbing them. But from what I seen, it's literally nothing new at all. Of course no FO 1ST items either. 😩
---
Sadly, this is the way. I don't have time to research and use the latest exploits/aimbots/addons. I just want to play at this point. So I avoid pvp.
---
Who cares. If you’re THAT stupid to trade god rolls and real money for a hacked weapon that has no guarantee of lasting, you deserve losing the weapon even more.
---
The thing is a scourge in PvE and PvP alike.
---
Yea this is the first time I've ever made a complaint about it and even seen a complaint about it. If they released it on the 30th reset people would have 5 days. They only released this early because they don't have jack shit to release this week so they recycled the old July 4th stuff so they can release some new July 4th items next week
---
Yees. Forgot.
---
The amount you people complain about shit you don't even have to buy is astounding. Personally I'm gonna be spending easy 2000 atoms. The porch bundle, vending machines, vending machine posters, and maybe one of the discounted bundles. As a new player I'm loving the stuff I'm able to get that I couldn't get before
---
Farm the rep first then finish.  You can max both regardless, but this gives you the best jump on it
---
This is the first fqllout game I've played where I didnt puck a female character. And thats only because feme fatal isn't in the game.
---
Guess who is going on a spending spree with there 3500 saved up atoms with daily and weekly challenges.
---
Thankfully there is a new datamined outfit for fo1st but yeah it's been really lackluster.
---
I play for 2 month again now after a year of pause. There are several items that where also into the shop the past 2 months .... The liberty prime skin for example. Meeh
---
I saw a post saying next week is Update 20, so there will be items to go along with that, but I agree this has been one of the worst atom shop updates yet.
---
when do I know that I need to stop doing the main quest and start the farm? I'm at the mission to give them the nuka-cola
---
Action Hero is pretty damn effective given FFR and it’s a 50 cal.  Only downside is you burn through ammo quicker than Tony Montana snorts coke.
---
Separate them *and* don't go giving either one bonuses that the other doesn't get. Otherwise you lose the whole point of separating them in the first place because the folks in the server that didn't get the bonus will go to the server that did to try and get them.
---
Yawn.... though I can’t remember ever seeing that raider waster power armor, maybe I missed it at some point
---
Wish they were mutable.  Gets really old hearing about how Sofia met a stranger and over time...well they're not a stranger anymore. She doesn't believe in fate or luck, or any of that.... SHUT UP.
---
I did watch someone else's Sofia take on the queen the other day since their camp was nearby, she was just blasting away with her pipe revolver.  Was hoping to see her get taken down lol.
---
In my head canon Ward places these items with trackers on them intentionally in plain site to bait the raiders in so he has justification for sending his death squad out to the rest of foundation.
---
Basically Ward it the most bloodthirsty non-blood eagle raider in the game waging a shadow war from behind the walls of foundation against all the other raider gangs.
---
Ward is the most effective raider boss in the whole game so far, and he is going to come off looking like a good guy in the end.
---
It wouldn't reach through the wall, but 4-5 shots with an explosive pipe rifle and it popped right out. https://imgur.com/a/s2faMh1
---
Tired with some other cases in her house, but not all of the objects are items you can interact with. https://imgur.com/a/I0aMFrT
---
If youre on PC, its done with the custom ini tweaks. Believe its the effect from turning off bokeh, radial blur and depth of field.
---
I saw one earlier this week that seemed to be 5x5 I think (might have been bigger).  She landed multiple times.
---
Once i discovered how much more convenient and how much more weight you can carry without PA with correct armor, i just quitted using it. Kinda sad.
---
When you get a "Siding with.." quest don't do it until you've done all the quests for the other faction.  Once you have both "Siding with" quests you can choose which one to proceed with.
---
Every day is Independence Day for those using Liberty Prime PA
---
Don’t forget to use contractor perk rank 2 for 50% off building materials. Really helped me build mine when I was finally able to
---
You can craft a muted variant.
---
Why do you complain about it lol? I can't remember a single game the past years that where completely without, bugs, lags glitches ect.
---
And if you like the hole franchise why not play it.
---
Meh. I like his little radio I usually use it. Also hes given me the best quest to where I got the best weapons in return. 3* junkie fixer from his weapons crate quest.
---
thanks man, gonna do it then
---
Well I’m not looking into cheating for something I’ll just put on my ally so I will silently feel sorry for my self
---
I just want the rootin tootin cowboy hat :(
---
I actually landed a JE LMG w/15% reload speed and with the right perks and chems it’s a lot like the QE harpoon or Bloodied Gamma FFR.  Silly weapon
---
no, trying to make a platform, in height about 2-3 stories, so can focus on SBQ only.
---
I’m glad they are making most power armor skins universal, hopefully they add some t-65 ones soon
---
Comes with a silent helmet option but from my experience I still hear rambles occasionally.
---
Every day is Independence Day when your wiping the filth from American soil and reclaiming what is ours
---
hm, 5x5 seems small, but gotta try it. thanks.
---
If they do take these suggestions, I hope they don’t completely nerf cola but. It’s one of the few interesting perks, and while you shouldn’t be able to tank the world, it should still provide strong benefits.
---
I stopped giving my allies new outfits because that seemed to stop them giving quests. I've had no problems since then.
---
found this thread bc i had the same issue. I’m not sure if you can just find a keycard but i ended up finding a terminal, quickly finding password clues, and printing my own.
---
Where is the damn fridge
---
Yes both voiced armors have a talking and silent option
---
Yeah I already saw the other comments, sadly I'm on ps4, thanks for the proposal amyway
---
Wow good for you. Last one I did for that turd got me a nocturnal combat knife. WTF..
---
I think a few newer ones work with T65, heard hellfire works too work it. I hope they update everything to be universal. Would get them alot of points with the players base
---
Instead of separating PvP and PvE servers, why not use the arena in Watoga after completing the Wastelanders quest line? Allow players to sign up to fight against each other. Allow spectators and/or the fighters themselves to wager some caps on the fights. Turn it into an actual Colosseum.
---
Yeah but they put this shit out because they have nothing left and this tells me they must have good stuff planned for that week
---
A real night would be really awesome. Also could show off all the effort I put into lighting at my camp and make laser weapons look really cool
---
I knew I should have saved my atoms up. I'm trying to get all the raider stuff, but i didn't expect two bundles this time around.
---

---
I often listen to music whilst playing so the voices don’t really bother me that much, it’s just that I swear they do it on purpose. Literally the exact bench I want every time. If they’re not at it physically I am left spamming the button whilst it’s telling me it’s being used because they’re walking to it from the other side of the base. 
---
I ended up moving base and scrapping her console. I had the bright idea later to place loads of musical instruments down and now instead of workbenches, the old prick when I had him down briefly was either twanging away on the guitar or telling me to pull his finger.
---
We can only hope that one day it is available to us regular folks who play by the rules.
---
I had an exploding harpoon. Thing sucked but apparently is legacy.  Scripped it.
---
Especially the excavator skins, those are gorgeous but only available on that armor
---
Finish main first, so you can start receiving Treasurery Notes while you grind the rep. If you focus on the rep first, you'll miss out on Gold.
---
So instead of the trend of putting holiday items out after the holiday they're putting them out excessively early? Progress!
---
Yep. Just took a screenshot of a 14:1 offer for a single "legacy" this morning. 
---
Met a pretty nice guy who wanted an explosive Gatling plasma. He had a TSE Gatling laser and an AA fixer to offer. Sent him the screenshot of the 14:1 trade offer and he was defeated.
---
"as a new player" in one ear and out the other.
---
Just comics, displays items and bobbleheads need to use no budget and I'm happy again. This will give me about 40% budget back lol
---
I've worn both the stealth armor and helmet since Wastelander's update and I've never experienced this. I wonder if it's just certain people? Have you tried scrapping the helmet and then building a new one?
---
Yeah, combat is just way too clunky with the engine to try to think about doing pvp on the main servers.
---
It's great for the new players and I'm glad you're getting a lot of use out of the shop this week but for day one players, it's disappointing and kinda shits on them. We pretty much own all this stuff already. So we basically got nothing this week.
---
Wow, another disappointing week!  This is like, what, the fifth week in a row of just crap?  At this rate people no longer need to buy Atoms.
---
And who thought it would be a good idea to add the 4th of July stuff this week?  Next week would have been more appropriate seeing as how July 4th is next next.
---
Bethesda, do you guys need some advice and tips on what to put in the Atomic Shop?  I’m dead serious when I ask this.  You guys seem out of touch with the Atomic Shop now, not just the game itself.
---
If you farm rep first, you're missing out on a large amount of Treasurery Notes / Gold. Best to finish the quests first, then focus on rep.
---
Protects me all the time. I have a handful of deep water purifiers and ot keeps me from getting diseased just about every time I go down there.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Well... I don't mind the idea of separating PVP and PVE entirely... presumably making it impossible to jump back and forth to get unique rewards from the PVP side. 
---
My main problem with PVP in PVE games has always been around trying to "balance" PVP at the expensive of PVE.
---
Yes next Tuesday which is the 30th I believe is when there supposed to release update 20.
---
Not just lack of interest, but the exclusive 3* named legendary weapons being exclusive to Survival meant PvE players felt forced to play a mode they didn't enjoy.
---
When they added leaderboards that made the Top 3 players visible, that was what killed it for a lot of other's, that you couldn't just play with the *risk* of being killed, that eventually, you *would*  be hunted down like a dog, just because you haven't died in an hour.
---
There's more too, but the mode was solid in itself, it was all the additions that made most people turn away, myself included.
---
They’re on all systems, Xbox and PlayStation didn’t even have to spawn them in there was a stash glitch that let you make them and they’re probably here to stay since they’ve been here this long
---
I'm okay with some skins that are specifically for only 1 set. The two raider skins are cool, but I'm okay with them just on excavator. As long as they are cheaper than universal skins I'm okay with it
---
the game isn't open source, what the fuck
---
Oof
---
Doesn't your mule have to be on the same time and server to transfer plans, etc...?
---
&gt;Yup. Really not a survival. In a "game challenge" and a "game genre" sense both.
---
Right, people wanna get salty when you say it but other than munching on food every 30 minutes or so to keep up your buffs no part of this resembles a survival game more than any other standard MMO.  Injuries are insignificant, no real environmental hazards, no permadeath, hunger and thirst become trivial the second you slap down a camp and a water purifier, resources are so plentiful that that your only concern is finding a place to stash it all.  
---
Most of the, "survival" elements of this game evaporate after you've played for an hour.
---
Update 20 i think.
---
Im sure I sold those on the spot, never thought those fat things would turn out so valuable today.
---
Im here because i love fallout, want to play 76 but not sure its worth the investment.
---
That's what I meant.  Farm the rep from the quests before siding with one faction and finishing.
---
I don't get why people are so mad when there's not something they want in the Atom Shop every week. Bethesda has to make stuff that appeals to everyone, and that means not everything is going to appeal to you or me specifically. 
---
What's more, if they released something I wanted to buy every week, I wouldn't be able to save up enough atoms to get it! I like it spaced out... are people in a rush to spend their money?
---
Do you know the date?
---
Melee builds are totally gimped for pvp, you can't kill a player with similar level and equipment, but on ranged ,no matter what you do. 
---
Guns are king, and that's not balanced.
---
Pvp needs a whole mess of adjustments to make melee builds fit the pvp environment.
---
Ghoul Slayers Gamma gun?
---
Its just silly the offers for the legacys,  holy lord. 14:1 thats nuts.
---
They added an alternative silent version of the LP PA helmet without its voicelines
---
I visited your base yesterday, loved it! Loved the vending machine with all wood weapons and armor.
---
Adhesive, Copper, HalluciGen gas canister, and a Stealth Boy.  I grow the components for adhesive in my camp.  You can find gas canisters lying around (try Camp McClintock) and Stealth Boys I usually get as random rewards from events.
---
Cool. Like with turrets?
---
Reasons why I hate PvP
---
1. Hackers
---
Yes, that test was with a brand new one and a previous test was with brand new as well. Cant say im lying as i have video proof right there that the helmet, by itself, doesnt work right.
---
Is that an actual thing? What would have caused me to get kicked?
---
Probably the funniest thing I saw recently was visiting someone’s camp and their Sofia walked right off of the really tall camp structure they had built and she hit the ground and went down.
---
Yes hopefully someday.
---
No way, it looks more menacing that way
---
I'm on PS4 - you?
---
meme harder
---
How to let q run it tho?
---
I use the jetpack on my SS armor so I cant use a dense mod
---
They were delayed. I think they are targeting the fall now.
---
Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M28dRqRi3xs) you may find useful-- it'll show you how you can work around the strange physics of the wall-mounted stash. Alternatively, there are [other things you can do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNARr5Mevxw) to make the wall stash "work" in a way that I find can be [aesthetically pleasing](https://imgur.com/a/LUFDZ97).
---
I have the gun completely modded with aligned
---
After i got my mr fuzzy costume about 6 months ago and saw it was dirty and spray painted i was disappointed for a minute. Then I shrugged and threw it in my stash.
---
Now i get 250 caps per token on my vendor. All well that ends well.
---
Legendary perks were removed from update 20. They are reworking them based on feedback from the PTS. No ETA that I'm aware of to add them back in.
---
ETA: Update 20 will be 6/30/20, but no Legendary Perks
---
I'll still side with the foundation. They actually try to build something to last. 
---
Raiding isn't even close to a sustainable practice, and they are clearly terrible at or unwilling to do anything else. Best case scenario they last a little longer than usual before everything implodes and you get a bunch of new raider factions.
---
That I do not know offhand. I'm not actually a first member.
---
That’s unfortunate
---
Next Tuesday June 30th I believe is the last I have heard of when update 20 was coming. Not sure if they will put legendary perks in though, so far their mostly focusing on public teams.
---
Ah, confusing. As you're not really *farming* if you're getting rep for doing the quests anyway.
---
Oh well. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Antique store or asylum or maybe a reward from technical data
---
I see thank you
---
&gt; There are lots of posts to the contrary.
---
That's just confirmation bias.
---
&gt; Do you have a source to support your statement?
---
Sure. [Here you go.](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/005A5E34)
---
I prefer the items the week before a holiday so you have more time to use them.  They have been really bad about not having seasonal items out before the season is almost over.
---
Cool! Thanks :)
---
So much meh.
---
I am really waiting for the new wooden flooring that was datamined a while back, was a new floor tiling and wall set.  Seemed to be with a Sheepsquatch headmount too.
---

---
Seemingly Bethesda is literally going to drop every single item they could possibly drop before that.
---
Try participating in lower-level events - they dump Stimpacks as random rewards.
---
Must've been technical data
---
&gt; I'll still side with the foundation. They actually try to build something to last.
---
Crater has also set up a profitable market enterprise at Ohio River Adventures - selling mirelurk products. All they ask for is a little help protecting their workshop from rampaging mirelurks. That, to me, is trying to build something to last!
---
Public teams with no text chat, sweet. Ill stay solo.
---
Did dis mufugga just break out a spreadsheet?
---
Three star legendary TPS report. 
---
Alright, no lie, I make to do lists with relevant links to “how to..” videos/articles/Reddit before I start each session.
---
Oh wow,  that would have been terrible. I could see how that failed
---
1k+ hours in and still finding enjoyment
---
I was using OP's terminology.  If you want to argue schematics do it with him. This is silly, lmao.
---
Love the t51 skin
---
I don't think you're lying. It doesn't surprise me that there is a bug in the armor. I'm going to try it out tonight to make sure my helmets working as intended.
---
I got a junkies furious rolling pin from the SBQ fight yesterday
---
Making that time gate even harder to open. Really does suck when you're a simple 100 bullion away from something cool, but you can't pick it up as it hasn't properly reset.
---
If you're worried about spending caps fast traveling....there is a perk for that.
---
Oh, yes please. PSN: gentlethorns
---
I can't wait for the One Appalachia update to see it will completely break the game haha
---
Yeah, and somebody else mentioned that you could leave events and attack people that way to grief them too, although, my memories a bit vague on that point: I remember people tried it, not whether it worked.
---
But yeah, it started interesting, and ended up leaving a bad taste in almost everyone's mouth, no matter which side you fall on.
---
Think of it as a blessing in disguise and hope they actually make the perks... legendary, as they put it. Because right now they’re lackluster and uninspired.
---
Vampire's Explosive Shovel (Charisma +1).
---
Sounds good to me. Friend had a bug not long ago where grahm walked past his base and aggro’d all his stuff. He destroyed bits of his base and smashed Sofia to bits.
---
Thank you
---
Click carefully though otherwise you'll accidentally buy it.
---
Thank you :)
---
Only unfortunate because Bethesda screwed them up so horribly in the first place. It's a good thing that they are reworking them. The whole set up was laughably horrible. 80% of the perks were worthless, the system for leveling them was dumb. They said they wanted a system that encouraged players to try different builds, but the only way to level up your legendary cards was to trade in your regular cards,  thus eliminating your ability to switch builds. It's like they literally dont understand how their own game works.
---
Not to mention the stealth suit plans if you're going to side with the raiders
---
You shouldn't feel bad about that at all. Your action is good for all players. It's the people who complain but don't request refunds that should feel bad.
---
Well, for one the only reason the raiders aren't aggressive to you is because they're allied with Crater and you've built up enough rep with them to make them at least neutral. If you have no Crater rep, the raiders you chase down for this quest *are* aggressive; it's not because they're actually great guys who are just trying to get by.    
---
Also, if you walk around Crater for a bit, you'll hear them talk about this stuff. They'll comment that they aren't going out scavenging, it's too dangerous; they'll constantly mention how it's about time to go raid the settlers again because they're easy pickings, so it makes perfect sense that Ward wants you to go out there and show the raiders that the Settlers aren't just going to let them walk away with their stuff, no matter how valuable it is.    
---
You also seem to want to completely ignore that the *other* Raider quest has you go out and murder anyone that tries to leave Crater, and it's just fine if you kill any other raider that just happens to be out there doing the same job as you as well. Helps people flee, lol.
---
Alot of people are upset because it's nothing new and a week too early. If it was new content, even if people didn't want it, less people would be upset.
---
good read. youre right in saying they need to be completely separate and the double xp needs to be removed. as you stated, lots of balancing needs to occur before they can try to balance a pvp mode though. enticing players from pve into other modes is only going to make other modes worse.
---
Same problem - he just reset me last night.
---
Still that's not the way you should do it. You get treasury notes from the rep quests. But you only get those if you finish. Advance both sides to the point of no-return, then pick a side and do it and start earning treasury notes ASAP since that's the real grind.
---
The game ate my t60 and my engineers outfit so now I'm a insurrectionist lol
---
Well that’s up to you then. Which ever you see more value in.
---
Not to mention the fact that we can't VATS other players but the Tesla basically has auto aim...
---
So they’re completely reworking the system and perks? That’s good to hear
---
I forgot the Settlers could just pop on down to Walmart to buy new equipment that the Raiders stole from them...  
---
Also, Blood Eagles like to peel the skin from people while they're still alive and torture people by filling them with chems until they lose their minds. They are basically the MaMa Clan from Dredd.
---
Thank you for this link!
---
I always forget to equip goat legs when I'm off doing something stupid (jumping from the tallest point I can, usually) and at the last minute yell "goat legs" at the screen in hopes it works.
---
...it never does.
---
Where do I craft the waster armor (non PA)? Its Not in the armor bench, theres only an option for the under armor and a raider waster outfit...
---
No, is the short answer.
---
When you log off, workshops are once again un-owned. You can quickly reclaim them, and whatever you built stays up, if you get back within a short period, but you do not continue to own them during that time.
---
It would be AWESOME if we friends could
---
#all live in the same house
---
Im not American so i could not care less about 4th of July
---
Get Queen meat for the most rep from this quest.
---
Shelters?
---
still no patriot paint for t65 :(
---
I'm talking about the WASTELANDERS quests, not the dailies.
---
I think the helmet says it only protects you from airborne disease.  Never heard of a helmet protecting you from waterborne.  I think only PA, radiation suits do that.
---
I got inside one once and they're empty for now 🙁
---
Nah, the bodysuit protects you from waterborne diseases and the helmet protects you from Air/Lung Diseases you get from the Ash Heap.
---
Yeah, but next week should be update 20 so it'll be a blast of new AS content.
---
Don't know for sure, but that's what I think it sounds like. Not sure how you could get the kind of blowback they were getting and not rework the whole thing? But who knows.
---
Even if i switch to public? I would get bored on my own waiting for the workshops to extract stuff.
---
And we can build fortresses on top of mountains but not turn the oxygen back on
---
How much is the contemporary set?
---
Studio 58 store inside the Whitespring.
---
No one would leave the cozy vault lol. It'd be like covid
---
I submitted for a refund and they refunded me 750 atoms and let me keep everything from when it was in sale for like 2 hours
---
Yep, I should be around my name is Case_42. I'll add you now and keep an eye out for you.
---
It is a Bethesda after all
---
Thank you, I’ve been wanted to get this for so long
---
I usually don’t attack the raider but I did choose it once and got the same result, he never fought back or even turned hostile. Also I never knew they didn’t actually need the item, I just collected my reward.
---
Haha sounds about right, things easily trigger camps and cause chaos
---
No problem.  There is a lot of cool unique plans there.  Kinda pricey, but nice.
---
No Slocums joe vendor bot?
---
So they released some 4th of july stuff from last year and yet the rootin tootin outfit is still bugged since wastelanders
---
The best part about getting max rep with foundation is going up to ward where he asks you to help, you say you are busy, and he gets all pissy about it. 
---
I loathe raiders (diehard BOS player here) but I’ll take them over those chodes at foundation.
---
I’m on my way there now
---
I just want to buy the succulents, but I haven't seen them show up in the store since I started playing last free weekend...
---
Biggest problem with sirvival is losing meds on death. Why not just drop your whole fuckin inventory at that rate?
---
Yeah, and then the scorched plague would destroy the rest of the United States since nobody would be there to fight them off.
---
it was a rather surprise to realize that pacifist is characterwise and not accountwide... :-/
---
I find all items in the shop disappointing.
---
without turret, trying not to do any maintenance, my secondary account will have this camp.
---
this is trash.
---
He could be a sleeper Enclave agent for all we know.
---
i been mia waiting for update 20
---
any new info when it drops?
---
One of these weeks I'm gonna spend some atoms.  I just know it.
---
You have to remember a lot of people have only been playing since wastelanders / steak release.  
---
These people missed last year's event so not everyone has all the atom shop.
---
Hey I’m still waiting for the damn Gold Gala Dress they waved in our face and never released
---
I have a soft spot for him. He reminds me of people I've known IRL. 
---
My favorite line is when he's talking about how he wouldn't want to have the responsibility of having his own camp. What a leech, but I &lt;3 him!
---
Although...he's stopped giving me quests so I did have to temporarily replace him.
---
I didn't think of that... You have a really good point!
---
Moth man needs to be buffed, Behemoth needs to be buffed, Wendigo Colossus needs to be buffed and finally the Deathclaws need a serious buff.
---
When in doubt just look at the Atomic Shop catalog online. It includes every item ever listed and its price. Then put in a ticket. I am sure they will accomodate.
---
It’s def been around a couple times now
---
at some point it was the only way to keep my inventory straight lol
---
Do you know about how to get the “communist commander”  outfit  that was leaked
---
Thanks! Come back and visit once I've finished redecorating, I've still got like 30% of my budget stored &gt;_&gt;
---
As the previous poster stated you learn to craft combat helmets after scrapping one. Craft and scrap helmets to unlock the skins.
---
maybe just TO much stuff to do for your gameclient (rendering all that players, the mobs AND your camp actions) causing it to become unstable and crash...
---
Semantics*
---
Cannibal overall just needs a buff. Instead of forcing players to drop into the cannibal eat animation that takes forever let them harvest meat off corpses that grant special buffs.
---
Assassins Fast Firing Black Powder Blunderbuss, 15% Faster reload.
---
Hi, I’m a literal day one player, and I’m fine with not having to spend stone every week. We’ve all gotten a bunch of stuff over the past month and a half/two months. Considering the Fourth of July is coming up and that Fallout takes place in America, of course we’re going to get reused content. Do you know how many people would be complaining from the other side if they’re new players and don’t get Independence Day stuff? No matter what, somebody will find something to complain about.
---
That place is in legacy dupe denial.
---
where is the link to the datamine?
---
I just put up neon letters that say buy shit and it works
---
Last night i did my dailes and asked myself wtf am i even doing now? Ive got the ss armor ive got a couple great chad weapons and a few "magic damage" weaps, dropping nukes is easy, sbq is easy everything is easy and more importantly its just more of the SAME. Nothing but the grind really pulls me back and the scrip, bullion, cap limit doesnt help. There needs to be something more dynamic, more events, more random bullshiterry and more chaos. Open all the vaults for instanced exploration. Add faction wars. Add massive enemy hordes. Add a mothman leader and a legit mothman army (with an event and special loots/swag). I want more wtf moments in the game, id also like balance changes to make the game more difficult. I know the chads love their legendaries and its fun to 1 shot stuff every now and then but that shit is cheese dude, get rid of them or atleast balance them. Give us all a challenge.
---
Another reason why I use the plague walker mutation.
---
They already released it in the Atom shop a while back.  Pretty sure you had to buy the bundle to get it and wasn't available on it's own.  Could be wrong though.
---
Funny .... I was only trying to be informative
---
Definitely!
---
I can't even get any to scrap. Checked spawn locations I've heard about, just not having any luck.
---
I resent Bethesda for the big mess this game is but I am so glad I bought it. I made a few amazing friends, it's insane the contacts I have now due to playing. Great player base makes it worth it
---
Who knows, they added NW so maybe they'll experiment with other game types again to keep people playing.
---
Agree. Not sure why trolls are downvoting.
---
I'm sure he did! It would have been nice if it made him mutate further.
---
What platform are you on
---
Two different raider bundles, plus the free states and multiple paint color vending machines **But still no raider vending machine?** I just want a good machine to sell my chems why do they insist on keeping one of the few things I want to buy from me
---
Keep up the good work, maybe I’ll be happy about with the lineup next week
---
Hey, come on now. Not everybody on this sub is an ungrateful little....
---
DOUBLE BARREL SKIN PLEASE
---
No there’s another one with a new ushanka I could send a picture but it won’t let me
---
Just rubbish.  Their is some really neat stuff datamined in the files. 
---
The new wooden floor and walls set looks really nice, but they're refusing to release it yet.
---
Check back in once you finish all the quests and have max gear.  See if you still feel the same? Most of the complaints are bugs that were never fixed and a lack of   pve or pvp content.
---
And their duped to high heaven.  No reason they should be worth that much.  
---
BGS need to make the changes to those guns already like they said they would 1 year ago
---
Yeah, you wanna do both questlines all the way!
---
PC sadly
---
Ah.  Haven't seen that one.  Must be a future atom shop item.
---
lol, that checks out, it looked like the 4th of July...Completely worth it if that's what got me kicked
---
Granted
---
Idk I havent used the old settler guy but otherwise you get, annoying guitar constantly with hippy quotes, "my headaches mehgh", or cocky useless bar man. Raider punk isn't to bad.
---
How can I send a pic to you
---
Hey at least we’re getting a vending machine based on a donut chain.
---
Upload to imgur then post the link.
---
I have just completed this today (23rd June 2020) at Poseidon energy.restored all components including optional tasks and then restored power,this completed the Possum Electrician badge
---
Rumor is it will up be coming out next week
---
That sounds horrifically hilarious.
---
Please tell me you wear the lumberjack outfit and weild a chainsaw  😂
---
That’ll be great to load with a bunch of spoiled food
---
Exactly.  It’s stories like this that keep me sitting on a few decent legendaries that don’t match my build that I’d otherwise trade.  An item trading screen where both parties put items “on the table” and confirm the entire deal would put some real gems on the market hiding in peoples stashes. 
---
btw, sorry to hear you got scammed.
---
I have to say, I just had Wren bad-mouth me. I got the lag where dialogue didn't progress when turning in the communication quest,and when I backed out she was like " I guess vault dwellers have no manners after living in a hole in the ground. Get out of here I didn't want to talk to you anyways!" So yeah she bad-mouths you. Crater isn't innocent, they just say it to your face.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd much prefer a more straightforward auction house in ESO (too many hoops to jump through to sell items, I just vendor to NPCs because I just don't want to deal with the hassle) too but at least I've got some information to work with over there if I want to *buy* something, even if it isn't perfect.
---
In 76 I can't do anything but wander aimlessly and hope to god someone, somewhere has the item I want...and they're online when I am...and we happen to be on the same server...and they happen to be able to place their camp down.
---
Maybe I'm just unlucky.
---
I would actually use that
---
Thank you for posting, but, as someone who really hates the overtness of American patriotism, this is the worst birthday present ever.  Hahaha
---
Every time I see these posts, I updoot.
---
About a month ago I was going through my inventory, and I see the repair kits I've been getting from the scorch beast queen fights, I had 91 of them. When you get a higher level just join any SBQ fight you see, and you'll never want those 100% MTX kits.
---
This weekend, there built stripping out content And adding old bug in to make sure it comes out on time,
---
😂 Thanks
---
Not everyone has unbalanced OP builds, 4 max level ghouls at once are challenging when you can't one shot them.
---
Even as a pve only player and not interested in pvp - your suggestions made sense and I think those improvements could really make the pvp base happy again. If it’s done right.
---
Have my up - good post!
---
I like building camps in the game so I try to make them themed for each location. I understand your blight, but all you can do is either never move or make a floating base.
---
The glitch still works which is wild.
---
Obviously no.
---
np :)
---
Ooh yeah. Mm they are just so fucking juicy dude, the green goo gets me going ya know?
---
Same but with rice.
---
there is a guaranteed one in the Mire, down the hill from the old Purveyor building and inside of a shack. I could google it for it's exact locale but i'll leave it to you, fren \^\^
---
Huh, I guess I just never really noticed it. I just thought I was getting more xp for higher level enemies as I leveled and went to different zones.
---
If u don’t have any decent weapons now, u might be better off getting 2* first.   Then go for the 3*.
---
If I’m still playing after a month, I’ll look back and see how this game was definitely worth the $40 I spent on it.
---
No one should ever expect a game to be infinitely fun. I had a similar conversation with someone about this already. If you are level 50 or above, and you are still playing this game, think about how many hours you’ve put into this game. If you’ve spent 100+ hours on a $40 game, then I’s say it’s done its job.
---
I like raider punk. The pull my finger grandad is my least favourite.
---
Good thing it's being nerfed/fixed in update 20 so everytime you shoot in VATS it won't be a charged shot.
---
I’m super happy with my new place so in retrospect, it wasn’t a big deal. It was more of an inconvenience honestly
---
Raider punk is the least annoying of the allies in my opinion... close second is the old man. All the others are incredibly annoying though!
---
There was one with one of the red rocket sets
---
It irks me that they're doing Fourth of July stuff now instead of next week
---
HeHe, all good!
---
This. Turrets do nothing but fuck people’s games up (sound, lag, frames)
---
My character is level 43. He’s using a level 10 sledgehammer. He one shots everything that’s not a boss mob or huge thing. Your build must be absolute dog shit.
---
And yet you still have modders making improvements.
---
I was gonna upvote, until i saw your mf clone build.
---
Next week.
---
Bundle only. Right now anyway
---
Of course not everyone but look at the majority I've been playing for 2 months and not once have I checked the Reddit where people are happy about the atom shop. Btw I'm one of the ones that got screwed on the Red rocket bundle with the door and I was pissed but I understand it was a new item and coding errors are easy especially when there's already items with similiar coding aka the Red rocket garage door. See I understand stuff happens put in ticket bam atoms back it's that easy( took time but it happened). Instead of people doing that the whine and chirp. everyone just belittles Bethesda and doesn't understanding how hard coding actually is and how easy it is to copy paste atom shop stuff that have already been in there and are in the coding for the game then put new things in and have to code it and how it interacts and works with everything. perfect example mothman backpack it works but clips through stuff where other backpacks don't because how it interacts with what your wearing. Seriously people just have to give them a break and realize there trying and have improved a lot. Look at faschnant the delay sucked but because of that they extended it for longer and with the legendary drops, community, treasure notes it was an amazing event. As well the legendary perk system they heard how hated they were and are changing them. Personally they were horrible 100% agree but they are changing them. It just takes patience. "Rome wasn't built in a day"
---
Oh yeah lol Been so long since I started that I forgot about it. lol
---
Word that Exciting news
---
My runs perfect. Muahahahah
---
I want it to be like rust. If you die someone can take all your stuff. Maybe you could make equipped legendaries protected but everything else should be at risk. It would make the game 100% more exciting because there is no Boring afk running from one point to another. Every mission has the chance to cost you everything or if you surprise someone give you a bunch.
---
What armor? 
---
Isn't the outfit what comes in the package deal?
---
Bummer.  Has it been available separately in the past do you know?  Don't mind waiting if that's the case since nothing else in the bundle interests me.
---
Prob made a few others crash too
---
NadeWilson I dunno how you understood what I was talking lmao, my English is still bad but hey it's something already.
---
I'm pretty sure it was a while back but I may be mixing it up with one of the other skins 
---
I wouldn't hold your breath for it to pop up separately anytime soon though
---
Wtf you need so much dmg for bud? I legit already 1-2 shot everything with a shit build.
---
Is there anything additional you can do for the foundation rep. I’ve allied with raiders but so close with foundation. I do the ward quest and the photo op but dunno if there’s anything else?
---
You might be right, it might have been closer to 7x7.  Was also two stories up.
---
Try rotating the foundations helped me when my double sided contemporary walls were clipping into each other.
---
Seems like either certain foundations, wall types, or some combination of the 2 dont perfectly align in all directions.
---
That only means charging in vats,he's still gona kill her in 6 shots.
---
Add the RR garage door skin to the list.  Completely useless at the moment.
---
You will learn the initial combat helmet plan by scrapping a helmet. However, you will not learn the variants by scrapping crafted helmets. You have a chance to learn a helmet variant by scrapping combat armor limbs.
---
Your  country doesn't have a birthday/independence day/whatever?
---
I find that hard to believe 
---
And not all Americans are rootin tootin flag worshiping "patriots" 
---
That's this thing called a stereotype. Your country has them too
---
Usually comes 2 or 3 days after the renewal
---
Yeah if we could hold 300k people would start charging 300k for shit items. I'm good bro..
---
I was instantly mind-boggled by the choice of rewards when they first brought out survival.  It was immediately abundantly clear that it would be filled with PVE'ers who would bail as soon as they got the reward, and nobody would benefit except the griefers who get an easy target for as long as it takes for the PVE'ers to get what they want.
---
Why they weren't all PVP-focused legendaries, with effects that are near-useless in PVP like Assassins, was beyond me.  The only conclusion (other than overwhelming incompetence) is that they *wanted* noobs in PVP, being so massively tone-deaf that they thought they could convert us into PVP advocates.
---
Oh ok thx
---
Sometimes takes a day or two
---
I disagree. The difference in value of _____/25  vs _____/25/25 is pretty huge. Buy a 1 star version of the weapon you want to use and then roll for 3*'s
---
I’d love this too but with rumors circulating about stash stealing due to people with large budgets and people doing budgets exploits, I feel like that needs corrected first or it’ll only get worse.
---
I’m going to have to start the strategy of grabbing all the pylons myself. I’m sure it might take me a few times to get the hang of it.
---
Do you use Born Survivor, Auto-Stim armor, Power Armor Medic Pump, or some other strategy to take the damage? Nuka Quantum?
---
Ah, cool.  Appreciate it.
---
Had it happen to my low level during the Messenger. After that, I was always extremely cautious at events. 
---
Remember someone saying “Why are you using a low level here” and I just laughed and said I wanted to challenge myself. 
---
Most dudes were only killing at the end for survival score so that they could be revealed on the map.
---
Another idea: on pve servers allow people to opt-in to pvp with another person. They’d get a notification that “XXXXX wishes to engage in PVP with you!” And then you can either accept or decline. 
---
If you accept, you’re both passive until one attacks the other, so until you attack the other their camp defenses won’t attack you either. But when you attack the other, you immediately start pvp with no reduced damage on the first shot. Either player can drop out of the pvp agreement at any time.
---
Bugs get fixed opinions don't. If you don't stay playing a game for long or due to lack of "QoL" then you never really fell in love with it in the first place.
---
Liberty prime and two unique raider power armors! If only we had a way to display power armor it would make these collectible...
---
Duping makes godrolls easier to acquire . I really don’t understand this argument . If someone duped a bunch of fixers , they can still only use 1
---
&gt;How the fuck is killing 3 or 4 ghouls that are next to a candy bucket even remotely challenging?
---
Are you under the impression that events in FO76 are generally challenging?
---
If you're on PS4 I can make you one.
---
They probably either forgot about those or keep those items ready until they mess up again and need to appease the community with free items
---
You are not wrong.
---
**WHERE MY GARAGE and SINFIRMITAS’s GOLD GALA DRESS**
---
It would be cool if there was some landmarks that went **red** sometimes, and it became a free for all zone free of any slap damage. 
---
I know people would hate it but it you know where the action would happen and if it's someplace you want to go you can always serverhop.
---
The grind for this outfit is a complete joke... But I want it really badly, so I'mma do it... but I'mma be grumpy the whole damn time.
---
Both Liberty Prime Skins work with T-65 as well as Black Rider.  Dunno about others, those are just the ones I have.
---
No, of course not. The guy I responded to evidently is. His build is clearly total dogshit if he can’t kill a few ghouls. My level 43 character can do that event without dying with a level 10 sledgehammer.
---
plasma caster is one of if not the best every day weapon in the game for a heavy build...
---
Thanks I'll look into it
---
As far I as understand, yes. Better to claim it (almost immediately defend it) and then do other things in the private world while it works in the background.
---
Gear doesn’t even matter that much . Perks and consumables is what separates the wolves from the sheep
---
Definitely this. They even changed it with Wastelanders. Used to be a bit brighter white. Now it's less bright but still white. Also the "vault tec" white wall lights inside interior like vaults etc look soooooo damn good. Yet in our camp they look like absolute TRASH an give off a complete different lighting.
---
Well nothing on the ptr. And I suspect they were too buisy making stuff for the score system
---
Well doesn’t look like I’m hopping on this week. Check you again next week
---
Seperate PVP and PVE servers?
---
Shut up and take my upvote!!
---
I wouldn't be surprised by either. It's also probably the same for various locked off locations like at the whitesprings.
---
I disagree.
---
The settler ally you meet in foundation. The famous writer. He's the worst.
---
Nothing but "pull my finger. Ha ha!"
---
Deleted that fucker from my camp real quick.
---
If you don’t want pvp why are you doing pvp activities ? And why do you care so much about dropping some junk?
---
Hopefully not you with these trash bundles
---
Rumour?
---
Awesome thanks gonna try that later
---
Comments on this here post...
---
I just want a small portable vendor tent that can be placed close to other vendor tents. ws golf course would probably always have a little pop up market on it! 😁
---
Yea I remember F4 having TERRIBLE lighting for the vault tec dlc. Something clearly different with camp lights vs dev lights
---
I was also super skeptical, I waited till after wastelanders to come out to buy the game. I work two jobs so I get to play maybe 5 hours a week tops, sometimes just turn on the game for 40min before I head to work. I love everything about the game to be honest, it’s probably because I don’t get to play so much and burn through all the quests. Only problem with it is that it makes my chances of getting unique items almost impossible.
---
If you are still claiming it then your both red. No slap damage. If you have fully claimed it then you both have to shoot each other to start PvP.
---
Most things are no real hassle to farm so it would have to be something really worthwhile for PVP to happen any notable amount more often at workshops.  Like stable flux or scrip or even caps or something, and there's no way Bethesda would go for that.
---
That's a whole lotta meh right there.
---
&gt;no vertibird power armor
---
why even live
---
Launching nukes at camps especially those that have no significant locational value.
---
Always wanted to get my hands on an explosive Gatling laser. For research of course!
---
Unless you have pvp enabled you do no damage outside of pvp events. Slap damage was removed due to a bug last I knew
---
This is not comprehensive and only scratches the surface. Adding a separate pvp mode is not the best choice.
---
- Pacifist mode is unfinished. It doesn't protect the player from pvp and only cripples them if they end up in pvp (monster mash, wotkshops). Setting needs to be completed and set to ON by default. Claiming Workshops, placing punjis, joining monster mash and H/H should be blocked if you are pacifist.
---
- Energy weapons can goo/ash pile players on death. This causes them to respawn in god mode. You can stack buffs infinitely and get 10k xp per scorched kill right now. Bloody Mess can do this as well.
---
- Non-physical explosions ignore explosion resist and ER/RR/FR. Test this with gamma guns, plasma grenades etc if you don't have a legacy.
---
- Legacy explosive effect needs to be replaced with another effect using condition clauses on the Explosive legendary effect OMOD. This will not brick existing weapons.
---
- Hacked weapons turn PC pvp into the wild west. If you aren't going to remove these, install flags to prevent damage if the equipped weapon has impossible keyword combinations.
---
- PVP handshake should not kick in immediately. Right now, Player 2 gets first blood every time. There should be a 10-15s timer.
---
- joining team pvp should be easier, instead of the new patch making a 4v4 involve 16 handshakes.
---
- public teams should include a PVP team option. Public PVP teams are all flagged for pvp with each other by default.
---
- nothing should be lost on death. Caps gained from kills don't need to come out of someone's pocket. This is the whole reason smoothbrains equate pvp with griefing - they lose more than the duel.
---
- camp objects destroyed by players need to passively regenerate over time or upon server hop.
---
- all locations have 1 fast travel target point, which also servers as the respawn point. This encourages spawn camping and limits potential. Adding more respawn points will keep people on their toes.
---
- Stealth boys need to be removed from the game, or break upon moving (Like chameleon).
---
- food healing can be abused to get over 1000 HP/SEC
---
- The -50% player VATS accuracy magazine should be applied as default to every vats shot in pvp.
---
- pvp damage needs to work separately from pve damage. Especially if One Wasteland isn't bringing the value overhauls that every single piece of gear and aid in this game desperately needs.
---
- pvp needs to be made more accessible. The reason casuals don't play pvp is because they either don't have the stash space to store that gear or they haven't dumped 1000 hours in to have the rng success to roll that gear. If the bar to entry remains so high, the player count will remain low.
---
Well-said!  Completely agree
---
VERY much appreciate the testing.
---
Just go look at ESO, anything that ESO has, FO76 needs. Yet, FO76 doesn't even scratch the surface of actual content. The game is stale, and it seems Bethesda doesn't care too much, at least in my opinion.
---
Downvote. That philosophy is neutering this games lifespan
---
Need some communist flags for 4th of July. Or at least being able to burn the US one. NOT ASKING FOR MUCH
---
Brb going to buy pitchforks!
---
They're quest items. The cant be traded or sold.
---
God i wish the Alien blaster was better. That paint job looks amazing.
---
What about all those crickets at that cave town in the mire? Bout 15 in there and each give 3-5 acid.
---
Play on Xbox. Griefers are abundant in every server. They’ve evolved to work in teams now.
---
That's another great way to do it, but right now that is hard to pull off. They still need to finish the pve areas. They'll half ass both if they need to add a new region
---
Boxes of copier paper
---
I deliberately left it off on my alt. She’s level 30 and no pvp Greifing yet Apart from somone punching me to get her attention and dropping a 10 mm and ammo, aid items and uniradiated salsbury steaks and water. Any more I think it’s just random luck who shows up.
---
The main servers will die in a few years from lack of players once TES6/Starfield scoop up the pve crowd
---
Who asked for legendary perks!? Give us passive perk slots. Simple concept: Unlocked at level 100, 1 slot unlocked every 10 levels for max of 10 and only certain cards can be used in slots. Cards such as Lockpick, hacker, super duper etc. Its just a PITA to have to swap them out.
---
That's a good place for Acid too, hit both! Bring a Bloatfly Syringer. ;)
---
Pull my finger, Get a prize.
---
Well said. Thank you.
---
As long as he doesn't start carrying on about his nightmares every 15 seconds he can stay
---
I'm from the US, but I live on the Canadian border.  Canadian patriotism is pretty soft and sweet, acknowledging of the past. And there are ways it is everywhere, but it's like putting a little maple leaf on stuff.
---
In the US we have massive flags, stars and stripes on everhthing, in a lot of ways patriotism frequently corralates to conservativism, (which like  I don't hate conservatives, but growing up as a disabled, trans child, I learned to be wary) we launch fireworks for days traumatizing veterans, and our national anthem is literally about Black Americans dying.  I also was born in 1994, so I'm part of that sub-generation who was learning to understand what nationalism was durring the era of it being painfully obvious that the Bush administration was purposely cultivating a connection between nationalism, patriotism, and the war in Iraq (which my best friend's mom was an officer on a tank base in Kuait, and I loved her, I don't hate veterans, I just believed then and still believed that the war was unjust.)  So ever since then American patriotism just has this aftertaste I can't shake, like how when you get old enough, the smell of alcohol just makes you think of your past hangovers and makes you feel a little nauseous. 
---
 I don't hate people who are patriotic.  I'm super patriotic about my home state, so I get it.  It's just for me, it's sorta been sullied by everything else it has been manipulated to represent instead.
---
Tbh it's mostly pve players who group up or exploit against other pve players.
---
A pvp build doesn't need help against a 4 man pve squad
---
Oh, good. I’m still trying to get the last mod for those. Take some of my caps, buy the bulk set!
---
Use true long barrels for added accuracy. Aligned is for vats which is useless on most heavy guns.
---
DIBS!
---
Nah [Frank](http://imgur.com/gallery/oukn3li) has never been a legendary, he's usually an ancient or glowing Behemoth
---
In some cases that’s true.  For certain play styles and builds, the third effect can be extremely valuable.  25% less vats cost on a rifle or 15% faster reload on a heavy gun are very nice to have.
---
I have PC steam sub and it takes 1 or 2 days. It is somewhere stated. I just got surprised for the first time got the billing SMS but no atom points.
---
Can I just get the Free States Survivalist outfit? That’s all I want...
---
Eventually, I suppose.
---
I guess we're celebrating independence day earlier?
---
They’ve never been able to be traded/sold
---
Idk why they didn’t do that from the start. PvE and PvP (even add RP) servers have been a staple of MMO’s.
---
no worries at all, it is guaranteed (if i hven't mentioned it already) if you use PSN for 76 add me on: Mclovin_It616 and if not, oh well :D
---
I mean, I want to be mad, but you make a really good point here.
---
If pvp was competent and accssible, then more players would be looking to play pvp.
---
The problem is that you need to be sitting on great gear and have planned out a decent build before you can even begin to participate.
---
Thanks dude, I'll try that out :)
---
He didn’t say in his comment if he is an American or not. So attacking this country that you don’t know yet, is not the smartest move.
---
But yes, as an outsider Americans flag worship is a bit ridiculous. I don’t care if you call it a stereotype or whatever, it is ridiculous.
---
For example when athletes don’t stand up during the the anthem? And the half of the country/internet is reporting about it.
---
I see what you are saying, but, if you think about it guns should be king. Unless you a the best at sneaking up on someone, someone with a gun will have the range to kill you. I mean irl you never bring a knife to a gun fight....
---
Wow. There is a lot of misconception and misinformation in there that I don't even want to touch it. And I'm not at all patriotic. 
---
Though I do have to ask, where did you learn that the National Anthem is about black people dying? I have not ever heard that incredibly "inaccurate" interpretation before- and I have heard a pretty long list of just strait up crazy shit.
---
"A shrubbery?!"
---
How is that possible? (Both are first affix) Can you upload it somewhere to check?
---
These exploits are proof positive that the game cant really handle a sizable budget increase.
---
No sorry I meant one was junkies, one was furious. Sorry about that confusion
---
The brown acid?
---
Basically with power armor and other world spawns, every time a new player loads into a cell there is a chance that the power armor will spawn in. Then that player can't trigger it to respawn until they leave the area for 10 minutes and go back. In highly trafficked areas you will often see a power armor frame because lots of players spawn in and increase the number of them and they don't often take them. So you can pick up a power armor that someone else spawned in. On a private world it's only you and your friends which means less chances for world spawns. Tldr, if you want power armor hop into public cause it won't show up often on a private world.
---
My thoughts as well when I saw this. Really pleased that Bethesda would finally acknowledge something Obsidian added to the Fallout universe. At least I don't remember seeing too many instances of this.
---
I don't know about below. But above yes. You can't assign more perk cards but if you have unyielding armour in all 5 slots and low health you definitely get the effects of way above 15 points in things like strength and agility.
---
Very good question ill be watching to see some replys on this one
---
+1000 hours in and I still enjoy it daily.
---
This wood shop would shop wood if the wood shop could shop wood! 😏
---
No! Don't touch the brown acid!!
---
If you need it for personal use, go 2 star (assuming your current weapon is crap). If you're looking to make money, go for 3.
---
And you were right!

10 mil and pipe weapons are fine

Ah, the regular "atom shop disappointing" thread....
---
If I find a raider in the wild it all depends on my rep with them. But if I find a settler it doesn't matter, they are gona bitch and complain,make snide comments about picking up a hammer, and I'm gona get sick of them and just off them anyway.
---
I agree it's has made it easier, I certainly jacked my prices way way up after the holiday g*fs got duplicated. I have been enjoying hitting 30k caps twice day. I slowing chipping away at them (large bags of plans and alcohol left on my vendor floor) I love giving out all there plans to newbies in hopes of getting people to stop selling mounted head plans. I'm positive I'm just a drop in bucket but I try.
---
 I do miss the challenge of getting some goodies now. I reminds me of spotting Jedis before they became easily accessible in Galaxies.
---
The event's name is Encryptid btw. In case you need to refer to it again later.
---
Did you complete the Mayor for a Day quest-line in Watoga?
---
Good point I should start selling my tokens now thanks!
---
They each have different power armor skins and a different backpack skin. The scabber bundle has an outfit with tires on the shoulders and a mask and the waster bundle has an underarmor and Porter Gage's outfit and eyepatch from Nuka World. They also have a couple other things like icons and flags, they should list which ones have which.
---
What a jarringly beautiful way to expound the nature of those with "friction burn from cheeto dust". Almost Shakespearean of you.
---
Dump any efforts for PvP + Adventure Mode. It's that simple. Survival Mode was just an experimental sandbox to study closer the behaviors of the PvP player base within a Fallout online universe particularly  to see if there is any 'profit viability' that is, take a measure of any 'overwhelming enthusiasm for the mode to attract and hold a healthy ancillary *competitive* player base that Bethesda can pitch MTX upon. It's just not there. Further, it just pissed off the PvE player base of those who have no interest in mixing or participating with PvP in Appalachia.
---
The result of the PvP experiment? Cut your losses. Why is this a smart move for Bethesda? For many reasons the most obvious is the extra overhead that is required to maintain Survival mode to cater to a small niche of the player base (competitive players)  AND to top it off,  there's no real $$$ in Survival mode when ***compared***  to what can be derived out of the the PvE player base. The resources (staff/time/money/maintenance/development) otherwise allocated towards maintaining PvP Adventure mode is best used towards bolstering the cash cow and catering to PvE players.
---
While breaking down how to righteously segregate PvE and PvP players across dedicated server worlds is curious, it will always come down to money. That's the calculation to use. The question was never *"How do we do Survival mode?"* but "*Why do Survival Mode?"* It was such in pain in the ass mode filled with a bright future of player exploitation and constant bug squashing to stay ahead of the cheating that personally, I'd run the other direction too if I were Bethesda.
---
The cost benefit for supporting Survival mode notably at *any* expense that degrades the PvE player experience is not only too costly but very risky in every sense of the word at this point in Fallout 76's "evolutionary development".
---
Expect Survival mode to be DOA.

“First you must find... another shrubbery! Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here, beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get a two layer effect with a little path running down the middle. ("A path! A path!") Then, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring!”

Complete the Mayor for a Day quest and they are no longer hostile.

Check latest datamined pics.
---
Yeah there is a couple of things in the files that I desperately want, namely the weapon skins based on guns from past games.  To be specific, the R91 AR skin, the Screaming Eagle skin, and default Chinese AR skin.
---
And if they decide to port over the Merc outfits that were added to Fallout 4 in the Capital Wasteland Mercenaries pack I would be extremely grateful.  Those cosmetics are literally all I wish for.
---
That might be gauss shotgun only. I tried a bloodied gauss pistol and it did 300 instead 900 (base DMG) in vats on a lvl 48 ghoul.
---
I really hope they do not nerf the shotgun (bugfix OK) It suppose to be endgame weapon for upcoming hard challenges.
---
If they really want to fix weapon I suggest to check magic heavy, shogun and legacy weapons. They literally melts any target in 5 seconds.
---
Anyone else met with [this](https://imgur.com/a/TAMuXN9) after clicking the link?
---
Your right I just looked at them in game and I almost puked guess I will be waiting forever to buy something from the atomic shop
---
What I've learned works best is to clear whitesprings before going to launch the nuke. If you dont, run through whitesprings like you are clearing it and kill any ghoul you see. Then reload into the server and should be fine.
---
Yeah exactly. As much shit as we give Bethesda (rightfully so in many cases) I think they make the right call by not increasing it for the time being.
---
That's kinda what I wanted from the beginning or I guess something similar at least. For me I want every encounter to not be death. I would encourage players not to kill each other if possible, but make it so you have to cautious. My concern is that we'll get a mode which is just constantly get murdered by players anytime you encounter them and another which is strictly friendly. That's kinda boring.
---
The negative stats will come into play with things like shopping, dialogue choices, and crafting(condition).
---
The positives are just that. Also when looking to raise a star with unyielding armor perk get bloodied and wait a second before using charisma or luck I found sometimes the game takes a second to register the change on stat when applying things like charisma luck and strength. Ex: the game will register you as over encumbered when in fact you shouldn’t be due to str gain via unyielding armor stat or other perks.
---
Yup, I am one of them. Although to be honest, I think the only thing I will be getting is the American Flag pole. Although Liberty prime armor looks tempting.
---
Where?
---
Yay! Down voted for telling people to Google the problem instead of whining on the forum.
---
2 minutes for a search can save a lot of headache and missed gold bullion.
---
It's almost like you people don't want to find a solution.
---
I've been able to push my build to 18 Per from armor alone and sometimes 20+ with Chems.
---
Why yall so lazy as fuck mate 
---

---
How the hell do you have so many atoms?
---
Exactly. Everything on release indicates this was the intended design. They just never finished shit.
---
Such a simple, staright-forward, and smart solution. Your suggestions should be taken into consideration.
---
Nice. Reflex sight also reduces AP cost if you didn't already know
---
Cool. Do we know for sure though that anything over 15 has an effect on passives? For example, does 20 str give more carry weight than 15?
---
Problem I had with the going back and forth - my main character has a nice base, in a prominant location, with powered full vendors. Id care very much if someone trashed it.
---
Now I dont want to bring that camp into survival because its the complete opposite of whats needed. But at the same time I dont want to rip my main base down, and nor do I want to start a new character.
---
So the end result was simply that I didnt play survival
---
Yea someone else replied suggesting factions, at least then you'd be on a team. Everyone who joins the server chooses a team (can't be unbalanced numbers tho) and then your allies would have names visible. Everyone else would probably just be hostile but at least you'd have a lore excuse of hating the other factions
---
&gt;It’s like if all the battleships carrying troops to Europe in WW2 sank themselves after the voyage [sic] over.
---
It’s literally nothing like that but go off I guess.
---
Thanks, I've been doing the opposite thinking killing them first with a whitespring run would use up all the ghouls 😃I'll give your way a try. Cheers!
---
I hate PVP in this game because it's janky as SHIT. I have pvp'd in so many other games and always at least HELD MY OWN. This game, I'm like, wtf, how do I even ... 
---
so yeah I hide in the bushes during a NW match. Because I can't hit shit no matter how hard I try
---
Weapons with "Magical" Modifiers doing more damage than they should.
---
I had a wild time using Speed Demon, Marathoner and Action Boy to entice players to chase me all over the map.
---
Sometimes I'd lead them into a trap, sometimes I just kept running.
---
I've had maxed out specials in the high 30s from unyielding armor, some mutations, and random other buffs. I think my agility was like 38 at one point. I could sprint for days.
---
Oh no worries. I just got a conversation a few times for such claims :D
---
Because no one can be a vault tec representative anymore
---
I'll be by this evening! Maybe. How do I link up with people again 😂😂😖😭
---
"Magic" weapons. The limb damage bug on very fast fire rate weapons.
---
Ah np. I just edited the original comment
---
For me, the key here is to claim a ton of workshops at once in a private world just for the XP, plans, and fast travel points. Usually the whole west side of the map. Skip the defend events but do the reclaim events instead. I usually don't even build on them. Used to build at hemlock holes for the acid but beehives during fasnacht gave me a lifetime supply of that. Occasionally I'll use a session to farm fusion cores this way too.
---
If you do want to build at the workshops, blueprint yourself a 1x1 elevated structure with a fusion generator, fast travel mat, any crafting station, and stash boxes so you can slap it down quickly and move on. No wires in your blueprint, it won't like to place that.
---
And what everyone else said for sure. Throw that tent down often and keep scrapping stuff and soon you'll have thousands of everything. I really underestimated how much scrap I'd end up collecting with 1st because I never had trouble managing the 800 limit.
---
Makes sense but Thing is I did that a long time ago and nothing changed. I guess that was bugged and kicked in post Wastelanders.
---
I'm not saying this is for everyone, but it may help for those of us that can't buy gold every Sunday. This is what I've found by reading solutions from people a lot smarter than me. 
---
If it works, yay. If not... ok, cool.
---
Ahhhhh..... that sucks.  Got the event rewards but no chance of  drop.   How do you get these "magical" modifiers?   Asking for a friend.
---
But we ***ARE*** Vault-Tec!
---
I checked your recent market listings. You have to understand, when you're making the trade post you are *going* to get low-balled. No one wants to come out even unless you have exactly what they want. Most of the people replying to you were either super low-tier traders, or people trying to get your gun for cheap to flip later. That's the nature of the beast. I don't think there's anything that can be done to correct the market, since this behavior is dictated by supply and demand.
---
yes
---
Exactly. The gear and game knowledge floor for pvp is really high. So many pve players fail to recognize that half the perk card descriptions are misleading or flat out wrong.
---
Tried to find it. Sorry :(
---
Thaks anyway
---
Yesss, I would kill for a dungeon finder in 76. Also world bosses.
---
Gave me synaesthesia. I can smell garden centre looking at that.
---
Explain please.
---
As a PvPer I can appreciate the post but Beth obviously could give 2 shits about us. Instead they cater to the crying food builds who would rather boil water + do the countless mindless quests/ events. I mean how many f’ing queens can u do to get some garbage legendary.  It’s especially true of the higher levels who freak out when u pop them at a workshop. At least a lot 50-100 will fight back while a level 300 sends hate mail or cries in area. That’s the exact reason my teammates + I go after every1. “If u can’t stand the fire get the f@ck out of the kitchen”. Keep on killing foodies in the wasteland
---
Oh no, I got their explination of why they think America is soooooo terrible. 
---
And I have to say, of all the hundreds of people I know, I can't think of a single one of them that acts like your stereotype. Of course they exist, but in a country of 330 million people, saying that it is half of them is strait up close minded biased. 
---
Where are you from? I bet wherever it is that I can come up with a few bigoted stereotypes that I have picked up from film and videogame cliches. Doesn't mean I would for a second believe that they are true for that society as a whole
---
And you're example is terrible. Colin Kaepernick may have been blacklisted but he win a settlement lawsuit for wrongful termination (basically)- evidence that society (as in laws and such) supported him. 
---
Besides, if you think the vocal minority of fans representing a small portion of the assholes in relatively small portion of people that even follow the sport represent an entire country than I don't know what to tell you. Maybe you should trust media a little bit less
---
Same. Doesn't look like it's gonna be any better next week either with all those "13 days left" items taking up space...
---
I'M REPORTING THIS!! *runs away from the vault*
---
Assultrons 1 shot me eventhough I have a full set of buttress ss armou
---
That's not bethesda though. That's a completely separate game developer with actual MMO devs behind it.
---
Did not know that, I dont think I actually own any of the skins, only a bunch of different paints and none of the paints work.  Made me assume that the skins would be in the same boat.  Thanks for the heads up.
---
That would be cool!
---
Just relisten to the Overseer's tape and read her terminal before you leave the vault. It explains everything.
---
I'm a PvE player but had hopes for Survival mode since I don't mind PvP- when I'm agreeing to it. It's the same reason why I despise the Dark Zone in the Division. But love the PvP game modes.
---
But Survival mode not having completely new characters made zero sense.
---
So I think Vital Equipment is bugged for me because everyday I enter Foundation I have the option to turn in the missing equipment without being sent to do it. I've never have to go get it after the first one I did. I noticed that I have a Portable Power Pack in my Misc inventory that I believe I picked up off the ground somewhere prior to finding Foundation. Every time I turn in the quest, that stays in my inventory.
---
Could just be well geared people too. Have killed the queen in under a minute many times without the use of the "magic" weapons.
---
I just got a Junkies FFR gauss shotgun yesterday after finally gaining top rep. Happened on my 9th roll I believe. It’s great but gonna keep trying till I get a bloodied as that’s my build.
---
Workshops are supposed to be pvp zones.
---
The enemies are cannon fodder, you Don't need to defend shit.
---
The resources you gain are so low that it should be obvious that you're not meant to farm them anymore.
---
It's just for pvp right now
---
Yeah that gets pretty annoying too. They constantly are getting on my guitar but they pick it up, play for less than 4 seconds and then get up and start talking again.
---
I like the settler wanderer. She's chill and radiates positive vibes.
---
Were you playing nuclear winter? If you're playing it around the reset time (11 EST), or log into Nuclear Winter before Adventure Mode, you will likely incur this bug.
---
im ok with it. tbh, i like seeing people in full PA running like headless chickens when they get aware of this facelaser wearing piece of junk.   
---
also, after like dozens of deaths to it, im a headless chicken too.
---
No, I never got on to play NW last night or even this morning. I haven't been on NW for 2 weeks now...
---
I would think they would need to make a PvP only mode, that disables legendary effects. They make it too hard to balance. And balancing the legendary effects based on PvP would end up ruining the PvE side for a majority of players. 
---
In the very early stages of 76 when legendaries were pretty rare to see. PvP fights could actually be a proper fight. Wouldn't have instant one shots but also wouldn't have such difficulty killing someone that it would take days to shoot them to kill them.
---
No. The pvp players want to fight pvp players.
---
The pve player who just got his first Ass/Sent piece is the one ambushing pve players
---
Has to do with playing NW during the reset or last playing NW before the reset and not logging into adventure mode. Has existed since they introduced NW.
---
When Morgan town gets nuked all those level 3 ghouls you talked about turn it to fully fledged high level glowing ones
---
Don't stand in front of them.
---
Having joined PvP and PvE modes especially that are not balanced separately NEVER. EVER. EVER. WORKS. Trying to do both LITERALLY kills your PvP. It's the single reason why games like Destiny 2 and The Division have such awful PvP while having amazing gameplay that SHOULD make it good. It's such a stupid waste.
---
Except I did not play NW any time yesterday or this morning so...
---
This post is very interesting and so are all the comments.
---
I'm a part time 76 player, for me personally it's never 100% gripped me, but it's fun to play every now and then!
---
However this post is lacking something, okay perhaps lacking isn't the right word to use. But I can't think of a better one!
---
You talk about separating PvE and PvP I've never had much experience with PvP so I'll just say, sure go for it. But it does leave me with one rather important question.
---
What's the point of PvP? If I beat you in a fight, what do I gain? What's my reward?
---
I ask this, because I'm a full time sea of thieves player, and I love the combat in that game, despite how borked it is at times (look at you one blunder from across my ship) one of the main reasons I love it, is that when you get in to a fight, you get the satisfaction of the win and most times you tend to get a bit of loot!
---
But from what I understand about 76, I only drop my junk when you kill me? If that's the case. What's to stop me putting all my junk in my stash chest and going out and fighting? I don't lose anything if I lose. So there's no risk.
---
IF my assumptions and very limited knowledge is correct, then in my opinion the issue with PvP among other things, is there is no point to it. You don't really get anything and most will just jump on PvP servers when an empty inventory
---
Hmmm.  I killed one with just a few hits last night.  I really don’t want them to nerf yet another enemy,  games already easy.  I’m not even running anything close to BIS. 
---
Are you running a bloodied build or something?
---
You can totally burn the flag by pointing a flamethrower trap at it 
---
Go ahead. It's your constitutional right
---
stories like these make the game, well done!
---
Enjoy it while it last! The story is very short and wastelanders is even shorter!
---
will it set it on fire though? but fair enough, it's close enough!
---
😭 if we could just trade! I rolled a JFFR after 8 tries
---
Your special cannot fall below 1 in your stats. But, if you're at -3, you need to get +3 and beyond for that special to show the increase. For example, if you're at -3 strength, it will show 1 in the pipboy. Drinking a beer will not raise it past 1, because the game still considers you at -2. Hope that makes sense.
---
Hopefully. Even though I have one I'd rather they got fixed as people wrecking the queen in seconds is a bit of a joyless experience.
---
I actually like the looks of my combo of t51 with t65 limbs so I'm a little torn on what to ultimately do.   I just like the classic fallout appearance of the t51b.  At the very least those 4 limbs fixed the t51 to give it decent rad resist finally.
---
Hunter hunted has 0 rewards to entice players to participate
---
Yep. Things die before they can get off enough hits to kill me even when I engage multiple enemies at once. 
---
My Primed BFFR Fixer with vats reducing weapon mods, nerd rage, bloody mess, adrenal reaction,
---
I used to be terrified of them, but I finally got some chinese stealth armor and gear that takes them down in about 6 shots, and it seems if I stay in close they don't use their laser much.  Still sucks getting one shotted out of nowhere but I'm more ok with it now I guess.
---
You don't need shit. Just crouch
---
I already have all of this stuff from last year lol
---
No one knows what the patches do untill they drop, this includes bethesda employees, so untill then its all rumors.
---
Maybe not.  Appreciate the evaluation. And think you are correct.  I am expecting even trades like I would do, but not everyone's like me.  And are looking to profit or benefit from the trade.  Its TBE like you said.
---
I got a 3* one of those from a queen and nade a shrine for it.
---
Seriously you have a BFFR lmg and you are wondering what to use?????
---
She seems to be so considering how many times people looking for her have to server hop and how some people have the mighty nuke god luck of not looking for her and finding her randomly first try.
---
Edit: that and almost none of the ally lists make tail nor hair of her existence.
---
Good bloodied unarmed builds kills queen in seconds,i am an unarmed build 😁
---
😭I rolled a junkies FFR on my 8-9th try. I’m a bloodied.
---
When I first started playing I waited till lvl 85 to kill my first scorchbeast queen. I loaded up over 5k ammo, stimpaks and enough chems to last an entire hospital a lifetime and when I showed up there were lvl 15 and 20s running around with their pipe pistol doing end game content shooting at the queen.  Also kevduit on YouTube dropped a nuke at lvl 16 with his bare fist to try and prove a point about lack of endgame content and a real challenge. Endgame level can really end up being low. My only advice is to just try and enjoy the game while you can. The flaws really start to reveal themselves as the game drags on.
---
Lol if the workaround is just to not visit a location with unique individuals and a human vendor, then the game has a problem lol
---
No, none of them are if you are able to do simple multiplication.
---
This game is piss easy, just like fallout shelter.

It's there. Most people don't sing that part, but it's the same song.  It still feels kinda dirty.  There is a lot of shit we do that isn't horrifying.  I'm not saying it's all bad.  But there's a lot that has a really dirty history.  I think part of being a good American is uncovering the icky parts of history too, not just the good.  It's okay to enjoy something problematic as long as you recognise it isn't perfect.
---
If you want a really good, historically vetted, and accedemic source with lots of citations to sift through what of what you have heard is factual and what is myth, I would reccommend the book A People's History of the United States by Howard Zinn.  It was actually my high school's American history textbook.  
---
There is a lot that our culture really doesn't talk about or cover.  For example, did you know that the US has free education through High School because there was a brief period after the Civil War when many Black people took positions of public office and instituted many liberal reforms that have lasted for over a hundred years?  It was called the radical reform period.  It ended with the rise of Jim Crow Laws.  Concurrently with Jim Crow, there was a rise of Ugly Laws, which banned visibly disabled people from leaving their homes.
---
Or that until the 1980s disabled children didn't have the right to access public education?  That gaining that took years of sit-ins, demonstrations, and protest, at most of which the protesters were fed and supported by the Black Panthers?
---
Did you know that the majority of Washington DC was planned by a black archetect and built with slave labor?
---
There is nothing wrong with not having been taught these things, but it is never too late to learn, even if you feel like it doesn't represent your own beliefs.  I am Jewish, but I've read the whole bible and studied Christian reliegious history so I can talk to conservative Christians and understand where they're coming from, even if I don't agree.
---
That’s me on now anyway if your on and able to do it
---
yes this was supposed to happen after mayor for  a day but i had heard that it was bugged for some people the wastelanders update seemed to fix it for the people it was bugged for
---
nothing again this week
---
There is a 2nd terminal in a locked basement that requires a passcode to get to.  That terminal has a shut down code.  Once accesses you go back to the main terminal that starts project paradise and shut the robots down. When you do that the friendly animal will attack the enemies and die alot faster  and even if you do manage to keep them alive you will not have a chance to receive bear arm plans or mod plans.  In my opinion it's easier to let the robots do their thing and follow the friendly animal as he runs away from the enemies.   Their is a strategy to keeping all the animals alive till the end.  Always follow the friendly as it's running away and ignore all the enemies except for the ones getting near the friendly animal.
---
We shouldn’t have to avoid a location completely for it to work, they should just have a timer that actually works, y’know like dailies do
---
Workshop says with a popup "This is a PVP ZONE".
---
Do you ignore stop signs too?
---
I’m not a bloodied build
---
Yeah. The people with several hundred karma basically do it as a side job. I'm not saying they actually profit off it, but they take it VERY seriously and usually won't make a trade unless they're getting a net positive. The low karma traders are just clueless and under-offer out of ignorance half the time.

Go buy like 10-20k ammo. It is a good way to "bank" since most ammo sells for 1:1 in a vending machine. 308, 50, 556.
---
I just got the game a few days  back, level 26 now. Been playing it every day and I agree about how good it is. I'm dreading hitting end game though because there seems to be a super long time gated grind and I hate time gated stuff that just there to keep you artificially logging in each day.   
---
I also haven't found anyone to team up with or a reason to team up with them yet so I haven't really gotten into multiplayer element of it so maybe that'll have a lot of fun that will keep me coming back.
---
What’s the item?
---
Its moments like these that excite me for the day player lore becomes game lore.
---
Troubleshooter's armor and no more worries. I run a Berserker's build so I'm changing out my armor frequently depending on what I'm facing.
---
- Silos, Encryptid, AWOL - full set of Troubleshooter's
---
- SBQ - full set of Zealot's
---
- Whitespring's - full set of Ghoul Slayer's
---
- etc, etc you get the idea
---
At 5 pieces I get 75% damage reduction from whatever type I'm wearing. It was 90% back when the Radicals Face Mask was legendary, but C'est la vie...
---
A full set of level 1 leather armor weighs about 2.6 lbs (wood is even lighter) so I can carry multiple sets with me at the same time, and just swap out pieces as needed. In order to keep my DR at 0 I have two addictions that are -10 DR each, so I have up to 20 DR to work with before I see a penalty to the +50% damage from the Berserker's legendary prefix.
---
"We are now the Knights who Say… ekki-ekki-ekki-ekki-ptang-zoom-boing-mrowr!"
---
Yeah its known spot (there are a few only with Access to two deposits) . For me the only disadvantage would be reloading server cause those are very often occupied.
---
yea i remember when the base game was a survival server. many a times returning home to my nice warm bed only to see my camp up in flames. then slowly creeping in the woods dispensing wasteland justice to people with wanted levels. now. its boring as hell.
---
OP, Imgur has decided your post is porn and wen't let anyone view it without giving all their personal info to imgur.
---
Also the Leaked Chinese Jumpsuit and the Chinese Commando hat!
---
And the Original Chinese Assault rifle skin...
---
Althou why burn the US flag? That's horrible if you ask me...
---
I was most excited by the trailer with the PVP killing Preston garvey.
---
Sad to think you didn't.
---
Agreed, but my whole point is that maybe it'll be fixed on the 30th with fast travel and other bugs. Maybe not. If not, then let's all submit a bug reports.
---
Realistically, it's not getting fixed tomorrow. There is a documented and shared workaround until it's fixed. Complaining on reddit is not it.
---
i still cant figure out how a person can have a bounty. in PVE but be in passive mode so i cant kill them...... it negates the whole premise of the wanted level
---
No. We need challenges in the game. And you can defend against assaultrons with a piece or two of troubleshooters armor or level 3 refractor perk. With a full set of troubleshooters armor you can punch them in the face and walk away, unless they are a 3-star legendary, then you better hope your stealth is up to snuff cause they'll kill you anyway.
---
Encryptid?! i Hardly knew her!!
---
&gt;And I have to say, of all the hundreds of people I know, I can't think of a single one of them that acts like your stereotype. Of course they exist, but in a country of 330 million people, saying that it is half of them is strait up close minded biased. 
---
Yes, I am saying that country of 330 million, roughly half of the people are close minded.
---
I would argue that about almost any country on earth (mine too). Humans are close minded by nature. I is very difficult for us humans to overcome our insticts.
---
Also, 49% of people who voted in USA, did vote for Trump. Also, he has strong base support, despite continually pursuing ignorant and xenophobic policies, this is still a lot of people.
---
I also think that the recent BLM movement and continiued police brutality, despite all the video evidence and all the international condemnation has been allowed allowed to continue, demonstrates that in USA, there are enough people in keypostions (And people who voted them to key positions) who are fine or indifferent with it.
---
&gt;Where are you from? I bet wherever it is that I can come up with a few bigoted stereotypes that I have picked up from film and videogame cliches. Doesn't mean I would for a second believe that they are true for that society as a whole
---
I am from Finland. You are very welcome to try to find a stereotype that will prompt me to reply in the same manner that you have replied to my stereotype of your country.
---
EDIT; first sentence out, since I completely misread yours. Also added the keypostions part.
---
Nicely done. Ever take it out for a whirl and heal the ghouls at Whitespring?
---
What would be the point of an alt when you can't trade gold bullion rewards to other characters/players?
---
It would be fine if they even remotely considered Rebalancing the Fallout 4 numbers and power creep.
---
I play with a big bunch of people who have both m and f characters and neither of them ever got any weird reactions from people hearing their voices
---
I know of exactly ONE single case of someone being a creep sort neckbeard judging someone by his feminine voice - in almost two years of playing the game.
---
So I think it's safe to assume that the majority of people is pretty civilised.
---
Psn: The_Raging_Texan would be greatly appreciated man houre doing gods work
---
Great post! Disagree that “Colas are the backbone” of all the issues with PvP.
---
Came to say I was glad to see them put holiday stuff out in time for the holiday. That's good. But also the guy below is likely right, they'll have new 4th stuff right before the holiday.
---
Bloodied unyielding +35 strength or even more
---
Honestly, other than Smiley... there's no reason really to go back once you beat the questline. Go outside, play around with the cowbot. That's all good. Just don't go inside.
---
I think we might just have been spoiled. Seeing as Fasnacht often gave out three-star Legendaries as a reward. At least, for me.
---
Aside from Fasnacht, I rarely get three-star Legendary drops. Even before Fasnacht.
---
Hmmm, even the voiceless version speaks. Atleast the Patriot Prime does.
---
As long as they make her able to be crippled again. It's more of a downer having her fly away halfway through the fight.
---
To be fair, the community has thoroughly complained when seasonal/holiday themed items are released too late. That really applies more to halloween and Christmas though.

If they wanted to celebrate the 4th of July, they could’ve added some new items. The recycling from last year, even with discounts, is lame. It is a disappointing atomic shop for sure.
---
You're contribution is most appreciated
---
I use a friend to help me transfer.
---
Yeah why not? I have a BFFR Fixer and a JFFR Handmade. I use both because I may have one weapon over the other for each build. If I had all my perfect weapons in bloodied only then I would cure my addictions but the rng is shit in this game
---
Is the season actually starting with the update though?? They didn’t specify that in the last couple inside the vaults. Unless I read them wrong.
---
Mystery solved. Thanks gang!
---
Same issue for me too on PC. I had logged on aournd 2 hours ago and my loading time was around 10 minutes or so, after my game loaded, I saw that my all weekly/daily challenges completed.
---
Do you really have to ask?
---
Like... Really?
---
Unfortunately my camp budget would not be able to handle the new name.
---
lol, is that what you really think or are you being sarcastic? A decent amount of PvP players don't want a challenge, they just want to gank people minding their own business. I'm sure some people want good PvP against other PvP players, but the combat in this game isn't good enough for that kind of gameplay, so I don't get how anyone could possibly expect that to be feasible in this.
---
U have to activate 3 towers around the cabin and kill the 70lvl Asaltron. In a group of 4-5 allies it is a very easy task. And u can buy in every trainstation the special card for 1940 caps to build in any repair workbench the access card to start this event. Most important is to store ur junk before the event. I tried it solo during the quest and was killed by electrical damage of these towers. Using chinese stealth suite and perks there is a fun way to complete this quest with 0 damage recieved.
---
I don’t think PvP is fun because of Legendaries and mutations. There is nothing less fun than being killed by someone using a stealth boy who has low health and dodge perks who can kill you in one hit. Did I mention they can jump high too?
---
Nuclear winter is the best PvP has gotten for the game because it’s actually balanced and fun
---
though its still at risk, some say it protects the items but we also had cases where items with skins or even Atomshop-only items were stolen/bought with a similar glitch and rumor has it dupers already found ways to multiply and trade the new armor and weapons as well
---
It's a 1 in 3 chance from  a 3 star enemy. Someone did a big write up on the %'s a while back.
---
Every pvp centric player I've met asks me "hey do you wanna play some pvp? I wanna test something out"
---
I didnt fight back or lose. I was shot at, I ignored him, my teammate shot back, my camp was destroyed.
---
Wait is this SBQ damage thing something new?  I haven’t been on the sub in a few days and first few posts today were all about SBQ murder. What did I miss?
---
As pointed out before it's related to the mayor for a day quest and a bug fixed with wastelanders.
---
All I want to add is, isn't it nice to be able to walk around peacefully and not get wrecked by constant assaultron head cannons?
---
Cannibal Gang!
---
Nah. The Assaultron is a military class assault unit. She's supposed to be devastating. Let's see what happens when they release "one wasteland".
---
It wont burn to ash and you are just as likely to also destroy whatever it is hanging on, but I think you'll get your point across
---
Anything Nocturnal. Doesn't matter if it's armor or weapons.
---
So what I'm hearing is Scorched Earth is turning into another event where one person hordes the drops and most people come away wit the bare minimum.   Gotta love this game.
---
Not trolls but many people seems to love weird/ugly stuff (that is supposed to be funny but just makes this game look like fortnite) as bethesda is producing almost only this crap. If you want more realistic/postapo approach or at least more tuned to previous fallouts main themes you are stuck with mayby 1/5 updates of atomic shop. I dont mind people loving zazzy etc stuff but there is not much normal stuff to wear...
---
Do they have steel?
---
It appears to be a survival style outfit with a hockey mask. You can find it in this datamine: https://m.imgur.com/a/lKbWyNJ
---
Blood eagles spawned with the NW lasers and assault rifles for the first month of Wastelanders. That tells you the level of incompetence or at the least the lack of care we are dealing with.
---
Right....
---
Can't have enemies that are an actual threat. It might require you to use your brain.
---
Probably having 1st and nothing to friggin buy... I'm at 4300 now because there hasn't been anything I wanted in about a month.
---
I started playing recently and dont even have enough to buy the collectron station
---
No.
---
This enemy is far too OP for not dropping anything but scrap.
---
I'm fine with the damage. Its annoying sure, but doesn't being overpowered and one shotting every enemy get old?
---
Finally they brought back the alien stuff!
---
Interesting, I didn’t know that. That explains a lot then. I just see Bethesda every time I log in I guess I press A too fast to see any other beginning credits lol. Still though, Bethesda can’t take some notes?
---
Thanks for confirming.
---
Yeah I love the guys that say here's my list what do you want and then you pick something and then they tell you that it's too much for what you have to offer in that you have nothing else they could possibly want to get that out of them it's a waste of time and annoying but what do you do. Lol
---
Good stuff will drop later, they want people to burn their "free" atoms leveling up with seasons than once most of those are dried up and people will have to start spending cash those great skins will drop.
---
Even at max budget, its still possible to have the stash exploit happen. I had my 850 stimpacks (traveling pharmacy perk and been collecting stims since the beta) stolen from my body after I watched someone spawn in, jump through the floor as the camp was loading and access the vendor before they loaded in. Then when I went into my inventory later all my stimpacks were gone. Filed a ticket with bethesda but they can't do anything :( 
---
I just ended up turning off my vendors so no one fast travels to the camp until they fix it.
---
To be honest, the events are incredibly easy if you have half a brain. The objectives are simple and the gameplay is even simpler. Are you here for an event or are you here to play West-Tek farming run 28172738?
---
same happened to me right yesterday evening. my lvl 18 4th char got attacked by an lvl 58 in the chinese stealth suite, i logged in my mule account, swaped to my lvl 830 main and showed him how bullying feels like.
---
Why is it horrible? It's just a flag.
---
I mean a whole state, and more, is flooding with radioactive monsters. But burning a flag of a dead nation would be too much?
---
I wouldn't say that, 1500+ sneak dmg to ghoul heads with a pipe revolver. But then I have several other ghouls slapping me around and I die in no-time. That's when I switch to crippling shotgun, which mitigates the slapping a bit if I have good aim (or do OP magic VATS). 
---
Still I have mad respect for lvl62 ghouls, which is how it should be - they're fucking max level after all! I wonder how you don't get swarmed and how you can 1 hit ghouls with a lvl 10 sledge. Could it be you're running an unbalanced OP build?
---
I have seen SPECIAL stats as high as 45. The benefits of SPECIAL stats do not cap out except for the durability of crafted items.
---
Oh they totally can and should yeah but, well I guess they don't think they need to 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
What did it all include that you still have access to?
---
Damnit. Enforcer. I always forget about leg crippling.
---
Not tried but as far as I know it would just kill them as it does more ballistic damage and I don't think rads heal ghouls in 76?
---
Yo can I get a writeup on how you got all that stuff on the shelves? Flamethrower trick?
---
Other than farming the random encounters and helping settlers out, no there isn't anything else. Just make sure to give Ward the photos for free to get max rep bonus for that and donate your reward to Foundation when you find his lost gear.
---
Taking the term superfood to a whole new level.
---
I agree with you. While I do enjoy pvp when it’s done right. It doesn’t NEED to be in fallout. It never was before and it doesnt have to be there now just because it’s online. NW is fine as it’s own mode, but as for pvp in adventure mode it doesn’t need to be there just because it’s in every other online game.

---
Yw . The underarmor / outfit thing has been a recent trend. Would be nice if they retroactively add that for more pieces.
---
The concept of being able to have multiple cameras is that there are multiple lenses mods and multiple skins. I have inadvertently accrued 6 ProSnap cameras 😂
---
You have to wait for them to try and take it fist you can't be an old man with a hose yelling at kids to get off his lawn
---
I agree challenges are great, they push you to be better. I really hope if they do add mods later on to put in a damage multiplyer. Some people want less damage coming in and some enjoy that nightmare aspect of 1 or 2 good shots and you're dead.
---
There should be a small red marker on your HUD with the wanted sign and bounty price. If not then the invader most likely pickpocket something and took it
---
Edit: lockpicked
---
You don’t need to turn off pacifist in a workshop zone. It is still one of the few contested territories where you can shoot others when they try and take it. You might have been wanted from that but not sure
---
It would kill the economy tbh
---
Well if there is a way to get Atomic shop items without paying, I am sure Bethesda is on top of it and fixing it right away /s
---
But seriously, it’s kinda true.
---
Economy sucks now as is anyways
---
Tell Frank and his lovely wife Amanda i said Hi and ask him if he joins us for the game this weekend. Really nice dude.
---
[shelf trick](https://youtu.be/Fp3TOm48m8E)
---
**drops mic** yeah no one has ever proposed that idea before
---
I’m pumped for Patriotic items but I agree that this was a filler update.
---
No marker so I am not wanted then?
---
It will have to do. There are no enclave or free states flags, are there? That would have worked as well, no burning required.
---
Most likely did I just never seen it
---
sounds like there were still enemys alive which prevent a full respawn of all enemys.
---
mostly it's the roaches inside the golf club building, could be the enemy in the pool nearby or the deathclaw/honeybeast spawn.
---
I don't get you. Maybe you don't understand what flags mean to people. 
---
I'm from Finland and i respect my country's flag and the history that lives in that flag. Burning it would be an attack towards that country, it's history, it's culture and it's people.
---
The Red Rocket Ranger skin works with it.
---
Sorry man. That blows :( but yeah I think it’ll just start to happen with greater frequency until they come up with a comprehensive fix.
---
Sometimes I think the fallout 76 dev team is just like a group of 5 dudes Bethesda hired and they just can’t keep up with the game. That’s what it seems like at least. I know that’s a little harsh when you think about it, but is it really, considering the state of the game compared to other Bethesda titles lol idk. It’s just frustrating seeing my favorite game universe going in odd directions.
---
Fair point. But all rare weapons would no longer be nearly as rare
---
I think Freestates for sure. 
---
Nothing for the Enclave as usual
---
Let’s be honest unless you have a bloodied fixer nobody is even HEARING your inventory outside of that these days
---
Or just add the easiest thing to that, makes weapon non sellable.... economy = as it is.
---
You'll get there:) just do as many dailies and weeklies as you can. The only really hard part is if something ends up coming out that you want more than an item you've been saving for.
---
there is a new mod out on nexus, where they replace the usual display cases with the windowless one.
---
this is only clientside, so only you will see the change in any camp.  
---
 [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/632](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/632)
---
Thanks for the link, I'll check it out!
---
I guess I don't put the same weight to symbolism in a game where said country no longer exists.
---
One of the biggest problems is when mob wave spawn and remain docile in some corner of the map. You have to run around the habitats &amp; try to find them
---
I never get the option to send the runaway raider to foundation, I get attack, and charisma check to take their caps and tell the crator "it's done".
---
Well im currently grounded and can only play at my friends house.luckily i have a mini projectir and an xbox, so i just bring it to his house and play with him
---
I noticed that. I totally agree with you. Next week isn't looking good either right now.
---
My only gripe is that I wish I could clean them with a bar of soap or abraxo cleaner especially Settler Wanderer, she is absolutely filthy.
---
If I couldn’t trade to get the things i wanted I would’ve been going through this game with a full nocturnal build
---
Good on ya, I usually disdain from PvP unless I have a good enough reason to and this was one of those times.
---
We're meant to encourage new players and bring them into the community, not make life difficult for them that they might rage quit and never pick the game up again.
---
You know what you've convinced me. I am so fed up with trying to trade. I can't get anything good cause I haven't rolled anything good myself and dont want to trade the few good stuff friends have gave me
---
looks good to me, but I get it. I'm new so I got six more months of new stuff that make all you veterans go meh. see you in 2021
---

Brotherhood PC discord. It is one of the best ones I have encountered.
---
That’s what I’m saying, I’d rather take my chances randomly rolling weapons instead of trading or hoping purvy drops it instead of getting a hunters grenade launcher instead
---
the trick is to shoot near their feet.
---
and yes, rads heal them - that's why it is the worst game ingame.
---
Really?.. 23th. Nobody?
---
show me the explosive shovel. if you own one, you know it's hacked.
---
Yup, one of the first things I check for at all the vendors.
---
You do you then.
---
Not me
---
Ya thats what jest happens to me I jest joined fallout 1st last month and this was my first subscription payment, sorry if it doesn't makes sense 😅
---
wouldn't say that. 
---
i know people who looking for certain nocturnal items, they use it for roleplaying purposes or collectibles.
---
Hopefully he's a good friend! lol
---
But yes, I've read about this method of transferring items.
---
And you, good sir/madam
---
Also, if it has to be explained. Obviously I'm not a flag burner in real life :P
---
The worst part is they fixed it at one point but it came back with wastelanders
---
It is fiddly and tedious, especially on a console, but I dig the look. You can see where I didn't get it quite right.  The frog jar is sitting a little low
---
You have no idea how incredibly uncomfortable this made me
---
#3 is the big one for me.  
---
As a melee stealth build I liked to patiently stalk my prey, then catching them when they pull out their pip boy. 
---
Being punished for being methodical with my position highlighted on the map forced me to play frantically to keep a good k/d. 
---
If survival mode returned as it was, without the map highlighting, I'd be happy
---
Still see the items up for sale though.
---
But you must see that your argument goes both ways. We don't want to play the same way as you, and your way of playing interferes with our way of playing, so you've now got your own game mode, can't we have ours?
---
There are so many respawn bugs right now it's comical.

---
a ton of plans sound like someone opened holiday presents for caps.
---
I do not. The game already accommodates PVE players too much for my tastes. Don't flag if you don't want to fight.
---
Damn, that looks pretty cool.

I just wanna go in a vault, fallout without vaults is weird. And i know they used to be raids.
---
I uploaded a new one, imgur is weird
---
Again, I'm sure there are people who wish to do PvP against other PvP players, but to claim all the people getting grief is only from other PvE players is absurd. They are literally killing other players, that makes them PvP players.
---
Oh okay, I may have missed it. I'll look for the write up. I guess I'm just coming up dry in the RNG lotto lately.
---
I thought I was on an ESO sub for a second.
---
There's a section of the song which isn't commonly sung at sporting events that basically glorifies the idea of black men fighting on the front lines on behalf of their masters.
---
It can be frustrating. My bloody build character has full scout unyielding/ap refresh/ - damage when standing still set. A full perfect set (imo). 
---
because of this, i havent been able to get a SS armor piece that is that perfect match, so I am just running my old set.
---
How long?
---
Time, disease cure, or antibiotics should do it.
---
Check out morgantown airport hangers.  There’s usually a few in there.  Might have to pick a lock on a first aid kit.
---
That's where your wrong kiddo (shoots finger guns).
---
Tell me, what good comes from a Nocturnal Grenade Launcher? Nocturnal seems like it's perfect for stealth builds, and I've never seen a combination stealth-explosives build.
---
No, this is common in these types of games. Look at these updates as not for you (the veteran) but to keep players like me (the noobs) in the fold. I am overjoyed at fascnacht, meat week (i thought that was coming soon?), and july 4th updates. These have brought me back each week doing challenges. I actually still have alot of challenges on my list (Like scrap or craft 76 laser weapons). The seasons stuff is for you guys as I still have a lot of content to grind through before I care about more quests and legendary perks.
---
I would run blocker
---
salute. that is real commitment.
---

Sorry, you failed the Turing test. Nice try though :)
---
Not long I was trying to get well rested and caught it before getting to well rested. I was at the white spring station
---
Wah?
---
tell me, what good comes from a Grenade Launcher? I have a Explosive Char with a bloodied FFR and TS FFS Auto Launcher, both sucks - the TS breaks apart within 20 shots. not to mention a Fatman or RPG.
---
explosive guns are nerfed to death anyway.
---
nocturnal handmade, fixer, anything else with suppressor is viable.
---
The second part.
---
That's not at all what that line means. Opposite actually. 
---
I honestly had forgotten about the slave line, but it is litterally a half a line in a song that is 95% about mostly white soldiers dying- and it was about how basically everybody was the same as they were fighting for their lives.
---
I think there's a problem, last night I was alone on a public server, within about 20 minutes everybody left
---
Agreed. Speaking of which, anyone got some cobalt and violet fluxes to sell for less than 1k a pop? Ive been server hoping since yesterday, cause i finally bought jetpack mod for my ss.... this was the only offer i could find :/ im on ps4 btw jist writing here in desperation :)
---
After Fallout 76,let's never refer to Todd Howard as God Howard anymore.
---
If you want more defence then blocker is a better choice
---
Done. Thanks.
---
They need to create a deathmatch mode with classes and predetermined loadouts already.  Would be more easier to control and balance that I bet.
---
And yeah, Adventure mode should just completely forgo PvP except in mutual duels.  Get rid of the wanted system, repurpose workshops into global events, and either tweak, or get rid of the other PvP elements like those rare PvP events and that one radio station nobody seems to use.  Most of the PvP features in Fallout 76 were a bust and objectively complete failures since most of the playerbase has no interest in it.
---
I am all for it just as long as it is stupidly expensive..
---
Yeah I couldn't image trying to build on console. I'm such a stickler for detail
---
No, just you.
---
Havent played it in 6 months ish, still play 4 on occasion. 
---
Cant they make this more like 4 and let me set up bases and transport routes!
---
Gotta turn in 4 items at that to get 1 hunters fatman and hope against Tomorrow
---
How about under armour being a hootenanny, overall?
---
Thanks for the post. still no fireworks or colored flares :(
---
Besides dropped junk you also have a few caps at stake, up to 50 based on your level. But yes it is very low risk. For me personally that's the main reason I like to mess around with some PVP. I don't have a PVP build at all but enjoy the challenge of fighting a person rather than the dumb mobs. It's just fun, that's the reward. 
---
Survival mode had higher risk early on because you also dropped aid when killed, and a lot of it. That was eventually nerfed to the point of being very low risk as the drops were less and you risked fewer caps. A lot of PVP players went back to adventure where it was more profitable. Caps and junk had a lot more value back then.
---
for the glassed cavern in particular, there is a pretty neat bug.  
---
just collect any ultracite ore, fast travel to the entrance (fast travel, don't exit manually) and re-enter the cave again. the ores should be back, but since bethesda put a 20h cooldown on any ores you can click them again without harvesting it. the ultracite ores inside the cave are special, evreytime someone klick them, they spawn a few enemys.
---
Okay 👌🏾
---
After going through hell with my ex it's best to play with myself lol 😂
---
Post up on fo76 market best bet. Not on ps4 unfortunately
---
Yeah. 1/3 still kinda sucks haha.
---
Kiddo I'm probably older then your dad I'm retiered
---
I wanna say it took a bit over 2 hours to do 5 shelves,  2 short, 3 tall.
---
Don't know why you're being downvoted here but this is exactly what's happening. My buddy can do &gt;70k per hit with a meat hook POST wastelanders.. it might be a Deathclaw Gauntlet I forget.
---
Barbarian caps, so if you have 15 strength the third star doesn't do anything. Also, any DR over 350 has diminishing returns based on the way the game calculates damage. So, yeah, blocker is better. Chance to negate damage will always beat damage resist.
---
Shhhhhh! Someone at Bethesda might try to FIX it if it's something that works....
---
Hes not. I know what you're talking about which is why I dont team up with randos anymore
---
I literally resting in a swamp icn a sleeping bag for like 5 min and still nothing
---
Update 21
---
Agreed
---
Not into cosmetics, or perfumes for that matter.  Every atom shop update is disappointing.  The only things I've really used are to hide the SS armor which looks ridiculously nonfunctional, and the gillie suit so I can AFK in bushes better.
---
Has anyone ever even used a photo frame?
---
Pre-wastelanders I'd say a good 50 cal, preferably in a two shot, furious or anti-armor prefix (Zealots OK but for SBQ only) with either a FFR or explosive secondary attribute. The 50 cal is probably the most balanced heavy wep in the game. It doesn't have the biggest clip or the most damage or the fastest fire rate but it's a good balance of everything you want in a good heavy weapon and most importantly, no spin-up. Honorable mentions are gatling laser and plasma (not ultracite) but they're plagued by their own issues, namely poor durability. 
---
Post-wastelanders it's definitely the gauss minigun, with the same legendary attributes,  save for explosive which it can't be but is already,  a little. Massive damage, huge clip,  extraordinary fire rate and yeah there's spin-up but it's meaningless, because once it gets going it'll melt just about any normal large mob (Behemoth, Sheepsquatch, etc) in seconds. The cautionary tale is that the ammo crafting cost is extraordinary, so I recommend conserving ammo by only using it when  necessary. Generally what I do is use my 50 cal while the SBQ is in the air and the second she goes to land I switch to the Gauss MG and use that for as long as she's grounded, rinse repeat as necessary.
---
Gotcha, the way its worded in the op is confusing because I wouldn't really consider doing the quest "farming," but technically you can farm the dailies while doing the quest lines.
---
As someone who constantly uses photomode, yes
---
teammate of mine also managed somehow to have a ATX skin with the Strangler heart bushes on his PA. he said he just applied the skin, nothing unusual, but the Strangler keeps.  
---

---
Sorry for the slow reply. I'll give it a try again this weekend.
---
So much good stuff coming in the same week. I keep saying it and will say it, they need to increase budget limit so I can use all these things in my camp.   
---
That Liberty Prime armor is amazing. I've been using the Red Rocket armor cause it looks like Iron Man, now I'll look like Iron Monger.
---
Weird maybe I just got unlucky. Do you have any disease resistance from food or chems?
---
I would assume the dirtier the better so if you find a dirty bed somewhere hop in and you should have it in no time
---
33.3333333333333333333333% of any 3star enemy.
---
If PVE and PVP were to be separated completely, what would then happen to the bounty system?  Would it be eliminated as well and would player camp locks then become unpickable or would thieves be able to operate without consequence?
---
Personally, I think the bounty system in 76 is interesting but flawed.  I got a bounty once when a player attacked me while I was selling to a vendor and some combination of reactive plates/mutations killed my attacker while I was in passive mode.  It sucked.
---
Gotta add me in the social menu, and then usually I have to add you back because it's a little janky most of the time.
---
Sounds like you want to do a trade. The trading sub is a good place for that sort of thing.
---
I didn't read  the whole thing but I agree that they need to bring back survival mode and go back to the old leaderboard (and having the top 3 on the map scene).  I used to have so much fun stalking a player for an hour before trying to kill or be killed.  My wife would also play and we it would freak us out when someone approached us.  Such a great idea.  And if we wanted to just play normally, we would play PvE.  No big deal.
---
its to complicated for my pea brain to title it correctly so i just go one here
---
My point was exactly that. Most people dont care about the objective.
---
Nah, need to play a different game.
---
Just jumped to some 300lvl camp, had a lot of junk listed, i was thinking that must be it. Disconnect....
---
Troubleshooters is so easy game vs robots it's actually funny. From sweating and running away like frightened squirrel, to confident "in your face - *mano a mano*" vs gutsys and assaultrons. Going V.A.T.S. for limbs and with only 3 troubleshooter parts it's walk in the park. 
---
Encrypt event IS still challenging, and requires certain *know how* to succeed, but at least gutsys don't hurt as much...
---
I have - 125% disease resistance
---
It's strange, I got off 76 at like 9pm CST last night because I was super tired. I got online like an hour ago. Have not been on NW, so it can't be NW.
---
I assumed it was because of me buying fo1st. But I honestly don't know.
---
Brutal.  I feel ya, been on that grind many a day for calibrated legs and jet packs!
---
Just got it
---
Yup.  Looked at the leaked stuff coming up for the season thing.  They all blow goats too.  Zero interest in any of it.
---
Main thing is the team thing is coming.  That should allow them to do things like vault raids a lot more successfully.
---
I don’t remember the Mothman backpack/wallpapers or any of the Red Rocket stuff ever being in the store more than once 🤔
---
I actually just scrapped it for redesign based on the comments above that suggested my base crashed the server....
---
I don't think those are exclusive for fallout 1st. Fallout 1st items are usually marked as such.
---
Well, they all do exactly the same stuff once their quests are done—if they had them in the first place. None are effective at defense, they’re all super buggy with handing out dailies.
---
So it's totally fault of Bethesda servers I suppose.
---
I dont understand the issue.
---
I like being afraid of at least 1 thing in this game.  =)
---
When I read about dealing with them is easy if you go for their legs, it changed it all; cripple it down, evade the beam and finish 'em off.
---
Oof. Idk if you saw my pirate ship build (it's made the rounds a couple times) but the sails were a real bitch to get lined up at times haha.
---
I didn't, would be interested though
---
Red rocket one also works for the T-65
---
Possibly, I have no idea.
---
This is last years stuff, I'm sure there will be new stuff next week
---
Wait wait wait your icon was visible on the *survival gamemode? That's a trap for sweaty tryhards.
---
I’m taking about the free item they release every week if you could read...
---
obviously you are treating this with the seriousness it deserves..
---
I'm American and I dislike overt patriotism.
---
Like, being proud of your country isn't bad in-and-of itself.  But I associate the people who are *really* devout about it as cretins with something to hide.  In much the same way I look down on people who are super religious and feel the need to remind people of this all the time.  What are you hiding?  In that case, they use the Bible as a cudgel to beat others into submission.  The flag, an innocent symbol on its own, is often used in the same way.
---
Those are already broken enough as they are, they shouldn't be messing with that mechanic any more
---
It was the Meathook 😁,now bfss powerfist and dcg are best i think.i use unstoppable monster and bfss powerfist.yeh no clue why i get downvoted either 🙁.if im with for example 3 buddies doing queens she sometimes dont even have the chance to regenerate
---
Trade posts on this sub have a good chance of being deleted though. I believe in you, you can do it champ!!
---
Pacifist mode doesn't stop you from killing anyone, and someone with a bounty should be 100% attackable. Pacifist just makes it so they cannot damage you or other players.
---
Are they changing PvP again?
---
Run every load bearing you see. I run all.50 and 5mm (Gatling gun for regular guys since it does more damage per shot and is good enough 90% of the time)
---
That's not a either or question. 
---
Yes, higher DR/ER makes added DR/ER less beneficial.
---
Waste is determined by you and your build. Are you dying frequently?
---
Bloodied always beats Junkies in the damage. Sadly.
---
But you have no health if you go that route.
---
I admire you for managing to get 5 characters through it, getting my 1 character through was hard enough. It’ll be months into years before I put another character through WL, in the hopes that the bugs will actually be fixed by then.
---
It’s very disappointing to me. I felt like they took their time with Wastelanders, and I’m okay with that. What I’m not okay with is that the main questline for it is bugged to hell. The kind of bugs that prevent you from progressing unless you switch into a new server and then lose all your progress. It would be less of an issue if progress was checkpointed and saved and the enemies killed in a private interior stayed dead, but that’s also not the case. As it stands now, it can be very demoralizing.
---
The sails are a bit different now and I've added some detail work, but this is more or less what it looks like:

Just keep pulling that mole-miner slot-machine arm hoping for a score.
---
So you can kill mobs you kill in 1 shot even faster or something!
---
Just making it so people can't gang up on others. People are freaking out about it.
---
Cheers, it’s so painful lol
---
I mean in extract, Say I had a junkies lever and a junkies plasma what would win
---
ok thank you ill try X
---
Yes sir. Enforcer all day. Usually one shot at the feet lays her down, and another to the head to cripple that laser. She is totally harmless then, almost totally anyway. She can still attempt melee from a crawling position.
---
There was new content last week and people were still upset
---
What RN means? I've seen it all over but could not find an answer
---
Lever.
---
Plasma has rarer ammo, and lower damage however obviously energy damage.
---
No, I pick them up, get the music and splash screen, go back to camp to put it in the vending machine and it's gone.  Happened 3 times now in the last week or two.
---
yeah but a plasma can be made automatic
---
Cheers, I’ll give that a go. Thank you
---
Oh no! Moved your tent? How dare you!!
---
That's what my friend and I do. Then yell "LT Dan you ain't got no legs!" Good times
---
Had the atoms burning a hole in my pocket anyway.  I’m happy.
---
Is that HAAARRDDD wooooddd... or is it sooooofffttt
---
awesome thanks
---
I've reported them both, guarantee xbox wont ban them though lol
---
&gt;They purposely broke the mode and then used negative player sentiment as an excuse to get rid of it.
---
Yall are sooooo dramatic on here. Little children lmao
---
Unrelated question, i'm a newcomer, will i be able to gain a jetpack or i need to buy it from the store?
---
Top of my head the pip boy paint, the garage that is all messed up, the red rocket jump suit, the huge red rocket sign that blows up
---
I know, the audacity! Even though he claims to have fallout 1st and could of just put his own tent down..
---
How much for the lead backpack mod 😁
---
I am in Passive mode and am still getting harrassed by players trying to bait me into PVP. If I wanted PVP, it's pretty simple to do so. But no... means NO! Case in point: While waiting on a nuke to drop, AND sitting on my own survival tent, I had some immature turd nibbler constantly trying to get me to shoot him while I was aiming down at a Deathclaw. Not exaggerating but this went on for several minutes, until the nuke dropped and SBQ started. And don't get me started on trap camps! Punji boards and traps shouldn't kill passive players, leaving my junk loot for them to pick up. (Please don't tell me to dump my crap in my stash beforehand. Sometimes I would like to see a player's camp design if I am in the area, without paying through the nose in Fast Travel fees to come back. I once paid 45 caps, with the travel discount perk, only to find nothing I could use at the vendor. Disappointed and costly! Hence the reason why if a "vendor" is nearby after an event or mission, I'd investigate his/her supposed merchandise...)
---
Downvoting for unauthorized tent movement. Also calling my friend who knows liberty prime because you are a communist for not paying your permit fees.
---
nope.
---
i have two accounts, one main with 1st and a mule without.
---
almost every week my main with 1st have discounts my mule without 1st don't have.
---
i never ever saw a specific 1st discount marked in the ATX shop.
---
Me too, I need more America in my camp!
---
I made base modifications to account for this. Actually it’s one of the things I liked about Survival. It’s the only time I really got into base building/mechanics.
---
I don't understand the point of making cool looking under armor anyway. Like the BOS under suits. Looks awesome but you can't wear it alone. What's the point?
---
I agree! I felt like they took their time releasing Wastelanders, and I’m okay with that, but I’m not okay with the main questline being bugged to hell like this.
---
Ok. You’re in there for what? 30 seconds? Get your bullion and move one.
---
Nocturnal, swing speed, 150 damage resistance: binoculars
---
It's just a joke but apparently people don't get that.
---
Lmao I don't think that's harsh at all, I think the games basically just a huge asset flip cash grab honestly seeing how short it's development was and the state it released in I highly doubt it has a proper team of 100+ people dedicated to it. Unfortunately Bethesda really isn't the same company anymore it's only focus seems to be making as much money as humanly possible at any expense, I've had no respect for them since the paid mods debacle.
---
I've been saying the same thing since the release of the game, but they just don't seem to want to listen to what the majority have been asking for.
---
Having played pvp games for years, I can tell you now that pvp in Fallout doesn't work, it just doesn't, and the reason why is because the gameplay and mechanics are just not suited for pvp, and this is bethesda's problem. Fallout is a single player game, it always has been, and really should always be, the pvp side of things could have been okay, if they had made different game modes specifically for pvp, like all multiplayer games do. Not just shitty battle royale, make pvp separate entirely and let people play modes like team games, objective games, attack and defend type games, with weapon classes and loadouts. But for that to work, they would have to reconfigure the controls for pvp, and that's the biggest issue.
---
It happens a lot in NW and it happened a lot in survival, the controls and mechanics don't work, the little lag you get from switching weapons, the ridiculously slow reload speeds, the absolute atrocious aim down scope issues, the complete uselessness of bolt action and semi auto weapons, the controls to switch weapons and access your pip boy. No other popular multiplayer game has these controls, and for good reason, you need everything accessible via one push of a button, not one push of a button followed by a selection of options, or a pause because you're switching weapons, it's incredibly poor design taken straight from Fallout 4, which as a single player game, those controls were acceptable, not with 76, and it's baffling that they thought it would be acceptable to be used in a multiplayer setting, especially when the majority of combat in Fallout games are reliant on VATS.
---
I agree with everything you've said, and just wish they would actually listen to the fans who stick by them through these playground like naive judgements of game decisions and take note of what people want and how the game could be improved to make them look better, and to improve the game for everyone, instead of closing themselves off and hoping for the best.
---
That's not that much anymore 😂😂 thanks to dupers
---
Hey if I could see out of binoculars and they do some damage I’d take that
---
My go to gun is the Mutants 25% FFR Gatling Gun, great for long range, close range and can easily pick off the enemy waves the SBQ throws out
---
I'd say the gatling gun, ammo is very easy to farm without going into crafting, 1 or 2 Super Mutants use miniguns at known Super Mutant locations and they drop 100 bullets but on rare occasions 500 instead. Despite slow fire rate it does make back with a mean punch and can be used to snipe enemies especially the Queen when it is flying, hovering or diving
---
Got wood... Chop wood
---
Yeah people are shit. What's new 😡
---
I'm calling my friend who works at Burger King. The King shall hear of this!
---
I should have said discounts instead of sales. I'll edit what I can.
---
You may have heard/read "Bethesda promised exclusive sales and discounts for Fallout 1st members and has since removed all mentions of this anywhere on their site. What a scummy business tactic and they are liars".
---
If you haven't heard, then there's nothing to clarify.
---
Does this mean I can finally get that cute af Zetan plush?
---
My berserker keeps the game fresh for me. Having practically no armor means every fight is exciting. Even the mutants at grafton damn can give me problems if I'm not careful.
---
I can't answer about the T-65 but the voice lines can be heard by others. I've been fighting the SBQ and heard that thing out of nowhere and it surprised me the first time.
---
The op isn’t talking about the bundles they are talking about the one free atomic shop item you can get every week
---
Yeah, you can put the skin on T65, but the helmets flashlight/visor is bugged on T65 (it is working on T45 for example).
---
Even if you use the silent helmet, the armor chest itself talks more :)
---
And others can hear your armor talking.
---
To be honest, I thought you were complaining about fallout first peeps getting exclusive sales or whatnot.
---
I don't think I have any of what you are looking for specifically, but if you are playing later we can drop a nuke anywhere you want. 
---
And you should be paying maybe 200 caps per flux. And that is if you arn't taking duping into consideration.
---
I started with Wastelanders. All these free and atom items are still new to me...
---
If that is what you are going for so that is a valid point. :)
---
The problem is I do not know how you are playing as you didnt give any info.
---
Are you doing full auto or semi? 
---
Are you stealth or just normal?
---
Thats all info that can help decide.
---
Without any input its a bit difficult you know :)
---
I have a b3315 for sale if you’re interested
---
Honestly, a fair bit of decent stuff this week... I just wish they weren't all bundles. There's three different sets that I really only want one item from... :\
---
I didn't know we have to clear the place first, thanks for that.
---
Yup same, and I very quickly realized it's not worth the time/headache to retaliate. I'll just let them take it and dick around doing other things till they leave. It honestly doesn't take long, I feel like those people get bored easily and when no one plays their game they just jump servers. Although one time they didn't bother to lock anything and I just kept collecting my loot like nothing happened.
---
I might actually engage in PVP if they made it more worth my while to participate but even then I'd be weary. Last time I did the guy had his friends wreck my camp, which isn't a terrible loss but it ruins the spirit of the game for me in a community that I otherwise love. Thank god they got rid of making the whole team hostile.
---
But you have to change perks for it in automatic. I found the plasma to be weak. I much prefer the lever and the handmade or fixer is much better in automatic.
---
Man, that hurts. Made it all the way to killing the final boss and had to restart it? I am sorry. 
---
For me, the final boss glitched out of existence before I could have a chance to loot it but at least it didn’t crash my system thank god. I would have rage-quit because I also needed to start the Ra-Ra quest 3 times.
---
&gt; YOU MUST SEPARATE PVP SERVERS FROM PVE SERVERS ENTIRELY 
---
This is the basic truth. Without it we move nowhere. PVE servers need to be the norm, with no PVP. And then Bethesda can try to reimplement PVP is some way. I'd prefer instanced PVP, like WoW Battlegrounds, but PVP servers are also a good thing.
---
Fallout is a PVE game. Even 76 is played like a PVE game. Workshops are PVP feature, but people mostly interact with them for PVE benefits. To sum it all - people want PVE. Only a tiny tiny minority wants PVP, true PVP. Some people want "PVP" to enjoy griefing, but those should never be listened to...
---
Basically a normal player should be able to access 100% of the main game (adventure mode) without ever stepping into PVP.
---
yeah.. I only went in there when required to do so.. and now not at all...
---
Ive spent more time picking the corn than being inside...
---
Can confirm. Nothing scares me more than a super mutant with a Minigun.
---
Still no balloons
---
Seconded.
---
Right now.
---
I just hate pvp in general
---
I've got Hunter's Pipe Revolvers for days son! Why would I want to craft anything when I have been given everything?
---
Exactly! Same applies to the other prefixed armors as well. As a Berserker (with 0 DR) I can stand underneath the SBQ when she lands and hammer away at her without a care in the world using Zealot's gear. Everything that she spawns is scorched, so it's only a mild annoyance to get mobbed as opposed to instant death.
---
"hahahaha! HAAAAHAAAAHHHAAAHAA!! WE'RE ALL HAVING FUU... Ohhh a hater. Ok pack up your bags. *Sight* never really can get away from the haters"
---
See what I mean! Some people get all the luck 😤😤
---
I had that issue for weeks but all of a sudden fixed itself randomly, hope smiley offers you a deal soon!

Someone nuked Foundation the other day for me too.  Insects seem to drop hi-rad fluid almost as much as Scorched.

On my junkies and bloodied heavy gunners my goto is my Minigun.  Love that thing.

Let's hope

I'll have a chicken royale with bacon!

I moan and complain every week on these posts and I never say thank you, so thank you for reminding me to do so.
---
Did it cover fissure prime?
---
Man atom shop additions have been so underwhelming the past few weeks. The log cabin (walls) we were all so excited for just turned out to be a plopable asset. The water wheel didn't actually produce electricity, and then ends up broken.
---
How about giving us new stuff in general?
---
How about them making an armor skin for once actually rare? So if you have it you feel dope. 
---
I used the Waster PA skin now for the longest time as it wasn't in the atomic shop since I started. And it felt so cool to be almost the only one with that because it was so rare.
---
And now they put it on sale...
---
FFS...
---
PS4 here.
---
Well I mean... “end game” is literally just legendary farming, do that for a thousand hours in the same few spots, it’s gonna get boring. Once you hit a high level and practically everything is trivial to kill, of course you’d get bored. Bethesda need to work on an endgame that isn’t just “go here, fill target with 2k rounds, get loot”.
---
Personally after 150 hours it got boring for me. There's nothing to do anymore. I completed Wastelanders but it was pretty short. I completed all the "main" quests that were released before Wastelanders and all i can do now is farm these boring ass dailies which are the exact same quest every day. 
---
I don't have any good weapons and i have some decent armor but i don't feel like i want to farm because there's simply nothing to use those weapons on. 
---
Currently im sitting at 185 hours and for the last week or two ive been opening the game once a day just to complete the dailies and maybe some challenges to get atoms and i close it. Don't play more than an hour a day. 
---
I dropped a nuke once and managed to kill the Scorchbeast but i can't see myself farming the same thing over and over, especially when the loot is trash
---
Hoping some new exciting content gets added soon but i bet it'll be short.
---
I believe the chest still makes the voice lines as well. I only use the arms and legs cause they look like the tesla PA from fo4.
---
Blocker is a much better option. I've found that (minus) damage % works better than a higher DR / ER.
---
"HE IS TOO DANGEROUS TO BE KEPT ALIVE!!!"
---
Yeah, the chest made the sounds...
---
But the whole set looks clumsy with the t65 chest.
---
It’s clearly broken if you have the previous one. Not a budget glitch
---
Burger King foot lettuce.
---
I've been playing since yesterday, and i have to say that's a huge and a different step from previouses games, i expected much of a worse game, i'm enjoying the community a lot, every stranger is going to help you in some way, and i love that.
---
The only thing is that on ps4 pro you'll have 30 fps, and it's hurting my eyes a lot.
---
Which tier did you reach, good sir?
---
Oh, that's fair. Sorry.
---
I think this goes for both people experiencing days that are too bright and nights too dark on PC (is it only PC players?), change your gamma settings.
---
Had the same problem, I'd get lost at night or in caves pretty regularly, very very frustrating.
---
 Ran Gamma Wizard. 
---
All Fix. 
---
I can see clearly now.
---
I finally ran into this issue myself for the first time today...  
---
Since WL dropped, I'd been playing regularly.  Daily and for at least a couple hrs per session.  Recently, I took a few days off from the game.  Think my previous session was last Thursday.  Today, I logged in to check new challenges.atom shop and buy gold but Smiley told me to come back next week. Same issue for both of my characters who have reached that point of progression.  
---
Do others with this issue have an irregular play schedule with skipped days through the week?
---
why did they bring back the stars bundle but not the backpack?
---
I guess if they participate in Scorched Earth they are PVE players
---
Preordered and never played another game yet lol,its so addictive,lv 471 and going..
---
anyone have an idea of what the perks are going to be?
---
Please post a screencap and blur out their name -- sounds too funny.
---
I'm a day one player and I don't own half this stuff.  I'm an every other weekend player, and hate spending money on Atoms.  So I love seeing old stuff come up, especially when it's on sale, then I can finally afford to get it.
---
I have noticed both the faction quest giver one (that one annoys me to no end, "YES I HAVE THOSE ITEMS YOU WANTED, PLEASE TAKE THEM!!") and the Whitespring vendor (although it happens at a couple of others as well). For the vendor issue, if you run at them and hit the button for vendor as soon as you get it, it will work. 
---
I have the mutations you listed and class freak 3, but I haven't noticed the INT issue. I'll have to pay closer attention to it to see.
---
&gt; Foundation makes you kill innocents for items they don't need and steal it from their corpses. 
---
Bullcrap. We are returning stuff that the raiders have stolen in the first place. Additionally, these are raiders, not some starving hobos. They have history of being violent and killing for fun. Even if they didn't steal Ward's equipment, killing them is doing the wasteland a service...
---
one time I summoned the stranger he got his ass handed to him by super mutants and went to his knees
---
Same problem over here! In addition I keep on getting thrown out of my friends world with the reason that I‘m not his friend. But I am... and I also have 1st. Some weird stuff going on.
---
Probably working on a game they care about and sometimes fix bugs for this game when the community is loud enough
---
Used to get that right after logging in almost every time.  Now maybe once every few weeks I'll see it for a few seconds.   For about the first week after I bought the game I assumed it was some weird weather condition kind of like rad storms or something since I would see it so often.
---
You can find the plans and craft it yourself. The stuff being sold on the shop is just a skin for the ones you craft
---
I use blocker AND barbarian. They work great for me.
---
I’ve had several weird bugs recently,  things like my collection becoming a Santatron,  stuck in fast travel screens, random disconnects
---
"right now" I assume
---
Sadly enough there are only 2
---
Yes, the monster mash mask stays with you forever until you log out.
---
I don't know what you are even trying to say here. If you kill other players then you are participating in a form of PvP. I'm not saying all PvP is griefing and people exploiting the game.
---
Well, in the context of Fallout, the US flag (esp. the Enclave one with the ring of stars) stands for a fascist, militarized state that experimented on its own people and helped bring about the end of the world.
---
So, yes, in the game's fiction, it would be kind of weird to swear allegiance to it.
---
Mark 111 stealth boys all day and I grab all three just so it gets done. One shot on the beast and them hide and spam stims.

The chassis is actually working lol

What investment (unless you mean time)?  Not sure if you are on console, but both Xbox and Playstation used copies are going for $9.99
---
I'm on console
---
It annoyed me that the have a cool skin for the alien blaster which is a worthless gun without AB rounds which you can’t get. Why not make it a skin for a laser pistol at least?
---
Im getting nothing like that.. PC east coast US...

Only reason I’ve suggested it is cos I’ve just tried and it’s hard yo
---
Gotta get a few more atoms and that gold plated skin is going on my handmade
---
&gt;  It should NEVER involve people who never want to be involved with it. 
---
Seriously, this is exactly why after sinking days in to Red Dead Redemption 2 single player mode, I abandoned their online mode after like a week or two after launch. How am I supposed to enjoy anything when I've got people griefing me constantly? F76 is a better community but we've still got some people being assholes for the sake of being assholes and I've not once found PVP entertaining.
---
People where upset last week about the update?
---
And yet still no orange shag carpet....
---
This is also the reason why the Settlers are less trusty and more condescending. They are BUILDING their homes and their future. They want to live in peace and never be bothered. So random strangers are potential source of troubles. They need to learn who we are, before they trust us. Especially when we come with some bizzare "I'll save you all from the Scorched Plague".
---
In contrast raiders don't need to be trusting. Every raider is armed to the teeth, so if we try anything, someone will put us down eventually. And if we kill some raiders along the way? Well, they must have a quick turnaround of gang members. Raiding is dangerous business, so they are familiar with death and recruiting new blood.
---
It's practically impossible to do anyways. My F 1st friend tried on his private server and it's just impossible to keep track of all the benches. Like you've got a whole wall of quests and it doesn't notify you about all of them.
---
Man that's killer! Please tell me you rock the pirate hat and a assaultron sword
---
Maybe the recent server problems caused items to shuffle if the game was unable to properly load you into a world because of server issues? Just thinking out loud.
---
Bloodied auto plasma is OK. It can't be suppressed though, so that means everything else auto which can be suppressed shits on it. It's competitor would be the railway rifle, but the railway rifle shits on it too.
---
People here will tell you to use the flamer mod, which pretty good but its a rifleman mod not a commando mod for some reason.
---
A mode like the old survival with no legendaries and harsher survival conditions would be amazing. It needs to be balanced in a way that makes it so there's good reason to cooperate with other players and not just shoot everyone you see
---
If you see other people you are not wanted.
---
my dicks hard for the flag backpack. i took some time off from the game so idk if its new new but its new to me.
---
Ahh sorry bud, wouldn't think that should be an issue, 
---
Don't know if tv's have gamma settings, I expect they do, but don't know where, it's normally just brightness and saturation. Changing those only make's things worse!

---
Nothing will replace Calibrated shocks for the legs, period. Having 1-2 secs faster AP recharge utterly pales in comparison to +100 carry weight. Carry weight is king in this game. Maybe if they ever allow backpacks to work with PA, but unless they do, no one is ever gonna use anything else for legs.
---
Core assembly sounds neat, but in that case you loose the benefit of the jetpack, which is a shame and again not sure if fully worth it.
---
Amazing data btw! Just sharing my own thoughts.
---
Im not a big cosmetics guy... but it is definitely a drag
---
even tho I rarely use them it was still nice to get a new mcguffin every week
---
I can't say i'm satisfied with this discount,but at least it should put this misinterpretation about 1st to rest.
---
Also Wren keeps calling us "rook". We are a wasteland killing machine, mutated more then the local fauna, and she calls us rookies? That's more condescending than anyone from the Settlers.
---
In contrast at least Ward appreciates our "guts to help"...
---
i got two in a row from techdata! idk if bos progress matters but it was pre/during belly of the beast.
---
I actually had a viking aesthetic  going before I was inspired to make this camp. I wear an imposter sheepsquatch outfit and wield a grognak axe. I'm in the market for a berserker's revolutionary sword and black powder Pistol though! If I get the weapons, I'll likely change my look to match haha
---
basically
---
&gt; which leads me to believe that not all PvPers want to fight other PvPers, and would rather an easy kill at a workshop.
---
This is exactly why they were bitching about removing the ability to have a whole team turn hostile. Nearly every time I've had someone be aggressive towards me in the past, it's been multiple people ganging up on me. Some may want genuine PVP but more often than not people want an easy kill or to just be dicks.

It wont say just "Gauss Minigun"

So its only public teams??? Awesome for someone who never plays in group. Hoorray

Daamn, thank you, i actually didnt bother checking the prices on web, stumbled upon them in vendors, but from what you are saying, every single one of them were overpriced, but i listed them for exactly the right amount, this is what that daamn was about :)

I grinded most of my fluxes, i bought them once, for 500 a pop.
---
Thank you for offering help, but im not able to communicate other than ps messages for now, so not many people wanna play with a mute :p 
---
Plus i have no problems doing all that on my own, im getting decent at it, its just ive been grinding gold for that specific jetty for weeks now, and i completely overlook the fact, that this jetpack will probably need the same ingredients, that the PA's jetpacks ive been so mindlessly putting on all my power armors... when i realized, i just gave up and started server hopping. Mind you, i was drunk yesterday, and decided to put mothman jetpack on my ultracite pa, even thou i already have an ultracite with jetpack, but it was a regular one, and drunk me decided, thats it worth wasting fluxes, just to have a different looking jetpacks on 2 ultracite pa's. Which i dont even use anymore, cause im using x01.... plus i had a terrible luck with high radiation fluids, which resulted in maybe 6 total in 2 nukes i dropped.
---
Might not be what you want to hear but try to do better damage lol.
---
The queen gives 4 treasury notes so some people just set up chain nukes and melt her for that. Her loot is usually garbage (nocturnal wooden leg says hello) so it's still worth attending.
---
2 cave base locations I have seen is,
---
1) Being upper West corner near West Virginia Wood Co. This one was smaller.
---
2) Down in the Cranberry if I remember right, someone had 1 built underneath the road. It was a pretty good size .
---
Same here lol
---
&gt;I've had more fun exploring in this game than any other fallout game tbh.
---
This is what people keep forgetting. Especially those outside of this sub who keep trying to dismiss the game as total failure. This game is the best crafted world Bethesda has ever made. Hell, I consider it the best crafted world in whole gaming. The variety, locations, environment, local stories and more... all that creates a world that is amazing and rewarding to explore. No other company has done it to the level Bethesda has done with 76.
---
I think that is the point of the post, which is 1st accounts aren’t getting exclusive deals and far and few “free” adds on a weekly basis or even every 2 weeks.  I think for me unfortunately now that you point it out many of the items are old and I bought them so they show as owned and I don’t see they are special discounts.  Good to know though as sooner or later might be a deal...
---
Still no red rocket station :/
---
I was just gonna say, the one under the interstate in the Bog seems like a great place for one.
---
And yet here we are.... Hoping for things to change.... Maybe we're the problem and need to move on... Oh well gotta do those atom challenges xD
---
There is somewhere in the south where there is a spring board already there. I think its a Blood Eagles camp now but the spring board is still there
---
May need a buddy as I dont think you can be on it and press the plunger at the same time
---
As a strictly PVE guy currently bush camping his life away in NW, do you think I WANT to be doing this? No, I just want the hellfire. I’m not happy to be here either, so just kill me when I stand up and wave when I make it to the top 3.
---
Seems odd that NW gives adventure mode XP and caps, but nothing goes the other direction. I’ve probably leveled up my adventure mode character 6 or 7 times from NW, and I’m level 376 so the XP transfer is pretty significant. 
---
I’m not saying it should be easy to attain the top award, not at all, but it should somehow be attainable in adventure mode.  Idk, 10,000 gold bullion for the hellfire skin? A series of challenges?
---
I got a junkies pin from the SBQ yesterday as well... well played ISIS.
---
Totally agree!
---
I don’t believe so because it doesn’t do that with STR which is also receiving a reduction. My base STR is 4, without Class Freak 3 it is listed as 0, and with it equipped it is listed as 3 (75% reduction down to -1). Not -3. 
---
If I take a Berry Mentats, it raises my INT score by 5 to 0. So it is definitely a negative 5.
---
It allows more players to gain access to them, and prepares then for endgame content, it also balences the immensely overpriced sales in the trade servers!
---
Not exactly the immersion I was thinking about. But turning the music to off help immerse me. Saw a YouTube video a few years ago saying to do that with Fallout 4, and now all of my Fallouts are without music. The radios are still there, just not the ambient stuff.
---
There's certain shotgun legendary prefixes/affixes that cause a damage bug that makes it do massively more damage than intended. It supposedly will be fixed with patch 20 because it's fixed on the PTS, but we'll see. This is a separate thing from the gauss VATS/charging thing.
---
That paratrooper loot bag is kinda ass. Sometimes sinking into the ground making it hard to find when loot has been dropped.
---
I agree with your post man. I was waiting for this roadmap reveal to see if I would keep playing this game or not, when I saw it was all PVE content I stopped playing and havent logged in since.
---
The whole point of Fallout 76 was to have players be the content in the game. Now its just another DLC based singleplayerish game. Faction wars, pvp, trading, base building and guild creation are the things this game should have focused on. Now we getting some shit NPC quests every few months that you only play once, waste of potential.
---
The disadvantage of camp goodies is that they often take up a lot of space and our budget/space feels very limited.
---
I wish they would come up with things like the Watermill (which is already in the store) that could be used as a generator (windmill variation or such), since it takes up a nice amount of space.
---
Personally, I don't bother with trying to do it like that. I just buy the Serums off of other players.
---
There is no way to manage the Mutations you'll lose when using Rad-Away, it appears to just be random, as far as I am aware.
---
I have given up all hope of the red tire walls/set ever coming back, and i have long abandoned hope of ever seeing the fish lamp in store again, i missed my chance on both of those that i wanted so much.
---
When you do the escort mr. messenger event, if you get crickets as the enemy, oh boy, you won't need acid for a long time.
---
Radaway removes random mutations and isn’t useful for building out your mutation list. Just buy the serums of the mutations you want.
---
So you play with no compass,  health bar etc as well as no music? No crosshair? It’s hard. Rather listen to music than free aim my bow with no cross hair ha
---
Just buy the serums of mutations you want, then you don't have to worry about random ones
---
Edit: If you're on xbox I can craft you the ones you want. I sell them for 500 caps each. Just send me a pm with your tag
---
The easiest way is to just go to peoples camp and see if they’re selling them I usually find them priced 400-659 caps if no one is selling them just server hop
---
Radaway has a chance to remove 1 random mutation. It'll be up to RNGesus which ones you keep and lose.
---
Great to have the Vault tech stairs back, I've been saving up for those, shame it's part of a bundle, but I was tempted to get the included generator skin seperately anyway so at least it was decent value.
---
I think this happens if you spawn into a cliff.
---
Can't be as there was 0 ways of even placing it! It doesn't snap to ANYTHING!
---
I had this happen since I came back about a month before Wastelanders.
---
Quick question on allies, after I finished beckets main quest he gave me dailies after that. That has stopped, have I done something wrong. Is he mad I told him he doesn't "own the bar" he's just a bum at my camp.
---
Well that certainly doesn't help save up either... but it's better than nothing!
---
They refused the request for me... Stating it was a known issue and I would have to wait for the fix...
---
Mprgaintown Airport?
---
I've given up looking at ATX data dumps because the stuff I'd want either never comes out, or comes out months later.
---
Anywhere with scorched or gouls really
---
Pitchforks, get your burning pitchforks here!
---
Hell yea thank you for posting. I'm at work now and I'm totally stoked to go home and check this out more! That "from the stars" pack looks interesting.

Yes america this Is jhon Henry eden we need to have a chat America
---
And I never did get that unstoppable monster...
---
H...h.....how?  How was that built?  That is amazing.
---
Also - what is that building material for the walls?  I cant find it anywhere
---
Is the connectivity issues they had fixed?
---
Put it to... hahahahaha... oh god that's a good one.  I expect this thread to quickly get ignored and within the next week there will be another 1k upvoted thread complaining about how 1st is a scam because they still haven't delivered discounts.
---
I put it in for scrip as my next roll was a bloodied. Yeah the rng is shocking. The grind is real
---
Anywhere with low-mid level ghouls/scorched. Morgantown airport and highschool are decent as is top of the world mid-floor as is the national Radio Astronomy Research center that's near sugar grove.
---
Appreciate the link.  I looked at it and I don't see the RNG portion of the code (Granted I have only had a few programming classes) that would indicate true randomness.  Just see listings of the possible drop perks.  And at the top, it calls out "there are bugs with this data, especially with the drop chances" - what does that even mean?    
---
I recently had a mob drop an Unyielding piece, so I stayed on that server and rolled 20 pieces of SS with the results below.  13 of the possible 18 Prefixes dropped with 2 prefixes being represented 3 times each.  I suspect this isn't statistically significant.  It did drop 2 UNY pieces, one of which was very good fortunately.

I’m on Pc also with a shotgun build. Dm your username

what about atomic store-bought garage doors? I haven't been able to repair mine or delete it since patch 19, and I had a bunch of wall art on it that I cant get rid of. I have a bunch of camp budget that I have no access to
---
Atom shop item
---
Serums. You can buy the recipes from enclave but they're  crazy expensive. You can find individual serums at player vendors for around 300 caps. Just unequip starched genes, take serums you want, re-equip SG, and you're set. You'll probably want max class freak as well since it drastically reduces negative effects.
---
I have one, it is my priced possession
---
Whitesprings.
---
I bought like 30 from a camp vendor.didnt even know you could sell them
---
A video tour would have been awesome
---
PIP* hahahaah
---
I second the motion to add screenshots
---
1,200 Atoms.
---
I really need to stop keeping my hopes up haha I'm glad new players are getting stuff they didn't have chances to get before, but they should at least do half new stuff and half old as much as they can. Coding is hard, and I would rather them work on fixing the game, but it would be nice if they thought more about the older players when they do work on the atomic shop. Then it would be new content for everyone.
---
I am level 300 something, stopped paying attention to that.  I have one character and I am on my 5 or 6th build.  That's what i do when I start  getting a little bored.  I save up a bunch of points and try something new.  I really love this game, it has it's flaws but all in all it's good.  I do wish that they would change the RNG rolls so there isn't always such a grind to get the stuff you need.  i like the idea of crafting legionaries but I don't like the RNG for crafting.  I would rather craft what I want, I don't care if I can't trade it.  I still am finding new things in the game all the time.  Sometimes I just ignore all the grinding and take a walk to see what kind of trouble I can get into.
---
What exactly am I being pedantic about buddy? 😂😂😂
---
The only person twisting anything here is you since you seem to view this as an argument.
---
I specifically stated that the BoS don’t know who the enclave are at this point in the timeline. Lol it’s like you’re trying to make it look like we disagree on this but we don’t.
---
Oh and Mariposa has zero ties to the enclave? 
---
Really...
---
Agree!
---
will do :)
---
Yea my friend loves being a sniper and if he can't 1-2 shot a player in the head with a fully charged Gauss then what's the point? He keeps trying though god bless him. I'll have to show him he can't win against me and a J2525 SMG for him to understand, but then he'll probably give up because who likes being "FORCED" into a play style let alone a mode?
---
Under the highway north of watoga is a set of tunnels that works pretty well. 
---
North of lake eloise against the cliff face is a cave with an acid node that is a decent size. 
---
West of vault 76 about halfway to marigold pavilion is a set of hills that has a decent size cave.
---
23th?😂
---
Yeah that's what caused this.
---
My problem is nobody ever shows up on xbone. Ive needed all the rare loot since day one.
---
Yep, the very first one I crafted is an 2\* AA 50 LD. It's wicked. Compared to my main AA2525 Handmade, it does double the damage even without shotgun perks.
---
This should also be resolved in Patch 20.
---
Agreed. Turning off the music was a game changer for me immersion-wise. Creeping through fort defiance late at night with just the environment noises for the first time was downright scary. And finding radios out in the wild was actually comforting instead of just cacophonous.
---
I am so tired of raider bullshit, there are other interesting factions to use, lets get some Brotherhood of Steel or Enclave, or more Responders stuff. But no its always raider trash probably because its easier to make jist take a thing make it ugly throw some random metal on it and BAMN! raider junk.
---
Did you use the Camp Budget Glitch?
---
If not, don't worry about it.
---
i was just asking
---
Don’t have exploited your camp to over the budget limit.
---
I've been on fo76 for 2 months now and all i can say about the atomic shop is : Damn those outfit are ugly! When i go on youtube to see tips and tricks i always wonder where they got their cool outfit. I should have been playing last year....
---
I personally havent used it or been a victim of it but it is something to do with the camp budget
---
I have a 30 second clip of a fair bit of the interior if you would like me to add it to the comments
---
Bloodied Plasma Flamer wrecks! Only downside is that it eats ammo like few other weapons in the game - the ammo consumption balances its power. I tend to save up cartridges I obtain for a while (until I get 10k or so) then break it out for a night of flaming plasma fun! 
---
If you've not run the burrows at full sprint with one of these in front of you, you've not lived! Also you can perk it from Rifleman or Gunslinger depending on which stock/grip you add, so there is some additional flexibility with it.
---
I can't talk for the whole subreddit. I mean I finally understood this point of 1st. Others can take all the time they need.
---
Well, used to be happy with my CAMP, now I’m going to sit in the corner by myself and hang my head in shame.
---
Yeah that would be good I do like a nosey around a camp while I visit their vendor
---
Me neither, but I felt it fit the expression because gods can be cruel.
---
I got my 60$ worth paid full price at launch, 7 days before it dropped to 40$.  Thing is this is supposed to be a mmo.  MMO's have been out for what almost 20 years now.  You'd think they'd have a plan for higher level content by now.  Or why do they time lock everything?  It's just lazy forcing us to log in every 24 hours, instead of enjoy the game the way I'd like too (in large weekend spurts)
---
I'll never agree with duping, despite various users on this sub trying to justify it. 'God rolls' are *supposed* to be incredibly rare. Instead dupers multiply them and charge real money for them.
---
Man that’s so sweet, I wish the pieces weren’t Atom Shop.
---
Lmao another "How to fix pvp" post that **doesn't** say to get rid of legendaries.
---
Please stop. Legendaries completely fucking **ruined** this game in both PVP and PVE. I'd genuinely love for the entire legendary system to get removed but now they've built the entire game around it and so have the players.
---
Nuclear winter is fun PVP with no legendary effects. Remove all the bullshit like people jumping 50 feet into the air like a spastic and spamming tesla rifles etc. and make the base game weapons/damage work like nuclear winter and suddenly you've got a much more balanced game.
---
Enclave events and from people have told me, any savage divide quest
---
Present!
---
You can on PC by editing the ini files the same way you do for Fallout 4. I have my pipboy and flashlight set to white
---
Frank the behemoth should be a named npc
---
blocker - damage mitigation is always preferable to damage resistance
---
They need to do something like the division where there is only pvp in certain areas of the map.
---
That way everyone can be happy and have the option of doing it without ever being forced into it.
---
They are and some are even super simple to make. Such as making all the under armor as outfits too. Then most the outfits don't even properly fit the female characters. 
---
As for camps how many tables, posters, and signs do I really need? 
---
No decent carpet, no decent building sets, no furniture sets, no lighting sets.
---
 They also need to lay off the yellow, orange, and blue I just want to make my camp blend together a bit it's hard to do that with random super bright colored items all over the place
---
Any event in the savage divide, its something like a 0.1% drop rate though, so prepare yourself for a long grind.
---
Wait so you only have to put 40 food in the feed things to get the max level friendly creature?? So when me and my buddy do it we don’t have to fill it up to 60 then.
---
Yea pretty annoying to see it every week now....
---
As of wastelanders, only public events in the savage divide and mr messenger.
---
What’s free this week?
---
I can only hope one day to back this happen to me. I can imagine it was pretty awesome seeing your own shop being praised. =P
---
Some of us spend so much time on building, it always feels good to get a thumbs up when  someone likes all your hard work. Am I right?
---
They’d probably have to make 40mm grenades do some damage first.
---
It's called "bad writing." I don't know who was behind the creation of the factions and their quests, but they clearly far prefer the raider aesthetic and didn't much give a shit that raiders, you know, murder people and steal from them. So the raiders in 76 have been, aside from the decor around Crater, "raider lite." Especially when compared to raider groups from Fallout 4.
---
Enclave events don't drop them anymore...haven't for over a year now.
---
You haven’t even been able to dupe weapons/armor for over a year and if you actually look at the real money sites , it’s not many god rolls on there . 98% of the items on there are average items .
---
Also I’d be more ok spending 15$ on the weapon I want and skip the rng than spending 20$ on a pa skin
---
As I mentioned in the post, I’m not gonna try and justify what Bethesda did at launch. They released a half-baked product and they deserve every single bit of negative press they got.
---
I went into this game thinking I was going to play an online survival sandbox with RPG elements. Going into this game with that mindset, I wasn’t disappointed in the slightest. Although I totally understand if you were, given that your impression of what it was supposed to be was completely different.
---
Can they build my camp too?! Lol. I love it!
---
Didn't they have actual sliders for R / B / G under options in FO4? It's been a few years, can't remember.
---
Time investment.
---
I ve been farming flux for few weeks now bcz I have nothing else to do in this game. So the probability to get hi-rad fluid is equal among all creatures u kill. Sometimes I get 25 hi-rad fluid for a ride and sometimes 2 at the same zone. The lowest number ever was when I nuked the university area and during 5-7 rides I got only 3 of them.  And it was a private server. Hands down...
---
p.s.: in whitespring area u have like 30-40 posibilites to loot a hi-rad fluid for a ride and they are very close to each other. It depends on how someone nukes this area.
---
Makes sense now why my Raider rep is progressing faster than my Settler rep.
---
I knew it was low but I just wanted to know where to focus my efforts
---
I just want a cat backpack!
---
Looks like my atoms are safe this week. Thanks for the update!

---
I've actually slowed down spending (not that it was significant to begin with) because of the changes coming with Seasons.  Bethesda said that the daily/weekly events will go away and that the number of atoms you can earn for free will be less than what currently happens.  I'd link an article on it but I'm at work and gaming websites are blocked.
---
Edit:  forgot words.
---
I expected survival to be pretty realistic but instead I got a guy destroying me with a Two shot Laser rifle. In my opinion, I believed survival should be survival characters only, no legendaries, and fast travel sanctuaries. I say this because then it pretty much stays balanced. A new player would actually have a chance at killing someone with some luck on their side. Then also when you die, you lose some of the gear you had on you. Just with this, this can attract players from other games that are more survival players.
---
It would tank the games economy though as people won’t care about trading. I at least think that’s Bethesda’s logic
---
Also I apologize for staying in that last room a little long, I was just completely taken away by how well decorated everything was
---
Cannibal gang indeed. I live 10 meters from a npc spawn and a big settlement with killable settlers, so i have easy fresh meat really close to my house
---
Did you drop it or place it?
---
Still the pride stuff.
---
Oh you're addressing me? Sorry, your authority isn't recognized in fort kickass
---
Start with assumptions:
---
1.  You can see the quest in the Data section and it tells you get the weapons cache, free settler, something, but you can’t do the auto view to see it?
---
Assuming that I usually scan the map when that happens as the location normally shows up on the map with a small circle/shaded area.  Then I go there kill stuff and do what it says and report back.
---
2.  If you don’t have a quest and she will not give you one now, then store or destroy her ally thing and then put down a new one.  I can take a day to reset, but I have had it then show the markers?
---
Glitchy and am sure others have figured out other solutions
---
If all the other effects are like what you're showing, those are actually decent prices too. Much better than 4995 caps for a scrip fodder raider arm that you generally come across
---
Imagine them putting something worth buying in the shop lmao
---
I dont think i dropped it. I didnt even know you could drop it. It had the blue camo on so it wouldve been destroyed. But i know i didnt destroy it.
---
Was that the free radial face mask on one of the weapon racks?.
---
I am so glad you took the video it's a nice camp👍♥️🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
---
Thanks for sharing
---
I mean is it really a big deal for tent campers?? I see them pretty frequently and 9/10 we still manage to finish the event. Maybe it takes a little longer, but I’ve never noticed that big of a difference.
---
If you ever run across The_Dude2k, I'd appreciate the opportunity to buy em from ya.
---
Fair point. I feel like the pvp servers if made would probably die out in a few months though.
---
Well you are hosed then.  A quick Google search turned up "unequip all armor and clothing, log out and back in and re-equip".  Interested to see if that works for you.
---
I've only tried PvP a couple of times - claimed a workshop or two.
---
It seems like when I die (killed by another player) that I lose all my caps.   is that true?
---
I might have imagined that, but it wasn't really clear.   What do you "lose" when you are killed by another player?  Do you just drop all your Junk that you have on you (which they can claim?) or do they get all your caps too?
---
they need to make the messenger quest better
---
It's too long and he often gets stuck for several minutes at a time. It's very rare you see people doing it and when you do it's usually someone who doesn't know better.
---
Got mine on Uranium fever and have done it hundreds of times before so I was shocked.  Get all the jumpsuits as well.
---
Then from what people told me savage divide events. But its prolly a less then 1 percent drop at this point
---
weird thing is they don't sell for much. Despite being ludicrously hard to obtain.
---
When enough people with vision issues (like certain forms of color blindness) make a big enough stink about it.
---
If that doesn't happen, just keep an eye out in the atom shop.  I'm sure they'll sell you a new color for 1400 atoms.
---
A frisky one.
---
I can’t stand NW. But those rewards. Actually they’re not enough anymore for me to do NW. I haven’t played in a about a week, mostly because I’m bored. 
---
The things I haven’t done for the PSN trophies is ally with foundation and revive 20 player. The first, the grind has gotten beyond tedious. The second, is probably harder to do because I’d actually have to encounter (and play with) others. A little interaction is fine, but most people play with their mics off and emote communication is lame and pointless.
---
First play through I switched my appearance to female so my character didn't bother my buddy I play with so much while I was wearing the garb of mysteries. Second go around I just ran around in the thing with shaved head and tattoos. F it
---
Have an honest thought about it, I don't use Barbarian anymore because there is no enemy in the game that can diminish my health fast enough that a regular super stimpak can't keep me topped up. 
---
Dodgy also contributes a lot to that too.
---
I have about 375 damage resistance, 500 energy resistance + 150 radiation resistance without any buffs.
---
The only thing I currently can't tank is a full energy blast from the Sheep squash imposter, if I have a Nuka quantum and super stimpak going I can.
---
Deathclaw?
---
I found this, hope it's helpful.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deathclaw](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deathclaw)
---
Well, MY Dad can beat up YOUR Dad, so nyah nyah nyah.  
---
Seriously, though, I just block that shit and/or report as harassment. Enough bans and it starts costing the little shit and/or their parent(s) money. At the very least, a Comm Ban is annoying enough and the little shit can rage and seethe and die mad about it.
---
The proper thing to do would be to stop selling it in the atom shop until it's fixed! Wtf. If this was passed along to the devs 6 days ago by the CM, why did I waste my money on it yesterday?
---
They are exceedingly rare. Although, it is possible to have the masks, plus a number of rare outfits all drop at a single event.
---
I got a mask a long, long time ago &amp; have traded for a lot more since then. I think I'm up to 7 Forest &amp; 7 Urban masks - got them all on display, with one each I use personally.
---
Me too, I find it much better for ghouls and stuff that gets all up in your face.
---
Kantusa is correct but I just want to clarify because it is a common mistake. 
---
You must learn to make the jet pack on the respective PA. The atom shop store item is only a skin, it doesn't unlock the ability to craft one, just change it's appearance.
---
&gt;  I'd link an article on it but I'm at work and gaming websites are blocked. 
---
Damn the man!
---
My first week playing beta I had a super exciting pvp moment where it was me with my tiny base and three turrets vs three other players. It was a constant back and forth, with me eventually being the victor just as I ran out of junk to repair my base with.
---
If that kind of interaction were typical for this game I would absolutely be fine with forced pvp. As it stands, my only other moments have been getting two shot when I’m not paying attention or looking at my map just after claiming a workshop. I hate it - it is not fun. 
---
I’m too casual to care about pvp at this stage in my life.
---
Edit: It’s the overpowered stuff that makes me dislike it. Sure I could go around and 1-2 shot people myself, but I’m more interested in helping the community instead of being an asshat who thinks “tHe GaMe LeTs Me sO i dO”.
---
NEW STARFIELD LEAK !?!?
---
I got to admit that survival mode was the most fun i had on the game and i miss it a little
---
"My dad works at Nintendo" xD
---
That's actually really cool. I love seeing what people come up with.
---
Look to see if you have the pieces in storage, sometimes on other bugs they will come off the frame.  So you then have to collect them and throw them on a spare frame or go find one quick and do that.
---
I lost a frame once but the pieces went into my bags.
---
You’re claiming that Foundation wants us to kill “innocents” but yet the raiders stole their items in the first place making them thieves and no longer innocent. Now comes the issue of “Appalachian Justice” whether or not they deserve to die for taking an item from Foundation. We could get into morality of the death penalty in a post apocalyptic setting but honestly I don’t want to. 
---
You can hear the Raiders at Crater saying lines like “I told those scavengers to hand it over, they didn’t listen” and “I hate it when things get messy” indicating that they, like normal raiders, are privy to robbery and brutal murder. 
---
I mainly wanted to point out that you are wrong in saying Foundation wants us to kill “innocents.” The raiders of Crater are very much Raiders^TM and working for them makes you tangentially responsible for aiding their crimes, aka a raider.
---
Nice. Im praying i get a forest one at some point. I have the urban. Trying to buy one on the other sub is impossible so hopefully my luck will come again soon.
---
The underarmor with the tanktop has been a point of bundle contention for me too.  I really don't want anything else in it, but the price is bloated because it's always in a bundle.
---
Line in the sand I get the same 1-2.  I did Morgan Airport and none, but assume with so many you will get some.  I did that food event and got 1 off a ghoul last night.
---
Well it did make u/snodgee 's dick hard, so....
---
Well, the good news there is you can give it a try cheaply and if you don't enjoy it, you will figure it out before you sink too much of your time in to it.
---
It took me a while to adjust to the online style.  I LOVED Fallout 4 and New Vegas and 76 is definitely a somewhat different animal.  It has been said here many times, but the early levels you go through can be a tough play.  You are always short on ammo, food and basic building supplies... but once you level up some, I found it just as fun as the other Fallout games I loved.  Hope that helps.
---
It can be difficult. Been in game since BETA, so I've had plenty of time to collect.
---
It isnt in there. Ive checked 3 times now. It would father winter helmet and blue camo with the atom symbol its not there
---
Single foundation floaty house 4TW.
---
It was available separately in the past.
---
I saw a Furious Black Powder Rifle in a vending machine recently. Should have taken a picture because I'm not sure if that's a legit drop or not. Regardless, it made me chuckle and I moved on.
---
Yes! Somehow, someone’s composed old time music from the future.
---
I'll keep my eyes open.  Thanks for the advice!
---
Ahhhhhh, thank you! That clears up why I haven't seen that sign again. Had a discussion on another thread, thought I was going crazy!
---
It’s probably because way back in the day they used to be pretty cheap as you could just buy them from vendors
---
Oh well, it sounded cool. Is your gamertag the same as your reddit name? If it is, I think I've played with you before.
---
Ironically, that's exactly the solution that led me to discover it was the perk causing the issue. 
---
Stark Naked, No Perks equipped, base INT 6: INT 2 (-4 for Marsupial)
---
Stark Naked, Class Freak 3 equipped, base INT 6: INT -5
---
It should be a 5. 
---
Which makes me think a -1 is being applied somewhere in the math that shouldn't be. (sigh)
---
Just tried it, you can't
---
I mean... they can’t kill u if u one shot them...
---
They must Watoga city workers informing you of a violation of code. You didn’t fill out form WF-23091-a and get it signed by the current mayor of Watoga prior to moving your tent!
---
That's a great question as I was thinking of getting one. What does it actually look like and how big is it?
---
I can. calliope_sky
---
Im on right now.
---
Happened to me today during Encryptid. We’d already lost though because no one wanted to be the goddamn conduits.
---
Unfortunately, you can't. :( Won't go into any displays.
---
Thanks bro.👌I can’t wait until patch 20 comes out!
---
The chest definitely does still talk; I'm using it with some Bone Raider PA pieces and Liberty Prime is still talking smack, lol.
---
It depends which junk type you’re starved from but more targeted farming would help, picking up everything in certain areas will leave you with loads of steel and not many screws for example. For stims id recommend picking up the Pharma Farma perk that lets you get extra chems and aid in containers, you’ll get loads of stims then!
---
There goes my Mr Freeze outfit out the window. Thanks anyway
---
Ends up you can’t display it but from inspecting at it through junk it’s huge
---
A mask neither
---
Yeah it is there I bet.  I craft, then switch to modify and search down the list to find it by first perk.  Could be Furious, instigating, two shot, anti-armor, suppression, etc..  then I do the next one after it is a 1 star and search...  depressing process with normal luck
---
You're 'ok paying a duper $15 for a weapon'. Wow ok. You do you. I'm not doing that.
---
Anyway as I was saying, duping has been a plague on so many things in this game. Crashing servers and making people lose progress and generally a much worse experience trying to play. Handing out so many TSE handmades that they had to be nerfed. Explosive energy weapons wouldn't have been such an issue if only a handful of players had them either.
---
Next thing is somebody will say it's Bethesda's fault. *"Yeah but it wouldn't happen if Bethesda..."* That's the usual thing on this sub. Starting go think I'm the only one not exploiting.
---
Edit: oh and the duping of gifts. Forgot to mention that. No wonder the plans had a shite drop %. Probably trying to flush them out.
---
Aww man thanks anyways tho
---
Yeah that seems to be happening now, I hope they don’t fix this one. Some pretty cool looking combos.
---
No reason it wouldnt be
---
I reckon there's less of them than fasnacht rare masks. And they go for 30k+ still
---
 I'll agree that anyone who charges real money for it deserves a ban, but  I've met so many generous ones who just give them away because they're  tired of seeing players give up almost their entire inventory just to  get one gun!
---
Not the KING, off with his head!!!
---
I made 18 SS Rt legs yesterday, I received 3 - 3\*'s, no UNY or Bolstering. Primarily get Assassins, Weightless and Chameleon.
---
to be more mathematical. The soft cap on dr effectiveness is ~2.5 times the amount of base damage things are doing to you after all forms of hard% reduction. The single largest hit in this game is the scorchbeast queen's melee swipe at 220, meaning around 550 dr is the point where dr stops being effective on the single strongest hit in the game without taking other sources of damage reduction into account. A level 91 deathclaw's heavy melee does 175, so you need only about 450 to reach the soft cap on most other big hitters.
---
If you use blocker two for 30% less damage from melee hits, you drop the damage the queen does down to 154, meaning ~375 armor hits that cap. Hard% reductions magnify the effectiveness of your damage reduction, making them so much stronger than additional dr that it is difficult to calculate.
---
Lets say you have 220 armor, that by itself reduces the damage the queen does by half (dr=dmg=50%mitigation). Meaning you take 110
---
If you have the choice to double your armor, or half the queen's damage it breaksdown as follows
---
440dr reduces the queens 220 damage by 61% dealing 85.8 damage
---
the 50% reduction applies first, cutting 220 damage to 100. 220 dr then reduces 110 damage by the same 61%, dealing 42.9
---
Reducing the enemy damage has the effect of also multiplying your effective armor, reducing the damage enemies deal even further.
---
If you take a full set of 75% damage reduction from a specific enemy set you can exceed the damage resistance soft cap with like 40 dr.
---
The only sticking point is that enemies who ignore armor are pita, but you can only use % reductions on them so dr arguments don't matter.
---
Welcome
---
Not true actually. I server hop a lot and my camp is right near there. On one rare occasion I saw him as a 3 star lol
---
Do NOT try farming them. I spent 2 weeks when the game came out.
---
What scrap do you need?  I can probably help you out a little.  The\_Grimbot on PS4
---
Farming Morgantown HS is great for plastic.
---
I think this is something that needs to happen. They could just make all the existing weapon plans available as “Gold” plans, sold by The Overseer or Mumbles, bought with Gold Bullion. I wouldn’t even care if the best ones were 5k. There wouldn’t be much point in armor plans as the existing GB armor plans outclass everything else entirely. 
---
Any items crafted with these plans could be marked as “Gold” and not tradeable, while normal drops still could be traded.
---
I totally agree. That's ridiculous. I am also grumbling because I REALLY want that wiffle bat skin but I don't have a melee build. Perhaps it's time to make a new character.
---
Liberty prime is back!!!! YESSS
---
I don't really know what it would improve making them non tradeable. Rng is meant to be the way it is to force people to spend more time grinding. Without all the duping all the god roll weapons would be pretty rare and incredibly valuable which would make them even harder to obtain than they already are for newer people. Non-tradeable crafted weapons have the same effect for people that don't grind a lot.
---
It just goes to show that the majority of people playing this game for PVP only do so because they can't hack it in a game based around skill. Anyone with good aim and movement can take out some explosive round bloodied build with a pipe pistol. And you should.
---
Has the satelite dish ever been sold outside the space invader bundle?
---
You really gonna' eat that whole thing?
---
The dual system works well for melee players, I can take people out in 2 to 3 swings once the dual has been initiated!
---
Oh! That's what happened!
---
I was swimming underwater in one of those submerged mines, and suddenly had contracted an illness, and I was like, "Wait... what? I'm in my Chinese Stealth Suit and Helmet!"
---
Good to know. Will chem-up before submerging again.
---
Well, furious on such a slow reloading weapon seems comically stupid so I wasn't sure.
---
I'll give you 2 caps and a hug for it
---
I’ve never spent any money on this game besides the original cost of the game but my point is that at least spending 15$ on an item is useful and the money is going to an actual person who will probably buy some weed or pizza 
---
Spending 20$ on a skin is just moronic. Not only is it useless but you’re also reinforcing bad corporate behavior that will no doubt kill single player games 
---
I stopped playing a couple weeks ago and it had nothing to do with people duping . It had everything to do with bethesda turning a great franchise into a mobile game designed to keep kids spending 10$+ a month
---
Yes, this has happened to me three times. I’m on Xbox, if that helps for information purposes.
---
Dude, me either! And, you're welcome!
---
Mainly material for crafting ammo/stims - I just picked up my first Handmade Rifle and need to need farm mods for it as well
---
Yeah my option to send them to Foundation says “to cause chaos”. Why would I send a raider to Foundation? That sounds like a terrible idea.
---
Same.
---
This exactly. Remove legendaries, that's all I wanted to play survival
---
Yup, they drop as a package.
---
Lizard. Theres a different crocodile Deathclaw variant, the Gaterclaw
---
Jackson's Chameleon:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Deathclaw
---
PvP will never be a mode worth going into as long as the ability to 1-shot people exists. The entirety of PvP needs to be reworked.
---
I love listening to the fallout world music! the pieces from far harbor can be so relaxing. And I absolutely love the title things in fallout 4. I listen to the actual music more than I listen to The fun song that they have on their radios. Fallout 76 has some really nice peaceful pieces as well.
---
Chameleon cross I believe.
---
I heard the masks no longer drop anymore, making them “ legacy’s”
---
The update to remove them from the loot pool came with wastelanders
---
oh snap, I didn't even think of lizards
---
That's awesome, I always give it away free. I keep it in the icebox in my diner, with a sign up saying help yourself.
---
Fev chameleon made by the enclave
---
Tempting I'll admit. One does not recieve enough hugs in this post apocalyptic wasteland. Maybe a hug bot will be the next to visit me instead of my dear friend insult bot who I've come to know and love.
---
Not from what I've seen. If they are, it is not noticeable and therefore pointless. Which is shame really.
---
Yes. If your junkie go junkie.
---
Try here r/fallout76settlements
---
thanks for letting me know :)
---
The old "My Friend Works At Microsoft" technique.....nice I swear it's been years since I heard a threat like that...grinding halo for a spartan helmet..lol
---
Oh the wiffle bat skin is back, my life is complete... 😏
---
Thanks for posting bud 👍🏼
---
Same I made a similar post awhile back and got told Im wrong
---
What platform are you on? Character rollbacks are highly unlikely too happen. Tech support usually just tells you they can't do anything.
---
Thanks for that I will save my tokens. I have 2 sets of the outfit already so I was gonna get it but no point now.
---
Sometimes I wish I could  just have that happen to Sofia also I wish the vats unknown was able to be above lvl 20
---
Floating is space
---
I'm on PS4 and her quest glitch out on me quite a bit. I found that going into the menu and looking at your quest logs and clicking on the quest helped clear it. It did not work every time so the other person who posted probably can help you more.
---
I'll agree with one thing: spending $20 on a PA skin is bizarre. I really can't see many players doing that. As long as we save atoms we can get the good items though. I can't name a third of the stuff I've got with free atoms. Which I suppose means I've got some right crap with it sadly.
---
1. I wasnt playing last year (even though I owned the game) so I didnt have them.
---
2. I LOVE the liberty prime skin and didnt have enough atoms last month it was there so I was very happy to buy it.
---
3. With patch 20 they are likely to release a bunch of cool cosmetics.
---
Never understood what the difference (if any) is between the Waster underarmor and the Scabber outfit (which I think is also an underarmor?)
---
I've started running the Robco research center for tons of lead.  If you wanna do it sometime I can run with you.
---
Got it!
---
Sounds good I’ll add you
---
I wish this was sold all the time in the atomic shop there’s times I don’t play 76. You can build such a good looking house with this cause of the porches it’s makes them look like actual houses.
---
Sounds like it. Math is hard.
---
It can be above 20, it scales with your level when you complete the last quest for her.
---
Any Free items?
---
Thank you!! Finally the plague of the mothman will be off my screen 😂 much appreciated
---
I'd probably want to pvp if I had the awesome graphics others do.  I put mine on max settings and everything still looks worse than GameCube resolution.  Meanwhile my friends are posting 29k res screenshots where you can see the glint in a radstag's eye at 40m.  Exaggerating slightly but I think you get the idea
---
Smf?
---
Lol that’s a bit extreme and childish and also irritating to clear out the spam messages..
---
But I do myself get a bit irritating trying to find a fresh server to load in my platform camp to do Queens. Don’t get me wrong I love using my own tent but from another post made long before, I agree camps loading in should load in removing any tents in the loading space as default.
---
I don’t blame the players however.everyone has the right to play their way
---
Oh my god I'm so pissed I wasn't in the same server as fort kickass
---
No need to remove starched genes
---
I stay subbed because the consistent issues and complaints are amusing and it serves as a reminder not to preorder and not to trust bethesda.
---
Really nice camp! How you manage to put lots and lots of things, my camp is empty compared with yours and my bucket is full
---
Look up resource guides for farming the materials you need. Then go do those as well as picking up as much junk as you can.  
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Mappalachia
---
For example I do a lead route, grabbing lead and all nearby junk. When I’m done with that I’ve usually hit the 180 junk items needed to respawn the stuff from my start.  I can then run it again. 
---
My non-Lucky Hole Mine route starts at silo Bravo gym,then to silo Alpha gym, off to the top of the monorail elevator, head to silo Charlie gym, raid the cab chimes at Camden Yard, then go to the Fire station gym. There are more lead locations, but I just do this route while taking all the junk and scrapping it , too.
---
Steel is everywhere, especially on dropped weapons. 
---
Acid I get from Tanagra Town (crickets in the cave halfway up the tree) and Toxic Larry, then server-hop and repeat. 
---
Cloth is everywhere, too.  Collect pre-war money. Pick-up all the paper trash in Camden Yard and Tyler Amusement Park.
---
 "Originally engineered before the Great War by the U.S. government as a cheap replacement for human troops during combat operations, deathclaws were derived from a mixed animal stock, primarily the popular Jackson's Chameleon. Although the project was successful in creating a ferocious predator capable of surviving on its own in the wild, no references exist of them ever being used in combat against the Chinese military. After the Great War, deathclaws escaped into the wild and quickly spread across the continent. Eventually, they were refined by the Master through genetic manipulation and the Forced Evolutionary Virus. Because initial reports were limited to a series of isolated nests, deathclaws were viewed as legendary creatures by the various inhabitants of southern California. However, the population in the Boneyard was keenly aware of their existence, as a single den mother and her offspring claimed the area between Downey and Norwalk around 2161, keeping the Gun Runners in a checkmate while terrorizing other communities in the region. Also, a single deathclaw was found living near the outskirts of the Hub.
---
Their gradual spread throughout the wasteland raised awareness of their existence until they entered common consciousness as a lethal predator. As stated above, the Enclave eventually continued the research project started before the war, developing intelligent deathclaws for use in hostile environments around 2235. On May 17, 2242, the first successful pack was dropped into Vault 13 to cloak the presence of the Enclave and their abduction of the dwellers within. Following their first combat test, the deathclaws broke free of their Enclave masters, far more intelligent than anyone could foresee. They began developing a unique culture, as the first non-human sentient beings in history. However, their intelligence was discovered by Dr. Schreber of Navarro, whose report led to the extermination of intelligent deathclaws with extreme prejudice. Subsequent experimentation involved the aforementioned domestication units, although by the end of the 23rd century."
---
But they'll get com banned, which sucks if you don't want to make another account. I once had someone spam message me over shooting his plane down with a tank in a battlefield game. Called me all sorts of names, so obviously I reported it and he got a 2 week com ban. Two weeks later I had forgotten he even existed, his ban was up and he messaged me *again* to call me names for getting him com banned, to which he presumably got it again lmao.
---
If you’ve completed the main quest line either Foundation or Crater.
---
I’ve tried playing 76 with no HUD, and for whatever reason I couldn’t get that mod to work. I do however play FO4 with no HUD every time, and it isn’t that bad.
---
I had a very close friend who had introduced me to the series through fallout 3. She died not long before fallout 4 was announced.. the first few times I played it the music brought up some raw emotions :/
---
Good one 😅
---
My normal pump action does that in vats. Doesn't have any kind of vats perks. Just executioners limb damage and 1 perception
---
I’ll take it PSN priest1503
---
I thought about using my shadow prime skin on my T65 but, damnit it took me so long to grind for it that I want everyone to know I got it!
---
I secretly think that Ward "loses" stuff on purpose so the 76'ers shake down our outright murder the Raiders.  Basically doing his dark deeds for him.  Feels more like the Dark Brotherhood style quests. Lol
---
I love PA skins in fo76. They're pretty creative and good at it. I usually only spend atoms on those and camp items
---
What is a NW laser?
---
Though they are working on interior instances in camps. This wouldn’t be much of a jump
---
Aight
---
Follow up question - how would you be able to do that on existing budget limits?  I mean, I feel so inadequate.
---
I agree that it would make sense but really doesn't seem like a big deal to me
---
Theres alot of things I would like to see fixed before something like that
---
No no, after lvl 50 you can move special points around. 1 per level
---
Oh well damn. Tyvm!!!!
---
But to get cards I'll start to need to work on pax? Right?
---
Raider lite is a good description.  I honestly think of them more as scavengers than true Raiders.
---
what influx of new players do you guys keep talking about? Player numbers have been rapidly decreasing
---
No, you can still pick a perk card every level and will get a pack every 5
---
Same pride stuff
---
Claim a bunch of workshops and defend them or re take them and you collect all kinds of stuff
---
Ah damn, I hadn't had it happen in ages then a few days into wastelanders it started happening, guess I just assumed that was when it came back
---
Have you finished the Brotherhood quest and found the Enclave?
---
The problem with PVP is the meta is so astoundingly OP that there's literally nothing that a regular player could do.
---
When some jackass is flying around, while invisible, shooting the ground with either an exploding AK or a Tesla rifle what the fuck do you do?
---
I live in my power armor and I can still be dropped in a half a second with rounds that aren't even hitting me.
---
It needs to be toned down or it needs to be separated like you mentioned.
---
Have you used them with those perks? Or know people who have used them?
---
my\_guu, lvl 50, i have a few stuff to get you started, ill be on tonight
---
Feel free to add me. I’m on often enough psn: gloryofthelost
---
You would be better with a heavy gun since heavy gun perks are strength also
---
They likely don't have much for decoration going on but knowing bethesda it very well could be another budget glitch
---
I have. I had one with fire rate and reload and compared it to a non legendary Bow and couldn't see a difference myself.
---
Bro im down whats your username
---
Thank you for posting! This one is on our radar.
---
I have not . Was not even aware this existed . You made a old man very happy now ! Need to do some research about this !
---

---
 &gt; Thank you for posting! This one is on our radar.
---
They are more for stunning and crippling than killing. Basically crowd control.
---
Excuse my ignorance, but could somebody tell me what Colas are please...
---
I'm on PlayStation. Again, this pretty much confirms it's an issue that is core to the regular and Public Event respawning clashing.
---
Good question, I was wondering the same thing.
---
I've actually seen a base like this once or twice on PS4. It was fun fighting the queen at it. I wish you hadn't scrapped yours. I would have loved to have seen how it looked.
---
Cool I’ll add you now
---
If you had a gauss minigun wielding, power armor using, chemmed up, cold hearted murderer at your command, you'd probably figure out a way to use them.
---
PvP doesn’t work with explosive legendary weapons because the stagger makes it a “I shot you now you can’t do anything but watch me shoot you more” ordeal which is un-fun
---
If you haven't found either you still have most of the end-game content ahead of you, have you completed Responders, Order of Mysteries, Raiders and Free States too or you just focused on the Wastelanders content?
---
Do you own all the new vault plans?  Have you maxed out your reputaton with the raiders and settlers?  You'll need to buy legendary modules galore in order to craft the new weapons and armor that having max rep will unlock for you. There is a lot to do yet. Also, if you do the Enclave stuff you will get to launch a nuke.  That's always fun.
---
Otherwise, I'd learn how to do the different public events (The ones with an ! on them) and go there and just help out as much as you can.  Simply assisting with the events will usually net you some loot and treasury notes.  You can never have too many of those.  Some events are pretty fun, some are boring, but all of them reward you in some way.
---
Usually when you see a camp this big,the interior is pretty much empty at best.
---
The fact this guy has everywhere well decorated,means he absolutely used the budget glitch.
---
That's too bad. Not surprised though Bethesda didnt really do a good job with these bows
---
I don’t understand how dwellers come out one year after everyone else left... it makes no sense
---
Thank you I appreciate it I didnt expect someone to reply so quickly I'll add you I'll be on later after work
---
OMG!!! You Just complained about a headache that bad 10 minutes ago! Take some freaking Mentats already!
---
I don't care how sexy that spacesuit looks... I'm moving in with Gramps, he at least has fart jokes.
---
just lock your purifiers
---
line in the sand for me.
---
Thank you I appreciate you replying so quickly I'll add you I'll be on later after work
---
i was hoping it meant instanced housing inside crater and foundation, now that would be better
---
Blood Eagles are basically Commonwealth raiders. Intending to torture and murder Beckett, burning Weasel's vocal cords, stringing up corpses, and leaving heads on pikes outside their camps.
---
It's mikeruble93 I'll be on later after work
---
Lol definitely not. If anything I own all these systems because of Final Fantasy XV. 
---
I've owned the OG since release and I bought the Pro when it came out (wanted a second console for my GF + I figured I'd get the upgrade). My girlfriend and I weren't 100% living together at the time, so she wanted her own PS4 for when she was at her parents or visiting other family or whatever. We ended up getting her the limited edition FFXV Slim. So we've had 3 Ps4s since about Nov/Dec 2016.
---
Honestly the OG sat around mostly until I picked up a cheap disc copy of 76 so I could run a second account. It certainly comes in handy having multiple consoles, as I can do tests and preform actions in this (and many other games) other players would have a much harder time accomplishing on their own.
---
Yup! Just makes it worse because it’s across platforms. It’s very annoying.
---
I haven't seen FREE next to my Atomic Shop button on the main menu for a couple of weeks now...sure enough it's some shit I already claimed like a year ago.
---
Can't stand the raiders, Responders are done . Currently Rping as one ! Free states is Abbie? Order of mysteries got bugged for me on my other character , so not too keen on starting that quest line over so soon . But makes me feel better knowing there is more , other then empty events .
---
For sure, every single room was decorated heavily.
---
It does now at least. It didn't for a few weeks when Wastelanders launched.
---
I don’t know how many gauss minis I crafted before I finally got a good roll and it’s only mostly good. Bloodied, +10% damage while aiming, +1 Agility. Would I like a better roll? Sure. But I’m not going to keep trying because I MIGHT get a better one. Especially since I’m now rolling for a decent plasma caster. First two rolls? 3* Ghoul slayers and 1* Troubleshooters... sigh... here we go again.
---
I had a guy message me similar to this after I took his workshop.  Called me all sorts of derogatory and offensive things and then made threats.  So I reported him.
---
A junkies fixer with powerful automatic receiver can do 80 base damage with 5 addictions and no other damage perks. That's 160 from sneak. Its not gonna melt things but you can take out ghouls from a distance if needed.
---
Semi-auto with hardened receiver and it will do 90 base damage or 180 from sneak but less overall dps. Since you already run the addictions, I wouldn't advise going for a different one since they won't match the output.
---
I wouldn't break the bank looking for one since you aren't perked for it, but if you can get one cheap, it would not be bad.
---
Nah.  After level 50 you choose whether you want a new card or to move a point from one SPECIAL category to another each time you level up.
---
What’s your psn anyway and al add you for whenever your able as I’m on for another few hours today
---
Ooh super mutant suiciders are soo good. Rare meat with extra crunchy brain boosting bits!
---
Oh, man. I bet that was really difficult to play at first. :(
---
Mole Miners. Nice and smoky, like they’ve been marinating in those suits,
---
seems like they need to add in a specific fallout 1st discount label. would help clear up a lot of the confusion because people aren't being directly told in the menu that it is related to fallout 1st
---
Maybe a rifle with limb damage so you can ground the scorch beasts.  Otherwise it's just more crap to carry around if you are specced into melee.
---
Insult bot is my light in the darkness.
---
Ok
---
Seems like I was a tad naive thinking I was done with most of the game already. Thanks for the tips . Used to the games holding my hand . Fo76 is my first online game , so some aspect are quite strange/new for me!
---
Yup, Free States is Abbie. You need to complete the Raiders to finish both Free States and Responders since you need to find Madigan. Order of Mysteries is pretty good too, but its up to you. The Free State questline will eventually lead you into the Brotherhood which will then lead you into the Enclave.
---
Just hit lvl 50, i was having the same issues at that point. What i recommend, drop anything unessisary to get your weight down as low as possible without you being defenseless, grab everything you can and scrap it all. Bulk scrap to save space. Drop it in your storage and repeat. If you find an area you like with a bunch of junk that you are looking for, leave the game and join another server. Should refresh all the items. \*Note\* some items have a re-spawn period, so if it's already picked up you'll either have to wait or find a new server. Hope that helps.
---
That’s a tad high in optimism if you ask me. The “We’re Sorry” Fasnacht bundle was just a bland yellow wallpaper, an out of season Valentines neon sign, and a quickly recolored blue version of the green version of the normal version of the Crazy Man Mask
---
Even melee characters need to reach out and hit an enemy from range sometimes.  The Fixer with its bonuses is as good as any if not better.   Try to find a FFR one, that is 25% better for DPS with no other perks needed.
---
If you manage to get "The best" outcome you get a lvl 45 one.
---
I was wearing my nerd rage setup with uny and had enough luck for the option to Free Athena at the end.
---
The only reason I kept her around for so long was the extra caps from Athena having her own separate pool. When they "Fixed" that the mushy stuff for old within minutes.
---
Gramps 4 life
---
Thanks for the tip but how do you get the recipe?
---
You can do interior walls kinda!
---
Just put two walls with door frames together so that the outer wall sides are facing each other. Then change the door pieces to regular walls. The wall is thicker and also takes double the budget but you can put wallpaper on both sides! 
---
I've tried it with brick walls, not sure if it works with others. But yes, interior walls without doing this would be nice!
---
I run unarmed melee, and carry an automatic handmade. I don’t have any perks for it, but I still find it really helpful. 
---
I like it for low to mid level spawns; sometimes it’s a lot easier to spray down a bunch of enemies, rather than running after them. (Like Camden Park).
---
From what I have read, the leather armor is the only one where shadowed is actually doing anything.  From a pure stealth standpoint, Heavy Leather/Shadowed would be the best that I know of.
---
They drop from Scorched and ghouls.  I’d guess a 5-10% chance?
---
I can't shake these nightmares... Floating is space forever... just... Why?.. Why honey? Why not sticks or rocks? This makes nightmares feel like fairy tales. Not that I have nightmares. Oh dear.. is that.. buzzing?
---
I always get 3-5 tickets doing radiation rumble. A lot of people on Xbox don't do the event, but if I make a post on Looking for Group, a lot of people show up to do it. That's the only place I have gotten them.
---
I've had friends say they occasionally pick them up from scorched at Top of the World, but I can't confirm this personally.
---
I’ve got over 100 unused perk points. I may try different perk allocation builds later on.
---
Ps4. Mf im so upset
---
I guess it is a "bugs bugs bugs" thing. It works just fine for me and it is the only "not power armor" set I use since I got it.
---
Mistress of Mystery questline
---
I've been waiting for these forever.
---
 The insults really hit home. Im not sure if they're random or they cater to your play style, but I enjoy leaving them as present for camps I visit lol
---
I gave you an upvote because you were definitely giving an answer to what OP was asking about. 
---
Please don’t kill the SBQ that fast with your buddies though. That’s pretty frustrating for the rest of us just trying to complete the event as mere mortals.
---
I can craft it and video it, I will say it's only done armor for me, I haven't had it happen for weapons. I can test this and post a video of it.
---
And how do you start that? (Sorry I'm just oblivious sometimes)
---
If I may ask, wny junkies melee?
---
Instigating kills everything in one hit save a few bosses and for those  bloodied with 10% missing hp does more damage than junkies.
---
Yeah, I have seen people talking about server problems loads lately, but I haven't had any trouble, except that seven hour thingy that happened a couple days ago. I'm also on PC, but I live in Brazil so I'm quite distant from the servers, so it might be an issue specific to console players?
---
Right! I want powerful stuff that is zany and kinda weird like the Wasteland.  They could take some inspiration from past games and modify some of those old perks.
---
You are surprised? Ward was former Raider...
---
Because you touch yourself at night Sofia!
---
Currently rolling for Secret Service. I usually roll a set at a time every other day or so. I’m trying to build 3 sets; Vanguard’s (main), Unyeilding/Troubleshooter’s (special occasions) and a Weightless Torso for jetpack. It would be nice to always get 3* as payback for the grind. I suppose the silver lining is that at least for the 1/2* trash you’ll always have enough daily allowance in scrip to trade it in.
---
The lever is more powerful and vastly superior in ammo cost.  Stick with it.
---
Lots of new people joined the game when wastelanders dropped, all the stuff in the atom shop is new to us.
---
Seriously, I don't even care about its functionality I just desperately want to complete my kitchen.
---
Oooh thats it im getting me banhammer!
---
Is the Alien plushie sold separately? Lol
---
Yes, because of the lack of red rocket garage, no weapon skins, etc.
---
Yep, yet another bug, maybe one day it will be fixed.
---
He's not exploiting anything, there are traps in the game and you can make trap camps. It's part of the game. One of my favorite camps was a guy who built on a cliff and when you walked to the vendor it had a spring trap underneath the floor that launched you off the cliff.
---
Is it more damage than a a receiver with a scorched damage boost offers? I think it’s like 30 or 50% more damage to scorched but 20% less to everything else?
---
I’ve been considering crafting/modifying a weapon specifically for scorched after getting my zealots Gatling gun. The flux needed for prime receivers is enough to keep me from using them for the time being.
---
I sent you a friend request
---
Yeah I doubt that... But oh... Wth...
---
Why rotate things in and out? Why not just leave them in the store? I understand having sales, but why remove it from an online listing? It's very frustrating for people who want to buy something that exists in the game, but is unavailable.
---
Get the first mutation using the trial-and-error method you described (this will at least save you the cost of one serum), then use serums for all the rest.
---
I sided with Foundation for the vault raid.  I think I am finally just a few days away from ally status with Crater.  I haven't missed a day yet either so 60 days or something like that since I finished the Wastelanders main quest on April 21st.
---
How does one acquire such a thing
---
It whould be cool to have PVP events or pvp zones like in wow (during certain time) in wich you battle the opposite faction players or conquer certain points
---
Yes extremly
---
You have to find a dead woman wearing a green and black skirt laying around in different areas.  Any one of them will get you started.  Think one is in Grafton (?) and one is definitely in the amusement park south of the Mothman Museum.
---
Of course, they are for sale in my camp :)
---
What platform are you on?
---
Was it in a cave?
---
Missed it by seconds
---
There's no guarantee the raiders are telling the truth when they explain why they need what they stole. They "need" that osmosis kit because they have sick kids, but the only kid in Crater is Ra-Ra, who could probably sleep inside the gutted corpse if a glowing ghoul and be fine.  Though it's possible they have another camp where they keep their more vulnerable.
---
The 23th of June
---
So you're the one stealing all the resets!
---
Just store your junk
---
Yeah I had read about it on here as someone got it so when it happened, sure enough I got the package.

Look for something locked, pick it, then you can destroy their base 😉
---
I did it back in December for a 2nd character and got the ol' Somerset Special.  Not sure why that would have changed?  If I remember right Dr. Hudsons quest takes place in Charleston not at the Morgantown airport.  
---
Not a very helpful response I know. Lol
---
You have a ton more content to finish. Also you can work on getting your Pioneer Scout badges.
---
Games dead, buy skyrim on ps5.
---
I’ve got a two shot explosive .50 cal and faster fire rate anti-armor lmg for when she lands. While these in the air but I need to get damage on her or she’s not landing, I run one of my Gatling guns. One is a two shot explosive, the other is a zealots with faster fire rate. 
---
The Gatling guns are nice because they allow you to continue to damage her without burning through a ton of ammo.
---
Honestly, I don’t think I’ve ever heard all of the background music for 76. I started turning the music off in 4 and New Vegas before 76 was even announced at E3, and one of the very first things I did with it was go into audio and move the music slider all the way down.
---
Ok thank you
---
+karma
---
Ohh I’ve not got one?
---
Good to know there are psychos who enjoy luring &amp; killing visitors. That's your favourite camp? How interesting.
---
Not allowing characters to go back and forth would have been a temporary fix.  In a matter or weeks, you would have high level players kitted out like Gods easily wrecking new players.
---
That's always something to keep a eye on ! If I can muster myself to start doing it again .
---
Could you try sending it again not sure why I didn’t get it the first time
---
Still no new cosmetics for fallout first. Could we at least get a new dance?
---
You literally claim one workshop to get your defenses for camp building. Then just learn to place those traps
---
Gotcha on the next one. You need junkies?
---
Damn, I didn't expect the contemporary set to come back this quickly. I started playing again the day after it left the shop and I've been kicking myself ever since, I'm glad I can grab it now.
---
Cheers,  so when you do SBQ event, do you need to shoot her while still in the air?  Sometimes I see people waiting and then other times people are just shooting her for fun while in the air lol
---
If you think making something the game encourages you to make, makes someone sick or a psycho, perhaps Hello Kitty Island Adventure is a game more your speed.
---
There was an update. They added the 4th of July stuff
---
Edit: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hehbsu/june_23th_atom_shop_update_for_those_at_work_rn?sort=top)
---
Join the event Uranium fever and try to tag-kill every Mole miner, loot them when it's over. Choose the Scrapper perk when scrapping will help, you will get close to 700 steel from weapons, ammo 5.56, shotgun shells, glowing meat, etc. There are 3 locations I go for the lead, fire station, the jail, and the hotel workout room in Summersville. I'm on a private server with close to 10K steel, 8K lead, AMCO ammo machine lol... I gots bullets, lots of bullets :)
---
You must not have searched very hard. It's the 3rd post in "Hot"
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hehbsu/june_23th_atom_shop_update_for_those_at_work_rn/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Just to make sure are you saying the atom store hasn't updated for you today?
---
60 will get you the strongest friendly mob; 40 is the level below it.  For instance, in Habitat A, 40 gets you a yao guai and 60 gets you a deathclaw.
---
Also willing to help out Sykes_Lost
---
Do a run through harpers ferry, collect all of the weapons, equip the scrapper perk, and you’ll end up with 350-450 steel. I set up my camp on the bluffs above the bridge leading into it and do this 2-3 times a day to keep my heavy weapons full of ammo. 
---
There’s also a chance that 1-2 legendaries will spawn there, which is always a treat.
---
bla bla bla
---
A big iron on his hip.
---
They did.
---
It seems to be a limitation of the game engine, but in FO76 when you change the pipboy screen color (PC ini) it changes the color and flashlight color for ALL players (from *your* perspective). So if I wanted blue text and blue light and make the ini changes to do this, suddenly all other players have blue pipboy lights too. (I confirmed this during a nighttime fasnacht.)
---
Apparently the game engine doesn't let them separate color settings for different players, and so Beth just never bothered implemented the setting in the first place.  
---
Obviously this wasn't an issue in FO4, because there were no other players/NPCs with pipboy lights.
---
Must be using a pre Wastelanders map
---
The used explosive bait. It's an exploit, not intended. Hopefully it gets patched soon.
---
nah. they are raiders. Psychos are from borderlands
---
I camp east of Franks pond. He was three star yesterday. First time in a long time. 
---
I think we ran into each other on pc. You have the sheepsqatch gear on, I had the black rider power armor with a red rocket jet pack. You said something about going to have tea later... Can’t be to many other people doing this.
---
Strange. I searched atomic shop, atom, atom shop and update. Nothing.
---
Store your junk and nuke their base.
---
Yeah, they've made it, but it's sitting unused on your hard drive taking up 3 GB of space
---
I've been. I don't waste my money. 
---
Fallout 76 cost me $12.
---
imagine if it was called the pop boy
---
would we even care
---
Looking for rifle junkies
---
that's right and the suppressor on the gun so you never break the sneak mode.
---
I have Faster Fire Rate on a Black Powder Rifle. Useless.
---
Not at first. I quit the game twice and when I reloaded the third time, boom, it was there.
---
What do the abbreviations SBQ &amp; SMF mean?
---
Ah damn. I’m heading out to the family vacation home for all of next week where we get 1.5mbps down on a good day. I’ll be downloading that update until the vacation is over.
---
#3 just blows me mind how the fuck is that even a good idea.
---
Oh boo fucking hoo. If people were “exPLoItInG” to kill others with traps in their camps, then you wouldn’t have a tab in the build menu that’s labeled “TURRETS &amp; **TRAPS**”, Y’know?
---
Also, can we make a drinking game where we have to take a shot every time someone breaks rule 9 on this sub?
---
I didnt meen to make it so big my god
---
I don’t like bloodied low HP build, too much management involved in it. Junkies is much more durable and can work in more situations than bloodied and I still one shot almost everything with junkies. I do keep instigating weapons on me though as backups.
---
I wanted to make my own build that takes inspiration from others. I’m trying to go for high dps/high sustainability, and I use VATS to keep my AP up and get crits with. I made this on nukesdragons if you wanna give it a look and tell me what you think could be improved

I don’t know why but I totally get a fallout new Vegas vibe from that picture lol the good ol Mojave wastes
---
What system are you on. If it’s ps4, you should check out my camp
---
100% this needs to be properly communicated. The core of literally every stupid controversy in this game is 100% of them doing things silently and not telling people.
---
Doesn’t the voice come from the chest piece? I used the Liberty prime skin on a set of power armor after the silent helmet was released and used the silent helmet (yes I made sure). And it was still talking loud and clear, then I remembered someone a while back mentioning the torso piece is where the voice is actually coming from.
---
Grats on the first I’m sure of many more nukes to be launched! The solo life can be hard at times but makes the completion its own victory.
---
Three star glowing at level 95. Yeah, I killed frank. Got a damned good drop from him. I’ll probably play with it for a bit then put it up for sale. TSE-25vats pump shotgun. I’m a heavy gunner/ melee build
---
They’re outside of the rusty pick.
---
Well the Crater and Foundation are on there, eh I dunno. Maybe I’ll just look for a listing of the cult locations.
---
Ahh damn... thanks!
---
You’re not the only one LoL
---
What about a J50L15R mini gun? Only 8.5k for you brother
---
No we shall be forever mothman robotics Todd wants it this way
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cr- wait, wrong game.
---
It's okay, he's a fascist BoS bootlicker. Probably shoves Water Cooled Bonesaw up his ass after killing for it.
---
What kind of fucked up logic is saying that retrieving stolen item from people who often say how much they enjoy stealing from or murdering Settlers considered bad/unjust.
---
Ah, I am on PC so I can't help. I hope you get it back but it's unlikely Bethesda will do anything.
---
Lol I wish. I got a troubleshooters rolling pin Lmfao
---
That actually worked, cleared the club house and cottages with the frogs, rad roaches etc and ran the silo and the glowing dudes were waiting for me.
---
Thanks very much for the advice 👍
---
That is what I do. Switch to heavy weapons loadout for SBQ.
---
Those are my favourite but also very scary. I miss nukaworld
---
I mean, I carry around a bat so I don't waste ammo on really weak mobs. You could perhaps do something similar?
---
this week is lackluster but it have some interesting thing for builders like the mosaic titles and the free states vending machine wich is the only thing i liked from that bundle xd.. now i want stand-alone smoke machines! i don't want to buy the mothman bundle for that
---
And that was correct, with a good clean out before I ran the nuke the glowing ones spawned as I had hoped.
---
Cool beans man! 😊
---
Sounds better
---
Oh my god I would die if thay happened!
---
Sound about right though. I get some weird things that make me think, why in the hell would this be made??
---
There are 2 main quests.  WL added the gold bullion part.
---
The original main quest was to launch a nuke and kill the queen.
---
If you haven’t gotten than far, then you have at least 7 other big quests to do.
---
In no particular order: Mysteries, firebreathers, Rose, Responders, the overseers original quest, enclave, pioneer scouts, Free States.
---
And a bunch of side quests to go along with those.
---
I agree I have been saving up my atoms to 3500 because there is nothing good to buy I just bought the American flag bundle today because I have wanted a flag like that forever
---
I’d expect more stuff once the patch drops, I’ve heard next week on the 30th from YouTube. Also some of the other items data mined seemed to fit more with a second 4th of July wave.
---
I'm pretty sure there hasn't been any servers problems since moving the map from my carry inventory.
---
Glad to help. Have fun and good luck with the drops.
---
ey but it's 4th of july theme!
---
*laughs from south america
---
Both were ingame locations prior to wastelanders
---
Well you clearly haven't had 50 nocturnal black powder rifles shoved up where the sun don't shine.....
---
Ty for the offer but not a fan of heavy weapons
---
Where they've always been
---
Oh shit. Imagine a friendly behemoth that roams appalachia with graham
---
This update will bring us up until the actual 4th of july, so I imagine we'll get more 4th stuff then. I really want the flowers bundle with the carnivorous plant and little succulents :(
---
Ty
---
There's a perception dialogue check where Wren will confirm she puts on alot of bullshit bravado to keep from getting pushed around. She was born into a tribe that grows mostly by absorbing smaller raider groups and has a role where it is critical people respect her authority.
---
That said, the funniest thing in Crater is everyone talking shit about Barb behind her back. Foundation definitely has more of a culture of being straight with you.
---
man that's ugly imo, i bought the arktos one once bc it was less boring xd
---
If I could change ONLY ONE THING in FO76, it would be that line... on top of repeating it constantly, it doesn't even make any sense.
---
A few times recently she hasn’t landed, so it all had to be done while she was flying. I think it has something to do with the fallout 1st tent placements that people put there to stand on. 
---
Alternatively, if I show up a bit late and need to make sure I get my damage in, I’ll shoot at her whether on the ground or in the air haha.
---
Wow.. I guess all the Franks that I've encountered haven't achieved that level of Behemoth to gain legendary status. Poor guy, he'll get there one of these days
---
Hahaha yeah, I meant we paid MORE on top but I get what you're saying :)
---
Most players rn are probably new.
---
Ooooh I see, well perhaps it’s outdated then.
---
I'd agree with you if they didn't lace their mirelurk meat with addictive chems.
---
No, no. Say it. Say it.
---
Similar position.  I have something like 44. I Did break down and move a point a couple days ago.  Will see how it works out.
---
OTOH, given the way the legendary system seem like it will work, we’ll both be in good shape for that :)
---
God bless!!!!!
---
Well, only nuking the Queen will yield a “reward” for completing the Scorched Earth event.
---
If you’re looking just for mobs and flux, nuke Whitesprings or Harpers Ferry.
---
I never tried before last week. I just on some Wiki site that it was useful for causing Scorchbeasts (not necessarily the Queen) to land.
---
Would be nice. I'm probably going to finally pick up the Prime Bundle thought, I have the Atoms to spare lol.
---
Oh wow that would be amazing! I wish Gail was a behemoth, that would make the whole Ra-Ra/Gail interaction 10× better. 
---
But better yet, one you can ride and control to do your bidding
---
We can only hope.
---
Meh it is free and never that great
---
In light of your friendship with frank, if you use shotguns I’ll give you first choice at trading for the pump shotgun that he dropped. Might have even been a gift for you in the first place.
---
One's an underarmour, and the other's an outfit.
---
If they look identical, it's so you can wear the outfit over armour, if you'd prefer that look.
---
Now I have to go read about the new system.
---
In my experience, it's probably a door if you've got one attached. I tested it with blueprints and a basic house( 2x2 foundations, roofs, door frame and door) and I could place the one without the door consistently, but the one with the door always gave me problems. Same way with the log cabins and seedy sheds.
---
( ಠ ͜ʖಠ)
---
Haha if they accepted .esp bug fixes from us, this game would be running like clockwork. Try again Smooth brain
---
I don't like neither of them lol
---
People still try to play the "My friend/family member/dog works for Microsoft" card? What year is this.
---
There’s still another shop update before the 4th, so I’m guessing that this week was just so the new players can get last years stuff, and next week will be new items.
---
It prolly is but hey it's always alittle exciting to see the empty northman icon pop up and know you have somewhere new to explore
---
Well be warned that the vertibot power armor is coming soon.  It’s literally the reason I’m holding off on that Prime bundle.
---
That's... not the main quest.
---
Plus the fact that Scorched Earth is also the final quest of the original story.
---
Will nuking Harpers Ferry also nuke the Burrows?  That's a great mid-level XP farm anyway.
---
PvP with normal characters is just not workable anymore. The amount of time and effort ($$$) it would take Bethesda to actually balance characters so you can have fun PvP and also be able to play the endgame PvE elements is just not gonna happen. There are too many moving parts at all times and the game development has been so far behind since launch that there's no way anyone can reasonably expect Bethesda to catch up on balancing everything for PvP and at the same time put out enough PvE content to keep the game afloat since that's where the revenue is coming from. Even simple things like a Nuka nerf probably isn't worth their time. Especially if there's a chance of screwing something up for the PvE players.
---
***The PvP servers are NW***.  It is what it is. I play a fair few battle royale games and NW is a mediocre at best battle royale that could be good if Bethesda does the bare minimum industry standard and steals a few ideas. They could steal any number of game modes or features from Apex, Fortnite, Warzone, PUBG, Hunt:Showdown etc. But they haven't for some reason. ***If players want a game mode where there's some decent PvP action they need to ask for more NW updates*****.** Because NW is a metric fuckton closer to being a fun and functional PvP game mode than whatever happens at workshops these days. 
---
If there is one thing that this game has taught me about Bethesda it is that they over value their own ideas. Their idea for PvP in this game was trash. Flat out. Setting aside every other issue, just the inclusion of VATS for a PvP experience is the worst and most game-killing idea I've ever heard. No chance they were going to build a large online streaming audience like they wanted including something like VATS. 
---
On top of that they violated the most basic tenet of modern competitive online gaming; the FIFA issue: any game that can be monetized by outside sources using nefarious methods--will be. So they release a game knowing full well that people will be able to do some seriously game breaking things like duping and suddenly the whole PvP community gets held hostage by outside sources using real money to turn PvP into a pay to win experience by selling all the top tier weapons and armor on Ebay for real money.
---
Take it and leave
---
I do not use shotguns, I'm a heavy gun build with a little melee build. I appreciate your kindness though! 
---
Use it well!
---
I could be mistaken but isn't Wren a teenager or very early 20s at most?
---
The Ghoul’s will be glowing, but they don’t drop flux ingredients.
---
I’m intrigued. If I know a weapon or armor plan, why not let legendary modules be used to awesome them up?
---
It explicitly says waterborne in the description (at least it did when it was new, and I don't think it has been changed yet). I fell for that in the past, got a disease. It only works once you wear the whole suit.
---
EDIT: it still says waterborne in OP's screenshot
---
There will come a time in a Melee’s life where a ballistic or energy weapon (or two) comes in handy.
---
I run mainly with a vampire switchblade, but there are times when one of my ballistic or energy weapons comes in handy.  For example, a Fixer is good for sniping turrets.
---
Report him. Xbox is really strict on that sort of stuff
---
If your not weponized for it you will have fun but not know whats really going on if i were you i would join other people doing it first
---
Interesting. I just finished a through test of both marine and stealth suits that Im currently uploading. With both stealth pieces, it didnt even show up that it was preventing disease even though it was. Swam around underwater for like 2-3min until I gave up and figured it worked. But with just the stealth helmet and my tighty whites I got a parasite in no time flat. Both marine pieces worked perfectly at preventing disease each piece seperate and combined.
---
We can't change the .esm or .exe
---
Which is where the problem lies
---
You can use shotguns to stack the poison damage. Each pellet does 100 poison damage in 3-5 seconds.
---
&gt; Oh hi, it’s me, the wood guy!

---
Nope.
---
No no no i dont need people sitting there doing nothing getting the same shit i am NO!
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
Yeah I saw that its not worth having if it’s not an explosive gatling plasma (legacy) version but I just wanted to see the difference for myself. Also it’s a great gun for events where you just want to damage a lot of enemies and other players will finish them off just to get the experience (line in the sand, scorched earth, etc.). Also plasma cores are relatively easy to craft.
---
SBQ means Scorchbeast Queen, no idea about SMF, srry

Does anyone even use the Single Action Revolver?
---
Yeah, that's how they work. The **/hour is spread across each type of purifier. I'm assuming it's like that so you can't have a ridiculous sized water farm.

The obvious response, why participate when you get shared loot?

Those returned back around February 18th. If you missed the chance to buy them, who knows when or IF they will come back, as it was literally over a year between their first release in December 2018 til their second in February 2020. Fortunately, I bought them 5 months ago 👍

Only thing I got was the floor tiles

Hello Im a level 83 W.I.P tank build username RamirezDovahkiin
---
next time dont sleep on the bundle when its first released..
---
I also find the line "Floating in space" annoying. But, I get a different "bug" with Sofia, sometimes when I fast travel back to my camp I find her in her underwear on the couch.  The line she says often when it happens is "I was just thinking about you my friend".
---
It seems the bug can be triggered by equipping her with a hat, glasses and a outfit. Next, it seems to happen for me by removing something from my stash later under apparel.
---
If you have the max level Sneak perk card on only 1 piece of HTD armor works, according to a Dev AMA it does not currently stack. AP Refresh has diminishing returns after 3 pieces depend on perk cards also (Rejuvenated, Lone Wanderer,...)
---
They are two separate tasks - you can launch a nuke on any location, and you can get credit for scorched earth by being present (and alive) at the end of someone else’s fight.
---
I had both quests active, and engagd in more than one SBQ fight long before I launched.  
---
Still got credit for doing both.
---
Check out the interactive FO76 map, you can click on all the deposits and look around where you thought it was, if you fast travel a little around the areas you think it is, you should eventually recognise it :)
---
I'm saving this quest for as long as I can.  The way I see it is that this area is a nice source of steel,  aluminium,  lead and xp. Once they're all nice to you it's no longer fun.  😁
---
If you have yet to do the event to complete the main mission, do it. Otherwise no it isn't worth it. If you've got a private server, nuking whitesprings gives you so much more loot, xp, and stuff to craft/sell.   
---
I do a solo whitesprings nuke run at least once a week and I level up multiple times, get a couple dozen legendary items at least, and can make enough ultracite ammo to last me a good long while, while having more than enough loot to sell to vendors to get my daily 1400 caps.
---
I have nearly 24k Atoms. I should be good to go whenever the Brotherhood stuff finally shows up.
---
Good point, didn't think about that.
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
They need to rebuild the game from the ground up on a new engine that would probably fix a lot of the damn issues
---
Yeah I don't wanna deal with AFK dudes in Chinese stealth armor whilst I'm in a radiation rumble or something equivalent in difficulty. U tried my friend but in the end. We're all monsters at heart.

---
Raider Lives Matter
---
I really enjoy the "unmarked" quests. Finding notes or holotapes and following a story on my own. The lore and tragedies in those are really immersive. Those are the best part of the game imo.  Fun to come across these stories while just exploring.
---
I was pretty fun to farm scorchbeasts this way. When they spawn, shoot them to aggro them and lead them back towards your turrets. It never got old watching them get shredded by tracers

No just the tent and you can no longer put junk in the scrap box, but you can remove it as you need it I've heard

You can’t. Super disappointing.

I have a bloodied2525 one on my alt and its fun to roleplay a ranger and headshot everything with VATS.
---
But even then, I won’t buy this, simply because I think it would totally ruin the aesthetic.
---
Indeed.. but you have to go through it and process the emotions so they don’t surprise you later on. I’d like to think she would call me a dummy for hesitating to play :P
---
No - at least, as far as the gear goes. Unsure about emote.

Also, you keep the Scrapbox and everything in it too. You can take shit OUT, but you can't put new shit IN.

I didn't know it was a bundle originally, have just seen the stairs in the wild and wanted them.
---
The last one. Getting discounts on bundles where you own some of the contents has been a very popular request since they first started selling bundles. They are aware of what they're doing because they know the people who spend money on this game will largely be willing to spend more to get that one item they want

B3325 seems to be the godroll for Gauss Shotgun currently, with the 33% hit chance in VATS it’s accuracy is very good in Vats, and ofc 25% vats cost reduction to top it all off, you hit the nail right on the head.
---
You know, at first I totally hated the 76 idea, I formed my opinions in some youtubers and all that stuff, like some people do! but then I saw it at free trial on steam and said "hell, I'd rather playing it and hating it instead of not playing it and hating it" and the guess what, totally fell in love with this game, I have like 200 hours wich isn't much because I've been pretty busy, but I play every chance i have, I love this game so much, it's not flawless but it's perfect to me
---
Perfect for my nighttime minuteman build! Lol
---
What would you suggest crafting to sell?
---
Nah, the 50 cal is my main gun and I now have 40,000 plus rounds of ammo for it, the Gatling is the most economical gun in the game for sure though.
---
pretty much anything except radiation. Flamer floaters should ALWAYS be attacked with physical damage first, whether melee, or ranged, as they quickly level up a higher level of energy resist.   
---
The weapon, I'd say, matters a LOT less than tactics. if you're going ranged, keep the absolute max distance. Their ranged attacks have travel speed, so you can dodge and fire back.  
---
If going with melee, make sure you have high armour, and healing stims, or the healing mutation.  
---
They're middling in speed and agility, high in immediate damage, moderate in damage over time. You either smash them in a couple of hits of melee, or skirmish with them at range and whittle them down.  
---
They seem a little scary at first simply because unlike launch enemies, the game was not designed around them, but the \*trade off\* of that is that they're not outright OP, either.  
---
Personally I use a heavy all rise + max strength + mutations + power armor + adrenaline + two handed perk character, so she can smash through pretty much any number of them without effort.
---
She doesn't think so, at the rate she drops them. And they hurt. Not just emotionally, they actually hurt a lot.
---
I would assume that they do. It seems like stealth just takes the sum of all equipped apparel and uses that to determine the impact on stealth. I notice a distinct difference when going above/below the 5WT threshold of all equipped apparel. BTW, your backpack and underarmor weights also count against stealth as well. Hats do too, but they’re all like 0.1WT.
---
Thank you! A lot of the QOL seems important? How would you suggest I make things different?  Their were a few things I took out bc I ran out of points and didnt need it on all the time like the repair weapons and armor to 200%

I just build the x01 and loving the prototype skin. Should i get the liberty prime skin?
---
Just like with ESO- if you BUILD for PvP, it's great. I won't do it with F76 just because I'm a one toon kid and with a baby due next week my playing life is over as I see it. I'll probs have time to dabble in PvE on my one toon... Until I train my minion to fight WITH me, but he's gonna need to learn to wipe his butt before I put a controller in his hands and say 'fight with me, son'. 
---
I can't speak for any exploits or aid stacking etc and dishonour the PvP community by pretending I know what I'm talking about. But I think some divide so the PvP community get challenging and rewarding fights  against like minded players benefits them as much as being able to build a camp, farm or explore in peace would benefit the PvE communities. 
---
If it's anything like ESO the two can never fully coexist and they blame eachother for all manner of nerfing etc. I honestly believe that the business of F76 would thrive with a divide between the two, and lead to happier players on both sides of the fence.
---
If they want bigger presence in PVP, may I suggest seasonal or event rewards? It draws cannon fodder from pve into PvP in ESO, and even I dont mind dying over and over for a few weeks of the year for some good rewards :) 
---
Is it cost effective and easy to implement, well, that's the question. Every side's got considerations.
---
Honestly they should just put them under the first tab to make it clear
---
exactly what is in the post, the Invader baton is not a baton its a combat knife and its not a skin its considered a separate weapon, it cannot be legendary nor can it be applied to a legendary combat knife
---
Eh, looks nice but everyone has a camp like this now big or small.
---
Ammo Smith, scrapper, and your lockpick you should really only use when you are doing the activity that requires them, that's frees up the points for something more helpful in combat like increase AP regen in agility on top of your lone wanderer 30% AP regen
---
Yea rebuild that shit screw them that told you to scrap it.  I garantee it had nothing to do with it.  I've had servers drop on me in an open field no mobs no other players around, the servers are just unstable and you got unlucky
---
If you do rebuild it let me no I'll launch some nukes with ya
---
I had issues with it if I left my comp on for several days at a time it would just expire. Just kill the Bethnet.launcher and start it up again
---
Ran by Woody Harrelson?
---
Unless you are going for an absolute meta build, I wouldn't sweat perks too much, play how you like.
---
Are you a solo player or a team player, cause if you are solo you have way more points in charisma than you need. I only have hard bargain active when selling at vendors. you could get by with 4 in charisma, and then switch out lone wanderer for hard bargain when using vendors. 5 charisma if you want lone wanderer and travel agent.
---
If you want to keep 8 charisma, get tenderizer and run that instead of hard bargain, it'll boost your damage.
---
I'd also switch out ammosmith and born survivor for action boy. Gives you better ap regen, and lets you sprint around more, which is good if you aren't planning on doing stealth. you only need ammosmith when you are making ammo, so just switch it in and out as needed.
---
I have some other suggestions, but as I said, that starts getting into meta mode, and if you just like running around having fun and don't care about that, it isn't that important.  
---
Edit: Also, everything you have in Intelligence is useless 99% of the time. I know I said I wasn't going meta, but 9 intelligence in a rifle/no power armor build is bonkers.
---
Also at the time, the  higher level you were, the more caps you would loose! So having a low level was actually a viable strategy in making caps!
---
You get lucky, just like any other legendary weapon you want.
---
There are many kind of magical weapons, but the prefix can’t be bloodied or furious. Those weapons can’t get the damage stacking on the lmg at least.
---
Yeah, they tend to build up when you sign up for a year sub and really have nothing better to do with your play time than to complete challenges for atoms, then you don't spend any because a vast majority of the Atomic Shop stuff doesn't interest you.
---
Screenshot or it never happened.
---
Xbox.
---
One effect is that enemies will have a chance to explode on death, the big problem is that there's four different legendary perks for this meaning ranged, thrown, melee, unarmed respectively get their own versions of it. There wasn't much else and so the level of choice is poor so they are reworking it.
---
Oof, I can imagine, I'm the total opposite build, pure tank, and NGL, sometimes I have to pop a superstim if I'm taking on a large group. doing it as bloodied must be a reaaaal fun juggling game.
---
i to am curious, im keeping a watch on this one to find out more
---
Might want to check the levels of players on the server to help decide where to nuke. If you drop on Fissure Prime, you’re more likely to get help from higher levels. Not enough help, and the SBQ event can fail on you. On the flip side, nuking Whitesprings or a similar spot will allow more lower levels to join the party.
---
Sent her straight to the void
---
This is why i've bought if for a month (although my furlough has been extended so might make it another month). Gonna fill it with enough junk to last me a year.
---
You don't need Hard Bargain and Picklocks equipped all the time,  for example, from my perspective.
---
Forever
---
The fact that my opponent needs to consent to pvp is fucking atrocious and makes pvp practically not existent
---
I found a dead one in there. I guess the super mutants don’t like it
---
I bet it tasted bad
---
Not a great idea, fire floaters are actually more resistant to energy than physical.   
---
Also, that reduces the mobility advantage the player has and makes it an area of effect and close range match, which a group of floaters is ALWAYS going to win.
---
Bro I need that space kitten backpack to comeback.
---
So you camped at the SBQ?,illegal squatter!! the watoga chief will hear of this!!!.
---
I love shooting mini nukes at her stupid face from the medics fatman she gives me
---
OK, thanks. At level 330+ I haven't met it yet.
---
correct
---
You are right! But "at least" they are not behind the paywall like they are in eso. RNG with legendary modules still sucks tho.
---
All the perks that you have equipped that don’t immediately help you do what you want (ie scrapper) should be left off and used only when needed. Focus on making your preferred weapon do as much damage as possible, add the appropriate perks... all of them. All three rifleman all at three stars. 
---
Look at you build and ask yourself do I absolutely have to invest in this perk and the accompanying special points. Is this perk going to help me all the time or is this going to be situational? If situational then don’t have it equipped 24/7.
---
Minimum stats in unsupported special means you get to your desired build faster and have a more consistent game play. 
---
For example:
---
5 in cha is good if you are having lone wander, leaves you a point to put in travel agent. When selling, you can equip hard bargain and party boy for some extra help with prices. 
---
Do this with each stat and build you character that way. When you’re done put the remaining special points to help the build. 
---
Max the special, and in most cases accompanying special, then fill the rest in. Luck is great with most any build. 
---
I’m a heavy gunner. So, I’ve max points in str to max the heavy gunner perks and bear arms and blocker. I can switch out these perks for the melee that I normally use quite quickly. 
---
Hope this helps. I’ll gladly give advice / guidance if you want.
---
It’s just based on time it will fill them up based on how many you have it just puts one water randomly out of your purifiers
---
SMF?  
---
I'm old, sorry.
---

SMF-Stupid Mother F@ck3r

That’s my guess
---
That is my perfect roll, I dont think the FFR is as good either since things take the same amount of shots regardless of how fast it takes. I've been sold on that combo
---
Look the username is older than the gimmick &gt;_&gt;
---
at its the same with picklock or hard bargain, swap it in when needed until bethesda gives us passive skills. if you use vats a lot, go for conentraded fire, if no vats, long shot is a good PER perk. also, get rid of the melee perks, concentrate on damage.  
---
do you play bloodied (low health, most of your healthbar is radiated) if not, throw that gauntlet away.  
---
im a full health commando build and this are my perks:

with good reason, a default combat knife with a funky skin is still a useless default weapon, if it was a skin i'd have use for it but atm i do not, only time i even use it is if im doing meat week and even then its mostly to show off a newly crafted "knife"

Level 109 launched my first Nuke not long ago, tried to do it at about the same level as you and got  battered and didnt understand the code system. Did it and it was so much more easier than I remembered. Cant wait to do more
---
Carry weight is probably your biggest issue. Get some levels for perk cards which reduce weight and try to get the full set of excavator armour. Once you've got a decent load capacity you just need to know what you should and shouldn't pick up....and to be honest there isn't much that isn't worth picking up when you've got the space for it other than stuff like pre-war money and rubber producing items.
---
Learning what items give you specific stuff helps and you can find the detail online. Off the top of my head;
---
Lead - almost all toys, paint, pencils, weights 
---
Antiseptic (big one for stim packs) - abraxo, toothpaste, soap
---
Screws - hot plate omg mind blank
---
Springs - clipboards and omg mind blank
---
If you go onto junk section of pip boy you can choose components that will show a magnifying glass next to items that have the stuff you need once it's scrapped.
---
You get the idea. As you progress you'll find that stuff you instictively don't pick up are stuff you actually need. For me I was leaving the toys and the abraxo as well as cigar boxes which are important for later builds because of the fibre optic spool.
---
If you want I can help you gather the stuff to get the excavator armour built. I can build you a set of 45 which is the highest level it can go to, you'll just need to put in the levelling to get to that. Can help you with that as well.

There's a lot of farmland south of the Crater and IIRC the NPCs tending it don't wear slave collars.

Damn really? Might buy a month and grind the hell out collecting junk
---
If you aren't planning on using ultracite ammo, make stable flux and put it in your vending machine. You are getting all the stuff to make it when looting the glowing ones, throw green thumb on and grab all the radiated plants and use super duper and you'll be able to make quite a bit.  
---
And for selling to the vendor bots, pick up everything, literally everything. Golf outfits sell for 20-30 caps depending on your charisma.
---
I personally love trading so I wouldn’t like this idea very much. That being said I would like more weapons that you can craft and not be tradable...
---
Would be cool to see the enclave plasma rifle, the alien blaster, The chainsaw and The Fixer like this. 
---
Those fixers are extremely hard to come by because pretty much the legendary vendor is the only place to get them. Even if they’d have a chance to drop from encrypitid. The market is so crazy for those right now. Giving up BE gat plasmas in 3:1 trade....Its a freaking combat rifle with a sneak bonus y’all.
---
Wait what's a tent camper? I put my tent down during the event so people can scrap/stash/get items when needed during or after the SBQ. I just want to make sure I'm not doing anything dickish I'm not aware of.
---
So how does letting players do nothing and get loot fix this any of these issues?
---
Dude came into my camp and laid explosives by every workbench I had.  I jumped servers cussing his name the entire time.
---
I've probably done 50 of these events in the two months I've been playing.  These were the first times I never got a drop, between my 2 shot explosive ultracite gatling gun and my quad double pump shot gun I've never had any trouble getting enough damage.
---
impossible. synths aren't in the game
---
I’ve tried an FFR I ended up crafting today, but the Fire Rate increase is barely noticeable and in third person it’s bugged and doesn’t increase the fire rate at all, 50% more crit damage in VATS would be good but thanks to how damage is calculated it results in a very minor damage boost, that leaves us with 33% VATS hit chance as the best alternative for a good 2nd effect
---
Nah you’re ok. Some people think the queen doesn’t land if people camp on top their tents or fence.
---
False, Pacifist makes it so you can't hurt anyone, even if you get drawn into PvP by someone else, it makes you helpless!
---
Plus it's nice that your junk doesn't take up weight in your stash
---
When people go to such extremes, sometimes it's a war on whether to automatically report and block them or to wait to see what other idiocy gets sent your way.  lol
---
Thanks, :D, it was one of the first rolls, then I gave up. 150 scrip a day (3 modules a day) is simply not enough for me to keep attention for long.

I heard that FFR does not work with a gauss shotgun? No clue. :(

Production doesn’t increase with more purifiers, Storage does.

I wish they could do something with her like they did with Minutemen in fo4, when even after main quest line, you get to have side quests with/from her. Maybe a bit less annoying, but still ....would be a nice asset to have...but no....they just kind of screwed it up...

So far, 1st stuff only releases on the first Atom Shop update each month. Don't hold your breath for anything otherwise.
---
No. RTX 2060 with an AMD cpu though.
---
This doesnt even deserve a post on reddit, you are giving them too much credits.
---
Gonna buy that Liberty Prime armor when my monthly atoms get here! Democracy is non-negotiable!
---
I've been really drunk and nuked to the West of the other fissure site a few times
---
Not new items, but I was glad that at least 4th of July stuff was released a week and a half early.  With Halloween and Christmas they literally released the themed items like 2 days before the holiday.  Couldn't decorate your camp ahead of time unless you had stuff from last year.
---
But what about the kinetic dynamo with dodgy?
---
Ah ok, I have amd CPU too, but I doubt it is the culprit though.
---
30th
---
Yeah, I try and launch a small bit to the west of FSP, it will still trigger Scorched Earth and you can get more mats  that way
---
I know Update 20 is the 30th. I’m asking if that is actually when the season starts.
---
Has been happening to me for months.  Only does it when I first log in though for maybe 2 or 3 minutes.

Just had my first CAMP destroyer, I was contesting my workshop then he got angry after I killed him 3 times and proceeded to destroy my decontamination shower...

Just a copy paste :)

If it's a door, it's probably the garage door. My other structures have doors on them, and they never give me any problems. But, if it's the garage door, why can I just throw the blueprint down without issue? It's a conundrum. I'm hoping that it had something to do with how my tinker's bench and armor bench were too close to each other. I was trying to place something in that build and noticed that the error messages are different for different objects if you go to set them down, and noticed the same message I'm getting when I go to place the build down on the tinker's bench. Hopefully, now that I spaced those benches out a bit, I'll be able to put that build down next time. 
---
It's just a weird thing all-around though, my power-house with the vending machines has all kinds of things crammed inside it, and I never have issue putting it down. [It even goes down when it's still in the red!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Utkaow63rfXZrojLdMRD_zY6hG5Kpq2I/view)

It's been  around a long  time, it's still  as unacceptable now as it was then.

Max AP refresh including perks and armour etc is 60%

I’m glad I made the choice to cure her headaches but never expected she would keep on saying nightmares regardless.
---
Its because they cant handle NW. Every time i play theres always some stupid 300+ taking my workshop just because they can and its always one of those with teslas that can one shot you, they don't even want the workshop because they always leave after. They just want to show you whos boss. 
---
One time when i was contesting it back, his teammate was somehow able to level my camp. 
---
The worst thing about this game is the trolls who play it
---
Yeah. Its been employed a lot recently though. Hopefully the extra attention will get it fixed finally.
---
Just...don’t shoot other players...it’s that easy. Unless you have an idiot teammate that goes around starting fights with high-level players
---
yea
---
I dunno man - are you *sure* you want it...
---
The fire rate and damage is pretty stellar, so yeah
---
My ideal pvp mode would be something akin to rust; have the gear balanced like nuclear winter, no levels or perks, random spawn points (unless you have a camp, the system currently in adventure would work well when you can't pick servers) and drop everything on death but increase drop rates of weapons and armour from mobs, npcs and containers. Introduce a few pvp focused events for high tier gear and you have something that would b better than rust, ark or dayz

Yeah i just started playing a few weeks ago (after wastelanders update) and i gotta say I’m having a lot of fun with it. Not sure why there’s so many complaints, however i did just reach the endgame so we will see.
---
Truth.
---
The perk should also work with cannibal.
---
Well, I can live with that. I`ll try not to feel bad when i one shot everything.
---
No i can do that but if you delete them if you move you cant build them back
---
Yes  I have over 2000 hours but the treasure hunter but things have added up over time that have really soured me on the game.  The queen can no longer be crippled. Bethesda said this was not intended and they were looking into it, but the last time I played it had not been fixed.
---
All the grinding from Fascnacht and treasure hunter events left me feeling drained.   What really broke me was the announcement that they are going to  delay the Colossal problem event, which is  a new end game boss fight that this game has  sorely needed  for a very long time.
---
I tolerated the long delay of Wastelanders with the understanding that finishing it would leave a framework in place to build upon. Therefore new content would roll out quicker from then on.  Instead, we area already seeing more delays for new content. 
---
There's other stuff but they really need to fix some stuff before I can enjoy this game again.
---
Wait uhh
---
I've just started a new toon... Thought I'd try a no power armour build
---
I swear fallout people complain about anything
---
Like I don't get the people who are like 'the raiders are actually decent people and the settlers are worse than them uwuwuwuwu' 
---
Foundation's walls are coated in death threats from the raiders. People talk about Paige being smug, but ambient dialogue from raiders is full of insults, threats, and condescension. Raiders are the only ones that'll shoot you on-sight when you first start playing Wastelanders. Players will sometimes bring up that Appalachia doesn't "belong" to the settlers, but raiders are quick to tell you how excited they are to *literally steal shit* that "doesn't belong to [them]". Nobody lifted a finger to save Ra-Ra, a literal child. Etcetera, etcetera.
---
I'll agree that the Raider's questline is more *entertaining*, but it's hardly the most *moral* one.
---
Yup. They keep thinking that items that are jokey and bright with colour is something we want in an apocalyptic wasteland.
---
it’s like if WoW raid bosses only dropped cosmetic joke items.
---
I want to look cool, like I fit into the world... not like an idiot playing the worst game ever rated.
---
Get a bunch of friends together give them all 1 or two and you've got a good old revolutionary war group
---
KARS
---
Thanks you all guys.
---
I miss the tap option on sitting etc.  Was a design of my original camp that you needed to jump towards a shuttered window and click the edge of a chair to pull yourself into my building.
---
Grr sorry im think you might be right delete my post
---
But not sure about camp items
---
Actually the vaults should be free fast travel and all other fast travel should be removed. Fast travel shouldn’t have been in the game to start with.
---
Aww damn, well thanks anyways!!
---
I agree, that's quite a conundrum. I was also wondering if a decoration on a wall might be glitching into the wall slightly, and causing issues as well
---
Now you can wear fabulous outfits.
---
Very nice! Solid info here op! I didn’t know they addressed it in the AMA that’s good to know they aren’t necessarily working to change it rn.
---
I add in a single fertilizer scrap, and if I'm feeling plucky, a Molotov cocktail!
---
She has armor, more armor than any other enemy in the game iirc. The 70% is taken off from the remaining damage after armor penetration is applied
---
 That was one of the reasons.  Lol
---
Well that explains a lot. Ive respecced into Heavy from Stealth Commando over the last double XP weekend. My out of PA get up is the Enclave Uniform and Stealth Suite Helm, sort of a Cobra Commander look. Been noticing I seem to always be diseased even when I haven't really been in combat. I bet its because the helmet is not protecting me when I'm in water... Thanks for posting!
---
Wrong sub homie :)
---
Pretty much any stealth build worth that name should run the Escape Artist perk. Which eliminates all sounds from normal running (not sprinting), which in turn makes armor weight irrelevant when it comes to sneaking.
---
If, for whatever reason, you decide to run a stealth build without that perk, then yes, armor weight has a small influence on stealth due to heavier armor being slightly noisier to walk in.
---
Lol - my bad
---
You can also store stable flux in scrapbox.
---
Just thought I’d let you know before they delete it!  No worries!
---
Golden AK and .50 Cal, Free States Vendor and Mosaic Tiles were all things I dropped out on earlier, but now my goldmine of Atoms took a huge hit.
---
FYI there’s another, fancier potted plant sold in the Whitespring mall furniture store
---
Sux being wanted but not being able to defend against bounty hunters until Usually its To Late  
---
Unsure of exactly how it works but its a way to lure would be pvpers
---
Maybe you should not have bought a low budget computer.
---
yes I know you said PS4
---
That would indeed be nice
---
That’s so sad. Did you end up fixing it or just sided settlers?
---
I think I saw one go recently for 20k
---
https://fo76map.com
---
Just remove PVP and be done with it, jesus.
---
I'm not even playing it anymore but I'm still subbed here to keep up with its movements just in case I do want to jump back in.
---
Nope, but enough to get full.
---
8m talking about individual purifiers thought some will have max while others have 0
---
She lands less often if the queen targets you ontop of them.
---
There isn't anything wrong with having the tent down here though for stash access and you have a place to respawn too, shame that respawn assistance isn't extended to everyone though!
---
So 12/h per purifier?
---
Edit: I'm using the ones that require ground only
---
Stop playing and find another game. Wastelanders becomes Fallout 76 2018 after the main quest is done.
---
That engine has really fucked that company.
---
I don't mind playing with hand signals if you ever need a teammate to rush the nuke bunkers. I've only done it 3 or 4 times (solo) but together we can totally breeze through. 
---
I just completed my long overdue Solar Armor. About to start on the jetpack tonight. I want to be in theme as a space cadet for the 1st season coming up.
---
Also, I can see what flux I have. I just mass pounded out some serums last night so I'm not exactly sure what I have left
---
I want it. Not sure worth. I'd pay a couple thousand caps.
---
Are you positive you’re picking up all the gold?
---
There should be 1000.
---
Si... im a greedy whore
---
It still doesn't :p my buddy and I finished the other day. Both over 70 I got the lvl 20 version and he got the lvl 50. My camp is near vault 76 and his near white spring. So definitely not working
---
PlayStation and X-box have built in text chat features, but it's not ingame, you have to effectively minimise the game.
---
So I should hold on to it for trade
---
The way she asks "why" is wildly out of place. It really feels they have given the voice actors the script with zero directions. They constantly emphasize wrong words, like when Guerrerra says "ahh" like she fell off something, then proceeds with "I found something!". I even remember noticing this with Jason Mewes' acting, which boils it down to a bad director, or an absent one.
---
Well, to be fair. They probably worked/grinded a long time for their “legacy” weapon. Although I don’t think they should be taken out the game, I suggest Bethesda add them back in the game but fix them, along with the “magic” weapons. Or keep them how they are it really don’t matter to me lol
---
I have been saying this on every post I see bashing fo1st but I always just get down voted
---
Very dissapointed. I'm just hoping they will rerelease the armored Ranger armor as i was not a 1st member when that was available, would be awesome if they just gave 1st members access to all the exclusives that have been released through that service, that would for sure entice more players to get it.
---
if only you could be convinced to post the daily atom challenges.  even on breaks from 76 I have checked your atom shop posts for goodies.  on occasion only turning on 76 to spend atoms!
---
Thank you i have a feeling who made this post is a sit and shit player....can i coin sit and shit? Lol
---
Play Rust.
---
Friends don’t let friend PvP in Fallout 76
---
There should be based on the 4th of july content, but its a crap shoot honestly
---
That does make sense. I personally just go on the back side of the fence and try to stay in sneak. I’ve heard she won’t land if you shoot her in the air as well but I’ve also never seemed to have that problem. I’m by no means a scorched earth expert though.
---
Right, it’s only producing water at the rate of your best purifier, it just puts the water into them at random. 
---
When some are at zero, that just means you haven’t produced up to your storage limit yet, those will start to fill up as if you wait longer.
---
Yepper. I picked the stealth helmet because it looks cooler than the marine one. Found out I still got diseases with it even though it says I shouldnt when I was running through the mire. Thats what led me to doing the testing on it and found the marine tactical is the only one only works right.
---
Great so I guess I'll never get the plans. Such fucking bullshit that you need all 3 alive, everyone always just feeds the one and ignore all the other animals after!
---
I FINALLY finished my SS set last night. 
---
- chest: chameleon, powered, sneak
---
- RA: chameleon, poison, sneak
---
- LA: Autu-sim ,powered, sentinels
---
- RL- vangaurd,powered, sneak
---
- LL vangaurd, powered, sneak
---
I took just over 100 rolls for my right arm alone (last and most stubborn peice). Ive rolled 3-4 peices a day since the first weekend of wastelanders . Thats 10 weeks, 3 a day , so atleast 220 rolls. But probably  closer to 250 since i had a big chunk of scrip saved for wastelanders. I get getting 1*'s is annoying but its way better than the perveyor. Atleast i get to pick what item im rolling.
---
Shooting her in the air in of itself isn't a problem, but it is of people are using perks that cause stagger with their ranged weapons, that can make it harder for her to land, less of a problem than people sitting on fences, the V9 bunker, and tents.
---
Pretty much the fastest way to fight her is to draw the fight onto the grass to the east of the bunker!
---
Bethesda’s poor game design putting them into a corner where everyone becomes god tier, making new content almost worthless.
---
it’s why Vanilla WoW only let players level to 60 and not 509.
---
this is obvious shit
---
The year of Karen’s, they come in all sizes, shapes, and age.
---
Shake my Femur
---
Yup that’s about where I tend to be. Thanks man this was pretty insightful.
---
They should bring them back, then maybe people could actually trade rather than every trade being "lEgAcY oR eXpLoSiVe LaSeRs"
---
I’ve seen people sell it for like 80k plus I jsut wanted to verify
---
I made this crummy map a long time ago, it out dated now, but to a fellow explorer to another, I hope it helps
---
https://i.redd.it/19ikukmnrll21.jpg
---
Yes they are I have 1st my wife doesn't and the "discount" items dont even show up for non 1st members
---
Lol at clubseals at workshops.
---
I've seen people make raised flat platform bases too, in theory she would land on it, but I've not seen her be able to, perhaps that's due to her being unable to be crippled anymore. The only upside I'm seeing is its much easier to shoot her on the sky from those.
---
I wish we had a real PVP mode where I could test my builds, none of this workshops
---
There needs to be more events like scorched earth and more rewards for those events.
---
Lmfao.
---
That's just what I'd expect a synth to say...
---
Also make camps lootable! (Like rust etc)
---
Are you willing to share your custom ini?
---
Someone from 'War on Bethesda' faking a post to make people think their protest had any sort of effect?
---
True, they keep it under 7k in publics is what they say, i use commando weapons so my highest output per bullet has obly been 2k so far
---
Can confirm. I rolled one from the purveyor last week. Needless to say it went straight back in the scrip machine.
---
You lose all your junk if your camp gets nuked????!!!?
---
Even if they do announce crossplay for fallout 76, it'll probably like 2 years before it comes out, just announcing it for the hype.
---
It will be easy for him to fix. don’t sweat it too much haha
---
Level 507 here....I still love this game.
---
It means stupid mother f*******.
---
I’ve launched probably 10 times and I still get lost 🤣🤣🤣
---
Get beckett as an aly to find out who the eagles really are, hint, they arent just a defensive group
---
The latter, definitely the latter
---
just bought one. so disappointed
---
Where is this? I have only ran into one Behemoth since I started playing.
---
Nuka cola , nuka cola quantum etc.
---
80k? Nah, that's a rip-off. I have never asked for more than 40k, but usually I'll settle for a lot less if in a pinch. If I put one into my vendor for 15k, it sells like a hotcake, but honestly I value them at 30k because it took ages (and hundreds of technical data, and I'm not talking low hundreds) to get to that point.
---
It seems they've started cycling the freebies
---
Extremely poor, I tested this as well by having a mole miner hit me and to see how many hits I can take before I run out of AP and dodgy stops triggering. This was the first thing I tried because it made sense due to the synergy.
---
Unfortunately, it basically did nothing at all. I think the reason is that KD AP return is scaled based on the damage taken. The issue here is that damage is so highly mitigated (everything hits me for &lt; 2% of my HP), KD scales really poorly to the point where it is not even quantifiable.
---
Considering that Assembled more than halves the regen rate of AP, there doesn't currently look to be a reason to choose KD over Assembled.
---
Yea I’m trading 20k ultracite 556 for one is that a good deal?
---
Yeap this was the first thing I tried with Dodgy and it did nothing at all - I was pretty disappointed because the synergy was so enticing.
---
Forever.
---
just...
---
It doesn't help that the "meta" for pvp is a bloodied tesla rifle with a stealth boy and a jetpack, aka the most uninteresting and unfair shit ever
---
I hate her face when she gives me a black powder pistol. Perfect for my heavy weapons build.
---
But..i dont know your level i have fusoin reactors all sorts of fun stuuf that would help if interested
---
yes it is
---
I've seen an increase of lower level (mid 20's) players showing up in groups at my camp lately and just running around causing chaos.
---
They attack you with melee, shoot off rockets and so on just being disruptive.
---
I even had a guy buy the grenades from my vending machine and proceed to throw them at my buildings.
---
I just switch servers and get rid of them, but it is annoying to say the least...  ...
---
YES. im only lvl 9 and the other night i got griefed by the typical angsty snotty 17 year old. did it cause i had passive mode on and they didn’t get enough pleasure out of trying to hit me. lvl 150+ assholes thought it was funny to blow up all my hard work, then i had 0 materials to build it up again with :(
---
Fuck i just spent 5 hours making a Jazz camp
---
SMF?
---
The reason people hate PvP is because it’s a fucking gun game that uses RPG mechanics... BETHESDA rpg mechanics.
---
If you want good open world pvp in a survival game, play Rust. It’s deep, you get what you ask for, and there aren’t any bullshit rpg mechanics or a broken engine you have to fight against. 
---
I enjoy Fallout 76... I really do. But I also have come from 3000 hours of Rust and FO76’s pvp is, and always will be, the butt end of a joke. 
---
Here’s how you fix Fallout PVP: Build a new engine from scratch.
---
That is all.
---
God no :P But I was dumb. Never turning of pacifist mode again.
---
I want the gas mask with the red lenses, but that was the only thing I'm interested in. I can't justify spending that many atoms for a gas mask, no matter for freakin cool it is. I've been wearing the regular gas mask with goggles for like 60 levels.
---
Yep ,this is something I've been waiting for also.
---
Do they still support fallout 4? If so,  then at least a few more years I guess.
---
Till it stops making them money.
---
It’s doubtful full crossplay will be considered while there are so many issues on PC. Console cross play is slightly more likely, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up.
---
How do people have the budget for things like this?
---
I live in a box and am almost capped as it is.
---
Put items on favourite wheel, extra security step to prevent scrapping.
---
100%.
---
If you take a look at my 2nd edit, I found Kinetic Servos was about as useful as any of the perks in terms of dropping AP regen by another second. I found it was better to run Lone Wanderer (which I always do because of the damage mitigation) with Assembled to hit the 4-second mark, leaving me open to take calibrated shocks again.
---
I thought long and hard about losing the jetpack too - but I found I don't miss what I don't have. Once I took the jetpack off, it took all of 10 minutes to forget about it. 
---
However, when I took off assembled, I felt the cripplingly slow AP regen rate every single minute (I sprint a lot) to the point where I had to switch back because I couldn't stand it.
---
However, this is definitely a personal preference. I would suggest having a go at assembled for a day, then switch back to jetpack to see which one you like best.
---
eat a can of spaghetti sauce cold
---
Not if both characters are under the same psn
---
Edit: one of you will have to start over if u wanna play together
---
Why?
---
Nope, have to start a new character. On the bright side item transfer will be easy between y'all.
---
It might be his 1rd time posting, lay off
---
r/unexpectedMontyPython ?
---
Just finish the questline and she talks alot less (unless you romance her, then she doesn't shut up)
---
Customer experience is key
---
Somehow I get the feeling that this feature would just result in a million dupe glitches, due to being able to recover destroyed items.
---
Do it
---
Nuka colas, combined with the cola nut perk you get hp/ap regenaration.
---
I didn't realize I didn't have them in these pictures.  I have the big white pots, this is just an older pic.  Unless there are more?
---
Interesting... now the level of the friendly mob, does that effect the reward at the end or is the best reward still the same if you get three level three friendly mobs or three low level bugs?
---
Yeah like...hatches that can be placed on the ground in your camp that goes to a Instanced private area.
---
Read the Inside the Vault article on Bethesda's website about the road map for this year.
---
I want Todd Howard to eat my crusty asshole.
---
Not that it helps this week, but the Nuka Girl outfit's helmet can be worn with glasses. It does put a hood on you inside the glass helmet though.
---
The main draw of the liberty prime armour is how much time it spends shouting at full volume at literally anything in the vicinity
---
Tell him to chill out and direct him to the game Rust. 
---
It seems more up his alley.
---
Holy shit, lived in the USA for ten years and this is something you hear a lot in the ex-pat community here and this is the first time ive seen an american articulate it.
---
Pull my finger and get a headache
---
but theres only a certain amount
---
I put a ~ at the beginning of every named object I wanna keep and it forces it to the bottom of my list, only issue I’ve run into with that is it says I’ve run out of custom name space and it won’t let me rename stuff after awhile.
---
Even as a 1* it should have a decent value to it since it's legacy and no longer drops in the game. Put a price check post in the market sub and see what folks say.
---
...yeah, every god damn room looks the same and you’ve got doors that lead to rooms at the start, and every time you die you start right back at that damn elevator! I’ll do better next time, maybe I’ll try it out on a public server.
---
Habitat C represent.
---
I'm always jonesing for some glitched Radkelp to put on display
---
I wanna know if anyone has placed a cabinet you know the one...that will only snap to roofs.
---
Yes you am
---
At least my girl Rocksy appreciates me 😍
---
Check the market mate, they’ll tell you exactly how valuable it is. It’ll most likely be one of those “Can’t trade for caps” items because it’s so valuable.
---
Extra flames mod doesn't affect the FF healing, fyi
---
No and no. But if you craft both you will still have both. However after Fallout 1st expires the scrap box becomes inoperable. You can pull scrap out but not deposit.
---
Loot box and the resultant gem currency is a poor direction I admit. But at the very least they are not buried in the game itself and they  only offer cosmetic luxuries or otherwise available utility potions. 
---
I’ve played genes where boxes fell in game with real usable loot upgrades but required paid keys to open. I dropped those games quick.
---
OMG..I got to hurry up and...(Robot Voice) not install game.
---
No, they're talking about Quericus Formula Q
---
You're welcome.
---
To be fair the game takes place in the US.
---
Bethesda needs to NOT gate items.
---
I get it, Bethesda has to protect it's precious new currencies, but it's is a) stupid, b) bad design,   and c) not even remotely fun or entertaining.
---
Bethesda is desperately trying to get into the business of selling you nothing (digital bullshit). We are just present at its corrupt birth pangs.
---
Appreciate it!
---
They’ll get a comms ban easy, Microsoft are rather strict
---
Subscriptions and online gaming with in-game purchases are the now and future of gaming, so I figure they will continue trying to continue working on this for a while.
---
As long as it’s crossplay between PlayStation and Xbox. Them PC people can keep their hackers and shagged economy.
---
Sounds like communism to me.
---
Its a mash up of a couple that I found and I picked the stuff I liked the best. It gets rid of the intro stuff, the eye adapt when you go from dark to bright and gets rid of grass to find stuff easier. If you want the introl stuff, just delet everything in \[General\] If you like the Eye Adapt feature just delete the AlwaysInstantEyeAdapt or change it to 0. If you like the grass, just delete that entry or make it a 1. No grass looks weird at first and makes it very old game looking but if I can find dead bodies easier I'm all for it.

Sounds normal, she be a tough old bird and absorbs damage like a sponge. Getting her on the ground is key to damage because you can get up close and personal. The further away she is, the less damage you do (not sure what the exact figures are, but damage drops with distance for ranged attacks).
---
I always thought you where meant to use a tent while camping :P
---
I’ll go check em out!
---
I quit around meat cook and played again during New Years, I also really want the thanksgiving display case back, that would save me so much space.
---
haha i know - with the complaint that the OP was being spammed i thought it amusing to highlight the difference
---
I think it was a good game.  However its not good enough for me to download a 50gb patch every other month because the developers are morons.
---
you know how to use the space key.that is obvious because you use it between words.why you don't use it when ending a sentence is bizarre.also why don't you start a sentence with a capital letter or end a paragraph with a period?
---
Do they support it now? Really?
---
Don't know about x-box, but if you enable privacy features that would stop these random spamming messages on PS4 would also stop you from being able to have party chats with other players!
---
End game is wearing a full set of Unyielding Armor and using a Bloodied weapon.
---
How can I be a synth if I don't have recaptcha? 🤔
---
Well nvm. No reason to get a second PS4 now lol. Thanks 🖤
---
Meh...tasted like chicken.
---
Ever think that chicken tastes like human flesh?
---
How about a social tab update to get it to work?
---
I have a two shot explosive single action revolver good for ghouls. I call it "Big Iron"; found it for 2k while I also got my Bloodied 33% 15% crit 50 cal I use religiously. that 33% extra vats accuracy is so crazy useful.
---
Oh we're pretty sure Bethesda knows this.
---
 Just sad they won't change this for many corporate reasons.
---
You can find the market in my post history, for idiotic reasons we aren’t allowed to say it’s name outright. 
---
If you want to sell something make a post on that sub titled if you’re on PS4 for example
---
[PS4] H: Item W: Item
---
Or if you wanna price check something make a post like 
---
[Price Check] Instigating Dragon
---
And if you do go to sell something this valuable, make a comment saying
---
Courier!
---
And someone with high karma will act as a middle man and deliver your items for you safely. (You can always trust people with higher karma in the hundreds though. They aren’t about to get blacklisted for stealing one item from a new guy.)
---
Yes. All my loading screens are posed for photos with frames, filters, frequently people on my friends list. All the boring pics "take a photo of black bear lodge" are deleted.
---
This way all my loading screens are postcards, including some that are now impossible to recreate, like two of us posing at the crashed space station pre wastelanders
---
No but they will be tagged with a note saying they made these threats and harassment via messages.
---
Or if they've been tagged before they will likely be temp banned.
---
Xbox doesn't fuck around with that stuff.
---
Thankfully.
---
Exception:  Nukes.
---
If you go through the trouble of launching a nuke at someone's base, and they don't realize that they need to move within the time limit, well ... fair play to you, good sir.
---
Well hello there Jeffery Dahmer. 😄
---
Oh crap, you pissed off Major Nelson and Phil Spencer. Run for your life !
---
Hi yourself.
---
I stay subbed here because while it has what I wanted in Rust it doesn’t have It in FO76.
---
PvP
---
Lol. On personal level I understand getting upset in the heat of the moment. But still holding a grudge after two weeks? That's some Warhammer Dwarf-level grudge...
---
From what they said, the original intention was to have it stack like other armor effects, they know it doesn't work as intended and haven't talked about working on it, similar to shadowed on most armor minus leather.
---
Last time I tested, Pacifist does NOT stop all damage. 
---
If you have Pacifist on, and someone in your squad initiates PvP - you will be hostile to the other squad. 
---
Team tagging is going to kill PvP all together. It means that everyone in a squad has to individually initiate PvP with everyone in the other squad. 
---
That's why I am saying Pacifist On - no damage. Pacifist Off - normal PvP rules.
---
hopefully until SKATE4 comes out at the least..
---
If it were true they would know that nobody at ms cares about whatever their fuzzy little problem is. not even a little.
---
I already said this in another thread but this is worth repeating.  THERE IS NO FUCKING PLEASING YOU PEOPLE.  Pick any previous holiday and Bethesda waits until the last minute to update the shop, often releasing just a few days before or even on/after the holiday and people are LIVID that they weren't able to buy shit and dress up themselves and their camp in time for the holiday.  Now they go and release shit a week early and you're STILL COMPLAINING.
---
I know firsthand how overly strict they are, I one asked why someone team killed me in rainbow 6 and mentioned that he was being annoying and asked that he please stop, and I got a 24 hour non-appealable com ban and was removed from the xbox ambassadors program. Let's just say I was a little peeved at Microsoft after that.
---
Why are people so against PVP in adventure. It has almost always been optional.        
---
         
---
Fallout has so many variables that the PVP is extremely dynamic, and also VERY competitive. If you want to win PVP fights, there is no doubt you need to make the best build you can.     
---
       
---
Now this may not be ideal for people who are constantly scared of being forced to pvp, which will not happen. But Fallout is an apocalypse game.    
---
     
---
Humans are one of the scariest elements in an apocalypse.      
---
I disagree with the elimination of PVP from adventure because then it is just “animal hunting and loot collecting.” Which a lot of us after a few thousand hours find very hollowing.    
---
      
---
A game with so much focus on warfare and the mistakes of humans, surely can mot leave out one of the fundamentals of a First Person Shooter.      
---
I suggest Faction teaming + PVP events. On the adventure map.     
---
-&gt; Create faction teams which can use a team name and choose if it is a PVP team or NOT.    
---
-&gt; PVP teams can only fight other PVP Teams and do not need to shoot back to start a fight.       
---
-&gt; PVP teams can have Allies and Enemies.      
---
PVP EVENTS:      
---
-&gt; More events like monster mash to give reward based competition. Encourages people previously scared of PVP to try.     
---
-&gt; PVP events again optional to participate in! (But you won’t get the PVP rewards if you don’t try!)     
---
People can lobby the idea of removing PVP from adventure as much as they like, and I will continue to remind those people:     
---
No one ever forced you to PVP.     
---
- You got Angry and shot back at a PVP build? What to expect.        
---
- You accidently shot someone and they killed you?       
---
Aim better, cut out the friendly fire!      
---
- You trying to claim the workshops but keep getting killed?     
---
Either learn to fight back, avoid fights and workshops altogether, or get a private server.    
---

Incoming downvotes from the foodbuild brigade.

So those medical scrubs that were free awhile back were for Fallout 1st subs only ?

The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce. With the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on.

Did you know that the difference in average IQ’s between Canadian and American people is very small.  I am sorry my joke was written poorly.  Meant to be fun ribbing.   Btw West Virginia would be harder for most to locate than a country the size of Canada on a map. But I tend to agree with your point.
---
 I'm American, and I could not care less about 4th of July either.
---
I really want a sink, it would be amazing if someone would like to maybe meet up at my camp sometimes and build one for me or at least if that's how that works. I can compensate with in world items.
---
The dead guards in riding shotgun hav a good chance of having the helmet, also the black cowboy hat. I am talking about the ones dead near the "extra" treasure chest.
---
All the people that have killed me (3 total) would cowardly log off after they killed me. At least you didn't log off :)

Report his ass jokes on him when he gets a comm or an account ban
---
This	^
---
Report each message and he'll get a comm ban for each one. If he gets too many he will get online banned as well.

76 is a port of a ZeniMax studio that got merged with mainline Bethesda when their product wasn't shaping up to be marketable.
---
Zeni can demand Todd blow all the bandaids a man can foof, but the fact of the matter is the engine is 10+ years old and Zeni doesn't want to pay for software engineers.
---
See that mountain? Hopefully modders made you able to climb it, because Bethesda lacks the resources to make it so.
---
 Loyalty. Doesn’t anyone around here understand the meaning of the word?
---
I can hear that...
---
That's fantastic
---
nice, I'm using it
---
Mine is nocturnal😭.
---
The flag should be free ffs
---
Same as all the other pistols in the game, bad.
---
What did I miss?
---
I like her she seems kinda cute in a weird way besides she's how I got my bloodied handmade
---
Allegedly
---
Don't talk to the trolls.
---
They abuse the system unfortunately.
---
And if you do message someone don't swear in any way.
---
If they report it and you did that still constitutes an action of some sort.
---
Friends or someone you can trust.
---
It is meant to be used as part of Rose's quests originally. It can be crafted later to lure animals in and blow them up. For whatever reason, the damage goes through all pvp blockers.
---
Those two Raider Packs, do either of those offer [this](https://youtu.be/HYx-Zl4P-Cg) Raider Salute? I’ve wanted this emote but I can’t find any other info on it besides this video.
---
I just realized how creepy that sounded! Watching others build stuff. I meant just check out someone's camp
---
I have no friends so that ain’t going to work to well
---
I was waitin for my pension, but all I got was tension.
---
I'm just mentioning mild annoyance at the fact that there was no new content, they could've still had the July 4th stuff on top of previously unreleased content and that would've been fine. You seem to be getting upset over something very little.
---
Oh, he big mad!
---
For something like Uranium Fever, yes (just the legendaries). Scorched Earth, no.
---
for many years to come, it's still a good money maker for them. It's going to be a  while before a new fallout with the new TES coming out so they will keep this baby going.
---
F76 gives them micro transactions and subscriptions on top of an initial payment for the game.And despite all the drama that surrounds this game it's actually pretty popular. I don't know anybody in the gaming world who hasn't heard about F76.
---
But that's just my opinion.
---
Pc
---
Best option: Use a trusted friend to hold your gear then give it back to the new character. Or find a trusted and vetted courier on one of the bartering subs to act as your intermediary. 
---
Next best option: Use a trusted friend’s private world, and confirm they will not be logging out anytime soon. 
---
Last option (and riskiest): find an active public world and take note of the usernames on that server. Find a hidden spot away from other people and make sure both of your characters are as close to that spot as possible. Drop the items in a container that has no upper limit, then log out and into the other character. Join the world of one of the usernames you notated and check your drop spot. If they haven’t server-hopped and no one found your container, the items should be there. 
---
Test your preferred method using low value items first. Be aware that all of these methods come with risk.

My wife loves listening to Chills.
---
Send help.
---
And by help, I mean a gun to shoot myself with.
---
1 week until update 20 comes out, potentially adding the service rifle as a paid skin.  Hoping maybe this gets some traction so these new models can possibly be added as actual weapons instead of micro transactions.
---
Stuff that gives no material when scrapped shouldn't even have the scrap option
---
A behemoth usually spawns between Pylon v13 and bogtown, mind the possible scorchbeasts though
---
Chills?
---
I'm going to take you up on that offer! Thanks so much. My psn is RealKingChicken (I own a farm) and I'm hoping to get online tonight
---
chicken royale? are you british or french, donde don’t they cal quarter pounders royales
---
Oo thanks that's pretty useful. I never really thought about just swapping in an out like that. The things I use constantly could stay but I dont craft that much ammo. I hate swapping cards bc the ui is so clunky but for times when I hardly use those perks that can be useful. Thank you!
---
Yes you can others can build the shady shack for you, but not the display case. It’s an atom shop exception
---
It would stop people trying to charge 20000 for a 2 start dinner knife... but will never happen.  Nice thought though.
---
It’s very similar to the gauss rifle. If you’re already a rifleman, just get one of those.
---
If you use vats, though, gauss rifle/pistol hit rate is terrible.
---
Liberty Prime is online.
---
Thanks for the offer. I'll take you up on it! I'm going to try and get things set up a bit first so I'm not just dead weight. I'm RealKingChicken on PSN
---
It didnt contain any swears which annoyed me because I use expletives in messages with my friends all the time and they've playfully reported me with out me getting banned but this time was 2 days after I joined the ambassadors program and I cant reapply for at least 2 years because of it and it's likely I wont get accepted if I do re apply and you cant appeal the report for review, it's just a broken system.
---
Why should I scrap the melee perks? I use melee as a backup for things like assultrons or different situations. 
---
I dont play bloodied but I usually have like 25% rads before I heal. I figured a little bit of damage helps. What would yu recommend I use as a backup? 
---
Thabk you for the input it helps a lot. You guys know what you're doing.
---
Someone previously mentioned the wall decorations to me. This last time I moved, I did have that huge Whitespring wall clock in my workshop near the ceiling where the panels meet. But, I don't know how legit that is either, since the front of my powerhouse has the mothman effigy in effectively the same place but on the outside. I wish they'd loosen some of the rules that govern building in the game a bit to mitigate these issues a bit.
---
Take em and run!!!
---
It's probably someone being nice though.
---
Great write up. Thank you!
---
I think they should just remove destructible camps entirely. If they did that they could easily add a hefty chunk to our build budget.
---
Before you go publishing "your findings", just know we saw the Angry Turtle videos, too.
---
I should have put that in the post too, yes I agree. Of course a nuke should obliterate a camp. You're given ample opportunity to move/leave if you want to save your camp.
---
It's almost always the higher level players and they're  not always alone.  At this point if they don't visit my vendors then they're not there for them and are clearly there to cause mischief, I just swap servers now.
---
If you’re scared of being banned don’t be. You’ll be fine, just take them &amp; enjoy the caps you get.
---
I check this out every week, super useful! Thank you!
---
I call her Mama Mumbles and always treat her politely, give her friendly emotes and whatnot. She’s been really generous with me a few time.

---
Per: long shot can be swapped out for the picklocks and glow sight
---
Int: Gunsmith can be dropped completely if wanted, (just make sure you have enough to equip the crafting perks you want). First aid goes well with borne survivor
---
Just my thoughts.
---
I can only dream of lvl 13 atm. I'm going to go through some story missions and level up so I'm not dead weight. But I will take you up on the offer. I'm RealKingChicken on PSN
---
I saw a vendor with 100 in it and was Soo close to buying but I have all the plans from that pool so far.
---
Grab and run, then dispose of what you don’t need
---
I don't even use legendaries because I've never found any that are actually good.
---
What's the big deal about them? I can still play the game perfectly fine without them.
---
You can also try and ask for someone with high karma over on the trading sub to help you transfer.
---
I’m pretty positive that was a viral story that lead to him being found, fired, and charged with crimes. I’m too lazy to google and that was AT LEAST like 5 years ago.
---
I'm happy to finally have access to the Vault tech stairs!
---
...then proceed to Charlottesville Capitol Building to get a Governers seal. Return and wait on the Watoga beauracracy bots to process your form (while being attacked by a Scorchbeast horde). Then and only then will you have authorized tent placement.
---
You should move your tent as many times as possible, in the smallest increments. 
---
Fuck that dude, and fuck his brainwashed friend too.
---
That shag carpet doesn't even look like a shag carpet, it's a very very very low resolution texture with no bump mapping!
---
Yeah for sure! Why party boy? What would you reccomend with luck? So many things from that tree seem useful
---
I remember when I was also 9 and thought verbal threats of losing everything you loved was the way to get what you wanted.
---
TY for your testing, OP! I'm doing a full health PA build using core assembly rather than emergency protocol with a bloodied build. I felt like wearing 2 pieces of AP Regen armor pieces is almost par to a core assembly combined with a well tuned bonus. It's good to know the core assembly really was actually doing a great job when I'm in PA.
---
Would a long standing member on here not help you out?  I mean,  if they're on here and have been for a while then they're probably well known.  If they rob you then everyone can then grief them when you report back.  It'd ruin the gabe for them forever that way so they wouldn't risk it.
---
I think this the same case of the Pride Months, I wuold buy something new on that theme
---
I’m pretty sure it was closer to a decade ago...
---
 which means it happened in the early 2000s... right? Right??
---
Not about real ones but the flat woods monster is a zetan in almost there version of PA
---
Report anytime someone uses foul language. They get comm banned...
---
Gives you a chance to insult using alternatives.
---
I personally use quotes from Letterkenny.
---
losers want to min max everything and ended up getting legendary builds that one shot anything in the game so Bethesda had to start designing the whole game around these stupid legendaries.
---
That's why everything new is a bullet sponge
---
No I stay cause I really like the game, though i didn't get in til right before wastelanders. I love it for what it is but completely understand others frustrations, it's endgame has alot to be desired but I hit lvl 85 last night and have had fun farming Scochbeast Queen and Encrypted. Will move on to other activities soon.
---
r/Fallout76Settlements
---
Save the empire!
---
I’m level 95 and still don’t understand the combat rules in this game.
---
Nope,nope and nope. Bethesda wants to extend your play time as much as possible. You'll keep playing the game everyday to get scrip, you will keep your subscription and who knows, maybe buy some atomic points. If you got all the shit you wanted quickly there wouldn't be much point in playing any longer which means less profit for the big bois.
---
Games these days are just vehicles for making money.They will put no effort and man hours into something if there is no profit in it.
---
Just saw that you’re using handmade rifle. Switch out to commando if using an automatic version of the handmade.
---
Where is everyone finding this weapons case and tied up survivor?
---
Thanks. More people should do this for people who can’t get on.
---
It happened somewhere between 6 and 16 years ago
---
Whata wrong with intelligence? The perks to make my weapons break less seem pretty useful. What would you reccomend? Yeah I'm not too concerned with meta. Just want to have fun, build my camp and have people visit. I try to find cool shit in the wasteland to show off but things like assultrons bend me over and go in raw. I dont mind a challenge, in fact I want one but I want to be able to be able to complete it. As long as I can do that I'm happy, I dont need to 1 shot a sbq
---
Also siding with the raiders for the Vault raid actually helps foundation out more than it does the raiders!
---
I have the soundtrack to Fallout 3 &amp; 4 as a playlist on my phone and have it playing a lot when I’m out running errands or just driving to work.
---
One of these days those metal tents will be sold again.
---
there is some pretty good use of some low budget items. I don't see a garden. only 3 turrets, and plain ceiling lights and posters that illuminate a wide area. there is also evidence of some trickery going on with the fireplace sticking out of the roof. so? I would love to see what's in those locked rooms. It's cool on the outside, but not a lot of high budget bling going on. Some people are just really good at squeezing the budget.
---
That‘s more than perfect!
---
I‘m absolutely not interested in NW. But last week I saw a video showing all the rewards you can get there and I thought... oh well... seems you have to play it. I dig into some research and discovered that you get more XP for staying alive than making kills.
---
So what will I do next week when I dive into my first NW rounds? Hiding as much as possible to stay alive as long as possible. To hell with the gameplay and kills!
---
I want that rad, pink donut PA skin! 🤘🏻
---
That‘s how Bethesda wants me to play...
---
Gold plated .50 skin locked behind the entire raider bundle :(

---
I worded it badly but this is what I meant, thanks.
---
You really don't even have to create a new server. Dark souls PvE players get mad that they get forced PvP. But there's things that can be done to prevent it.
---
Take after dark souls - give players who option into pvp a statistic advantage. In ds - if you're embered - you get additional HP and you can be invaded (forced pvp) if you're not embered - you cannot be invaded. That or just make a part of the map - pvp oriented (maybe similar to the Raider quest line where you play in an arena but instead of killing other enemies - you fight other players)
---
I think separating the servers when the pvp player base is small - is not worth bethesdas time.
---
If you want to eliminate broken weapons from pvp - simply make it so only regular or 1 star weapons can be used in pvp. Everything else does not damage players.
---
I hate the idea of having to create a new pvp character.
---
🤦‍♂️
---
What if all atomic shop items amd bundles would Always be available for fallout 1st. Id love that.
---
well what loot did he drop you? could be a duper for all we know
---
Thanks everyone for all the responses and PM's. Although I spent a crazy amount of time on FO4, 76 feels like a whole new game to get use to. But man people are great. I went on late last night and pretty well everyone I passed gave me plans and loot. I had no camp, I was carrying too much, and all I had for a weapon was an empty pipe pistol and a board. Then I was swarmed by a bunch of toads that my board was completely useless against. I discovered the 'help' gesture and someone came over, killed everything and left me a modded combat rifle. Loving the game so far!
---
Then this is a great mod to add

A YouTuber who does mostly horror content, but has a very... Unique voice. I would say it's pretty unpleasant, but he's got a bit of a following. He did the burger king foot lettuce thing in a video I think, and his odd way of speaking is what helped made it a meme.
---
I just want that damn thanksgiving display. I'll never ask for anything ever again Bethesda pleaseeeeee
---
yea thats true
---
I can confirm. Got banned for 2 weeks back in the day on Black Ops 3 lobby chat.
---
Is his friends dad also Bill Gates? Because, like, that Microsoft threat has me rolling.
---
Yeah that’s what one would think right? But they do it among them because when I grabbed the bag I got insulted and they rage quit because of that
---
Curing her headaches should stop her from complaining about headaches.

I really wanted her to be my main ally, but her ever-repeating lines made me get rid of her quick.
---
Stop! You've violated the law!

You only get decent things from her if you can say her name properly.  
---
I can't.  I call her mumraar.. like out of thundercats... and all she gives me is filthy looks and crappy guns.
---
I had a strange encounter too yesterday, I was fighting this colossus in OG Grove, suddenly the nuke zone dissipated and puff the colossus vanished into thin air, so I thought this thing can ONLY exist in nuked area.
---
That’s their problem.  
---
They can trade one-to-one. They can possibly use private servers. 
---
Bags are open to all. If they get pissed then  that’s their stupidity.
---
So basically bring survival back just because?
---
It left for a reason. Just bringing it back isn't good enough.
---
 What does she look like?  ... and what's she wearing 😉
---
That's stupid. Sort of how the karma syringer affects players? Anyways, the items need to get fixed to be used for its intended purposes.
---
Lmao I have a Yao Guai at my camp named Diego who is slaughtered by visitors everyone he spawns as a legendary
---
Had this exact same thing happen on Forza... Forza of all games. This guy tried Pit-maneuvering me on the last lap, he missed and went straight into the wall at full speed. He used every piece of profanity under the sun in his messages, even saying that I cheated and that he would look up my address online. Me being the passive person I am I ignored him, didn’t message him back, and reported him for using profanity. Forgot he existed, two months later he messages me calling me more names and mentioning that I’m the reason he got Com banned. Reported him again and blocked him lol. 
---
I’m curious if it’s possible for people to get permanently com banned on their first offense? Hopefully Microsoft actually reviews the severity of messages and assesses if it is deserving of a perma ban. 
---
But then again when has Xbox live not been toxic? Lmao
---
I have several Gauss Pistols and they're very powerful with the gunslinger perks. I'm not a VATS user, if that matters.
---
Edit: I also use other perks to maximize my damage output and mutations, like Adrenal Reaction. The results are devastating, especially when combined with stealth.
---
My thoughts on this isses:
---
They need to change the events in the way if it fails, everyone looses all drops/xp collected during the event. So people would not mess around but make sure it is done (like SBQ the real reward drops from her so everyone does the best they can, I'm yet to see that event to fail).
---
But they also need to update the reward for the other events.
---
Because RR atm is an XP farming event due to the fact the the event reward is not worth it compared to the drop from the endless wave of ghouls, xp and legendaries (it is an issue for me because I don't have the plans from the event but I understand the reason at least).
---
OVN is a fun event but at the end always there is 8 people sitting outside the door to kill the boss instead of letting it in to give a shoot to everyone. They should make the boos only appear if everyone inside the event boundaries still playing an instrument until the boss reaches the door.
---
Actually I have never had any issue with Free Range, there is always people herding and healing the brahmins, I don't think there is an issue there.
---
Encryptid became like this because most player is bloodied build and don't know/care how to tank the pylons damage. I think the event is fine just need the above update.
---
I could be lucky but PP also usually works fine when I'm playing it there probably the biggest issue it requires a lot of people and there is no proper way to communicate with each other especially if you are in a different habitat.
---
Now of course there is a chance that if they would implement this feature the same would happen like fasnach and griefers would try to destroy events. That is a reality sadly and have no idea at the current state of the game how it could be fixed.
---
Oh I’m talking about the Nuclear winter mode.
---
Love the idea! I do this with some friends. Naked no perk cards level 5 boards and nukashines! Kill each other before you black out
---
Ya, better off with gauss rifle.  Gauss pistol biggest drawback is that it’s a pistol.
---
What the hell is an SMF?
---
Even 3000 is nothing, someone said he got 7000 from a guy in a trade for something. Bethesda’s alarm is probably set at a million.
---
Ahh. So he's about as intelligent as the guy dressed in 1st gear who kept shooting at me at one of the legendary exchange machines because I didn't get off the instant he arrived. Almost messaged them to say that I also have 1st and if they're in that much of a rush, they should have used their private server instead.
---
Nice didn’t know that existed.
---
Just players being bored, jerks, trying to invoke PvP, or some combination of those.

I mean, Liberty Prime isn't wrong.

What they NEED is the ability to tag anything and everything as a favorite or protected item. It's also way too easy to accidentally drop something when you're trying to pull up perks to swap them.

Store you junk, ask them to follow you, go their camp, start pvp and orbital strike!  Dont know if it would work but at least it isnt in your camp anymore.

According to patch notes, in October of last year they added AA to energy weapons but it looks like it’s mostly laser rifles. I tested my teams rifle and plasma rifles and they worked just fine. Both AA plus tank killer.  Laser rifles definitely aren’t calculating their damage right though.

It's the internet, you can say fucker.

This is the safest way if you have no friends they will maybe charge a few caps

My brother's friend's best friend's cousin's uncle's best friend works at Bethesda, he'll ban you from all Bethesda games, including the singleplayer ones!
