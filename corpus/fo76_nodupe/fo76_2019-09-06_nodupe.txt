Lol. Love it!
---
---
---
There's surprisingly few ghouls or enemies that spawn in the caverns where the ore is at, no one wants to miss out on those LVL 35 legendaries, tho.
---
Agreed. It's hard not to judge them when you've seen the BoS in all the other games.
---
Thanks for the info. Yeah, the only good shit I’ve ever found from them is the ammo scrap.
---
Valt 76 in the atrium
---
Travel agent is maxed at one.
---
You can pry my stash of clothes from my cold dead hands! Lol
---
I am going to do the smart thing and clean out the notes and holotapes.
---
I will try to remember that.  It was very difficult to see the pungi boards so I didn't think of a picture of that.  But I did picture his name and location so I will remember if I come across it again.  And I also learned a lesson.  It was the first time I've had something like this happen in a lot of hours, hence how easy it was to con me...so I guess I should count myself lucky it happens so infrequently.  At this point I am trying to spread the word to watch out.  I'm likely not the only one that died and lost stuff to him...doubt I will be the last either.  Just hoping to save a few people from the same fate.

---
I enjoy V33 Combat Shotguns. No explosive damage but:
---

---
A) still 1 shots and can do it from further away
---
B) 33 VATS cost is magic on shotguns and doesnt require the armor piece
---
I love this....I just assumed if I played enough I would catch all the diseases. Turns out I need to sleep on the floor and keep a mirelurk queen alive. Ha Ha Ha!
---
Little things like this make me love the game.
---
I just went to see if I could find one of the rare asylum outfits right after. 
---
And I found the yellow one lol. Not the most rare. But definitely not the most common either.
---
Good job
---
Would diluted stimpaks be good as well?
---
I carry both ultracite and excavator in my inventory and as long as I don't enter a PA work station I never see the power core animation I'm on xb1 fyi I also renamed and never add or remove things from the armor's inventory
---
I buy anything with the word psycho in it.
---
People still help me and im lvl 190 the community is always nice and helpful and giving
---
Yeah, I did have a mule with just plans and  clothing collection, I have known it take over 5 mins to get to the bottom. Thankfully I never have to touch him
---
Definitely!
---
Are you using wired earbuds or headset while charging your in-use controller from your PS4's USB ports? My audio goes really crazy when I do this. I have to turn off my controller and it clears right up.
---
Super stims not so much for me just because I’m a bloodied build but I’m sure other people would want them
---
I found 2 Cranberries in Point Pleasant. One in a machine one on the ground.
---
For some reason I thought you could upgrade it. Don't know what I was thinking lol. Thank you for the correction
---
I love that it feels like a real boss. The Scorched Queen does as well, to an extent but we all know how fast we can kill her especially when she doesn't have Wendigos defending her while they attack you.
---
Yeah, and crafting .308 gives you barely anything. And I'm constantly low on acid which means I'm constantly low on gunpowder as well.
---
Most of the griefers who do that stash the junk afterwards, even if you seek revenge you get nothing,besides unless its stable flux junk is easy to farm.
---
See, I never do anything to piss anyone off like that, but I still have my decon shower tucked away in my camp because I worry some very bored person might blow it up.
---
No they are saying to just not remove the fusion core from your inventory. Even after the fusion core is installed in your power armor it will show up with the rest under ammo.
---
Are you trying to put me out of business? I think I make most of my caps on disease cures, antibiotics, and addictol.
---
I mean New Vegas was them at their worst for sure, but the other games they were still neutral at worst 
---
Just flawed people being flawed
---
Yes, I always assumed that as long as the enemy was diseased, I could get any/all of them. 
---
Turns out each disease can only be obtained from certain enemies.
---
Yeah pretty much. You'd be surprised at how many people will for sport. There's really nothing to lose except if you bring junk into it. Maybe some caps. Not allot though
---
Oh trust, I like the Enclave's style much more, playing through Fallout 3 atm, real nice to be in a hellfire set without a butt plate problem.
---
But as the best two represented Power armor factions I try to embrace them all :)
---
It should have a mega boost. Like, +5 Charisma for two hours or something.
---
This is way overcomplicating it. Just go to that island NOT during the event. Click on the mirelurk eggs to make them hatch. Now you have three or four mirelurk spawns and nothing else. Kill the un-diseased ones and let the diseased ones harmlessly attack you until you get whoopsies. That’s it.
---
I hope they'll be cool.
---
That mostly depends on build and whether or not you use class freak.
---
The only way I could maintain the ammo supply was by switching to ultra cite. Although that can be expensive
---
Personally, Plague Walker is the one I never take, simply because the pros are far inferior to the cons. The other two AOE mutations aren’t ones I tend to use either. 
---
Other than that, it depends on your build. For example:  you probably want to avoid Twisted Muscles if you’re exclusively a ranged character, for example.  But on a melee build?  Well worth it. 
---
With Class Freak 3, you significantly reduce the downsides of most mutations. 
---
Side note: Herd Mentality is the new ‘gotta have’, since it works even if you’re on a solo team.
---
They all have their pros/cons to each build honestly. 
---
And some people just like being irradiated/mutated little freaks on the wasteland. /s
---
Crater, the settlers are boring
---
You just want to run around naked, don't you?
---
(Well so do I) Good job!
---
Oh absolutely. The only downside to that is if all of them turn out to not be diseased. Now you can’t get more unless you server hop. 
---
But with the queen you have an endless supply. 
---
Thank you for the input, I’m sure low level players wouldn’t want to go right the queen for that, so any low level areas would work best.
---
I, personally, am not a fan of Plague Walker and I don't have the melee/unarmed ones but only because I dont use melee/unarmed. I think I have all the others.
---
Its called “seek revenge”
---
Everyone calls it a bug, it’s not. The only bug is the range being extended after modding it during that session. It’s supposed to decrease in range after you mod it with the short ranged nozzles
---
Plot-twist: They steal your loot?  They are now a Wanted Player for 3000 Caps.
---
Never worked for me, ever. When I think I need to buy something to dress up a weapon or part of the camp, oops not available, then when it shows up again in store three months later my impulse was gone or weapon sold, no need to spend atom on something I no longer need. This sales strategy is very dated and works poorly in online environment especially when the game relies so much on RNG. Make your stuff always available and put purchase option in all available items’ mod menus, and watch your sales skyrocket. You’re welcome.
---
I think this event can be run quite successfully with two non gatherers and two gatherers.  if the non gatherers are able to each suppress their end and not let any of the mobs up into the main area then the more rad resistant two people can focus on gathering. I really think division of labor is the key to this not a free-for-all with everyone trying everything.  We achieved max ore and no dead workers today simply by the two of us who were not rad resistant guarding the entrances and the two of us in power armor gathering ore.  Success here has less to do with people not collecting as it does with labor not being divided effectively.
---
I remember posting the exact same thing over a year ago and being downvoted into oblivion.
---
Technically you're not naked, you have armor on, the pieces are just broken and having at least a Psycho addiction means you will be able to use any shielded armor you want so the -DR and +DR cancel out so you have 0.
---
What are you doing, step-assaultron?
---
'Thank you, Come again!'
---
(I'm joking. That sucks)
---
How do you do it with fallout 1st?
---
well it depends on how much effort you want to put in. I spent 150 hours over 2 months searching for a red aslyum uniform which is one of the rarest items in the game. Never found one but found plenty of the other colours and made sick money from that. Search asylum uniforms on youtube for a guide. takes maybe 2 minutes per check.
---
You can make money by flipping stuff. Buy low sell high. learn what stuff sells for and be able to spot a bargain in a vendor.
---
This site gives you a rough idea if something is worth caps. https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=None&amp;effects=None
---
Yeah I have no idea what the hell I should do with all this ammo now. At least I hopefully made someone's day lol.
---
What does the winner get? Anything cool? Could bet caps or ammo perhaps. Could be fun.
---
Exactly my situation.
---
I came from ark and the difference in the community is insane, I always expect to ENJOY interactions instead of assuming it’s a troll or bait account. One of my best mates is a player who I met via becoming wanted after stealing the junk out of his collectron station. This is the vibe.
---
I feel silly for not playing this game sooner but from what I gather the wastelanders update is what really made it what it is now, if you are on the fence I went from just assuming it wasn’t worth my time or money, to being a first subscriber. And I’m one of the new Vegas fanboys that boycotted it at first.
---
Miley Cyrus virus
---
I hope it is powerful enough to allow this happen. I am tired of using the stealth suit everytime I enter the nuke zone.
---
There’s a few benefits to a new character.  
---
You have the option to log in and play a totally different style.
---
You have 1000 more scrip for Purveyor sales.
---
You have extra space to store gear and other items.
---
The downside is that you have to level it up, gear it up and repeat the quests and grinds that are important to you.  Overall, I see alts and mules as very beneficial, but 2020 has given me a lot of free time to put into the game.
---
If u ever step foot in RR its solely for loot. A chance at 3+ legenderies or some caps n random loot. I will always choose the former lol.
---
They are not. They are doing sneaky things like I may or may not be guilty of: Selling items that seem important but are actually worthless.
---
The broken armor part is the hardest to maintain. I wish there’s mannequin so we can put our armors on it and shoot it down to 1% condition, then walk by firecracker berries or something.
---
Yea I hear Galileo was killed for thinking the earth wasn't the center of the universe ahead of his time too
---
So basically a drugged out semi-naked wastelander?
---
I can get behind this freaky kinda stuff...
---
Ridin' Shotgun is another one that I actually enjoy doing. I'd rather do that one solo. I had two instances lately where I began that event, and another player showed up, and just made a beeline to the center chamber. They don't participate in protecting the caravan at all.  So, the last time I hung around long enough to see if my suspicions of what was about to happen actually happened, and sure enough, this person just waited there to kill the legendary as soon as they appeared. The last time that happened, I said fuck it and hopped to another server and started the event again. It's either this happening or someone gets all in a hurry to open up the gate when the brahmin aren't healed up yet or all of the crates haven't been found. It's not a lot, but 120 caps are about 3 trips across the length and width of the entire map.
---
I often have to mute and then unmute whoever is in area to get it to work.
---
Honestly, just give it to some random low level. At least this way you can make two people happy as a result of this misfortune. You never know, Karma might come around and help you out.
---
Isn't there a camp item coming with daily ops for disease curing
---
A scout mask LOL.  Can’t get my hands on one, seems everyone wants a bloodied explosive weapon in return...
---
Then server crashes before you pick it up
---
my handy guide to lost home btw 
---

---
Rank one should allow people in PA and hazmat suits take no rads at all.
---
As I said previously not everything has been figured out however i could most likely give some sort of reward most likely junk or ammo.
---
Hard but worth it in the end. People stray away from Berzerkers because they assume you have to be completely armorless which is a lie.
---
With Bloody you need to be at 19% health, Junkie's you need at least 5 addictions, Berzerkers you need 5 pieces of broken armor.
---
Each build needs a con for the pro, Bloody is just easier to achieve.
---
Works great on wendigos though
---
I only saw one before Emmett mountain disposal site got the radiation rumble event
---
If you are on Xbox, then as I have explained above.
---
 https://imgur.com/qNqDRgD
---
Yeah I'm by the wayward so sometimes I get low levels and I give them a bunch of stuff. Maybe I'll just put it up for zero caps in my vendor and let someone do something with it.
---
Toxic valley one is super easy to craft
---
Hey, the benefits are that you can use any level armor piece and armor pieces of any type since you are not worried about stats - so collect those skimpy leather armor pieces!
---
that I did not know.  Given I finished the season and dont really need levels, will have to give it a whirl just for grins :)
---
When is it? Because that would be hella fun
---
You're basically Zombieman from One Punch Man, they'll keep knocking you down and you'll keep getting back up. If death can't defeat you, what can?
---
If you use guns only stay away from melee like talons.   
---
If you use a bloody PA tank stay away from speed demon less food and drinking needed and you get no extra benefit if running emergency protocols.   
---
Plague was way to OP when the game first released that they nerfed it into a sad pathetic waste of a mutation. Chameleon is pretty pointless but doesn't hurt if you get it or have it.   
---
If you are into XP hunting go herbivore over carnivore the relish is simple to make and the food options are plentiful overall. I tend to stay away from the on hit ones as I find them more annoying than useful myself.
---
Ugh, I have it from the Atom shop but can't recall the exact name.
---
Found it.... https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Roadtripper_blouse_and_capris
---
I do like that SE allows the entire server to join in which feels like a little party now with all the lunchboxes but ACP feels like a badass mission.
---
I think in fo4 it was a 1 in 1000  chance with 1 luck and considerably better with higher luck
---
I have no clue about fo76 but I run a 11 luck build and  rarely interact with the machine I got a perfectly preserved pie in the first 100 hours of play which was probably the 20-30th attempt
---
Im waiting for more people to join this and ill also have to figure it out with my buddy along with the rules and how were gonna communicate. (keep in mind me and my buddy came up with this today and have never done anything like this)
---
I don't know about the easiest chem addiction is pretty simple pop 3-5 in a row and boom done. No more eating crap if you die to get your rads back down just get high once and crave and done.
---
Tbh, I thought this was intentionally added in because from what I heard, there seemed to be a huge issue because there were so many people jacking flux as the event ended. Whether or not the "function" was on purpose, it's annoying as hell but at least has deterred people from trying to steal flux at each event like so.
---
I bought all except egg head, herbivore, empath., bird bones and the melee one. Plague Walker was the first one I got from rads and then I started perfecting my bloodied build and getting all of them. Except those couple.
---
Yea, I think the biggest downside to this build will be the nuked zones. You will have to equip PA or sealth suit which will auto unequip all the damaged armor pieces. So you then have to redamage them later...
---
Am I the only one that gets these every ~1/10 attempts?
---
Totally true, good job putting the guide together! 👍
---
Sigh, why did you empty my vendors of asylum outfits, bobbleheads and magazines....and everything else you keep collecting? 
---
That green and brown outfits have been sat there for a month at those prices. 
---
Thanks for the 7000 caps, and the 40 odd bobbleheads I bought from your camp. That will lose me 400 caps to resell.
---
Stop buying things for minimal gains. You bought all my bobbleheads to try and corner the market. That's not cool man, just because you have every type in your machines. I know for sure you have all the asylum outfits...you were wearing the red one when I saw you.
---
I am too terrified of Yao Guais to ask.
---
Nope, I have 12 from just my trips to the rusty pick in the last month.
---
It’s always dropped nothing but 1 star weapons and armor for me.
---
Everybody has a different experience, but not so much in mine. I can't sell RadShield for 5 caps, which is boggling with how good it is, the profit margin that would give resellers, and the annoyance of acquiring the key ingredient.
---
If you do a lot of runs thru nuke zones, it would be worth investing in a mutation serum recipe. Use Super Duper while crafting and sell the serums for 200-450 caps each. Yes, for less than what NPCs will give you for them. You'll make caps as fast as you can craft them, while you can really only sell 2 a day to NPCs. Resellers bring you caps FAST, and even rich players still buy serums they have no use for occasionally if the profit margin is high enough.
---
Hopefully they find out how to fix it, it is almost unusable without having to run up right next to the enemy.
---
The ammo one. It’s going to be amazing as long as they don’t change it
---
Great shot!
---
Where exactly are you located at? I think it's time to move my base.
---
Sometimes you’ll find X-01 Box mods in the armory vendor, but the mod plans will always be in the production vendor.
---
Better than a pat on the back! lol
---
You mean to try to solo it? 
---
I saw a video where a guy did that, but after trying what he suggested - everyone was dead in under 2 minutes. I *almost* got the 25 ore, I would've needed.
---
Also the Midwestern Chapter actually recruited Super Mutants!
---
I love paying it forward.  Saw a 70ish player earlier at his base, showing folks where his shop was (oddly located, move it bro).  I figured maybe he needs caps, so bought 5k worth of goods then passed back to him.  Later, saw bunch of 20ish folks at a base, with all their bases near each other.  Assumed they were new and working together; got their attention and cleared out about 20 rares from my inventory.
---
Was sweet seeing them jumping around me in excitement.
---
About 20 minutes ago some 23 level messaged asking if I had 36 screws for sale.  I did the math, and such a specific number probably means most his armor is broken and he is scrounging around.  Gave him 70ish screws before porting off to fight back more Mutant scum.
---
probably a high ass mip skip.
---
#**16X DA DETAIL!**
---
You are the third person to say that. I did not die to pvp. Just killed by poison after event or something that made health go 100 to 0 idk.
---
The level up UI is trash, you have to read that tiny text at the bottom of your screen.
---
The first stat you click on gets the point. Your perk choice does not affect this.
---
SPECIAL isn't upgraded based on the perk you chose, it's a totally separate step in levelling. So if you clicked Perception on the first level up screen and then filtered over to the Luck perks, what you did is upgraded perception and then chose the Starched Genes perk.
---
Once you're past level 50 you can choose to spend a level reallocating a SPECIAL point, so you can spend two levels moving points from PER to LCK.  There's no level cap so you aren't screwed.
---
Pop a Rad X and Radshield Nuke zones don't deal a lot of Rad like Rad Rumble. Very manageable especially if you run full health. If your health dips a little pop a Radaway, Nuke zones are hell for Bloody, you dont need to be low health for Berzerkers.
---
It sure does, I was doing 200+ crits on the wendigo colossus and 400-600 on the regular wendigos with my bloodied flamer.
---
are you sure you scrolled all the way to luck when placing the point?
---
Having seen people in these sort of games rush the end game stuff, and then be upset about not having content, I agree with you 100%. However we're also about to get more new content, with the BoS around the corner. That means one of a few things;
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
* New content uses GB somehow. Now new players have even MORE GB to grind, and the old cap doesn't make sense.
---
* New content DOESN'T use GB, and uses something else. Now players have two currencies to grind (Gold Bullion and whatever BoS tokens are, be they Dog Tags, Commendations, w/e)
---
Either way, it seems like the old end game content needs to be more accessible. I'd say just trim the costs down on all the old Gold Bullion stuff. That way if you revisit it later, you can just add the new content at 'regular' prices, and the old plans stay at 'legacy content' prices. And either way, you move the mentality of "It's end game content, its supposed to be time consuming" to whatever the NEW end game content is.
---
jesus how did i make it this far and never see that, fuck i feel stupid
---
thank you for the answer, i guess ill just have to respec at 50+
---
I have to mute the game at times.  When in trying to look through a players inventory, or carefully scrap items.  I need to concentrate.    
---
DO DOO DOO DO DOO DOO.  Floating in space forever.  *plays same 3 second guitar loop for one minute straight.  Heeee howww here howww heeeeee.  I just like songs, don't you? 
---
Add some ear defenders to the atom shop XD
---
I have over 300 at 300 the game prevents you picking up any more as an anti duping measure so I had to stash them so i could collect more
---
I already told you that’s not the glitch, it’s supposed to have a low range
---
Yeh I've only seen that a few times and that's when someone has a camp near a good-to-nuke spot.
---
And what I meant was like someone going out of their way to nuke/destroy a players base directly. Versus as a casualty of location.
---
Ammo convert or, tell get you like 200 308’s
---
I’m not helping am I lol
---
My crippling anxiety and hope for finding love in the wasteland.
---
I got 100 scrip as well. And when you're not expecting it 100 scrip is awesome!
---
I don’t have turrets and get attacked every time I fast travel to my camp.
---
Personally I enjoyed the Raiders one better. Did both, though, and Foundation is decent too.
---
Yeah I sell them for 25 caps at my CAMP just to destroy the market for dicks selling them for 1000+ caps.
---
I had this problem also try getting another disease while you have sludge lung.
---
Fun fact, you can get one from on top of the west tech building.
---
i bought them as i nearly had max caps. A lot of the time i am just buying things because i have caps to burn. Outfits and plans are goods to buy as they weigh almost nothing. And usually someone like me comes to my camp and they buy loads of stuff because they have caps to burn. And then at some point i'll be at their camp doing the same., It's the circle of life. 
---
I should also add i often buy things i know i am gonna sell for less. I have no problem making caps from serums and weapons/armour i find.
---
Mappalachia has you covered
---
https://i.imgur.com/yqFfuHa.jpg
---
After a bunch of tries I just assumed it never worked so I stopped trying. Then I randomly gave it a shot months later and got lucky. Now I try every time.
---
Sadly, if they do fix it, it will permanently stay that way. That melee reach seems to be the intended one for vaporization nozzles
---
I just sell my surplus to vendors. decent caps.
---
Same.  I really enjoy it when random players help each other out, then we give each other the thumbs up and go our separate ways.
---
Yea I love when that happens
---
&gt;Do better how when I have 4-10 things attacking me and while I’m one tapping them I’m still getting hit.
---
Never put yourself in a position when you're facing 4-10 things at once.
---
If you're still working on your perks, then it's just a work in progress. However, how you approach engagements matters a lot and that comes with experience.
---
For instance, you could easily break up a group of 6 into 2 groups of 3 or 3 groups of 2, depending on how many you can kill before they notice. You kill whatever many you can without them noticing, disengage and either flank them from a different angle if they haven't found you or duck behind a wall/passage/cover etc. and wait for them to come to you and then you're picking them off 1 or 2 at a time.
---
You're welcome.
---
Like I said, Dunning-Kruger effect.
---
I just swap mine in and out.  What draws you to master infiltrator?  I can't see any real benefit other than saving 20 seconds.  It's a great luxury perk.  But there are others that have more value in terms of damage and protection
---
One wasteland Gonna make gifting low levels guns near impossible im the big sad
---
On the other hand when you're next expecting it you might only get 34 like me, lol.
---
I understand, but you still have to be pretty much in melee range for it to work. I just think it needs a tiny buff to the range, not a lot just a bit.
---
It's like wtf, you're fucking level higher than the legendaries, use something else, I honestly don't get it.
---
Earle
---
Yea bro I was level 23 and I was fighting a legendary lvl 76 Yao guai and some Jackass started killing everyone with a Tesla rifle it’s like dude wtf
---
I got rid of my ammo converted ages ago. Was taking up too much space lol.
---
There’s a reason why I keep a Flamer on hand for events like this
---
I’d love to play. Sounds fun. GT: CC_OG_949
---
Nice, thx for the tip :)
---
Shhhh ;)
---
One thing World of warcraft did brilliantly in the last expansion was that if you started grinding artifact power it reduced how much you needed the later you started doing it. So let's just say you needed 10000 AP in week one to hit a level you would only need 5000 if you were doing it 2 months later. Eventually you would catch up to your other characters/friends
---
maybe they could give more rep and a bit more bullion each week. To help newer players and people doing alts.
---
*shrugs*
---
But seriously, it's more like you are level 500+ and you sit and spray with your legacy flamer and do not contribute any ore.
---
Competing for Uranium Fever legendaries, or as the Bethesda devs like to call it, "endgame PvP."
---
I deliberately try and only hit enemies during low level Events with my explosive 50 cal’s splash damage.
---
I agree with lucky hole. I make a run every other week maybe as it gets me about 300+ lead ore a run. As for acid, I typically recommend going to Tanagra town(east of Harper's Ferry). There are usually several cave crickets that spawn and each gives a nice bit of acid. Another option is to keep killing various bugs and the yao guai at dolly sodds(or however you spell it). Campfire tales is a good one as tons of bloodbugs spawn and there's typically a high chance of getting the proboscis every kill.
---
(On another note, since I don't have 1st, I prefer to keep acid/lead ore in my stash instead of lead because the two weigh as much as bulked lead and if you're using super duper, you're getting even more lead)
---
Whatever you do, don’t sell x50 copies of mounted plans...for the love of Atom.
---
I hope they make some of them killable like the settlers and the raiders.
---
You’re asking too much from Bethesda tbh.
---
👍
---
I keep a mule at Mama Mole's just to roll level 1 armor for my Berserker. 
---
With a psycho and/or med x addiction I can repair my armor as needed and maintain 0 or near 0 DR whilst keeping the option to use my hazmat suit.
---
Is this better than Map76?
---
They made it slightly more effective like a month ago
---
I went to store my junk in stash (not 1st) the only thing it didn't store was the ultracite cause of how much there was and since it won't store ANY if it can't store ALL I thought it went in cause I had 5 pounds free space.
---
500 hours into my main character, tried every single time I went to the purveyor never got it with 10 luck. Started a new toon, 4 luck, 3rd try....wtf!?
---
Or just go one up in luck the next time and pick the perk you want from a different category and try and even it out
---
ohhh oki
---
I once came across 4500 .45 ammo in a camp for 3 caps a peice I offered to buy it all directly from the guy for 1 apiece and he gladly took me up on it and now my character is obese
---
I’d be down, gives me something to do other than dailies and whatnot.
---
Is a mic needed? Psn the same as username.
---
There some be some incentive to stay mutation free imo.
---
What
---
oh man I didnt even know I could do that lol I've been doing it all wrong, feel dumb for posting this but I think I can level up better now. Thanks!
---
It’s up to you, they all have a downside so it depends on your build.
---
Point Pleasant for me.
---
But then people can’t be on teams as it shows their position.
---
A mic would most likely not be needed and ill most likely be starting a chat with everyone who is interested.
---
Bend and snap!
---
It's ok. That amount of anti social behaviour, selfishness and lack of self awareness probably leads them to living a sad life. They probably have a small pee pee too.
---
I wouldn't let it bother you and if you feel that you're entitled to that legendary, you're just not. No one is.
---
Until Bethesda fixes issues like this by directly tying event rewards to its success/completion as a group and not as individuals, it is what it is. It's not a player issue, it's a Bethesda one.
---
As the other person said, the UI is super wonky. I didn’t realize that until I was well over level 100 and started a new character.
---
I can't speak for the guy you are talking about but I do by mistake sometimes kill legendaries with 1 shot, unless people are being dicks and not repairing or guarding the extractors. Then I go full bloodied with a quad fixer and 1 shot everything.
---
Ammo is heavy for some one who only ever keeps like 80lbs free
---
?  You don't mine ore or anything.  It's automatic.
---
press alt and f4 rapidly while the game is loading
---
I realised on one of my first runs as everyone started running around like headless chickens everytime it was said over the loud speaker
---
Better late than never though
---
Yep now just hope you have cool event mates and they don’t crush it before you can get a few shots off
---
At the end of the day it's an in game item that doesn't exist, it's just like why did I even bother coming here if you're just gonna instant kill everything?
---
Yeah I dump all my missiles and nukes into and get a couple of drums of 308 a week normally
---
If you're unlucky enough to get stuck on the respawn screen after you get outside the mine because the nuke storm or a mole miner killed you... just hold the respawn key down. Eventually it will bring the map up.
---
It might be fine for some ppl or builds, but when I got Healing Factor, I started experiencing a recurring travel bug. I'd try to teleport, a timer would pop up for a split second, and then disappear/cancel as if I hit ESC. I read about some temporary fixes like moving a certain distance away or eating something. In the end, I decided to remove the mutation so I didn't have to deal with it at all.
---
Plague Walker doesn't currently have downsides. It also doesn't work as intended(disease timers still remove diseases normally). I'm currently running it on my melee character, it will not aggro neutral NPCs. It will do what I'll call Fake Damage with no diseases: criters like chickens and hostile NPCs will vocalize damage but lose no health and it will not aggro critters. It is quite weak due to how difficult it is to acquire multiple diseases simultaneously, but there is functionally no downside to it.
---
Come join me..gt ogEwaBoyI7... I'll give you one
---
I never considered dumping my junk before going to camps! One silver lining, I guess is, now I will! I've been fortunate enough to not encounter too many douches in the game, but your post &amp; the comments will help me be prepared! :) Sorry this happened to you, I'm mostly a solo player &amp; just for fun, so I can definitely see how this would sour the mood!
---
I feel personally attacked by this comment
---
Electrically charged, plague walker, unstable isotope
---
You messing with me or not?
---
hey! could you possibly join me? I have a private world going on rn with some workshops. my gt is RiotRuth#6576
---
Works 80 percent of the time, 60 percent of the time.
---
That makes sense. You could also de-grind it a bit by turning 200/day into 1,500/Week. The change to people grinding like nuts won't be different, but more casual players would have a much easier time.
---
It’s a little bit of a bummer though considering you can almost always get one off of the roof of the West tek research center
---
I'm def into something like this
---
K
---
Dont have one for you sorry, buy I wouldn't bother with it anyway. For some reason when ever me or someone like me comes to your camp the brahmin "mysteriously" die
---
They really want that level 35 Rolling Pin
---
I hate it when they don't even charge it and fire it on sight three times in a row
---
Yeah, I just wish they would buff the range just a tad, a ranged weapon that requires you to be in melee just doesn't make sense.
---
I think they meant "more"
---
In 1300 hours ive gotten 6 from the machine, in fo4 2200 hours i just got my first 2 days ago.
---
EVERYBODY has made this same mistake. I did it on my newest character even knowing it! Trashy UI is trashy.
---
Says we have to be on team
---
lol ok
---
There is ore in there? or is it a reward?
---
In fo4 i have max luck and have gotten 1 in 2200 hours.
---
That was my experience at Uranium Fever last night.  Someone in PA and explosive high powered weapon instantly blasting the legendary as I waved everyone over.  Then they wouldn’t wave anyone over when they spotted a legendary.  Afterwards for some reason they proceeded to swat at me with an axe after I was done scrapping all my loot.  Ran into them again at heart of the swamp... still in PA...also shot at me afterwards for no reason.
---
So what happens when I do the alt f4 thing
---
[deleted]
---
we have to be on each other's friends list.
---
I don't remember exactly but the tunnels deal significantly more radiation than going into a nuked zone. You can go with PA but a hazmat suit or the chinese stealth suit is your best bet. Also, excavator doesn't increase the amount of ore you get for the event. I tried because like OP said, no one else grabs ore. You need at least 2-3 people constantly grabbing ore in order to get tier 4 simply because the veins don't respawn fast enough.
---
Not just me then.
---
I do exactly the same these days.
---
Kill the Queen then get right out of the way.
---
Lost too much flux being sucker punch killed looting the Queen.
---
I think all players learn the hard way.
---
That would be nice
---
How do you get the greens? I ended up with some as well but I have no idea what made it happen.
---
Best part was I don't think they even grabbed the loot, so they were legit just shooting them and wasting the legendaries.
---
You're thinking of radiation rumble.
---
Quad multiplies the base weapon capacity before the magazine mod adds it's increased capacity. So the added amount from a mag mod doesn't get multiplied by quad.
---
That's also why a quad handmade with a drum doesn't hold 120 like you'd expect.
---
Just take workshops. It’s a common plan drop
---
In the reward chest just inside the mine exit
---
I've been doing that 😂
---
It loads two instances of the game. You’ll need to copy the game over into C:\Windows\System32 first, however. u/Rammadeus forgot that part. It’s kind of important.
---
I reckon you should change you pantys and stop complaining because they are two different game ok captain crunch?
---
They're not going to add that feature in.
---
The presidential election content sounded really interesting, shame it never saw release
---
Ooooooh computer shit I don’t know
---
Should be black.
---
Just saying.
---
It's the communists, under ground.
---
Ah shame
---
This is the way right here.
---
Another option is to farm leader of the pack right now before one wastelanders comes out. you can get lvl 5 piece one stars.
---
Pipe is Life friend. This also made me chuckle
---
Its jankies and his crew
---
Good luck getting someone banned for that.
---
If you have a private server (fallout 1st) you can travel to vault 76, look for a WORLD container, meaning a suitcase, a desk, anything you can transfer stuff to. Preferably something that has a limitless capacity. DON’T drop it on the floor. That being said, when you’re done transferring all those items to the container, quit to the main menu,  Choose your other character and join your private world again. (Private worlds usually have a 10-15 minute cool down, so if you lose connection, quit the game, etc. You can easily log back in to the same server. 
---
So now with your second character simply go to vault 76 and go to the container and pick up the items. It doesn’t have to be vault 76 , but I figured sometimes people like transferring stuff to new characters and since vault 76 is a free fast travel point, people use it often. 
---
If you don’t have fallout 1st, you CAN do the same thing by joining a friend’s server. Doing the exact same thing, quit to the main menu, chose the other character and then join the same world that your friend was it. But be careful, sometimes you’ll try to join his/her world but it might be full. So you’ll have to wait a certain amount of time. Also, your friend could leave and join a different world at any moment. So this method could work, but it could also screw you and then you’ll lose all your stuff. 
---
OR the third option. Assuming you’ve been playing the game since the BETA like I have, you’ve probably managed to make some good friends along the way. Friend you played with almost every day, friends you probably added on social media, etc. Ask them to hold some stuff for you. Swap characters and ask them to give you your stuff back. 
---
Honestly as long as you’ve played with them long enough they will most likely be kind enough to do that. If you wanna guarantee it goes well, offer to pay them 500 caps or so for their troubles. I made 4 friends that I trust dearly and we talk on fb and Instagram almost every other day, just like we play together usually 4-5 days a week. And we constantly help each other transfer stuff between characters. Including legendary weapons and armor. Sometimes even caps. Plans. You name it.
---
Yeah, I figgred that out too lol
---
This has been a bug since beta.
---
You could always just delete that folder. It’s the other way to get this to work, but I highly suggest you google ‘How to delete System32’ first.
---
Fog Crawler horde event in Kerwood mine is downright surreal. Creepy AF.
---
What I've learned is that you need at least 2-3 people grabbing ore to get a tier 4. Reason being is that the veins don't respawn fast enough for just 1 person. Running Excavator PA does **NOT** give you double ore in this event. Also, if you want to play it safe, don't deposit any ore until the very last moments of the event. As you reach higher tiers, floaters and deathclaws will begin to spawn.
---
Yes and no, he can’t be tamed but you can get a mounted one ;;)
---
I just server hop when it pops up, that place is a PITA
---
Congratz lol i never got one in fo4 farharbor nukaworld nada fo76 gotten two still have them both
---
general stimpak and diluted stimpak prices?
---
Is they’re a video that shows me how to do the two character glitch?
---
This is how it should be.
---
Just dont die.
---
I know it sounds weird to say, but I find it funny that I, who looks like a raider and at least until recently operated what looked like a former diner turned raider club house, am more trustworthy than a guy walking around as an anthropomorphic cat. Kinda one of those "shirt off my back" types when it comes to seeing new players. Even today I met a new player outside 76. She had just started and I tried dropping her stimpacks, which due to a glitch she couldn't pick up. I invited her to my party, had her leave and rejoin, then provided her with some supplies, a decent breakdown of game mechanics, and helped her to the Wayward while informing her of where she'd need to go. Even tossed her a Blue Ridge Caravan outfit and Mask to give her some unique flair out in the wasteland. I added her and hopefully we'll cross paths again, she's nice to chat with.
---
perhaps.jpeg
---
thank you
---
not too easy though. THAT'S NOT FAIR ON ME!!!1!!!!1111!!!
---
You're welcome...glad to have helped.
---
Please don't do anything suggested here btw. We're just yanking your chain.
---
To be honest I'm not sure how often either are updated so I wouldn't be able to accurately judge.
---
Unyielding ultralight scout l...
---
L what ???
---
Yeah the system 32 thing really exposed you so I just went along but my chain was well yanked
---
Recently*. That is one nice run on sentence... usually not the grammar police but that’s a doozie.
---
Agreed.
---
One shot doesn't exist because of the damage cap.
---
5-10 respectively
---
SPECIAL training. All the legendary perks are weaker than the standard ones. Bummer
---
Did you have the perk 'Power User' equipped previously? It increases the number of shots you get from fusion cores.
---
Don't you think there would be a bunch posts or trade posts getting rid of them if so?
---
But I really need to learn the glitch
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those. 
---
If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.

---
Dump your outfit collection onto a mule and be done with it
---
The game prioritizes cores wrong, it probably loaded a less charged core.
---
Repair bobbleheads and Power User also affect how many shots you get from Gatling Lasers, and losing their effects updates your curent ammo accordingly.
---
Gatling Plasmas suffer from the same glitch of using the wrong core,  but are not affected by Repair bobbleheads or Power User.
---
No.  Read the forum rules and you’ll figure out why none of us are going to help you do this.
---
Chameleon would be great if you could see your bloody crosshairs
---
It asks you to earlier in the event. The kindling appears around the base of trees around the camp.
---
Do you not have any pals you can use to transfer stuff?
---
I’m using a wireless head set that I have plugged into a regular charging hub
---
nope, still work
---
Of course it’s from the atom shop. Thanks!
---
Nope
---
I have things that would give a mod a seizure
---
U cant/couldnt dupe plans....soooooooo
---
Did you read my post? 
---
My lack of action was due to ignorance that the kindling kept respawning later in the event. Not due to effort.
---
Don’t be lazy. Read the entire post.
---
Nope. And don't look forward to changes to this in One Wasteland. Devs completely forgot to add legendary spawns and 2/3 stars to the Forest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap.
---
Yeah...lol...um no...I do it the xp...and xp only
---
I only have the one account and don't really know anyone I trust enough to hold my stuff. But what's the point of a stash if I shouldn't actually use it?
---
You have to find a spot with those decals, and then you can place decor on the decal to make it pop
---
The mods are honestly the cheapest option, with hard bargain 3. Unless you ask a friend (or somebody here on reddit) to modify the power armor for you. 
---
Obviously be kind enough to offer them some caps or flux in return. Unless the person really wants to do it out of the kindness of this heart. 
---
I personally just bought the mods when I was a low level because I knew I wasn’t going to have multiple x-01 power armors. I’m level 333 and the only plans I know so far are the military paint job, the quantum paint job, and the red tactical eyes.
---
By my calculations, based on output at the official ammo factory and encounters with players, there could easily be a few hundred million extra rounds of ammo in the game world due to this glitch.  If there is one thing the Fallout 76 community is good at, it's industrialising exploits.
---
Workshops are on your HUD, mate. Steer clear if you don't want a fight.
---
So...u guys downvote me cause I dont sux up to the OP and I play the game the way I want to play it...wow....snowflakes
---
He never told you to do that.
---
The answer is simple, the tiny satellite array that is in your teeth are picking up CIA radio transmissions and causing you to hear the Morse code messages.
---
Fuck
---
i love you
---
Chill out man, it could've been the dudes first Nuke and if he was in there a while he may not have known the event was going on, you can't really tell when you're on the map to launch the Nuke. Queens are super easy to fight and Nuke, no need at all to get that angry.
---
Stash your junk.
---
This comment made my day.
---
I saw the guy take down my teammates and then immediately turned and ran. I was CLEARLY not looking for a fight. There was absolutely no need for him to come at me. If I had been shooting back, that would have been one thing.
---
Also, this was a previously undiscovered location for me. I had no idea there was even a workshop nearby, much less that they were attempting to claim it.
---
but you could dupe the presents that the plans were in. like. there were people with thousands and thousands of these gifts
---
There's a PC mod to skip remove all the slower animations
---
Ive had sludge lung a thousand times, and it still has never finished.
---
I hate it when some random dude cops a feel on my junk.
---
Well I can give you an idea;
---
Maybe while this genius was running through the silo, somebody else at another silo launched a nuke, starting SBQ. This genius was too busy shooting at robots to pull up their map, and therefore was unaware that an instance of SBQ had already started. 
---
Calm your ass down, people make mistakes.
---
Do you have any scarecrows are paper cutouts? Those do wonders against those mole rates, particularly if you put a punji board down infront. Also spot lights are super important because sunlight doesn’t exist as far as AI detection goes, only artificial light counts. But if a super mutant is shooting your house from afar the only way to stop them is hope they approach or go take care of them yourself.
---
Yeah, but the guy sounded like he *was* looking for a fight and you showed up just in time. Sounds like you won't be making this mistake again!
---
There's a Responder eyebot random encounter that I'm pretty sure uses morse code. I don't know if that's what you're hearing though.
---
Throw all your non quest misc and notes away
---
Carry as few weapons and armour as possible
---
Carry as few spoilable aid items as you can without risking running out
---
Scrapped junk does not affect your inventory speed so you can keep as much as you want on you
---
Just things I've found that help
---
The HUD shows you the workshop icon. Just like it shows you any nearby locations.
---
They should disable the magic effect and explosive damage on energy weapons. They're duped so much that they're no longer legacy, just annoying.
---
I had just stashed it before making the flux. Like I said, I was just heading for a train station.
---
You were a target in a pvp zone. He did nothing wrong. He may still be an asshole but the game rewards his behavior. 
---
Stay away from pvp zones for good if you never want to get shot mate. Good luck.
---
I’ve been thinking about starting a berserkers guerrilla build once One Wasteland comes out. What’s the best way to break armor pieces outside of just letting enemies shoot and hit you?
---
Was that just on XBox?
---
Where did you make the flux?
---
Watching my HUD wasn't exactly my focus as, like I said, I was *running away*.
---
Won't be an issue much longer, my dude.
---
It's fun, but the game isn't designed to load areas like that.  It kinda hates it when I run through multiple loading areas and I'll eventually hit weird loading issues.  
---
I'm all for some kind of buff for using roads, just maybe not letting you sprint indefinitely.  Should have a higher frequency of random encounters, too.
---
Bug. These get reported. The CMs love passing these on, but the development team doesn't give a rats
---
A friendly shooting at you with a weak weapon or a drill/ripper is my guess. Legs are easy to break, torso is the hardest.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Is it *literally* a trap? as in a trap camp?
---
Watching your HUD **before** you got there would be the time to do so.
---
If they were in the silo, they probably weren't checking the map, my dude.
---
Definite learning experience for them I'd say. I mean I learned early that trying to take a workshop away from someone was going to start PVP, and just avoided doing that from there on. 
---
Stuff like the Ammo Factory, the Power Plants, and the Food Packing place I stopped ever going for because they are too popular/valuable.
---
I feel like the suggestion in the main post just opens up way too many griefing opportunities. Better to just not drop loot anymore I figure.
---
Naw like the Mystery Shack kind of tourist trap
---
Even giving us the option to equip our companions with higher power weapons would be nice.  Having me all geared up, carrying 3 heavy guns and rocking power armor and my companion plinking away with a .38 pipe gun seems...silly.  I can give them outfits to wear but not a better weapon?
---
My Camps in the same spot. Great view and I love getting Nuke pics.
---
I feel kinda bad that I've gotten so many that I've eaten few.  Never in any previous game,  but like 5 in 76.
---
Yes. It's not reliable.
---
There wasn’t anything nearby when it happened, I’ll share a clip I recorded soon
---
The guy was at the fight, he was well above level 300 ,he went to another silo and launched the nuke right where we were.😡
---
I was at my camp. Stashed my shit, made the flux, headed for train station. I'm kinda short on caps right now, so when I saw my teammates seemingly in the middle of nowhere halfway between me and the station I was headed to, I fast traveled. The plan was to run the rest of the way, and then I saw them both get taken out just as I landed. Ran off, dude shoots me as I'm running away.
---
I killed so many in the nuke silos I started keeping count and got to like 11 with my buddy and everytime I heard one I would go make it (+1 to number) amd proceed to absolutely annihilate it.
---
You can't see what you're buying - there's no image, and if the name is too long it cuts short so you can't see what limb it attaches to
---
Reward definitely doesnt not equal the effort and supplies.  People will say “ i can solo him git gud” but thats just gloating. I have duoed him several times but im lucky to have a solid rolled bloodied gauss minigun and a bloodied 50 cal.  These are exceptions and it shouldn’t be balanced around that.
---
He was at the already going fight,left to another silo and launched the nuke on top of where we all were. He did it on purpose. (Level 300+)
---
you cant view items in player vendors at least on PC you cant. Its been like that for a while now you can see the perks but not the items image itself
---
Yes
---
Ugh that disease bug...
---
I was there. What an idiot.
---
It happened literally after I landed. Loaded in, saw them go down, ran off. Died.
---
Usually players exploiting one thing usually exploit multiple things; not expecting it to ban anyone but it adds up with other strikes that the offender might already have. Getting a bunch of people reporting them for the same issue will absolutely end up with three strikes in a month easy; that will end with a ban or character wipe. Either way it is technically a exploit and therefore technically is something that should be reported for breaking TOS.
---
You really want to get stomped by a JE lasergun  while in buildmode, huh?
---
**JUST. PLAY. FALLOUT 4.**
---
I do agree that defend events needs more spice and randomness. Plan rewards are lackluster and extractor efficiency is dogshit.
---
The more co-op and less competitive the game, the better the community you see, IMO.
---
There's exceptions, but generally true in my experience.
---
I wouldn’t say that. Survival shortcut, for instance, is:
---
Full hunger and thirst refill
---
Full heal (without removing rads, which doesn’t make sense, but it works for bloodied)
---
Disease cure
---
And that’s at level one. At level 40, you generate 10 every twenty minutes.
---
Follow through is 10% extra damage just for sneaking, taking one for the team is 10% for being hit, and so on.
---
He was already at the current SBQ fight, he left to another silo and launched the nuke on top of the current event. He knew what he was doing.
---
Shooting people in the back isn't wrong? Wow. Okay.
---
You don't deserve the downvotes, and I get your frustration, but you were given everything you needed to know you were putting yourself at risk. You were unlucky.
---
Agreed. I’d love a gauss rifle with something to buff it up, like the fixer. Perhaps no scope sway by default?
---
I think luck helps. I am 15 luck and get one every few days
---
Ooooo ooooo OK that's messed up then. Didn't realize that. Sry to hear that then
---
Cool shot
---
And also means you've gone too far
---
You can go to the market subreddit and call a courier and they can help you transfer things or somebody with high trade karma
---
Man. You forget we in a game about the post apocalypse? Shooting people in the back is a feature! 
---
Wait til you learn camps can be *nuked*
---
honestly i like her having her own unique look and all but yeah it could have had a better reward.
---
I don’t trust them
---
&gt;I was at my camp. Stashed my shit, made the flux, **headed for train station.**
---
If you were at your camp when you made the flux, then why didn’t you stash your flux?
---
We need a lot more random encounter markers
---
Understandable
---
Your sarcasm is not helpful, or appreciated.
---
See my other response. You should have stashed your flux when you made it ***at your camp.***
---
Laser beam duh
---
I would uninstall the game
---
Its all good man. I was just worked up about it tbh.
---
you ever hear about that bank job in Tennessee? it was me, limpy pete and phil the crab.
---
😅of course howd i miss that
---
I dumped all mine in a train station suitcase a while back. Cleared up my vendors a treat. Hope somebody got some use out of them.
---
I know what you mean, this is my first multiplayer game and I was super nervous about playing it. But Fo76 has such an amazing community I love it
---
*Have? * No. It is very doubtful anyone would give those away to a stranger. 
---
The outfit itself?  Possibly. 
---
But this isn’t a bartering sub, friend.
---
The game literally can't handle you having so many outfits. They should have never assigned 0.1 CW.
---
1) find a server a friend is on
---
2) dump all the outfits you never wear in a container with 0 max capacity (actually infinite)
---
3) change characters, rejoin server
---
4) Loot all on the container
---
5) log off
---
I'm trying to educate you how silly your comment sounds. Shooting in the back is ok. It's not wrong. Part of the game. No sarcasm intended.
---
Ummm why really not alot to get and are you in a rush to get bored
---
My teammates were, according to my map *in the middle of absolutely nowhere*.  According to my *map* there was no danger. *The workshop was not on my map at all.*  I had no reason to believe that someone was going to take me out as soon as I landed.
---
How did they "wrong" you? If they weren't the ones that killed you, they're just being opportunistic (if intentional ie they waiting for you to bleed out) or just come across it by chance and are none the wiser as to whether it's definitely death loot or dropped loot. How could the game tell the difference between the two?
---
All that being said, so long as PvE only players can't be forced into this, sure, why not. Not against PvP in principle but it should never ever be forced onto someone who never wants to participate.
---
It’s a PvP zone.
---
No kidding. I've been playing gta online lately and the differences in the community are astonishing.
---
Yeah the game won't be a cakewalk anymore, but the game has needed an increase in difficulty for a while. Combat is boring when you're above level 100. You just decimate everything and nothing is a challenge. After playing ACP in the PTS and it being genuinely difficult I came to the regular game expecting a fun challenge... but it's so easy it's usually finished in a few minutes. It's such a let down compared to the PTS version.
---
Damage perks are still worth it, but different ones than before. You just need to swap some cards around and test more.
---
Bloodied is still more than worth it, same with junkies. AA and TS are good now but still weaker than both. I'm sticking with bloodied.
---
It’s called exp farming bro
---
My run in the event is if we have enough people defending at the start, I go into all 4 tunnels right away and hold onto the Ore for the last 20 seconds. Fighting off the Ghouls while I wait.
---
If we don't have enough people, I use my shishkebab to heal the Npc workers until we get enough defenders to do the above.
---
Hit the seek revenge button.
---
Gotcha!
---
The amount of time I spend visiting vendors just to buy arrows at 1 cap a piece.  I love my Bloodied*** Bow, with the explosive mod.
---
If it burns into your mind the harsh realities of not standing your flux after you make it in your own camp, then it actually *is* useful.
---
Most excited for the perk card packs for legendary perks, tbh.
---
A single iota of common sense would have indicated by someone running *away* from conflict, that they weren't interested.
---
Shooting them anyway to try and piss them off is absurd.
---
building them is much easier. build level 15 ones because it uses less materials
---
Get the bandolier perk card!
---
I only ever met 1 greifer that totally demolished my CAMP. Then they appeared at my camp a day later and I panicked but they gave me hundreds of presents as an apology. I was so conflicted 😂
---
Hell yeah
---
This wasn't some honorable duel. It was a fight for survival in a post apocalypse. Just be glad he wasn't also a cannibal and you get to respawn.
---
Irrelevant. If you’re at your camp, stash your junk before you leave. 
---
**Especially the valuable junk.**
---
what do I do after building them? Just scrap them?
---
😭
---
Bloodied builds can collect Ore just fine with the Chinese stealth suit or hazmat, it's all just lazy players who just rarther kill and ignore the goals. Still it's helpful to have some players act like that, just not all of them.
---
You said enclave wrong
---
Buy the plans. Craft while using Super-duper. Scrap them with the scrapper perk [extra steel].
---
yup. i think there's also a perk to get more materials from scrapping them. I might be wrong though
---
I thought I didn't have it either til I read this post, you saved me a lot of time lol trying to figure out where to get it from 😂
---
At your weapons work bench. craft and scrap. Use super duper too.
---
They won't ban anyone for this. They only ban for duplication exploits, 3rd party software and .esm manipulation.
---
You seriously overestimate how invasive punji boards are. They didn't nerf them because players stacked them. They did it because you were able to blueprint a literal iron Maiden to drop on shoppers.
---
I didn’t know you could get mods from weapons you crafted. Thank you, will give this a try!
---
You had things he wanted. You were in an area where he can take those things. No one cares you were scared and running.
---
I don’t think you’ll be able to get that plan for free it’s it a bit pricey but don’t worry the event should be coming back soon
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!!!!!!!
---
lol
---
Equip super duper and scrapper then make as many as you need to get the plans
---
And they did that limit in another way - the rep system.  Perhaps the only mistake they made was not having an equivalent rep system to unlock the secret service rewards.
---
Have that - you still spread out the progression.  But now you can easily increase (or remove) the cap on gold.
---
Radiation suit or Chinese Stealth Suit, all my characters are bloodied and can do it just fine!
---
There is it’s called scrapper it’s in intelligence. I’ve played since beta and just now started using that perk card. You can run through west tek and get almost 2k steel. And when they craft the hand mades use super duper you will get sometimes double guns so more to scrap for less material
---
Wait, you used to be able to see what you were buying?!?!  Been broken at least since player vending was enabled in June.  I've never been able to see what I was buying.
---
Good looking, rare or funny outfits / headwear
---
Ya I feel you, that's some petty shit he did
---
Darn. Maybe just stand in front of an enemy turret lol.
---
Did you not already know that?
---
Top of the world around the former raider base i go in an find many plans robot is regular
---
While Deathclaws arn't a problem, floaters and snallygasters are and can take out the npcs at great range!
---
A single iota of common sense would have indicated that someone running *away from combat* is not ready for combat and is therefore a prime and easy target.
---
He was probably ecstatic that you had stable flux on you and couldn’t believe his luck. And then you trying to beg for it back just fueled the fire. 
---
You need to accept your personal responsibility and learn from your mistake. 
---
Stash. Your. Junk.
---
He had no clue what I even had on me as, like I have stated before, I had just loaded in. He was being a prick and this entire comment thread (with the exception of like *one* person) is defending him.
---
Seriously, how hard is it to only PVP people that are *interested*, rather than attacking people who *clearly* aren't?
---
There's a mire lurk nest with eggs not far from the road outside foundation.  Spawn in and turn around.  Walk away from foundation down the road and turn right at that first bend (just a few paces from spawn).  Walk a ways with Foundation at your back and you'll fund it.
---
Damage via nuke mines in pacifist mode got patched.
---
Cool, thanks. I will make this my next stop
---
Somebody correct me if I am wrong but I believe all companions are level 39?
---
Turrets definately have multiple tiers that you can find plans for and build. I expect those tiers correlate with levels.
---
&gt;And that’s at level one. At level 40, you generate 10 every twenty minutes.
---
Not quite. "Generate 2 survival aiding chem every 20 minutes. Up to a maximum of 10."
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Survival_Shortcut
---
I already get that from food buffs, that's a perk for people who are too lazy to play the game
---
The more PvP, the better.
---
Same here. New server, F that noise.
---
Ok, my bad. Guess I misread that one.
---
Still, the benefits from that consumable are rather powerful.
---
You were in a pvp zone. He pvpd you. He wanted that 3 steel scrap and that desk fan you had on you. The flux was just a bonus im sure. 
---
Don't go in pvp zones, don't get pvpd.
---
I pull out legacies for uranium fever.
---
So give us the pants, she can keep the jacket.

I keep getting plans for robot chest mods from events and daily’s, but can’t get the damned chest itself lol

If youre worrying bout ammo, youre playing the game wrong, heavy build myself sitting on 300 ultracite fusion cores.
---
Man that bloodied bow of yours must do some devastation, saying that as a junkies build.
---
Stashing my junk doesn't negate the fact that **workshops need better indicators**. Stashing my junk doesn't matter when **the point of this post is that unwanted PVP still happens**.
---
If you’re on PS4 I can mod your handmade for you. You’ll need a bunch of screws to craft all those rifles.
---
How hard is it to stash the flux you crafted in your own camp?
---
Whether or not any of us think the guy in question was good/evil isn’t the point. You’re refusing to accept that you made a mistake. And that’s why so many of us are telling you that you’re wrong.
---
I won’t disagree that it current is just a way to skip that, but remember that in a patch after 22, there will be no reason to carry food except for buffs. If you don’t feel you need or want the buffs, then it’s a valid option. Infinite disease cures are also nice.
---
Already skinned his ass and made a rug, so might as well, his poor poor daughter 😂😂😂.
---
Totally agree - there are not really any consequences for dying - u don’t want to lose it then store it or don’t die ...
---
I'm like, 95% certain. Always leave that last 5% keeps ya humble. :D
---
How hard is it to **give better indicators of workships**?
---
The stacked ones amplify damage done so they prevented it all together; they did it to prevent both situations entirely. That still won't stop them from using old blueprints that still function or new complex methods of making iron maidens at doorways and hallways so players melt as soon as they walk in. There is a good reason why you don't see many players doing it nowdays; used to be all over the place a year ago. I already explained they won't ban players over doing only this but it is still a exploit and against the rules so it should be reported.
---
It was fixed and working for a little while, then some other patch broke it and here we are again.
---
That they don't seem "so" similar?   
---
They have just as much in common with each other as any other group in fallout that use high tech guns, power armor, and science. That is where all similarities end.
---
Thank you
---
The little power substation north of watoga, spawns a deathclaw and a handful of ants. I've camped there and so everytime someone comes shopping the DC spawns, and quite often she can be a chameleon. Such amazing creatures.
---
You fast travelled in. ‘Better indicators’ that you’re about to enter into a workshop wouldn’t have mattered. 
---
If you had been running along, like we originally thought, maybe that would be a factor. But you weren’t. You said you saw your teammates go down, and then fast traveled in. 
---
Your teammmates getting downed should have been a clear and obvious indicator that you were heading into a hot zone. You seem to be ignoring that part as well. 
---
You made a bad tactical decision. Now learn from it and move on.
---
"Being forced into over-encumberance from loot being rewarded to you directly."
---
You know, it would be pretty awesome if there were something similar to a 'stash box' that occupied a small corner of the train stations where all of those rewards or missed legendaries, or whatever was just deposited instead of it being dropped directly onto your character. Like for instance, while you're in the middle of a silo and someone who isn't you goes off and completes the 'Cop A Squatter' quest and you've suddenly got to deal with being encumbered with more heavy armor pieces, missles, and mini nukes that you don't want. Then, that little box after you get what you want out of it, you could say - scrap/convert all, and it would scrap all of the armor/weapons/ammo into scrap or ammo points. My experience with the game would drastically improve if such a thing existed.
---
How would that have helped when you were fast traveling in blindly?
---
The final reward skin, and the jetpack skin to go with it, look pretty great imo. A few other things. 
---
Mostly waiting for the vertibird PA skin and other BoS stuff to hit the atom shop.
---
I've been told that you can stock up on healing salves instead.  Since it doesn't have an animation, you can spam them.
---
Yesss hope he did this on purpose I love watching a queen fight and dropping that greif nuke glad to see people still get this angry. I've done this myself and think I'll try it with collosus soon get ready for it
---
You have to know where to play.  If you're spending time on areas like the the Forest and Ash Heap you're wasting time on level 30 and lower mobs with a payout of like 30 xp per kill.  Do your questing and killing in high level areas like The Divide and the marshes where payout is higher and use boosts when the events spawn like The lighthouse or the meat stew event south of Vault Tech.  
---
Also, the level up daily is incredibly easy if you just keep an open character slot.  You can easily level up with a low level.  Most times I did my dailies on a low character just from running around for an hour and joining public events.  Once the toon hit like 15 I deleted it and started a new one because leveling a low toon goes faster than a high toon.
---
Hopefully with one Wasteland it will even out though as XP will be more rewarding in what we consider low level areas now.  This will definitely make things easier for those who play casually to get more exp.
---
If you head in the area of fort defiance, I think there's a watch tower nearby but perhaps south east of it..... I'm a bit eastward of that tower.... Or I was. I relocated a while back, but anywhere along that mountain range has a good view of the SBQ getting Nuked on a regular basis.
---
You can’t bond with yourself ;)
---
Must have missed that on patch notes, haven't had to do it in a while so I didn't notice. Cheers
---
The best reward is getting rid of all that trash in the holo tab!
---
If you press buy it shows the full name.
---
Ah so it means when they progress i also get more exp from quests ?
---
The pants are just part of the Vault 76 Underarmor.
---
Well when you get hit by something like an explosive gatling plasma with a beam splitter on you dont really notice the difference
---
Unwanted pvp could happen similarly if you clicked on Nuclear Winter and began a match without knowing what to expect.
---
What would be the complaint then? That NW should be removed entirely or be locked behind a password? 
---
This thread is trying to tell you unwanted pvp is part of Fallout 76, a game a lot of us like and care about. Yes, some of us like to defend our game from changes suggested by people that we don't agree with.
---
My last comment for you is only this: learn to play this game the way it was designed, or don't. There is little sympathy here.
---
Is it the ounce of prevention quest? If so there is currently a bug that makes it impossible to complete because you can't enter the building.
---
also try and use a backwoodsman #3 as that cuts down the resources needed
---
I joined a legendary mob event by whitesprings, and ended up in a completely black cave area at kenwood mine with a bunch of yao gaui.  I almost shot my gun, but warped out instead.
---
Spent 20 minutes trying to find it coming in from the outside, and guess maybe it was behind a wall? My toon was poopy after all the swimming.
---
It's about time to eat.
---
*Eats lead.
---
We're not sure if they're following through with that. Honestly, it would be a step backwards. All they need to do is remove the HP drain so we can fast travel.
---
Every full bar adds 1 point to Intelligence and every point earns +2% XP. 
---
Somebody correct me if I’m wrong.
---
It's just a game, relax. Shit happens. 😂
---
Quickest way I found was to go to Helvetia(spelling?) and aggro the low level scorched. Use survivability perks like dodgy, born survivor and bizarrely an armoured back pack seems to push the damage to your armour. Managed to break all armour but a Secret Service chest in about 10 mins. Secret service pieces take a lot longer.  Hope this helps.
---
I didn't even know that this was a disease in the game.
---
So whats the point to boost intel? I know im doing exp rn cause i want to respect alot of things
---
Yup he realized what clowns were doing the event so he did what was right and nuked them I mean you,lol. Love this wasteland and thanks for the reassurance that greifing works all to well
---
Ok, how the fuck does PvP works here, PvP activates when you return fire, right? Im concerned because i dont like PvP, i just want to do quests and kill NPCs, i dont bother with other people(i join a public team to get more xp and speed) but aside from that i dont relate to other people.
---
I make them (the outfits) for people who ask nicely.
---
I used to be an adventurer like you... oh, never mind. just spotted them.
---
Blueprints don't work mate.
---
It's a waste of time. They've addressed it. There's nothing they can do about legacy camps
---
There's literally a train station right out the door...
---
i can see it now ...
---
Except Chameleon. No downside. Also unlikely usable upside.
---
A bit late the the party, but here goes.  
---
If you find Olivia's terminal and read through the entries, she resented her mother long before this.  She was unhappy with things even before the war, which Shannon alludes to, but Olivia grew to hate her mother and her "sisters", thinking it was a mistake to take them all in.  Her personality fit the raiders long before her mom moved another girl into the spot she felt she should have been in, even if she thought the whole order was a joke.
---
But I'd like to think that in the end, all was forgiven after Brody betrayed her and she held her mom for the last time.
---
Sweet. Thanks for the pro tip!
---
Excited for the all the CAMP stuff the most!
---
If you have fallout 1st, you can just drop the items on a private server, swap toons, and pick them up.  Some people say to use suitcases at a rail station, but I just drop my things on the ground outside vault 76 and have yet to have an issue with them.  
---
If you don't have fallout 1st, make a friend that does and you can do it on their server.  Hit me up if you're on PS4 and you need assistance with this.
---
Could go sideways.
---
Me: oooh a loot bag in the middle of nowhere. *loots*
---
Random raider with full PA explosive Gatling plasma jumping out of nowhere: it’s treason then.
---
The higher your intelligence, the more XP you earn
---
sounds like you've already got the insufferable outfit plans
---
INT perk "power user"

Also

I'm up the hill across from the Wayward. I constantly have level 5 Supermutants pot shot the roof off of my CAMP from the mountain. It's really annoying.
---
No. PVP can still happen if you accidentally walk into a workshop. I've had people kill me before I could fast travel away when utilizing a TSE Bloodied build, but I've heard that got nerfed. (I have my doubts as to it actually being nerfed.)
---
&gt; Such amazing creatures.
---
So true. I still cling to the hope of seeing more intelligent Deathclaws like Gorris at some point.
---
Treasury notes and steel, they're the only objective that's really worth anything if you're not a LVL 40 or below player.
---
Life is much easier in fallout
---
But why not do the quest event? Doesnt doing a bunch of quests and public event with 4 people give more exp ?
---
There's pencils and pens in Watoga High. Check the tables by the robot in the "test taking" area right under where the paintings are. Just FYI.
---
I keep seeing the same npc that gives out food plans which is a waste.
---
haha i played dayz to and it definetly is
---
And if you have pacifist enabled, all that means is you can't shoot *them*. It affords you *no* protection against other players.
---
Haha
---
naw i can make whatever i need.  Right now I nuked whitesprings on my private and am farming. My point is the 5 or 6 ultracite cores you will burn is not worth a cursed shovel and some screws you probably dont need anymore with 50 plus advanced repair kits.
---
respect. the rust life is probably the toughest out there.
---
Its user flair, on the website version you can select it under community options over the right side of the screen, no idea how to do it on mobile though sorry!
---
Maybe not more drain - if your going to loose bonus from building group or event group the bonus you are getting should be incentive enough without the negative
---
As KL-E-0  once said. 
---
 I am a woman baby, can't ya tell.
---
Had the exact same thing happen to me today. Haven't seen any other posts about NW specifically, and this glitch makes it unplayable after a point. Wonder how long it will take for some of the community to get upset that we keep asking questions and make gag posts.
---
Bad press?  I love this event - didn’t realize it was getting bad press ...
---
I have been playing since BETA and have had the exact same complaints this entire time. Each and every time this complaint is voiced (either by me or anyone else I see) PVP harpies come out of the woodwork to tell us to shut up.
---
NW was advertised as a battle royale. Try again.
---
You tha man, tyvm lol
---
Wow your blind if you cant see the red circle pay attention why this stupid post because you dont know how to store your junk or understand the rules
---
I'll have to try that, thanks.
---
If you’re purely doing events, yes, event team would earn you more XP. 
---
When not doing events, building teams would be your go to.
---
until they remove hacked guns and fix the damage stacking bug/ damage shotgun I think staying away from pvp content is the best course of action here.
---
That’s why I suggested exploration because I rarely see any of the public groups 
---
DONT TOUCH MY BUILDING TEAM I need my intelligence buff &lt;3
---
And then ‘splode that head.
---
You dont take damage from non-player enemies for 15 seconds- that'd be one of the only boosts they could add that I'd eat my 1 pie for. 
---
Until then it shall live on display.
---
Haven't tried that.. But I guess it was meant for pvp defence around your camp?
---
I cant I'm immediately over encumbered if I dont have the weapon weight perks on my armor for my arsenal of heavy guns unfortunately. I'll run down there and grab the stuff near the tunnel entrances when I can but its usually only about 20 or so before I have to run back out.
---
Ah okay, well im launching a nuke on a mine for a quest and i forgot to get a nuclear card and i did the whole process... I'm annoyed. I made a team and nobody has mics
---
It varies in my experience. Some show up shortly after I arrive to the area, others show up a good 15 minutes after and I usually give up on them by then lol
---
With next patch there will be a daily ops group that will gain a bit of traction but yeah, we need groups good enough that make people want to leave that Intelligence buff
---
Well yea if you say it like that, then yea you got a point, personally id rather see earl drop repair kits aswell
---
I'm just going to wait and see how it does after I sell a bunch of these fasnacht masks. If it's still lagging bad, I'll just grab a bunch of clothes and dump it in the overseers stash in Flatwoods. Because it's the adding or removing things from only the weapons or the armor section that lags it. So removing them all is going to take me hours because of the lag it creates.
---
Stimpaks, legendaries, plans, and ammo.
---
*Just please, no mounted head plans.*
---
Oh, I made countless characters for daily level ups
---
:-)
---
Also, I’m level 100+. Trust me, I know what you’re talking about. But even at my level, I hardly have time to get a few events and some other challenges done daily, you know?
---
Real life agro sucks!
---
Sorry to hear that. I’m on PS4, can’t help you that.
---
Is the frame rate drop just because of the ash piles left behind? It seems like frame-rate doesn’t drop to a screeching halt until the ashes pile up. 🤔
---
Ahhh this guy on my team actually replied and is looking for one ! So whats the best way to find those cargo bots and camp them so i can get multiple cards in the future ?
---
Lol yeah. I mean, I have time to do it, but the issue is I like to play a bunch of different games - not get tied to one.
---
I don’t engage in PvP except pre-arranged.  Try again. 
---
We are telling you how to avoid this in the future. And you have yet to say *‘Yes, it was a bad idea to not stash my valuable flux at my camp, where I made the flux, before fast traveling.’*
---
Lol...very true.  Looks are obviously deceiving sometimes.  That was really sweet of you.  I too try to help out whenever possible.  But it's harder for me since I don't use a mic to chat so I'm left with the more awkward emotes. 
---
 I realize that most people seem to play the games as the settlers dispite our outer wear...in the sense that we want the wasteland to thrive and try to help out...but kick butt when we need to of course.
---
I have a character with great Weightless armor but the Chameleon mutation is SO annoying. Much prefer to run around in Chinese Stealth and take my chances.
---
Maybe so, but it didn’t get to a point of betrayal and violence until Eve was promoted. That’s when she began working with the Raiders.
---
Actually, over time I HAVE gone back and reread entries from Olivia’s terminal and BOTH of Shannon’s terminals. A part of me felt I was a little too harsh on Olivia, as her mother probably DID neglect her more. But the world has changed. Society doesn’t exist anymore. The Order and her sisters were Olivia’s best bet. She needed to grow up and stand by her mother. She was a mere spoiled brat who knew how to kill.
---
Olivia was terribly power-hungry, and in the end, that AND her betrayal to the Order is what really got her and her own mother killed. She may have been one hell of a warrior but I will never respect a character who betrays their own.
---
Tenpenny Tower's residents wish they had a view that nice.
---
She’s now talking about her new collecteon that collects concrete!
---
The songs being added is due to copyright rules, but I hope more can be added that are from that era, even if they aren’t jazz/swing stuff (non FO).
---
I’d love to honestly explore listening to ALL the tunes of that era.
---
Recently in my camp. Enemies are appearing right where the module is, not coming from outside, and yeah my turrets and ally don't notice 😅thankfully I'm not getting *too* destroyed. But is a pita
---
Combo, I believe. But yeah, it was something awful.
---
Use both, they’re free.
---
**Don’t spend them.** It’s an accounting glitch. Take a screenshot and submit a ticket
---
Awesome, yea same here
---
FYI just because you sided with foundation doesnt mean you cant max your raider rep.  siding with one side actually doesnt hurt your rep of the other
---
What about my legit atoms?
---
Yes there’s one in the overseers house
---
Think there's one in Overseer's place. 🤔
---
Can you take it?
---
The white springs has one
---
Two off the top of my head. In the Whitesprings loop area where you get the Sword from the case, and at the top of the AMS building in Watoga, in the office that also has a bunch of robot models.
---
Nice shot, but if that's the area around the Monorail Elevator, then it's an amazing place for resources - *if you know where to look*.  Directly across from the Asylum, 3 aluminum veins, near the Elevator itself are 3 Lead veins and 3 Iron veins. More veins all along the foot of the cliff for iron and aluminum, some copper veins, and lots of silt bean, aster, and firecracker berries - plus, water. Not to mention, the random encounter spot inside that crater, you can find a host of creatures there and often there are legendaries. I've killed so many sheepsquatch there I couldn't begin to count them. 
---
Also, pumpkins, and I mean, PUMPKINS. Where else you going to find pumpkins on the border of the Cranberry Bog/Savage Divide?
---
Of course.
---
The legendary miners always seem to spawn at 25%, 50% and 75% of the uranium collection bar being filled. Or at least that is what I've observed.
---
Just asked my son he found one in whitespring's where you get the sword for mistress of mystery on top of the fireplace.
---
I really do like the overseer so a pat on the back from her is much more preferable than the 10mm ammo. :P
---
Also which support category do I go to. Can’t find it I’m partially blind.
---
Oh yeah I just said bloodied because it's the best and its still not that good lol. Ive got a pretty decent bloodied bow that I use when I'm doing the queen since even normal SB go down in 1-2 shots in sneak. The VATS are just horrible and reload speed is awful for taking out more than 1 enemy at a time. I'd love to get a bloodied 50crit 15 reload bow if those even exist lol. I know ffr doesn't work on bows but I believe reload speed does.
---
I'd like to see more mods like a tesla bow mod for chain damage, an explosive bow affix that isn't tied to the arrows so I can still use ultracite because of how cheap they are compared to normal arrows, and a multishot mod.
---
LOL yeah report it then get your 1st suspended and all of you atoms taken like that one poor guy.
---
that's a good idea too. but if you're using a common weapon like a combat rifle or assault rifle, there's no use in building them. you can just farm super mutants or mole miners
---
I'll try that and let you know how it went
---
Not all heroes wear capes. o7
---
You’re not helping
---
Best bet is to hop servers.
---
Reporting it doesn’t get your account suspended. Spending them does.
---
You go to Enclave bunker and start the quest to get the keycards, in the room nearest to the Armory on the terminal. You can do that as many times as you feel like jumping servers to start it over.
---
How do you do that?
---
TOO. MANY.
---
Just off the top of my head? Give contested workshops the same event icon that workshops under attack have, so that people who have not been to the workshop can see it on the map *before* they fast travel.
---
And how would that have helped when you didn’t stash your flux?
---
Or just have one piece of chameleon armor and not deal with the mutation.
---
My favorite part is OP thinking Bethesda would read this.
---
Some wear tadpole backpacks. o7
---
I knew that part, it was the workshop part i got confused, so by just entering a workshop, they can legally kill you? You dont need to "claim it" from another player to enable PvP
---
If your on PC I have a ton to sell.
---
... are you sure your just not appearing offline?
---
I am 😁
---
We basically had that with survival mode, but it was the whole map rather than a region.
---
If it’s being contested, yes. And that’s what the OP doesn’t seem to realize. 
---
The workshop was a PvP zone because his teammates were contesting it.
---
I know that Bethesda isn’t going to respond to this.
---
Iirc, the rad resistance for Lead Champagne stacks with chems.
---
Did I say account? No I said 1st.   
---
Holy shit literally all morning people were complaining they had their atoms wiped and their first locked out some even could access anything they had boughten previous.   
---
All those posts were by people who reported it to Bethesda. However other people that did not report are fine and just had their 10s of thousands reduce to 1000-2000 more than what started.   
---
So which sounds more like a hassle do nothing and maybe get bonus atoms or report and then get told your fucked and have a huge hassle on your hands?

"TSE Bloodied"?
---
Ctrl+Tab brings up the social menu. From there you can look at the right most tab of all the players in your current game. Click their name and report. It doesn't do anything based on the history of people reporting and nothing happening though.
---
Exactly.
---
I rolled a new one, no regrets. Made the game feel fresh again.
---
It's an across the board nerf, though.  You're going to be doing less damage then you are now, OP build or not.  The OP builds will still be king because everything else is going to be worse.  The thing that worries me is Bethesda said this was being done to better balance other things, and we haven't heard a peep about what these other things are.  Considering their track record, they'd probably just do the blanket nerf and not buff/fix anything for 4 months.
---
Do you have the ammo smith perk. With it fully leveled you'll make over 100 every time.
---
For the last fucking time: I landed. They went down. I ran. ***In that order.***
---
Curious, what is your KD ratio in other games?
---
Farm the lead, acid and cloth. Craft your own. Use Ammosmith 2 and Super Duper 3. 
---
And the Gatling Gun and Minigun both use 5mm ammo, so losing the Gatling Gun wouldn’t have mattered, really.
---
I feel like I acquire 5mm more than anything, if you were on Xbox I’d gift you the 8k sitting dead in my vendor
---
It isn't a mere accusation to call the enclave fascist, they are the embodiment of fascism. They (The Enclave) are the single most oppressive faction that the fallout franchise has seen and believe themselves the rightful government of the US, and most likely what is left of the rest of the world.   
---
The BoS makes no claims of governmental authority and they are not oppressing, or trying to oppress the people of the wasteland. Their entire motivation is the empowerment of a humanity responsible enough to handle building itself back up from the ashes, not their oppression. 
---
They have so much splintering of ideology and dispersal of power internally that calling them a dictatorship under one party rule is laughable.
---
Fascists want control, we have not seen any evidence of any BoS faction in canon wanting control, unless you're talking about technology, and even then their whole motivation is to lock it behind an iron wall to keep it out of the hands of people who would abuse it (Like the Enclave)
---
I'm always low on lead. Where do you stock up, so that acid is your limiting factor?
---
I do not, but I'm looking at it now!
---
Reporting it doesn’t get your FO1st suspended either.  
---
Spending the Atoms is what does. That’s what everyone I know that has experienced it has said, from what I’ve seen.
---
Only level 35, so Super Duper isn't an option.
---
Any recommendations for a lead farm?
---
Yeah, I don't know why you're yelling it to me. You were talking about making a mule. I responded. I'm literally not arguing that I have too many. 
---
I'm saying it's too much of a hassle to go make an entirely new character, go back to my old character and spend hours removing all of the clothes, then dump all of those clothes somewhere, switch characters, pick up all of those clothes, and then put them in a stash box that will start lagging the more clothes I put in making it also take hours. 
---
It's easier to just collect those clothes and dump them in Flatwoods for someone else.
---
There are literally reports from players of it happening. Quit being a lazy fuck and go look it up.
---
For the last ***fucking time***. Stash your damn junk when you’re at your camp, **especially the stable flux you just crafted.**
---
Using the Gatling on trash mobs is advisable because of the reduced ammo consumption.  Save the Minigun for the more intense encounters.
---
Log out, log back in.
---
Lucky Hole mine.
---
Quit being a jackass about it. I shared what I had seen from sources I trust. Not random BS.
---
Zergs of angry 12 year olds trying to kill people and take their stuff.. yeah Rust has a special place in video games
---
  
---
"Clan LFM people, no screechers" lol
---
U can take over the converted munitions factory
---
Here’s a solid lead farming route that doesn’t require using Lucky Hole Mine. That will let you save up your Acid to make Gunpowder as needed. If you need places to farm Steel, I recommend running Uranium Fever whenever it shows up. During my last run I ended up with over 1k Steel from scrapping all the gear they dropped. You can also reference this doc for Steel or other resources:  https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
**This is the route I use:** *(The #c at the end is how many caps it takes to Fast Travel from the previously listed spot. The entire route costs about 100 caps. If your C.A.M.P. is placed along the route somewhere (mine is near Silo Alpha, for example) you can reduce this as well as have a guaranteed spot to dump your loot easily. And having the Survival Tent will make this easier, especially after the silo runs.)*
---
+ Green Country Lodge (40 Lead Scrap) 9c from Vault 76
---
+ Eastern Regional Penitentiary (80 Lead Scrap) 18c  (or 12c from Vault 76)
---
+ Missile Silo Bravo (80 Lead Scrap) 10c
---
+ Pleasant Valley Cabins &amp; Ski Resort (90 Lead Scrap) 17c
---
+ Missile Silo Alpha (80 Lead Scrap) 4c
---
+ Monorail Elevator (80 Lead Scrap) 17c
---
+ Missile Silo Charlie (80 Lead Scrap) 13c
---
+ Charleston Fire Department (80 Lead Scrap) 18c
---
It’s usually about 600 Lead Scrap, give or take. For the silos, just run in to the gym on the first floor, grab the weights and run out. For the monorail elevator, wear your Power Armor (it’s a long drop if you misstep).
---
600 lead scrap should get you about 4200 rounds of 5.56 with Ammosmith 2 &amp; Super Duper 3. If you make sure that your damage perks are optimized, you can usually kill most enemies with just a few rounds. 
---
That run above doesn’t even factor in Luck Hole mine or the random lead you can pick up from other world items. Make sure Lead is one of your tagged junk items and just pick up items that show as tagged with the magnifying glass. 
---
With just a short time dedicated to an efficient run, you can have more than enough ammo. I run a .50 cal on my main, currently have 20K+ rounds for that and still craft and sell about 30-40k 5.56 rounds every week.
---
Tf are you talking about? You didn't mention that at all. You having memory trouble my dude? Maybe you should read your own post before you try starting shit.  
---
Outside of that, that's a pretty damn weak excuse. There are waves of bugs coming out of those piles from the start of the event to the end, you have to walk up to or near those trees every time the bugs respawned, and the kindling's pretty damn conspicuous. You must either be very new to the game (And if that's the case, where do you get off complaining like this) or straight up blind. (Or, more likely, you're lying to save face)
---
Groundbreaking.
---
Turn ATLAS into one
---
Other than that part, yeah. But being out of 5mm means neither is viable at the moment.
---
I have the same problem.
---
I will trust the pics and reports and proof of emails from the people that is happened to over some youtuber source.   
---
I mean why not just admit you got a hard on for Todd go rub it out and call it a day.
---
Find a friend that can mod the Mini for you and craft you a gatling to use for trash mobs (will save on ammo.
---
No wonder Sofia has a headache.
---
Someone snarffed my loot bag last night. They watched me die and snuffled it. It contained a grand total of two items. So glad they felt the need to snuffle two crappy items. I have stood over a loot bag to watch the deathee return and shine my pipboy on it. It isnt hard not to be a dick
---
I don't think it would disappear... I'd imagine it magically turns it into a combat rifle and it loses it's "the fixer" benefit.

Bummer I’m XB1 but thanks anyways!

Most folks put on their excavater PA and hit up luckyhole mine and farm all the lead nodes.
---
Rust can be tough as hell. No mercy out there
---
Where did I say my source was YouTube?
---
And how is warning someone to avoid getting their account suspended (which using Atoms they didn’t purchase would easily do) mean I have any pro-Bethesda bias?
---
Bethesda screwed this up. And the wise thing to do is to not spend any of the atoms and report the glitch. 
---
You made the claim that someone got their FO1st suspended for reporting the glitch but not spending Atoms. Cite the source. That’s the burden of the claimant.
---
You should try to get a gun plan with gold bullion that way at that point you’re just rerolling for legendary effects rather than entire weapons, methinks and medid. Gauss pistol, shotgun, minigun, plasma caster(?).
---
The benefit to the mutation is that you don’t have to sneak. But you also have to stand still... as I was saying, unlikely usable upside.

Yells 'IT'S BEHIND YOU!'

"Oh no... mobs attacking my camp" *kills mobs, repairs camp, moves rocket turrerts to side mobs attacked, moves on

Yea, everybody can do something to deal with the toxic chat. Unfortunately, I believe most general players won't turn on any specific chat filter. 
---
I've been playing ESO for a few years. The comunity in there is really good, back then there aren't many players in ESO, but still, I ocassionally get personal toxic messages in PVP, which is really annoying.
---
This is a SPECTACULAR list. Thank you so much!
---
I thought I was going to get killed a lot haven't had someone shoot at me yet and a nice person gave me a combat shotgun

Although it's hard for me to play because it lags terribly :(

&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Do you fast travel a lot?
---
You don’t HAVE to walk to any of the trees. Stand in the middle and shoot them as they come to you. Show me anything that says you must walk to the trees as the bugs come.
---
You’re right about one thing...one of the first comments pointed out they respawn and I admitted I didn’t know that. That’s where I was getting that from.
---
Talk about starting shit. You’re saying I’m lazy when you don’t know the whole story.
---
Bruh! Purveyor gives crap 98%of the time.my best finds have been in vendors. Save some caps and vendor hop.what is your build?pm me
---
If only the flicher farm holotape behaved the same way...
---
Get yourself the excavator pa, hit lucky hole mine with it, then hemlock holes for acid.
---
I fast traveled to a camp to try to get to where I was going faster and it got stuck in a rock
---
I am so angry... I dumped a bunch of plans today at the Overseers CAMP, and headed off. I got across the map and ended up in a battle right as a server shut down came across. 
---
I doubt anyone had time to pick up those plans before the server dropped, and I am pretty frustrated that Beth doesn't have a better way to handle this.
---
Most heavy weapons (cryloater, flamer, broadsided, missile launcher, auto grenade launcher, fatman) don’t feel viable as a class compared to explosive automatic weapons. Been this way since release and I doubt it will change.
---
Maybe he just wanted to see if it would kill the queen?

I want to nuke the imposter sheepsquatch and see what happens.
---
I can help you with some ammo and another modded gatling gun, even a lucky hole run. I don't want to tell you about modding your minigun bc I understand trust issues. But in general if you want help, shoot a message and I'll gladly lend a hand.
---
What really frustrates me is the fact that the laser and missile turrets take up more budget than the advanced machine gun turret.  
---
Why.
---
If they accidentally gave me a extra 1 to 10k atoms I would blow threw that like a fiend with hookers and blow.what would they do take the atom shop items away.i don't think they have a way of doing that.
---
I buy it in bulk whenever I see it. Usually from players, but the raider vendor in the pleasant valley ski resort has it too. I also pick up every can, rat poison, and battery I see.
---
*cue the jealous salty cry babies who still don’t have a legacy despite the huge amount of duping going “WAAA WAAAA NERF/REMOVE LEGACIES WAA WAAAAAAA”*
---
They show up in the military wing vendors at the enclave bunker.
---
Pick up cans, tin cans, and aluminum cans. Grab anything child related. Harvest paint cans and any colored paint.
---
They all contain lead.
---
Bought the plasma caster plans today actually! Waiting for the legendary exchange count to reset to grab the modules, was returning and re-buying from that thieving mole miner all day and now all I can do is wait it out lol. Fingers crossed!
---
They should be like pleasent valley claim tickets
---
Oh and breach and clear
---
Buffing the benefits and letting people plants the seeds for all the different plants would be huge!
---
How about adding refrigerated vending machines?? It would add a whole new gameplay loop for people that like crafting , cooking, and hunting.
---
Stop listening to what strangers tell you and experience the joy of this game in its totality.
---
You're correct about your theory on crafting. You scrap a type of gun, there's a chance to get a mod for that type of gun.
---
Game will scale with your level starting Sept 15 as there's an update coming. 
---
Right now, it's perfectly easy to find enemies way stronger and higher level than you. Stay in western half of map until lv 40+ if you can.
---
Again, things change after Sept 15.
---
It says the same thing in English so it's not a translation error it's a dumb writer error
---
OP (me) realized it was a contested workshop *after* I was killed. I was running *away* from PVP and *unknowingly* ran into a workshop because I turned tail and *ran*.
---
In the PTS it's free to travel to Crater and Foundation. On Septemer 15, the patch containing these two new fast travel points it will go live.
---
Sorry but how does it work now ? I interact with it and it just does an animation but no screen to donate the ammo. The terminal seems to only let me buy. I used it once when I first got it but forget how it went. Honestly just thought it was disabled til they update it.
---
When you're screwing over low levels, you aren't just *playing* the asshole.
---
Rust is unapologetically for griefers.
---
Do you know whats changing? Or have a link or some such.
---
It's random, you'll be fine.
---
I’ve gotten it twice but I have a friend who gets them all the time and I mean ALL THE TIME.  She got 3 in a day once, ridiculous.
---
The game might not be real, but the effect players have on each other is
---
Also, there are no longer challenges to do things in a Nuked zone.
---
Hey man, I feel ya, there’s a guaranteed one in the Big Bend tunnel, on the Lewisburg side. It spawns next to a mole rat in a flooded tunnel alcove, in one of the Blue Mountain Caravan crate spawn spots. I pick it up every time I pass through, so I guess it respawns for the event. I don’t have the plans, but I have nearly all the mods now. Happy Scavving!
---
The juice is worth the squeeze. Gauss shotgun and mini gun are both very useful with the right roll.
---
Can confirm. o7
---
I'll be looking for it!
---
For the ability to craft legendary weapons that are actually immensely powerful? A lot
---
I have had more pleasant online encounters playing this game then almost any other. The community is nothing short of fantastic, and it’s part of what overshadows a lot of the games shortcomings for me.
---
I’m all for this! As someone who travels roads and paths often, especially for random encounters, this would be great!
---
Oh right right right.. Anyway i did that to do the monogah or w/e mine and jesus i didnt know i was gonna fight that super wendigo. Good thing half the server was there lmao
---
And you didn’t stash your stable flux at your camp before fast traveling away.
---
Why?
---
The last level is all the previous combined in rep needed, good luck.
---
Do get i get a thumbs up
---
I've seen *some* post suggesting that they've been patched.
---
Arcade machines. They've already created them for Fallout 4 and boy do they love recycling old cosmetics for use i the Atomic Shop.
---
Here you go. Lots of updates coming, check around on other news articles on their site.

If you got the tenderizer plan from meat week legendary tenderizers will drop from the purveyor. You wind up with a bloodied swing speed +1 strength tenderizer and you can trade it for whatever you want. Literally.
---
Which ones better in your opinion?
---
They're still legacy....? Lol
---
The minigun sucked in fallout 4 why would you want it here?
---
Plague walker just straight up doesn't even work for me. No poison aura, and diseases still expire normally.
---
I use a bloodied plasma caster as a heavy gun vats build and it does pretty well!
---
Ive seen and lost the damned thing thought i was going crazy
---
You'll rarely find a plan listed in my workshop for over 50 caps. I'm mostly "giving away" plans for cosmetic things for about the price of a fast travel. It seems that at some point the Hard Bargain perk started working on CAMP vendors, and I'm a little offended when I see someone buy a cosmetic plan for 27 caps instead of the 30 caps I asked for them.
---
I list obvious garbage zero-weight notes for more, in case someone decides to tip me some caps for being nice.
---
Yeah,  they just tbag in PvP. And tbag in PvE if you die next to them.  I mean,  they just tbag in general.
---
I think you got confused I don’t think this is a market place
---
Stashing shit is not the point. You have exclusively focused on that as if it were the point and it is not. **The point** is that workshops need better indicators. *Or* they need to be clearly marked on the map, *not* simply as a discoverable locale. Workshops u der attack are clearly marked by an event symbol, even if that workshop has not been discovered by the player. There is *no* reason other events at workshops can not function the exact same way.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
If it kept diseases from expiring, then it might be viable.
---
Minigun, easily. But the shotgun can also do insane amounts of damage with the right build so really, both are great.
---
Because *stashing junk was not the point of the post but that is all you want to talk about.*
---
There have been so many posts made about similar situations like this. And the comments are always the same. 
---
Workshops. Are pvp zones. As simple as that. It doesn’t matter if you were just strolling by, it doesn’t matter what level you are. It doesn’t matter if you have pacifist on or not. If you go in a workshop zone, you are always in danger of having another person show up, try to claim the workshop and begin the fight. 
---
Just like you, so many people complain about losing their junk. How it just so happened to be the one and only time that they didn’t put their junk in their stash. Their stash box was too full. Etc. Etc. 
---
It definitely sucks to have all your junk taken away, specially if you were flux farming. But workshop pvp is part of the game. If you DON’T Want to be killed by another player, keep pacifist on 24/7 do you don’t accidentally start a pvp, and now hopefully you learned a lesson in paying attention where you wander off, and keep in mind that workshops are never safe. Even if you don’t see a player on your screen or in your map, they can be hiding with their Chinese stealth suit or a stealth boy. Workshops aren’t huge, exception being the airport, so you CAN go around it.
---
Answer me this honestly; *if you hadn’t lost any junk or flux, would you have been this upset?*

Here's what's coming on September 15th: One Wasteland, a damage nerf, Legendary Perks, some updated locations, the return of Vault 94, Daily Ops and Season 2. Yo Joe!
---
I’m near the munitions factory and vault 79 and I’ve have super mutants,robots, scorchedbeast and one other monster and they never register to defend my base the 10 rocket turrets and it never defends until it’s too late I had to redesign my base to even simple style and my base was already simple enough but had to rearrange everything which(needed to be done) but time consuming cause my things can’t protect whats I took the time to build
---
All the [76 diseases](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_diseases) and where you can catch them.
---
A damage nerf to what? PvE, or PvP?
---
Beat me to it.
---
Yes. I have played 76 since launch and was playing GTA daily, I’ve not played it in over a year. Totally different environment. 
---
When I walked into flat woods a high level came running past in nuka armor it was the coolest shit I’d ever seen. And I played FO 3, NV, and 4. But I’d never seen what power armor looked like from a distance.
---
The Life Saving armor only works if you're downed: if you take enough damage you'll skip to respawn
---
Sorry for that
---
No, I did not. I said multiple times exactly what happened. I dont know where you got the sequence of events mixed up, but you need to read again. At no point *prior to* fast traveling did I have *any* indication that there would be trouble because *as i said before* the workshop was not on my map. They appeared to be in the middle of absolutely nowhere when I fast traveled.
---
My "bad decision" was trying to save caps by traveling to a teammate's location when they were at a locale I had not previously discovered, which could happen in literally hundreds of places on the map. The only way to avoid this exact scenario in the future is to simply not fast travel to anywhere at all that I haven't already been. Duly noted.
---
Interested.
---
I think there’s one on the top of the tree where you get one of the key cards for the nuka power armor skin
---
It's a great all around weapon. The main downside for the SBQ fight is that she is immune to explosive damage. Also, you go through rounds very quickly.
---
No
---
I love the vending machine idea!, aswell as giving us different planters for every single harvestable plant looking thing
---
Id love different plant planter recipes as rewards the same way you can get different alcohol recipes from biv
---
It's an across the board nerf to all damage. They're changing the way they do damage the calculations.
---
You are right I made a claim so here is one: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/im2fm6/just_randomly_got_10k_atoms/
---
I mean there is an easy solution they would never do:
---
Account bound after picked up, cant be moved from aid category and has 0 weight
---
All dupes I've even caught wind of play with moving items (usually with stash/vendor) and server lag. Take that away and items cant be duped.
---
Happens to me on PC occasionally when Fast Travelling, drops out all the sound too. No idea what causes it but restarting game seems to be the only fix.
---
I had this happen to me once at 153 collected and when I dropped them all in a bag to transfer to an alt that had none it wouldn’t let me pick up a single one
---
Oh yeah a multi shot mod and Tesla arrows would be awesome. There is so much more potential for more arrow types. Like EMP arrows that are more effective against robots, radium arrow that inflict radiation damage or acid arrows that could drastically lower an enemies resistances on top of continuous damage.
---
Alright neat. I guess its good I havent been playing long enough to really get used to it then.
---
Well mystery solved. The one I bought was super cheap, I guess it was just someone being nice!
---
Nothing like a second sun to add to any day!
---
Lock on rockets ruined that game for me. I uninstalled when MK2 came out.
---
My poor Brahmin. Picked this mutation up without realising in the short window between switching from a shared starch to my own again. 
---
Took so long to figure out why my poor moo moo kept keeling over every time I went to camp xD
---
A lot less people too.
---
Awesome story! Thanks for sharing.
---
And they never said in there whether or not they spent any Atoms after the glitch happened. 
---
That’s the common trigger I’m seeing, whether a report is made or not; ***spending any of the Atoms.***
---
I don’t understand the your title but as far as Furious, it’s up to 50% until you miss. Consecutive shots is the key.
---
Two shot explosive weapons. A bloodied build is someone who deals more damage the lower their health, and so people will run around with HP bars full of roads to keep their health low so they can deal more damage. When I was around level 30, I was on a team with two 150+, we were all taken out in *seconds* by a couple of guys in the 40 or 50 range, because of their bloodied TSE builds. I stopped playing for a couple of months due to the overwhelming number of people running those builds and PVPing in Adventure mode rather than going over to Survival, which was a game mode *specifically designed* for PVP that most PVPers bitched about because it leveled the playing field, and they had much more fun hunting pacifists in Adventure Mode. I came back a while ago thinking that had changed.
---
The first step to troubleshooting something is turning it off and on again, you really should quit the game and start it again before reporting it as a bug. (I work in tech support and this is legit real advice)
---
Check the rest of your gear since wearing PA is the equivalent of taking all the rest of your armor off
---
I think they're should be more perks for bows as well under luck. Like a card when maxed that has a high chance for arrows to pierce or bleed damage.
---
Hello friend , you’re in the wrong subreddit.
---
ok now i get it i thought after enough hits the damage would go back to normal and you would have to get more hits again
---
So you're saying the explosive tesla I've had since the first month of the game should be disabled because other people abused bugs bethesda missed...
---
So why should I be punished for their crap?
---
But that plan came after that dope session...when it became available, u could only dupe items that could be sold to vendors....
---
They even stated specifically in one of the latest ITVs they're "adding nukashine as a reward to try something new". Whoever brilliant idea was that, for sure never played the game to know it won't feel as a reward in any sense.
---
No only just furious the others will be the same damage unless you got perks that raise damage for a certain amount of time
---
Replace the display case system with a new camp building category: "Clutter" crafted by ingame items and scrappable into the original item.
---
Allows you to place your junk, aid, misc, weapons etc anywhere, to take up camp budget and not stash budget.
---
suck my balls u pig
---
For the low price of 800 points or in a bundle only for 1750. Woohoo.
---
I absolutely hate the idea of the Infiltrator perk. It's a perk that many people will take just because of Bethesda's poor implementation of the perk card system. People don't need Infiltrator. They need the loadout manager so that swapping cards doesn't feel like entering the Konami code every single time.

It’s also a matter of integrity.

Since ive posted this I've completed the event like 3 times 😄

But today the game crashed in the middle of SBQ quest. Almost launched my controller into my TV 😂😂
---
I was trying to solo it in the scenario above hoping I might get at least 1 t-note for meeting the objective of keeping the guy alive until the timer ran out - even if no ore was collected.  (The worker I was guarding did survive)
---
Now I know even if there is a live worker at timer end, no ore = failed event = no reward (other than the XP, which was immaterial to me at the time)
---
Since you said there were fewer ghouls in the tunnels, I’m reasonably content with my weapons And armor (ergo, dont need legendaries for scrip) , dont really need XP until next season, and Now knowing you have to have a minimum of 25 ore to successfully complete the event, then I might try leaving the ghouls to the gunners and fetch ore
---
As a level 17 player. I prowl anyone's vendors for 1 cap a bullet prices and to scrape up on cheap plans. Got warehouse building stuff for dirt cheap.
---
That’s kinda rude you should’ve said “may you please suck my balls fellow gentleman”
---
I did verify when I got home.. without demolition expert the damage with mt two shot/33 vats hit chance/vats ap cost Gauss is 590. With the max rank.vard it is 794.
---
Do you really think you should "profit" off the f up Bethesda did by launching this game broken? The game is meant for everyone not just yourself. Explosive energy weapons shouldn't exist, same as "magic" weapons, same as hacked weapons, etc.

Bethesda Maryland dropped the ball and they gave a near impossible job to an under staffed BG Austin.

If it were single player game sure who cares, but those weapons do affect the experience of others. Maybe if they disable them for Adventure and enabled them for Private that would be cool, is that a fair compromise?
---
Fixers 25/25 or something more original? 😂
---
Now my favorite part is the downvotes.
---
Wait until you hit level 300. We all get together and jerk you off.
---
Absolutely I would have. Because 1) I had no indication of PVP happening in the area prior to fast traveling, 2) even if I hadn't dropped anything, he still shot at someone fleeing PVP and then taunted them, 3) any time anyone comes on this subreddit criticizing the way PVP is set up in this game, the PVPers come out to downvote them into silence.
---
Yes, I complained about losing my flux. So what?
---
The *frustrating part* of this is that Pacifist is *still* useless as it offers no protection, and PVPers are *still* rude to people who *actively* steer clear of PVP.
---
If you *wanted* PVP, there was an *entire game mode* devoted to it. Nobody used it because they'd rather get their rocks off chasing after people who avoided it, and thus it was removed. There is *still* a whole other game mode devoted to PVP, albeit a battle royale rather than casual slaughter. (I'm so sorry *that's* an inconvenience /s)
---
GET 'EM OUT BOYS, HE DID IT!!
---
'Magic damage' weapons don't get duplicated per se, since there are go many kinds that exhibit this behavior.  It's actually quite common to find a combination that can accomplish this.
---
Anybody got any of those lunch boxes..?? *scratches neck*
---
I am 1/1 on acp with total randoms. Can't beat that. 😂
---
Until you're done
---
We just got several new weapons
---
My bloodied minigun, and gauss rifle also have an increase in damage with the same perk card :). I tested the damage numbers on a few enemies, so I know this is true.
---
I don’t believe you.
---
Great description
---
Username checks out
---
But legacy weapons do, i always find at least 1 person running an explosive gatling plasma, always, in every server I go to.
---
It used to be the worst heavy now its the most annoying heavy.
---
I just can't... this always kills me.
---
It has happened to me a couple of times on PC also. I was thinking it might be related to me minimizing the screen. I would minimize the game during loading to look at reddit.....
---
Earlier a level 17 asked me to help him level and gave me a radaway saying it looked like I needed it, I'm also bloodied commando
---
*Present them.*
---
I'm gonna be real with you. I genuinely think it is impossible to solo earl no matter what you have. With all the spawn and the aoe damage if you stand in just the wrong spot i doubt it would be possible to do enough damage to kill him.
---
Don’t know about if they buffed the engagement of the Turrets (They should.) but my Heavy Laser Turrets on the PTS were level 50 in The Forest.
---
Honestly, I think the perk “Bow before me”should have, on top of it ignoring an enemies armor, have the chance to cripple and enemies leg/s instead of potentially staggering it. And then rename this perk card to “Arrow to the knee.”
---
It’s weird because I’ve said in other comments that I tend to always miss the first shot at 95% vats but the others following it seem to always land.
---
Good news, you don't have to! And I don't care. People nuke Whitespring literally all the time. If it was about the fluxes, I wouldn't have bothered posting. This is about the fact that this dude saw me moving away from him and still killed me anyway because he had the ability. The only relevancy of the flux was that was the thing he proceeded to taunt me about. PVP has been a fucking problem in this game since ***day one*** and every suggestiin towards rectifying that problem is mef with people who seek any way to justify it exactly as it it.
---
For lead scrap, the Responder vendor at Camden Park sells a bunch of paint. Also paint on West-Tek roof but it’s often looted already. The silo weight rooms are good too.
---
For ore, Breach and Clear is my personal favorite. Lucky Hole has more but I don’t love the location.
---
Consider most of the larger events... they are full of mobs... you get boosted XP on every mob AND the event if you do builders. IF you only do Event team, you only get extra XP when the event is over and you get your rewards.
---
I choose builders because of this. Just make sure to tag EVERYTHING, even if you can't kill it.  A good fast explosive weapon will help with this too (I use  10mm explosive pistol).   Events like SBQ, ACP, Line in the Sand, etc will get you a truckload of XP for everything you hit.
---
Yes, I wasn't talking about those.  They are an issue, and a complex one, but 'magic' weapons are separate and a completely different issue.
---
I just got a bloodied, ffr, 90%WR. Is it the God roll I think it is?
---
Yea i mean some working weapon like i do pistol but gauss pistol is horrible, nobody uses it and its even bugged. I would like to see that rifle cartridge pistol from Fallout 2 but with some nice prefix something like when i hit headshot without vats it does 300% damage or just something like that. Man iam so bored and frustrated when i go into game, their lack of inovations and ideas killing me, sorry for being pesimistic.
---
Yeah there's so much cool shit they could do with bows without making them OP. But it is bethesda...
---
Git gud and stop dying
---
Awesome sauce.
---
Took about 3-4 weeks to grind both to max.
---
Ahhh i see. Well im built arround heavy weapons and im pretty sure i got rid of most of my ammo for everything else than that
---
I have no sympathy for you. You’ve still not acknowledged that you learned anything relevant from this.
---
 I found foundation to be less annoying than dealing with the raiders. You get a special gun when you side with the raiders  It's not a must have gun though.
---
Yes and no.  Remember we're talking bethesda speed here.  I expect this will be the first step to overall balance, so the multiplicitive(sp?) to additive had to happen.
---
I wager perk buffs, enemy debuffs, and etc will hit a few patches down.
---
I doubt it will be tactful, and will almost certainly be heavyhanded, but they'll come.
---
This is the devs that thought that one rifle skin was OK to ship.  The downs are just part of the course.
---
I rarely tussle with the likes of mire and scorch queens, so the fact that i might get some more gameplay to go along with my farming and goofing off seems like a solid deal.
---
So, yes, the current meta has just been shrunk in scale, but again, math wise all systems have been brought into line, literally.  Before if they tugged on one string a dozen others might come with it.  Now, they can actually pick and choose what they want and pretty much fire and forget about tweaks as they go.
---
Well I had a friend who said he had extra plans but he hasn't been on in a week and I'm worried something happened to him
---
Do Orbital Strikes still damage camps or did they fix that?  If not, that's always an option as well if you have that done the quest line to get them.
---
To be honest, these kinds of people seem rare on PC.  I've not seen a whole lot of trap camps and the few I've seen always look shady enough (or you can see the punjis and flamethrowers as the camp loads in) that I can avoid them.
---
Hi! I only recently saw this and my anecdote is all i can provide but heres my example
---
I had previous crafted about 50 gauss miniguns hoping for a bloodied, the day I finally did craft one i had also looted a bloodied mr handy blade, and ultracite gat laser. All on the same public server.
---
Player vendor hopping is the way. Most of my best gear comes from there.
---
Could I please have a few. I'm planning in getting the plans to start producing them as gifts for travelers
---
Nope.  There's already a respec system and changing it would shaft the players that have already used it.
---
He probably stopped playing since it’s not fun much anymore a lot of people do this because they’re ready to move on
---
Minigun.  But honestly 50 cal is fine.
---
My marine unyielding armor disappeared from me  awhile back idk could be from this exploit..
---
This isn't true.
---
Ah ok, but what do they do with their inventories and bases and everything?
---
I'll buy em or trade em
---
Junkies pipe pistols are not that bad with the em right roll and build.
---
Then you have nothing relevant to add to the conversation and may see yourself out. Good night.
---
Is that even possible? lol
---
Pretty sure I've done that one with a lead pipe solo because I was dumb and forgot to bring bullets.
---
The person or Bethesda? If it’s Bethesda they do nothing with them everything will still be on them and base will still be fine
---
We are getting a new 2h melee weapon with the next patch, the [war glaive](https://youtu.be/GaFRMzMJRSY). Also, you will be able to get the plans for The Gutter, that unique assaultron blade you get as a reward from The Burrows quest. I suppose, if you know the plan, you will be able to get legendary versions of it, like The Fixer.
---
Besides that, we don't know anything yet. They said the BOS dlc is going to include new weapons and armor, but they didn't give more info about it.
---
Yup... This glitch fucking blows
---
How am I profiting? 
---
How does my ZE tesla give me an edge?
---
Explosive energy guns break easy and quick and I do more damage with my bloodied Fixer then my crappy lagacy but it is fun to use...
---
Other legacies are "magic" which is broken damage calculation but those magic guns also exist in non legacies...
---
You know what ruins the game the junkies ffr .50 cal on my second character or my junkies mini gun I cant use because half the time it triggers a near instant kill on bosses.
---
So again why should I lose my fun legit ZE Tesla because others duped?
---
They put the guns in the drop table and now they exist get over it and stop asking for those of us who didn't do anything wrong to have stuff taken away we got legitimately.
---
Dont like it go play something else.
---
And it could let the downsides of the diseases be less bad. Like 50% less penalty or something.
---
I vouch this I play dayz as well
---
Im attempting this now..so to make sure im doing it right..i place down a fooundation...stack a bunch of vault tech gennys..store it ..now place the regular gennys scrap it.. NOW lay the samr blue print back down and store it the same way...then regualr gennys scrapped the same way?
---
Nah. I still want to remind you of something before I go.
---
I presume. I don't utilize "builds". I simply play the game to enjoy it. (Which is fairly easy when you can avoid the PVPers.)
---
Bethesda knows about this already, but haven't said anything about it.
---
This is not a bartering sub.
---
If you run with mutations - and you should dump lone survivor and get strange in numbers, add gunfu level 3 and you become a one-hitting blender of destruction.
---
South Park miss chokes on dick
---
U are kind to answer thank you. Would be nice to see some effect for specific weapons that makes gameplay little bit more interesting instead of random legendary effects all over again on every otem. Thank you again!
---
You can completely avoid the PvPers.
---
I know I was saying what I'd do to get em tho
---
I always prefer to think of this game as like a Fallout Sandbox game, low on story but high on just random team content. I actually now enjoy that it costs caps to fast travel because it makes teaming up that much stronger if people have camps all over.
---
I also love how my camp is much more consolidated and significant. People actually come and visit it all the time so I actually care about the building in this game. I sank a huge chunk of time into the building aspect, and it really pays off to get people interested in your camp because they're more likely to spend caps at your vending machines.
---
The people. If they leave the game, will they spend all their caps and give their loot away and stuff?
---
Why? they are like "endgame" permabuffs, considering how expensive they are Caps and Perk wise. The incentive to avoid them would be to save money and perk slots, plus the added immersion of not jumping super high etc
---
Yeah, but have you posted it on reddit lately? Because it's such a monumental thing to show people. Make sure you say how many hours it took you too
---
In a recent interview, Jeff Gardiner has confirmed that we'll be getting mannequins and power armor stands. And even better, instanced fallout shelters where we'll finally get more build budget.
---
Your combined spent special is what makes more cards show up.  
---
My shotgun char went 10 levels without spending a point and no new perks showed up than those available at level 2.
---
The event is poorly conceived, there is little to no reward for being an ore collector compared to farming the ads. Collecting ore should give you good xp then everyone would be taking turns between defending and collecting, as it stands now with the legendary runs and up coming legendary cards getting xp and ranks is the current end game content.
---
That's why I rarely collect ore, I have the Emmet suit I'm not that bothered by the rad barrel plan and I have more treasury notes than I can hand in.
---
Maybe, the actual plans go for around 2-3 hundred and are always in stock in the Enclave Bunker.
---
Literally the only reason I mentioned the flux was because that was what he opened with after he shot me in the back.
---
The problem is PVPers who insist on shooting at people who are clearly not interested, as well as workshops not being visible on the map until after you have discovered them. It was unfortunate that in this case the workshop was being contested when I discovered it with my death. I had no indication of what was going on until after I had fast traveled in. This needs to be changed. It *can* be changed, and it should.
---
Same, i buffed the shotguns and my power armor, amd crafting stuff, may not be the best, but it checks out.
---
I used profit in parenthesis. Do you agree there are a lot of duped legecy weapons that should not exist and break the game? Like certain magic weapons?
---
The instanced fallout shelters is where we'll be getting that big budget increase.
---
East of South Mountain Lookout next to Foundation. Just logged on to double check the map
---
It's a lot of raw data in that thread that helps OP understand how fo76's rng works. :)
---
I looked at the data, not necessarily the author's conclusions.
---
Confirmation bias much?
---
No, it doesn’t. Your alleged situation was a bizarre fluke and was easily avoided.
---
To be honest, I don't run any buffs. I collect everything I find, scrap it, store it, and wait for nukes. Side quests are cool too. But there are still some serious issues in the game that push away certain types of players.
---
Poseidon power plant.
---
I used to do it every time.... then got sick of people quick killing the legendary spawns while I did the non-legendary clean up, the ore collection, and the  turret repairs.
---
Nah, i think I'll just blow up your camp instead.
---
Yeah that's pretty cheap I paid quite a few thousand more for them
---
Empath is good now with public Teams, especially if you run Strange in Numbers and Class Freak, the added defense is almost like Lone Wanderer. Check AngryTurtle's video on it. Egg Head is a huge exp gain boost as well, if you're into that
---
Maybe a workshop type area that that has like individual segmented plots people could claim. It could also have a huge scorched defense event where they have to walk down a main street so people could build turrets or traps in front of their little plots to aid the defenses. They could be standardized in their size and shape so that when you log in, it could just assign you a random one so you don't have to server hop to put your camp back in the exact spot.
---
Just pitching ideas, but I'd love to see what you said implemented, anything to get more cooperation going, I love that aspect of the game!
---
Simply take screenshots of the operation complete screens. Then you will know how many you've done. If Bethesda doesn't give you the pennant, ATTACH the images to a support ticket saying GIB MAH STUFFS!!!
---
It's almost as if... it's actually random.
---
So, you wait for other players to create nuke zones instead of running your own silos?
---
Sounds like you need to ditch the mega sloth pet for the might mole pet.
---
-Todd probably
---
It's fun? Seems like a valid reason.
---
I enjoy it. It is very bullet sponges, but other than that I think it’s the best part of the game right now.
---
Do the daily mission everyday and not miss one, about 4 ish weeks.
---
Tbh I want survival mode back.. It was a nice chsnge of pace from the calm world
---
I use a bloodied lever with limb damage and equip tormentor when fighting Earle.
---
Head shots are easier to make while he is on the ground and he can't attack with his feet. 
---
I sit in an excavator bucket one shotting wendigos building adrenalin then I concentrate my fire on Earle. Once he is on the ground my rifle hits at around 650 damage when he is in my general area.
---
I'll take a front pack please
---
1000 is the limit no matter what
---
But sometimes it can be such a Lonesome Road
---
This happened to me a few times (ps4) and was told it is a glitch that occurs when using melee weapons with flying  insects.  It checked out for me since the few times it happened to me that was exactly what I was doing at the time.  Now I never melee with flying insects and haven't had the problem since.  Don't know if it is the same for you, but I hope this helps.
---
Thats why data like from a users post on this thread is great: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ij674n/i_crafted_300_pieces_of_ss_armor_and_recorded/g3bsz74?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3
---
There's a disproportionate repeat of the same roll on one attribute consistent throughout much of the data.
---
I believe its the 10th to the 14th.
---
Yeah, it's pretty stupid to die in a game where everything works towards you dying.
---
Perfect thanks so much !
---
Glad you cooperated. Would have been a shame if my squad shot you down for making any offensive counter-suggestion instead of giving in.
---
So far I’m only participating in it to get the reclaimed deep mining gas mask. It’s all I need then I have all of ACP’s rewards.
---
Cool. Go do so in the right sub.
---
😂
---
She brings on to herself.
---
If keep hearing them every 20 secs, they must pay the price! LOL
---
Wow, you are the really are the definition of pacifist, i gotta get some damage to kill stuff in missions, but right now that i got alot of junk, got the 200% repair for weapons and power armor, like 40 fully charged fusion cores, and the perk card that running consume no extra fusion core energy, so i dont use alot of junk, im basically *STONKS*. What level are you? And what you play(PC, Xbox, PS4)?
---
If you play Assassin's and you are happy with your damage output, well, that's it.
---
I play Bloodied Unyielding and keep a set of Assassin's in the stash. Damage output is eight or ten times higher when you are bloodied + Radicool + Unyielding.
---
Depends on the person but for me if the game is still active and I stop playing I’ll do that
---
I have a fully modded bezerkers combat rifle in my stash box just in case bezerkers gets their justified buff.
---
Why were you joining a private team with someone random?
---
Ahhhhh
---
I would love to agree but I also have to disagree here. While I will happily fight you anytime you like at any workshop if you’re on Xbox, we behave way too different from the dumbass AI and sometimes we’re better equipped, other times not.
---
I had a guy attack me for a workshop once and then leave and go destroy my camp.  Had that same feeling about not wanting to play bc of some jerk.  I’m also PC so send me pm if you need more friends.  A lot of mine have quit lately.
---
I thought the guy was doing the same quest as me (which he was). He sent me an invite and I accepted.
---
The folksI used to run missile silos with no longer play, for various reasons. I have a few friends who are too new to run silos currently. Once they are of high enough level, we thankfully won't have to deal with other players at all, as one of us has FO1st and will be able to host private worlds.
---
And that is my *last* response to you.
---
If you have pacifist on, and you’re not in a workshop, let the other guy shoot you as many times as you want. He’s just wasting ammo, he gets a notification saying you’re in pacifist, so trust me, he knows you aren’t into pvp. So unless you decide to go to settings and turn that off, you’ll never ever be involved in a. Pvp
---
There are refrigerated backpack mods, food spoilage and food carry weight, and there are Atom Shop refrigerators. Just learn the plan of a food that seems good, search up or look for locations with the ingredients and start memorizing. Some of the ingredients are rare as well, like Sugar Bombs for the INT boost food, or Megasloth Mushrooms for the Crit Buff soup. The spoilage rate on ingredients is a downer, but it gets longer as soon as you have crafted something out of it.
---
It is a shame the game can't take it, because it should be a valid tactic to win the fight. 
---
The game allows you to do it, after all. It's not off-limits.
---
First I don't think duped stuff should exist but it does and its not going anywhere.
---
Second they have no way to identify duped vs legit, they have no way of knowing who knows they have duped stuff and who doesn't. Your asking for them to punish everyone because of some bad apples.
---
Example recently earle dropped me a J2525 handmade which was legit drop of a gun that was also duped and I traded for a B2525 handmade which is also heavily duped but the one I got may not have been dupped and so I should lose that gun which I traded for a gun I got legit? See this is the problem you want countless people who didn't do anything wrong punished.
---
Third there are legit not duped weapons that trigger magic. So even if you get rid of legacies the problem isnt gone most magic I see done isn't even a legacy.
---
The problem is in the damage calculations and errors and I think the first step to fix that is being taken by them changing how calculations work behind the scene and make them easier to work with. 
---
My point remains you attack legacies but your real problem seems to be with duping and bad damage calculations which can be triggered by a few effects that are not legacy like junkies is magic or having armor with block damage or having guns which legit go over a certain fire rate...
---
So again why should my non magic useless not duped but fun legacy be taken from me or disabled?
---
Or why should stuff I traded for which I have 0 way of knowing if it was a dupe or legit be taken from me.
---
So even if they can identify duped items they can't prove who has one from bad intentions and who has them because they traded for them. Legacies or not you're still asking for players who didn't do anything wrong to have stuff taken away and that's the problem.
---
Not everyone assumes the game is broken and if you join teams with someone they will F your base up.  
---
I had a guy write the N word in may camp with small letters.
---
This is the first encounter with PVP I've had since coming back from hiatus. When I left, PVP was still easily done with the right TSE and a bloodied build. Now that I know I can't be killed, I'll try to avoid panicking.
---
Oh man.  I want that thing gone.
---
Follow the guide, you will find de way. You just gotta move your special around and have the perks.
---
I just recently realized there's a toilet to the right of the workbenches as well. Those teddies in there have some digging to do
---
I’d be fine with revamping it.  Shouldn’t take 30 levels to respec your guy.  Level 245 btw
---
Sometimes I wonder how such a game like Fallout 76 ever got such a friendly community for the most part.
---
I have experienced this guy. His camp was by top of the world...
---
Ah ok
---
Run the silo yourself instead of expecting others to do it for you.
---
And use your own private world.
---
You definitely seem like you avoid taking any personal responsibility for anything in this game.
---
Yeah, I'd like to see more stuff like that added. Unique legendary items that are really unique, with their own legendary effects which you can't find anywhere else, and not the "uniques" we have right now.
---
The Vault 94 sets were a step forward, but poorly executed in my opinion. Mostly because how buggy the raid was and the ridiculous grind for mats.
---
I hope they go back to this concept in the future, and find more ways to introduce new legendaries like those.
---
I've only had it happen when fast traveling. It was a common occurrence for me last year then it was gone, but has happened twice this week. I'm ps4 as well. No clue but only restarting from main menu fixes it.
---
That’s what I use, I have a lvl 50 heavy rocket super sledge (it also has 40% faster swing speed). I haven’t really found any other two handed melee weapons to be worth it. I’ve considered switching to unarmed damaged as I’ve got a heated bloodied powerfist that does decent damage too. 
---
During meat week, I got the tenderizer plan though, so I’m curious to see if I might be able to get a bloodied tenderizer. It does decent damage without being bloodied so I can only hope. 
---
I had a level 10 bloodied sledgehammer and tbh it carried me to level 35. At that point I switched to a bloodied pick axe for 15 levels and then switched to the super sledge. 
---
If you’re interested in going back to the bloodied build I definitely also suggest Radicool, 
---
2 more for a melee build, id recommend bloody mess &amp; makeshift warrior
---
My bloodied + limb damage shotgun is not only magic, but able to fully cripple him with a single shot + Enforcer. 
---
I usually keep him crippled and kill wendigos.
---
It’s not a broken feature for your private team members to have the ability to build on your camp.
---
Don’t worry at least you’re still a low level I’m 150 and I haven’t pulled 1 bloodied weapon by myself or any good weapons at all I too have to use melee weapons because I have no good guns
---
If I didn’t get that surprise in the PTS, I’d have missed out too.  I’m usually at 850+.  It would be nice to claim it later, as some kind of consumable or token, but some jackass would probably figure out how to dupe it.
---
I have a Bloodied Explosive Fixer, modded to shoot .38. I equip it as soon as I collect 1K of .38. 
---
It causes a lot of damage, and it goes back to the stash when I ran out of ammo.
---
You can move camps, but they will always eat up a portion of your budget.  This person griefed you hard.  Report them
---
Being on a team with someone that flags for PvP does not flag you for PvP. Keep Pacifist on, don’t pick any player owned locks, stay out of workshops, and you’ll be fine.
---
I gotta try it out. I’m just using a power fist right now. I think it’s an anti-armor? It’s pretty great. But I love the aim with bows. You can hit one guy from a good distance and watch them all try to find where it’s coming from.
---
"Lights in the sky. It's communication. It's intent."
---
I get it, Punk. I get it.
---
I want to never hear the woosh of someone's Blood Eagle totem in my ears again.
---
At level 19 (I'm 22 now from it all) I joined the event where there's hordes of scorch beasts and ghouls etc and the event where you are in the mine that's falling apart with a couple of online ransoms, won both as I didn't damage bosses alot but I got my shots in and i got to do both of these events twice each because of awsome players, and I could only stay alive in power armour so I had to ask one guy for a fusion core, dude gave me 2! Great community
---
Ik it's going to be across the board, I'm saying that it will be most notable for builds that do thousands of damage a hit
---
I just want to stick it in my stash, so all I’m carrying is my missile tape and my 100+ government aid drops.
---
God. This...this so fucking much.
---
Yeah, just pay for 1st? Not paying is so dumb?!?
---
Awesome!
---
How do even mule in this game?
---
Man screw gta, it has wholesome player's but not enough nice guys and it's system for grinding is not worth while very tiresome
---
I don't have enough camp space for it so I haven't even heard it lmaoooo 
---
Is it that bad?
---
Good to know, didn't realize this would pretty much take up budget indefinitely.
---
And lol @ uptight people who don't realize that Fallout *is* glitches.
---
This has been my experience as well... I posted in this sub last week about getting ganked at a workshop by a player who was at a much higher level than me, and I got downvoted really hard with people being rude and saying "don't you know workshops are PVP" and "it's you're own fault". But in my experience (on Xbox), I have only been helped by higher levels, except that one time.  I think helping new or lower players out is the norm from what I've seen!!  Been given chems, stimpacks, plans, outfits, weapons and ammo -  heaps of help when I've been outnumbered on the battlefield - it's great!! And I try to help players who are lower than me now where I can.  ❤️
---
I play in windowed fullscreen, so the game is always in the foreground for me, I do browse reddit while playing but its on a separate screen and seems unrelated for me. with the FT version of this bug atleast, it was reproducible at certain locations (I had a camp near flatwoods where about 50% of the time I FT'd back to it the screen would go black).
---
I like a Slowcum Joe Collectron to match my Slocum Vendor bot.
---
The effects stack. There's no real limit to stacking AP refresh speed from armor/consumables/perks, but there are definitely diminishing returns.
---
As a side note, your refresh speed isn't related to your total amount of AP. A character with 200 AP and 400 AP will refresh from 0 at the exact same rate, it'll just take the character with 400 twice as long in VATS/sprinting to hit 0.

Yeah, I was just trying to get the basics first. Chrome and shiny black would be killer too!
---
The equation is based on your Luck stat.  I forget the exact formula, but it’s something like (LUCKx4) / #tries.  You can get it in about 12 tries with a Luck of 10+, and pretty often with 20+.  It was the same on Fo4.
---
Yes, all will stack but with dimishing returns. Meaning each ap refresh effect will be less and less effective, be that armor effect, perk etc..
---
I've got one stuck in my camp too, I tried removing all the foundations it was stood on but it just ended up floating there
---
I don't think it can be removed
---
I'm kinda curious on this as I couldn't really find an answer myself. I wanted to know how much you could stack including action boy/girl, nerd rage, lone survivor, and ultralightweight
---
I literally cringe when I fast travel to someone's camp and I can hear it. I feel bad because it looks SO cool but I hate the constant noise so much.
---
Can a public teammate build anything in your camp?
---
Don't join private teams unless you know the people. Public teams don't allow people to build at your camp.
---
I would absolutely accept more of Punk's ridiculous lines if he got a fleshed out story/questline like Sofia and Beckett. I want to know more about this conspiracy theory network!
---
I'll admit I had avoided this game like crazy due to all the early bad mouthing of the game going on. Started it last month and I've really been enjoying myself. Only one instance of someone being a dick, and that was by destroying the few turrets I had setup at my camp.
---
Though I'm reaching the end of all the stories now, so I'm not sure how much more I'll keep going as the daily grind thing is not my cup of tea.  So for the moment, I'm exploring for the last few places I haven't found yet and possible getting a proper power armor suit built.
---
Thank you for the responses guys, I let my guard down and got screwed. Live and learn
---
Thanks
---
No, only private teammates. Always stick to public teams unless you explicitly know and trust the other players.
---
I dumped the govt tapes a few months ago and only carry the silo tape and Filcher Farm.  The govt tapes are too much of a hassle for nothing worthwhile.  I don’t need pink baseball bats and 100 cloth.
---
You need to Prime that LMG, friend.  It’s much easier.  Nuke the Whitespring and go HAM.
---
I think the down vote isn't toward you but the nerfing of the damage.
---
ESO has a somewhat similar transmog systems. As my mage, I was able to to combine different combinations or robes, hoods, belts, etc. Once I got the perfect set up, I could then pick out several dyes for each piece of armor. It was not fully customizable like your request. But it wasn't that bad either.
---
Yep.
---
The best online community because it's full rpg single players.love you guys!
---
AMS also has a Fancy Framed Lighthouse photo, which pairs really nicely with the clean trifold &amp; one of the lighthouse souvenirs in a display case. There's also a clean, undamaged box of Abraxo in the bathroom, which works nicely for kitchen/bathroom displays.
---
Maybe if they compensated me all those levels.
---
I've gotten find time to do it on a private server. Last time I missed out on everything cause of where I fast traveled. Tho I did just pick up a furious 50 cal and a two shot/90% auto grenade launcher for 200 caps each, so I'm probably gonna mess around with them for a while. I've already blown myself up with this grenade launcher lmao.

---
"Killing me on ammo" doesn't sound fun to me.
---
Until you get blown up after the imposter is dead. Or some remaining enemy hacks you to pieces after SBQ. 
---
They need to change this mechanic to extend for some minutes after the event is over as long as you're still in the event area.
---
Wendigos have always had a 100% chance to drop screws. I guess they didn't want to make it so the wendigo spawns had no loot so just kept it the same.
---
I don't really understand the big deal;  I run the event solo all the time on my private server.
---
You can get the 25 ore (needed for level 1) in 2.5 trips, it takes no time at all for one person to do it.
---
And I imagine most people don't care about getting higher than level 1.

My camp is gonna be wrecked everytime I come back...
---
Yeah, Monster hunter and read dead also aloe to combos, honestly is so much fun to create the perfect outfit 😩
---
I agree, something screwy is going on here...
---
Reminds me I saw a player today who designed their character to look 100% like the overseer. XD  
---
Or was that the devs Moderator character I heard them playing with the concept of before??
---
Fireproof perk or a dense torso mod if you don’t use power armor.  A TS launcher will probably break in less than a mag at a crowded event, just so you know.
---
A furious 50 is a nice find.  What other effects?
---
Beautiful! What a great view!!
---
Store where? Puny stash is full, got no 1st, game can't transfer items to mule...
---
Bullshit advice for a bullshit problem created by bullshit game mechanics.
---
Wendigos drop them. Always have. Only difference is before ACP, we didn't have so many wendigos to farm. 
---
It's like doing Uranium Fever and asking why the rubber, aluminum and black titanium.
---
I’d be happy with more items to buy...and not just cosmetics from the legendary run. I have almost 4500 gold and 500 treasury notes and nothing to use them on
---
I would be fine with that too. I mean if they just made it so different color clothing could spawn in random locations or be purchased from vendor bots that would be cool too. No need to add a dye system. Maybe even add some red rocket or nukacola graphic tees to atom shop would be a nice addition
---
Yeah, Monster hunter and read dead also allow to combo, honestly is so much fun to create the perfect outfit, however, Bethesda probably would break the entire game trying to implement this 😩
---
Current PTS Daily Challenges give 2,750 SCORE
---
Current PTS Weekly Challenges give 12,000 SCORE plus the repeatable
---
A level 50 Scorched killed at Tyler County can yield over 100 XP depending on build and buffs
---
The board has 100 ranks just like this season.
---
Yeah, if you have 4 people actually coordinating and playing as a real team, it's a piece of cake.
---
Meanwhile a dozen solo players each most concerned with getting as many legendaries as possible will often fail.
---
So it goes.
---
I believe those score values are way increased for the PTS
---
Just bashing damage, I forget the percent, but for 200 caps it's a nice find. And the grenade launcher is the vats chance increase.
---
I second this . I would love to have the raider graffiti for my camp. It works like posters. I made raider graffiti for fallout 4. I was like ... why is there no graffiti ??? Its very easy to do. I did it and I don't have a degree in computer graphics or game design.
---
Probably right.
---
🤣
---
It's dumb how quick you can get notes and how the bullion is capped. I played a few hours every day and had to wait 4 days just to cash in all the treasury notes I earned
---
I don't remember buying this plan. I think I've gotten them from workshops. All of my characters seem to have it so it can't be that uncommon.
---
Is he looking for the fixer plan or the weapon itself? I assume it’s the plan since he’s doing the event
---
Dang it I’m psn or I would’ve given you a fixer plan. Congrats on anniversary.  I bet someone will give you one.  There’s a lot of good people out here.
---
Just embrace the IP. There are many games out there that are 100% safe, and honestly if Fallout 76 didn't have some danger it would be a disservice.   
---
I think you did learn a valuable lesson though, and their contribution has given you a more positive toolkit. I think they reminded you that you should proactive and cautious. Most of what we consider safe behavior  in public or work formed from the truth that 95% of the time we're safe, so we get complacent. 5% is why we have those rules/habits/customs.  
---
And, again, someone might say: But this is a game! To which I say, it's a Fallout game. There is a good reason the tagline is "War never changes". So try to spin this as a growing moment that actually can inform your IRL to boot. Cheers, good luck in the wasteland.
---
Ok foody
---
Aw thank you. Yeah he really wants the plan and it's such a low chance and he's never gotten it and all he does is farm caps, finish the event, and nothing. His luck is God awful. Thank you for the help if you could. I appreciate it
---
Yeah the plan

The people who tag the legendary and then just spam the follow gesture are the real heroes of this event.
---
Eh, the adds drop ammo, I don't use much more than I do vs a Queen once I loot all the adds.
---
Less than 3min to server hop, not too bad
---
Hi I accidentally replied to you to somebody else. Thank you so much. Too bad crossplay is not a thing. I really appreciate the thought
---
I had a fixer once but didn’t know how to stack perks and what not. I got rid of it. Now I’m missing badly.
---
Oh I see now, I recommend editing the post to include plan in it to make it clear to people you want the plan and not the weapon itself so it doesn’t confuse anybody
---
I wish if he was on PS4, I have a spare plan sitting around that I’d gladly give to someone struggling with getting it
---
funny enough we know how thats gone more than 200 years later, its an absolute joke. they aspire to horde tech (pretty much just weapons) and use them to kill every creature (sentient or not) and then call it everything but genocide.
---
BoS have NEVER been the good guys, they just horde tech to consolidate power thats it, just a bully with a bigger gun.
---
lyons brotherhood was the only time they did anything even remotely positive, and those efforts caused a revolt in their ranks than eventually came back after maxon took over and  sarah lyons "died in combat" and almost certainly lead to even more hardline genocidal policies in the end.
---
fuck knows what terrible thing they will do next after boston.
---
the only thing we stand to learn in 76 is how the corruption from roger maxons original value set happens, but we know it does no matter what happens in Appalachia. we already know that the brotherhood east and west eventually end up as fucked up hereditary dictatorship bent on stealing laser pistols and building death machines. the whole "seed of knowledge to ensure humanity can rebuild in the future" is BS, in 200 years they achieve fuckall.
---
I'm over level 500 and all I want is a Bloodied FF handmade/Fixer. I trade a Bloodied Tesla for a normal Bloodied Handmade.
---
Walking away with a minimum of 200 screws per event. I feel like a wasteland billionaire. 
---
Radium rifle mods are almost complete thanks to this event!
---
It will leave your budget eventually after enough rebuilding. 
---
Not sure what I did but I eventually moved enough times and the "phantom budget" eventually went away for me.
---
That's what the other person said.  So I recommended to stop doing it if it's so hard on ammo.
---
Thank you for the thought. I edited the post. He's been getting on everyday this week doing it like twice a day. He gets such bad luck so I'm not surprised to hear he hasn't gotten it with the 10% chance
---
There's some fun cosmetics and extras... regardless of all the complaints. they don't have to do this, free fun is free fun! :D  Mostly excited about camp stuff.
---
He said it would be so good for his build
---
I dont have a plan but Im happy to farm encrypted with you until we get one. I have 3 or 4 cards to recall him.  gt lockedterror145
---
You’re right. Just think walking away with 300+ screws is different here!
---
Colonel Gutsy: "Sharing is for commie scum"
---
&gt; Ummm it has a recommended level like all of the events do?
---
It actually doesn't. Go and read it again, Bethesda forgot to put one on.
---
They're assuming the position.
---
and here I am, almost finishing to buy every single gold bullion plan available in game. only strangler heart and t65 and its mods to go.
---
Can somebody explain to me what this is from? Third time I’ve seen it in this sub. Is is some inside joke that I wasn’t apart of?
---
This is actually pretty damn amazing.  I had no idea the character creation tools could make someone like this....
---
... time to make a new character.
---
Yeah it’s a low chance, I also struggled with it for quite sometime until I ended up just buying it from someone. 
---
The funny thing is that I got the plan from the event a day after I bought it, it was a FML moment
---
Well I wish you luck and hopefully someone out there could help you guys out without charging you too much in case you’re honest and your boyfriend is actually struggling with it
---
I'm really low level like I think 30 something so idk if I could even help  I'm looking to surprise him as a gift but if I hear nothing tonight from anybody he would be happy to farm it
---
Xb1? I have some
---
I will see if I have the plan in a few minutes. If I do, it's yours.
---
I find that if you put legendaries- any legendaries- in your vendors for low enough prices you'll have a good business. 
---
I have returning customers and I get cleaned out frequently. It's a good &amp; steady supply of caps and I'm quite happy with it! 
---
So I mean, they have some use. Make a business out of selling legendaries. I will sell some yuck ones, but I mostly turn them in to save for better ones that I can sell for higher or that I know someone might want (but still discounted!).
---
When I'm out of scrip for the day, all the junk legendaries go in my vendor for super cheap until they sell or the next day when I can turn them in. It's a good system.
---
Haha yeah I actually gave him all my caps and he told me to keep 2000 caps for me if I ever come back to the game. He farmed it 2 more times cuz I used to have 6k caps. I traveled to camps looking for it but nothing. Thank you
---
Yup. Just work around it.
---
Clear stash of garbage. You never need things like leather, bone, cloth
---
I really dislike this event but do it for rare outifts everything is underlvld and if ur lucky you'll get a legendary cuz people one shot all the time
---
For a short time fix while Bethesda takes 8 months to fix it is too press x on the item that you want to see and the full discription will apprear just don’t press x again or you’ll buy the item 👍
---
I thought you couldn't get revenge if they kill you when  you're wanted? Which I agree with, because I have good guns, gauss primed guns and TSEs, but am no PVP professional, but I will kill you if you're wanted. Usually I won't bother if the bounty is 5 caps and you're a lower level, because newbies make mistakes. But what's the point of going after wanted people, if they can come get revenge?
---
OK, but it is still fun.
---
An angel! Thank you! I'm giving you all my good luck
---
You can't put an item "in a backpack", so I'm dismissing this entire post as bs based on that alone.
---
I’m always down for a good fight. Not the most experienced pvper though if you’re looking for someone more serious.
---
That’s awesome! Congrats
---
Until you grow old and grey lol! It’s such a grind but super worth it...I just maxed foundation yesterday! Gauss Shotgun baby!!!
---
It's broken in that anyone can do that to other people, or themselves.  It's a bug that hasn't been fix, hence 'broken'.
---
Not everyone lives on this sub, there are a TON of people that don't know someone can screw with you this bad just by teaming up using the in-game features. If there was a big warning message on login about avoiding it, that would be different.  I'm not sure I've even seen BGS acknowledge this issue.
---
I wish that the builds and teams were more strategy based. Rather than who can do the most damage, there could be medics, tanks, pyromaniacs, team stat boosters, etc.
---
I hear you 100%.  I swear I’ve spent half my levels just moving attributes.
---
There are plenty of parts to play with on the ears, they're just very small areas.
---
The malformed ear types will all set one ear to be smaller than the other.
---
PC.
---
It's funny really, in 500 hours I've had close to a dozen Fixer plans drop, but I've never even SEEN a rad barrel plan, either dropping or in vendors or anywhere.
---
I suppose that even if I did eventually find one in a player vendor, it'd be listed for max caps given its rarity. So I still wouldn't be able to get it.
---
Not everyone wants to do pvp and the only fix, would be for people who are in passive mode, not to be able to take your loot, which I would be okay with. I don't even take things anymore. Don't need it, have all I'll ever need😁
---
Exactly. It sounds good on paper, but it's honestly nothing more than a convenience perk. Which, some people will find appealing, but there are way better options. Not to mention, the loot obtained through those activities is generally not even worth your time.
---
The issue is being able to blueprint the ammo convertor from the munitions factory. The issue is not private teammates being able to build at your camp.
---
I bought that but I’m pretty sure it got patched
---
If you only have one perception, that means that you can only equip rank one of one of the commando cards which is plus 10% damage. Clearly that means that you won't have that much damage
---
It’s been a bug pretty much from the very start. I don’t think Bethesda has even acknowledged it either. It use to happen to me all the time and it’s so frustrating as it can make you lose junk, ammo, time, quest reward etc. They need to fix it.
---
I suspect the visual on the item bring broken is part of whatever they did to fix the duping exploit.  No idea why that would be needed, but I imagine it'll be a while before they fix it, if ever.
---
I'm definitely not an Angel, but I'm also not a cheater. I don't want anything to do with it and he placed one blocking my front door and one interfering with my vending machines
---
&gt; fuck knows what terrible thing they will do next after boston.
---
What terrible thing did they do in Boston?
---
What console and what kind of flux? If xbox, I have a ton of spare flux I can give to you! I don't use any of them except yellow cake, so as long as it isn't yellowcake (I'm fresh out of that) I can give you some!
---
Kudos to all you patient enough to wait for dessert in the wastelands 👍
---
Ahhh, yeah prolly the malformed ears type then.
---
I've never used those cuz i never really wanted my characters to look like a goblin.. lol. 
---
Good to know though, thanks!
---
What’s most of your special stats in? Strength?
---
Lol same here
---
Damage calculation changes will result in you putting more bullets into each enemy, meaning you will be repairing your weapons more frequently. This event covers those costs.
---
I’ll see if I can get one from the market for ya
---
What? Is that a thing. I traveled to a few bases and nobody had one. Again I can totally give all my caps. But it's only 1965
---
I have a question... and I really should know the answer given the length of time I've been playing (since launch, level 155).  Do things attack your camp while you're away or just when you're actually at your camp? If something attacks while you're away, a simple notification would be nice... like 'hey, there's a yao gui attacking your home that you spend literally hours building. Just a thought.
---
They could split up outfits into shoes, pants, shirts, coats, gloves, etc.
---
The problem with this is player inventory causing lag when you hit high numbers of item lines. If each outfit gets split into 5 or 6 parts, you'll be hitting that lag.
---
This would be a lot more healthy for enriching quest/event reward tables, but right now it is a technical hurdle.
---
Look at my recent posts, that’s the only way to get rare stuff usually. There’s a discord too.
---
Fixer plan is worth 5k-8k but I don’t mind giving it to you if I can grab one, it’s really not a problem.
---
Stealth boy my friend! I use them most at sbq
---
I can only report what's there, which is what you asked.
---
I did the dailies every day and turn in Davenport's daily for extra rep along with the one at Ohio River and it took me about 54 days to max both.
---
Really?! Thank you so much. I know he has a discord so I will have to let him know for the next time he decides to farm something
---
Can you add a bit of context? Why are you doing this? What war? With whom? How do you plan on paying? That kind of information would be helpful.
---
They should change this to a buff that makes Vertibirds spawn on your location for 30 minutes and provide support fire along with medical or ammo drops to you and your party. Also if its truly Fallout then make no spawn quantity cap so we can have 20+ Vertibirds getting blown up at SQB event..
---
This is true and I agree.. that and they don't always differentiate who an actual enemy is, I walked up to my camp to hear all my turrets and Becket goin crazy.. found what they kept shooting and it was a traveling merchant 🤦🏻‍♂️ he wasn't taking damage and my own camp destroyed itself
---
modus creepy af, need to unplug that thing honestly.
---
but still, what hart of ORBITAL WEAPONS PLATFORM dont you understand?
---
realistically, one orbital strike from a new enclave operative and the new brotherhood is done. what counter do they have? what strategic assets? fuckall save for some SAM sites, a loser with some robots, a pile of literal junk, and some underpowered laser weapons.

I have an extra same gt as on here and I will be on in the next 30 mins or less just message me and it's all yours. Just pay it forward if you guys ever have the ability to do so is all I ask.
---
A little too late on that suggestion buddy. They're adding a greenhouse building set as a part of the season 2 legendary run. I believe it's going to be level 99 though
---
'Molten lava randomly falls on you'
---
And this is what makes Unyielding so powerful for VATS.
---
Unless you are in pacifist mode, then you can shoot white tag players all you want, still pissing them off, but they can't hurt you. I love that Bethesda made it IMPOSSIBLE for you to hurt AT ALL a player in pacifist mode. Makes it less stressful for non pvpers
---
i like killing
---
Absolutely! I'll be there! Thank you so much! I'm playing the story mode tomorrow with him and it will probably be my last play session for the game since my interest isn't really there but I'm probably gonna sell some stuff. I'll add you
---
m8, make a new character. those level ups you’re wasting respec’ing are going to be missed to level up legendary perks ;)
---
Try having a sentry bot for a neighbor. Sometimes it's 16 sometimes it's 60. Tends to respawn when someone travels to my base. Admittedly that's why I chose that spot but damn sentry put down the gun and come in for a tune up once in awhile.
---
Someone said they have one to give me so you don't have to waste your caps!
---
Yeah, they don't give a fuck. They don't even make their own characters for play testing
---
Thank you kindly ^^
---
it's not about getting one
---
it's about getting luck with an impossible low % RNG
---
Nice! I haven't seen the season 2 rewards yet.
---
If you walk up to the camp module I think it has a repair all option
---
Bloodied: 95% @ 5% HP
---
Furious: 50% (not sure how much per shot)
---
They are currently up on the Bethesda website if you wanted to check out the full list of rewards.
---
There are 6 levels
---
They absolutely CANNOT hurt anyone in pacifist mode. I've tested it many times. It sure pisses them off when you msg them laughing at them that they're wasting their ultracite ammo! 🥱🥱🥱
---
it's not the same feeling getting one thing from the roof that challenge the odds of the rng.
---
I'm across from the watoga station in the bog with that farmhouse looking place, I always get these two super mutants that will pick my turrets off from a distance and then destroy my generators and leave 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Yeah, I'll explain. Because I'm 99% sure those other two times were me too.
---
Basically, it's something I do to entertain myself. I'm sure the idea came to me originally from the "dicks out for Harambe" posts people used to make. I've seen a few variations over the years. 
---
I see a lot of posts on this subreddit about people accomplishing things, and when I posted this the first time I probably laughed for a good hour. So I kept posting it, and now people have started noticing. Some like it, some don't. But I do it to make myself and others laugh. That's the story.
---
Depending on the platform you play on, there's a way of opening your teams menu and respawning at a teammate.
---
Alright. I just made the post before someone corrected me, that PTS players get more SCORE
---
Grandmas everywhere just fired up there stove tops and they don’t even know why.
---
Aldo, another thing to keep in mind... It's still just a video game, so if someone can do something to you and you don't like it, blame the game devs
---
I've always wanted to get pvped and revenge nuke someone and them actually not move 🤣
---
#**Good With Salt 3**
---
I'll be okay, really. I have plenty of raw flux I'm just farming the hardened mass for it right now. My main problem is that contested workshops aren't visible in the map before you fast travel to people who are at them (in my case, I hadn't discovered it and so it looked like my teammates were out for a stroll.)
---
You're very kind, thank you.
---
the only random thing that happened to me was that sentry bot that follows you lmao... i take it to my friend camp and he started fighting the turrets xd... rip Bad Tommy 2020-2020

Here's what you say to griefers.... "When you're done wasting your ammo, let me know, I'll sell you some more"😉 They usually feel defeated and leave.😅😂🤣
---
My camp is constantly over run with those morelurk Kings and hunters lol
---
i think i need this one and another disease to get the achivement
---
If that's where I think it is, it's one of the best build spots in the game
---
We all just want FO5 and/or ES6, in our heart of hearts, lol.
---
We do this in the meantime.
---
Need any hardened mass, then?
---
No idea on the orbitals, ive seen 3 total trap bases on pc, first was a spike/electric base, i nuked that one. Numbers 2 and 3 was a team of responders cosplay trap basses, they got a nuke each at the same time
---
Damn I try it every time I see one and have had no luck
---
Good question, never happened to me when I was playing rifleman, when I switched to commando it started doing it with every automatic rifle I have. My handmades reload with 13 rounds left in them, my quad explosive tesla reloads with 40+ rounds in it etc. Its extremely frustrating, would love to find out why its happening and if there is a way to avoid it.
---
Maybe I've just been extremely lucky, but on PC I honestly can't remember the last time I did a UF where someone was hogging the legendaries. Usually worst case scenario we all stand around for a while because everyone's too afraid to land the killing blow on the off chance someone else didn't get a tag in. Even when everyone at the event is there, it's hard to fight that instinctual fear.
---
My purpose in life is to be helpful!
---
I'm pretty active in this subreddit so if you ever see my name and ya need something, don't hesitate to ask.
---
I used to live in the middle of the lake in the Mire, next to thunder mountain. Didn’t stop Super Mutants from pot-shotting it from a mile away or Fog Crawlers from seemingly washing up on it every now and again.
---
Pretty glad I moved.
---
Happens to me, especially when I'm using the Gatling Laser. My temporary fix is to melee, if you are looking to stop the reload the animation.
---
I think when OP says 'backpack' they mean 'inventory'
---
Yeah that's what's normal, I'm on pc as well. You could see that everyone else at the event was very pissed off, which was a good amount since we we're getting three star legendaries. But since I'm getting downvoted I guess I'm in the wrong here, who knows.
---
Uh...okay lol. Glad to know I‘m not the odd man out by not understanding the joke at first. Thanks for clarifying.
---
I am an unarmed stealth melee but with the upcoming nerf I may switch to heavy guns because of the nerf
---
I meant to give us the leather pants, since she's wearing the jacket.
---
I heard this happens with heavy weapons, I didn’t know it happened with other ones too. I’ve only played  Rifleman so far so haven’t experienced it myself. Hope it gets fixed!

Quality of life builds have become more relevant!
---
You're right. I think it's funny that I've had people over level 50, that when they try to initiate pvp with me and I shoot back, they don't understand why they can't hurt me. Duh, I'm in pacifist mode. I've even had a guy msg me asking How come I can't hurt you? So I played and said... I have the invincibility perk card on.
---
I got one for you
---
Not just game sounds but all sounds, have to exit the game to clear it.
---
The community is so non-toxic. My friend accidentally got wanted after opening something and went around trying to get killed to remove it but no one wanted to kill him.
---
Nothing will change popularity of builds, or what build or prefix is "best" in terms of dps.
---
Also revert it to being a vtu cpa instead of a red baseball cap
---
Same things happens to me with my Gatling laser and plasma. The core with just randomly eject when there’s still at least 50 shots left. Annoying as hell in and of itself, sure, but mostly it just wastes ammo, which is an entirely separate pain in the ass.
---
He got screwed.
---
It stacks along with lone wanderer and action boy. That said anything more than 3 isn't worth it as the 4th and 5th piece suave off less than 1 seconds each.
---
Angry Turtle has at least 1 video testing it if you search through his channel.
---
Yeah The only reason I never minded on the gat laser is because I ran PA as well so partially spent cores would just be consumed later anyways.  But it’s super annoying with my Ultracite cores.
---
It used to be a reproducible bug by fast traveling to Harper's Ferry while in power armor, that was fixed but the bug can still be triggered sometimes.
---
Awesome. Glad you got it.  I’ve been looking for the croc backpack plan on psn for my wife.  Congrats again.
---
currently I prefer regular armor with a mix of legendary effects
---
Idk but bloodied builds have been hella nerfed with full heath being the least affected if that helps
---
That's what I want to know! My LMG has this issue and it's really annoying
---
Dang, didn't have one. I thought I did. I do have a 1* Furious Fixer and a 2* Mutant's Fixer with +10% while aiming if you want them. Hit me up tomorrow. Happy Anniversary to you both...and many, many more!!
---
I've been playing since the public beta, and I started grinding for a Tattered Field Jacket in the Mire just a couple months after release when people datamined the rare event/quest outfits. Just a couple months ago, I finally got it from Idle Explosives. Don't give up; there's no telling how long it might take, but if you ever do get it it'll be one of the most satisfying experiences the game can offer.
---
Yeah but no picture
---
Thank you. I appreciate the help. Someone generously gave me one
---
Honestly, a fair bit of the time you see people going along with a joke, they don't understand it either
---
He just legit cried when I gave him this plan. Love is great. I wish you luck
---
Ah, congrats. It definitely takes a certain type of person to have the proclivity of wanting to obtain everything like that! I always liked being a completionist for achievements and trophies in games as well. Rng is one hell of a drug. I think i was reading the pa mods can be found from treasure maps, no? How about magazine hunting?
---
Someone already gave me one but thank you so much
---
Someone ping Bethesda about this this is genius
---
It’s not about weapon classes per se, it affects how damage bonuses stack. Someone using a full health, non-legendary weapon will (in theory) notice little to no difference. Someone stacking multiple mutations, perks, legendary effects etc—Bloodied—will notice a major change.
---
Just use whatever you're using now, it'll be fine.
---
🤯🍻
---
I agree. I just wall past it now and I use scrap kits all the time if I'm worried
---
No worries!
---
This game was advertised as an open world pvp survival game and it has been watered down by babies like you crying foul because they are so used to being the god of the sandbox in the old single player games. My advice: git gud
---
Won't work if they're in passive. A guy tried doing that to me, they did nothing.
---
Excited, yes but I'm going to take more time this time. I finished what seems like a month ago. I'm sure I'll be able to stroll through this one.
---
&gt; **I always have way too much rubber** 
---
That's not a bad thing. I mean, it is important protect yourself and your partner before things get heated up, right?
---
Not to try and one up you but my first time dropping I used my nuke card, put in the code, pulled up the map to place the drop zone and the server crashed! I couldn’t play for two days I was so broken lol
---
Damn i wonder if anyone ever dropped something at my first camp and i was totally oblivious to it... In retrospect i remember over in flatwoods someone dropping a bunch of ultracite plans that i didnt know were any good, but then when i finally got around to making pa, then i saw what i already had and was like, shit it all makes sense now
---
I am showing a base fire rate on that gun as 91. FFR shouldn't get that anyway near 200. Is my data wrong, can you confirm? An FFR gauss minigun has a fire rate above 200?
---
I feel ya today hasn't been good
---
Congratulations.
---
Nuking or being creative doesn't work. They can always jump servers. No loss to them! All servers are the same anyway.
---
I’ve watched firing my commando very closely and what I’ve noticed is it goes down to 0 then when it hits 0 shoots up to 13. It then reloads and appears that there are still 13 left in the mag. I’ve found that it happens to me most on FFR weapons
---
Me too... But why am I playing this game more than 800 hours?
---
I'm just amused this thread went on for 3 hours full of conversation LOL
---
*Good ... good. Let the hate flow through you.*
---
They can't if you're in pacifist! Even with bait
---
And when the perks drop, survival shortcut will cure diseases as well, along with maxing our hunger and thirst for the same disease resistance as antibiotics (more if you have rejuvenated).
---
Also is a full heal.
---
OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK! OK!
---
Power armour has the potential to be far tankier but less powerful due to perks, although with new legendary perks a perfect set of matching gear will render power armour almost obsolete
---
Bloody Builds got hit the hardest, junkies got hit the second hardest. As for specific weapons from what I've seen unarmed melee got hit the hardest. everything else seems moderately okay just depending on what legendary prefixes you re going for. I can see anti-armor being pretty useful post patch
---
Most of my experience with players in the wild is just passing by while exchanging emotes, sometimes trading after events, and a few times engaging in extremely one sided pvp against lvl 200s. I feel like I’ve been on the bad side of the community, one time a guy got real mad at me because I plasma based him. I was a level 40 with a few 2star legendaries if that against two level 100+ I wasn’t going to win with my poor mans melee build
---
Itt: participation trophy
---
If you need an addition cured now, you have two easy options:
---
A. Play guided meditation. Always rewards 2-3 addictol.
---
B. Head to Carlton mine. There’s a section with radscorpion nests, and consequently, eggs.
---
How about, if they just remove losing anything at all when you die??? Unless you're in Nuclear Winter
---
Advice - if you have the key, go around the back way. It should save you some time. Probably.
---
Other than that - if you equip a marine wetsuit, you can remove the disease risk without removing your armor. Combined with aqua person, you have nothing to fear from water.
---
No, still not fixed, that have happened to me at least 5 times, 4 on encrypted and 1 on SBQ, had to restart the game in all of them. Also sometimes the screen froze and that makes you lose all your junk as well.
---
There are so many bugs that should be fix.
---
You know tbh I don't even know, like I said this is what I was told. Looking at it now it appears you are right as it sits at about 132. This doesn't change that consecutive hits on a body part with this gun deal increasing damage for almost no reason.
---
PS4 here ready to rumble
---
What’s best now will still be best afterward. It just won’t be ten miles above everything else. That said, I think the new most desirable combo will be Bloodied Vampires. Get all the benefits of Unyielding, lots of bonus damage from low health, but increased survivability from the Vampires effect. It’ll do less damage than pure Bloodied, but not by nearly as much as is currently the case.
---
Who doesn’t?
---
their aim in boston as usual is to kill every creature then deem a threat irrespective of any other consideration, and they want to detonate the reactor of the institute without any other understand of anything else they do or have beyond synths (which they also dont fully understand)
---
they are willing to essential nuke Cambridge while simultaneously stealing crops from local farmers. "ends justifying the means" is just en excuse.
---
BoS never plans to give back the tech they horde, they just consolidate power and leave destruction everywhere they go. i dont understand why you would think differently, again and again their "ideals" lead to hording and stealing, isolationism, and eventual genocidal fascism or despotism.
---
Theres some guys squished in the rock on the way down the shaft.
---
Never carry junk if you're not in pacifist mode! Use scrap kits at least.
---
Here’s my view:
---
If she would just have more to say about the main quest line of wastelanders than just Gauley mine, I’d love it.
---
I used to create mothman egg omelettes. They're worth around   15 caps each I think and the eggs are found in point pleasant and in some mothman cult camps. Using Super Duper when crafting them can get you about 400 caps when selling them to a vendor bot.
---
What I do now is craft the marine tactical helmet. Takes about 1 or 2 plastic, rubber, and glass each and sell for a little more than the omelettes. Plans can be found in Drop Site C2, near watoga. If they aren't there, just server hop.
---
Ayo don't forget to log in tomorrow for your dailies.
---
The plans are mislabeled.
---
Standing gorilla plan unlocks sitting gorilla, and vice versa.
---
correct
---
That sounds familiar. I was worried i would run into that bug. Did you ever get it resolved or troubleshooted it?
---
This is why I carry a low powered explosive 10mm pistol. I can tag everything from one spot, even in the holes in the walls. When the legendaries come out, MOST of the time people are kind enough to barely hit them, then wave everyone over for a chance to shoot at them.
---
A lot of people aren't that courteous.
---
commando is the least effected weapon type. all melee got fucked, rifleman now struggles to keep up with auto rifles. pistols are still terrible as usual.
---
Just drop it
---
Me too, I forget I have it because my diseases still expire. I'm thankful because I constantly run out if disease cure and never remember the water fountain
---
I already play like that.  It's relaxing not dying all the time.
---
Power armor is tankier for sure.
---
You will be able to make it into a luck-boosting alcohol soon that also makes you immune to the fear effect, fittingly called liquid courage.
---
Literally how?
---
Lmao I recognize your username, I've been at your camp twice now, the last time I was there you logged off while I was trying to buy some of your stuff lol. And yeah I always call people over for any legendaries I see, never understood what the point of being a dick was.
---
Definitely going to check that out next run! Thanks
---
They are adding the three legendary perks that give standard armour the same "unique resistance" that power armour has, outside of nuke zones and high radiation areas power armour will actually be worse than standard armour
---
They can't be moved nor scrapped, and if you move your camp you'll have phantom space and lose the ammo converters. 
---
I screwed myself putting 2 of them for a score glitch (1 by error) hahaha. At least now you'll have infinite ammo.
---
Very nice! Really good timing/location.
---
I got a few epic ones in the last couple weeks with the renewed interest of all the nuking going on lately! gotta process them all and get them on my web gallery soon :D
---
LOL I remember your name too from visiting yours as well, and I think seeing you in an event or two. Sorry for logging off, I usually try to check before I do so, unless you were sneaking/hiding :/
---
I'm starting to see a lot more people more regularly now that I'm playing a lot more often again.
---
Yea, the first time I saw a bloodied build I was so confused.   How do you not have radaway?!?  I tried to trade him 4 of my 12 precious radaway,  but he wouldn't take them.
---
I mean it’s entitled when you’re working together with other people. It’s like picking out all the m&amp;ms from trail mix
---
They aren't doing those perks, they scrapped them months ago
---
I mean that makes some sense, if you can't have it nobody can i guess lol
---
No it's not.  Not everyone has to do something for the same reason.
---
On the flip side, I joined the event a few minutes after it popped up because I was gearing up for it. The event was already going when I got there. We had about 4 or 5 minutes left and I was half way done collecting the ore from the 4th cave (hoarding it till I collected it all) when the event completed. Not sure but it seemed like I got lesser rewards for not turning in any ore.
---
Hell, I can solo the event to tier 1 but the rewards aren't that great.
---
Names of perks?
---
I keep seeing on Facebook groups people get the god of drops the scout mask, white powder and whitesprings and BOS jumpsuit suits from tea time and mr messenger
---
Well, grats on costing other people the event then I guess
---
If it’s a handmade or fixer. Yep
---
Hello from the intercom room!
---
Costing?  What about all the other people that just didn't even show up in the first place?
---
Your camp stuck out to me cause I think your the guy with the low level vendor right? I thought that was cool and was thinking about doing something like that myself, I'm right next to the wayward and the overseer camp so I get a lot of level 2's and 3's. And your camp dissappeared like 10 secs after I got there so it mighta just finally kicked in or something after I got there.
---
I stand on that almost exclusively during the event to snipe from afar... never thought to open it. (if its the same one I'm thinking of, directly left of the shaft entrance/bottom to the main earle room?)
---
Might as well just skip all the baby steps and just have a Global Auction House.
---
Better to have it and not need it then need it and not have it
---
It was "thin skinned" for light armour and then one for heavy and one for medium, although someone else is claiming they've been scrapped 
---
If they get added, PA becomes mostly obsolete, if not then it's still not the best
---
.50 cal got a 48% it’s still a great weapon for post pts plus it’s a god damn .50 cal 😂
---
I don’t even bother with the purveyor anymore, I’m so tired of walking away with useless, for my character build anyway, weapons and armor I either have to sell or recycle for scrip. I don’t think I’ve ever got anything useful, and I’m level 240. I have a better chance of finding stuff I want from player vending machines and just purchasing legendary affects for the legendary gun plans that I have.
---
I believe that. I've only played a little on three separate days. I mostly did Daily Ops and I'm already at rank 45.
---
I didn't know that was a thing in 76. I quit playing for awhile and must have been during that time.
---
Sixteen tons may be fallouts best song ever
---
Yep that’s the one! Couldn’t believe it when I noticed it was locked...couldn’t resist opening it lol
---
&gt; -several grueling weeks of bothering every player I could find
---
Several weeks?? Might as well have done the other tadpole challenges in that time.
---
Ah yes, let's have even more unintuitive mechanics punishing players for daring to try to do something outside a private server. If there's a pop-up, it will just be another massive annoyance and lag-inducer at events. You're running around spamming E after line in the sand to get all that ammo and steel off the scorched, and suddenly you accidentally loot somebody's bag because you spammed right past the warning. Hell, not like the warning will do much anyway. Workshops give you a pvp warning every single time you take them and look how many people are surprised about it.
---
No, this is just silly and unnecessary. You died in a public space and for some reason were carrying junk on you and not in your stash. If you don't get back there in time to get it back, that's your fault, your loss, end of story. It's not "stealing" from you and nobody is "wronging" you for this. If you go out and die without stashing your junk, it becomes a world object. You have an opportunity to take it back, assuming you can make it back there, but it's also fair game for anybody else. In many cases it will probably take longer to track down the person than it would to farm back whatever was lost. 
---
If you want to pvp for resources, take workshops and contest other people's workshops. This is already a feature in the game intended for exactly what you seem to want. No need to push it into other aspects of the game unnecessarily. What you're suggesting would just be obnoxious. There's already enough exploits and obscure mechanics to allow people getting forced/baited into pvp as is, and pvp is cancerous enough as is without being forced into it
---
I think some people play with hard bargain equipped all he time and don't even think about it. I sometimes even get public teammates that share it with the team.
---
"Everything is going to be so bullet spongey" - If using one extra bullet to kill an enemy is bullet sponge for you.. then yea. Before making these cry'n'whine posts please go test how the changes actually are and feel in PTS.
---
You can pick up your camp module and move it anywhere within the confines of the camp.
---
2 days ago, I spent all evening randomly running around with some player because she liked my camp and gave me presents. I also had bad prejudice about online games after I quit World of Warcraft, but I gave it a shot because I liked Fallout. 
---
This community is great, you're right!
---
Melee and rifleman builds have been greatly affected. Because math, taking a large base number and switching from multiplicative to additive lowers the resulting number far more than when you take lots of small numbers and make the same switch. They will definitely need to adjust he base damage or the multipliers for these builds to make them some what on par with auto builds
---
Farming disease cures or antibiotics is like some of the easiest things you can do.
---
Yeah, I did a low level in one of my vendor machines. I saw Final Render doing it on one of his vids... so I went one step further and farm the low level events and save the good legendary stuff (forest wolf pack events, swarm suitor, etc). If I get decent weapons under lvl 20, Ill fully mod them out and sell for under 100caps depending what it is.
---
It's pretty popular, i get a lot of people buying stuff from it. If I see it actually is a super low level player, I usually run out (if I'm around) and drop stuff for them, ammo for whatever they just bought, some extra aid, etc.   It's a fun experience :)
---
Once you get to where you have almost everything you need, it's really fun to just give stuff away.
---
Yea for me just the scrapbox is worth it and I would probably buy atoms once a month anyway.
---
Just the other day I did a op on the PTS, 2 level 50 super mutants spawned inside my camp at the junk/lead node in the toxic valley and were standing over my dead radtoad's corpse which happened to scale to level 50 as well (which is great, but it didn't fight back, in fact I don't recall it every fighting back since i tamed it) 
---
Next day I do another op, 4 level 50 radscorpions spawned at my camp. Shrugging off missile fire from 4 turrets like they were nothing. They tore through 4 walls, and were eating my collectron and vendors. 
---
They really need to rethink camp defenses with this update, but judging by the changes on the PTS, it wasn't even on their radar and probably won't be for a long time, if ever.
---
I usually put excess components in a vendor for free. It tends to go quick, helps someone who needs it out and I free up stash space.
---
Just a tip the power plant south of the vault, you can restore the power to the plant and generate fusion cores
---
Jesus fucking christ stop whining like a baby, the whole reason they are doing this in the first place is to make it easier to balance new and old content for players of all builds.
---
Bloodied builds are still going to do insane damage and now no matter where you go all loot will be scaled up to you giving you the freedom to do any event anywhere and get something good
---
Is it just me or does shotgun VATS damage feel insanely high for no reason? I'm well into level 50 territory and still find myself relying on a level 5 shotgun with instigating on it to deal with scorchbeasts, deathclaws, etc.
---
That 2shot auto grenade is a beast if you have the perks to carry the ammo and damage/area buff. Little secret, weapons like grenade launchers/missile launchers/fatman, the 2 shot effect olny effects the projetile themselves, not the explosions that spawn, so technically it's true 100% damage.
---
It’s not a nerf, it’s damage normalization and MMO’s that were designed by the best programmers in video gaming have done the same exact thing - some several times. WoW and FFXIV.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
I'll here one beep of a mine once in a while. No mine in sight
---
Probably? All the other seasonal events have returned, with adjustments and updated rewards to boot.
---
Maybe this year Mischief Night won't vandalize the framerate.
---
Why?    
---
76 is an MMO at its core and like any is made to be a huge time sink with very little reward.
---
Well over several weeks meaning I tried a little bit per session, but was there a different way to do it?  Can you get possum points and use the possum vending machine before that quest? Because after doing all the tadpole challenges, i still had the revive left to do. Maybe the quest steps changed because I wasn’t under the impression i could skip that, and you’re not the first person to say that.
---
Why not turn it around? You collect ore and the others collect XP?
---
I don’t know what’s the real cause of this but I always assumed it’s related to the server having issues with registering the amount of shots you fired. I think in reality you did fire all of your rounds but the server didn’t register all of them which is why it still shows you have rounds in your magazine, if this makes any sense
---
Its the definition of a nerf. "Damage rebalance/rework" is a euphemism they use so the players don't become furious. And you didn't answer me either
---
Read the post before you comment
---
Nope, you are not the only one missing 95% in VATS.  Today, 95% to hit Earle, missed twice.  Earle is a huge target to miss.  It is a pain in the ass sometimes, but just have to deal with it.  I also, experience missing VATS shots at close range, to a point were it is just laughable.
---
It absolutely 100% is not. It’s a rebalancing so people like you whining about a nerf also don’t create a post about people one shorting things, which you’ve likely done in the past here as well.
---
Ok man if you insist. Sorry you hate fun.
---
Cause when I do usually the NPCs die :/
---
name on pc?
---
Not really, people still nuke it for flux and glowing ghouls
---
To keep my LMGs fed if I find .308 for 1 cap it is an auto buy for me unless I'm carrying a lot, say 10K+. With the upcoming Legendary ammo crafting perk it will make it much easier to keep LMGs fed.
---
Ok ty. What abt heavies? R they still op?
---
Next time blow his stuff up with explosive bait. Preferably when he is busy doing SBQ or some other event.
---
I haven't seen it getting nuked a whole lot lately, but that doesn't mean its safe, its still a decent place for flux and stabilising materials.
---
Rip
---
How?
---
Am I the only one who thinks she’s really fucking annoying and acts more like some cringey teenager on tiktok than a survivor in the apocalypse?
---
Well, you can never discount any spot from being totally “safe” but when it comes to the Whitesprings, it was nuked for a reason and still can be.
---
It was always for the flux materials farming so with the introduction of A Colossal Problem, that might reduce the number of times you see it happen but it is still likely.
---
Vote with your wallet like I plan on doing. Posting anything on reddit about it is only going to draw out the crowd that's been whining about bloodied builds and they'll call you whiny. Which is ironic since all they've been doing for a long time is whining about bloodied builds like a bunch of babies.
---
If you don’t mind the less occasional (but still happening) nukes and having to rejoin 10 different servers so your camp spot isn’t taken, then yes
---
Funny stuff, you can delete it now.
---
No matter where the event spawns, it has a chance of awarding the masks and jumpsuits.
---
“Vote with your wallet” 😂😂😂😂😂 yeah because 2 people canceling fallout 1st has always gotten Bethesda’s attentions and made them change something
---
Appreciate this, heard that it does, just wanted confirmation.
---
Question - is it spamming the laser?
---
If so, once you’ve died once, snipe it’s from a distance. If it detects you run backwards out of the area. It’s only allowed to roam so far.
---
Well to start with it straight up negates 45% of all incoming damage.  If you slap on emergency protocols it reduces damage in total by 70%.  What does unyielding really give you as a heavy gunner?  Not more carry weight, perception?  Who cares, you don't need endurance cause you're tanky.  Charisma doesn't really matter too much.  Intelligence will help, as will agility, but you're a lot less tanky.  If you're a heavy gunner, get in power armor.
---
There’s not that many people that like this nerf
---
They have been.  They aren't in the pts.
---
I doubt this will ever be an available option, based on the limited engine and the way they use assets. If you've ever used creation kit (or Geck etc) you'll have an idea. They'd have to redesign and remake every piece indivually with its own IDs and settings and mesh/textures separate. This would be an absolute monster of a job and honestly, the team that created fallout 4 would be overwhelmed let alone our handful of guys working on 76. 
---
Ideally though, Elder scrolls 6 and fallout 5 would have a completely ground-up approach and then we'd have a chance of seeing something, but as is for current games they'd basically have to either Frankenstein the pieces of clothing and chop them up into their own pieces, or scratch what they have and start fresh for every single  outfit.
---
You're so cute
---
It’s staying up
---
If I need Nuka Colas for say, crafting nuka grenades, I just run all the bot vendors at the stations and Whitesprings, usually get 40-45 a run.
---
I want her as a CAMP ally... only so I can put a "ring" on it, been wanting to see whats under that vault suit.
---
It happens at some stage to all of us. Ive been caught by a trap base, now Im pretty suspect when I vendor hop. You learn to see the signs of a potential trap base. Overwhelmingly the player base is really good, but you do get the odd nuff nuff that just wants to mess it for others. Just move on, leave their world and block em, not worth trying to engage in their antics. Plenty of other players to engage in a positive way with in fallout.
---
Actually that reminds me..
---
Was in a group with two friends and a rando. Rando was being all loud and saying some things you probably shouldn't in the company of people you dont know.
---
Well we were on discord.
---
First nuke just landed on acp, I was in bravo. The other two were in charlie. We were gonna wait and drop on sbq and Morgan town.
---
The rando went into acp. We discussed. Bravo and Charlie nukes launched minutes apart..onto the guys base. 
---
He didnt notice cause he was clearly busy with acp. And then boom..base gone.
---
The rando got done with acp and realized his base was toasted and started screaming, voice cracking an everything. Best part was that cause his base was a nuke zone..he couldn't travel there. Was worth the keycards.
---
&gt; and the game is fine the way it is now
---
LOL
---
True
---
Ha!  I just got my first one as well.  Felt a much bigger deal  than killing the SBQ for the first time!  :D
---
The damage model is fine
---
Plenty of people cancel, but then they re-sub within a week or two and bethesda knows nothing will happen. They don't even end up missing the monthly payment
---
Soloing Earle or the SBQ does not mean the game isn’t easy, it just means your able to do something that I imagine they never really intended you to be able to do.
---
Plus, the most important thing imo, is this: how long do you want to grind for top tier secret service armor?  Getting top tier power armor takes an hour tops.
---
Spitting fax and I’m not gonna vote with my wallet I’m gonna straight up quit and go back to new Vegas and 4
---
[Shake That Booty!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSWwqqoYCD4)
---
Some sort or stall system? Like a parking lot
---
Earle and the queen are not easy to solo im a short amount of time
---
Nothing changes in the ordering. They reduced the gap between builds so you are no longer punished as hard for not min-maxing. Bloodied is still on top, junkie's is still a good second, half the effects are still completely pointless for any build
---
Guess you missed the part where I crouch, vanish and walk away with my stealth suit.
---
Still can't fight underwater.
---
Gunpowder, and banked resources, if they keep these community donation events long term then holding onto them might be useful
---
I never thought I'd read the phrase "when someone cops your junk" in this context.
---
Personally I haven't had many issues with people trying to take my stuff after I die. I will 100% loot everyone else's bag I find just because, hey, it's loot, and I wouldn't mind if people could actually shoot at me to deter that kind of action.
---
He *does* deserve the downvotes because he’s crying like a little bitch about a situation *he* created.
---
For me, it's glass shards.
---
I always end up with way too much because of all the fuses and coils I scrap for the copper. I just drop the stuff I don't need.
---
You obviously missed the point.
---
I can see from the other replies that you're set in believing you're right and everybody else is wrong, so I'm not going to waste time telling you otherwise. I will, however, reiterate:
---
If you’re selling, can I buy some cobalt flux please?
---
I feel you so much. I’m approaching level 90 and have only ever found one legendary of one of my weapon types, and it isn’t that good. I’ve got two decent armor pieces. Just scrip scrip scrip and hope to one day get something instigating/unyielding and actually suitable to my build. 
---
I guess you could respec to your best legendary but really...who the hell is going to spec for assaultron heads or stilettos? The RNG is pretty demoralizing.
---
The same with legendary perks. I see people complaining how long it will take to level them up. I mean they are LEGENDARY perks that are super good. You ain’t supposed to get them all on release
---
Was wondering...is it setup as one-try at the machine?  Meaning if you try and it fails, it will continue to fail at that location until the server resets, or can you keep trying it with a possibility to have it grab it?
---
The one I was lucky enough to get was on the first try, so I've been curious if it's always that way.  First try or nada.
---
Just shut up and wait until it drops and see how wrong you are.
---
They really need to have a rare chance at a legendary, make it a little worthwhile.
---
This, also maybe some 20% ammo armor
---
Currently sitting on 69K 5.56 and ~3.5k .45 (possibly moving all my .45 soon, my trusty Instigating LAR that's been with me since level ~65 is going to be completely useless after the new update)
---
I was doing the bos event with a random and after the event some guy came up a shot at the guy i was doing the event with. But he was a higher level than me. But i just hit him once realizing how much damage i did i stoped shooting. Then he just killed me even tho i didnt even do that much damage.
---
15 in Strength, 1 Perception, 9 Endurance, 4 Charisma, 7 Intelligence, 15 Agility, and 5 Luck.
---
Blocker, carry wgt, barbarian, etc. No melee perks. It's an awesome universal build that I can be tough in melee, Bloodied, Commando (tank build) without using such perks. Being able to withstand a lot of damage even at half life.
---
Cost?
---
i am just now reading this and that may or may not have been me. i apologise
---
*Farnsworth voice* I asked them too!
---
they will never actually put in the work to "balance" anything beyond the change to damage calculations.
---
bethesda cant even ship a single update or feature without it being broken and neglected.  people keep parroting this whole "its so they can make changes later!" line. its bull, anyone who has played this fucking game knows better than that.
---
That shit has been nerfed to the point of in my opinion being the second worst prefix. Instead of 200% damage from TS, and a 100% damage increase from the explosive effect, it’s now 125% total, if both rounds hit, and 20% added from explosive (up to 40% with demolition expert.)
---
Hard Bargin doesn't work for player vending. What you're seeing is the tax Herr Howard imposed when playier vending came first came out. 10%, I believe.
---
I’m doing 1460 per hit in the live game and in the pts I do 170 that’s ridiculous
---
When have there been enemies in the water at Kerwood? I’ve never seen mirelurks down there.
---
Just server hop and they'll reset.
---
What kind of weapon do you use?
---
I have almost the lowest damage as is but I can last a lot longer (usually) in battle than most without meds.
---
I didn’t even know other players can take your junk when you die thats so fucked
---
Was everyone standing on fences and tents and she wasn't landing? If that were the case perhaps the player got pissed that she wasn't landing and decided instead to "teach" everyone a lesson.
---
Nice a fellow kombatant
---
BSS STR Powerfist
---
egh, you don't have to stay clear, just dont become a problem and do more harm than good. Don't run in front of other players with heavy weapons, cause they're prolly explosive and you just killed them. Dont act like Rambo and think your lvl 40 gun is gonna take down Earle. Do shot the low level spawns. Do keep them away from the hvy hitters so they can do their damage. And finally heal, heal heal. It makes up for your lvl and makes you a valuable asset
---
If you see me on, my gamertag is chickenfingersub and everything in my vendor is 1 cap. I try to keep it stocked with ammo and plans.
---
Ages ago i dropped like 4000 308 on the ground cuz it was worthless to me, this was before vendors
---
You only need to do 3 of the Tadpole challenges for the 'Order of the Tadpole' quest
---
with my Unyielding set and 3 star Hard Bargain they're like 12 caps each.
---
Always nice to see a fellow MK player in the wild!
---
JC gang rise up
---
Did you miss ALL the posts saying that unarmed damage is broken in pts and it's being fixed?
---
Today Raider Punk gave me a quest to kill a glowing wendigo. He was in a tunnel. Underwater. It was obviously a glitch, but one that happens often for me.
---
But when I do Bloodied I can get up to 150 damage which is low for others but does fine for me.
---
Wdym
---
Awesome! (Btw I’m getting them for cola nut rank 2)
---
That unarmed damage is broken and they want to buff it a ton compared to pts.  It's doing way less damage on pts than they want.
---
Huh. I’ve never seen that happen down there.
---
Then yeah, switching severs is your best bet. I... guess you could try luring the guy to a spot near land and then throwing a grenade.
---
I applaud the execution and then the explanation.  Ive always wondered it myself haha,  keep it up bud
---
Well for me, if I craft cores with ammosmith on, I get more shots per the core. If I didn’t have it on, I get 250
---
Thanks for letting me know, guess they finally fixed that too; I remember it still working and people saying stuff.
---
Weird... I guess I'm only just now starting to notice it
---
But if you kill them then you will pick up any loot they had which would mean they can kill you again right? Bc lets be honest Bethesda wouldn’t make the game know the difference in which loot is which
---
I carry 5-10 Cherry Colas and with Cola Nut and Dromedary, one usually fills my thirst.
---
Just press the buy button. It will display the full name in the confirmation dialog.
---
A lot of people seemed surprised at the "turnaround" in the Brotherhood's presentation from 3 to 4, but really it seemed like they were just going back to what they used to be.
---
I think a lot of people currently playing Fallout games (including myself) got into the series when 3 came out and for many of them that shaped their view on what the Brotherhood's supposed to be. Personally, I always liked the Enclave more so I was cool with the Brotherhood not being the "white knight" types anyway.
---
I was kinda weirded out by the settlers at Foundation giving us such an unfriendly, "git off my lawn" type of reception when they came tramping all over \*our\* land and calling it their own, but I'm 100% expecting that from these new Brotherhood and I'd be disappointed if it was any other way.
---
Make a ticket to Bethesda get your points back man
---
No yeah I bought a TSE pipe something and after I bought it it was a GODDAMN PIPE BOLT ACTION PISTOL and I was really hoping that it was a Normal pipe pistol so I could turn it into a dope pipe rifle but nah it’s a sad and terrible gun
---
Just go to like Bethesda support or something I’m assuming?
---
Ye
---
Limits is how they keep us coming to the game daily. They want steady stream of people logging in daily to grind some and know they’ll have to come back tomorrow.
---
If we dont have limits we can reach endgame status sooner and possibly get bored and stop playing. 
---
Stop playing means less fallout first subscriptions, less atom purchases, means less money, means they would need to come out with much more content to bring players back.
---
Is that how you got yours? Because I had a “Kindness: Ally - revive a teammate” left after doing all the 3 tadpole challenges. Did i not have to do that?
---
Tell them your 40k points are missing and you never spent them they’ll check for themselves and give them back
---
Bad press? I've never seen bad press about it.
---
You didnt get any? Yeesh
---
Yea, it is an error in coding... 
---
What happens is that Bethesda did not anticipate that any of their playerbase would actually like themselves and would want to be friends with themselves. So, whenever someone tries to add themselves as friends, it produces a paradox and causes all Bethesda servers for all games and all platforms to crash...
---
Stop loving yourself so much....
---
Not a single lick I tested it for 3 minis and it gave it to me I’m hurt
---
Rest in paradise sidehoe sloth
---
Yeah, but someone else pointed out that your sale price is *always* "taxed" and I just haven't noticed.
---
I tested it before I made this post I bought 3 minis and it gave em to me should that pose a problem?
---
So you have the points?
---
I was pushed to Berserker when I got an explosive minigun with 250 DR while reloading. Essentially a god roll as far as a berserker would be concerned. I fully committed a couple of days later when I got an explosive fixer with faster reload . So now I can be sneaky and also show up with big guns for a boss. Working on breaking a full set of trapper armor now (like the rad resistance of trapper). I assume having a full set of the same armor, albeit broken, will still allow me to take advantage of the legendary perks that provide rad and poison resistance.
---
It spawns separately for each person.
---
he really isnt that wrong though. using all 9 perks in a damage category will only give a very small amount of damage boost now. they arent worth using anymore.
---
It’s probably just a visual glitch then try restarting your console
---
No after I got boned I made some more just to see if I made a mistake or not. Sure enough have me 3
---
Hey, I've seen them do that in Fallout 4, too! Well, with a few extra mods, that is...
---
I’d be fine with this, although usually when I take people’s bags I already killed them in the first place. Most players would have no chance of getting it back anyways.
---
Nice shot!  Not a single nuke was fired on the worlds I was on today and they were packed with high levels.  Couldn't believe it.
---
Wouldn’t it be in my inventory still? Or do you mean the points turning into dust
---
I agree, I'm getting more treasury notes than I can exchange. I'm closing in on 200 notes, I never hit 0. And with Prime Cuts happening again, I'm going to see 300 by the end of the month.
---
It's like the developers don't even play the game to see what works or what doesn't and just keep adding things having no central balance. 
---
They need to change the system. Cap how many notes you can receive in a day to let's say 30, but make the exchange limit to infinite.
---
That way if I forget to exchange my notes for the day, I can still get the gold bullion I worked for on a different day when I remember.
---
And for people complaining about others not understanding the limit, you have no understanding on measuring time, effort, economics, balance, or rewards.
---
The limit makes people log in more, but spend less time in game. Actually, to most, limiting the exchange number can even hurt performance of end game content. With current bullion limits, there's no way I'm getting everything before the next expansion drops.  So by the end of this season and the start of a new one, it only puts me way behind getting a full  set of armor and equipment before more come in.
---
Because I'm getting little bullion per day, my motivation to keep playing burns out quicker. Now I just do my dailies and I'm gone because the time to max out Legendary Scrip and Bullion is pretty small. My storage is full of legendary weapons I can't get rid off fast enough so even the stash limit stops me from playing that day.
---
Hoping the next few months we get a limit upgrade.
---
Legendary  Scrip exchange: 250
---
Treasury Note for Bullion: 300
---
Stash limit: 1000
---
Bruh, do you have any idea how fucked the concept of a synth actually is? The player gets cute examples like curie and see's the nice side of them, but the player never has a family member killed and replaced by a robot. If you found out that not only was that happening, but that people being replaced by robots was both common and almost undetectable, wouldn't the best thing you could do to help be stop the robots from being created? 
---
And for the record, theres one guy in the Bos in fo4 that tells you to steal supplies, and if i remember right that was an "off the books" deal between the player and him.
---
It sounds to me like you're just applying your ideals for real life to factions in the game, when the circumstances are too different for that to work.
---
Did a restart and I’m not seeing the points back but I still have the 3 I bought after I lost my 40k
---
I am a girl irl so I just stay quiet or in my party chat lol
---
I’m sure that again, everyone will still be awesome, but coming from Gta, I’m shy to talk. Lol
---
I didn’t even think about cherries, I was doing it for the AP (stealth commando)
---
Interesting. I'll have to try some of the ones that'd be doable on a low level character.
---
You get used to it after a while. The tax is just small enough to be annoying without being a major setback.
---
Yeah. I think they want people to test the challenges themselves, and the rewards more so than the progression as a whole
---
Yeah I’ve jumped in a few since writing this and have been doing basically what you said.  My friend basically dragged me in to some kicking and screaming but I’ve had fun and felt like I wasn’t a total hindrance to everyone.
---
It’s safer than before, but still gets nuked every now and then
---
And yet I did it solo with a power fist, huh
---
They want to be the only ones to have tech, and no one else can have it. BOS are scum.
---
Well I can only speak for myself, but I think it’s a great event but I haven’t lost it yet, done it 9 times. A couple times with just me and one other person. So I like seeing the low levels there, gives them a chance to get something from Earle and screws, and hopefully they Agro or kill the wendigos on me.
---
I don't even see the reason why it's there. It's like it's a stop measure for some unanticipated exploit that will never surface.
---
The trick with Assaultrons is taking our the legs and then crippling the head to stop the OP head laser.
---
No spinny 3D model preview, and you can't see the full name if it's long.
---
Of course, I'll be on tomorrow around 3/3:30 EST if that works for you
---
Nah, becket can live rent free, he is the eye candy himbo
---
Lucky spawns?
---
Starts at 5% up to 50% with 10 shots. You can miss shots (i think like 6, maybe depends on gun and fire rate) and still have a few seconds to hit the target again without it resetting but it will rest immediately when you shoot another entity so V.A.T.S is recommended. Also would recommend increased fire rate as second effect so explosive splash damage doesn’t interfere
---
I might as well be an insomniac American because of my sleep patterns lmfao
---
I’ll be awake by then I should imagine.
---
That kind of sums up the whole vibe of 76 anyways. Appalachia isn't a wasteland, it's just deserted
---
Yeah without that they'd have to actually make good content to keep us playing....
---
Country roooooooooaddds
---
my turrets took down a scorchbeast down at lake reynolds where i had my camp for awhile :P cant remember lvl of it but still XD
---
My shotgun has extra limb damage, plus Shotgunner and Enforcer perk. Makes the fight a bit easier
---
Capture them on your Xbox as well, then you can login on your PC or phone to save them
---
Haha... nice. That's a better title!
---
If you're on ps4, I could clear a silo for you and let you do the honors.
---
If not, I would recommend doing archer, athlete, and hunter for the tadpole quest. For hunter, you don't need to only use \[insert weapon\] to kill each target, you just need to finish them off with said weapon. The bleedout syringer mod also works as "kill with syringer".
---
Swimmer is an easy one but you'd need to revive someone in the water.
---
I submitted a ticket let’s see how this goes, hopefully they don’t brush me off with oh here’s 100 atoms sorry for our machine eating thousands of rounds just for it to break
---
No I had multiple legendary bots spawn
---
It's 12% less damage.  60 instead of 72, not that much.  17% less.
---
This person is probably sneaking. You just need a teammate. It’s tough but it’s doable.
---
The harder you grind the higher those numbers get for the player.
---
I personally feel 1000 daily would be great. I wouldnt have the need to have 2 mules with 800 lb stashbox and 1400lbs body weight full of future scrip.
---
Please I hope it does! I didn't get to experience it last year!
---
Oh that's what you meant. I thought you were talking about the Tadpole Badge requirement where you needed to revive someone in water.
---
I had to do the 'Kindness: revive a teammate' too but i achieved that quickly in some public events.
---
it's supposed to be overwhelming the first time, and at level 88 despite having legendary gear, i'd doubt that you have great rolls on all those weapons.  it's still a bit tedious for high levels and an ammo drain, that's why most people for the longest time now have used glitches to skip the bulk of it. people speed run launches in like 5 minutes now. but yeah, if you find something too difficult that just means you have to create a team and get some help.
---
I honestly think the daily limit should be the maximum limit. If someone wants to play so long in a single day, I say let 'em get the stuff too.
---
I am so very sorry for the loss of your beloved Sidehoe Sloth. May they rest peacefully. But...I have to say, your writing is divine and that was a delightful read!
---
&gt;You got to work for it. 
---
You got to WAIT for it.
---
I use to do this. I hate when queen fights don’t go smoothly but then I became the bigger man. I have an amazing cryolater and bc it’s a heavy with the damage output it freezes AP bars and I can jet pack infinitely and wack her butt in air 😂😂
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
I use the term loosely regarding the negative comments posted on Reddit. Not actual “press” reviews, sorry for the confusion.
---
Yeah, I've heard people complained early on about their turrets shooting stuff far away and drawing them to their camp, so they reduced the range at least by half, and now we have the opposite problem, with no happy middle ground.
---
Frankly they should just be honest about it and hand us our 200 bullion dole money each day for allowing them to foist the atom shop news upon us.  Because we all know the only reason any daily limits of any kind exist is to shove that down our throat in the hopes we will spend money on skins that may or may not even work.
---
The close up pic of the face made me jerk back from the screen! Well done!
---
Oh I wonder if that’s why the first time I ever did the event I couldn’t find a single piece of him too loot.  I was getting quite frustrated and then because I spent so long looking for him I died while trying to escape.  Though I hear it’s best just to stay and loot all the wendigos anyways.
---
It's really easy to get over twenty notes a day. Especially now that "A Colossal Problem" awards 8 per completion. I'm already over 400, and with regular play it's not getting lower.
---
I heard about it happening and I seen videos of it happening but never happened to me, luckily
---
Honestly, I think you have been doing some of the more difficult challenges. For me, I found the easiest challenges to be Athlete, Archer, and Mammologist. This guide really helped me out alot:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gwpp65/a\_comprehensive\_guide\_to\_the\_pioneer\_scouts\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/gwpp65/a_comprehensive_guide_to_the_pioneer_scouts_with/)
---
Perfect!  Just logged in and can see them.  Thanks!
---
Ok thats worse.  It's one thing to do at a workshop but then to go destroy your camp is just insane.  Not sure what kind of satisfaction they get from that sort of behavior.  It's hard for me to friend others since I never use a mic...so I either play alone or with my husband who is right beside me.  Chatting does make grouping a lot easier I have found.
---
Anything except the bad noodling. The acoustic and the bass are the least awful though.
---
i wasn't trying to be snide. even rando players from creating a public team could greatly reduce your work and ammo cost.
---
I will never not upvote this suggestion.  It's sensible and doesn't disadvantage Bethesda's monetisation so it has a chance of being noticed if enough people get behind it.
---
Yeah, I thought there would be something where you learned more songs or at least got better the more you play but nope lmao
---
I already hate myself, because I guess I’ll try to self loathe even harder and play again tomorrow. Thanks for the advice!
---
lol if you buff the enemies so that it's challenging for bloodied builds, other builds are just gonna quit the game cause bloodied does like 10 times the damage when compared with other builds. You have absolutely no idea cause the game's too easy and every single build out there can 1 hit kill most enemies but when you have to hit something with large health pool, you gonna feel how godly bloodied builds are
---
It's another cap sink is all. Caps seem to start getting easier to come by, once you get into your late 20/early 30s. By the time you're above 50, you should have a pretty decent way of getting those caps.
---
Once you've bought everything you need, you start buying the shit you want and the caps continue to pile up. Soon you've learned almost all the plans and recipes and have your gear where you want it to be (or close enough). And the caps keep coming in.
---
Fast travel, vending tax, high sell/low buy from the NPC vendors. This keeps you spending caps as you keep getting caps. 
---
Which has made them worthless for the really good gear. 
---
Player-on-player trading has become the only way to get the god rolls, metas and "rare" items.
---
Sigh
---
I gave up my hopes long ago...
---
its actually pretty clear that 99% of reddit has no fuckin clue what these changes actually do and just parrot shit other people said first.
---
reddit wants to circlejerk the "rebalance" without actual having tested it themselves.
---
i did though, for about 40 hours. its shit, it encourages more min maxing, more use of legacies and hacked weapons, does nothing to add high health synergy, does nothing to actually prevent a boss from insta dying, does nothing to address magic weapons, does nothing to address broken energy damage. instead it makes bad builds worse, bad weapons worse, makes buffs less useful, makes perks matter less, encourages more use of BiS over mid tier gear, and exacerbates old balance issues between weapon types, making rifleman builds far less appealing to commando. on and on. the ONLY issue this solves, is runaway bloodied damage, thats it.
---
its a shit show, and its the most cumbersome, tedious way to do balance if they actual intend to do so. they have to adjust perks, buffs, weapon base damage, and more when they could have just put a hard cap on bosses, and tinkered with adding some new perks and make some buffs to shit gear to make them more useful.
---
Tri barrel, gunner site and either prime capacitor or tesla coil capacitor.
---
Add an increase to Camp budget to that. The budget numbers are completely arbitrary values: of the 10K budget limit, it costs 40 to place a simple hanging lightbulb and the same 40 to place a much more geometrically complex chandelier made of antlers.
---
Yes. I have done two. First one was normal. Second he was in the floor or just his feet were hanging out of the ceiling... yet he could still stomp you. Beat him with 1 min and 20 seconds left.
---
I used to have three until I patched together a full uny scout suit (legendary perk bonuses) with the idea of slowly replacing it with a Thorn set.
---
Now I just have one AP refresh and there really isn’t a massive difference.  If you can get all five, that’s swell.  If not, it’s not going to gimp you out.  Like poison resist, I think it’s mostly overkill after you stack two.
---
Thank you.
---
Not penta?
---
The reward is the journey itself or something.
---
In PvP, ass/sent Bloodied commando &gt; PA heavy gunner.
---
In PvE, a PA build is *far* tankier than a non PA build, but for raw damage a Bloodied Unyielding melee build is the most “powerful” and always will be.
---
Here’s why: an ass/sent piece has a 56% chance to stop 23% of damage. So you have a roughly 50/50 chance to negate all damage with just armor alone in PvP and add serendipity and dodgy into the mix, plus quantum spamming, you are practically immortal in PvP.
---
But. In PvE, your PA is superior because it has a flat 42% damage reduction (7% per part) and with Emergency Protocols you’re stopping 50% of the damage not stopped by the PA by itself.
---
However. You lose out on your Unyielding bonuses with power armor, so if you want the +15 to each stat you must run Unyielding armor. Unyielding offers absolutely nothing in the way of protection, only to boost your SPECIAL. So a PA heavy guns build *done correctly* will outperform any other build in PvE, and it will also be extremely powerful in PvP.
---
It lowers your damage and results in lower dps.
---
Yup.
---
I see, thanks for the tip🤟🏻
---
wait wat
---
Yeah tbh most of that time was spent doing events and either noone died or instakilled. The player who helped me had one of those camps where its just stairs and a platform 100ft up, so i got them to jump off and dbno w/ fall damage:)
---
I appreciate your condolences, keep SHS in your thoughts and prayers
---
What level are you?
---
😘 tell ya friends
---
Yup
---
Tadpole/possum can be done in a couple of days if you plan it properly, and are prepared.
---
The last 5 silo runs I’ve had to kill less that 10 bots. Once again planning and sneak makes it incredibly easy.
---
If you have 3 hacker perks , 3 picklock perks, you can take a shortcut, if you have egg head it’s even easier.
---
I have a ghoul slayer +50% limb damage one that serves me well.  Hate tussling with ghouls and with this i get to sneak around and cripple and kill them at my leisure.
---
I'm personally hoping for a proper robinhood style outfit one of these days.
---
They could add a quiver plan that increases arrow reloading time or something.
---
Get the raider one and fix it if you have the atoms ;)
---
Chinese stealth armor and fixer 20 mins and done
---
I was also talking about reddit. I haven't seen anyone complaining, except for the part low level players can join and ruin the events and tesla weapon causing some lags.
---
I mean you play Fallout 76, you should know by now to not rely on what you read on reddit and press and just try yourself.
---
Probably magic. Test it on a Mirelurk queen or a sheepsquatch.
---
How did you even get a sloth? I just started playing a few weeks ago im already at level 50 but i dont have anything else to do now that i got the gold and found all the holotapes
---
This is why you use "Switch to Component View" on your junk tab so you can tag lead.
---
Yep, same here. Sneak attack power fist 1-hits everything in the silo.
---
Lmao
---
You’re the GOAT for this. Thank you a million
---
Are the government suppy requisition holos worth doing? I have a few laying around in my holotape section of my stash.
---
over 150
---
I did it with hatchlings from eggs and it worked thankfully. Still need to work on getting Sludge Lung.
---
Lmao r34
---
Did you not see the "move a special point" option when leveling up?
---
I believe magic damage tends to occur when specific legendary mods are paired with getting a large number of hits in a short timeframe. I don't know the specifics of whether it's just coding, latency, or what exactly is going on but as far as I know, only high RoF weapons(typically +200 rpm) and shotguns can deal magic damage. And yes, limb damage is one of those legendary mods.
---
If it has over 200 fire rate with that perk in it, it will be magic
---
Just watch angryturtles video
---
I'm sure it will although I'd enjoy something different. I love these events but be nice if they changed it up.
---
you can barely call that respec
---
Then you want Cherries, Nuka Cola is 10AP while Cherries is 25AP.
---
As others are suggesting, there are easier tadpole challenges than what you attempted. Athlete, Archery, Hunter and Swimmer are among them.
---
Lots of people sell stimpack diffusers in their vendors too.
---
Wow. I've started grinding, I guess, in the end of April. I'm still grinding the last part for both factions.
---
No I didn't interpret you that way. I was genuine. Ill try to get a few people to follow me there tomorrow!
---
Question. You know how you can hover someone's camp to see what they sell? Would those be under stimpacks or meds?
---
It definitely is.  Maximum number of levels you'd need would be like 25, realistically less than that.
---
It sounds good if you don't think it trough. Taxation was in place years before the message of their arrival, so they couldn't do it. Also they didn't ask for any weird amount of resource in their broadcast, that's on the guy.
---
Plus the drinks.
---
expectation: Cool I can wear the Overseer's leather jacket now!
---
reality: you now cant wear pants
---
Should be under stimpacks iirc.
---
im not "applying my real world ideals" or opining on what i think of synths, besides, the synths in it of themselves and the actions and ethics of the institute are somewhat separate issues. the issue with synths is complicated and just barreling in, shooting everything, and setting off a nuke in the middle of a city that people live in, is short sighted to say the least.
---
and Teagan provides a vague response that suggests it isn't sanctioned, but it is in line with the brotherhoods attitude towards local populations. if you listen to the broadcast the BoS is sending to Appalachia, they are DEMANDING we donate materials and establish atlas for them before they arrive. they rolled though the pit, looted it, killed people then bounced, leaving a comrade behind. its just what the brotherhood does.
---
skin like a day old baklava and hair as white and wispy as a spider's lair.
---
There are several missions for raider rep. Be sure to look them up.
---
Welcome to the solo Earle club lol
---
Maybe he thought you guys were gonna have it killed in the 2 minutes it takes to land. We use this tactic regularly to chain run queens.
---
Looks at frown in mirror... Grumpy... check. Old... check. Gets annoyed at unlocking an icon auto equipping it... check. 👍
---
for which weapon and which type? because the change in perk buffs does not apply evenly like that.
---
10mm auto pistol will get 17 damage for 9 perk points. its fuckall.
---
Great explanation ty man. Imo unyielding is only good for melee builds (extra dps and damage boost) and rifle builds (better perception = better hit chance). But yea
---
Fr? How will they fix it/when?
---
Nah your good. Just like all enemies you have to register a hit then you get a loot drop.
---
Mission failed! We'll get them next time!
---
For all weapons.  10 mm don't do much damage anyway.  You have to look at the percentages, not just the numbers.
---
what im thinking of is a *full* respec system every stat down to 1 not 1 stat every level
---
I have no idea, but that's what they said.
---
Reliably found southeast of Big B's Rest Stop, around a pond.  
---
Can be found at Bleeding Kate's Grindhouse.  
---
Can be found at the treetops.  
---
Can be found at the Beckwith farm.  
---
Can be found at Old Mold Quarry.  
---
They also sometimes spawn at the Project Beanstalk event at Silva homestead
---
If it gets implemented than people who already changed their builds get shafted.
---
I'm not sure what's up with the nukes. For the last three weeks I tried launching one. I launch one no prob, but then all the silos end up locked down for me for about three days before I can launch another one.
---
I heard there's like a 3 hour cool down per silo, so I have no idea wtf is going on for me where I can only launch one every few days.
---
Because you are running only one commando card, you'll be affected less than most.  I'd guess you'll lose 10-15% in gameplay situations because the overall boost of your other commando perks like bloody mess/covert operative will be nerfed a bit.  Base damage will hardly be affected.
---
what he's saying is they need to change that system it still works but you can repsec in different ways like a new kind of perk point that allows you to move specials
---
You can move special points.
---
This is true for damage per shot, you will see a bigger change in the numbers you see in the pipboy and floating for high damage per shot weapons, but all weapons will be effected roughly the same in terms of damage per second, which is what ultimately determines how quickly you kill things.
---
This.
---
true but still it would be better then the one level at a time thing bethesda has implemented
---
RIP Sidehoe Sloth
---
I think a frank discussion with Grahm about responsibility needs to be had. Good news, he's allegedly having another Meat Week soon. A good place to air grievances.
---
Just wait 25 levels or however many you need and do it all at once, it's really not that hard.
---
T h e   
---

---
The event is instanced for up to 8 players. So if 8 people join the event before you do, you'll be placed into a new instance of it instead. This can make the event appear "empty" even if multiple people did join it.
---
They need them to pay the SBQ and Earle's salary
---
There's still plenty left to do! As you increase your Rep with the Raiders and Settlers, you unlock the ability to buy faction-exclusive plans from them using your hard-won Gold Bullion.
---
Your daily quests and public events net you treasury notes, which you can exchange for GB at Crater and Foundation.
---
It's a grind, but the rewards are fantastic. I'm a big fan of the farmable dirt tiles and the ammo machine, myself.
---
An auto-loot option would also be great.
---
I dont have th post with me right now, but someone already went through and di the math on why its so fucked up how long they take
---
I don't know other people's reasoning behind it. But, as for me - I drained all my ammo doing ACP 10+ times and so now I need to do a bunch of lead and steel farming. However, I just cannot motivate myself to do all that ammo farming. So, when I see the event spawn, I just kind of skip it. I have all the plans so I really don't see the point. 
---
However, I do go to SBQ events - mainly because she is hot. But also because she does not drain my ammo supply just to get a bit of scrip.
---
That fires sheep squatch shards.
---
well here's the thing, i don't grind xp im a pretty casual player so to get 25 extra levels would take me about a month
---
Same! I'm in the divide,and have come home to find things destroyed by Scorched still dodging from tree to tree taking pot shots at what's left,while my turrets swing uselessly,and my Settler is sitting in his chair talking about licorice tasting better after the nukes.
---
And don’t forget the extra agility which improves sneak, the extra charisma for vendor prices, extra luck for faster VATS crit recharge!
---
Eventually you won't have anything else to do with perk points.  Just deal with it.
---
why?
---
True lol. And bonus intelligence for xp
---
WELL NO SHIT SHERLOCK
---
Where can i find patch notes that explain whats a yually guna happen?
---
It makes me feel like Bethesda are releasing a much needed damage adjustment but are half assing it like we’ve come to expect. Damage adjustment good, no weapon balancing yet is appalling. Anyway, great run.
---
The event is excellent for farming xp and certain junk.
---
Idk
---
Dude you’re right, it is so awesome. I really do think it’s because of the narrative Bethesda built, we are all apart of Vault 76, and we’re all out here just trying to survive, foundation and raiders a like. Keep your head up dweller, and best of luck out there.
---
I knew there was something missing from there... I need to take another rad bath! My Unyielding has stopped working since some dick shared rad sponge without me realising until it was too late.
---
Honestly, I have always liked the song 'In the sun' by Joseph Arthur. I would not mind playing that song on the acoustic guitar in game.
---
The commenter said it made him hurt for ammo, that's why I said not to do it.  Not that it isn't worth it.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d5tamj/the_comprehensive_creatureanimal_taming_guide/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf this would be it chief
---
we know that but that is not a respec a respec is a full wipe of all points and then you can redistribute
---
That glotch only happe s to me at events that pit alota strain on the server like Scortched earth
---
No luck yet, sadly.
---
Like I said, I think it stopped working when they turned the Mayor off a few updates back, but I don't know for certain. :(
---
My thoughts exactly. I was already a little salty at him for being stingy. Really withholding those tenderizer plans after I’ve helped you prepare over 40 meals? I might have to turn meat week into a meat mine week 😈
---
And I was replying to you, who said there was no reason to do it... junk and xp are easily farmed here and more than enough reason to do this event. Earl is the bullet sponge and you don’t have to shoot him.
---
Excellent! It would be handy if they wrote that on the perk description directly.
---
So, he went through a silo and launch prep faster than you guys needed to kill the SBQ?
---
There’s your answer then: he got tired of waiting
---
Ah thanks, that explains it!
---
Honestly I think a good idea would be to allow what kind of bowstring we can use on our bows. I was thinking that ghoul tendon string could allow us to grab, nock and pull the string very quickly but have reduced range due to as not much kinetic energy being delivered from the stretchy ghoul tendons. Then, have a string called deathclaw tendon string that is slower to pull back but have greatly increased range, speed and less drop off when released.
---
Try looking for a camp with a vendor near to foundation. Fast travel to it and complete the journey on foot.
---
Right, I didn’t mean to imply rifleman and melee will somehow be lower on the tier list than they are now. Damage wise they’ll still be above some builds and below others. But the fundamental aspects of those builds changes. If a commando goes from needing 3 shots to kill to 4-5 shots to kill it isn’t that big of a deal. Your time to kill is slightly changed but not much. A build based on one shotting things essential gets their time to kill doubled. 
---
This is of course fairly irrelevant in a game where pvp isn’t that crucial of an aspect for most people and your able to stay alive pretty easily. But in terms of time spent and QoL (you’ll essentially go through twice as much ammo as you do now to achieve the same result) it’s a big change to any build that relies on big slow hits
---
Ugh, I've seen him glitch through the ceiling as well.
---
I'm not saying don't do it in general, to everyone.  I'm saying don't do it to that person because of their problem.
---
I disagree. Let significant NPCs be unique.
---
In loving memory of Sidehoe Sloth....
---
With enough points it is a full wipe/redistribution.
---
You were the 9th person to join, so you got into an instance all by yourself.
---
Angry Turtle has a great video going through each mod with demos.
---
Alright, let’s see how I can help...
---
First things first, aim for the legs on assaultrons. It’ll cripple them and make them sitting ducks for dps. In addition, robotics expert can help significantly by pacifying them for a time for you to deal with everything else. Better yet, if you can cripple the combat inhibitor in its back, it’ll clear the other robots out for you.
---
Two - don’t do medic for tadpole. Do hunter, swimmer and athlete. These challenges are much simpler, the worst thing you have to do being revive a player in water, which is simple enough to co-ordinate over voice. Also, if you don’t have a camera, head into your personal terminal to activate the quest.
---
Third - check your missile silo state holotape before going into a nuke silo. Trust me on this one. You don’t want to do all that work for nothing!
---
That guy rocks.
---
well guess what! some people have something called a social life and are unable to get 25 levels in a few hours so shut up. we get that with enough levels you can "respec" and we don't. give. a. shit.
---
Unfortunately all three star weapons doesn’t guarantee good firepower. Make sure the weapons and your perks work well together, add Emergency Protocols to the Ultracite PA, and hit the Assaultrons as fast as you can and they won’t have the chance to zap you.
---
If you need a hand dropping a nuke on either PS4 or XB1 let me know. I'd be glad to help out when I get home. At work for at least another 5 hours, but always looking to help out when and where I can 👍
---
I have been using the text mod on PC which has zero filtering capabilities or reporting functions. It has been great, I have not yet experienced any toxicity. 
---
To be honest though, I think it has to do with the community in FO76 being so awesome as opposed to the feature itself. But still, I really wish the text feature was in the base game.
---
Dont you just love when you're getting bitch slapped by the whitesprings ghouls and its lagging because every car is blowing up during the event
---
Hot
---
How many times are you going to respec?  Make up your mind and keep it.  Eventually you'll have a build you're happy with and you'll be fine.
---
I see absolutely no reason for a full special respec option, especially since legendary perks will be hoovering up all our excess cards
---
Congrats I just got a one star spear (ghoul slayer) from earle. You did really well.
---
Give it time Bethesda already said that it's a first step, not a final one.
---
wow. you really do not understand what my post is saying, who knew people could be this ignorant
---
You don't want to put the effort in.  That's okay.  Don't expect anything when you don't put the effort in to get it.
---
i forgot about those but, for the few people (myself included) that want to get a new build, a full respec ability would be very usefull
---
Fyi with the next update they're removing building teams but Casual will give an INT boost instead of a Luck one
---
Noob
---
You can easily respec a full build at level 100
---
who the fuck said anything about effort? nobody with an iq above the number of fingers on a hand will waste many many hours of their life just to be able to move their special points around in a video game?
---
There's a great little nook, raised up a little, behind a white cube water tank, I managed to get all 8 players in one run up in this psudo safe spot (Earle can still spit at you, and the mobs can rush you, but the ash cinders don't fall in this area in my experience) and form up into the most badass squad ever. 
---
There was 6 power armor, 2 bloodied riflemen, and of the power armor, two stomp in with super sledges ready to rock. 4 heavy gunners form up into the most brutal bullet hose I've ever seen, while the melee builds and riflemen stand guard on the two ramps wiping out swatches of Wendigo spawns before they can dream of reaching the non stop bullet buffet that Earle ate. No magic deleting of the health bar, just solid teamwork and we wiped him with 18 minutes left on the time. It felt like the original release trailer, with vault dwellers of every walk, brotherhood converts and dwellers turned Raider all agreeing that thing needs to die!
---
everybody that plays this game knows that but we want a different system that isn't 48 hours of grinding on levels to repsec
---
Than don't play, because that's how it is.
---
thing is, im over 150 so... and i dont play the game that often
---
I bought a bloodied assault rifle yesterday and thought it was a handmade and instead I got the wonky looking Fallout version of an assault rifle from the future..
---
Meta will roughly be the same. Just scaled down some
---
And you don't have a bunch of level ups banked?
---
Is your framerate unlocked by any chance and going past 60 to around 144?
---
Exploits lol
---
WOW!!! ladies and gentlemen, I found something thats one of its kind, a Fallout 76 Gate keeper!! step right up, step right up, only 5 cents to take a nice look at the very first Fallout 76 gatekeeper
---
Fun fact: my friend had just downloaded the game and we came by one of these machines and I wanted to tell him about it, but then it actually gave me the cake.
---
It chews thru ammo faster than ur mom chews on this DICC
---
I don’t bother, but it’s up to you.
---
nope, because im a fucking idiot and didnt get perks when they were first available to me
---
I sold one a while back for 2222 caps, and had personally nicknamed it the terrible twos
---
I'm on PS4 and have yet to be able to launch a nuke myself. Helped plenty others but they always end up running up and launching the nuke. 😩 I'm level 125.
---
Rubber is used in crafting quite a few stuff.
---
Honestly one of the best ways to just enjoy the game is to stop fast traveling and walk everywhere.
---
The underground lair should have been instanced so you can actually re-establish operations.
---
They are just a-holes, every time I bring it up I get downvoted and the day it’s my problem and not theirs and that they like the weapon and I should not care
---
Poor Earle
---
I got the "god drop" of the jumpsuits and masks from Uranium Fever. I think Savage Divide events are a possible drop for them
---
We’d start our with dope burners and hardcore productions, then the art school kids will just come through for a six month career and do shitty stencils and wheatpastes on everything.
---
It highlights the need for a reduction in the damage ceiling.  If your endgame group content can be soloed in 14 seconds, you've got a problem. The problem isn't any specific build; it is the amount of damage buff stacking that is possible. Chems, food buffs, these things alone csn make nearly any build do crazy damage. 
---
If this were a single player game, I wouldn't see as much of an issue. However, this isn't a single player game. These supposed end game fights are meant to be challenging and balance needs to be maintained and monitored for future content, so it doesn't get immediately steamrolled. 
---
Of course, this is the fault of Bethesda, who didn't put enough effort into balancing end game beforehand. The current changes on PTS are also quite poorly handled.
---
Nobody likes their power fantasy being taken away from them;  it is frustrating and kills your motivation to play the game. So, even if adjustmentsbl are needed to maintain some semblance of challenge in this game, it is still going to be incredibly discouraging to a lot of players. There are definitely better ways to go about it; make the "damage celing" easier to reach whilst also lowering it, make endgame content more challenging on a technical level, buff other weapons and builds so that they can also compete.
---
Changing the damage formula without making ANY weapon and perk changes is a very poor start.
---
Straight up nerfing everyone is not the answer, as it hurts casual players the most, and casual players are the lifeblood of any game.
---
Yes.
---
I've been running Excavator with Medic Pump for over 2000 hours and it is quite noticeable when the suit uses diluted stims vs regular stims. This can be deadly in tough situations. I have to ditch diluted stims before Earle for example to avoid the death-related bugs.
---
Those tiddies look straight at the floor
---
I keep max. 50 of scrap in the stash, for lower use scrap around 25, and that only to avoid autoscrapping of unique junk. The reason I have no space in my stash is piles upon piles of bullshit game mechanics.
---
I use cursed weaps for my daily script runs
---
You can play if you want to, but I doubt they're going to change it.  If you can't deal with the current system, you might just want to stop or not worry about respecing.  I think it's perfect the way it is.
---
It's a lot of work. They might be spread too thin to pull it off right
---
Electric Feel by MGMT
---
I just love the vernacular on this post man, let me know if you need anything stranger !
---
If you still need it, I wouldn't mind prepping a silo. IMO, it seems easier to do the final part solo as less enemies spawn. If you're on right now, I could add you, clear a silo for you before I call it a night
---
I can tell you that the first couple of times I ran this event with my tesla using main, I did not realize it was the cause of the lag. I thought it was just another Bethesda bug issue with the event. It is only after reading the posts on reddit that I realized that the tesla was to blame and so I have stopped using it during that event.
---
I just started playing a few weeks ago and have come across many many helpful people and its been a wholesome experience **except** whenever I try to take a workshop. Every time I take a workshop some high level player shoots me dead and takes it instead. Kind of a bummer, but other than that, everyone has been really nice. :)
---
It's 8:45am and I'm just having my coffee before I log in.
---
Use a .50 cal for now and level up.
---
Ammo becomes less a problem later in the game.
---
It’s a bersecker btw. I was able to use it on the queen solo but it took me longer compared than my other guns
---
Lol, it's almost 3am here. I'll go ahead and get a silo started. Just message me your psn and I'll add you
---
&gt; **Assaultrons - is there a way to defeat them?** 
---
Yes - Unleash a Fisto at them....
---
I'm createbeauty on PSN.

---
You two love Bethesda games don't you :)
---
I've seen his videos, just didn't remember about it.
---
Still does what it says on the tin though? I’ve been running a quad explosive one for a while, it’s really grown on me
---
Thanks for the link though.
---
The only weapons unaffected are *"simple"* (unmodded; standard) weapons without any buffs or perks.
---
Another way to do it:
---
Go to Quarry X3 then hide in the building. Only the hatchlings can get through
---
I'll try to open the side doors so you can get through easily
---
"Side Hoe" Sloth.... Does that mean you were fuckn it on your free time? Puts an entire new meaning to "Wasteland Whisperer". It gets lonely in the Wasteland i take it.... Things like the Sheepsquatch starting to make alot more sense now.
---
I trade it during SBQ event to make sure that they don't server hop. 😂
---
Well you can only hold 5000 bullion at once, so to raise the daily limits by much more, we'd also need a max cap increase as well or we'd be topping out.  
---
The other side of this is that there are people like me who basically have all the bullion stuff they need/want and dont really care anymore.  Unless the next new stuff also needs bullion, we've kind of hit a limit here.
---
If that guy can launch a nuke faster than you guys killing the SBQ, you guys suck.
---
if you think that its fine the way it is then why didn't you just say that at the beginning? you could have just said, "I think the way it is currently is fine" and left it at that. But no, you just had to start a huge argument, making yourself look like an asshole. If you just said that it was perfect the way it is, and you commented that, if I or someone else responded how or why, you could respond explaining. If I responded aggressively, then that would make me look like an asshole.
---
I remember when I had just unlocked gold bullion and was wondering how I was going to manage to get 20 treasury notes a day. 🤣 Little did I know that participating in events and stuff will overload me with them.
---
To preserve unique junk, try putting it in a secret vending machine at 30000 caps. I place mine out of bounds.
---
I enjoy giving newbies plans and weapons and canned meet stew and stimpaks etc when they first join the game.
---
Not against players, there’s a damage cap
---
I agree with you, OP, they should increase the amount of gold bullion that you can get per day with the gold press.
---
However, taking into account that Fallout 76 is a MMORPG game, Bethesda has to keep players playing daily somehow. It’s similar to grinding for daily items in games like Destiny, WOW or Warframe. They have to keep players grinding for legendary gear and treasury notes. Bethesda will also have to take into account the max speed at which players can get items after any tweak. That grind, after all ,is the MMORPG formula of artificial limitation mixed with daily rewards. 
---
With that being said they should definitely change it to be at least 250-300 gold bullion per day, since I don’t think that would upset the balance of things too much for the game.
---
This was my preferred method until I got FO1st. 
---
Now I have a dedicated Lead run that starts at Green County Lodge and circles around all the hotspots, ending at the monorail. 
---
One 'run' takes about 30 minutes and nets me around 1000 lead. Then I can server hop and rinse and repeat as much as needed. 
---
As such... I haven't had to bother farming lead or crafting ammo for over a month now.
---
GG. If you want more, upgrade your luck. The chance of getting it is directly connected to luck. Also don't sit around to wait if it picks it up, it moves right a tiny bit when it actually picks it up.
---
..but i have no food on me
---
Oooh, that's sounds like a thrill. Last week I took on a mirelurk horde out in the bog, and felt like Vadim. A mirelurk, no problem! *Two legendary Kings, three hunters, 5 killclaws and 2 bloodrage proceed to fuck me up*
---
Don’t getcha hopes up, big boss. SHS was Raider Bot Ace’s special friend
---
Yes, it buffs whatever you're using to do damage, from unarmed to energy heavy weapons.
---
Half the fun for me in fallout is ignoring the roads and wandering all zip zaggy through the forest tripping over cool stuff.
---
But do you have suicidal depression in stock? Not even kleo had that
---
It does, my build usuallu runs 20 or so luck. I get one every 10 or so tries
---
Sugar Grove for screws? I remember those days. I guess you never found the far superior 'hidden' room full of typewriters, fans, globes and loose screws I take it? ;p
---
Happy cake day
---
The whole “random enemies attack your CAMP” thing is so stupid anyway, they ignore literally every other structure in the wasteland.
---
+ the accuracy
---
This aside, I’m enjoying the Earle tested series Capt 👍🏼
---
Im still gonna leave the game after i grab it so good luck
---
Lies! How dare you besmerch Ghrams name, he was protecting the wasteland from the true Villian! He was putting the poor thing out of its misery. "Tell us where Uncle FroRanger touched you"
---
At 8 Treasury notes you can do 1 ACP, the 3 daily rep quests, and be sitting at 17 earned. It's a nice way to build a bank of notes rather than needing to play for 2+hours.
---
You should get loot of you damage it. Try to get adleast 1k damage (turn damage markers on) for an almost guaranteed chance to get it. The game sometimes doesn't like to drop it
---
I’m that person that does this, I also have no weapons that one shot, so I usually take a beating from the mole miners on purpose to let everyone get a shot in. However on occasion there’s sometimes one guy that decides to one shot him when I’ve gestured.
---
I agree with a separate bag for dropped junk on purpose but not this whole pvp thing. This also causes a lot of problems for new players that are still working out how the game works. There will be more problems with lower levels being set up on purpose for pvp.
---
Only a couple weeks ago I picked up a bag at the Queen event a few minutes after it had finished, thought it was unwanted junk. Next thing I'm being shot at by a low level. Realised he was searching for it so motioned him over, dropped his stuff plus some extra gear. I'm near 500 on my main so didn't need it, just don't like seeing junk go to waste lol. Not all us players are assholes after all.
---
Poison résistance is totally différent. 2 occurences of the préfixe is enough simply because poison cant do more damage to you than the 50 you are protected for.
---
Thats why I personally aim for 2 poison resist, 2\3 AP refresh, 0\1 Rad resist as the secondary star on my armor.
---
Roger that! Thank you :)
---
Well, I would actually really appreciate that! XB1. Tag = N0 NAM3 KILL3R.
---
Thank you!
---
2 is enough if you have Actiin boy, if not 3, and you can ad 1\2 poison resist 1\2 rad resist pièces. And for melee characters, some +str pieces
---
I'm on Xbox and on at least 70% of the ACPs I went to, there were at least one person using a Tesla and I always take my time to message them asking to not use it and explaining about the ash piles tanking everybody's frames. Most of the time they keep using it through the event but many of them message back later apologizing and saying they didn't know they were the ones causing the lag. Most people I've seen using Teslas and replying me back afterwards are on the lvl 50 to 100 range, but on the past few days I'm starting to notice a bunch of level 200+ using Teslas during the event and not giving a shit, clearly trolling, just like it used to be when the Strangler Heart PA was glitched and tanked everybody's frames during the SBQ fights.
---
Im not in a rush,i won't be able to play that often any more so the grind will probably take me even more like 3 months.
---
I would buy the flamer one in a heartbeat
---
If you are a pc player, you can find very good promotion online
---
People keep saying "just buy it" as if the point of the preview wasn't so that you saw it before buying it.
---
You do not need to respec to play NW. Your character is imported but levels independently to adventure and takes a different set of perk cards. Once you switch back to adventure your character and all items will still be there, no need to swap card etc
---
Personally I like to have 3-4, maybe even 5.
---
Yeah, and with the low cap on legendary scrip, I'm constantly having to spend legendary scrip, and I haven't found a reason yet to spend it on anything other than trying to roll a better legendary item. Recycling the unwanted legendaries runs the vendor out of legendary scrip, but I'm always hitting the cap even though they run out of scrip to buy with.
---
If I'm missing something and would be better off spending legendary scrip another way, I'd welcome the info.
---
Yeah, people like this ARE what makes the game great.  It's been as long as a year since I've met some of them, and I still remember their kindness.
---
have you tried VPN?
---
Well look at it this way, pvp earns you caps and the ability for revenge, so they take your junk and you kill them. If they have some of their own junk in there they can also pvp you or plain up go for revenge, when they own a explosive tesla i wish you best of luck.
---
I think it's best to not implement this because people will abuse this system, just think about it.
---
Good job!
---
Same here it sucks
---
I know the punchbowl at my camp is loaded with NS, every now and then I will take a sip myself just to see where I go.
---
Jetpack for the win
---
Like typing google into Google and hitting search
---
No problem friend! On any two handed weapon I definitely keep a look out for that 40% faster swing speed, it really makes the difference sometimes. 
---
If you have any other questions, feel free to DM me and I got you.
---
Each one replaces the other, you can only have one of them active at a time
---
Remember that while inside an event you can simply turn the event off in the pip boy by removing it. And because of this people can abuse the pvp system by running into other people their bullets and finish them off
---
Back during launch if you shot fast enough you could kill people in pacifist mode
---
Same, always wanted to try it but no one ever bats an eye at it
---
Crap odds for the good rewards compared to the effort put in. Not many people understand how to do the event. And it intimidates weak players.
---
Yeah. I turn up, wait, then give up. There is no way I can do it alone.
---
Pretty sure I saw a sulfur fountain camp item is coming as well
---
It's a massive pain in the ass to complete and the rewards aren't worth the effort.
---
NW is better than Fortnite, change my mind. You can actually jump 2 stories high and have unlimited resources.
---
Sitting on 2k treasury notes hoping they increase the limit
---
Because you can buy bear amr plans for cheap now. 
---
I still will run it for xp, but I dont bother unless 3 or more people are already doing it.
---
I agree, however people simply shouldn't build trap camps. It's Fallout, i'd expect this in GTA or RDR not Fallout.
---
Best way to play is on a building team, if you run events, just before it ends, change the team goal to event team, get the bonus xp, then switch back to building team again 👍
---
Excellent!!!
---
Might be old maths as they've tweaked it a couple of times since and like they said. Legendary perks. Not common perks. Meant to be a reward.
---
It used to exist, back at launch.
---
That or any other legacy
---
Yeah, i pve 75% of the time and keep pacifist off just for workshops or those itchy trigger fingers at the sbq with their legacy tesla's
---
I seem to find adhesive in creatures that don't normally drop it plus i find a but ton of duct tape and wonderglue in my travels around the wasteland
---
Scrap boxes? I got a few due to the legendary run they could help especially with lots of junk
---
I'm 303 and haven't done it....although it might happen before the end of the year.  :)   I've done it about four or five times with partners.
---
Are you using the CAMP skin acquired from The Legendary Run?
---
I don't know why people are downvoting you, but you definitely aren't in the wrong. The only way I could see justifying that guy's behavior is if he was just worried everyone else would kill it before he got a chance, but that excuse only flies for the first occurrence. Maybe karma will kick in and he'll roll nothing but rolling pins and single action revolvers for the foreseeable future.
---
I crafted 50K ultracite 2mmEC and I used them all in 5 ACP, very expensive 😞
---
Shhhhh we got a new homie in the den: Smokey T. Bear
---
That line "I'll sell you some more" reminds me of that line from gta which the assistant gives after you're full on snacks. "When you've finished what you've got i'll give you some more"
---
I recently equiped 3 pieces with action boy level 3. I can VATs fire a full clip from The Fixer, and buy the time I finish reloading, my AP is back to 100%. Or, I can run until exhausted, take a few steps, and take off running again.
---
RIP forever in our hearts and the Gorilla Grove
---
Ikr
---
The solution is simple. You should obviously just log in to the game every single day to cash out 200 gold a day. Bethesda's game health monitor does not see a problem with this scenario.
---
The majority of events I do I just do for the fun. Treasury notes too of course. Killing legendary enemies is enough of a reason for the chance at something awesome. There must be a reason people avoid it. Rewards for many other events suck but people do them
---
First I go to the prison. Pick up the plates/bar there. 
---
Then I go the flat wood motel. 
---
Then the fire station. 
---
Then I hit up all three nuclear stations. That right there is quite a lot of lead. Plus a bunch of cans I find along the way.
---
Try to bulk your junk, get rid of items you never use.
---
Its just a very challenging event to complete, even with 5 high level players that know how what they are doing it is still very hard to keep all three animals alive.
---
Tbh, I just use the photomode glitch to skip just about everything. It saves a lot of time and resources and when running it solo, the launch prep is a breeze as there's only a handful of enemies. I spend most of the prep just sitting around doing nothing. Add one person though and you'll be busy for the most part haha
---
Were you needing your own launch as well? If so, I could help out but just not now, it's really late and I'm calling it a night.
---
I decided to give up on having a pet a long time ago until Bethesda decides the players can have supported pets/companions.
---
Imagine how much money Bethesda will make from mongrel, Wolf, &amp; cyberdog skins for a dog pet/companion Not to mention if they give us glowing, scorched,
---
Ive had this same thing happen, there was no one there on the mao att all so they weren't in a different instance,  just nobody showed.
---
Would I be able to change my special points in NW? Or do I need to change my special points in adventure for it to take affect
---
Chinese stealth armor was a game changer for me in Rad Rumble. Before unlocking it I always used my Excavator to collect ore - not for extra ore, I know that doesn't work in Rad Rumble, I was just carrying an Excavator set as a utility item. I don't like wearing PA so I only brought it out for nuke zones, Rad Rumble and trips to Lucky Hole, and I didn't see the point in carrying a second set for a marginal improvement in resistances. Anyway, in my Excavator set I could barely make it out of the tunnels alive after collecting all 10, and when I finally unlocked the CSA I figured it'd be a small improvement. Holy shit did I underestimate it. I'm pretty sure I could go afk in those tunnels without any worry.
---
You can be confident that if you see me at Rad Rumble on PC, we're at minimum hitting the 40 ore mark. Once that's done, I start playing healer with my swing speed Shishkebab.
---
Lore wise, I think they are supposed to originate from a supply depot just West of Point Pleasant. Of course they don't actually fly across the map, but the further away from that depot you are, the longer it takes. Tried one in the forest region and it's pretty quick. Tried one far South and it takes a while.
---
This has become one of my favourite events to do, lots of xp and a few legendaries.I prefer it when no one turns up and they just ruin it.  Did one last night and I can get it to max level by collecting the sludge and killing the mole rats. Some guy came and started collecting the sludge but not killing the mole rats that also give you toxic sludge. So I was running around trying to kill the rats that he was leaving to run free. Much easier so but yes means I don’t get the rare rewards.
---
I use junkies LMG to clear the bunker, asaultrons die before they use their laser. Once u done it once, the second time will be easier because you'll know where certain enemies are.  Hack the terminals to put the laser turrets offline.
---
Not the only way to achieve this, but responding to your specific concern: Line up a public team for Bonus Event XP with higher level players, and you should have greater fortune. You can do this by starting a Bonus Event XP public team and running Guided Meditation, Scorched Earth, A Colossal Problem, or One Violent Night -- events favored by high-level players.
---
This comment is underrated
---
Stay in the forrest or toxic valley and do your quests.
---
Yeah ive had this bug intermittently since launch, seen it probably 50-60 times.
---
Reguarding my pitch for companions/followers make them tanky but not high damaging who you recruit to follow you around the map. If they go down you need to stimpack them, if they die fully they respawn at your camp, and they return to your camp if you start up a non-workshop event.
---
The reasons behind these ideas are we don't want them going down all the time against our high level enemies but we should not expect them to solo them either, instead being melee tanks or ranged support. Maybe they should get buffs from Charisma/Animal Friendship/Wasteland Whispered/New Perks.
---
The suggestions reguarding the need to stimpack, 'death', and no events is further balancing adding a bit of maintenance into doing content with the companion but also setting up a no event participation for the sake of potential lag, kill sharing, and such.
---
Back when it was introduced some players got pretty aggressive about the "right way" to do the event because they wanted maximum rewards, so many others who play for fun - me included - never bothered with it.
---
From what I've heard the same is happening at A Colossal Problem, part of the reason why I'm staying away for the time being.
---
Alright. Is that Middwest/Northwest parts of the map?
---
The community is what keeps this game installed for me.  So long as you steer clear of pvp, the vast majority of people are just trying to have a good time.
---
Knowing this helps me stomach the odd unpleasant interactions I occasionally get.
---
This really is the multiplayer social experience for introverts, given the amount of people who are happy to be friendly and helpful so long as you respect their space.
---
Hope you find your forever C.A.M.P soon!
---
Thanks, but no help needed with launch.  I do need help nailing photomode glitch tho.   I've been practicing in my camp.  On one door, I do it like 90 percent of the time.  On the other two, maybe the reverse or worse.  Absolutely clueless as to why the difference.
---
Everything has been, bloodied is still on top.
---
i hate to break it to everyone but there is a formula for its drop chance:    
---
((*luck*×4)+*attempts)/20*
---
double prefix does not work with a weapon that has a core ammo. so yes, double is inert on a gatling laser.
---
There will be sinks. Extra lunchboxes will be available for 100 bullion next update.
---
I'm a bit confused.
---
Because instanced locations are no-building-zones anyways.
---
The problem with mechanically focused fights is that nobody seems to follow the mechanics for some reason. We already have Project Paradise and Encryptid, but half the people I see show up to them just run around shooting anything that moves until they fail or someone else finds the food/takes the pylons for them.
---
Small rant aside, I agree everything needs rebalanced. There's no reason one or two builds should obliterate bosses in seconds when others need to stack gimmicks to kill what are effectively trash mobs.
---
region map: [https://game-maps.com/Fallout-76/Fallout-76-Walkthrough-and-Maps.asp](https://game-maps.com/Fallout-76/Fallout-76-Walkthrough-and-Maps.asp)
---
On PC maybe.
---
WoW is known to be one of, if not the worst for balancing, save EQ2.
---
No at all, I'm on ps4 and have 3 plans sat in my inventory gathering dust, they are selling for between 5-10k right now.
---
overall you sound sore, as if replacing your build is hard work.
---
I'm at a point where I'm intentionally trying to burn through fuel and plasma carriages because I refuse to spend my points on sub-par exchanges but also keep getting close to the point limit because I convert most ammo i find. I liked the idea and am quite happy the made it better with the 10x &amp; 100x.
---
My personal trick is using my phone to take pictures of my ammo to convert.
---
Stop looking, and what you seek may appear before you.
---
Have someone make a heated coil baseball bat for you so that you don't have to worry about ammo all the time.  
---
Be sure to be sleep every hour or so and keep up well-rested effect.  
---
Attend every event in  the Forest that you can until level 30 or so, then Toxic Valley to 40, and ash heap to 50.  Note:  may change with One Wasteland on 15th
---
I was wandering allot with the lone wanderer perk card full stars for the fist 6-8 months I haven't the luck to be helped ...but when I was helped with (armor strategy ,power armor, guns+bullet's, med's, perk cards, buying and selling strategy, dayli quest's) I give up the card and start to play in multiplayer =the essence of the game is multiplayer and to make friends ,to do this need to be as you are - respectful and helpfully with others 😁😁😁👋👋👋🤝 cheers !
---
Was the last one I found, hanging out by the big pool of water by where meat week is
---
Fill it full of ghouls and we have our own DayZ.
---
Kind of.
---
Yeah it’s the little things I guess haha. 
---
And happy cake day!
---
Have yet to even see a copy of those plans on Xbox. 
---
Be I only just recently learned that's where they drop and that that was the reason me and my friend never got any legendary ones as drops.
---
Why we are now 2 manning the event till we can get it to drop.
---
Tip: when Fasnacht comes around next year, farm the ever-loving shit out of the beeswax by server hopping between events to grab it. I'm sitting on like 20k from that alone. In the meantime, Earle's minions are keeping me nicely topped up.
---
South of Vault 76 and the two ladies there's a watch tower just off the path, she can spawn there, so server hop a few times until she's there
---
Overhauled pets would be ez money for BGS, i was thinking about some mechanics like that sonic game back in the day where u could care for, breed, and raise those little sprites and they had all different variations.
---
lol the other way around for me actually. I got one I fo4 within the first 3 hours.
---
Have you seen the posts in which people experienced a visual bug which showed the nuke having the blast radius of a nuclear winter one? THAT'S how big nukes should be
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/Bakt2xL](https://imgur.com/gallery/Bakt2xL) for reference
---
Alright, sounds good then. Will do. I went to my first event yesterday, and was blown away by the fact that it actually is a Fallout MMO. A good many people joined, and it was cool to participate.
---
Yeah normally she appears when u dont look for her my advice would be in the bog the trainyard, when you spawn look to your left there should be an encounter spawn i got her there several times
---
Ammo is my main concern as well, but who knows how it'll pan out
---
Mine is 4 and it took 900 hours lol. 
---
You might be right yes.
---
No, no, no...that's at level 420...
---
300 is when we put on our Grognak and/or wildman costumes and follow you around with spears.
---
c'mon, that's a really stupid thing to say
---
Honestly its a right pain, as far as I know you need to keep all 3 creatures alive for a chance for it to drop. Your time would be better spent hopping player vendors look for the plan. Or join a trading forum they can still be got cheap on them.
---
\*cires in oppressor mk2\* I still have nightmares
---
Which one did you do?  Glad you had a good time!
---
So does reading your misspelled brainfart of a post.
---
You're running Ammosmith and Super Duper right? I mean, it's still rough, but it helps. Try claiming the Hemlock workshop when you can, and use Hard Bargain 3 + Grape Mentats to buy bulk acid to help lower the price. Many of the vendors at Whitesprings sell bulk acid.
---
The food processing plant, and a legendary flying scorched creature.
---
Maybe it does but it’s true
---
Everyone says that, but I have given up on that event. It's really fun, but I lose my mind over the fact that clicking on the majority of lead nodes doesn't do anything, even though they are still visible.
---
Will sure make farming xp much easier
---
They're adding a new ammo perk.
---
oh man
---
My chems already negate the bobblehead effects.
---
You can shoot a nuke from a fat boy for a small explosion.  Somehow you can’t envision a smaller yield tactical nuke? 
---
There are higher and lower yield nukes just as there are high and low yield smart bombs.
---
The effort isn’t high. The luck to get other 2 players that know what to do is unimaginable.
---
Yeah. Everyone's like: "BuT mUh AmMo!11!" When in reality you'll have much more since ammo factory is multiplicative lol
---
1 poison resist piece = less damage
---
2 poison resist pieces = no damage
---
3 poison resist pieces = no damage
---
1 AP piece = quick regen
---
2 AP pieces = full bar immediately 
---
3 AP pieces = full bar immediately
---
See what I meant?
---
Good tips, if those locations haven't been looted already. I rarely am lucky enough to find them all in one go.
---
Oh my lol
---
Truth
---
Prefer to earn the massive amounts of XP in the process. Plus usually upwards of 3 or more legendaries.
---
We can each max out one side alone, heard that you only need 2 alive to have a chance for the Bear Claw to drop. 
---
Main issue is having to blink and suddenly the dam friendly animal vanishes completely into another pen where it winds up with a ton of mobs on it.
---
Need to find me a decent sishkabob to keep them alive better.
---
I'm super looking forward to it. Max level gear. More xp. The whole map will be worth exploring again
---
Yeah its really not that hard i just think alot of players psych themselves out when they see it pop up because theyve had bad runs in the past.
---
At level 15 you can get your first suit of power armor \^\^ You can farm it in clarksburg, which is a city approximately in the middle of the toxic valley
---
I think one issue with Project Paradise is that it cannot be initiated on demand, you have to wait for it. This usually means it'll either be empty, or people will rush in and go crazy. If you could spawn the event yourself, it would encourage people to create learning parties and whatnot.
---
It is a shame that the vault raid was scrapped, as it was a step in the right direction. I say step, because a lot of the mechanics were frustrating rather than challenging, not to mention how buggy the while thing was.
---
Yeah, there's always someone around looking to jump people at workshops.  I just avoid them now.  They fixed the issue that flagged you for pvp outside a workshop, but it's just not worth the hassle as far as I'm concerned.  Pity, but it is what it is, I suppose.
---
No remotely meaningful content either. Missions? What the fuck is a mission? Go collect more flowers or drug a bobcat. You know, cowboy stuff.
---
It would be cool to launch a REAL nuke for maybe like a live event because these current one's just feel weak to the actual fallout universe with atomic power and all. Bethesda can make the excuse of having all different kinds of nukes.
---
Yea it’s annoying the best reward is only available not only when you did your part right, but at least 2 other players as well. But I still run it even if I have to solo and get the worse reward
---
When they actually iron out what will be in the patch.
---
The whole point of the test server is to figure out what works, what needs polished and what is still broken.
---
Until they know that, they won't know what is going to be included with the next patch.
---
I actually found a suit in a shipping building east of Vault 76, and Northeast of the Overseer’s first camp you come across. But it was locked in a cage connected to a terminal, and it wouldnt open after I hacked it and gave it the command to. I felt quite cheated.
---
Makes since. Damn path to enlightmentment would blind me every single time. Stupid bugs &gt;:(
---
Aren’t all enemies going to have a high chance drop the ammo you were using against them? Like the Wendigos at ACP but across everything. That should certainly help.
---
It should help, but when you use a gauss minigun it isn’t going to be much
---
Is there a secret to completing the quest? I've had every one of her holotapes for months, according to the wiki, but keep getting the same dialogue from her as if I haven't found all of them.
---
I haven't properly looked at the drop rates for the event so you could well be right a out only needing 2 creatures. I run the event with my B/E flamer which does make it a lot easier.
---
Where was it when it disappeared?  On you, in inventory, in stash?  Guessing on you, but...
---
What bluekthulhu said. Double prefix was bugged from the beginning for the core ammo guns.
---
Just make sure you get your possum badge kills with musical instruments and railway rifles in before if they aren’t supported by your build
---
Also, the items that give a good yield of lead: paint cans and rat poison, 5 lead each. Combination wrench and makeshift battery are 2 lead each. Flatwoods is an excellent place to do a little looting round in if you have the time.
---
Scrip is worth less than whatever its printed on. Mr Fuzzy Tokens are the only true currency of Appalachia.
---
I find my place near the overseer house. If you see a full brick house nearby, it's probably me
---
I am interested in the enemy scaling and the legendary perks. However, I am apprehensive of the balance changes.
---
I know a balance overhaul is needed, but I wish they would've gone that extra step and started rebalancing weapons with the new formula, rather than just promising to do it sometime in the future.
---
I do not run a bloodied or junkies build, so I am concerned that my middling damage will also get hit by the nerf hammer. Especially when you consider that I run an unarmed build.
---
Basically, I am on the side of "yes we need damage adjustments, but please do it properly" and I am concerned that they have NOT done that.
---
The core of Fallout is political nuance. The whole point of Arroyo was the Vault Dweller seeing that the BoS were just as flawed as the old world they warn against. Almost everyone is obsessed with the Old World it's the lock of the post-apocalytic setting, not letting go.
---
I really hope this new BoS has the classic feel of BoS first, but I think their temporal proximity to Maxon and the Great War they don't need to be fully entrenched in isolationism and thus can be a mix of mutie hating xenophobes here to take away our nukes, power armor, and energy weapons while still helping the region by killing the greater threats and maybe some public relations work on the side and mutual benefit.
---
Also I always like to remind others the BoS attacked the NCR by attacking Redding's gold mines to kick the NCR off their new gold standard and stop them from using the gold for old world tech production. (They were also still sore that the NCR got a lot of things and information from attacking Navarro.)
---
Let's be real, most players even the high level ones have no idea what to do. 
---
They always go for the Venison and never max it out. I always go for Toxic Sludge because people don't do it properly but no one ever defends their animal.
---
After a while you get disappointed in people's stupidity.
---
Yeah it's a real pain, so easy to miss nodes, but on the positive side you can almost always walk away with a decent stash of weapons in addition to lead ore. I'm pretty sure there is always at least 1 legendary enemy and someone in the church area has a gatling gun.
---
I haven't looked into it. I know the candy from the school isn't worth the effort (by a long shot), but what's good about Mr Fuzzy Tokens?
---
I should also probably also start looking into crafting flux, but I'm pretty new to the game. Also, the game doesn't seem to be offering much content past the end of the anemic storyline.
---
The larger blast radius of real life nuke blasts is because they are air burst, meaning they explode in the air, whereas Fallout nukes seem to be ground explosions. Ground explosions have the ground absorb a lot of the energy and therefore makes a smaller blast radius. Also ground explosions are the nukes that actually cause fallout, the games namesake! So they are correct in using those types for the lore, haha.

---
My magic 8 ball.
---
I can make them for free for you, add KoreaRiceBox
---
For every person it motivated to complete the event, there would be at least one who would see it as an opportunity to do nothing and benefit from the work of others.   I have no idea how they could address both issues successfully.
---
Make sure its not static spawn, i dont have turets and attacks are rare.
---
What is the wrong way for ACP?
---
Not sure that 2 AP refresh pièces is enough if you dont get an AP refresh perk such as lone wanderer and\or action boy.
---
And right now, to min\max, y8u wznt tenderizer in charisma and 15 agility is often full taken with only 1 perk point left for action boy in the commando builds
---
Just a quick RIP to The Tomorrow Children. A whole game based around that concept that was born too early to live for long.
---
Lol. Exiting the event took longer than the actual “main” event (which is what she said).
---
Yes I am.
---
I've never done it so I can't say but the quest itself might be poorly implemented and need a revamp if it's a case where nobody playing knows what to do
---
Which ones are you using? I’ve never had that issue.
---
Yeah but it'll make more weapons practically useless once you reach end game. I've got a quad explosive single action revolver I use for low level areas, if low level areas enemies are then matched to my level this and many other weapons will do diddly shit to them.
---
After level 50 everyone will be either using a fixer, handmade or a heavy weapon, every other weapon will be consiced to the scrip bin
---
Not a fan. Some days I just want an easy walk through the Forest
---
Simple; it's too difficult.
---
Like the Dark Zones in The Division. Always gets the blood up just a bit just knowing something could potentially go down.
---
He glitched through the ground on my last event and was under the forklift. You could hear him and showed on the compass but couldn't Finnish him off with less than half health after mutating. Hope they fix this soon. all I need is my plushie plan and harpoon gun and will have all the rewards.
---
I've had that happen as well, we had taken him down l to half health after regeneration, then he glitched through the ceiling
---
Then you're selling them for too much. Drop your prices and they'll shift.
---
I carry every holotape I've ever picked up with me at all times.
---
Y'know... just in case I need them or something.
---
Idk, just doesn't seem fitting for the fallout universe and the gritty American government of it. For me at least it's hard to believe they would develop something so small with such a big silo when they've embraced the atom and it's possibilities unlike how we fear it in real life.
---
No I don't have them up for sale. They are just sat waiting in case I want to make a new character at some point. I could sell them easy for 5-10k on the reading forums or in my vendors. I just dont want to sell them.
---
Yeah. Prepare for the grind if you're going to use an LMG. I've got a *3 troubleshooters lmg+50% lmb and it's a beast, but oh lawd the ammo consumption.
---
Ss under armour with shielded mod gives u 4 strength and other stats I can’t recall. Wear in under your armour as the name suggests. Nice stat boost. Worth getting
---
Exactly, there’s easy junk runs and there’s something satisfying about one shotting a ghoul charging at you
---
You can stack 
---
A bobble
---
A mag 
---
And then I use on trip ballistic bock and physco tats 
---
All 4 stack 
---
After update will they still stack
---
With just a .44 too, ha
---
It’s more the build than the weapon. I can drop scorchbeast with a low health build with a crafted non legendary fixer easily
---
Just keep your eye on your compass, if you see a person go and check who it is, eventually you will find her.
---
Just spend 20 a day 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I think you mean, "the IQ of people in general", don't you?   Widespread stupidity and an inability to think analytically.   At all.
---
Can confirm same problems when using new camp skin.
---
I wish it was easier to have a “new player” camp. I have mine near 76 with real low prices sometimes free for new players but sometimes some lvl 300+ dick cleans me out and I’ll see them reselling my stuff. It pisses me off so much
---
Simple oversight. 
---
They failed to readjust the normal spawns loot list. 
---
Don't expect the screw feeding frenzy to last long.
---
If you ever get the plan for the Marine armor helmet, it’s a good money maker. I still grab plungers and basketballs out of habit...
---
I only miss like 4 magazines. It's a lot of camp budget those almost full  4 displays
---
Makes sense except not the fact of wendigos refunding your ammo so don’t get why they’re so nice about the loot off these bodies?
---
You should try other non competitive multiplayer games. You might be pleasantly surprised!
---
Things I heard include "wrong" nuke placement, lower level players showing up, lower level players standing around in the open and shooting at the enemies, things like that. Someone shared a video about three safe spots in the cavern, with *slightly* unfriendly advice to go stand there and not ever move.
---
I agree and the Vault Tec Truck  that’s in her display case upstairs
---
Also if they would stop randomly firing at my bramin, collectotron and other camp buildings that would be nice as well
---
Ammo drop doesn’t match up
---
I am with you, I am hating the idea of scaled enemies, I don't understand how they can make it work. Really dont want to be walking through the forest to find level 52 gutsies waiting to chew me up.
---
one technically, can get best rewards with 2 animals alive
---
I found her when I quit looking. Then I couldn't stand having her around and got rid of her pretty fast. She's annoying as hell.
---
My camp is in the forest and gets attacked and broken regularly, it’s probably going to be awful when One Wasteland rolls out.
---
You can do that with a bloodied combat rifle as well, don’t really need the fixer or a handmade, as a lvl 120 bloodied stealth commando it was far easier than I expected
---
Watch a few videos on builds. You can reallocate perk points later but it takes lvling up anywhere between 10 or 30 times to drastically change builds.
---
I would do it more often if it awarded repair kits, but the SBQ does that so ima go do that instead
---
Alright I will. The perk cards kind of confused me when I started but i think i have it figured out.
---
396 Heavy here. That build can solo too ( a lot of ammo though). Most hits with the Bloodied/Primed 50 Cal hit for 30-50 on the head.  
---
I tried solo melee, but not optimised, so I would die and lose the damage I did. Hit for 6-700 (1200 on a stealth hit), I am sure with work I could get those numbers up significantly.
---
thats your issue, had a friend using the skin and her ally exhibited the exact same behaviour.
---
I think thats more to do with the new ammo drop system, its separate to the standard loot that the wendigos drop.
---
No doubt. It goes against everything fallout 3,NV and 4 did. All of then had "starting" areas to explore. We need that even more in the online version. Otherwise how the hell are the lower level guys going to gather resources if the forest region is open to higher levels farming xp.
---
The head is it's strong point, go for the legs, then the torso.
---
Murmghr picks a weapon based on the plans you ahve right? What if you start a new character, only buy the plans you want and roll away?
---
Ammo won't be an issue, plus more xp, and legendary enemies that drop things worth a damn
---
You don’t HAVE to buy the under armor first. You can buy whatever in any order. I went for the chest and then the jet pack mod as my first purchases.
---
Wipe your butt with them, duh
---
Probably because they are powered.
---
We should have a new legendary perk for armour that disregards it as being armour for the beserkers perk (like chameleon pieces)
---
you want more realism?
---
then an irradiated zone should no longer be accessible for the next 200 years, as is the case for example in the glowing sea in FO4 or the west in FO3.
---
Power armor should continue to be highly radioactive after a visit to the zone, so that it should actually be disposed of.
---
a certain dose of radiation should lead to inevitable death
---
There are 1000 other things related to radioactivity that are not realistic, just criticizing the radius as too unrealistic suggests a certain intention, probably something in your favor
---
Poison damage. It's the bane of my life in Fallout
---
I would not get the under armor unless you really need those stats boosted but there are other ways! Shielded vault jumpsuit is the best under armor in my opinion. Go for the straight Secret Service Armor first so you can start rolling for legendary versions! And don’t buy the helmet it’s worthless!
---
I can only relate to the low level showing up, but only when they outnumber veteran players with adequate firepower.
---
 I've got enough perk points saved to max ammo factory straight out going to supply my server. With cheap ammo.
---
Oh wow did not even think about that camp skin..
---
Can now confirm that removing the future tech skin and yet again moving my camp solved the problem.
---
Thanks 😁
---
Thanks man! I’ll try it out!
---
Secret service chest piece, jet pack, SS underarmor and lining, Armco ammo machine, chemist backpack, grocers backpack
---
I was going against a SBQ tonight with the rad storm it was awesome!
---
why should prefixes that dont require heath gating be on par with one that does? just because you think something is meta and been around "too long"? no
---
I love the ultracite armor. I just wish it had better skins.
---
The game is boring now.... I am looking forward to one Wasteland.
---
Oh shit I didn't even check if I could so that.
---
I'm always looking for rubber to make marine wetsuit hats. You could sell it in your camp. Might as well make some caps.
---
I killed him with my bloodied melee build, careful as to not die (though I died once to stomps) and one other guy who was probably bloodied commando as he was sneaking around and frog hoppin gunnin. 2 person kill and it wasnt too much of a challenge. 
---
My favourite part was when 3 PA Heavy weapons dudes dropped down the shaft to see his body fall over RIP
---
It's really not that hard. 
---
They've already done it to some degree with the SBQ where you have to contribute a minimum threshold of damage in order to get her loot. Few complain about how unfair that system is.
---
Really the people who have a problem with moochers just have fragile egos.
---
If it doesn't affect what rewards you get in the slightest or the ability to complete the event, who cares. They're not taking your share of the loot. You get exactly the same whether they participated or not.
---
If Fasnacht is anything to go by, this "demotivation" thing you bring up is really a non-issue.
---
If you're looking for fast XP, try to at least be present for Events, even if you're unable to contribute at first. Events and Daily Quears award a lot of XP and are a great way to ensure you consistently level up a few times a day. Experiment with different weapons to see what you enjoy, then start looking for perk build advice
---
Don't know why you're getting downvoted, you're correct.  
---
This is what I use, and then turn off the turrets with terminals.
---
I feel like this is a good possibility, but I also feel like if it was, MODUS would snidely tease us about it?
---
Alright will do, thanks!
---
Suddenly Fallout 3
---
Seriously, how many performances per day do those two put on? It must be exhausting and lucrative!
---
so technically i can tame a sheepsquatch right?
---
Even if you're not going messy a desk fan or typewriter placed on your desk or maybe even a teddy bear on top of your bed would be great.
---
this is nonsense.
---
either your weapons don't match your specials or the legendary effects are utter crap or you still don't know the weak points of your opponents at level 88.
---
with assaultrons on the knees, with gutsies on the nozzle and with protectrons on the tail.
---
Lvl 3 picking locks and lvl 3 hacking helps too.
---
central processing cores do not have to be repaired, there are enough intact ones lying around.
---
Wrong sub but no
---
It's a fun challenge. Teammate and i gave it a go this weekend. We went in with 4 others,all power armoured,nobody under level 150 and a couple over 200. And we still failed. Lol.
---
Dump them all and be amazed at how much lag goes away.
---
Dont press it again tho. You might not want a ghoul slayers gatling laser (just personal preference).
---
I think assault rifle plan it is. In 1600h i only got 2. In market i saw one guy selling for 10k sometime ago
---
Yeah happens quite a lot disco in the map screen reset the game usually fixes it.
---
&gt;Getting top tier power armor takes an hour tops.
---
Would you mind elaborating?
---
Bear arms mods too?
---
On console the social menu hasnt worked for me since launch. I mean I can look at it but the friends are in random order order and nothing on that drop down action list has ever worked. It's always (at least on xbox) just an inaccurate  friends list to look at.
---
I have a feeling that this sub is going to explode when p22 goes live.  Too many sweeping changes with barely any adjustments in the PTS.
---
BGS dev:  “We’ll figure it out later.”
---
But the real question is can people browsing the machine see my custom names for the items?
---
It has nothing to do with your backpack, but with stash boxes that are close to the vending machines, and the slowed spawning of the rest of a camp.
---
So to be save from this exploit all you need to do is to move the stash boxes away from the machines.
---
It was one of my favorite events, but even if you get a squad together, run the event perfectly, kill the alpha with all test subjects surviving, it can still bug out and not complete. So I don't bother anymore..
---
It makes it alot easier if u shut them down, saves ammo aswell
---
100% agreed, would love a separate 'letters' set that's got grafitti letters.
---
assault rifle drops form census violence. I've had a few. 
---
And the spear is from savage divide events and SBQ, Cryptids and larger creatures. small chance to drop but lots of small chances to drop.

---
I believe in general, if they really want people to PvP then they Bethesda needs to invest in it more. No options and zones for NW would be a good start, revisiting Survival mode would be nice, and maybe working on some other modes and zones. There's a huge and beautiful map they have already made, just need to pick spots on it and maybe implement death match, team death match, capture the flag, ect. I personally don't like the PvP on here nor do I like the way the guns handle on a controller period on this game, but they'll never know if people will like it if they don't try. Unfortunately, for all this to happen, other important stuff would need to be shelved.
---
I've done some experimenting with this!
---
If you dump the mag, it'll go to 0 and then jump to a (from my perspective, anyhow) random number while reloading. 
---
It's not stealing ammo and it's not firing half a mag, it's just a display bug.
---
I only do them if I'm really bored. The loot isn't anything amazing, but it'll get you some scrap and give you something to do. If you're  a lower level, the loot will probably be better suited for you :)
---
You can buy with three options and sell with three options.   Options are similar to 10 pieces. 150 pieces.  3000 pieces. Not exact but hope you get the ideal.
---
REEE!!!!!
---
thats not how the game is meant to be played!!!!!
---
NERF IT AND BAN CAP!!!!
---
Yeah, we need an actual weapon tuning patch on a weapon by weapon basis, not just nerfing everything across the board so the most abusive builds are slightly less egregious.
---
I won’t be holding my breath.
---
It's probably because they change the amount crafting ammo gives you relative for the weapons that use it and maybe for the actual size of the round irl aswell. They were probably thinking more about the hunting rifle then the LMG.
---
Couldn't agree more, you wouldn't believe how often I've had to say exactly this to both Steelheads and Enclave Apologists.
---
No lie. I can easily obtain 100 rad away in a day, but I bet I've gathered less than 50 disease cures my whole time playing..
---
Seems like what a lot of games with dynamically scaled enemies fall prey to. The higher your level, the weaker you get.
---
Because you have to do something more complex than standing in place and dumping ammo into a boss while you’re completely stoned out of your mind.  That’s a big ask for a good portion of the player base.
---
There's people giving them away for free in the trade forum. 
---
You can see them selling for quite a bit like 2-3 months ago and then all of a sudden the market was flooded. I recently had a load of them which i robbed from some dupers in a train station. I don't know how they did the duping (i was wrong on the present part sorry) but it was done.
---
Where have you been the last few months?
---
Who \*would\* appoint them? The Government? They're Nazis now. A democratic vote? I sure wouldn't vote to have my technology confiscated. God? I mean really, there's nobody too appoint them. They don't need to be given authority, they establish authority.
---
I wonder what made them think a 30% buff would be all it needed
---
This is is way to optimized, it need at least few more screens for additional layer of agony.
---
Out of the hundreds of wendigo spawn I've killed only 3 had ammo on them, and no screws 🤷‍♂️
---
On the upside, at least now you have a new rug. That is, assuming you got the plans from Fastnaught
---
You running mods? The lighting is all blue, looks odd....
---
More counters, such as legendaries and separating clothes and armor would be nice, but I wouldn't personally rely on the level to judge a base without considering everything else on the list. Many people sell a lot of good stuff on their alts, myself included. I have a level 8 stuffed full of legendaries from my high level.
---
Done this event way over 100 times and I can confidently say that no more than 5 of those times has the event been maxed out. The other day I was the only person running getting ore (only managed to get 78!) While everyone fucked around and did a terrible job at keeping the crew safe.. fml
---
This answers none of those questions.
---
Its Nukashine
---
Ah, you downed shine...
---
I mean if i wanted to build inside of foundation that I could build in that parimeter
---
Todd Howard takes them and gives them the whatever faction you didn't side with. There, ya happy?
---
This is assuming the Brotherhood of Steel has just as much information as we the player do. When really... They don't, at all. They see an out of control technology designed to eliminate and replace mankind. Technology with not only the ability, but a reason to hate in the worst case scenario.   
---
That's kind of the whole mission statement of the Brotherhood, to stop potentially dangerous technology before it can become a 'worst case scenario'. Are they wrong? Quite possibly. With the stakes involved is it better to be safe than sorry? One could quite reasonably make that argument.
---
I feel lucky, 2 pies at lvl 95...
---
On my character inventory but I didn’t even bother to notice until recently and was confused. I’m not too pissed off about but still...
---
^ This. I’m not sure how they can entertain any attempt at balancing until they fix every single issue on every single weapon - most of them are still not working as intended so any ‘rebalancing’ now will only magnify this rendering some useless and others overpowered.
---
Haha well, a popup asking "are you sure you want to select &lt;ammo_name&gt;?" every time you move up or down in the list of ammo sounds like it would be effective.
---
The ammo converter  needs  to allow for Ultracite based ammo of its useless to players running primed weapons. I would prefer that it just broke the ammo down into crafting components  so I could just make what I needed.
---
This is a nice interface though &amp; a vast improvement over the garbage that Bethesda spit out.
---
I don’t know, I think Todd is too busy adding bugs.
---
The very story of how I got my second left leg armor
---
Todd aka GODD doesn't add bugs, he adds happy inconveniences
---
That's just rude dude
---
No there is no glitch that would allow you to circumvent the no-building-zones.
---
Even if you were able to somehow do it, you'd be stuck with the "can not place camp" when you re-log.
---
Ikr.... I think I stumbled across that in one of angry turtles videos
---
 the question was rhetorical
---
right, they establish "authority" over people who dont ask, want or in some cases need it. often, this makes them more akin to an occupying invasion force than anything else. 
---
they'll use the guise of "security" to justify theft, occupation, execution, consolidation of power, and so forth.  the brotherhood are not, and have never been the good guys even if roger maxons idea were of good and noble intention.
---
Also 2 loading screens, for in and out of the converting machine.
---
yep.
---
I can log in but then it times out trying to get to a world server.
---
I finally got a response, they told me to do a database rebuild.  I was able to log in again but 2 hours later got kicked, started getting the error again. db rebuild didn't help this time.
---
As it stands the only real “good” weapons are automatic rifles and heavy automatic weapons. Pistols are a dud, explosives don’t work right, single shot weapons lack the dps needed, energy weapons are disappointing across the board (except gauss maybe), and the broadsider is the broadsider. It’s really disheartening to see that despite the vast weapon variety, less than 5 weapons in total see common use.
---
And the fun thing is that in New Vegas their stance kinda made sense to me, in the sense where they were driven to almost extinction and their measures were desperate attempts to keep the chapter going.
---
Love this
---
Jetpack and torso first as others said
---
So the majority of the Fallout 76 player base are stoners... ?
---
OK my guy, have a nice day.
---
I was all for the Settlers til Ward straight up disrespected me one day when I was bringing him Intel on the raiders.. From that moment forward I was a full time raider..
---
The reason they say that is that it let's you see the full name, in the "Confirm Purchase" popup, before you actually buy the item.  Doesn't do anything for seeing it visually, but at least you can tell which arm or leg it's for, or whatever
---
for the silo doors (especially the huge blast doors) what helped me was standing on the far right of the door, near the frame, pointing the camera right at the line where the door meets the frame. You might have to wiggle around and jump a couple times before you get through..
---
Yeah, that's trash
---
Welp I hate to say it but most of u have proved me to be right considering u just straight up admitted that ur one of those that I'm complaining about u know there's a system of communication via a mic so why don't u voice it instead of being well sheep or a child like oh someone's being a douche lemme do the same the point of this post is for people to understand what they are doing is killing the experience for others its like u wouldn't go hacking if someone else was in ur game unless ur an asshole but no I just want to join the lower level players like my character so that I can actrualy enjoy the game the way I want to
---
Its the future my dude, we have rad away
---
There isn't really a way apart from levelling up. Not that I've found anyway.
---
ive got a few plans but im ps4
---
should have the UI start when you activate the machine (the animation part) to dump the ammo, then use the terminal to accept, that way there's the grace period of confirming your transaction
---
Also let me put it to u this way oh look I've nuked the scorched area with my lvl 120 oh no here's a guy with his buggy ass legacy gear ya know the energy weapons with explosive bullets and bloodied on them well then comes that guy and just shredded my scorched queen thanks mate
---
I've noticed the same, especially for those of use with the QoL perks to carry all of our aid with us, it can sometimes result in like a 5 second delay when set to Spoil. 
---
Also to help my stash and pop boy lag in general, I dumped excess notes and holo tapes and it seemed to help a bit too.
---
Funnily enough this the same argument a lot of... Ermmm... Strange individuals would make against modern police. That's a big ole' go figure on that one.
---
You need a good XP farming route and a heap of consumables. Make sure you're on a build team for the int bonus (+4 INT is +8% XP). If you can go low health with a full set of unyielding the +15 to INT will be a huge help. The egghead mutation may be worth taking too.

I was a measly lvl 8 player and received a couple of gifts along with two players in the mid 300s open a lunch box boost just for me. Gotta love the community when stuff like this happens :) I’ll be sure to spread this love to y’all in the Appalachian wasteland &lt;3 --&gt;

Max your intelligence as much as you can and hit high lev areas with lots of enemies...AngryyTurtle has a great vid for farming XP...he gains WAY more SCORE from the repeatable weekly for XP than the does with the daily challenges. Good luck!!
---
I love it that god has to grind seasons just like the rest of us mortals.
---
I’m working on getting them to 3 right now. Getting Iron Clad to 3 also but might max it out at 5. Idk. Gonna get bloody mess to 3
---
Shhhh! You’ll anger the 🐢
---
Unfortunately it doesn’t use diluted one😞
---
Can’t wait for some sort of change it’s all too stagnant atm
---
You said it much better than I did :)
---
That’s Darwinism mate
---
you could argue that them showing, lacking enough knowledge about synths and the institute, immediately jumping to the conclusion that they need to annihilate it without any consideration to the people who live in boston (i mean they are ok with nuking CiT, they dont give a fuck about human life that isnt a part of their ranks) 
---
they dont *know* that synths will destroy humanity, but it makes for good rhetoric to rally the troops and justify what in past would be war crimes. their willingness to go to extreme lengths in wars with things they dont understand you could say makes the brotherhood a very dangerous organization. their lack of willingness to understand some technology and reconnoiter and research an enemy and their rigidity to their "ideals" creates an environment where "the ends justify the means" can be taken too far.
---
the idea that they can "stop potentially dangerous technology" is contentious at best, and fallout 4 does a pretty ok job of exploring that. although some people are just attracted to the big robot and laser beans and dont really examine the faction or its implications. they shoot muties so they *must* be the good guys right?
---
Yo we heard you like sacs in your sack so we make a knapsack you can keep sacs in.
---
Or a sac-sophone.
---
Yep. I think dumping all my holos and notes is next on my to-do list. I've just kinda... let them grow organically.
---
This right here. It’s a visual glitch. Hadn’t known about ffr weapons but all guns I use have ffr so that makes sense
---
Yep. I'm already down to minimum weapons and armour. I think it's the misc/holos that are doing it to me.
---
Yeah it's easy to do lol. Just don't dump any games ya have lol. Also I've been able to sell the notes from the insult bot "you have been insulted" and the "your a dumbass" note for a few thousand caps a few times now. Some people have nothing better to do than pay for one of those notes to leave it at a base they don't like or in someone's junk that drops after they kill them lol.
---
Wow. I love this so much. This is they way i think how the whole community imagine ammo converter should work. Simple and efficient. I hope Bethesda will see this and make rework in the future
---
It costs perk coins to remove a legendary perk card from an active slot. I think it's 2 perk coins?
---
The new balance changes aren't ready yet they're releasing it
---
there is gauss rifle, the dragon, and if u want a faster firing non automatic sniper rifle i recommend the lever action rifle
---
yes, but actually no. they cost 1 perk card coin to remove a card, slapping one on is free though
---
Mmmm yesss 76 upvotes
---
what lining?
---
It should have been for a new hardcore game mode for Adventure like Survival was, sans the PvP aspect. Greater risks, tougher enemies.  I don't like the idea of enemies always scaling near you, but I guess I'll have to see if they have accounted for all the potential problems.
---
But more importantly, hopefully they have a better rebalance plan with how things are going to change.
---
bro just open one and 7/10 you'll start a train with others opening theirs, you dont have to throw all yours. Personally I love seeing low levels at events, I admire their spirit and reward is being able to witness the inevitable consequences of said spirit, ie a never ending spiral of death
---
I hope they make us purge mutations, renounce the Enclave and not participate in Meat Week. Otherwise they KoS 😂
---
The point is there’s no point in playing anything other than bloodied because it’s overpowered. OP isn’t saying nerf bloodied, they’re saying buff everything else so it could be on par with it. Since there’s not reason to experiment there’s no build diversity
---
So I'm hearing you want it in the atomic shop for 20k atoms
---
Interesting. It certainly does for me even though I don't want it. Could be related to having diluted and regular ones in your inventory, or perhaps in which order you acquired them.
---
I’d rather imagine that people are too stoned to pay attention than too stupid to read.
---
And the funny part is that doesn't happen if you die after the A Colossal Problem event completes. I was able to find my junk bag and the flux was in there lol.
---
I removed all turrets from my camp and I haven't been attacked in probably the last 20-30 hours I've played. When I had 5 missile turrets, I was attacked like every hour. I know there's no actual evidence, but I read about people removing turrets and hardly getting attacked.
---
Hmm death by diabetes
---
Hope the Moo-gang doesn’t see this...
---
Either way, he is far too busy to run around to all of our vending machines to collect the taxes. Maybe that’s what the QA department is doing.
---
Mmmmmmm.....reloading....
---
All the weapon plans lost their value after christmas
---
I wish I was able to give some of the bullion or notes to other players. It’d make trading interesting. 
---
*Or hell, I could give it to my other characters to eliminate one of the grinds.*
---
congrats! and welcome to [The Club](https://youtu.be/RyghfZC-pf4)
---
Its really not that bad, you can solo the rooms now and bear arm plan can drop from partial success
---
That being said the event is long AF and requires you to focus unlike other events which you can basically sleep and wait for other players to beat it.
---
I think the event length is the main turn off.
---
Still can't find anyone selling the mods for it...
---
I might be able to get on in like 30 minutes or so. My gamertag is "H Mad dog 2000"
---
I used to spam that event but I haven't fo in over a month
---
You be quiet. This makes way too much sense.
---
I'm still saving for the 2k for jetpack plan. I should have it in 5 days. I hope they don't patch it before then, but judging by Beth's record I think I'll be fine...
---
It works, kinda. It adds 500 shots. Problem is, a regular reload only adds 1000 max, so if you have power user or overcharged cores, a regular reload won't work (you will eject a partial core cause the counter will go to 0).
---
However, when you unequip and epuip power user perk, it will load both the extra 500 from double and anything extra from an overcharge. But there are two problems still :
---
* when you shuffle the power user perk, the game will actually pick another random core from your inventory
---
* there's some funky tracking going on and sometimes the game will deplete a mag even though the core has like 800-900 shots left from
---
Additionally, a new bug was introduced with last patch that automatically loads partially a depleted core when you empty the current clip (just cancel the reload animation by holstering the weapon). That's how I clean up my "backlog" of ultracite fusion cores. And the double effect will still add a nice 50% of the base capacity of whatever is there (a bit hard to explain better).
---
So it's a giant headache with double and overcharged cores. Maybe one day they'll fix it so that a regular reload loads the expected 1750 shots on a double gatling laser with power user and 125% charged cores... 500 base, 500 double, 500 from power user, 250 from the extra 25% (normally 125, but that goes to 250 with power user).
---
If you mess around with it, you can get those 1750 shots loaded (your 999 counter won't go down for a long time), but right now it's not worth the hassle...
---
Then it shouldn't go live UNTIL THEY FINISH IT!
---
May be wrong but i'm pretty sure PS4 has the largest player base, maybe Xbox now because of game pass but yes PS4 is still very active
---
Yes indeed... With my line of work I would like a boost to the Hunters legendary effect. Instead of doing 2k damage to radchickens I need to be doing around 5k damage to radchickens. The playerbase has no idea how many times Ive saved the Wasteland from a eggy apocalypse. While you kids are out killing your "Earl Williams"  Im the one actually taking care of the real colossal problem. I fight the unseen fight to keep you all safe.
---
You are thinking of Lode Baring: seems like 90% of the veins are not functional.  
---
Breach and Clear is the automated underground mining machine you empty while fighting mole men.
---
Yup, this nerf is hitting everyone and will be one of the worst things to happen!
---
damn...
---
Very few based on having plan. Fixer, tenderizer, bear arm, sheep squatch club, and staff so not much help in not getting a golf club or pipe pistol
---
I finally tried the Alien Blaster the other day.  Fuck me was it underwhelming  took 3 shots till a level 9.....
---
yep.  all day
---
Look for a map of the new random encounter spawns. If you can narrow it down to the places that have a large tent then your golden. Just keep trying thise spots over and over till she pops up.
---
gives you quests. best one is to find a weapon. you can delete his item if he gives you a different quest and then put it back until he gives you the right one
---
he is an ally that if you build his radio he will come to your camp and give a few quests.  You can only have one ally ata a time.
---
You got your wish, now hopefully  they will do the same for the helmet
---
o yeah i play everyday and servera are full.
---
Ah ok. I wish they had made it so that you could roll for a particular weapon rather than just a random one
---
Only daily ops, not all enemies!
---
Just keep leveling and moving points around. And picking new cards. That’s what I did
---
Yes but you don't see the damage on the floating number. Your weapons do more damage (someone tested by comparing remaining enemy health bar length with and without the perk)
---
Harder because no power levelling.
---
Yeah I would just keep leveling up and move points around and pick perks u want
---
Thanks!
---
I'd say keep going on current character.. But that's just me 😁👍
---
Haha, awesome. I need this for my ever growing collection of vocal sacs.
---
Thanks for responding! Also should i go for the wastelanders expansion or is the regular one just fine?
---

My hero I just started collecting outfits last week
---
Congrats. I finally got mine a week or so back at the Rusy Pick. Coincidentally that was also when I got a Bloodied Fixer from when turning in scrip. Probably my luckiest day ever playing the game.
---
OP is litterally asking for other prefixes to be buffed to be the same as bloodied just because its "meta"
---
there would be even less build variety if you could just get the same damage as bloodied without having to run at low heath. all of the damage, none of the risk.
---
Shielded lining is the best.
---
The game includes all updates since it's an online game, other editions of the game just throw in a few cosmetics
---
wastelanders is free.  it will auto download when you get regular game
---
Not quite there but definitely oner 1k
---
Definitely, because I am 100% certain any of you weener bois who care about junk will be even more trash at this game than the scrap I just stole. Ez Fun
---
Nice, my bloodied commando took him out in 6 minutes!
---
Wastelanders was a free update. You can only play with wastelanders, there is no going back. Also yes, PS4 is still very active.
---
Yeah it is fun reloading that weapon lol it's alot quicker with the firework glitch atm, seriously going to miss that when it's patched ☹
---
There wasn't any
---
Oh okay thanks!
---
I once saw Grahm destroy a player vending machine I was using and then he fled into the woods.
---
Oh lol didnt know that. Thanks!
---
Oh i see. Thanks for responding!
---
Yeah i have the dragon but really slow at reloading, gets me into trouble as i cant put a silencer on it, where would i get the gauss and lever action rifles. Thanx
---
Yeah keep going, you'll have more levels than you know what to do with eventually
---
Yep, this... this right here.
---
I used herbivore while carnivore and it did nothing at all. I obly had the effect in pip boy for 1 hour and then nothing
---
Sorry, you're right. Thanks for the correction!
---
Wait... you kill chickens?
---
*angry guard noises in the distance*
---
Doesn’t bother me much, I’m not a build that relies on buff multipliers, so it doesn’t change a lot for me.
---
A lot of us do log in every day and still have a ton of notes. After meat week I have 800+ now and I haven't missed a day since finishing the questline.
---
As a bloody build with very high luck (on all 3 of my alts) I get these frequently. I am not saying it’s easy, but I get them enough I have a small stack on all my alts.
---
Plus daily operations give contextual ammo.
---
Good spot.
---
lmao, love the loading text also lol
---
I was taking a Fallo-break during Halloween so I hope it does come back. It sounds like a lot of fun.
---
The guy that gave you a shotgun could've been me, i did exactly what you described a while ago for a low level player. If so, i'm glad i made an impact and you enjoy the game!
---
"It just works!"
---
If I remember correctly, it should be canon or at least heavily implied at, that the majority of nuclear bombs in use during the War had little power but were extremely dirty to compensate, since fusion hadn't been made practical until a handful of years before the war, uranium was the primary energy source for most of the US, due to the dwindling supplies of oil.
---
Big nukes were only used for targets of extreme relevance, such as the Glow in California, which was THE West-Tek facility, and the Glowing Sea in Boston, which despite not having an equally important facility in the crater itself, was still home to a number of strategic targets.
---
From what I've read, you might've been #9 to join and got a new instance.   Explains why you didn't even see the nuker
---
My fav mods for Fallout 3 and NV was one that added seperate equipable cosmetic pieces that went over armor and outfits!
---
Trick question; it was always a good time to get the game.
---
I've been playing on PS4 since Beta and the servers are typically always populated. You shouldn't have any issues finding other players.
---
I run 4 totally different bloody builds. It doesn’t make me an expert by any means, but bloody is all about damage avoidance and damage output, not tanking damage. Let your armor do it’s job. With a full unyielding set and all your strength,agility and luck stats automatically increased, avoiding damage without being a tank is really easy. IMO I’d put those five points into something else that’s going to boost your damage output like better crits, sneak attacks, glow sights, tenderizer, adrenaline, etc. If you’re using a power fist, especially a bloody swing speed one, you’re gonna see the damage points double, maybe triple, depends on your set up.
---
Not gonna tell you how to play the game though. Just wantin to be helpful. For some really good bloody setups check out Angry Turtle on YouTube. 👍
---
[I keep a BSS+strength power fist on my shotgunner for fun and for when I don’t feel like shooting, and without any melee cards equipped it’s hitting at average of 2,000 damage points... I might be including sneak crits power attacks with that average, but it can shoulder tap a mire lurk queen and a behemoth, double tap a sheepsquatch]
---
Remember that sneaking isn't viable for new daily ops and the enemies hit hard so goodluck with 0 dr and no sneak
---
Much better compared to release, more focused towards multiplayer play imo, but single player play is always and option and still fun
---
Kick name take ass
---
Season 2 starts soon
---
It's going to be total shit.
---
Endgame events shouldn't be easy for casuals.
---
Your user name is one of the best I've seen.
---
Interesting. You don't actually get the rewards in the PTS, because they're mostly tied to the Atomic Shop which is disabled.
---
So i got about 150 hours to go till i get one XD i try it every time i see one...no luck
---
My girlfriend got 5 cakes on 5 tries in a row XD
---
It doesn’t matter at the end, it’s just different flavours of the same
---
If it's you, i really thank you for your intervention. I have used shotgun for like 10 level after this and it was great fun
---
in all seriousness. there was always story content. Just because there wasn't a physical npc doesn't mean there wasn't any npcs. if there were no NPCs why did the game have a massive voice cast at launch? Some of the holotape recordings are phenomenal. First class voice acting. The Into the mystery quest line is the best quest line in the game and one of my fave side quests in any game ever and there's not a single NPC involved. It's all terminal entries and holotapes and visual stuff. 
---
You can play by yourself but you get bonuses for being in a public team. You don't have to do anything with the people in your team. Just be in one.
---
Yes, it's a good time. You'll be joining right at the start of Season 2. Lots going on in game. Two major quest lines to follow. More on the horizon. Brotherhood of Steel returning to Appalachia soon.
---
And this game has the best community of any online game I've ever played. Join us.
---
The entire map will be worth exploring. I'm tired of visiting the same 5 places.
---
That’s awesome!
---
Funny you mention it. I went to see if I could get one of the rare asylum outfits right after this. 
---
And actually found the yellow one. Not the most rare, I know. But new to the collection non the less
---
I liked the game with the quests, the story. It was nice. But when I finished all of those, the game became rather boring. I did Season 1, but it just becomes a choir. It felt like World of Warcraft repetitivity all over again. Get your daily gold bouilons for 20 tickets. Do your dailies for the factions. It doesn’t feel like there is much more to do in the game. And now they have seasons. Which seems to be the main filler for end game.
---
Was it a level 5 one-star legendary shotgun?
---
That's right - Raider punk is more bearable.
---
Sneak is so hard to maintain in a group.
---
Sadly prefer solo on those builds. Half tempted to dust off non sneak heavy in public.
---
Sweet thanks for the info ☺️👍🏻
---
Yeah after messing with it I see what you're saying.
---
Exactly!
---
I can’t walk past one without trying lol.
---
Your girlfriend should go buy a lottery ticket or something haha.
---
It will scale to your level. If you’re a new player just leaving the vault, the enemies will scale down. If you’re level 300 running through the forest, that same level 3 enemy for the new player will be scaled to your level for you.
---
Complain and freeload
---
It seems like there's been an uptick in a-holes recently. I don't know what it is, or even if it's just a matter of me getting "lucky."
---
I never PvP because I hate it, but claiming workshops open you up to it. Just in the past few days, I've had people - either individual high-levels or teams - come in, kill me if I'm there, trash my workshop, and then leave. Hell, the one time, at Sunshine Meadows, I followed the example of another player I saw and put up a sign that said "FREE RESOURCES" to let players know that the resource extractors were unlocked and they were welcome to whatever was there.
---
I get that there are going to be griefers and general a-holes anywhere online (I've been online since before there was a World Wide Web), but this perceived uptick in 76 is disappointing. Maybe/hopefully, as I said above, it's just bad luck and it'll go back to normal for me soon.
---
They don't replace each other, I tried to go carnivore by drinking a serum thinking it would do just that but instead nothing happened.
---
Well I was kind of speaking generally but if the guy was gestering to you then you know what to do!
---
Wow that’s bad luck lol
---
I’ve had to respec my character like 3 times now, granted not anything too drastic. I would still do that 20 more times than restarting a new character. It just takes so long to grind plans and currency with the RNG. If I had like 2 or 3 weeks totally cleared of life I would gladly start a new character the way I would like to, but as far as online games go this ones a grind for that
---
It is annoying when this happens on a public server. No screws, no Earl loot, no fun had. You do at least get some rewards.
---
Yeah she also gets all the good legendary guns. Lucky for me she doesnt use them so she give em to me. Like all my good guns are from her XD
---
Kerwood mine is ok for me for a long time, what I hate when this quest sends me to Crimson Prospect, one of the targets always spawns below ground.
---
True.
---
I have so much shit I don't need and can't sell right away, I just give things away to passerbys. My only complaint is inconsiderate jerks one shotting legendaries but should be fixed soon with the one Wasteland update hopefully. I hope BGS implements some kind of texting feature in the pipboy in the future.
---
This game is so against PvP that stealing loot shouldn't even be a thing.
---
So true XD
---
Thank you! This is exactly how it should be and what most people expected! Please Bethesda, do it like this.
---
I think you should give up the weed.
---
I've been looking forward to One Wasteland ever since it was announced.
---
That’s a good question actually. 
---
I can only assume that each try has its own chance. So in theory you could just keep trying the same one. But I wouldn’t know for sure
---
I feel for you, my friend:
---

CANCEL GRAHM!
---
just wanted to say that i think this situation is quite cool.
---
thats exactly what i was hoping to see when they anounced a multiplayer fallout game
---
that beeing said, i cant help you but i wish you good luck in your search for mercenaries 👍🏼
---
Hahah so you have the RNG of 2 players at once. Love that XD
---
Lmaaoooo that's great.
---
You pranksters you... Lollll seriously tho I like it
---
It appears and lower and the right of where you set it? Its happened to me too, I have a theory that its when you click "Confirm" after selecting a location, the nuke always seems to end up in line with where the confirm button was.
---
Bethesda, please lower the budget cost of turrets!
---
If I open my map and see players near Vault 76 I always make an effort to try to fast travel there and give them things. Its hilarious to see people who are still figuring out the controls of the game and aren't sure if I'm a real person or an NPC. I highly recommend that everybody try it!
---
Are you taking advantage of the random encounters locations to grind extra beyond the daily’s?
---
No, I don't. Also, I don't do daily everyday as sometimes there's too much work and no time to open the game.
---
I’m dreading one wasteland, I built my base in the forest where it wouldn’t get destroyed and now all the level 6 enemies in the area is going to be level 100. So the already worthless turrets are going to be even more worthless somehow. I’m going to have to use my best gun and ammo everywhere I go and all the weapons I carry that I’m not spec’d in will become useless. So more ammo farming. (Which is bad and a time waster. I wanna play the goddamn game not run around collecting tin can traps because luck hole mine STILL hasn’t respawned yet.)
---
They’d better lower the cost of turrets and add more camp budget if they’re going to do this.
---
(Why do turrets cost so much anyways? I would assume it’s to keep players from placing a million of them but we’re limited on the amount we can place anyways so that’s pointless to make them cost so much.)
---
I always collect ore but I'll be honest with you. I've had people get on mic to tell others to collect it and then not do it themselves and that makes me not want to collect or deposit anything out of spite.
---
Not gonna lie your comment got me hyped up lol sounds great
---
Yeah that's exactly what it seems like it's doing, it's hella frustrating after like the 10th time it happens and just makes doing Silo Runs tedious.
---
I would buy arms or legs first as you can make two pieces per plan and they cost less gold.
---
Arms, then legs, then torso, then under armour.
---
After that you can buy two mods for each piece.
---
Unless you really need a jetpack straight away.
---
I understand that, the issue is going to be higher level players collecting junk while xp farming. Leaving none for the newer players that need it.
---
Gets headaches from radio chatter and drops grumpers. 🤙
---
Same. I've completed the event with everyone alive and 100 ore probably 20 times and still don't have that plan. Pretty sure I've never seen anyone selling it either. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've only seen it built in one camp.
---
That sounds like exactly what happened. It happens mostly at path to enlightenment and the campfire event. Thank you!
---
I'm looking forward for the exp. I can pretty much 1 shot with me pump shotgun but it eats my shells but with the new ammo drop thing will be very helpful to combat this but until them it will be annoying. They should releases them together
---
Oh, I got ya. Sorry, I misunderstood your comment
---
You will have to try the market place, they are rarer but people do still have then up for trade. Alternatively you could put up a post asking for someone to mod it for you. I regularly mod peoples weapons for free or with a small junk donation. Most people won't even charge you if you do the traveling and provide the materials
---
May side hoe sloth rip
---
Oh shit....
---
Tons of fun I'm hooked
---
Yeah, it's a risk asking people to mod for you when you have a god roll on the weapon though.
---
Ha no worries. Its certainly going to be an interesting week when it drops. Hopefully Bethesda dont fuck it up too much.
---
Yeah the cards you can use in NW are dependent on what your character uses in adventure. So if you wanted a specific build then a new character would be best. I play NW for fun so I take whatever perk cards I find and just use a fairly standard set of cards
---
Depends on how much time ya got, with meat week coming up theres a potential for a butt ton of exp...could level up a new char to 50 in no time
---
Cranberry relish
---
Do that unless you acutely kill the creatures. I defend  with the others. I can hold down 1 side by my self while 2 take the other. So can any others PLEASE COLLECT ORE!
---
The trading forum has its own karma ranking separate from reddit, most people have spent along time getting their karma up so you should be safe with high karma players. I've done 200+ trades and not yet had a problem. I'm not saying it doesn't happen but it is very rare.
---
Apparently. 
---
Poor design IMO. They should allow people to claim on the 1 week downtime
---
Oh, sorry that doesn't help. Good luck.
---
Unless you're in my team it's not my job to nursemaid you. I prob won't even loot it unless it's 3 star. Also you might want to want to lay off the weed for a bit as you def have anger issues.
---
We desperately need that.
---
No, but one of the reward slots will give you one of these three things:
---
1. Caps
---
2. Scrip
---
3. Raw gold bullion
---
We're you at a water treatment plant? (Thanks what it looks like,can't think of the actual name) Only place I can think of off hand that has liberators and a door that can only be opened from a terminal inside. I don't know if you realised yet but you have to find a way in to get to the terminal to open the door and get out that door. Not sure why the game would kick you out of a building you can walk into. Sounds like the game was just loading slowly and you ran through a door before it loaded in
---
I bought the Lever Action plan from the Camden Park vendor bot (Lever Gun I think it’s called)
---
Gauss Rifle not 100% sure but I think I’ve seen Grahm sell it.
---
I personally think we should get the overseer holotape holder as a camp item to display them in vault tech themed camps
---
What you miss from this video and the title, is that this can only be done in private solo,just like a single player.
---
In public there's always mr PA chimpanzee aggroing everything and the queen underground.
---
On the bright side, when you do actually manage to deplete a core, the game will autoload a half empty one when the reload animation starts. Just cancel the reload and continue shooting... That's how I clean up my half empty ultracite fusion cores in inventory.
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Collectron\_station](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Collectron_station)
---
Soon  will be an update that if a level 300 and a level 30 team up, the enemy will appear level 300 for first player and the level 30 will see a level 30 to be more fair and fun
---
i like armor piercing on my shotguns, thats the only thing i really care about
---
Are you dumb stupid or dumb, huh?
---
Yeah but if I called it casual team right now people would be correcting me saying noone uses those teams. Its lose, lose right now
---
and a snazzy wig like her hairdo !
---
Honestly, I wouldn’t mind so much if everyone was better at protecting the scavengers. One of the three yesterday they were all dead before I’d hit the third cavern.
---
So like September 15th?
---
amen to that !  if I'd known that was the result I'd have worked SO had to accomplish it sooner ...
---
Don't forget herbivore mutation to double cranberry relish xp buff to 20%
---
Here's a picture of what I'm trying to achieve.  
---
 https://imgur.com/KgEboD6
---
Depends almost all trap bases I've gone to are all players 200+, while vendor shopping yesterday a lvl 36 dropped some fusion cores for me (lvl155) as he saw me in power armor.
---
700 treasure note holder as well, i'm thankful they don't weigh
---
Or even if other people show up they all sit in only one habitat. One time i joined the event with 5 people in one habitat. So i went into another because i can easily complete one habitat on my own and all of a sudden all of them came to me. Like wtf?
---
All someone needs to do is find a way to turn it into a something that benefits the player and they'll hot fix it with-in 24 hours. If it's something that negatively effects the player they'll take their time getting a fix for it if at all.
---
i carry copies on the holotape advertisment, which i keep  meaning to give to new players as they emerge from the vault (in conjunction with a weapon, i mean.  I'm not a soulless bastard)
---
But the total mag size while using a 100% core without power user is still 500 on a double gat laser. 
---
Are you saying the double only applies when you mess with power user?
---
It's how Fallout 4 worked. Bethesda went out of their way to change the settlement system because they thought that their single player RPG fans would be head over heels in love with PVP. Pete Hines is enjoying his disappointment over that crazy idea.
---
Did you make this up or are you getting it from somewhere? It does sound like the kind of morally gray choices Bethesda likes.
---
like most "rewards" in Fo76, almost never.  they are about as satisfying as first-time awkward sex with the rather homely girl next door, but without the uncomfortable eye contact that continues until you grow up and move away
---
My "raider" is also a cannibal, but feeds on only raiders and scorched. Best way to view it is he is like Krieg from Borderlands in a sense. A bit mental, but well-meaning. Course my outfit screams "Mad Max". It is the treasure hunter outfit, Piper's road goggles, and the raider pathfinder mask, with my character's base model looking like Kellogg from Fallout 4.
---
The cores are really charred and the presidential suite is ready, just inaccessible, but the rest is just an idea
---
They said this was fixed a year ago. If it ever was fixed,  it immediately broke again,  as usual.
---
At a bare minimum, this is how it should work in Private Worlds to incentivize Fallout 1st subscriptions. And it could easily be made to work in Adventure Mode by instancing the workshops.
---
yeah, no kidding : /
---
Aye. i wanted to save the scrip for the sale. but i've claimed it now.
---
What exactly are you talking about? Leveled weapons? That's not a problem after level 50. Or are you talking about the way they've rebalanced the game several times so that OP weapons have changed several times?
---
Sadly, I’m on Xbox - so my search continues, lol!
---
I mean, more xp is good, but i don't want to meet level 200 assaultrons
---
You might have Orbital weapons, but all it takes is one explosive in the right spot to take out your radar dish, then you just have a psychotic robot. Also, we do have a weather machine (at least if we can get it up and running).
---
I wish you good luck then, the drop rate is not bad at all, so eventually you will get all the plans.
---
"or something" LOL !!!
---
yep, it must be profound, whatever the hell the point was !
---
U had me at first, but ur condescending last statement made me not care
---
I think the ship have sailed on Ammo Converter. They already "fixed" it on their minds. Doesn't matter that 98% of the players don't use it.
---
At a bare minimum, this is how it should work in Private Worlds to incentivize Fallout 1st subscriptions. And it could easily be made to work in Adventure Mode by instancing the workshops. And the only people who get the current non-instanced version that we have now are those who flag for PvP.
---
i too have wondered what it would take to get her pants off ...
---
Xbox ?
---
Are there updates to the game often?
---
You just need one with faster swing speed. It doesn’t even have to be decent or maxed level.
---
i should have said "#metoo have wondered" ... sorry for any politically incorrectness
---
I hate when i see power armor users that just camp and kill ghouls. At least get 25 ores dude, at least
---
AA or junkie explosive, even better if u could a magic shotgun.
---
What's ur armor...that helps too
---
Also just make the bullion machine slider just max out at 20. I’m sick of having to slide it down from like 5,000 or whatever.
---
Modus lost a lot of his cored when the Enclave revolted. His remaining cores could last him hundreds of years still.
---
well, she IS hotter than Eugene, my current gf
---
Ps4 is bumping my friend! Patches occur usually every month to month and a half
---
Gt ChiefSmakAm0
---
oh thank god ... now i know I'm not a pervert !  or, at least I'm not alone ...
---
Whay have you got?
---
Every couple weeks, they're consistent with it at least. Bear in mind although updates are sort of frequent, they do tend to break things sometimes(ie: cause issues). Think of it as an ongoing beta test(an online version of Fallout 4 for lack of a better comparison). It is a fun game, but not without issues.
---
Click on the broken robot in the pit below the big vault door and also other Holotapes around the bunker and you might begin to understand why modus is damaged....
---
Yes, it was some kind of treatment plant. I did figure out later that there are other ways to get in, so I get your point about the game not kicking me out. I was surprised though that I could simply walk in through THAT locked door. Maybe I'm not as desensitized to bugs as others, haha.
---
This isn’t a bartering sub. Try the other ones. DM sent.
---
The damage is the result of General Santiago's men blowing him up during their revolt against Eckhart in 2086. They thought destroying MODUS would prevent the Enclave from causing further harm to Appalachia after they unleashed the Scorchbeasts and Liberators. They detonated a bomb in MODUS' core, which destroyed part of his personality and most of his memories. The now homicidal AI then killed every member of the Enclave by exposing them to a toxin and sealing the bunker.
---
In the almost 20 years since then he and his robots have been slowly repairing the damage. If anything, we can probably expect MODUS to be his old self sooner or later.
---
My many characters are roughly split equally male/female. I'm no radical feminist but I've always chosen regardless of gender. It's just a game and I don't identify with a bunch of pixels as much as others perhaps.
---
That said, I won't lie that some of them are easier on the eye than others though.
---
Lots of 3 star furious and instigating ballistic and melee
---
&gt; Then it shouldn't go live UNTIL THEY FINISH IT! 
---
Umm... yeah. Though, also this whole game since B.E.T.A...
---
I wouldn't either
---
love the way Chad claims all the other robots in the park are crazy, or the robots at Foundation refer to reach other :  commonality as a form of uniqueness
---
\#1Instigating
---
\#2 Junkies
---
\#3 AA
---
\#4 Vampire
---
Carry one of each. BTW, Most shotgun builds are bloodied, because bloodied shotguns are really powerful (though not as much as they were early on).
---
Yep. Gave up playing it in the last few weeks, there's not even an indicator of how long you'll have to wait or how full the queue for lobby is. Mode is dead on PC.
---
It’s really not that hard. Collect something, defend a creature, kill the alpha. The collect only affects how much hp the creature in the defend stage has... my friends and I usually 3 or 4 man it but I also use a shishkabob with friendly fire perk so I sacrifice my xp gain to keep the creatures alive. 
---
Once you’ve done it once or twice, you get the pattern down pretty easily. It helps if you have more people, but it can be done with 3.
---
Same. It’s most likely an intentionally cringey comment, intended to be a sarcastic observation on rampant consumerism.
---
I was only adding INT buffs. Though after putting the Well Rested buff I started adding xp info but deleted it. Cranberry relish + herbivore gives 20%. 
---
Get Green Thumb perk and farm Cranberries at Mac's Farm (kill a Mirelurk Queen 1st), then gather Snaptail from the creek starting at Landview Lighthouse to Mama Dulce's and make sugar. Grow gourds at your CAMP and convert dirty water to boiled water.
---
In one farming run I can get 15 relish made and in a cooler + Good With Salt they last almost a week buffing 20% xp (25 with Well Rested and 30 with Mothman buff).
---
Thank Todd they don’t have weight.
---
Ammo will most likely be a non issue once OW lands, legendary perks arrive and contextual ammo drops are implemented. I can even keep my LMG fed easily when I play on the PTS. 
---
Personally, I can't wait for OW. I'm getting sick and tired of finding 3\* enemies that actually drop a 3\* item, and a decent one at that, only to realize that it was a fucking level 25 mob or something. Scripped a JE FR .50 today. Level 35. At max level that would have been one hell of a roll. Pretty much the same for the AA FFR Gatling, level 40. Shit like that being a thing of the past is the main reason I can't wait for OW.
---
The inevitable damage tuning pass, however, needs to follow suit soon. The damage changes really did a number on some weapons and builds.
---
Get out there and play. It's a blast!
---
Each floor level above ground needs to be attached to some stairs, so you’ll need a foundation half a level down somewhere to attach stairs to
---
Nuka Cola Dispensers, but the same complaint
---
This is exactly what I thought it would be when it first came out.
---
Bethesda please!
---
"We got everything you want, honey, we know the names"
---
I seem to only get that daily quest rarely now too.  Maybe once a week or so? But no matter how many times I do it, it won't show completed in the challenges.
---
I hope you have a ps4 pro. This game doesn't really play well on the base machines.
---
unless they advertise a shop and put it behind locked doors, or a nail board ... 'cuz then it's bar-b-q time !
---
People will start skiing it again for the xp at the start of next season ,  if you haven't done it before maybe familiarize yourself with a guide.
---
the fact that Bethesda didn’t fix it yet amazes me
---
The blast radius we see in game is actually rather close to how it would pan out in reality due to Fallout nukes being low yield.
---
In the FO universe, your average nuke has a yield between 200 and 750 kilotons.

The blast radius for a 750KT nuke dropped on Charleston would look like this.

If you can, do the Feral Dog Horde event in the north west. Three possible low level legendary drops every time, plus the XP. Also make sure to join teams every time you play (via the social tab on the map). I’d suggest a Building Team because that gives you bonus intelligence which means to quicker XP level ups. Event Teams work, too. 
---
Basically enjoy yourself, take your time, work your way through the main quest and explore the world. Lots of stuff to do.
---
Brilliant thank you, yeah just had look on google there pretty much says what you said, plus apparently i can buy the guass rifle plan from modus, so ill pop there and see if hes got it. Cheers man.👍
---
Hmm... So I tried again. They must have broken it more in one of the patches...
---
You're right, double doesn't do anything, at all. Messing with power user only allows you to load the overcharge into the mag now.
---
I doubt they will ever fix this, since double is a legacy prefix...
---
I might get the fancy duds, but otherwise special points all the way.
---
Mine happened at 60 yesterday lol, only took 6 tries
---
condescending statement ?  not my intention, which ever statement that might gave been
---
it’s sub dedicated to f76 what do you think people going to say?
---
DOOM theme, Bethesda would'nt even have to pay for it
---
Ye I know that but I can't seem to get it right.. because it needs to be just a little bit lower than how it is now because of build height limit orso. But I will try your method.
---
Use the concrete ramp piece to get exactly half a floor level
---
You might have mispelt Plasma Caster
---
Ye I'm gonna try that. Thx
---
I don't want her grey merkin hair covered suit thanks! 😁
---
Sorry bud, this is just not that game.
---
What’s ur gt I’d join up w/ y’all I’m trying the get the puncturing and heavy bear arm mods
---
I'm not a fan. This is going to make it harder to level my lowbie toons. No more runs through West Tek, etc, with my boyfriend's high level character to level my lowbies up.
---
It got a chuckle out of me, so I'll upvote you back to 0.  Though I bet I get downvoted for saying so.
---
I find that buying the recipe for the Formula P that I never use is better than waiting for a slot machine to give me the recipe I never use.
---
No more power leveling lowbie characters though. :(
---
How is it different from playing on regular ps4?
---
/agree as simply participating in the game garners more treasury notes than can be spent daily, it makes no sense having the current limit
---
I think what he’s getting at is, if you find a weapon with the perks you like and you use that weapon, say like a level 20 fixer. 
---
By player level 25-30, that weapons no longer viable. So you have to move onto an inferior weapon that’s higher level just so you stay competitive with damage output.
---
You then have to try and get hold of your ideal weapon at level 50+ again to keep your build going and being competitive. 
---
I think he’s trying to say there should be some way of levelling weapons up.
---
Unfortunately yes.
---
Junkies have become very highly sought
---
Instigating is the best prefix, in my opinion, with AA close behind.  Somehow it just feels right for an enemy to drop from one shotgun blast. 
---
For secondary, I suggest faster fire rate or bonus vats hit chance. For tertiary, crit fill, faster reload, lower vats cost are all good options.
---
Change that fixer to 38 receiver go to town and change it back
---
I've been playing solo since launch. I don't team up. And i'm not affraid to engage other players. Its still fun tbh
---
If you want something more practical, try the Fixer with a semiauto receiver. Everything with higher per shot damage than it falls woefully short due to it's fire rate. You can get the plan for it from Encryptid, and it shares mods with combat rifles so it's really easy to mod. Plus, it makes you a little more stealthy even with crafted versions.
---
Hasn't meat week already passed?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you click to buy it, it gives the full description and still allows you to back out.  Though that can be costly dangerous if you double-tap.
---
Bloodied is still going to be the highest damaging and one of the other main perks is its pairing with unyielding armor, its still going to be the best gear for most builds.
---
For now, you’ll want to run with “magic” effects, which works wonders on shotguns — https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs .
---
Try ultracite 308 mate. It is way faster to make. Also  SPOILER ALERT&gt;^(&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;New upcoming legendary perk maxed giving a lot of more ammo  which will also work with super duper and ammo smith will solve that problem&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;)
---
That does seem like what he was *trying* to say.
---
Thanks so much.   Will try this the next time I'm in there.
---
No, they can't. This prevents scammers.
---
Junkies or Furious I would think.  Then anti armor.
---
Anti armor effects still multiply so....
---
I’ve seen Yao Guai ghouls twice now at Pylon V-13/Abandoned Bog Town. 👍🏻
---
Yeah mine are popping up randomly after days of none
---
Yes UNY is awesome. I was always high health Vanguard's with Instigating rifleman build. I liked staying alive and one shotting almost everything. Well now I'm bloodied commando, still stay alive, still one shot almost everything except now I can take out a Scorchbeast in 2 seconds. I love it!
---
The amount of times I’ve tried to recreate something even remotely close to as cool as this is ridiculous, great job man. I love it, I’m jealous of it and I look forward to seeing what else you come up with!
---
Interesting but as others have pointed out, the cores didn't expire, they were damaged. It makes at least as much sense as banging a knife on a rock to summon a god, which is to say it makes as much sense as anything Bethesda would come up with.
---
not a problem ??? as is often the case, I'm lost. I'm not an expert (that's why i come here : to learn from all of you who know the nuts and bolts of the game)
---
weapons cap at 50, if that's what you mean, and legendary is the only escape for me - until i figure out a good card build for the my new blodied smegma caster and pistol, neither of which appeals to me
---
being level ~150 and wanting to use, say, a radium rifle - that's the problem.  if such a player wanted to use that weapon they would need to stick to the forest or use a very powerful scope
---
if you'll excuse me now, i need to work on a clearer snarky parallel reference to consumer culture
---
Yeah, still, repairing MODUS could be part of the future
---
I've been using a bloodied 10mm for everything except the queen. Not even using pistol perks aside from gun runner. It's a lot of fun.
---
Technically strangle heart is a ultracite skin
---
It may be fragile egos in some cases.   However, it irks me from a sense of injustice.   I should spend 100's or 1000's of my rounds while that player contributes.....  zero?   Yeah, not carrying people who deliberately do nothing.
---
But you're right:   the SBQ method would work in many cases.
---
Killed the hermit crab, flatwoods monster, and fireflies. Not registering in any challenges.
---
semper in rectam !  (which is nothing like it sounds, but rather "always correct", my leatherneck friend)
---
I just remember that it was a long barrel one with 300 ammunitions. It was not far from the airport
---
We all do my friend we all do..
---
Endgame events shouldn't be easy for anyone. They should provide a strong challenge that tests your build, skill and possibly also teamwork.
---
He’s perhaps the sanest person / entity in Appalachia.
---
RNG is deeply rooted in the way the world works. To speak otherwise is the greatest heresy.
---
All kidding aside it's a standard RPG mechanic. If you want something simpler it's out there. To quote Harrison Ford, this ain't that kind of movie.
---
Thanks man! Ive been doing just that so far!
---
Take your pick from any spot somebody says they found her, and get ready to server hop a LOT. She has no fixed spawn point, your options for forcing her to spawn are limited to server hopping or fast traveling and server hopping is free.
---
 
---
FWIW, I found her at a tent between the Crosshair and Clancy Manor.
---
I know dude, it does feel like RNG is against us in this game. 
---
That’s why I just take to the market sub and eventually buy what I want.
---
I guess people trying to lower Karma with the down down, lol.
---
 That fight would last less than 10 seconds if you used the ultimate weapon: the War Drum 🥳
---
Grinded about 7000 and having to spend them at an incredibly slow rate has just killed the game for me. Its sad.
---
From my experience the game runs fine on the base console.
---
Only frame issues I noticed are on public events when Teslas were used or lots of ash/meat piles stock up
---
Radium rifles are great in the right context. It seems like you're not considering some of the game mechanics as part of the challenge and this is leading to frustration.
---
Just because you have a hammer doesn't make everything a nail.
---
correct.  sorry i did such a bad job of expressing myself.  if weapons were adjusted to the players level rather than stopping at fifty, for example
---
as you mentioned the fixer (great example), not all weapon plans are always available, and in any event they are not able to advance with the player beyond 50
---
other than joke value, can't understand the wiffle bat and commie wacker ...
---
Me too.  I think they should make a good bullion bought autoloader thing that takes the grenade slot and uses that bugged code.
---
I never use grenades anyway and that would be a sweet alternative.
---
It’s too intimidating for most players. I’m a level 300 and I always do the event, and people always join after I’m there
---
He calls you tiger because that's how Bethesda thinks people talk if they're fucking.
---
So having three items with the effect is the same as having action boy maxed?
---
I kept reading that if you take out turrets, attacks are rare.  I didn't believe it, but I moved my camp to a new location last week.  I was concerned because every time I visit the new location before the move, I encountered several enemies.  But I decided that I'd build without using turrets as a test.  It's been over a week now and surprisingly, I've only encountered enemy attacks once - a group of cave crickets (one was a \*\*\* legendary! which I was excited about).  They only took out part of the Collectron pod.
---
So maybe there is some truth to turrets causing frequent enemy spawns.   It's only been a week, so we shall see.
---
The fact the cap is 5000 hurts as well. You can't even buy a full set of T-65 at once. Needing to piece together a set of power armor, and the bare essential mods for it, over the course of two weeks does not instill me with a sense of pride and accomplishment. It actually just pisses me off. If I was able to save enough bullion and do it all at once I would have.
---
Silly fact: 'soloe'd on my own' is a tautology, aka the opposite of an oxymoron 😏
---
My base is in the forest too and although my new build is only lvl 60, i don't want lvl 60 liberators attacking my base, ive met high lvl liberators before and they fucked up my lvl 200.  I imagine even if you had a mix of rocket, machine gun or heavy laser, half a dozen lvl 60 liberators might screw at least half of your turrets if your lucky...
---
I don't know the exact names on mine, but I have a three star combat shotgun that two shots and increases damage with consecutive hits on the same target. I think the third star is extra limb damage. I also have one shotgun Perk card maxed for additional damage and a hardened receiver and stinging MAG (plus silenced since I'm stealth)
---
I thought about adding in the other two Perk cards and maxing those, but honestly, this thing does enough damage now without needing them.
---
I still couldn't find the exact damage showing on the pipboy. I use a Quad FF handmade, long scope, stinging mag, and suppressor. No meds or foods. I do have covert maxed, 1 star in adrenaline, plus mutations. The damage on pipboy shows 55 currently.
---
I save my lower weapons for new characters and give them out. 
---
I have a level 10 perfect storm that I got off a vendor, I hand that down like a family heirloom along with a set of hooked up lvl15 raider PA.
---
The bow is a paint skin, you need to actually have a bow to apply it to 🙂
---
Some guys just don't get it. Good try though.
---
Ad Victoriem.
---
The bow you claimed is a paint.
---
correct - if i were saying that i should drop a king mirelurk with a radium rifle, i would be nuts
---
but even basic scorched and ordinary mirelurks are quiclky too high a level for most 'basic' weapons to be practical
---
I am just outside Watoga by the rail yard and I don't even have turrets.   
---
Just build some concrete walls, seems most monsters will stop destroying stuff after breaking a number of items. The concrete barriers that break in sections and lit up posters normally keep 'em busy until they leave.
---
It's a skin for a bow, not an actual bow.
---
I don't think the enemies scale up that far. From what I've heard level 100 are the highest people have seen on the PTS.
---
Bad enough.
---
Well usually if no one does it I start doing it, cause I don't care lol but that always leads to their death
---
I'll only do it if I have friends playing. Every time I do it with randoms it fails
---
as always, I'm probably not understanding things you have all known for years ... like the correct perk set for each situation
---
this has been my point. Yeah it's taking a hit but it's still gonna do wayyyyy more than any other build. Seen a commando bloodied still hitting sheepsquatch for 162 very fast on the pts. still OP
---
The flatwoods bow?
---
Its a skin, meaning that u have to apply it to a bow in a weapon workbench.
---
Yeah if only more people were like this! Fallout community is great overall. This guy went out of his way to help and its very much appreciated!
---
I've had that happen but if you go to the quest-giver it'll work. This is a nearly daily occurrence with me for stings and things.
---
lol - "heresy"
---
There will be a "second helping" of meat week from Sept 22-28
---
I still fear assaultrons, especially the invisible ones since i run a magic shotgun that requires VATS to kill
---
Thanks! How about the rest of the items like the ghillie suit is that also a skin and not an outfit?
---
So, do I go to the computer for queen of the hunt? How do I get the core-recycling to activate? I tried going to the computer at the RR and it did not do anything.
---
and the present (trade) emote really doesn't express the
---
 " hay new person im trying to give you stuff stop running away from me and take this so i can get on with my game... its been 20 minutes of me chasing you trying to give you stuff already ! " ( exaggeration ofc )
---
i wish they would use a mechanic like hunter/hunted radio to LFG for events like this. like: hey, i’m interested, but only if there’s enough people to make it worthwhile.
---
I had that happen with my low level. He was level 50. I got on mike and told them it's my 3rd character and my other 2 are 210 and 300. Then asked him if he needed anything. I ended up giving him a vampires explosive combat rifle lol.
---
Also, thank you for the suggestions!
---
Yup. Just a skin.
---
This sounds awesome, and the “football” would be way nicer than having to go through a silo every time. Just for good measure: u/LadyDevann u/Valseek
---
There is some joy in shared misery. LOL
---
If you make 30 notes a day, which isn't hard if you do events, and can only spend 20 you're permanently in a case of N+10 where N is the number of days you play.
---
I am currently sitting on ~1k notes. I _could_ just log in turn them in and do nothing else, but then I would be missing out on the following:
---
Dailies for SCORE which have you do events
---
Dailies for faction rep
---
Any other events you stumble across during your playthrough. 
---
Which not being able to play the game without having more than you can turn in is just asinine. Why am I being punished for playing the game? Same goes for scrip and caps.
---
All the armors are skins. Power armor are skins. Outfits need to be crafted. Camp items need to be built. Weapons are skins.
---
you want stuff that doesn't affect your build too much. So if you're melee avoid addictions that affect STR. 
---
list here [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Addiction)
---
i keep thinking of a better future where mankind can kill mutants in a more fun way ... what will future generations have to put up with ?
---
btw - do you know of such a game ?  outside of PS2-era titles i cant think of any
---
He is not talking about ammo.
---
If u on PC:try to use the mouse only to set the point and then confirm with your "USEKEY"
---
I actually like the idea of progressing in a game and outgrowing gear I get early on.
---
Emergency Protocols is like one of the rarest drops from the SBQ event.  Good luck getting that plan.  Had to trade for it on FO76 Marketplace.
---
What do you exactly mean? Are you asking if the explosive perk is going to break your stealth when you fire? Or are you asking if the silencer will remove the explosive perk entirely?
---
I haven’t tested it myself but I don’t think using a silenced explosive weapon will effect your stealth, and it remains explosive even if you equip a suppressor
---
are you sure ?  it isn:t smegma caster ?  I'll double check later, but will take your word until then 🤡 &lt;- me irl
---
16 times the bugs
---
The former. Will the explosive perk break your stealth.
---
Game: ACTIVATE THE PYLONS
---
The guy with 50 stimpacks: No, I think the low level will
---
Does vats hit chance really matter on a shotgun? you’ll already be pretty close to your enemies while using a shotgun
---
I don't get it all either, but an observation is that this game is all about specialization. If you want to play casual you can play casual. If you want to be the avatar of destruction scourging the land you're going to need whiskey, blight soup, psychotats, a bobblehead, health at 20%, fire rate over 180... you know, technical bullshit.
---
sometimes it's easier just to die a lot
---
You’re a legend
---
Oh okay, well don’t take my word for it because I didn’t test it myself but I doubt explosive is going to have an effect on stealth. Because the explosion comes from the bullet itself, not from the weapon. Firing an explosive weapon, silenced or not, doesn’t make it louder or anything.
---
with respect to advancing and getting newer things your are satisfied with, yes.  maybe i just want energy weapons to be more powerful, and ballistic weapons to stay relevant in a "not just a backup singer" kind of way
---
Happy to help.
---
why bother doing that when they could put it in the atom store and you idiots would buy it?
---
I use bloodied explosive fixer as my main gun. With a silencer of course.
---
There IS explosive effect. My sneak does not break when I'm firing.
---
Those oscillating fans only turn so much - they don't turn the full 360 degrees.  I assume you make the turrets out of their mechanism.
---
That part I understand but the sound itself from the explosion I figured could break the stealth.
---
I can kill him in about a minute. I'll do that on my private server. I'll wait till near the end on a public to do it if it looks like it's going to fail. That being said I did it the other night and there was me and 2 level 60s there. I was farming hoards and they were complaining in area chat that I wasn't helping them kill him. Like calling me useless and other names. I waited till they both died at the same time and were waiting for the respawn timer and wiped him out. Neither completed the event because I heard them swearing. I nicely said I helped them kill him are you happy now.
---
little said it wasn't just a video of the Ammo press in the Pitt DLC
---
Thanks for the info guys!
---
If you don’t like the game, why are you forcing yourself to play. You already said you plan on quitting, so clearly you aren’t giving it a “fair shake”.  This post has troll written all over it.
---
Dang that's awesome. That's all I needed to know. Thanks!!
---
I like the idea of a bullion purchase. Even if it is not unlimited and just another 800 pounds strictly for scrap would be worth it.
---
Ballistic weapons are relevant. What are you talking about? I explicitly use rifleman.
---
I just want the pants so I can get gawked at
---
Well depends on what weps you wanna use, I honestly think commando is S tier, that or shotguns, you'd wanna get the commando perk card, if you come across the frog legs perk card that is realllly useful, any damage resist perk cards, and tank killer if you can get it.
---
Then why would I pay for FO1st?
---
Not going to happen even tho I agree it should be free
---
The mistake is either immature or ignorant at this point. Good luck
---
Lunchboxes, fireworks, repair kits might be the only actual items that go into your inventory. Money things like scrip, gold bullion, caps also go to your character. Atoms go to your account.
---
Everything else is skins/paint/camp items.
---
I could be missing a few things.
---
&gt;However, it irks me from a sense of injustice.
---
This was exactly my point. What injustice? You lose nothing. 
---
If there was a fixed loot pool &amp; they got a share making your share lower, sure, I'd agree. However that's just not the case. They take nothing from you. 
---
&gt;I should spend my rounds while that player contributes.....
---
Again, if that person wasn't there, you'd spend the exactly the same amount of ammo to get exactly the same reward.
---
If that person wasn't in the area/never existed, they were there but you never noticed it or there are there and you noticed, in all three cases you get the same reward. However, it's only the last scenario where you're pissed off.
---
Let me put it another way to make it crystal clear how obsurd this "sense of justice" is. 
---
Say you enter an event area just as it's about to end and you get the event rewards even though you didn't do anything. Does your sense of justice demand that you destroy all loot you got in such way that you don't benefit from something you never "earned"? I mean that's the just thing to do, right?
---
I don’t like the idea of some people being able to pay for it while others can earn it. Either everyone should have or no one. Even the current system for whatever reason seems better to me since I can try and convince myself it’s a service people are buying. Paying to skip a grind does not sit well with me.
---
There are several ghillie suit paint jobs for different types of armor, depending how far you make it on the board. I think leather is the first one.
---
well observed.  my training was not to die.  until ordered to do so
---
I'm not asking for Fo76 to be more stealth (Wich would also be fun) but to be able to play without relying on so much deep technical knowledge of perks - not that Fo76 should change for me !
---
example : yesterday i learned that i don't need armor crafting perk active to extend durability, but i DO need the weapon crafting perk active - for the same reason - but with weapons
---
other than not playing and reading here on Reddit, how would i know that ?
---
Bloodied. Even with the nerf it’s still the build with most modifiers. However I thing they will fix that in future updates
---
Honestly I’m unsure, I can’t help you much since I never ran stealth. 
---
But your question got me curious lol, now I also want to know if explosions expose your cover or not 
---
But I don’t think it makes much sense if explosive weapons expose your location since the sound’s source is coming from the target you’re shooting at and not from the place you’re firing at. If anything, I think it would just alert the enemies and put your character in the “cautious” state instead of “hidden” and I don’t know if that effects the extra stealth damage
---
\- Grind all events in Savage D.   
---
\- dropchance for that loot is the same as the Callibratet Shocks from the qween ;)
---
\*i got my from Violent Night
---
FO1st has a unlimited the f2p one don’t need to be unlimited just a separate box
---
Not everyone is an English major...
---
my apologies for my ignorant AND immature sense of humor if it offended.  thank you for your reply
---
you obviously know more that i do
---
I'm not, I had to Google it 😏
---
The scrap box is the main reason many fo1st subscribers purchased the subscription, I don’t think Bethesda will ever bring it out of the subscription. 
---
With that being said, I really wish if they would. I’m not a fo1st subscriber and If they ever decided to sell it in the atom shop or as an actual money DLC I would instantly buy it regardless of cost
---
\+100500
---
Pistol build funny and effective if you know how to play
---
 btw - the reference to stealth was a generic "insert something Fo76 is NOT here" place keeper.  sorry if i caused any confusion
---
I've seen this too...frustrating.
---
Someone answered the question in this thread. Lol
---
depends on the other stars imo.  TS in general can be unprecise but you can use formula P to make up for it
---
If they do as you proposed then the FO1 scrap box should be adjusted to store anything on display or for sale......
---
If you use vats, then yes. It definitely helps. And IIRC, it’s one of the current ‘magic’ effects.
---
you dont need that much junk. bulk and sell it, and stop picking up what you dont need.
---
Yeah, definitely, I expected someone to just walk up to me with their X-01 power armour and just laser me down with a laser minigun, what really happened is that he had scavenger power armour we waved at each other and he left the area
---
I just saw it, well my assumption was right then lol
---
Ik but like 80% of it is like lead steel screws acid and other very useful junk
---
Between the Ammo Factory Legendary Perk and the contextual ammo drop system, you'll be swimming in ammo.
---
No you don’t just stand still you move around? If one person is drastically jumping and you’re drastically jumping you gotta account for your own jumps too.
---
True that lol
---
Bloody mess is a necessary card.
---
Psychobuff mainly. The list in the pip boy of effects takes away the bobblehead. I tried several times stacking booze on top too and it doesn't work. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
---
Oh man that’s a great idea! Thanks for the tip. :)
---
if its useful why do you have so much of it? if you arent using it, its just dead weight. if you dont want to bulk and sell, then use it. regardless, stop picking up junk if you have plenty of it.
---
On average like 5ish idk I don’t keep track lol
---
How does it make me feel? Nothing really. Unarmed or stealth commando. Not really impressive to me.
---
“Simple and efficient” are bad words over at Bethesda.
---
The wookies will complain tok much because they miss out on all the timer xp. It's why they killed the last small map/shorter timer mod they made for NW last time.
---
I have psychobuff but I’ve never used it with a bobblehead. I have used berry mentats with bobbleheads and haven’t had that problem though. Good to know.
---
But enough to comment about your indifference though
---
As I said, 6 cards that can be scrapped so 12 bonus perk coins.
---
I like to loot everything, so the auto open part of the perk (on the PTS I ranked it up a level so it auto opened both 0 and 1 level locks) is pretty nice under heavy fire like during Daily Ops. No need to be vulnerable during the minigame.
---
Also you're perk slots are available for new characters. If you're running new character it means you get all lockpick/hacking availability straight from the get go, even before the regular lockpick or hacker cards are available.
---
Its very bad situation i hate these toxic players. But how can somebody join u unless u enter the silo as a group leader.
---
No, it's basically an upgrade for the hazmat suit.
---
There is a glitch to create the munitions factory machine on your camp. This will make your experience way smoother. Search on YouTube there are several videos on how to do it.
---
No, you won’t get banned for that. I have 20 of those machines on my camp
---
People will downvote because they don’t like exploits but it’s really worth doing even more for new players
---
btw, for anyone reading this, when i take my shotgun in to see Earll it is not too harm Earl but to use it as it was meant to be used - a close quarters weapon.  not needing to be as important as a heavy gunner (what i think of as the star of that show) i try to keep adds off the stars and play support - in keeping with that weapon's characteristics
---
I never succeeded in Fallout 4 either.  Nice.
---
Oh so as an unyielding user I should probably not buy it?
---
AND I THOUGHT GRAHM WAS A NICE PERSON, FUNDLESTICK THAT GREEN BOOGER
---
It must be the strength cap or something. I see my carry capacity drop back down when I take something which should be increasing it.
---
You can purchase lego effects? Can you please shed some man re light in this? You can build your own 3* dream gun?
---
There are level floors and ceilings. You'll see level 50s in the Forest and 75s and 100s in the Bog.
---
Lots of people demand zero risk high reward legendaries, such as high health and high damage weapons, high health big SPECIAL buffs. They call it the opposite of bloodied and unyielding, because bloodied is so easy to maintain with all the extra benefits. Full health is more life-threatening so it deserves even higher buff.
---
Like hazmat but has a high DR and ER too. I see a lot of people who just use that
---
Both should do, depends on how weak is your character right now. If you can keep going, then keep going. Remember this will impact your legendary perks in the future by wasting points around.
---
If you need help with bloodied builds I have a guide
---
I feel like people are too busy struggling to constantly keep their food and water up tbh lol
---
Yes you're right. I died a couple of times after killing the SBQ.
---
And an "are you sure" you want to convert this ammo.
---
Add in /u/Vaultboyx and his in and outloading screens and we've got a Todd Howard Approved^TM product.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
I just wish there was a way to craft ultracite version of ammo using the already made base rounds.
---
Yep
---
Keep trying.  People will join you.   
---
My experience is that the event usually goes undone, but if I show up (to xp farm) half the time some others join.
---
It just works popup everytime you convert with ok button...
---
Good
---
I was answering the question.
---
Still only a 28.8% dmg bump. May be equal to junkies post patch but I doubt it will overtake bloodied.
---
I wonder why they used such a convoluted system for this mechanic. It's utterly silly to use. I end up just dropping ammo instead of using the converter.
---
Well if you didn't get yours for free from the settlers than I'd wait until you get everything else you want first. It is worth having one around, but not the most important thing to be spending gold on.
---
DER DERK A DERR!!
---
That's not the point of the post. Don't worry, I'm not trolling anyone, I know how much this community loves this game. Thought it might be helpful to tell people about this, but I guess not.
---
By the way, there is plenty to like about the game as an MMO. It's the technical aspect I have a problem with, which is why I am playing: to see if the bugs kill the enjoyment entirely or if I can get over them.
---
This mass nerf is just the beginning, more nerfs (adjustments) are on the way after this is in place.
---
Just trying to share some useful info! Just keep in mind this doesn’t work every time, but it’s always worth a try.
---
I’m two handed melee and tend to do the most damage when I run the event. However I also did the most so...
---
Just do a side by side comparison of damage. I ended up with furious.
---
I would be surprised if it did as well mainly due to the huge benefits of running unyielding armor. 
---
This said AA has no downsides at all and is even more useful on harder tankier enemies, just where it needs to be. Junkies is nice, but it’s the ongoing cost of chems necessary to max the build that is its biggest problem - I don’t think any other build is as hard to maintain.
---
Just don't attempt to slightly reposition it later :)
---
We need to see your build to help you maximize it's effectiveness.
---
Ultracite gatling actually. It did pretty well against Earle and I had no perks active, so I think I may have found my holy grail.
---
Run a junky heavy build. Don’t bother with taking chems. You Just choose what addiction negatives to live with.
---
I was messing with you. I’ve read that you have to relocate your camp.
---
Fill it out and paste the link here after!
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Depends on what your play style is gonna be my dude. Rifles? Heavy weapons? Melee? Sneaky? Etc
---
if u enter a sillo there is no option to enter as Leader or Solo!
---
Same! Missed a few events, so super pumped for all the upcoming ones
---
I forgot about T65.  I like this too. Thanks!
---
Rewards are account based. You're better off making a NW specific character, instead of trying to shoehorn builds into your main.
---
This is a great idea! If it was implemented I think that they could change the animation to your character putting the ammo into the ammo converter and have the terminal be removed.
---
Yea the only one that’s does is plasma cores at 3-1 ultras. When I first started priming my other weapons I thought they all did this. Lol
---
I guess this is still a thing? I'm on PS4 and cannot progress any further. Same as most everyone here. I got the fuse and ghoul sample. Came back. Replaced the fuse. Put the sample in the centrifuge and went to analyze and it said I need to i seet the sample. Only I do t have the sample any longer. I logged out,  came back in. It gave 2 objectives: analyze sample and replace fuse. So this time I did the sample 1st. Still saying no sample found. I'm seeing threads going back like a month and this still is the fixed?
---
Have my upvote!
---
The Suppressor carries over to the explosives as well.
---
First thing you should do is to enable displaying the damage that you deal. It is in options.
---
Then Earl would start showing nice numbers floating around him every time you hit him.
---
With that enabled, retry your tests. Basically, stealth commandos manage to kill Earl in solo, making around 100 damage per regular hit and around 200 on critical. All this without being detected.
---
I've been downvoted for saying it before, but *buying* a rare drop will always be superior to grinding endlessly for it. You're guaranteed to get the thing you want, right there on the spot.
---
You know, people laugh at me when I say I'm always broke and how it's always such a struggle to make caps. But I have to assume these people just simply never spend their caps on anything.  
---
Well I spend mine, it's how I've gotten 90% of the rare stuff I've attained.
---
I do understand how it works - it’s just
---
not maxed though without also taking the chems. A decent analogy would be running a bloodied build above 20% health.
---
I appreciate the comparative figures btw. I presume though that AA should really have a range of benefit depending on the amount of armor
---
😂😂🤣😂🤣😂, my apologies!
---
Bloodied &gt; Junkies = AA = Furious &gt; TS
---
Bloodied is still number 1. Bonus dmg is still better than any other option and unyielding is king. 
---
Junkies is next in line dmg wise but AA is so close they might as well be equal. About an 8% difference in dmg. Considering addictions AA might be better other than on no armor high health mobs. 
---
Furious is fourth because it will yield similar results to Junkies and AA but take a but takes some bit of time to ramp up and resets after a miss. Still, on a heavy weapon the ramp up time is miniscule so it is a preference choice rather than a mechanical difference in dmg choice. 
---
TS is still last because of the accuracy issues. If both shots hit it’s very similar to the rest of the non bloodied pack of effects.
---
we can only dream &lt;/3
---
I'm the guy who equips a shotgun, sniper, black powder pistol, automatic and a laser rifle sometimes a crossbow or bow to not waste supplies yet on more ammo. I randomly choose my approaches in the moment and so far I've been doing well
---
I play on a base PS4 and my game runs great
---
Even running half hp with 1 uny piece negates the effects of addictions
---
This, choose a playstyle and stick to it, strength builds have abit of variety as you have melee, heavy and shotguns under it however they also very much vary in the other special perks that are beneficial to them.
---
Perception is focused on semi, automatic weapons and bows and agility is pistols.
---
 If you want to use VATS alot of perks in luck will offer some benefit. Do you want to have mutations then class freak and starched genes would be worth picking up in luck as well.
---
AA had reminiscing returns because you hit a max dmg cap of 99% of theoretical dmg. Thus on a no/low armor mob you will not get anything from AA.
---
Does the build details matter that much when the vats bullet doesnt hit due to server lag?
---
I guess it could be more perfect, I dont have perfect mods and I lack one more point into luck and crit perks, but all in all its just a standard penetration automatic combat rifle build in vats. I do not target head because I felt I already was lacking range, so I just target the torso.
---
Alcohol, daddy-o, daytripper , mentats + paycho is my choice on a commando
---
ok I fill it now
---
Works like hazmat suit with added DR, so you won’t get one-slap killed if detected. The biggest benefit is its stealth, you remain invisible while moving as long as crouched.
---
VATs broke after Wastelanders dropped. First it stopped working in PvP, and now it's struggling to work in PvE. So it may not be your build as much as it is VATs being broken af.
---
I run a full health junkies build. very tanky. I've been having great success with a junkies MMG eith +40% swing speed. I two hit wendigo spawn and stay under Earle and just shred him.
---
Well... I *think* I know what do, but it *feels* like I don't.  I know how to gather the stuff to get higher level animals but if I'm the only one gathering it I never seem to be able to max it out.  And I know how to defend a creature in a glorified escort mission but if I'm alone I sometimes get overwhelmed, especially if the creature isn't max level.  What am I doing wrong?
---
Lead looses most of it's weight when converted to ammo.
---
Hehe no worries, I wasn't saying OP was wrong, just messing around with grammar stuff, bored and redditing 😋 Enjoy your Sunday 👍
---
I'm not a big fan of it at all. 
---
I don't have a min maxed build with god roll weapons, I struggle even with some Bog mobs now as they are. I work, so I can't get on all the time, and when i do, sometimes I want to visit the low level areas with a fun, silly weapon to loot junk and not worry about dying all the time. 
---
I think this update will force people into using the same one or two overpowered builds and discourage variety.
---
Stealth commando is the most powerful build in the game, and one of the few builds where VATS works as intended with it. I'm not asking because I want to make fun of your build or tell you to "get gud" or some dumb shit like that.. We can help point you in the direction you need to go.
---
Alachol?
---
When 99% of the game is incredibly simple loot-and-shoot, then suddenly you throw in a PP or Encryptid, the learning curve is always going to be an issue.  Without overhauling the entire game there isn't really a solution other than dumbing down the event, which wouldn't go over well either.
---
Don’t know what reminiscing means but I think we’re in agreement.....that the benefit of AA depends on the amount of armor and so a range of percentage benefit is more appropriate
---
I used to keep my vending machine stocked with .308, but I evolved to a heavy gunner build, so I keep it for my lmg.
---
I only have 1 in Perception, so the Commando perk is only 1 star, not maxed. 10-15% would drop the pipboy damage from 55 to 46-49. That's a big drop!
---
Awesome!  Love Mad Max so it's hard to say if you would be intimidating to me at first or not.  Can you see the goggles through the mask because that probably looks cool? But I do have to say it disturbs me to see the cannibal trait used...but I bet it saves on food space and spoiling.  Good thing you were inoculated since you're eating scorched!
---
Well it works fine for my bloodied commando build.
---
Yeah I tried everything unfortunately, and never get any replies from Bethesda. I have to wait until they patch it. I could start over but it would be so lame to just run into the bug again after doing all the starting stuff.
---
Thx. Autocorrect on my phone is a bitch.
---
What platform?
---
Here it is, not too perfect since i had to grind so much new stuff compared to my old build, but it should suck that much I thought.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f745f9&amp;d=sa0pg2po2pi2ph2pp2ek1ej4c62cr0ic3ii0a72am2ao0a32a04lt2lv0lk0l21l11
---
pc :/
---
I don't quite follow.  Anyone on the server can enter while you are in there.  If I see a lower level player that has been in the silo for like an hour straight I will sometimes stop by to see if they want help or pointers on what is giving them trouble.  Silos aren't instanced.
---
At your level that is certainly possible to use different weapons that way. At higher levels/endgame it will be really tough to kill stuff when changing between so many weapons.
---
You're only allotted so many SPECIAL points, which is what ends up boosting your damage for certain weapons, so it's best to focus one weapon type. Dont get me wrong, you can run multiple weapon types, but dont be surprised if you have issues killing stuff/BLOWING through ammo later on.
---
=0 How about some tips to help out?
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
When you level up you can put a point in a special stat and pick an available card BUT you don't have to pick a card in that special. So you can put a point in STR but then when it comes to picking a card you can cycle through and pick one from INT or LCK or any of them. When you hit 50 you can move a point or pick a specific card every level up so don't panic if you mess up your build.
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets) stahs your junk. SCRAP THEN STASH!
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds.

---
and remember to HAVE FUN!
---
Stealth is great for Earle. Shoot and move. Stay crouched. Target the screaming head and crit him.
---
Yeah, PvE wise, VATs usually works for my junkie's commando build. Usually, but not always. And I've found some guns (like the Railway Rifle) to be more effective in VATs than others.
---
with these bonus 150 atoms sometimes its free speed up. i finished already. just 2 days left. Nice to knwo they doubled score rewards:)
---
Faster movement speed while aiming
---
Damage increased after each consecutive hit on the same target
---
+10% damage while aiming
---
Base damage with my build: 97
---
Shoots an additional projectile
---
+1 Perception
---
Base damage with my build: 135
---
I only have 1 Formula P
---
yeah thanks. I really hoped automatic would work because I struggle focus sometimes and I play with controller, so I didnt want to do the focus limb part but I guess thats the way to go, I just have to learn it. I did crafted the chinese armor.
---
Omg thank you so much this helped more than you know :))))))
---
Hello! I'm on PC. I can be on after 8 PM est tonight and take you through some leveling runs if you'd like. (i.e, carry you through high level areas and make sure you get shots in so when I kill the enemies you also get the exp.)
---
Ah ok, sorry, I’m Xbox
---
Ah yeah, I know my build not perfect, but sometimes it didnt hit at all and was 95% and I just shot all my bullets and nothing happen. The swap to next target also took a 1-2 sec delay because server didnt register the enemy died or something.
---
It's hard to tell. I went to WestTek and each Super Mutant showed inconsistent damage.
---
Excavator is sop teir power armor.
---
You’re not doing anything wrong, just haven’t able to solo defend an animal that’s all. Once you get the right gear you’ll more likely able to.
---
It’s the people who clog into one room and ignore the other animals that are infuriating.
---
Can’t blame the new players playing safe though.
---
Thanks for the help :) do you have discord?
---
I was running a Two shot Plasma Gatling for a while and got a Furious Plasma Gatling in a drop... I now run the Furious. It absolutely melts everything... and I'm a full health build with PA.
---
Thanks for responding anyway:)
---
Yeah. Server delay is a bitch. I've also had it not hit even though I'm at 95%.
---
Bethesda doesn't support the stacked punji camps though, there seems to be some confusion on this. The "feature" or any mention of them have been the more interesting camps(often games or something funny). Punji camps aren't creative or interesting in addition to being griefy. They've patched them twice and will likely patch them again in the near future.
---
I do. I'll DM my Discord deets to you.
---
Join a public event team for xp bonus
---
Alright, should I pick one weapon to use at all times or still keep the other weapons around to bring with for back up or hold multiple of the same like an automatic 5.56 rifle and a automatic 10mm for example
---
They must have because 240 hours in, I have 4 of them in a display case and I can't say I've tried 100 times.
---
No, it's not.  Ot has to be magic to be... magic.
---
Also later on say I have perked and chosen the main weapon type, all of a sudden I'd like to bring a different weapon type to use for a small bit is that a waste of time or still worthwhile as it's fun to use the different guns out there
---
Not magic, like you said it needs one of the 1st or 2nd legendary prefixes.
---
I inadvertently started a war between a nuclear keycard escort, scorchbeast, and 2 glowing anglers at my home once.
---
All these XP bonuses people have mentioned already, then repeatedly clean out/server hop West Tek and do the Radiation Rumble and Uranium Fever events whenever they pop up.
---
Cons: it a vendor interface and so now we get ammo duping again.
---
Ahhh I was under the impression that if it had over 200 fr it was
---
Scrip it is! Haha
---
I feel like someone picking up your dropped loot isn't toxic.  It's part of the game.
---
Keep in mind, as long as you're having a good time, that's the way to play. 
---
Personally, I'm a bloodied (stats increase as my health decreases) fist melee build. My perks are chosen aroud doing melee damage, no other types. But I do carry a 5.56 rifle so I can smoke lower level stuff from a distance.
---
Hey! That’s weird you’re not doing a lot of damage, you have all the right perks for commando. One thing I would change is take inspirational perk out of charisma and replace it with tenderizer, it’ll help do more damage.
---
Considering there will be Ammo Factory legendary perk, you shouldn't need to use that much more ammo then you think, getting more XP per kill and highest level legendary drops, and it'll make exploring anywhere as an end game player feel worthwhile......I'm absolutely looking forward to One Wasteland.
---
Lol I'm a smol level 23 who joins in my raider power armour spamming all my guns and stims to stay and do what little I can to gain, ty to all those high levels who revive me after I get mobbed by the wendigos I was shooting at to get it's attention away from the said high level player who is only concerned of the earl. I'm helping haha
---
Ranking up levels is only 150 atoms, and rank 100 gives you 500 atoms. So if you are near a reward you want, buy a few levels.
---
Ive heard there are 10 levels worth of atoms given on the board if you complete it.
---
I wasnt going to finish but be close, so wound up buying 5 levels a couple days ago and finished yesterday. So i guess i could have bought a couple less, but bow no stress.
---
a new map
---
Because it's really difficult to do when nobody is coordinated and so it fails
---
Also, quite often if you place it somewhere in the open, then move it where you want it without storing it it suddenly fits.
---
You're pretty much gunna end up using one weapon the majority of the time so you want to be correctly specced to make sure that one weapon does as much damage as you can do. With the upcoming changes to enemies level scaling, using a second weapon that your not specced into is just going to be like using a water pistol to damage high levels enemies.
---
I am your therapist are you okay have not heard from you in a while Mr. NotAtAllDepressed
---
Bloodied has so many buffs it's ridiculous while having no real downsides. It's been broken for ages and something needs to be done to make other builds equally viable.
---
The weapons don't even need to be over 200 fr for the magic to happen, the higher fire rate helps but I've seen it work for weapons with 160 as well.
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once
---
The BOS power armor paint jobs can only be obtained by doing the quest Forbidden Knowledge “ or of another player is selling it and you buy it from them. 
---
The quest has a very small chance of rewarding you one of the paint jobs. 
---
I’m not sure if this is 100% accurate, but some people said if you “read” the plan, unless it’s the very first level (initiate) it will prevent you from receiving the other paint jobs.  Knight,paladin,elder. 
---
So I still haven’t read mine.
---
Uh?
---
Thanks majorly! Currently taking a break from 76 as I needed a breather after the Legendary Run, but I’ll be back :)
---
Yeah, but i mean like...like the T-60 skins. you would think the BOS would have skins like that for the ultracite skin. Same with the T-51B
---
I meant -die- the most
---
I had that initial concern coming into 76 as well but it’s overall a great community.
---
I used to oneshot the level 75 vendigos with my shotgun, which was just a 2 star with additional projectile. And now I hit them with all my magazine and lucky if I kill one of them.
---
Thank U. I m not an english man
---
After level 50 you can either move SPECIAL points, or choose a new perk. You're allowed to save up the levels. So if down the line you want to change it up a bit, it isnt that hard to do. If you want to do a major change, like going from melee to rifles, you'd have to save up quite a few levels to change things around. 
---
I had to save up some 30-40 levels to change my build up recently.
---
Yeah. learn them in order or mess up the drops.
---
Do you ever dabble into other weapon types for your personal want to use it and if so how would you go about it.
---
I will focus on either rifles or single fire pistols I'll decide when I play next. Can I also bring a melee weapon, would you ever do that or waste of space? How many weapons do you personally carry.
---
What type and level is the rifle? Is it fully-modded (automatic receiver included)?
---
Does a broken stealth suit not protect against rads anymore?
---
I was going to say. Played GTA online after playing fallout 76 and saw the obvious contrast. On the bright side, let gta have all the trolls😎
---
And yet we will never see it because Bethesda XD
---
Agreed. I wasn’t annoyed about the junk. I was annoyed about how I spent my time and ammo just for some random to come in and steal my nuke.
---
I do not need a scrapbox.. speak for yourself
---
Where did he send it vs where did you want to?
---
Honestly agreed in full
---
You're in a not bad place with the build at all. I would suggest getting rid of Ground Pounder and replace with Concentrated Fire, and replacing Gun-Fu with Covert Operative. Also I'd replace Evasive with Sneak.
---
The fire rate helps. I saw a vid that said a piece of armor with 15 DR while blocking will cause the “magic” bug too, but I have a VFFR gat laser that won’t trigger when I am wearing that piece. On the other hand I have an AA limb damage LMG that melts things without the 200 fire rate. Just have to test them out.
---
All good, I hope i didn't sound like I was being a dick about it!l, I was just messing around! Enjoy your victory, and have a great weekend 🙂
---
He hit Earle. I was going to do SBQ.
---
I don't know if people ever managed to dupe from Mmmmmmrgh or from NPC sellers, but that's a good concern.
---
I'm down
---
My neon lights confirm this a thousand times.
---
My main character is heavy weapons and I pretty much only use two heavy weapons depending on what I'm fighting. One for normal enemies where I can conserve ammo and one for bosses where I don't mind using extra ammo for extra damage.
---
You can resped after lvl 50 so nothing is ever set in stone. I would probably say it's only worth bringing a melee weapon if your Strength Special is leveled up since that ties directly to melee damage as well as the perk cards under it.
---
Your VATS issue is a bug with VATS.
---
Sometimes, when you first enter VATS, if you fire off the shot quickly, it'll hit, but if you delay shooting that first shot, it will always miss. (I get this alot with a lever action rifle).
---
You can normally correct if you exit VATS and quickly re-enter, then VATS works as normal.
---
As for the ammo counter showing rounds but you can't shoot. You need to reload.
---
For me, it's a visual bug and you actually fired off all your rounds, but for some reason, the display shows rounds even though you really did fire them all. This only seems to occur with automatic weapons.
---
Example: 
---
SBQ fight last night, I was firing a minigun. Fired off all 500rounds, and immediately after hitting zero rounds, it shot up to seventy-somthing rounds left, then auto reloaded.
---
I have this happen on my automatic combat rifle as well, will unload 25 rounds, and after hitting zero, it jumps up to 7.
---
One thing I noticed in your VATS Commando build, you don't have concentrated fire.
---
Yeah, that sucks man.
---
I think it should be a setting. You could turn on lootgrabber pvp and then when they grab your loot they will be notified that they are now in pvp with you. I think it should stay anonymous in order to promote good vs. evil decisions on whether to pick up the items or not. Then if you had no intentions of going back for it you could hover over the loot on the map and release it.
---
I read here once that two-shot, for weapons where you hold down the fire button, only shoots an extra round for the first round, afterwards it's normal.
---
Is anyone able to confirm this?
---
I was able to confirm that two-shot shotguns only fires an extra pellet, and not a whole extra shotgun round.
---
Yeah, that's the unintended exaggerated damage I was talking about commonly known as magic damage. Certain prefixes on weapon cause shotguns to do stupidly massive amount of damage. Check out angryturtles recent video on magic damage for the straightforward explanation
---
That plan dropped for me yesterday.
---
But what would I do with the extra 3 minutes, huh smart guy???
---
first time doing imgur, hope I did it correct. 
---

---
The blocking armor piece only gives the magic effect to shotguns and not heavy weapons.
---
Sounds like a coding problem.
---
What? Random citizens hurling nukes left and right around the map isn't a completely normal phenomenon?
---
When I started I used this as a guide. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks pick where you are going build wise and evolve. Don't be afraid to play around build and how you play. Early on I used Pharma Farma, can do and caps. As I went up I used things like White Knight. The forest is great for wood. Join teams and use their camps to fast travel to and explore. Never be afraid to run from a fight. Use others camps defences to goad enemies towards them (remember repair any damage caused, it's only polite). Legendary armor I have found to be invaluable is 2x 50% of falling damage and the other chameleon. Chameleon I found at lvl 5 and had been invaluable. Guns for legendary stats I prefer explosive. One perk card I recommend is the VATS select one. Remember this. Ghouls go for the legs then they have to shamble after you (can't run if you aint got no legs), humans and mutants head shots and legs, sentry bots fusion cores using a crit shot, animals what ever you can hit works. Deathclaws and Gulpers their bellies. Mirelurks go for their heads. Pissy Yogi Bears and Assaultrons - run. I got nothing for those two. Even at lvl 150 I am still their chew toy.
---
No, its the initiate paint plan I believe that is rare, as for disease cures I dont think any are rare. Its the healing salves.
---
A lot of dupes involve the use of npc sellers.
---
I can get some decent date out of a flamer or cryolator but that's true, the rest are pretty bad. It doesn't help that the Fatman is pretty buggy anyways and the impact seems quite delayed on it and the broadsider
---
Oh well. I was over it after like ten minutes. I guess now that I know what I’m doing I’ll be able to run it faster next time and hopefully avoid jackasses like that.
---
Thank you for detailed answer. It's nice to see I other notice same thing as well. I will change to concentrated fire, I forgot that one thank you.
---
I have three characters each specializing in two or three weapon types, all full health, two of them junkies. Rifles/heavy weapons (power armor for boss fights), [commando/two-handed](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff53b25&amp;d=pg2ph2pp2sn2sm2s42ss2c02ee2ic4lt2i12pi2pr2se2a01s12eh0l71&amp;m=cf8h) (junkie, full time power armor), and [pistols/shotguns/unarmed](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f793895&amp;d=pb2pc2ee2so2sp2sd2ad2ak2al2lt2ic1i12p60s92ej4cu2ss2l71s12&amp;w=eh2es1sb2&amp;ad=0478a&amp;n=Jay%20Dub) (junkie, power armor for boss fights). Looks like I haven't bookmarked the rifleman/heavy weapons build but I can get it if you're interested.
---
If you're going for a vats or bloodied build I think it makes it tougher to specialize in multiple weapon types due to their being a lot of auxiliary cards that you'll need.
---
Instagating Lever Rifle + sneak build = win
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
It's magic if you wear one or more pieces of armor with 15% block, to test jump into power armor to watch the magic effect go away
---
I hate how this game can't snap the structures nicely on uneven grounds. Building any of those paid atom structures is so freaking fugly that I gave up making a nice looking camp.
---
Yeah, it's like the 90% reduced weight only reduces the weapon before mods are applied. 
---
That would practically be LMG level. I'm trying to get a quad handmade because it reminds me of an RPK. Good thing to add though
---
Ammo will be easier to get then than now.
---
It would be interesting if Bethesda can provide a way to see the whole teams dps, especially at the end of the encounter.
---
I'd love a QE but getting one seems like a nightmare since they're actually pretty good. If I manage to get one I'll definitely do a review though, might have some nice things to say haha
---
You still will.  There's still a level cap.
---
not true, a have bloody one star gatling gun, I kill earl in 30 seconds if he doesn't move, 15% armor works for all things
---
Too bad we can't add deep pockets
---
yall bitched and moaned for "balance", well its coming in the next patch.
---
and "equally viable" just means does the same damage so nothing will matter. no fuck that.
---
Magic damage is something to be feared indeed. 33%vhc is on the list of magic effects but still, that's definitely a good combo
---
And some time gating too because why not.
---
Patch 22 changelog:
---
------------- 
---
* Ammo points increased from 2,000 to 100,000. 
---
* Players may only trade up to 1,400 ammo points per day.
---
Much appreciated!
---
Ah fair enough thought I'd seen somewhere that it was only for shotguns.
---
They can. Theres a bug that allows players to glitch through the doors. Me n my team mate met a pair of players glitching their way thru to the launch sequence.
---
This is the problem with fallout76: for now, Bethesda devs just rely on the existing game  UI framework (ie: stash, merchant, terminal), and they can think things ouside of it.
---
It would be cool to fix modus and bring his A.I back to normal parameters and re-establish the enclave as a full blown faction once more in Appalachia.
---
Considering the future of the enclave and no mention of modus rejoining the bigger collective from past games it would be nice to know a small portion of the enclave survived and didn't get disbanded like the rest did. Maybe our actions in fo76 brings back the enclave in future fallout games
---
Oh yes. They totally missed time gate oportunity here.
---
Fallout 76 is essentially way more wholesome rust
---
Aight imma head out there.
---
Something isn't free when it's part of a monthly subscription you're paying for(Xbox Gamepass)
---
That's very true. Definitely risky especially around ghouls or mirelurks
---
This
---
I don’t play on Xbox or PS4 I play on pc...
---
I can’t see anything positive coming from those kind of stats.  There’s enough people melting bosses with magic weapons as it is.  It would just make it worse.
---
Glad I am not the only one that this is happening to. I have tried revisiting the terminal  for queen of the hunt that hasn't fixed it. 
---
Guess it's time to raise a ticket. Lol.
---
I read somewhere that this is currently in the PTS so hopefully it will be available soon.
---
I saw the Oxhorn video on it, so yeah I've been there.
---
im for One Wasteland reshuffle of the map, i'm against this weapon rebalance.  if they wanted to curb crazy how damage, they could have simply set a max dmg cap.  this way people cant run around doing insane 10k dmg.  once you hit a dmg cap, you'd be incentivized to throw your perks to defense or utility.
---
I go with alcohol, med-x, day tripper, psycho, and mentats. The penalties for med-x, mentats, and day tripper are light, and I tend to take psychobuff in tough fights. Whiskey too on my melee character, and beer for bartering.
---
It's still not a F2P(free to play) game, it was sold as  full priced game just feature incomplete without paying more.
---
How does a gutsy one shot a player?  Do you not wear any armor?
---
A need a Whitespring assaultron to keep my bear company while I'm away.
---
Not when I bought it
---
Dont buy the negative hype, there are tons of people who play, even at odd hours late at night.
---
FYI: If one of your pieces of armor has the blocking stat then your shotty is magic.
---
Ok nice thanks!
---
Not entirely accurate. If you read the plan you have no chance of getting that particular plan again. I have all seven and read each as I got them, so I don’t get paint job plans to drop any more.
---
Faster than a explosive laser rifle?
---
Exactly though, you bought it, free to play is when the game is literally free to play like Apex Legends, Fortnite or Runescape.
---
“Fallout 3 nostalgia kicks in”
---
he's probably running bloodied at sliver of health.
---
Looks like a decent weapon. Nothing exceptional, but good overall. You'd want to consider a stronger prefix though - Furious, Bloodied, Junkie - for best results.
---
Faster than a TSE Flamer?
---
Ah good to know. I still haven’t read mine because I was afraid it would prevent my from getting the rest. But if it simply prevents me from getting that same plan again, I’ll still hang on to it. So i might be able to get it again for my gf.
---
Remove the terminal and just keep the ammo converter machine with that UI would be banging
---
I’ve never tried that.  I guess I have just enough self confidence to never even think of asking myself to be my own friend.
---
Don't know really, I don't own any legacies. Sounds like it runs out quick
---
But you gave an answer he didn't like
---
As someone who has less then 20 days, I would love for there to be more ways of buying gold bullion...or treasure notes....maybe has it that you can sell or trade the notes and still keep the 200 cap....this way the 3rd party market cant sell them for real world money....the player can still use them for them selves...make some extra caps on the side selling them..I think it was made that way so people couldn’t get all the gear all at once from a 3 day event grinding play session...but I agree especially since we get 8 for ACP...3 nukes and you got 24....
---
I only finished the questline yesterday and I already have extras...
---
Yes, and I love it so far. I've had a lvl 300+ guy drop a lot of food, stimpaks and super stimpaks. I've also had countless encounters with other players, just waving at eachother and sending hearts.
---
Well in that case, I cannot imagine the gauss pistol having worse durability than a explosive laser rifle because they normally break within minutes of use.
---
It's probably only worth considering highly armored enemies, since low armor enemies tend to be low level trash that you can take down with a pipe pistol. Weapon damage needs to be taken into account though, since high damage per shot weapons penetrate armor better. The comparison I saw put junkies 5% ahead of anti-armor for a handmade. If you're running something with higher damage, like a lever action, gauss pistol/rifle, or super sledge (particularly with incisor), you're increasingly better off with junkies (or instigating...)
---
You may as well keep going.  I have like 300 unused perk selections, which will probably be a full two hours of just selecting Adamantium Skeleton once legendary perks go live.
---
Or try this to get the foundations exactly half a level lower or higher:
---
Place a foundation. Now under stairs category at the bottom are those single steel beams. Place one of the short ones on that first foundation. Now attach a second foundation to that steel beam.
---
Seeing hundreds of mounted head plans at full price makes me stabby.
---
Minutes, huh? That sounds familiar. Are you ***sure*** you're using an explosive laser and not a gauss pistol?
---
I'm upset because it's not removing food and water bars.
---
what? no multi-layer ton of pages to go for the pain? blasphemy!
---
You probably had a magic shotgun with a bugged legendary effect that was making it do alot more damage than it should have been.
---
I’ve never used a gauss pistol so I wouldn’t know how fast they break, but it’s pretty common knowledge that some legacy’s with explosive prefix typically break super fast.
---
Thank you! How would we arrange modding a minigun?
---
I echo what /u/pheakelmatters wrote. I run junkies commando stealth and can quickly dispatch most enemies.   I grew tired of farming for lead and such (yeah, I know all the farming routes including Lucky Hole) so switched back over to my stealth junkies melee alt for Colossal Problem.   I just take out the Wendigos and let the Heavy PA gang take care of Earl.  I absolutely love that event.   Once you get the hang of it, it’s a blast.
---
I wouldn't bother unless she's an obsessive collector of all plans. The final Paladin paint is much nicer than all the others and you'll never want to use one of the earlier ones. It would also take either a ridiculously long time or amount of farming desks to get 2 complete sets.
---
Been there and also collected some of the keys to get in the other cells. Don't recall funding anything worthwhile in there.
---
I'm just gonna go ahead and be a buzzkill like the last time this was posted:
---
----------
---
I see this posted frequently and while I would *love* for it to happen, it's obviously not going to be realistic within the current game:
---
- Sliders don't work within FO computers, which means the converter would need to become a vendor.
---
- If it becomes a vendor, then they would need to create a new currency for it. Adding an entire new currency to the game for a SCORE reward already seems unrealistic. The game gets around this issue for "lesser" rewards by making physical/digital tokens like the theme park tokens, but those are dealt with via computer screens again.
---
- Even if they made a currency, that currency would then need to be adjusted so that 1 bullet bucks (TM) = 1 bullet for the cheapest ammunition.
---
- Every ammo would then have to be re-valued because you can't have any ammo be worth anything other than an integer of bullet bucks. This also makes balancing the system a*lot* harder.
---
I just don't see that stuff happening for an ammo converter. I think they'd sooner add ammo breakdown capabilities to the Tinkerer workbench (like NV's ammo workbench).
---
To add to all that, NPC vendors are more prone to exploits.
---
I did the math for myself. I need to log in every day for the next 180 or so days to finish buying all of the plans from all of the vendors. This is the way of an MMORPG aiming to make money. They need you to log every day. If I could get more gold I'd not log in as often. Its a time gate.
---
One must remember this about 76. Don't fall into the illusion that this is just another game. It's been built for cash flow. Daily logs and activity means you'll check the atom store this higher chance at spending money.
---
Elder is the last paint, not Paladin.
---
Its always shoots two rounds.
---
I just want my scrapbot to actually shoot at attacking enemies. That way I know I at least have two guards at my camp if my pet falls.
---
I already tried that but doesn't work. But maybe with some magic I can make it work. It worked once before but I forgot to record it :/. Thx for the idea.
---
For the stealth part of your build, you should really try and get the silencer mod for that rifle.
---
I'm guessing you probably don't have it unlocked yet.
---
Line in the Sand event, or farming rifles off scorched would be a good way to get enough rifles to scrap.
---
Buy and enjoy. Still a very popular game with extremely nice community. 
---
And dont fear the level 100+ waving for you to come here: he/she is probably just trying to drop something for you and help you out
---
I think at one point the Mire healing salve plan was ultra rare, or the disease cure, but it became more common after an update.  I know that the Shielded Casual plan was almost impossible to find at one point, and now it’s just kinda rare.
---
In my experience, only the shielded raider and a handful of ultracite PA mod plans are still very, very difficult to acquire.  Everything else seems to be obtainable without too much trouble.  Even Puncturing Bear Arm plans are readily available in the trading circles now.
---
I'll be on just after noon. I can help out.
---
When you get a moment, I might go for heavy weapons, would you mind sending me a pm of your perks in order to try mimic what you have into my player. I trust this community more so than a YouTube video so it would be very helpful. I'm going to keep stocking up on legendary stuff to sell and get a legendary heavy.
---
I haven't tried a gauss shotgun yet, but the best shotgun I've found for sustained dps (what you need for anything that takes more than one shot to kill) is a quad double-barrel. I've also tried an anti-armor/fire rate combat shotgun but the double-barrel hits harder against anything and fires much faster. Anti-armor outperforms junkie's against armored enemies due to the low damage per pellet and lack of armor mitigation perks, and that will become even more true after the incoming damage calculation changes.
---
For stuff that can be killed in one or two shots, instigating is the best. An instigating pump action is probably best for multiple enemies (unless there's more than 8).
---
Thanks! do you have discord?
---
Not too bad at nuked whitespring with adrenal reaction and glow sight though (I experiment with all the legendaries I find)
---
The terminal has some interesting stuff
---
Quite rare
---
i think you need to keep at least 2 animals alive to have a chance of getting it
---
Also you auto learn it so check your backpack crafting
---
I don't think the issue is that they don't know how to execute it. There are 1,001 ways to do it that aren't tedious and stupid. They just don't care enough to do it.
---
Rly?Ive had it for a while and thought it came from the atom shop
---
Nah. I'm old and can't figure it out. I have an account but don't use it. I have a mic though.
---
Make a build! It’s fun to plan it out before and it’ll help you not waste any level ups:
---
Use this site
---
You *have* to prime an LMG if you want to have any hope of keeping up with the ammo consumption.
---
The crafting rate of regular .308 is crap, but you can craft around 170 ultracite .308 with Ammo Smith 2. Don't know how exactly Ammo Factory stacks with AS, but I assume that with both perks at max rank you'll be able to craft 300-500 ultracite .308 for each regular craft.
---
Furious, hands down.
---
Two Shot is a flat 20% extra damage bonus and that’s IF the second shot even hits, plus Two Shot degrades your weapon faster and makes it super inaccurate.
---
Furious however, adds 10% damage on every successful hit to a maximum of 50% as long as it’s on the same target. And that’s on par with Junkies if I’m not mistaken since Junkies adds 10% damage for every addiction up to a max of 50%.
---
BackFlip
---
Yup agree. lol But just to be sure - when it’s late at night for you somewhere around the globe is daytime
---
Yeah a mic is nice. discord isn’t really required lmao
---
Pipe bolt action? idk why but pipes never ever worked in any decent way for me but I spent great deal of low/mid level game with pipe revolvers. .45 ammo was great loot for me.
---
Gauss is deadly, IF you manage to land the shot. It's nothing like fallout 4 in my opinion, both in Nuclear winter and adventure mod, I could almost never land headshots. I either fully miss or land a body shot.
---
If they think a 30% buff is all it needs to be viable, they must have never used the thing in game.
---
its just the scrap one, there is no new option
---
Check this out
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/
---
i have it unlocked and cannot remember ever learning the plan. And i just had a quick google and a few others say the same
---
You don't really benefit from saving level ups at the lower levels. It helps to have an idea of what you want your endgame build to be though. If you're looking to go heavy guns or melee you'll want to focus on strength, agility and intelligence in the early game... If you want to go rifles you'll want perception, agility and luck.
---
Same that’s how I got mine thanks for confirming that since I never used the plan
---
This. I‘d like one with that good ol‘ Butler attitude.
---
„Good evening Siiiiir may I bring you a cup of bloodleaf tea together with your loafers siiiiiiiir?“
---
Absolutely. I wish Beth would stop designing quests with the idea in mind that players can fast travel anyway so it doesn't matter if the quest is far away and requires 4 trips to complete.
---
I hate the ammo converter. Such a waste of time that I'll just drop the ammo somewhere. Hell, let me break it apart and get some salvage to create other ammo I want.
---
1v1 me Final Destination no items
---
I‘m patient so I do. From the bottom of my heart.
---
Stealth is how I solo Earle. As long as you use covert operative and Mr. Sandman you'll be doing 3.75x damage with suppressed weapons. You won't need to worry too much about dying if you can't be seen, so bloodied or not you'll be fine with high enough agility and sneak 3. 
---
Junkies is superior for full health though. Remember to loot the wendigos for stimpacks and you'll end up with more than enough to stay alive
---
Dm you
---
Right now it's still $40. So I will wait for Christmas or Black Friday.
---
This is really useful if you join a server late and notice people are doing ACP. Join a public team with a member present and fast travel to them
---
I’ve got 5 different builds between level 150 and 250, everyone is different and fun in its own way.
---
My full health explosive shotty build is a lot of fun.
---
I’ve discovered You have to decide If you want massive damage or massive fun , my bloodied HG wrecks but takes a lot of micro management, whereas I can just fire up my full health builds and play.
---
Aye. it'll probably still take 10-15 levels past 50 to perfect it as well.
---
I’d go for Quality of Life perks until you hit lvl 50. Think Str, End, Ag. Focus on something basic like melee or commando. I saved all my level ups between 50 and like 80-85 and that made re-speccing a little more painless later on. Right now you should focus on staying alive, exploring, and XP. Try some low level publics like Tea Time or Swarm of Suitors. Join public teams for more free fast travel points. Don’t blow your caps on stupid shit. If you can afford Fo1st go for it. Just start stockpiling resources. Don’t look at fo4 as a model for what you should and should t pick up or scrap/keep. Only buy plans at player vendors that sell them cheap (1-5 caps, anyone else is ripping you off unless it’s super rare). People will generally be kind and generous but DONT BEG! Don’t be afraid to be social, it’s an MMO for Pete’s sake. And have fun while you are doing all of the above or it isn’t worth it! Good luck.
---
I'd like to take it slow, 200 gold bullion then i can log off.
---
Ign raskol. At some point I'll want to launch a nuke, but I can definitely answer questions and supply you.
---
Gutsies have janked armor penetration. They were difficult for me even when I had a full set of vanguards heavy combat armor and killed me in seconds. Just another broken feature from robots, like the Assaultrons who fire their head laser constantly with no charging.
---
Depends dow how you you define 'ridiculously long', took me about a month to complete including 2 sets of paladin and 5 sets of elder without hardcore grinding. 2-5 technical data a few days per week. Still a grind though.
---
Yes; quite a bit of ambient music is from 1/2.
---
I said more usable, not perfect.
---
Honestly, the damage needs to be upped far more (best pistol in the game levels), and the ammo needs to drop during colossal and daily ops.
---
lmao people downvoting a major game breaking bug. classing r/fo76
---
I live about 70 miles west of Appalachia and it’s definitely cicada season right now. Sometimes I have to turn the volume down to figure out if I’m hearing nature or console.
---
They should just make it a workbench that has recipes to convert ammo from one type to another directly. We don’t need a vendor, and we don’t need intermediate magic ammo points either.
---
I remember seeing this option somewhere but I've forgotten which terminal its at. Thought i was going crazy lol. Are you able to describe which one? Even roughly?
---
You can calculate yourself. How many atoms could you get in a week before SCORE and how many atoms you got from the legendary run?
---
There was a video counting it Ill add it here when i find it.
---
K thanks
---
You can't force any kind of legendary spawn. Outside of crafting the bullion gear. It's all just rng
---
The backpack is a guaranteed drop from project paradise if you do the side thing to shut down the project during the mission and then complete it. Most people don’t realize this because they weren’t the person that did the side thing to shut it down, but that’s where it comes from, everyone gets it if it was shut down by anyone. 
---
Look up a video on how to shut it down to see exactly where to go. But basically you start the mission on the terminal, then run straight and to the left into a hallway. Kill the ghouls there and put in a passcode on the keypad (970930). Then run downstairs and down one more floor and into a control room. There is a terminal in there that gives you the shutdown code. Now go back to the initial terminal to start the project and put in the shutdown code. Doing this will also heal the animals you need to protect later between enemy waves, and will stop spawning robots during the event (still have to kill the initial ones, but then they don’t respawn). So ultimately wether you’re trying to get the backpack or not, shutting down the project is worth doing every single time at when beginning of the event. I’ve solo’d project paradise using this method (only one animal kept alive tho).
---
Have you looked on instant gaming? (please mod if it's forbidden don't spank my ass)
---
Alright thanks tho, fallout has been changing alot lol
---
Ffr mini w/ limb dmg, about 3000 rounds of 5mm, power armor, and about 25 super stims. I haven’t bothered to find a more creative way to bring him down but this def works if you have a couple other committed teammates.
---
Their antiarmor ammo has no effect on perks like lone wanderer, dodgy, ricochet and serendipity.  If you rely exclusively on DR you’re going to get smoked, and why a suit of excavator PA will outperform a vanguard suit every time.  Ignoring a large percentage of damage with % based defense is why my builds are mildly annoyed by gangs of gutsies and assaultrons.
---
Unfortunately, you can’t simply replace one with the other with a serum.   I tried. You have to remove one then get the other with serum or random.   I’m too lazy to switch, but on my new alt I’m going to start with herbivore to see how it goes, when the time is right.   He’s only level 20 now lol.
---
Never get old. Does it? It might...
---
Maybe it does? Probably approaching old..
---
Nah fuck it. It's been done a thousand times before.
---
Different terminals, depending on the room you're in,  the first one is when u enter, on the left side , the second obe further up , before u enter the reactor room i think.
---
I never remove fusion cores from my inventory, but still get the animation whenever I switch between PA sets.
---
For singular mobs I suggest instigating. I had an Instigating 1* pump shorty and with no shotgun perks it would one shot most level 68 enemies with a vats headshot, even one shot Glowing Yao Guai and Glowing Deathclaws with a sneak attack vats headshot.
---
However for tougher mobs and bosses I’d say anti armor. And by luck there’s already a really good fixed anti armor pump shotty you can get, the Fancy Pump Shotgun. You can get it from the pleasant valley claim tickets that have a 1% chance to drop from any feral ghouls or scorched, the shotgun itself has a 2% chance of dropping from a ticket. This shotty is more than a fancy wall piece, it absolutely shreds stuff. Anti Armor, Limb Damage, -50% damage while aiming. And it has hidden abilities too that aren’t listed, two of them I can think of off hand is increased ammo capacity (Holds 12 shells instead of 8 like a normal pump shotty.) and faster reload. And I swear it feels like it has extra vats hit chance because it hits way more often than any other shotgun I own.
---
That guy can shot me through power armor, hit really hard
---
Did you edit your post to reflect that?  Because now it says shotguns and heavy weapons.
---
First you need to plough the field, then sow the seeds, add the fertilizer and finally wait for a few weeks then harvest.
---
I was wearing a Chinese stealth suit. I’m also pretty sure it was broken and my health was low. So yeah I basically wasn’t wearing any armor lmao. Even in my normal gear gutsy’s are beasts.
---
My character’s parents were SOMA project leads....
---
I wish they’d just do a complete overhaul on pistols.  Everything about them is poorly thought out and/or gimpy.
---
How do I protect my crops from the constant nukes?
---
Not clear. Some say it's broken,some say the extra damage is there but is not reflected on numbers and only on energies' bar.
---
You should find something that you barely cannot kill in one shot and try applying the card.
---
Country Roads, of course.
---
It's under floor decorations in your camp mode.
---
Touché my friend.
---
Right? It hurts so much to use that I don't even bother with the free ammo. That says something... and if 98% of my fellow Vaulties feel the same way?
---
When was the last time you even saw one in someone's camp?
---
Thank you kindly for that. I will be sure to check a bit more thoroughly on the next run.

Expand on "sliders don't work". When I switch to keyboard/mouse controls they suck, but they work.
---
And jesus, I switched to keyboard/mouse yesterday because the current heat wave drove me out of my living room, and keyboard/mouse is *painful* when a game won't let me remap my keys. At least without remappable console controls, I can just tell Steam to change what keypress gets sent to the game to "remap" my console controller. That's a lot less practical with keyboard/mouse, unless there's some hidden Steam feature I'm unaware of that will do that, so my shit's not all fucked up after I quit out of the game.
---
Seems weird that you would access a terminal, zoom into it, just to have a vendor interface pop up. Doesnt make much sense I think, even though it does look a lot less annoying to interact with than the one we currently have. Are there any other terminals that, when you interact with it, a terminal screen *doesnt* pop up? I think Bethesda wants to keep the menus on the terminal, Id imagine. Or else it, you know... wouldnt be done via terminal.
---
Could we come up with a better system if it was just on a terminal and not a completely separate screen like how you did it? My first change would be to scrap all of a specific ammo type without having to exchange 30 or 100 rounds at a time.
---
Share your build, gears, weapon, play style and lets see if we can help.

Most underrated FO76 comment ever.
---
They are a miscellaneous items.
---
Damn I just saw a 2\*  bloodied sniper riffle real cheap on ps4.  That would put out some crazy damage.  You can also think about instigating.  Double damage at full health is pretty good for sniping.  You could probably find an instigating limb damage weapon.  they are not popular but if your sniping the head counts as a limb from my understanding.
---
What's your ign?
---
That was before when I had a full set of vanguards and used heavy weapons. Now I’m a bloodied sneak commando. I still die, but I do insane damage at least. Non stealth builds are just asking for a bad time in this game.
---
Aluminium_Gold on pc
---
On a serious note its all about finding locations that spawn a lot of enemies. Most popular is whitespring or westek after that Charleston capital building. There is the burrows although its very easy to get lost.
---
After that its up to you, there is a few more places that can be good but its going to change soon hopefully with the one wasteland.
---
I would just  run white spring, westek then Charleston and server hop.
---
Forreal I love grinding away at   something just to watch the numbers climb but in fo76 ig
---
Unless you're feeding flux to your ammo exchange, I don't see that as at all balanced. Or is there some way to make ultracite ammo without flux that I'm not yet aware of?
---
I think they mean actual computers (terminals) inside the game. Not your computer at home. AFAIK no terminals in the game have sliders so that’s the main issue and why they said it would have to be a vendor instead of a terminal
---
you might try going over to the market sub. a bloodied black powder rifle should be pretty affordable, might take a bit to get one though, its a bit niche
---
I see them in camps but I can’t remember the last time I’ve seen someone using one

Sorry for keeping you waiting. There are challenges for collecting magazines. At Top of the world there are several which can be searched for in a certain order. Along the way there are plenty of scorched. Best google it for exact magazine spawn locations. there are couple vids on youtube.

anything as long as it's not the same one over and over again :)
---
???
---
I'd be happy if they fixed the problem exiting the converter if you forget to back out after each transaction instead of moving forward to your next transaction. If you forget, you have to hit back three times to exit the converter for *every transaction you've made*. If you made ten transactions, to exit the converter you need to hit back *thirty times*.
---
That's just off the top of my head. I *think* it's three backs per transaction.
---
And it's probably the case that you can just hit tab to exit if you're using keyboard/mouse, but the keyboard/mouse controls are so bad that I'm always on a console controller.

There’s minimum level and maximum level for enemies in every region. I think forest used to be lower but they did bumped it up to level 50 max.

The problem you’ll only have is if turrets doesn’t scale with your level.

yeah gauss pistol durability isnt great, it
---
Thanks, I did not know that. What makes it so good? It's built as part of a quest, so I've hopefully already got a set in the stash. Specifically I'm looking to use it for collosal event, as I've noticed pa users seem to fair far better.
---
Never thought of this one lmao
---
My setup is likely suboptimal, but I run heavy guns and shotgun.  With the shotgun I have really no fear of assaultrons because of thr maxed out Enforcer perk card.  Once their legs are cripples they are very easy.
---
Mr. Gutsys sill cause me fear though...
---
Try some Jack Daniels
---
The pathfinder mask is the one that you see Crane wearing which is like a industrial mask with a filter, the same one some Blood Eagles wear. And yeah, the road goggles are clearly seen. And yeah, the cannibal trait was because I was trying to swap around builds and my food perks were pulling away from the perks for my build.
---
I’m willing to bet Bethesda completely forgets to scale the camp turrets in one wasteland. Any pets we have will also just get destroyed... Highest level Deathclaw I’ve had was 21 I think? Highest level pet I’ve had though is a level 30 mirelurk king. I call him Gilbert. He’s my pet till I find a Deathclaw or my own turrets kill him.

You’re a wizard Harry

When I first visited Sugar Grove before unlocking the landmark for it I approached from the back and found that blacksite door, promptly to be forgotten about. Glad you posted this, I just visited the area and that was really cool. I wonder how many other locations like this I've missed...

Can we add the "A Line in the Sand" event to this list as well?

All of my this

Yes, you purchase the gun plans for gold bullion. The legendary mods you can buy from the purveyor. The mods are random so you may have to purchase a few legendary mods until you get the ones you want. As an example, I purchased the plan for the gauss pistol and modded it with the legendary mods purchased at the purveyor.
---
Just hold the back button to forcibly exit the terminal without going through each screen
---
While I agree with you it degrades faster than other pistols and would like this fixed (especially since patch 22 will make pistol builds more viable and I could finally enjoy my gunslinger), the 95% VATS miss bug on all gauss weapons is killing it for me. Damage and degradation was still somewhat manageable. But missing constantly at 95% in VATS for no reason just kills it. There's really no benefit of using it, at all. And without reliable VATS, it's just the pinnacle of annoyance. I was switching back to my western revolver constantly, because it was sooooo annoying. And then I just stopped playing that style altogether...

With the arrival of Wastelanders and Legendary Perks (soon), I believe there is no longer any reason to delete a character and restart.  Meaning, you should always choose to respec.  Let's say you had no other character accounts, and were deciding between restarting to level 50 with a new build, or respec'ing a level 150 character by adding 50 levels.  In others words, identical level of effort for both situations.  At the end of those 50 levels, the respec'd character would be superior for the following reasons:
---
1) Because they would be level 200, you would have more Legendary Perk slots to use vs. the new character.
---
2) You would not have lost any Treasury Notes or Gold Bullion.  These items cannot be transferred between character accounts.
---
3) You would have gained maximum value from your Legendary Script.  Like bullion, the script cannot be transferred at "full value."  Yes, you can convert to legendary weapons, transfer to your new build, then scrap.  But you lose value in the process.
---
4) You would likely have superior Wastelanders gear, since it cannot be transferred as well.  IE, if your respec character had gotten that magical "Bloodied, Faster Fire Rate" EC Minigun, you would still have it, unlike the new build.
---
5) You would likely have a higher Reputation and access to gear (which is being expanded by the Legendary Runs) from the human factions.  You would not have to go through the enormous grind to get Reputation with the Settlers and Raiders again.  Seriously, it takes \*forever\* to get any rep with these guys.  No sane person would want to do that again.
---
For me, this is unfortunate, because I've deleted probably 5 characters over my life.  Now, if Bethesda would just allow us to rename our characters...
---
I think any quest in this game can bug out. I've never actually seen Paradise do it though.
---
Carrots and razor grain
---
It isn’t different. They’re full of crap.
---
If you get it, contact me and I may have a fully modded level 5 legendary weapon for you. I save &amp; mod low level legendaries when I find them, and give them away to baby characters. 
---
I’ve got four weapons right now, two are level 5.
---
That wasn't where I was confused. I thought they meant that the sliders that you get in a vendor/pip boy exchange don't work. The part that confused me was that they started talking about a fallout computer interface again, while OP had presented a vendor interface. Saying that sliders don't work in a computer interface isn't relevant when the person is proposing to change it to a vendor interface.
---
I've been playing the hand I get dealt. If I get a good weapon that's not too difficult to spec into, I'll change my build for the weapon--again within reason.
---
Upvoted got recognition
---
Umm ok
---
There is a short cut you can open once your in the room with the big door and 15 cores that need replacing. Technically you can use an glitch to use this door on your way in but it's intended to be a quick way back if you die.
---
I want Biv at my camp, he's awesome!
---
You’d be incorrect that it hasn’t been discussed.
---
It’s a known bug and efforts to patch it thus far seem to have failed.
---
You’ll need someone with access to the patch test server to see if it’s fixed there.
---
Nope. Zero players.
---
I don’t think the BOS collectron scavenges for you, I think you need to collect materials for IT.
---
Free facelifts for my customers.
---
I didn’t even know there was one!
---
Absolutely!
---
If I were to roll a second toon I'd plan out the build up front. I wasted a lot of level-ups moving perk points around.
---
I always do the Biv and Camden Park dailies. Biv's recipes sell well and who wouldn't want to wear a soiled Mr. Fuzzy costume?
---
Ammo is worthless. Duping it only bolsters economy.
---
Example: notice how much ammo is up for sale now that the ammo extractor is widespread. You can actually buy .308 in quantities larger than 50 now.
---
Yessir
---
I rarely run into mean players
---
Im just tired of missing crits like seriously its a 100% chance to hit and it still does no damage?
---
Suck off overseer
---
According to the terminal display it's configured to gather materials useful to BoS. Otherwise known as scrap. You can't reconfigure it, however, it vaguely indicates that you will be able to do that once the BoS arrive.
---
True, but if it still at the level where it would have to be a second job and literally the only thing you do with your free time its a problem
---
Wait not everyone knows the door glitch
---
I will pay up to 125 for bog and ash heap maps. Usually pay up to 100 for any map, no questions.

Add half a cup more juice and it should be 👌

Unfortunately this will just encourage the shitlords with hacked weapons to instakill him.

Super fun event when he's dead before your gun spins up.

Try buying serum plans as a cap sink? I have a similar cap problem as you, I buy ammo, maps, serum plans, camp/weapon plans etc.
---
Ammo weigh less, and will soon become much more valuable...
---
Gonna laugh my butt off when they find a fix for these magic weapons and everyone cries
---
Instigating for heavy hitting weapons and farming will probably shine more, since it doubles the damage after all the perks and bonuses. Sustained damage will still be based on whatever adds the most - so bloodied. And as others mentioned, AA will go up, as it is a multiplicative bonus by decreasing the resistance.
---
I though you meant for the cheaper bud and poison politics
---
Furry confirmed.
---
Your steps worked thanks, had to reload 3 tunes
---
I dont always do all the dailies, I always do the faction ones to get treasury notes, but the others I pick and choose. Depends on what they are or how I feel.
---
I always do cop a squatter and heart of the enemy, I've never had superb rewarss from them i just like doing them. 
---
They are worth doing though. I landed up with a legendaey fixer from Someone to talk to. Just a 1 star furious, but i wasn't complaining.
---
It's not negated, but aggro seems to increase. It seems they hear the explosion like any other explosion. I've never actually tested it, maybe ill try blasting the ground to see what happens.
---
Your steps worked thanks, had to reload 3 of 4 timed
---
Why is that?
---
Yea someone to talk to is one i always have pop up on my screen
---
I had this problem after using the silo state holotape, all terminals and tapes would work fine, until i used the silo state tape, it wouldn't load, and it would break all other tapes and terminals.
---
I just want to preface this by saying I wouldn't complain if they upped the daily allotments. But...
---
People hate it, but if you just accept there's only 150 scrip in the machine per day it helps with inventory management. I only keep about two days worth of scrip (barring 90% weight reduction of course) in my stash box, because anything more just becomes dead weight.  The game isn't going to stop dropping scrip tier stuff for me, so I don't feel the need to hoard it. When I get to the point where I can't pick up anything else I'll either go put caps back in the vendor and sell off some stuff, or I'll just leave legendaries where they lay if they're not worth holding onto. Any legendary I kill is still a roll of the slot machine for something good, plus I can still farm out XP, caps, plans and other stuff. This all just my philosophy though, and I don't think anyone that disagrees with me is wrong.

---
The only reliable way around it is to triple tap VATS (enter exit enter) and shoot. And then use gun fu to switch if there are several mobs. But it's still annoying and takes way too long to kill a mob when doing anything... And if you loose line of sight, VATS exists and you have to start the triple tap thing again. Queen or Earle are just a lesson in frustration and totally kill the fun...
---
Hmm, interesting. Any idea how to fix it? I used it this morning for a silo so that's probably why
---
Maybe, I just bought it when I came back from vendor. I was surprised how much damaged it did but I thought the game just changed since last time I played so I didnt think much about it. Oneshotted every legendary mob. Problem was I had to be in melee range and only two bullets then a reload, and I got tired of that. If I knew it was this much better than the rifle I have, I would never have changed.
---
Bushwook it!
---
You’re awesome. 
---
Just make sure to add in ‘stash your junk every time you see a stash box’. 
---
Especially the *stable flux*.
---
Absolutely 100%, I'm 2 years in and it's still awesome, can't say that about any other game I've played has it for it's issues of course but it shines through, you won't regret it 👍
---
whats your SPECIAL? and what lvl are you?
---
I dont know anything, I just have stealth because I happen to have the chinese armor. I think I read somewhere that specific mods made vats reduced cost as a hidden stat. But I can check out the silent mod for sure.
---
What’s your luck at currently?
---
They will simply make bosses drop mostly one star wood pieces so all this ‘150 limit laughable’ will stop. Then you’ll need to kill 25 queens to meet the 150 limit, still too low? This is how they handle things in this game, nerfing is their universal answer and it just works.
---
Poison politics? That could be said of every state lmao
---
Just server hopping, and not using the tape, thought it was just me, but now that i know its not, I'll submit a ticket to Bethesda, weird thing is like an hour earlier the day it was happening it worked fine.
---
Add in a terminal screen that let’s us play the game as well. 
---
Perhaps an option where you can allow other players to access the games as well.

I mainly run Assault Rifles/Handmades with my build. 
---
Thooough I've got a few survivability perks, Ironclad which gives ya + 50 Damage Resistance/Energy when not wearing power armour. Which is great, due to basically having an extra bit of DR (Damage Resistance) when you've first spawned in, plus it actually gets added on top of your regular DR, even when you're wearing armour. (Just regular armour, like Marine and whatnot) 
---
Another I'd suggest is Lifegiver. Extra Health enough said, really. 
---
Need Rage, gives ya extra damage/+100 DR when at 20% health. More of a luck of the draw kinda perk.. Sometimes it's saved me arse, other times.. Just prolonged the attack, thus in turn my death.. 
---
I meaaan, it's still a pretty solid survivability perks, if you ask me thooough. Was able to get to rank 100 on NV with the build. Thaaat I still use the same build on my other character. 
---
As for Damage perks personal preference, really.
---
Mine's completed (despite my having never completed it) and it can no longer be activated by any means I can think of. :(
---
Yeah man, why do you think I bought the black bear costume too. The fact it looks out of place af in a wasteland setting is just icing on the cake.
---
Apparently plasma cores, right above your comment here.
---
Not sure about the special. Around lvl 80
---
A) a legendary perk card that gives you 250% more ammo
---
B) enemies will start dropping the ammo you use to kill them.
---
Yes because they give scrip,
---
I use a vampires Ugatling laser, and just stand in the tunnel next to where he spawns firing into his face while the rest of the team does their own thing. I may only deal \~3 damage per shot (normally run no perks for dmg), but putting 2000 shots into his face with no risk of dying is not a problem, and the fact he is standing still and the rest of the team can do whatever with little to no risk makes the event run smoothly. 
---
I also bring three flamers for the spawns, they deal a ton of aoe damage and you can generally walk out having spent little to no flamer ammo as long as you are conservative and aim for groups of enemies, I need three because they do break very quickly.
---
If you have other collectrons you can still change modes.   I see scrap, junk, chems, weapons, revolutionary, and proletarian.
---
Well they change little things like that time from time, it helps ive you can manage yourself to be more observice instaid of blindy pick up everything you come across without looking so ive your in need of something persific you less wondering where to get it.
---
I’m running 4 different builds, all bloody:
---
Commando, shotgunner, heavy guns, and the newest addition is an explosives build with enough perk points left over for almost complete one handed melee. 
---
I’ll say this about a shotgun build. It is fun, it is OPAF, but after a while it gets a little boring. I barely use him anymore.
---
Thrown explosives you shoot in VATS seem to be the most powerful (besides cheating) way to go, especially once you can get the perks for damage and range of the explosion.  I have taken out entire teams with a single grenade that way.
---
K ima probably try bloody heavy.
---
I like the idea of scaled enemies and all but i am not that big of a fan of the damage debuff.Right now it isn't that good the bonuses you got from perks,food,chems etc wont be the same.I know they already made up their mind on the damage debuff so it won't be worth the begging and asking.My only wish right now is that they debuff everything correctly and i think it will happen valseek alrady said something about it.Right now in the PTS a pipe pistol is better than a gatling laser for some reason,thats how bad the debuff is.
---
With patch 22 they should also buff turrets because of the enemies scalling up.Give them more preception and a bit more damage because i don't want a level 100 radroach to destroy my whole camp.
---
What holotapes/notes are essential to keep on you at all times and which ones can be stashed?
---
Thanks man I'll have to try that
---
Essentially all power armor is about the same.  It has a 45% straight damage reduction.  Put emergency protocols on the chest and it's totals about 70% reduction.
---
Lol
---
And if anyone cares to see the trick in action, look no further [than here](https://youtu.be/c-YoeDNcFgo)
---
you should consider yourself lucky that you got 3* drops..
---
most people complain about 3* mobs dropping 1* loot.. youve had a pretty good day..
---
Got two yesterday with 7 and the other character is just 2 for starched genes.  Honestly if I just sit there for a few minutes hitting them continuously, I've had one every time within 10 tries.
---
Get your hands on a good Gatling gun (IMO) best gun for just running around and being ammo friendly and durable and no spin up lag, no spin down lag if you need to stim or swap weapons. 50 cal is good for this too but is less ammo friendly.
---
Yo if anyone has that and you play on ps4 hit me up cause I want that damn helmet and I DO NOT have the resources to do that mission again lol
---
I never get far when i just try hidding haha
---
so i run
---
S15 P9 E3 C3 I5 A10  L11
---
with this, i can run commando, rifleman, 1H and 2H melee, Unarmed,  Shotguns, and Big guns reasonably well. you could drop some strength and drop the endurance for more perception or agility and be fine. i like this set up, its the most versatile imo
---
also if you stick around into the high levels, you will be able to add even more special if you invest in the legendary special points.
---
I can't even use my ammo converter anymore. I hit the terminal and it's just a blank screen lmao and I've tried this at my friends camps too, I just can't use the ammo converter at all
---
https://imgur.com/a/a4d7sB4

This is what it looks like, it makes no sense at all! -.-*
---
Hide in a bush, move quick when needed, and most of the time i make it to the last 5, only play when i have to, nw is tedious and boring, like all br games.
---
It takes all the wood, concrete, steel, cork, glass, cloth and leather from your stash and gives it directly to the BoS.
---
The fact that people still dump missiles, 40mm nades and mini nukes says that no one wants to deal with the ammo converter... This would be great!

Forgot a Mister Handy! They can't do nothin' compared to an EyeBot! I want one of those little guys, playing music, floating around..

I'm on.

You can't
---
How do i add you its my first time friending someone on bethesdas god awful platform
---
weapons dont level up.. youll have to get a new one with a higher level
---
The game is coming to its end of shelf life.
---
No complaints on my part.Has been excellent value.
---
I have over 400 levels in the game.
---
New content can not come fast enough to placate end of gamers.
---
And to be fair to Bethesda why should they have to.Most you higher levels,like me have all had seriously good value from it.
---
All that is left is to make travelling the Wastelands a bit more challenging..
---
Many have been  wanting Nerfs on just about [every decent build.So](https://everything.So) here it comes.
---
I am looking forward to a new Fallout experience in the near future.
---
My logs ins on 76 are getting shorter,and shorter.Simply not much to do.This is not a complaint by the way.Just a statement of fact.
---
Same thing happened to me!
---
Honestly, they aren’t awful. The biggest issue is that sneak is hard to use with them, but if you instead go all in on critical hits, they work just fine. Tank killer applying to them in patch 22 will fix their main problem, which was armor penetration.
---
And frankly? Even sneak can work with them, but it takes some doing.
---
Did you try logging off and back on. That’s the usual recommendation when someone has a post like this.
---
Yeah. It didn’t help :/
---
I live out in the boonies and one of my neighbors makes and tests guns for Ruger. So sometimes I can’t tell if I’m hearing distant gun fire in the game or my neighbor’s newest receiver.
---
Late game, personal opinion cuz then you can experiment better with a lot of gear and perks later down the road
---
Only if you buy your way there with atoms unfortunately 😕
---
I was wondering today if the nuke flame killed you, then i nuked a trap camp while my friend distracted him
---
Odds are very small, the run ends in 2 days. Try your best to get a few more ranks before then is all i can give ya
---
Hit social in the main menu. Look for my ign raskol in your list of friends. Click on it to add me.
---
Not for me. Like, if you quickly go into vats, aim for a one shot-headshot, shoot, and go back out, what happens? For me, the hit "registers", damage number pops up, but the enemy is completely fine. Same with spamming vats shots on e.g. a flying Scorchbeast, although choosing Torso instead of Head seems to be more consistent
---
Bethesda does not like Simple and Efficient. 
---
It likes Grindy and Time wasting.
---
It was insane for them to choose a map with such hilly terrain for FO76, as the pre-fab structures pretty much rely on level ground to look anywhere near right. You’ll notice that the elaborate camp builders on YouTube are often using one of the few, level patches of ground in the game.
---
Ok thx
---
Happened to me yesterday on PS4
---
is there a "fast" way to contact bethesda support? because i dont expect them to give us a week extension on the legendary run
---
The bug might be only visual, because i just completed a challenge but it doesnt show it?
---
I don't think so. 😐
---
I will one-up with a TSE dragon. 200% repair, I get 7-8 long-range shots
---
No fix for this. 
---
The best you can do is to log off 5 minutes before the reset, then log back 5 minutes after, straight into public adventure mode without even looking at the Atom Shop or Nuclear Winter. Then just wait 5 minutes without fast traveling or going into an instanced location. Don't look at the ingame Atom Shop or the challenges themselves during this time either.

I'll nuke your CAMP if you so as much as hurt a single hair on Chally.

Appreciate it. I thought my weapon and I could lvl up together
---
Thanks man!
---
I've noticed if ur playing when the reset happens then u get the bug. Happens to me everytime. I always wait til reset to start playing. Not sure if this is what causes the bug for everyone but for me I can replicate it everytime.
---
This may be known but... found yesterday while building on ps4.  If you hold down x you can fine tune the thing you are trying to place. If you press L1 it lowers into the ground and R1 lifts it into the air. Helps for perfect elevation when starting the foundation. 
---
For the blueprint trick - also if for example you place the bunker right at the edge of your boundary you cant then place anything outside the red area. But i have had some success blueprinting the objects in first and then placing the structure . 
---
Great work OP.
---
Yea the one that took 25min was the initial tower in forest where you do wayward quest
---
Yep, the main problem with recycling missiles is that the terminal wants you to give them by packets of 3 instead of 1, so nobody has the patience to keep them until they have enough.
---
Play colossal problem non stop til Tuesday and kill as many of the wendigo spawns as you can.
---
Holy shit one guy just made a whole company of employees look like a bunch of morons lololol
---
Farm the f out of the repeatable weekly xp gain to get as much score and then maybe buy some extra ranks with atoms, but the way I approached these seasons is that i look at the rewards and look at what rank the last rewards that interests me is at, in the current one was the chicken coop, but since i was able to farm ranks on the weekends and all week during the last month i was able to finish it in time
---
But i suggest to look at what rank you would like to unlock before the end
---
&gt; Seems weird that you would access a terminal, zoom into it, just to have a vendor interface pop up.
---
Yes I should have cut the video 1s earlier to make it even clearer that a terminal shouldn't be involved in this.
---
&gt; Could we come up with a better system if it was just on a terminal and not a completely separate screen like how you did it? 
---
No idea. I believe most people are fine with a vendor-like interface.
---
I had a weird experience launching a Nuke on PS4 today.First time ever this happened.
---
Completed the countdown.
---
All the lights dimmed as they normally do,and got my pointless reward.The sign you completed.
---
But Gutsies,and Assautrons kept spawning relentlessly for a good 5 minutes afterwards.I was still having to kill them.I could hear footsteps like there was another gamer in the Silo,but there wasn't..It was only me there.
---
Weird shit.
---
Parallel  virtual reality colliding.
---
Good point.
---
I thin he's talking about the daily ops, in where enemies will drop a lot of ammo of the weapon you use
---
bl33dingsaint
---
Nope I enter vats and fire things die. If I stay in vats with gun fu I 1 shot over and over as it auto swaps to the next target. Occasionally misses but then it always has
---
Yo can’t
---
That could be an ally, daily quest would be to fetch ingredients for your tea
---
Good work, soldier. I'm proud of you and your friend.
---
yeah TSE would break faster.
---
No, you won't.
---
It should be at least 500 daily across the board. Between meat week and ACP i now have 2 mules full of gear and enough notes to last about 2 weeks that i am now skipping ACP. Theres still alot of gold plans to buy but i have to wait 2 weeks to be able to buy it. My incentive to play is now literally just going to 2 machines which really kills any reason for me to actually play as its just more of a burden. 
---
People have already stopped going to normal note paying events that an increase isnt a bad thing its not going to turn people off anymore than being overloaded with the items themselves will.
---
I was there when the nuke hit. I embraced death just to see his walls crumble. He was too busy pvping with my friend to notice the nuclear bomb on the way to hit his camp. Best thing? No bounty
---
Thanks man I did not even know this. I tried it and base damage in torso for furious topped out at 41, anti armor 33, and Hunter at 27. Guess Hunter fixer gets put away until next meat week. I friend just added a suppressor to my level 40 bloodied combat rifle that I got from Uranium Fever. I will try it out but furious has a faster fire rate so who knows?
---
Then what are those things if they're not teeth!?!
---
I think he means one quick burst.
---
Their Bullets are like a knife through Butter.
---
I run a fully unyielding set of Armour.I can only survive two bursts, running a bloodied build.
---
Why it is best you have a weapon that one shots them.
---
My go to weapon for Nuke rums is a bloodied explosive black powder Rifle..Turns Nuke runs in to walk [through.One](https://through.One) shot everything even a Legendary Assaultron.
---
Likely will be scripping this after the Nerf bwhaaaaaaaaaaa
---
MVP 😊👍
---
I headed east early after leaving the Vault so found myself in the Savage Divide around the late teens, level wise. So by the time I backtracked over to Toxic Valley, enemies were 10 levels or so below me. Which made the discovery of the new area rather underwhelming. So I welcome One Wastelands promised level scaling revamp.
---
The level scale system feels broken currently. I'm running into level 6 Scorched whilst doing the main quest line, even though I'm pushing level 49, which can't be right. The only thing I'll miss is  running into those level 62 Charred Ghouls...oh, and scurrying back to the Forest when I've ran out of Simpacks.
---
As things stand at the moment, with the first player entering the area setting the level enemies spawn at, it's not sustainable for new players.  Surely, Bethesda can't fuck up One Wasteland?
---
Just happened to me on Xbox
---
I think I can use bloodied against him. I spent the last fight shooting Earle and only ever got bothered by Wendigos after an Earle scream. Otherwise they walked right by me crouched.
---
Bethesda hotfix inbound in 3...2...1...
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I haven’t done that quest yet, why would it help with caps?
---
not that i am aware of personally
---
I don’t see myself doing that... oh well :(
---
Neat
---
I still don't understand why they attached a terminal to it.  The actual machine part looks cool on it's own and the same dialog that OP is presenting could still be accessed by button press on it.  It's one of the weirdest CAMP objects to place due to the width of the machine plus terminal combined and there's always an awkward gap between them.
---
Came here trying to find out what it stood for.  
---
It could be Superfluous Calendar of Optional Rewards Earning.
---
Or maybe Shamanic Cube-shaped Omnidirectional Ragnarok Emitter.
---
he was doing ACP and ACP must drop 3*
---
YES!!! And I'd appreciate it if we had a Slocum's Joe brewing station with that. How great it would be to have him bring me my coffee!!
---
It would help you get SCORE with repeatable XP
---
Pretty sure it's supposed to collect only the types of scrap involved in the current event. Steel, concrete, cork, plastic, wood, cloth, leather, and glass. I have only the BOS and standard collectrons and I was able to see the BOS collection option on my standard collectron.
---
WHAAAAAAAAAAT????
---
What what?
---
I just want it off of the personal terminal. It is so hard to read for me with the tiny font and zeros that look like 8s. I think we all know that the calibers are not alphanumeric. I have no problem reading the normal in-game terminal. 
---
I also want a slider and to see how much ammo I have.
---
legendaries don’t often randomly appear in lower level areas, so if you are lower level, then yes, events like leader of the pack are your best bet (4 legendary wolves). 
---
I’d level and up, there are many events with legendaries, But just roaming the WS cottages Can yield up to 5, and there are other locaions where lone legendaries are known to randomly appear.
---
I've been screaming at my monitor trying to get staircases and shit flush with the ground or other objects for weeks now going WHYYYY can't I just raise or lower this?!
---
Surprise! I totally can. Thank you lol
---
AzJonnyG
---
you will. trust me brother. you will. 
---
and you enjoy EVERY FUCKING MINUTE
---
welcome to the endgame.
---
As you have correctly pointed out, the person in your scenario is like that because he is an asshole, and *not* because he is bloodied. Correlation doesn't equal causation.
---
- People are telling bloodied/junkies to just suck it up, and are happily throwing them under the bus.  
---
- People are also claiming that most players are bloodied/junkies.  
---
- I have never once encountered a bloodied/junkie's player who wasn't very supportive of the idea of buffing all the other builds to make them viable and competitive (even if they lost their spot as the meta).  
---
- I also haven't seen any bloodied/junkies players who aren't willing to shave a bit off the top *within reason*.  
---
So all these people have decided to cut off their nose to spite their face by attacking and alienating "most players" who were supportive of them getting a buff.. And the hill they are choosing to die on is a global nerf because devs are too clueless and uncreative to balance builds at around 7/10 so they are dragging them all down to 3/10. 😐
---
Whether you agree with that or not doesn't really matter, cos it isn't actually my point... my point is  
---
#You can't "nerf" asshole!  
---
But you *can* sure as hell **add** to their numbers by creating more of them..
---
If you're not sure if they're in it, watch for the scared emote 👍
---
The nuke countdown gives you 3 whole minutes to get out.  If you don't want to be at ground zero of a nuke, leave before it lands.
---
That’s awesome! How good is internet out where you are?
---
How low? Just started an alt, like lvl 15 or something
---
I call it murder farming , find an area with a horde of enemies and kill them all server hop and repeat. Events like radiation rumble awol armaments and the Queen are great places too but very much depend on character build level and capability. Server hopping is your friend, find someone on your friends list that isn’t on your server and join theirs if you get stuck in the reloading the same server loop
---

---
This is what I run. Full uny armour and sit at 19% health. Blocker and serendipity mitigate a huge amount of Incoming damage and the sneak bonus of covert op and sandman along with nerd rage give u a huge damage boost. Your always in a team and u should be using a lot of mutations so that’s why the buffs in luck and charisma to boost and keep those mutations. I can solo Earle and 1 shot pretty much everything in the game. Takes 3 shots to drop a flying scorchbeast. Bloodied weapons help but u can run this with a basic modded combat rifle and 1 shot super mutants easily.
---
I wanna give to actual new players unfortunately
---
Wtf was this dude using
---
That's how I realized one of my team mates was still inside.
---
I understand now thanks!
---
You know what I meant. Ultracite versions of "conventional" ammo. And has anyone else noticed that it's just replacing the words "depleted uranium" from military ordinance and putting a sci-fi word instead? Why aren't we refining some of that "plain old" nuclear material to craft bullets? Did that somehow stop being an improvement?
---
Oh, and before someone says "that wouldn't hurt glowing creatures", depleted uranium does more damage because of its increased *density*, not from being radioacive. Or, more accurately, gets through armor. It doesn't do "less damage" to unarmored living targets, because of hydrostatic shock. You could wind up bursting a heart valve just by shooting someone in a limb.
---
edit: we are all big water balloons
---
Pretty solid. The phone company laid fiber optic cables about 10 years ago so it’s never an issue unless the power goes out.
---
GL
---
Bushwookie builds are better!
---
Right there with ya! Kiting all those wendigo is so damn satisfying
---
Nope it will just shuffle to new prefixes like it always had. Magic has been around since the first rubber band fix. Everytime they "fix" it more magical shit appears to the point we are at now.
---
Please stop humiliating my game. -Todd, probably
---
Most bloodied people are lovely, there are quite a few I’ve had the misfortune of meeting who are cocky and are assholes the whole group shouldn’t be lumped in though. I was just telling people not to get cocky because especially if you run a low health character someone with anti armor and tank killer will rip you in half.
---
Excellent.
---
This will be impossible real soon.
---
14 seconds will become 14 minutes bwhaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Between the framerate tanking and the constant rads even in power armour, it's the most stressed I've been in this game. Need some bigger guns I think.
---
Yea only way to avoid it is to pay for private server
---
Funny thing is after you find the third transponder you go through glassed cavern and fight a SB that "can't" fly. It's mostly just lots of waves of scorched then at the end you fight a SB.
---
How do you know that 98% of players don't use it?
---
Ahh gotcha, was seeing if you needed help with something! Best of luck 👌🏼
---
Instigating rifleman is what I’ve settled on after playing basically every build imaginable, ammo efficiency and full health being the major benefits
---
problem for them is that many of us just gave up with the daily childish grind crap
---
I don't know how anyone can get to level 65 and be completely unaware that being in the nuke zone when it lands will kill you.
---
I hav an suppressors explosive lever with a silence.  
---
missed shots make a splat type sound, but so far, it has not cause me to change from hidden to caution.
---
However, firing too many shots (rapidly) from the same location will (and compared to other enemy types, mole rats and rad scorpions are still much better at finding you).
---
You're right, of course - I was just completely unprepared. My CAMP is up near Top Of The World, and I'm so used to nukes dropping up there in my peripheral vision while I'm hanging out at home that I didn't even think to check where it was due to land until it was too late.
---
No worries😂 I’m down to my last drop I’ve been server hopping for 2 hours giving players 50 of each
---
" you're fun is wrong!"
---
Oh no, I’m working on a decent build and I have decent armour and stuff. The issue is the gauss miniguns insane ammo consumption lol
---
Mines PaladinCiel
---
Wadsworth please 😭
---
just go pickup a bunch of junk items and go sell them at the wayward to duchess or the responder robot in flatwoods
---
Freeloader
---
that's if your quick enough, and to be fair i have done this and it's hilarious to see 😂
---
Just never been in that situation before. I barely use my power armour and never gone anywhere nuke sites so far. The whole thing was completely my fault, for sure. Just hopped on for an hour to get some questing done and got caught unawares.
---
Thats why i said "find" a fix , they have never implemented a fix specifically for the "magic" weapons
---
140 is the lowest before it becomes way to unreliable. You can still have it work sometimes with 120s.  
---
Lots of testing, A TS FFR penta gauss will be magic but a tri will not always be maybe every 5th server or so. But yes the faster the fire the rate the better/faster the effect is.  TS FFR mini with an accel rules the magical world with 1 solid exception being a zealots primed UGL TS FFR for the queen but that is a one off specific.   
---
Hrm now I wonder if ghoul slayer works on ACP....
---
Yea I get it, that's why I'd like to see a pop up warning and the option to loot would be red and say steal like if you lock pick someone camp
---
I wish he could collect my corn, tatoes and mutfruit so I can cook it into adhesive. That would be awesome.
---
How is challenging someone to fight being cocky?
---
Oh...  
---
I totally stole someone’s items then. 
---
Random container by the purveyor had a ton of decent shit in it. Figured it was someone leaving a low level treasure.
---
Fucking glad I fast travelled home then! I'll go back tomorrow and have a look, better prepared this time.
---
Same with Duchess and that Old Opossum shirt/jacket.
---
I probably should have added a bit more sorry on my end, he was talking about how he could destroy me without using a full clip and shit like that.
---
Never beg. No one likes panhandlers, especially for something as easy as that.
---
Join a public team, you’ll get caps when your teammates do stuff while you shake your cup.
---
I’m a somewhat new player, I’m only level 50, but he broke all of my armor and I can’t even do anything now. I’m practically being forced off the server by this guy and I can’t do anything, a level 200 is griefing me and I can’t do anything about it with my low level weapons
---
I can't even begin to tell you how badly I want that Old Possum shirt.
---
I always recommend having a build as an end goal and at least trying to get your specials to the set amounts, picking up any build perks along the way if you can/want to plan it that much.
---
Other tip: keep a close eye what you store in your stash and look up other's tips or ask that as a separate qirstion if you need help.
---
Ctrl + Alt + De 🙏🤙👍
---
Depends on perspective, they fix the rubber banding by making the numbers magical , when they fix that magic it moves to another weapon. After two years they still haven't been able to "fix it" 45 second queens back in 2018, 45 second queens in 2020. Only difference is the gun I am using.   
---
The primary difference is that this one has a lot more "magic" compared to the 2-3 it normally has. A few times it took specific combos to be "magic"
---
Depends on what you are shooting at and a few other variables.  
---
  For example, I have an AA fixer that pushes 500 against some enemies if it is a sneak attack, but only about 100 if I’m both discovered and hip firing.
---
Sure thing bud. I have some spare. Add me.
---
I’ve got no ambition, for worldly acclaim, I just want a Mr. Handy at my campppp
---
🤦‍♂️
---
/s?
---
People don't know what to do at the event (common with any event that isn't just "shoot that thing") and the rewards are meh, so it often fails.
---
Don't worry about keeping them until you get to level 50 which is when you'll be after legendaries anyway.
---
Some guns cap at lv 45.
---
oh yeah, I've done that before and forgot till i looked at my stats and saw I was 203 and completely missed that milestone 😂
---
That's scary AF actually!
---
GUMDROPS!
---
THEY FIT IN YOUR GUMS!
---
And you’ll be out of range from the Wendigo spawns though sometimes you’ll get hit from one when your 50ft in the air but better then being perma-staggered.
---
If someone is trolling you, you can block them in the social menu and I believe it removes you from their map etc so they can’t hassle you. Or just quit back to the main menu and rejoin, you’ll probably join a different server.
---
I think the simple answer is....it requires work. That is one event you cant really sleep on, so numbers avoid it.
---
worst case scenario, bethesda talked about taking the rewards like the chicken coop and other season rewards and adding them to a gold bullion vendor for people who couldn't make it in time in future updates
---
There’re in the same tab as sitting and standing gorilla under floor decorations. Just look carefully
---
Just explore, try out perks and do whatever feels fun till level 50 or even 100.  The first 100 are 100% the best period of playing this game, enjoy it.
---
Only reading this post did I actually work out I was missing a tape and finished this quest! I had all the numbered tapes and just thought it was bugged
---
There shouldnt be any loot drop to getting killed by player, nor a caps reward...
---
but pvp is poinless as is anyway, so...
---
take away the thing's that force people to lvl up in nw, or play it for "x time"  and ppl may play nw for the pvp 
---
its like the bloodied build, you give ppl a easy path or a hard path and they will always (or almost always) take the easy path. amount of time in (nw) game is the easy path to xp and if your only reason to be there is x time in game or lvl gain ...
---
IIRC lvl 62 is the half way point due to each level requiring more score. So it’s probably practically impossible unless you spend atoms
---
You are lying.
---
Everyone at the event completes the event,when  Earle is killed.
---
They just never got to loot a shitty Golf Club,or Cursed Shovel from Earle.
---
I do this event 4,5,times a day.
---
I dont even bother running from the mine anymore after Earle is killed.
---
I wait around looting Wendigos until the clock runs down and i die,i am then re-spawned outside the main entrance to the Mine .Often quicker than others.
---
I receive all my rewards as normal.
---
I have also been killed during the event. in the last few seconds of the event
---
You are re-spawned directly outside the access to the event.Which has now become blocked.
---
Again you just miss looting Earle.
---
But still complete the main event.
---
Or just switch worlds by going in and out. Or if your a fo1st member just get on your private server. Because of how wonky leveled mobs are when a high level pc is around I doing most of my play time there
---
Thanks for the insight. I have seen it get higher. Oh well next time
---
Noob question: why luck?
---
No you doofy fuck this is why we can't have nice things.
---
High level AND your damage output is getting a big nerf!  Enjoy!  :D
---
Yes and no. You spawn relative to the location of the C.A.M.P. module itself. Play around moving the module within your build area. I find it seems to be generally a bit to the NE of the module
---
Once I worked this out this is the first thing I do when trying out a new camp location - drop the module, walk a bit away and fast travel back to see where it drops me.
---
I think it was a “bad” nuke. You can nuke the queen and fight her outside of the Rad zone of the nuke so you take no rads when fighting her.
---
Rusty LaChance, I'll be on in like 4 or 5 hours once I get off work
---
Edit: lvl 247 I think I dont really pay attention anymore
---
When in doubt, vats the queen in the head enough to get credit then jump on the fence and VATS all the little stuff wandering around attacking the gunners. That little stuff can be a pain to target and hit with a wind up weapon and  visibility in power armor with a big gun is limited. As in real life I can't seem to see my toes. And if you take down cave crickets quickly you'll be a hero to a lot of people.
---
I'm not passing judgement on it one way or the other. I don't have an issue with either. Just stating why it didn't work last time.
---
Possibly. Could have also been a duped dropping of unneeded stuff.
---
Movement speed perks are mostly pointless because if you have speed demon your already max movespeed, the game will only let you get +20 movement speed. Anything higher causes issues with the game haha.
---
go look around player vendor for a fixer or a fixer plan.  fixer+chinese armor means you will be stealthed 95% of time so take advantage of it.  stack stealth and stealth dmg perk in agility
---
I'm fine with that. Ammo is the one thing in this game that I would like to see every vendor have 100,000 duped priced at 0. Ammo hunting and crafting takes up way too much time in this game.
---
You will do less damage, everything got nerfed.  It was incredibly dumb to do half of a re-balance, the half that just make everyone weaker leaving the other, quite frankly much more important, much more fun for players half at some nebulous future date.    
---
It just seems like a recipe for unhappy players for no good reason.
---
Just like i said they have never specifically addressed magic weapons, perspective has nothing to do with it
---
Shopping at 3AM can be a dangerous thing!
---
Dumb question, where can i find a gold bullion vendor?
---
I'm not on my pc atm so will have to be later on however a good YouTube you can always trust is angry turtle. I'm sure he'll have a heavy gunner build in a video.
---
Agree, it is unrealistic that I need to feed my character 12 ribeyes and 20 quarts of water a day. And also that they spoil in a day if I don't have the stupid Good with salt perk on. This is just another way to make the players' more miserable.
---
Having a limited amount of gold, but already having good armor, to provide an immediate bump in stats,  i started with underarmor + the shielded lining mod.
---
Shielded provides +15 DR, + 15 RR, + 15 ER, +4 STR, +4 on another special, and +2 on a 3rd special.
---
SS limbs had better DR than the limbs I had, so I bought those next, then started rolling for the effects to match the benefits of the armor I was using.  Then I bought the buttressed mod for better DR (53 dr, 53 er, and 53 rr per piece
---
Out of the box, the SS chest had lower DR (90) than what I already had (117), so it was the last piece I replaced.
---
Now working on the gold for the buttressed mod for it, which boosts the DR to 115.  (ER/RR are 60 each on the non buttressed version)
---
Craft with Armorer3 if you have it (added durability).
---
theres one in foundation and inside crater
---
Is there anything that triggers the insult bot? I have 120 hours in the game and I’ve only seen him twice and I enjoyed both interactions.
---
Noted, cheers!
---
Thanks, ive got all this gold from the legendary run and didnt know how to spend it haha
---
I offered to help him so he friend requested me, invited me to a party, joined my server then wasted my time. He was nowhere to be found. What a joke.
---
You don't technically need to fight it though.  I did that mission sort of under leveled and you can just run past it and grab the holotape or whatever it is you are supposed to pick up and then get out.
---
He'll only show up at random encounter locations.
---
but they have, they have fixed the magical weapons then rubberbanding was bad again so they fixed that which caused new magical guns which they have fixed then rubberbanding again to more magic guns. The patch notes are there and look up on here about how rubber banding is back.   
---
So now they have just left it alone instead. I am sure they will get around to a "fix" but that means more rubberband complaints (while 1-3 types of guns are still magic) and boom they will fix the rubber banding and back to a new set of magic.   
---
It is a cycle.
---
They could have just added scrappable ammo that gives an appropriate equivalent amount of junk already used to craft other ammo. Done.
---
They are only at Foundation, near the entrance to where Paige is at and at The Crater in The Core. Youll nees to complete the Vault Raid to actually use them I believe.
---
Don't think I saw any crickets. Mostly Scorched and ants, and some Radtoads. But honestly it was so chaotic that I couldn't make much out at all, will have a look for a fence next time, cheers.
---
All the crit perks sit in luck, as well as super duper, bloody mess and lucky break
---
Oh. Weird. Good to know!
---
You are fine on the -VATS cost mods.
---
Without the silencer, I think you'll only get that first shot bonus, as you would be detected by the gunshot sound. With a silencer attached to the muzzle mod slot, you can get multiple shots before (if ever) getting detected.
---
For at the later levels, perks like Crit Savvy, Better Crits, Grim Reapers Sprint... There's a bunch of really great perks for commando/rifleman
---
Yeah I don't really understand why we can't have a robot at our camp. I can build a nuclear fusion generator, advanced computers but no robot? wtf?
---
Keep the downvotes comin’ junior.
---
I'd be up for a scrap with it, just not after that clusterfuck, was much happier going home!
---
TSE lasers can literally break within 1-2 reloads
---
I would not be happy with the scorpion boss that would be in the sandstorm.
---
\*hides in a corner piling cushions over himself so he doesn't get seen\*
---
Nice!!
---
Probably the explosive, I'm not certain but I'm pretty sure the explosive can cause vampires to proc independently 
---
Either way I'm not a fan of the tommy gun, find it too ammo hungry
---
Having only read a little about it, I’m mixed feelings.
---
  I like being able to backtrack to camp in a low level area and relax, without having.  To worry about encountering high level mobs,or high level critters attacking my camp, having a ‘safe haven’ while crafting, etc.
---
One will apparently change that, and not sure how much I’ll miss the R and R time.
---
It's only in ops though, right?
---
Explosive does proc a second vamps
---
&gt;Seems weird that you would access a terminal, zoom into it, just to have a vendor interface pop up.
---
I mean technically player vendor machines are terminals. We don't zoom into the screen but the display looks like a computer monitor.
---
Bloodied is the worst possible build for pvp lol
---
I need a liberator. It'll be unstoppable
---
Wheres the shitter?
---
1) after an insane amount of grind
---
2) only in daily ops and not enough to supply you for the rest of the game
---
It's an open world game, no matter what game it is there will always be people who play to make your time worse
---
Honest question. Why would you want those bars at 0?
---
Thx a lot
---
Definitely make a plan beforehand. Everything in the endgame is a slogfest, so anything you can do early will be good later on. This is especially true if you don't plan on investing in intelligence.
---
I'll look into that but thank you, I only use them to help take out hoards
---
Yeah i have the mutation that lets me do more damage when my hp is low cant remember the name off the top of my head, put that with sneak x2 damage plus maxed rifle cards i do a good amount of damage but was just curious if there was a better sniper than marksman out there. Definatly gonna get a new fixer tho i got rid of one a while back as i wasnt using it much and needed space in my stash, dam that stash box 😁
---
That’s me! I don’t do it because I honestly have no idea what to do lol The couple of times I did going in blind, it didn’t work out. I know I could easily google/YouTube on what to do but I’m just...lazy, for now? I’ll try my best to learn though, and will start showing up at the event!
---
*no support*
---
Not that much grind.  Ammo in general really isn't that hard to get.
---
Is it still possible to find bloodied weapons now i havnt come accross one at all yet, did they get taken out of the game
---
Unfortunately enough
---
To be honest, I liked the original converter best
---
Yeah the problem it seems is having enough players doing it and knowing what to do its seems like a complicated event
---
I’m new to the lingo what’s proc?
---
So you are saying you stood there for nine hundred hours just trying to get cake, or more like twenty minutes in total trying?
---
Aw man... It'd have been so rad getting to zip all over the map! Oh well. Either way, goes to show where my head is at. :) Perks that allow for builds that are unique and different. Let people use abilities that match what they're going for in a character.
---
When I am faced with these questions.  I run a test.   Pick a site then run it with one weapon,  server hop and run it again with the other.   
---
Pick the one the works best.     If you need to run it again.
---
I've got an instigating black powder.  It's a beast sniper. 
---
I'm not selling it though!
---
Stealth is absolutely idea for this event - but sadly, others can spoil it.
---
In a group, the bloodied railway is fine - but you'll need to watch your positioning and status. I suspect the Furious combat rifle is just a bit better than the hunter's if you are finding you can't handle the attention you get when the railway pops you out of stealth.
---
Mind you, what you might consider is simply using BOTH.
---
1/ Use the furious most of the time
---
2/ Build up a crit
---
3/ Swap to railway and burst all 10 into his head, with crits
---
4/ Repeat
---
This is something I've wondered. What is the point of the tax from a gameplay point of view? Just one more thing to make progress less enjoyable or take longer?
---
I have 214 I get rid of 20 a day and gain about 10 every day.
---
That's a good idea, I'll do it next time I load up the game, don't want to have to take over the thunder Mt workshop and do the event again 😂
---
proc = cause the effect to go off.
---
Everyone here acting like they haven't taken a swing at a MFer once or twice.
---
No there is no way you can. I've tried.
---
I've come across Digger as a legendary twice now in the vault raid. Gotta be quick to kill him before the secret service boys do though. Probably no way to kill a vendor though. What kind of vendor like in Whitespring or like a traveling merchant guy
---
Love it man - the preparation and everything is almost more fun than the event when you you take on things like this.
---
Yeah the level system fucking sucks when it comes to mobs. If a higher level player went through there before you then the enemies will be around their level. In the next update they are changing it to where they will be your level to you but to a different player it will be their level.
---
It basically means activate, so the explosive effect can cause the vampires effect to active, just using this instance as an example
---
Blueprinting also works, as well as placing that object anywhere else and then moving it to where you want it to be. Sometimes the navmesh freaks out and you’ll have to put the object on a flatter ground first before you can put it under the stairs or on the porch exactly. I have done the blueprinting thing, it does work. Just takes more time than the way I do it! Cheers bud!
---
That makes sense, and I hadn't considered that.
---
It would feel very normal for Fallout to have a toothless ghoul who rewards you for bringing them gumdrops for exactly that purpose. I wasn't the least bit surprised when I encountered Harold in Fallout 3, having played the original three PC versions close to their release dates.
---
I even played that really crappy console game that doesn't belong in the franchise. The one that had energy drink ads in it (real world energy drinks, not Fallout drinks). I felt a bit sorry for one of my friends who had worked on Fallout Tactics, because the game was so much more buggy than either of the first two games.
---
Hello, I'm from Los Angeles, and we make video games here :-)
---
What's the good reason for it being at 0?
---
OCDecorator and Spring Cleaning should have just become part of the workshop system after 4.
---
Where do you find the keys to the cells?
---
As far as I'm concerned none of this post makes sense to me, which is quite impressive actually!
---
Ahh ok thanks I'm at the point where I pick sides but haven't completed the raid yet
---
I really don't know why people struggle to get ammo, I use [50.cal](https://50.cal) ultracite and have 250,000 rounds and enough flux farmed for another 500,000, I throw away maybe 5-10k rounds outside stations everyday for people to take, we have so many sources for ammo yet people struggle still, I don't get it.
---
They are buffing the enemies and it’s gonna be even harder for non bloodied builds to kill stuff
---
They have never once stated that changes were to fix magic weapons, i repeat never stated changes were to address magix weapons
---
1500 hours in the game. i like to think i have an idea what stuff sells for. 
---
unfortunately the 1% dictate the prices and us 99%ers have to follow.
---
I often run places like west tek or the burrows for nice legendaries. The issue with these rooms is if someone on they server has run them the chances of getting legendaries are smaller despite the enemy respawning. You have a better chance of getting them if you're on a private server.
---
I've gone through both places on a private server and have walked out with a number of legendary weapons.
---
But know too organic legendary drops are less likely to be as nice as something dropping from a major battle like Colossus. Likewise RNG on the legendary vendor seems less stubborn then organic drops.
---
If youre looking for scrip, it's better to save caps and buy crap legendaries from other players.
---
That was a great piece of storytelling! I laughed out loud. Keep at it, Wastelander
---
TSE lever breaks really fast also
---
Well that is what I do. But the fact of the matter is that I have more treasury notes than I can ever hope to redeem.
---
I think everything should be cheap so we can all help each other out.
---
They are already available for purchase from the settlers and raiders on the PTS. it’s possible they will be added with patch 22.
---
check up on your lore, sweetie. modus hasn‘t done anything to contain the scorched. in fact, the enclave unleashed the scorchbeasts.
---
Thanks man just scrolled by gorillas
---
I prefer to keep my inventory full of stuff I find and not full of food and water. I keep a small amount of each on me in the event I need to fast travel. I shouldnt have to go to my camp every 2 minutes to dump everything just to keep food on my character (which at that point, since I am at camp every 2 minutes anyways I still wouldnt need to keep it on me).  
---
TLDR: Backpack is for junk not food
---
You can’t be 1 shot by a level 500 in adventure mode unless you’ve fired back and have a level 5 toon as the damage is capped
---
I would go even further ! I not only want a Mister Handy as a camp partner...i want him to collect my ressources ! 😢
---
I fought my first SBQ a couple months ago and it maybe didn't go that bad but still pretty bad haha. west by south west of that bunker is a little shack with a work bench outside of it I use to scrap stuff. FYI. Also, I highly enjoy it by this point. I'm a level 169 now and while I occasionally do ACP, I like making the silo runs to do Scorched Earth. My camp is a 2 cap fast travel from that bunker, and at this point I'm running a bloodied build and can take out any scorchbeast with minimal effort. Queen still takes some effort but not like it used to. I have never solo'd her, someone else always shows up but I have done it with as few as 2 others. You want more flux? Gotta wander around the nuke zone harvesting plants and killing bad guys for the high rad fluids, hardened masses and glowing masses. I love it lol
---
the trade forum has a list of blacklisted gamer tags. 
---
scammers mostly.
---
You would lose your character then, as you would respawn hungry and die again instantly. Beth likely to do it lol.
---
After you complete the raid, you can also exchange caps for bullion at the second floor of The Wayward, a fella called Smiley, cheerful guy but seems like he's up to something more nefarious. 
---
6000 Caps will net you 300 bullion.
---
Well then maybe 2-3 shot with an automatic weapon, as i died instantly.
---
Eckhart unleashed 'em, MODUS killed him and gave us access to the nukes, which helped us take down the queen multiple times, ergo slowing down their advance
---
Then u must have been taking a workshop. So opted in PvP. Wanted. So opted in PvP or shot him first
---
I would also like to get more gold from Smiley as long as if I have the caps. The daily purchase limit of 200 notes is ridiculously low, should be 500-1000.
---
It’s what legendarys crave.
---
That's the spirit!!  It is a good test to see how your weapons stack up and you can cheese the fight by taking pot shots and hiding behind cover......unless it glitches out and flies in the ceiling raining scorchbeast pee on your head lol.
---
Best advice is to play on console not pc (if that's an issue)
---
After that, this game rewards patience. Don't just run and gun if you're new. Hang back a little. The way the circle works is it pushes you into fights. More often then not you find yourself in a 3 way skirmish and a high chance of being pinned between two teams. 
---
Try to keep your back to the fire and have the high ground. 
---
Use the fire as a defense wall; sometimes it closes in on a space that would allow a player to take the high ground preventing them from coming up to you.
---
Go into adventure mode and create some blueprints to be used during battle. I can't count how many times a quick build saved my butt.
---
If on a PC map one of your mouse buttons to a stimpak.
---
If you're a heavy gunner use third person. It's tough to get used to but you get a zoom advantage you don't normally get in first person. The 50 turns into an auto sniper rifle.
---
Grenades are helpful. If not to kill it def scares a MF and moves them.
---
No bright cloths. Believe it or not camouflage works the way it's intended in NW.
---
There are more tips but that's just off the top of my head.
---
I bought it a couple of months ago and I don't play it anymore. The game is incredibly boring and there's still tonnes of bugs.
---
Red truck, down the hill on the right.
---
I use a silenced explosive handmade all the time and there is not noticeable change in stealth from silenced explosive vs silenced conventional bullets.
---
Because we done it a million times already and the event itself is just alright.
---
It's so simple Bethesda can't make it. 1000 times better than what they gave us.
---
I laughed way too hard at this.
---
I really like this. Bonus points for the Wendigo plush. Every camp is instantly improved by those. :)
---
You didnt happen to receive an executioners baseball bat on New River Gorge Bridge did you?
---
It is a random. Other things spawn there also.
---
Are you on a particular quest? She normally is in the crater, main building.
---
That one I did once, and never bothered again.
---
Yes, the finding Ra Ra quest in preparation for the raid on Vault 79
---
Perfect!
---
No, I was outside my workshop (no defenses there) and was shot and died instantly. He didn't even try to take the workshop before shooting me. I respawned close-by and got a notification to defend my workshop from him. And before i got back there I had my workshop back. So i would assume, he killed me, tried to take the worshop, and got annhiliated by the turrents surrounding it. It's only a guess though.
---
I’m not sure whether to laugh or cry lol. Happy it’s gotten better 😊
---
I loved the 'Nuka-Cola Its Got My Blood In it'. I just wish the Overseer made a comment about it when you choose that option. Something along the lines of 'What where you thinking?! No one is going to want to drink that now!' 
---
Sadly that was not the case.
---
I’m not familiar with that are in particular, however, if that deathclaw spawns there every single time. Every server. No matter what. Then it’s not a random encounter, that’s a spawn point for that specific creature. You can still pacify it, but if you want to take a deathclaw for your camp, it has to be one from a random encounter.
---
Please tell me you have a Junkies build. Keep an eye out in player vendors for the other 2 variations of that Nuka Cola vaccine too, they make a nice display. Everyone and their brother has Nuka Cola flavors on display but almost no one has the complete set from the Wastelanders questline.
---
Look at vending your items as a way to get rid of stuff you don't want. Price them accordingly. If you're going to become a vendor that makes it your mission to sell stuff at market prices you'll need to put some time in different market forums and subreddits to see what the going rate for items are. The market can snap between highs and lows depending on a Bethesda update or the likes. It's always in flux. But generally speaking price things to get rid of it not to make hard caps.
---
EDIT: when doing the above, sell things for slightly over what a venderbot will buy them for. Otherwise what's the point of vending.
---
They are just doing what Bethesda allowed. Hate the game, not the player.
---
On PS4 there's R2, R1 and L1, L2 to allow us to navigate more efficiently with big numbers...
---
First fix for rubber band:   
---
 December patch
---
##### COMBAT
---
* **Weapons:** Addressed an issue that could prevent high-damage and explosive weapons from dealing damage to enemies, or cause enemies to heal immediately after taking damage.  
---
March patch:   
---
* **Exploits:** Addressed an exploit in which certain circumstances could allow players to alter the damage of a weapon with the Mutant’s legendary effect.  
---
This has been a cycle, next will be the prefix fixes than a rubber band fix to which more magical weapons will appear.   
---
&gt; They have never once stated that changes were to fix magic weapons, i repeat never stated changes were to address magix weapons   
---
I mean in the simplest of sense you are correct since it is an exploit (granted one on a massive scale that needs no real replication) and they do not say they are fixing "magic" as that is the term the player base came up with.   
---
Now away with you, I am tired of arguing with stupid.
---
It doesn't spawn there all the time
---
Workshops are pvp areas.  Deal with it.
---
You can still eat and drink world items at least. However, their supposedly getting rid of the starving/dehydrated penalties sometime in the future.
---
After you arrive at your camp fast travel to it a second time. Often this will put you above the cliff where you're meant to appear. That method works great for me when camp hopping and checking vendors.
---
Lol wall of text doesn't make you right and name calling is where at always goes when people are wrong and wont admit it
---
Ra Ra ooh la la. Ra Ra ooh Ga Ga!    
---
She is under Grafton Damn. You have to drop down off the side of the damn near where the marker is. There's a sewer grate.
---
Excellent idea as long as there is actual proof they did the crime
---
I price most non-legendary items at 1/4 to 1/10 of their value. If you can buy it at a vendor don’t go over that value and you’ll probably be fine. Legendary weapons and armor I look them up on nukacrypt Price checker to see what their comparable value is and whether I should sell or trade
---
Also, try leaving build mode and then going right back into it by holding 'V'. Usually it allows me to place it after that.
---
1 piece troubleshooters armor and the highest level troubleshooters weapon you can use.. shoot them in the leg
---
You probably have your audio set as surround sound instead of Stereo. Not sure if there is an in game option for it but your OS or Audio Software will have options to disable surround and play audio in stereo
---
Edit: to further elaborate, the audio you're no hearing when your back is turned to an NPC is playing through 2 none existent channels (rear left and rear right). At least that is my assumption
---
I haven't had a problem with them. I do hate they exist and it's still a problem.    
---
I hate the ones who try to get me to pvp and I won't and they get all butthurt about it. One player was shooting one round at my CAMP just to be annoying and instead of fighting him/her I got close and did nothing. Bored him/her to death and they left.
---
Right, thanks for the deal with it buddy 😘.
---
 Workshops are PvP areas meaning, i can be instantly killed without getting the chance of opting out of PvP?
---
I thought the game allowed players to choose not to defend their workshops when someone is claiming them, therefore opting out of PvP.
---
Visit all of the fissure sites and kill scorchbeasts. Maybe one in three is legendary, you can sneak off if they're not and you don't feel like wasting the time and ammo. Also the houses near Welch Station where the overseer tape is often spawn a legendary sheepsquatch or supermutant.
---
i think its a dick move changing how builds work and then implementing a system that you have to trade in un-used perk cards to get legendary cards is very wrong 
---
basically your making ppl have to change there build and then punishing them for changing there builds
---
It's an easy survival mechanic. Just eat and drink. its not hard...
---
Oh.  No.  If you're in a workshop, you're susceptible to pvp 100% of the time.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Nope.  That pretty much sums up the Gauss Pistol.  It could be great if VATS worked.. at all.
---
That was not a wall of text.   
---
Also are you not stupid? Literally your name is that one **STUPID** guy (emphasis by me)   
---
I have provided facts which are verifiable if you need the links to the patch notes that I pulled from I will provide them, first was 2018 and the second I posted was from 2019 to make your life easier.
---
By "original" you mean the one from Fallout 3 or the terminal in Fallout 76?
---
With mini nukes and missiles, unless you use them, I would just drop them. They are very heavy and I don’t see much demand for them compared to other ammo. I charge 1 cap for all my ammo. 
---
I sell my weapons for cheap as I don’t want my main full of weapons I won’t use. Anything poor I will throw in the scrip machine. Anything valuable I will keep and give to my alt ☺️
---
This looks way better than the one we got.
---
In addition to what's already been suggested, I have good luck pretty often server hopping at Huntersville.
---
The original converter UI in 76
---
Don't you find a bit slow to navigate in it?
---
I don't bother with it unless I have a good team with me. Every single time I have played it, everybody stacked a single place (usually the venison) no matter how many people there were. I once had 7 people show up, I thought "oh shit finally here's my chance for a stimpak diffuser recipe". NOPE, literally every single one of them sits in the venison. I went off to the mole rats by myself but I wasn't able to get all 60 by myself, and I think my mirelurk ended up dying by the time the sheepsquatch went down anyway. It's still good for the treasury notes and the max level legendary, but it's pretty frustrating having to do things alone there
---
Angryturtle
---
Well I have 5 characters and a use for all types of items. I mostly put items I'd use for sale and I price them based on how much I've already paid on a similar item or how much I'd be willing to pay. Which is usually around 2-3k caps maximum. I had to spend some money on a character today and bought a really nice revolver for my gunslinger for 5k but I don't usually pay that much.
---
I’m afraid he’s right. By taking a workshop you agree to PvP. Keep pacifist on and nobody can hurt u outside of workshop areas. That’s not griefing it’s part of the game mechanics
---
*How may I serve you, master?* *^(Even though I don't really want to...)*
---
Huh, learned something new today
---
It should be a random, many things can spawn there.   
---
You could always server hop dyer chem the road to the left where you spawn has a random event and I have seen deathclaws there a few times.
---
My junkies/aim damage one is not too bad. Are you charging it or rapid firing it? I'd imagine rapid fire is a lot worse. I only use mine at range, I have other stuff for up close that doesn't explode in my face.
---
Ok if you say so but I heard them complaining in chat but whatever. All I can go off is what I heard
---
I too played Brotherhood of Steel, and I enjoyed it, but it was a trainwreck I only enjoyed because I was a child.
---
There are area level caps. Your level 6 enemies are not turning into level 100. Concern is fine, but there is no need for drama.
---
Totally fair. Im appalled by people who wants more pvp in this game, where Nuclear Winter exists!  
---
The only logical way to have "PvP" in Fallout 76 (From beta to now) is just to have a duel system, or have a very strict Survival servers. In both, there would be no legendary effects, magic perks, etc and NO cap or loot exchange/drop, Maybe some little junk or aid and few caps in survival mode. but in duel, everything beneficial would be cancelled, including VATs, no carry limit, no aid item or buff item other than stims and rad chems maybe. Still pointless but at least PvP would make some sense, and this would eliminate grifing ADHD kids who wants to kill unsuspecting average players with their over-glitched, over-leveled, perhaps even cheaty stuff.
---
No. It sucks. Was pretty excited when I got my BFFR Gauss pistol after two or three tries. It’s sat in my stash since.
---
How to you get to keep them? One player gave me one and I kept it just for fun.
---
I’ve been using it to stay alive in APC. It works very well.
---
I see angryturtle is often recommended, but I also recommend riflegaming. He's got a couple build videos and a couple tip videos, bit good best content are his nuking experiments.
---
Angry Turtle is the best in my opinon. He will show you all his tests. He fn loves this game.
---
Literally he was shot in every different power armor 10 times each by the same super mutant to show you there was no big difference between T65 and excavator Power Armors.  Once I saw that i knew he was my guy.
---
That's not how it works at all
---
If you have a workshop, you agree to pvp, if you don't understand that how is it bethesda's fault?
---
A lot of people did, but honestly, once you selected an ammo type you had a lot of, you could just keep spamming the button and it was easy
---
Herald of Faith - I'm up to about anything too.
---
You can craft the one you choose the name for during the quest after you finish it.
---
can't wait until we dont have to feed and water our mules
---
I've got too much stuff and I want to move it fast.    
---
My stuff tends to be really cheap. I did get a 3 Star Gatling Gun from the Purveyor last night I put at 2000caps. I try to sell Legendaries I won't use b/c I know other players can benefit. I know what effects are crap and what most people look for.    
---
I have the ammo maker so I'm covered in what I use. I've put up ammo and usually all kinds for 1cap each.    
---
I want at least 200lbs free so I can start putting more gear both normal and Legendary in. I have plans to make one machine for levels 1-25 gear and 26-50 gear. The first one will be relatively cheap but the 2nd will be higher. If you're poor after 25 it's your own fault.    
---
I'm looking for a Right Leg Legendary replacement. I would prefer Scout armor and depending on effects but like you post it's about helping one another. I sold a lot of stuff last night and managed to get back over 10,000 caps which is my cushion caps point.    
---
I don't mind making something if I have most of the mats or they bring me what's needed. I have a lot of alcohol recipes as well. I can make the Fixer and might have put the one I got from the quest for sale as I got a 2 Star Quad Fixer.    
---
I'm on PC and my CAMP is N of the Wayward and along the river. PM me and I'll help how I can.
---
That's the one I was looking for but after this, I'm over it. Hopefully they fix it but I won't hold my breath.
---
Its hard to get enough to sustain me for a day
---
In 76?  No.  New Vegas reuses a lot of tracks from the older Fallouts, but I don't think a single one of those is in 76.
---
What kind of ammo?
---
Without the option of ignoring the player and just moving along?
---
So they have a hunter/hunted station, they prevent a player in a team to drag all his teammates into PvP with a recent update, they ask you repeatedly if u want to engage in PvP when someone is shooting at you, they explicitly say that claiming a workshop can drag you into PvP. They also push to claim workshops for the legendary run, but then if someone walks into your workshop they can kill you instantly?
---
I am genuinely confused by this, since it's the first time i hear that a workshop area is an automatic PvP without the chance to walk away.
---
Strafe left or right and get close as you can to the assaultron.  It eill switch to its blades.  And its easier to avoid it beam since it turns slow.
---
No way, I'd say. Sorry.
---
Usually when I go there there's the glowing one in the center of the lake and 3-4 in the surrounding area. Might just be my luck though.
---
poseidon energy workshop. Take the factory and unlimited cores.
---
Brotherhood quests, power plant workshops. If you get a power plant workshop you can build a fusion core extractor and just wait for them. I always have extras but if I notice I'm down to 4 or 5 I just go do heart of the enemy and line in the sand.
---
EDIT: Plus it doesn't hurt to check other players vendors. can find them cheap there sometimes
---
The actual black powder rifle, yeah. It's just RNG, extremely low chance of getting the one you want specifically but it is possible. If you mean the dragon, that one can only drop as a 1* from monster mash rewards. Although I can not confirm whether or not that is still true after the latest changes to the drop pools in the previous update
---
Just leave the workshop area.  If you're outside of it's bounds, you can ignore pvp.
---
Did I say it was Bethesda's fault?
---
Happens a lot on pc.
---
My question is geared more toward in game head canon, but it makes sense from a gaming perspective to balance the economy. Much like how a currency begins to be devalued if you print too much money, the game is constantly adding caps out of nowhere into the economy, so therefore we need a way to take caps out of the economy.
---
Just heal everyone and have fun:)
---
Thats pretty cool for solo play, I LOVE getting fresh, unlooted places. I actually really liked playing on private server for a month, and realized how full of loot was most locaitons. but after a while, i realized i do want and enjoy player interactions, and i mean in Both ways where i gain caps by selling stuff and also helping other friends or low levels, and making friends.
---
number of friends I make thru online games is quite small but Fallout 76 is quite possibly one of the biggest.
---
There are better places to get acid.  I farmed like 800 yesterday in an hour or so.  It's not too bad.
---
I’ve had my allies act like I’m a visitor to my own camp. It’s probably a bug along the same lines. Something didn’t load in right somewhere.
---
To drive your enemies in PA before you, to pull them from the corpse of your enemies and to hear the lamentations of their women...
---
Or take over a power plant workshop preferable on a private world, and make them.
---
You can't level a weapon. Weapons have levels and generally increase in increments of 5, 10, or 15. You have to find, make, or will get better gear through quests. It is leveled so if you're say level 20 99% f the time you'll get a level 15 or 20 item depending on it's level variations.    
---
For the first 10 levels don't bother with maxing out a weapon. In fact, you can find a good modded Sniper/Hunting Rifle in a farm up N of the forest. It's a static spawn unless someone has picked it up. That place also has food, mats, and a small garden.
---
I'm still rather new to the game and have no idea about builds. Care to point me to a guide or some form of explanation?
---
Its risky, but powering up a power plant and capturing it produces fully charged fusion cores. (once you connect it) Another player could try and steal it from you but thats not very common.
---
The one in the mire has the least amount of player foot traffic so lowest chance of having to deal with hostile players.
---
Two good options:
---
1. Take a power-plant workshop, build a fusion generator next to the fusion core machine and power it.
---
2. Get science master perk card 1, and super-duper, and then craft a gatling laser. The core will be included for every laser crafted. You will need the plan : [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Gatling\_laser](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Gatling_laser)
---
Yes, you said that bethesda was doing nothing to deal with griefers and cheaters, the whole reason you made the post was to "expose" people like this when actually you were just being an idiot
---
Yea
---
Thats the beauty of fallout 1st. After you take control of a worshop you can run around in your underwear.  Until the next defend mission pops up.
---
If you are in the list, what do you have to do to get out of it?
---
Travel to fissure site Prime. One core in the dropsite V9 building, another on the platform at Forward station Delta
---
I run at around 8 mbps and I run it fine. It’s just that the download times are long as hell.
---
When there are tons of people in one area like at the queen and you jump there it takes awhile to load in the players and mobs.
---
Try them all haha. I got a sneak sniper/commando, melee/unarmed/archer ninja, heavy weapons, heavy energy weapons and guerrilla/gunslinger.
---
Bro, eyebot all the way
---
Always start a new character with a build in mind.    
---
The Nukes and Dragons site is what most people use. Fill out your build and near the bottom there is a Level by Level Perk suggestion list. Make sure that part is extended and save it for reference.    
---
It is your character but I'd suggest sticking to it for the most part. Many perks are quality of life and situational like Green Thumb, Weapon Artisan, Fix It Good, Ammo Smith Super Duper, and Chemist so they don't need to be equipped until you need to use them.    
---
If you're all melee then any ranged and ammo perks wouldn't be needed and vice versa.
---
556 or 45. For my other character I go through plasma cores like toilet paper lol. I get it, its just how games like this are but I'm just slightly concerned that instead of 30% of my playtime being ammo grind it'll be more like 50%
---
I hate my gatling guns and love my 50 cals.
---
Bruh, you went there..
---
Now I have to replay fallout 3 with all its dlcs.
---
Go for it! I finished a full playthrough a month ago lol
---
Angry turtle does give useful advice, though I sometimes find his accent impenetrable (surely more a hearing issue than a speaking one). Innovsurvivalist is also good, especially for news and her videos are well organized. Juicehead is sometimes useful, though there is a lot of speculation, his videos tend to meander a bit and his voice grates on me, I still watch them.
---
You just have to insert the fuse AND THEN the blood sample and you'll be fine. Read it here and done it twice this week with zero problems.
---
This is a non-issue if you run with pacifist on and avoid workshops.
---
If for some reason you feel the need to take a workshop do so on a private world or expect PvP as a possibility (you actually agree to this by pressing"ok" when claiming it)
---
I totally forgot about the monster mash, I had a 2 shot black powder pistol from there before, I can try see if I can do it again, thanks for the event mention
---
Use to be able to but then people bitched because people would kill them after trading so no one else could get a turn if they were waiting.
---
for legendary items i sell them based on  [these price suggestions](https://fed76.info/pricing/?item=None&amp;effects=None)  and usually put them in my vendor around 500 caps less then the low amount they suggest . for the really expensive things i save them for trade
---
for chems i sell them at half what the game sets the price at
---
for mutation serums i put them in at 420 each based on how much i could sell them to a bot for
---
this helps ppl get items they need and not clear out my vendor just to sell them to a bot
---
And secondly how did you put yours into a settlers it looks cool👍
---
Mr. Gustsy Is Better
---
Thanks, bloodied is enough for me because I'm in a bloodied build👍
---
All of those are easy to craft in bulk, so my guess is that you either aren't using the correct perks, you are farming materials inefficiently, or both.
---
That and the settlers/raiders when you give it to them
---
Cant tame albinos. In fact I have not seen a tamed deathclaw higher than level 21 in over a year. Use to see level 91, even legendary.
---
Thanks for the info. Been there plenty of times, never came across a magazine though.
---
I'm running about 0.5 mbps right now :/
---
Nah, I don't want a stuff English Butler bot judging me. If a bot is going to judge me, let it be a Protectron. 
---
 I like the Protectron's look and voice. It just fits well with the 50s kinda vibe the Fallout universe has. The Robby the Robot style just feels right for the universe. Mr. Handy are fun designs, don't get me wrong, but really a flying robot with a rocket engine? I think that it would probably burn my house down in about 5 minutes after it was turned on, of course, given that this is the Fallout universe, maybe all the carpets were made out of asbestos.
---
Congrats.. always feels good with double zeros ✌️
---
Lawsuits incoming, so make sure that neither your name nor any nicknames are connected in anyway to this register.
---
Also, you'll need to have irrefutable proof, a "simple" video of showing someone cheating is just not enough.
---
As I said above, I prefer to keep my inventory for junk rather than food and water. I shouldnt have to store a bunch of it just to keep my game from crashing.
---
Omg he is clearly exhibiting a dangerous pattern of erratic behavior. We have to boycott prime meat events until pet sloths can live peacefully in Appalachia
---
Hmm idk how that would hold up.
---
That’s kind of what I was wondering lol. Like yeah it sucks but it’s still worth my time to visit when my bullet stash gets too big or I’ve got too many explosives. Every couple weeks I’ll get enough for 10k 50 cal and be on my merry way.
---
what PvP did you really expect from a Fallout game? Im honestly curious. As soon as   
---
I heard about  PvP, i knew it would flop. Fallout is not a game like Rust or 7D2D, or anot other. How does Nuclear Winter not a good scratch for PvP itch? its fallout, its 100% PvP! Lemme guess, because its not where you can make sure you have the upper hand and pick your own fights right? LOL
---
And do you even hear yourself "I spent countless hours farming and gathering to buy all the top gear to then basically be forced to only pvp over worthless workshops."
---
Whats the point of PvP'ing someone who hasnt spend as many hours as you, ez win, andwhats the point of PvP'in someone who spent way more hours than you, ez lose, andWhats the point of waiting for someone who sank similar hours into the game so you can show your "skills" in this glitchy/cheaty environment, or rather compaare your lucky RNG legendaries and googling skills to find the best PvP build ?
---
stop posting here and start xp grinding
---
No prob! There was a pack of three both times.🐻
---
I just stick to my private server now for the most part
---
What is gonna change with patch 22 besides tank killer applying to pistols?
---
Finding out from this thread that a bunch of y’all want that Overseer ayssss. Cold showers for all of you sinners.
---
I’d say that when they add pets, they’d be remiss to not include some robotic options. I, for one, would happily take an Arktos Sentry Bot. Or an Arktos liberator. Or anything Arktos, really.
---
Except Quercus. His voice would get annoying extremely quickly.
---
The ones that aren't in the Forest
---
The version I initially played had *supposedly* fixed the vehicle bugs, except it didn't. When I later played a version that *actually* fixed the vehicle bugs, it changed the gameplay to such a degree as to completely change it. Rolling the vehicle through the map and firing from inside the vehicle, while also having people outside the vehicle either providing support or using the vehicle for cover... you could tell it's how the game was *intended* to be played, and it changed *so much*.
---
I've never even used junkies stuff, I just said that since you mentioned being high enough to do big events. I only now realize you meant level lol.
---
Any public event with a ! on it.  SBQ and the dailies from the factions.
---
Aside from melee, the Gauss Pistol is really the only gun my Gunslinger has to be effective against Earle, and that VATS issue is horrendous.  Once you get it locked, you need to take advantage of it for as long as your AP holds out, because it's a total crapshoot otherwise.  It's absurd.  They added all of this Gauss shit in Wastelanders, and never bothered to verify that it even worked with VATS.
---
Its durability also doesn't last the entire battle.
---
Earle, meat week when it returns
---
SSD is more important
---
Yes do the main story quests. They are rewarding and pretty fun. Very much do the questlines, any and all of them. the vanilla main quest unlocks ALOT of stuff you'll want. The wasteland main quest also unlocks alot of stuff you want. Theres also other really cool questlines like the mistress of mystery one.
---
Also dont stress about the meta because a major balance patch is coming out in like a week or two that'll change all that up.
---
I sell lots of stuff. usually cheap. plans are 9 apiece at my camp except for the expensive ones. If their value is over 1500 than I up it to 50. Chems I sell for half value, except for rad chems then it's 2/9 for diluted/ full strength. Depending on their value, weapons and armor: 1 star legendaries from 50 to 150 2 stars from 200 to 350, and 3 stars from 300 to 500. Except for the more valuable ones then it may go up to 2k. Mutation serums for 250. Junk usually around half value. Except stable flux. If I have extras of those it's usually 200. I try to keep prices low enough to help people out but not so low that my machines are always empty.
---
Angry turtle and captain noob
---
Ohhh looks like today we HUNT!
---
I run with 0.5 mbps in down and 0.2 mbps in up and it's work fine, i don't have problem with lag or wathever, so you should be good too
---
Almost all of the dialogue is fucked.
---
Tip: There’s another key over in Huntersville related to the area, hidden in a third story reachable only by tree.
---
I do use ammosmith and super duper. Plasma cores are a massive pain in the ass to craft because of copper. I go through 556 like crazy because in endgame all there is Earle and SBQ, massive bullet sponges and I always get stuck with people who shoot bb pellets so I have to use 5k+ rounds to do it myself. Again, I get its just a grind you have to do but I wish they weren't making it longer
---
I got so many comments regarding the mechanics of PvP in a workshop, and thank you all for explaining it to me as it's clear I shoudl've known it.
---
Regarding the griefing though, I don't believe there is any reason to kill a player who is 400 lvls lower than you, and then try to claim their workshop. Yes it's the game, but I would gladly block players like that to avoid running into them, therefore I would find it useful to know other players like him and block them.
---
No hard feelings.
---
Workshop is easiest, line in the sand provides 2. There is 2 blood eagles that spawn at sunrise field (if looking south they are at the workshop buildings on the left. One always seems to have an energy weapon it is where I farm plamacores but I get fusion cores often also.
---
Poseidon energy has one that spawns on the bench next to the fusion core gen also.
---
Note: any higher level blood eagle packs normally have 1 heavy gun user I just find it easier to do sunrise since it is part of my daily xp run as a queen spawns in the bog with the cranberries right there, and I always need to make cranberry relish.  
---
Edit: if you are on xbox I can hook you up with 30 since I am sitting on like 60-70 right now.
---
Not to sound like a dick but how on earth do u lot have such bad internet?
---
Good to get a few ideas, but wait until the next patch to make the actual change. Lots of changes coming so make sure you make the right change. Perk points are not to be wasted.
---
That’s roughly 3500 bullion, if I’m doing my math right.
---
Honestly? If you have 5000 bullion already, you’re at the cap, and the notes let you store beyond.
---
Not really an acid farmer myself so I am open to suggestions.
---
Even though the Deathclaw spawns by itself, the other half of the encounter are Super Mutants coming to attack it (and occasionally Blood Eagles). So even though it appears to be alone, it is not.
---
It's not a tame able encounter
---
Haha I’m on it
---
I dont even see an option for changing framerate? If it was unlocked I'd probably very rarely go above 60 with how much shit I have open, but if it is unlocked I guess it's possible to have a weird spike causing this
---
Copper isn't hard to get though.
---
when meat week comes back for the bos event, farm the hell out of the events, you'll het tons
---
I figured from the other responses... thank you anyway
---
on my 2nd character (now my alt) i didn't eve start the main story line until 115.
---
Look up how to start the Into the mystery questline and do that. Amazing questline. best in the game
---
as for a build try and have an idea of what you want. weapon wise. after 50 you can move a point or pick a specific perk every level up so the sooner you start planning the less tinkering you'll need to do later.
---
No idea. I think my house is cursed.
---
If it wasn't it wouldn't be selling for 4 caps+ a piece
---
Just like with salt you have to extract it from reddit comments.
---
Thats good to hear. Maybe I'll give it a try.
---
Ahhhhh that'll probably be why then. Shame because a jet white Deathclaw would look sick
---
The other hand I pretty sure they nerfed the legendary dragon weapons so there is no more legendary dragon, but if there is then it's really rare to find one now.
---
You have to change it in your own graphics card settings so like nvidia geforce for example. However if you don't think your framerate is that high on the first place this might not be the issue.
---
Because you usually get at least 1 bug creature that you need to defend. Those things have less hp than a bloodied build. In the end it isn’t worth it to put in all the effort to get a 1 star armor piece from the boss.
---
You might just be unaware of how to get it efficiently.  Also you said you have a hard time getting it, but then also sell it?
---
SBQ, ACP, Line in the Sand, Feed the people, Campfire tales, Path to enlightenment, Guided Meditation, Crater and Foundation dailies, Photo opportunity, that's what I can think of offhand. But if you do these all you will be way overloaded with treasury notes within a couple days
---
I have read what you sent , only proves my point . They attempted to fix a glitch with one prefix , thanks for proving my point . And i thought you were done arguing with stupid so i will end it for you . Bubye 😶
---
No, but I know what people sell it for
---
It is IGN ThePlanCollectors.
---
If you want to come visit, probably easiest to DM
---
Unfortunately, shitlords need no encouragement...
---
They were under zero obligation to give you ANY free premium currency.....
---
So them reducing the amount being illegal? Is obnoxious, absurd entitlement talk. 
---
They should never have given out free premium currency from the start. It helped entitled fools form the opinion that they were somehow owed them. 
---
Should have brought free atoms along later, then you people might realize that there are a boatload of titles out there that provide none, or next to no free premium currency options, and that any given free by BGS is a nice bonus, not something you are owed.
---
Edit: way to add your "not literal" disclaimer after the fact that you realized you were being absurd.
---
More like everytime you change the amount by moving a slider either way by one point. "Do you want to increase ammo bought by 1?" "Do you want to decrease ammo sold by 1?". Pure Bethesda grade efficiency here.
---
But more Cleese sass
---
I like  Innovsurvivalist. I found her guides really helpful and her news videos tend to be well organized and straight to the point. The videos tend to be divided into segments and you can just go to the segment that you are interested in to find out whatever information you need.
---
I'm carrying 5000 right now and I'm still trying to get gold bullion but still aiming more, help !e😱😱😱 I mean thank God there is no weight, but more gold bullion please
---
It is Good. Way better than the rumour say and the community is great.
---
If you are on Xbox, look me up for tips and tricks and some help with gear if needed.
---
oh was looking for a name to add to friends list to join game
---
I would agree here however I could imagine that laser destroying half my camp each time an enemy spawns
---
For auto rifles use master commando and tank killer. You could also throw on bloody mess and tenderizer to maximize your damage. Use long shot to increase ADS accuracy and ground pounder to increase hipfire accuracy. Pop your psycho or overdrive before fights.
---
If you want cheap easy kills, perk out for the gauss shotgun and M79 grenade launcher. They dish out massive damage and you only have to shoot the floor in the general area of the enemy.
---
Its fun once you give it a chance
---
I got ps4
---
Down 1Mbps it's a mess ! 
---
I have a really really unstable contecion here. I should be at 25Mbps ( Download ) and at 5Mbps ( Upload ). I'm often at 5Mbps/2Mbps or 2Mbps/1.5Mbps.
---
If my download speed or my upload speed is going under 1Mbps...i'm lagging hard. 
---
In fact...it happens everydays ! I can only take a break and wait until it stablelises itself back.
---
[PS4]
---
Craft gattling lasers if you can. it gives you 1 full core. There are some locations accross the map, some unmarked locations where some fusion cores spawn. at low levels, i was near 2 of those locations and would loot each every day, sometimes more than once, it mostly kept me even until i got some perks.
---
But again, the most cores i got was from power plant workshop, around 4-5 am, no one came around and i managed to collect about 80 cores, never farmed again, removed the perks to conserve cores, yet I still have about 50-60 cores on me, after 400-500 hours of gameplay. I only use VATs to waste cores and get rid of almost empty ones actually, so no VATs.
---
yes maxing concentrated fire is big dmg and accuracy bonus.  once you max it, vats head shot 75-95% accuracy is easy to achieve.  as you may know , headshots give you a nice chunk of dmg multiplier.  some enemies like robots have weak spots as torso, not the head.
---
Angry Turtle for testing 
---
Rifle Gaming / TYR / CaptainNoob /SH Games for cool things to do
---
Innvosurvialist / Juicehead for news
---
It's a game mechanic. You're supposed to keep your character fed and hydrated. It's part of the game.
---
It's like saying "my guns should have unlimited ammo, i should have to store a bunch of ammo just to shoot my guns!"
---
Sheer crazy.
---
most of what you heard would have been bollocks from people who either never played it or played an hour.
---
it's a flawed game with problems. but it's great. IMO!
---
Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  It's still really easy to get though.
---
If they ever make this, each recipe will cost 3135 gold boullion and you will be able to use the machine only after getting all the recipes... And of course there's gonna be separate recipes for buying and for selling for each single ammo type.
---
Yeah I run a full set for silos. Its crazy how much better it works than my full vanguards set in there lol
---
&gt; Just like i said they have never specifically addressed magic weapons   
---
Your point was they haven't ever, my point was they have in the past but it keeps getting shifted instead so when they fix this group no one will cry, they will just move to the next set of broken magic guns like they have since December of 2018.   
---
Think you need to change your name to "that one obtuse and stupid guy"  it would be more fitting.
---
Drinkin' Buddy from FO4 &gt; All other bots... 
---
I miss cold drinks..
---
Oh I know....I covet that Deathclaw as a pet SO. BADLY.
---
Is there a way to avoid teleportig? Like more nukashine?
---
I have 2k in my stash if they ever let you give them away HMU I got you
---
Since JH moved into 76 content I've been one of his largest critics, especially when compared to his FO4 stuff.....
---
He and I even had a brief exchange on this sub when I went off about his wild speculation, and him continuing to make content for a game he admitted he no longer enjoyed, and his use of BGS hate clickbait titling.
---
That being said, he's been far better over the last few months. Less speculation, more just news reporting and commentary. Even when he goes into speculation mode, he now makes it pretty clear that he is doing so. 
---
No longer one of my favorite Fallout content creators, but has been getting better.
---
Once you get the unique rewards they become a waste of time
---
I had to feel with that today idk why
---
I actually mentioned the cheaters/griefers issue as a whole, and mentioned that I've read (and had replies) telling me that Bethesda won't deal with them.
---
I also gave 2 examples of incidents that happened today with me, which don't necessarily represent or summarize all the issues faced by other players. 
---
I also mentioned in the NB2 that the purpose of the post is not to shame or police cheaters and griefers, the purpose is to figure out a way to help players who have a limited amount of time to have fun in this game and avoid running into cheaters or griefers. 
---
If making a list of their names would expose them, then how else would you help others avoid them?
---
Omg!!! Never paid attention to that LOOOOOL!!!
---
Have a nice cake day.
---
Vanguards is entirely overrated, unfortunately.
---
Best of luck to you!
---
Interesting perspective. I guess it would explain why so many are reluctant to call them out.
---
Beth is good at one thing, promising something better "down the road" and delivering disappointment. Just like real life - very immersive.
---
One day I'll find a random encounter albino Deathclaw... One day
---
It used to be bad. I quit for over a year. It's good now. Not perfect by a stretch, but decent and enjoyable. Have fun!
---
Try going to the all perks option and just looking through all of them.
---
When I was new to the game(wastlander update) a lvl 400 player gave me a bloodied 3 star fixer❣️ it was. Lvl 50 but now I'm lvl 167 and I was happy to use it, I wish I could've save the username bit it was like6 months ago, kinda feel sad bc I would give him something in return
---
Indeed. It does some interesting damage in ACP.
---
I'll still play regardless. Im still very very excited for one wasteland. A little annoyed by the added ammo grind but if I really get lazy I'll just buy ammo lol
---
I honestly don't know. Maybe if you're not "reported" on that list for an X period of time your name is automatically removed?
---
Put the fuse in first. If it doesnt work relog and try again doing the same. It's annoying but you can work around it.
---
That's the reason naming is not allowed here, or on any other forum.
---
Welcome aboard and have fun. You're gonna see the most part of the community is made of good players and helpful people.
---
My friend made a big guild for a fallout so alot of jus is active some overnight. Some day and sor 24/7 lol
---
'welcome - hope that fixes it.  And honestly, blowing away insects with a shotgun is so much more satisfying than trying to punch a swarm of bees.....
---
ay okay, you do know your lore. i‘m an enclave member myself, but i think the BoS did and sacrificed a lot more. they didn‘t succeed, but that‘s only because they didn‘t have us. :b
---
i just did that and nothing :/
---
I’ve only played it 3 or 4 times and I’ve already died twice by fear running right into that damn drill
---
Nope. Potato internetz eez fine.
---
Ditch that raider tag, Responder
---
I didn't mind the level scaling much in ESO, but that game is more neatly divided up into leveled zones that would be dull if the enemies didn't scale up. I really liked having to come up with creative solutions to high level enemies in FO76. It reminds me of Fallout: New Vegas where there were those cazadores blocking the direct route to the strip, forcing you to adventure around the long way. I also like the feeling of power once you're a high level character.
---
Yeah, I rolled a Hunter's Tenderizer and hope to get a Bloodied at some point.
---
Dragons can’t be dropped legendary anymore, but pistols and rifles can
---
😂😂😂
---
It reminds of of assultrons head weapon when you shoot an emnemy theirnhealyh go back as they were, but luckily they fixed it
---
Do 3 ACP a day and you will come ut 4 notes ahead everyday. I went from barely making my 20 a day to having 150ish since ACP came out. Granted I do it a LOT.
---
Yes you will! And it will be magnificent and strong!
---
You can only buy a perk available at 42 with a level up at the actual level 42 or greater. 
---
Banked level ups from before level 42 won't let you buy a lvl 42 perk
---
I find Innov and Juicehead are more about news then any type of tips/strats etc which is what the op is looking for. 
---
AngryTurtle probably. LoneVaultWanderer is good too, though he has less videos.
---
It's almost like you're supposed to drink and eat.
---
Do you have any unused perk points?
---
You can join teams now anytime. Or simply create building / event team and people will join.
---
Explosives are S tier
---
oh so i need to level up 1 more time then i can get the perk?
---
Have to say my level 35 2 shot Gauss rifle is pretty damn effective with all rifleman perks, tank killer and bloody mess loaded. I use my level 50 Hunters Tesla as first choice, but to see off powerful opponents, the Gauss is my key backup.
---
If you have any perk points saved, I believe you’ll need to claim some of those before the Master Rifleman perk becomes available.
---
The brotherhood achieved jackshit, and their glassed cavern fiasco proves that they struggled to kill even 1 single scorchbeast, while vault 76 people down one in 2 minutes. Every faction did something wrong: the responders "created"the raiders, the free states created the mire and murdered innocent vault dwellers and the raiders are basically the reason everyone's dead. But the brotherhood was the one who didn't achieve anything and just died
---
It’s a glitch. You’re able to wear it until you switch worlds or log out.
---
Even if I have over 600 dmg and energy resistance I still die quickly from those guys, that's why you have to use weapons that can one hot gutsys,
---
So now we've got an "I'm sorry" emote. Guess it's time for the other.
---
Congratz love!!
---
No. Explosive does not change the sound level created by your weapon, nor does it produce detection events at the site it explodes.
---
You hear and see it, but the NPCs do not.
---
Im 80% sure I have a 2 star instigating explosive black powder rifle if you want it.
---
I've tried everything I could think of plus all the old methods from various youtube videos and nothing seems to work anymore.
---
i found one in the woods once when i started playing. smoking on the ground. thought it was a nuke card so i ran over to check it out. it was open and said it was a aid drop, so i looked in side to see what you get when you send for one. 
---
after that i always toss the halos for this and have never requested one my self . waist of time imo
---
No I mean it’s in their inventory permanently.Its an item
---
this! feels like angry turtle is a hardcore player like us pushing the game to its limits. always finding ways to make you squeeze more performance from your gameplay. he’s great.
---
innov survivalist always have very good news and info, and as mentioned before her videos are very organized. she’s a professional youtuber. but sometimes she let it slips that she’s not an old timer fallout player. she lacks knowlodge from previous titles. but she’s great. she’s community.
---
If you are on xbox look for my camp below Vault 76. I have a radiation shower to ease your pains.😁 gt: Lord Amexos
---
Yeah I’ve tried that too but recently an aquientence got it out of the event no clue how they don’t know either but I’m really looking to get the mask
---
Smells like teen spirit
---
Oh I have a level 45 or 50 bloodied gauss rifle that works reasonably well, but the gauss pistol was what I was talking about in this post. can only be obtained through Regs in vault 79, and has to be built with legendary modules.
---
These are the challenges that force you to improve. It was a challenge to me 18mos ago, but now I can clear it in about 8 minutes using glitches, without dying once. I am a junkies commando/unarmed build. Weapons, JE25 fixer and Junkies DCG (still looking for FSS). It's not challenges that make me want to quite, it's boredom.
---
How would you avoid cheaters in a NW game anyway? 
---
Also by your logic a perfectly legitimate player would have been falsely accused of cheating just because _you_ don't understand how pvp works
---
Stalkers explosive -25% VATS cost
---
Everyone else here is wrong
---
Correct. If you level from 1 to 50 but never use any of the points, the game considers you to still be a level 1....just a level 1 with 50 perk points!
---
It's one of my fav events but no one ever goes there :(
---
I think so my plays the thermin all the time
---
For me the plan is this. I generally sell for 60-70% of it's in game value. If that takes it below 150 caps, I generally trade for script of if I'm feeling generous, drop for visitors. For plans I price at 10-15% of in game value, unless it's a very rare plan then it's usually at least in game value.
---
Tell me about it.  I’m at 796 right now:)
---
Our perks are likely similar - I’m melee primary, sniper,semi-autos as a secondary.
---
I like the faster fire of fixer or levers over the bolt action snipers.  Explosive lever action does a really god job, too :).
---
Yeah I learned about that yesterday, ppl that played before this dlc update is lucky, I see some ppl has BE Dragon and other legendary, but as long legendary powdered rifles and pistols still legendary I'm fine with it
---
I got nothing man, keep leveling up and try again.
---
Depends on your current level and amount of banked level ups (if any)
---
Yeah I agree about juicehead, but Innov does give tips as well.
---
Well I spent time coming up with clever joke names for no reason then
---
Well I sure appreciate the free atoms, skins and various goodies that Bethesda gave me for playing the game. Looking forward to the next season.
---
Welcome to the wasteland :)
---
I'm personally a month in and have to say it's been a blast one of my favorite games in a while.. Yes there are bugs, but 99% of the ones i've come across have a workaround.
---
My advice loot everything, do whatever you want at your own pace and most importantly HAVE FUN :)
---
It's Wires, my guy
---
I would honestly start looking into making a build, I would personally recommend either a heavy Gunner, commando (automatic rifles), or a melee, but you can do whatever one you want. Once you made a selection, 1. Research good builds for the class and make a plan in your head of what perks you really want, and 2. try to go hunting for legendary gear by doing public events that are of or below your skill level but DO NOT do Scorched Earth or A Colossal Problem until you have some pretty good gear or high level friends to help you (ask me how I know) because lots of them have legendary enemies to kill and loot (Uranium fever is by far the best), and doing any horde events in the world because they have 1 guaranteed 3 star and most likely a second, take all the legendaries you don’t want and sell them at a legendary exchange at any train station and modify the ones you do like. When you sell gear at the legendary exchange you get scrip which can be used to buy other legendary gear and legendary modules at the rusty pick (modules are for late game crafting and buying the gear at the rusty pick isn’t worth it but it’s still available). I hope this helps
---
Without Angry Turtle there would only be rumours that "X" does not stack with "Y" or "A" works better or worse than "B".
---
He is a FO76 scientist
---
so i have to spend the points i was saving to max it out when i first got it i have to use to even unlock the perk?
---
I was trying to move a power conduit around. When it was placed it was fine.. picking it up to move it I could no longer place it in any sensible way. Remembered someone mentioned a rug trick and that worked. Looks silly, but what works.. works. Building can be quite maddening. I'll have to remember this.
---
It's not you. VATS has been broken for a long time.
---
Lol 80% what happen to the other 20%, but it's okay I can get it myself, I'll do more monster mash events but thank mate👍
---
No such thing as messing up your build. You just haven't leveled enough to get the one you want yet.
---
Honestly even at almost level 400 I tweak my build on a monthly basis for various reasons.
---
Yeah the skins throughout were nice I just found the end reward lackluster
---
Oh really?!!   I’m going to save this post in case you find out. Lol.
---
Try a wired connection it could also be that your just really far away from your router
---
Thank you! Yes, love them as well :)
---
Doubt I will but I hope someone comes bearing more news
---
Ty
---
It was just that particular server shutting down. The game is still up.
---
That's really cool. Great job!
---
I'm so tired of people doing the work to finish the run and then crying about the rewards sucking when YOU KNEW RIGHT FROM THE START WHAT THEY WERE. You only have your own dumb ass to blame.
---
New Vegas already had a very thorough ammo crafting system. It's in the same engine, so there's no reason Bethesda couldn't implement something similar.
---
&gt;Cons:
---
- None.  
---
I see you too are a very humble person, lol  
---
Not exactly how I would do it, I would have the left bit where you "spin" the thing be a container where you put ammo in, select what ammo type you want in the terminal, then hit spin and the ammo you put in gets converted to as many round of the selected ammo as can be made with its inventory.  
---
The terminal should remember what your last round selected was too like the ammo factory so future conversions for the same ammo only require placing ammo in and spinning it.  
---
This way its just that little more immersive and gives the spin function an actual function
---
nope. part of the reason some grind to level 50 before doing certain quests is that they want the best version of the unique weapon possible.
---
though if i recall, the sword you can get in thr Mistress of Mysteries questline can be upgraded via weapon benches using scrap. it's treated as building a new weapon with the old one being a component for crafting. i think thats the only one tho.
---
This also works on PC with a controller.
---
&gt; I would prefer that it just broke the ammo down into crafting components so I could just make what I needed.
---
New Vegas had exactly that. It got a bit tedious due to the 100 item limit, but it was still miles better than Bethesda's garbage.
---
A little trumpet/fanfare happy music with fireworks stuff would have been nice when reaching 100 🤓 It was a grind though, probably couldn't finish it if we don't have the virus pandemic going on.
---
You should do one on the assaultron head :)
---
WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
edit: yeah, i give you 1 dollar today, so if i give you less than a dollar tomorrow, i should be jailed or hang, for sure, thats a fair expected logic. yeah.
---
aaaaaaaand I am the obnoxious one here? Im just an upset gamer who got bamboozled by Bethesda for cutting down on freebies. How fucking literal I have to be discuss a silly fake money?
---
Just remember this game is download only, initial is around 50-60gb with patches ranging from 5 to 50gb.
---
Lol, obviously. I still needed to get to 99 to get the fireplace thats arguably the best reward in there so obviously I'm gonna have it finished. Im not complaining that I wasted my time, I'm just saying after spending this much time and effort the end reward should be better. I don't think theres anything wrong with giving feedback and I don't regret spending my effort getting to 100
---
For scrip, make all items not only trade in for less but cost less from purveyor. Ex: 3 star weapon buys for 50 and sells for 20. Removes need to increase any of the limits.
---
For gold bullion your solution would have worked before release but unfortunately with people having stock piles of treasury notes the only real solution is changing limits, you cant give those people an advantage of being that far ahead or disadvantage for changing the type of turn in and making them lose all their previous work
---
Yeah, I'm glad Im addicted to grinding or else I wouldn't have finished either
---
Hahha laughed so hard 😂
---
I would like to finish the story line sometime before 2020 is over. Buuut the 3rd or 4th quest is still bugged.
---
I went from over 400 notes to less than 200 by playing a different character, and only logging in my main just long enough to redeem 20.
---
That wasn't really what i was trying to say lol. I mean...Pc &amp; Xbox1 must be having the same possibilities.
---
You know what would work even better on PC? If Bethesda would just let us type in the numbers! Unfortunately that would go against their ethos of designing for console first and then utterly half-assing the port.
---
You on PC? I'll help you run it if you want
---
Yes. You ***cannot*** bank level ups (at least, not until you hit *true* level 50 and everything is unlocked).  You have to use the level up to be considered a higher level character for the purposes of perk cards.
---
If you are level 43 but have 8 level ups ‘saved’, you can equip level 40 gear but you can only select &amp; equip perk cards that were unlocked at level 35. The ones that are unlocked at level 36 will not be available until you do so. 
---
[This resource](https://nukesdragons.com) can help you plan out your build.
---
Ouch thats pretty rough
---
What a simp
---
the opposite happened to me once a level 150 came in and helped me do the nuke he even used let me choose where to launch it i was a level 30 at the time so he probably felt bad 😂
---
Like what if we were able to just build some massive settlement like Kowloon Walled City? 
---
https://www.google.com/search?q=kowloon+walled+city&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=ivmn&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk01vEheE6BI5av-M_nhW8mRGal7cRw:1599417058766&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrqIrtlNXrAhUXmXIEHffgDJIQ_AUoAXoECBgQAQ&amp;biw=375&amp;bih=635
---
Nice and clean looking
---
All of them
---
ok so the meta atm is this
---
frog legs/ explosive perk/ shotgun damage and -spread. the rest of the perks can be survival. like iron clad or life giver
---
basically 95% of the fight happen at a short distance
---
using chems before a fight will basically 1 shot people
---
it's a dumb but this is how pvpers play
---
[Angry Turtle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSEDsFOPSQp6VP8vfH_Zxcg) has LOADS of vids for you to see how he manages builds, how he creates different build types and how to best maximize them. Not to mention the rest of his HIGHLY informative vids. I used his info to create my build!
---
Late night scripping can be dangerous sometimes and it was sitting in my vendor for awhile.
---
Im thinking I got it at Uranium fever im because it is lvl 35. Still 411 paper damage @19hp unbuffed.
---
Its all yours if you want it, better in the hands of someone that might use it than the scrip machine.
---
Edit: Haha, took it for a quick rip, 1700-2100 head shots on a super mutant and a 4k on a hound from sneak. That reload though!
---
I have a non legendary dragon too if you want it.
---
At this time I just leave a match if i find certain names in the lobby. But the list is growing fast.
---
I get your point abt falsely accusing someone because the person reporting doesn't understand smth in the game.
---
In this case I called the player a griefer and maybe he wasn't in the strict meaning of the term. However I don't want to play in the same server as someone who would shoot a player 400lvls lower than him, and After that claim the workshop.
---
In all cases this is the purpose of the post to figure out if there is a decent way to protect casual pacifist players.
---
I would imagine the list would hold 2 important details, "last time reported", and "number of times reported".
---
So if someone like me who doesn't  understand all the mechanics of the game falsely accuses someone, the name would appear with a frequency of 1, and would be at the bottom of the list. So maybe a threshold of number of reports should also be specified before publishing the list.
---
I would welcome any suggestion.
---
GT: Njorls
---
As soon as I find a worthy assaultron head I'll get right on it
---
Pretty sure that the PS4 community can help you aswell
---
[Nukes and Dragons will let you play with perks to see how you can switch em up!](https://nukesdragons.com/) Also you can play with any perk suggestions you've been given in comments!
---
What accent?🤓🤓
---
Hope so, it's my favorite seasonal event to play
---
2011?
---
skyrim. Apparently, the bug was also in skyrim.
---
To be fair, MODUS is enabling the nuke launches.
---
The year skyrim came out.  Lol. Scorchbeasts and dragons are essentially the same
---
That's what I figured you meant.
---
Well that's not fair. I'd love to sink some conduit into the floor. Damn you Bethseda!!!
---
Altho once i manged to sink a light into a wall.. nice until I wanted to change it and had to remove the whole wall to get to the light again.
---
Wow, thanks for sharing this, would have been my next purchase. I have the gauss shotgun and I love it.
---
Near mama dolces in Morgantown. Roads are pretty flat there’s the river for water, Morgantown station is nearby, and for your camps theme, you’d want to be near mama dolces
---
If they don't have a quest mark, they can be stashed. It's not the same with notes, with those you have to test each one.
---
I want to free Biv from his basement prison. Need a good drinking buddy bot at my camp
---
Since I have some pistols perks I guess I can take it, how much caps you want?
---
I have a doubleshot assaultron head but always radiates me.. why? Its damage is sucky too. But not when they melt me with a shot or two... no logic in this.
---
That's why I don't do energy weapons
---
I was able to get 2 in under the electrical tower across from Sunnytop Train Station without floating them. Still had enough room to place a seedy shed, build a building for all the crafting benches and 4 in-ground water pumps. 
---
The only bitch about it was the two vehicles there couldn't be removed.
---
wonder around aimlessly and build around a weapon you like. like any other fallout game (:
---
Bloodied suppressed comba....... what is it? Is it a shotgun? An assault rifle? Grognak’s ax?
---
Preach brother! Loosing a VATS lock on the queen or Earle cause of another player running inbetween really kills it too. It's really not a fun playstyle... They need to fix this ASAP, but it's still broken in patch 22 on the PTS and all we're hearing is that it's a bit more complicated. Which is just a lame excuse for not caring in the end. A whole playstyle and weapon class completely broken and ineffective in VATS. Same for bows... They really do not care.
---
The gauss shotgun 2mm is sweet with the right perks and mods. Can do 600 dps.
---
Holy shit. That's awesome
---
So that's why it wasn't giving me rads!
---
Not enough rad storms. When I hear one rolling in I get excited and bust out the camera
---
As an anti-questor I'm stuck getting the last one from the 4th floor of Defiance. Now I know I'll be disappointed when I finally get around to it.
---
Nice not bad
---
dropping nukes to spawn a giant bat isn't realistic either. developers should remove that too.
---
It happened to me yesterday, I got Score from 1 or 2 daily tasks only.
---
Are....are you friends with Chicken Man? He's TERRIFIED of them....so you are are providing a truly necessary and underappreciated service. Appalachia thanks you!
---
frog legs is a must
---
Thanks for this, I once claimed a 150 script square from the season.. only to get like 63 of it cause I was close to cap. I'll have to keep this in mind.
---
lol - it must have been an error with the RNG
---
👆🏻👍🏻
---
Agreed, but have it so we can set the radio station, and give us some "Out of Appalachia" radio stations, perhaps as a bit of an easter egg to clue us into what's going on in other states nearby.
---
aren't you on mobile?
---
Yeah, but public teams aren't people who join you and you quest together, it's more like people staying together for the bonus + mutations
---
Its still better than nothing
---
Thanks I’ve been round them and nothing tho
---
Sweet cheers will try this
---
Well enjoy your feasts and drinks then.😁 don't know if you played the Outer Worlds but somehow they could make it more enjoyable by not forcing you to constantly feed.
---
Yeah I dont think its framerate, though I cant actually find the framelock option in Nvidia. Where its supposed to be its just, not.
---
Brilliant thank you
---
Earle did that last night lol
---
No. We don’t want another dupe glitch - Todd Howard to the staff who raised this issue
---
I remember a while back during the earlier road map they had a symbol that looked like it eluded to robot companions. Given we got pet dogs on the way (according to their leak during wastelanders) and the dog models in the files, we at least seem to got the basis for dog companions returning. Honestly one thing i'd like if we got traveling companions is the option to design one. A series of personalities in either sex, the ability to design them, giving them gear to use, and having them tag along.
---
&gt;they aspire to horde tech (pretty much just weapons) and use them to kill every creature (sentient or not) and then call it everything but genocide.
---
Only non-humans and humans that have mutated beyond recognition. They may purge super mutants, synths, and ghouls, but they don't typically go out of their way to genocide healthy and functioning members of humanity. You want to talk about genocide? Look no further than the tag next to your name The Enclave knows a thing or two about genocide. 
---
&gt;BoS have NEVER been the good guys, they just horde tech to consolidate power thats it, just a bully with a bigger gun.
---
They hoard tech in order to bring order. Technology is what caused the great war in their eyes so to them the best bet for humanity is having said technology exclusively in the hands of those who can be trusted. 
---
&gt;the whole "seed of knowledge to ensure humanity can rebuild in the future" is BS, in 200 years they achieve fuckall.
---
Depending on your choices, The Brotherhood entered Boston with a large military force, removed an organization who was using technology for great evil in the region, and is sending out groups into the Wasteland to purge it of Super Mutants and Ghouls. Which, yes, is genocide if you count those two groups as still being human. Both groups are also a monument to man's arrogance and carelessness with technology. The super mutants owing their origin to the Enclave's human experimentation and the ghouls for being a near immortal reminder Great War.
---
Don't get me wrong, the Brotherhood's not squeaky clean, but if you want law and order across the entire former US and everything united under one banner, they're probably your best bet.
---
I wanna say I've been there but tbh, I don't think I have. I'ma go there now. Thanks for pointing this out.
---
You know, for how psychotic our characters’ actions are towards the wasteland (exterminating anything that points a gun at us, launching nukes, cheating entire settlements out of gold bullion, etc), us vault 76 dwellers seem to by and large do good by each other.
---
The vault 51 dwellers, on the other hand...
---
I wish there were more community events to do stuff like "Repair the Enclave bunker", "Repair the Charleston Dam", "White Spring Renovations", etc. Hell, imagine fixing up Camdem Park!
---
Very well said thanks 👍🏻
---
Thanks man
---
Thankyou. I guess I forgot to see can you place things inside of them? If not I guess I got a big waste. lol
---
Nice!
---
The mothman seems to show up extremely often to my house. I wish he’d show up to his worshippers instead!
---
Thankyou very much. I will look into it.
---
What... what are they doing?
---
He spawned at my last camp a few times, would be nice if he turned up to this one :)
---
It should give it to you tomorrow
---
You should get that atoms on the day of the original purchase, just like the game tacks on a new subscription to the le gtg of the old one.
---
Yeah. It’s why I always try to give away stimpack diffusers whenever I happen to earn some super stims. They’re cheap, worthless next to friendly fire, and not something that should have as abysmally low of a drop chance as it does.
---
I had a friend purchase a bear arm plan for me (and I paid them back, of course), and now I have everything I care about from the event. Except the mod plans, but frankly, I’m not an unarmed build. I just needed the weapon to truly become Arktos Man.
---
Raider Punk kept activating my Mothman statue. Finally gave up and scrapped it.
---
Ohhh, had no clue this was a thing. I stumbled upon this level 5 legendary shotgun in the first few hours of playing, and now at 50 or so hours in I'm still using it to kill SBQ and ACP
---
So that’s how you obtain it! I’ve had it for a long time, but I never figured out the exact way to earn it. Thank you!
---
Close application and restart fo76 and they should be there
---
my concern is guns breaking.  I already almost can’t use a cryo because it breaks so fast
---
You can but it's not as big as you may think. 3 standard vending machines, a couple stash boxes and a couple floor lamps was what I could manage without it looking overly cluttered, you know?
---
Power wise, I found that using the black, pipe-looking conduits and coming in through the opening in the ceiling was the easiest way, with normal conduits inside.
---
You will notice that everything inside seems to float a few inches off the ground but, supposedly, that is getting fixed in an update or two. We just have to wait and see.
---
Thank you for the info! I thought it should be instantly added to your account. I’ll wait till tomorrow then and see.
---
I do this event whenever it pops up but have no luck with good players joining. If anyone is on xbox I'm always down for some PP
---
It seems to be quite random
---
Tried closing the app and relaunching it as well as restarting the console, but nothing is happening. Others have suggested waiting till the original date of the purchase which is tomorrow so I’ll wait and see.
---
Same
---
🤨
---
I stick those mini-nukes and missiles in the ammo converter. In fact, I rarely have any ammo in my vendors because any I'm not using goes in the converter.
---
When I was selling ammo, it was a cap a piece.
---
Most other things I tend to sell at about 10-20% of listed value. 
---
Someone else said sell for a bit higher than the vendor bot will pay - that's pretty sound advice.
---
Some items - common plans and recipes or common mods for example - rarely sell at any price. I usually dump them, or drop them in the overseers camp.
---
I've been using Fed76 for pricing my legendaries. 
---
Rare and high demand items could probably be listed at cost or higher.
---
For me, vending is largely about getting something for stuff I don't need and might otherwise dump. 
---
If I have a surplus of something like stimpaks, I might list them at 20-30 caps. If they sell, that's usually a nice chunk of cash, if they don't, I'll just take them back out to use when supplies are running low.
---
A large mix of chem, bobbles, mags, and legendary that I would normally scrap at 10c per scrip tends to be my method.
---
Even without damage bloody is endgame build for me, huge amounts of ap, crits really quick, no need for hard bargain and stuff is repaired quite high
---
So I can do it in a private world and just sit there basically? That sounds like the best option. Where do I get the schematic for the fusion generator? (I assume I use that to power it correct?)
---
If someone finishes a quest I know it gives 20, but the random 12 is new as well
---
You mean after Patch 22?
---
That’s why I built on one of the tallest if not the tallest point in the game. Plus mountain houses don’t have to worry about defense which is nice
---
Whens that coming out? Didn't realise they had one coming so soon. What's it for?
---
Some folks sell serums to vendors for 500 caps each. Some folks sell serums to players for 300 each, some sell weapons to vendors after going thru wiping all super mutants off the map. It's pretty simple and easy to get 30k caps. It's all about consistency every day.
---
Bamboozled because you're getting less free stuff? Stuff you are not owed, not are they obligated to give you. 
---
Yep. Obnoxious entitlement.
---
Grognak the barbarian, lol.
---
Yes sir.
---
Straight up if someone even hints at wanting something from me I'm not going to give it to them.  Play the game/hope someone decides to give stuff to you.
---
Shame but thx for the answers
---
[Go here](https://map76.com/) and search for LiteAlly. There are A LOT of locations. Start with the Settler specific ones and go from there. The "Lite Allies" are Settler Wanderer (guitar lady), Settler Forager (Gramps) and Raider Punk (radio dude). Good Luck!
---
Funny how Bethesda did not figure out yet selling gold for atoms. They could make tons of money.
---
Yes, this is correct. It did not show up in the even awards for me and I didnt even know I had it until a few weeks ago, after putting that damn code in so many times. It's also not a plan at all. So to see if you can make it mod the backpack to find out.
---
I would add: Don't bother me with the Youtube tutorial you watched. Sure, you want to help me, but I already know about that lead mine.
---
How people having less than 10k?
---
And a trip to the DMV to get an ammo license
---
Been getting me and my two friends ready to run it when we see it pop up soon; we are finally geared enough to be considered endgame/top tier so it's just a matter of knowing what to expect. I've felt the same way as everyone with seeing nobody running it but with hopefully the three of us showing up in our world it should make ours doable.
---
Wait, Tank killer's gonna work with pistols?
---
I didnt have much more than you until I got into the 120’s.  Spent a lot buying plans, etc.
---
At bot vendors,  Hard bargain3, grape mentats, + alcohol that boosts charisma will lower your buy price and boost your sell price
---
Loot everything, scrap, bulk, and sell To bot vendors. You know all those mutfruit and other plants you ignore as you walk by?  They sell for 1c each at bots.
---
  When you can afford it, get a serum recipie.  Serums will sell to bot vendors for no less than 420 caps per, up to around 500 caps pending Hardbargain3, etc.  Players will scoop them up at under 300 caps.
---
Put excess plans and ammo in your vendor.  
---
Dont fast travel quite as much, or try to only FT to free landing zones.  Yea, takes more time, but you’ll end up with more loot to sell  :)
---
You are right - normally it's instant.
---
There is an ongoing issue with Fallout 1st and Atoms. Some people didn't get any and others ended up with hundreds of thousands - currently being looked into
---
Playing a lot. finding stuff. knowing what is trash and what is cash! That 3\* bit of armour you found. 10k. That gun. 20k. That Blue uniform from fort defiance? 4-5k. 
---
I never really struggled for caps but once i bought those serum recipes and started making them i am making mad caps daily. I hit max caps this morning. went and spent 29k on things and stuff and now i'm back on 24k. Someone came and bought a silly amount of serums. probably to sell them on for profit.
---
Do sentry bots still drop fusion cores?
---
I play on LTE mobile hotspot a lot and it works just fine. You don't really need a lot of download speed to play multiplayer games. You just need consistent connection (good ping, no packet loss, etc). The biggest hurdle will be actually downloading the whole game.
---
There's always at least one person asking a day haha
---
that's only because of the mandatory laser rifle equip.
---
1400 caps a day. 22 days to hit max plus whatever I sell in my machines. 
---
One, I always max out my daily caps. Pretty easy with all the weapons thrown at you from certain events or areas. Takes about 15-20 minutes. 
---
Two, I don’t underprice my legendary items. If it is worth enough for me to spend stash space on, it’s worth enough for you to spend a few days to a few weeks worth of caps on. You won’t find a single legendary under around 2k caps in my machines. You won’t find crap in my machines because that all goes to scrip. I may not sell on volume but when I do sell it’s for thousands of caps. Understand your prices and don’t be that person who sells a bloodied faster fire rate +1 perception ultracite Gatling laser for 2k when it’s worth 20k. That’s the person that I make money off of by buying and flipping. 
---
Three, the location of your camp says a lot. Want to sell plans and serums, build in the forest. Most of your buyers will be new characters. Want to sell high end lvl 50 legendaries, build in the bog. Being in the bog says you are a veteran character with legendaries in your machines and not standard weapons. 
---
Four, have a good variety of things in your vending. The quantity of things and variety will get people to risk the fast travel cost to come to your camp.
---
I think that the server might be laggy or to many nukes launched
---
Thats not actually a tautology. Its still a contingency. A tautology is a case where no matter the facts. The statement is always true. E.g. I did it alone or i didnt do it alone. In This statement. The statement is true both if he did it alone or if he did not. This would be a tautology.
---
You get one of each per character if you learn them as you earn them. So if you learn the elder paint you wont recieve any more. As for actual rarity i think its something under a 5% chance they drop.
---
Surprisingly, I had never been down there before, so thanks for posting!
---
Thank you for the info! I wasn’t aware of this issue but hopefully it gets resolved soon along with the other ongoing issues.
---
Hopefully they will patch that magic shit at some point.
---
Lol right? There is very little, like .0001 you can do for me newb.
---
If you can deal with the weight, hit all the PA spawn points (there are Al least 12 in the forest alone) and check the generators wherever you go.
---
There are at least 2 static spawn around Charleston.  Cores just laying on a counter/table, and another not to far from there in the ash heap.
---
camden park may have up to 5 - one from the event, a PA spawn, 2 generators, and one loose in an ammo can.
---
batlebots at blair train yard.  Loot the sentrybot.
---
in H E L L
---
I sell legendary weapons and armor but some of my other consistent items that are easily moved are treasure maps@ 50c each and serums@ 300c each.
---
Good.
---
Thanks that helps a lot. I've treated this game like any other Bethesda title so I figured I could probably ignore the quests and be fine. Glad to hear there are some good rewards available.
---
 Any advice for good camp placement?
---
Are you telling me that's not how it is right now? ThTs what it feels like. If it wasn't for cursed weapons, I wouldn't have seen anything past 1 star this last week.
---
shut up karen
---
I tried your idea but it now says "part of the structure will not be available" when trying to fix the mess with stairs and such.
---
All of the factions barrel into the Institute and blow it up in the exact same way. 
---
Even the Railroad- who instead of "saving" the synths, also end up causing them to go extinct 
---
Why all the hate pointed at only the Brotherhood?
---
Can you get explosive now i thought they nerfed it
---
The only exception I know of is the weapons you get as rewards in the Mistress Of Mystery quest line. You can rebuild them into higher level versions and it takes the existing one as an ingredient.
---
what platform are you on?
---
I bought it from grahm.  I think one of the bots at whitespings usually has it, too.
---
AFIK, the other way to get it is to complete the power up (plant) event
---
The 10% tax should go towards funding a banking system. I want a bank account and safety deposit box to store my excess goods.
---
Awesome! Ive never seen the mothman yet. Maybe someday.
---
intelligence doesn't effect the rolls only the condition.
---
Make another one.
---
Boss doesnt guarantee 3 star drops which sucks, the quest gives you cursed trash though.
---
Magic shotguns shouldn't be patched, they aren't as op as magic 50 cals. Magic shotguns hardly oneshot a mr gutsy, they are what shotguns should actually be
---
This and the ones that heal rads. Omg I jumped into a public team one night and then right out as I went from being a Bloodied Badass to a Wimpy Wet Noodle sooo fast. Both were shared and I wilted LOL! Wasn't mad at all, hell I was the one that joined a public team, and I can never begrudge the cards people share, but god it made me laugh how FAST it was! Was very, very humbling :D
---
Oh thanks
---
Wow that's very helpful. Thanks a lot. What are some of the better legendary perks to keep an eye out for?
---
Thank you - Yeah, when you're least expecting it he'll show up
---
They will remove the debuffs from not eating/drinking in a future patch though, this was confirmed by a community manager. They're currently working on it.
---
This is only speculation but I assume it still requires work because otherwise shit like Speed Demon and the food perks will be useless.
---
What kind of exchange rate are you suggesting?  What kind of daily limit?
---
You can already buy it for caps not sure it needs another way to get it. I think there should be at least a little work to get it.
---
I know I just want it now lol. I hate drinking 20 water bottles an hour
---
Do you know if they drop in "order?"
---
People have lots of gifts and know cap stash locations as well as trade/sell a lot
---
You can hit 30k in caps by doing nothing but selling loot to vendorbots for three weeks. But that also requires not spending caps on things unless you really need them. 
---
Add in the caps you get from quests, events, enemies, containers, etc and you gain a lot more. 
---
Sell things in your vending machine that people want to buy. 
---
You can get there more quickly than you think.
---
Pvp is terrible.  Everyone one shots everyone unless you're prepared.  He probably had assassins armor/gear
---
I want to open a brothel/casino like the atomic wrangler.fisto,the goul,&amp;a smooth talker.have theatre show.
---
I could make tons of caps.
---
Occasionally it gives you ballistic fiber.
---
The event is no longer triggerable since the release of public events. You have to server hop or wait for it to pop up. It's a huge bummer and is super frustrating. :(
---
Right, I know that, tomorrow I will visit Smiley to spend the usual 6,000 caps. But for atoms Bethesda could make serious $.
---
Wow when I read "classical jukebox" I didnt really think I was getting the literal same classic tunes that make me wanna fall asleep to this already boring ass game...juked me again on the jukebox. Yall really have 0 imagination or 0 fucks. Maybe both.
---
They do, and you cant recieve the next one until you learn the previous.
---
Maybe not the best or easiest method, but I've used this in the past when I want to accumulate caps quickly:
---
1. Farm flux, craft as many serums as possible (make sure to use Super Duper)
---
2. Have 5 characters on your account, and get someone to help transfer the serums evenly among them. Also give them several grape mentats each.
---
3. Once a day, log in on each character and sell serums. With 1 charisma and grape mentats, you get 350 caps per. So the math works out well, you can max out the vendors with 4 serums.
---
You can get up to 7k caps per day, and it takes around 21 days to reach the account limit of 150k. Having a variety of serum recipes helps because you're not relying on a specific type of flux or other crafting materials.
---
They are not in Boston to "kill every creature deemed a threat" they are there to stop the institute, and they are very well aware of the abuses and threat the institute represents. 
---
Stealing crops from local farmers... So someone tasked with feeding the Brotherhood asks the PC (You) to do a thing. You don't have to do it, it isn't them doing it, and we don't even know if the organization as a whole knows about it or supports those actions. In the end, it is you, the player, who performs those deeds. 
---
The BoS absolutely plans on giving the "tech" back they horde to responsible humans, in the future, who are going to be capable of leaving the current dark age. How are you so convinced they won't, this is their purpose for existing...
---
And they don't "Consolidate power" anywhere, they have not taken authority over any civilian populate in any canon ending of any game. They have left those governments to be governments, hell, they even helped the NCR for a while till things went south between them.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
It's probably only to combat the weapon black market they created for themselves. The only way to end it is to make stronger weapons to where nobody wants the old ones or make new weapons that can't be traded....
---
honestly something similar to becketts quest where you free them from prison, but make it so you cant see their face up until you meet them and then right before they get freed you get to design them.
---
Sometimes patrolling the mojave,almost makes you wish for nuclear winter.
---
VATS is broken in PvP currently, you would have to free aim to do damage.
---
He actually stood there while a emptied two clips into him. Standing right in front of each other. Neither one of us moving. Then I was thinking something was amiss, so I moved on. That is when he killed me instantly.
---
Lag more than likely fucked you there
---
Idk.  Had that one for a few months.  Don’t remember where I got it.
---
i did pick up a TSE handmade as a reward during Fashnacht, as well as a few other explosive full autos.
---
Yeppers.  I should probably start selling all those loose screws in my vendor.... she can't use them lol
---
I have no idea. I struggle to make caps too.
---
I assume these people just never spend their caps on anything and hoard them like crazy. Seriously people, caps are meant to be spent.  
---
I'm always spending mine, it feels like I have more going out than coming in.
---
Yes please
---
Too many times I've had to get all 3 pylons, damn annoying with people lvl 200+
---
My guess would be sentinels armor then.  Less damage when standing still.
---
VATS wouldn’t even pick him up, so I had to auto aim. No damage. 30 rounds of Tesla rifle and 40 rounds of .45.
---
What are they worth trade wise?
---
Personally, Scouring player vendors for dirt cheap weapons and re-selling at bottom Fed76 value. I just sell grenades and aid I don't use at vendors.
---
Well since atoms can be purchased for real money something realistic. 500 atoms for 5000 gold sounds good? You could buy nice weapons and armors for that. And if you don't have the free time to grind then it is a nice way to obtain the gear you want.
---
I have been playing f3,new vegas&amp;76 lately.
---
If you love fallout, you're going to love this game. Low expectations make it even bettee
---
Forget a mister handy how about a  eye bot
---
Sleep! Sleeping in a bed gets you a “well-rested” xp boost. (Sleeping on a cot or sleeping bag will give you “rested”, which doesn’t last as long.) If you start a new character, you can sleep in the vault room before leaving and have an xp boost right out of the gate. There are foods that will give you a boost as well, particularly cans of meat stew; these are from the event quest “feed the people”, so I recommend doing that whenever it pops up. Higher INT means more xp, so a lot of people will join “building” teams for the INT boost.
---
That's a good question that I don't know...
---
I'm not
---
3&amp;NV were my favourite, I wish they had mod support for consoles.
---
Had a level 20 harass me last night wanting on of my rare masks from a display. Said no thanks in 3 messages, as they continued to offer me 1200 caps and garbage. When they got the point I wasn’t going to sell, they immediately demanded I give them plans. Blocked and switched worlds. I help new players as often as possible, but no means no.
---
My game keeps crashing when signing in it was fine couple hours ago
---
Oh another xp boosting event is “path to enlightenment”, which gives you a temporary boost that will go away if you served hop.
---
Bethesda did God rays really well in Fallout 4 as well.
---
It would be way more expensive then you’d ever expect lol
---
You don't like the sound of my kids playing in the background?  Well I don't like the sound of your bong and e cig slurp.  Deal with it buddy, it's a online game, not a movie theater.
---
I can give you a level 50 Power Fist. I don't have the plans for the death law gauntlet.
---
I'm on right now, if you want to meet up.
---
This is so pretty! I love the way you did the lighting, its so soft but lends a slightly sinister vibe! And that's not a camp...that's a church.
---
Are you xbox?
---
Do every event that comes up on the left side of the map, and join a public team everytime you play. Do feed the people and get your meat stew for a 5% xp bonus, also commune with the mothman at the end of Path to Enlightenment, also gives a 5% xp boost. Just walk around and kill everything you can near Flatwoods. Discovering locations gives you some xp. It's a slow go to lvl 30 but after that you should have good weapons and armor to really do almost anything.
---
Had some runts try demanding that because I had Fallout 1st, and according to their "logic" therefore had access to unlimited scrap (which is false, only can store any amount of scrap i've collected), that I owed them free stuff. Told them to go suck a Bloated Glowing One's recently radiated taint. They tried initiating PvP, which as one could expect doesn't end well when it is a level 13 and 17 against a (then) level 173 in powerarmor with a fatmen launcher. One smoldering crater later they were dead and I trudged off to a nearby event.
---
If you want to make serious money then you need to make things affordable for the masses.
---
I know right?
---
Yeah an robot which says your ingame name! So me naming my character Fucker wasn't in vain...
---
This just spawned but no one was there to do the event with me so it times out. I wasn't about to try on my own.
---
Thanks very much! My son said the same thing about the church :)
---
I tend to move mine alot but you've probably seen those resource pits around the world? If you build your camp with one of those in it you can build an extractor to generate that resource.
---
Also having water from a river or pond is pretty useful to gather water.
---
Oh and keep in mind fast travel to your camp is free, so putting it in an area you commonly go to is useful as well.
---
Honestly probably just spamming quantums
---
Smart kiddo! :D
---
Chyeah
---
Ok if I’m gonna be honest it’s a yes and no. With those daily ops they’re adding and the level scaling I do like where they’re going however, it would be nice to have some areas with low levels just to make things simple in some certain cases and not an intense fight. But the main reason I like the level scaling is for the legendary events such as Horde events, Uranium fever, Wolf Horde etc. If they want to make an area really challenging I think it would be cool if they expanded on the cranberry bog (yes I know that’s a lot of work the team has to do but I think it would be cool) So then high levels can grind out in those areas as well. 
---
For the damage nerf I’m meh. The main reason is because if they keep doing damage nerfs they mine as well add weapons/effects meant for higher levels because it doesn’t make sense if they try and balance every weapon. The whole point is to try and get better weapons and I recently just got a bloodied Gatling plasma and I don’t wanna see that weapon get hit hard. Because if they’re needing weapon damage and having level scaling, it can be a bad thing for some high levels who may not have the best arsenal. That being said I’m excited to try it out and see where they go with it
---
Sticky this
---
I think the point behind gold bullion is the grind process, even with the potential profits, this breaks the entire philosophy behind it.
---
Or jetpack.
---
Oh, interesting 🙂 But would the statement 'soloed it with someone else' negate the 'soloing' aspect of the statement, thus making it not true? ( If that makes any sense)
---
I think there are three generators you can get plans for by doing the Powering Up events, and they're not in a guaranteed order. You may have to do as many as three events before you get the one you want.
---
I usually share sun kissed because so many people seem to never have radaway
---
I max out caps, scrip all the times. Also give away legendary 3 star items and flux to new players. Real easy to make the daily 1400 caps in an hour or so.
---
As a tip do Radiation Rumble and Uranium Fever, collect all the loot and sell them.
---
Don't forget the cavern too in the mire.there is a truck with radiation barrels spilled and a dead bear at the entrance.it has deathclaws inside and i think its getting content int the next patch.
---
That altar looks really elegant and fancy, good job :P
---
What rewards
---
I have over 600 treasury notes at this point, not sure if there's a cap lol
---
Please never share that perk card, it's terrible for bloodied builds.  Just share something generic like strange in numbers, travel agent or whatever
---
Wait, you mean spend Atoms to gain Gold?  No, absolutely not. 
---
I thought you mean the other way around; spend Gold to get Atoms.  That would be a way to use up Gold for those that had no interest in any more bullion items. 
---
Being able to buy Gold with real world money is a *very* bad idea.
---
I'll add wires to the list, thankyou. I remember, wires also disconnect themselves now, when an item rotates
---
I think there's more active players on PS4 now than there's ever been. I also rarely see the bugs everyone talks about now days. A lot of work has been done on the game and it's much more user friendly. Especially for early game players.
---
Dolores would be much more awesome...
---
Or that. I don’t like bringing that up since not everyone has one. Same with marsupial.
---
Being able to craft ammo but not scrap it is an insult to my intelligence. Should be a perk for it.
---
That would be the final case, a contradiction. A case whereby the statements are a and not a. Where in either case, it cannot be true.
---
Yeah, I think your last point is the biggest problem--that anything 'inventory-driven' would ultimately lead to an exploit. Would love to see a change, though.
---
I've been grinding that quest for the past 2 weeks and I've yet to actually receive any plans. All I get is ammo
---
Right. But think of people who don't have time to grind. Bethesda is missing out $ if they don't think of those players.
---
Loot all the weapons (especially heavy guns and assault/combat rifles) from enemies, and sell them to the bot vendors.  Gather all 26 straight jackets (worth about 50 caps each to vendor bots) at Ft Defiance.
---
Yes, I do not recall where, but the other option is to startup the power plant. There is a power box right beside the fusion core maker and once powered up you can power that and a bunch of other things. The power box provides 100 power. If you cant build a fusion reactor and don't want to start up the powerplant you can just use other generators til you have neough to get it working. Even without the power plant on power boxes provide 10 power. 
---
Also you can steal them from others. Server hop till you find a world where the plant is running, if the workshop is owned they are likely farming cores. If you have a level 3 lockpick you can just break in and steal them. Just make sure you have no junk on you because you will become wanted. There will usually be 3 cores. If you bounce around the map long enough you can come back and get more as people do not check to see if the locks are broken (usually)
---
A flirtatious Assautron at that
---
True. 
---
I’ve also seen people string together a number of the smaller generators to power the core processor.
---
Ah gotcha, I appreciate the clarification 👍🍺
---
I got 1 hit by a lvl 100 molerat earlier today while browsing a player vending machine at a Forest Region Camp lol It's going to be though to defend Camps... I am repairing way more often in the PTS.
---
Peasants!😜😂
---
My subscription renews on the 4th and I've yet to receive mine..
---
One wasteland and damage recalculations you mentioned
---
until people stop firing because they've done their damage. Why waste any more ammo AMIRITE?
---
That would be awesome, what is your GT?
---
They would look so great with mod support.
---
Actually that would work too. Spend gold to get atoms. Not sure if it is a good business model though.🤓 If you owned stocks how would you like the idea?
---
Well that’s just an unfortunate reality for those people. Players that put in the time and effort should be the ones getting rewarded from the grind.
---
Yeh, I had a lvl 100 radtoad destroying over 10 items on my yard today lol
---
I was just curious because I did it for the first time ever today and I got the knight plan.  I thought it was rare but I thought it might be guaranteed.
---
Companions are getting a level boost but their damage is so little all the same.
---
Fixer Plans...I sell for 10k a pop.
---
Grinding Encryptid has been very profitable
---
I like the poop box they gave us just how it is!
---
I can do either and have a 3* junkies gauntlet I’d let go of. Will be on later...WestRider85
---
beth won't do anything because they're too busy counting their fallout 1st money
---
keep it. it weighs next to nothing., it counts for prewar food for the legendary run.
---
I dont, im very happy with my pet deathclaw
---
What you failed to grasp is, this post isn't about Mic etiquette alone, it's about what new players can do to not annoy the players who have so much to offer them. I have to "deal with it" plenty enough from the guys in my own crew who can actually pull thier own weight, I wont "deal with it" from someone who is not really helping at all other than to drive up the spawn rate. They get muted, and when they are muted, I cant hear them, savvy? How can I help someone I cant hear?
---
Why would I want I stop firing at the boss though? It’s just an indicator that I’m suggesting. Plus many people already know to do 1k damage to a boss so why would it make you not damage at it more?
---
can someone tell me why they would do this and lose money on paying coders and other employees when they can instead do nothing and rake in their free money (fallout 1st)
---
Like in the "Ready Player One" movie? 🤓👍
---
I do love me a one star nocturnal rolling pin from a queen fight.
---
As a fellow cultist I now feel compelled to make my own
---
What'd you get from the atomic shop for this build so I can better channel it's essence
---
cringe
---
It's not giving me any options. I have the raider collectron, but that's the only other one.
---
SurefireMarty1 
---
I'll be at my camp near WS
---
Cursed 90% reduced weight 3 star trash*
---
grats, thats also where I see all the dudes with hacked weapons sit to insta kill all th e ghouls with their 15 bullet explosive some kinda gun
---
I just got Elder the other day and I've probably done over 100 of them. I started about a week or two before wastelanders update.
---
Just nuke it  anyway, because he's glitched it way past  the budget.
---
Grahm knew it  !
---
I support things like this. Even halving the amount from each returned ... but clear or greatly increase the daily and bank limit for scrip.
---
And yeah, I'm sitting on well over 1k, cloding in in 2k. treasury notes.
---
Sir.
---
That’s what explosive bait is for...
---
Ammo 1 cap, junk 1 cap, plans 10%, everything else 20%
---
Also please don't send me a friend request just because I gave you a can of Pork n Beans, I  don't like being stalked through servers asking for more hand outs. Sorry guys I have been bitten before.
---
I was curious because the first time ever I did the quest I got one.
---
Omg your point about people you wanting to play their whole game for them reaches me at a deep level. Can’t stand when I help someone with a quest and all of a sudden they’re begging me to help them get through the entire story in one night. Like where’d common courtesy go?
---
This gift thing must be a nice cap stash.open a few hundred hit max caps?
---
I have about 1000...lots of public events
---
I’d love a lil liberator
---
Don’t think I’ve seen a faster down vote lmao
---
I love this
---
I use a two shot and don't VATS much with it. None of my energy pistols are really vats useful.
---
I can't remember exactly but I feel like I got the early ones pretty fast. The "officer" ones took forever. I remember I did get Sgt and I think Captain back to back.
---
I agree its so dumb I literally just stopped using it, Ill wait for gauss shotgun to start using the heavy ass 2mm ec again
---
I don't think that VATs thing is just the gauss pistol. I use an instigating lever action and it misses 95% shots alllllll the time. Crap fix but if you stop VATs then lock back on again it seems to hit then but ye really annoying.
---
Id pay a disgusting amount for Jack O'Lantern or JES-2R to be at my camp
---
I have too many...the game won't let me pick them up anymore :-/
---
So does the scavenger one
---
In my experience - first 3 turn ins I did, got a paint each time.  That was around L45-55, which was just a bit over a year ago, before the turn in ‘ takes every piece of tech data in your inventory’ fix.
---
Done a bunch of turnins since then, but have not gotten another paint.
---
Absolutely, and I've been bitten a LOT of times myself.. I keep adding though, I dont want to let the bad keep me from helping the good. But server stalkers are a real thing.
---
Look up "wire glitch" on YouTube to work around that.
---
Attached wires will always screw up blueprints. Always disconnect first. Huge problem with their logic. The same thing that prevents rotating is also what breaks blueprints.
---
honestly, I feel like its a bit overwhelming at times, especially when the sun rays are ultra blinding bright
---
Ahhhh, got you is it next week?
---
They likely can activate them. They can use instruments or workbenches so I would imagine any interactive items like the scarecrow would be the same.
---
Or another player wandered by and activated it.
---
Just the mothman camp bundle, statues, bed and lights from the atom shop
---
I’d love it. Because the positive PR bump from introducing a new method of getting Atoms through gameplay that was consistently available would likely be significant.
---
no thy are still in the game.  are you on ps4?  If so if I run across one again I'll pick it up for you.
---
I got a one star pool cue from Eddie
---
Sheesh 80,000 rounds for this awesome weapon
---
Maybe not you in general, but there are other players out there who would get the bare minimum and then stand off to the side.
---
I have 30k on each of five characters. Once you learn a serum recipe you can sell 3 serums daily to the robot vendors. I also traded a god tier gun for 10k presents, which I open to top up.
---
What Rammadeus posted.    
---
I've had over 200 pieces since I last did it months ago. If a Challenge says you must eat X number of pre-war food then that is he best to store in your stash. It doesn't do much of anything for AP.
---
You wrote a short novel to (let us call it what it really is) bitch about new players asking for handouts? Just ignore them. Mute them. Move on. I swear people will come on here to complain about anything to get that sweet karma. 
---
Would begging get annoying? Sure, but I honestly think people are exaggerating about how much it happens. Im almost lvl 300 with ~700 hours played and never seen a beggar, personally. Unless things have drastically changed in the month and a half i haven't played.
---
Let the downvotes begin! Lol, I don't care.
---
I believe it’s supposed to come out on the 15th
---
Wow that would creep me out.😀 I am already used to the scorcbeast falling out of the sky at Watoga Station when I fast travel there after the fight.
---
Takes foreverrrrr I've had a few paints but not got the black and red one yet. I must have turned that quest in hundreds of times
---
If you're on xb1 I've literally never used any of my treasure maps and prob never will I'm willing to donate all of them for the cause
---
I mean, I know it's a little unreliable with my gauss rifle, but still usually works at least half of the time if I jump in and out of vats, but with my hunters fixer and bloodied hunting rifle it works most of the time I'd say. Certainly nothing like this out of any of them.
---
Never find anything to spend them on!
---
I’ll buy ammo if I need it, I’ll buy a weapon if it’s at a decent price , after 1300 hours I have almost everything I need , just missing some decent ones for my sneak commando 
---
Since legendary modules became a thing vendors have lost a lot of interest for me, I’ll check everyone on my team and if I see a decent amount of weapons I’ll FT to them and check.
---
Having said that I got some great weapons this week, furious exploding combat shotgun for 1200, a furious exploding pump action shotgun for 800 and a “magic” 3 star junkies gattling laser for under 1500... first decent deals I’ve found for weeks
---
Cranbery relish and Gut shroom soup.Also joining buidling teams will boost int which means more xp
---
Been wanting to try and solo him. I only have a 1 star bloodied combat rifle. Don't know if I'll have enough damage to take him out. Good job on the kill!
---
"I hear a minors voice, it goes straight to mute" wouldn't be so quick to do this. Women play video games too and often are mistaken for a kid. It's happened to me and I'm 32. Once they find out I'm a woman, it can get pretty misogynistic too.
---
Yeah if a low level throws up the trade card i throw up the confused sign.like what could you posibly have that i would want or need?
---
I started the game and became 100% self sufficient and self reliant before i hit level 50.i make ammo,3 star armor,weapons with all mods.all by my lonesome.even launch nukes solo.
---
The most I've had was 12k and that was with help from the Legendary Run S1. I spent enough to get good gear which knocked me down to just over 8k. I'm past 12k again and don't like going crazy b/c I use it to fast travel without issue.    
---
If I try and 'play the market' as so many are doing then my stash will always stay 99% full.
---
You might be right, perhaps more people would purchase the game if there was such an option.
---
When I started with Game Pass I picked all the quality of life perks. I didn't play much of 4 so I don't even know what weapons I like. Heck, I'm level 114 now and I'm still not even sure. Now I'm working on a build.. so far I kinda like shotguns. Non-magic ones. So i've started building for those. I use heavy weapons for big events tho.. so I'm also building for that in events. Can't really decide which points to move around tho is my problem now. I need more Agility, but can't decide what to take from.
---
(*user name checks out*)
---
It's not a "bitch", it's a PSA. I'm trying to help these newbs keep thier sugar daddy's from blocking/unfriending  them.
---
I have no fucking clue what the fuck it is I should be doing in that event besides dying.
---
I believe It also counts as chewing gum.

The only thing IRL are the ones they use to look at atomic explosions and you can't just run all day without those things on and expect to be able to see.    
---
I do think if you have sunglasses or something similar you'd see a change if you were in first person. Glitchesda isn't going to make everything how we want it.
---
So your saying that some players would hit her for 1k damage and then do nothing afterwards? Then they would just fight the fodder mobs and still contribute in some way.
---
Oops didn't mean to reply to this. I apologize
---
What happened?*
---
I'll have to double check but I can make the deathclaw gauntlet and I might even have an extra "extra claw" mod.  Unless itll let me drop it after adding the claw myself
---
I'm not sure what causes it but definitely worse with some weapons. Really annoying. Are you 1st or 3rd person? I kinda remember one of my guns being worse in 3rd person
---
Had this happen this morning. If it happens again try to switch to a different emote. This broke the lock out for me and let me continue.
---
 I'm all for increasing all limits. I think you might be in the minority though. I've never had more than 50 and.dont play everyday.
---
This is stunning. Love how you incorporated the lighting.
---
Like the way that sounds the god drop.i only wanted one mask but now I keep one on all the time and painted the other for my display..wish I could display the outfits
---
I want a E-DE to follow me around! miss that cute little eyebot
---
1st person. Never even thought there might be a difference. Maybe I should try it in 3rd
---
It’s around 6%
---
That is a good nukable location for sending the commies a message.🤓👍☠
---
Could have server hopped first..........
---
sorry my man, I'm on PC. That said, I don't imagine the drop tables are different at the moment, so once I finish getting this data sorted it should be correct cross-platform.
---
They were from the Holliday event at Christmas people duped the gifts and use them to stay at max caps personally I have almost 8k on one account and 3k on my main account. I use them for trade as well
---
I’m a high defense bloodied. It sacrifices a bit on damage but bloodied is so strong I still 1 hit almost everything. I’m melee so I’m 
---
14 strength: 3 blocker, 3 barbarian, 3 iron fist, 3 Incisor, 2 Martial Artist, 
---
9 Perception, 3 concentrated fire, 3 armor penetration  one for guns, and then the last 3 I swap with 3 glow sight, or 3 rifleman, or 3 commando or 3 refractor for defense against mostly robots
---
8 Endurance: 4 Ironclad, 3 fireproof, 1 Radicool, 
---
3 Charisma: 1 Tenderizer, 1 Bodyguards, 1 Strange in Numbers
---
5 Intelligence: 2 Demolition Expert, 3 Nerd Rage
---
9 Agility: Big Mix but usually at least 1 Dodgy and 1 Evasive, I feel like I can afford less dr here, sometimes I go without both for more Sneak type cards, AP and Adrenaline 3
---
7 Luck: 3 Serendipty, 3 Class Freak, 2 Starched Genes 
---
I feel pretty good and almost never die. Well tbh I kill myself with explosive weapons which are probably 19/20 of my deaths. I am my own worst enemy
---
would be nice if bethesda did something cool like that when they detected cheating fks
---
[Looks like](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/chances.html?patch=P21A&amp;formids=0050E3FB) slightly more than a 4% drop chance for a BOS PA paint plan.
---
Worth a try :)
---
Oh, no doubt! Here's one for you: the other day I had someone I thought was a woman because of the high voice and maturity level, turned out to be just a very mature 13yr old boy. Not all of them squeakers are bad squeakers, but 8/10 put you in an awkward position, so I tend to be proactive.
---
And you turn in legendary you need to spend down and can buy modules.. but guess what, they weigh and we are still at 800lbs. ..
---
Hakt
---
Level scaling. In pvp the game scales low level players dmg up and high lvl players dmg down. Back when we had a survival server I used to love running around as a lvl 10 killing unsuspecting high lvl players.
---
Also the way pvp initiates you are expected to do zero dmg and until the other player attacks back. Pvp no longer auto engages for teams. So your attacks did no damage because pvp had not engaged. Then when they responded, pvp started and you died.
---
Have you tried it out to see what it looks like? There's quite a few versions of BOS skins you can get.
---
Soon(ish) you can
---
For me:
---
I use the perks to get extra meat and chems. Meat sells for so much, especially after events like heart of the swamp (cook it first. Make sure to use the super duper perk)
---
I also sell bulk junk, alcohol, all 1 star legendaries. This is all with max rank bargain perk and a grape mentat. All at regular merchants. On top of what I sell in vendors for cheap.
---
I don't want to learn it because I want to farm more of them.
---
Very cool. I like the whole vibe of the place
---
No sorry m8 im on xbox 1, but must appreciated though for the help
---
For real
---
np
---
Ya I got hundreds that week. You can easily score 10-15 an hour with minimal effort.
---
im recently getting back into this game and holy fuck, a 200 cap on bullion is annoying. i can grind that in ~2-3hrs with dailies and events. all it does is make it harder for me to get Secret Service armor. shits fucking annoying.
---
Hmmm ye you can do that but apparently the next tier skin only drops once you learn it. Like they drop in order. I imagine most people will have the first few skins
---
if hardline members of the brotherhood had their way, even sentient ghouls would be executed despite them being functional members of society, or at least what passes for it. you can see that in they way they treat your companions. the hatred for the other is deep rooted in the BoS by the 2200s.
---
when have they ever created "order"? they dont govern, they dont enforce any laws. the only thing that comes close, was lyons distributing water after the purifier is working, and we all know lyons ideas were not the brotherhoods mandate. THEY decided that only THEY could have technology even if it means people suffer. its arrogance, the same type of arrogance that lead to the war. the idea that only MY ideas and value sets can exist was the problem, not technology. if anything, tech would have saved the world, real fusion tech was being created, that could have solved the world energy crisis, but the US horded it to themselves, just like the BoS would do to technology that could make life in the wasteland better, and the pursuit of consolidating that tech leads to war and suffering every time.
---
depending on your choices, there is a big irradiated hole where Cambridge used to be because the brotherhood decided to destroy the reactor of the institute, they could have neutralized the science staff and killed or detained synths, then evaluated from there, but no, Arthur wanted his pound of flesh, he wanted to destroy everything, killing people born into the institute who could never have left even if they wanted too, killing many people on the surface, and creating a new radiological hazard for decades to come, destroying other research and technology that could have likely helped people.
---
irrespective of whether ghouls and mutants are a 'monument to mans arrogance' or not, there are still sentient beings among them, mutants like strong can think and feel, and can even be helpful and cohabitate with humans. brotherhood would kill them either way, without a though to what might be lost in doing so. fear drives the brotherhood, and fear and paranoia turns men into monsters.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty used to waiting two or three days to play a game while it downloads. My connection is usually pretty stable just super slow.
---
I actually read about this after everything went down. Sounds like a dumb idea. A low level player shouldn’t be able to destroy a high level player like that. What is the point of having the high level equipment of a low level can stroll up and kill you instantly?
---
I read that you might be able to use low level weapons or melee weapons?  Is that still a thing?
---
They're still pretty rare, so idk.
---
Soooo hopefully no fixes or patches until then :)
---
There’s a vending machine that you turn it into during the event and can get rewards from it it’s in the high school
---
because there are clownshoes who play this game who would stop firing/punching once they'd made their quota
---
Before the wastelanders lighting overhaul there were legit a few times where i had so many god rays I couldn't see more than 5 feet in front of me.  Looked 10 times worse than not having them at all.  Thankfully it seems to have been toned down a bit.
---
Why the heck is this not a tool tip in ge somewhere...can you push/pull objects too??
---
It’s usually tells you a teammate finished a quest. This was no notice. 
---
(It has since stopped)
---
Helps minimize the effects of trolling and harassment.
---
10/10 play of the year
---
Well I just tried and it keeps saying I need to sign in and when I do it says it again. Idk, it’s weird. I have game on my PlayStation also being I bought it awhile back when Redbox stopped selling games for like 3 dollars. So I have the game and PlayStation plus so idk why I can’t do it. Sorry wish I could’ve helped. I never saw these rewards on my Xbox game either.
---
I’ve been on the PTS and have played with the new mechanics. I’m not to worried about the damage nerf at all. I’ve had a good time honestly and I’m looking forward for those legendary perks that I think are coming on the 15th also.
---
Anything good?
---
Ye probably sell well, how many you gotten so far tho? Feel like you'll need to grind that to death to get many to sell?
---
Yes, content in the *next* patch, wink wink.
---
Its no problem. Thank you for trying
---
If you really want the rewards, you could always buy levels with atoms. The atoms you get from the run can buy 4-5 levels i believe, assuming you haven't used them.
---
Can't wait for it to be hpnest just hoping a certain pa thing doesn't get patched until i get back from holiday on Sunday XD
---
you can choose not to destroy the institute as the player. and the other factions destroying the institute in the same fashion could be seen as just as short sighted, but we arent talking about them, we're talking about the brotherhood...
---
Exactly, the cursed weapons will probably get a nerf too and replaced with meatpile plans so that 40 scrip will be very hard to get.
---
It sucks. Hopefully it’ll get fixed soon.
---
Just 1.  But I feel like they'd sell for a decent amount.
---
Yeah unless you use atoms and buy the rewards.
---
It's a little over 3000 score/level by the end. Can you do that in time? If not maybe this is z good time to use the atoms you were given.
---
Thanks ! Did not know that, i have fallout 1st so missing some atoms does not matter to me. Thankyou !
---
Yes and no. For the queen, it's easy enough to stand on top of a fence or a survival tent and avoid taking damage from the adds(I can confirm from experience, makes using bloodied heavy weapons more effective, but you could just as easily stand there and not fight anything.) The bigger issue would be the Windigo Colossus fight since it is instanced and limited to 8 players. People already don't fight the adds and some players already join the event and don't do anything(go afk at the entrance) Imagine if they did their 1k damage and then (purposely) got killed to stand up at the top where they won't take damage. Just being there makes more Windigo spawn during the event. 
---
Would it be nice to have a feature like this? Sure, but definitely not without players who would abuse it to save on their resources.
---
Up until I was about L150, I rarely had more than 6-8k caps At any given time.
---
  Now I’m at a point where 95% of the plans in a given vender say (known), so spending gets a bit more difficult.  You start buying random stuff just to stay under limit.
---
I didn’t need that vampire compound bow, but I bought it Just to spend a 1k caps.  Ended up making it all back the same day.
---
  I’m a melee build, so rarely roll For a 3\* ranged...did I really need to spend 5 digits on a fixer plan?  No, but I had about 25k caps at the time....
---
Dumped another 6k on bullion the same day.
---
  4 days later, between vendor sales, looting, and selling serums to bots, had recovered the cost of both.
---
Don’t remember it’s been awhile since I’ve done that event
---
I would argue that it reverses the effects of trolling and harassment. I would bet that if the low level players knew this happened, it would happen more often.
---
Or maybe even have different servers for pvp and pve, a la Conan.  Although not the server controls (as much as I’d like that). Just the ability to choose what pv we want when we join.  It could even be the X option toggle at the bottom in the Play server selection screen. 📺
---
I feel your pain
---
Script kiddies just flexing for lols. PC NW can be an absolute wasteland in the wrong kind of way right now.
---
You're free to call it what you wish to if in the end it makes you feel better. 
---
Those "newbs" who beg will, for the most part, stop playing after a month or so. If you're begging, i would go as far to say they just want the best stuff asap, play a bit of what little endgame there is, maybe try to grief some players, then move on to another game. They probably dont care who blocks them.
---
But that's just my two cents. Regardless, hope you're enjoying the game for the most part. I wish Bethesda would release a ton of endgame content. I'd love to come back and play. Discovered Destiny 2 a couple weeks ago and I'm really impressed with it.
---
Yea that’s the whole point behind this idea, so no ammo is wasted... until everyone gets smart and the event fails.
---
ReflectedOhio51
---
Shh! Don't give him any ideas.
---
well that trade limit just \*\*\*\*es me off 
---
so now I am expected to store ammo I do not want/can't use, from to day to day instead of trading it in  when I want/need to
---
lets see missile ammo 2 lbs each nope guess ill go back to dropping the excess ammo and \*\*ck Bethesda
---
Yes how?
---
Well, thanks for sharing I had never been there before lol How do you open the cell doors though? \*gives award\*
---
That little cave has been so useful for some of the SCORE challenges.
---
They’re good exp in my opinion, and most of them have very low chance of giving rare plans, so if you want to collect all the plans you’ll have to do them alot.
---
It does not unfortunately
---
I am wondering the same.
---
Play the early quests. There's a great solo game here, at least early on, that should be enjoyed. Learn who the Responders were, do the Mysteries quests, creep around and explore the Forest region. There are so many excellent small places that don't matter in the big play of things, but are wonderful. Walk across the suspension bridge. Explore old resort cabins. There's a bed and breakfast area where owners would trick visitors with pretend ghosts and earthquakes.
---
Don't rush. I've seen level 20s in the Savage Divide and The Mire. Not saying you don't belong there, but even if you manage to survive, let the game unfold. It wasn't until I was maybe in my 30s or 40s that I really started paying attention to other players (primarily because I knew what weapons I was looking for).
---
Doesn't give low lvls an advantage. Just levels the playing field. You could have killed them in two hits as well. The reason you did no damage is because you forgot that pvp has to be initiated by both parties through attacks before any damage happens.
---
Use the hot key to swap your weapon and it breaks the loop
---
yeah, this is really frustrating for me, too, i can't even do events because i get so many exterminator rolling pins that i can't sell anywhere, so they just lay around and quite litterally take up space in my stash
---
What about the 100 scrip?
---
Point of Order:  It was the citizens of Harper's Ferry PRE Free States that killed Vault 94 and created the Mire.
---
It was just a bug in the "Private Test Server". Some perk cards weren't working properly and weren't multiplying the gun damage. It has been fixed.
---
Who runs Barter Town?
---
No, it's great for reading though, goes for 1 cap each on trading forums so some people will take it as payment.
---
You mean the one junk 3 star weapon from Grandma?
---
daily and weekly, which I think are still doubled For the next couple days
---
You need about 3400 score per level right now, so the math is relatively straightforward.
---
If you buy a level with atoms, you dont lose score against the current level, it transfers (at least, it did for me when I did so at the 150 atom reward (effectively, a free level) around the 80 mark.
---
You’ll get 500 atoms on reaching 100, so if you have that many, you can buy 3 levels and still come out 50 atoms ahead)
---
Yeah! Same thing happened last month but only took 1 day. Will see tomorrow!
---
The mire has become my favorite part of the map, it has a kind of eerie beauty to it
---
(So you're not even playing anymore?) I assure you, I have endless amounts of fun, and, for what it's worth, I even find entertainment in the naivety of these same newbies. However, one last time for the hard of hearing, I made this post to help those same newbs not be so annoying... like, something to add, constructive criticism? I was a newb myself once too.
---
Oohhh, you can tell that I don’t do pvp very often.  He must pvp more frequently than I do. He didn’t shoot me until I figured something was up and started to leave. Then he shot me from behind. Smart on his part. Now I understand. Thank you for the clarification.
---
Nope.
---
Thought it was just me, have not been able to see what I am buying for ages now
---
thank you very much :)
---
I have limited play time, and rarely have 20 each day because I'm trying to do other things. Events I don't care to do are tea time, swarm of suitors cuz of bugged enemies and feed the people. The enemies are trash. No legendary item chances.
---
With the past meat week however, I went from barely 20 a day to 120 notes on me and I felt rich. Yea even though most the time I won't be able to take advantage of like to see more gold limit on the vendor machines as well as see those vendors in the vault you spend them in.
---
It is a tooltip, at least on pc. Started a new character and the first time I built a camp it told me to press enter to enter this mode.
---
Yes just exploit mechanics to grief people, it's ok when I do it hehe
---
I’m gonna give this a 10/10 Kerrang review.
---
the brotherhood needs the food from the region whether or not the player helps, they arent going to just not eat after all. they will take that food one way or another. 
---
they brotherhood sends you on 'Cleansing the Commonwealth' that are nothing more than kill missions. things they deem a threat. killing mutants ect is a CORE part of the brotherhood.
---
name one time they have actually shared tech with common people. in over 200 years all they have dont is horde tech for themselves. the outlier being lyons with water distribution, but lyons ideas were snuffed out by the actual brotherhood loyalist, making him irrelevant in the end. 
---
they horde weapons, a giant robot, small nuclear arms, they built and airship, on and on, in order to consolidate military power in order to further their aims whatever they may be. its pure consolidation of power. what is a peasant going to do when the guy in power armor tell them to pick up the can? they are going to pick up the can, because the brotherhood doesnt need to govern, they just use deterrence to get their way. the brotherhood is sometimes willing to cooperate with another faction, but its never by choice, its always desperation or some larger existential threat. they also instigated a war with the ncr because of elder rhombus's reactionary tech hording, they directly tried to impose policy on the NCR
---
most of the cell keys can be found around, one is in Huntersville hidden near a bed on a second floor accessible by a leaning tree.
---
It is working as intended.  It allows you to loot SB's that may have fallen out of bounds or in inaccessable areas such as the fissures.
---
I spent between 10k to 15k caps a day on average and I am always between 20k and max caps.
---
Its all about how well you do with your vendors.
---
I don't even bother trying to get the 1400 caps a day from vendor bots anymore.
---
Or bethesda can stop using the server load excuse to hold back scrap boxes and unlimited stash weight from regular players since they're considering pets and companions without server loads being a problem now apparently
---
Ah shit you said the K word! Thank you though, it was all worth it
---
No I meant like a tip in how to push pull things or raise lower them like op put. PC the controls are wayyy better for building. PS4 it's pretty frustrating on top of the frustrating mechanics in general.
---
The best ones I would look out for are bloodied: damages increases as health decreases, 2 shot: you fire an extra projectile with every shot(doesn’t use more ammo), fire rate/swing speed (25% faster attack speed, explosive (bullets explode on impact, vats cost: 25% less vats cost, and furious: damage increases with each consecutive hit on a single enemy, and +250 damage resistance while reloading (I forgot the effect name) P.S. only one of the legendary effects will be in the weapons name, hit inspect to view all the effects
---
That's quite a stretch of the imagination to think this will be a problem. The forest will cap at level 50 no matter how high of a level you are, so it won't be the most viable source of exp for level 100+
---
that's not really the point....shouldn't have to server hop just because some douche decided to go afk before backing out of the vendor.  It's literally just one button to back out.
---
If you're looking for someone to show you the ropes in game hit me up.
---
PSID: Gumbybum21
---
idk I'm fine with it. They said this is the first step in changes and those later steps are definitely needed on top of this. But for now, just having more enemies to fight and actually finding a challenge once in a while is good enough to keep things interesting. Beyond level 70 or whenever you finish your build, most of the game content became a pointless chore to go through, now you can at least revisit things and have some level of mental stimulation
---
Not a bow user but this would be aesthetically pleasing for everyone.
---
True this is annoying. But if you click like you are going to buy and don't confirm you can read the whole name at least. Helps me when I see a Unyielding painted meta...
---
Click buy. See confirm purchase.
---
Oh it's a right leg nice.
---
I am 95% against griefing.  The other 5% I'm okay with is when people deserve it.  This would be one of those cases.
---
Do everything you can and buy your levels Tuesday am if you don't make it. It works be alot of repeatables to get there I think at this point. Depends how bad you want those lay few rewards
---
I know the feeling, my SS armor took me months to get a matching set. I have the full unyielding set but I’m still trying to get a piece with poison resist and blocking secondaries
---
I think everything should be valued according to its usefulness, rarity, and demand. So the mole miner gauntlet plan is trash but the fixer plan is 10k. Why would I price something that took me days and days and days of grinding at a cap value I can make in 5 minutes selling junk to a vendor bot?
---
Legendary effects that are useful add to the value. Legendary effects that suck, add absolutely nothing to the value. For example.: a 3 star Gatling gun with bloodied, bashing, and Vats AP is worth the exact same as a 1 star Gatling with bloodied.
---
Will try if it ever happens again. Thank you!
---
Trump 2020
---
You mean choose not to destroy the Institute by joining the Institute? Or just not playing the last missions? 
---
I'm bot sure that counts
---
especially as the characters draw the arrows seemingly from nowhere...
---
Well, that issue is a problem even before the patch hits. It's costly to play with shiny toys, I suppose
---
They're some inside the blacksite but very well hidden. They blend in with the environment.
---
 https://imgur.com/7iZNZ2N
---
As far as I can tell there is nothing in place to detect cheating.  Nothing, zero...not a damn thing.
---
How hard can it possibly be to run a script that says "this person has 20 kills and has been 200 feet above the map for 3 minutes straight"
---
I'll gather what I can and put my own spin on it when I get a new ps plus subscription. Thanks fellow acolyte
---
Only thing I can add is this....
---
Take me HOME!
---
As a current level 20 I apologise for his actions we are not all like him/her
---
Seconded on the vamps gatling laser
---
I actually got into the Savage Divide at my early 20s, but not because i was rushing the Main quest , i didnt even knew what to do after dealing with the Duchess , i just Explored a shit load , because i knew once i got high enough level , i was just going to fast travel around.
---
I appreciate your thumbs and will raise a toe to you, as I'm currently typing with my thumbs
---
not all object works for the following trick but some do  
---
\- destroy the thing with a flamethrower trap  
---
\- remove ( store flame trap )  
---
\- try placing it again, some hitbox are now gone
---
I hope so that would be nice
---
Excellent review, keep up the good work.
---
The witticisms are what really make it pop.
---
Wish I could updoot twice
---
Get gramps instead
---
700 hours? End game content? lol
---
2850 hours here and I'm still finding stuff I hadn't seen before.
---
He can share what he wants, if you join a public team its not up to the other members to accomidate your build.
---
Bonus fact - you can run a heavy weapons sneak build using a flamer. Get a legacy explosive version and have a blast.
---
Be sure to screenshot his name and report it to Bethesda they will handle a suspension or ban
---
How about you use push to talk or mute yourself unless talking.
---
Nope this was just 76
---
No problem. Pvp in the adventure server is very much skewed towards the second player to act, unless it is pvp over a contested workshop or a wanted player.
---
That's part of the (original) main questline though isn't it?
---
I think you're actually supposed to go there, since you get the Top of the World radio signal fairly early. It's just harder.
---
I agree. If you need to go AFK do it anywhere but not while in trade menu with the vendor. Bad form.
---
Occasionally I also encounter disturbed players like that,  you did the right thing.
---
I would definitely call that a win for you in my book! Good for you!
---
I appreciate it greatly and I have too much spare time on my hands to I can spend 5 minutes thinking of stupid shit to say. I'm running out of megapopular Queen songs for the into but there's always Michael Jackson and The Eagles to go for. Thank you for your updoot regardless!
---
Nah i don't think he deserves and besides i don't have any evidence.
---
There should be an option to refuse the sharing of a card.
---
I'd like to have an eyebot broadcasting Enclave propaganda.
---
What mask did they want?
---
There are a lot of suggestions on this sub about maximising your INT stat and Exp gains in order to rank up with the "Gain 10000 Exp" challenge. It's not going to be easy, but if you have the time to invest and a good strategy in mind you could make 9 levels in 2 days.
---
That makes sense. My buddy owned the workshop, so I was not technically a part of the workshop being contested, which is why all of the other stuff happened. And explains a couple of other things from my pvp history as well.
---
Lesson learned... set up lots of turrets near the console.
---
It’s manually updated.  It’s unlikely we won’t pass it. Since it’s embarrassing to Bethesda if they aren’t all exceeded.
---
Maybe obvious, to most, but do you always repair with Weapons Artisan(level 3)..?
---
My two-shot Gauss rifle lasts so much longer, albeit I committed to maxing that card for use in CAMP early on after reading about it. Some guns take an age to break. Shame there isn't one for armour...
---
That would work, but Still cant tell people how to play the game, they can share what they want.
---
Trying to initiate PvP isn’t a breach of ToS. 
---
Launching a nuke at someone’s camp isn’t a breach of ToS. 
---
Sending a message isn’t a breach of ToS, unless the message contained language that is prohibited. 
---
Bethesda won’t do anything about this.
---
As far as I can tell, yes.
---
Or an eyebot
---
The Reeper 5419 
---
-yes it’s spelt that way
---
Kind of ironic you say hard of hearing yet the very first post I mentioned I wasn't currently playing, lol.
---
Your original post isn't to help people out, it's to bitch about people begging. I think it's common sense not to beg and pester people. The ones that do that simply don't care. They're not going to come read this and be like, "Oh! So it's not normal to beg and whine to get what I want?" Lol, come on. Helping people my ass. You're just hopping on the most recent bandwagon for karma farming. Typical of this subreddit here recently.
---
Pvp is part of ther game, nukes including nuking camps is part of the game. 
---
I can see reporting for homophobic slurs, racism, or similar but there's nothing in the op that is even remotely banable or even warranting any punishment whatsoever. 
---
And if you think reporting players in this scenario forres anything, it doesn't.  I pvp most of the time i play these days and I'm sure ive been reporting many dozens or hundreds of times, never been suspended or banned as ive never broken the tos once.
---
Tbh.im not sure.i just happened upon it yesterday after doing the heart of the swamp.i do not remember it being part pf it,but i play fallout games almost backwards.do everything i can and know everything before i take on the big stuff.
---
Lol no, i want a pet, specially, Weasel at my camp.
---
I had this happen a few weeks back as well
---
Ok, thank you for your contribution, have a nice day.

[Fallout 76 Build with 15/4/3/3/7/9/15](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4DAgIGCA4BAQEALhABTwNRA2UCaANvBXcDtwEDeAKhAQOAAQLMAQM2AsIBAfABA8YBAaIBAtUBA/EBA8QBA/IBA0ADQQEA)
---
I think there is a recent yt vid about the new content coming,but i could be mistaking it with another location.not hawks hideaway or hideout,can't remember.i play too many damn games.lol.something else.
---
Best of luck mate. Long term Fallout fan here, but only got 76 last Christmas.
---
Send me a friend request if you like - stov1es -  I'm usually on most days,  mornings or late on GMT time.
---
He happy to give you a hand on a mission or mod up some weapons or armour for you.
---
I hope they fired the guy who okayed the original
---
Ooooh thanks my bad
---
*ahem* T U R R E T S
---
I raise your wink wink and give you a nudge nudge.
---
*oxhorn enters* I SMELL LORE
---
Communist bad, ‘merica good! Lol
---
I do not care for player to player trades. I have  a vending machine with most items at one cap each. Most items on my character are not up for trades. I wave off trade requests and go do my tasks for the limited time I have.
---
Angry Turtle knows more about this game than the people who made it. 
---
But you could also look for Darryl Hall on YouTube: his jamming sessions with fellow musicians are fantastic. "From Darryl's Home" is the name of the series. 
---
Great for this pandemic, really. And you can play Fallout AND listen to some music at the same time.
---
Have you tried just putting them in your stash box? Some things can’t be sold/dropped but they usually tell you. If that doesn’t work it might be a glitch, but on the + side, they don’t weigh anything.
---
I had one for months then all of a sudden it was gone.
---
You should get more rewards for putting in more damage. If you just meet the minimum that should return minimal award. Its like getting C for all your subjects but you still get a diploma...
---
Join the Brotherhood and they'll help you eliminate this mutant menace.
---
Bug goes back to FO4.  Nothing like bugs years old now.... never fixed.
---
Don't attack the stoners on reddit man.  Lesson learned lol
---
You can't repair.  Only way to get turret back is moce your CAMP.  Great option right?
---
Or just don’t let how others play bother you to write a essay on it.
---
You might be the only person in this subreddit who doesn't have over 200 treasury notes rotting because of the daily cap.
---
Unless you are asking just because of curiosity.
---
What does it even give anyway
---
&gt; Bye, Felicia
---
FTFY
---
Had to get rid of them for two reason.
---
1: Budget. Literally couldn’t place any of the cool stuff I got from the season because of no camp budget.
---
2: They kill my pets. And not only do they kill my pets while I’m loading in unable to do anything about it, but they also pick fights with every single passive mob that wanders by. This includes vertibots which can unload a lot of damage on the house in a short amount of time, and Invincible Merchants like Grahm or even worse, Athena with her non stop head laser. Came home one day to find Grahm literally tearing my base down.
---
Good ideas, I've actually compiled a list of several easily executed ideas (that I have seen on Reddit)and sent them( email and snail mail) to Beth( I am sure I am not the only one who has done this), but have heard nothing from them.
---
Dig this, more downvotes than the guy who posted "Trump 2020" and nothing else... now that's saying something
---
Lol no.
---
It’s better now two years later but holy hell was it bad.
---
I've never seen my turrets attack anything that didn't shoot them first
---
That could be changed by converting all existing Treasury Notes in to a Legacy version maybe.
---
ANTIFA are terrorists
---
I’ve been doing the same with solar armor trying to get a full set of sentinel I have one piece and I have two others with assassins on them I also have the unyielding for that armor right now I’m wearing an assassins ss chest piece for the jet pack and arms and legs plus mask are solar armor it looks pretty cool oh and the grey Barrett
---
Ooooof.  I hadnt experienced it in fo4 and only recently seen it in 76.  Impressive that they cant even balance their previous game 😂
---
Maybe one of your team mates is pvping somebody.
---
That’s saying you’re butt hurt about “Trump 2020” get ready soy boy. The Trump train is coming.
---
Hit the npc vendor every day for 1400 caps by selling guns (I like to clear out cranberry bog workshop once or twice for this). And sell junk at your player vendor. Junk sells well. I horded all my junk from lv1-120 and started selling all of it over the course of last week (I keep ~100 of each type just in case). I have made enough caps to buy 4 mutation serum recipes so far. Working on the 5th now, half way there. Plan was to buy 1 of each flux type serums so I can always be selling them after a boss fight. And mutation serums sell often enough at cheap prices (I sell mine at 300).
---
Big ol' oof to that.  It's unfortunate the budget is small and turrets take up so much already.   Sad excuse for a company if they cant even balance their previous titles.
---
Count yourself lucky then, because it’s a very common glitch. Someone made a post recently about coming home to find their pet dead and Grahm breaking walls because the turrets picked a fight with him.
---
Unless they're using a prime capacitor, they will use the standard energy weapon ammo
---
This was informative and entertaining, we thank you
---
This isn’t a hard game where you need a team. Everything can be soloed. You honestly just sound like you have aspergers
---
Ultracite weapons use regular ammo. Ultracite mods require special ammo. I think that's how it's always been. It has never made sense.
---
Take me home to the moldest grave I belong fallout 76 please kill me
---
That smart machine gives you a 1star legendary. This is the only way to get a legendary dragon at the moment in game
---
sort of, because the player assumes administration of the institute, theoretically you could choose to take the institute in a different direction, or being dismantling it, its all post game head cannon though.
---
part of the problem is that the writing for this story is kinda shitty, nuking the institute as the *only* option for each faction? yeah thats unlikely. the railroad would want to get the data and kind all the synths they could, the brotherhood would want to examine the tech and horde what they want (if not for Arthurs hubris) and the minutemen would just be a manifestation of the player character's leadership so whos to say.
---
nuking the institute is a shitty thing to do with any of the factions.
---
Oh lord.. we got another one. I'm not even a liberal, Trumptard.
---
Guys, I’m pretty sure he is saying that he needs help progressing through the quest where you have to find RaRa and get her back to Crater, as he keeps getting killed by the Assaultron.
---
I‘ll be on later and can help you get through that part, I got stuck on it too. DM me your psn and I will shoot you a message when I’m getting on.
---
Flair is set as PS4 Help
---
Never said you were a liberal. Trump 2020 hahahaha
---
As the kids say: fuck around and find out. That's just bad mmo etiquette. I mean, what'd they think they were gonna do?😂
---
Me either!!! Only time I’ve ever seen legendary scorched was during the Christmas event...Mind if I ask where are you encountered him? Is it the same place you encountered the other one?
---
Edit- oh, and the one in Morgantown airport
---
Yeah that makes more sense. Appreciate the answer!
---
Yeah the problem is that 76 isn’t single player, it’d be too much work to make it fit into multiplayer. Each player having a whole town to themselves is simply too much. Camps on their own are already pretty limited.
---
Honestly you should just not be able to loot people.
---
You're right, I apologize,  I shouldn't feed the Trump trolls
---
Maybe somthing came up in real life that was more important than the game.
---
Thank you and it's my pleasure!
---
oh no someone was obnoxious, lets get them banned! 
---
honestly this is a much more pathetic position then the dummy with the legacy rifle.
---
1700 hours in here and have only seen maybe 2 or 3 in the wild other than the Christmas event.
---
 Super rare, congrats!
---
Yea you better apologize. Go drink your soy
---
Ughhh... scumbags. Yeah, girls play videogames. There's no need to mansplain every damn thing to someone who has likely been playing games just as long as any of us. Not saying that the misogyny ends at gamer elitism of course!
---
It gives you a regular 3 star as well.
---
If you don't like your cursed weapon drops, I'll be happy to take them off of your hands.
---
Selling stuff to NPC vendors helps, but I make money selling good things at my player vendor. Price it to sell and you will be rolling in caps.
---
Ah I missed that. My bad
---
Your reply seems to fly in the face of what public teams are-- a temporary cooperative undertaking between players based on a mutual intent or goal. I would say it's more that players can decide to share or not to share, but there should be some consideration of one does decide to share. 
---
I once nicely asked someone if they wouldn't mind _not_ sharing a card (I think it was the one that made it easier to get rads) because it was causing me to die. They did it,  no issue or complaint. Asking someone not to share a card doesn't change their build,  it just keeps them from screwing up yours; they don't have to remove the card from their perk load out. I've only got 4 charisma,  so i'm limited in what I can share. I usually share luck of the draw or inspirational. Sometimes I ask if my team has a preference. Being polite and considerate is not hard and certainly doesn't make anyone less of a player.
---
Agreed. Unless I'm having a sale of unneeded legendaries "elsewhere", I've learned the hard way to keep messages and requests turned OFF.
---
Yup, and you keep up the good work of making Trump supporters look like good people.. you're doing a great job. 
---
P.s. I dont drink soy
---
Well done!
---
If you add lone wanderers perk does that add 20% more reduction?
---
I experience this so often at player vendors. I just want to check the unyielding armor, maybe the bolstering or vanguard. Are you reading every piece of armor in there?!?! Then I get in and scroll through the prefixes in a few seconds. Nothing of interest. Thanks. Bye.
---
This community is the best. I'm levels 200+ and 150+ and whenever I see a low level getting mobbed I go into momma bear mode and will beat the ever loving fuck out of whats hurting a low level (and then throw stimpacks and water at them)
---
Hmmm, maybe said player was curious if a 2nd drop on an active sbq event would spawn a 2nd sbq.  Would be alot of fun if it workee that way
---
There's absolutely tons of good mods if you're on PC. Easily enough to double the playthrough's length.
---
It’s alright the left is already complacent and looks the other way for looters, rioters, and communists. Their image can’t sink any further. Besides, reddit is mostly left wing edgy soy boys and girls who dye their hair pink.
---
Yeah they must *really* have gotten to OP to warrant this level of effort. It's not like the noobs asking for stuff will even read this thread, it's just annoyed high levels agreeing with each other with likely no effect on the problem in the end.
---
Ultracite Laser = Normal ammo
---
Prime Ultracite Laser = Ultracite ammo (primed receiver is a mod that drops from queen)
---
It would be 20 of the remaining 30, so 15.  But I recommend empath, class freak, and strange in numbers.  All of those, combined with being on a public team with someone else who's mutated, gives you 25% more reduction, more than lone wanderer.  It brings the total up to 77.25% damage reduction before damage resistance.
---
Besides it is so easy to just ignore other players lol.
---
they just need to make boss loot global and not rely on a hidden tag integer. this would prevent the dreaded insta kill no loot scenarios.
---
Yeah, press and hold E to go into this mode. It's crazy unintuitive
---
If you didn't want to pvp why did you shoot back ? Just go about your business and let them waste ammo,  what you did was an extremely pu#$y move
---
Fuck sake man, ITS A FALLOUT SUBREDDIT. If reddit is all edgy soyboys, go spout your propaganda on QAnon or something.
---
The one that doesn't suck is probably the right choice.
---
I’ve had two deathclaws, a Yao Guai, and a possum all die from my own turrets... You have my condolences.
---
I take it your turrets aggro’d him? My turrets pick fights with invincible merchants and vertibots all the time.
---
Said like a true Responder. Well done!
---
I have been playing for 9 months, few tips I JUST found out.  
---
1. Rare drops are based off what you can construct.  I have spent thousands of items on random rares, until a week ago zero clmbat shotguns.  Got the plan and now they seem to be dropping left and right.....sigh.  Once you settle on a chosen weapon find its plan!
---
2. The SS Armor is RARE armor, not power armor and NOT non rare armor.  Will not matter to you for probably a month or two, thank me later (again, just found this out, been hoarding bullion forever).  I worded this funny, but remember this and thank me later
---
3. You can easily craft adhesive from veggies.  Actually discovered this awhile back, but all of a sudden low on adhesive and remembered this quick easy, and free way to get it
---
YOU wasted his nuke?  LOL!
---
The game has never heard the word "optimized" before.
---
Lol here’s a mug that says “I barely fought the colossus and all I got was this stupid mug, 2 diluted stimpacks, 3 missiles, 17 40mm grenade rounds, 10 .38 rounds, and some floater grenades.”
---
Lol Reddit is literally a communist hive mind bubble. What is Qanon ? Lol and what’s it have to do with you being a communist bum?
---
If you just let them shoot you it costs not only their time and ammo but also their pride. Its also not quite the best idea to pvp back in cause you get jumped by other people too.
---
There is one for armor, Fix it Good, also in Int. Doubles the durability bar of the repaired armor when maxed out.
---
Personally, I find the lack of actual content to be a much bigger issue. Even if they removed those limits, I would still be getting off the game after doing my daily challenges. I understand some people love the loot grind, and that's fine, but we need legitimate activities.
---
Make room in your heart and stash for both.
---
\*sad noises of 548lvl\*
---
I would keep both and get rid of something else or sell the quad
---
I try to blueprint my vendors so I don’t have to reload them. It’s only worked twice out of 30-40 times.
---
It's just a crappy re-color, not missing much.
---
I want to but I can't reason why to keep two fixers.
---
A little blunt but this is the right answer. 
---
OP, I would try both fixers out personally and see which one works for you, but those are both totally serviceable weapons.
---
Yes until you fight anything other then ghouls lol.
---
New collectron skin should be produced. He cleans our c.a.m.p. and puts those junk in to the box.
---
Seems like Enclave fans here like to gloss over the fact they had their own little Unit 731 brewing.
---
U think I could sell it? I usually just scrap it
---
I think in 1900 hours I’ve seen two legendary scorched, first one was at 1200 hours in the glassed caverns, it showed up while doing that touch a rock spawn a group of scorched thing. Second one I saw was around 1500 hours, it Showed up during Collision Course.
---
Updated once a day, but not on the weekends
---
They are both really good. And I guarantee you that you have items in your stash that you can remove to make room. 
---
Q: How many power armor chassis do you have in your stash?  How much Steel Scrap do you have in your stash?
---
I put 1000 on my vendor for 2 caps each and they sold fairly quickly.
---
I have a lot saved up because I only bought plans for things that I felt were necessary. I'm hoping that future vendors will use the same currency. If not, it sounds like we will at least be able to buy lunchboxes and other items in the next patch.
---
I'm ok with 90% reduced weight trash because it barely takes up any stash. What's infuriating is like a 1 star nocturnal minigun. 20 pounds for 5 scrip? Pass
---
This is why I visit as many camps as I can per session. I love seeing this kind of creativity. Where is it on the map?
---
I’ve had better luck crafting 10 at time for weapons and armor. A bit more of a grind and slightly more wasteful when it comes to crafting, but 7 out 10 times I do this I actually get what I want or something very close to what I want.
---
I actually received a shopping list in a message for the first time today:
---
Pls can I have stimpaks, radaway, aluminium, steel, springs and screws I'm new to the game
---
Had a quick look at their in game achievements and sure enough it was evident that they'd only started out a day or so ago, but still... is this a thing now?
---
I got 2 power armor chassis and 6 bulk scrap
---
Some of us do look at every piece of armor and every legendary weapon in the hopes that it’s a low level weight reducing armor piece or rare legacy. Sometimes I do, but I don’t often have the energy to go through everything. Or maybe even unlearned plans.
---
&gt; Never find anything to spend them on!
---
Oh okay, I have the opposite problem. Just recently I bought all the rewards for ACP (funnily enough the pickaxe was the hardest to find, but I eventually found someone selling it for 1k caps). And just prior to that, I purchased all the stuff I missed out on at Meat Week. That bankrupted me pretty badly.
---
People will buy any fixer. I sold a stalkers for 4000 caps. You should try both if you don’t want to keep them. They can get you more than I got if you decide to sell one.
---
Its perfect. Bethsoft will hate it
---
Evidence of what,  the other player availing himself or herself of the in game mechanics?
---
&gt; name one time they have actually shared tech with common people
---
The NCR... in California. Even in fallout 1 they were trading with the Hub...
---
You say whatever their aims may be like you don't know what they are, you should, it's preserving old-world tech through the dark age... 
---
Yeah, they need to eat, they are people. I'm sure they get food through a number of means. Again, the thing you are complaining about is entirely between Teagen and the player, as in you, the player.  
---
As for killing mutants, that is a very different statement than your last, and yes, they should be killing mutants, especially in Boston where the Institute has let them run rampant and kill so many people.
---
&gt; Told them to go suck a Bloated Glowing One's recently radiated taint.  
---
And that's how you get rad worms....
---
Today I learned that you can only have 32(ish) items of the same name because my stash is filled with *Aa Scrip* weapons
---
there are pets?
---
Thank for the advice I'll give them both a shot see what's better.
---
Keep both. 2nd is a mean boss weapon. Reloads are what slow down destruction potential for high health minions.
---
i wish we could hide player levels.... at level 800, im getting very tired of being buggered constantly by new players asking for things and other people blaming every event mishap and lost legendary on me. when i log into my lower level alts... no problems lmao.
---
at this point i just dump my useful garbage for low levels, but thats it. i wont talk to them, wont craft them shit anymore or coach them. after 3000 hours, and hundreds of noobs helped one way or another, im tired.
---
Don't touch y kids you psycho! We are all like this mate
---
I think it ends up being better actually, but I could be wrong. I've only got 2 myself and I already regen AP fast enough that I don't feel the need to increase it any more.
---
I sell every drug I pick up.
---
What a moron. Since you know their name, block &amp; move on.
---
I’m at the golf course.
---
Level 50 mutts spawn out the back and very rarely are they able to destroy anything.
---
My turrets are just the basic turrets too.
---
I think it comes down to defence placement...having well placed fences for them to attack works well so that while their attacking the fence your turrets can hit them
---
Oxhorn is my favorite fallout exploration/lore youtuber
---
I don't know your build, but the B25agi fixer has more value objectively due to it doing more damage per bullet- it will be more prevalent in patch 22. You can sell the quad fixer for 4 digits worth of caps
---
It's such poor form.
---
I like to lock myself in toilets in train stations.... Porta potties.... Anywhere tight and enclosed when I AFK. There's absolutely no need to hog a vendor.
---
This is true. I will buy every fixer I see in a vendor.
---
Sell three of the Bulk Steel. There’s no reason to bull Steel anyways unless you’re going to sell it. That’s 4.5 lbs right there. 
---
Use [this resource](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/htmlview) to start your ‘un-hoarding’ process for your junk.
---
keeping both is a good idea because of the combat re-balancing coming soon, while both can make completely competent builds, it's difficult to say what is best for you due to the coming changes especially due to the challenges that daily ops will bring
---
was it wo0t (or something like that?)
---
Cheers. I've completely missed that, or just never received it.
---
I'll be sure to try and aquire it next time I log-in. Must say, this is likely a mental block brought on by me forever thinking, "...why isn't there one for armour repair...?", and just getting on with it...😄
---
So should I wait until patch 22?
---
While you can’t attempt to sell it here (forum rules), both of them have very solid traits. I assume they are both max level?
---
yes
---
I’ve managed to make one break in three shots.
---
Bethesda already know this. They're too lazy to do it.
---
There both max level 50 I honestly never thought I  could sell it because I never sold a weapon because I just don't know what to price it for.
---
Great job!!
---
The Glow isn't really all that bad, you can get in and out in like a minute and a bit of Rad-X makes you immune to any dangers.
---
There is another sub where you can get a price check. Do not get lowballed on either. 
---
DM sent.
---
Thanks for the resources help. :)
---
Use the fireworks glitch speeds up reload.
---
Just between Cranberry Glade and Dropsite C-2
---
If you see one near Flatwoods it won’t attack you but it will run away
---
It is annoying but I think its only fair, those weapons have a lot more DPS than 50cal or LMGs so they need the bad things to balance them .
---
Enclave stuff. The Senator bunker.
---
Both are pretty amazing. One of the most popular fixers is probably bloodied, fire rate, and less vats cost. The first one has 2/3 with a decent 3rd stat. The second one seems fun. With that much ammo and enough vats cost reduction, you could shoot so many bullets in vats without reloading.
---
And please make it tell jokes
---
I'll Google some subs to get an estimate.
---
Still changes none of what I've said. Also that's not going to be around for ever.
---
Winter fasnacht
---
I too agree
---
Do you have 3 arms?
---
FTWbob here. Play almost daily. Just send a message when adding or my dumbass won't notice.
---
We take in “babies” all the time and help, my wife really likes helping low levels.
---
Some areas of the map will have frame drops no matter what specs you have, like Whitespring. There are ways to tweak the ini to alleviate this issue; those how-to's are easily searchable. This game still suffers from a lack of polished game performance, so don't sell your GPU short.
---
Did you miss the part where OP said they don’t think the guy deserves any punitive action?
---
I have a quad fixer I’ve adapted for .38 ammo for trash mobs. Both those weapons are amazing keep them both
---
The Gauss Shotgun at 200% durability is the most durable weapon in the game. The Gauss Minigun has more durability than the Gauss Pistol. 
---
Please take half of the Gauss Shotguns durability and add it to the pistol. Problem solved.
---
You have earned your peace. Thats a good idea hiding level after like 100 or so.
---
Let’s be civil, please.
---
Yeah, it's nice the first few times you see it.
---
But it gets really annoying when you can't see shit and get shot at.
---
It's pretty fun 80 round in the default mag its basically an lmg.
---
We all get bored OP. You became a commie. I joined the scouts. Sometimes when we are cool-kid Responders or Enclave for ages, you feel the need to represent a minority faction for a while.
---
Once I'm a full blown possum scout I can't wait to level Earle then hammer s'mores while I collect my screws. Just a fucking Tadpole right now.
---
&gt;7: Mic etiquette, use it. It's bad bad bad form to eat, listen to music, have your dog barking (I could make a whole post about this alone) etc. Turn your mic off, have some perspective. Nobody wants to hear you yell at your kids, or your parents yell at you and so on. Squeakers are the worst at this, I hear a minors voice, it goes straight to mute.
---
Man this would be solved if we had a basic text chat in the damn game.
---
Glad you posted, I never found the key for this spot before n forgot about it. Quite an interesting bunker, kinda wish there was a bit more too it tho. Maybe just a couple named ghouls locked in those cells or something?
---
What about the speed demon mutation?
---
So make the game even more grindy? Hell no.
---
nuke zone at monaghaghanahnann both of them. other was just a 1*. 
---
i think the one at the airport is always there. It doesn't count as a legendary though as i killed one during the run for the kill 3 challenge and it didn't count. Thought it might have been a quick way to do it.
---
I want biv,  a drinking buddy
---
Guys, we need to have a talk about something. 
---
Consider the following, the ammo converter literally has a terminal taped on, compared to the ammo construction machine which has it’s terminal built in.
---
Using a terminal for the ammo converter is NOT ideal, but the developers clearly must have ran into some kind of technical issue that forced them to not use the vendor/trading menus. No matter how you feel about Fallout 76 the team behind it aren’t stupid, they are professional game developers and they know better then anyone the limitations if their game engine. All of  these pros are nice and I’m sure everyone on the team absolutely agrees with the points this post presents but unfortunately the hard part is actually making a menu like this work, it’s not just as simple as copying another menu, they would have to add new tags and data to each and every ammo type, which would cause more bloat and slow down ammo related loading everywhere. However the system currently in place must accomplish more of the developers goals and is much less prone to causing random issues in unrelated parts of the game. I just want to make it clear that it’s not as simple as it seems and there are so many hours in a day.
---
Assuming there's a button that makes your minigun spin, you only need one arm to hold the handle and a finger to hold down the button, which happens to belong to the same arm.
---
Did you miss the part where he said he hates people like this ?
---
So after a bit of research I found some legit Camden Park tickets and recreated them with the Mr. Fuzzy logo and correct dates. 100 of them will be shipping to me by next Saturday. I might have a slight impulse control issue.
---
went and spent 100 scrip at mumbles to see if i was super lucky. 
---
I wasn't.
---
I really do consider low levels like my kids, touch them and you dead
---
Probably not specifically dogmeat, cuz this does take place years earlier from fo4. Thats what I heard anyway
---
It never came to me to change the ammo type.
---
Nice, 100 though? Whatre you going to do with 100?
---
I am civil,  if you dont like my statement feel free to move on
---
Last two times I played this event some jack muffin cherry picked every single legendary.  I’m thinking about calling it quits on this event.
---
As a newb myself, just made level 18, I try not to badger people. The only emote I use is thumbs up or hello. To me the best part of the game is exploring and finding gear myself. That being said, I still thank those high levels that wave back and drop some food or stims. Yall are the true MVP.
---
And then we all went home and enjoyed a nice cup of mocah. The end
---
Crybabies
---
Holy Fusion Cores - this is gorgeous!
---
No, if you read it would make up for the already existing excess of recourses we get and allow us to spend them.
---
I have a shotgun turret by my vending machine and every now and again I'd hear it going off like a blender and I'd just be like, "oh, a merchant is at my house!"
---
That’s not the point either. You basically admitted that your plan was to server hop. It was absolutely no inconvenience to you personally. So you are going out of your way to try and play the bad fun card on this sub. To many people tilting at windmills in this sub just to rile up some upvotes.
---
I honestly wish one of this subs forum rules was no passive aggressive bullshit posts complaining about how other people play the game.
---
im not "complaining" about anything. if you want to buy the party line at every turn so to speak, thats your prerogative. god forbid you look at their actions and ideology beyond giving them the benefit of the doubt at every possible turn and making every excuses for them. bethesda really goes out of their way to try and get the player to examine them, but its seems people just want to go to the lowest common denominator. fuck nuance i guess.
---
any trade done with the NCR or any other wasteland faction would not include ANY sensitive or significant technology, the wastelanders would be looking to trade for the essentials, food, water, ammo. not beryllium agitators, reflex compacitors and haptic drives.
---
I feel you on this! Me and my friend got stalked through multiple servers over a few weeks (days for me, blocked them). Literally this kid (like 10 years old) was asking for full suits of power armor, free high end legos, aid items and ammo and plans. I told him multiple times to pound sand and buggar off. I ended up blocking him. My friend on the other hand was “trying to be nice” and next thing I know my buddy is hittin me up for screws, circuitry, aluminum, steel and and other stuff. I asked why do you need all this? He said he made that kid 3 different suits of power armor, modded out a few handmades for him and gave him 200 stims. I said nah man, that kids gotta learn how to play the game but now his mom is gonna be driving him to the mall til he’s 40 because instead of learning to drive he’s gonna expect everyone else to do it for him.
---
I’d tell everyone to keep track of when money comes outa ur account and if/when u get ur atoms. That’s something I feel like Beth would make top priority, but who knows. I feel like I get mine on a different day every month but I haven’t been keeping good track of it.
---
OP never said the person should be punished. Just that they hate the behavior. 
---
I dislike it when someone lists static spawn items for thousands of caps, or things like Purified Water for 50 caps. And so on. But that doesn’t mean I would want them to face any punitive action. 
---
There is a difference between disliking a behavior and believing the behavior should be punished.
---
The only good reward is the ws jumpsuit that has a rare spawm
---
something that somehow prevents people from taking the half a second it would take to press a single button?  It's not like you need to solve an algebraic equation to back out of a vendor.  It's literally one button.
---
If you don’t like the OP’s post, move on.
---
There are rules in this forum. Please follow them.
---
I’m in your boat on that one. It’s awkward but not as awkward as how I’ve been treated by randos because I’m a woman.
---
I just stopped at like 45 Gauss miniguns I got a 1* Junkies and decided that was good enough until the discount thing. I couldn’t imagine armor and having to get 5 good rolls.
---
Absolutely tremendous.
---
My mothman camp was out in the woods with no walls, no structures, just a windmill to power my vending machine as the only modern tech.
---
Tell lebron he is only one that cares
---
Ah
---
I only had the option of 50, 100 or more and the price difference between 50 and 100 was negligible. I might throw the rest up on Etsy or something. I still sell the left over you’re special books I made on there.
---
You’re right and that’s why I prefer to handle my gaming subscriptions manually, I have enough bills and money to keep track of. Usually it’s added instantly but not this time. I’ll see tomorrow as a few people have suggested and hopefully it’ll be deposited.
---
Haven't broke any arbitrary rules
---
Why buy, instead of doing the events? 
---
Meat week comes around again this year and ACP ist here to stay.
---
Ay, i might pick one up. Have a good day!
---
Dude yeah but it affects both weapons consistently so 2nd will always outpace the first in raw sustained dps because you just have fewer reloads fullstop. Making the reloads faster no matter how you do so doesn't change that. 
---
It doesn't matter for most evemies because they die well before you need to reload. For bosses with massive health totals, it will matter. Hence my original comment.
---
Dogmeat is the name of multiple different dogs across numerous Fallouts, not just 4. I do like the theory of him being a synth though, which means many of them could really be the same dog.
---
Thank you very much
---
I made a general statement,  you directly responded to me
---
Remain civil. That’s one of the rules.
---
Pretty sure this has already been done. There are definitely a lot of posts with people posting the results of hundreds of treasure map findings, at least.
---
I would be happy if my team’s custom markers would show up in a different color for me.
---
And then...?
---
I said it before, we need Automatron, the assets are basically ingame already
---
Bonus tip: Calmex, for an additional 15% sneak damage.
---
Responding to you isn’t a violation of the rules.
---
And it wasn’t a general statement. You responded to the OP’s post.  Including the use of words like ‘you’. 
---
That makes it a direct statement, not a general one.
---
Its always the people looking for upvotes , j7st because you have high karma doesn't mean you're  opinion counts more than mine
---
Thanks for clearing that up I don't really think about it like that.
---
focus on specials when the cards you want are not available
---
So he can run off as I sneak and set off traps and attract attention?
---
Never said it was , show me  where I said that
---
You can find a good pupper on the ridge across the river east of harpers ferry. Can’t tame it but you can build your camp by him and pretend.
---
Your welcome to your opinion. But calling someone a ‘p***y’ isn’t civil by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Yah I figured
---
I have no reason to change mine at this point
---
But it will be though. Yeah you lift caps bit you now need to work harder for the same things.
---
The current caps suck for all players but your idea, while might be OK for someone that wants to play 8 hour sessions several days a week sucks for the casual wanting to bash out a couple of hours per week.
---
You're telling me that I can:
---
Smelt my own raw uranium ore...
---
Build a laser rifle...
---
Scrap a Giddy-Up Buttercup and some circuit cards to build a fusion reactor...
---
But I can't strip down some bullets and smelt the casings and bullets?
---
Assumptions abound: 1,that i was upset or “gotten to“ (maybe others are that mentally weak.. Idk) 2, that the post took a lot of effort (you must be a slow typer) 3, that no newbs will read it (more than a few newbs have commented) and 4,that itll have no effect (who knows? maybe, maybe not.. But its worth a shot.) but hey, thanks for your contribution. Im glad it was stimulating enough for you to read!
---
The class freak perk card shows me with 3 arms...
---
I'm really surprised I've never seen someone with a camp there in all my time playing. I've considered it, but I'm just so attached to my current location...
---
Show me where I said that *you said* that responding to you is a rules violation.
---
Apart from the guy who opened 300 maps in total, I'm not really seeing any data around about all of what comes out of them, and rough drop rates. Could you link me some other posts you've seen?
---
I'm sitting on a couple thousand maps in total counting the ones I've already used so I'm looking to get the entire drop list.
---
that would also be usefull
---
The mocha had a pigeon ear in it and so Nescafé was sued
---
I long for robot companions like the Automatron dlc.
---
Who is Lebron?
---
The Gauss Shotgun is not much better. When it works it is devastating, but most other times it's a pop gun.
---
Nescafé launched a counter lawsuit, and now own ⅜ of the world's water
---
Honestly watching him out me off from trying this game out each time I wanted to give it a go.  Always some big ass scandal, when it turns out everything was severely out of proportion.   
---
I still watched some other videos (NoRespawns is fantastic for building) and that got me into trying the game out.
---
Had I just watched JH I never would have given this game a shot since it was just an echo of all.yhe problems i feared it would have,  and what was said at launch.  
---
Don't recommend anyone taking his "information" seriously.  Yes game is flawed but not to the level he paints it to be.
---
I got a double barreled three star shotty that works really with VATS that seems to do quite a number on his heads.
---
I'd love something subtle like they just explode (Bloody Mess style) but also let off the lunch box noise then confetti and streamers spew out as the chunks fly.
---
Bloodied and junkies still going to be best.. Everything is just doing less damage
---
Wait, there is something wrong, as an enclave member, why are you acknowledging our good actions
---
I share glow sights, sturdy frame, grim reapers sprint. That way it doesn’t affect anyone that may already have those equipped, and they won’t be mad I’m not sharing something else. They’ll be happy if it’s something they’re not using. None of them negatively affect anyone’s build. If I hop on a team with someone sharing photosynthetic or sun kissed or anything that’s going make my rads go away, I leave the team and join a different one or start my own. If they join a team that I started, I kick them from the team. If they rejoin, I kick them again. I’m not gonna message them unless they message me first. Not my place to tell anyone how to play their game, but if your shared cards negatively affect my playtime then we’re not on the same team.
---
Always someone with high karma thinking their opinions count more then others
---
Honestly if you ask people will just give you them.
---
It's not a problem mate. I found it all quite funny. The reason I am cash rich is down to your advice.
---
I just saw the initial notification come up, and thought I know that name....then it endlessly pinged again.
---
The shop is fully stocked again...it just gets relentlessly shopped at and I am tired of buying serum recipes, it takes forever to even make your money back.
---
This whole covid thing is getting us all down, and I live alone, and sometimes I need to rant. Probably better I did it at you than well to anyone I actually know 😃 thankfully I have a holiday in Cornwall next week to relax
---
Ps I was hoping you had a forest outfit for sale. Keep up the good work.
---
Wish granted. You can only acquire 1 treasury note a day now.
---
all damage calculations are being changed from multiplication to addition, so everything is getting smooshed
---
The band Thirty Second to Mars came back with the water of Mars, and the world was all right once again
---
They also decided to ruin some of those rare flat pieces of land with Wastelanders by adding tents that can't be removed. There's a perfectly flat cliff with a gorgeous view near Site Bravo that was extremely popular until Wastelanders put a tent with a bunch of skeletons right in the center of it. There's also a flat, open area in the woods just a little bit north of the Red Rocket Megastop that I built at for a while in early 2019 before moving to my current spot, and just a couple days ago I decided to check it out again; sure enough, there's a camp site on it now with two random NPC spawns. Nowadays there's a flat spot in the Ash Heap that I've seen a lot of people building on lately, and I won't be surprised if and when Bethesda decides it's the perfect spot for yet another NPC camp.
---
Well All Bright Sun, at least we agree on this.  I am as far away from being a Trump zombie as far as I can get.
---
Level 107 here. Can confirm it feels great.
---
I never claimed a rule violation,  i said mind your own business
---
I don’t care about karma. That has nothing to do with this. It’s about being civil and respectful.
---
Ok 🤣
---
Never said you couldn't ask someone to stop using a card, thats fine but trying to tell people what cards not to use because it messes with your build is not fine, where does it stop, telling what weapons or gear to use, public teams are always gonna be random, if you want someone to use specific cards then start a private team, you nor I or anyone else can dictate what another player uses.
---
Hey you’ll never know if your surgeon was a D student
---
Not really, it's just a leech.
---
No, I don’t think I will. 
---
This is a public discussion forum. The moment you posted something, it became open for public discussion.
---
If that bothers you, then make different choices. I’d you can’t follow the rules of this subreddit, find one more suited to you.
---
Had a level 17 ask me to help him join the enclave and level up. Decided okay whatever, sure. Maybe he can't kill the deathclaws in the cave. Went to help him level after, and suddenly he's asking me for every type of ammo in the game. I crafted him a full set of marine armor and a fixer, than dropped him 2k .45 ammo. I use .45 so I didn't wanna give him everything and felt I was being generous. Next day he asks if I have any more .45. like what the hell happened to the 2k I gave you yesterday? He asked if I had 10mm so I bought 6k for him (needed a cap sink) and said that'll be more than enough, hoping he got that I don't want to give him all my ammo. Then he asks if I have any cells, shells, and .45. dude. I've given you all my spare ammo. What the hell are you doing with it.
---
Now he wants me to help him launch a nuke, at level 25. I don't think that's gonna happen
---
&gt; Im glad it was stimulating enough for you to read!
---
Now you're the one making assumptions.
---
Report me then
---
Yeah! kids, pizza delivery, tornado, the possibilities are endless.
---
Don’t undersell. People WILL buy it if it’s good no matter what lol I’ve been shocked so many times
---
Well you read it didnt ya?
---
In my experience the most generous actions are performed when you don’t go looking for them. I was vendor hopping on PC last year and found a few people whose camps were near top of the world. They were having a big blowout giveaway, telling everyone in the area to come on over and get some loot. I ended up snagging a bloodied swing speed strength deathclaw gauntlet, an action hero, and an instigating explosive fixer. It’s truly amazing how generous people can be sometimes.
---
because technically you don‘t even know about us yet. :b
---
Any items I'm currently carrying aren't up for trade. I carry what I use, why would I trade you one of my main guns?
---
If it happens again, I definitely will!
---
But that would stop them from eventually adding the jacket/suit combo to the atom shop.
---
C’mon man, dont paint yourself in a corner here
---
Mission objective is on screen during the entire events. Same with radiation rumble. I cant understand why people dont read the simple objectives?
---
If they'd change that it would be a great event
---
I’m not changing my build but I am collecting equipment so I can change builds for daily ops. So... bloodied or berserker most of the time (depending on toon) but more tanky full health for daily ops.
---
As you wish.  I notice you are unable to deny the truth of my statements.
---
Bonus bonus tip: ballistic bok for 15% additional damage.
---
Good luck
---
And of course, the players get to be the judge of when it is and isn't deserved, right? That kind of justice system has never failed us before
---
Can confirm. I'm an owner of a B2525 fixer and it *shreeeeeds*.
---
Thank you. You’ve certainly provided sufficient commentary to justify it.
---
Honestly looks more intimidating than when they are in their edgy outfits.
---
git gud noob
---
It was ok before player vending, once that feature came out you’d barely get any customers being so far out of the way. But building in the area is pretty limited due to space.
---
Then stop harassing me and do it
---
It's one of those weapons you can use and switch your brain off
---
THE END
---
Yeah, it's a pain in the scrap.
---
Well, they indeed are going to make it work. We'll all be getting instanced Fallout Shelters in the near future. That will bring a much a much greater building area for each and every current CAMP in addition to the non-instanced space. And if the can do that for mobile CAMPs, they can certainly do that for Workshops.
---
Honestly these posts are so frequent it’s an easy way to get karma
---
Joining in time for one wasteland. Good luck.
---
Replying on a public post is not harassment. 
---
You are perfectly capable of ending the conversation of you choose to do so.
---
Ok bubye
---
Seems like it. Punda isn't responding
---
Good bye.
---
👍🏾
---
I'm looking forward to seeing if my potato build is still garbage.
---
I think you already said that.
---
dancing
---
The only thing I would want is dog food. Piece of advice don't sell ammo at a super high price. I'm not going to pay 250 caps per 2mm cartridge
---
Oh man I’ve been trying for a bloodied fixer for so long, don’t get rid
---
You repeatedly trying to goad me into breaking the rules isn't going to work
---
Isn't oxhorn that creepy dude that talks about being a gentleman, films high school girls without their consent and hates LGBT groups?
---
He's a weirdo who also gets his lore wrong all the time.
---
They don't update it on the weekends either. Plus it's a holiday weekend in the US so it probably won't update tomorrow either, and if it does, it will just say complete.
---
the other person may not be mutated
---
I couldn't give a wet shit about internet fame points, I just want to play fallout without wanting to cry.
---
I started as a junkie build and I will die a junkie build.
---
No one had tents and everyone was on the ground.
---
Strange in numbers is increasing your carry weight from marsupial and strength from herd mentality. I'd avoid joining any group without a 100+ player if you want the bonus from strange in numbers, even then you get masochists who don't even have marsupial.
---
New mutation that gives you third arm
---
Positive: can use stims while actively shooting a gun
---
Negative: Negative Agility (has to be harder to balance with a random extra limb)
---
Solid little hidey hole!
---
Yes. I press q and hold down lmb. I occasionally take my finger off then but it back on to fix vats missing a bit.
---
Imagine the bugs! This will get crazy.
---
I see, misunderstood your comments.
---
I’m not goading you into breaking the rules. I originally replied to you when you had already broken the rules. 
---
If you’re concerned about inadvertently breaking the rules for a fourth time, then the best thing to do is simply not reply.
---
Literally no need for you to be an ass. Not everyone has the luxury of god rolls or hacked guns to insta kill her. 🤦🤦🤦
---
Just place the wood wall flame it then place whatever there and repair the wall. I sink all my vendors and collectron into walls.
---
I know but in both the 361 and 366 cases I have herd and marsupial so why isn’t it always 366 as long as one person has a mutation.
---
You xbox or ps4?
---
This works both ways though - I’m a lowly lvl40 and got asked to trade by a lvl170+ (my first ever trade outside my team). They asked for an addictol. I only had 2 but gave them one of them for a nominal amount. They then asked for antibiotics, so I gave them one. On the third request I ran away.
---
&gt; Why buy, instead of doing the events?
---
For the same reason the Fixer plan sells so well. Because some people (myself included) would rather buy something instead of grinding and hoping a slot machine eventually spits out what you want.
---
Xbox or ps4?
---
Those structures should have thicker foundations.
---
How about you leave me alone,  you are making me uncomfortable
---
Too much tweaking will spoil it for everyone. Just leave things alone.
---
The one you enjoy now will still most likely be the one you enjoy then. No one build is being singled out; the modifications affect all build types. 
---
Those that rely on more individual damage modifiers will see greater impact. But they will still do more damage, comparatively speaking.
---
The same build set up as before the patch.
---
That sounds like an extra point of strength from radicool, +1 gear or unyielding.
---
That could be, I've noticed that if you just place down an ally object, or move camps, they don't remember you until next load. This seems different though, tried private world... on a team, not on a team, several different sessions. Still she does not remember all the stuff that went down.
---
Either you are losing strength from your special when you hop in, or your armor pieces have some weight reduction perks.  Legendary Armor perks disappear when you hop in PA.
---
Or both.  Check your special in and out of PA and check your legendary stats and mods.
---
I heard something chewing on my base. A radrat had spawned inside my collectron station and destroyed it from the inside. I've had molerats spawn inside flooring at workshops. And you can't alter a workshop while it's being attacked.. had to get real creative to kill it.
---
I'm sorry for my lack of understanding but do legendary schored offer better drops compared to other legendaries?
---
Regardless, congrats on the three star encounter!!!!!
---
I only recently learned the fixer plan those were 2 out of 3 fixers I ever got my first fixer was an assassin with two other effects I didn't remember I gave it away to a low level.
---
If you’re uncomfortable in a public discussion forum, there’s a very easy solution to that. 
---
Feel free to walk away.
---
Man.  With inviting public service announcements like this I can see why folk are just DYING to get into this GAME
---
I’ll take both please 🙂🙃🙂
---
They will nerf all builds, nothing more will change
---
Or backpack.
---
Feel free to grow up and admit you are wrong
---
&gt;Had some runts try demanding that because I had Fallout 1st, and according to their "logic" therefore had access to unlimited scrap
---
Welcome to socialism.
---
That pic is WAY better than any regular ol' pic! This is awesome!
---
Have you had a quest npc forget stuff?
---
Thanks for the answer. Maybe they shared a radicool. I wear PA 99% of the time so I can eliminate that as a variable.
---
Literally this.  Not brave, just about as brave as the person who copies answers off of someone else's test.
---
I use a pen and paper. Old school. To write where something is that I want to remember since we only have one marker. 
---
Not to mention. I would not want 8-12 markers on the map when I join a team.
---
This is how I view the Pack in Nuka-World
---
Except AA, V, etc.  Anything that doesn't change damage.
---
So true. 
---
This game will probably always have its flaws. But if you really love it enough (like I personally do) you’ll ignore it, easily.
---
It becomes pay to win so not a good idea
---
Libraries banned books
---
That too, good catch.
---
I’m not wrong. 
---
You used a vulgar and misogynistic term in an insulting and uncivil manner.
---
Remaining civil is a rule within this sub. 
---
Nothing I have done or said to you was wrong or uncivil. The fact that you are uncomfortable that someone is addressing your boorish behavior doesn’t make addressing that issue wrong or uncivil.
---
Some kid who used to end up in our group every once in a while wanted me to fix up their camp. 
---
"Sure," I figure. "Why not?" 
---
Well I go through giving them a really nice set up and then send them a screenshot for the code to the keypad door they had me install, and when it came time to scrap some stuff they changed their mind on, they ran ahead of me to scrap the stuff themselves, even though I'm the one who built nearly everything at the camp and the scrap should go back to me. 
---
When I called them out on it, they proceeded to inform me that since the screenshot I sent them also happened to show how much scrap I had available to me, they should get the scrap from the stuff they decided they no longer wanted in their camp because I "had plenty." 
---
Once they told me that, I told them they can build the rest of their camp themselves. 
---
It took me a while to accumulate the amount of scrap I had, scrap I was saving up so I could help out other low levels as well besides just that kid. Plus the scrap they were grabbing from stuff they no longer wanted was scrap that's hard to come by to begin with. Had they asked nicely, I would have gladly let them scrap the stuff themselves. There's not much I'm not willing to do for you so long as you're respectful, but the moment you decide for me what all I am willing to do for you is the moment I'm no longer willing to do anything for you at all.
---
I honestly tried my best not to come off too negative, seriously. I have just seen a lot of newbs get blocked over these faux pas and I thought maybe it would help. You may say im a dreamer, but im not the only one.
---
Bashing interrupts the animation and you can stim or change your weapon
---
Berserkers shall rise from the ash head and reign supreme over ALL!
---
This is ur fix. I keep getting stuck in the cooking potistion when I’m at ppls survival tents and they move them while I’m cooking. I can move around just stirring nothing but can’t do anything else lol Then I just hit the weapon swap and it’s fixed.
---
Stop running I have a piece of metal for you to wear!
---
This has been a problem since Wastelanders. 
---
It'd all be fine if these people just let things play out as they would on their own. It's the impatience and entitled attitude that ruins it.
---
As soon as I see it happen, insta block and ignore them. No putting them down, no negative emotes, give them no fuel to come crying later on about how this great community is shit.
---
I have had people think I’m a kid when I speak on mic for some reason which I don’t understand just coz I’m a woman does that make me sound like a kid. How many guys wont stay in a party with me if it’s just us coz I’m a woman, I really don’t get it
---
No change isnt bad, its just that changing so much at once can open up a ton of problems like it has in the past. They need to babystep these changes in.
---
Backpack. Pockets. Armor or under armor that has strength bonuses.
---
None of those work while in Power Armor.
---
This is confusing as it you go from 285 to 315
---
Bloodied &gt; junkie = AA
---
SQB has without fail, always given me a respawn glitch. I have lost soo much loot to that. ACP is completely fine for me. You nuke SBQ, expect a raider surprise in your camp
---
Where at??
---
You can tame a dog to keep at ur camp as a very rare chance random encounter, but your dog also has to get back from that encounter to your CAMP safely on foot, which is very difficult for critters that die in 1 hit to any enemy on the road back
---
Seems my luck is spent getting them instead of good legendaries. I've managed 3 of them. There's 2 bits of junk that goes well with them. The Bird Decoration and the Clean Coffee tin. The Coffee tin sits with the kids side eye looking at the pie if placed to the right of the can.
---
But it really needs to be able to identify strangers when they go inside and chase them around d telling them not to track mud or blood on the carpet or floors.
---
When someone joins our/my team right before or during a event with incoming radiation, tough luck for that player. Sounds a bit harsh, but we decided to run with that setup, you will have to adapt or leave.   
---
For the next fight your input is welcome. Majority will decide and each player can act accordingly; either stay or find a (better) team.
---
Now when I join your team, Rad Sponge will not be equipped to start with. I totally agree that it is common sense you don't join blindly with something like Rad Sponge active.
---
Why would someone do something like this? They cant even handle one wendigo spawn let alone 20 and the colossus.
---
And a leg Ripper
---
this is true. My load times aren't that bad but seeing them on console and hdds make me sad

Libraries banned libraries

I think the internet companies are cursed... I have rural internet too and they have no intention of helping us upgrade anytime soon

Dogmeats a time traveller smh.

you usually only see them in events. Even then i think it's only a horde event you see one. 
---
So to see one outside an event is a rare thing. And to see two in two days. SUPER RARE!
---
Libraries banned banning

im thinking only for solo thats the thing
---
I mean, you're both right.
---
First time I died to another player was from a Fatman from behind. I became wanted by inspecting a locked resource collector. Took off all my armor, put on a suit and hat, and went for a casual stroll in Flatwoods. Soon thereafter, I heard the tell-tale whistle of a mini-nuke flying toward me and then blamo, I died and ragdolled the heck outta there. Would not recommend.
---
Ok, twice now I have asked you to leave me alone . If you believe I have broken the rules report me and move on
---
Yeah some NPCs act as if nothing has happened for the past year (in game time) and as if we didn’t rob the vault and do all those quests together.
---
How bout doing a review of the unsung hero of the wasteland.
---
The rusty trusty BE Pipe revolver.
---
The trade thing is annoying as hell. I had a level 19 inv me to trade repeatedly, just to request my lvl 50 bloodied fixer. I would also add that it's greedy to completely harvest everything at another players camp.
---
I believe that’s called your stash box. You can even access it at every “ branch’” throughout the waste land.
---
Because they think they can.
---
Just kill a mongrel.

No, Dreamer.  I definitely believe you're not the only one who thinks like this.
---
Downvoting this has caused me to be post limited on this board, can only post every 10 minutes.  So now I can't even defend my position.  While coincidental, this completely lends to my observation of an extremely self enclosed community, unwelcoming of new players or outsiders.  Cheers.
---
Libraries banned ban banning and Nescafé sued itself
---
Even I (poor bloodied me) die once or twice during the event and I'm over level 100.
---
I may get downvoted for this, but I understand the limit. If there wasn't a limit then people would just keep rerolling and scripping until they've either run out, or got a good weapon. It would be a lot easier/quicker to get a god tire roll if you could just go back and scrip what you didn't like and then reroll. However only being able to scrip 3 3* weapons isn't great, but so far I haven't been having much problems with weight management. I've got a lot of weapons in my vendors, and then I carry 3 on me that I switch between. If I come across a weapon I "may" want to use if I decide to switch builds one day, then maybe I'll try to find a way to keep it in my stash or I'll actually make a second character to play as that build type/or act as a mule. However, I've still usually got between 100-200 pounds of free space in my stash for days I decide to really go all out
---
Lol too bad
---
Haha zap zap zap
---
THAT is a good idea. I've used one for 5 minutes and it's actually quite good, no joke
---
That would be awesome. I finally have all 8 and want to build a gamer cafe hah
---
Yeah I don’t think that would be a bad thing either.   I don’t like the time gate but I know when would never completely remove it.   I think double the limit now would be something they would consider.
---
Someone just messing around probably. Like the people who list TP for 1000s of caps.
---
It’s like these Gamepass, Fortnite playing Zoomers have never payed an MMO am I right?
---
Still can’t believe I read this though
---
Preach
---
You get them the exact moment that it renews. Basically it waits until your previously paid for month is completely over before starting the new one and it gives your atoms soon as the new month starts.
---
It is ironic that you claim to be uncomfortable. You didn’t seem to have any concerns about potentially making someone else uncomfortable with your vulgarity and misogyny. 
---
Your replies are ‘making *me* uncomfortable’.  If you don’t want me to make you uncomfortable, then don’t ‘make *me* uncomfortable’.
---
A tip that works for me, when I’m low on health and I know I’m about to die, I just open up my pip boy and spam X. 
---
As long as you’re on your “Stats” when you go on your pip boy, you can press X for stimpack, or square for radaway (ps4)
---
Regardless of having your minigun spinning or you taking melee damage, etc. 
---
This way you can take as many stimpacks or radaway without having to do the animation. 
---
I realize you’re thinking to yourself, but pressing down on the d-pad is so much easier, or using it from my favorite wheel. 
---
But to me, it’s super quick and easy to tap circle, and spam x. 
---
That’s what I use whenever I play around with a heavy build.
---
Quick question: what's the commonly accepted emote combo for "thank you" (since there isn't one, weirdly enough)? I've been using "yes" plus "love" but if that doesn't get the point across, what does? Thanks!
---
Grind-gating is one thing, but (essentially) time-gating items is just terrible to me.
---
Nice
---
For events like ACP I use a medic pump torso mod to automatically administer stimpaks without a cooldiwn. There are still times where the incoming damage and/or DOTs outpace the healing but I like using it with my Junkie's heavy weapons build.
---
Yeah lol I was joking
---
Know what i mean
---
Playstation
---
I guess. It seemed odd that it was so uniform - three in each machine, and all priced at 30k. I can't see any useful reason for doing it, so I reckon you're likely right.
---
Thank you for the info. Hopefully it’ll kick in tomorrow when my subscription ends. Will wait and see
---
literally what new players lmao this game is dying
---
Meatloaf did *that*
---
I need a hand in collecting all the crops, scrap and ammo!
---
PC player here but in general fallout 76 is definitely worth it. And joining the game in time for one wasteland is good.
---
I wonder if they will do what Witcher 3 is doing and make an update to enable ray tracing.
---
Just let us break down ammo for materials through the scrap menu or add that functionality to the tinkerer’s workbench at least. There’s no need for another workbench for ammo and certainly no need for yet another form of currency (ammo points, this time).
---
Usually if you see anything priced that high, it’s to display the item or to ‘lock’ it so that it’s not used up in crafting or repairing. 
---
Weird that they had Bobby Pins listed, though.
---
I would love to visit
---
gah... lame.  I just made a new character who started wastlander's quests. Wonder if that could have been the cause.
---
I havent seen her do that in a while. Its annoying cus she did give really good tips and strats. The news stuff I really dont care for since, ya know, im here on reddit.
---
Im sorry to hear that buddy, i always welcome healthy discourse. I too have been downvoted for speaking an unpopular opinion before so, i know how it feels. But thats reddit for you, i guess.
---
Pack an umbrella for infinite shade
---
Fusion generator plan can be one from the powering up events or bought from a vendor in the whitesprings for ~300 caps.
---
yeah, as someone who pre-ordered and was ultimately disappointed and stopped playing for a year, shit like this isnt really that encouraging trying to get back in. im sticking around for the time being, but im also hoping things get better.
---
Luckily I play on the pc because we dont have a messaging feature.
---
You're need to have the last word is laughable 🤣 , I have all the time in the world
---
23 female here. Avid player with the voice of a 9 year old boy when I’m on a mic. Probably why I don’t talk much
---
The upthumb and heart is actually what i would think is the socially accepted thank you. Imo
---
I whole heartedly agree, I helped this low level player who shows up at my camp one day, just gave em all my know plans I’d been hoarding for exactly that purpose and some ammo, leave to go run a mission comes back and he’s there but now he has two new friends that have joined him expecting that same, no worries did what I could, but then they because annoying because they refused to leave my camp for about two hours every time I would return they would be asking me to make them something else, they literally reaped all my crops and took all my purified water, I was like man enough and hopped servers on em even then they kept messaging me!!
---
Honestly I don’t think that it the cause. You see I’ve been playing for a good couple of months and so I only have one character, ( a few others but mainly as mules) and I’ve had this happen to me where the NPCs are stuck in their original dialogue. Hopefully it’ll get fixed but honestly Bethesda has allot more issues on their plate.
---
What level should you grind to before you should take part in the Scorchbeast queen and Earle fights so that you aren't a deadweight?
---
I wanna power it up so I can ride the rollercoaster and fly off of it and die because none of us are good engineers
---
Was at my camp before and some level 30s showed up to see my vendors , my legendary weapons were decent some furious , some anti armor , they were priced at 2000-5000 depending on the gun and they had to nerve to try and bargain the price and offered me low amounts of scrap for my stuff , they started offering me non legendary stuff which obviously I said no , I turned around to stash some stuff and they shoot at me.....which I promptly turn around and melt them into the ground why do they feel the nerve to do stupid stuff when things don't go their way??
---
It’s a common way that [redacted] agent controllers use to send messages to their agents in the field. There’s always a risk that sendiomg messages in code through vendor machines can go wrong if the items are purchased whixh is why they are set so high
---
Collected everything...EVERYTHING: glass bottle, burnt books, human bones and sell them to vendors at the train stations
---
High demand plans will get you there quick. Backpack plans, fixer plans, etc. can fetch a good price and they barely take up weight. That’s my go to. I found a Meat Tenderizer plan in a players vending for 400 caps, those can fetch max caps. And presents. Lots n lots of presents 🎁
---
Bad idea
---
Nocturnal isn't unusable and is actually okay as is. The armor effect could do with changing to effect stats other than dr but the weapons hit as hard as junkies for half the day with no other drawbacks.
---
It’s how we move money between friends. Also a way to rip off trades. “Buy my bobby pin and I’ll drop the legacy” Once they buy it offending party server hops. ALWAYS Use a mule!
---
I already got the last word multiple times with you. That’s not what this is about. 
---
I’m pointing out your hypocrisy. You want people to ‘treat you nicely’, but you had no problem acting poorly.
---
In the words of Willard Carroll Smith Jr., *”Don’t start none, won’t be none.”*
---
Jeez. I’m level fifty and this six year old was literally screaming at me because I refused to give him legendaries. Most my weapons are legends but I use each of them. I don’t carry around spares. My base is right next to the miner place too. I did give him some stuff at the beginning though, I believe it was some plans and ammo. I also gave him like three stims. But as soon as he started demanding is the moment I should have left the party. The whole thing turned into him trying to bang my girlfriend in his Lamborghini. Jesus Christ kids like that should not have a headset.
---
I've been kind of searching for weapon plans and mods. Im a bloody/junkie melee build. I have one mod for Sheepsquatch Staff but wanted to find more.
---
ESO dropped the amount of multiplicative stats and became 'addition' based about a year ago and claimed it'd reduce all these running calculations easing the strain on the system. 
---
The people running it were also morons and were the worst abusers of the nerf hammer. Time will tell if it doesn't improve speed a bit.
---
I’m still having the problem ,this should be an easy fix.
---
Not a newbie, but I do sometimes friend people with particularly good shop stock and variety, so that I can visit later when I have more caps to burn or variety changes.
---
I want One Wasteland.
---
But I think they should have started by balancing some of the weapons that are performing a little poorly. Mainly shotguns and pistols. That way no one will be missing the lower level areas, because all of the weapons will be performing nicely!
---
They did a bit of a balance pass, which was a good start, but they didn't follow through at all. I don't think one wasteland is ready and I think they'll regret releasing it without balancing the weapons more.
---
As long as you can wear powerarmor or something to defend yourself so you arent dying every 30seconds is fine w me, IMO. Id think the general consensus would be that you at least worked yourself up enuf to trigger event yourself (SBQ event) or hold your own against level 75 wendigos (collosus)
---
Does everyone forget how useless people like the overseer and the vault raid allies were for us stealth builds? Christ they were like bumbling children.
---
Agreed!
---
On PC if you're
---
depends on other stars
---
Great for ACP too
---
Seriously, any gun you carry on your person thats worth trading isn't gonna be for sale. If I wanted to sell it, I'd put it in my vendor. You could offer 20,000 caps and it wouldn't matter, caps can't beat the perfect gun for your build.
---
Ok
---
smizzacked_
---
Dang, I'm on ps4
---
No. Do you know how it took to memorize the order? Now whenever I know what I’m going to build, like a wall or a generator or floor decor, I know exactly where to scroll to without even thinking about it. Changing it now would be 10x worse for the old players then just keeping it how it is for the new players.
---
Same.
---
Off topic, but the first time I heard The woman screaming at the cabin I shit myself ahah
---
Limb damage and 15% more critical meter filling
---
You don’t have to randomly join servers until you see the same people. Just join them directly from the social menu. 
---
The safest way is with a actual trusted friend. There are also courier services. And access to your own private world can make it more reliable.
---
Maybe they were pissed they didn't get to loot.
---
I shouldn't have called you a liar.
---
Please accept my apologies.
---
Next time you do the event.When you kill him stay behind and let the timer time out,loot all the Wendigos.I guarantee you will be spawned at the Mine entrance and complete all the event and get your Flux.I only found out by accident.
---
Fallout 1st. The private server keeps you tagged long enough so you can exit main menu, change toon an re-enter. That's how I transfer items. You need to know that 1 out of 10 times it can fail, the server being taken down or the game crashing.
---
The McDonald's advert person didn't love *it*
---
2nd account to mule or a trusted courier from particular subreddit that isn't allowed to be mentioned here due to past dramas. But it has something to do with 76 and the Market.
---
Aw sucks man
---
Seriously, that's so needy. If someone is crafting something and need one or two of a component to finish something, i get it, I've been there. Got an addiction and I've got some spare radscorpion omelets? Sure, I don't mind. But asking for a laundry list of supplies that clearly aren't meeting an immediate need is just silly.
---
Not really. We’ll get daily ops which will have enemies drop the ammo your using (except fusion and plasma cores, missiles, some others I don’t remember, and ((((possibly)))) 2mm emc’s). But as a Heavy gunner how uses a Gatling laser, it shouldn’t be too much of a problem.
---
Just had a quick look, I don't have anything, not sure the best way to obtain them. Probably making the weapon and then scrapping, Google will probably give you some tips.
---
Pathetic,  you started this.  Your ability to quote obscure lines doesnt help . 🤣 . Again i will say , cry to lebron maybe he will care  .🤣
---
Aha, I take it that's some form of invite to come and help you with something?
---
Is this the cave in the top right of the map??
---
I've been playing since Beta, I'd still like the option to change the order.
---
I didn’t start this. You did. My first reply to you was simply to suggest you remain civil. 
---
And it’s not an obscure line. Quite a few people have seen *Men In Black*. 
---
And once again, who is ‘Lebron’?
---
Flatwoodmonster in The Forrest + Toxic V. and Ash H. are mostly LvL 35 ,   
---
so u have to "Oneshot" them ore it leave the place.  
---
In the Mire and Cranberry B. they should be LvL 50 - so it starts fighting u if they detect U!   
---
\*Nive Pic by the way!
---
I believe MODUS is insignificant to anything Enclave and is a mere tool that will be reset upon the first interaction with the living members of the genuine Enclave, that are actually are alive.
---
But then what would happen if you join a team? You loose all the markers? Or you would pick one? 
---
Seems easier to just use pen and paper
---
I get it when I’m logging back in after the respawn glitch and I’m always confused as I don’t take workshops anymore (unless on my private to farm)
---
That's when I start pulling out the not so subtle hint commonly worded as "well according to Google..." Although that didn't work for one kid I ran into recently. Eventually I had to be blunt and tell him he's better off checking Google than constantly asking me where to get stuff and how to do things.
---
I appreciate it. Sadly the scrapping aspect doesn't work. Apparently you have to do Free Range and hope within a 25% chance that one drops. But I'm just a plan hoarder in general. I love decking out any and all weapons. Right now my primary weapons are a Bloody Sledge and a Bloody Pole Hook.
---
IT became I.T, and now It works for Bing
---
definitely not scrip. Could be looking at 5k ish
---
Yes it’s crazy how many gun or pieces of armor I’ve just dropped because I can’t sell them and I’m always at my cap for scrip
---
Or maybe... my own gun?
---
They should just put a 10 minute count down timer once the event is started. This would be good on the harder events like Project Paradise and Radiation Rumble too. They also should require cards so you can assemble teams.
---
I put an item like that in each vendor for 2 reasons. As a courtesy to other players. 
---
1) If every item sells out of the vendors, except the "bobby pin" my camp will still appear on the map. Someone may still want to pop by to rest, craft, access stash etc. The supplies will show jack shit available but at least it's a location. Don't fast travel there expecting to shop.
---
2) Have you ever went to look in a vendor and there's a long lag before anything appears? And you wait wait and it finally shows the items? If the vendor is completely empty, you'll be sitting there waiting waiting waiting for the lag to finish and items to pop up. But guess what, it never happens because there's nothing there. That one bobby pin will pop up to quickly show the vendor is empty.
---
It would be awesome if they imported all of Automatron in.
---
Rip, probably wouldn't survive the trip to the Mire. If a player murders them, will they respawn in the camp or not?
---
Asking for a friend.
---
if u on PC : press "R"  to start the Reload, u can instant stim u if u done it.   
---
Not an perfect workaround but it offten Save my A'\*$ ;-)
---
I ll have to try that it’s going to be real hard saving that stuff lol
---
the main custom destination would be the only one that the team could see
---
I just spam add people as friend hoping they accept, then I use the ones that accept as an anchor. I haven't lost any items so far, just make sure you have atleast 2 people on the same server if it's valuable stuff. (so if one leaves right as you are swapping characters you have a backup)
---
Absolute safest way would be 2 different accounts though.
---
Try it out see what you think
---
Don’t need help , always looking for a party friend though.
---
Don’t use Tesla’s at ACP, it wrecks the event for everyone due to a lag/visual glitch.
---
Tell that to r/fo76.  "How do I get this, how do I get that?"  Google it.
---
Men in black 🤣 , if you are going to use quotes choose one that is relevant
---
Really? Did people figure out how to make the magic weapons work vs. him? When I tried mine it did normal damage.
---
Simple, Double Barrel Shotgun
---
I would recommend a vats build with an auto rifle or auto pistol
---
Appreciate all the hard work. One of my FO76 goals is to have my main learn all the plans/recipes. Just need Mire Healing Salve and the Owl nuggets.
---
Paced
---
I thought Free Range but didn't want to say as I wasn't 100%, not a melee player so probably not the best person to help you unfortunately!
---
Wow this is awesome
---
Start working on a build now. You probably won't finish it until level 80 but the sooner you begin working on it the easier it will be later.
---
Players can’t kill your pets
---
Interesting idea...but with the trouble Bethesda has had implementing the simplest of things...I still wouldn’t be in favor of it. I shall stick to my pen and paper which is easy peasy.
---
It’s perfectly relevant. You’re whining about being uncomfortable, but you started off being vulgar.
---
This is a very simple concept.
---
You’re expecting to be treated differently than the way you are treating others. 
---
That’s hypocrisy.
---
I'll keep that in mind! However I am in the mood for specifically helping some dude
---
Used it three times. No complaints from others, no frame drops for me. On pc btw
---
Some people will put an item up for sale for over the odds, so it looks like they have a wide variety of items for sale.
---
I have one cajun beans for sale for 50 caps, and a stimpak super for 75. Nobody buys them But I have food and stimpaks available.
---
Sithlord73
---
you do you i guess
---
For a fast paced run and gun build, I prefer vampire's heavy guns at 20% health with bloodied stuff.  Vampire's keeps you alive, bloodied stuff gives you decent damage.
---
Any suggestions for legendary and rifles
---
Much appreciated anyway!
---
Make sure you grab some of the perks that boost your ammo crafting along the way. You only need a couple points in your perception and you can just slot the card in and slot it back out for something useful when you're done making ammo. I'm almost 100% sure its a perception perk card that gives you bonus ammo when crafting but idk.
---
Ok any legendary suggestion
---
Which doesn’t even drop a legendary on death...
---
Been trying for awhile now. I feel like it’s hopeless tho with how big the pool is.
---
You mean ammosmith? Thats in agility and i have it
---
Game is too easy. I can literally solo the queen no problem AND I can solo earl because of being a dedicated tank build using bugged magic damage which I know isn’t the issue in point here but regardless, this is a step in the right direction to make a challenging game where resources will actually hold a lot of value for once
---
Well that would depend if you want full health or low health. I'd recommend obviously bloody for low health and junkies for high health but anti armor and quad are also good. Toss on some gun fu in agility and it'll be a very fast pace build
---
That sounds awesome.
---
It would have been great if after the fight, the 'cultists' turned into 'blood eagles' or something else to signify their loss in faith.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/FitwNNq.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/FitwNNq.jpeg)
---
Made a little meme based on your comment because it made me giggle.
---
You said fast paste build.  The word is paced.
---
Number 7 should have its own subreddit.
---
Ok thanks I'll take it in to consideration thanks
---
That's part of the fun. I an pleased I can no longer one shot everything.
---
I just started an alt and it was refreshing to actually have to think about what I was doing.
---
It’s also probably worth noting that there are probably some veteran scumba.. players.. who create low level toons just to try to mooch off other veteran players.
---
Oh sorry I'm shit at english even though I'm from England
---
I don’t see the point in having a daily limit when there is already a limit to how much you can hold anyways
---
Not sure about that - he is still wearing his pajamas. 
---
He might just be sleep walking and has no idea what is actually going on. So we cannot really attribute that to courage.
---
I run a VATS pistol build with an instigating .44 and I have to say the only end game content I struggle with is ACP, everything else pretty much dies in the first hit. Bosses are tricky so I have another .44 with anti armor and explosive rounds for more sustained consistent damage. I have max luck and agility and use crits for like almost every single shot, feels like they hardly tested the limits of VATS because it's truly ridiculous what I can do with that mechanic.
---
I'd recommend plenty of excess adhesive for a fast paste build.
---
Most English speakers are terrible at English.
---
I think it’s good but I can’t tell the difference between a bloodied ultracite gatling laser and a ghoul slayer’s gamma
---
Ah ok any suggestion for weapons
---
Quotes by fictional characters are never relevant
---
Ha alr that made me laugh I'm editing it now
---
You're not 'poor', you are rich in spirit...
---
Also you seem to be irradiated and dying.. may want to seek out medical help.
---
I ran across an interesting camp today, it had an munitions machine like there is at the munitions factory at the camp. I'm thinking they must've blueprinted it and then placed it.
---
Sounds like they could have been trying to craft something. Its possible.
---
Oh that's great to know. I'm lvl 90 and still learning new things about the game all the freaking time!
---
Apologies accepted. I've always stayed in till the mine collapses. From what I gather there's no downside to it and I'd rather loot right up till the last minute anyway lol.
---
That’s what I did and added Better Critical’s. I’ve got a J2525 Fixer and it made a big difference. I can spam Crits like crazy
---
I think the 50 cal is a good mix between damage and easy ammo to craft.  25% faster fire rate and either 15% faster reload or 90% reduced weight should be the other stars.  But vampire's is the most important, then 25, then 15.  A one star vampire's 50 cal is still really good.
---
I've deffo been a victim of the wait/lag issue.
---
Uh actually newbies, if one of you has one of them useless Responder Fireman outfits, I'll take it off your hands.
---
They may not have known.  Hopefully they read this.
---
\- 2,5k hours gameplay and i only saw one 3\* Scorched outside from the Hordeevent
---
Sometimes, they comment on choices you didn't even make. If you keep Johnny alive, Meg will talk as if he didn't make it.
---
Nice! That's basically the god roll I'm chasing. Even with scaly skin I can crit over and over, but I'm just trying to squeeze more out of it until I can get a -25AP weapon at least.
---
No Teslas during ACP!   Unless you want to see a slide show of yourself getting killed and failing the event.
---
Yh theres on if you complete Becketts quest line I think which is ok but yh I'll keep my eye out for one do u know the base level requirements
---
Characters are completely separate, just like the other games.
---
In 10 days, get legendary luck legendary perk and you can have both.
---
Exactly. I dont blame him per-say. Just, allow the person that put the card in to activate it ONLY. Or have a timer that cant be skipped.
---
Levels 25, 35, and 45.
---
Apparently going for 25-30k now for the mask. I had one and didnt even know how rare it was. Glad I kept it. Got stupid lucky. I've had the game for almost a month and have the scout mask, bos jumpsuit, white powder jumpsuit, and whitespring jumpsuit.
---
Reinstall the game on an SSD and you'll go "wow" when you get dropped in Nuclear Winter a full 15 seconds before the guy who dropped next to you
---
I don't know why, but I keep finding this, the Grafton Monster, Megasloths, and that buzzy thing with big eyes lately.
---
All Teslas are great. You can't change my mind. 😤
---
Nice. Thanks for the heads up. I havent seen or heard this before so Ill go check it out.
---
When they surmise the situation accurately, they are quite relevant.
---
But let’s try this instead: *‘If you act like a jerk, expect to be treated like a jerk’.*
---
Its for a known glitch.  If someone can empty out your whole vendor its glitches and they get everything for free.
---
It just herpa derp.
---
Yes! It doesn't matter who's trying to trade with me, I have a hard enough time keeping my character under the weight limit as it is, everything I have on me, I need, everything I want to sell is in my vending machine. People trying to initiate trade always just leads to me awkwardly leaving, or showing them my stuff, then exiting out when they request something I don't want to sell.
---
Sick
---
Everyone stopped panicking at the disco due to the ket wearing off, hydrated themselves, got a taxi home and lit an incense cone
---
Ah alr thanks alot I'm probs gonna use the 50.c or the hand made
---
How about when you pretend to be superior you show your true worth
---
Good luck.
---
Imagine if we could make our own robots like in Fallout 4.
---
Loa tzu 4000 bc
---
I knew of it, but figured it was part of a quest that I hadn't found.   Now I know where the key is,  cheers!
---
Awesome
---
Someone is sharing a WR perk.
---
reduced my resolution to 1600x900 just to play that event. Its dumb how fast you level up too,, I got from 40 to 50 in just two events.
---
Buy it from someone. It was a Meat Week drop.
---
Trade for it, it was a meat week reward. An event which has past now.
---
You could just sit on the terminal it blocks anyone else from activating it
---
Thank you 😊
---
PSA you can blueprint the Ammo Factory and build at your own camp if you want to stick it to the man
---
That’s why I activate immediately.
---
If you want a secret door or a planetarium or anything else I will build at your camp. Xbox. Other than that I think you won't make it.
---
Had to say goodbye to my first camp because of this. The second one looks much better because I know what I'm doing now, but it felt really sad to rebuild this time around. They really encourage you to choose a more permanent spot, which I like, but on the off chance you mess up and move it, you break the whole thing.
---
I have a magic gun now, but prior to that, I did as much damage to the boss as I could while keeping spawns off the harder hitting players and reviving whoever I can. Team medic is a good perk card to have on during that event.
---
For real. part of the game is leveling up and figuring things out (Aka playing the game). What’s the point in playing if your not going to play
---
ah, you mean just be in the terminal screen?
---
Played a bit at launch, but came back &amp; started a new game shortly after wastelanders. Was simply happy not to get ganked and find the guy dropped me a lvl 5 shotgun, shells, and a few stim packs.
---
After the first few sentences I could tell it was just whining and stopped.
---
I don't think you can join a server of a person who isn't your friend on the PC or at least this wasn't the case a while back when I tried it.
---
Oh wow, I haven't even looked into PTS stuff until now. This seems pretty cool.
---
100k caps worth of gear. Jesus. I want to take a shot just reading that.

---
Yyyeeesssss, this is what I imagined their rework would look like.
---
Back pack or armor, does it have weight reduction of any sort?
---
Nice I didn’t think of that I’m constantly running to fallen people on the field because I know sometimes you can’t get back in thanks
---
containers at the overseers camp and suitcases in highly traveled train stations like morgantown, whitesprings or watoga
---
Yurrrrrrr
---
I’m not pretending. 
---
And I prefer this quote of his: *”Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in giving creates love.”*
---
If you want to quote Lao Tzu, that’s the place to start.
---
I was at one last night that I literally just walked off from. After seeing noone get a pylon (but me) and the usual 'headless chicken' movements of the attendees I didn't hesitate to bail. I'll assume they failed. Owner of the card would be shattered at that turnout.  
---
If I see a group isn't up to it I won't bother these days trying to make the magic happen. I'm sure I'm not alone in this mentality. I won't even run a silo until I've checked the median level of those on the server.
---
One of the reason I use PA over SS. I’d want both Vanguard and Unyielding and to get a 3* I’d wait for both may take over 100 pieces each hahaha.
---
Regarding the rest of your post, I’m not sure about the Chameleon thing. I use my stealth suit a lot. As for explosive damage, it pertains to all explosive weapons. How many points you invest into demo expert etc. is solely up to you, however. And lastly, I would try and get Class Freak in there somehow. The negative effects suck enough with it.
---
fuck, I can't imagine life without marsupial. That's my only complaint when I have to level a new toon. I want my jumpy jumps!
---
Thanks everyone for replying !
---
Ive bought some levels with my atoms so i will make it ! :D
---
Thankfully I have never had this happen. I have also never asked someone for help. That's what the internet is for. There's a whole world of people that love to tell you how much they know.
---
Every public event possible and daily quests.
---
this is kinda funny to me, because im a low level (currently 58) and i completely ignore other players. but ive had a few higher levels beg me for purified water and addictol. i give it to them because theyre not hard to get, like at all, but man the irony.
---
im not saying new players cant be annoying or anything btw, but it just made me chuckle how my situation is reversed.
---
It’s only IF we meet the objective of donating to the Fortifying Atlas material now.
---
Check [the Events Page](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
Not sure myself.
---
You looked that up , i quoted from memory,  third time , go bother someone who cares
---
450 in the Atomic Shop
---
Stop whinging, server hop...whatever! Seriously. There are bigger problems, and a whole lot of people enjoying the game as is. Stop being a baby.
---
I don't know if there's any specific named variant, but I run an AP limb damage double-barreled with all the shotgun perks equipped. Most things usually splatter and I can keep running!
---
The moon was invented
---
Yeah. Unfortunately,  I've seen a group of people somehow let a mirelurk get to the island, spawn a queen, kill the queen and get the consolation prize for "completing" the event.
---
What are the mods like "me handy buzz saw hand" or whatever, meant for? 
---
(Serious question I'ma noob mostly)
---
I saw a scorched scorched the other day
---
And Lao Tzu never said your alleged quote. Perhaps you *should* have looked it up.
---
It looks like a Mormon temple.
---
The daily limits n bugs killed this game big time
---
Dont worry about missing it from Meat Week, it will come back soon with the Brotherhood Atlas event.
---
Its called paraphrase
---
Again bubye
---
Love it.
---
And people say you can't win this game.
---
He's talking about the level 9 guy in front of him.
---
Have a munch every now and again if you cannot be bothered to cook.
---
More like ‘butchered translation’. 
---
Bubye
---
Kevduit made a funny but useful guide on YT https://youtu.be/j-Fqj2ofTJ8
---
Yeah I might make the new legendary perks work in my favor. I loved how many crits having 15 luck gave me, but started trimming down so I could have more Int and Agi
---
So long.
---
Doesnt look to promising..
---
Kim Jong Un found out about this, and decided he wanted it for himself
---
That damn mire salve :(
---
Suitcases at railway stations is still the meta as well as just dumping it on the ground.
---
Off-meta picks are cash registers at vendors.
---
Whoa!! Splendid
---
I would, but it permanently takes up camp budget when it’s gone
---
Good riddance
---
Nice. Don’t forget about Bird Bones +4 AGI and Eagle Eyes. +25% Crit Damage and +4 PER
---
Whovthe fuck pays for ammo? Lol.
---
My current favorite two-gun combo is a pump action shotgun + .38 auto Fixer. Bloodied shotgun, Instigating Fixer (until I find Bloodied).
---
My bloodied combat rifles r selling like hotcakes at 6K each. Fixers at 6K~8K are easy sell too.
---
Man, I wish I thought of that!, That is what I will do from now on.
---
its a common problem.  You hvae to uninstall game and delets saved data.  clear chase too.  Dont worrt bethesda server saves your progress.  Id create a bethesda.net acoount while you are at it.
---
Awesome, I have something to investigate tonight. I don't remember being in there, but I am old, so I sometimes need my memory jogged. Fingers crossed I haven't.
---
Hey if it 1 cap per bullet I'll but it.
---
It works alot tho ! A big thank you here, it feels good being able to decorate the corner of a room like i want to or putting stuff under the staircase to finally save some space ! 👍
---
You may have missed it because the image is a guy dressed totally in power armor, that's why I initially ignored it.
---
Explore the forest thoroughly before venturing elsewhere. Loot everything. Pharma farma perk is nice at low level. Use water and food for healing whenever possible. Do events in that region also as they usually give a handful of stims. You'll have more than you know what to do with before long.
---
Got em. Scaly was the only one I was on the fence about. It was leftover from my STR/Heavy build and I was wondering if it was holding me back.
---
I agree with most of what your saying. It doesn’t hit hard. Only issue is I don’t think night is 12 hrs. Even if it where your not max damage that entire time.
---
They typically comes back around, I don’t know if there’s a certain number of days or anything. I’m waiting on the junk walls myself
---
The best thing to do with treasure maps, is wait until you have 5 the same, find the location....Google, and then dig and swap servers.
---
Or sell them. I think the former is the best option.
---
Im a bloodied build and i literally just accept I will be the one on all pylons, whether I activate the card or not. Nobody else rarely does. I just have to spam my stimpacks. Luckily they are so ludicrously easy to get I dont care burning through them all.
---
opps, your right. I guess my commend doesn't make much sense now...
---
He couldn't have any. He had already used all his pocket money on Lego sets made specifically for him
---
are you Pc?
---
Probably a hacked weapon (not just magic) and all the insane stacked damage buffs.
---
They drop from the Free Range event.
---
Thanks for the info but I did my first sale ever and sold the bloody fixer just recently for 30k caps and rad barrel plan.
---
No ps4
---
Where did you hear this?
---
I didn’t know those were around on PS4 as well. I should probably have mentioned my platform. 
---
But huh.. Would you look at that.
---
The Suitcases in train stations are usually where I drop stuff, as well as find stuff.
---
they also need to increase legendary spawns..
---
I might try my strangler pa next time
---
I always believe it was for people to accidentally buy it.
---
Don't buy stims. You're better off taking workshops... You'll get most of your caps back and you'll get rewarded with stims and radaways and other useful stuff. You don't need to build them up or stick around after you claim it either. Just take your rewards and move on. Game vendors don't give a lot of caps. The easiest way to get caps at the lower levels is to build a bunch of water purifiers at your camp and sell water to the vendors. Or you can go to a places you know you can clear easily and collect up all the guns and go vendor them.
---
This is where the shift to paid cosmetic items really hurts gameplay... you REALLY want a certain piece for your RP needs, but even if you wanted to shell out $5-10 bucks for it, you’re SOL if you didn’t catch a limited-edition run of something 😂
---
FYI- It’s against the rules to Witch-hunt
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)   needs to update more often then once a day... and Never updates over the weekends...
---
Yeah no kidding, the walls were in a bundle the first time they came around, I’m hoping they sell them individually at some point
---
Selling ammo you don’t use in your Camp for 1 cap each is a decent way
---
Sweet
---
Yep I made the mistake of buying $40 worth of Atoms just to get the Contemporary camp bundle, only to later decide I wanted regular shack walls... but hey, Todd Howard has needs, right?
---
Yeah, I’ve been playing since March and I’ve already seen some thing come back around.
---
Wait speed demon stops the extra effect? Next you’ll tell me better sneak on armour cancels the other preexisting perk on fixers
---
Lol what did he do to you
---
ahh, makes sense now, limited space, limited party. Thanks guys/gals :D
---
Haha and he's looking at you like "wanna try me?"
---
Do you mean selling them to a vendor or constructing a vending machine?
---
They did actually turn non hostile for a while. Still red, but they all went to sit down and stuff for about 10 seconds before they started attacking again. Though I do have maxed sneak, so probably why.
---
I feel your pain. I missed the Red Rocket garage/station structure 😔
---
All damage calculations, unless you are gunning around with 0 bonuses to damage. damage perks? that counts.
---
Nice. Looks like Scientology went off the dark creature deep end. Inside is real creepy too. We’re the candles on the floor from atomic shop at some point?
---
Please remain civil.
---
Overseers camp, wayward picnic table.
---
Thanks, yeah that's for sure.  Beth has their hands full.
---
As of yet this isn't witch hunting I don't think
---
What I mean is that the effects I listed won't get worse themselves comparatively because they don't give damage.  In essence they're getting buffed, comparatively.
---
I woulda done the same but now I'm kinda over it. If people adhere to basic mechanics it's all a pushover.
---
With excess Fixer plans sitting in my STASH I don't even need those. I generally only do Encryptid to help the key user have some degree of success.
---
I’ve always wondered what interactions between Cultists and Mothmen were like... do non-Scorched Mothmen usually attack Cult camps?
---
And fixing bugs and improving performance would also be nice. Such things aren't high priority though, I'm just throwing extra suggestions out there. Whatever fallout 76's razor thin profit margins can support development for. Like more exterior house walls but no dual-sided (for wallpapers) interior walls.
---
I don't think it'll be an issue. It'll either be:
---
Bethesda will move the goal post again and we get the sale, or
---
Dupers will ramp up to cover the gap because they'd probably want the sale as much as any other player, or
---
None of the above happen, event fails and Bethesda gets massive backlash for not covering the gap like they did with concrete and at the same time it serves as a data point towards the evidence that the player base is "dying" because not enough people showed up to help out.
---
It's a dumb business and PR move to go the last option, especially given the precedent they set with concrete.
---
We'll be fine.
---
\- WC ore SBQ in 3- 5 sec. is not cuz an magic wpn !  
---
the magic wpn can kill fast but not superfast, it looks like u met a player with an modded one.  
---
...hopfully Beth. work on it with the same passion as if the ATOM Shop is down...
---
I've been playing since beta and havent launched a nuke yet even in nuclear winter lol. Had a team mate ask me if I wanted to launch it but he didnt understand my thumbs down then thumbs up and I shoulda put my mic on but I was just trying to get my nw daily and we came in like 3rd place lol.
---
I'm also on PC. Nothing but massive problems, best case scenario: game is unplayable, worst case: game crashes.  
---
Had a member in the group curse out the guy using the Tesla and wrecking the game for everyone
---
Honestly keeping vsync on is better.
---
Idk if this is outdated but harvesting and selling purified waters. I think theres a water purifier plan at the Charleston dmv area
---
Get the luck perk pharma farma. Get an extra look in every med box and extra chems. Sell the druggy stuff for profit and keep the extra stimpaks.
---
Wow , you just cant give up . Pathetic
---
wait, there’s no text chat in game? i haven’t played since launch and mostly stuck to myself so i’ve never tried to use it.
---
Construct a vending machine at your camp and sell them to other players
---
I think all scorched enemies share the same "faction", so they attack the same things.
---
Sure I can. 
---
Can you?
---
Hacked weapons is more of a PC thing but who knows...
---
Immediately gets one-shot because deathclaws are so weak.
---
Okay, you win, you can have it back.
---
My rig: i5 4670k, gtx 970, 8gb ram
---
I get like 30 FPS in places like Morgantown airport, Foundation and Crater but get 60+ in most places. This game could really do with some optimisation.
---
Due to the sneak cap armor pieces, agility and the sneak perk card can technically negate the sneak perk on the fixer. So of you're running a full unyielding set with high agility points and the sneak peek anyways, the fixer just becomes the best commando weapon and nothing more than a stronger combat rifle with Shrek skin
---
must burn the mutant, the haritic, and the witch
---
Sad but true
---
Go to an area where you can easily wipe out all the enemies efficiently. Loot all their weapons and sell them.  I would use Morgantown train yard and airport because there are lots of enemies and the train station is right there if you get over weight.
---
And please for the love of God add a way we can view our personal silo cooldown times other than just at the point we try to launch a nuke.
---
Then he got angry. Really angry. So angry that gave himself a hair cut using only sticks and slate
---
Go slower. Don’t fast travel so much. You should be keeping your adventures local to your CAMP area, moving your CAMP when you start to get into new locations.
---
I have never seen anything like it. 
---
I hope they realize how much this is affecting players. 
---
But it will not stop me from keep trying the event ofc. It was just a biiiiiig bummer for my first time. 
---
At least I got the rug plan lol.
---
Legendary Spawns are perfectly fine, you get a legendary enemy in most events and you get a legendary as a reward for completing events.
---
Only thing that is busted is the 3 Stars giving 1 Stars constantly.
---
I take it that you've tried the scan and repair option?
---
I agree with that but the main quest takes you all over
---
I think that's what's wrong with this game. There is nothing at all we need from each other, ultimately
---
That's not commonly seen
---
I remembered what sleep is, and went to bed
---
one of the biggest FPS killers are that massiv overloaded light effects.   
---
they are some usefull cfg. binds u can try!    
---
this worked for me, its not perfektly but much more stabil as before...  
---
\*eng. is not my Native Language , so sry for some mistakes\*
---
The blue suitcase leaning against the bench at Watoga station was such a good drop that I still check out of habit in a private world.
---
The abondoned waste dump is part of the main quest line.
---
For travel purposes get the travel perk card and the hard bargain perk for selling to vendors.
---
(Its ok bro, I know you read the whole thing) 
---
Hope you have a good labor day weekend, try to lay off the salt tho.. making you a bit bitter. But if yer feeling a little salty still, you can suck on the awards for this post cuz THEY'RE FUCKING SWEET
---
Calling out again to players from Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia or nearby countries. Join us in our almost daily grinding in events, camp building and legendary hunting.
---
I want that damned Mothman Statue back finally, been waiting FOREVER!
---
Public events are free to travel to and give 100 caps or so per event. Golf outfits and straight jackets sell for good caps and are easy to get at the golf course at white spring and the asylum near watoga. Crystal screws and a few other junk items are also vender-able pre-bulking and you'll get more than you need if you pick up scrap and store what you run across. Also nuclear winter gives you xp and caps without any tax on your adventure character although it's not a lot it can build up if you don't play adventure much. This is just what I didn't see already mentioned here, everyone else is spot on.
---
It is weird to see people rehashing other menus from the game and going "See! Look, just make it like this!?" I am pretty sure they would love to do exactly that.
---
Apologized for having to temporarily leave the project "And then" so I could get some sleep
---
From what I just witnessed they must be all over
---
I have it just not the stuff to make it with
---
"The hardest choices require the strongest wills" -Will Smith
---
if legendary spawns are more common... they wouldn't be legendary
---
*jaw drop* beautiful! Had to share it.
---
And it’s not going anywhere. 
---
I don’t reaaaaally wanna tell you how to play. That’s the best part of Bethesda games for sure. But if your problem is lack of funds, building resources where you are is a good way to do it.
---
Tat pretty much sums up the game. Bethesda sucks at solving bugs entirely without breaking something else
---
Yh I was litterly watching it a min a go
---
Bonus tip: drink toilet water for -50% lifespan
---
I mean i get the legendary spawns thing but most of the time we dont use most of the garbage drops they just end up in the grinder..
---
Completely agree! Great post. Although I follow everything FO76 and follow thie reddit, I have not played the game. I hope to try it put on game pass (pc) soon. 
---
But I have encountered many of those in many other games and it just becomes a hassle and annoying imo.
---
I’m 26 right now and exploring solo all over.  I’m around the Welch area right now, but I’ve dipped into a few areas with level 60 enemies that were a struggle.  Even today I was at the mining HQ where you need to make the mining power armor (didn’t have enough black titanium) and was playing cat and mouse with a level 40 Assaultron that could 2 shot me in the robotics bay with the power armor work area. But I enjoy that little challenge.
---
if u lucky u can solve the prob. with deleting  delete the .ini files from "My Games" folder ...  
---
\* IF U ON PC \*
---
That came off snarky as hell. Not meant to be that way. Just an observation.
---
I'm not bloodied, but my magic furious one does alright
---
I have and it didn't work I'm going to have to uninstall and reinstall entirely
---
Lol , i said i have plenty of time.  Show me your superiority and move on . You never asked me to leave you alone,  i have asked you several times.  You quoted some bs imaginary character then frantically searched for a loa tzu quote 🤣
---
These are the best weapon in the game, I soloed Earle in 6 minutes with it! If I had more in luck I probably could have done it faster!
---
I jumped on Elder Scrolls Online today for an XBOX Gamepass quest and I am much happier with how our Atom shop looks. I know that game is larger and has been going on for years, but wow... it’s a lot a lot.
---
Bonus tip: take the second helping of tato salad. Do it.
---
Dude I just want the quantum sign it has yet to return
---
Find a trusty gaming buddy. He should be able to help while u logoff off n join back with ur mule.
---
Otherwise is using bethesda launcher n launch 2 instances of the game and do the transfer. Your PC must have enough ram n speed to do so. You need 2 account here.
---
1 more alternative is 2 accounts, 2 laptops which I m doing when I m alone gaming n need to clear my stash
---
Alright thanks
---
Stealth plus commando works pretty good. Speaking legendaries, instigating and antiarmor work nicely with full health builds
---
Never speak to me or my son ever again, you arsonist!
---
I played for a while when it first came out (got to level 50 or so) then stopped, then I’m jumping back in now starting a new character (about level 30 now).
---
Honestly, I keep completely to myself, not even teaming up at this point, since I want to experience it all myself without the outside help, and I also love the single-player feel.
---
I don’t really want the help. It defeats the experience, it feels like cheating. Some help can be fine, but just being handed legendary weapons and armor and random stuff seems like jumping the gun on the experience. I love the community but I’m here for the game too, I want the challenge.
---
Not to mention mutation starched genes
---
And Events with the exclamation icon. Must go. Even if u dun get a "loot" from not giving enuff damage. Go get the treasury notes
---
Really nice gun but please, don't bring it to populated events
---
? 😂
---
Im on pc, and also ZAP zap
---
And get mad at you for not rezzing them.
---
When someone does this I get behind them and fire at the next team we come across then run. Keep doing that if they don't get them the first time.
---
We’re on PS4 if That makes a difference
---
Assaultrons only get worse from there , you were lucky to not find a Glitched one (the glitched ones shoot lasers non stop without any cooldown , ultra broken)
---
But if you want to have a easier time, break their legs , it will be a kids toy, it still do alot of damage and can shoot laser , but you just to keep in their back and it will be a easy prey
---
While many valid points, the need to call out 'newbs' and consistently replying in comments like 'lol right?!  What can you do for me, newb?!' reeks of insecurity and a need to want to 'stick it to someone.'
---
I genuinely hope this post helped you scratch that itch because as a person just reading, oof, you seem to really hate people new to this game to the point that you're putting them down for being new.
---
Again, many valid points here, but the presentation just really is off-putting and kinda reeks of elitism as this stuff is par for the course in almost all MMOs.  This isnt new to Fallout 76 and will continue to be a thing in all MMOs; as many noted, best to just let it go and move on.
---
I wish it weren't so, but this post will change nada about these issues in MMOs.
---
^^This is the biggest seller and mutation serums.
---
Hm it might have been fallout 1 I can't really remember
---
Get the to the [meme explainer machine](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dont-talk-to-me-or-my-son-ever-again)!
---
Hells yeah!!
---
🤣🤣Yes he does
---
Yea. I used Top of the World as my early game grind spot before graduating to the Whitespring. It's great at lower levels. Can chimes. Aluminum everywhere. Tons of plan spawns. 
---
Come to think of it, I may go back once One Wasteland hits. My permacamp is at the acid deposit at the end of the falls across the street anyway.
---
Vampire melee with full nocturnal armor. 
---
I know a guy.
---
Unless you have no ap! Which if you either have dodgy or over encumbered you probably can't!
---
Pc or console, unfortunately servers are trash
---
I did T-65 even though the extra DR/ER isn’t going to make a huge difference but I heard the acid DOT is basically like 4 damage a second and they have to be touching you basically
---
No, I really needed their help, they were super willing but the goddamn wendigo didn't spawn in the cave, on the 20th time, they were 200 levels higher than me and I'd already got killed about 20 times. 
---
I called in a random higher level player, they spoke on the mic but I couldn't speak back to explain, 100% a thanks\explanation post not a hunt.
---
In any other Bethesda game I would agree but ive had people tell me to get through the main quest as quick as possible.
---
Every time you reply, by your own analysis it’s ‘pathetic’. Your words, not mine. 
---
By the rules you’ve set, whoever gets the last word is the pathetic one and the one that chooses to walk away is superior.
---
Therefore, if you choose to reply again, you’ve reversed the current status. 
---
But even knowing these rules you created (which I don’t agree with, by the way), you won’t be able to resist replying.  You’ll willing accept the self-imposed label of ‘pathetic’ and bestow upon me your endorsement as superior (not that your opinion has any weight with me). 
---
So please, go ahead. Make the reply you know that you can’t resist. Because just like virtually every other troll I’ve ever seen, you’ve crumbled when someone called you out on your reprehensible behavior, even to the point of claiming to be uncomfortable.
---
Once you reply to this, I will be done. And literally nothing you say can change the fact that you’re choosing to call yourself pathetic by replying. Not an emoji, not a lengthy rant. Nothing. 
---
So go right ahead. Make that reply.
---
One of the best examples of a new player with proper etiquette I’ve experienced was two kids inviting me to their party to ask me if I’d be willing to sell the Sheepsquatch Mascot outfit for less than I had it marked for since one of them really wanted it, they were really polite in asking for it, explained that even pooling all their caps together they still wouldn’t be able to afford it normally and were willing to give me all the caps between the two of them, which was roughly 500 if I remember right, even though only one of them wanted it. I was initially selling it for 1.5-2k caps but with how polite they were, the fact that one was ready to help his friend no questions asked and with how young they sounded I just gave it to them for free and I gotta say I’ve never heard anyone happier and more grateful before, they were genuinely surprised and thankful and that was enough for me. 
---
More noobs need to be like them
---
Shotguns as well... if I didn’t know any better I’d say you were copying me. Lol
---
I feel this mornings poop was more work than it should have been also, so I know the feeling.
---
Where is their god now?
---
If he got clapped with a legacy, he deserved it.
---
Didn’t go bloodied till after level 200, how many unyielding pieces did I script previously? Who knows.
---
Really? I’ve heard much the opposite. Like it’s thought you should get to level 50 \*without* doing most quests first. The items you’re rewarded are leveled, so you’ll get the best versions if you are over 50.
---
