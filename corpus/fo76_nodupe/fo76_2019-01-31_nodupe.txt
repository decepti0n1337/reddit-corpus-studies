Dupers have duped everything all ready. They duped guns Melee weapons junk bobble heads armor Stimpacks Radaway Bobby pins maps magazines serums ammo.
---

---
They have duped everything in the game already.
---
Melee builds where always Overpowered. Melee users where mad because TSE Guns gave Gun users a chance and where winning 80% of the PVP encounters. Now 95% of PVP encounters Melee users will win like they use to before TSE where massively Duped.

---
Not everyone thinks its a fuck up, just the vocal CJ.
---
Heard we're heading for a dry spell.
---
Before patch or after?
---
Oh ok thank you!
---
Even though I know this is a joke, that kind of situation would genuinely explain a majority of this game's current state
---
Same. I won‚Äôt play until either they cut their losses and rebuild the game totally or just focus on Fallout 5 or ESVI. 
---
Oh, wait. You're OP. Shoot. Sorry bro. If you get a ps4 you can both play the game again and have all my awesome shit. Like 17 aluminum, 5 springs, and an adhesive farm.
---
Bruh, if that's game design, that makes it even worse. What an incredibly idiotic and unintuitive system that would be.
---
But it's not, they've clearly gone back on old coding and then made mistakes, hence why we've a bunch of previous bugs in the game once again
---
It doesn't happen all the time for me. But it did happen a few. I haven't tried the game again since the patch.
---
This right here!
---
They've probably pulled resources as they realised there plans to get Loot boxes on the Atom store along with perk packs are shot. 
---
They can't release those items now as they planned to (hence why Austin made the game) so they spat there dummy out and pulled what little profit they could by tanking the dev team and whatever other resources they could.

I'm all good mate, thank you. Our main concern is just ensuring the issues that players are reporting are communicated to the team. We understand the frustrations but we'll always respect how dedicated this subreddit is
---
I wouldn't mind them taking a bit of time, I'm talking about them not even actually reading what I send.  Mine are being answered by a bot or an asshole.  One of those.  I lean toward it being some angry prick pushing the go @#$#@ yourself button.
---
Ah nm then. Maybe I just saw savage divide and my mind instantly jumped to whitesprings
---
Your a nice player I kill the wanted player and 9 out of 10 times leave their junk. 
---
What platform do you use?
---
Just googled it and it brought me here. Very cool there needs to be more of this stuff
---
whats your psn?
---
They reset every 12 hours i believe so you likely sold them stuff earlier
---
People complained " I don't want it to automatically consume my bulked cargo I was saving to sell to a vendor"
---
More like a rear view mirror.
---
????Slenderman vampire things????
---
What have I been missing???
---
It's gone forever man. üòë
---
I am not so naive as to think coding is as easy as speaking, but TS &amp; E should never have been an available combination.  They should both be primary effects.  
---
In that respect, Explosive SHOULD have been nerfed in that the Demolitions Expert Perk did not apply.   The Demolitions Expert Perk that brought Explosive Weapons to a respectable level rather than their base uselessness other than extra carry weight, should have been left alone.  Without complimenting eachother in an OP manner, each as a primary effect would give the Gunner an even chance on level with the Melee'er.  My TSE handmade was OP, but TS alone would make it around 150 DMG, and E alone maybe 180(guesstimate calculated by Ballistic dmg + 1/2 basic dmg of a frag grenade?) without the Demo Perk.  The explosive is a catch 22, in that too close and you burn yourself, and too far too much accuracy is lost.
---
How about writing some code(again I'm not a programmer) that, upon the next time a TSE weapon is repaired, offers the owner a choice between TS &amp; E as the primary weapon effect.  That's it.  That option would make me return to the game.  
---
I spent 50 levels spec'ing for PA Melee, then the next 90 for Vangaurd Armor Sneak/Rifleman.  Then your "nerfs" threw that many hours and more out the window.
---
They do work, but:
---
1. The lighting on them looks terrible.  Just a big round blob around the arrow.
---
2. One of them clips backward on the walls (similar to that one Cabinet that snaps to the ceiling).
---
dont you know springs go for 5 caps each?!

No but that was the response the community got

Hate to be that guy, but I've been trying to get attention the the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD issue for a while now, and I've even got a fix for it.   
---
I think this is one of the root causes for CTD's people are experiencing, especially related to the Queen fights, as it is the single most popular PA helmet upgrade.  
---
Mind taking a look?  
---
[Bug Fix] Pretty sure I just figured out the cause of the PowerArmor Targeting HUD CTD's AND THE FIX. http://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/

---
The recent patch is definitely an End Game content.
---
Responding to someone questioning your qualifications with you qualifications... rofl. Can‚Äôt win with the internet.
---
As I watch all my weapons disintegrate... Five caps at a time.
---
You think they're capable of implementing a separate counter within the game? The challenges already sort of work, that's enough for them. If you kept your system on 24/7 and never had any server maintenance, power issues, etc, it would take close to a year to reach that. This game will be dead within a year
---
Thank you stormy - I've definitely reported this as an issue that affects all platforms
---
"use a bobblehead" It was probably screenshotted before the latest patch so make that more "use 100 of them" or maybe even more than just 100
---
Definitely broken.  I will be at \[CAUTION\] after killing all the enemies in a area, then fast travel to my camp, and I'm still there. I'll fast travel to a map icon, and my friend right next to me is Hidden while I'm still at caution.  If I server hop, it seems to work for a while, but it seems like as soon as I hit Caution again it stays that way unless I change servers.  Bad medicine, Bart no like.
---
Ps4
---
I don‚Äôt really care about how they work, i just want it. Im server hopping on xbox trying to find it.
---
With the amount of positive circlejerk I saw doing the rounds on this sub repeatedly before yesterday's patch shitfest hit, I won't be surprised if it'll be back. Eventually all the players who have a bone to pick with this game for legitimate reasons will probably leave or be downvoted by the ''why does everyone say this game is bad?'' crowd- one or the other. I feel like it's pointless to report issues, as it feels like even small problems that the community widely agreed need fixing (plans need to show if known or not / vendor plan list being rng AND level gated was fucking stupid) took a looong time to get fixed. 
---
Meanwhile, DC'ing during a Silo run or Queen fight still costs you all your progress towards nuke launch and/or queen fight, and if DC in the silo, all the loot from there too. Doesn't matter if you can rejoin server via reconnecting to a recent player. You get kicked out, and it's over. Time wasted for fucking nothing, and more often than not, considering the Queen won't even drop loot for a good amount of people.  For what's basically the **ONLY** endgame content in this game, it seems like one tedious fucking gamble of your time that would probably be much better spent elsewhere.
---
should‚Äôve said that but the other options are still available for use :^((
---
I've been bitching and moaning for months about the same bugs. When will they nerf those? Please advise.
---
Thank you for clarifying, Trauma
---
Depends how hungry EA get with monetization, game seems solid. I'll be waiting for at least a month before bothering. Fk ea.
---
Congrats on the worst update yet boys. Keep it up, it's fuckin great. Really worth the 60 bucks I paid for it.
---
No.  It's number 3.
---
Wow, I had that one during a queen fight, but it seemed to be lag related. Once the server stabilized again after downing the queen (so, like, 5-10 minutes later) and loot was showing on bodies, my gun ‚Äúre-broke‚Äù and was finally actually unusable 
---
So is Weapon Artisan ...a completely different perk üòÄüòâ
---
I just had all my ranged weapons fail completely, damage shows then instant regen. I'm lvl 127 and couldn't take down a lvl 10 grafton monster, the one by Poseidon, with a 3 star Tesla rifle, or my Gauss also 3 star and even my explosive 45 machine gun was 2 shots to near zero health then bam full regen. 
---
I never said anything close to that though. But still it has changed.
---
I'm lurking because when the game is fixed up into a good PvE experience, I'll start playing.
---
I mean at this point that would but them time while everyone grinds new character builds.
---
They [promised PvP would be optional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IDLGUO7zXk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2854)?
---
That's the actual issue. Energy weapons don't need a damage buff, they just need to be affected by perks like ballistic weapons are. Enemies like scorchbeasts have high DRs for both types, I think around 200, but the AP perks only affecting ballistic is the killer. Energy weapons also don't have any high damage per shot weapons since gauss is ballistic and there's no laser musket.
---
Over 400 hours in, I've had drop 3 different Two-Shot weapons (Guass, Laser and pipe rifle) and zero explosive world drops (I was given a TSE handmade from a Robin Hood).
---
I forgot to mention, if they refuse, I kill them anyways but take their junk. 
---
well you know, the game was rigged from the start
---
I've had them stop working even without getting rad worms since the patch.
---
I did have "the blight" when I noticed it, though, so maybe other diseases are causing issues too.
---
Pip boy with a black out screen. Weak weapons and low level creatures taking way too much ammo to kill. XBOX ONE 
---
oh god! i didn't even think of this scenario. please let us lock items.
---
Meanwhile my game hasn't crashed once since beta.
---
Did you just assume xir gender
---
I thought they seemed higher, anyone know how much the increase was?
---
Right, then I'd say it has zero replayabilty.  I'd never want to collect all those plans again.
---
Honestly, if they did carry over, that would probably encourage me to replay it.  It provides more options for a subsequent character.
---
Can you please do something about the graphics? Remove the terrible unsharpen mask filter and add actual shadows to buildings - ambient occlusion is grossly overdone.
---
Jesus dude it was a joke, I wasn‚Äôt serious. No shit they don‚Äôt ACTUALLY expect us to play for over 7,000 hours Learn to recognize a joke, it‚Äôs not rocket science 
---
that sucks, but if you love it and the dps barely is different, still use it. it's probably also easier to get a hold of a perfect 3* one since they're cheaper.
---
Found the video

I've never seen more than 1 regen in maybe 30 odd sbq fights...
---
Some of the fixes they implemented and suggestions they took and updated for the community were great. The TSE change in both parts was awful. 
---
So your just gunna try and derail the discussion yeah? Nice.
---
Thank you for boiling it down so simply 
---
Bye cheater.
---
Its basically just a temporary solution to me not having the Signs and Letters plan.
---
my experience was that the two projectiles that get fired don't hit your crosshairs. 
---
I was pumped when I found a TS handmade for my automatic vats build, and then realized that it sucked because the bullets would miss at least 50% of the time vs 95% vats shots. 
---
Thank you to both of you! I've gotten confirmation that the dev team is looking into this issue right now

I can't craft power armor, even after I unbulked the components needed. 
---
I suppose I'm digging far too deep into the psychology of the whole matter. I'm more curious as to the community's response than the actual Nerfs. My question pertains not to side effects or turmoil perceived about the Nerf but how a Nerf can define a community's perception of the entire franchise. 
---
Is THIS the fallout/Bethesda community and how they really are? 
---
Are there other fallout games that have a fluid and quick response for immediate changes like this? I've only played since fallout 3 and it was a buy it and that's what you get no changes. Unless you got a third party mod or some DLC. 
---
Social Autism runs higher in men than women, I was only playing the odds 
---
I'm not mad at Bethesda. I'm just sad about it. It really sucks to even try to get my friends to get it they wont. I felt screwed pre-ordering and then playing the same game as the beta. It just sucks because you know some people over there care and there's other people over there that are like fuck it ship it. This game made it so I'll never preorder a game again. I love fallout, but goddammit you guys fucked this one up. I wish you could apologize for making such a bad game. I don't believe I'll ever buy another Bethesda, zenimax game ever again because you guys don't give a fuck so guess what I don't either. 
---
Paid 80. Poster on the wall. Vault boy masks and vault teck party hats. And it was worth every penny hell to start this game and getbto put my opinion in to what i would like is better than a game thats here you go all done. The case is i love the game, you get my comment so everyone that enjoys it and all its true falloutness will know you're all bandwagon haters and mainly Cunts peace out 
---
[removed]
---
So there QA are not the last port of call before deployment? 
---
So changes can occur to the code after QA have signed off on it and it can still be pushed as tested and approved even though its different and hasn't been? Surely those changes need QA approval no?
---
And if there QA couldn't test the list of what 75 changes in the last patch what were they actually testing?
---
So you just said yourself that twitch is better for games that are competitive and require skill to play, yet you're still using twitch viewership as a way to distinguish a good game?

Are you dumb?

Very possible if loading screens count
---
Sounds crazy but i miss even the bullshit of over repairing . Sadly this was my favorite game. but its just turning more and more into what everone else was saying it was going to be and is pretty unappealing .
---
Daily reminder, weapons don't just rely on the damage stat for performance, you should also consider a weapon's fire rate, reload speed, ammo capacity, level, rarity, splash damage, etc. Just because a weapon doesn't have high burst damage, doesn't mean they can't out perform a high burst weapon overtime. You also need to take into consideration that someone weapons can be more versatile than others or situational. Not far will you see a post talking about a Black Powder Rifle doing more damage than a Fat Man, but doesn't take into account that a Fat Man can hit multiple targets while a Black Powder Rifle can't. As far as durability goes, I'm pretty sure it's tied to those stats as well. 
---
Unless there's actual proof, math or visual representation to back up your claim, each of these posts are considered assumptions.
---
My t51b purple headlamp is an atom shop item now too
---
I use the verticle conduit with the connector and 2 bends. Put that one in a corner and the connector should be able to clip through the wall, then put a downward facing conduit connector on the bottom and top and you should be set. 
---
But but I was a mad bomber man who could legitimately destroy an area with grenades....now it just doesn't do much anymore.....in all seriousness tho grenades got hurt real bad by this patch.....
---
Yep
---
Loool well that wasted 10 min. You on ps?
---
I really don‚Äôt understand the ardent downvoting of anything negative or critical of this game.
---
You haven‚Äôt just insulted Bethesda or called Todd Howard a poorly conceived rude nickname..
---
I actually appreciated reading your post since it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve discovered myself. Taking time out from the game and then returning should feel good, but nothing is being changed and I still feel that it‚Äôs a real struggle to spend a significant amount of time or energy on this game with the glitches, bugs and crashes.
---
I‚Äôm sorry that anonymous people are downvoting your post without even commenting a reasonable reply, but I personally agree with a lot of what you‚Äôve said, and you have the right to say it
---
Respects Paid.
---
Thanks for the response. Appreciate it!
---
Look forward to hearing from you guys soon :)
---
So that's what was going on with my dt üôÉ
---
Once found a trash bin at a red rocket in the beginner town full of stuff from ammo to materials, made my experience sooo much better. Wish i could have found whoever did it thou
---
I haven't found one yet so can I ask, have they given us the 50.cal mod for hunting rifle yet, or am I just unlucky? 
---
nope, PC
---
No, it's on Fyre yo!
---
Ain't that the truth. But that tends to happen when people who wouldn't normally have any sort of power irl suddenly get a lot of it thanks to the internet.
---
He‚Äôs got my vote.
---
What else is she supposed to do? Don't get mad at the people trying to help us. 
---
I have a 3 star pipe bolt action rifle, with 2 shot you rarely do full damage at long range, maybe 25% or less. It's pretty useless.
---
I also have spent thousands of hours in Fallout and Elder Scrolls and feel this game just outright dropped the ball trying to jump on the PvP bandwagon that seems to be taking the industry over. If they had stuck to the tried and true formula of the other iterations this would have rocked as a game. The whole idea of a PvP in fallout with a story asking us to team up and rebuild the "wasteland" of West Virginia is ludicrous. All they managed to do is get the most toxic version of gamers into the game.
---
Quit
---
Bethesda's go to responses, Soon and Hope.
---
Pretty sure they are the most used words in and around there development office as well :/
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
We've been spoon feeding them fixes and they are ignoring us..  
---
People are literally tagging them  multiple times, and they are ignoring it.  
---
**Example:**  
---
I had that initially, but felt like the switchblade with +40% swing speed was enough already. Barbarian gives me that extra DR/ER to compete with PA and not wearing it.
---
Still looking for a bit of survivability in the build.
---
Wow I dont even need to answer that! 
---
I'm no expert and I haven't crunched any numbers, but I would say that Martial Artist is freakin' hilarious when you have a tiny knife.  I would consider it over Rank 3 in all the Gladiators.  If you take the first rank of each, you get 30% for 3 points.  Taking them all only yields 60%, but costs 9 SPECIAL points.
---
Granted, I use an Instigating Combat Knife, but I drop most things in 1 hit with only one of each Gladiator.  If it is still alive, it is subjected to my rapid stabbing until it isn't.
---
See you on the next Fallout... maybe. This one is sinking so hard that nothing can save it anymore. Next time when Bethesda is advertising some new game people will remember the difference with marketing hype and real product. If same people do new games nothing will change.
---
I wonder if rolling back the servers is even possible at this point.
---
I'm just not getting what's your point, dude :)
---
Patch Notes:
---
Power Armor enter/exit speed has been corrected to reflect the intended 15 second delay. 
---
What about the fact that my lvl 5 tse pump action does base damage of 97 and with demo expert ranked up fully with 5 perk points it does 107 damage? I have 5 SPECIAL points allocated to intelligence that are now useless. I‚Äôm lvl 40 so I can‚Äôt move points for ten level ups. I‚Äôm essentially handcuffed until then. 
---
[Yes](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JeXSM11kCuU)
---
What we are seeing isn't the Fallout community that I know.  The community I know is united in their love of the franchise and the rich universe that has been built.  
---
Some might call me a filthy casual because I enjoy the world and the lore more than I enjoy the combat and if that's the case then I will wear that label with pride.
---
"To the Level X guy in Y who did Z thing..."
---
The devs already said it was a fuck up and unintentional.
---
Id be happy if EA purchased it from them at this point :(
---
I get what you're saying but with how the game is I feel like it would be much better for those items, especially items directly from FO4, to just be added to the base game of FO76. It would give them some much needed good PR and fill out some areas that have little to no rewards and generally make exploring more rewarding including for people that have already explored the map and need something new to go after. With the state of the game it's not good looks to be adding FO4 items and reskins to the atom shop.
---
You cant leave the server or if another player buys it
---
Barbarian is okay, but the faster swing speed will make you a lot better, trust me
---
This is some bullshit... I don't care if other people believe you or not, but getting banned in 76 shouldn't mean not being able to play your other offline games tied to your Bethesda account. They just seem to keep repetitively shooting themselves in the foot with this game... leaving you on read without any sort of reply or warning to disabling your account is terrible and it reflects on their interaction with fans.  
---
Now I will probably never see you and everyone do Hunter/Hunted with pipe pistols and leather armor... D:
---
What if every whiny bitch needed to write something like this every time they decided they didn‚Äôt like their current hobby.
---
Now imagine if they did it outside of the establishment of that chosen hobby while everyone else is still inside enjoying that hobby.
---
Nobody would give a shit what that person is saying.
---
Dump your unsellable unconvertable ammo, guns you don't need to scrap or sell, and so on right back there.  That's what I've been doing.  
---
Can I have multiple mutations at once?
---
&gt;  I also did take items left in paper bags by dupers as I raided a few of their camps but I never duped myself
---
You probably would've been better off leaving that detail out of your explanation. You basically admitted you knew the camps were dupers, but took advantage of them exploiting the system anyway which makes you an accomplice after the fact.  Kind of like telling a cop, well yeah I knew the money was stolen, but I wasn't the one who robbed the bank.
---
Please tell me the damage bug is also going to be fixed? I reported it a few hours after the patch and a CM said it would be passed on. It's not concrete proof but I did catch a screenshot that [kind of shows it](https://imgur.com/teL9MHX). I have a quad automatic tesla rifle, so that mutant tanked over 5000 damage and just recovered it all back. The screen was also taken just yesterday since that's when I had to update the loadout mod to the new 1.6 version that shows up on HUD (I never bothered updating beforehand, but a different mod I had was making me unable to trade with vendors after yesterday's patch so I also updated the mod as part of troubleshooting)
---
Is the switchblade really the best damage to speed weapon?
---
Thank you for saying it. I'm getting really tired of this sub because of all the complaints. 
---
The door closes on its own
---
Not sure if it's just me but my VATS are not targeting correctly. When I aim for the head it selects the arm. Also regardless at 95% and perked the damn shots miss 4/5 times.
---
May I ask why are u collecting candy?
---
Hmm, I feel like I‚Äôm going to loot a note that gives me a quest if I search that toolbox...
---
May I add I am so happy to hear there are other snipers like me enjoying this game, I know it has it's faults but I still love it. If anyone is on playstation and wants a stealth partner (mic or no mic is fine) my psn is Thundershunt. Hope to survive the wasteland with you! 
---
Jesus Christ another bitch bites the dust.

Server stability seems worse again as well, also had multiple freezes when loading in.
---
Then there are the small things, vendorbot  phoenix missing, found him in a nearby building with broken pathfinding. When reading plans not getting a notificiation what (if?) you have learned. Lag when killing mobs (taking several seconds before dmg registers.
---
Bought it from a vendor bot in Sunnytop Station, but apparently it's an illegal item that was exploited and needed to be removed because it gave +100 Perception and Ability to Look Really Awesome and it had to be removed because it was unfair to other players who felt victimized by it's presence. Just kidding, it was a worthless item that looked cool but it shouldn't be in the game because they forgot to add it.
---
Not sure I agree with your absolute view on this, I trade a fair bit on the trading subreddits and discord. **In-game** economy definitely  is, but that‚Äôs precisely why it needs corrective action, first and foremost to make the currency useful for **something**. I‚Äôm not saying what they‚Äôve done is enough. But that‚Äôs the right direction. 
---
Lol ok. Stayed in the vault since beta then?  
---
Weird. In my industry QA/QC has ALL the power and clout. If the work is sub-par, the job isn't finished or released. That not being the case in software development would answer some of the questions I've had.
---
I‚Äôm a die hard Fallout fan but at the same time I refuse to make myself play this game when it‚Äôs obviously not an enjoyable experience, because it‚Äôs supposedly my duty as a Fallout fan. Bethesda clearly didn‚Äôt put a lot of effort into making it so why should I as a fan? 
---
It didn‚Äôt for me
---
FYI, they nerfed this event.....
---
If you're talking about the words top left corner saying cannonball removed, you aren't losing anything actually. It's the game script appearing on screen at a checkpoint. You used the cannonballs that it is "removing". If its something else, I don't know how to help. 
---
To everyone that responded to me - thank YOU. So you know, in my report to the team I did confirm that this is an issue on all platforms - PC, Xbox One and PS4 were all mentioned in the responses.
---
Noticed that as well. Constantly in Caution or danger mode. Also I can often hear the movements of mobs as if the are standing next to me but the closest mob is a 30 sec run away.
---
Haha this. I tamed a level 91 deathclaw at level 130 like two weeks before Christmas and I've still seen people say every day you need to be double  a tames level.
---
I can't put in 200+ hours and bash on the game.  I more than got my money's worth out of it. 
---
Unfortunately, after I hit 100 and platinum, I'm done.
---
No it isn't sorry to those that got them legit but they are like 1 in 100 the other 99 have dups all of which are OP

From what I‚Äôve seen, it out damages both the Bowie and combat knives while being faster.

I just don't know what you're bitching about. Have you EVER seen a cannon from the 17th century that lasted if you didn't throw a constant stream of random garbage at it? Jesus, man. Get real. It takes aluminum, duct tape, and springs to repair an all cast iron cannon after 20 shots.

Watoga robots are attacking again after current patch. I already did the Mayor's quest in full some time ago. They were not attacking me before the patch.  I did not shoot at any of them to cause aggro. Please look into this. I have not created a ticket yet.
---
Copy that. 
---
Luck 5 so you can have starched genes and class freak. Then you can load up on mutatuons that up your strength and damage.
---
Those have been duped since the first dupe exploits were circulated. There's nothing new there. The only recent dupe craze was bloodied+explosive ranged weapons, which are selling for $10-30 per on pay to win sites like G2G and U4GM.
---
The better way to go about this is to buff up situational legendaries. Make it so exterminators/zealots/hunters do more damage than furious tops out at. Make it so furious goes up to 50% buff or make it so subsequent shots/strikes increase rate of fire/attack. If you make more legendary effects viable by BUFFING instead of NERFING, then the pay to win market will die down. 
---
PS4, same issue.

I feel your pain but realistically you're probably in the minority. Honestly I think they should just make a weekly cap. That way everyone can get their shit done even if they play one day a week. 
---
Ok thanks. 
---
If I got banned for duping this is exactly what my Reddit post would look like. Just sayin üòÇ
---
After posting this here, I was informed of a thread and effort made by a player for players on Atomic Store updates. Link here: [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/317871/atomic-shop-updates-29th-january-2019?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=1](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/317871/atomic-shop-updates-29th-january-2019?language%5B%5D=en&amp;page=1)
---
I had a friend over who has Epilepsy and they almost had a fit in the bunker as I was playing because the lights tend to be very unstable in there, mostly the military wing where all the desks are, the flickering even gave me a headache.
---
heh, I was just trying to see how many people i could get to go reread the hot fix announcement :^)
---
Yeah. Was planning to include twisted muscles in this build as well.
---
TIL I'm not a true fan because I identified that this game had issues and, judging by Bethesda's previous actions, determined that they would never be fixed.
---
You get that's because that's what shes paid to do yes?
---
its not meant to be a card to buff the explosive legendary mod, its for explosives like grenades, fatman and all that. The little buff it adds to explosive weapons is just gravy and tbh explosive weapon is still arguably the best second star effect everyone needs to chill   
---
Its like every 20-22 hours, not 12.
---
It would be written in a generic style likely by a unpaid intern. Lots of word without saying or promising anything.
---
Kinda like when a politican speaks.
---
Losing cannonballs at random on my repeating Broadsider since the new patch.  Probably because the game thinks I am using the unmodded version, and instead of pulling the weapon out with a full clip of x3 ammo, it magically has 1/3 magazine cannonballs loaded resulting in constantly losing x2 canonnballs on thin air. The weapon also breaks at about 10 shots, buff durability, and damage, please. Same applies for missile launchers, no meaningful damage to ammo weigh ratio, extremely fast weapon breakage. Also an issue plaguing most heavy high RoF weapons.
---
Platform? I‚Äôve pretty much got the wiring down to an art. 
---
I haven't actually played the game since before Christmas now. I haven't completed the actual story yet.
---
I got bored. I got a taste of what the end game was and didn't like it. I don't much enjoy going to nuke zones and just spamming feral ghouls over and over again in the hopes of a good drop for no reason.
---
It needs more interesting content. It needs a good end game. A good end game dungeon. It needs more interesting repeatable side quests.
---
It needs more interesting stuff aside from that. Im thinking the side content that's in Camden park but times 10. 
---
Also, that sounds very frustrating. And I really like your style by working thw broadsider.
---
This game was DOA, respect to those still trying to play it. 
---
Got my original beta character to level 86 and another character to level 34 so no.
---
Can I just say your state and your culture is the best part of this game
---
Do it, no seriously, I did, I enjoyed the time-killer that it was, but I could not contribute to the numbers that could make them think this situation is ok. I uninstalled because I wanted to be counted as lost engagement, it's the only metric that matters to some of the people involved. It also felt bad that I was playing a poorly designed game by a dev who didn't care enough to do it properly when I could have been lovingly crafted games I already own made by devs who deserve my time.
---
Totally agree Kyoshi, still wanna do that leather armor hunter/hunted... \*sigh\*  Ok.. I'm just gonna have to buy matthew a new account when payday hits... Fuck Bethesda.
---
I pre-ordered 76 while I was tromping through fo4.  Was eating fallout content but then I started playing 76. It was one frustrating boss fight at level 26 or so that made me drop off it. I started playing red dead which I thought was even worst!! 
---
Let it all go for Arma 3!!! 
---
Now y'all are making me want to try this with the Furious Switchblade I found last night.
---
Never...because when they fix one 10 more bugs emerge...
---
No actually. 
---
I'm a stealth player and after yesterdays patch I'm constantly in "caution" mode, even after fast travelling or clearing mobs. 
---
Ok thanks it was good on exp as well but oh well...
---
As upset as I am with this previous patch, and admittedly I am taking a break from the game due to that, I truly appreciate u/lonevaultwonderer and all the other community managers busting their asses to get issues reported to the devs. You guys rock, keep doing what you do üëç
---
Bethesda doing there best to patch it towards the worst game ever though right :)
---
As i said give it a go during the open beta this weekend and decide after gameplay.
---
I... wat, I soloed a nuke silo at level 50 easily with no legendary weapons. So, you guys got carried and didn't like it when he decided to  flex his alpha status.
---
That's the spirit of a raider!
---
It was in 3. But that made sense in a game where there were a fixed number of mini nukes. You could only ever fire it so many times, without mods. 
---
Xbox but I think I've got it noe
---
Happy to see the official post. The outrage in this sub was frighteningly well... outrageous. I‚Äôm behind you and can‚Äôt wait. 
---
Indeed! 
---
fixed later.....2 and a bit years later!
---
It's my defeatist attitude from plasma and now regular weapons nerfed to uselessness.
---
Could I buy it?
---
No I know what you are talking about, but this is as real as it gets. I wouldn't be able to double confirm this if I didn't have my Broadsider somehow outlive the 21 crafted ammo and still have 50% durability remaining. I noticed the bug after 10 mins of playing the new patch. Instead of pulling the cannon out with 3 bullets (I made sure I had all 3 cannonballs loaded) it randomly had 1/3 effectively making 2 cannonballs disappear in thin air occasionally.
---
Any updates on this issue? I have a Gauss rifle I want to mod up, but I'm kinda clueless if I can trust anything the stats on the Gauss rifle are indicating, because there seem to be inconsistencies in several of the mod descriptions vs. what stats change.
---
Lol ty for fixing what you shouldn‚Äôt have broken in the first place 
---
Don't get the 2k rewards.  Also, its part of the event and doesn't take alot of effort.  
---
Also Fallout 76 costs 50 bucks more then Fallout 2, which to those not in the know, is awesome.
---
A couple black cats can be found in the woods line around flatwoods.  Near the truck with the dogs right before the hotel.  I‚Äôd search that whole area.  Cats, dogs, and frogs..  
---
Thats what i thought too until i tried it. It is so much more than that. Try it yourself this weekend, theres an ooen beta starting friday
---
See, that's where you're wrong in your thought. You assume the player base is just tired of the game. The player base is *actually* tired of the broken game and broken mechanics, along with the gross monetization. They would play the hell out of this game like any diehard fan already is, had it not been for the shit experience with bugs and all. They want this game, the right way.
---
Where would you suggest spending those extra points? I‚Äôd give 2 to INT to grab Makeshift Warrior to keep the durability manageable. Still leave me with 4 to put in somewhere that I can‚Äôt see any place for them as PER is fairly unusable for melee and LCK is the same, mostly Vats and that kills the speed.
---
These spawn randomly just north of Flatwoods just off the road next to the Green Lodge building or whatever it's called.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs clear you enjoy being a greifer but he talked about slap damage not what‚Äôs happening with destroyed CAMP. Very different from his E3 announcement. Also here he clearly states that it wasn‚Äôt intended to be greifie. Right now it clearly is and needs to be balanced. 
---
http://youtu.be/plyueybHWm8
---
Confederate hat plan? I need to see a picture myself.
---
I wander if the map can have a list of who is on the server, and a short list of their haves and wants, so you can chase them up but not consume their time and attention if you there‚Äôs nothing meaningful to discuss. 
---
I've seen a few comments to that extent, I've never used it because I was completely underwhelmed with Lucky Break (same idea but for armor). I'll give it a try, thanks!
---
Yeah, same as the OP.
---
Ok will give that a try thanks.
---
Yup I specifically mentioned that issue about always being in caution
---
Hot fix has arrived. Play Fallout New Vegas in a chat with your bros.
---
Yesterday I found a dismembered ghoul corpse on the floor of one of the Whitespring houses, was that made passive walking/breathing noises and blocked my path like it was still alive and standing upright. And its empty loot contents showed when I pointed my crosshairs straight forward at the invisible mass instead of down at the body parts.
---
Yeah! I consider it my payment for them not cooperating. Or the tax for not working with me. Either way.
---
Thank you. You saved me a lot of time writing this exact post. All I wanted was a damn Special reset or even like 10 points to respec since we have to do it AGAIN. My new endgame is stalking the forums and trying to fix the damn game myself.
---
Not yet! But let me know if you find a better place with people that have actually attempted to read Bethesda's responses and don't feel entitled to have everything their way RIGHT THIS INSTANT. I am just unsubscribing from this subreddit because it is full of toxic trash. Hopefully someone will make a better one!
---
The next patch is what a lot of people are saying, you know, to bring it in line with all the other nerfed shite.
---
By stealing dupers source material (The bags in the duper camps) he is actually saying he actively was interfering with duping, helping the community.  By taking these items, we were setting the dupers back hours, if not days of effort. We have footage of this on his twitch stream. 
---
Stealing the source material would be like snatching carrots before they get put into a stew, there is nothing wrong with that. (unless you're the disgruntled cook who wanted to use them)  
---
&gt; Kind of like telling a cop, well yeah I knew the money was stolen, but I wasn't the one who robbed the bank 
---
Um no, there is no way to determine weather the items in the bags were source or duplicated. However if they were on the ground in the first place, they're most likely source due to the way dupers operate. 
---
Name it Lil' Stabby and become a stabber of doom
---
Yeah, cant remember the companies name before they acquired them but they were experts apparently at micro transaction games hence the reason why Bethesda went out of there way to buy them.
---
Game designers have spreadsheets to figure this out, seems like they finally found the spreadsheet. Must have lost it all this time?
---
The community rep only *just now* forwarded this info to the devs. We have only been letting them know since day 1 of the beta.
---
What a fucking joke of a company.
---
I hope they never touch another multiplayer game again and just stick to single player worlds.
---
They have discussed player vending being added to the game, HOW it would work idfk but hey TRADE BOARDS are a pretty common staple of MMOs 
---
Didn't noticed tbh
---
Did you even read the post? He showed up on the last part and his contribution was minimum.
---
But that's not event the reason of my choice: it's the combination of all those factors I listed that were too much.
---
I'm certain you've probably already tried, but doesn't the dispenser at the mansion have them in a list? It's been a while since I did this quest line, so my recall is not entirely true. Old age and all that junk. Lol
---
Known or not you should upvote every comment about an issue to make sure it gets the attention it needs, the more that are noticed the more they will see it's a large problem and not just a minor inconvenience to one or two players.
---
Multiple people working on multiple branches can easily cause this, if not managed properly. Example:
---
1. Dev #1 cuts branch A  
---
2. Dev #2 cuts branch B  
---
3. Dev #1 finishes branch A and merges to trunk.   
---
4. QA or whoever cuts a release branch including various recent trunk merges, and that is used to push out patch 1.1  
---
5. Dev #2 doesn't update from trunk, so branch B doesn't contain branch A changes, but they continue work on branch B  
---
6. Dev #2 merges branch B to trunk which accidentally reverts branch A changes.   
---
7. QA again cuts a new release branch to include changes since 1.1, and push out patch 1.2. But because of Dev #2s mistake, the 1.2 patch is missing some or all of the 1.1 patch changes, and is effectively based on an earlier build.
---
Ah 
---
I don't understand why people do that
---
I have a few friends that do the same and I just don't get it
---
So that's why my carry weight various by so much randomly
---
I'm upset at the fact that he/she is commenting like it is something new. 
---
Responding to any of the other half-dozen posts would have been more timely.
---
Yeah similar for me. Sneak is almost OP for me on PvE until I get discovered and the mob just tears through me.
---
Love my sneak build. Will probably test the theory later this week when I go legendary farming again.
---
Slow and painful, just the way Todd likes it ; )
---
Thanks B.
---
I can't tell if you are sarcastic or not, gonna go with sarcastic just cause of that emote. Jokes aside though... why are the black powder weapons excluding the dragon so durable then? Come on give this magical weapon some love why does everything in this game have to be trash other than 5 - 6 weapons.
---
I heavily agree.....no more resources should be going to this
---
Bethesda shit the bed. Again.
---
Others here have said it, but TS has major accuracy loss so the bullets just shoot off at random angles. You can't do a TS vats build end of story. You also cant do TS/instigator or TS/bloodied because they're both primary affixes. Legendary weapon (currently) have 3 categories of affixes, primary major and minor. [This](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) website has all the different modifiers for each category and will help you figure out the best combos you can get for your guns.
---
Next patch, probably:
---
&gt;Ultracite helm, torso, left/right arm, and left/right leg plans removed from SBQ loot table, which will now drop Ultracite explosive vent 100% of the time.
---
They did that as a measure to combat events that were being exploited. It was the same patch that fixed the battle bot event exploit.
---
It's simple. Bethesda doesn't give a shit about the state of the game, so long as they can keep making money through the Atom Store because their fanboys think their shit doesn't stink and will happily throw more money at them. It seems to be working for them. You have to pay to get the weekly buff this week after all.
---
It's one of the many, many bugs we've been reporting since the beta they've not fixed yet.
---
She only **just today** let the devs know about how shitty energy weapons are in game. She deserves no praise. This shit is woefully unexeceptable.
---
In theory QA was playing this build the patch is on and it went fine. Then the team that is in charge of code commits, merging branches, and deployment most likely ran into an error and it wasn't caught. Which is why they are working on a hotfix, because they know they goofed. 
---
And as a little aside. No one (developing) usually likes Hotfixes. They tend to be "rushed" (less time for all aspects, coding, QA, etc) and can cause unforeseen issues with the code elsewhere. Mileage will vary on the company and their stance to these fixes.
---
QA did test the changes that we got and in their build, more likely then not it was fine/stable/couldn't still reproduce the bug(s). Or tested to see that the changes to perk cards were correct that each team was assigned to review.
---
But once QA gives the thumbs up on an item they were working on they move on to the next part and it's up to the deployment team to ship it out. 
---
At my work QA and devs are working in a lot of different branches at the same time and I've seen notes on how code X was reverted by code Y or devs working on similar issues might be dealing with teh same code and not aware of it.
---
While QA are on "teams" you're usually solo during your testing (depending on the case).
---
I ALWAYS find a pack of foxes at the barbecue shack.
---
You commented literally seconds after I posted this, which means you didn't even read it. You wouldn't give me a minute of your time, therefore I won't give you my stuff.
---
Or show the damn pieces on the armor 
---
pfft... If YOU were real tse user YOU know we don‚Äôt die at all because we were smart enough to use adamantium skele &amp; or strengthened limb mods, fire proof and a dense mod as so we don‚Äôt ever die like complete fucking amateurs. This might be the most uninformed thing I‚Äôve read today.
---
You were never promised that PvP would be optional.
---
Agreed, though you have to tweak such a system
---
Slightly because this isn‚Äôt an MMO with 200 or 2000 players sharing a server instance (and a
---
Trade board). 
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/68353656
---
Yay for uninstall buddies!!
---
Replaying the story missions? Not much, unless they create a playlist with different brackets of difficulty for better rewards. Even then the story missions and game world dont seem like they would support that very well.
---
The game in general has a ton of potential for replayability. The map is huge and has a ton of really cool features and set pieces. But mostly people only return to areas to visit vendors. I think too much of the map is far too easily accessible and gives you no reason to think twice about it. Without going too far into it, there should be places even players in the hundreds of levels get chills up their spins when they think about visiting. Where radiation is always as high as a nuke zone, enemies spawn over level 100, etc. 
---
I think they also gave us access to all the power armors too quickly, and there's not enough difference between the models. We should have been stuck with t-45 and raider power armor for much longer, and playing the game in t-45 vs. X-01 should feel massively different. That first time you climb into t-51 should have felt like getting into a Cadillac and only gotten better with better models. If only for the sake of this game being an mmo and giving you more reasons to come back. 
---
They had tons of options to slow down progression, and make it more meaningful. We should have been stuck with pipe weapons and shit melee weapons until level 50. At level 121 i should be looking back fondly of my early days trying to max out a build for pipe weapons right before the glory of a 10mm was available to me with its increased durability, damage, and rate of fire. They could have always made pipe weapons relevant again for higher levels down the road with a special prefix and level requirement. 
---
The bones are there for a great mmo with tons of replayability. They are hindered by not knowing how to make good use of what they have for an mmo. And sadly much worse, they don't have a stable game to build on, and seem to stumble over themselves every time they attempt to stabilize it.
---
Just posted in another thread about this same thing... I've got the stealth bug too.  Not only do I appear to be much easier to spot, but once I hit Caution or Danger I just... stay there.  Fast travel to my camp, run to empty areas, doesn't matter, I'm still in Danger.  This character is a stealth build, so I rely on the 2.5x damage increase and headshots, so it sucks that I can't actually hide.  Server hopping seems to clear it up temporarily.
---
Ah ok. Might of just been a coincidence for me then
---
While you're at it check the perk cards and TSE percentages. They aren't calculating properly. It seems to happen when a gun has both two shot and exploding bullets as my just two shot shot gun seems to have the proper damage except from the cards. Example below:
---
TSE pump hardened shotgun. Base damage with no cards attached for damage buffs at all 189. 
---
Base damage on a non TSE hardened pump action level 50 is 157. 
---
Two shot is supposed to be 25% and explosive bullets 20%. That's 45% on top of 157 with ads up to 228. That's not happening. It's as if the two shot and the exploding bullets cancel each other out. 
---
Also, 3 maxed shotgun cards is 60% and a maxed demolition expert is 60%. So 120% of base damage which was 157. That adds up to 345. 
---
When you combine the 25%, 20% , 60% and 60% it's supposed to be a total of 165% of base damage or in this case it should all add up to 487 total damage. 
---
But in reality when you add all cards and have the TSE bonuses now it's only netting 292. 
---
They should have kept it how it was and just nerfed the exp from the event, not make it a harder event to find. I kinda enjoyed running around collecting candy and killed all the enemies, and collecting alot of chem supplys.
---
We should be friends. But we can only play fo76.
---
I signed in an accepted the friend request, but was showing you offline, still is.  Just look for me whenever you get on and hit me up.  No rush, I'll have those plans for you plus a few others if you want them.  See you in the wasteland
---
Yes, not think about that and then compare them to FO76. 
---
Compared to FO76, FO4 is *dense*. 
---
Duping is back and there's a new "best gun type" available that people are selling on eBay. I know you're trying to look on the bright side and justify what's happening, but this hasn't fixed anything on the exploit end. It's just created a new market for them to fill.
---
Is this the list that was promised for us that you're "still working on" because you keep adding more bugs than you fix?
---
lol
---
Is your brass monkey frozen? It might be because of that.
---
Porque los programadores no piensan. 
---
You Sir are EXACTLY what's wrong with the community!
---
If they weren't, I would do my duty and explain it to them.
---
:(
---
That's just a server stress test. Real betas (and alphas) are done well in advance of launch so they can actually fix/change stuff based on the feedback. FO76 beta was nothing of the sort. They knew they were shipping a broken, unfinished game and did the "beta" to check the servers under load, which also didn't do them any good. They bamboozled us all real good.
---
Relax my dude. It‚Äôs not the best for sure but I enjoy it. No need to attack those who play 
---
they should also stop Phoenix from being attacked, I'm getting tired of wasting ammo on robots there just to make a trade every day.
---
Correct.
---
Man I really have never felt more robbed of my money than this game. I'll still hold onto hope I guess. Thanks for the update 
---
Don't have to worry about blowing yourself anymore anyway. This is a two shot btw https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/eternalscourge/video/68353656
---
It's 2019, anything and anyone can become a meme, what was your point? Lol.
---
Bethesda didn't release much last year besides Fallout 76.  This is especially noticeable if you compare it to their line-ups in 2016 and 2017.  My guess is they felt they needed to have *something* on the shelves for the holidays, and they misjudged both the market and the expectations that players had for it.  I'm not even sure *they* knew what their expectations were.
---
And the thing is, and you've put in the time so you know, we all acknowledge that there's something amazing buried in this game.  We see it surface from time to time in player interactions, neat CAMPs, the organic unscripted nature of the world, and the relatively dark and cynical storyline behind it.  It's just that Bethesda is doing their damnedest to bury it even more and, indirectly, make us all look stupid for giving them the benefit of the doubt.  That's the part I don't like.  There comes a point when you feel like you're the one being played, and I think with Patch 5, we reached that point.
---
You can't imagine someone having a different opinion on what entertainment product is worth their money or not?
---
Seriously? are you stupid?
---
Equiping the Inspector outfit unequips under armors, please fix
---
Watoga. I actually got to check out the treasure trove of power armor plans from phoenix before all the bugs kicked in
---
Let me clarify. "The fallout community" you know the game I was talking about?
---
It's fine I understand your frustration. We both play fo76 after all :p ... and like I said I **had** a good weapon but yay for bugs. It got deleted one day when I crashed, I tried to log right back in like normal but when the game found a server it gave me an error code 4:7:0 then booted me back to main menu. This happened again on my next log in attempt. When I finally got back into the game I tried to shoot the mobs that spawned in next to me, only to find out my gun was gone. I got a shitty replacement, but my joy in playing the game and spending hours and hours farming up decent weapons was gone. Knowing any of my progress could be deleted at any moment by a bug and knowing bethesda told me to go fuck myself about it really sapped my desire to play this rolling pile of garbage.
---
I bought the game at 1220am on the day it was released because the store I went to first didnt receive the shipment (tho I worked there at the time and know for a fact we got ps4 copies and not xbox one ones. I unloaded them off the truck, sorted them, and placed them in lockup for the guy who said we didnt have any copies). I didnt get to start playing it until maybe 130am because it took a while to update. So initially, I was confused by the leveling system. I got used to it after a while, but it wasnt really explained very well and I had no idea which SPECIAL perk to level so I could make better weapons. 
---
Secondly,  the world felt too empty. Youd think that youd run into the overseer or an official from the vault, but no... just robots and holotapes. At least one person that you can latch onto and build a relationship with. The players never wanted to play in groups and everyone I know plays on xbox. So the online aspect was shut down quick. I know that it's meant to feel empty, but cmon... 
---
Thirdly, the quests. Took me 5 hours to find a server with Evan still alive several hours after launch. This was before gamestop opened and before most people got out of bed. And it was before most people (post beta tests) ever knew about the bug. And the quests also feel empty... their delivered through holotapes qnd some of them arent even voiced. So I'm sitting here trying to figure out why I needed to shoot this and that because a holotape said something about something else entirely. It was a bit confusing so I focused more on building up my camp... 
---
Which leads us into my 4th problem. I went along the main questline thinking that I would learn how to use the camp doing that like any other game would do. But it was a side quest that I didnt even know that i had gotten. I had to Google it to find out that there was a questline associated with it because i only ever got updates for the main questline and the dailys. 
---
I could go on about how low level quests take you to a level 50 scorchbeast or about how this was glitched or you could exit your armor, but those were the biggest problems I faced and those are the reasons i stopped playing not even 2 weeks after launch.
---
well this patch seems to be a rollback with nerfs, some suspect they built the update on an older version then the last and that's why so many bugs are in game again, including a number of the dupes if the info is correct from the community. 
---
Yeah I agree. It definitely helps. A game has to be really damn good for me to play constantly for months on end. This game is far from perfect but giving up 2 months in I just don't understand
---
I consider it an $80 investment towards the possibility of co-op in TESVI and beyond.
---
I was out in the woods fighting this enormous fire that some punks set. While fighting said fire one of my buddies texted me saying the patch released. I quickly dropped my fire axe and hose and went home. By the time I had the game loaded up the fire was quickly growing and headed my way. I played the game for a bit realizing how shitty the new patch was. By this time the fire had made it to my backyard. I quickly grabbed my FO76 game disc and tossed it in the fire. It was a huge celebration and I pounded a beer. This damn game will no longer piss me off. Then I went and put out the forest fire. I am now the town hero. Kojima Productions even got word and they are letting me beta test Death Stranding.
---
Ooh, So the people over at /r/ fallout. Ok.
---
If you play solo does that mean other players don't exist on the server? No. If you play PvE does that mean PvPers don't exist on the server? No.
---
You can choose to ignore getting involved in PvP but they *specifically said* in both that interview and later ones that they want the drama and danger to be there.
---
As Waffle\_Cop put it, if the ban is justified or not, losing access to paid-for OFFLINE games due to an ONLINE game ban that's a DIFFERENT product(game) is wack.
---
Honestly, doesn't any of you actually play the game? This behaviour has been introduced with the previous patch, and I think the team will tell you it is not a bug, but an intended feature. The bug is that they simply forgot to make the slider wrap around the other way, too.
---
And fixing it would take no more than two lines of code (mostly copy/pasted and adapted from the moveSliderLeft() method. No, that's not its actual name).
---
I agree that the game ia poorly rated but I think more people are actually enjoying the game than not. I know I am and am happy with the nerf ans I had a tse. 
---
It's from literally copy/pasting fallout 4.
---
Ironically, TSE weapons were so overpowered that when they nerfed them to normal levels all other TS or just E weapons became total shite, meaning they are still the most powerful.
---
It's everyone without one that suffered....
---
Discounting Melee of course.....

So QA's build that they tested worked fine, even though it was probably tested solo and then before it shipped to us some dev changed something that unfortunately broke pretty much everything that QA had tested? Find it very hard to believe that it worked fine when at QA though, maybe one or two of these bugs didn't rear there head, but simple stuff like bobby pin weight? really?
---
And yet its going to take a week or so to get that put right and retested and shipped out? 
---
Also whats wrong with there CM's going it no a little detail like you just did, instead of reverting to generic cut and paste responses about passing the info on again. An apology and a little transparency would help them out don't you think?
---
I see things exactly as you do. But this week, having worked as a developer myself, when I heard that they accidentally rolled back some of their prior fixes... that took me aback. That's clear evidence of inattention to detail, which probably happened when a dev checked their changes into source control (for inclusion in the official build) without being careful. Or sometime similar - but whatever happened, bad bad bad. Really bad. That said I still love the game and am still waiting patiently for more content and fixes.
---
WV Lumber Co., kill all the super mutants, leave one or 2 and server hop. u can sweep the place in 2 minutes if yr gone is strong enough. inuse hunting rifle with all the mods focusing on damage (not crit dmg). sometimes when u hop it will double the number of mutants, i think because the game recognizes your session twice somehow. you have to move quickly, dont bother with the mutant in the basment of the large building. instarted this around level 35, it takes a bit to get up there but it works
---
I could make it deal over 300 dmg per shot with max demolitions expert pre patch and because it was two shot. I was also using grenadier with it for maximum explosive AoE. Pretty much wanted to make the most out of each shot since it broke so easily. Now it's butchered to oblivion, another wep for the dusty stash.
---
I looted a TS Fatman and kept it as I hope it becomes useful someday.
---
Honestly, the problem is that they keep pushing changes/updates for pvp, when most people got this, not cause 'mah pvp' but because it was billed as 'fallout you can play with your friends'.  Co-op/pve content really should be the focus imho.
---
Be a real cool thing if they put the X-01 mods in instead.
---
Not yet, but at this rate I might be in the near future.
---
Yeah I made light of a glitch that probably really hurt you, that was rude of me.  It's so hard to find something worth using nonstop in this game I know that would have really sucked.  I'll give the gatlings another try, I sold them after trying my first but it's been a while.
---
Be nice to have it all work properly since I'm running a non PA, max carry weight/dt build. I couldn't seem to get above 300 dt although I should be with my perks, and my carry weight never goes above 345, and will fluctuate all the way down to 285/290. But that could be from my armor breaking, I'm not sure
---
I don't think it's very hard to understand. Why don't you tell me: what are the chances of rolling dice twenty times and getting the exact same roll? I'd say that it's pretty damn low. 
---
And yet that is exactly how this game works with vendors and events. 
---
I have over 20 plans for motion assisted servos from the Distant thunder quest.  I have gotten one plan for one piece of t60 armor. There is nothing random about getting the exact same quest reward every time you complete a quest.
---
I feel you. I gathered all the key codes myself, as well as a nuke launch card.
---
I brought my buddy with me, and the progress bar for destroying the mainframe cores was stuck at about 20%, despite us going through and destroying *every single one*. We quit out.
---
We went back the next day, got to the part where you repair the mainframe cores, and it disconnected me. I got back in, and I was locked out behind the first laser grid. We said "Fuck this."
---
Keycodes expired that night.
---
We tried again 3 nights ago, just skipping the keycode part since people solve the launch code for you online. I successfully launched a nuke on the Scorchbeast Queen - we're hammering her, she gets to zero health, freezes mid-air and disconnects me. 
---
That was it for me!
---
You probably want makeshift warrior, starched genes, and serendipity. I'd drop bloody mess just because the damage return on point cost is really low. I'd drop perception down to 1 and ditch refractor. I'd ditch iron clad and barbarian as well. Maybe throw some points into agility to get dodgy instead. Damage reduction is always better than DR/ER. Collect up some armor pieces that reduce damage while sprinting and you'll be fine
---
Sounds like you met someone with sentinel gear. Seems the health bar lags between your client and theirs and you see more damage done than is actually done and the server corrects the health bar. This has also been in the game since beta but if you‚Äôre looking for a reason to quit I guess it‚Äôs as good as any.
---
Then apply? You're directing your anger at the wrong person. Telling the person that is trying to help us what to do makes them not what to help at all.
---
There we go!
---
I just want to know the developers thought process going forward. Why is everything such a big fucking secret? Give the players some hope for changes and content. Pvp servers? Who asked for this?
---
Even the atom shop has underwhelmed. They could be making a ton of money with cool camp pieces, new outfits,  gun and weapon reskins, but its like 2 or 3 things a week. I have a sweet lever action, let me buy a silver or gold skin for it! Nifty robot armor, give me a metallic paint job. Charge me 300 atoms. I would buy 10 things at 300 instead of twp for 1600. Add some giant deathclaws I can fight with my buddies. Let me fight waves of mutants and a giant boosted behemoth I need to recruit random players for. 
---
Is it really that difficult?? Good lord
---
i use maxed out Perception and Agility, but you can like get it where u want with yr own build. it‚Äôs gotta be one shot to kill or it takes too long. 
---
Psst the beta is what we continue to play. The secret is fallout 76 never went gold during development.
---
So, you‚Äôre telling me I shouldn‚Äôt play the game I spent money on, even though I‚Äôm clearly enjoying it?
---
Sure.
---
that's fine. If I were afraid of downvotes, I'd never write comments on reddit :)
---
Do you have the Radworms disease?
---
Or. Has 1 hour passed since you took the serum?
---
Well it's being done by BGS Austin for 1 
---
For 2 I'm not going to let a much needed nerf stop me from playing a game I like ... You can think I'm a terrible person that's fine .. I don't give a fuck what people IRL think why would I care what some screaming brats online think?
---
For 3 this isn't a normal FO/tes game, this is an online game where what happens and what's allowed are wildly different than a single player anything goes game... People running around with 10k+ weight was causing issues not only with the economy but with servers as well...I hate to see people go but if the vast VAST minority quit or need to massively drop their weight to play means the game doesn't crash left and right fine "sacrifice the few for the greater good" is what I say
---
TSE was nerfed too much. At level 56 it takes me 4 shots to kill a level 14 supermutant with an endgame weapon. I know I could still 1 shot things if I switched to a melee build, but I find melee boring and I don't want to re-spec again just to have melee nerfed because it's too strong. I liked this game, but this patch has made it too tedious to play.
---
do what you want but let us enjoy it for what it is....
---
saint Howard don't call me cause I can't gooooo
---
Will be playing till Anthem comes out, see what that's like.
---
For a lot of people at this point, making new characters from scratch is the only viable option they have because going from L1-50 is much easier than 100-150, or higher for that matter. The nerf to XP gain, nerf to event rewards, on top of the resource sinks that the game has become is utterly asinine. 
---
I already did that ‚Äî Four times (L250, L150, L107, L103, L85 chars) after my original mistakes on certain builds ‚Äî I‚Äôm not doing it again just to create more ‚Äúcontent‚Äù or longevity for this game.
---
They‚Äôre artificially making the game longer than it actually is because no new content will probably be coming until after March at the earliest by the looks of things. I‚Äôm not even going to touch the fact they changed Perk cards that are in almost everyone‚Äôs builds at this point without offering a respec or even telling the players that change was coming to begin with,
---
SBQ, quite literally the only piece of actual end game content to do right now outside of traditional gear farming, is not even worth doing now because they made the plans available for everyone who completed the quest line. I farmed SBQ dozens of times to get full sets of plans together to sell on marketplace and now you‚Äôre telling me they‚Äôre worthless after I dumped hours of my time soloing silos, killing the queen and farming repair materials and ammo supplies back. 
---
I‚Äôm reaching my breaking point as well.
---
I should quite literally go to the deepest fathoms in the game and drop them in a paper bag along with a phial of salt because that‚Äôs how I feel and how much they‚Äôre worth now.
---
Where are all my uninstalled friends at! We should have a party and dance on the corpse that is Fallout 76. 
---
You wanted us to rebuild? How about we use your bones as the infrastructure. I'm done. Game over. It wasn't worth winning. Where is the trophy? The cake is a lie. A bunch of 12 year old programmers could do better. This makes the Launch of New Vegas on consoles look amazing.. wow. Never buying a Bethesda product again. This is 3 games in a row they have failed on. Triple A company... in who's mind?? They have one title everyone talks about and they where it out on 3 generations of consoles.. All Hail Skyrim.. and that game wasnt even as good as Morrowind.. 
---
Sorry for venting but.., I find this entire experience to be a waste of life. I'm going outside and downloading pokemon go, catching the first thing I see and making it Bethesda. I'm never going to pay attention to it, I'm never going to water or feed it.. I'm just going to torture it by making it walk with me everywhere while I talk about how great it could have been.
---
SMH.
---
just checking i thought they would dupe everything already just like community feedback :).
---
I want to see a group kill the SBQ exclusively with explosive vent damage 
---
just checking i thought they would dupe everything already.
---
just like community feedback :).
---
I would be more likely to bet on plans the main quest gives you as guaranteed rewards.
---
Before leaving, how about giving us all your stuff and caps?  Thanks. 
---
GamerTag BellmanComp XB1.  
---
Hook a player up. 
---
Ah, sorry to hear that. :(
---
given the amount of wrecks, landslides, and nuclear waste, not really.
---
It was a joke....
---
I was arguing against the claim that White Knight's change wasn't a nerf even if it could be considered to be helpful balance wise it is still a nerf. In general most things need more durability though.
---
Glad you have insight to this. Hopefully it gets worked out in the end. I‚Äôm sure everyone who is a fallout or Bethesda fan would love nothing more than to see it succeed. 
---
It‚Äôs just been a trying time and lot harder process than both gamer and developer probably had in mind. 
---
If they do it right I can see this game growing and me playing it for years to come. 
---
Sad but true.
---
Douchebag Sean Murray had nothing else to do though, couldn't go out and spend his cash so hid at home and coded his little fingers to the bones after promising everyone the world and delivering pizza.
---
Bethesda will tank this shit show and try again to hype everyone up to cash in on the next title no doubt :(
---
Lol so over-the-top and cringe. My  "delicate sense abilities" what does that even mean? Anyway imma opt out cuz yknow "respek wahmen" and all that. I'll try to survive inside a foxhole while all of r/UpvotedBecauseGirl shows up and downvote spams me for the next 12 hours.
---
lol who said i had a point! 
---
Thank God ( I have to use my power armor just to fast travel now, as I'm such a hoarder! ) 
---
yea even tho its only a small team left they need to just put everyone on starfield. leave the game as it is not worth updating or putting new things in. even if its free to play nobody will play this crap just leave it alone send everyone to starfield
---
Disneyworld. Reading reddit and getting depressed at the happiest place on earth. Gonna go home in a few days to an empty social friend tab where it was filled with at least six or seven people at all times....and yet another fresh reason to try out a different game...
---
It's like the repo man coming to repo my unpaid 2018 Toyota, but also repo'ing my 1996 Toyota that's fully paid off and owned by me, just because it's a Subaru also, because screw this guy in particular.   
---
Meanwhile I paid my bill but they applied it to the wrong account due to a billing error. 
---
good thoughts and yeh i figured they would of duped everything just like community feedback :).
---
Yeah I've killed several in there.  I waited until they were on top of me before I started shooting so they wouldn't flop into that sleep position.
---
Thank you for the fast response! 
---
No i think its Bethesda's amazing awesome patches that's wrong with it tbh :)
---
I don‚Äôt enjoy the game if these are the changes we expect to see. 
---
Lol seems like they're still out here good for you man
---
Wowmuchtough is my psn. My buddy and I are on almost every night. His psn is utchia23
---
Factor in classic operant conditioning though, which means people will tend to play even more if they only get the reward sometimes, vs. having it guaranteed every time. But on the other hand, they will eventually give up if they consistently never get the reward.   
---
Kinda seems like someone is trying to give the reward at the lowest frequency that people will still continue to keep trying the event. Also because of RNG they can game it even further, because you (usually) will be guaranteed \*something\*, but there's still a pretty low chance it will be good or useful.
---
I will!
---
Depends.  I find it difficult to be pure melee in this game because of how infrequently Scorchbeasts land.  I kept a handful of points in PER to deal with Rifleman and Concentrated Fire, as well as Lockpick.
---
Given the whole White Knight debacle, I'm strong considering moving a PER over to AGI to give space for Rank 3 White Knight.
---
...I was repressing those painful memories of when they nerfed my freeze, whirlwind, nova...Ah crap, I forgot the acronym and what all my wizard did. 
---
I'm going to throw this comment in amongst the growing pile but it's important to voice protest.
---
I'm out, too. I thought they were going to patch fixes to egregious bugs first, while beginning to add content or at least start talking about the content they're going to add. They're now rebalancing the game and it just feels like, what's the point. Even mindlessly grinding to make the numbers go up feels pointless.
---
Do you happen to have more than one power armor suit you are carrying? I had the issue when carrying around another suit. As soon as i put it back in stash, the problem went away. Idk, maybe just coincedence.
---
sent chat message
---
Oh, and yeah, I did the same thing as OP. My mule has 4200 pounds of legitimate items I farmed myself and now I have to just drop them on the ground or make 30 characters to make use of them.
---
I wanted to make a meet up diner and a power armor garage with a side shop when vending became available but I guess that‚Äôs probably not going to happen now.
---
Lol I wouldn't have to look very far to find a reason to quit. I'm actually looking for a reason to keep playing. Lvl 147 I think I've given the gave a hell of a chance given its state
---
The comments here are hilarious. It's like you were all born yesterday and act like Bethesda is the only dev to ever do this.
---
Blizzard does this for years and nobody cares
---
We live in a society, buddy.
---
Yeah, same thing happening to me
---
yeah
---
It would be moronic of them to keep trying to add things and spend more money into it. its for sure a lost cause only people who are still playing it are the ones who spent 60$ and want to stay in denial
---
My springs got nerfed. My goddamn springs. I have no power armor. But I'm still in need of springs. I have no tse. I use a skill based sneak/vats crit 10mm build. My fucking springs got nerfed. I can't repair my non-legendary, self-built, suppressed 10mm pistol. 
---
Springs. There is one spring in an AK-47 IRL. It will last for fifty years if you clean it and treat it right.
---
My springs. A little oil, a little cleaning is all one needs. My springs got nerfed.
---
Fuck. This. Game.
---
Tears. Sad face. 
---
I get what you're saying, and it's absolutely mind blowing that they continue using the same engine. The owners of the studio must not be technical people. Maybe the games in development will be incredible and as engaging as Skyrim. However, Todd Howard's straight up lies when presenting fo76 don't give me hope that the studio will change its approach anytime soon unless he leaves the studio.
---
I do view the budget as a challenge though, and besides the 400 stash limit bthat we had at launch I haven't really been upset by it. Even Fortnite's creation mode has a budget. The budget forces you to find creative ways to achieve the function or look that you want your camp to have. By eliminating turrets at my camp I've been able to build more functional and nicer buildings. Although once I start using the terminal I'm sure the budget will run out real quick.
---
There is no point debating with you as you clearly enjoy being a greifer and don‚Äôt care about the rest who don‚Äôt want that. If Beth continues on this path then you will eventually have only other greifers for company. Enjoy 
---
Personally, I had a great few days playing Southpark The Fractured but Whole
---
then I came back to this mess =/
---
Hasn't even been that long of time didn't just come out in November ? It took other games much longer to make comebacks. I respect the decision but it definitely does seem a bit early. 
---
just join
---
PC is just using the mouse and dragging it.  (or at least that doesn't cause it to wrap for me compared to using arrow keys)
---
Chickens spawn sometimes around the Twin Lakes area. I have also seen a named tabby cat in the Ash Heap at a coffee shop type structure made of those rounded metal building parts from FO4.
---
I sure hell think so. Thought I don't think any game would/ or could, have any specific or even vague range of how many hours it should be playable. It also depends on person. Different players play differently.
---
I got about 28k games in WoT. Assuming average game is about 4 mins that's 77 full days.(actually its probably 5-6 mins but hours are not the point) I would count it better in years, I played it about 3 years, then gradually moved on to other games as I've found others. I occasionally login and play few games but in last 2 years I've played less than 100 games, so it's fair to say I'm not playing it at all anymore. I've played MWO for about 2 years, and slowed down quite a lot. Crossout 1+ year, stll playing it more than I've expected. I think without duping I would be highly more motivated to play Fallout 76 more and would not have so much time for Crossout or MWO. Out of these 2FP games I've paid most for WoT, maybe 30-40 euros. I enjoyed TES Skyrim about 2 years, maybe 3, I think Fallout 4 I played like 2+ years. The survival mode they introduced after first year really gave a lot "more" to play, because it was really great time to make a new char and start over, even though I was well familiar with most of the game already. After Fallout 76 was announced my second char was about level 200, my first played before survival mode reached about level 100. And the restrictions imposed by that made replaying the game quite a long process. I really hope Fallout 76 will have something like that, not this kiddy-survival thing we have now. (Without requiring full on PvP)
---
I would expect Fallout 76 to be worth playing for at least two years. Easily at least a year. But not for everyone. I can clearly see how some people advance the game through very fast, and there really isn't a lot to play if you do it like that. There's no way in hell people can be content to just farming WS and SBQ for several months. Specially when most equipment you could possible get, can be brough anyway from players who many have duped them. It's both good and bad.
---
With so much talk about DLCs, I get the impression people are expecting Fallout 76 to have DLCs equal to Far harbor or Nuka world of Fallout 4. I think the biggest DLC might be close to Automatron in size, if even that. Could very well be less. There's huge difference between paid DLCs and free DLCs, even though a lot of the DLCs of Fallout 4 were sold fairly cheap with the season pass, as well as online and single player aspect. Yeah it depends on game, but if you look at the depth of content in Fallout 76, you can get good idea what kind of DLCs might be.
---
That's my 2 cents.
---
Just a poor attempt at rage bait, nothing to see here
---
I owe myself to the atom store
---
&gt; Those vaults better be gigantic content updates.
---
Doubt it. They'll be like the Mothman Museum. Good lord, they featured that thing, it sounded like such a neat place to include on the map, and then you get there and say, "That's it?"
---
P.S. Why are you looking for them? 
---
Ah jeez. I hope this isn‚Äôt the case. That‚Äôs my backup rifle. 
---
Thanks Punda. I already feel better. Cant play trashpuppet titles. Not going to be a sheep like that and "hope" for the best while wasting my time. It's not even enjoyable. The community is the only decent part of the game. Made a lot of cool friends but I was the last one to quit out of like 30 people. This is just pathetic.
---
With you there pal. The crushing blow for me was after launching my first nuke on whitesprings, I stepped into the blast zone and crashed immediately. End game is boring. I have explored the entire map; I‚Äôve had my fun but im back onto timeless games like halo 
---
exactly
---
Division 1 is now holding me over (again) till Metro, then we'll see about Division 2
---
I quit a month ago. I get my moneys worth watching this train wreck continue to pile up and see people still try to defend it ü§£
---
Yeah, that's why I said it was hilarious. What don't you understand?
---
exactly!!!!
---
No, since these were from serums, Class Freak shouldn't be an issue at all.
---
You can still jailbreak your iPhone, but that's probably a great analogy for this. Rather than trying to prevent duping, it's probably better that they leave the current duping procedures possible and just have servers log and red flag actions that are known to be used for duping. Users that raise flags get their accounts frozen. Otherwise, they're going to be playing cat and mouse for years. 
---
In any case, I think your outlook is myopic and lacks any context. For example, you saying people at cap max have de-valued caps means nothing. Caps are worth more now because there's actually stuff worth buying (formerly rare plans). I was at cap max before patch and I'm pretty much broke now. 
---
If anything, the recent choice to make mule accounts useless disempowers legitimate traders, making legtiimately obtained inventories hard to trade for caps. However, if you're a duper selling items for RMT, you can drop items in front of a player after you get a paypal notification. If less legitimate traders can do transactions (they can't even accept caps for inventory trades) and demand is unabated (bloodied+explosive is now highly sought after), then more players will seek out the items from those who are able to sell them.
---
I suck and 140 hours in since early November I'm level 52 and I'm irritated with some of their choices for balance. I never duplicatod anything or exploited the fusion core glitch but damn it made things easier to start power armor at 100%. And I miss the mama dulche stew. It warmed my heart that fallout 76 Bros were looking out for me sometimes. I like the game and I'm not a big ol badass gamer taking advantage of it yet I still go complain. Still like the game I just also still feel the need to complain about some things too because while I don't feel personally attacked I am frustrated it's making it all the harder for shitty gamers like me to play
---
Yep. Steel, Lead and Aluminum. And the odd other thing. 
---
if it makes you feel better i was got one shot by a level 24 im level 84
---
I know I‚Äôm but one guy, but I have to say I appreciate the work you and other modders do to make this game better. I‚Äôm sorry there‚Äôs been a lack of communication but I‚Äôm glad that it hasn‚Äôt stopped your work
---
its not going to make them anymore money and is lost cause trash. so yes put all resources to a game that might be good

My camp has never been attacked by another player.  One time a few guys rolled into my camp when I was there and started slapping me for no reason, but I was crafting and in no mood at the time so I just relogged.  They did no damage to my camp, and that was once in 90 levels.  I see people at my camp sometimes but I don't even worry about it anymore because nothing bad has ever come from it.  Yet I hear this complaint of players destroying camps on reddit all the time.
---
I'm not sure why people are attacking you, are you maybe set up in Whitespring?  I know some players get pissed off if you set up there, especially if you have turrets out.  The turrets tag enemies I guess so they can't kill them for loot, or something..
---
Pfft lol
---
Takes about a week and you will get a reply telling you they received your reply and that you will hear back again in 7-10 days. I'm currently on day 6 of that 2nd step, for my mule account. I didn't dupe, so if they aren't totally incompetent I expect to get it back.

* When trying to complete Safe for Work, I already had the medical Holotape, which resulted in it not being marked with a diamond as a quest item and the quest not updating when it was listened to. Logged in and out a few times with no change. After a few days away from the game, it started to recognize that it has been played. 
---
* With the new patch, the game will randomly minimize and send me to my desktop, though all the sound will continue to play. When I attempt to click back into the game, [it'll open, flicker for a few seconds then minimize again](https://giphy.com/gifs/fallout76-g0QtSfRVttPcEzuPir) . Only way to rectify it is to force close and restart the game. 
---
spoiler: They have been all along.
---
Totally, you are right. Also, I was not joking for one second. Good job calling me out.
---
I agree. Tse shotty, marsupial, power armor. How boring. Everyone, out of a lack of creativity, was doing it.
---
I'll just assume you wish not to engage on the other point.
---
Assassin's/Sentinel more specifically. This guy was not ready üòÖ
---
Its the Hello Games effect, they proved that it doesn't matter if your game is 2 years behind schedule people will still pay full price and believe you when you say it will work soon :/
---
That along with wanting to move the core of the team onto the next big hype train so they can push that out the door as well.
---
People have been saying the exact same shit since the game's release. OP didnt express anything other than the same things about a thousand other threads have said. OP makes it seem like she is emotionally damaged and completely torn from head to tail about it. If its that bad then seek professional help or go do something that doesnt damage your life.
---
I have an idea. I know that Demo expert was recently nerfed to make it fit with the rwst of the weapon damaging perks, but would it be possible to increase the base damage of the M79, Missile Launcher, Auto Grenade Launcher, Broadsider, etc. as right now they just are mediocre. A 20% increase like the automatic buff would work for now. 
---
Also increase the durability of laser and plasma weapons (majority opinion) as they break very fast compared to most other weapons. I havent noticed it too much but its just something a lot of people want. Anyways i guess if your reading this thank you and have a nice day.
---
I have two melee chars now.  I would be totally ok with a melee nurf if it came with a complete removal of all pve enemy armor in the game.  This would fix the wep balance and broken nature of the mobs.  Its the mobs armor that is making lower damage weps trash not there hp.  
---
I don't thank parrots for saying the same things over and over and over again. Especially when they amount to nothing.
---
Well, never ever buying this company's games would fix the problem.
---
because not meant as a way to let you add more perk cards.
---
You cant operate The switch that is part of the wall, you have to wire a different Wall switch/pressure plate to that switch. Its dumb, I know.
---
Mentioning that now too. Thanks for confirming this mate
---
You're not stupid
---
Weird, I got mobbed by all the robots in whitesprings and took down a pile of them. Not a single one had any loot. I figured that was on purpose to keep people from farming them.
---
The ships on fire and it‚Äôs sinking. Do you put the fire out and risk everyone drowning or do you stop the sinking and risk everyone burning to death. 
---
We all know Bethesda MO of vagueness and lack of communication. My guess is someone has all of your bugs and roundups, it‚Äôs just at the bottom of the list. 
---
Thanks..   
---
Figured I'd try one more shout into the void before I gave up entirely.  
---
Yesterday's patch completely crippled me and my play style (long story) and none of my characters can Buy/Sell/Trade... So a last "Hail Mary" to try and open a dialogue, and then I think I'm tapping out also.

doubt your enjoying this crap/ prob just spent 60$ and are in denial and wont admit it. if 0 people played every resource would go to next game. even tho only a small team is left its more than what should be there
---
Ah jeez I'm very dumb apparently while getting hit by a ghoul I got the grounded mutation I'll probably delete this post soon and change focus on just the stealth stuff
---
It‚Äôs much more satisfying watching the health bar from the other end üòâ
---
So.... 'just because everyone else does it' is a valid excuse?
---
As someone who has this in my "maybe later" category ( I want this game when they have private moddable servers) this post breaks my heart. :(
---
I have over 1000 hours in fallout 4, and the only thing stopping me from buying this game is I truly want to play alone. Also after fallout 4, I can't stand an unmodded fallout.
---
I hope the game gets better&lt;/3
---
Ok so its an actual bug. Gotcha. I haven't noticed this issue with my quad reapeating broadsider.
---
Maybe a way to discourage duping, since didn‚Äôt it involve the use of world containers?
---
passive/aggressives 
---
Really leery about logging in tonight. Finally broke down and bought it, been enjoying it, but I'm fully expecting to see poor low level  me and my pitiful perks take a swandive into a mudpit, just when things were finally beginning to gell together.  
---
"Sigh"
---
Dev room only, not yet publicly released
---
i have an explosive laser rifle with the scatter mod, and it just breaks within a full clip if it's not fixed to 200% durability. btw, do you also experience short freezes when you fire your TSE laser rifle? happens to me fairly often and i'm not sure if it's a problem on my side, or if there are other in the community who experience this too. only my explosive laser rifle causes my game to randomly freeze upon firing. sometimes for a second, and sometimes for up to about 5 long seconds
---
Like all the social bugs I experience on a daily basis since launch that actively prevent me from playing on a team, the way this game was designed? Oh wait, they ignored all my bug requests and I still encounter those same game breaking bugs.
---
I met some cool friends on PSN. I even became a trader and made about 400k caps in a month. Never duped or any of that BS. I role played my character for about a month.. lost interest.. had 4 characters all to at least 110. Just overall boring after a while. Max camps and all that.. just sucks when everything you have is basically wiped from the server. 0 stash and your main and offhand weapons disappear on initial load in from the new patch.. 
---
Super lame. I defended this game for a while. Up until this patch. Now I feel like I logged off and back 9n and was raided by some amateur programmers. If this shit happened in the real world.. people would be fired for such mistakes. 
---
I hope that these Australians can figure it out soon. But, there main project dev left the company last year so kudos to me not doing my research before I bought this mess.
---
It's even more satisfying still killing u in one hit with a Bloodied melee üòö
---
they all have caps, it‚Äôll start 1-3 caps, then after a handful of rounds they seem to bump up. there‚Äôs about 25 mutants. 
---
this area causes me to wonder if the game was designed for grinds and keeping kills close together gives better rewards. at WV Lumber Co eventually they start giving screws or springs and when that happens the caps seem to increase too. i have a pattern where i get 5-8 kills in a batch when the mutants flock to me. leave your pipboy light on, seems to bring em to u. do not sneak or the whole thing winds down.
---
Thanks but I don't understand why? What's the point of having extra points on legendaries? Especially if you can't use them
---
*Asshole intensifies*
---
Shoulda duped your ammo when you had the chance bro!
---
/s
---
ETA on when then this game will no longer be a steaming pile of buggy shit?
---
We tried and tried and tried to warn this sub.
---
Y'all stuck your fingers in your ears and screamed "I'M NOT LISTENING, STOP ATTACKING US. IT'S THE YOUTUBERS FAULT"
---
no, many of us love the fallout series, and therefore have an assload of experience with this shit ass company. We tried to warn you, we really did
---
F
---
That's right gamers, we're rising up above updates, patches and fixes. We're keeping it 100  and so should our games on release.
---
Are any of your components bulked?
---
Here and IRL I'm the idiot who keeps running in the burning building, so I guess this is the last pass through trying to see if anyone is left..
---
Well, that's something but the return of the damage bug should be top of the list imo...
---
Lol
---
That game looks ok, but not as much as it was hyped up to be originally. I'll look into it some, I just want my character levels and exp and gear to actually have a value instead of everyone's nerfed so suck it type of attitude
---

---
I had to upvote both of you, made me smile.
---
As expected Beth, you've created a griefer's paradise. While in passive my camp was attacked and destroyed and my character repeatedly killed. Of course I now have NO defense against this type of attack should I even choose to attempt to fight back. Thank you for ruining what could have been an enjoyable experience. Your lip service regarding PvP was obviously just drivel to sell your buggy product. Why would I continue to play a game that requires me to grind every day for resources just so some ass can destroy in a few minutes; Not to mention putting up with the blue screens, bugs, and so called "fixes"?
---
Woo thankyou Bethesda this is what we wanted. 
---
Just doing patches every month or so isn't enough we need hot fixes.
---
The face you are doing this is a massive step forward let's hope to see more hot fixes if things pop up in the community üòÄ
---
The more I hear about the crashing and constant patches and updates for such a new game I think it would have done better as a free to play game. I made it to lvl 70 and felt like I got all I needed from it. Never went through the final quest to launch the nuke but have participated in several. I wanted to help this one succeed but I fear this may be more of an everlasting, disfiguring to Bethesda. They killed it with Doom, that was their last masterpiece. Hell even Wolfenstein was great, a bit too long for a Wolfenstein game but still a great game to play. Doom was perfect. Great pacing, did the original doom guy justice as he was in the original. Man of few words but lots of guns and violence. I almost wish they stopped there. ES6 is going to be rushed to bandage their rep from fo76. More Doom. Less fallout if this is your idea of it's future
---
No. Does it give a description? 
---
It was...so young... It was nerfed before it's time.
---
No, it isn't funny at all. All the employees posting hear are nothing but parrots, repeating the same things over and over again. Sure wish they'd "pass it along" for me. I'm sick of the fucking bugs preventing me from joining a fucking team. You know, the way they want us to play? Their jobs are completely useless. They could literally be replaced with bots, and we wouldn't know the difference. Oh wait.....
---
Today alone, I have had 4 legendary mobs that I killed just despawn. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/FeLeX8G.jpg
---
This is an example.  corpse was loot able as it was falling and then poof, now its a prop in the world.
---
This is all within 15 minutes.
---
I realize now I have several others do the same, but this really caught my attention since they were legendary.
---
This is on PC.
---
I've had to have mine on the whole time,  and all my mutations are from serums.  Good ole consistent Bethesda. 
---
This is a sad day for all
---
Seeing this reply on its own from the bot's agreggation at the top of the thread gave me a tickle - but seeing it in context, I now understand that you were referencing a username instead of using "mofo" as a term of endearment. And I have to admit, it was a little disappointing. 
---
I'd love to.
---
My anger is not being directed at the wrong person. He/She is the person responding. My anger is not with  the situation, but the response!
---
I also don't see how they are helping us. As far as I can tell, based on posts, all they do is "communicate" what can be so obviously seen with 15 mins/day of browsing this subreddit.
---
I'm not on this subreddit 24/7, and I notice the 6+ posts regarding the issue. So that is just a lame excuse.
---
If you stow or ready your weapon before you land, you skip the landing animation. Practice it and it won't be too bad.
---
Plan: Rad Worms Serum
---
Just kidding.
---
&gt; It's a giant map, which is cool, but it's so damn empty.  
---
Such a shame. Huge map, and maybe a half dozen people on a server. I may run into one or two of them on occasion, with &lt; 50% chance of any interaction. Zero NPCs, nothing interesting going on. A few good storytelling elements via the holotapes, but even those are few and far between.  
---
The only time this piece of crap ever felt like a FO game was when I randomly ran into Grahm. That guy has character and injects a bit of humor. But after trading with him, I was on my way and it was back to walking through a large world with zero point.
---
They should have nerfed the explosive modifier on non explosive weapons and left demo expert alone. 
---
Maybe you shouldn't try to transfer stacks of duped items
---
 Good find.  
---
Lets see... you're welcome to go through my inventory, and my stash, to review me for 'duped' items...  and let it be known.. I am one of those friends who has given his mule character things to hold for me when my stash was full. 
---
Don't sit there and lie to me and say you haven't wished you had a place to store crap when your stash was full.  Mule characters wouldn't be a necessary evil if Bethesda would actually use a modern database engine, instead of the Frankensteins monster  that they've spawned from the bowls of the creation engine. 
---
Honestly, I feel like you may be looking a bit too far into it. I just like this build because it makes me feel agile and lets me play like a FPS-focused game. I don't care too much about the damage, the game is when it throws so many healing items and resources at you. I do believe that "having fun" vs "one-shotting everything" is the proper way to play though
---
Thank you for this!! Going to share this with the team, but if you have the time, it'd be great if you submitted a support ticket about this too so this bug is logged with the support team as well [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Well imagine using mutations that subtract points. Wouldn‚Äôt that be fun.
---
\*sigh\*
---
It just works!
---
I also disagree with OP. The true fans didn't stick around and defend this game. The true fans have plenty of experience with Bethesda and knew with the way this game was released, it was already down shit river.
---
The one's who stuck around were the newer fans, less aware of Bethesda and their bullshit. And the ones who are willfully ignorant to it all. 
---
The real fans were called haters for trying to warn you guys
---
Figuring out what doesn‚Äôt break as fast, and what does cause damage, is part of the fun. 
---
Its been removed in the last patch, both mine are gone.
---
&gt; We are keeping it alive because we want it to be good? Nice of you to speak for the whole community there pal.
---
The only one speaking for the whole community is you, what with your "We" and alll. OP made it clear that was their own opinion only.
---
A novel idea moving forward.
---
I think it's pretty obvious that it was just an unintended side effect from changing the mods. 
---
Plasma is still shit rn.
---
Get an anti armor ballistic gun, any will do
---
Replying to your alt account just makes the troll post even more obvious.
---
I sadly agree. I've been so hopeful and I've enjoyed Fallout 76 for what it is, despite recognizing its endless flaws, bugs and problems. What has been hard to look past is Bethesda's behaviour as a company and their weirdass decisions. I'm running out of steam as well.
---
I seem to recall countless posts about how fallout 4's survival mode was a joke because weapons didn't have an item condition on it. "the people" asked for this.
---
Another big issue is the failure of the challenges to complete due to playing the BETA, many of the "find locations in X" just won't complete the kill cryptids and other kill 'x-type' creature challenges are failing and today I got the challenge for using 76 bobbleheads from using a stimpack in a SBQ fight. I've only played a couple hours since the patch because too many things I do are breaking, like a mass of Caps Stashes I used to hit once a day are no longer there, ever, 2 outside Whitespring service entrance and 2 in the retail area of Whitespring, also the ones that do show up always set off the perk for finding them even after they have been searched with Cap Collector.
---
... Alot of people still play. I think they need to really asses their patch as well but the games not dead. That's the wrong attitude to have. 
---
yep seen something like that dead mobs that look and act like stationary alive versions.
---
Do you have the perk cards equipped?
---
Alpha testing ftw.
---
People like you are the worst part of this community tbh.
---
Fatman is AoE so its fine. 
---
They are looking into it, as meaningful as that means these days
---
HAHAHA
---
&gt;Right, couldn't agree more, but then what defines a suitable amount of content? 1000 hours? 2000? Should you be able to play 24/7 and never run out of new experiences?
---
My mother has played the solitare on Windows 3.1 and 95 for something like tens of thounsands of games. On later Windowses she has brought some other solitare game packs and played insane amounts of them too, because they didn't ship with any solitaire. The win 3.1 one was intresteing since it was never reinstalled so the stats it had were never reset. The 95 was probably reinstalled once to OSR2. I remember checking them once but  I can't remember the amounts, but they were quite insane. She had 3.1 from about -89 till -96 and Win 95 from that till about -04. The old W3.1 was probably dual bootable with the W95 and she might have played the old one even after 96. Or it might had run directly from Win95.
---
New experiences? Simple Solitare games like shipped with Windows have very finite amount of different games. Many of them are not even completable, because the way decks are randomized, the game doesn't quarantee each deck to be winnable. After some games, there's nothing new. The game is fairly basic and simple.
---
My point is, the game doesn't deside how much it can be played. It is the player.
---
Boooooooooooooo
---
Welcome to the joys of online game development: Where things frequently make no sense from a logical perspective because they must from a gameplay perspective.
---
Serums only suppress negative effects for the first hour, then back to normal. You're gonna need Class Freak after all.
---
Im sorry but if a group of Modders can use Version control without issues this massive, maybe they need some restructuring. 
---
One of the major selling points was that the game would evolve, and may be a completely different game in a year. Like literally one of the first things they said about it. 
---
Hotfix coming to fix that soon
---
It doesn‚Äôt make mule accounts useless, just limits how much you can put on them. Me and my wife each run a mule alt on each other‚Äôs  accounts. 
---
Mine carries around 4,000 weight, and accounts for a very large bloodied and unyielding stash. 
---
I can break it up between several 1,700(+600 stash) alts and live more or less in those bounds. This really doesn‚Äôt affect mules that bad unless you‚Äôre hoarding way more than that, and that‚Äôs a subset of players doing this. 
---

Sorry for the quality. The book is hardcover with a solid bind lol 
---
Guess I found out where all the funds went for the ‚Äúcanvas bag‚Äù 
---
There were mass posts advocating exactly this hitting the front page on this sub for a very long time dude..m
---
I smell bullshit, ive done both, excessively craft and scrap multiple times and no ban, so unless ur spamming it at an extraordinary rate, i suspect ur either covering for something, or its more complex than what u describe.
---
It is. There are posts in this sub and one earlier about it. Rad worms will make *all* player effects (ie everything in your "Effects" page in the pip-boy) more effective by 50%. This includes all mutations and even things like Well Fed. Consequently, using a Disease Cure on the worms with cause *all* status effects to go to zero until you relog.
---
Ya, for real.
---
We literally couldn't trust their patch notes on multiple occasions, because they "forgot" to note nerfs once, and this last patch they "forgot" to add that plans now cost a shit ton more. They keep "forgetting" to post complete patch notes. Why the fuck should we trust them?
---
ManyATrueNerd is the only one I watch.
---
Most likely bringing in people, unless workers quit which I doubt because regardless of the state of this game id assumed bethesda pays well 
---
Because crafting too quickly can cause server instability and it's not been resolved.   
---
It was first reported in the first few hours of the first Day of the BETA
---
It doesn‚Äôt say that I need any perk cards to build it. When I built the other pieces, I didn‚Äôt need a perk card either
---
Yeah, that's a dev room item. Soo, steer far away from it unless you want a target on your back.
---
Hahaha nice. Quality is fine. I'm going to keep my eye out for one. 
---
Uhm negative. If you have the more times that by 5 or whatever mirv is. 
---
Oh shit! Thank you! I thought because it was in the book it was available now. Thanks for looking out 
---
I know I will be playing this game for the foreseeable future but the community is really very nuanced to say the least.
---
Some are really angry and some are really angry at the really angry people.
---
Some are writing goodbye essays like people finishing off their last day at their current job before moving to a new job and some make fun of those posts.
---
Anyhow very interesting and with all the passion for and against I wonder how many will stay and how many will leave forever and how many will leave and come back and leave again. 
---
So much drama, this is better than Netflix tbh.
---
Hi
---
Does bulking components affect the amount of the component? I thought it only reduced its weight 
---
Maybe you should hire devs that know what they are doing. It seems every patch makes this game worse and not better. Do you even have a qa team testing these patches because how the hell do you miss something so small...or revert back to it's original state? Patches are ment to fix issues not cause 50 more bugs. How about you fire your pr team because God know you're not going to be making money off your jacket. And spend more time and money testing things before releasing patches that will infuriate the remainder of who plays. Look at reddit and see how many people quit your game. Why because of bad decisions made by your company. You continue to fail your dwindling customer base. I was very excited about this game but now it's on my top 5 worst game picks and I'm not the only one that feels that way. Should never have released this product we would have been better off getting delayed a year instead of this hot garbage. Take after mojang who delayed the super duper graphics pack 2 years now because of the bugs. They care about their games because they would refuse to release a product in this state.
---
It's the fans desperately trying to hang on to something we've loved for decades. I've been with Fallout since it's birth. It had it's ups and downs even that turn based co op game. It has great lore and a great history. Greed and poor management of the IP has crippled this wonderful game. The sub are those voices. No one wants to admit failure and wants their favorite thing to be glorified. Just like sports teams. In your clubs worst you'll always standby regardless of how poorly they're managed 
---
I don't wanna own up my build like that these days lol! But you aren't far off. Just know know I crit into the 40 to 50k range depending on which buffs happen to be active. With 75% pen, it's more than I'll ever need for anybody lol.
---
It buffs the 20% damage buff of explosives to 32% with a full demo expert. It is now better to disregard demo expert at all unless you use explosive weapons. 
---
&gt; So QA's build that they tested worked fine, even though it was probably tested solo and then before it shipped to us some dev changed something that unfortunately broke pretty much everything that QA had tested?
---
Let me clear that up, sorry just got off work. Also, just to reiterate, this is all just a hypothetical, and I am basing off of how our defect/bug process works at my job.
---
By "tested solo" I mean 1 QA person was probably working through 10-15 of these changes, while another QA rep was working a different group of issues, so on and so forth.
---
So maybe 1 person got the tickets to work and test the exploit glitch being fixed, the new carry weight max, and the Known tags. Unless needed they are the only ones testing for those.
---
OR I'm completely wrong and all the QA testers are given a checklist to go through and they are identical. I've never worked in the Video Game field so I can only speak as to how some MSP software does things or how big their QA team is.
---
As for the CM's they are just peon number 187,543 that works at company X. No different then I am at my company. Until I moved to this position it still took me a while to get it as my job in the process was just validating the defects in our software that support sends to me.
---
Their job (to my knowledge) is to monitor and watch for trends and report issues that might have not been reported yet, issues overlooked, Issues thought not as big as a concern initially but everyone is upset about a certain change, or maybe they get lucky and someone is like "here is how you do this" so they now have proper steps to give the devs.
---
I'm assuming that they are given very strict guidelines as to what they can and can not say or it will cost them a job. We as a community are allowed to share our anger, frustration, and concerns to them, but at the end of the day they're customer service reps who have (most likely) nothing in terms of answers, or even insight as to how the dev cycle works.
---
If the CM's did have that info and were allowed to share it, they would. And I am always in favor of clearing and precise patch notes. I don't have to agree with changes/nerfs but I do like seeing the input as to why they are going a certain route.
---
Hopefully that makes some more sense, and feel free to take all of this with a little grain of salt as my experience is with MSP software and not games.
---
It would be overpowered for Intelligence because I‚Äôve gone up to 33 before. There is a lot of good things in there.
---
As long as I get the first hit üòÅ
---
Who is letting them get away with it and how? Turning your PC/Console on and starting Fallout 76 is what counts as "letting them get away with it"? Because thats literally all anyone who bought the game has the power to do. Play or don't.
---
The cards effect the condition and quality of the PA, and I've seen it oddly not let you craft without them equipped. It's erratic 
---
What?
---
I get that. So does intelligence mean my weapons take longer to break or when I scrap them they produce more scrap? Or would that just go towards damage on an energy based weapon?
---
nope, "I'll pass that along" is by far the biggest response
---
I rock a different but close build (different legendary effects) as my main myself so sharing my own (perhaps too passionate) thinking about my build :)
---
That is a good point \^\^
---
Actually the OP is the one that said "We." I was responding to that 
---
You are definetly a cool cat. Isn't it like 1am in wherever you are. Shouldn't you be asleep? 
---
Odd, this is the first time this has been an issue. I guess I was having a lucky bug that whole time before =/
---
Never go full snark.
---
That's just like, your opinion man. 
---
I'll take "lies I made up to cover my dirty duping habits" for one thousand, Alex.
---
I quit after about 3 weeks I still keep on a sub hoping that they're going to have some good content or it's suddenly so much better to play but it doesn't look like it's going to ever go that way at this point
---
The fucking entitlement coming *off this comment is awful.  
---
Also *they're .
---
Radworms are bugged again
---
They double your positive and negative mutations
---
The serums only grant 1hr of immunity to negative effects
---
Any more than that and you‚Äôve been living with a dream bug, haha
---
You trolls make this community suck.
---
I think it was  last night with the new inventory. I saw one and couldn't get a 2nd one even though I quit and came back. I think Grahm inventory might change if you find him on a different server. What I normally do is hold him with 1 of my characters, quit my other character and then come back and check his inventory. I might have been wrong, it might have also just been before the patch. If I find it again I will let you know. Looks like people are finding grahm more since the patch dropped.
---
Mate it‚Äôs abt getting it prepared for a market relaunch to try and make it a PVP game. They want some of market share of PUBG, COD and Fortnite. This was they can sell skins to this gaming segment...... they have no interest in pleasing our segment of fallout fans. Coz we are not the type to buy skins, play serious PVP. get carried away with fashionable items in game. they have our $60 and no long need us. They want PVP cash now......
---
Bloodbugs beware!
---
You hear that  Bethesda i want my batman power armor paint delivered soon lol
---
You should submit a ticket to Bethesda.  Be sure to give them all of your account information.  I'm certain they'll be very interested in this issue with you having 4000+ Quantums and be embarrassed that they're game is not designed to properly manage people storing 4000+ Quantums.
---
Has anyone tested what happens to a Bloodied build character, with full Unyielding armor, at low health? Is it (5 x 3) x 1.5 for every SPECIAL stat, ergo +22, on rad worms?
---
It doesn't reduce weight (except for lead).
---
And currently, if (for example) all of your steel is bulked, and you need to make something that requires steel, you won't be able to craft said item until you manually scrap the bulked steel.
---
You can build walls above support beams but you have to add the support beam last. 
---
I would respectfully disagree.  The vast majority of ramshackle structures in 76, like Raider ruins, are wood.  Wooden CAMPs blend into the environment more than the warehouse set, and are more pleasing to look at.  It makes for a better starter set because anyone can build something nice with it, but they can step up to barn or brick if they want to make it look classy.
---
LOLOLOL
---
I was previously doing 1,600 on my TSE lever rifle with my glass canon build (no meds/bobblehead/food/adrenaline perk), now I'm only doing 400. It's 75% weaker than before. The reduction is consistent with yours.  I think with perks and mutations, Bloodied Explosive Guns will do better than TSE
---
The spawns have been erratic from time to time.
---
Two patches ago there was a glitch where WhiteSprings would not respawn (clubhouse) consistently even when a new player zoned in.  
---
Looks like that problem is back.
---
With armor the choices are much more diverse and thusly much more heavy. Armor is also the main market untouched by duping outside of certain builds (unyielding+sentinel, assassin+sentinel, assassin+unyielding). 
---
Am I wrong?
---
It‚Äôs just a name homie 
---
As said in another comment, the mule for a hundred friends is possible. I run a community of 500 people(though more like 50-75 active) and we all use one guy as a mule/guild storage. 
---
The paper bags is *Plausible* but less so than the guild/mule.
---
Sorry I meant, sometimes you learn a plan and it doesn't show up on your build menu. I just checked and I can use it. Interesting .. I just want to learn everything even if I never use it.
---
You're not wrong, Walter, you're just an asshole.
---
Intellect helps with XP , hacking and crafting conditions. It should tell you what everything does if you go to the special menu, just highlight the stat.
---
The energy weapons are just an example. My point is the community manager is trying to make it seem funny that she's "passing along to the team" more things. We get it you pass everything along and then the management goes and does something else and the devs do another thing and here we are with most of the subs being complaints. If they were passing along things and management was listening (I'm assuming that's not just another canned / bot response and they really are trying to do their jobs) then the patches would be more in line with what the community has been asking en masse since the game launched. It's not funny they are passing off as a joke, the absolutely poor disconnect between customer to community manager to Dev team to management. 
---
Guess it makes solo play kinda lame then. It used to respawn for me no issues. Even in non nuked zones seems like I can only get bad guys to slaughter once a day. 
---
I don‚Äôt mean broken game. I mean some weapons require game style adjustments to be useful. This isn‚Äôt code testing. It‚Äôs figuring out what comprimises you‚Äôre prepared to make to drive your nicer than average build. 
---
Giving u/lonevaultwanderer a pat on the shoulder as we speak. Thank you for your kind words and feedback - we really are listening and the dev team are working super hard. 
---
I guess I'm just trying to figure out why they have legendaries with + intelligence, charisma, luck, perception.... what does that help?
---
Someone has to, but it doesn‚Äôt make you an idiot. It makes you a fan. In the decades of gaming I‚Äôve only stuck around for the games I knew would eventually get better like No Mans Sky and the ones I knew wouldn‚Äôt get any better. I‚Äôm sticking around. I‚Äôve played some terrible games and this isn‚Äôt one of them. I can assure you it will get better. 
---
Sorry was replying to the wrong comment. My bad.
---
I put in my 20ish hours and quit. Maybe I will come back in 6 months when they fire management and fix their shit. The game is a joke at the moment.
---
No, you can upgrade them but the schematic requires the original items.
---
Yup, im more of the character development type. D2 Lod was done extremely well, too bad it's so dated. Poe looks good too, but it's a steep learning curve by the looks of it, just don't have the time these days.
---
I disagree on the stabilized perk, a weapon type shouldn‚Äôt be limited to power armor due to a single perk. It‚Äôs annoying as hell I have to use PA to maximize my preferred weapon type.
---
Stabilized is much stronger after the ts/tse nerf also. Now that ts/tse doesn‚Äôt one shot everything you can really see the difference this perk makes.
---
Sorry to hear that. People on this sub are just angry from the constant post of people complaining on how terrible Bethesda is and that we are just as evil for playing this game.if you don't like it that's fine. But I like it, I play it, and yeah it's still got a lot of bugs but give it time. Who knows maybe someday you might come back when they add and fix more things and you might enjoy it once again.
---
Thank you! Thought I was going nuts. 
---
We can't give you a date because we ran out of glue to sniff and Todd ate all the good cardboard.  
---
3 items to fix...3 no date.  It's a hotfix.  As in oh shit we fucked up we need to fix this...no date...
---
No apology...no help. No anything just smug faces as we "fix" more things.  We felt the scorch beasts were spawning to slowly and weren't enough of an ammo sponge...so we made them mini queens that get tougher as more people try and attack.  They are also spawning 1 every minute....better get to killing them.  
---
That could of been the problem I was checking them regularly but after a while the pop up window just stopped showing anything I assumed they stopped producing. 
---
Theres a mod for that
---
Ahh but it‚Äôs the Crits that get you through sentinel, since it reduces incoming damage by a percentage and does not buff DR. Well played, mcpoyle, well played...üòÜ
---
Interesting. Bethesda's implementation has the same bug a user made mod has. Every time I hear about software having an identical bug to software made by another company, it's because they stole the code and based their software on it. I've seen multiple lawsuits based solely on identical bugs being present. So, did Bethesda just copy the mod? Guess we may never know.
---
Not going to defend. But, I am still enjoying the game.  Will keep playing until it stops being interesting and fun to me.  
---
Or drop all duped items and dont try to keep them?
---
Sorry dad i know its past my bed time but can i stay up.. oh please daddy üòÇ what a ass hat
---
I know üòä i always know what to say at the right moment its one of my many qualities. Now when your done telling me when its my bedtime can we have some respect for a fallen title üôè

 October 27, 2102 
---
It sucks for those people, but the project was mismanaged. People get fired when projects are mismanaged
---
Never trust the pop up windows. I've had tons of resources left behind until I realized they didnt always show up in the pop ups. 
---
I might be soon.  My goal in the game was to get a set of every weapon and armor plan in the game on my main character so I could help out Lower levels and my friends while leveling by making good stuff.  I didnt even see it in the patch notes but ever vendor sells all the plans so it's easy to get them all  now, and a lot more expensive.  My main goal in this game is kinda ruined now so idk if I'll stick with it much longer.
---
I‚Äôve notice a possible cap placed on them to deter farming them. I hit one by accident and had them all attacking me, after killing like 5 or so it stopped giving me XP and loot. 
---
I'm guessing this has to do with the fix to notebooks no longer defaulting to playing on the integrated card.
---
You hit the nail on the head though. Patience is key. üëç
---
See I sorta liked what they did with New Vegas where the wind broke fairly slowly and to repair then you just combined them with a similar weapon, and there were perks that allowed you torepair things with weapons that weren't super close, like repairing q chainsaw with a pool cue

*Next time on General Gaming!*
---
*The devs of Anthem feud with the devs of FO76 to be the MOST HATED game release of the last two months!*

*The Blizzard devs are scared of blame being cast on them due to Activision, and EA's stocks are in hot debate!*

*All next week on General Gaming*
---
Problem with SBQ is her loot table. It only got looked at once.
---
I like how Bethesda folks don't reply to posts like this. Leaving us to conclude that yes in fact they just say f\*ck it and release stuff without testing.
---
Doesn't work all the time. :'(   
---
Just recently dealt with a real stubborn build.
---
Thank you for this. Was stuck unable to advance when my co-op partner could. This fixed it for me.
---
I would have to disagree with the Fallout community as a whole giving me a good experience, but the Fallout 76 community has. Hope we see you one day soon.
---
Done with this game too . Signed on today just to say hi to my fallout76 friends. Then signed off , built good report with people on there, but not with the devs.  
---
Can we get some damn 4 and 5 star legendaries already ...  Unless I've been missing something 
---
what duplication glitch came back with this patch? if its the one with where you make like 300 of something does it even matter with the new weight limit in place? im really curious because it seems like that shouldnt be a major point since this update
---
I loved 3 and 4, they had issues but were worth the 60+ whatever for DLC. 
---
76 is an amazing concept, and I think it will be amazing, so I hold out hope naively a studio will value customers over money and fix their mistakes.
---
Fallout 76 is going through a very hard time for BGS and its fans but I still love the game. Please keep it up.
---
Yes but the ones that say excavator are around 5K these didn‚Äôt and I know they‚Äôre for the excavator - but they were less than 1K. 
---
I‚Äôm a huge fan of the game. But it needs work. And they need to really step their game up. Big name games are starting to come. And this game population is going to dwindle even less. 
---
I can only imagine the number of death and rape threats she has received in her inbox.
---
Because they don‚Äôt understand that QOL can make or break a game for players. Some games lack a lot of QOL. This game lacks all of it.
---
That makes sense. I hope that's how it works. But I have over 90 hours played and just now got the 10 hacking achievement. Looks like only melee builds gain from the added effects of legendaries with the +
---
That's fair man. I can see your point and your frustration now. Sorry, I was being a dick.
---
Oh look, another big Lebowski reference. Only 100 more to go. 
---
It is broken though. Explosive and Energy weapons break within minutes. lmao. 
---
On top of that, Bethesda has many other games and studios they work with where those people could go if management gave a shit about them.
---
Look man, that's just not reasonable. 
---
Who would hold on to the 4000+ quantum's they come across when they need space for the 500 TSE handmades and 1k bloodied anti-armor supersledges that have also been stumbled upon.... legitimately of course!
---
Hard out man I got them last and was like why is the keypad on the inside? Fucked up
---
Oh ok. I believe your looking for mods not plans.
---
and the ghoul kid will lead you into a super mutant infested camp that killed most of the Preston's crew before introducing you to his parents who live in a nearby cottage?
---
I honestly don't know what to do in this game. Leveling up was fun, but now it feels so empty. I keep on telling myself I'll come back (Level 70) when they make it better.
---
But they never did, and if anything, it seems they aren't anytime soon. I wish there were like,"dungeon instances" or something to promote grouping up. I can't see the fun in killing the same enemies over and over again in already explored areas, for level ups that don't accomplish a whole lot.
---
Just drop it man; everyone knows this is a troll post. But yeah, I‚Äôm fine with it as long as it keeps triggering you!
---
Pro-tip: if you‚Äôre gonna troll, you‚Äôre not supposed to get mad.
---
when im crafting food too quickly i always get (server not responding)

Same on xb1
---
Playing 7.6k hours for just 20 atoms? How about 1000 atoms for all them hours of play them instead of 20 atoms.
---
You say that, but everyone ends up getting bored with a game. 20 hours, 50 hours, 200 hours, it'll always happen.
---
And when that happens, what the player starts noticing is the problems of the game rather than the parts they used to have fun with.
---
It could be balance, it could be bugs, it could be optimization. People will always complain at that point, it happens with every single game, and to almost every single player at a point.
---
I'm extremely amused that they didn't consider drinking all of them and getting 4000+ caps.  Guessing they got greedy and were hoping to sell them and get more than one cap per bottle.
---
760 hours are doable since they expected the game to go for 2 years. 7600 is more of a pun joke in relation to the game, fallout 76. They knew it wouldn‚Äôt get reached and gives a fun way to follow your progress. Relax 
---
God brought jesus back from the dead maybe he will resurrect fallout. Miracles have been known to happen. As of right now its dead to the comminity just maybe it will come back to life just maybe. Until then my post stays and your gone... byeeee
---
Just travelled back from the future.. it's pushed to 2103
---
I agree 100% this is supposed to be a decent sub where people can actually talk about the game and not get talked to like an idiot. I'm with ya. 
---
Thank you. Looks like I'll be trying a melee build. Strength looks like the only one with an added bonus
---
They should just release modding and private servers already and let modders fix the game like they've fixed all their games before.
---
But i'm 10000% sure they're going to make a proper implantation of creation club for FO76 before releasing modding.
---
Really? I never had that happen to me. Sorry 
---
Haven't looked. I'm sure it's horrible. 
---
Rad-ex dampens mutation effects...
---
Nothing is stopping you from applying. 
---
This person is not someone that is going to fix this problem for us though. What do you want them to do other than acknowledge and move to the next one. 
---
It's not their fault the game is in this state. They are playing damage control and fuck dude theres a lot of damage. Comments like this just make it worse. 
---
If you think their comment wasnt needed then yours is ever less necessary. Why not comment on an actual issue in the game instead of picking at the community manager. COMMUNITY MANAGER. Not DEV MANAGER. 
---
It will be for the next game.
---
They wont hire a new team to fix this, they've already got the cash and have blown there chance to go big on the Atom store.
---
This is as good as it gets for FO76.
---
Good to know that they are bringing to hammer down to some degree, just i guess not really watching where they swing it :/
---
This. I also remember this. ¬´Bring item condition back its more realistic!¬ª and now people complaining. üòÇ
---
Don't be so hard on yourself, buddy. 
---
Not everything needs to be nerfed. If anything, most weapons need to be buffed so that endgame is viable regardless of what you choose to wield.
---
I lost about 900 .38 rounds to feed the people this arvo.
---
Doing a grind session to stock up on ammo, did that to take a break and kill the monotonous drain and then all my ammo for my primary just disappeared.
---
My furious explosive revolver was my main gun used did 129 with demo expert at 5, was a fun gun. Game was still challenging, but after nerf it feels like a .38 pipe pistol. Also think they should've added an explosive resistance perk card (flakjacket)? Instead of breaking weapons. My buddies has a regular REGULAR 10mm pistol doing more damage than his tse 10mm pistol, and that's not right at all.
---
Yes, just the mods. 
---
That doesn‚Äôt make any sense, why would they do that
---
I would have agreed a couple days ago. But I fear we're venturing into the dark waters of fans legitimately being frustrated and disappointed.
---
-PS4
---
-Psn: surefire437 
---
-Issue:  while a player is using Chameleon armor, and is kneeled and stand still, you can still see their nameplate above the player.  Which means when you‚Äôre attempting to hide during say PVP. You aren‚Äôt actually able to hide. 
---
IMO name plates nor dots on the compass should show in this case.
---
Thanks all.
---
That's the issue. You report but they dont listen.
---
Dude i eat popcorn watching this sub shit its self daily over something new at this point it's that kid you see in the shopping center scream they want a cookie then when they get a cookie they scream they got the wrong cookie
---
I'll counter that at some companies "QA" does merge and deploy builds. But I also think that the distinction is relatively meaningless and the responsibilities and job description for that can vary considerably from one place to another.
---
Yes, but those mass posts always mentioned something along the lines of dropping them into a fissure or sinking them in the bottom of a deep lake. Maybe that's what he planned to do. I don't know. I'm not leveling judgement here, because I don't know all the facts in the matter. I'm just saying that including that reason in the explanation as to why he had so many items in his inventory implied--whether correctly or not--that there was A LOT in those paper bags and that he held onto said items.
---
Huh.....Vats crit is among the highest dps ranged atm.
---
the doors not fitting the frames and the keypad items not working at all really bug me, also not being able to set the way the door opens. A door will open one way only, example : a door opening out with hinge on the left can't be made to open inwards with the hinge on the left.
---
Ya.. I mean, I don't want to be a dick, but can it really be called a "hotfix" if it takes a week?
---
You should probably just roll back. Maybe do some actual(fast) hotfixes to clear some issues. 
---
I feel you on that. I am at 90% done with all plans in the game and this whole.. you dont have to server hop kinda really put a damper on all the vendor traders as myself.  We farmed plans so people didnt have to as a service.. player vendor shops are going to be all but worthless now.
---
For a better description, check the pipboy, it gives its own little descriptions for each special and how it helps.
---
What about the lightning bugs http://imgur.com/gallery/SJvv31R
---
To kill them 
---
Imagine respecting reddit haha
---
Not all the same I'm sorry to hear that chief, I Uninstalled a while ago and I stay here to see if things improve. So far, seems like it's somehow getting worse. At least when I quit I had unlimited carry weight and a couple of guns that did decent damage. Rip to that.
---
Wow I can‚Äôt believe that, I didn‚Äôt realize you were saying they actually removed the entire apparel from the game 
---
Lol I‚Äôm relaxed trust me. It was a joke
---
I have 2 melee chars and 3 ranged, and yes i believe melee is OP.  At level 32-35 one hand, i was 1-2 shotting lvl 58 glowing ghouls, kill 3 lvl 50 SB and walked up and killed a level 91 leg glowing death claw.  This is an issue.  My melee char can farm legs about 6-10X as fast as my range.  
---
I enjoy making build more then end game, mostly because their is no end game.  
---
Also why cant I make more then 5 chars?
---
I hear you, and in part agree...   
---
But..    
---
People do have some valid complaints, not every thread is about TSE's nerfs (though there is some validity in frustration in how it was done).  
---
Strength.  All of it.   Tenderizer. Etc.  incisor.  Martial artist. 
---
So I guess my question would be then...
---
What is the point of a community manager? 
---
Boooo on you. You didn't have to question anything, they were duped and you know it. You are part of the problem, end of story. 
---
And a big problem is that respec is tied directly to leveling.  So if you make a mistake, or want to try something new...too bad.
---
83 years of those patches were just hot fixes alternately increasing and decreasing bobby pin weight.
---
best\_advice\_person is such a scumbag that they would go to the effort of faking stream footage....if they were banned for duping. Just saying 
---
Meanwhile in ATOM store: Feel the pain with the nerf? Buy the Silver Shroud outfit today! (+10% damage for each team member) 
---
I think you'd be able to kill the moon.
---
Idiot 
---
lol holy crap they're in full Damage Control Mode right now.
---
There is, /r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
Appreciate the heads up and info
---
Yeah, most of the guns in the game are in desperate need of a boost. Either that, or mobs need a health nerf. I just don't want to feel like my Gauss Rifle is firing foam darts. 
---
A megaton of development mis steps here.
---
5 points in demolition expert, 3 points in Ordinance Express. That's a long time to level up in our higher levels especially when they reduced the amount of XP you get from farming Whitesprings as well.
---
I think that seeing the plans backfired on me.  On one hand, it made me realize that I already owned a ton of plans.  On the other, I saw very few I didn't that I had any interest in getting.  And since grinding for Caps seems like the new meta-game, that's kind of a problem.
---
Huge Diablo fan as well. Kudos to finding like minded people on reddit and not just the opinionated angry peeps
---
Hey LoneVaultWanderer check this http://imgur.com/gallery/SJvv31R
---
??? What. 
---
Theoretically since each NEW bug patch introduces new bugs and rehashes old ones, the game will see a +196% increase to their Master bug list at the 1 year mark. 
---
Look mom a local isn't he adorable #nofilter #justscorchbeastthings
---
Agreed. I clarified that in another one of my responses... I think, but i'll fix that here too. ^_^b
---
Clearly you didnt read, I said make it so the nerf is in effect when the perks are together. But two shot alone is absolutely useless now.
---
Best of luck. Toss an upvote so this is visible. I'd appreciate it!
---
I'm just glad that someone got it at all :)
---
Basically. I loved my two shot dragon for pvp, people didnt stand a chance. 
---
Could be your GPU not processing the particle/lighting effects fast enough? I'm not sure. I used to have that issue with Quadro cards, but that's because they aren't optimized for games. Also, yeah... that's why I keep a stash of repair junk for it.
---
I read this in the DBZ narrators voice.
---
How about the people getting stuck in power armour again? (previously resolved)
---
I thought you were gone
---
Dupers
---
no proof
---
No, it suppresses it. But I didn‚Äôt use it, I know it‚Äôs effects and I can assure you, that isn‚Äôt normal.
---
I agree. It‚Äôs just uncalled for. And those ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done with this game‚Äù posts are really played out too. Guarantee if you take note of their username, 90% of them will be on here bitching about the next patch when it comes out.
---
Jet was made by a kid after the war from brahmin farts. 
---
I just posted a thread 30'ish minutes ago, which isn't, it's a plea to Bethesda to start working with us ModAuthors.  
---
[Bethesda the Mod Author community has been try to provide fixes to you since the BETA. You are still ignoring us and not using them..](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljowa/bethesda_the_mod_author_community_has_been_try_to/)
---
I agree.
---
Yeah, not to appear ungrateful but this is a big one that was introduced. Take more time to include more fixes if you need to. 
---
I'm gonna buy it when it's free.
---
you take one comment out of context - I am in several other discussions pushing for balance from weapons damage to new ways to improve armors and even weapon mods and other boosts but if players quit before they get here then we failed 
---
simply put I'm trying to remove some grind from the game TILL those balance fixes are added I'm not ignoring them I'm not pretending they don't exist the entire point of my comment was this is how with the current system to not farm as much - once they edit the system new advice will be given and to be honest it has nothing to do with my advice hurting people its just not the topic you think is important but the simple answer is how do we get players to survive till the balances are made? and that is by giving advice today on topics that effect today 
---
Lol forgot that.  Developers thought this one through.
---
TOS's have been rendered void before, and the only way to challenge them, is to take it to court. 
---
Oh, right those are the plans you want the crafted cheap mod. Well I bought my calibrated shocks in HF before the update. I don't really have any more information than that. I would check in game for you but my health makes that difficult heh.
---
Its the Spray'n'Pray!
---
Lots of good points. By nerfing TSE into the ground it just adds to the grind that no one enjoys but puts up with.
---
Well said
---
It IS a pity though. Until now (and yes even including FO4) the franchise has been pretty bloody good!
---
If they want to recycle the creation engine, fair enough, it's a good old workhorse, BUT they didn't flesh out a proper story, world, interaction system or content pool before they started gluing stuff back in.
---
Lazy work ethic from someone we respected and expected to do their due diligence in this product.
---
"They measured once, and cut twice" as the old saying went.
---
Ok, I‚Äôll check there. Thank you. 
---
By fun, do you mean duping items? If so, that‚Äôs not fun for the rest of us. It breaks the already fragile servers. 
---
Look, this bug is just annoying. Definitely not game breaking. If you want to breakdown yer bulks, just scrap the bulk to I bundle the items. 
---
If I get banned just gonna request a refund from Microsoft and just tell then them servers never work
---
Ok, if it'll happen today, I'll reply here to you. I'll be at home in about 12 hours
---
Dampens/suppresses tomatoes/tomatoes lol.hope you sort it.....
---
Geez, what a fragile bitch.
---
I dont give a rats arse about karma "buddy" im here to express my feeling and freedom of speech not to listen to some little suck up like you. Go play your rubbish game and bug someone elses post if ypu dont like what i have to say.  Im not the only person who is completely angry how this game turned out after spending a lot of money for it. If ypu enjoy it then good for ypu go play it and be a happy little bunny. And no this is a sub to point out things wrong with a game and offer opions, discussion and suggestions!!!
---
Didnt ya know inventory management and Mat acquisition has become the new End Game.
---
In truth it is just arbitrary items to make it necessary for you to gather junk and have to manage your resources thus really a time sink so you do not notice the lack of content.
---
Watch for ninja updates that will make this worse in the upcoming months. durability for weapons and armor will be subtly nerfed further.
---
Mobs will attack CAMPs more, and perk changes all made to make the grind longer and harder. Beth somehow thinks that is the fun part of the game.
---
im a melee build as well, lvl 134. i have a tse handmade i bought and use solely in queen fights to clean mobs and do some contributing damage to the queen when in flight. and now that gun is useless as i cant afford to throw perk cards to boost it. im salty i cant help now in a fight where she already doesnt seem to land enough
---
#duper problems
---
Just farm aluminum in watoga, they don't all agro when you kill one after completing mayor for a day
---
You and me both. I was going like ‚Äúhave you even **tried** playing the darn game?‚Äù
---
Yep.  That was my plan.  I was gonna set up a little shop. Nothing special except the home grown Legendaries I farmed and any craftable weapons so that new characters could try them before they went out and spent a shit ton on legendary versions.
---
Generally speaking they shouldn't listen to the loudest squeaky wheels, but it's hard to ignore them.  
---
Most people crying "balance this" have no idea what balance is in the first place..
---
100% agree... but yeah, r/FOFilthyCasuals is where the positivity all moved to.  The Hate Train moved in here.
---
I would recommend this to. Heavy energy weapons seem like fun but the amount of times you need to fix them even with the right perks is still pretty high. Will be even more obvious now they have made the TSE damage much lower so you need to shoot more so it will break more.
---
Ballistic Gun (including heavy guns) are much more manageable.
---
I blame everything on Bethesda.
---
Was it really
---
\^\^This\^\^
---
I've gone from 55 to 125 in about two weeks thanks to Whitespring and completely reorganized my build from shotty to melee.
---
Without Whitespring mobs I doubt I'd have bothered. I avoided that place for my first 55 level arrogantly thinking I was above ghoul farming but it's really quite fun and levels super quick.
---
Then you haven't seen the influx of OP melee builds since the patch. I've seen a melee player run around one shotting GROUPS of glowing ones with a super sledgehammer. Maybe you're build needs work.
---
It's just not special anymore to have all the plans.  I'm really sad now.
---
They break faster because we're using them. Untill yesterday we were shooting 1 bullet to kill 1 enemy,or more if grouped together.
---
Now it takes 4 shots while sneaking to kill the same enemy. 
---
owning obviously duped items is just as bad as duping. you deserve your ban
---
it is also retcon, not the REPCONN test site in new vegas.
---
Speaking of issues with bulks, can anyone else not bulk circuits, black titanium, and others? Am I just missing recipes for those? 
---
Faking 200 hours of footage, some of it including myself, seems like a major undertaking, when he could just spend another 60 bucks and buy a new copy instead.  ... Just saying. 
---
You are in the minority i liked your thread i agree but the problem is the 5 threads below yours saying the same thing but differently worded
---
I‚Äôve found if you log out while wearing it, there‚Äôs a glitch that gives you +100 carry weight until the next time you exit the power armor.  If you need that extra 100, it‚Äôs good to utilize via a server hop
---
Or what?
---
If they don't give answers TODAY, what happens? Enquiring minds want to know.
---
if their handling of the original beta means anything, they'll just ignore the feedback that comes from a new beta server. 
---
So you would agree that under the same logic a melee build being able to oneshot things could also use the same nerfing treatment?
---
You use the connector end that faces down and it will stick through the floor and make use of the radiator but realize they only power about half the area of a connector attached to a wall. My camp is 3x3 and I needed 4 radiators to get power throughout. I have hundreds of hours using the conduit in FO4 and at least 20-30 in 76. A shame I'm on PC but I'll help anyone who needs it there, Trillian69 on PC. It's the year I was born before all the trolls weigh in.
---
You know I would have thought it'd start after the end of this month but given where we are now, even March seems unrealistic.
---
Yeah, the mods are random. Only plans are fixed, but some people are saying that a couple plans are still random. There was a post about heavy CA plans only appearing in parts
---
It shows who uses this dirty tricks and exploits and who doesn't. People been complaining about the nerfs but everyone who didn't use it is completely fine
---
Cool down man, he said he reported it **again** yesterday, they will fix them.
---
I see that. I started a couple of perma alts and I guess that real new players must be very confused these days.
---
 Exploring many areas, you can find level 1/9 mobs or level +60 mobs, depending of the level of the "fellas" around‚Ä¶ 
---
This is most likely going to get down-voted into oblivion by the people mentioned.. forgot to say that up front lol.
---
Every update fixes something
---
Can I has your stuff?
---
i have not owned this item, was it obtainable legally in game?
---
If it was a Dev room items it may have been stripped from the game completely.
---
Slap damage is actually lethal to me as I'm running on low life build...
---
Broken since day one. You know beth doesn't care about those they are to busy on a duper witch hunt and ban hammers they have no persons to fix it. Your response time for a fix will be in 1000 years.
---
I bet you see the world in matrix code! What does a rainbow look like in numbers?!

A 2070, and a 1080ti should do the job.

How is your Toyota a Suburu also?

My SO plays gun rush non-stop, so there's definitely people who love it. She won't even play story mode or do anything else but gun rush, she's got like over 2k in cash just from it.  
---
If you need help in red dead online, getting money and xp, check out /r/RedDeadGuides I made it just for that purpose. Of course I do recommend that since it's in beta, play with friends if you don't want to get bored because the content that is there can be exhilarating and it is repeatable. I recommend Showdown Large, I love that mode.
---
No, I mean effectively destroying the ability to become any kind of large scale vendor. Nerfing TSE Weapons into oblivion(they needed a nerf don‚Äôt get me wrong) while not addressing the inherent and ridiculous bullet sponginess of their end game enemies. Removing the xp you used to get from ghouls at white springs. I agree duping screws up the server, but they couldn‚Äôt they just dupe on one character until it got to 1500 and then switch and do it more? Why punish us who haven‚Äôt done anything??
---
Just gather springs, bro. Quit whining about the whiners. No time for that now.

Right?!
---
Not a stupid question at all!  (being sincere).  There is a small "glitch" that has been there since day one of the game, that if you exit the game in your excavator pa, the next time you login to a game, you will have an addition 100 carry weight.  If you get out of the power armor and then hop back into it during your time on that server, it will go back to the original carry weight it is suppose be.  
---
I'll have what you're having.
---
What's the problem now?

Way to not back your thesis up with any supporting evidence. It's like you wanted to write a proper essay but not really put the work in.

I think you're on to something!
---
L O L
---
you brave brave soul.... 
---
Are you perked into rifles or explosives?
---
Because they listened to a bunch of Redditors demanding frequent patches and declaring that Bethesda has abandoned the game and most tragically the players themselves.
---
That's the modern gaming crowd and it's why the last ten here's have been a shitshow for us as consumers. Way too many people defending companies and buying their products out of stupidity, brand loyalty, blind emotion, or all of the above. 
---
The current video game industry just a cesspool of miserable anti-consumerism.

Fair, and there are allot of them, and total transparency I literally cannot play the game due to yesterday's patch...  So I'm not far away from one of those posts, but after spending a couple hours here and on BethNet, some of the gripes have weight / validity.

I'll concede however, it is turning into an echo chamber.

---
what is  the negative effect of losing 4 intelligence from marsupial? i dont craft weapons or armor so.....really if you lose points from your special it should be you cant use all your perks because now your specials have dropped
---
They have a megathread on r/fallout. I see you are upset so I'm happy. You weren't having a discussion, you were shit posting. Sorry? 
---
No, it‚Äôs the people who have collected stuff to sell‚Äôs problem. Dupers can still dupe, and will continue to dupe, this patch changed nothing. But go on, half of this community is complaining and half of it is duper witch hunts nowadays
---
Damn i got bored on the fifth day...
---
Vendor sold jetpack for x01 and i stood in a puddle for all the mutations...that was it.  I mean i had explosive shotgun but i was so utterly disgusted, ashamed, embarrassed, and overall mind blown a company would be so stupid and ignorant to leave something like that in the game.
---
I honestly could not believe it, it was like every attempt to justify anything about the game was erased because of how lazy it looked to leave a broken mechanic from a previous game into a new online one.   Pathetic.
---
the varying carry weight was wild. at one over could carry over 550 when normally my max is 305. 
---
Wow, I've got to admit the analogy is sound 
---
Just a thought. This has been a problem after the last patch was released. I'm thankful that Bethesda is working towards fixing things, but do they even test a patch before releasing it...do they play this game on each platform at all to see if there are problems...do they realize releasing a patch premature like they do is very detrimental to the community, players and their companies image for future releases...
---
The fps in interior  cells has gone back to absolute shit again, which was something they fixed in the hotpatch on patch 4.... interiors are a no go for me  until it's fixed again.
---
They said they are hot fixing it either end of the week or early Monday 
---
Wow nice very convincing argument 
---
Damn fucking right. We need to stop making excuses and expect quality and communication. Right now it is their PR campaign to limit their exposure because every time they open their mouths they get burned again because they arent ready to deliver.
---
We need a fucking come to jesus moment if we expect this to turn around. Its an admission of fault, an acknowledgment of what they are lacking, and an active engagement with full transperency between end user and designer to produce something better. 
---
That is the only format of the future i will accept going forward. Anything deviating from that is wrong. Tolkien engagement that we've been gettin is a facade. There is not anything that is really being addressed or changed. The priorities and motives that we've seen thus far have all been malicious in the end. 
---
In life if you dig yourself 7 feet under, it tends to take 4 times the work to get back up to 0.
---
Anyone else having troubles fast traveling even when their weight is under the limit? Everytime I try it says i'm over encumbered when I clearly am not.
---
Add this to the list of "anti-consumer practices"...Somewhere there's a team of lawyers planning a class action. If you don't get this resolved, I bet THEY'LL respond to your email...
---
In any case, I hope you get your stuff back.
---
Camden Park, but it's pricey! They wanted 5500 caps for the calibrated shocks and that's with 9 charisma &amp; maxed hard bargain. 
---
Yes, had it affect my speed and jumping on separate occasions.  I have not seen the cw fluctuations yet. 
---
 The game was rigged from the start. 
---
You should reset our S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points since you changed perks. Or at least give us that option.
---
Here is to hoping you have better luck next time :)
---
It's south of the Nuka Cola Plant. 
---
Well obviously, I'd say 60-95% owned either a explosive effect weapon or two shot weapon as their main or then the combination of those two. Now all range damage is totally ruined and normal NON LEGE pump with best mods and shotgun cards is doing more damage that TWO SHOT EXPLOSIVE 50 cal :D or any other ts/e range weapon for that matter. 
---
my tse shotgun went from 700 dmg down to 200 dmg. .but it is still the most powerful gun iv ever had..
---
ok, but 10? how big is this handguard, how tiny are the gears?
---
I'm a teacher and I needed this giggle.  Thanks.  üòÇ
---
What are they going to say?  
---
"Oopsie"?
---
Kudos for making it this far, I didn't even make it into 2019
---
This is on all platforms
---
I had this same issue on Xbox today. Several mobs either locking up and becoming a prop in the world that couldn‚Äôt be looted or monsters dying and disappearing into the ground or other objects. 
---
I was thinking they either added a zero to the left or forgot a K on the right, 7600 hours is 316 days 16 hrs of non stop play. I am a gaming addict and have been off work since before the beta and figured at the rate I've played, roughly 500 hrs as of now, it would take me 5-6 years of playing. For me this is not outside the realm of possibility but across all the games from Bethesda I have played it barely adds up to half that amount, I might be close to that number over all my games played.
---
I was.
---
Yup. Enjoy the full price I paid for one of your games, because it's the last time I do.
---
Yes, but it's hard to keep faith, especially for example in my case, when most of the bugs we've been trying to get them to fix could be taken care of by a good MO in an afternoon.

/r/LoneVaultWanderer  Can you fix how my Quad Salavaged Assaultron head does 0 damage if charged and used in stealth? It easily goes 4000 damage but it bugs out and doesnt kill anything.

Also Salvaged Assaultron heads put all your fusion cells in the "left column" when you first equip it.

And yeah it's no secret that sales are down in relation to other fallout games that's not to say it's "terrible" in and of itself...
---
Right now it's the 2nd highest played rpg in x1 more than fo4 Skyrim the Witcher ect
---
And sales of cosmetic items esp expensive ones is not a good way to judge a game sales or the quality of a game (Warframe is a great game but let's not judge it based on how much plat is bought) 
---
Where is the game 15 bucks? Most likely PC versions of 3rd party sites that bought too many copies and now trying to unload them?
---
Cuz at Walmart near my house it's still 60
---
And the atom shop is expensive too expensive imo but if you think BETHESDA needs money you're have bigger problems than a game update (you REALLY think the makers of the elder scrolls and fallout or the publishers of DOOM or prey Dishonored the evil within need money) again all cosmetic and is also what is going to pay for dlcs and support

And it appears you supported the scummy shit up until today so get over yourself hypocrite

no but most likely just running a broken perk build, see edit above, I am sure they will fix Melee, soon.

Until level 100 (when i had spent 50 levels with a discord i liked)

Everything was kind of ok.

but now. Theres no quests left. I spend the majority of my time doing One Violent Night, Uranium Fever and Enclave Events.

Everything else is boring. Ive been to every location. Found every holotape worth listening, read terminals, joined all factions, but its over and done.

I love NV and 3 over Fo4

but Fo4 took me longer to complete than 76. It took me way longer to do 3/NV than 76 and the stories and world i created thru my actions were more engaging

Especially when id say my last 20-30 hours have been just making sure i have 5000 .50 and 5mm for my Nuke Runs...when they do happen.
---
I can guarantee you dupers didn't just focus on TSE. They made copies of everything and anything. 
---
if you just want to have the last word that's fine. but I'll warn you I'm enough of an asshole to wait a couple years before replying again.
---
You're not the first to declare this wrongly and I'm sure you won't be the last.
---
Keep at it. One day you might be right.
---
Yeah PC and I am running that mod. I'll pop it off and see what happens. Thanks!
---
&gt;This community has been fighting since day one to make it a great game, 
---
Well, that's their problem. Developers make the game. Players can give feedback and have a minor influence of how the game come out, but like 95%-99% from it comes from developers.
---
&gt;and that part of the fight has come to an end for me. 
---
I semi-like these threads popping up particularly now. I'm glad you realize your place and a futility and irrelevancy of this "fight". There is no fight. 
---
It's a game, that's it. Not a religion, not a movement, not lifestyle tring or anything else like that. You either like it, you play it, you don't like it, you don't play it. That's simple. Things in between get messy.
---
If you theorectically like it, if in practice you WANT to like but don't, then if you cling onto it, possibly playing a bit possibly not playing(always better), it's only going to get worse. You aren't going to gradually start liking it if you cling onto it.
---
Throwing in my bugs I haven't seen mentioned yet (PC):
---
One of my weapons keeps getting unfavorited/hotkeyed. I think it's happening when I log out with it equipped, but I'll have to test more.
---
The number pad power switch pylon is bugged allowing anyone to flip the switch, making the keypad irrelevant.
---
Weird shadows follow characters like they did in the early days.
---
Microphone channels have trouble working properly. I was on area chat and my friend was on auto and we could not hear each other despite neither of us being on any teams.
---
I hope this helps! And Bethesda folks, if y'all ever need a respite from the storm, we would love for y'all to visit us over at r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
I have a fellow ModAuthor who's been sitting waiting for a response to his banning for closing on 6? Weeks..  
---
Sometimes People are not being heard in a timely manner
---
Youtubers are downvoting you?   
---
Also, you just made a post about how Bethesda is a cult using Fallout 76 to manipulate our emotions on a mass scale. I think you might actually, legitimately, be a moron. Or an idiot. Probably both. 
---
how many times can you replay FO4...like move on. there are other games you dont have to replay the same game over and over and over
---
Your stash is full and they fixed the carry weight exploit.
---
Warframe has open flight...
---
There are two massive open worlds now where you use the Archwing to traverse exactly like Anthem.
---
I can understand couples, family members, friends enjoying fo76 together. Helping each other using particular set of skills: armorer, weaponsmith, camp builder/repairs, food... FO76 is an incredible multiplayer game. I hope Bethesda can soon realize that a game about rebuilding america begins with players helping each other.
---
The heavy bobbie pins are back
---
Ooohhh, idea!!
---
Multiple ways to earn a military certificate?
---
‚òÜHOLOTAPE minigame: Battleship/chess style arcade game, that you must win 2of3 rounds.
---
Earn"Military tactician" certificate.
---
‚òÜCRAFTING minigame: using only what's found on-site, you must scrap, craft a pipe weapon with a scope, shoot x6 long distance targets, once in scope, and once hip-fire
---
(maybe have them in the trees, on the corner of the building roof, etc.)
---
Earn "Military sharpshot" certificate.
---
‚òÜENDURANCE/SKILL minigame: you must be able to run full tilt for a minimum set time, then stay underwater for set time (aquaboy/girl allowed ;) ) then complete 30 "jumping jacks" while overencumbered in a set time.
---
Earn "Junior Commando" certificate.
---
The original assault course could be adjusted to earn "Infantryman WV" certificate.
---
Earn all 4 certificates and unlock a crafting ability maybe? Ballistic weave anyone?
---
Just a few thoughts on adding variety and challenge to the whole thing. Feedback welcome :)
---
I have since found it was from the dev room, an unreleased item. So it will be back in a future patch I guess, or an ATOM shop item.
---
They made it so you just had to be more active in farming and craft and thats the end of the world?
---
Yeah, I got the game 2 weeks after it came out, and I have been level 135...for a month.
---
Went back to mass effect since I'm bored of this game.
---
The massive TSE damage decrease was yet another nail in the coffin, since I use those weapons exclusively. 
---
Priming* sorry
---
What do YOU call removing criticism? Clearly the moderator here is trying to control the dialogue by removing any comments. The word 'bashing' is a term used by fan-boys and people trying to prevent the real situation from being shown to potential consumers. We all need to start multiple forums to ensure that the censorship stops. I am aware that a number of threads have been removed which are critical to Bethesda, this needs to be discussed in the greater media.  
---
That's your problem. Should have went with a Vega.
---
I got the same issue with my bulks and also a got another issue: my camp turrets rocket launcher won't target nothing
---
Once a week?  I demand once an hour &gt;:(
---
I'll give that a shot if it's not caused by the Save My Stuff mod. But you are probably correct based on Bethesdas track record thus far.
---
I made it to level 113 i basically farm for legendary weapons now i see my two shot weapons now do over a hundred less damage i am really disappointed in this game now all my hard work in game was pretty much a waste of time and i am probably not going to play any more i generally liked the game but now im just done with it im not mad just really disappointed 
---
Yeah its obnoxious when it happens and it happens all too often.
---
Adding content? They will be introducing PVP servers, same content, but will probably take another 6 months for balancing. You know...nerfing the melee weapons, saving the best nerf for the last!
---
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sXRybYQPdvw/maxresdefault.jpg
---
Your statement was on critiquing a game, not difference of opinions. I don't give a fuck what your opinion is, but when you insult others for having their own, that's an issue.
---
Sounds better than just ruining all the money and time we've all spent getting a weapon we were happy with. #Fallout76boycott untill Bethesda takes notice of all the players who quit!!!
---
This is a great thread \^\^ Loving this kind of communication, Bethesda &lt;3
---
Looting killed sentrybots at Whitespring says you‚Äôre getting 5.56 ammo. You do no actually get 5.56 ammo. It disappears from the metal pile, but never shows up in your inventory. 
---
Your statements are vindictive shit, by the way. Play the ball, not the man. If you have a legitimate argument, present it and leave the ad hominem to the high school kids. 
---
She does.
---
Agreed.
---
Yes
---
I took a comment in the context it was provided and showed you how it was flawed.  When you challenged me on it, I explained what was wrong with it and why it would cause others more grief.  You are choosing to ignore my POV on it and make all sorts of excuses.   Bottom line:  I wasn't attacking you.  I was telling you why you were saying wasn't a good solution.    People should be told about resource harvesting.  They should be told about junk and all the other types of harvesters they could build their camp near.  People don't need to be told to just look for junk piles because that will solve their problems.  It won't.   People writing to Bethesda in mass to make critical changes as early as possible to fix the broken parts of the game is what is important.   Giving people a bandaid that then makes life harder for OTHER people doesn't accomplish anything towards what should be the big picture goal.
---
In other words:  Your quality of life improvement for some is a quality of life killer for other people.  That is a bad idea.   Your efforts would be better spent any number of other ways.   There is a major down side to your advice.  It simply doesn't scale.  It is great advice to give to a friend.  It is terrible advice to give to the nearly 700 people that have upvoted you at this point.  When 700 people follow that advice and you can't place your camp anywhere near where you want on ANY server yet alone the server your friends are playing on and Bethesda still hasn't fixed any number of the myriad of problems maybe then you will see that your efforts and advice were misguided.
---
Stop the excuses and just get the point:  Your advice doesn't scale.  Your advice, in this one particular case, is going to alleviate one problem and directly cause another.   Taking 10 bucks out of your left pocket and putting 10 bucks in your right pocket doesn't make anyone any richer.
---
I think the moral of the story might sadly be...don't trust Bethesda to implement anything correctly. :(
---
Always hated that lock pick mini game, so tedious and boring.
---
nah, just a nerdy soul
---
I dealt 1000 damage with my TSE shotgun. Now it's like half that. They fucking ruined everything. 
---
 To every 200 IQ budd that spent 60$ on a game that is being added as a free bonus to used pads shortly after the release - congratulations. ;) 
---
Don‚Äôt regret. You should be proud because you are woke 
---
not saying that at all, just seems that all the times I have read that as a response the issue it refers to never gets addressed. The OP is right, they seem to be ignoring the community that made them as big as they are. I have had a ticket open with Bethesda from Fallout 3 that is still open, gave up on it years ago but it points to how much they are willing to do and listen once a game is out in the wild.
---
There's also the fact if you toss on  the shocks (calibrated?) They each add 50 carry weight. So the starting up in excavator PA bonus is 200 over your natural limit. 
---
I'm starting to feel they have left the game in the hands of the freshman dev squad.
---
  I feel in the eyes of Bethesda upper management they are in a position that it may be financially more beneficial to to make some half hearted attempts to fix the game.  Fail but at least make what from the outside would appear to be a attempt.
---
Release pvp content  that a strong portion of the community doesn't seem to want.  Not to mention if they do what they have planned will likely be a heavily flawed content release.
---
If that is the direction they are heading it allows them to fulfill legal obligations of content release, while at the same time saying hey not enough people are playing let's walk away.
---
The sooner FO76 becomes history the sooner they can move resources to new hopefully financially rewarding projects.
---
Why, it's gonna get nerfed anyway.
---
Then breaks something else lol
---
I've had this (or something similar) since release - it'll sometimes show \[caution\] or \[danger\] when it shouldn't until I fast travel or relog, but in my experience, it's purely a visual bug and doesn't affect my stealth. It does seem to be happening more often since the patch, but for all I know I might just be paying more attention to it. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø On PS4, either way.
---
I'm the collector sort so no matter what I did I was going to go for every plan but at least when I started I could do fun things WHILE I grinded for caps. It seems like since they've been so busy trying to fix their mistakes that they've added no new content so the game has been getting stale for me. This latest patch undoing a lot of the other bug fixes has kinda cemented my wanting to leave.
---
Meh pretty late to realise that but late better than never 
---
As I understand the map locator doesn't show up if you are in sneak mode, the nameplate is a whole different thing that should be addressed though. I don't have any experience of PvP other then 1 wanted player I killed while I was wanted but that seems to be unfair.
---
Try 2020. It'll either be in a good place or it'll be shut down. Either way is better than the current state it's in.
---
I never got the motion sickness feeling, until I bought a new TV the other day. Played for 20 mins and realized I was getting light-headed. 
---
Because my old TV didn't render too well for the FoV, I didnt notice motion blur and distance draw fuzziness. But now it's right there, making me feel nauseous, damned technology and it's beautiful pixels!!
---
I agree with you, however I'm still going to be playing. regardless of what you think they're going to continue to work on the game of course. so my suggestion to you is just wait a while until the game is more developed and something more playable. I can definitely respect them going down on your list of respected companies but I wouldn't give up on the company all together. They've made many more good games and they have bad ones. At least in my opinion
---
You can bet you ass it will 
---
It's not, atleast the fixes we've been been providing them, many are literal copy and paste operations, and they are ignoring us.
---
It was both. For being a level 45 shotgun, it‚Äôs not bad at all... er was. I haven‚Äôt looked at the gun in a long time sans perk cards. I‚Äôm just salty as hell because I busted my scrawny butt for a long time to have a decent weapon. 
---
The whole game is a Grognak game right now. Grognak see enemy, Grognak smash enemy with banjo.
---
&gt;  as you age you will no longer be able to do everything that you could when you were young. This is reality. Your feelings are irrelevant.
---
Are you stupid?  We're talking about a video game here.  Who's talking about changing any rules?  It's about adjusting functionality, to help accommodate a larger playerbase.  Much like how some developers include modes for people with color blindness.   
---
Jesus, you should change your name to Totalcancer.
---
One of the biggest issues I have seen with heavy weapons is ammo vs dmg vs repair ratios. This is compounded with a few things like rate of fire mods and perks. There are plenty semi-auto rifles/pistols the do much higher dmg and if you click fast enough, you can poor out higher dmg than a full auto variant than same ammo type variants. Compounding this with the perk that repairs weapons only working per trigger pull, and the semi autos will last 20x longer. 
---
Weapons like the minigun do insanely low dmg while the gatling gun does something like 6x the dmg per round. While the minigun does fire much faster, it does not make up for the massive waste of ammo, and significantly lower overall dmg when you start adding up the bonus dmg mods and perks vs the rate of fire mods.
---
Hope that is specific enough.
---
Just like what happens with FO4 CC 
---
With the cap limit on the vendors, and 'back 2 patches ago' when you could do raids on a nuked white springs, you couldn't offload valuable items fast enough. I certainly offloaded items to a mule character for storage until vendors reset.  And I wasn't alone.  Matthew's mule was my go-to guy for crap I needed to sell but no one had the caps for. 
---
I've only seen people say it *wasn't* credit cards but was addresses for a small number of people.
---
Still a massive fuck up but your comment seems to be very much in disagreement with that. Any proof? I dont want credit cards obviously. We have to ask because there's so much disinformation atm.
---
Do you even know how "parrot" is supposed to be used as an insult? Not because they repeat the same thing over and over, but when they repeat things other people say to them without understanding them.
---
Like your use of the word "parrot" for example.
---
I think a lot of us have been just as active, maybe moreso, and none of us are getting paid for it. Actually on the contrary...
---
I can still see distant weather systems across the horizon from my deck
---
Meh, I don't really care. You obviously do, since you keep taking the bait. This sub is trash, overrun by whiny, entitled, broflake brats. It's fun to get y'all worked up over nothing.
---
It's a video game, brah. Your defense of the community filled with a page full of "I Quit" and "This game sucks" threads is not only laughable, but entirely full of shit. *This* is your safe space, broflake, embrace it and own it.
---
I'm gonna go back to enjoying the game.
---
Hi All,  A hotfix will be available to address this late this week or early next week.    
---
You can see more info on the upcoming hot patch [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alie1l/hotfix_coming_for_issues_introduced_in_patch_5/)
---
You'd be amazed how many melee builds that have been applauding the TSE nerf are likely running around in duped armor with duped a Super Sledge.
---
Shouldn't be hard for the devs since some modder already made that. Just look at "Known Plans", community has been asking it for months, but Beth can only implement it right after a modder created it.
---
I think durability or a entire Ballistic and Energy gun damage buff is needed.
---
Ballistics are pretty weak without legendary
---
Energy is pitiful with and without
---
ok be honest now, how much bethesda pays you and for how many months you work for them?
---
Sorry.. No company has the right to confiscate objects you've paid for and completed a contract on, regardless of what services you may subscribe to with said object.  
---
That is theft. 
---
Just quit nerf was necessary.
---
Should have grabbed more popcorn for this shitshow since I ate all watching Anthem burns 
---
Playing every day for 3 hours is pretty damn dedicated, and more than I could safely allot at the moment. Great that you had a good experience.
---
I've observed the game through others funnily enough. My only issue here is that you act as if issues effecting the majority of players are non issue to you, because you've avoided them. How would you feel in the opposite perspective? Let's say AMD performance is abysmal, would you still have the same outlook? Now that your experience is crippled? Or would you just be happy for those who can play it bug free without complaint? Try to think of the broader experience of others instead of just your own, it helps a lot. Perspective is key.
---
&gt;**Dev note:** Player request unclear - all X-01 mods now autoscrap for steel ahead of any other resource, including unbulked steel scraps.
---
I‚Äôve got an eye on this game(waiting for more content and price to drop), and every time I check back to see how the game is doing, it is worse than before. 
---
It fucking happens it's literally a joke in the programming world "99 bugs in the program 99 bugs in the program take one down patch it around 164 bugs in the program" programmers looking at the code is both the scariest and most intriguing thing ever because at some point you know that programmer thought maybe if i sacrifice a goat to it it might work 
---
See, *this* bug is the one Bethesda should have all hands on deck for, but it always gets buried by this sub's freakout of the week demanding their attention. Bloody nice work, mate. \*thumbs up\*
---
It‚Äôs very clear they haven‚Äôt put very much thought into this game outside of the perk system and camps....must be Minecraft players

---
My friend and I quit playing fallout 76. Made the decision to get red dead. Best decision I made this year. It was fun for a little bit. Should have bought red dead first. Oh well. Maybe they'll fix it. 
---
This is minor, but I'm going to ping /u/Ladydevann and /u/LoneVaultWanderer just to make those folks know about it.
---
Lol they should pay me for how many hours I‚Äôve spent playing that busted game. 
---
So demolition needed a nerf because of TSE?
---
Demolition nerf killed every other explosive weapon. You guys just want to pretend that everyone who is upset is some TSE duper. Always blame the players, never Bethesda. 
---
No it wasn‚Äôt there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a level 50 one-shotting level 80 enemies. 
---
Couldn‚Äôt have said it better
---
And cheaters and dupers make the game suck. 
---
I've got zero sympathy for OP being a dupe-mule.
---
Say what?!  What about if someone has 1000 explosives bobbleheads?  Certainly that can be attained with good old fashion, wholesome exploring!
---
Let's say he is guilty.
---
He got banned not only from Fallout but from all SINGLEplayer games he have on their platform and this is illegal as he already paid for "service".
---
Yeah because it's a dumb post and you have to lie to make your argument. No one was two-shotting a SBQ without bobbleheads. And tell your buddy that there's a thing called dense chest armor and a perk called fireproof, and that PA is trash for PvP regardless of what weapon your enemy is using. 
---
As in the increase the card gives is little now, that‚Äôs what I mean by little buff I don‚Äôt really see how anything you said was really relevant 
---
I'll wait til nov 2019 and hopefully see the usual year 1 fix patch
---
It‚Äôs absurd that I have to repair my TS Handmade every hour with rank 5 Gunsmith and rank 3 Lucky Break slotted.  Mind you, I start with it at 200% durability.  This more than just the change to baseline TS damage. 
---
It's also a very minor issue that doesn't really affect gameplay which means it more than likely wasn't a priority. 
---
So your saying Vendor's Plans/Recipes original prices have been multiplied by some rate based on their previous Vendor rarity? Any chance that you are going to divulge what the rarity rate multipliers is? Because I noticed that Stimpack recipe that was 100% guaranteed at the enclave bunker is now ten times its original price (i.e. for my character the Stimpack recipe was 96 caps and now its 960 caps). So saying the prices were based off the original rarity of a vendor having a certain plan seems rather manipulative.
---
This hasn't been confirmed or denied by Bethesda but it seems if you did anything in the BETA that was not tracked for the challenges and doesn't look like they will retroactively fix it. An alternative theory is that the Overseer's mission isn't actually over yet and more is to come, sort of an ongoing thing to hook DLC to. **Would love for a dev or rep to comment on this.**
---
Should be commando, there was a good post last week about the merits of the 10mm smg and perks to use with it. Here it is:

So by this simplistic definition, are the following also cults?

Walmart (they take my money and I hate going there, so check and check)
---
That's just it your fix might work on the pc but it might not work on the playstation or the xbox or on this one graphic card
---
Played for several hours last night and had no drops. Some weirdness with a friend where I saw a Scorchbeast on the ground in one place and he saw it in another but that's about it. 
---
That‚Äôs for the recipe. The mod is about 450caps
---
That's the plan, not the mod.
---
Pardon the grammar errors, mobile phone and fat fingers 
---
Another thing causing items to disappear in addition to h-t-'s:   Mama Dolce's Feed The People hopper stole my chameleon armor piece roughly a week ago.   I was in the automatically filtered quest inventory screen where I am selecting items from the filtered inventory list to place in the hopper.  As I am clicking through the quest generated / quest specific items, all of a sudden my chameleon armor left leg piece shows up in the list for a moment.   Since I am hitting enter through the list, it ends up in the hopper.  The hopper doesn't show that it is in there because the hopper is also filtered, so I have no way of getting back the best piece of Chameleon armor I've seen in the game to date.  It had the best damage protection stats of any Chameleon piece I have had before.   I did some looking online and apparently this bug has been around since the Beta and still hasn't been fixed.   I was told that this was on the list to be fixed, but since you asked about disappearing items, I wanted to take a moment and make absolutely sure that this is getting taken care of.     Other's have claimed that taking damage while placing things in the hopper is what leads to this bug happening.  I don't think I was taking damage at the time, but I am not certain.
---
The difference here is that we never truly own software. What we buy is a license to use content
---
I think people are making too much about this last patch. Yeah it royally fucked up a lot of stuff but it's still not that bad. They're trying to fix the game, that's what we ALL need to take from this.
---
I mean I think they need to test their patches better, as well as make hot fix patches for important things (like that bit of the map that was off limits to anyone from last patch, or the bobby pin weight issue now) but they're still fixing stuff.
---
I'm not on Bethesda's side mind you. I call them Bugthesda for a reason...they're full of bugs. But did you expect anything different from them? Look at all their games. Full of bugs day one. Most of their games relied on modders to fix their bugs. We don't have modders to rely on this time round. So Bugthesda has to do it all on their own.
---
I'm not happy with their choices (bag gate, $20 skins...) and I'm not happy about this update (bobby pin weight, too many nerfs to perks) but it's not as bad as people are making it out to be.
---
Try R&amp;G station, south of whitesprings
---
I found all of mine there (3 total so far - grabbing for mates too, lol)
---
Thanks for the response. These were obvious bugs and we mostly assumed they would get fixed. I don't think this is what the bulk of the community was complaining about.  
---
So, I got one question.
---
Why do you hate us?
---
how do u expect a shotgun to have more damage than a mini nuke? 
---
I get your point, but your logic needs a buff.
---
Me too, thank god there a heap of real triple A games coming soon. 
---
Yeah it's garbage but without it how much "survival" would the game have been? Food/drink.
---
Definitely should have taken one from old games and made like weapons/armors capable of repairing each other.
---
Fallout: Miami is what I'm waiting on now. 
---
Hi All, A hotfix will be available to address this late this week or early next week.    
---
My TSE gauss saw a 80% reduction in damage. that is with all rifleman, Arm pen, demo expert perks.  I would change my build but Beth saw fit to NOT give players a full or even partial respec so players like me can change the current build to the one and only viable build now...melee.
---
Which will be hit by the Nerf bat with the next patch I am sure.
---
No they needed to fix the explosive weapons, when 3 level 50‚Äôs are killing the queen within 5 minutes there is a serious issue. Explosives needed the nerf.
---
You said ‚Äúthe little buff it adds to explosive weapons‚Äù my point was, the buff was not little, it was large. You have a dense mod equipped, or are you always so fucking stupid?
---
Been saying it since the game released that it is going to be a shitshow but people just believed it was a hivemind bullshit. I mean look at Bethesda's game trackrecord on fixing things. That's enough justification.
---
Wut?
---
I've been on two servers where the queen was nuked. First time, she died so fast, I didn't even have time to get there, second time, I was waiting with about a half dozen other players. I got one shot in with a sniper rifle before she died. less than a minute. No idea what those other players were using, I don't even have legendary weapons yet. 
---
In 2099 when they finally fix all the bugs correctly.
---
I wasn't actually there, but I decided to hop on for a few minutes and somebody dropped a nuke and killed her in about 5 minutes. I'm wondering if there's another damage exploit because there were only a few people there on the map
---
If it were a total, complete, and utter failure, you wouldn't have been able to play 3 characters to high levels.  Give credit where its due.  Yes, they've made some weird moves and its been pretty fucked up with regards to a lot of things, but don't sit here and call it a complete and utter failure when you played it enough to get 3 characters to high levels with decked out weapons and earned caps (which takes a lot of time).    
---
So sick of this outrage movement completely overshadowing all the good things that are to be had here (and there are plenty).    
---
You know what's a complete and utter failure?  Halflife 3.  Not this.
---
FO76 is bad press, a game which shall not be named!
---
&gt;I stuck up for Bethesda even after the continuous mess ups they kept doing (dark rum, canvas bag, the tarp leather jacket). 
---
The hell are these even related? If Hitachi releases a shitty excavator which engine requires constant repairs, how the hell does it prevent you from enjoying your magic wand?
---
Thanks bud, if we can only get them to even look out way, and start taking the fixes we are trying to give them!
---
Wonderful. Thank you.
---
is that the fusion generator?..id like to.build one but its too ezpensive to keeep repairing everyday after my base is attacked
---
Why not undo the Tse changes? 
---
Pass it over here when you‚Äôre done 
---
Understandable. People are waiting for patches, because they are the only hope for the game, and when the it suckerpunches you like this, it's rather hard to stay cool.
---
I used to play right after the maintenance, now I haven't login since the disaster, just because of what I've read here on reddit. So I guess it's a two week break from the game?

That's the ideal way to handle it, but consider the case where unittest is bundled with the fix. If there's a merge error and a feature branch gets reverted, it's possible the unitest also goes away and it will look like everything is passing. Not saying there's not better ways to handle that (like put your tests in a different repo), but it's certainly possible.
---
What? 
---
Because you're totally not a duper, you just happened to find 52,000 TSE weapons, 1,000,000 Stimpacks and 50k of each of the Fluxes. Why is Bethesda so unfair to lucky people?
---
Yeah, not gonna happen. 
---
My guess is they were trying to reduce server hopping.
---
... the buff was large now it is little, I am talking about now clearly 
---
Go the Whitesprings fountain and drink the water. It is rumored to cure you.
---
The sad part is Bethesda could release one good game and every one would forget about their mistakes. The worse part is, is that probably won‚Äôt happen.
---
Solo player. I haven't played in about a month-- just check the sub for updates. I've no inclination to return based on the game's current direction. \*shrug\*
---
Not at all, this is serious!
---
TSE got nerfed to shit, range weapons ruined. Demo card nerf was uncalled for, literally NO-ONE asked for it. TSE nerf should have been ts stays the same but explo from 100 to 25. Still best lege effect as they should be, but more on par with other stuff. Melee still doing 15k dmg tho ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è TSE lever after patch... 160 dmg.. deathclaw Gauntlet 250+ no melee perks equipped :D
---
Even after all the crap Bethesda is doing these posts are still literally every few hours and still result in an easy karma farm. These posts are the reason why the atom store is updated and is the most stable part of the game. 
---
Take a look at task manager &gt; Performance &gt; GPU 0 and GPU 1 while the game is running.  Pre-Patch my GPU0 3D was 90-100%, now it's split across both GPUs.
---
Completed it  about the same time as launch. 3-5 mins to spare. Less lag. Bunch of melee guys and some heavy guns.
---
The power armor station going on the roof bug in camp is back.
---
Also I haven't tested this fully but I found legendary mobs are running away from me. They are at full health and just flee when I approach. I have to chase them to kill them depending on their speed.  It's happened in and around Watoga.  I've seen a scorched, robot and super mutant do it so far.
---
I could only see melee builds be able to kill her that fast since now even a tse dragon can do less damage than a strong strike from a super sledge in power armor with the right perk cards.
---
2 kills out of 2 prime nukes last night. But it's ridiculous how much more ultracite .50 cal I'm burning to do it. Before, below 20% health my bloodied explosive prime .50 cal was pushing about 630 damage per shot (not counting anti-scorched bonus) with maxed all heavy gunner perks, stabilized, grenadier, and demo expert, plus adrenal reaction. Now, the same conditions show the gun putting out about 270 damage per shot. I'm better off just using a speedy receiver and martial artist on the gatling gun, not to mention no need to farm metric fucktons of violet flux.
---
I think the plan is advanced power connectors. Gives you a conduit that sticks through walls
---
Yes it is.
---
Wow I seen two posts. One of them said they found it from sunnytop station
---
No man's sky is good now? What changes did they make?
---
Console must be absolutely screwed or something, because on PC I've never had many of the things people claim are wrong with the game happen.
---
I see people say what you're saying, but I see a very different picture. In fact I don't think I've ever seen a game updated as frequently as this one.
---
I'm a mod author and have released mods for Xbox.  
---
The core mechanics for some of the engines operations are the same acrossed the board.  
---
When it comes to how the graphics are handled, and the textures packed and unpacked it's different, but the nuts and bolts of X = Y is the same regardless of PC/Xbox/PS
---
This update and outrage is about so so much more than two shot explosive weapons. We all new TSE was getting nerfed. It‚Äôs not a surprise and that isn‚Äôt why people are mad. People are mad because they fucked their game further than it could ever be fucked at this point.
---
You use that then attach it to (regular) wall conduits and wire your house that way. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can help you do it
---
Do you think they're doing this via the Mothman?  Let's go down this rabbit hole together.
---
It‚Äôs clear use context and I am the asshole? You are the guy who started trying to be funny with personal insults    ‚Äò‚Äô dense mod blahblah‚Äô‚Äô 
---
&gt;Hotfix coming for issues introduced in Patch 5
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer could you please acknowledge this issue so we could at least know that the stealthy boy mark iii will be fixed in the future? 
---
Eyyyyy but you still do 15k dmg with melee tho ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è use the gauntlet for the dog, watch out you done one shot the queen as you swing
---
That's just silly, someone can see find enjoyment in a game they've played for thousands of hours why should they move on. Mods are the reason I play fallout which I why I never bought 76. Mods only add to the content increasing replayability and they're reason I'm currently replaying Fo3
---
I don't even know how to respond.
---
I can't even laugh. 
---
It's embarrassing to have defended this game.
---
Each of the devs would has their own build of the game where they worked on whichever bugs and issues they were fixing.  If the issues some of them were working on weren't dependent on using the most up to date release build their individual builds could have used old versions without impacting the issues they were working on.
---
Individually each of their dev builds would have been working as intended when they each tested them, the error came when those different builds and versions were merged to combine all of their individual fixes and someone's old version overwrote the fixes from the newer version.
---
Wow much appreciation for the extensive details on the topic. Did a great job and created a lot of insight. I'd recommend you create a video and convert this into audio.
---
Props on all these ideas it took forever to scroll to the bottom on mobile reading all these XD
---
*Dev: We heard you and understand you had to repair your weapons several times during a SBQ fight. In the near future, we will be implementing "emergency workshops". You will be able to summon it using flare guns. A vertibot will then drop a weapon workbench at your desired location. Now you will be able to fix your weapons without needing to run away from scorched to fast travel back to your C.A.M.P.*
---
Honestly, I don't think they are going to buff the durability...
---
you're joking, right? the only reason why I come to this sub is because it's one of the last active Fo76 communities. I dislike reddit culture in general, it's too cringy and overrun with positivity instead of objectivity.
---
at least now you seem to understand that snowflakes and and safe spaces go hand in hand though, so my job here is done.
---
that happens to really stupid posts like yours.
---
So we‚Äôre going to stick to the demo expert nerf? Tse needed a nerf but the grenades, missle launchers, fat man didn‚Äôt imo. Glad you fixed the bobble heads btw! That was a huge headache for pvp. 
---
PVE just feels unbalanced as my all rise with 8 pts slugger does over double damage as my tse anti armor dragon with 9 pts rifleman and 5 pts demo expert. I suppose you could lower enemies health or something or nerf melee too and we‚Äôll just run from everything. 
---
Please revert demolition expert and keep tse nerfs. 
---
I apologize for that. I still play MGS5 but I couldn‚Äôt find any other example since I never played No Man‚Äôs Sky
---
I doubt they will be. They would be max Automatron size, probably less. Few terminal entries and holotapes, mostly it will be some repeatably event thing, probably larger and more involved than any current repeatable events. They have to be repeatable, since most everything else is.
---
Same
---
Make a post on LFG or a trading community and ask someone to let them kill you 10 times in exchange for some caps.
---
Great that the only viable build now is melee. If you went into a gun build despite knowing how underwhelming the majority are you need to Respec. But you would need another 40-50 levels to do that. So no thanks.
---
Die hard here as well, Agree 100%. 
---
These issues have been here since fo4 for sure.  I grinded until i got an explosive shotty, then an AR.  I actually even stopped using them in fo4 because it was not a challenge even in survivor mode.  
---
My problem with the nerf was that it nerfed the 2 best affixes by 75%, AND nerfed the perk by another 40%. this is a major over reaction.  
---
That, and the fact that melee is now the only high damage build.  (dont worry, they will nerf melee next)
---
I am happy that the community is so pissed.  hopefully people follow through and stop playing  in protest....problem is that it is hard to get people to return once they've left.  
---
Major fuck up on bethesdas part.  i sleep a little better knowing that this was all a paid beta for skyrim 76.  (1000%)
---
Will do, I generally had moderate usage on both GPU's (watching movies while playing on the secondary set of screens) but I'll look more closely.  
---
Good news however, there is theoretically a fix, on my mobile so limited, but if you google the *.ini edits for assigning GPU usages for Fallout 4, those same edits work in '76, and again in theory, it should work.
---
Best of luck to him, then.
---
It isn't just heavy weapons and energy weapons.   All ranged weapons need to be properly balanced.   No fully upgraded weapon at the highest level should be "useless" but many of them are completely and utterly useless.  It shouldn't take lucky rolls of legendary effects to make a weapon usable.   The legendary rolls should be ON TOP of an already good functioning gun.     Please emphasize to the dev team that they need to be looking at ALL weapons across a wide variety of level ranges.   The 50 cal is one of the most disgustingly underpowered guns of the projectile varieties, but it by no means is the only one.  
---
A 50 cal bullet has 4 to 6 times the amount of energy than a 308 bullet, yet in the game the 50 cal does less damage.  A 50 cal should have tons of range and better accuracy.  It should be more expensive to craft and a slower rate of fire.  A suppressed 308 should be quieter and easier to hide than a suppressed 50 cal.   Suppressing a 50 cal should help but be harder to hide at really close ranges.   A 50 cal should have a lot more "base" armor penetration than a 308 does.  Mods should be able to improve both guns so that when fully modded at the highest level they drop they bring the pain, but the 50 cal should do more damage even then than the 308.   That's just one weapon that is out of line.   Pretty much all ranged weapons were useless at higher levels because they don't output enough damage unless you had a good combination of legendary effects.
---
The devs really need to look at games like Destiny / Destiny 2 for weapon balance.  I'm not asking them to be copied, but rather just see that as you go through the game the weapons actually keep up with you.  Fallout 76 needs its own version of that where weapons can keep up.
---
&gt; Do the devs even play the game at all?
---
They nerfed goddamn Licensed Plumber. I'm not even mad about the perk being worse, with it already being not even worth considering (unless you really want to roleplay being dirt poor italian plumbers who just have hard-ons for pipe-themed things) but I wouldn't even have that on a list of potential things to look at nerfing; I'd certainly have it on the list of things to nerf on April Fool's day as a shitty joke though.
---
They could've buffed it to make pipe weapons literally indestructible and I'd guess it would be at least kinda neat that you don't have to bother with that inconvenience if you actually really like using them despite being objectively inferior to basically all the other non-joke weapons (and by that I don't mean Rolling Pin gag weapons but Flamer's and laughably shit-tastic weapons that literally don't even last a full minute of uninterrupted use without weapon artisan and multiple durability degradation compensating perks). But even then I'd call it a joke to label it as an "overperforming" perk when it only applies to one of the weakest rifle/revolver type weapons in the game.
---
You forgot to finish making the game before release.
---
I feel that needs to be passed along several chains of communication.
---
i am sorry XD... i didnt expected 40.000 restriction i hope you will comment more about my work please be a good critic :D
---
Already a member! Very excited to be my own iron Man.
---
Booooo  hoooooo
---
Plenty of things to complain about in the recent update, the nerf to the overly-duplicated legendaries that werent even supposed to be common is not one of them.
---
He broke the ruled for bethesdas game service so he got banned from it.  This is not illegal and standard for all of the others.
---
Good bot
---
TSE needed to be addressed. Bethesda nerfed more than TSE, non legendary explosive builds got hit hard because they only looked at what The explosive perk card could do with TSE. Instead of making it so the card didn't effect legendary effects they instead gimped an already under performing build. AGLs, fatmen, missile launchers , grenades and mines all took a massive hit. Those weapons break easily cost to much to repair, ammo is scarce and expensive to craft and weight between 4-6 pounds. Those demolition man builds got screwed because they can't figure out how to fix their game. Not to mention the slewy of old bugs that have returned because of this patch as if they used an older build to work with instead of what was on the live servers.
---
Sure, I‚Äôve had a hell of a lot fun playing 76 and the bugs were never a huge deal to me, frustrating at times yes but not a deal breaker.
---
Bulking reduces weight on about 30-70% of the mats thank you very much.
---
Wha....what?
---
This was a bug with excavator power armor THREE PATCHES AGO....LOL so they really rolled back the bugs....it‚Äôs like. The update was an updated version of the original source without any of the other updates. WHOOPS.
---
Thanks! That‚Äôs a massive list. Looks like they are doing a hot fix late this week early next but I don‚Äôt expect many of them will be fixed as they only mentioned a few. 
---
Agree, really was a body blow, made me feel like tons of time was wasted getting these plans, when suddenly they were everywhere.
---
Considering Fallout is SUPPOSED to feel empty, but 76 is just TOO empty...
---
Don‚Äôt worry. They‚Äôll just fix this with Flex Tape this time.
---
Cheers
---
Yah need it so you can tuck it into your pants and it disappears only weighing 1/100 of what you can carry :)
---
Stuff like this only reinforces the need at some stage to a balance ovehaul across the whole game. The lot, weapons, armour, enemy damage and bullet sponginess, everything.
---
I mean I would retort but this is a poorly written comment. Only excuse for it would be English not being your second language, for that I would apologize for making a joke at your expense. If not...well you are dense and suck at enjoying a good joke. 
---
Console is absolutely fucked from what I've heard. PC is mostly difference of hardware and randomly occurring issues.
---
Take note of any other AAA game. Barely any game breaking bugs on release, and leisurely releases on bugfixes (unless critical to the game in some way). I give em credit for attempting to fix the issue, but 1) it shouldn't have happened to begin with and 2) they shouldn't have continued the heavy monetization on a $60 broken product.
---
Yeah they took too long with the duping problem. Should‚Äôve nipped that in the bud and we wouldn‚Äôt be having this discussion
---
I agree with you but you‚Äôre in the wrong place. This subreddit is just for folks who want to complain about the game and talk about how much they hate it and Bethesda. Or did you miss the memo?
---
Also I said ‚Äò‚Äô the little buff it adds‚Äô‚Äô not ‚Äò‚Äô the little buff it added‚Äô‚Äô I think you might just need to take a brake from the internet my guy. Getting mad over very little.
---
How I can give two thumbs down? 150 alu scrap vs 15 Alu bulk there is 7lb weight difference :D 
---
I choose to believe this is a satirical masterpiece, lambasting the hordes of TSE crybabies, and not, you know, another TSE crybaby.
---
Yea, they should totally just forget about fixing them then huh, maybe put off the hotfix for a week until they pick up enough bugs at once to make you feel like its a bigger patch.
---
Unfortunately, I think that's the moral of 76 in general. Totally smashed my view of Bethesda, that's for sure. 
---
No thanks.  I‚Äôve had about 50 GB in scan and repair episodes (episodes because they fail 90% of the time and take multiple hours ultimately, even though I have no other game or internet issues).  I did a scan and repair before the last patch.  Immediately after the patch download, I do a scan and repair again and it already totals 16 GB.  It fails.  I try again, now it‚Äôs suddenly up to 24 GB.  I try to play the game, crashes immediately 3 times in a row.  Starts to work with the rad worm bug, weight carry bug (under max carry weight, yet over encumbered.   Then crashed again after trying to travel to my camp 15 minutes in.  Bethesda support is shit, been like this since day one, and they keep blaming something about my brand new PC build, ISP, or settings, even though beta and a while after launch worked relatively smoothly.  All other games work just fine.  I would put up with bugs and content at least enough to get my money‚Äôs worth if the game were fucking playable.  Literally just playable.  I‚Äôll go back to Fallout 4 if I feel the urge and hold on to my wallet next time around.
---
I dunno where the mod is - only found the plans. üòä
---
Did I imagine it or did they did warn players recently to not be carrying duped or excessive amounts of stuff? People were being banned for insane amounts of carry weight.
---
Whether or not you knew stuff was duped (or you dupe yourself), your mule had so many of these warning signs over it that that it was bound to happen... You would have perfectly fit the bill for a cheater. I can see why it would happen unfortunately.
---
I do agree though that saying You have to respond quick only works if they pick up up quick when you respond.
---
Cool guys, but at this stage unless it's an improvement it's too little too late. Holy cow, I would so ve fired by now if this stuff happened at my job. I still have a little faith guys but I'm starting to suspect you also dont really have a plan, and we know what happens to guys with faith but no plan.
---
One last thing that makes me feel that they don‚Äôt care about this game I mean people in this 
---
team. You know with the weight of Bobby pins had been reduced to 0 in former update, from what I see. But this time after the update the weight of it has become .1 again. I suspect that they are lazy. I think maybe they are duplicating some of the contents of former versions? 
---
And in this process they forgot to change the weight of Bobby pins? If this is it, they are making shit.
---
With all plans available at vendors, there's not really a substantial reward for burning a lot of resources in the hopes of a lucky drop from the SBQ. That's likely why you are seeing fewer people at the event.
---
Lolz
---
I guess you struggle with  your own deluded sense of self
---
I called you out for what you said and the last 2 statements you‚Äôve made have been attacks and deflections
---
Clearly you lack the conviction of your comments.
---
They're more in line with the other cruddy legendary effects. Sorry you farmed/traded/spent money on it but it's not like you can't still one-shot most enemies
---
Ye. There is already THOUSANDS of QoL and glitch fixes made by modders, bethasda hardly has to do anything anyway, literally buy the mods, implement as game content, and reap the rewards of a more polished game than they can manage on their own!
---
Lol keep thinking it‚Äôs number three and pass them all my way üñ§
---
Your account is 81 days old and EXCLUSIVELY posts about FO76. Hmm...
---
Most of these have been there since the BETA, they are actively ignoring the mod authors, personally trying one last time before I "tap out".  
---
Blizzard does not do this, speaking from experience.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Yeah, good one :)
---
Psyco was always a pre-war drug. You're thinking of Jet.
---
That, is a very good point.  Wasn't the whole idea behind not having NPC's so that people had to rely on one another?
---
It's a bug for anyone that wants to give something for free. 
---
If wrap arounds are set for both limits then I want a quick key for zero caps and a quick key for max caps.  Or at a minimum a key that can be held as a modifier that moves the slider up or down to the nearest 1/4 mark on the bar.    I should be able to get to zero as quickly as possible if I want to give away something without dropping it.   Perhaps others really want to get to the max caps quickly for rare stuff they have.
---
If a patch does all this mess, imagine a roll back.
---
Exactly this! I'm only lvl 23 and when I try to advance the story quest in savage divide, I'm always met by lvl 40+ monsters because some high lvl guy is near the area. Makes progressing ridiculous. I've actually stopped even logging on the past couple days because of this
---
Thanks for not being like everyone else you're the real mvp
---
You know what can fix *all* of your problems! Flex tape! 
---
Should I pump the brakes a bit? Or take a leave of absence (break) from the internet? C‚Äômon life coach, help me!
---
ok
---
The way I see it is FO76 was exactly what Bethesda let it be.  We as consumers expected different, want different, and are actively pushing for different.  The reality of most games is they have a development cycle, and they're done.  Bethesda has allowed some people to work on big fixes, but it would be foolish to think the game will change drastically.  The devs should and most likely are on other projects.  FO76 is and can be a good tool for Bethesda to test the waters of online play and gain a better understanding of what people want in an online game.  I don't think FO76 will evolve much at all from it's current reality.  There may be slight tweaks, but it is what it is, largely a beta test bed for what will come next.  The only real problem is it's a half attempt, so it only servers as half a tool.  It will always be poorly received, have low player quantity, and generally have limited metrics in return.  It will serve some use, but it's not really the sandbox it needs to be.  If Bethesda really wants to test online play as a business model, they really need to see FO76 as a bigger thing, a sandbox, a creation tool, and am interface with the consumers.  Let it be beta. Let it be broken.  Just make it wild.  Push the boundaries and evolve it.  Let it get shaped, reshaped, and see where it goes.  That's a much better path for testing and analytics.  Let it be the incubator for future online content.
---
Zero 
---
I hope Bethesda is listening to feedback like this. You're not the first and I'm guessing that you won't be the last for a while.
---
Is that for real? If so... that's terrible lol
---
Some things are easy to fix, others are not..  
---
In this case the Modding community knew what happened instantly, and they finally admitted it, a "Version Control" issue 
---
They don't care about the innocent players who got screwed. All they care about is that they don't get owned in PvP anymore.
---
Lol.  I seem to remember once upon a time that it was the other way around but I suppose over the last three months that has changed üòÇ
---
I definitely get some of the complaints, but this particular one is just ridiculous 
---
My husband and I play together sitting next to each other on the couch. Neither of us have duplicated anything. 
---
Get kicked constantly!!
---
So frustrating! Especially when you have a work shop and get kicked and lose it. 
---
All that time. All that effort. All that material!
---
Gone. 
---
I feel your pain. 
---
As I mentioned in a previous reply, however, we do not own software. All we own is a license to use the software. And the TOS dictates situations where said license or licenses can be revoked. Again, however, if he does wish to pursue this through the courts, best of luck to him. I'm just not hopeful for his chances of winning, is all.
---
Getting banned from a blizzard game bans your hole account same for EA.  Valve can and has banned entire accounts for doing things they dont like before as well.
---
I use grenades now, actually pretty useful since they do more damage than my aae handmade.
---
I misread your post earlier. I thought you told the OP not to read tickets. Now I get what you were saying. 
---
It's great but the gatling gun is better because it's more ammo efficient imo.
---
That‚Äôs where I found mine but I put it in the stash
---
You didn't quit sooner because you were like me.  Optimistic because up until the  end of December, they had actually been moving forward.
---
However one whole month of virtually nothing, then this crap storm of a patch and a new emphasis on PvP...
---
I loggedin tonight, but just had no motivation at all. Logged right back out.
---
I‚Äôm autistic we can be friends.

At least yours is fixable with therapy. I‚Äôm just screwed for life.
---
My bloodied gets me 1.8k-ish per swing, add 40% power attack and it's probably up there with my pre nerf tse gauss.
---
I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR SOB STORY.
---
No... they should fix all of them instead of just 3.
---
Came here to see if it improved enough to give it a chance. I guess I'll check again in 3 months.
---
Do you realize how much your belief that QoL issues should be their number one priority runs counter to a whole bunch of the other arguments people are making against Bethesda?
---
Just today I've seen people like you complaining that they need to focus on QoL updates, other people saying they've been wasting time on QoL updates already when they should be focusing on bug fixes and OTHER people complaining that they focus less on bug fixes AND QOL updates and just push out new content.
---
Bethesda ends up with people running here and bitching no matter what they do.
---
Holy crap
---
Not complaining, never got silver before, but seriously this is the comment that does it? üòÇ
---
Yeah, I know the feeling of staring at the map and feeling like you have nothing to do and nowhere to go.  All the events are beyond stale.  Enemy spawns are stale.  I see no reason to physically walk between locations anymore.  Rarely are there even new players on the map, so there's not even the joy of helping them out.
---
I'll still play it if my friend wants to, but I'm pretty resigned to moving on at this point.
---
Yes. 
---
Hot fix still takes a week. This team is a shit show
---
Ehhhhh.....but a handful of constant whiners are happy tho? I mean, that was one of the main focal points of the new patch right? Why not nerf everything to the point of it being totally useless? It‚ÄôS wHaT aLL tHOse HanDFul of WhinErs waNtEd üßêü§ìü§¨ this game is going on the self till this bullshit is addressed.  This patch made the game as tedious as it is boring now. Thanks for opening the Vaults and more endgame worthy playing Bethesda üòë
---
Bye falicia 
---
Cant believe how you treat your customers Bethesda,you nerfed the tse because they were op...ok. But you have nerfed them into irrelevance  . Why 2 nerfs to one weapon??? Been a fan since FO3...through the carcrash of the 76 launch and comedy show of errors and mistakes you have made. Regrettably boycotting your game untill you listen to your customers not investors!! Tse make PVE exploration much more enjoyable...its not all about the PVP crowd you are trying to draw into the game!!
---
And dyslexia doesn‚Äôt make you use the wrong ‚Äúbrake‚Äù or ‚Äúbreak‚Äù I mean COME ON

"I've tried. I've honestly tried." Way too over used and melodramatic. No one cares.
---
(RE:ModAuthors).  
---
We are trying and they are ignoring us.  
---
Pardon the grammar errors, fat fingers and small phone.   
---
Honestly, the modding community has done more to support and improve Bethesda's games over the years than Bethesda ever has. Y'all are bloody fantastic, and apparently more dedicated to making these games great than even Bethesda's own staff are based on the quality of releases : /
---
K, bye!
---
I said exactly the same thing on the patch note thread yesterday.. Been playing religiously trying to support them. Back to Halo 5 for me.

Take your complimentary tissues and upvotes and then build a bridge and get over your problems crybaby
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer You need to see this in relation to all of the weapon balance issues.   It isn't just heavy weapons, but here is one from the heavy weapon side.   The fat mat is extremely heavy to carry.  It's ammo is extremely heavy to carry.  It's fire rate is super slow.   That thing should do massive amounts of damage compared to a black powder rifle.  The solution isn't that the black power rifle needs to do less.  The solution is that the fat man needs to do a lot more damage.     A fully upgraded 50 cal rifle should do significantly more damage than a basic black powder rifle.   Maybe an available upgrade for the black powder rifle should be speed loaders.  Those were a real thing.
---
It totes does poor spelling and auto complete are a hell of a pairing

Right and when you wasted your money (I fucking loved Destiny 2 btw and have high hopes for anthem so your love of grinding farming bullshit makes sense) I bet you never mentioned it or complained or even suggested anything anywhere on the internet. No? Then quit being a stupid dick.

My game hasnt broken

I'm inclined to say the developers are the last people I'd blame in these situations. They're usually the hardest working of the bunch and have the least say in major marketing and design decisions.
---
Fuck them. Play games from a better developer and let them scramble to fix their company
---
That was actually hilarious
---
That asshole neighbor at the yacht club went and bought a yacht ten feet longer than Howard‚Äôs and that just won‚Äôt stand. Howard will show him. Howard will come back with a yacht ten feet longer than that asshole‚Äôs floating pile of scrap. If the neighbor doesn‚Äôt like that then Howard will consult with the team and they will release Skyrim Online and then that asshole at the yacht club will learn his place. 
---
? The cap limit is 25k btw...and even on launch week, they were selling for 20k. Never seen anybody pay or even ask for even half of that for a tse
---
That's what you get for dealing with those exploiters. can't trust snakes.
---
but doesn't the fatman have an area of effect where the rifle only damages one target
---
They could pull a No Man's Sky. Only if they care about this game for that long
---
So, it's standard operating procedure to cut off your means of contacting them, while at the same time, demanding communication?
---
Dude exactly look how all the snowflakes snowball downvotes.
---
And fixing all of them t akes time while they compile a list of EVERYTHING people are complaining about and then fix ALL of it to cram into one patch.
---
So they're fixing the shit they know about right now and can fix quickly and pushing that out.  Because that's how fucking hotfixes work.
---
This captures basically my exact feelings. They could‚Äôve just fixed the bobble heads and slightly needed tse. BUT THE DEMO PERK NERF WAS OVERKILL. I feel for the guys that enjoyed fat mans and middle launchers cause those must be doing very little damage now. The crafting thing is the only reason I quit playing as of yesterday because I do plan on coming back and sticking it out. But I‚Äôm not wasting my resources to unbulk then rebulk items in the meantime. 
---
Communal thanks..  
---
We make mistakes too, we miss deadlines and are late on new content and fixes, but most of us, having seen a little bit of what's behind the curtain, just want to help.  
---
I bashed fo76 even before the release, but right now I'm honestly saddened about this ... Sorry it came to this guys
---
Even with only 1 point, it procs a lot. I was playing around with a minigun last night and saw it proc twice in one magazine a few times. 
---
Opinion: "Bug but would be useful as a feature!"  
---
Make this "Bug" a persistent Mutation. Make a serum and a recipe for the serum, too. It's got plenty of plusses and minuses. :D
---
I think Bethesda need to get rid of the PvP entirely in this game. There are too many idiots leaping around in their undies, with the Marsupial Mutation, who are simply not interested in proper PvP, just moronic trolling, avoiding a real fight and destroying people's stuff. All of the attacks should come from the games' enemies. That could easily be expanded. Let's get rid of the naughty children. Appeasing them would be one less problem to worry about. Most of us are PvE anyway. 
---
&gt;new players
---
Glad to see we‚Äôre still optimistic here.
---
At one point this subreddit was saying, "screw you haters, this game will be good!" We told you guys and you did stupid shit like pre-ordering. Maybe the gaming community will become wise someday.
---
I‚Äôm relatively low level but I joined one a bit ago with 4 other players and we couldn‚Äôt kill her in time for the event to end.

---
They fucked up and pushed out an old version of the build with the latest update, which didn't include many recent fixes.
---
Yeah I'm actually the last holdout of ally friends. Some quit real early cuss of bugs, the rest left before reaching level 70. Oh well I put 300 hrs into it I guess it time to move on.

Just put on the Super Duper perk and it will help you somehow. I also like playing the mini nukes and sometimes it‚Äôs really amazing when you craft three but get six.
---
I will bet you money that the majority of people posting "DONE WITH 76" posts are dupers or people that bought or sold items on Ebay.
---
Any super mutant or scorched usually nets ammo there is also a perk that you click on to get extra ammo
---
Agree in part, it's a balance they've not yet gotten, add the survival bit, but don't make it so you spend half of each gaming session fixing things and doing inventory management.

Crafting/Stash Box Issue
---
1.  PS4
---
2.  PB_Jack
---
3.  [Stash Box and Weapon Modify Screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/mZi24FQ) 
---
4.  Having an issue when trying to modify an item or craft something new. When at a bench I‚Äôm showing modifications or items as uncraftable even though I have the required number of materials to do so. I‚Äôve also experienced this problem when trying to craft a piece of armor for a friend who provided the required number of materials and they were on my person. The craft screen showed that the item was still uncraftable due to lack of materials.
---
Be warned hot fix will introduce 5 bugs for every bug fixed
---
1. That‚Äôs fucked
---
2. You really shouldn‚Äôt put your email out there for everyone to see.
---
Too little too late maybe though. Who knows
---
My game doesn‚Äôt crash anymore on Xbox but it‚Äôs probably because it freezes within 10 minutes EVERY time. I gave up until they roll it back or that hot fix maybe works
---
I killed 8 legendaries today and got two legendaries. 1 was a rolling pin and the other was fairly useless armor I cannot even remember what
---
this is actually a good idea
---
You know what is a really damming incitement? I still have every single atom point I've earned in game. I've never paid for them. I'm sitting on like 1,800 atom points and I've not found a single thing I care about buying. The game is unplayable. Me and my gf got to like level 60 so we could do the end game content but in a whole three weeks of trying once every night didn't manage to get through the nuke launch without dcing. There's nothing left in the game. There wasn't much to start with. Even now it's not really a finished product. If it came out now at beta stage I'd feel satisfied. But I'm fucking done with this and the whole franchise. I've loved fallout, bought so much merch over the years, all the games, all the expansions. But now I'm done. 
---
I second this. They could avoid mass complaints like this. 
---
K.
---
Lol I feel the same man....I used to farm power missions for fusion plans to make 2k per....that hustle is dead asf
---
This...^^
---
Crasfting. Ammo perk +super duper and the Ammo farm. 
---
Dense and fireproof shouldn't be mandatory  because every "raider" carries a "completely legit" TSE shotgun.
---
google drive link, rut roh.
---
People should get over their over-entitled view that a game should receive no hate for terrible decision making. 
---
Prime plans are not good to start, only thing worth while is serum recipes. Shes not a big challenge but I don't see the waste of time/mats worth it.
---
Also, mother fucking reading comprehension.  they said that the planned fixes INCLUDE those three bullet points, not that the entire fucking patch is fixing just three things.  They focused on those three because those are obviously the things that they know they can definitely get into a quick hotfix, otherwise if they say something will be in there and it gets pushed to the next hotfix or patch you're just going to bitch about it.
---
Zero fails of three attempts. Two normal fights with the SBQ landing 4 times before dying and one time SBQ died unusually fast, even for before the nerf. Like someone just went full tilt with some exploit and nuked her HP in five seconds. 
---
Enemies have appeared in slightly different areas since beta for my friends and I. Like 10 ft but that‚Äôs not a big deal at all
---
&gt;All the people whose idea of enjoining the game by playing it in god mode using a god mode magic wand that sidesteps needing to put together a proper build, and hinges on ready access to millions of exploit-obtained magic wands of which there should, per the design, be a much, much smaller number (and almost nobody would otherwise have), lost their exploity god mode magic wand. Yay. If you‚Äôre one of these people, Let me say this more loudly. Yay. 
---
See, here is the big misunderstanding that everyone who is cheering for the nerf, has. I never wanted to be able to oneshot anything, but taking away 80% off their damage is making my guns totally useless. 
---
Besides, almost all of my guns were not TSE, but TS and E, separately. This patch affected those legitimately earned guns and builds I had for them, and rendered them useless.
---
I am not "crying and whining" because I lost the ability to oneshot most mobs. My only TSE was a 50.cal. Before the patch, it did 352 damage, after the patch it did just below 100. I agree that it was too powerful, and a nerf was needed, but it was way too severe. 
---
To compare, my explosive 10mm smg does 101 damage with all the perks now. That's more than the 50.cal, which just doesn't make sense to me. 
---
I also had an Anti-armor Explosive LMG, that before the patch did 75 damage. Not great, but decent if I were close to the enemy. After the patch, with all related perks, it does 33. It uses .308 ammo, and only damages that little of an amount. It was rendered useless as well. Again, not an TSE. 
---
If it wasn't clear, I was going for a big guns build, which was viable when my weapons explosive damage worked. But the nerf has rendered them useless in my opinion. 
---
I am not against switching play style, and exploring other builds. I am currently rolling with my instigating fireaxe and gauss rifle, and trying out an sniper build. But that doesn't mean it doesn't suck having 100's of hours of work taken away. I miss my big guns.
---
The TSE combined needed a nerf, yes. But they went overboard with it. And instead of opening a dialogue with people like me that feels this way, most people are just like " yay TSE gone, explore other builds, go bloodied/sneak, all TS/E owners are probably dupers anyway".
---
I'm just curious,
---
How many people do you think will be around in 3 months with comments like this.
---
Less players=less atom shop revenue=less updates/development
---
Unless you think this game is perfect as is, your hurting yourself of any possible future progress. JMO
---
**Use The Converted Munitions Factory To Make Ammo...**
---
I don‚Äôt bother launching nukes unless I have someone else with me. Get a friend so that you can join back after getting disconnected. 
---
Bitching about it is pretty much the only thing we can do, since the company refuses to tell us their plans.
---
Both Bug fixes and QOL are major issues. You‚Äôll get bitching for both as long as they don‚Äôt say which one they will try to fix first.
---
I didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúFixing Bugs should be sidelined‚Äù
---
I said a main issue was QOL. There is more than one Main issue.
---
Thank you very much
---
Upvoting so bethesda can see
---
You sound like someone who is low level or using auto weapons a lot.
---
Super mutants are your best bet. They give you ammo but most importantly gunpowder to make you own. All you need to do then is get lots of lead and you'll be right.
---
It's not about being realistic, it's about providing level of frustration feedback. Right now disappointment is roughly 99%, one more percent and people will switch from leadership changes to torches and pitchforks. 
---
This was a mistake, a ton of better suggestions on balancing the TSE's were suggested, but were ignored.  
---
It's a shame, and I hope they walk it back, because it kills demo builds and makes the already nearly worthless Missile Launcher and Fatman completely useless
---
Don't buy ammo off of vendors, it's a bad deal usually. Once you start raking in caps buy them from a trade discord/reddit. Until then, figure out what your preferred weapon is and find which enemy group uses those weapons. Scorched, super mutants, or mole miners
---
yeah different types of patches here.
---
Np. Have a nice night!
---
That is a good description of my experience on my PS4 stealth sniper. Critical hits no longer contributing to filling the crit meter has also neutered him quite a bit; that's new this patch.
---
Sorry that you are having problems. What part are you stuck on? I managed to make it through it the other night  while 200lbs over the weight limit and have arthritis as well. Sure I had 19 seconds to spare but I made it.
---
I am enjoying the game a lot and they have fixed some of my complaints already. 
---
The sad part for the grenades is that they dont always go off. Lost 5 Nuka Quantum nades before the patch to glitch, not going off...
---
My maxed City Defender fortified Spearmen and Longbowmen will fuck up a modern Mech Infantry
---
Well, most of the modding community does this all for free in their spare time, no? Because that's totally expected from folks who aren't being paid to show up for 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week to do a job.
---
That shit is super understandable from people who have limited time and are creating something that can be freely shared with everyone (especially the more expansive mods that add tons of new content etc.) Y'all are doin all of us a free service, so who are we to complain? : )
---
No, no they wern't. Muling caps was a thing.
---
So they managed to produce a Ghandi bug? Amusing 
---
I'd had a similar issue prior to patch as well.  Usually not the whole game play but for a good 30 minutes sometimes.  I'd get caution'd by something, some random thing a couple dozen yards away would somehow put me in danger, I'd kill everything, vats around to verify nothing out there and still be in danger.  Even walked half way across the map once in danger, ended up that fast travel solved the issue.
---
Your point is honestly pretty poignant. Without god mode the game is boring save for a few quests that we finished a month ago. It‚Äôs empty and the main thing that kept players around was the ability to see how powerful the builds could be. 
---
ff14 had a monthly sub on top of the product, and AT RELEASE was absolute shit.  Honestly, it still is. But japanese and weebos love everything squeenix farts out, so after the revamp it was good enough to be 'successful'.
---
Well put.
---
With the limited number of things other than scrap that are stocked and worth buying at vendors and the existing character limit on caps at 25,000, I don't think they even need to scale up prices, really. Sure, someone could buy up plans more quickly, but I'm not sure that would do anything but shorten that grind. Outside of facilitating player trading (and even that's questionable at this point for any high-level gear), caps simply aren't useful enough to be worth limiting beyond the character limit.
---
Valve was banning accounts but not for cheating
---
250 of damage is not high at all, fucking glowing wolves take 4 or 5 shots to get killed with a weapon that took me days to farm. 
---
The patch has two effects. Micro and macro. 
---
The micro effect is on your guns and their damage output. 
---
The macro effect is on how we as a broad audience interact with the game. 
---
You‚Äôre right, the patch had effects on non-abuses aspects of the game. But it also dealt with the fact you don‚Äôt want to think about - which is the existing abundance of overpowered items, and corrected not by taking them away from anyone,
---
but by making the game less about them, and devaluing them to get people to try other stuff. 
---
Congrats on the baby girl
---
They will never go for this because all they care about is stopping dupers. Your idea would just lead to supers getting more caps.
---
Honestly we've theoryhammered, guessed and thrown darts..   
---
The staffing issue could be part.   
---
A general lack of experience with the engine could be part of it. (What takes me 5 minutes to find and fix would take days for someone who doesn't have the same understanding of Armor records for example).  
---
We.. Well I don't know, but still am trying, one Last time, to help.
---
Our words are indeed backed by nuclear weapons
---
Xbox one original, when I pull up my pipboy I can‚Äôt move at all so I have to reset my game 
---
at the beginning of the game, yes. but it's easy to acquire more, just reload an area with enemies that use whatever ammo you want.
---
try maining a LMG and see what true pain is.
---
&gt;let me go grab that air drop real quick
---
&gt;and now I'm down 2K .308s
---
I never noticed that.  You're potentially right, I've definitely only noticed the first heal everytime
---
When my damages dropped 74.1% for my rifle, how can you claim that needed to happen? 
---
3 level 50s taking her down? I would have to witness that considering anytime 8 have been there, unless there are at least 8 or more players to kill her. 
---
Yep....and I did jet packs and cal shocks for 500 to 1k typically. Crafted the armor for 200 a piece.....just kinda hurt the whole "rebuild together" aspect when they hit dupers.
---
On PC, I'm getting an erroneous error saying I've reached my weight limit and can't pick anything else up, anytime I try to pick up a US Government Supply Requisition. I can pick up all other items on the corpse. This happens even if my character isn't even overencumbered.
---
I don't believe it was meant as a threat by OP..
---
more like a cry for help imo
---
You can literally get it for free by doing the Powering Up ‚Äú.....‚Äù (power plant name) events.‚Äù They award the Windmill, Large Generator, and Fusion Generator plans. So you only have to do 3 of them at max.
---
‚Äòsa small fekken wall enuhwayz.  
---
Maybe they saw the frontpage
---
I loved everything about the quest line. I still use the blade of baset with the armor penetration.
---
The story was great and I loved that Kent Conelly made it into the lore! When I saw his fan mail I was immmensly happy. 
---
If Bethesda puts some more quest lines like this in future patches there will be some happy people. They can expand on all of the factions even.
---
I hope Beth decides to have "seasons" like this is season 1 and the focus is getting out of the vault and defeating the scorch queen.
---
Season 2 would be rebuilding factions. Each charaxter picks 1 faction. Building up the faction would give faction quests, structures, bonuses, crafting plans, and introduction to human faction NPCs!
---
I dunno, what are you on about?
---
Been there...
---
Trolls get bored, till patch day, then they all come out and rile up the regular folk over pedantic shit.
---
Rabble rabble rabble!
---
They really have no idea what they're doing with a multiplayer game
---
When you buy a game you don‚Äôt own it, you‚Äôve only bought a license to play the game and if you break the terms of service the company can revoke your license(s). 
---
It's a shame despite all the passion you've put into this post Bethesda wont actually heed it. They read this post and be inspired to release a suit of Power Armor made out of plastic for $899.99.
---
This is the best thing I've ever read on Reddit. Take my upvote! üò≠
---
Outer Worlds should be releasing around that time ;)
---
This is a complaint that I hope /u/LoneVaultWanderer has thoughts on.  With the new balance of plans at the vendors being massively raised in price, this has made it almost impossible to afford things.  I do get raising the price to some degree, but these prices more than doubled, and the game was already feeling grind-y, now moreso.  I'll be "playing" for weeks doing the same events over and over, finding the same things to sell, just to get enough caps to buy one plan, and then start things over.  I saw a plan was in the 10's of thousands? What?
---
Yes it has the possibility to be really powerfull but when enemies discover you then you're completely lost especially with melee opponents and scorchbeast
---
Not sure why you are being downvoted.  It's amazing how many mouth breather basement dwelling mammals are all.of a sudden business essential experts and masters.of game development.  
---
Do you know of any Active BoS servers? My friend wants to join an actual BoS group instead of outcast. 
---
I won't be the last but this game is already dead.
---
yeah, after 100 hours of exploration with few issues outside of disconnects, I sure do feel robbed.
---
I had all my weapons nerfed (all tse), I had my explosive character nerfed, I had a decent amount of my side hustle nerfed (selling plans). There is literally no reason for me to play anymore.
---
It was just so horribly bad that they completely took the game offline and rebuilt it into a better game. Never even played it just know what happen cause I worked with some hardcore fanboys. And I love square and that is called treating your customers right. Video game developers are in the god dam CUSTOMER SERVICE industry.
---
just go melee.  thats where the latest patch will take you.  
---
But if it means we have a playable game....    
---
And can the press / buzz really get any worse?  
---
If it came down to inexperience, a lack of staff, or a number of things and they opened up to the community, sure there would be fallout (I'm not trying to pun) but would it really be worse than the road they've been going down for the last three months?
---
On PC maybe, not so easy on consoles.
---
You can get it for free by doing Powering up Posiedon, Monogoah, or Thunder Mountain..
---
Even the so-called "DLC" was already existing when the game was released, all they have to do is to release it to the public so they never intended to put any effort in this game
---
You get one for free by repeating "Powering up Poseidon". Each time it gives you the lowest ranked generator plan you haven't learned yet.
---
That's funny because distributing someone real name is against their TOS :p
---
Made it feel like the climbing and hustle to get plans and farm maps to get the ability to do the work was for nothing. Now everything is for sale cheapish a few I didn't have sure....but it killed the cooperation part.
---
From all of us who saw this coming and didn't pre-order I'd like to provide you with a healthy dose of I-told-you-so lol seriously though I thank the lucky stars I didn't jump on the fallout train. 
---
I really made me sad when I did that 
---
No worries :)
---
The orbital strike ones work really well...üòâ
---
Np, just trying to help fellow players who're trying to figure out their builds.
---
üòÅ
---
I can understand that.
---
Bethesda doesn't care bro. They'll say they do for PR but if they were really taking anything to heart it wouldn't have gotten to this point.
---
Is the range weapons being addressed? 50-95% of the player base had either explo or ts lege weapons, or combination of these. 
---
Now range weapons are not an option anymore due to 190% damage reduction. 
---
And btw noone asked the demo card nerf, just saying. If you can't do the math what could have been the right numbers those are ts from 100 to 100, Explo from 100 to 25 if the weapon already has ts effect AND to 50 if no ts effect. Make a flag for the ts effect and a spell that then reduces the explo effect to 25.
---
Yeah, being surrounded by nothing but mutants, monsters, and robots all dancing in the ashes of the past while the words of the last survivors whisper to you from every corner really fucks with you.
---
Nah. I've had similar. Only crashed 4-ish times throughout my whole time since the beta ended.
---
People would actually have to read the TOS to find out. 
---
Can someone tell me what explosive weapons specifically suffered from the nerf? 
---
And no, if you're using a legendary weapon with the explosive effect, that doesn't count. I am aware something like missile   launchers are lackluster, but I figured  it was more from prohibitive weight, not sure about other stuff like grenade launchers.
---
Something like hand-thrown grenades are still pretty useful and powerful even without investment. I regularly use plasma grenades to decimate groups, and I don't have a single point invested in demolitions, so it's not like they're unusable without them.
---
How can I get that mod? I scrap everyone I get from the two parks and have yet to get the mod. 
---
Good question 
---
How many items did you have.  What was your character weight.  You are deceptively non descriptive.
---
Eh, I'm happy being hopeful and enjoying the game as best I can for now. They tried to implement a lot of community requests, which is encouraging even if they borked it a little. Lots of other major buts were fixed. 
---
Just a heads-up. I tried to do the Breach and Clear event earlier. It was supposedly updated to include the Meteoric Sword as a possible loot item to spawn in the mining containers. Something definitely broke as the mining containers now contain nothing, not even ore.
---
That just sounds like inflation
---
Glad I spent hours soloing missions to get my plans, and now they can be bought üòÜ 
---
Yeah but you know why he is nuke happy right?  In the original civ his aggression was set to 0. But if you took any action that would lower aggression it would loop past 0 and become max aggression instead.  And thus nuke happy ghandi became a civ standard
---
He didn't purchase a game, he paid for a license to use their software with a lot of restrictions on it. It's more like how Microsoft will prevent your MS Office from downloading updates if your Windows is not validated
---
Sadly, from the looks of things, I agree. And the worst part is that they can easily chat with Zenimax Online Studios (ESO developers) for a whole lot of advice and guidance, and they even said they worked with them a bit on FO76...because holy hell does it seem like anything ZMO may have said to them went in one ear and out the other. That or they didn't bother to consult with *their only studio with solid experience with online games currently supporting a solid online game*.
---
You know, two stupid options.
---
Shhh... Don't let Bethesda know Martial Artist affects gatling fire rate.  They'll _fix_ it...
---
Yes! I got it that way initially by doing the Power Up Missions with my first character. I know that some people have THE worst luck trying to get it, so figured I'd post this. But thank you for the comment for those who don't want to spend the caps!
---
You are correct, tested that today. But I could swear it did before this last patch!
---
I offered suggestions on bungies site about the problems with the raid and such and after I realized what d2 was going to be for at least the next year I stopped playing and stopped going to the destiny forums
---
And I never once ever even considered telling them to shut the game down or called anyone terrible for liking a game I didn't... 
---
(I'm glad you liked it but I didn't  after playing so much d1 and Ihear d2 is good now but I stuck with d1 day in and day out and will not give them any more of my time, tho if there is a d3 I'll look into it since bungie and Activision are no longer partners
---
No one's guna look at your shit unless it's on here
---
Its a leaky bucket at best that Bethesda is working with - some duper might chance it and do limited duplication vs. the thousands they used to do previously, thinking that's too little to trigger any alarm bells.  These people probably aren't the brightest candle in the shed to begin with anyways.
---
Yeah my main weapon is the Perfect Storm a 10mm SMG, and I'm only level 20, but even when I use .308 and .44 round weapons i feel constantly low on bullets, thanks for reminding me about ammo crafting totally forgot about that feature.
---
lol my point is this game is no where near what FF14 is or was and anyone who wants to compare just needs to gtfo because you won't be entertained by me.
---
Don't worry, the few Bethesda community managers around aren't omnipotent. There's no way in hell they can find anything said here that's past 3 threads deep replies.
---
***I also did take items left in paper bags by dupers as I raided a few of their camps...***
---
There's your issue.
---
I stopped playing this in December. I'm completely blown away by how broken this game is. I don't think I've even played a game with this many bugs, let alone a supposed AAA game. It has been 3 months with multiple patches since release and it still functions as if it was in early Alpha. 
---
I don't remember off the top of my head. 6 or 7 maybe? 
---
Why would they answer to anyone, they obviously fucking hate making games and they hate their fans. 
---
Well, as stated above, it is not auto scrapping my bulk.
---
Well don't you have an expansive vocabulary...
---
It did until now. Only reason to bulk is for sale anyway 
---
It‚Äôs just you
---
Boy do I feel you... 
---
If your bored check some of my comment history, I spent the past 3 months building up a stock of material, legendary armor and weapons and PA parts and roamed around completely upgrading and outfitting people for free..  
---
I'd start a trade on Reddit and when I saw they had one legendary weapon id give them several when the trade was done, etc..  
---
As of lastnight I can't do that anymore, actually 4/5 characters are so overweight the one unencumbered one can't buy/sell/trade.. (Account over limit cap)
---
I know right! I did the same thing with my first character, like... yeah thanks, enjoy the fast-tracking, new guys. Hahaha.
---
Cause that requires thought input. 
---
I hardly think they are maliciously ignoring users. From what I've seen the Bethesda Reddit devs have been responding to what they could across multiple subreddits for fo76. Yes, their list of complaints is huge and I'm sure they are working on resolving our problems. But you can only fix so much at a time, quality test said fixes, and move on to the next problem. I doubt their quality test group is large, so they probably rely on us to find these problems they can't see or find. 
---
Love how salty everyone is because their bought duped weapon isn't good anymore 
---
That sucks. Hopefully you can get your account back. The silver lining here is that it looks like *real* dupers are probably getting what they deserve
---
Rabble rabble rabble rabble!
---
Ah, see I didn't know it gave you the lowest ranked one you didn't know. I appreciate you adding in the detail. This is mainly for those who want to fast-track it or just have issues obtaining/completing the Powering Up, Quests.
---
Man, all those four letter words really help to drive your point home kid.
---
Yeah!
---
Because it‚Äôs Microsoft‚Äôs fault that bethesda booted him from the game! 
---
You're right. A bad game should be shelved and moved on from, period. The haters have been giving this game undue attention and inadvertently extending its lifespan. This is most unfortunate, as I too am guilty of this. But hate-watching content on this entire train wreck has been so addicting that I don't think I can stop. The only way for me to completely move on from this is for this game to redeem itself, like no man's sky recently. Thankfully, it looks like that's still a long way off based on the recent influx of YouTube vids and posts on this sub. 
---
Straw man much?
---
Same on Xbox
---
Log in after 2 loading screens, no water loaded in, no riverside camp loaded, I am just a floating head and I am getting crippled and eventually murdered by an invisible mob. 
---
This is the smouldering pile of this game finally winking out. 
---
I‚Äôm not comparing the game to FFXIV, I‚Äôm simply saying they should take the necessary steps, similar to what square Enix did in regards to FFXIV. 
---
Just turn the servers off, for a long time. Make the game the players actually thought they were buying. Turn servers back on.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre right, the patch had effects on non-abuses aspects of the game. But it also dealt with the fact you don‚Äôt want to think about - which is the existing abundance of overpowered items, and corrected not by taking them away from anyone, but by making the game less about them, and devaluing them to get people to try other stuff.
---
well, that point is kind of irrelevant, since the longer the game has been out, the more people would have gotten access to the rare guns. It was only a matter of time before people would have started complaining about the TSE guns anyway, with or without the dupers and their millions of copies. 
---
People knew those guns would have been the best from Fo4, and would have farmed night and day server jumping at whitesprings. I agree that more people might try out other builds now, and would like to think that effect is happening. 
---
But the sad reality is that the few people I know that are still playing, just switched to a bloodied/melee build instead as that still works fine. 
---
I believe balancing the TS/E damage, instead of nerfing it into the ground, would have been better for the game. It absolutely didn't have to have "superior" damage compared to every other build as it did before, but as I said before, removing 80% damage was just too much.
---
Plasma gattling gun without any lifetime perks lasts about 1 plasma core before it needs repair.
---
It's kind of hilarious how bad it is.
---
I bought the game the day of launch based on Bethesda responses to this sub about handling QC. After two weeks, I put the game down and have touched it maybe once. I found my experience so dissatisfying with this game, that for some reason I have no interest in playing my other Fallout games anymore. I don't know how that works, but it sucks.
---
I really just feel screwed over left and right. I won't be buying any more Bethesda stuff until it is used at some store.
---
G2k
---
&gt; While I don't have an answer or better comment than this right now, I want you...
---
Well, silver linings, I guess!
---
Please, it's not only the energy weapons, agl and missile launchers too, tse mini I can shoot 4 mag and it breaks from 200% repair. Those are unplayable.
---
It's more than likely due to the smile at the end. It's usually comes across as passive-aggressive or ungenuine through text online. Not saying this person are those things, but that's my guess of why so many downvotes 
---
I suppose so.  Reddit is weird ü§£
---
Yeah I died trying to kill a level 5 super mutant that wouldn't take damage.
---
I love the game, but the hard cap of 1500 weight means my storage mule is over 100k weight past the point where I can even pick anything up on my main.
---
If I can't loot, there's no point in even logging in.
---
I only purchased the game after checking that I could use mules to store an unlimited amount of stuff, I'll give it a few weeks, but if there's no way for me to loot anything I'll be having to go forward with my EU guaranteed refund. :(
---
Show me an MMO that had everything that you wanted at launch. It has always taken awhile for the full endgame to arrive. While 76 is not quite an MMO, it is closer to that than an online shooter.
---
Sure it has problems such as the massive disconnects but so did WoW, EQ, SWG and so on. Hell, I can't remember how long SOE lied about playable Jedi being in the game but it was a secret to unlock them when actually they were not even close to being ready. With all MMO style games, once you get tired of the end game that is there, you shelf it until an update or expansion and pull it back out.
---
Cause those 2 things are related....
---
Absolutely serves you right for having a ‚Äúmule‚Äù
---
Absolutely brilliant news, one less twat on my server.
---
i have 12 if you're willing to buy em
---
Dear Bethesda supporter,
---
Thank you for your excellent feedback. Unfortunately all of the concerns earns you have listed are Newly implemented features. We are glad you are enjoying them as much as the much requested nerf to every ranged weapon in game. 
---
We will continue to sift through our own feces before taking long crunchy, corn filled bites in hopes of finding the next in game balance we can apply to further enhance your experience. 
---
Sincerely yours Bethesda Support. 
---
Your not alone, there have been people reporting odd things like this since the patch dropped.  
---
I can't buy/sell/trade on any character on the same account I have 4 seriously overloaded "mules", but oddly others can.. Hoping there is a fix and a future.
---
After the third time killing her I jut stopped going. What is there to gain? What do I need from her? Nothing.
---
Also, in my experience, she is likely to bug out and unkillable more than half the time. Screw that noise.
---
Hopefully the efforts of yourself and those like you will get their attention and bring about positive change. Their focus so for has been bewildering. Prioritizing separate PvP servers (big undertaking and resource draw) over new content for PvE really caught me off guard. Almost like they are trying to cash in on the all the PvP players from Fortnite/PUBG/etc. That has never been their space and it certainly is not that attractive for their majority player base. They should have kept the game in a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù state for at least six months, justifying taking servers down repeatedly for patches until they get it right. Nobody would blame them if the effort, communication and direction was there. 
---
I don't know, I mean that today in all caps kind of suggests threat more than cry. 
---
Yea and I'm feeling shit out on here and today I'm seeing leaving posts trending. This is a terrible state of affairs. I picked up Destiny when it was free on ps network and I think maybe that is how I'll play games from now on. As a matter of fact I believe the gaming industry may evolve to the point people won't preorder anything and they'll have to start selling games almost exclusively through online network subscriptions. Maybe that's melodramatic but if this trend of half baked releases, patches, and microtransactions continues who knows...
---
I feel you I played the first two weeks took a little because me and my friend got sick of nothing working right. I care back and played last week but it‚Äôs time to stop again for a while. 
---
Yeah even if you have same level 1 on the perk that's probably significantly better then with my luck 3.
---
Had over 200 different weapons and countless armor dropped just because I kept high end stuff in the stash to keep free from basic offers. Now I had over 300k in cap inventory gone. Spent some much time building it so when someone came I had anything they'd want to offer. Now I got the basics only....sad days.
---
I was just asking. People like to make ultimatums, but it's rare they ever actually provide info on the "or what" part.
---
I'm assuming that you can still move from a to b though I unfortunately cant
---
Hey man, this is seriously fucked. PM me if you are looking for legal help and we could get something drafted up. 
---
It says excessive item creation which tells me he was testing a duping method and got caught trying to overload the server. I've never heard of people being banned for weight alone.
---
Does anyone else think the end goal is for Bethesda to sell atoms for caps?  Hard limits, outrageous prices, testing the play to win market with Unstoppable swag?  I will take my tin foil hat off now. 
---
Pete Hines didn't know about Gamestop releasing a day early or the stash limit. He was useless either way.
---
Best workaround for this is to just spam the loot button like crazy when you kill one since the legendary is always on top of their inventory.  Dead mobs disappearing has always been an issue but it seems worse to me now.  
---
My Excavator power armor helmet just kept unequiping itself while I was fighting the Scorchbeast Queen. Also multiple players had problems loading the their own paper baggies, scorch beast queen loot and even the event completed rewards. I am playing on PC.
---
*sad face*
---
Sentinel gear will be nerfed. I have nothing substantial to support this claim but I believe it very likely to be true..
---
Yes - your account gets locked out and its the means you normally open support tickets.  Happens everywhere.  Don't do stupid stuff and you have nothing to worry about.
---
no amount of convincing is gonna convince someone to stay anyways, if they have chosen to want to leave, people are just sick of the constant "this is why I am leaving..." posts. If they want to leave, just leave. No-one really wants to know their exact reasons (considering 99% of them are the same reasons).
---
It was promised as an amazing game at a 60 dollar price point.
---
Is that difficult to understand, or are ya gonna refute fact? It's bit like it was showcased in E3 for an hour as siemthung it's not or anything.
---
You're trying to twist rwlsity as if this was an indie green light game. It wasn't. It is not.
---
I had a ton of fun up through about level 45, when the "scaling" made my Rifle feel like a spitball shooter rather than how it should feel.
---
If Fallout 76 turns out at all similar to the way Elder Scrolls Online improved, then it should eventually be fantastic.  There are basically only two things not EPIC about ESO: 1) you have to pay $15 a month for the subscription or else purposefully horrible inventory management makes the game almost unplayable and 2) jumping/climibg (the lack of it)/wall jumping/ledge grabbing make the game feel too 2-dimensional - I want to run, leap, grab, kick of walls, walk along ledges - basically, be like a Ninja, but I can't.  (In ESO)
---
No it isn't. It is pretty clear that they can pull service.
---
They are not enforced by law to KEEP you as a customer.
---
What's good more quests like the missing little boy Freddy Quest. You feel good at the end of it. Didn't feel all that good at the end of this one
---
The best possible thing to do with the mistress mystery quest line is to let users start the secret society back up.
---
They actually fix up the base and have more quests to do where you go out and eliminate bad guys and do good things.
---
Connect all wires to one switch near the reactor
---
Connect reactor to switch when you are home
---
Store reactor when you are out
---
Yes, check the post, (and there is one on the Bethesda page) immediate increase in stability for many.  
---
Big but however, the way it's set up it spreads like a virus, so if someone near by had the HUD it can / will effect you, and may cause CTD's.  
---
So if you say CTD's 5 times an hour (some of us have been sitting at this point since the patch before this one) you may be reduced to 1 crash an hour.  
---
  **Tal:DR**
---
Not using it Wont fix everything / all CTD issues, but it has helped allot of people.
---
I actually wish this was a thing
---
Like the Ant-agonist
---
Somehow there was someone who was out in the wasteland whod hoarded a certain food.
---
Just like One violent night, wish id run into ONE survivor.
---
I get it something new. But its broken and they could have made more $ an fanfare with optional multiplayer
---
and a 4-6 person co-op engaging storyline
---
Hello Bethesda,  
---
I just wanted to bring attention to a bug that I encountered.  
---
It seems that you can't apply Brawling Mod on Robot parts when using a Mod Box.  
---
I also tried to learn the Mod through scrapping.  
---
I eventually learned the brawling mod for Robot, but it doesn't show up as a mod that you can select.  
---
I believe there were other mods I learned for robot as well, that didn't show up available, but I don't recall at this point since I was only looking for brawling.  
---
Thank you,
---
Betcha you won‚Äôt see any ‚ÄúBethesda replied‚Äù flare on THIS one! üòÇ
---
This is the best way to get ammo.
---
People down voting cause they think crafting needs a nerf? Yikes! Upvoted. 
---
I want both, teams of ppl fighting for area control. Co op is fine but alot of us need more than trash AI to shoot at
---
Out of ten people who have posted they were leaving the game over the last couple months that I set reminders on... All ten are still playing and posting today.
---
If they're going to quit, you're not going to change he your mind but 98.4% of the time they're just blowing off steam and whining thinking that grand gesture will somehow make Bethesda fix whatever their woes are.
---
It gets old, it isn't genuine and if they really are quitting they might as well give me their gear to hand out to noobs.
---
You mean don't carry thousands of pounds of stuff for each of a hundred people on top of keeping multiple duper caches when "raiding" their paper bags all on the same charcter?
---
Got it.
---
Scorch beast queen 
---
SBQ and sometimes SB drops
---
I don't believe that anybody able to get so many caps so quickly would be so stupid as to pay 3x market price
---
Its more like, you have a contract with a sports company which provides golf courses, tennis etc.
---
You take a dump on the tennis court a couple of times, and they cancel your contract.
---
Just because you USED to be able to go play golf, it doesn't mean you can continue to do so.
---
Im going to repost this on r/fallout and i think others should too. Try and get your post seen by someone that works at bethesda and hopefully get your games back. 
---
I read it as being pretty tongue-in-cheek.  More of a joke than actually trying to stretch the definition
---
Not necessarily, might be the catalyst to bring about a change in mindset and personnel on the game. Could be a good thing. It's clear the current team suffers from tunnel vision in their efforts. Not enough broad thinking or testing to see what their changes will actually play like. If they did we wouldn't constantly see their two steps forward, three steps back dance routine. 
---
You still get a point for every level, and a pack every 5th level after reaching level 50. It just becomes perk management after that. The problem is the lack of pre set perk load outs. 
---
Problem is that they have more man power using the ban hammer than devs actually fixing the damn game. Hey guys maybe if we ban players that find these exploits then they wont find the new bugs and we will be okay.
---
No, occasionally you may get an Ultracite rusty knuckles plan. However, BGS feels that reward has been significantly over-performing in its current role, so removing it totally will bring the SBQ loot table more in line with legendary ghouls that drop only a single bobby pin.
---
That's exactly how I feel about it. I've been waiting for it to get better, and unfortunately it just isn't. 
---
I did enjoy the have quite a bit, there is a lot to like and a lot of potential. The bugs and exploits are just getting worse after each patch. 
---
Might just go back to Fallout 4 and help out another settlement. 
---
Cost/Benefit says hundreds or thousands of rounds for some flux/2 star armor/Plan isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
Your'ea fuckin sharp one eh? 
---
PVP is stupidly broken still - Melee damage can be insanely high and rifles basically *suck*.
---
BUT - it's a TON of fun in PVE - both solo and with a friend, either way could REALLY be a blast, better than most other games out there.  
---
That being said, it was up until about level 45 that I really really had a ton of fun playing this game.
---
But that's not why I bought the game - I though it it was gonna be a "long term" thing for me, fun for *years* I had hoped (based on my experience coming back to Elder Scrolls Online years after it was realesed).
---
Hopefully they will released some massive DLCs, and keep improving.
---
But, in the mean time, I say the game can still be a lot of fun for the PVE part - just don't try to level up too fast because the ranges from around level 10 - level 45 were really the most enjoyable.
---
I‚Äôve known this for a while, they banned me from all Bethesda games for the homophobia incident. Pretty sure you can play single player ones tho, you just can‚Äôt use the creation engine mods
---
Games don't YET have a Right to Repair law though, so you won't get very far.
---
The first one traded for a ridiculous amount
---
That's nuts. 23 times in two days for me at one point. I had 8 separate crashes from trying to mod an assault rifle. I used to have at least two crashes any time I'd go into a nuke zone in Whitespring. I'm just a dude playing on Xbox..   
---
Frankly, I'm not able to play the game enough to ever be able to afford it anyway.
---
Failure mode evaluation and analysis modules, 6 sigma, and lean all come from the development of automotive functions. These are methods that can be and are heavily applied in many other industries. My brother who makes software uses lean, my father who has been an IT director for a state public health office for the last 10 years has used the tools in managing his office. 
---
These are generic functions that take common variables in many industries to conceptualize, develop, and improve products. They are so ubiquitous that it is part of standard education in many disciplines that produce product.
---
ChinaIsFree - No, the Nexus mod had the same problem.  I posted about in the Bug Report section, and the mod author said it was an engine limitation (which it obviously was since Bethseda's own patch did the same thing) that couldn't be resolved until Bethesda resolved it.
---
Range pretty much gone at the moment, it's a melee slasher after the patch. 190% nerf. Noone asked for demo or other card nerfs. Tse needed a little bit nerfing, explo effect to 25 what it is now but not the ts effect nerf. It's useless now because ts is already inaccurate, it didn't even need this big of an nerf
---
You're missing the point.
---
They have confiscated everything he has bought from them. Under the umbrella of him supposedly cheating on an online game.
---
Shutting down access to the online game till the problem is resolved, yes, I would accept that.
---
Taking away everything he has bought from them, without acknowledging his dispute of the claim.  That, is wrong.
---
You don't have to personally experience a bug or glitch to get upset over it. If you see it happen to someone then it could happen to you and that makes you nervous to play the game. Just because a certain bug or crash didn't happen to  me that doesn't mean I can't be mad that the bug exists.
---
And if the cap were 100, eventually you would be asking why it is not 200. Its 50, because thats the way it was intended to be, I presume that in future (if there is indeed a future to be had) it will be increased.
---
Supply and demand. I sold a 1star explosive pipe rifle for 15k a few weeks after launch.
---
That you know of.
---
PVP is stupidly broken still - Melee damage can be insanely high and rifles basically suck.

BUT - it's a TON of fun in PVE - both solo and with a friend, either way could REALLY be a blast, better than most other games out there.

Also - the price already HAD dropped - all the way down to $29!!!

/r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
This one should hold over for another month lol
---
As someone who saw all this coming from the moment they announced ‚Äò76 was going to be an online game running on the *same fucking engine*,........ I told you so. 
---
Its too late.  GL to this game.
---
Duh. The 76 build system is actually somehow *worse*, with *fewer* options. I have no idea how they came up with that, but here we are anyway.
---
If it was locked at 100 you would feel the same at lv 100
---
It's most likely due to the online aspects and try to prevent people being op going against other players
---
Tho imo there are things they could do like master lockpicks and master hacker should just take one star and one perk point (3 lvs to unlock but once you get lv 2 it should just be one card ect same thing for most passive perks...it's annoying switching cards that really have no effect on gameplay esp since we can set loadouts and switch multiple at once)
---
But I KNOW (am really sure) we will get more cards and points since today right after the update with all 3 lockpick cards equipped it said I had lockpick 4its been fixed since but yeah there will obviously be something sometime that requires 4 lockpick points
---
Ah, but they've shut off access to everything requiring a Bethesda id.. this includes support tickets. His entire account is locked out.
---
They are nerfing everything else, why not. 
---
Omg you‚Äôre suggesting giving her even more money for doing what she‚Äôs literally paid to do already.
---
Crafting ammo is ungodly , rotating weapons helps as well. I am an auto build and rotate .45 and 5.56 , it works out incredibly well. 
---
White Knight was also the only thing that gave regular armor a meaningful reason to exist.
---
Well there ya go!
---
I can't argue with your points if your numbers/data are accurate.
---
If they really aren't leaving and just being dramatic, I guess there isn't any harm in returning the favor.
---
I just know that we need players to stick around or this game stands no chance of survival.
---
One word : buggethesda
---
&gt; You are not just a player but a member of the community and we thank you deeply for that.
---
Serious question: are you able to type that condescending tripe without laughing out loud as you do so?
---
Oh thank god the Bulk Junk crafting wasn't A. just me or B. intentional (I was afraid it was part of the 'must be manually scrapped' thing).  It was annoying as I had a full a full set of armor/weapons to repair from three RL days of questing and going back/forth was driving me insane (yes, I could have taken them all out, but I thought four boxes ea. would have been enough...nope! \*grins\*).  Good patch though beyond this!
---
Still need a 'modded energy weapons causes game to crash' fix...(not gonna let this go, I want mah full Gauss Riffle!
---
I‚Äôll bite
---
What is it specifically that you want from bethesda?
---
After intentionally breaking the terms of the end user licensing agreement you agreed to when installing their zenmax software? 
---
That‚Äôs all that legal speak that popped up when you installed their game on your pc.
---
After willfully performing acts of criminal malice and mischief by creating an unstable game environment by duping items.
---
I hope you don‚Äôt have an eBay account where you sold duped items or 
---
A YouTube channel to promote ways to exploit duping processes
---
Because yeah that makes your credibility shot.
---
How bad can it be?
---
I mean it‚Äôs not a lifetime ban right?
---
It‚Äôs Not like they flagged your ip and MAC address. 
---
Or pc host name and said known duper, denied
---
Right?
---
And, in the case of error?  Just say he's 'not' guilty?  How would cutting off all means of communication be right?
---
Sure, the first one...but at the time people didn't have many caps, 20k actually meant something. By the time everybody realized there was no endgame cap sink, TSEs were already much more common 
---
Joe Rogan would love this shit.
---
Yeah good luck even sbq is broken healed up 2
---
I had access to all your credit card information through the official forums at one point.
---
You are being overly melodramatic.
---
Pretty sure you still aren't guaranteed the vendor will have the coat. It's apparel, not a plan or recipe. 
---
Im afraid I do not know what happens after the vault opens. Tell me, what happened? Who was the second out? And where do the dead vault dwellers come from?
---
To one property.
---
Not all.
---
Wow they have you whipped don't they. You genuinely think you're powerless? I'm guessing your new to gaming, but there was a game called star wars battlefront 2, and EA (a games publisher) shoe horned a god awful microtransaction model into the game. Now, before anyone outside of high level preorders and origin access customers got their hands on the game, the, by comparison, much smaller group of preorders etc collectively voiced their opinion very loudly against the model. Not unlike we are doing here, albeit across many many many...many more issues. As a result of this voicing of negative opinion, the microtransaction model in SWB2 was significantly scaled back before any of the much larger group of players were subjected to its ass fuckery. So, coming back to the flaming toilet that is FO76, and using the SWB2 case as a template, we as individual players have a small voice, but as a group, and utilising the various channels available to us (reddit, Twitter, youtube) we have voice that has the ability to make Bethesda hear us and take action. Now why don't you put on your new monthly FO76 tshirt, take a swig of your fallout nuka cola rum, pop on your FO76 "leather" jacket and think if this game is acceptable and to the standard you are happy with. If it isn't, how could Bethesda change it? If you find it acceptable, I'm guessing I've used words with too many letters and you're just confused by flashing lights, pasturised milk and how mirrors work.
---
SCOTTLAND IS NOT EVEN A REAL COUNTY, YOU ARE AN ENGLISHMAN IN A DRESS!
---
Seriously take my upvote. 
---
The original members of the Enclave died due to the scorched. There is a destroyed Assaultron on the main entrance below the vault bridge. If you play it, you can hear Modus and somebody else as they are fighting the scorched. It appears that MODUS let the past members die to the Sorched invasion, however.
---
You and them are not solving the same problem. 
---
I think even if they left it on-par with other possible builds, everyone would continue to use it and we‚Äôd still have a TSE-focused audience for a long time to come. 
---
What they‚Äôre trying to solve for is to shift the audience towards trying the game‚Äôs many other options, and sooner rather than later. 
---
Not tried to be honest.. But just trying to empathize 
---
Buying another game will do it. There are a LOT of good games out there... if you've played them all and FO76 is all you have that's a personal problem you'll have to fix on your in somehow.
---
Ahhh. It never gets old.
---
And I bought one for 2500 two weeks after launch. What's your point?
---
This is an end game raid boss. Should be a
---
&gt;massive drain on resources 
---
As that's the point of the end game. Not saying you're wrong just pointing that out. Maybe people need to work together better and NOT THROW ORBITAL STRIKE BECONS... eh hem. Sorry. 
---
I was suspicious, so I set remindmebot with a two or three week period on posts I thought seemed more serious/genuine.
---
When the reminders popped up, every time, those users were still playing and posting.
---
The most dramatic reminder popped up the day patch 4 went live and I found someone who had "quit" two weeks before at the top of the sub showing off the TSE legendary gun that dropped for them AFTER that patch, lol.
---
All things are possible through Christ. 
---
That too, but your credit card information was definitely there, I can attest to that fact. Obviously I didn't screenshot anything and reported it right away. 
---
I just want to be able to UNSTACK cards. Cause the whole ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt get duplicate cards anymore‚Äù is bullshit. So let me take my 3 star card and turn it back into 3, 1 star cards. Since virtually every card I get out of perk packs at higher levels are just duplicates. There should be no situation where I have a 1 Star, 2 star, and 3 star of all the same card. Really bad design flaw.
---
Most enemies have no explosive resistance, so the Fat Man will blow up things you can't with your black powder rifle.  Its not so simple as just looking at pure damage numbers.  I believe its only players with certain mods/perks and the SBQ with any explosive resistance...  if you're in PvP and the other guy has no explosive resistance, its a simple one shot, he can be in the fanciest suit of power armor and it doesn't matter.
---
The black power rifle will need tons of anti armor effects to come close.
---
insofar as it "ended the game" for many players?
---
ok then...
---
i gave this game the benefit of about 200 doubts but it turns out they're just not all that good at maintaining an always-online game
---
Thanks friend. Looking forward to building my new home and like you have never done a metal building and really wanted to.
---
This is probably the first game I have found value in not purchasing. Watching everyone play the game, all the terrible glitches and underdevelopment, even listening to those that still hold out hope convinces me that I've made the right choice in daily avoiding this game. I bought No Man's Sky; I was severely disappointed. Steam Greenlight has drained my bank account faster than student loans, car troubles, and medical bills ever could, and left me empty inside. The Elder Scrolls Online wasn't even bad; it was a grind and hardly cannon, but it wasn't a shit game. This. I don't even know what this is.

Top of the world. Server hope you'll get 300 plastic in no time. Watoga you get around 130 every time

Bethesda is either being led downhill or is just heading downhill. I dunno if it's Zenimax decisions for all of this or Bethesdas decision based on expectations they feel that Zenimax has laid out as a guideline. However, they are going downhill, and I believe we won't be seeing Elder Scrolls 6 because Zenimax will have gutted Bethesda like a fish after Starfield barely scraps by. They are using a heavily altered version of the gamebryo engine, and has been for 20 years or so, or almost. It's getting to the point where you're starting to see the duct tape...
---
They need a new engine, and I'm pretty certain zenimax is not willing to greenlight the funding needed to do so. "It works fine, just make every game with your game engine that's slowly tearing Bethedas reputation limb from limb."
---
Yeah, everything I read said no actual credit cards, but people love exaggerating when it comes to this game. 
---
Go to Bolton greens and go directly north. Or go to Vault Tech Uni and go directly east.
---
You'll find a house w a ton of cat bowls. Tons of plastic. I think I get around 100 ish a trip. 
---
Nice! Thanks for sharing.  I have been waiting to get back into FO4 until the new Modern Firearms+Sidearms mod comes out.  
---
Look for the posts about it assigning to an discrete onboard GPU if memory serves.  
---
Some of them talk about using Nvidia Inspector, but you can force an INI edit to tell it specifically which card to use. 
---
Im now convinced that at this point they are just nerfing things to slow people‚Äôs progression down, so they have more time to add more content. Besides TSE none of these nerfs are for balance reasons they are just trying to drag out the game so people ‚Äúhave stuff to do‚Äù,I.e constantly fix their stuff/waste more ammo to craft, until they are able to release actual content. It‚Äôs kinda disheartening to see.
---
Woosh
---
I know there is a ton of employees that want to keep their jobs but stop. Just...stop. No more multiplayer for the FO franchise. Update your resumes, tell your bosses what you did well for FO76 and make FO5 the best goddamn single player game, if not ever, in the FO world. Just wash your hands of this debacle. Please. 
---
Shouldn‚Äôt you be too busy playing this marvelous game to be on reddit? 
---
Gottem!
---
I never even bought the game and I‚Äôm enjoying that very same train wreck for free! üòÅ sucks though because the Fallout franchise used to be one of my top 3 favourites of all time, before Bugthesda shit all over it in an attempt to bleed us dry with microstansactions. 
---
Makes a lot. They werent quitting because theyre dicks.
---
Im level 166 an i play to kill an hour or two now.
---
Nothing in this game can hold peoples attention anymore.
---
I was in a discord with a hundred people..We held down servers, multiple nuke runs, did quests together, traded fairly, roleplayed etc.   The fun ran out once we all realised we did it all.
---
Only about 10 still play. 
---
It makes a lot of difference when hardcore fans of the franchise bail. Played all the fallouts, id rather do another playthrough of 4 or 2 than 76
---
Not until they sneak in the modded energy weapons fix.
---
Dont trust me to develop software for my sensors atm, but its what makes it easy to go hop from seemingly unrelated industries. Im still fairly new, but my last mentor hopped from oil exploration to automotive and is now currently managing meat processing plants. Ive gone from ag to steel to automotive.
---
Bought what? Now your making stuff up, good on ya.

Same here but for silly reasons. I guess I liked having settlers that I could build little apartment complexes for and places for them to defend and a bar for them to go and sit down at when they were done scavenging. I hear most people didn't like dealing with that stuff but I did.
---
Then, of course, I had my little vendor area with all the different shops. Then I had my power armor display area and an armory room with the walls covered with every unique weapon I found as well as armor stands displaying the different kinds of armor and unique outfits. 
---
76 don't do none of that :*(
---
I love how he talks as if he's an authority on the game yet continually gets its name wrong.
---
I get the hate train, I'm frustrated to, but let me shout one last time into the void and hope, just this once, something out there hears us.
---
Wow, What a mess of a game, all i can say is when i put on my fallout hat, and i heard that the setting was west virgina, my first thought was a great lore story, including The Mothman. they could have centered the whole story around this as a main quest, and it would have been a game a lot more worthy to play. in fact i challenge a independet game designer to do a mothman style, slenderman game. because fuck bethesda, i want a mothman game.
---
My gamer tag is a bit ridiculous but I‚Äôll put it here. Incase you don‚Äôt want to enter all of that just post yours here
---
Player396990529
---
Idk how to change it lol
---
Thanks for the insight. All I wanted was a coop Fallout 4 to play with friends and family. But from the looks of it, all servers are still PvP enabled, they have weapon and armor condition again, and item duplication is not fixed.
---
If you're looking to be a space ninja, you may be interested in Warframe. Everyone is generally overpowered though, and everything looks like melted plastic. Endgame bosses aren't too bad either, but missions are very simple and there isn't that much story.
---
To relay issues to the dev team? How are you angry at this person yet you dont even know what their job is? 
---
You literally told them they're not doing their job right. Then say what's the point of a community manager? Come on.

Great, now im terrified because I make so many bullets daily.

How can you pay 60k when the cap is 25k?
---
This is correct afaik
---
I've been dropping legendaries off lower-level enemies into the Overseer's stash in the church at Flatwoods. I figure someone's going to have a *very* pleasant surprise when they get that level 5 "Ghoul Slayer's .44" I didn't need.
---
People have played the game for hundreds of hours over 2 months and they're crying because they're bored. Apparently these days $60 equates to a lifetime of happiness instead of just a videogame to play for awhile. The levels of entitlement are comical.
---
No endgame cap sink except serums, but then they became ridiculously common. I'm pretty sure I remember reading the sale exceeded max caps. I could be mistaken, you're probably right
---
Yes exactly, I'm not sure you can ague with that. Explosive shoty's were going for 40k a few weeks in. Idk what market this guy was on, some unicorn trade hub.
---
No one said about right or wrong - its just how these companies do it these days for most online stuff.  Account bans, and since everything is transacted by the account, its hard to get it reviewed if your account is banned.  Some get lucky and get someone to listen to them that's an employee but most others don't.  Probably why OP started this, hoping to get attention to his plight.  Unfortunately I don't think he's got a good case here - should have opened that support ticket and owned up before they banned his account.
---
The real fans never even wasted their money on FO76 because they saw the writing on the wall the day it was announced to be an Online game, and knew from that moment it would be a buggy, broken, microtransaction packed fucking shitshow from day 1. 
---
Which is exactly what ended up happening. It feels good to be right. 
---
Which is...completely non-helpful when my T-60 is Playtime painted and my T-51 is Nuka-Cola...and both get the Atom Shop sticker \*grins\*  No idea why the Nuka one got the Atom logo since Nuka-Cola is an in-game paint scheme...
---
I got him twice today hopping and he never had it. 
---
I think an empty local player server is needed to keep solo ppl happy, I love 76 for its multiplayer aspects as I've always wanted this for fallout. But really I think survival/pve/ local solo servers are the only way to keep so many crowds happy. Me, I'm full open pvp lovin fool so I'm sorry your having a bad time.  I wish someone would destroy my camp already
---
Do you still have it?
---
Is Bethesda the new EA?
---
Wait...there is not vaults????? 
---
I havnt played fo76 because of all the bad pr it was getting. But NO VAULTS? SERIOUSLY?
---
Yea, that's unacceptable if what you say is true. Completely unacceptable. 
---
Full FFXIV style 
---
Still not working after latest patch
---
It's getting old dude.
---
Maybe they actually played the game and said ‚ÄúWell shit. They‚Äôre right.‚Äù
---
Thanks for the heads up. I figured some of these posts were overdramatic. You have clearly put the time in and I appreciate the constructive response. I will take them all with a large grain of salt going forward.
---
first ever pre-order? that‚Äôs tough
---
Or... go do anything else in the world.  
---
There‚Äôs an actual story?
---
Same.  I have to now dig out both my T-60 (Playtime) and my T-51 (Nuka-Cola) and then hop in the brightly coloured one.  Was a lot more confusing with the Tricentenial paint as well.
---
I buy bulk ammo off the market for whatever I'm using. Saving me hours of well....farming crap
---
51/50 time for you, sir.
---
&gt;I am unable to become emotionally invested in Appalachia. There is absolutely no reason why I should care about this place? Sure, I can Nuke the Queen and end the story, but WHY? There needs to be a WHY. ( I know the story line, but it falls amazingly flat)
---
and only 65% upvoted... probaly was too long for dumb peoples and dowvoted after 10 words.
---
"I'll be sure to pass this message along..."
---
I get better drops farming Whitesprings ghouls, always have. Haven't bothered dropping a nuke or doing the SBQ yet because... Why?
---
Lots of other stuff to do and plenty of time to do those last two quests.
---
The fact it's harder now is actually something I like.
---
Read. 
---
I sincerely don‚Äôt understand your out rage. What‚Äôs with the name calling? It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs some list on your login screen telling you what items you‚Äôre not supposed to have. How would anybody know any of this unless they look that shit up or they belong to these circles?
---
I‚Äôve met dozens of players who had those masks completely unbeknownst that they‚Äôre not supposed to have them. 
---
But I guess they are all little snakes, right?
---
Fuck people for playing the game and finding/looting/trading for items BGS put in here. Let‚Äôs punish them.
---
Maybe point that rage at Bethesda for being lazy and allowing items to be leaked into the game that shouldn‚Äôt be there eh?
---
Did you make this account just to say this? Actually, just to say this *twice*?
---
Something smells like shittery.
---
&gt; bungie pretty much forces you to do things one way and that's it
---
They should take a note from Bethesda's book with the SBQ fight where you can win by shitting out enough damage within the time limit *or* you can instead win by...umm...instead failing the event and not winning... 
---
Yeah nvm on that, that's way worse and shit design not even trying to give the impression they tried.
---
&gt; **Known Recipes (Want) -** Yes, good on you there. My friends love this. 
---
Yes this was definitely a "Want;" however, the modding community already made this available on the Nexus... and I honestly preferred that one over Bethesda's.  That mod sorted the "known" plans to the bottom, and the unknown plans to the top.  Bethesda's patch does just the opposite, so you have to (annoyingly) scroll to the bottom of a merchant's list (or any other container type for that matter) to find the plans you don't already know.
---
I have plastic to trade if still looking for some?
---
I understand how every industry has parallels. But that doesn't mean we know the first thing about how they are actually budgeting things. For all we know they are waaay over budget with coders and they are dropping the ball huge. We have no idea what the day to day is over there  and to sit here and pretend we know better because we work in literally any modern 'product producing' industry is just ridiculous.  
---
So read Reddit and email a screenshot of the top posts to the devs? 
---
I could do this from my bedroom in 10 mins of work a day.
---
So are the "I'm leaving" posts, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Under the latest right to repair laws for John Deere tractors.. You now have the right to modify firmware / Software without voiding your warranty.  Televisions and phones have also gotten the software modification nod.  Game consoles got smacked hard, and now can not enforce their TOS about opening the console or having it serviced by a non-authorized person.  Apple has lost multiple lawsuits over similar things.
---
Removal of access to a 'service' if justified, is ok.   Locking someone out of a complete library of offline content that they have paid for, due to a violation of an online only service's rules...  yeah, not so much.  And I'm willing to bet, a court would agree.
---
I haven't had a crash in the last 40+ hours of gameplay. Legit like 5 sessions in a row, three with a friend who also did not crash. 
---
You asked in what other fucking major studio game does that shit happen, and I will tell you. Many of them. Because the reality is that this isn't something affecting anyone, or even proven to be affecting a majority. If anywhere near a majority of people crashed as often as you, they would be quitting and yelling about it way more.
---
What happened? Why is everyone saying they gave up? I feel lost
---
Well, it's only ten posts so it isn't the be-all end-all but I really wanted to get a feel for whether people actually were quitting.
---
Try it yourself, remindmebot is easy to use and see if you get the same
---

---
I was scared to do lots of things, scared to trade people, scared to pick up the legendary items people drop at whitesprings in case i grabbed too many at once and looked like a duper. It is absurd to me that instead of just fixing the exploits so that nobody accidentally flags themselves, you are expected to avoid entire game mechanics like crafting and trading to avoid seeming like a duper and losing your account... or are players supposed to guess how many you can craft? who the fuck is making these decisions
---
The will never allow modding in FO76 because that would compete directly with their Atom Shop, aka the only reason FO76 even exists. 
---
Exactly.
---
\[XB1\] Rocket Girl Outfit is not correctly hiding heavy combat armor chest piece since this most recent update.
---
It's odd but when wearing the outfit now my chest piece appears on the outside of the outfit. Tried other outfits and have no issues. So I know this is an issue with the outfit rather than the armor. This only happens with the chest armor. Limb armors are not appearing when wearing the outfit.
---
It now looks absolutely ridiculous. Wouldn't have even mentioned this if I hadn't spent 1800 atoms on the outfit. So kinda pissed.
---
What game are you playing, they've all been pretty awesome updates and I've bene playing since mid October.  This patch is the first one I've had a major problem with and that's just because i'm too lazy to go scrap my bulk junk.

Bethesda right now=challenge accepted  
---
:'D holotape is good
---
Please remember to re-add the fix for the unkillable enemy bug, I was playing last night (Xbox one) and I came across a level 22 bloat fly that I tried to kill with my instigating lever action, it‚Äôs health went to zero and jumped right back to 100%, and repeatedly replenished to the point where no weapon(even melee which seemed to be the fix to the issue originally) could do any damage. 
---
Amen to that 
---
next patch, more holotape game
---
Whatever works for you man.
---
I just tested and when I dropped my 20 pins, I saw zero change in weight. Meaning they aren't weighing at 0.1 (though my UI does say that's how much they weigh).
---
Either you're a liar or I'm a liar or we're both experiencing different things, which is also possible. But I'ma go with what I can see on my actual PC for now. xD
---
The way points are glitches for me , it keeps changing location 
---
Yeah, I don't particularly understand punishing the players left that still play the game. But, hey. They obviously don't give a flying fuck about the players.
---
Update; thanks to the very helpful and kind advice I found a plastic haven, Morgantown highschool an incredible amount.
---
But I am still in search of people to partner up with. I play a lot of 76 so multiple people in my friends list playing at different times would be a godsend this games so damn boring going the lone wanderer route.

If you don‚Äôt want to look that up post yours here and I‚Äôll add you right away
---
If caps are more easily obtained by the majority, while still maintaining a cap limit, and people are able to purchase and acquire the things they want, they don‚Äôt need to seek out the duper, thus making the dupers caps irrelevant. And puts everyone on the same balanced level. 
---
Max caps at 50k
---
Increase how many caps vendors have to 1k
---
Remove the fact vendors are connected and make each vendor have their own caps
---
Lower cap reset to 10 hours instead of 20 hours 
---
Players are happy, vendors are happy, duper‚Äôs are now irrelevant because Johnny can now afford that 3000 cap mutation serum
---
Problem solved. That was hard.
---
i'm not a lawyer but as far as i know only online games follow this rule.
---
I've had my bloodied gatling gun disappear. Support team said, thanks, duly noted, please fuck off. Only in more polite terminology.
---
It boggles my mind that FO76 was launched without any tools in place to regulate items. Surely it occurred to someone that it'd be a smart thing to be able to manipulate items from an admin perspective? This way you could literally just have deleted dupes and replaced legitimately lost items? Perhaps that's an idea the dev team needs to consider post haste.
---
I love this bot, because it makes it super easy to find exactly where my downvotes need to go. 
---
So now the SB loot pool will be down to a cheese wheel?
---
To most players, prime is utterly worthless. But if you farm queen or are in the cranberry bog almost always, then it might be. But 20% damage is not worth flux, the inability to find ammo or the damage reduction to most enemies.
---
Make that EXCEEDINGLY poorly. 
---
People with your reaction look are so confusing. This is the point of Reddit. For people to share their ideas and agree or disagree with each other. You sitting here saying not too is basically saying only agree with people. It's cancerous. And you telling me this, is contradicting yourself. I'm just saying people shouldnt overreact. Of course they haven't done a great job at this game. I've said that. I also believe it's childish to write any game off after 2 months. Especially one that is suppose to last years. 
---
Not quite, but it was close. I believe it's close to 21k or 22k without any ch or perks. The issue is they appeared so rarely that it took a while for it to even become common knowledge that you can buy them
---
Well played.
---
*laughs in New Vegas*
---
At least they didn't just re-spawl like I got the pleasure of.  Yeah, it's a thing, but I think it's lower on the list right now (squeaky wheels and that).

I still like the game. I believe that Bethesda will fix it. Likely because if they don't the PR will destroy all confidence in the company. They will be on the road to bankruptcy if they don't fix it.

Yeah that mission is kinda fucked up. Back track a little bit but don't go all the way up by the main entrance. It's down a dark corridor not far from where you're at.

Didn't they just roll out a patch of an older version of the game with bugs that were fixed previously? And didn't everyone start getting mad.

Ah so the whole "Everyone else is doing it, so it's ok."  justification.

And, the only reason these companies are doing it, is because the customers just don't give a shit.  If enough people stopped playing their games, or raised enough of a stink, they'd change, or at least back peddle.

As for 'good case' .. I don't know how they can look at 200 hours of game footage proving he wasn't duping, and showing he was in deed acting as a community bank for the people on his discord server, and say he's in violation of their tos.

I thought we were just citing single personal examples without context that were supposed to represent everybody's experience, but if you really want to know it was a level 25 nocturnal explosive laser pistol.

Wow, Bethesda. Why do you suck so hard now. 
---
No I want to one shot everything. 
---
Do you have a jetpack and or marsupial?  
---
I ask because there are spots where you can break through the collision and end up "between" the layers
---
It‚Äôs like a snow hurricane in Maine right now. Good times. 
---
Thank you guys. This is a really good start to improving credit with the players
---
"excessively high rate of item creation."  - did you craft these items at a high rate? like spamming space / E  or w/e
---
Yes I feel you. It's all because of the over nerfing and grind increase.
---
Are you on PC? I could really use ultracite mod plans.
---
The fact that you jump to that assumption, rather than accepting that 3 people on the internet agree with what I said, is quite hilarious.  
---
And even more yikes.

Op weapons that were heavily duped so alot of ppl were effected a nerf to those op weapons.
---
You know how you invest 3 perk/special points to get 20% more damage?
---
These guns had 2 affixes that added 200% more damage, 30 perks/levels worth.
---
Now they do 20%/25%
---
Oh and 5 perks/levels tossed in another 100% which was brought down too.
---
Previously duper weapons will not be able to go into pvp... its fairly obvious why you wouldnt want them in there.
---
I thought it was obvious but the amount of people taking it seriously makes me think I did too good of a job. Haha. 
---
My ability to open a standard support ticket was removed because I can't login.   
---
That's another beef I have with this whole process, No where except the email I got is it telling me I am banned/suspended. It actually says invalid user name or password.
---
Their ability to even tell you, you're banned properly is a bit flawed.  
---
And I think if they were more open with their TOS and they outright said if you do anything we consider illegitimate you not only lose your rights to play this online game, but access to every other game, online or offline and everything you've purchased for them as well, might be a hell of a deterrent. 
---
With your best friend adding a few hundred hours when you didn't want to play the tunnels in DC.
---
Needy, demanding little sods while I'm over here with my gauss rifle, just wanting a mod so I can take pot shots as a Scotchbeast, playing with my bulk scrap until it's my turn.  \*spins box of steel\*  Wheeee...
---
It's hard to describe from memory.  You'll find a dark corridor and it will be the first or second office on your left.
---
Yep sure did. And now my notifications are off enjoy the shittery and the smell of disappointment friend  
---
Only problem is...it's pointless.
---
Which is a shame, as we need some way to force scorchbeasts to land.
---
No, when VAC was first released, a VAC ban was an entire Steam account ban. I still remember the forum posts from ppl tgat lost access to their steam account 
---
This is patently incorrect.  Everyone knows that Soviet made weapons only require Cosmoline to keep functioning.  There MAY be a spring in there, but it does not require repairs, only more Cosmoline.
---
You just ain't about that grind
---
You contact via email ........
---
Seriously. I crafted up over 12k rounds of ultracite .50 cal the day I put a prime receiver on my bloodied explosive .50, and probably another 6k the day after that. They can't possibly be so stupid as to be sending these things out without first confirming item creation via some method other than crafting bench, can they?
---
 You can't post pics on this subreddit. 
---
It's the last preorder BGS is getting from me, and possibly the last purchase they'll ever receive from me.
---
Well this make it seem a little... better?
---
I give this patch 0/10 would patch again. But besides that, Im playing and will continue to play. I got so much stuff to do, just less than week ago I managed to join BOS. I still got plenty of places to go before I can join Enclaive. I kinda like every time to see a game company to have courage to make unpleasant desicions, like the TS and E nerfs. I won't applaud the specific manner in which they did it, but at least it solved one major problem.
---
And joining BOS made the bloody game eat up about 50 technical data I had collected because obviously I knew about the quest and have collected a lot of them, as they don't weight anything. Im thinking maybe I'll open up my first support ticket about it, but Im not really sure I should expect them to give me those back. And if they fix that bug without giving back those I lost, the hell I care because the bug doesn't affect me anymore. I hope.
---
I hope people would take less involved stance about the game and Bethesda. Like , hate, who really cares. Only thing matters is what you do. And you have freedom to choose what you do. So if you like the game just play it, if not, choose not to.
---
Nice to see a post that's fairly neutral.
---
Your post should be against the rules
---
I'm sure it's more than just that. Give me a break. They have to skim through shit comments to find actual issues. This argument we're having is worthless to this sub. So I'm sure that slows them down. 
---
All I was trying to say is dont be rude to the community manager. Your comment makes their job more tedious because they have to check the useless notification you left them. Yet you complain that they aren't fixing issues fast enough. When it's the dev team that fixes things. 
---
Be mad at the people who greenlighted this 
---
update. The people who just wanted to meet a deadline. The people who aren't interacting with the community to find the issues worth fixing. Those are who you should be pressing with questions on why things are the way it is. 
---
Hell I'm wasting my time telling you to do this when I should be doing it myself. It's just a slow night at work for me though.
---
People feel like they are being ignored, problems are going unresolved as they add new ones.   
---
I've personally got one foot out the door, and I've been desperate to help fix the many, many issues, and the attempts to help are falling on deaf ears.  
---
**shameless link**.  
---
Here's an idea...just sit and wait patiently.  Some of us have no ETA on our fixe and some of us have games that will never, ever, EVER been patched BECAUSE THEY'RE FROM THE 80'S..a week is nothing.  Chill, play with your scrap.
---
Over nerfed to shit. Melee still 15k dmg any of my range weapons didn't do that much damage pre patch. Why then to go and over nerf everything.. it's ridiculous.
---
But that's what I'm saying, everybody is just changing back to melee instead, as that is still effective. 
---
And of course a large portion of players would still use it, if they balanced it with other builds. It's fun using the weapons that blow stuff up and can affect multiple enemies at once. But the balance with other builds, would mean that there was a possibility of a better build out there, instead of TSE being the definitive best at a distance. 
---
That, in my opinion, would lead more people to explore other builds. 
---
And even if we have a TSE-focused audience for a long time to come, with a balanced build, who cares? (no offense)
---
It doesn't hurt anyone elses fun that I am able to blow stuff up, with a gun I legitimately earned. Especially not if the damage was balanced. Why do other people care what guns I am shooting at virtual pve enemies with? I never engage in PVP, always help other players, and have never deactivated pacifist mode. It just shouldn't be as big as an issue at some people made it. 
---
No mans sky is way more polished then fallout 76 as well which is saying something.
---
It's the same as my username for everything else, I might I think people could probably guess it if they had half a brain. What are they gonna do, send me spam or hate mail? I get that anyway. The spam anyway. Hate mail would at least be something new and interesting.
---
 *getting better with every patch* 
---
Could you explain how/where it has improved?
---
*There is always a risk to pre-order or buying the game on release, that is a risk we take as users.* 
---
Its been been 3 months, hardly pre-order/release. 
---
Im glad your enjoying the game, in a way so am I but like a lot of others we are sick of nerfs while bugs are left untouched or new ones introduced. 
---
Without the backlash do you think Bethesda or any other company would improve with nothing but fluffy threads to blow smoke up their asses?
---
Yep, anything that goes against your opinion should be blocked and posters should be banned!
---
Business Systems Analyst/Project Manager/Test Lead here... I 100% appreciate my developers. They work hard, and if they are salary are more often than not underpaid considering they often times pull 60 (or more) hour weeks. I also know they are just coding what they are told to code and have very little (if any) input on design decisions.
---
This was an experiment to see how many people and how long people will stay and play a game like this one.  It was worth it to them to do the research. They are still collecting it. Sadly, I believe we‚Äôve all been duped!!!
---
Happy Patch Day! The negativity seems to generally pick up when a patch is released, then it fades away gradually until the next one.
---
Yeah I have marsupial and teammate has both jetpack and marsupial. 
---
These should be fixed because it can break the PvP aspect of the game (become wanted, go hide here where no one can find/get to you). Think all those locations that allow this should be fixed.
---
Downvoted for explaining downvotes
---
maybe? I wasnt really paying attention to the speed. I play on ps4, so i I just pressed the X button until i ran out of material to craft them with. I probably pressed it pretty fast
---
willful ignorance. "IF anyone asks, you had no idea. You found it somewhere, it fell off a back of a truck"
---
Them quitting has nothing to do with my opinion. I don't care if they like the game or not.
---
Reading through this thread has been amazing this community(those of us who want to see it succeed and hope it succeeds)  is what I love about the Bethesda community they have a chance to make something amazing I plan on being here for the long haul if it takes a while I'll wait I just hope that the more casual players don't kill it by leaving too soon
---
...but I like the throw eveything into a pop and see what happens way of doing things.  The game didn't explode, we're all good.
---
I thought that too but you can also use the Mistress of Mystery outfit.  I agree it is sort of scummy :(
---
Game design team* management*
---
Poor developers taking all the hate...
---
To be fair, I already quit playing the game. So I was already one less twat on your server. What I'm bitching about is my loss of access to the other games I purchased on my Bethesda account. Actually good games like Fallout 1 for example, that Bethesda didn't make.
---
I know the feeling man. I've been grinding for Pump Shotgun and Plasma Grenade plans for a while now. Maybe one day.
---
How do you do 20k damage in melee?  I've got 3 total points in slugger, motion assist service PA (+2 strength), and a level 50 Furious Grognak's axe. I do just over 200 damage. 
---

I don't believe the Enclave knew about the Fujiniya Intelligence Base because then Modus would ask us to hack it so he could control the Liberators. They raised the DEFCON level partially by creating the Scorchbeasts and hacking government systems and causing massive panic. I think the DEFCON level only got high enough to reactivate the silos after everybody died.
---
After Skyrim Bethesda died. Reselling Skyrim 4+ times was a pretty big hint, I think.
---
And then creation club? Red flags *everywhere*.
---
Here to comment again! Hello.
---
So it was brought to light that the excavation power armor bug has returned. The one where it gives a ridiculous amount of increased weight that was never intended.
---
This was a bug you fixed in I believe the very first patch.
---
What this means, is your update, was an update, before any patches were implemented into the game whatsoever.
---
Just in case you weren‚Äôt sure which version of the game you patched, just letting you guys know it was the vanilla version.
---
Not that it‚Äôs gonna help your incompetence any, just seemed as though you were in patch 3 or 4. So no, it‚Äôs vanilla, day one. GG.
---
Yes and No, the law of unintended consequences is playing a part here.  
---
100% agree it needs to be fixed, especially for the PVP aspect, but honestly think some of the other more pressing things should be resolved first.
---
Nuh uh!  I still have to go to bed!
---
Dear ******
---
We understand you are having an issue with Hey Bethesda, when can we expect a fix do not being able to craft rare plans. After passing this on to our technical department we are happy to inform you this is not a bug but rather a new feature implemented in the beta phase of the game.  
---
After many hours spent sorting through fresh piles of our steaming feces we are proud to announce that we have found the next update for our great game. Due to the overwhelming positive feedback we have received in response to our January 29 patch we would like to announce our upcoming DLC!
---
For those out in the wastelands who would like a taste of what is to come, simply head into any restroom, take a giant steaming shit, and immediately begin to smear this hot feces all over your pearly white teeth while smiling greatly. 
---
Be sure to check the Atom Shop frequently. We will be sure to do more for content updates here than anywhere else in the game. 
---
Best regards Bethesda. 
---
Doesn't AI health and damage in Dying Light scale according to difficulty, not level? If you play on the harder difficulties you can't kill a single zombie with a starter weapon (at least, in reasonable time).
---
I was wondering how long you would try to keep ot up...
---
Gotcha, yes, increasing the CD by 40%? Was a terrible
---
Addition
---
wait which mechanic from a previous game? Just curious
---
Yes, noone should be interested in some dlc stuff before this over nerfing and game breaking "features" has been fixed and addressed.
---
My entire Bethesda account is locked. I cannot login to the launcher, so I cannot install the other games attached to my account.
---
"Down to"? Fuck, at least I could *eat* a cheese wheel.
---
I think the "'I quit' posts are getting old" posts are getting old.
---
It's not censorship, pin a fucking topic if needed, but there is a reason that most gaming communities don't allow I Quit posts. 
---
Thanks for posting these.
---
Good luck I was a die hard fallout fan and this patch just broke me there is no way Bobby pins should have reverted unless they were fixing the bugs on a old build...that is called incomperance. Second a QA team would have caught that bug as well as the other dozen bugs that come with every patch. There is no excuse. What other mmorpg games have received this much backlash with shit patches? 
---
Skyrim 76 made me lol. Of course modders did just finish Skyrim Together...
---
Never once did I complain about them not fixing issues.
---
My complaint is 100% with their response. SPEAKING OF WORTHLESS!!!!
---
They literally provide nothing to the community other than, " I will/have communicated that to the devs team."
---
How is that at all worthwhile to anything?
---
Here ya go.....
---
Call of the Fallout :  BlackNite.   An ever shrinking Rad Storm pushes friends and foes closer and closer to each other until they are forced to reach the ultimate showdown.  This isn‚Äôt your standard free for all.  With BlackNite, you get to play as 1 of 4 unique classes that align with the Unstoppables.   Will you be the Silver Shroud?  Will you be Manta Man?  How about you play as Grognak with a special Deathclaw skin (available for 2500 Atoms).   Be crowned King of Applachia by defeating 23 other players in fast paced Fallout gameplay you‚Äôre sure to love.
---
After having played 76 myself. I found it to be boring, I'm lucky in that I haven't been experiencing any game breaking glitches or bugs. But i have found wandering around the world is a little boring when you don't have any friends and trying to communicate with people online without a headset is a pain. I regard 76 as a failed experiment, Bethesda clearly can't handle a game of this size at launch like it can with ESO. I don't think they need to shut down and go out of businesses because of 76. (If bethesda ain't around who's gonna make your fallout and elder scrolls games?) If you thought 76 was bad imagine a Fallout game made by Activision, or Ubisoft, or EA. I'll still go up to bat for Bethesda's defense because I am still loyal but I am moving onwards from this disappointing mess
---
Ahhh there it is thank you 
---
But knowing the pain gives greater pleasure lol 
---
Are the materials bulked?
---
Oh, I was on ps4 so the game launches from the application
---
I agree that LadyDevann has been wonderful and on point with fairly timely answers. the problem though,is whether anyone at Bethesda cares about what is being reported back.
---
You didn't really read this did you? 
---
They bludgeoned the TSE problem when a scalpel would have done the trick. The universal explosive damage nerf was lazy in the extreme. Apparently you noticed the bobby pins, good for you. Not only did they *not fix* the duping glitch, they rolled back previous fixes and gave dupers back methods that previously had been taken away.  At least they made much needed QoL adjustmen- oh wait, just kidding, they made bulk items impossible to craft with. I'm pretty sure they just copy-paste some innocuous and generic comment about stability improvements to each set of patch notes at this point and cross their fingers that nobody notices server stability is getting worse. What can you even defend at this point? They haven't provided more content because , fixes... but they also have failed to fix? Just what are they doing besides sitting on each other's fists?
---
Really? I found a holotape in the bunker talking about reactivating it to raise the DEFCON. I also got a key thingy for Fujiniya (I think. Something about that base) but I skipped it using the Nuke Code.
---
Greedy much?  No.
---
Oki doki. I think a lot of people will enjoy that. 10/10 would hotfix again.
---
It‚Äôs a different experience, best described by a fallout like mmorpg. It has all the elements but is fundamentally different. 
---
Problem is he‚Äôs ...
---
Probably for a reason dick.
---
If there is a way for a world to disconnect you in one of these areas, then it should be fixed quickly since it'll allow some form of duping again.
---
Urban Dictionary told me that no one from Boston calls Boston Beantown.
---
üëç
---
Thank you for banning dupers. 
---
This was pretty exciting news as I stopped playing fo76 after the rampant duping. I'm thankful you're being credibility back to fo76 and punishing those that were hurting the community
---
Thanks and keep the bans coming 
---
What were they thinking designing and releasing a game like this.
---
Thank god! They finally fixed the real problem /s
---
Makes more sense than 90% of the posts on here +1
---
You'll always get owned in PvP. If you're running a finished build that doesn't use automatic weapons and you've got a good weapon you'll one-shot anyone wearing any Power Armor they want with any defense perks they can get. Ultimately players are glass cannons at the core and PvP needs a damage rebalance on player-to-player damage and nerfing classes of weapons will do nothing ever. The game was balanced around raidin' 'n' rompin' PvE with spongy enemies so players need to have a high damage cap...but then players have little durability to deal with NPC damage outputs since leveling up doesn't increase your health. So these players can now do one second of their regular DPS and immediately turn pretty much any other player into a doggie bag and bottle caps.
---
Shitshow, and they want to make servers around that trash before taking the faceroll festival and turning it into real combat.
---
/r/fo76FilthyCasuals?
---
You found me
---
If you dont care, whyd you make a post about them?
---
You can easily get six hundred caps just opening the game and selling scrap, not including what you get by playing.  Learn to budget.
---
Well that's kinda cool, as it is in game. I guess maybe because one aspect of the 4(5?) is in game then it's not really pay to win. I dunno. The toy one was neat, but didn't make sense with autoscrapping. If we could have marked toys as non-scrap then it would have been better.
---
Most of the I quit posts are articulated by players who have invested serious time. They're fans. They have a point to make. Let them. It is censorship if you delete those posts (which was happening) whether you like it or not. I suppose changing the rules to disallow them isn't censorship but it's shitty at this point. 
---
If you do get back in touch with them you could try suggesting that, if possible, they track your data changes. If they can see that you got a sudden spike in inventory goods on one day in a short time that didn't repeat, that would support your explanation. Cause if you were duping it I assume it would take notably longer than just looting a paper bag.
---
I had that prior to current patch, thought current patch fixed that.
---
You should go back to Fortnight
---
Hey I thought about living as close to the Nuka plant as well. I scouted alot around the area and couldnt find a good place that would have a great view of the plant or anything. Got a pic of your camp and your view of the plant would love to see!
---
I don't play this game because I've been waiting for it to get better/fixed before I spend the money, and I have to say I've never seen a game community TRY as hard as this one. I would have given up months ago. Bethesda completely wasted the goodwill of a community willing to put up with a lot of BS. It's too bad.
---
Well I mean you kept the duped items, so can you really complain? 
---
I just grinded from lvl 86-95, while still having a lvl 77 and only need one achievement. Also have 20k caps obtained legitimately no duping or trading or anything. I am alll about that grinds.
---
But I am also about bringing better ideas to the table than the people employed by this Shitbird studio.
---
Want a strong economy, I just laid the foundation to very very easily make a strong economy. 
---
I've been told after sharing my story that the primary duping method that was patched (and then got unpatched by this update, WTF) was focused around crafting a few hundred of the same weapon in an attempt to force a crash. So I think crafting weapons is what set off the flag  
---
it is beyond me how I was supposed to know that IF IM NOT A DUPER AND NEVER HAVE DONE IT TO KNOW HOW TO NOT REPLICATE SOMETHING SIMILAR TO IT
---
I did two Uranium Fevers yesterday plus Mayor for a Day, and the complement of 2-shot weapons I took along for post-nerf testing did fine. The one TSE I own was still useful and played comparably to how it did before (NB I am not super-perked into Demolition, etc.).  Tagged groups easily, and chewed Colonel Gutsies up when necessary.
---
Maybe I just wasn't using them right before, but I don't think this patch ruined my weapons.
---
Meanwhile the game reset quest progress and as of today I don't get any raw materials from scrapping, so there's THAT little detail...
---
Not a problem. 
---
It's the same for me. It's exactly everything you said except I have maybe 250 hours.  I'm just bored now, tired of just repeating the same activities constantly.  If the new content doesn't add new huge maps to visit, I don't think I will be coming back.  I might pop in at every update but I don't feel the urge to invest any more time in this game.  I was so into it at first, but if you're still defending this game and you just started it, you'll see soon enough. If you still like it because it's just a world you like being in, I completely understand but even that at first I loved just logging in and scavenging all evening but even that gets to you at some point. With this survival update coming, I feel we already lost the game completely for us adventurer lovers. Absolutely not interested in it! Also giving more incentives to play in Survival mode doesn't go well with me.  Starfield better be good...oh it better be good because this time, I'm not buying it at all until I am sure it's not a buggy mess.  Fo76 made me change my view of Bethesda completely and not for the better.  I wanted Fo76 so much to be my next WoW, I guess I'll have to wait 1 or 2 expansions before it becomes good again (or will it?)
---
From what I gather community managers are basically middlemen between the fans and the devs, so that the devs can get info on what the fans want without having to actually interact with them and risk embarrassing themselves.
---
That's exactly what happened, and they finally admitted it today, Version control failure.  
---
I learned this lesson, painfully, as an author a long time ago, and I'm still working on recovering from it (edits into a ESP that corrupted).  
---
It's a rookie mistake, and it shouldn't happen..  
---
All I can personally do is try one last time 
---
You can change all your perk cards and re-arrange your specials every time you level up.  I WOULD however like an increase to the S.PE.C.I.A.L.S  Eight is NOT enough.
---
My biggest fear is that this is the kind of thing that can kill a franchise. Look at ME: Andromeda... future ME titles were put on hold because of the poor response.
---
Not vendor farming. Farming, farming. Where else do they drop?
---
Spent 10 minutes walking to the bunker, getting the quest for a keycard, tracking the bot down, shot it once... game crashes. I shrug my shoulders, turn off this buggy, unstable mess and played a game I enjoy instead.
---
Frame rate drops when just walking. Once a bad guy enters the frame, instant frame rate drop. i can't even aim correctly. 
---
The game is getting more stable. Nerfing TSE is the best thing done so far, even though it had negative effects for pure explosive builds. I have played many games that took way longer than 3 months to get straightened out. But im the kind of guy that can leave a game for a year and then check back on it, without crying about it.
---
Everyone should have from the start. Bethesda should know this is not ok. This is the lowest of lowest things that company has done in decades in releasing such a title.
---
Yeah, why doesn't the kitchen stove work as a crafting bench? Instead we've got to use the ugly cooking stove. Likewise,  the various grills should be funtional as well. 
---
I‚Äôm a programmer and I know every time I‚Äôm caught fucking something up that affects my coworkers I get very pissed at myself and determined to get it right when I fix it. 
---
I imagine it‚Äôs the same way for most people who care about what people think of the quality of their work. 
---
I can only hope that is most people and not a minority of folks. 
---
Lmao can you help me just one more time the way points are fucked again, where do I go extract the data from this holotape 
---
Do ***NOT*** tell me everything Abbie did is pointless. I will *shank* you.
---
Hi All, A hotfix will be available to address this late this week or early next week.  
---
You can see more info on the upcoming hot patch [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alie1l/hotfix_coming_for_issues_introduced_in_patch_5/) 
---
Well in the terms of mmorpgs.. i played final fantasy 11 for about 12 years, my actual play time tracked by the game was measured in years. I still never completed everything in that game. There were always things to do and things to find. I had all jobs but 3 maxed at 99 so still 3 to lvl.
---
Ive played fallout 4 down each story line, 5 builds, all 100+.
---
Diablo 2 certainly not a major triple a game but i played it for 8 years hunting items 16 different lvl 99 builds..
---
Diablo 3 still playing it, 5 different builds. 
---
I dont know off hand how many hours i have in 76, other than im lvl 192, and im not finding much else to do other than farming for bullets and repairs. So there is a definite lack end game to occupy people.
---
They are wanting 76 to be an mmorpg. Mmorpgs are meant to go on for years to sustain a player base. Its not meant to be like most games 1 and done playthrough kinda thing like most games.
---
Other mmorpgs come to mind as long term playing WoW, everquest, and the like. So being their shot at a full on mmorpg they fell kinda short on long term sustainability when its done in less than 3 months.
---
Im also seeing it more, but when I kill all enemies around, Im fully sneaking again.
---
Dood, they're banning dupers now. This is a huge positive step to making the community great again 
---
I had one crash just before I put in the code. I got to keep the keycard, but I was still oh so pissed.
---

RE: Incident: 190116-000046 
---
 *I am using Pack Rat, Scattershot, Shotgunner, Expert Shotgunner. All leveled to a max of 3. This should reflect a total strength of 12 but it is showing 13.*
---
I reported this on  01/16/2019 and after running diagnostics and fixes support wanted me to try nothing fixed it and they finally told me to put in a bug report.  After this latest patch its still unresolved.  If you can reference the incident I provided there is all the info plus screenshots.
---
Developers don't make decisions on what they code. That's on game design team.
---
They also don't do version control. That's on the Change Management team. 
---
Vendor Bot Phoenix was selling some one time too, but they‚Äôre not hard to get anyway you can just shoot down cargobots.

I want my copy of Fallout 1 &amp; 2 back, among other things. My paltry prizes for playing the pathetically broken Fallout 76 and attempting to be an advocate for the game and trying not to bash it. But they've made it really hard on me these past few weeks. I stopped playing the game 2 patches ago, after 600 hours of gameplay.  
---
You'll notice I had no outcry when initially banned. I figured if I lost access to 76, kinda sucks if the game gets better later on down the road, but it's not exactly a huge loss. When I found out I can't login to anything Bethesda, get my other games, or otherwise use my account at all because of it. AND the company gave me instructions to respond to the email and failed to give any response to my email after 4 days, it's then I got pissed. I mean if you're gonna tell me I'm banned is I'm banned and I'm SOL, then at least have the customer service decency to tell me my appeal is denied. But I'm shut out of everything and my only line of communication I was given is ignored. That's a dick move for a big company like Bethesda to make.

It exists ... I've seen it ... and took a screenshot of the guy that was wearing it:  [http://immortalknightz.com/uploadimage/uploads/a12603d020c308e90ba3de3db857e1d9.jpg](http://immortalknightz.com/uploadimage/uploads/a12603d020c308e90ba3de3db857e1d9.jpg)

Have you been playing the game? Do your stealth boys work properly? The secret nerf changes? The nerf changes period. Broken mechanics flying players, the list goes on. Holy bugs that were in beta reported and still broken. The game was never in release state and should have never been released. Maybe release as in development fine then I would understand the bugs because it's under development. However this is a AAA game which there are standards for and they didn't hit a single one. This game at best is sub par. Now there is a lot of good in the game but the studio refuses to acknowledge there screw ups.
---
Thats because a player sold it there
---
I think it's less about not getting what you want, and more about different from advertised and piss-poor management.
---
&gt; As of 1/29 patch, can fast travel to any player (unclear if this was intentional)
---
Oh wow got to go test that :)
---
where were you when 45 hp ruined everything
---
And that's just another opportunity to give them more money.
---
Hey, Ho! If you‚Äôre here to complain, you‚Äôre better off waiting for a train! Hey, Ho!
---
 They don't host them here as its too much of a load. 
---
 In r/Morrowind I post em' and Reddit hosts em'.
---
Np. Did that mission a few times so I know it's a bitch with the messed up markers.
---
4/5 times killed. The one time she lived only myself and 1 other guy were shooting her everyone else was killing legendaries between hiding in the shack. The last time we killed her with literally 1 second left it was awesome until her body was gone and no one could find it. 
---
Massively unpopular opinion : it's not that big of a deal and it's actually just a very vocal *minority* of players who are at all pissed. No praise for constantly available plans after bitching about server hopping. No love for known plans because if I can't carry 400+ bobby pins then this game is trash /s. This deluge of posts about *I give up* and all this weirdness people are trying to project is 1000x worse than anything wrong in the game. Not once have I met an explosives build, just kids trying to be as powerful as possible by exploiting mechanics to turn themselves into superheroes. I praise Bethesda for making any sort of challenge in their usually underwhelming/easy games. I put a weight limit on myself in 4, and try not to max out anything that would make Skyrim a cake walk. I'm the player that's been ignored for a fucking decade and I'm tickled pink that things like condition of items and scarcity of certain components is a core piece of gameplay. Hopefully this drop of water in the literal sea of piss that is this sub shows not every player is mad with this update.
---
Made most of my caps crafting and selling power armor. Got lucky with finding plans for mods people want. Now everyone can go and grab the plans. Here's hoping people would rather dish out a much lower amount for an install than 6k a plan to do it them selves
---
Maybe if you gave them enough time, they would fix it. Would you rather wait for some people to tell you something and fix it all at once? Or one by one making the severs unplayable?

plus people are just starved for attention in general, look at social media.
---
god forbid they get their money's worth 
---
Instead of banning these posts, we could just **ban reddit instead**.
---
Just be careful. We‚Äôve had too many deaths already.
---
Hahaha I think that's sarcasm so I will accept defeat since you have the approval of 3 people. 
---
Ha! This is fantastic, sir. 
---
There is, as a matter of fact, one spring in an AK-47. Ask your gun nut bros.
---
You could be right. But it's hamfisted as fuck. The shooting mechanics and player mechanics and game engine are shit for a PVP game. The engine makes the PUBG jank look smooth and polished and responsive.
---
Would you prefer Bethesda not interact with us at all? They've got people answering questions and relaying issues to the devs and you're downvoting it?
---
Yeah lmao the marker was pointing Morgon airport at one point 
---
How much are they?
---
beuase its reddit full with stupid peoples without sense of humour.
---
I had probably a few hundred legionaries of mostly armor, but also lots of weapons. Lots of spare ammo for types people don't commonly use. Fusion cells, 44 ammo, 38 ammo, etc.   
---
Like literally we threw nothing away. If someone in my crew didn't want to carry something I had them bring it to the mule. After a while it became a habit for everyone to come have a "drop party" around my mule so I could hoard everything people didn't want. Also often got donations of items from high end players for me to give out to newer players or their alts. We were playing with 8-12 people on the regular any given play session for a long time after the game came out and not always the same 12 people would come out. I also started recruiting people from nuke zones to be in my group. Anyone who had area chat turned on and wasn't a complete dick was welcome to share resources, knowledge and have fun with us. I was building a community.
---
&gt; At one point the game was down to $29 - I would say it's absolutely worth $29 to play with friends for hours and hours.
---
That's a great price. I would also have to convince them to play though, and that is not easy. Will probably take another look in three months once mods and options to fully turn off PvP are available. 
---
Some of it‚Äôs that, but I‚Äôve been playing since the beginning, and other than wasting all my rare stuff on SAMs there was no way for me to kill them
---
bye
---
ESO (run by BGS's parent company ZMO) does this too, all your stats at level one has scaled up to match level 50 and the only thing that really matters is your skills and gear (plus passives later)
---
It happens every patch. Do we need a new topic every time someone quits the game?
---
i just got banned for crafting like 10 gamma guns to scrap for mods. the email asked me to explain the "excessively high rate of item creation."

With the current state of the game, they should be fucking thanking us for even logging in to keep the community alive, not banning us for things that they never said were against the rules
---
I'm am aware. Main is a demo build, doesn't change the fact of my statement about these weapons and their issue. But yes I have 63 on me.
---
Looking for attention and wanting back pats from their hate boner circle jerk group more often than not. 
---
For a new and totally original response...üëç
---
why block them when they can be mocked for their awful opinions. 
---
I'm still playing but I'm playing with vengeance a raider build here we go.
---
it would be nice if they just removed the platforming and made it optional for an extra buff or something. 
---
People said it was bad during the bad. You are a sucker for falling for it. 
---
I love Bethesda but I didn‚Äôt buy into this train wreck. 
---
Bethesda's been flirting with this ever since Oblivion. I know it's beating a dead (armored) horse by this point, but their overpriced Horse Armor DLC made them a pioneer of the "overcharge for minimal effort" business model that is so pervasive in microtransactions these days. Don't forget the Steam mods and Creation Club attempts either.
---
Rdr2 is great it was my mid break fo76 game, didn‚Äôt do online so no p2w mechanics happened kinda wish I played the first one now
---
Just because the game was simply launched and playable doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt become a failure of a game thus far. The game literally took a step back in this patch, old bugs reintroduced, and the changes were way overdone. They could have taken the time to fine tune things rather then just reduce damage by 70% on TSE. Not to mention another rookie mistake, no beta testing or details besides ‚Äúnerf incoming‚Äù then bam patch notes. There‚Äôs a lot lacking from this game not only in content, but also in development. 
---
Yea loved all "just got the game, don't understand the negativity, love the game so far" posts that kept popping up
---

---
No.  Melee weapons.  I developed my character and sank points into specific categories to support a specific build.  Nerf comes along and my sniper build is useless.  I scramble to find another weapon.  I have 4 strength and am doing close to 700 damage with a non-legendary level 50 power first.  
---
That's cool and all, but that's not the way I want to play.  I spent many hours finding the perfect weapon for my build and now it's useless compared to something I just built off the bench.  Re-speccing everything is going to take forever.  And melee just sits there being ridiculously strong from the start.   
---
So no, nerfing damage is not your answer and never was.  Ban people who take advantage of your games.  Create separate servers for people who want to pvp.  And roll back this last update completely while you sit down and get to know your own game.  Two hours of testing your own game would have told you things are seriously wrong. 
---
My brother and I started our game together and on our first trip to Flatwoods a level 100+ guy came up to us and gave us like 20 plans, 100+ stimpacks, radaway, rad-x, and like 200+ of each type of bullet and energy pack. I felt guilty taking it, since I thought it would cheapen the game experience and it must be important to him. I dunno, it just seemed like too much to me. At level 33, I dump that stuff everywhere because I'm sick of not being able to sell ammo or junk it and it is taking up too much space
---
/u/Ladydevann This attempt at bringing balance had unintended consequences IMHO. I am a casual player because of work, college, kids, etc. and I only play maybe an hour a day. Most of the time I play by myself, and this nerf made half of the map to difficult to venture into. Prior to the nerf the medic's shotgun that I had (3-star, level 25, exploding bullets for area damage) would do about 240 damage, now it does around 125 with the three shotgunner perks equipped. I ventured out Harper's Ferry and was attacked by 5 level 60 super mutants and 3 stimpacks later I barely made it out alive, and that doesn‚Äôt seem right at level 127. I have seen the videos with some of the two shot exploding guns that did well over 400 damage, and I can see why you would want to bring those down. However, for a casual player you took away the only real weapon that I had. I think that this nerf should be rolled back for the weapons that did a reasonable level of damage, because this has really put half of the map all but off-limits to me. I really can't express how disappointed I am that this is even an issue, but I'm willing to hold out hope that the team can get this right. I have enjoyed the Fallout series up to this point and I have tried to overlook the myriad of IMO negative points of this new format but this has definitely impacted my loyalty and my willingness to buy another Bethesda game is also waning.
---
all they do is nerf and out nothing out for the game there is only so many times i can kill the SQ and get anything good.
---
Mutter mutter mutter grumble.
---
I though that complaining about people complaining about complainer where the saddest of sad.
---
If you play a game in its unfinished form, you can‚Äôt complain if you reach the highest level and explore everything before the game is ready. 
---
I didn‚Äôt like the crybaby‚Äôs actually thinking I was on their side about the duplicated TSE‚Äôs getting a nerf. 
---
That's not bad. I'd buy a few.
---
You're stupid.
---
Yeah it was pretty clear. I wish there was just another subreddit for people still playing the game. These posts are so useless and there‚Äôs soooooo many.
---
considering end gives you what, 5 per point? that's the equivalent of 9 endurance points.
---
and I think you can stack it further.
---
Probably also cause steam offers refund even when the game is played and Bethesda does not. 
---
Okay i guess i dont have do that anymore when im finaly get to a point where i can launch one
---
The Gauss rifle is weak?
---
some people don't like moving their camp after building it up. (going with the story we are supposed to be rebuilding america and we can't be doing that by constantly relocating our settlements/homesteads.)
---
Obviously. 
---
But as I said in my email to Bethesda, I would take a full character wipe if the excess items were an issue. And if they've fixed the exploits like they said they did, whats the harm in it? Just get rid of the items, I'll start over, everyone goes home happy.   
---
Might even be fun to start from scratch. Something entertaining to do after playing nuke zones for 500 hours.
---
Yeah, I could understand wiping the account and revoking the key for 76/not allowing you to purchase or activate it on that account again. But banning from all games? 
---
I would guess that also includes creation club access on games brought through steam/console as it requires a login?
---
Gotta get the cancer out
---
I really have nothing to do with this im just reading the post for information but your accusations against this guy are pretty extreme based off of no evidence the guy posted in detail what has happened with a link to the email and conversation, if by any chance you have any proof of this guy actaully being caught or the other guy being paid off than please by all means post a link but if you dont than your comments are completely irrelevant and empty with only one purpose behind which is to spread negativity and hate over a unfortunate situation, if you having nothing to back this than please keep your comments to yourself.
---
I'm not saying it's game breaking. But it is an added in game stat bonus that you can purchase. Slippery slope?
---
Checked 20 generators in the last 2 days. All empty. Even the ones inside places most don't bother to visit twice.
---
Crit by wall of text.
---
Luckily "wall of text" has been duped so many times that it was just nerfed and my "Don't give a s$%\^" armor was just repaired for the 5th time today.
---
Well ya I'd love a dog buff for sure, and hats off to you for 63 I am envious!!!
---
Youtube it. Plenty of videos on it. If you are only doing 200 damage then you are doing it wrong even without bloodied.
---
I wish there was a player count in game, just so I could see how many people have actually left. I am one of them, I've finally decided to start playing Hitman 2 after having it collecting dust on the side because I was enjoying 76 so much. But with both my builds (Sneak Rifle which mained TS Lever Action, and PA Heavy Gunner which is now just terrible because TSE doesn't help .50 or my minigun anymore) being useless and not wanting to start another character, I give up. 
---
Level 140 rifle and level 128 Heavy going to take a break.
---
See you soon, hopefully.
---
You load 16 tons and what do you get? 
---
I'm scared shirtless of those unstoppable costumed death squads. 
---
Bethesda should hire you to write random self-deprecating notes around all the many pointless map locations so at least I'd have a cheap laugh to maybe look forward to.
---
Not anymore when all range weapons have been ruined.
---
Gaaaaaaaaarrrrryy...GARY!
---
Why would you play this instead of the dozens amazing games that have come out in the past few months? 
---
Totally valid. It's just an added stat bonus that's purchasable.
---
A new, better story, better planetary generation, better animals, overall it looks better graphically. Lost of gameplay changes that make it less tedious, base building. Customizable player models. It‚Äôs still not near what people were hoping, but it‚Äôs pretty fun now. 
---
Fuck
---
Congrats they will now fix that.
---
I bought the game knowing there would be bugs because they warned us about them. But I wasn't expecting to see bugs from Fallout 4! I dealt with the bugs in Fallout 4, and I still deal with them because I still play it as well. It has only been a few months so I still have hope.
---
The creation engine has been a solid workhorse for many iterations. 
---
It renders nice looking static objects, does a decent job producing living environments and swaying trees, etc.
---
It fails at anything resembling a ragdoll physics approach, as can be seen by the almost choreographed deaths of many beasts and enemies. (Kinda like sprites...)
---
So yes, a new engine will probably do wonders, but also a competent set of drivers will be able to implement something resembling GOOD. 
---
Hmm... He must be enjoying a video game regardless of its issues
---
Hey Joe
---
If they made some sort of public announcement, I never saw it, and no one mentioned it on our discord server.  I'm sure there would have been rumblings there about it if any of our group knew of such a thing, simply due to the amount and value of items that were stashed on the mule. 
---
One thing that gets me is everyone seems to think there's a way to distinguish duped items, from originals.  As someone who's modded the creation engine, and someone who works with databases.  I can tell you, duped items are exact copies of the original. The process of duping causes the games database engine to 'roll back' and restore a previous save state, which creates two copies of an object. There is no way to tell them apart, even on the code level. This is due to the ancient database engine that Bethesda is using, and their own 'fail safe roll back' code.  If they were to upgrade to a modern engine, like SQL, they could track the creation, transfer, and ownership of each item, and easily spot \*And Remove\* duplicated items.  
---
But they can't, through their own damn negligence. 
---
As I said in a previous post, there is no crime in hovering up the contents of bags on the ground, no matter how someone wants to try to color it.  Everyone checks bag they run across for valuable items that someone may have dropped intentionally, or by accident.   I really don't care if it's done at white spring during a nuke, or in the middle of a dupers camp.  
---
In the end, it's pixels and electrons, and imagination. 
---
We understand how the division of labor works.
---
What we're saying is, maybe the cosmetic item team doesn't need as many people on it until you fix your utterly broken $60 game.
---
Actually I screwed up there. I was initially going to use Subaru in my example but then I didn't want to drag Subaru into this. I'm an Ambassador. RIP  
---
I forgot to change all the references to Toyota.
---
I have a tse and I killed myself a lot, the real thing I miss was the fact as a solo player it allowed me to play more and farm less which made it fine to play hopping event to event no a cap run find good legendaries, the real shit part is that my ts rifle is now shit, in fact does only a hair more damage than my mole miners gauntlet with full strength and no perks now
---
Really? Both are same level and both are void of effects that would cause that?
---
"These aren't my pants."
---
I‚Äôd recommend melee of the two. Stealth builds have a tougher time in this game since the amount of enemies have increased and once they find you it can suck
---
Not sure if they nerfed it or just made it extremely haphazard. 
---
Tonight I spawned in Lewisburg,  I was greeted by a massive horde of high level glowing ghouls, the kind is reserved only for  the white springs nuke zones. 
---
FOUR OF THEM dropped legendary items. 
---
None of the legendary stuff was spectacular: was very similar to the stuff you find in a white springs nuke legendary farming sessions. 
---
But... it was in Lewisburg. That is just... weird. 
---
I had the ammo, stimpaks and weapons to successfully take them out solo. 
---
But it was a really odd place for these types of legendary enemies to spawn.
---
Many of us like the game, bugs and all.  Just because YOU don't like it, in no way means the rest of us to have to give jut up just so you can get your pwecious five (guess what, they're not working on it snow, they won't be working on it anytime soon, the next two are Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield \[two words?\].  I LOVE everything about FO76.  The world, the characters, even the little NPC robots are adorable and I want to squeeze them.  I even feel bad for most of the enemies in the game, something I RARELY did for FO3 or 4 (trust me, it gave me great pleasure to ruin the Brotherhood, the Institute, and the wannabe Enclave).
---
Yes, there are bugs...welcome to gaming.  If you have not glitched through the map while playing a multiplayer game and had your party laughing maniacally at you while you tried to figure out how to get back out without dying and losing all "da loot', you haven't really played.  I've done it in Diablo, I've done it in WoW...I will do it in the next game that comes down the pike (because somehow my RL clutziness extents online as well and I WILL find the missing wall/floor/earth).  Hell, even in FO4 I got clipped through a few buildings while being hit/had the game crash/lost stuff/accidently scrapped my only weapons (uh...don't ask).
---
The game isn't all good, but it's not also all bad...and right now the good far, far out weighs the bad. for many of us.
---
No one said not to enjoy it. I still play every day. But I also comment on other subreddits instead of dedicating hundreds of comments a day to how wonderful FO76 is.
---
Posting threads about I quit posts should be banned
---
I have God of War.  Didn't get into it.  Prey, didn't get into it.  Nothing catches my imagination or interest beyond a few sessions like this does.
---
Hell, I spawned into my base on sign in, today, and got beaten to death by Mutants before I could move.  And I didn't care.  I just respawned and blew them apart with my gatling.
---
Melee needs to be nerfed to and some other things needs buffs, but all things cant be fixed over night.
---
I agree the cancer has got to. Thing is, this is some aggressive cancer. They cut some out, meanwhile it‚Äôs still spreading somewhere like liquid.
---
I just hope they adjust the weight cap by a few thousand pounds. Some weapons and armor weights are pretty high making the amount of side items able to be stored pretty small if you don‚Äôt have the perks or stars for weight reduction.
---
I started playing BL2 again, with my wife who picked it up at x-mas.
---
BL2 is a coop, openworld-ish, loot shooter that is everything Fallout76 should be with the appropriate flavouring.
---
I also have a TSE, but its a totally broken mechanic. It just goes to show how bad and grindy and boring FO76 is when it basically gets removed and there isn't anything fun.
---
I understand this but Bethesda does fall under the Zenimax umbrella. There has to be some communication between these various studios that are owned by Zenimax. Its not even a matter of engines or coding. Its basic concepts that the ESO team could have warned the developers about far in advance. Things like "hey, you need to figure out a way to stop the duping glitches", " hey, the players seem to like being able to communicate with each other", "make sure there's plenty to do and plan on adding more every couple of months". They could have communicated many of the lessons learned by the ESO team over the last 5 years. After all, ESO got off to a rocky start but its stronger than ever 5 years later. And Fallout 76 is all but dead after a couple of months.
---
tbh i call this their test run
---
I crafted and scrapped for like 100 leather right arms and about 30 radium rifles for mods last weekend. No ban so far and I highly doubt that's ever gonna happen
---
Bye.
---
No. That's just not the way to go to nerf everything :D nerfing a TSE should have been about balancing things, not taking things away. Ts stays the same, E goes from 100 to 25 would have do that. No touching of the demo card, literally no-one asked for it.
---
True, but its not immersive. You could just make fat man ammo extremely rare or make the reload time very long, or a mix of the two. 
---
There's better ways to balance weapons than unrealistic damage figures.
---
and they wil change the game free to play...
---
I played for about a month after release, but I still come here hoping they've actually done good for the game. That's the problem though. I can't play how I want to play because everything I want to use breaks after 5 seconds and takes an entire list of mats to fix, all while doing no damage then they keep nerfing anything fun so pretty much the only thing usable is melee weps in PA.
---
And I am doing something else, FFXIV is getting big updates and a new expansion. Destiny 2 isn't the most fun, but at least it gets content every so often. I even picked up Dark Souls 3 since it was $25 for deluxe ed so I could own it on pc and ps4.
---
But 76? It's just a chore. I want it to be fun so I can play it with all my FO loving friends.
---
Platform?
---
Yeah, paid a reasonable price for my tse shotgun. I freely admit it was OP. The nerf took it from broken, past reasonable damage output, and into the realm of uselessness. They went too far. 
---
I've literally never had a game crash like this. Ever. On OG Gameboy, gb color, gameboy advance, DS, PC, mac, N64, Gamecube, ps2, 3, 4 ,xbox 360, xbone, Wii, Wii u, or switch - all systems or platforms I've owned and put hundreds and thousands of hours into.  Also, have you not read the posts for the last several months of people having all kinds of issues? Or noticed how often 'stability fixes' are implemented in their patches? All I can say is that my game crashes all the freaking time, and so does my wife's, and my two friends who play. The amount of time we've spent waiting for someone to re-open the game and re-load is hilarious. You are one of the lucky ones. If I didnt have such an addictive personality I'd have put this shit down and gone back to 7 Days already. 
---
Good. All of you should be banned. Bye.
---
You mad the game you like is a flop with a dying player base?
---
It‚Äôs good to see the community embracing the role playing aspect of Bethesda Soft-works LLC
---
That's where I am right now. I doubt I'll play my lvl121 character again. I bought the game for my best friend as a birthday present because he had already finished rdr2, and pissing him off is what I do. 
---
At lvl7 (him) and 9 (me), we got the tourism quest and got to the water park to find 5 lvl50 behemoths.  One of which was a 3* (boy was that drop underwhelming). Caught them in environmental traps that kept them from killing us, he finished 2 and I got the other 3. Probably the most fun we've had so far, huge weapon repair cost not withstanding. 
---
Eff 'em.  Plenty of room in the dumpsters out back.
---
great read.  stuck thru the whole thing.  every thing you said has happened to me also.  you got lucky and another game you enjoy came out for you (KH3).  unfortunately for me, my next game, mechwarrior 5 mercs was delayed by PGI because they felt the game was.................NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!  (HINT, HINT Bethesda)
---
i bet PGI saw what was happening to Beth over FO76 and got a clue.  because PGI did this, i spent the $100 for the prepurchase, instead of spending that in the atom store.  sorry beth, but you lose out.  i can not reason out why i should spend more money on a broke dick game.

so for now, i just login, set up a workshop.  hope some other player who is just as bored and discouraged with the game as i am, does not come by and 1 shot me.  make my vendor runs.  i then just lay in bed while my resources collect, and sit here and read about all the players leaving the game.
---
i feel for ya bud.  i use to submit bug and glitch reports, not any more.  unlike you, i will not work for free.  i know just enough coding to get in trouble, and the mistakes i see here in FO76 make me think they hired a bunch of people fresh out of school.  too many newbies and not enough experience on the dev team. 
---
in addition, there was a post about some lawyer firm about to file some class action lawsuit for californians.  i believe it was over the canvas bag fiasco.  beth has like 25 days left to deliver, or else!!  ha ha!!
---
I'm willing to bet, if you've ever traded, or bought something from a vendor, you've bought or traded a duped item.
---
So, are you willing to take a ban as well?
---
I plan on it the sequel was great and from what I‚Äôve heard the stories intertwine with marsden do they not?
---
Hmmm. i'll have to check it out. I'm building a PC and have the Bioshock trilogy to play for the first time, but I'll add BL to the list. If it's as good as you say.
---
Yeah, shotguns were broken, but it's the little things, you know?
---
I see your point but you forget this subreddit is now reserved for people to complain about the game on. All the people who still enjoy the game are too busy playing it and ignoring the pity party
---
Okay so I think I figured this out. I noticed in my SPECIAL stats I had - charisma being applied. This put me at 8 charisma points. I drink a beer (as I always do) and this put me back at 9 charisma. Doing this allowed me to share the card again. After the beer wore off, my card was unshared.
---
But TBH I'm not sure why I have -1 charisma being applied. I search through all my effects and nothing reduces charisma. So something really weird is happening here..
---
So 2/500? That is not frequent at all. I have a quad laser pistol and it breaks in one mag, which is 111, so I may not even get it to proceed at all.
---
What is your luck at?
---
Did you only have that or sentinel pieces also?
---
No. I'm orders of magnitude more intelligent than you, you pathetic slug.
---
I've played the game since day one of the Xbox BETA.  Everything works for me.  Guess what, they have a priority list and if the bug isn't high enough to fix, it's not going to be fixed.  The game was in a fit state to be released at release time as it WORKED and worked great.  PC was the one having major issues, NOT console players.  Hell it wasn't until PC/PS4 that any major issues were noticed.
---
This game is average to EVERY online mutiplayer I've played and I've been a gamer since '85.  I've been, done and played most games out there and this is quite good.  Oh, and guess what, you can kill ALL the super mutants in the game, because I've done it.  Iv'e traveled the length and width of the map and the ONLY thing I can't kill at this moment in time are the Sorchbeasts (though I have killed three before modded energy riffles went weird) and that's because I don't have enough stimpacks at any one time and my guass riffle is unmodded.
---
Quit whining and either play the game or go away.  Being a crybaby doesn't solve a damn thing and just makes you annoying.
---
Missed fisting Diablo to death on hell with a Zealadin while being butt naked in D2, only moment like that in D3 so far was the night they released the monster power 10 update. Buddy and his barb went in with a 2000LPH monk(me) and a 3000LPS barb, both having \~200dmg, took us 2hrs 53mins to kill em, but we were some of the first in the world to accomplish as much. Sadly those feelings of triumph are few are fare between in the diablo world these days.  
---
With the recent changes to 76 it no longer feels like you've overcame the odds, now it's just feels like up against bullet sponges for giggles because introducing more challenging AI would be too demanding (AKA - Greater Rifts)
---
Me too man it fucking sucks I drank the Koop aid I‚Äôm a Bethesda if elder scrolls 6 sucks I might actually off myself 
---
Dude. Multi-tasking is a thing. Seriously
---
Exactly my dilemma. Not everyone can do a daily grind, but Bethesda doesn't seem to be catering to us casuals. Fallout 76 has a beautiful map, but it seems I can't explore it because I feel like I need to constantly farm items for caps of vendors  to have even a minute chance of success. 
---
&gt;is it even legal then?
---
Unfortunately, in their terms and agreements they say that you don't own Fallout 76 (or any other game) you own a license that can be revoked at any time for no reason. They can do as they wish and get away with it. I wish it was like the older days where you had a disc and can install it and use it at your leisure, and have access to it no matter what.
---
Wow I created an alt character and scrapped endless 10mm pistols and hunting rifles..I'm scared now
---
And here it's getting even better :)
---
How did you not blow up too?
---
Something Valve used to do. 
---
Thank you.
---
...
---
Look, I'm slow, did springs actually get nerfed?
---
What about me having a 40% stored budget with absolutely nothing in the stored tab? That is a huge part of the game that i can hardly access and its been like this for weeks. Some communication in regards to this issue woukd be nice.  At least let me know youre working on it
---
Never made boards, never crafting a lot of anything besides ammo, for obvious reasons.   
---
I hadn't even played the game for OVER A WEEK when I got my email. I had been streaming Minecraft for a week or so.   
---
 and people have PM'd me who duped to laugh at me and tell me how they've duped hundreds of times and haven't been banned yet. Told me to get rekt.  
---
Inb4 someone turns my statement around on me. I‚Äôm not playing the game till they fix this update, but it‚Äôs mostly because I‚Äôm playing kingdom hearts 3 and dying of a flesh eating disease IRL so I‚Äôve got that going for me
---
yes it does  
---
\&gt; If you believe that this account has been flagged in error, please let us know by providing a short description what you were doing that may have resulted in the excessively high rate of item creation.   
---
After sharing my story in fo76 discords, ive been told that the duping method that was supposedly patched required crafting hundreds of the same weapon in a short amount of time in order to overload the server and force crash the game, so now if you craft things too quickly it flags your account
---
They couldn't even display high character levels on the map properly. I don't think they ever expected people to level up as quickly as they did. 
---
VATS criticals and rifle. Terrifyingly efficient.
---
Wait, is no mans sky actually good now? It looked like so much fun, but I didn't get it because of the terrible launch and haven't heard anything since :(
---
Coop as well right? 
---
You level 37? 
---
You may be one of the few people on reddit that knows Fahrenheit and Celsius match up at -40. 
---
But I have to ask, what great white north are you a part of that has 40 Fahrenheit temperatures right now?
---
5/5 killed since patch.
---
Yeah,I forgot about that.
---
The only way this could be funnier is if you hired a lawyer.
---
Meh, hate to admit it, but EA is better at making games.  But there's defiantly a game of 'hold my beer' going on between a lot of game companies right now.
---
But I hear ppl say this game is great.
---
I mean, it must be cut content.  It's a shame.
---
Bye then.
---
The issue isn't a financial one, but rather one of public relations. If the public likes your brand, then merchandise and new products do amazingly. 
---
But if the public is disappointed, or outright angry with your product? They won't buy things anymore. I know after this debacle, I won't be buying the next fallout game for a good while after it's out if at all. Same goes for their other IPs, like elder scrolls. There are real financial consequences to the entirety of how they handled 76, and they're likely to feel those in coming years. 
---
Just because you play alone doesn‚Äôt mean everyone needs to. I have been waiting to play FO with friends since new Vegas and am happy I got a chance finally, even if it‚Äôs a mess lulz. I‚Äôm sure FO5 will come out someday, and I for sure won‚Äôt play that unless it has multiplayer :) maybe they should have made us all wait ten years and released both at once, and they still would be on the same engine and a mess haha :) 
---
Your not disconnected, your in the void between the objects you see and can interact with, it won't allow duping, it's like if you somehow got inside a secrete passage between walls.
---
They are motherfucking camps, not settlements. We may get the ability to build more permanent settlements in the future.
---
You're playing the game wrong and then blaming the developers for shooting yourself in the foot.
---
Anyone who disagrees clearly paid real money for their guns? 
---
Lol. 
---
I never really had trouble farming supplies for stimpacks or healing Salves and selling those to players without going anywhere near the 1500 weight limit so...
---
TBH I stopped playing because the duping made PvP feel bad and ruined a lot of chances for other weapons and therefore weaponsmiths to make any profit there. Healing items kept me in the caps, though.
---
Same deal with your decon shower.
---
so if you spend $60 on a product, and you come to find it is defective, you remain silent?
---
BL2 is in my opinion the absolute best loot-shooter-rpg ever made.
---
Broken things is the only fun to be had in fallout76. Its just a bad game.
---
Sad part is I already had quit the game over over a week when I got my email. My last login was about two weeks ago or more and I got the email 4 days ago. I already quit. And if you take notice, I didn't get pissed about the ban for reals, until I realized all my offline content is now banned from me as well. Like Fallout 1 and 2 and other games on the bethesda launcher.
---
Not once did I say I was leaving. 
---
They only thing that worries me is the somewhat inconsistent stats. Like, I had marsupial mutation, for some reason, Rad Worms buffed it, then when I got over worms (hehehehe) the mutation had no effect at all, of course all I had to do was relog, but also feels I‚Äôm losing food and water waaaay to quick and my armor breaks faster than I can repair now.
---
I dont give af about TSE, and the current bugs wont make me quit either. More confusing than anything else
---
Im thinking so. It has been a long time since i played and i am looking forward to rekindling with the Red Dead franchise. I am keen to find out 
---
No problems. Now comes the fun part of figuring out a new location for camp. Only took me like a week last time :'-) 
---
Isn't this how it always works? 
---
I wouldn't say that I'm pissed, but at this point I'm severely disappointed in the things that seem like flagrant mistakes. I am enjoying the game, even if I had to fight with a rad arch for 20 minutes figuring out why I couldn't put it anywhere in my camp or how since the update I can't open my Pip-Boy within the first minute of loading in or my controls completely freeze up. I'm not thrilled having to learn around the things that feel broken when the rest of the game feels good. And I'm a split shotguns and explosives build!
---
No, dude. Not directly. Guns break down much faster. Requiring springs to repair them.
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but isn‚Äôt it only for a limited time that it gives bonus hp? 
---
furious has a cap. bloodied gets weapon damage much higher than anything else.
---
Combat Rifle plans are tied to the Motherlode quest
---
We're a hopeful bunch!
---
The game isn't bad. When I think about it, when destiny 2 went free, I ended up getting the first dlc.. it was okay, just really short. And I didn't get to enjoy a lot of content because Forsaken was out- bit the bullet and bought it so I can play with friends.. it also didn't have much content, within a few weeks I was bored.
---
Then I look at the complaints here, for a game I easily got twice as much play time out of, I enjoyed playing with my friends much more.. overall this game was much much better, even with the occasional crash here and there.
---
The scorch queen fight used to be pretty rough, frame drops, etc.. but it's been buttery smooth for over a month, smoother with every patch.
---
I didn't rush exploring, I kind of wandered around with friends till we explored everything, then I made a point to go back to at least 3 places a day I hadn't really given time. 
---
I feel like most of the people complaining truly tried to rush shit, level as fast as they can, probably didn't explore everything as thoroughly as I did.. because I don't see what the problem is for most (besides PC gamers, and I can't tell if they're telling the truth or looking for an excuse to cry).
---
I regret getting the dlc for destiny 2, I don't regret this game in the least. More content on the way, I don't have to pay for it.. sounds like damn good bang for my buck.
---
I'll definitely come back to this game, destiny.. not so much. That game was a truly empty game, a few NPCs just for quests.. shitty story with no depth, and they already abandoned it with half assed dlc while they work on the sequel.
---
its why its on sale for 15$ and cause its not worth my time its a known fact not many are playing even the fan boys will admit that stupid ass.....its doing so bad which is why its 15$ and santa costumes are 20
---
Also my fave, the ending is just too sad, seeing them both lying there holding each other.
---
So .I became the new mistress of mystery..the +1 perception on the dress helped make my mind up too.
---
Black cowboy hat with the green bandana and I'm all set for fighting crime, after I've spent the first hour farming acid and lead, but then those raiders are doomed, if I can find some, somewhere, anywhere, hello...raiders ?
---
You are a god damn moron. 
---
I know a lot of people hate early access but I feel like this may have been the best path for them.
---
I gave you an upvote you deserve it, I'm not sure if you were apart of the team making the unofficial fallout patches for 3, NV and 4 but if you were in any way, shape or form good work and thanks for turning broken games into something that's playable. I wish that Bethesda gave a fuck about the players but the way I've felt that they see it is "well... We already got the money" I honestly feel that NV was the only game that didn't need much work in the patching because Obsidian (interplay) knows their shit.
---
Give Spiderman PS4 another play through, get the sour taste this pos game left out of your mouth. 
---
The more I see the shit in this game the more I hope they see it failing and finally release mod tools for you all and private servers. You modders are the reason I have 900+ hours in Fallout 4.
---
Bethesda do something the right way? Lol!  Seriously though, anytime you make a mistake this bad, you should just rollback the patch, then reevaluate how to move forward.  A lot of us WILL NOT PLAY until this is resolved.  Promising fixes with a undetermined eta will just make ppl move on.  Once we‚Äôve moved on to a game that isn‚Äôt a shit show, why come back?
---
Furious caps at 30% bonus damage. Bloodied stacks with Nerd Rage and low health can be mitigated with blocker and elusive.
---
Since when is 200 hours of twitch footage showing him doing, exactly what he described in his post, 'weakest excuses' ... try watching his footage [here](https://www.twitch.tv/matthew486dx) before passing judgment.
---
For melee, the damage boost for bloodied is stacked with the damage increased from the up to +15 strength that can be gained from low health while wearing unyielding armor pieces.
---
Its because they come and warrior up. Talk some smack, complain, complain, "Quit playing the game"  then log into the game and the Atom shop and spend money. Then repeat the cycle daily. 
---
So it‚Äôs willful ignorance if a player finds some item BGS put in the game?
---
Right. 
---
Cuz it says in the Terms of Use you need to compare all items found to a list to verify they aren‚Äôt leaked. Right?
---
MMMMMM SEEEE YA!
---
There are many good posts that get buried by the same things being repeated ad nauseum. It's not good for the community. And beleve it or not, I think there might be a few people out there that don't want the community to do well.
---
I'm on PC and I'm seeing the above plus fluctuating max carry weight (ranging from 520-540 without taking/changing anything to buff that ability) and disease message spamming with different wording.
---
Honestly, I understand your love for Bethesda in the past, but after all the shit involving 76 and now losing your entire account.. I seriously hope that you and many others still trying to hold onto what Bethesda once was, will finally realize thats those days are over, for good. 
---
So the in-game Mistress of Mystery outfit is excluded?
---
Beth doesn't want us to enjoy the game anymore 
---
First pre order in 15+ years of gaming... I loved every single fallout and elder scrolls that came out prior, what could possibly go wrong? ...
---
[200 hours of game play footage](https://www.twitch.tv/matthew486dx) on twitch, proving he's not...  so yeah.. so much for your opinion. 
---
It's technically the highest damage you can reach. Min-maxing builds are latching on to bloodied now that TSE can't one shot everything for them
---
Crafting ammo is the way to go. And knowing what to farm to get materials and ammo. Scorched in Morgantown airport/high school for 45, 308, and shotgun shells. Super mutants drop a good variety and gunpowder. Mole miners drop shotgun shells. All of them drop weapons to scrap.
---
Until lastnight I was still in my Raider PA,'loving the look...   
---
Mine too I‚Äôve reset it a couple times but nothing works
---
I think it's poor game design to have high level enemies spawn simply because a high level player is around. 
---
By contrast, I don't like the idea of a low- level player causing low- level enemies to spawn in areas that are meant to be high- level.
---
IMO, there's certain areas of the map that are clearly early game areas, and others that are clearly meant as late game areas. 
---
In short, there should be no super-  high level enemies in Grafton. Not ever. By contrast, there should never be any low-level enemies in Watoga and the cranberry bog, no matter what the level of players spawn there.
---
Life sucks, here is a straw.  Cheat in Diablo 3 and your wow account gets banned too.
---
Sucks to be you(them).  Dont cheat in online games or you will be banned.  Time to pirate the games.
---
I believe the Gauss Rifle counts as energy DMG, despite technically firing a solid metal projectile.
---
You should probably make a build and stick with it rather than respecing into what's op. Op is likely to get nerfed and copying the band wagons build is kinda boring anyway.
---
full Respec optional every 20 levels
---
24
---
Nope, according to Tymanx30 it's included.
---
Imagine fixing a game and then breaking it at the same time. You guys working on this game are idiots and incompetent. Give up on this game. Please. Shut Bethesda branch down, Zenimax.
---
No. It seems that optimized bracers take 7 less AP when power attacking. Power attacks take 35 AP, with it power attacks take 27 AP, so they seem to have fixed it.
---
No, *you‚Äôre* missing the point. All he bought was a **license** to use the software. He doesn‚Äôt magically own the rights to the software now that he paid for the disc it came on. It‚Äôs still wholly owned by the creators.
---
See this is the kind of shit I am talking about. Their detection system is flawed.  
---
My character was over the weight limit and over the new weight limit of 1500 pounds, I think I probably had over 10,000 pounds of stuff on the character between all the legendaries, especially heavy weapon ones add up quick. And no weight reduction perks on the toon.   
---
I've had as much as 3000 pounds of stuff on me pre-perks on my heavy gunner character, with every single weight reduction perk. So it's not hard to have a lot on you.
---
that is the only item creation that i have done in at least a week. It does have the appeals process but i have friends whos accounts have been similarly suspended waiting for WEEKS with no response... not a guilty or innocent verdict, just nothing
---
If they are worthless paper weights can I have yours?
---
It's not a complaint simply an observation and a suggestion. It seems like a lot of sour grape mentality.
---
I enjoy seeing people post constructive criticism but knock it off with the "I quit garbage" it spams up the feed for real concerns making this sub seem childish. 
---
Thanks for the Upvote.  
---
I've helped with other issues, and added content and NPC's to Fallout 4 (been on a modding break for 3 months due to an injury), but I work with and almost daily spend time with the people who have been responsible for some of those fixes, and they have contributed to the long long list of things we've been trying to get addressed.
---
You can call bullshit all you like, but that's literally exactly what happened. I hadn't even logged into the game in over a week when I got the email saying I was suspended.
---
A level 5 short hunting rifle is more powerful than my TSE
---
Godd Howard?  Oh Lord!!  :-(........
---
Oh no not forever :( What will Fallout 76 ever do without you playing :'( /s
---
If ran across a few plans at harpers ferry
---
Hey listen if you keep preordering regurgitated shit, they're going to keep making it.
---
PC
---
Nah dude. It‚Äôs like you stealing from a Walmart and getting banned from all Walmarts, even though you only stole from one. 
---
What‚Äôs so great about tse
---
Nothing anymore 
---
Oh, I'll grant you that the change as announced and the nerfs in this patch are ham-fisted and could be/could have been done better, but it annoys me to see people surprised about this when *everything* they are delivering is an attempt to implement requests that were highly upvoted on this sub not long ago. 
---
(As an aside, if the regressions are as serious as the posts here claim then that's definitely really bad; no excuses for that when you're already under the microscope)
---
I don't want any tumors either.. But seriously one good good patch then a big dlc would be amazing. 
---
Seems like a weak move when I had to run throughout the town to survive. I just had stimpacks
---
Same here... now I'm just kinda giving it the side-eye waiting for it to slither out of some nether-realm cave.
---
Item creation doesnt mean literally crafting. Thats what im saying.
---
They already fixed bobblehead stacking.
---
I think 6 or 7. I run pretty heavy on luck for Starched Genes, Luck of the Draw and good with salt. I'm a sniper build but not min/maxed. I usually get a proc every 50-60 shots through my lever action. 
---
It's not bugged, just a little tricky, but not sure is post is sarcasm.
---
You would just love that wouldn‚Äôt you. Lol.
---
Known issue, hotfix incoming end of week/start of next
---
My honest guess is by halfway through March
---
Nah dude. It‚Äôs like stealing from a Walmart and getting banned from all Walmarts, even though you only stole from one. 
---
These are the posts this sub needs. Yeah we get it everyone hates the patch but they could be doing things to right their wrongs. 
---
Well, if this last shout into the void goes unanswered I'm back to finishing several long overdue updates and some new Content..   
---
I can't put off the update to RaiderOverhaul forever.
---
I'm on it, chief. Witcher 3 tonight.
---
Oh no you get me wrong. I played in plenty of squads but they were either never on when I friended them or no one wanted to group up.
---
Yes known bug that radworms boosts stats by 50% lol i think its great and should keep it.
---
Yikes! But you‚Äôre right about that.
---
diablo 3 and wow are online games so kinda bad comparison but i understand your point.
---
Oh, that sounds much better than the minigun, haha.
---
I call this completing the game. 
---
Fallout 4 didn‚Äôt have any ‚Äúend game.‚Äù This was built to be multiplayer fallout 4.
---
Hell yeah, get it!
---
Hm, I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs pay to win about it. Seems more like a way to try bait people to spend money on it. 
---
If it was a permanent bonus I can see that being an issue 
---
Ok is nerfing what I think it means? They are weakening alot of things? 
---
Dude stacked duped melee bobbleheads to see if he could exploit the game then apologized for saying he could when he couldn‚Äôt and got silver.  You MFs are crazy.
---
Agreed, Bethesda seriously has a customer service/relations problem. 
---
When it's not auto scrapping bulk, it will show you as not having enough of the material. Yesterday it said I had like 3 copper; I had 6 more bulked. When it shows you have enough of the required materials but won't let you craft/repair, it's usually the split inventory thing.
---
I'd give you that, but it would have to be the mother of all patches..
---
Extremely typical blaming the ‚Äúcontractor‚Äù but not the company. 
---
Their day will come too 
---
I agree completely, for single player games.
---
FO76 is not a singleplayer game.
---
That seems totally reasonable. 
---
Why do you feel the need to defend yourself? 
---
It doesn't seem like this was directed to folks like you
---
Even if you did dupe, which I don't believe you did, what if you were roleplaying as someone who created a machine that can use quantum physics to duplicate items? At E3 they said you can be whoever you want. So is it technically false advertising? I'm definitely no supporter of duping, but when them banning dupers also causes innocent people to get banned, I would rather dupers than people losing access to stuff they paid money for.
---
Look, I love Warframe, I have a (badly aging) grey founder t-shirt that I wear on special occasions, but it scratches a very different itch to Anthem, with a very different tone and theme, and Anthem's style is better tailored to a gamepad than Warframe.  (I swear to God, hours of trying to replicate my PC mobility/techniques on console nearly broke both my hands.)
---
If you play fo76 like you play fo4, they're awesome. But uh.     Welp
---
OMG since the latest patch these subs have been soooooo entertaining ..making my days at work go quicker
---
lol, i am the opposite.  i must wait till summer for my next game.  so i am stuck here till then.
---
i actually went and reinstalled master of orion 2.  now there is a game that just NEVER gets old!!
---
The game was rolled back to a prior state. Not only are Bobby pins back to the original weight most of the exploits and glitches have returned as well 
---
I just got the axe, and just saw the costume. I think my mind is made up lol.
---
Good on you for owning it, we all make mistakes and it's easy to duck and run.  
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Almost took the bait. Hey man, nice shot. 
---
just shown .
---
Lolllll
---
Yeah, I was holding out hope but between this most recent patch and the fact that the closest "New content" is still 2 months away and is just the normal game with different rules, I'm giving up on this game. 
---
I'll be back when the Vaults open but since that's probably 3-4+ months away and it will probably only be 10-15 hours of content MAXIMUM, I think the game is dead to me. I liked the idea and even the base game, despite the bugs, but this is the worst post-launch support I've seen for any game, ever. At least other games with bad starts (like Destiny) had steady amounts of events and DLC. This just has patches that make the game worse every time. 
---
Eh, I'm not done just going to sit back and wait for the hotfix and see where it goes from there. Gives me a chance to play other games
---
Nope, I write a dramatic letter to the company telling them why I will never buy their product again.
---
I gotcha, make sure you take a pic or remember the error code if it happens 
---
It's already counted in the damage shown.
---
It is, but its also the in thing to do late 2018 and early 2019. 
---
XD
---
Indeed...I'm not sure why so many people feel the need to personally tell everybody here that they are going to stop playing a video game. Maybe the first few posts after the patch were reasonable, but at this point any constructive argument has been repeated at least thrice over. There isn't anything anybody gains from it other than attention. I'd like something USEFUL to be on the front page, like, idk, the message from bethesda that they're working on a hotfix? I'd rather not see ten different "I'm leaving, and don't even try to stop me!" posts. I swear some of these people must think they live in an anime or something
---
Its acceptable for players to fly, its acceptable for patches to break the game. It's acceptable for the game studio to nerf changes, it's acceptable to have server sign in issues. You my friend are a sheep if you think any of this is okay. Read reddit look at the backlash of the community it's not just me its everyone. Dont attack me because devs dont do the job properly. Would you buy a phone that doesn't work all the time but just drops calls randomly. Do you buy food that gets you sick and say oh well. Do you buy a chair that breaks. Do you buy a computer that works only 90 percent of the time. I'm a consumer and as a consumer I expect certain criteria such as a game that was promised to me as a AAA game.
---
What makes a game Triple A?
---
In the video¬†game¬†industry, AAA (pronounced "triple A") or¬†Triple-A¬†is¬†a¬†classification term used for¬†games¬†with the highest development budgets and levels of promotion.¬†A¬†title considered to be AAA is therefore expected to be¬†a¬†high quality¬†game¬†or to be among the year's bestsellers.
---
Guess what loser this game isn't on the top seller list and hasn't been since December and they were in last place and now they aren't on the list at all. Every game news out rated this game 5 out of 10 and lower. Your just a d rider, sheep.
---
‚ÄúThis does not mean Bethesda Austin deserves hate, it just highlights Bethesda‚Äôs poor choices and management when helping develop this game.‚Äù 
---
Yeah, I said that in the post...
---
Wasteland occupation: cat bowl hunter
---
I wasn't complaining about speed either. Again my complaint is with the RESPONSE. If they dont have anything new to add, then don't say anything. Radio silence sucks, but gibberish sucks just as bad. My complaint is with the same cookie-cutter response, and THAT is directly on the managers. Sure my comment might not help the player base, but neither do they.
---
And yes that is exactly what I am implying. There are "regular" users that are more active in the community than the "community managers." And when they do pop up, it's to say " I have communicated that to the devs team." 
---
Which leads me to my ultimate question? What is the point of their position? 
---
God I hope they don't get paid real world money for this.
---
Obviously, it's not the entire studio doing stuff wrong, we shouldn't really be putting all the blame on the developers. The people who test the patches and say they're *balanced* and ready for full release are the ones making them go along and then we're attacking the devs for it! 
---
Maybe they have eyes
---
Every one else who has posted this today. Sort by new. You are not alone. 
---
I feel the same way my man. I could understand them nerfing it on the PvP servers but I feel like they should have just let it be for people who are only doing PvE. It doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre bad or have no skill. It just means that we want to be able to quickly run around the map and loot without having to unload 3 magazines on one enemy and wasting you‚Äôre time. Once you complete the game and make it to level 100+ their isn‚Äôt really much left to do other than loot so why not let us have some fun while doing it. I tried playing yesterday after the update but found it way more boring than it was before the update. Gave it another try today thinking maybe it was just me but nope, still just as boring. Luckily theirs like 4 or 5 good games coming out over the next few months.
---
i was thinking about that, if i ever wanted a mule, you could just get all the weight reduction perks, and 5 armor pieces with \[decrease weight of weapons and ammo by %\] or \[decrease weight of food and drink by %\] and the 1500 weight limit would fit thousands of more items. but when you log in or log out, if you are on the map screen or pip boy, you can see that it temporarily doesnt calculate those reductions, so could that trigger a flag, and could they ban you for that? there is no way for us to know and we just have to guess what the rules are.
---
too little, too late
---
True. 
---
But add a passive mod and now you have a massive cooperation.
---
Why does it have to push us to PvP
---
Bro imagine working hours for a gun that does less damage then ur fists
---
I think I‚Äôm smart, and that you‚Äôre fucking stupid.
---
&gt; I have my own market on 76, with different and various traders offering hundreds of pounds of plans and more and it's all useless now
---
and quote  "but when you even throw 100 hours into this game (i'm at nearly 2000)"
---
Just askin bro. If you don't want to play anymore, maybe you could help someone out instead of being so salty. 
---
"Kill the game NOW!" 
---
Especially when any thing truly relevant such as this post just gets down voted
---
me possibly buying 1-2 legendaries from a vendor that people dumped is unlikely to have done anything duped or not, someone owning hundreds or thousands of pounds of stuff that was obviously duped directly contributes to server instability and hurts the game economy. 
---
its like someone having found kilos of cocaine and you saying i've probably used a dollar that someone snorted coke with once. its not the same and u know it
---
There isn't much pvp in my experience on ps4.
---
The griefers seemed to have gotten bored and left, especially the low hanging fruit that don't even run pvparmor.
---
I've never seen that patch fixed on PS4. I usually wind up having 475 carry weight until I exit and re-enter the PA and it goes down to 375. Only happens when I load in wearing the armor.
---
more like he had 800 TSEs.
---
I'm aware and I have not done any other item creation.
---
[Terrifying isn‚Äôt it](https://youtu.be/tmqXUimL_O8)

This explains the concept of deterrence and why they banned you from all of their games. 
---
Good on you and the guys you work with. There's a mod I've wanted to make for fallout 3 or 4 that uses the battle engine of fallout 3 or 4 but it contains the full story and experience from fallout 1, 2, and tactics the original games just with 3d modeling and a better combat system. Because I'm more a fan of the "ohh shit, ohh shit, ohh shit" type of combat compared to the spam attack, wait your turn, make a sandwich, drop a deuce, have a shower, change the oil in the car, and balance the check book to return to a game that is still taking its turn. I love all things fallout (might be omitting 76 in this though) from the lore to the little stupid Easter eggs found throught. I've always wondered what could have been if interplay never sold to Bethesda. 
---
Any hoozles good work on trying to stay on the devs asses to give us a semi enjoyable game.
---
Todd Howard personally came to my house and killed my puppy. But this patch is unforgivable, I will be throwing my PC out the window tonight because uninstalling just isn‚Äôt enough.
---
Bethesda Bad
---
And it drives me crazy to hear people say "well its an online game so...nope PvP is a must"
---
Wow has a PvE server, ESO has a PvP area....ot can be done. 
---
This was just a quick release with little thought to us PvE players
---
I already know this. I scrapped my bulk gears just so it would show but nothing happens upon repairing. 
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. This has been working this way as intended for some time now. 
---
I mean... I'm still playing it as we speak but this stability is definitely not great.
---
Yes I know that bobby pins weighing slightly more makes me *super nervous* to play the game. If you don't think people are being ridiculously over dramatic today you're in denial. Calling for people to be fired and writing entire essays. It's pretty silly. 
---
I agree.  I could live with the reduced XP but since I can't even find it...really annoying.
---
Yeah, I bought on launch after enjoying the beta but it seems like it has steadily gotten worse with the balance changes. This is where I must give up on the game, I feel like I gave Bethesda a more than fair opportunity but that's long gone.
---
oh, sometimes you have to have it on your actual person too /shrug
---
That's it I quit I can't stand this f****** game anymore
---
Some people need to vent still this was supposed to be a big step forward for the franchise and instead it was a mess.
---
Plus where is the BoS combat armor plans? They used to be at Grafton and now they aren‚Äôt. Didn‚Äôt see them at vendorbot Phoenix. Harper‚Äôs, Watoga Station, Camden, Responder stations and Raider stations, even WhiteSprings bunker all no. Soooo...BoS where?
---
Uhm, what? That‚Äôs not the way steam works, at all. I‚Äôm 90% sure blizzard doesn‚Äôt do that either, but I‚Äôm not sure on origin. Do you have any sources for your claim, or are you just making shit up?
---
I struggle to achieve 60fps on maximum graphics, 1080p. I am running an 8600k w/ 1080ti cooled by a custom loop. Needless to say this machine absolutely tanks modern games, but fallout 76 plays like a fukn t-rex tryna ride a bicycle 
---
The fact that he came up with both excuses, please don't tell me you fell for this shit? Whenever bans happen in any online game, these same sob stories emerge. 
---
Not quitting myself but I'm going to check out a few things on game pass and possibly look into a new game if I have any cash left over from my God forsaken income tax return when it finally gets here. Downloading sinner atm and as sad as it is to say I've even put off the update so I can install that. That's saying alot for me. The only reason I got so into conversating on reddit was this game and this sub. I'm still going to stay subscribed and definetly give advice on the game as well as update the game but for now I feel like I should try and relearn how to play mhw or something instead of doing my 50th nuke run and queen fight. 
---
Yes and no, I am a shotgun build and my AAE shotgun still one or two shots most people due to build and anti-armor. It all just depends on you‚Äôd gear and perks.
---
Melee does more damage BUT you have to get close. 
---
1. You can bullshit about immersion all you want, but they aren't ever going to be homesteads. They are camps.
---
2. No. It takes a bigger person to admit THEIR faults. Pinheaded morons blame other people for their problems every goddamn day.
---
Are you 100% sure it can't be a hardware issue?  Sometimes I just need to restart my computer.
---
I just realized that you listed consoles... so I guess you're playing console for 76? 
---
That would change things a bit. I've been a PC player for like 15 years and I think jankiness is much more common on that platform. So while I'm getting pretty stable performance on 76, I'm also pretty desensitized to bugs and stuff in general. xD 
---
Jesus christ take a chill pill. Don't tell me how to live my life lol  
---
I did want the viewers wanted. They wanted me to send nukes. So thats what I did. Jesus.   
---
At any rate, I do, do other stuff. Sometimes I stream myself working on my car, not that it brings in a lot of viewers, but it's something I've got to do anyway and it gives my followers an insight into my other hobbies and interests. I also play a variety of other games.   
---
I know math is hard for a lot of people, but 200 hours is only five, 40 hour weeks, and I'm a full time streamer and I've been streaming 76 since the BETA, which was 12 weeks ago, so that left plenty of time for other things as well.
---
You said it, man.
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve killed a legendary enemy that dropped a 3* weapon/armor and right when I go to pick it up it disconnects me. Most frustrating thing ever.
---
ThAt‚Äôs hOW MaFiA wOrKs
---
It doesnt matter, all accounts and all blizzard titles are banned when you are banned in any one of them.
---
The 20% of E and the 25% of TS are multiplicative, not additive. So you factor in one, then the other. You don't add 20% and 25% to get 45% and go from there.
---
Mules are cheating now?
---
We are sharing this with the devs and a hotfix will be available to address this late this week or early next week. It will add boiled water to the pool.
---
Awesome, thank you very much!
---
You could try adding some team mates and spawn at them as a workaround.
---
Oh ok, thanks!
---
No, just my prediction. It would be easier for the devs as they don't have to modify every single weapon in game
---
Oh, I see.  I started as a Flamer and Gatling Plasma Heavy Weapons build, so I feel the repair pains.  That entire durability system needs an overhaul; we shouldn't be spending 8 perk points just to be able to play the game for longer than 10 minutes.
---
this sh*t again!? that was fixed, what? 3 patches ago? SMH.
---
You‚Äôre too quick with the grabby-grabs, hahah. The fans are supposed to have a very lazy spin to them. Now they just look all jagged...
---
Jesus Christ, how long did this take you to write up.

I travelled to Harper's Ferry and came up against some super mutant variations, scorched and other stuff. When I was using my vampire's combat shotgun, I didn't do any damages to some of the super mutants, but if I switched to my handmade rifle, I did damage as normal. Most super mutants took damage as per normal. Later on in the same session, I was at the amusement park, and came across a liberator. I used my power fist on it, in vats, it made the sound that I'd hit it (and vats was 95%) but no damage was inflicted. This has only happened since the last patch that I am aware of.
---
Nice edit for an attempted recovery there chief lol. üëçüèº
---
So, I found this: [https://i.imgur.com/87w4TNn.png](https://i.imgur.com/87w4TNn.png)
---
The pic shows a sign for route 65, my guess is if you start at Watoga and work your way north, you'll find it.
---
&gt; The game lost me a while ago, and I think a good portion of that is that the game fundamentally does not, and realistically can not, support mods so that you're able to replay the game in a new way, and instead it's just a grind for the sake of grinding.
---
The game *could* support mods that we want, provided Bethesda made private servers with mods available. 
---
They have said they will release the ability to mod the game, but I feel like given Bethesda's track record here, it's what they call "modding" will just be store-bought player-made armor and costumes for 1200 atom each. 
---
I'm not trying to be a dick, but I don't understand the "190%" part of this. Can you elaborate?
---
Nuclear bomb on a catapult!1!!!1  That sounds like way to much fun.  I am sure it will be removed from the game soon.
---
3 days and now im getting downvoted without even a proper discussion im just sad...
---
Even if there was like just some trash 1 star legendary, and a chance like 1% to drop a 3 star legendary. That would be something.
---
I can change it back to weasels if you want
---
Agree that carry weight isn't working right. At first login after latest patch, power armor bumped my carry weight to 500+. It had been around 350.
---
After about an hour playing, carry weight bonuses disappeared altogether. Carry weight without armor = carry weight with armor. Have tried exiting power armor, quitting game, and rejoining, with same results. Armor doesn't add any carry bonus. Chems and food continue to add carry weight as normal.
---
Given the recent track record of bethesda i would rather give the player the benefit of the doubt. And in most of these situations somebody at the company will usually reach out to at least reach the bottom of it. Bethesda has yet to do even that.
---
Happened to me I had to leave the server and rejoin 
---
Yeah I spend a ton of time on there making things perfect. I don't mind respeccing. I mind the process of grinding levels to do it.
---
This is completely false. Steam never locks you out of your account unless your account is a stolen one, with all the different games on the platform it would be insane to do so. Even within valve games you can get banned for hacking in one and still play on others.
---
I‚Äôm almost certain that blizzard works the same way, I‚Äôve seen streamers get banned on Overwatch but still play other blizzard games.
---
lol both you and him posted a month ago, and then nothing but silence until 4 hours ago.  
---
But do tell, how many TSEs did you hand him to keep a hold of lol?
---
I tried that and it actually worked. Guess your camp is the only place you can repair things now.
---
Can monitor the number of guns you craft but can't check to see if you have 80 guns of the same name... I see a problem here and its worrysome. Hopefully you get unbanned. That's kinda pushing it. 
---
Fair enough, now that you put it that way. I was just pointing out that maybe the language in your original post would rub some people off the wrong way, especially given the status quo of the community. 
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, I agree and feel pretty much the same way. The top post this week highlighting the entire situation is already enough and I feel speaks on behalf of the whole community so further ‚Äúok Bethesda, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm gone‚Äù posts look redundant and seem like karma grabs; it doesn‚Äôt help that every other post is like that, as you‚Äôve pointed out. 
---
They have AI customer service with automated response, right? Shouldn't be a problem.
---
I've been buying games since the 1980s and I've only pre-ordered twice.
---
I per-ordered this one for 3 reasons: Fallout IV was a ton of fun for me, I could play the game early (BETA access) and I got it for $47 instead of $59.
---
But, I agree with you - I fucking hate how so many people pre-order games, many of which are shit.  Particularly if it's at the "regular retail" price of $59!!!
---
They've acknowledged that rad worms was broken further by fixing it, causing these problems, and they are looking into it. It boosts mutations by 50 percent while you have the disease, and then removes them after the disease is cured. Chances are you contracted rad worms. Logging out apparently is the only way to fix it right now.
---
It's over. Honestly guys, this was it, they blew it. 
---
A black powder rifle is a much stronger weapon than a small nuclear bomb in real life. It's just physics. Imagine a lead ball placed inside a steel barrel with gunpowder to project the ball forward. Then imagine the power of the atom being split. An atom is tiny. It's obvious, really.
---
Shit. I need to go collect more springs.
---
I see you making leaps of imagination.
---
There was no exploit of carry weight. He had a mule character, that was slower than a sloth because it was overburdened.  And he only logged into it when a trade needed to be made. 
---
"It causes harm to other players"  Bullshit, if Bethesda would use a modern database engine instead of the crap they spawned from the creation engine, we wouldn't be having item storage issues or server performance lags.  Blame the devs, not the players trying to find ways around their crap.
---
Bethesda wanted players to work as a community, that's why there are no NPC's in the game, why we have crappy vendors that share cap pools. They wanted to make us work as teams, and trade, and work as a community.  That was their intention.  They should have thought harder.. because even in the wild west... every decent sized town and one thing besides a church and a general store... and that's a bank.
---
Haven't done YouTube in over a year, but yeah it woulda been a good one.
---
I can't even imagine. I don't even run PA and it is already crazy powerful.
---
They may take our lives, but they'll never take our explosives
---
IANAL, but he may not want the law involved when he's exploiting an online service.
---
I‚Äôve never understood the hype... at all. Fallout has always felt like an RPG that was never finished.
---
Thanks for the advice! 
---
Your comment hurts the player base. Its not that it doesn't help it does the opposite. I dont want to help people who have no clue what I do but still try to tell me I'm not doing my job right. 
---
You're building a wall between bethesda and the fo76 subreddit. Fo76 needs to/should stay neutral. Yeah shit is fucked. But we paid for this shit so all we can do is give our best input to the team members that are willing to reach out to the community. 
---
I've never seen this many dev comments on a thread (yeah there shouldn't be a need for this many) but at least they're trying. Theres so many people who are up in arms because they have been silent about a road map. Yet here you are saying they should be silent. 
---
The last thing we need is for bethesda to be weary about taking suggestions from this subreddit because this and the forums are where some of the most dedicated people voice their opinion and which bugs need to be addressed. 
---
Try and give a useful suggestion next time instead of critiquing their process. 
---
Like you dont even know what they do yet you think their job is useless. How could you think something is useless yet not know how it works?
---
I‚Äôll be joining you, Geralt has never let me down.
---
Whoosh
---
Are you new here? Literally every other post is people saying bethesta didn‚Äôt reply to them in weeks. 
---
And did you even read the post? He didn‚Äôt cheat.
---
Some people..
---
A VAC ban doesn‚Äôt ban you from all of valves other games, not sure where you‚Äôre getting that from.
---
getting banned from a blizzard game absolutely does not ban your entire bnet account. full bnet account bans are rare and usually under suspicion of account selling/sharing.
---
Me too man. Same boat. This game is worse now than when it started. 
---
We did 2 on pc last night also round 10 min, first with round 5 guys second had more than 10
---
Can confirm both the return of the Bobby pin weight to .1 also that bulk junk does not work for crafting/ repairing. That one seems to be new and likely a result of the fix they put on scrapping mods for crafting, now nothing "scraps" during crafting.
---
Not sure what triggers the bug. its not always like that, at least for me.
---
 **Edit 02**  
---
Downvotes already?   
---
There are either people or bots that go around downvoting every single thread that is made. I have only been using reddit for a short time so I don't know if thats normal for a sub or what
---
Bro dont pretend pgi is some epic dev... mwo is such a shitshow joke.
---
yeah that footage doesn't really prove anything.
---
I've put it down too in hopes they can turn it around like no man's sky. We'll see if they can pull it out or not
---
TSE did not Discourage Cooperation...how do i known? Because this is what we do. I help and play Hardcore pve. 
---
I think they should have set up PvE servers. WOW has PvE, ESO has PvE areas. It could have been done.
---
I love OP builds, and i alwayd will. I dont think i should grind for hours to waste my ammo and junk repairing my stuff in a 30 minute battle
---
I can confirm this bug was active in XB1 today, as well. 
---
Either way you add it the math comes out the same. Same with the perk cards. Example below:
---
157 base dam + 25% = 39.25
---
157 base dam + 20% = 31.41
---
31.7+39.4= 71.1+157=228 without perk cards. 
---
Math is same for the 3 maxed shotgun cards as well as the maxed demolition card. It's not hard you can do it on your phone. 
---
The end result is that they are not calculating properly. 
---
Think what you want, you've already shown us your lack of intelligence.
---
I‚Äôve bought them before this patch from Harpers Ferry.
---
I understand what you mean but I disagree with that being an excuse. If you are in a leadership position within a company you have a lot of different jobs and one of them is clear and precise expectations and communications within and outside of the company essentially what I said with keeping the peace. You can delegate all you want and think the job is going to get done but it obviously isnt getting done correctly. In my opinion I think it is very unfair of them to take charge and be the faces of the company when announcing new things and talking about the good things that are happening when there is clearly an overwhelming negative opinion even within their own community here on reddit and when things go bad they take a step back and let their employees take the blame and front all the grievances the customers have. Its a very typical sign of terrible management and terrible management is one of the biggest reasons companies go under.
---
I don't think it was ever really fixed. It still happened after it was "fixed"
---
But why couldn‚Äôt they have just made a co op mode with real NPC‚Äôs &amp; such instead of making it all online with real ppl? Fallout fans fell in love with the series bc it‚Äôs a good single player RPG, not a MMORPG. 
---
"old bugs and glitches coming back"? I mean, you didn't elaborate on anything except that you don't like that plans are available, which is kind of a shitty complaint. I mean, you think that's overpriced? Guess how much you would have paid for any of those plans from someone who had to server hop a **thousand** times to get the plan you want.
---
I see it as a way for people to offer services- if I buy every t60 mod plan, I can now over to install those for people, and hopefully get a return on my investment.
---
Be honest, you really thought we needed RNG at the fucking vendor? I'm glad they didn't listen to you, that's the dumbest fucking thing about the game, and I'm glad they fixed it.
---
If I want a jetpack for my power armor I shouldn't have to pay a fucking random to get it- more I can get it myself if I want to save up for it. And the plan is CHEAP! You had to pay the same price just for the mod, now you get the plan too!
---
I'm fucking sick and tired of people finding stupid shit to whine about with this game- it's their fucking game, it's their creative license, suck it up cupcake!
---
WTF
---
Last time I used a support ticket, they replied within 24 hours to tell me to get bent (serum not working).
---
It would be nice if that would work, but the Bethesda database engine does not allow for unique item tracking, only quantity of each item.  No ownership history, or anything like that.  I highly doubt they even keep detailed histories on inventory content, as they claim they can't restore items that 'disappear' from your inventory.   So if they can't verify you owned an object, and restore it, chances are they can't go back and take a look at your inventory contents over time. 
---
Do you play PS4 by chance?
---
Nothing I said was an opinion. Everything I stated was a fact so this comment really isn't helpful.
---
Yeah I don't get how I can be banned for item duplication if they told us they fixed it. They either lied to us about their fix or about me duping. 
---
I'm with you.  I loved my tse weapons for when I was just exploring or hopping vendors because they made crowd control really easy so I wasn't constantly getting wrecked by robots or supermutants. 
---
   Normally I just used my anti armor gatling gun when questing so I wasn't blowing through things and going to fast, but I completely understand that's how some people like to play and that's completely fine.  
---
   TSE weapons were also extremely helpful for the queen fight when a bunch of people joined and made her invincible.  They did do a lot of damage to her, but when there was a ton of people they were almost neccessary.
---
   Regarding PVP I never had a problem with it.  I'm a heavy weapons power armor build so slap damage is nearly nothing, but I could see how it might effect low health players.  If you dont want to get killed by a TSE wielding player just run away dont fight back and heal and you'll be just fine.  I would completely understand if they applied the nerf to the new pvp servers or just outright took them out, but from what I saw they weren't a problem outside of pvp in the regular servers.  Most people are just playing the game as PvE anyway.
---
   The people that were able to one shot the queen and kill people outside of PvP combat were stacking bobbleheads, it wasn't the TSE.  
---
   There was a small amount of players that had bad experiences with getting killed by TSE, and they whined and botched so much that they ruined the game for a lot of people.  It's really sad.
---
Okay, based on the comments here, I'm switching from thinking you guys are naive to thinking you must just be trying to lay the groundwork for your own defenses when the hammer drops on you.  Good luck with that.
---
Then they should get the one early in the right ffs.  The ppl responsible for this shit show don‚Äôt deserve a fucking weekend, or even a paycheck for that matter.
---
I‚Äôm with u/briellie. You think anyone gives a shit if you guys leave the game? Why does everyone act like they are some sort of PewDiePie or something? Get lost, you won‚Äôt be missed. I‚Äôm so tired of these theatrical posts.
---
What will make or break this game is a big year one rerelease/patch. If that doesn't happen I dont see this game lasting.
---
Thank you for the warm wishes
---
I don't dispute "don't cheat" and won't address that point. I have no way of knowing if the OP cheated and neither do you.
---
Those merits of your argument aside, creating a ticketing system for this stuff is trivial.
---
Playing on xbone and none of my other 40+ physical or digital games crash like this. 
---
They've been holding it in since launch, most likely.
---

---
Ya I can put it on for you but I don‚Äôt have the plan though
---
This some bullshit man
---
Interesting. They left out NPCs, professional writers, and the modding community. 
---
It's a feature.
---
I got 22 ammo from the sbc last night nothing else and then dropped out to windows just before the event completion, first time it happened though.
---
At this point It sure seems they should have stayed away from it haha but at 500 hrs I‚Äôve had fun overall 
---
You're able to FT to friends.  You can even add someone to your list, have them join you, and then you can FT to them when they are on your server.
---
I don't buy digital for this reason.
---
Could be I forget sometimes that a world beyond consoles exists, haha. My wife and I and our friends play several games together and we've only had  unpredictable, disastrous, regular crashes with this game. 
---
To be honest, I haven't read a single TOS in my life, and I've been a computer geek for 30+ years.  I don't even think I know anyone who's read a TOS.  Hell, until 'online only' and 'online updates' became a thing, TOS's were jokes, because what were they gonna do, storm your house with a swat team and take your hard drive?
---
What white springs nerf?
---
Yeah, it's worse now. 
---
They should take that shit to their therapist then.
---
People are complaining about all the bugs they created and brought back, not the TSE nerf. A majority of this sub agrees that it was needed and it's still a powerful combination anyway. 
---
Ive crafted 2500 ore using 1250+ acid while spamming space and E multiple times this week. No possible way you were banned for excessive crafting of 10 guns. Stop even fuckin tryin my dude. But if you get unbanned ill buy one your guns eh?
---
Fixing bobby pin weight is the least of the problems plaguing the game.
---
There is a wellspring of talent available here on reddit. The PC modding community has literally been serving you guys potential fixes for a lot of the big issues on a silver platter, without so much as a nod of recognition.
---
The easiest way to put out the fire is to not start it in the first place.
---
I know it's your job to relay the messages back. And you have zero control over the decision making. For God's sake someone needs to swallow their damned pride and just follow through with some common sense.
---
Myself and others have all written posts on how to address some of the nonsense going on in terms of gameplay and it's like writing a letter to Santa. 
---
A lot of us have simply had it with the horseshit decision making going on. We have better things to do with our time and money than waste it on ingrates.
---
I have this too. And I hate the ammo bug eating plasma cores
---
I won't be surprised if they nerf melee weapons next. Every patch is supposed to weaken us and make our enemies stronger. Don't you see the survival aspects here? SURVIVING IN THE GAME IS THE NEW CONTENT!
---
Even the discs now are only a code to install. The disc helps for slow internet, but is otherwise useless. We're basically screwed either way. 
---
Cultist blade is one handed. Looks pretty cool but has slow swing speed and mediocre base dmg.
---
have you never played a game that gets patched before?
---
What works for me is scapping everything then storing it all in my stash. If some of the components are in my inventory and the rest in my stash I can't repair
---
Your right. We dont know their budget. We know they are not achieving their goals though. Im assuming that they do not have substantial resources on quality because there isnt a good show of it. For game mechanics, im assuming not many people with good experience it are there because we currently have one majorly viable way of playing the game: melee. Im going through the groups that should be in place to do certain things and im seeing certain things not be done. 
---
I bring up my experience and knowledge because, void of mechanical application, that is the right state if the art way of making a system of any sort in the modern day. Any system. Its not what every successful company does, but thinking through it, if they didnt have anything there in the first place itd be good to start considering it.
---
You could still sell the made mods. Just because the mods are available doesn‚Äôt mean people want to farm caps for the plans, then farm mats for the mods.
---
I worry about this sometimes, because I'll put on Chemist and Super Duper to cook ribeyes and make Healing Salve for quick trade caps, and the server will spaz out while crafting. The only alternative is to slowly sit and push the button about once per second. If their server can't even handle a valid crafting mechanic, who's fault is it really? 
---
It‚Äôs a fact that you feel that way, but it doesn‚Äôt make your opinion a fact. And I wasn‚Äôt trying to be helpful I came for the downvotes
---
My damage resist is so hiiiiiigh!
---
Bethesda has said so many times that isn't happening. Do they need to write it on a brick and hit you with it?
---
Just jumped in queue. I‚Äôll try to help out. 
---
What dupe are you referring to that was rolled back? Are you referring to the post that was deleted due to it's lack of credibility? There was 3 dupes and only one was left unfixed and unfortunately remains that way. Yes nerfing single a card providing double explosive damage may seem harsh but look how many shotgunner or riffleman cards were needed for a boost.. they will continue to balance the cards AFTER they remove the value of all duplicated objects currently residing on eBay for real money and most likely balance all cards so there is no one build fits all approach.. btw thank you for your input and time spent in your reply all opinions are valued, we may not agree but conversation is good in regards to people actually seeing all sides to a conversation.  
---
We are trying, Fallout 4 was my first Bethesda Game, and my first Fallout since 1/2..   
---
I want this, as many do, to be not only what we were promised, but what we have been dreaming about.
---
I think the scarcity and randomness of grinding for plans helped hide the fact that there's no endgame. It have you *something* to do and shoot for.
---
The change to plan availability was a good one, but now the fact that there's nothing else to do is is painfully obvious
---
If you have the rifleman perks then yes you will have a higher damage number than a base damage fat man, but with the heavy weapons perk and explosive damage perk the fat man will  out damage your black powder rifle by the hundreds 
---
To be fair... The known tag for plans had the exact same bugs as the mod that people used
---
What's she pooping next? Overweight bobby pins?
---
Let us free our tamed pets too. I'm stuck with my megasloth for life
---
I've personally offered them Raider Power Armor paints, and Raider Power Armor variants to give us more Diversity / Options.  
---
I mean FFS half of the PA spawns are Raider... Give us some damn love!
---
It 100% did. 
---
All of the complaint posts of people peeved off that players would kill all of the ghouls while farming whitesprings, or kill the legendaries during Uranium Fever without allowing people to tag them, is my evidence.
---
Needing a group to accomplish something encourages cooperation. Being able to do everything yourself, and even being negatively impacted by other players (taking Exp./ability to loot legendaries away as the example), encourages going solo.
---
Just because something encourages people to go solo, doesn't mean it's impossible to cooperate. It just means that the mechanics discourage it.
---
20 hours
---
There's a plan for a grognak axe replica in the dev room, but I'm pretty sure it is unavailable through legitimate means at the moment
---
Lololololol
---
It's called addiction. Break it before it breaks you. 
---
Fallout 3 was my favorite game then Fallout Vegas ruined the series for me. 
---
Chill, bro. She seems to be the one person in the operation at this point that can see straight and knows the difference between an ass and an elbow. 
---
In such a state, this is deserving of praise. 
---
I am sure this will get downvoted to shit but whatever.  We all should have been lighting the torches and grabbing pitchforks day one of the beta.  There were far too many people on this subreddit letting Bethesda get away with this crap.
---
Every person that had a "Stop hating, this game is fine, I had fun today" shit post did nothing to help solve the problems.  Its sad it took nearly 3 months for people to realize this is a slow burning dumpster fire.
---
I love the fallout universe.  I want this game to be great, but we were well over due for a reality check.  I am glad people are making noise and I hope things change.
---
This was the main issue the whole time. Seperate ts and e. One or the other. No benefits from demo expert. 
---
Fix the bobblehead stacking issue with a "hotfix" and the tse "crisis" was over. 
---
Well said sir!
---
got a 50 cal Prime Receiver off of a SB near the pumpkin house.  Thanks all
---
We're relying on you to give us that hard hitting news and those keen observations.
---
Are mods safe to use? I think I remember reading something about mods getting people banned.
---
Lol, me too
---
If I remember i saw grognak plan at watago station vendor
---
I was pretty well done when I read a post from some rando-terd demanding Bethesda starts firing everyone. So great. 
---
No. This gets said with every game that shits the bed.  But it‚Äôs never true. By the time the new game is announced, and the marketing team releases a cool looking trailer, this sub and everyone in it will forget all about the bad done in the past, and will rush to GameStop to place their pre-order. 
---
Every time. Rinse and repeat. 
---
That... Could be awesome....   
---
And if Fallout NV can be ported into Fallout 4...
---
None existent
---
Well put more into it than that, "how" did they mess it up besides the TSE Nerf? I love to hear it from all sides, we may not agree but information is important as a community.
---
Mods are still random, they updated the patch notes
---
YES! This please!
---
\^ exactly. Good idea, but who knows....
---
Noice :) thats what we like
---
Kind of shitty for you to put part of the blame on QA. Those guys work their asses off and at the end of the day all they can do is report what they see. They have absolutely no control over what gets fixed.
---
(Coming from a former QA tester)
---
I'm not having constant crash problems, maybe you should stop using third party mods to cheat?
---
Was thinking the same
---
Diablo 3 snuck up and grabbed my attention after the retro event, strangely. Never played after it first came out. Alternating true D1 and the new season gameplay on higher difficulty. Still playing 76, just relaxed with my story run characters, they don‚Äôt take combat perks and generally only play when friend / fam log on. Unlike you I have no high levels and more than half the story / side quests and faction stuff left to see. I‚Äôll see it when ui fixes, action Bar setup, and containers and camps get the finishing touches they deserve.
---
Melee still exists, bloodied still exists, MIRV grenades still exist, airstrike beacons still exist, prime receivers still exist. Queen can still easily be done
---
I mean I got it on a black friday sale and still don't feel like I got the money's worth. Took me and my bro forever to progress to lvl40 and we basically stopped there because we couldn't put up with the crashes
---
There's a QA team?
---
Usually those check these things before they are shipped to avoid messes like this, so I remain unconvinced there is one involved.
---
Put the MIRV attachment on it, it sounds lovely
---
No you don't. You need to go play Hello Kitty Island Adventure. Where I will be, too. 
---
It's not, normal I mean..  and you have a point (and not the first person to notice it..).  
---
Does make me break out the tinfoil hat however ;)
---
Also looking for this, along with BOS combat armor plans. They seem to have been forgotten or moved to another source without any info about it in the patch notes.
---
not sure if this is a "fix" or a new bug.  bulked plastic is no longer available to bulk other items
---
I agree, and understand balances will come, they just needed to "nuke" the elephant in the room and totally de-value the current market. BTW thank you for your well thought opinion I did appreciate the feedback.
---
Not everyone brought them, so what about them? Punished cos they were lucky and people like you run around in PA hitting stuff how boring 
---
Still have it craftable but need raw yellowcake since it's ya know, nuclear
---
I've sent coding to fix bugs. And other fixes
---
Yea man since I had this idea a couple of my friends have been looking for me as well and I have seen a few pics of the Nuka Cranberry signs. I like them alot but they all seem to have this problem of tiles falling off. 
---
However this is the most in tact one I have seen a pic of so thanks for the find. I'm wondering now if I would be able to build up some stairs around the pole and make my home on the back of the sign. That would be cool.
---
Here, have two truths and a lie: slower, more resource-intensive, and more rewarding. 
---
Big waste of money. I forced myself to play for about an hour and it's shit. Probably the worst game I've ever paid for!
---
Yep. They just should have made pre-order go out super far, tell everyone it's in beta and will be for the next year and that a pre-order allows you to play the beta like an early access kind of thing, and transfer progress to the finished game when it is released. They should still be in beta now. Hell, that original beta should have been the alpha. 
---
Why do you care then if you already quit ? 
---
I, for one, would definitely like a full respec. I built my perks around the 2s handmade and now that the damage is nerfed I have points on useless perks now. Would be nice to be able to trade perk cards in.
---
You will have to unbulk the junk to be able to use  it to repair any weapons and armour
---
Some of the content, atleast what I've found, is exceptional, the voice acting and stories are very compelling, but you have to find it, and often it's broken into parts you have to find, which results in a disjointed experience until you listen to all of the holotapes in order.   
---
I'm not excusing any mistakes, I'm just saying there is actually some quality story telling in '76, it's under our noses.
---
Had he posted 4 days ago with a more convincing story, I would prob take his side. But you are right, only he knows. So he should keep it to himself.
---
What are you talking about down on luck? The OP clearly had this mask and is wondering why it disappeared. You are still choosing to talk about something related but still completely different than what the OP was discussing. 
---
The person asked a question and all you did was rant more about your obsession with dupers and cheaters. In fact the OP appears to be one of the persons who acquired this mask unbeknownst to this situation like so many before them. Making the OP the exact majestic creature you are referring to. 
---
In fact. It appears that you were the one coming here making loose comparisons to our majestic OP‚Äôs topic here. Derp. All you did originally was come here mass blanketing people as ‚Äúlittle snakes‚Äù and now you just keep backpedaling from your statement.
---
Yeah. You were better off with the weasels.
---
Well that's...disappointing. 
---
I don't know what they do? I see exactly what they do. They are the community managers of which I am a member. Their communication is repetive and cookie-cutter at best. I have worked in customer service for 20+ years. If I gave these kinds of of responses I would have never lasted this long.
---
You've never seen this many comments on a thread? They are all the same. "I'll communicate that to the devs." Nothing new here. What's the point of posting the same thing 20 times?
---
I'm not telling them to be silent. Quite the opposite. I'm asking for better than these cookie-cutter responses. 
---
Honestly this is one of the best posts on here. Very well put. 
---
xbox live was having issues earlier
---
Yea I just posted a thread asking people for help scouting. I am a Nuka Cola nut and on the look out for Nuka Cola Billboards that are in ttact and clean that I can build camp on. If you know of any or have come across any feel free to drop in my thread or reply with a lead, pic, or location. Happy Hunting!
---
Gild the fuck out of this thread.
---
If you do research, you will find that e-mail is a 'canned' form letter they send out to anyone they suspect of duping.
---
I've seen two people crash a server by crafting large amounts of boiled water.   And hell, I've even caused 'server not responding' by blowing through my inventory to craft bulk items.  So 'excessive item creation' could simply mean he caused too much server lag one too many times.
---
But I want everyone to know that I'm leaving and give my unique personal reasons why so they can acknowledge my individuality and beg me to stay :(((((
---
Thank you. I just noticed the bulk autoscrapping bug myself.
---
Thank you poster 
---
Maybe they should be banned from making half assed games?!
---
Serious question...
---
Anyone know of a game kinda like what fallout 76 should have been? Because I just can't do this anymore...
---
Yeah and you count as everyone? Its like saying ‚Äûworld hunger doesn‚Äôt exist because i just ate dinner‚Äú. Get bent dude
---
Plans for mods are random on the vendors they used to be? It doesn‚Äôt seem clear with what they updated, and I‚Äôve seen 0 random plans at grafton station over a dozen hops. The list of plans is always the same.
---
Though filled with some salt, I would recommend reading some of the more detailed replies, I agree plasma nades make short work of clustered groups. Thank you for your input and yes explosions should, without cards, have more oomph than they do currently.
---
jesus how do you have that much time? Sorry you optimized the fun out of the game. They fucked up here sure, but they warned you that there would be growing pains
---
Yes and No.   
---
The official stance is mods are not supported, and some people have used "Cheat Engine" claiming it's nothing more than a mod (not true)..   
---
I also can't advise you from a legal perspective, because I'm not a IP Lawyer...  
---
But generally speaking using something like Perk Loadout Manager, or an ENB/ReShade, or a retextured of a map or the Pipboy isn't going to get you banned.
---
No!!! I‚Äôm not leaving.
---
You‚Äôre reverse psychology has worked on me üòÇ
---
The atom store dudes must work on commission. Just go buy a fancy emoji, bro.
---
The devs--the actual guys making fixes--must be overworked, underpaid, and under exceptionally poor leadership. As a sys admin, I feel for them.
---
Agreed
---
You'd of?  How does one of?  Are you ofing right now?  
---
Nerfed the spawns and drops 
---
No biggie. It's all good, man.
---
Me
---
Happens on and off with random mutations for me almost every play session, 1-3 times a night I‚Äôd say. Usually Marsupial. :(
---
i am the same way.  in fo4, building settlements was what i liked most.  never mind the main story line, or even side quests.  sure, when i ran out of materials, i would continue the story.  then go back to building up settlements.
---
i know the build budget has a purpose, but what is it?
---
here is a pic of my current CAMP.
---
[https://ibb.co/5KKNDpj](https://ibb.co/5KKNDpj)
---
this TINY compared to my fo4 settlements.
---
Anything back from them?  
---
Not asking to pile on, I am just curious if you've actually heard something back from the void.
---
Go look at Fallout 76 patch notes December 11th, 2018. 
---
Only complaint so far. I have sub par internet and I know connection issues.
---
The powder rifle has always bugged me.. there's no reason why a ball loaded musket would do more damage than a modern rifle. Irks me and it's stupidly overpowered in PvP.
---
You're right. Those posts are drowning out all the other interesting discussions about the game like
---
Is the inbulking as of the new patch? 
---
What if you‚Äôre level 181.5
---
I dont believe you are capable of thinking anything to be honest
---
I love how they downvote you while all the highly upvoted votes are of people leaving the game, its like they got this dual personality where they still want to defend this garbage fire but still bail on it.
---
Oh RDR2 IMO is the best game made to date. BUT... BUUUUUUUT... If you think the multiplayer is bad here. LMAO, you haven't seen anything yet. RDR2 has hands down the worst online experience I have ever seen lol. 
---
Thank you for your well thought out and eclectic input, you are a pillar of this community and we are all the better to have you as part of it. üòÅ
---
Get grinding! That's all we'll have for a while.
---
I've done 3 since the patch and it's about the same. It only takes a little bit longer than before
---
Hey man my tse handmade now barely creeps over 100 with rifle perks and demo expert :l it's a very sad day
---
Gotta test the waters....
---
I hope you are kidding about the disease, otherwise i really hope you get well and recover.
---
Can you direct the Atom Store team to work on the game? That atom store works goddamn flawlessly. Not the best outfit decisions, but flawless. My money has never not gone through. It's like you made a plan on this part or something.
---
Yet all the diehard fans will still claim how it's just a mainstream opinion or that I'm just jumping on the hate bandwagon. Eat shit sweaty fanboys, you'd apparently eat it anyway if Bethesda told you to......
---
I see where your coming from with the killing Legendaries and stuff, but I don't really think it was that much of a problem.  If you saw someone using tse just go to a different area of whitesprings and farm there.  
---
As far as needing a group for certain activities, I don't agree with that.  Fallout 76 was designed for people to be able to play how they want.  Some people just like to play solo and do things themselves.  If they want to play that way it's not selfish its just how they are.  I've met a lot of people that play that way and actively try to avoid other players, but for certain things such as events it's kind of hard to avoid people 100%.
---
did i say MWO??  NO
---
did i say PGI is god?  NO
---
are you a moron.  YES
---
priceless!
---
What work ? The dupers were selling them for 1.5 to 3k caps each 
---
I'm a Test Lead myself. I understand that the power of QA is limited. 
---
That said, I see multiple builds before release. When my team reports a defect, it is my job to make sure that it gets logged into a report and development teams are notified. It is also my job to recognize that there is an issue when the same defect(s) appears in subsequent builds, and escalate that issue until it is getting the attention that it should be getting. 
---
Maybe QA is completely blame free in this case, but I know that if there was a bug that existed for multiple years, in multiple builds, and now in multiple products.... I would personally feel like I wasn't doing my job as a test lead. 
---
XB1
---
The bugs created after this patch will be fixed after they're identified. Throwing a BF does nothing. Threatening to not play doesn't either. 
---
They even said that a quick fix was coming soon in about a week or so. ESO had issues on launch too and look at it now
---
It does
---
Well yeah, somebody have to make sure the dark rum tastes good and the merchandise looks groovy before shipping. Do you expect them to do that and test the game all at once? :D. 
---
Thanks for the vote of confidence!  
---
I just want our voices to be heard, acknowledged and our time and work used.
---
So i don‚Äôt know if this was an issue with this patch or a pre existing issue but I‚Äôm finding that occasionally when i team up with a friend and we travel together there comes a point where they become totally invisible to me. As in they can be standing right in front of me and i cant see them at all. It doesn‚Äôt seam to affect them because they see me fine and I‚Äôm the only one that has seen this issue with my friends. I mean totally invisible. Cant see their character, name, icon on radar, nothing. It makes teaming up difficult when i have to keep asking where they are and ghost questing with them.   Restarting the game sometimes fixes it for a bit but then it happens again. Usually after we go through a load screen  is when it starts. Example: going into the bunker to get to the enclave area. 
---
Yeah, because that 15 life sure does break the game.  Oh no, I might have to hit you with a lvl 1 machete to overcome that HUGE advantage of 15 health. 
---
I'm sure they will after they deal with the elephant in the room.
---
I don't think I actually gave any opinions in the whole piece. Why don't you read it and then let me know how you feel? That is how social progress is made.
---
I mean, the reason we don't use muskets any more is that they were slow and inaccurate, not that they weren't powerful. My google-fu isn't great, but sources I could find indicated that a musket ball would have more mass than a modern bullet, and to the best of my knowledge would also have a greater powder load behind it.
---
Now, sure, a nuke should still be just a _wee_ bit stronger, but we're talking about a video game, and video games strive to have balance. Mini-nukes do AoE damage plus lingering radiation. It might be realistic that they basically obliterate any unarmoured target and seriously damage armoured ones, but if one weapon was just the "I win" button, it wouldn't be very fun. So things get kept in a closer range than might be realistic, and given trade-offs, in order to give players more reason to play around with different weapons.
---
_(Sorry if I'm giving too serious a response to what is meant to be a humourous post.)_
---
Can we please have more fishing hat variations? I like to RP fishing while not being able to actually fish. 
---
Also, I‚Äôd really enjoy a Gatling laser skin so that the shining 2 seconds of use I get out of it before breaking, are stunning and memorable. 
---
LOL https://youtu.be/C8wQdLA6pdc
---
Could just be chance, but I've seen more console players mention crashes with 76. &gt;.&lt;
---
Agreed. These posts are getting old.
---
Found the vegan melee
---
&gt;  If they want to play that way it's not selfish its just how they are. 
---
One does not need to be a god to play that way. Wanting to be a solo god however, regardless of how it effects all of those who don't play that way, is extremely selfish.
---
Done.
---
He's duping.
---
You may not care, and to some degree I don't either. However, it should be voiced. Bethesda should know why they lost a customer.
---
Well, that's assuming they quit for good and it's not some childish outburst that'll see them skulk back as soon as the next update or DLC comes along.
---
Still though, take the good with the bad.
---
See I‚Äôm not convinced the Bos Legs actually exist. I have the arms, and while server hopping over and over and over, randomly got it scrapping a leg. But even though it said unlocked, it won‚Äôt let me craft it
---
Pissing me off
---
Launch it yourself
---
You can get the mistress outfit in game so technically it's not completely pay to win
---
"Testing... We keep seeing this word. What does this mean exactly?"
---
You're a duper. I don't know why people who get rightfully banned always come online trying to convince themselves and everyone else that they were wrongfully banned
---
Thanks 
---
Oh, I didn't know.  I'm sorry.
---
It's a bad game and if a customer is not satisfied they will voice their complaints, you're sick and tired of letting "stupid" shit piss you off, that's on you not no one else.
---
Discord / Twitch Community.  And there is a certain amount of trust involved, however most times when I handed items over, I simply expected it to be offloaded to someone who needed it, and I would get something when I needed it.... In other words open community trade.  There was never a transactional nature to my use of Matthews Mule character.  If it was high value items, I'd make a note for myself if it was more than I could remember for a day or two.. until vendors freed up for me to sell the items.  If those items were no longer there when I went to retrieve them, eh oh well... there'd be more to come down the pipe.
---
The key here is Community.   When the group was running together, we pooled and shared resources, ammo, and materials.  Someone need their armor upgraded, they simply handed it over to someone with the skills, along with a few materials, and it was upgraded, usually without a fee.
---
they are so lucky to have a user base who will sit there and find workarounds like you did to start slowly pressing th ebutton in order to get around their shitty coding. that was kind of what i was ranting about in my post. we work so hard to get around their bugs, they should be thanking us everyday for persevering instead of banning people for trying to use game mechanics 
---
If you are trying to get your money back or complain to the retailer you should do that instead of crying on reddit. Bethesdass forum would probably be more suited? Or maybe your retailer?
---
Moral of the story is don't play online games with shared password or shared emails in the world of infinite free emails just make a new address and associated account for every game you play. 
---
Ms will ban your Xbox account if you link open on Skype because it's against the tos. And the ban every account associated with phone number of a banned account. So think twice before you add that phone number.
---
Only as of last patch I think actually
---
Yeah, but you could also pull a Fat Man out of your pocket so there's that lol.
---
Or is that how you validate your self-worth?
---
I mean... even private servers would be a mess, honestly. Think about how much server hopping we already have to so in the game, and them how they'd get everyone to sync up with the right mod packages, etc... itd be a mess regardless...
---
LOL if you can‚Äôt be assed to to learn about the most basic of game mechanics before you start trying to tell someone that they‚Äôre wrong (much less actually understand what was written) I‚Äôm not going to cater to your tendies. Especially when you are the one that started the disrespect.
---
No worries!
---
But that‚Äôs not Bethesda addressing their fuck up. 
---
I think those posts are valid keep them coming....for every one of those 1000 players have quit....to much condoning of Bethesda has gone on in this sub. Now nerf melee and totally break the game so that then they will have to actually take a serious look at game balance.
---
There's also an issue where class freak doesn't affect grounded or empath, the description in status for grounded is correct but the effect is still -50 percent energy weapon damage, same with empath
---
lmao
---
Fallout 76% off
---
&gt;  It appears that a merge of internal development builds failed to execute properly
---
You don't say.
---
Does anyone even check the diffs?
---
Is there even unit testing in place?
---
WTF?!
---
I'm glad this isn't some RTOS for navigation or anything health care related.
---
For Fallout 4? Sure.
---
MORE PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THIS TO UNDERSTAND HOW BAD BETHESDA FUCKED UP.
---
I am seeing so many of these posts. I am disappointed. 
---
&gt; nd through it all... the true fans 
---
Sorry but that is some gatekeeping bullshit.  
---
So only a "true fan" would take all of this abuse before walking away ? Nonsense.
---
&gt;This game has been made consistently less enjoyable to play with each patch thanks to the lowering of legendary droprates 
---
And any time I have ever started a thread complaining about it, I have been down voted to hell and told "it's the nature of RNG, get over it" and "you aren't really farming correctly for legendaries."  
---
In other words, it was completely my fault. 
---
Now today, this is suddenly an important issue. 
---
In other words, before the TSE nerf, Bethesda could do no wrong, and any problems people like me had with the game- we were just trolls. 
---
As soon as the TSE nerf hits, suddenly there's a shit ton of people saying that they are rage quitting the game and how terrible Bethesda is as a developer and they can't do anything right. 
---
And you are telling us it has nothing to do with TSE dupers being salty huh? 
---
Yeah. 
---
Okay. 
---
A mini nuke is weaker than a single hit with a sword
---
They won‚Äôt stop till it‚Äôs all nerft into the ground. One meta at a time til it‚Äôs all weakened grindy dogshit. Bloodied, Furious, Stalkers, Melee, you are next in line.

4) Some perk card that affect the same stat are cumulative and some are additive.  Why?  Shouldn't they either all be cumulative (stack on each other) or all by additive?  Example:  Lone Wanderer &amp; Action Boy/Girl are cumulative but Rifleman/Expert/Master are additive.  ([See this post for more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/allfj9/why_are_certain_perk_cards_that_affect_the_same/)).  So not sure if this is a bug or by design.  If by design it doesn't make sense.
---
The All Rise gives +10 health for **holding it in your hand**. Its not that big of a deal.
---
I've been through it all. I agree. It's exceptional. It's good. Why did they hire so many great writers and voice actors to play a dead world? Would it have hurt to have a few people be alive? Would it have hurt to include very fallout morally ambiguous decision making?
---
Regardless, thank you for putting in hours on this game. I appreciate your efforts.
---
They killed it with no mans sky!! 
---
I don't think you deserve a downvote for doing the right thing.  If anything you deserve the praise you are getting.  The internet and the world in general would be better if more people would apologize when they are wrong rather then digging in and attacking people.  I for one appreciate the example you have given the community.
---
What innocent players? My TSE still does decent damage post Nerf, and it's acceptable, before there was no challenge, it was boring now it takes a few shots to down a 98 SM and I can easily get mobbed if I'm not careful. One punch Manning everything gets super boring is all I'm saying.
---
So should we just ignore trading as a feature, or continue to blame people for being the victims of a rampant bug abuse that we took no part in. Glad I‚Äôm getting the shaft for not cheating, meanwhile cheaters have plenty more caps where they can just continue to benefit from cheating. Good move Bethesda. 
---
&gt;what's the harm in it?
---
The purpose of the ban isn't to make it right, it's to punish you for breaking the TOS.  If they just reset your character that's not much deterrent.
---
A ghoul ghoul?
---
I'm personally vexed by the explosive vent plans. Apparently the RNG never thinks I have enough of them. XD
---
They gotta keep the lights one lol. 
---
Where is this update you speak of? I don‚Äôt see it in Bethesda‚Äôs patch notes page 
---
I was exaggerating and embellishing quite a bit, but I‚Äôm not doing too well. It‚Äôll pass eventually. Thanks for your concern. :)
---
\* sigh \*
---
No. I think this is like the 4th or 5th time I've seen someone post about it.
---
The conditions are so specific and the benefit so meagre to render it near insignificant.
---
Also the bonus isn't attached to the item, it's attached to the even, that ends in 4 days. That's also assuming you're playing with your team within all that time.
---
At best it affects team vs team PvP. A roaving band of griefers just isn't a thing and even if it was the MAX +45 health (less with fewer team members) you may not even notice as a lot of weapons do well above that damage.
---
When there's a real issue, I'm with you but until then, let's not cry wolf.
---
Agreed on the server stress as for the gears /springs etc thats as easy as adjusting re spawn rates.  At one point (I believe) they said that they will eventually allow private servers, though I could be wrong, and mods are coming for sure.  We shall see.

You‚Äôre probably over encumbered by ammo, such as mini nukes or missiles.
---
Every patch has!  I remember fondly the outrage due to nerfs in the first post launch patch!  Everything has made the game more grindy. They seem to have taken it to a whole new level this time.  I haven't played for a month due to the previous grind and felt bad about it since i have hundreds of hours in since launch day.  No way I'm coming back now.
---
I love the mire's atmosphere especially at night. Beautiful and peaceful but eerie. I'll probably move there some day when I'm done living on top of Seneca's north peak
---
I got all my BOS mod plans from Grafton...but it took forever server hopping.
---
If anyone thinks bethesda is dead after this game, you are delusional.
---
Then demand Bethesda release sales &amp; server census data.
---
pretty sure they will not.
---
p=mv
---
But physics, tho.
---
Idk who was the bully here... your initial reply to my well backed up rant was rather antagonizing.
---
Yes, I want your fusion cores...please... xbox... on in the evening on the west coast...please... oh and a lever action exploding bullets with a scope... thanks again, I wish you all the best of luck in your gaming careers. 
---
You do know you wont find a perfect game release, ever...I mean ever. I've been gaming for 35 years... I have played every platform and have beta tested a lot of games... the release product was still full of bugs...but devs know where their paycheck comes from, me the end user...keep sending feedback, it's how all games work. You should've seen how buggy elder scrolls arena was (1994), or how laggy dark ages of Camelot (2000) was... oh, that's something to complain about...internet speed was 1.44 mbs at its fastest... 
---
good luck. And please consider me when leaving, again. I play in the evenings on the west coast...thanks.
---
Just south of the Creamery, at the top of the hill behind the tanning shack, there's a copper deposit. Cats, chickens, foxes, frogs, radstag, etc. all spawn there randomly. 
---
I noticed this happening to me a lot. There is a bug currently where only when you open your map and it shows your weight in the bottom right corner, do you actually see your accurate current weight.
---
It‚Äôs super annoying.
---
Ahh nuts
---
Do you plan to address the issue where you made perks irrelevant by making them all useless?
---
An increase in DPS of 6% is NOT exciting,
---
Fallout perks are supposed to be exciting game changing upgrades to your character. By nerfing level ups down to oblivion, you're solving the PvP aspect of the game balance, but killing PvE and the game. 
---
No I even offered free qa as that's my profession 
---
It's aight, ya gotta turn off a ton of bs aim assist, took me around 10 mins to fix my shit on console. Besides that, I recommend rotating games so the dissatisfaction doesn't build up too high for every game, cuzz all these new releases have become stale already, in my opinion
---
THIS EXPLAINS SO MUCH NOW
---
my friend kept on saying he got mothman eyes but it looked like red tactical so I was really confused...
---
Thank you for your concern with: Beth, when are we going to fix the ghost c.a.m.p budget storage issues. 
---
We are extremely pleased to inform you this is not a bug. This is a new feature we implemented in B.E.T.A. 
---
We are happy to see that you are enjoying it as much as we are enjoying watching the anguish it is causing you. 
---
To show how much we appreciate your trust and support of our company we have silently increased the weight of Bobby pins back to there originally intended weight.  
---
Be sure to purchase our first implementation of pay to gain with our Unstoppables Clothing Line and watch in angst as we slowly begin to filter in more pay to gain items in an ever failing attempt to take the last few dollars from an extremely trusting fan base. 
---
In case you are curious we are hard at work breaking the game even further in hopes of fulfilling our promise of supporting the game with free DLC as long as people are playing. In our eyes the faster people quite playing, after paying of course, the quicker we have met our obligations. 
---
Thanks for your money and some proverbial stinky finger 
---
Bethesda. 
---
From what I was told the bonus is only till feb 2 or something...correct me if I‚Äôm wrong please
---
Well they are banning players after all! 
---
"Testing... Now why would we do that for? That only makes us find bugs and we don't like bugs. Our QA is too busy drinking the dark rum and posing with the merchandise. Do you think they can do that and play games all day?"
---
I just got done playing for a few hours with no issues
---
From [steampowered.com](https://steampowered.com) you can find it there and it's very clear about it.
---
You should focus on facts rather than opinions before trying to correct somebody.
---
How to unbulk?
---
Every time I've had the enemy keep regenerating, it's because of a temporary server connection issue - often where there's a bit of internet connection patchiness.
---
lmao my all rise and anti-armor supersledge has this same issue as well, they keep swapping places
---
&gt;everyone seems to think there's a way to distinguish duped items
---
There is.  When you've got 50,000 bobbleheads and a million Nuka Colas, they're duped.  As for TSE, if you've got a dozen of the same one, they're duped.  They don't need unique identifiers when common sense exists.
---
Do you plan to address the stash limit issue. When ? 
---
how?
---
The game I bought was sold using the argument that I wouldn't be aware of any stash limit.
---
I'm aware of it.
---
Fix it. 
---
It isn't a bad game, they obviously planned to release more content much sooner, but they're too busy fixing bugs for all the cry babies that then turn around talking shit about their choices.
---
So what they decided to sell all the plans at vendors, that's literally cry baby shit to whine about. "I'm not going to play this game anymore because now the vendors sell all the plans!" Wahh.
---
If you don't like the game go complain the Bethesda, this circle jerk of whining has gotta fucking stop. I've got plenty of games I felt were a let down, I constantly complained and whined on Reddit exactly 0 fucking times.
---
Ok, I'll buy that...   
---
I loved running into Rose, and was excited / hoping I'd find more encounters like that..  
---
It would be fantastic, just even a little more..
---
And thanks, just trying..
---
They can't use mods to fix issues and the more mods yall.make for 76 the more people will just bitch Bethesda stole the mod
---
Maybe it's Maibelline?
---
Don't know if it is a bug but my T-60 Bright Headlamp is marked as an Atom Shop item. Has the atom symbol next to the mod when inspecting the helmet. I play on an Xbox One X.
---
Not in the least
---
They've literally said modding and private server support will launch Nov 2019.
---
It's not completely a roll-back. They've added things to the plans, which is working, to tell us if we already have them. 
---
You sure seem defensive about it
---
all blizzard titles on their platform are online games so it matters, you play on their servers and use their platform to play online, singleplayer games on the other hand...
---
Bullshit. 100% liar.
---
Finally an official ststement!
---
Just make the card three stars now
---
Having a 60% cost 5 points is absolutely fucked
---
I had a nice bug it let me actually sprint outside of my Excavator. It showed the Excavator carry weight while outside of the armor. Lost it when I fast travelled though.
---
what about the current login issue, unless the servers are still actually down and no one has said anything
---
Yeah, it's really just a name change. It still functions as a red tactical.
---
No.  There's no need for this.  It would also break the main quest lore.  If players don't feel challenged, they can gimp themselves and play with handicaps, or wait for DLC raid content like everyone else.  This kind of shit simply breeds elitism and caters to the toxic 'hard core players" who shit all over "The Filthy Casuals".
---
You might not need to be a god, but you do need to be as powerful as a team.  Most events are designed to be played by 4 players and spawn a ton of enemies. doing them solo without being op is sometimes difficult as you need to have the firepower of 4 players as one.  
---
Up to four players.
---
Apparently anyone outside your "server" appears as an uninteractable orb if you manage to find them.
---
Pc is beta for console
---
Hmm but a TSE is still better than a TS. I'm not sure what you mean with not being really affected by the nerf?
---
I agree with this, thank you for your very interesting post, I believe you are right and this will be something that is addressed in the future.
---
Oh, like every other online RPG I've ever played?  Yeah. That would make sense.
---
That wasn't what I intended to imply. 
---
As far as I am concerned, if you gave the game an honest chance and at least tried to enjoy it instead of jumping on the day one hate train just because it was the trendy thing to do then you are a "true fan". 
---
No man. I have admitted I'm wrong before.
---
Now you must admit you are wrong.
---
(Oh god this is so lame. Dad joke shit. I'm posting it anyways. My entire statement is just wrong...)
---
Meta.
---
The January 29th patch was a patched version of 1.2.0 or earlier, meaning every single bug and exploit that existed, now exists again coupled with crazy changes to weight values across the board not just Bobby pins. Enemies dropping mass amounts of legendaries even non legendary enemies. Stealth getting broken. Unnecessary nerfs to a multitude of perks that were never mentioned until after the update happened and patch notes were released. My first point should be enough to say it all but, if you want more I can keep going.
---
I understand they have to compartmentalize.   
---
I understand they need to limit access access to avoid breaches, exploiting and the exact problem with duping they've been combating.   
---
I respect there is an amount of professional pride here.  
---
But we deserve better, we can help (some of us) in our own way, many of us Specalists in specific areas...  
---
Use us, don't abuse us, give us the respect we are trying to give you.
---
Challenge Bethesda to mortal kombat and defend earth realm 
---
Except that the rum tasted awful to actual tasters, and that jacket defies a proper description, so I...  ohhhhh, I get it now.  ;)
---
I installed text chat mod after 600 hours playing solo and it totally revitalized the game for me. That said, its kinda quiet today...
---
Yeah it was pretty disappointing to not get to play on the first day of beta because my paper, disc-shaped license code hadn't been delivered by Amazon yet.
---
That‚Äôs how I got arms and chest. But now after the patch the list is always the same plans. It‚Äôs easy for me to tell because I know 100% of them.
---
Unfortunately most of Reddit is an echo chamber depending. And people are using the board to vent their frustrations. But it‚Äôs annoying for everyone else because...for the most part...we don‚Äôt care about your bitching.
---
I agree. If you are mad, quit and leave. Come back after a cold shower. We will welcome you back. Eventually
---
Hahaha have an upvote!
---
Bethesda: Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Us: Nani
---
Ditto re: the decorating. I miss that too. I am not buying various plans and things in the Atom Shop because my small, one-story CAMP is maxed out with very little stuff. 
---
You said yourself, the ban was for ‚Äúexcess item **creation**‚Äù this means your excuse about mulling for other people doesn‚Äôt cover it, they caught you for duping, **not** for carry too much, those are two are completely different things, thus them not accepting your response. 
---
Well quit see ya later
---
Do you plan to address the communication issues between us?
---
We (fans) might be reporting bugs, and you (PR) might be reporting issues to the dev team, but as long as we don't see the dev team's roadmap, we might only be screaming in the void.
---
If we had access to the dev team's roadmap, we would have pointed out any unwanted change before you started implementation. (Perk nerfing, feed the people fixes, ...) and would have been able to discuss priorities (and PvP servers were NOT a priority. Fix PvE and general playability first) 
---
Lol it‚Äôs back
---
You do realize that not every TS gun has explosive? And not every explosive gun has TS?
---
I'm glad your TSE is still one of the best weapons in the game. Everyone with TS, Explosive, and even heavy explosive weapons got fucked. 
---
Your whole argument so far has been about duped TSE and Bethesda nerfed nearly every gun in the game but explosive. How the fuck did that solve the dupe problem?
---
Are we talking about plans for pieces, plans for mods, pieces, or mods?
---
I think plans for light combat armor pieces are free states quest rewards.
---
and jet pack i see.
---
Ah, thanks for the heads up. I've been wanting to use some of the mods like Perk Loadout Manager but was too scared.
---
Well people say this patch reintroduced duping so now they‚Äôll get all the AA, Bloodied and Instigating instead. But I hope this is just a rumor that will be shut down.
---
I‚Äôve never seen the BoS Plans. I unlocked arms early game, and Monday unlocked legs on scrapping. But for some reason, I can‚Äôt craft them 
---
We can't make mods to fix the problems, we in fact tried to do exactly that, part of the "Engine" is specifically server side and when the local and server clients don't match bad things happen. (We can't help ourselves but to try.)   
---
People might complain, but can the outcry be worse than what they are currently facing?  
---
And really, if something is freely offered, as long as credit is given, can it be stolen?
---
I would much rather farm caps than server hop 50+ times for a plan. 
---
Was there some major change to item weights, or were some bulk or stacked items removed? 
---
When I logged out at night on the 29th I had a full 600/600 stash and my character was at over 240 (my encumbrance limit), but when I logged in the evening of the 30th my stash was at 477/600 and I had only 196 on my character. 
---
I couldn‚Äôt find anything obviously missing other than having about half as much steel and wood as I thought I‚Äôd had, but I didn‚Äôt document it so could be wrong.
---
Also, I saw zero loot spawns in my first post-patch play session, but loot showed up in usual locations this morning so maybe they‚Äôve extended the respawn timer?
---
Couldn‚Äôt find the above in patch notes.
---
This aged well.
---
Big oof
---
Been doin this all week with a crew. It‚Äôs been fun.
---
üòÇüòÇü§£ü§£üòÖüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£ you are my new best friend. You did forget they are warm with the stylish jacket!ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
I thought so too, but after Battlefront 2 and Destiny 2, I swore I'd wait for Anthem, meaning no preorders and research after release. After seeing the demo streamed, I am pretty unimpressed. So I will be waiting until after the first few patches to see what that community thinks. Same with Division 2. 
---
I've learnt my lessons, and am not interested in paying to be a beta tester anymore. 
---
When I have the stranger in numbers card equipped and I'm not on a team my mutations only have the neg affect.  Doesn't just happen to me. [PS4] 
---
If every other online RPG game works that way. the only thing that it proves is that they are poorly designed. 
---
Gonna be hard to recover from this one. How many times can you trip over your own feet before people stop helping you back up?
---
That‚Äôs funny. Does this orb move around and take actions?
---
Same here. I haven‚Äôt built anything in this game except the basics. My camp is like 5 wooden floors, armor/weapon/chem/tinker work benches, a PA station, a bed, a guitar, a stash box, and a light pole so that I can see at night. Building in this game just feels weird.
---
Ya its only what every other game does. Such a simple piece of logic
---
üôèüèª
---
But that's literally an impossible task. If one player can have the power of "4", then those same 4 players can have the power of 16.
---
You can't have weapons openly available, and have it both ways.
---
I appreciate the extra effort, but that still doesn‚Äôt explain it. Loose mods I get - those are random and I can tell they change from server to server.
---
However the combat armor mod *plans* are not showing in the plan list for anyone over a large amount of hops.
---
I know it‚Äôs not your problem but they don‚Äôt actually address the combat armor mod *plans* that, as of yet, no one has found on any vendor or through any other method since the update. 
---
You can express your opinion without being a condescending asshole towards other people.
---
Well, Fallout survived Interplay. But eventually most game series are to be expected to fade away, just like any other things in entertainment. Only things like Super Mario has chance to live forever.
---
There is much more to it....your only seeing one thing.
---
You are a gentleman and a scholar.
---
So happy to hear bulk crafting will be fixed and wasn‚Äôt a gameplay change: in the current state, crafting tables ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù away from a camp or other stash access point are useless since you can‚Äôt get to your materials.
---
This would have been a good idea. Can't believe they didn't actually do this 
---
This is exactly how I have felt since the beginning.
---
I mean I would have probably used a different example but it's all the same.
---
Scorched are never legendary... atleast I havent seen one. 
---
They've heard of you. You're the mothman to them.
---
Many of us either can't get on due to introduced instability, or in my case, I can't buy/sell/trade/loot on any of my accounts because I'm an old school MMO vet with "Mules" and it turns out after a certain threshold on the account (or so it seems) even your non-encumbered characters get locked down.
---
and now the card reads incorrect as well. 
---
that's not going to cause any confusion/s
---
Post Patch 5 issue:  All chest armor displaying on the outside of premium outfit Nuka-Girl.  I posted on Twitter with a picture. [https://imgur.com/sXTm023](https://imgur.com/sXTm023)
---
You'll notice that the patch notes for the 29th also apparently fixed a bug where you could dupe items through the Whitesprings vendor terminals (it's under the Items tab). 
---
So yeah, they fixed *one* of the duping glitches. Sorry, now two. 
---
Have they fixed ap regen items to stack with either of those cards yet? -_-
---
I had Legs yesterday, but today there wasn't any Heavy Combat anything in Watoga or Harper's Ferry.  Not even a (Known) Heavy Combat Legs which I picked up yesterday :/
---
Seems the Heavy Combat Armors aren't guaranteed or set plans in these vendors...
---
What have we learn in Bethesda? When they tell you to pre-order, don't pre order and buy the game when it is already bug free or less bug. Pre-order players are like buying their game to test the game so that they can fix the bugs. Pre-order player are like Bethesda employee that test the game first before releasing the game to the market but you the consumer pay Bethesda. When they tell to buy this stuff, don't buy that stuff until someone bought it first to review or a youtube review.
---
That's not how reverse engineering  works, you need a modded weapon to learn a mod it may have usually 
---
How was he indestructible? It says post removed
---
Sounds fun..
---
1 - PC (although as I understand it it effects all platforms)
---
2 - Jamion
---
3 - N/A
---
4 -  For mutants this bug has been known since the game came out . Grounded reduces the damage from Energy Weapons by 50% (this includes the Gauss Rifle which doesn't do Energy Damage) fine, but Class Freak perk is supposed to reduce this effect by 75%, (which would be 12%) and *sometimes* it SAYS that it does, but if you run the number your damage is **ALWAYS reduced by 50%!** The perk effects every other mutation, but does NOT work on Grounded. 
---
5 - N/A Known Bug
---
My TS lost power, but the majority of my damage comes from Perks, not the TS aspect.
---
Gun isn't a TSE so I don't miss the explosive part, either. I lost some damage, but not much.
---
Bud I've been getting dowvoted as well for having a poor opinion of the patches in the past, its just the nature of this sub. If anything I think this is a sign that they REALLY made some mistakes that the usual defenders are agreeing that there are some big issues at play. 
---
The reports of being banned for ENB's and similar mods were more or less debunked.  
---
Again I'm not a lawyer, but thousands of people are using many of the mods without any issues / response from Bethesda.
---
I think you're role-playing the raider tag a bit too hard buddy.
---
Melee has always been OP. Fell in love with my first power fist. 
---
Guns didn‚Äôt get weaker. Only specific type. Everything else is the same strength
---
Trolls will tell you ‚Äúit‚Äôs only 15 so and so it‚Äôs nothing.‚Äù Cool but, it‚Äôs also pay to win no matter how minuscule you feel it is, it‚Äôs still pay money get bonus plain and simple. 
---
LMAO sounds like you‚Äôre a lying duper. Even if not, picking up duped items is just as bad for instability as duping itself. Bye Felicia!
---
Not to me i dump ammo often as I dont use it and have way too much. Lately I jus dont pick it up as I use two calibers 
---
I guess you‚Äôd‚Äôve spelled it ‚ÄúI‚Äôd‚Äôve‚Äù, right?
---
Seriously, you can‚Äôt adapt to a survival type game where you have to decide what to carry instead of being able to hoard everything?   I can‚Äôt imagine needing (or wanting for that matter) 100,000 pounds of gear.  I guess you won‚Äôt be playing anything at all in the future because you can‚Äôt do what you want and are forced by the game maker to follow their rules.  SMH. 
---
The super mutants in West Tec were charging hundreds of runs through their lair.  The ghouls in the Whitespring were even stingier.
---
They are going to add DLC that are Free early this year so that's not really an issue since they are working on it.
---
&gt;  I can't help think it's a case of throwing their toys out their pram because they can no longer 1shot everything..babies. 
---
There's no question of this. 
---
Suddenly these same people are acknowledging problems with the game that I was down voted to hell for even mentioning. 
---
This[thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alici1/a_post_addressed_to_those_that_believe_all_the/efexrbe/?context=3) is an example.  He rages about the TSE nerf, then includes a swipe at Bethesda for nerfing the legendary drops and he's getting up voted to infinity. 
---
Well, how odd. 
---
When I complained about legendary drops before the stash, I was basically told to shut up and it wasn't a problem. 
---
Now that TSE has been nerfed, it's a big issue all of a sudden.
---
Restart
---
&gt; you don‚Äôt own the game and if you break the TOS a company can discontinue your licensing rights across the board.
---
A TOS agreement has no legal ground. It's only used to scare people.
---
It's absolutely insane that we are at a point where people like you are defending obvious anti-consumer and more than likely illegal behavior.
---
If you hang around the vault you'll still see new players regularly. One person I've played with a  bit only started two weeks ago. They're still coming, no doubt, but it has lessened.
---
Fallout 76 had been in the top 20 for hours played on True Achievements weekly chart since release, top 10 through December, and bouncing around 14-17 the last four weeks. This week it dropped off the list for the first time, we'll see if it comes back or not, but hours played on Xbox are down a bit over time.
---
Grognak axes ONLY drop as legendaries. There is no other way to obtain them.
---
thanks for the heads up, that was fun!  (D1RTY HaVok)

Duping is still happening
---
Also if you have strange in numbers try equipping and then removing that perk.  I had issues with that perk equipped when I wasn‚Äôt in a group causing marsupial not to work
---
People say that all the time on gaming forums, but it never holds any water. Just because hardcore communities online are upset, doesn't mean that the armies of 9 year olds aren't going to pre-order the next hyped up AAA game. It's the oldest trope in the industry.
---
See ya later, come back one day
---
I rented the game for a day and in that one day I experienced over a dozen crashes. I played for approximately 8 hours (not counting load time or the crashes) and I think after the first 2 hours I was already bored. Nothing about this game said this was next level Fallout especially the ‚Äúonline experience.‚Äù  Another big gripe was the real time VATS. This was just not the Fallout that I wanted and just seemed like a cheap crash grab for Bethesda. 
---
Good UNINSTALL
---
How would it break the quest lore, considering the fact that the overseer was sent out to secure the **MISSILE SILOS*** (that can mean more than 3!) And elitism? Seriously? You bringing up that when the ideology of the Enclave is basically that? Is a nuclear silo that launches the **same type of nuke** and gives you a few more caps breeding toxicity and hate? No. Its not. 
---
Server hop
---
I'd like to add, what happened to transparency in the notes? Was the increased hunger and degradation of weapons planned or unintentional? I sure a sh!t hope it was unintentional cuz if it wasn't then I'd say what in the heck is wrong with you people? Its bad enough as it is so stop making it worse!
---
Exactly, it‚Äôs the principle behind it. Never said it was anything game breaking.
---
So where is the win for bethesda then really?
---
thank you, you are quite right, i got 3 mini nukes as a reward. i'll drop these and get underway. 
---
‚ÄúI'm about to just go back to 4.‚Äù
---
That‚Äôs good because there‚Äôs another settlement that needs your help.
---
that makes sense. thank you.
---
I think it's like when u drop items and bag does not appear it is the worst..I always stash my junk now
---
Re: Plan availability.  I am level 47 and I am unable to access any decent plans anywhere. I rarely pick up any decent armour or guns as loot which are near my level. We should be able to find or make power armour mods for the armour we are wearing or are about to be wearing.  Do you have to finish the game before you get anything decent? If so, what's the point of that?  None of the Traders I have found have decent plans but I gather I won't be able to afford them anyway. 
---
no problem. Good to hear you fixed the issue :)
---
There sir I cannot help you 
---
I still cannot defeat the MISC Kill the unruly Golfers at white-springs quest. I've server hopped so many times, and it will not spawn for me at all. 
---
Yep, people defending the logic behind it will say it‚Äôs such an insignificant amount, which is agreeable. But the down right principal of it, on paper, is pay to win.
---
Good luck finding a lawyer to take your $60 case...
---
I got one today. Wasnt impressed but it was a 1 star
---
TSE shotty, marsupial, power armor. Boooorrriing! No originality. Weak!
---
I'm rocking a sneak vats crit gunslinger with a tux, chameleon armor, and a personally made suppressed 10mm handgun...
---
Which I have a hard time using due to lack of springs after 23 shots.
---
Boooorrriing!
---
Go collect some springs, bro. Quiet down.
---
Xbox
---
This is true, previously first shot would crit then all shots after would build your meter back up.
---
Now first shot crits and then all the rest leave the meter empty.
---
You then have to vats a second time to generate more critical.
---
I'm not seeing any of that and if it did roll back why are fusion cores still 8 an hour at the powerplants ( checked today 15 min netted 2) I would check this because I've yet to get a bunch of legendary weapons at whitesprings and it's been nuked 3 times. So I am not seeing that kind of roll back other than the bobby pins everything looks spot on, acid can't be bulked in 10s and unbulked in 15s my power cores aren't refilling when I log in so I believe you may in fact be wrong about a roll back.
---
There wasn‚Äôt one. I know a duper on my friend list messaged me and said he was till duping even fast now after patch.
---
Dear.... All those responses... You guys are kicking into overdrive!! Thanks for the continued responses to us!!
---
I haven't been able to log in since the patch, i either CTD on hitting play, or if i try and join someone from social menu i get a frozen loading screen upon 'joining world' screen. Hopefully this'll fix that too.
---
Part of that sounds cool but a few of the rules you made up sound really weird. Like the nearby player losing a stimpack or caps? Great, can't wait for the death griefers running around dying and draining everyone's caps.
---
Dear *******
---
Your request for: Can we please have more fishing hat variations? I like to RP fishing while not being able to actually fish.
---
Also, I‚Äôd really enjoy a Gatling laser skin so that the shining 2 seconds of use I get out of it before breaking, are stunning and memorable.: Has been passed on to our coding team. After many many seconds of deliberation we have decided that we will absolutely add more fishing hat variations to the Atom Shop. 
---
You can expect to see continual updates of the content solely in the atom shop. We have read from the sacred corn shit text and have discerned that adding items to the Atom Shop actually constitutes adding content to the game. 
---
As a show of our appreciation to you and all of the rest of our loyal fans we have silently raised the weight of Bobby pins back up to its originally coded weight. We have accomplished this amazing feat by rolling back the game to a prior state, thereby silently bringing back most of the old exploits that were plaguing the game prior. 
---
We are extremely happy to see the community‚Äôs overwhelmingly positive response to the latest patch and promise to continually rain down steaming feces upon all of our loyal fans. 
---
Loading over all of you with much contempt, Bethesda 
---
Due to some of the lighting errors, Tse outrage and glowing deathclaw, I can with certainty say that is definitely is Maybelline 
---
Yeah, but you aren't getting paid. Unless your mod is infested with viruses or is absurdly messed up and corrupts saves and stuff, No one can really complain. I mean, it's free.
---
Someone call the whinebulanceeee
---
They can be legendary, but they are a pretty rare sight.
---
Yeah, as much as I hate to admit it... I think you're right.
---
This is a good question because if you don't particularly hit an enemy directly the 'explosive' part can ricochet and I know that is not giving the same DPS as a direct hit
---
I don't believe you. I'd rather trust bethesda to someone claiming that he'd been muling for 100 people and picking up heaps of duped items and still calling himself innocent
---
I didn‚Äôt say rollback, I said they patched the wrong version. They didn‚Äôt patch the most recent version they patched an older version and that‚Äôs what we got.
---
Again, it's probably because the Bobby Pin weight got massively reduced...at least for your inventory. Not sure about your Stash weight.
---
So much for my limited server hoping knowledge for lead. 
---
Well that's just not true is it, it's the legendary effects that make it more powerful and Fatman's can have legendary effects too.
---
Give me one melee weapon that has base damage higher than Fatman base damage.
---
100% deserved. 
---
Finally Bethesda is doing something right
---
Or maybe you could learn what you‚Äôre talking about before making wildly inaccurate claims.
---
You said that a vac ban bans you from all valve multiplayer games, then linked the valve support forum as ‚Äòproof‚Äô.
---
Here‚Äôs what the support forum actually says on the matter:
---
*What games can I play if I have been VAC banned?
---
VAC banned accounts can still play single-player games, local LAN games, and multiplayer on non VAC-secured game servers. To find non VAC-secured servers, from the Steam main menu click on View, select Servers, then select Not secure in the Anti-cheat dropdown.
---
Cheating in one of the following Source games or a Source mod will result in a VAC ban for all games in the list below:
---
Counter-Strike: Source
---
Half-Life 2: Deathmatch
---
Day of Defeat: Source
---
Team Fortress 2
---
Similarly, cheating in one of the following Gold Source games will result in a VAC ban for all games in the list below:
---
Counter-Strike
---
Condition Zero
---
Ricochet
---
Day of Defeat
---
Team Fortress Classic
---
Half-Life: Deathmatch
---
Deathmatch Classic*
---
Man, that list seems to be missing a few key valve games, don‚Äôt it? You claimed that a VAC ban bans you from all valve multiplayer games, so shouldn‚Äôt it be ALL of their games?
---
Here‚Äôs a few big ones missing from that list:
---
Counter strike, Global offensive
---
Dota 2
---
Garry‚Äôs mod
---
Artifact
---
(Note how this list includes valves 2 biggest games, dota 2 and cs:go)
---
So it seems like YOU were the one wrong here! Maybe you should do a bit of research before trying to correct someone, eh? :)
---
Oh no the overpowered weapons got nerfed, boohoo
---
I mean I have nuked over 5 locations with scorched with my friends and forced respawns and they were never legendary. Dont believe it till I see a picture. 
---
No! Something in the game, something, anything, must go un nerfed. Leave the glorious beast be. We shall all exit this game knowing this majestic bullet sponge bat dragon monster has kept it's shit in tact.
---
I'll be honest, you might want to stick with Fallout 4 modding. Fallout 76 is going nowhere. Also, if Fallout 4 is your first, try Skyrim. It's a little dated but still very much enjoyable today.
---
_Thanks for subscribing to Cat Facts!  You will not receive fun daily facts about CATS!  &gt;o&lt;_
---
Had I more caps I'd make a service shop. Come to the shop and I'd fix you up. Set a price per part and with or without resources to do it. I'd gladly pay caps to fully mod a suit.
---
LOL!
---
That's some hall monitor permission slip bullshit.  
---
Sorry but seeing Fallout 76 for what it was and still is doesn't make somebody any less of a fan of the franchise ... like at all.   
---
Reviews were horrible, player feedback was horrible, Bethesda's response was horrible and their handling of the IP is horrible. Sorry but it didn't take me 60$ and 250 hours to figure out that this game is trash.
---
Well I‚Äôm trying to change my build but I‚Äôm kinda stuck cause NOTHING DOES MORE THAN 75 DMG
---
It would break the questline lore in that the Overseer already has covered the existing silos.  She has stashes and holotapes are each one.  Adding a fourth out of the blue would require explanations and recording new voice lines.  It would contradict existing playthroughs that have already made it through each silo.  
---
As for Player Elitism, not ingame prejudices, yes...  it's toxic and it pervades a great many Online Games that cave in and create "Hard Mode" content.  I could give a shit about the Enclave being elitist as that's their role in the setting and story; but I do give a shit about players being douches to each other and putting on airs over a goddamned game.  You can claim it won't, but the legacy of every MMO that follows that pattern has created that division and toxicity amongst their playerbase.
---
I can only imagine what a beast a game like this is to code. I‚Äôm surprised it runs as well as it does. Hopefully when all the bugs are ironed out, increasing server stability substantially, they‚Äôll fill it up.
---
If you needed pre-nerf TSEs to kill level 23 scorched, I don't think there's anything anybody here can do to help you
---
No shit, it‚Äôs a garbage ass game that isn‚Äôt worth even being free to play. It‚Äôs a marketing scam and the company needs to be fucking liable for FTC violations honestly 
---
What build did you have?
---
I know I know, it's just annoying getting spammed and not being able to do anything, not even see, when ever I encounter one...
---
Works for me 
---
Free to play within a few months. 
---
Do you PvP? I think this is what ruined it
---
There are ways outside of those perks to increase your lock pick skill and doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean we will see level four locks. Maybe. Maybe not.
---
Less player base hurts a game, you can't act like it doesn't matter. I'm not one of them, I'll still play till something else I like comes out, it's just all this don't the door hit you on your way out crap is cringe. 
---
One possibility is that they're an inept gaming studio that had no idea how much the mod community was propping up its sales until they actually had to start patching things themselves.
---
Well they were the only weapons I used so
---
The vendor in whitesprings who only sells armor and nothing else
---
Why are you gatekeeping in the first place? They‚Äôre just gonna die to the 50s. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre actually going to ruin it.
---
Yeah no doubt.  Even at their core, Fallout 76 and ESO are completely different games.  Fallout 76 would have needed to have a completely different game engine to even run similar to ESO.
---
So you can fine tune?...
---
So I took an addictol and it fixed the SPECIAL point reduction...but a chem addiction wasn't listed anywhere and it didnt even notify me I'm no longer addicted. Same thing happened to my teammate. This is something to watch out for...
---
Thanks for the input
---
Agree.  check out OP's post history before he deletes it. He was duping or part of a duping crew, same difference at the end of the day. 
---
It's all about getting in game items off eBay that were created by duping, hence the mega Nerf their sole focus was duplicated TSE and what they did was the best way eliminate the problem on short notice. I'm sure Bethesda wants some micro transaction money and that very well may be the catalyst but I'm sure balance is coming.
---
Wild concept right?
---
No, I only carry 6-10 and had only 10 in my stash precisely because they used to be so heavy. And besides, in this patch bobby pin weight was _increased_ so even if that were the case it would have been the other way around.
---
This, this is what I'm hoping they will start taking advantage of.   
---
How many more issues would have been fixed if they'd let us help with the "little things" (no offense intended, I mean it in the broad brush way).  
---
Pardon if this brushes with hubris, I am far from perfect myself (look at the posts title ffs), but I don't think it's unrealistic to think we have something we can contribute.
---
I really hope they don't mess Anthem up as well, it looks really interesting and the concept is sound
---
A power armor shotgun build so now I‚Äôm either trying to buff explosive to get more dmg on my tse or Meele 
---
The ledge being gone by the pro shop has me upset. But the real practical problem I‚Äôve found is having to break bulk down to scrap to be able to repair anything. I‚Äôve spent 3 hours tonight trying to repair all my weapons and armor that got trashed this morning because my lvl 54 character is now weak as hell. 
---
What the fuck does "restructor" mean?
---
Do you even english bro?
---
Do you guys remember when Bethesda paid Ninja and Rick &amp; Morty to stream this dumpster fire together?
---
Fallout 76 is basically the Fyre Festival of the video game world. 
---
It depends how many fanboys stick by the game regardless of how shit it is.
---
I know I hate it when that shit happens to me. That's the exact reason why whenever I go to fight a SBQ I go up to everyone there and ask for a team untilnatoeast someone accepts.
---
Cap stashes are not actually searchable with Cap Collector, making it utterly useless right now.
---
This made me laugh out loud. I shall spell it out to add emphasis.
---
You, sir. You.
---
Fortunately I have a good sniper build going, but fuck, the game is boring as hell at this point. Silos don't work half the time, I have to dashboard because I freeze after the 2nd loading screen, and theres not much left to do at this point. 
---
Damn bro you must be wearing a dense combat armor helmet.
---
Man.. I live under a bridge and currently there is a planter stuck in the road.. my benches and all just kept going up to the top of the street :( but it's been this way since beta so I am not holding my breath on a fix anytime soon..
---
I was happily married but then Todd came and seduced my wife, utterly cuckolding me :( plz Bethesda, make this game easier by quadrupling the damage output of all guns and making infinite resources and durability :) :)
---
While this made me laugh I have to say I was a big defender for a long time. One of my fist posts in this subreddit was how I hope they knocked it out of the park and everyone who was talking shit would eat their words. I've been let down almost weekly by Bethesda and I've said nothing and I've defended them. But this has become a pattern of disrespect towards customers. Every week is a new major issue. I've been let down greatly and it truly makes me sad and it hurts me to see this company I love not treat something like fallout and their customers with no respect.
---
Vaults will increase gear level. They won‚Äôt add in vaults though until every duping bug is confirmed to be removed. 
---
Implying people enjoy FA76
---
I think that depends how much you were screwed over on a person to person basis.
---
For the record I AM NOT PROUD.  I bought the power armour edition. I wanted the display of the helmet AND I wanted to support a franchise that I truly love to play in. I paid a hefty price.. I got jilted on the promised items. I‚Äôm still getting jilted on the promised compensation. But on top of that... my version was being shipped in. It was held up 2 weeks thanks to mail strikes. I wanted to play with my friends at launch, so I ALSO bought digital, with plans to just sell the disc. 
---
....I paid twice. ...for this. And then they dropped the price. Now I couldn‚Äôt sell the disc if I tried. As I said, I‚Äôm not proud of the foolish faith I had that I would love this game, or trust in its production. I was an idiot, and I (quite literally) paid for it. 
---
But that‚Äôs my point. I will never forget this consistent betrayal, and it absolutely will influence any future purchases, no matter how fancy the promised bonuses are.  Ironically enough, the stupid helmet is the only thing that hasn‚Äôt been a complete disappointment. Too bad it‚Äôs also a permanent reminder that everything else is.
---
I never use pistols so I didn't know this. That is super weird though! So are they instead effected by the full auto rifle perks? 
---
Good idea, hopefully someone does the same for Xbox.
---
Oh there is loads that could have been done better
---
I keep telling people that 76 is being handled by BGS Austin (a new team that has never released a game before) but no one seems to care or pay attention
---
Well the in game stuff the marketing shit is coming from Bethesda softworks and people need to be fired or something
---
Personally I don't think it's a very useful mutation at all. Maybe if you could get a full set of good weightless armor. I don't know. A single piece of chameleon armor is better, particularly in pvp, as firing a weapon doesn't break it.
---
What other AAA games do you have in mind? My personal experience with 76, on a high-end PC, was equally or less glitchy than other releases.
---
I've played console in the past, Xbox mainly, but it's been a pretty constant upward trend in overall quality even considering that.
---
I remember when FONV corrupted my save multiple times in a row, I remember one of the Spyro games having hard crashes everywhere, etc.
---
As for modern games, sitting there counting the various glitches they all come with is an exercise in futility.
---
From what I'm hearing though, it just sounds like the console version is fucked. I personally wouldn't expect a game of anything close to this scale to work properly on consoles though, but I don't deny if they're selling there it should work.
---
Someone already volunteered, in this very thread. 
---
No you have too keep playing so you feel invested enough to buy atoms /s
---
Why cant you launch your own nuke?
---
If your on pvp patiance is a must.  Wait, and wait and keep waiting until they approach your location. Then attack from stealth, they panic and can't see you. If its pve... Well it's OK but hasn't really stopped me from. Charging in using vats and killing stuff. 
---
I'm torn. Those crazy barrages are the only think i fear.
---
Sb's that don't spam go down so easily.
---
But i have experienced 30 sec to a min of heavy sustained fire which feels so hopeless. You either run, die or stim repeatedly till you run or die.
---
Fireproof helps of course but it's so blinding
---
Not for game devs, typically business application programmers make about 20k or so more than game dev in my experience
---
He probably read the first line only and came to the conclusion he cheated lol.
---
Idk how Bethesda didn‚Äôt consider this. It‚Äôs like they assumed everyone used TSE or everyone was a duper and just said ‚Äúsee these people? Fuck these people ‚Äú
---
Why didn't u complete your title 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing this if you‚Äôre ever going to build a camp again. Every time you tame a pet, you permanently lose 10% of your camp budget 
---
Not seeing what's happening is the best feature they've included in the game.
---
So, I'm assuming by this you mean that you killed people in PVP you suspected to be dupers and took their dropped junk items?
---
I'm still not sure why this is wrong. As in, what would the *right* thing to do? Not kill dupers? Let them have their shit back if you do? Drop it all in a fissure site somewhere?
---
Maybe it's the intent of why you did it that matters, like greed vs justice? I'm honestly asking what people think would be the right thing to do and what would be a fair punishment.
---
If they patched an older version with the newest patch it would have the all the old bigs and glitches unless specifically patched out for that version .... IE double if not triple the work of a standard patch you can't just copy paste. What is your source? If you don't mind me asking.
---
But, like...you do realize that other weapons can one shot them, right? You don't even need a specialized build. I have exactly 0 perks invested into melee and I can take out level 68 super mutant warlords with a cultist's dagger I have sitting around pretty easily. Weaker enemies like scorched are even easier. If you get yourself a level 50 combat rifle with no mods or ranged perks, you can still go through any of the end-game dungeons.
---
Oh, true. I don't know then as things went fucky.
---
Nyooom 
---
Yeah, the damage and logic of some weapons is annoyingly hilarious. My axe is more devastating than three whole clips(?) From a laser gatling gun
---
Oh should have mentioned that before, already have a full set
---
Just open legitimate communication. Patch notes are a pitiful excuse for this ridiculous mess
---
You can just scrap level 1 leather armor to get mods. I have 13 INT, with Scrapper perk, took me about 100 to get studded for my deep pocketed heavy leather build I only lost 1 steel per item. Pain in the ass though...
---
in which case their voice would be heard more at the Bethesda forums
---
Would love to some other time 
---
To be fair, they *also* said that for every toy i carry on my inventory I get a rad resist bonus...
---
Oddly enough, the gunslinger perk affected my full auto 10mm pistol on my alt
---
Yep. Screw 'em.
---
Nope. ...and healing factor does nothing while in combat,  not supposed to.  If you are wanted,  the game maybe considering you constantly in combat 
---
*[Bethesda laughing in money]*
---
Sorry duper, looks like you got rammed in the @#$%^&amp;.
---
Bloodied on a strong melee is significantly stronger than anything a Fatman can dish out.
---
Ik my perks weren‚Äôt all tse it was a shotgun power armor build but now I gotta fuck it all up to do any kind of dmg for high lvl enemies 
---
They've dug themselves into a pit. I will never buy another game from them.
---
I really hope vaults aren't just nuke silos with different assets. They could be a fantastic addition to the game, but I'm fearful from the little bit that was datamined and glimpsed by people glitching into them.
---
Oh really, never thought of it like that.
---
Amen to that.
---
You shouldn't have been banned.  That was total bullshit.
---
I never said people aren't being overdramatic. I am just saying a lot of people are in the right to be emotional or angry about this. This is a game people wanted and a lot of people felt wronged and lied too. Companies do need to be held accountable for the product they release.
---
[I don't think kind words work anymore.](https://i.imgur.com/8ejT3Cv.jpg)
---
Sometimes you just have to hit the ground hard to come to senses again.
---
You ask this question like you think Bethesda has any kind of plan whatsoever.
---
Optimistic, but hopelessly naive.
---
Like the post says, this is my last cry into the void before I close this door and return to FO4.  
---
'76 has allot of promise, people love to hate, but there is a core here that is really good, that in my own opinion (and it seems from the Upvotes other agree) is worth trying to save.  
---
Can Bethesda/Zenimax save it without us?  
---
It would be arrogant to think otherwise, of course they can, but I think they could do it better, and faster, by working with the community, instead of shutting us out.
---
Scotland proud !!!!!!!!
---
I've also crafted in past like dozens of learther armor at a time just to make sure I got all mods. About less than week ago I crafted 31 marine tactical helmets plus whatever extra I got from super duper. ( I remember this exact as I had that much of glass, which was the limiting resource and I burned it all)
---
When unlocking mods I've crafted and scrapped like 5-10 weapons at a time. Sometimes in past I've even started to get that server not responging message, possibly getting disconnected later. Since then I've become more careful with that.
---
It's very possibly they've made some kind of limit that can get triggered, and that might have been set fairly low. It might even be set to observe only some items.
---
o.O I'm not sure you're watching the right footage...  I did point you to the footage where he's actually NOT violating the TOS for over 200 hours right??
---
Yeah I snagged that sucker fast. Though I will miss my triple windmills
---
Cool, this Mistress is all set then. Although, the Shroud is pretty cool....
---
A good number of people just had their builds ruined by the myriad of nerfs this patch introduced, it isn't a coincidence at all, its directly related lol the majority arn't "salty dupers" though, just people getting fed up. 
---
Good luck with the random stranger on the internet taking your case.  
---
So the new patch hasn't fucked up the nuke launch at least.  Good. I was really wondering. 
---
So many comments to upvote!
---
It‚Äôs 20 hours from the first time you sell after they reset. So this actually helps if you play around the same time. 
---
If you sell to a vendor at 10pm it will reset at 6pm the next day. 
---
If you‚Äôre really trying to clean out all seven every day, it may be useful to keep track of what time you sold to each. Hope that helps! 
---
I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs it
---
Lies. Burn the heretic! Kill the mutant!
---
Springs gathering simulator.
---
Just go get some springs, bro. Jesus. How do you think people repair guns in real life? They dig through the trash and fix their guns with shit gathered from battered clipboards and office fans. Be cool man.
---
Unfortunately, yes. But I have noticed that it can be purchased now. Apparently all Vendor's have dedicated Plans they sell now, but it's all Level Locked and 'by chance'.
---
Yeah Ik, but this game is already failing and I already got all the fun I wanted out of it. What‚Äôs funny is that they changed the ban from 3 days to perm only after the incident gained traction. It‚Äôs almost like they were trying to make them selves look better...
---
Cards should be able to have stars pulled off at will and put back into your level up bank. 
---
I had level 3 makeshift warrior. I wanted a level 2 version. 
---
I bought a new card. In order to raise that to a level 2, I first had to use 2 level ups to max out the first card to 5 and then use 2 more to get a level 2 version. 
---
I wish you could just undo stars and reinvest elsewhere. 
---
To be fair it took them a year
---
That's like saying, "Don't call a lawyer... if your accused of a crime you didn't commit."
---
I think the reason isnt cookie cutter responses. It seems as if they are getting told of the same issue and reply like that. Also they're aren't all cookie cutter responses. About 4 or 5 says thanks I'll pass it along. But the majority are asking what platform, or when was this experienced.
---
This may be hard to believe but some answer do warrant only a thanks for letting me know I'll pass it along. 
---
Like what the fuck are they supposed to say when 1000 people say that the bobby pins weigh too much again. The CM cant fix it all the can do is relay that info. The dev team cant sit here and browse through the subreddit and find the issues people are complaining about. 
---
Once again I'll reiterate all this person is doing is playing damage control for the people who let this patch go live. So being mad that this person is overwhelmed by negative feedback is just gonna make them feel worse. 
---
Imagine not being the cause of a problem (and even trying to help expedite a solution) and being told you dont need to be in that position because theres too many problems to reply to them all. 
---
Fuck who ever let this shit go live. It was a pretty easy catch it seems like on our end. I dont know. This patch should have waited. It had great QOL updates but was just overshadowed by the negative. 
---
That's your right as a consumer, and a free citizen of what ever country is your home.   
---
I feel allot of salt as well, read my post history from the last few days, but I'm making the choice to try once more before I tap out, pack up my toys and go home.  
---
I was getting screwed by SB weeks ago, but got a full zealots armour and fireproof 3, now they do no damage at all. I put up a camp right by a fissure and farm dem bitches like corn.
---
For mule best to have perks to reduce weights, and use unyielding gear to boost strenght.
---
&gt;i was thinking about that, if i ever wanted a mule, you could just get all the weight reduction perks, and 5 armor pieces with [decrease weight of weapons and ammo by %] or [decrease weight of food and drink by %] and the 1500 weight limit would fit thousands more items
---
Full perks don't stack with the armor reductions. Only weapon weight reductions can be used on top of full weight reduction perks.
---
Dear ******** 
---
You are absolutely welcome. Here at Bethesda studios we aim to please...ourselves. We are happy to hear that you will be quitting the game as the sooner people quit the sooner we have met our obligation to provide free DLC as long as people keep playing. 
---
That's how it is, though, it seems. Aesthetics vs Practicality.
---
I see your point. I apologize for my lashing out of anger at you. My fault completely.
---
I wasn't speaking specifically about your buddy, just pointing out the fact that they don't need a _smoking gun_ to ban your for duping.  Common sense is an adequate subsitute when the quantities defy basic math.
---
Yeah I been scrapping away but nothing yet. I managed to buy leg and arm mods but not chest. Since vendor changes figured someone might know where the can be brought
---
Modders can't save FO76 IMO. Nothing to do with skill or abilities, but modding is simply too limited on it at the time. Textures and sorting mods are great, but they cant make a broken game fixed. Unless they release community servers, modding can't fix this.
---
Also, I don't hate the game, I played it a decent bit, but I just grew bored and frustrated. I have 1400 hours in fallout 4 and didn't even break 100 in 76.
---
ahh, the good ol' barking hellfire! 
---
I‚Äôve noticed that Carnivore has stopped preventing the mutation I added after from working. That was a surprise when Unstable Isotope proc‚Äôed! 
---
Damn near 30 below zero here.  My weather sucks as bad as this patch does.
---
That explains it :)
---
modders have made bethesda games absolutely amazing for years.  bethesda open sourcing their games has made this possible.  
---
I do actually beleive this to be true, imo 100% an elder scrolls game will be online and not in mmo fashion (i played teso beta, biggest let down was that arrows and ranged attack had no travel time, didnt play like normal tes).  which is good.  1000 servers with 25 players each is better than 10 servers with 2500 each.  guessing it will land somewhere inbetween.
---
honestly tho, the potential for that is almost infinite.  TES will always be the flagship, has fallout has become the beta?
---
I love it when i do a run of whitesprings...see about 4 in the club house..some of which are 3 star..and absolutely none of them drop any loot
---
Put aside all the bugs, glitches, and what ever else is wrong with the game.  
---
If you only wanted a co-op or solo game then you shouldn‚Äôt have bought a game advertised from the start as a online all the time with 23 other people.  
---
SAASES?
---
Let‚Äôs never just say ‚Äúmultiplayer‚Äù.  Let‚Äôs always distinguish between **fallout with strangers** (possibly shown to be a mistake) and **fallout with friends** (not shown to be a mistake at all by any means, which I think your postscript agrees with).
---
I‚Äôd love to hear an update on private servers and community mods and their level of eventual commitment to those, since those would immediately cure some of your complaints and could potentially cure the rest.
---
You dont own anything on your account.  You own a license to use the software.  That's it.
---
Do you know if the serum recipes are still rng when trying to actually get one?
---
Translation: I haven't played since beta
---
\*fires TS MIRV Fatman.
---
\*dies because blast zone is 8km wide!
---
Personally I think there are probably more useful types of armor. I'm really not sure how useful it is. I guess I don't really understand the point of it, outside of pvp. Then a piece of chameleon armor seems better to me. What do you think about it?
---
You do know what base damage is right ?
---
Bloodied Fatman would shit all over a bloodied melee
---
The community really appreciates your time and efforts.  Assuming you guys are professional coders in real life, you HAVE to know why Bethesda CAN'T acknowledge/respond/utilize your fixes, right??!?  For Creative Commons practices it's one thing, but millions paid $40+ for this game, and Bethesda is still trying to make money from the Atom shop.  It puts the creators on a very tenuous stance in regards to future IP rights.  
---
Have you played eso...no..they haven't learned anything there...still.  thats why I'm here...can't disappoint a player with low expectations 
---
Such narrow minded perspective of patch 5 ..... you need to get out there more lmao 
---
Some people (like myself) sometimes don't want to hurt other people's feelings by saying "sorry bud I want to play by myself today and no I don't want to hang out in party chat while we play two different games". Better to not exist in that moment.
---
And that's the crux of it all! You can miss deadlines, give us glitches and errors, heck, even half the mods I used on NV when it first got modded crashed it more for a while!
---
But you aren't expected to do any of this. You could make mods for only yourselves and never publish it too! Thank you all for sharing and caring! Check out the comments on the Nexus and see how constructive criticism actually inspires too! Now, if only Bethesda actually tapped you guys so we could incorporate criticism, and Bethesda could be constructive with it...
---
This seriously sucks, but at least we know their doing something to stop duping (even if it doesn‚Äôt work)
---
It really shows who respects their customers and IPs.
---
Honestly I'm such a casual player its hard enough for me to get to the level to notice much of what you guys are talking about (level 12 got the game for Christmas)  But when I get dropped from the server 3x in a row within a 20 min span...well I'm going to play somthing else in the hour I have before work....... Just sucks I always wanted thjs game to be a multiplayer but more like let your friends come into your world and do your quests
---
and yet, US wearing a helmet is purely cosmetic....
---
I think for people who do nuke runs it gets to be a limited resource.
---
Kind of just a really cool addition to your base camp for show imo. Rarely ever use mine.
---
That's because I rarely use reddit, and I created my account in December, when I posted my 12 days of Bethesda spoof.  - After that, ignored my account until Matthew posted a link on the Discord to this.  So yeah.. shit happens man.  And if you're really paranoid you can always check out my twitch so you can see that we aren't the same person.
---
No. They don‚Äôt want people to quit, who will put the mone-err atoms into the pocket of tod- err i meant atomic shop?
---
Stay strong and ignore the hate.   
---
As a vet of MMO games I'm running three accounts in '76, have grinded my way to the 300's and combined likely have a couple hundred thousand pounds of stuff between all my mules  
---
People just don't understand different play styles, he'll my friends openly mocked me for the first 6 weeks, I was encumbered and walked everywhere, but I loved it.  
---
Let's hope one of the community managers steps in and assists.
---
I‚Äôm a leather armor user myself, I prefer studded because of the higher dmg resist. You going for a sneak build?
---
The Bundys.... I wonder if people know who they are nowadays...
---
Well, before there were times I mapped loaded, ran there to see her drop dead. But in reality, the drops weren't even worth the run to get there if I did get there in time to get credit for the kill. I generally don't bother with her because well, fly around and screech screech screeech is just boring anyway. Dops arent worth the time regardless of how fast or slow she goes down. 
---
I ran all across Harper's ferry like a moron getting shot by all the super mutants in Appalachia looking for the vendor. Does that count?
---
Honestly can't tell you. You still need radaway for nuke zones even if you're using power armor or a hazmat suit, and it still takes your mutations away so it doesn't provide any benefit over radaway. It's far too plentiful even without ever buying/crafting any for it to be a "saving resources" kind of thing. Especially now that it's affected by traveling pharmacy, it's not even a big deal carrying it around.
---
There's a new timer on them. If it's a stash you haven't claimed it should work. I find that swapping in the perk while looking at the container work s nearly every time. 
---
I prefer the new system. I'm constantly getting decent stashes over above 109 
---
Yeah sneak build. Also wanted shadow because it looks cool too
---
Well, looking at upvotes. 3 of us. Like the amount of players who still play H1Z1.
---
Literally nearly every online game at this point has some kind of test server. It boggles my mind that we dont have that with 76...
---
Reduced damage to all weapons. Especially end game weapons. It's a real bummer
---
&gt; I also did take items left in paper bags by dupers as I raided a few of their camps ....
---
You deserve to be banned from all of Bethesda's games, then.
---
I also love the Fallout brand, but MMOs are a whole different animal.
---
For every quitter that leaves, there‚Äôs a new good player who joins so I think we‚Äôll be better off without them. 
---
And none of that stable flux shit either!
---
You want nukes? you gotta go into the zones, risk your hide, sweat it a bit, then you become death, destroyer of Watoga....
---
Well its probably because a lot of players have left the game after the last patch, including a lot of high levels who would drop multiple nukes per day. Or it could be because its a Wednesday night. Either way, the time spent server hopping you could have dropped your own nuke. 
---
Keep these types of posts coming.....make them even louder.....protest is the only way change ever occurs....hurt there pocket
---
Agreed, a lot of the players and members of this community I've come across have been super friendly but the lack of new content and bug fixes in the wrong direction makes it so unbearable to play to where it actually feels somewhat frustrating to play. The most recent patch, not to mention that it was made on an older update, nerfed TSE down to the ground and my PA heavy gunner build is practically ruined.
---
Until they add or fix what the comunity actually wants in the game, I think I'm gonna take a break from the game as well.
---
&gt; A good end game dungeon.
---
Wait a second, you don't enjoy smashing 50 cores, collecting 15 cores, replacing 15 cores?
---
When you spend alot of time in nukezones and at whitesprings, rad aways disappear like crazy. Three glowing ones can completely irradiate you in seconds. I try and keep at least 20 on me at all times but if I dont pay attention, I can run out pretty quickly. Especially with Bethesda deciding the only thing to get buffed this week is Rad Worms.
---
Even Item repairing in Elder Scrolls Online is less of a hassle than in 76.
---
Thank you for this! I've been banging my head for like 45 minutes trying to figure out what was wrong. 
---
No matter whether you actually were duping, or picking up duped items with intention (which you probably were) it seems shitty to just block you from tons of games, that you quite possibly may have spent hundreds of dollars on (or whatever currency you're using). If Bethesda plans to move all of its games from Steam to Bethesda Launcher, then this is going to be one hell of a problem.
---
Please take the time to read the two posts I linked in this thread.   
---
Both prove otherwise.  
---
The first is a fix for one of the major CTD issues plaguing '76 players at the moment.   
---
The other is a list of hundreds of bugs, and in some cases, exactly what needs to be done to fix the problems.  
---
I can't speak for any author or contributors other than myself, but I stand ready to atleast try.
---
thank you. Repeater 4 life !
---
I am grateful for /Ladydevann but I'm still hot about the utter waste laid to my arsenal by the recent nerfs to TSE.....Thank you for being active and responsive I just need you to ask the devs why they didn't go with 50% Nerf instead of 80% &amp; 75%
---
Can't really have much of an interactive world changing story in a world that is shared with other players, that isnt split into instances, and locked off areas, etc.. So it does make sense to have you follow along on an existing predetermined story. 
---
And in saying that, its well told, if u of course dont skip over anything, maybe thats just a generational thing, some of us played games in a time where there was no voice acting, u had to read things or u had no idea what was going on, infact i still do play games like that, not a problem with that style of delivery.
---
I think if you look at your own language it will reveal something. You keep saying "trying to enjoy" You should need to try to enjoy the game. sure you might be a long time fan of fallout, but if youre just trying to enjoy the game because of that fact, the game isnt fun. You shouldnt need to TRY to find fun in a video game.
---
The perk was always designed around using grenades and ordnance, not a single legendary effect. If the ordnance itself was any good (which it isn't at the moment, perk or not), then Demolition Expert would be a good perk for that build.
---
I"m really glad I was able to show you my unique perspective
---
It is more of a ‚Äúthis was a pain in the *** to get but i still got it‚Äù kind of display item in my opinion.
---
At least they ain't Rockstar Games who haven't fixed bugs or the connection issues in over 5 years and never made an effort in the first place to do it
---
No, when you killed a human in melee it would do a unique animation, like stabbing through the neck with a sword
---
&gt; The team is working to identify how this happened so we can prevent this from repeating in the future. 
---
Find the person or people who screwed this up.
---
Fire them.
---
They reversed many of the few good updates they did in this massive dumpster fire update. They could have literally done nothing and it would have been better.
---
wait?! you can actually do that? 
---
...and suffer your own explosive pettiness? 
---
Man, talk about Russian roulette!
---
Everyone's reaction:
---
That's just what a _duper_ would say...
---
Of course they were, the current climate of over the top political correctness means any perceived condonation of insensitivity toward certain _special_ groups is avoided _at all costs_.   By the way the response, "I do not regret the incident. I will not apologise given the opportunity." was absolutely epic.  It takes courage to stand your ground when the shit is crashing down on you.  People like you give me hope for your generation.
---
This happened to me on xbox yesterday where I could still run but walking drained AP, and said I was overencumbered despite weight being 247/270, like wtf!?

I like how efficiently Bethesda has destroyed this franchise. It usually takes more than a single game to end a series, but here we are.
---
I want my bord.
---
You don‚Äôt get the point. I get more caps  from players than vendor limit. And I play 10 hours a week max without grind. But I get your point. People like you who gain most of the caps from vendors are useful. Cap miners fill economy with currency.
---
Dude this is Yelp for video games.  The more posts Beth sees here that say that they're quitting, with 1k+ upvotes, the more empirical the negativity is represented to them.  This is the way reddit is for every game- its honest feedback.  If you don't like it, scroll past the 10 fucking pixels that the post occupies on the front page
---
Why haven't you guys reverted the last patch?  If its going to take multiple days to get a FRIGGIN HOTFIX out then that's what anyone else would have done.
---
&gt;We are currently developing and testing the hotfix, and expect to deploy this update at either the end of this week or the beginning of next. 
---
Hotfix.  You keep using that word.  I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
"Muleing" is exploiting, its knowingly bypassing an in-game mechanic for an unfair advantage.  Just because it's socially acceptable doesn't make it any less an exploit than duping or bobblehead stacking or anything other cheat.  OP got what he deserved.  Bethesda is under no obligation to respond to him in a timely manner and they are right in refusing him access to their products.  They should have started the hard stance long ago.
---
alarm bells have been going off since before the official release.
---
Oh, right, sorry. Pc. Wish I could change the title...
---
Literally any game made by a major developer in
---
the last few years. Besides EA, almost all devs have released games with barely any game breaking bugs. It's not that much to expect a working and somewhat balanced game out of the box. Your mileage may have been good, but plenty of others sure as hell had issues.
---
And yet fallout 76 fell flat. You see the issue here? Lack of quality and releasing all these buggy versions just because they get away with it. The game feels rushed and poorly optimized, no matter the platform.
---
Seems like you don't like it so much when it happens to you, why make excuses for them since it works for you? Seems fairly easy to understand game breaking issues aren't fun if you've experienced them before.
---
Ah yes, because all these games have game breaking issues that cripple gameplay entirely. For fucks sake, even Minecraft fixes dupes and such quicker.
---
The game was a console port on PC pretty much, with a bunch of issues out of the box if I recall. This game isn't anything new to consoles, and should run just fine. You've put yourself in a bubble making excuses for Bethesda. It MUST be harder to run on consoles right? It must be insanely difficult to patch bugs and make a functioning game. It must be the gamers, they HAVE to be wrong!
---
Far Harbor will literally be a great escape too. They really nailed it, story, setting and especially with player agency. If you haven't finished / played it, save first and play it all 8 different ways to get the full flavor of it. Much better than the two endings in the main quest.
---
But they didn‚Äôt have to code it.  It‚Äôs fallout 4 engine, with a new location, and multiplayer.  Most of the work was already done.  But I‚Äôm just bitter, so don‚Äôt mind me.
---
Hey, don‚Äôt know if this is an isolated incident or not, but it seems the Pharma Farma perk card just up and disappeared on me. Since yesterday I haven‚Äôt been able to search chem containers, just checked my cards and it‚Äôs not there.
---
Please forgive me, but perhaps I was too vague. My point is that the issues go beyond mere bugs. I don't doubt you guys can iron out bugs, its making the game have replay value that's currently limited.
---
There's that meme of the slow dumbing down of Fallout dialogue choices throughout the history of the franchise, to the point there are no dialogue choices in 76.
---
PLUS remember that when you split an atom, you only get half the power, right? Because it's been split?
---
It messes couple things up, but my ts guns are just as effective with little to no effect, but in no way can you justify the strength of a tse being balanced in any way prior to patch.
---
Respec wise I'll admit if i hadn't played so long at an art the point were having 20 points lying around to play with makes changes like this minor inconveniences.
---
I'm willing to bet your "build" for your rifle still pars top vs other builds, the gap isn't stupid huge now howver. Enjoy the game, but don't forget about others. 
---
Honestly, with the never-ending media shitstorm around this game, they MIGHT want it to die quickly. As it stands, 76 is an anchor around the studio's neck.
---
Not all of us are coders, in fact allot can be done with the engine without being a coder, it's more like endless excel spreadsheets with cells that have to have the correct entry to link to another cell, and if it's wrong the whole things sums up wrong.   
---
What I'm trying to say is, when we give Bethesda/Zenimax **EXACTLY** what is wrong, down to the formID number (identification code in the game engine) and what needs to be changed to fix it, we'd love them to use it.   
---
No one here is talking about future IP rights, a payday, or anything outside of using what we are trying, begging them to take, acknowledging it, and including the fixes. 
---
You literally just spoke for me!! 
---
The real test was when the friends who played stepped away, and at that moment I realized it was my friends who were the best part of the game experience and the game had difficulty standing on it's own two feet when played solo. 
---
Reason I don't play anymore: There is no end game. There is nothing fun to do anymore.  
---
In old fallout games it was OK enough to just collect and build up your collection or whatever, but the stash limits kill that.  
---
They need to pick if they want this to be FPS or RPG, and then they need to pick if they want this to be PvP or PvE.  
---
Then they need to focus on that niche. They clearly cannot pump out content, fixes, or balances for all at the same time.  
---
I had a blast exploring everything for the first time, but after that, there needs to be something FUN to do.
---
No, but there is in online.
---
I was hoping for some more rowdy folks, alas I feel short it looks like. 
---
They might have posted there too. Shouldn't hurt that they post here as well. 
---
This isn't some random generic game forum. Bethesda has eyes here.
---
Oh? 
---
You lucky dog. I‚Äôve been farmin for that for too long.
---
No, you don't understand how hard coding is alright, all those other game devs who made games, online services and updated them with less than 10% the amount of bugs and issues this game has had simply don't count, and you can be critical or jab at them until you've also made a triple AAA game with millions of dollars of budget, just like you can't say a sandwich isn't a cake if you aren't a chef.
---
&gt; Eliminate all restrictions on camp locations 
---
Restrictions exist for a reason, not coz Bethesda want to be annoying, if people could build anywhere, u can guarantee that there would be problems, players placing locked doors in the way of particular objectives, or traps (not necessarily mines or anything, but rooms u cannot escape from without fast travelling or relogging). Sure its nice to think that everyone will work together, even if bonuses are involved, but they wont, there will always be outliers looking to muck it up for everyone else.
---
Then theres performance reasons. Some areas are already quite complex (geometry/shader/lighting wise). Adding more details through CAMPs would just destroy peoples frame rates.
---
Preach
---
Have a stair plan if anyone needs haha
---
I always go through phases of "holy crap I am swimming in Radaway and I need to dump it" then after some nuke zones (or 3 in a row) I am completely out of it again.
---
I always use my decontamination shower, it's one of the most useful things I have at my camp.
---
And yes it seems really expensive when you start out but again if your are in a lot of nuke zones your are using a lot of radaway and collecting a lot of flux. Now I have way too much flux and no radaway....
---
Don't know where you're getting 'obviously' duped from considering that stuff came from raids on white springs and the queen, dozens of different people.  At one point we were running 3 full teams on the same server, it was hell get on a single server but we managed. 
---
Do you have any idea how much heavy weapons, armor, and ammo ways when you aren't running any perks?  It adds up very freaking fast. My primary charter, fully kitted out, before weight perks weighs over 3k. After weight perks, he's down to 240.
---
It is not hard to stack up an insane weight when you are carrying items for a dozen people, I can't imagine how much that character was holding for 100.
---
What the fuck...
---
NOW That's alot of damage
---
Lol, i must be old, I've literally never heard of this till now... Where's rick when ya need him. 
---
Lol yep
---
No, I dont tend to bulk because I like seeing the numbers as they are, not having to see if it's a stack of 10 or 15 or whatever.
---
Stats?
---
It's still working. Its just that between TSEs and various perks getting nerfed, along with Glowing Ones having been buffed in a previous update, it's not worth trying to farm a nuke zone. 
---
I think I want to cry
---
I was looking forward to chameleon, got my weightless armor 3 weeks before even having the mutation, I def did my research tho, knew that chameleon armor would void my mutation effects but considering that I really wanted to get the max number of mutations I wanted and to reduce my weight, I decided to invest in getting the mutation
---
dunno what's next lmao
---
Ask your self what an exploit is.
---
Ask your self what a mule is for.
---
Answer your own question.
---
If you need help, it's yes they are cheating and always have been cheating.  See the above two questions for why.
---
&gt;, the time spent server hopping you could have dropped your own nuke.
---
Why would I do that if I had concerns  that they fucked up the nuke launch again? 
---
I thought the storytelling content was okay, though it felt light compared to other Fallouts because the lack of interaction with the story made me aware that there was nothing more to learn through a replay. However, that lack of story progress impacting on the world is somewhat required in a multiplayer game.
---
Along those same lines, on the other hand, the notes, terminals, and audio that only plays for one person is an especially poor way to delivery story in a multiplayer format. I had to go back to areas that I played through with friends because there was no way we were all going to stand around to take turns reading entries on a terminal.
---
Thats out of this world.
---
The next project is more likely to produce money than 76. Unfortunately this game has been plagued from its extremely pre mature release all the way up to this last Band-Aidesque patch. 
---
They should have made it 76 minutes 
---
almost as if you were signalling to bethesda that you loved the game enough to defend it.. so must be good enough, right?     my question is-- how didn't the "canvas bag fiasco, price drop/ overpriced reskins, etc" deter you?
---
*Save it for the judge, sassy pants*
---
Most people say it‚Äôs cause of nuke zones. Do people still not know that you can nuke outside just off prime and the fight always goes on outside the blast zone? Then go in with power armor or hazmat for Flux and you‚Äôre out if there taking maybe 1/2 radaway, which comes back from the enemies. 
---
Community: Two Shot combined with Explosive is the orobl.
---
Bethesda: Okay we will nerf Demolition Expert also 
---
I‚Äôve done my fair share of reports and made my case for multiple bugs that I knew needed to be fixed, but at the end of the day, production has the last say (at least at the studios where I worked). Maybe you have the ability to put your foot down, but my team and I didn‚Äôt.
---
Just saying.
---
I bought the power armor edition for my wife, and games for myself and several of my friends. Took time off work to play the first work of release, just super pumped as this is exactly the game I always wanted. 
---
We've all quit now because the game is a complete and total mess. 
---
There comes a point where you realize the things you thought were really cool or unique ideas simply don't work. Almost all of the game systems are horribly bugged in obvious and hidden ways. 
---
The CONCEPT of the game is amazing, but the execution and underlying design (balance, game loops, content) are just very very poor. The game world has no integrity (bugs, exploits, etc). This on top of the bugs is so disappointing. 
---
If you're so annoyed, why bother talking?  Unless, of course, you enjoy arguing.
---
more than just bobby pins had their weight altered, i just happen to be the only person adressing. many many items from junk to aid to ammo have had their values changed. Mind you, some things HAVEN'T but, exampe, my 2mm electic cartridges now weight 3x more than they did originally. Hardened mass and Glowing mass seem to reversed weights, all kinds of things buddy, bobby pins are the least of the weight issues.
---
You cared enough to not only make a post but to link another post in it. Talk about time invested because you dont care. Ironic.
---
I think the beta period should allow for existing characters so that Bethesda can quickly get a sense on what end game balance and rewards are like. 
---
However, once the Survival mode leaves beta, I agree with you that it should be new characters only.
---
It‚Äôs not broken... it‚Äôs now appropriate for the weapon type it was meant for (which still needs massive balance but that‚Äôs another issue).
---
It‚Äôs not meant to be a perk that‚Äôs sole purpose is to buff a single legendary effect 
---
Oh..   
---
Well, I agree and disagree.   
---
I personally offered up some content that was raider based, textures and models that would increase variety a ton. That would be enough for some, and not others..  
---
But yes, I don't think Bethesda/Zenimax expected us to Hit 100+ in the first weeks of the games launch and complete everything in the same amount of time.  
---
More content is needed, but before that happens we need a stable platform.
---
YES, its infuriating makes me want to never leave the damn suit. In fallout4 I used a mod that turned the default animation into the faster under attack animation. Which is what Bethesda needs to do for 76
---
However anyone feels about duper‚Äôs, people who steal from duper‚Äôs or anyone who cheats, Bethesda gave him 4 days to explain himself and he did. He made it clear that he wasn‚Äôt the one who duplicated the items, and was more than happy to let Bethesda wipe his character. Bethesda just ignored his response and banned him anyway. However you feel about cheaters, that was a dick move on Bethesda‚Äôs part. Plain and simple.
---
Seemed is correct. It seemed good, but in reality made the game way more broken.
---
I used sneak a lot in previous FO games, not so much now. Unless you‚Äôre going for melee &amp; sneak combo I‚Äôd go for higher  dmg resist because at range it‚Äôs easy to sneak without shadowed. Lay a mine or two, lob a grenade in. Start blasting and back away and let them come to you to hit the mines then mop up like a tidy janitor. Go for deep pocketed. I get an extra 50 carry weight. 
---
Tbh it sounds like you want to enjoy the spoils without the work. 
---
When I was low level I used to create dozens of throwing knives for the experience, but it never glitched. I'm certainly not going to test it now to see what happens, but that's what used to happen.
---
How are you only getting 75 damage with a shotgun?
---
Idk I see alot of these types of posts too. Seems alot of people care
---
Ouch... Well if it's not perk related and not materials, it's another bug for the growing pile.
---
Would you like some piss with that same sandwich? Oh, and you better thank me for being polite enough to ask!
---
It's bling. Like you're right in that it's probably totally unnecessary but it's a status symbol cause not everyone can get it readily.
---
Maybe I should rename the title thread and end it with "you're an idiot".
---
it appears ALL power armor helmets are showing as an atom shop item, even though they don't have an atop shop paint job.
---
Idk it might be more I haven‚Äôt played since the update 
---
It's not for nuke zones. Those of us who run mutations rad away and rad x mess up the benefits of the mutation so we use decon showers so we don't lose our bonus
---
I haven't spent several hundred hours playing literally every game in the franchise over the course of 2 decades to have my fan card revoked when I gave 76 a hard pass.
---
Thanks!, I'll point that out to him. 
---
I like the clothes, and BoS combat armor, and supersledge, and mutations, and lever action rifle, and handmade, and I like workshops and CAMP, and I like picking peoples locked doors and when they come and don't attack me I give them a gift hehe. I like to repair things at peoples CAMPs when I find them. I'm like the mystery repair fairy. I like to give people water and cranberry relish and nuka cola and stimpacks, and I like to give lower levels full set of level appropriatte 200% pocketed studded armor and spiked fire axe, making them pretty OP. Stuff like that.
---
Leave the sonic attack, just make it so I can see the fucker through the shiny blue death rings. 
---
I have it so I'm not ALWAYS at -50 disease resistance. The debuff lasts for an hour and a half.
---
But you aren't banned right? A proof that beth is not banning people for just hoarding stuff. That's why I'm thinking OP ain't telling us the whole story. 
---
Let's say Bethesda take on this list, impliment it to a decent degree, and it turns out the entire thing is transformed for the better...
---
What is the Mod community expecting, or hoping for in return for the time/effort?
---
I expect a small percent would appreciate a payday?  
---
But is it recognition? an apology for their flailing ability?  
---
What drives the modders and fixers to push forward?
---
Radaway and Decon have the same effects, and for nuke zones you don‚Äôt need radx 
---
This is the same guy who brought you Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and helped bring you Daggerfall.  What the fuck is he going to say in an interview- that a brand new dev studio branch tried and failed, but is still trying?  Nothing will placate voracious fans, so what's the point?  Not to mention the fact that he has what, 3-4 other AAA titles that he has to account for over the next year-year and a half?
---
Pete Hines, however, can go fuck himself.
---
Very select few special needs people still play. Only the most braindead type of person actually has hope left for the game.
---
Build next to a source of rads and it can be a good way to farm mutations. Other than that, useful when running low on rad aways, unless you do what I do an adjust use sun kissed rank 2 to self cleanse your rads
---
really so then is guerrilla just broken and needs to be addressed by a dev? 
---
&gt; The atom store ~~should~~ shouldn't be operational when the game is fully functional 
---
I didn't start this thread to prove anything to you.  I started it to get an answer to a simple question, that you aren't answering. 
---
You misspelled "I am" and spelled it like I have never seen it before "you're"
---
yes they are under the commando perk
---
word around town is duping is back so...that really accomplished a lot.
---
TSE weapons severely needed a nerf. But normal ballistic and laser weapons especially need a buff
---
&gt;Well, Fallout survived Interplay.
---
That's because a tiny group of very unique people with huge amounts of freedom created something special that still isn't rivaled in parts to this day.
---
Bethesda's Fallouts are good games, but not even close to milestone material and therefore not as robust.
---
In a few decades from now, those will just be part of the "sandbox era" with many other good games like assassins creeds, far cries etc. The only uniqueness and difference basically is the setting and sometimes not even that.
---
All of it, or would only 10 hour suffice?
---
If you sort by new, you'll see nothing but posts exactly like this
---
Stats are in the second link 
---
I started with playing Morrowind on the original Xbox, then Oblivion. I knew nothing of Fallout until a couple weeks after 3 was released, my room mate got it for his birthday and we both fell in love with the universe. NV was announced and I was so hyped and was not let down. I preordered Skyrim (my first preorder), and was one of the first people in my town to have it. I personally enjoy the Fallout series over The Elder Scrolls. Obsidian did better with NV than BGS ever did with any of their own titles imo.
---
So I'm not sure if this is an issue or that's just the way Bethesda planned it to be but my carry weight drops to my base carry weight of 265 when I'm in any type of power armor  except the excavator one.
---
Jesus! I'm glad I stopped playing after the first week. Things seem to just got work.
---
Had to care enough to make a post. Lol.
---
hahaha
---
I have the mutation but I don't have the armor. I haven't really played around with it much unless I use my hooded rags that removes all my armor. Maybe it has uses. Maybe it is good. You are in a better position than me to know.
---
They better pay for me to have friends or add a fucking match making feature 
---
Maybe you should rename it ‚ÄúHow many downvotes can this post get?‚Äù
---
That's one long ass road, bruh.  BSW is the best funded video game company in the business.
---
The alarm bells were going off when they first announced the game, I knew considering how terrible fallout 4 was after New Vegas showed them how to tell a decent story and make the most of their engine under time constraints, that Bethesda were gonna fuck this up. I didnt know it was gonna be the worst blunder in recent gaming history. 
---
Yeah I worked thanks!üëç
---
"Hehe what a bunch of children complaining a product they got was incomlete when it first came out then became worse again about 4 months into its life."
---
You really think people wouldn't have the right to be mad if they bought movie tickets and the movie just cut to black every 20 minutes had blooper cuts instead of the actual cuts all over the film then when it went to DVD it hadoesn't tiny black blotches covering it?
---
It took my two days but I finally completed it. You have to go to the small townhouse looking buildings. One side is open and the other has the handprint readers. I just went to those two spots and if you kill all the ghouls or don‚Äôt see any golfers you have to hop to a new server.  I got lucky once and had like 4 in one run but the majority of the times there were none
---
You got the keycards?
---
uhm, bethesda. They said it themselves in their "hot fix is coming" post.
---
Yea, I've seen lots of new players and it's good that they won't be griefed by a bunch of dicks with TSE and they might have a chance to tag legendaries at White spring or uranium fever.
---
no white knight feed back? no support perk roll back? great!
---
This is the third post I've read this hour where people have gotten banned for playing the game within the boundaries of the game. Some guy got banned from all Bethesda games on his account. It sickens me to think that I'd get banned for creating guns or stimpacks to trade, and lose my account worth hundreds of dollars.
---
Having to worry about getting banned for simply playing within the rules and boundaries set by the company is NOT FUN.
---
It's fun reading comments of mental cases!
---
This happens when you have multiple chest/arm armor pieces in your inventory. Not power armor ones, but just regular/legendary ones. If you sell or put them in your stash it will stop. 
---
Care to elaborate as to why i hear the dupping glitch is back again?? can you please look into this, i know you guys try your best to make this a good game, and i truly do love it myself, but i dont want to play right now cause the dupping is ruining the game, ill admit i did it at first, but i only did once, for fun, i dupped very little, but please im begging please fix this bug finally
---
I‚Äôve bought the leg plans and they work fine. When you learn them for scrapping it only unlocks for that leg/arm. I fortunately scrapped enough arms I got BOS for both. Now I‚Äôm just hunting the BOS chest and helmet paint.
---
It feels so bad to really hope that the game can improve, and then get disappointed for each patch they release... 
---
No, but there have been several credible posts, a couple community managers have responded on, where people have been banned for crafting too much to quickly, or having too many of a specific item.   
---
I've been very careful to make sure I don't have more than a few hundred fluxes, etc, refusing to do trades at times because I don't want to cross a threshold, "just in case". Hell I stopped collecting bobble heads completely. Can totally see someone who is as much of a hoarder as me, but less careful, ended up with a Ban.
---
I think that's where my "swimming in flux" phases come. Everyone was nuking off centre so I wasn't using as much but some people still still hit it on the middle. Really the majority of radaway disappears on a whitesprings nuke and i do enjoy a whitesprings nuke. So in these situation the whole zone causes radiation and any damage the glowing ghouls do causes radiation and if you contract glowing pustles then it does ever more radiation. This is when all of your Radaway disappears. Also had Harpers Ferry nuked the other day and had lots of super mutants, that was a nice change too but again had a lot of radiation.
---
This patch is the cursed gift that keeps on giving.
---
Perfected a build...around being power leveled and given a TSE by a friend. Ok.
---
I didn't have anything equipped and someone else had made a post talking about it
---
I have no idea how to do that sorry lol
---
they probably pulled artificial damage control bots and just let the overwhelming tide of dissatisfaction set in
---
Actually I‚Äôve looked at the files because I wanted to edit some of the meshes to look a little cleaner. They literally changed the .NIF file slightly so you couldn‚Äôt just edit it in fallout 4 programs, or easily put them into 76. It‚Äôs hilarious.
---
What power armor do you have btw? *Bats eyes* 
---
Is West Virginia really that bright? I had to get a mod to fix that. ;)
---
[http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/129049](http://screenshotcomparison.com/comparison/129049)
---
Two minor-but-frustrating issues which might be worth attention: 
---
With this latest patch, the game has been doing something new and frustrating. I have two very similar three-star legendary fireaxes. The only difference is that one is a ghoul slayer and one is a mutant slayer. I've had both of them favourited for weeks now with no issue. With this latest patch, though, whenever I log on, one of the two has been removed from my favourites list and I have to re-favourite it. It's not a big issue, and obviously ought to be low on the list of priorities, but it is a new issue and one which annoys. 
---
Also: This new arrangement with caps stashes just doesn't seem to work properly. I have the level three "caps collector" perk, and 90% of the time, when interacting with a caps stash, I'm not given the prompt to hit my triangle button (PS4) to "search" it. I've gotten that prompt one time in the past two days. Every other time, the prompt hasn't been there at all, rendering this once-invaluable perk almost worthless. 
---
Thank you, someone with some sense.
---
I don't know, would it?
---
r/gatekeeping
---
was just thinking the same thing
---
yeah, its really unfortunate that the only thing they're aware of is bobby pins...like no, everything got fucked up.
---
Okay everybody let‚Äôs just try and chill. 
---
&gt;  this game are fabricating these posts and/or the many upvotes they're getting. Which is
---
you know.. from others' perspective, literally the opposite seems to be true, MAKES YOU THINK, RIGHT?
---
https://youtube.com/watch?v=KS0Rc45tj60
---
All of these games lost in a ban, like...tears in the rain. 
---
Cool, but just so you know, you‚Äôre a douche with a capital Bag
---
I love the franchise hopefully they get it together 
---
I'll play around with it then more! Will let you know
---
Some symbols look like their letters. Some symbols were chosen for more than one letter.
---
Regardless
---
Why the hell would they roll back an update? That would **DESTROY** the game! You‚Äôd have to server hop for items, not be able to access the top monorail place! 
---
This update is a controversial one, but it has its ups and downs.
---
Fair answer
---
Woah what‚Äôs happening?
---
Who brought this straw man in from the field?
---
Here's the thing, I'm sure everyone can attest to..  With Bethesda, Common Sense is not so common any more.
---
&gt;  but people who were big fans before skyrim disliked the direction they took the series with quest markers everywhere, unkillable npcs, and quests that had only one outcome. Not to mention no spell creation.
---
C'mon man, you mention them having too many scary quest markers which has been the same rehashed silly complaint among many other far more legitimate ones dating back to basically every Beth title past Morrowind (it's easy to remember since they'll always bring up Morrowind and how its quests that actually gave good directions without markers weren't bad at all and don't mention the ones that weren't quite that good with the direction giving) but leave out what is by far the biggest issue people had with it: them taking the RPG elements that had already been watered down to Oblivion and Skyrimjobbed the fuck out of them so Skyrim could be for even the Nords who don't have a clue what RPG stands for or even implies outside of the ones that make explodey.
---
I disagree
---
Acting like a ghost is way worse than just saying no thx imo and if your "friends" would get mad simply because you don't want to join a game or party chat us remove them quick as shit
---
Still haven't gotten the plan to spawn, I have been checking every day since my first post and still nothing. I am on Xbox1 so that won't work, but thanks for the offer to help me out. I guess I will just have to keep trying and hope for the best.
---
This aspect is killing it for me.
---
Who knows? They could be lying. When someone gets banned for cheating, first thing they do is play innocent and claim that devs wrongfully banned them. As a devoted MMO gamer, I've seen that way too many times.
---
&gt;Fallout 4
---
&gt; the price drop to $35 weeks after launch, the $20 armor reskins
---
I agree with everything except this. Price is still $80/60 CAD/USD on Xbox/Playstation stores and the $20 reskin(s) can be obtained entirely for free. I'm all for bitching at Bethesda over this shitshow, but at least be reasonable about it...
---
I don‚Äôt suppose you are still on, are you? If so, I‚Äôd like your help. What‚Äôs your psn? I‚Äôll join your world and find ya 
---
I just added your game. Chiseledhen860 
---
A lack of humility. 
---
There is literally no way in hell I will preorder again. Hell, I‚Äôve sunk hundreds of dollars into ESO and I‚Äôm not preordering their new chapter (which I have always done in the past) specially because of my experience with Fallout 76. I‚Äôm not even going to touch Starfield. So in my case, you‚Äôre wrong.
---
Insane isn‚Äôt it?
---
Ok interesting. Thanks for the advice!
---
Fallout 76 is broke, didn't you hear?
---
Nobody watches him either, he made decent YouTube videos when the shodycast stopped existing but everyone realized he's actually bad at script writing and telling out lore, he basically reads the wiki and stares at trial junk in the first room for an hour, how could antone watch that?
---
Fallout 76 is dead for me. Bethesda lost the last bit of respect in my eyes. Excuse me if I am salty, hostile and negative but we are reaching February and all we see is mess, shady practices and nothing that was promised appearing on the horizon. We are left with a even worse mess than what we were given during 'B.E.T.A' something that was supposed to help with fixing as much stuff as possible. 
---
Bethesda, you had since your 'closed door' game crap you made for Youtubers and such, you had time to  decide to let the game stay in works for a while with proper Closed Beta to find and fix as many of the issues as possible and instead we are given not even a fraction of what promised. A DEAD, unfinished world with repetitive, tedious mechanics and surprisingly well polished ATOMIC STORE. 
---
Not only we are given 'patches' that break the game further instead of fixing it but we also get surprisingly more content for that scammy 'cosmetic' crap that at some point was either supposed to have lootboxes or will have seeing all the datamined stuff. I am sorry but for company that took the IP from their original creators, who began to desecrate the Game and Lore created so far all  I can see is that Bethesda should  get sent to point where they decide, to either sink to the bottom, g bankrupt or sell the Fallout IP to some other company.
---
I tried to remain positive about this title and about Bethesda for years but seeing how they handle 76 I am at point where I am done trying to just go along with this mess. I feel sorry towards the devs who worked on the game itself and aimed to give us the best experience as their work is wasted thanks to Corporate crap. I don't care at this point if I am banned from this Reddit and Bethesda Launcher, I am just too tired to sit silently and watch how franchise I loved since my youth is desecrated, torn apart, chewed up and spitted like it was nothing to those that worked on it.
---
72 minutes is one hour and twelve minutes 
---
60 minutes is one hour
---
I can't updoot this enough! 
---
Idk how u got that but ok
---
you're horrible and you ruined fallout
---
It doesnt matter if you found a fix or not. This exact same thing happened for years with the Payday 2 community as modders were posting straight up code to fix bugs on the forums that were never once taken by the devs to fix anything. Companies don't take advice from modders, period.
---
You ain't fooling anyone, Todd.
---
Well played,
---
Yah I hit my mark last night. The new patch created more bugs than it fixed and no new content.
---
I think I'll be back in 3 or 4 months once they clean this thing up, until then, I just cant keep trying to find the good in something that is really fucked.
---
Game is beaned
---
Like, next level broken. New patch seems to have been based on two or so builds ago, many old bugs have returned
---
Can you like give us some kind of compensation for this crap?  Last two days now I have been waddling around in broken armor I can‚Äôt fix and a busted camp due to the bulk material glitch. Too tedious to work around. 
---
The devs are doing a fantastic job!!
---
Yeah not my case, my buddies.... but as someone else pointed out, Bethesda has a binding arbitration clause in their TOS... so yeah.. there's always that ;-)
---
Exactly.  
---
Going by OPs logic the moment you passed on 76 you seized to be a "true fan".  
---
What a load of shit.
---
My man portable mk19 auto grenade launcher weighs as much as my combat shotgun.
---
Fun fact: mk19 is a tripod or vehicle mount HEAVY weapon. 
---
Was it the bobby pins
---
The added benefit of walking around on death's door
---
tried this but didn‚Äôt work for me, but thank you for the detailed response 
---
Fuck you won. Gg man.
---
Yeah I doubt it will be free to play, but I think they want to try get a chunk of PVP segment buying the game and skins
---
8? 8 stats? What do you mean?
---
OP never mentioned Weapon Artisan.
---
100%.. that's not a hotfix. We should be having at least weekly patches. If I rolled out the wrong version of something, it would be fixed in less than an hour. This makes me feel embarrassed for them.
---
I love the mod community for Bethesda games you guys are all rockstars and beautiful pepole who have kept adventures going for years and added countless hours of enjoyment for me, you guys are truly the best mod community.
---
Have you tried crying about it? Oh yeah you did...How did that work out for you?
---
**What would the modders want in return?**.  
---
The people who've helped me with the bug roundup list would love an acknowledgement, and maybe the ability to have some dialog in the future, but that is it.   
---
No one I'm working with is asking for money, groveling apologies or anything besides a more stable game (other than better communication, which we were promised multiple times.).  
---
**What drives a modder?**.  
---
Everyone it's different. Just like in life.  
---
I know some who mod because they believe "X" company (it's not just Bethesda games that are modded) got something wrong, or missed an opportunity.   
---
   
---
And there are yet others who love the fact that they have a canvas to paint on, and find joy in making things others use.  
---
For me it started with a careless and ignorant post on one of the most downloaded mods on nexus, and the author "back handing" me, in a firm but constructive way.
---
Telling me to take some time to educate myself, because the problem was on my end, and not his.   
---
He was right, and once I peaked under the hood, I couldn't help but tinker, and the more I've learned, the more I've wanted to create and improve upon.
---
That‚Äôs not correct, because then I‚Äôd be able to make one of the legs BoS then. I can‚Äôt make either. Neither leg. And I never Got the arm plans at all but can do both of them. So it‚Äôs still glitched either way
---
Well, he SAID Gunsmith 5.
---
There‚Äôs also rumour that Square Enix scrapped two years of work from final fantasy 7 remake that was unusable 
---
Serious question... my roomate gota tse gauss rifle and used it for a day before putting it away (occasionally breaking it out for the queen). He said it wasnt fun bc he 1 shot everything (unclear if he was sneak attacking and charging all his shots or not). But after a day of that he went back to regular weapons.
---
Were high lvl death claws 1 shots? Maybe 2? If so did that not get boring for you?
---
And i agree the weapons generally are unbalanced af, but I'm more inclined towards making guns weaker and break less often than making them all 1 shot clinics. When i run through the starter zones now I'm bored af not worried about taking damage, just 1 shot 1 shot 1 shot. If the cranberry bog were more of the same i would have quit months ago.
---
The prime manual gatling seems to be at the right level. 68 scorched can be 1 or 2 hit, but a lot of enemies will give you a fight. If it were legendary with armor pen or the nerfed te is would still be reasonable power wise for final level gear. 
---
But idk the game seems to be broken in so many irreconcilable ways at this point.  Never mind the lack of endgame. Still i dont understand ppl being upset they can no longer 1 shot or 2 shot tops everything short of the queen. What's fun about that?
---
Honestly I just have fun playing it... ok besides the annoying bugs and server instability and the game crashing when I'm doing something important. I just love the franchise and I really like survival base builder games that have a story, although FO76 doesnt have as an immense story as other fallouts I still enjoy the game for what it's worth. Even though I rage practically the entire time I play it XD
---
I don't know if they're gonna fill all those. It doesn't look like Bethesda Main is giving any support to the Austin Team. And if thats the case then who wants to work for a company that doesn't back you up and give you projects that are doomed to fail out the gate?
---
They just want your money, they‚Äôve made it clear they don‚Äôt care about the game or fan‚Äôs opinions. They have literally been false advertising merchandise. Tod must have lost his mind. 
---
Downvotes to the right
---
Costs me nothing to believe in another human being, and I'm tired, so tired, of the ignorant witch hunts 
---
Not this time of year haha. 
---
What shits me is I can empty clips from multiple weapons at a time into enemies for minimal damage but as soon as I whack them with my super sledge a few times, they go down. What the fuck is happening with the stats here. I stopped playing 5 weeks ago 
---
&gt; So is it technically false advertising?
---
Hmmm...no.
---
If you want the game to be shut down, good luck. You‚Äôd be better off trying to shut down Bethseda themselves than this.
---
\[The Bethesda community manager is making a joke out of that canned response\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alfuv2/can\_we\_show\_some\_appreciation\_for\_how\_active/efea6ty/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alfuv2/can_we_show_some_appreciation_for_how_active/efea6ty/?context=3)) but really only Bethesda is laughing because they already got our money from pre-ordering / ordering fo76. This entire experience of buying the game has been such a shitshow and they bother to make jokes about it at the customers' expense.
---
I used the known plans mod since it came out. No issues, worked perfectly.
---
Today I laughed because Bethesda's version of it was wrong on a few plans.
---
I guess fo4 modders have had years more experience working on 76.
---
Im like in a toxic relationship with this game, i hate it but i love the franchise
---
It might not work for you, it works for me. Games super buggy it might‚Äôve not counted for you when you were scrapping even though you got the pop up.
---
how much damage does your tickle machine do?
---
I had a similar experience with kingdom come deliverance. Thanks for commenting üëåüèª
---
U have any perks focusing on shotguns or explosives
---
You did it.. The Bethesda way! Haha I did the same thing too
---
There's a difference between storing items for others that have dropped and might be useful at some point and storing thousands or tens of thousands of items that have been duplicated.
---
As per what I said, storing items that have been gained through an exploit means you're involved in that exploit. IMO it deserves a ban, although maybe a lesser ban than the person who duplicated the items themselves. I doubt Bethesda have the tools to figure out who duped something though, just the ability to figure out who's holding it all.
---
I don‚Äôt WANT the game shut down, the game NEEDS to be shut down. It needs to be reworked, optimized,balanced and updated.
---
Ammosmith gives you five per craft but yeah, the weight is so ridiculous it takes away any reason to use.

Wow Freudian slip, caught me dreaming of a better time..
---
Im sure that's a tough spot to be in. I feel for you guys I really do.
---
Guess what, it costs me nothing to believe in another human, especially since I've been a target of the same witch hunts here, and in game, because I play differently.
---
I've had people threaten to (and may have) report me, for no other reason then I have them items to help them out.   
---
Others do the same because they though I had too many items (none of the Legendaries stack kids, which is what is important), not understand how a "mule" account works..

Someone is gonna mainline buffout and fuck a 2 headed cow

Yup, I'm in the same boat

Nope

They are going to put out a hot fix for it

Class freak 3 doesn't seem to be working properly on ps4, got adrenal reaction and is showin -18 HP when it was -12 before the patch
---
I think I can speak for a lot of us when I say: "You had your chance".
---
I'll be checking back in a few months, but not getting my hopes up. A little peeved I spent $60 on a lackluster game, but I get I squeezed enough hours out of it to consider "getting my moneys worth". But even for someone like me, who is patient with MMOs, who is patient with developers, who doesn't come here to bitch and moan, who submits bugs, etc.... even I have a breaking point. And this last patch was it.
---
I‚Äôm watching Oxhorn play on YouTube and I noticed too that the date never changes from 10/23/2102. I guess not enough people are talking about it for Bethesda to notice?
---
While I understand your frustration, I actually believe the community manager when they post this.  The source of the game's problems are higher up.
---
And failed... soooo? No,
---
This isn't funny. You're laughing probably because the players already paid money to buy this game but really, it's only funny for Bethesda. Especially since you guys don't do refunds and keep nerfing things as you like. Since launch, it's been WHAT WILL BETHESDA DO NOW?
---
I‚Äôm not sure if Beth knows what is a real problem and what isn‚Äôt. A sobby Reddit post isn‚Äôt going to make a difference in the game but complaints about complaints are just as boring. The whole feed is either complaints about the game or complaints about the players‚Äô complaints. That alone says quite a lot about the state of this game. This is far worse than the Destiny 2 subs were a year ago and Bungie had a come-to-Jesus meeting with their player base. This has gotten way out of hand and Bethesda appears to be in over their head. 
---
It's far from a story game, it's a co-op and competitive online game. Story is just a part and not even really a large part. What would even be the point of making it online and not having a PvP focus? 
---
Yeah well, I decide to trust bethesda. They are humans too you know
---
I was also thinking of hanging up my cleats. My tse‚Äôs dont do any damage anymore. Its BS! I don‚Äôt understand why they would do this to us. I paid 60$ for them to stab me in the back. Im gunna do it. Im gunna delete my character
---
Reading through your comments here, it literally seems you're more mad that people don't like and are being critical of the game and that has offended you even though you act like you don't care, it also sounds a bit hypocritical of you whining about people complaining, when you have no reason to be upset or defend Bethesda, they're a mulit-million dollar game studio, you think they're going to get their feelings hurt or give up something? The mistakes they've made and the way they've handled everything would be undeniable fact but like I said judging from your comments it seems like you're denying anyways. You are quite the lying and delusional person so I don't even think you are even going to leave or quit the sub like you said, you're just going to mope and cry and make excuses.
---
&gt;Massively unpopular opinion : it's not that big of a deal and it's actually just a very vocal \*minority\* of players who are at all pissed.
---
Not just unpopular, but quintessentially incorrect too.
---
The amount of potential players BGS was able to wrangle into 76 is a very small slice of the wider fallout audience. \*\*That\*\* is your vocal minority. The ones who are finally seeing the light now, at this particular time, are just coming around to the opinion of the vast majority.
---
Mines doing the same
---
I'm pretty sure the charlesburg station vendor has it
---
They got our money. Didnt wanna believe it was a cash grab but, its becoming clear that is the case. I think they do care but the motivation on the dev team is dwindling because of the backlash. 76 is a reflection of what is to come from.this studio... Thats the scariest part of all this. 
---
Lol and make the TSE‚Äôs one shot again? Yeah, no thanks. 
---
If I may make one suggestion:
---
TEST, *THEN* RELEASE.
---
You might be right, and if anything the past three months makes me think you could be..   
---
    
---
But as I've said, it's my last shout into the void, and it's cost me nothing..   
---
And it might be giving some people hope, or reassurance they are not alone in the love of a game "that could be" so much more than it is now.   
---
The feedback and up voting makes me think others believe, atleast a little bit, still.
---
Bethesda apologize? I appreciate your humor. But also, amen.
---
.. I was feeling the same way by the way. Nice to hold civil conversation about this stuff, whatever one‚Äôs opinions about various aspects of the game. Thanks as well :)
---
Bethesda seems like they're actively trying to make people not play the game, through any means necessary.
---
Is this the fucking Producers?
---
Is Todd trying to tank the franchise for the insurance money?
---
What the fuck is going ON?
---
I suppose it could. This one the only one that was given for the 3 of us (lvl 130+).
---
Can only really do damage with melee now..
---
i would have left and been done with this subreddit months ago when i uninstalled but the hubris of these chodes thinking they can defend the well-being of the game by attacking dissent...  ooh boy that shit rustles my jimmies
---
And I guess Hitler didn‚Äôt WANT to invade France. France NEEDED to be invaded. 
---
For anyone who doesn't know or realize...
---
76 is being handled by BGS Austin (formally battlecry studios)
---
This is their 1st released game of course there are going to be mistakes and things overlooked that seem like common sense
---
That doesn't excuse anything but does explain why a lot of these types of things are happening
---
It might be torsos, I'm pretty sure that arm/leg/limb mods and plans always carry that title on them
---
*what you meant to say was LUNCHBOX, but what we heard was LOOTBOX!*
---
Well I'm obviously not as emotionally attached to video games as you are so I apologize. It's just a passtime to me. If I start to dislike fo76 then I will play something different. I'm not gonna wear any merch and I'm not going to join some protesting armada pursuing change. I'm just gonna play until I'm bored or until another game catches my attention. I'm not "whipped" I'm just not as invested as some I suppose.
---
Alot of people do
---
A little humility can go a long way.
---
Loved building settlements in FO4 - would spend hours doing just that.  The budget isn't fun to deal with but if you're careful you can still come up with some pretty creative homes, not settlement size but there's room for creativity within the limits.
---
My biggest complain is the lack of flat ground to build on, grass appearing into floor tiles, and anything over 2 floors seems to choke the CAMP coding.  In some ways though FO76 is better - you're actually building the whole structure.  With FO4, my frustrations was always how to secure/wall up/fix existing buildings...  with holes in the wall, etc.  I spent a lot of time fixing up damaged buildings, my biggest settlement in Sanctuary Hills had people living in those broken down homes, cleared of the garbage in them as much as I could.
---
jury rigging was an awesome perk
---
Ok Todd!!
---
While I cannot claim any inside knowledge nor have a handy reference but as I recall Bethesda‚Äôs comments they seemed more concerned about the impact of large inventories impacts on server performance, consequently the effect on other players, and the perceived stability of their product. Regardless of how you obtained them, muleing them around enabled others to do so and it doesn‚Äôt entirely surprise me that you were banned.   
---
That said, I am not certain I agree with them or you but it is something that seems likely to me that I have yet to see anyone suggest as a possible motivation. Granted it really doesn't matter what I think about it anyway.  
---
p.s. given the poor security options at Bethesda and for the sake of other games linked to your email, I‚Äôd black out your email address. 
---
Well mine also dropped at lvl 25 and I‚Äôm lvl 129 that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs only gonna drop at 25 
---
It's just weird bc most mods are very specific in terms of the name says it all.
---
Its always the fucking bobby pins!!
---
Check if you had toggled craftable by pressing Q. You might not have high enough white knight (I think) so you cant build it or not enough mats and you had toggled that so it is invisible.
---
I have a heavy weapons build, and generally use the Gatling gun. My biggest complaint isn't durability, or damage in general. Instead the two things that it needs adjusted is an armor penetration mod or buff, since the dang thing is useless against higher level Mutants, SBs, or the SBQ. My damage right now on it is around 120 or so per round, but against any armored enemy it becomes worse than my handmade at 60ish damage. 
---
PLUS the rate of fire drop when fighting the queen is super annoying. I'm not sure if it's an FPS drop on the client side or on the server side, but when battling the Queen it feels like the ROF is about half what it should be. 
---
I know that the SB buffs with more players that show up to fight it, but it's really getting old dumping 3000+ rounds into it, and only knocking out a small visible of damage on the Queen (like around 2%-4% maybe.)
---
How much is the damage with stock receiver? Because per F4 style I believe the TS and E bonus is calculated from that. 
---
Considering 46 thousand people viewed a video he posted 14

---
Will guerrilla perk not working with 10mm smg or sub machine gun  ever be addressed? 
---
To be fair, I don't think this situation would have emerged any differently had he been unaware. It's unlikely they could prove he was aware the items were duped, and what justice is it to punish someone for a crime they weren't aware they were committing?
---
Well you probably pissed 4 of your buddies off
---
The rest of the gaming community: "We told you so"
---
Yeah there are huge inconsistencies. Take for example excavator mods not being named, or the bladed pool cue
---
They are certainly more entitled.
---
without a doubt, obsidian added something to the franchise. I personally hated having bullets fire off target because one of my skills was not higher.  loved the story, hated the actual gameplay.  my bullets should fire exactly where I aim them.
---
I think we played the same path tho.  i had oblivion on xbox, then pc.  since then ive been exclusively pc.
---
i honestly cant imagine anything more fun than pvping (skyrim 76) against my brother in skyrim and absolutely wrecking him with arrows üòÄ
---
wrong.
---
Doesn't this then become a slippery slope? When do stop patting people on the back for patting people on the back for patting people on the back...
---
Any vendor bot now
---
We‚Äôve given them 3 months and the game has effectively gotten worse and worse and worse than when it was in Beta... this is a full product release...we wait another 3 months for a full product to even get up to speed? Again, I love this game but, right now trying to continue to support it, is failing miserable. And they need to do something to redeem themselves. The entire community has been boycotting the game all day. That isn‚Äôt a good sign. These are their players and their community and a overwhelming amount of people today alone have completely said fuck this shit I‚Äôm out. That is not good. 
---
This post is boring.
---
Hans, get the flammenwerfer!
---
Is it has i didnt care about the bobby pin thing i never carried a whole lot 
---
They should have first focused on not having the game crash every few minutes or enemies being invisible and still hurting you.
---
With this reply full of facts and knowledge how could I argue? Your wit is superior to my own sir, I have been bested by a true intellectual.
---
Its like they dont even care. They know all these issues are present but continue to add worthless nerfs no one gives a shit about
---
Cheer up, bud. It's good that you learned this with a $60 game, and not a $20,000 car. This financial lesson will encourage you to value your money, and treat you well for the rest of your life.
---
There's very little that you can claim are worse. 5 steps forward and one back. Comparatively we're in a better spot now ... I guess
---
Yep, it's pretty clear there's hard work being done (and done well) by the community manager. It's the dev team or something in management that are screwing things up. Personally I got bored and stopped playing a month or so ago (after 120 hours played). i've just been lurking on the side lines to see what improvements are being made...so far not so good. 
---
My dog ate my homework. Maybe you're telling the truth, but it comes off odd. Either way sorry they didn't respond back to you in a timely fashion. That's the real bummer here. 
---
so..  rust?
---
You disrespected our savior Todd. Now you will be sacrificed to almighty Atom
---
They can code the game client to check for the presence and quantity of specific item types... but can not track individual items.  Eg. Items do not have transaction histories, creation origin, ownership histories, things you would need to determine weather an item was a duplicate, or an original.  
---
You can't compare a duped item, and it's original source, and tell the difference between the two.  If they had the transaction history, creation origin, and ownership info.. you could look at the creation date, and look at the history info and see that it was created after the time stamps on the histories, thus pointing out the duplicated item.
---
Yeah it was sorta payback for them making me get ARK then trash talking it and never playing it
---
Yeah just unbulked everything and I'm able to repair again.
---
So basically don't touch anything until it fully loads or I'll cause it? How can I tell when it's safe to do something?
---
Nice pics! I'll let you know if we find something higher :)
---
149 with stock receiver at level 45 
---
So in otherwords u know jackshit and feel the need to comment
---
I like how they have cats in this game (they are hard to find though.) Ummm... yeah cats are great... O yeah and I like my twoshot mirv fatman. Will buy a instigating mirv fatman now but its so fun to use. It literally is like BOOOOOOM. And all my friends will be like aghhh lag spike dont do it again! And of course, Ill do it again
---
Bobby pins have ruined everything!! Lol. 
---
1. Xbox One S
---
2. labcoat116
---
3. N/A (Xbox services have been down all day so I can't do anything in regard to getting screenshots/video even if I have them)
---
4. I'm constantly (and randomly) getting stuck on workbenches. Doesn't matter which ones they are, I'm always getting stuck. Has happened at my camp and whitesprings. My HUD disappears when I go to leave a workbench and I'm stuck there unless I close and restart the whole game.
---
This is really frustrating and makes me never want to use a workbench, because it takes so long to restart the game due to not connecting.
---
...and then the server crashes, because 15 people are trying to scrap shit and use the workbench at once!
---
*hallelujah!*
---
Not defending Bethesda.  
---
I can't speak for what the Community Mangers can or can't do.. (Though I have to believe right now they have a really really hard job.).  
---
The rollout, failings and flailings have crushed more than a few people's dreams, and I'm sure it's cost Bethesda tremendously, both in reputation and the bottom line.  
---
I'm not jaded enough to think "Todd Howard" or anyone else is sitting back laughing right now.
---
In fact I have to believe there are people at Bethesda/Zenimax loosing allot of sleep and worrying about their futures.  
---
All I can do is try, this last time, before I turn out the light and walk away.    
---
Yongyea, boogie2988, thequartering, I can go on. Everyone is talking about it.
---
Go to pipboy
---

‚ÄúRetrieve your loot‚Äù or something along those lines
---
I just like the game. It‚Äôs just fun to me :P
---
The massive amounts of people shitting on it won‚Äôt make anything better so I‚Äôm just gonna happily support the game while things slowly get better.
---
I see where you're coming from, but it wasn't a minor issue to a lot of people. There had been constant threads on the front page of this subreddit asking for the feature since the beta. My point is that it took over three months for some as simple as adding a "known" tag to actually get patched in. While it's cool that they finally did it, I'm very concerned about how much Bethesda is investing into making the game better if it took them so long to patch in something so simple, and other than that all they've really done is nerf things. Sure, they've fixed bugs, but there are new bugs as a result. I just want to see the game get fixed and it feels like Bethesda has all but given up on it. They'll roll out minor things here and there, but I think that the majority of their developers are working on Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 while trying to put this game as far behind them as possible. I could be wrong, but that's what it feels like right now. 
---
A brutal game that takes hours to reach end game weapons... All to be taken away with a couple of people with c4 when you aren't online.
---
Don't play unless you have no job and a bunch of friends. It's honestly a second job to maintain that game.
---
Bethesda replied with a list of comments, the actual post is NOT from a Bethesda employee or affiliate. But I will look at this in detail, thank you for the source it is appreciated.
---
Too little, too late.   
---
You've already burned the last of your brownie points in the community when even this place is almost entirely against you, BGS. 
---
Good job ruining something that had excellent potential with sheer, unadulterated incompetence. 
---
Maybe next time you'll fix bugs and implement actual requests and concerns that have been voiced for MONTHS instead of nerfing uneccesary shit literally nobody asked for and then giving us back the old bugs.
---
Just enjoy the game. It‚Äôs fallout 4 with a new story that you can enjoy with you‚Äôre friends. My friends didn‚Äôt want to play it i I made new friends that helped me and I helped them. It‚Äôs not a bad game. You just need new friends. 
---
Dude, if you cant kill a level 23 at 100+, that means you've been mooching off the TSE one shotting everything for 80+ levels. You got a dupe from a friend, and played easy mode. Nobody here buys that you "perfected" any build.
---
&gt;  but took advantage of them exploiting the system anyway which makes you an accomplice after the fact. Kind of like telling a cop, well yeah I knew the money was stolen, but I wasn't the one who robbed the bank.
---
A bit silly needing to justify it with a roundabout explanation that labels him as "not really a duper but practically almost kinda as bad" when quite a few games won't even give a shit if you were abusing or benefiting indirectly from someone else exploiting bugs‚Äìjust using alts solely as a repository to circumvent built-in inventory restrictions (AKA "muling") for yourself and/or others is bannable by itself.
---
I've played a lot of MMOs and the only one that has released in this broken of a state was FFXIV 1.0 and SE had to blow up the entire game and start over in order to get it to a working state.
---
that's like saying taking your foot out of your mouth is a huge positive step towards breathing.
---
The guns at my base are just shooting random spots in the ground.
---
I don‚Äôt doubt that‚Äôs possible.
---
10% is worth it for me, but this is good to know!
---
It's fun. 
---
Well its because they were the TSE users who got fed up of not being able to ruin other people‚Äôs camps anymore.
---
I‚Äôve asked multiple times for them to release an open letter of apology,they give no fucks. We all already bought the game, they made their millions. The emotions of the players are irrelevant to them at this point. Had to get that funding for ESVI somehow.
---
Gatling gun is very ammo efficient. 50cal is okay for dps. Rarely do I pull it out besides very large targets tho.
---
Well considering Bethesda has managed to RE FUCK their game... it is a wonder anyone is playing... I mean what reason has Bethesda given people to have faith they will fix their game?
---
It‚Äôs permanent. So if you move, you‚Äôll lose your pet, and still not have the 10%
---
Because I enjoy it. plain and simple.
---
what would it take for me to drop the game? get tired of it, which eventually happens to all games. or if p2w microtransations and/or loot boxes get put in, which so far doesnt seem to be happening.
---
WHO LET THE DEMOMAN IN HERE?
---
Ah, I can't stay mad at ye mate, come here and have some scrumpy wit meh
---
Melee needs a big big nerf 
---
Seeing as that‚Äôs an u related team of developers working on it I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs quite a stretch
---
Too little too late... .
---
No, the post, is from Bethesda, directly. Read it.
---
it needs to be equipped for that buff to take effect, if you have that weapon equipped, your carry weight goes up and if it‚Äôs a melee weapon, the damage will go up for that specific weapon. hope this helped :)
---
Nah, he was using an Auto 10mm, not the  10mm SMG. The pistol is still gonna get the guerrilla bonus. 
---
Just another reason fallout 76 is almost dead.
---
gatling is probably the best but breaks really fast. .50 cal is the best all around-er.
---
gatling *laser* is made out thin, crumbled paper and breaks after like 2.5 cores. so you need to be carrying 3 or 5 at all times. not to mention Batteries Included is pretty much a requirement so fusion cores don't weight a ton. and you'll need a ton because the damage is bad compared to other heavy weapons. same with plasma.
---
&gt;survival game
---
Where's the survival though? There is no danger and you cannot move a foot without stepping on 5 steaks and 6 beers.
---
&gt;If you don‚Äôt want to spend money in the Atomic shop for cosmetic stuff you don‚Äôt have to. We give you a sh*tload of Atoms just for playing the game. Folks that want to spend money on whatever the hell it is because they don‚Äôt have enough Atoms, they can, but it‚Äôs not, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm now better playing against other players because I spent money.‚Äô It‚Äôs not pay-to-win. And it‚Äôs not loot crates.
---
Remember that assurance? And yet, here we are, watching Bethesda jam their foot in the door by giving health bonuses for atom shop items. Yes, it's only temporary. Just like lunchboxes will be. 
---
Honesty tse players were ruining my queen runs and events, you might be having fun one shotting the queen and get all the loot when theres 14 people all wanting to tag her but no one else was.
---
So if the meta no fun tse users leave, hell yeah.
---
It's a fun game that has had lots of small but annoying problems since launch. There's about 100 hours worth of exploring and questing before you run out stuff to do. The end game is not good, but every videogame I've ever played has ended or became boring some point.
---
I've played the game today. All of my scrap is bulked so that was a minor annoyance but I just didn't bulk anything I found today and it'll be patched quickly, not a big deal.
---
I joined the community because people share useful info. I find the community to be less toxic towards each other than other gaming communities but incredibly toxic towards the game itself. It's not FO76, it's been this way since before FO4. There's a decent percentage of "Bethesda fans" that want to see everything Bethesda does fail and will jump at the opportunity to push that narrative. Today I'm just lqtm at the community's over reaction and wave of people "announcing their departure".
---
 I like PvP. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre focusing on it
---
Exactly what I was wondering. Thanks!
---
 All they have to do is buff base Gun Damage by 25% to 40% based on the gun. Then guns we would be fine. Then patch everything they broke and game would be in a good spot.
---
Hes not for one and two its illegal to lock him out of other games to which he didnt break any tos for. They broke the contract on their end which leaves them open to legal action.
---
Thing about that is... Now Fallout 4 seems lonely to me. I want my team in there 
---
Same.
---
Hell yeah!!!! UNINSTALL!!!!
---
Wait so you can go to space in fallout 76? 
---
Thats like saying a forest fire burned my house down and you're the neighbor saying "what happened??"
---
If it don't work, don't fix it.
---
Good riddens. You're a duping loser that is adding to the many problems. I'd ban you off Reddit as well, goof. Guilty, I sentence the op to a hanging
---
But some of these bans are "automatic" as I understand it, accounts being flagged for triggering a specific threshold.  
---
I could be wrong, and the OP could be a duper, but as I said, costs me nothing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and it costs the community allot to keep being so toxic to their brothers and sisters.
---
Well I dunno about you, but the game is far from fucked for me. Played solidly for 4-5 hours last night, not even a "Server not responding" message. The only thing I noticed as an issue personally, was the bobby pin weights, but I can live with that. TSE nerf didnt affect me, dont use them, and still 1-2 hit most high level enemies with just a standard lever action. Any and all other issues, not present or not noticeable to me, so yeah different people, different experiences.
---
What a hilarious and original comment. 
---
I guess the issues people have with the game don't bother me? I just load and explore. Find guns and use them for a while. Try different melee weapons. I feel likes it's more of science experiment in armament for me. Play with different perks.
---
 Honestly the one thing I could use in a future update would be, being able to save card load outs. But I make due in situations and learn from them. 
---
TSE is the last thing I wanna hear, I‚Äôm so tired of people bringing that up. TSE is 1% of the problem, that is nothing.
---
It's not even a duping method anymore! This is wild.
---
Its your, not you‚Äôre
---
It's their software and their TOS, their game and you should play by their rules.
---
Nothing wack about it bro.
---
The point is. Hes guilty untill proven innocent. I hope you get charged with a crime someday and they never give you a fair trial. At the same time take away everything from you.
---
Unfinished?
---
Oh they‚Äôre you‚Äôre brothers are they? Hahahahahahanana
---
Good point .. and nice reply!
---
Before this game I played ESO for 2 years and before that Guildwars 2. A game is fun if:
---
Risk + effort = reward.
---
A SB has little to No loot and takes a LOT of effort now. A yauguai takes some effort but always award springs. A 3 Star legendary ghoul at whitespring takes Even less effort and potentially carries great loot.
---
Beth. screwed up the coding on these things. I cant believe this was "intented gameplay mechanism". Poor low level that try to get to whitespring now with up to 3 SB in the air sometimes...
---
Game is like 12 bucks on g2a lmao 
---
Maybe employees are abandoning ship after seeing the mess
---
Surviving to be able to have patience to play the game is the new meta end game.
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that reaching the main menu means the game works.
---
Hey. I like ark...
---
I'm actually having fun, believe it or not. My gameplay has not been greatly affected by any bugs, I've made loads of new friends, and I love exploring the world.
---
I'm around for the long haul. I'd love for this game to be successful and lay the groundwork for implementing small squad co-op play in future Fallout and Elder Scrolls titles.
---
Lol its only unlikely its duped if you bought it but not him? Dude bethesda has said that the majority of legendaries are duped.
---
GET HIM IN THE NAME OF THE HOLY ONE!
---
Hey man, it fell off the truck. It ain't mine. I'm just holding it for a friend!
---
It just works. 
---
The best dps I've seen after TSE nerf is TSE Gatling Plasma.
---
BUUUUUUT, it literally breaks before you can use 1 core.
---
You done bruh? 
---
I edited my statement above, I believe in leaving original statements to show error. You were correct I would agree this was a poor choice to patch off of and must have been alot of work. I will say I have tested what I said above besides the dupe of course. 
---
agreed played everyday farming. grinding and trading others to get the best weapons and then all the dupers came and then everyone had the same stuff and it just made the game stale. what was the point of having the best items in the game if everyone has them ?
---
every once in a while i will log in just to see if anything is new and there never is, the end game just turns into diablo 3 you are farming the same areas to possibly get better loot but that rarely happens 
---
Sometimes it feels that way...  
---
Yesterday and today it's felt like that...    
---
Every time I see a post I put up that someone tags one of the Community Managers on that gets ignored makes me feel that way.   
---
But they are also human, and likely overwhelmed by the amount of anger, the see if rage, and a good number of brown nosers.  
---
They need help IMHO..   
---
We had a much much better suggestion for how to handle the TS(E) rebalance..   
---
I guess this is my attempt to have them prove me wrong, and show someone out there is doing more than giving us lip service, and will take the offered helping hand. 
---
As someone who had their mule account banned, and never duped or crafted anything on it. You don't know what you are talking about.
---
Mules were never against the tos nor were they ever against any online mmo. Get with the picture jack ass. If mules were illegal every mmo would have banned them.
---
7k??!
---
They‚Äôre just over 5500 with hard bargain and 10 char &lt;.&lt;
---
Is that their default price?!
---
Fyi, it needs 17 adhesive and aluminium
---
15(?) nuclear material
---
5ea purple and blue flux
---
I like the game. And the developers are only human and make mistakes, and sometimes they have to do what they are told by someone who doesn't know what they are doing. So I will complain sometimes and let my opinion and frustration out, but there's something about the game that I really like, and I know it has potential to be so much more and I hope they listen and focus more on letting people have fun doing what they enjoy to do in the game, and stop trying to limit how fast people can progress if they want to go fast let them. If they want to farm for hours for XP in the best XP spot, or farm caps in the best caps stash, let them. They are playing the game and having fun. Take it away and they are not having fun any more.
---
even god could not speak truer words
---
God(s) and Devils I'd kill for a Real Raider set of "worlds"...   
---
I mean MadMax level of barbarism...
---
That‚Äôs still a minor issue next to crashes, instabilities, duping and other exploits, and countless other purely quality of life fixes needing to be implemented.
---
I do because like i said they are also banning mule accounts just for carry hundreds of thousands of pounds even if that account has never duped.
---
Since you want to bring up irrelevant things, tell me what exactly Hitler actually did? Cause in my history books, I learned Hitler convinced a lot of people to do everything for him, he himself...he spoke. 
---
I made a t51b jetpack yesterday but kind of forgot. IIRC it's most of the usual PA crafting stuff...around 20 steel, aluminum, screws, etc. It needed a few rarer materials too, I think asbestos and nuclear material. Also 5x each of cobalt and violet flux
---
Ive been playing since launch. I stopped playing with new patch and wont be playing again until they fix their shit and actually ADD content 
---
Why do you care if people enjoy a game you don't? Why would try to convince them to not play it? Is our of jealousy? Spite? I just don't understand how some people who don't enjoy this game can't let it go and move on? 
---
Give up please god
---
Thanks, I appreciate it!
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that all complaints will be a strike against your account that will permanently bar you from enjoying fallout 76.
---
You could have said less.
---
You still don't know what you are talking about, because I didn't have hundreds of thousands of pounds.
---
a game is a product, btw..      in any case, here's to outer worlds!
---
It really bums me out that it seems the community is doing more work to fix this game than the people who made it. I play this game a ton and have over 200 hrs on it but honestly this is just getting old and you can blame the devs for this becaise they are just doing what they are told they can do. They need to (like it has been mentioned before) quit worrying about putting out new content and actually work on fixing what is already there. Adding in atom store items and such is like putting fancy rims on a 500 dollar rust bucket of a car, it looks neat but the actual car is barely working.
---
I've got one. Offer?
---
Yep, was looking forward to ES6 but now I‚Äôm afraid of what the game is going to be. Especially since they are gonna USE THE SAME FUCKING ENGINE FOR ES6 THAT THEY DID WITH FO4 AND FO76.
---
Seems doable. Which jetpack is that? Do they take different materials? The different model 
---
Is the game buggy? Yes. Unfinished? No. That's like saying Vanilla WoW was unfinished because they had to make constant balance fixes and add more content as time went on.
---
Though I haven't played in a few days, I've got 200 hours in and really enjoyed my time with it. I'm taking a break until they fix energy weapons and balance enemies better so they aren't all bullet sponges,  but I plan on playing again. As the guy above said,  it's fun. That's all that matters to me. 
---
As far as I understand accounts are 'flagged' automatically but whether to ban or not is decided by humans. That is why it takes some time to ban someone. Trust me, no devs would ever let the machines do all the job. Think of the all the backlash when things go wrong
---
This is pre patch, I had one the other day actually that I got on a recording I was making of my CAMP, I clearly killed it, went into a different room in my CAMP and within 30 seconds I went to go loot it but its body simply wasnt there (I even checked the recording to make sure I was looking in the right place)
---
I've avoided using flux but I guess I'll figure out how it all works
---
Also, do not speak on things you vaguely ‚Äúfeel‚Äù. Bethesda‚Äôs newly acquired team in Austin is handling 76 while others work on starfield etc. they are a relatively new team both to releasing games as well as handling this engine and fan base. These things take time.
---
They made it to where if you go to repair a gun or armor you have to manually break up bulked items to repair anything, this was done to preventing the loss of mods getting scrapped. 
---
 They also made quite a few changes that weren't listed in patch note which have taken all the fun out of the game.
---
I love that Bethesda nerfed the tse but you went too far! Now my tse handmade is like using a pipe pistol 
---
All use the same materials
---
I have T-45 / 51b / 60
---
All were the same iirc
---
&gt; If it were a total, complete, and utter failure, you wouldn't have been able to play 3 characters to high levels. Give credit where its due.
---
Lmao. By this ass-backwards logic, since you can finish Superman64 or Bubsy3D, they deserve more credit than they get.
---
Bullshit. You don't give them credit for the bare minimum of making the game semi-functional. Maybe you got your copy for free or something but $60 is a AAA pricetag, and you expect higher standards, specially when games like Warframe and Fortnite deliver better and are F2P.
---
&gt; So sick of this outrage movement
---
That was entirely caused by Bethesda in how the fail to fix the game and how they act outside of it with their responses. 5 years ago Rockstar had similar issues with GTAO in regards to cheaters, exploits and inbalancing issues, but you know why they never got laughed at by everyone? Because they actually worked on fixing the game as quickly as they could while bethesda takes one step forward to go 3 steps back, all the while shilling trinket items in-game and in their merch stores for exaggerated prices, which heavily implies they just want to milk fans instead of redeem themselves. 
---
&gt; You know what's a complete and utter failure? Halflife 3. Not this.
---
This makes no sense. HL3 has never been released. You cannot qualify something that hasn't been made.
---
By your logic anything that doesn't exist is terrible, like Bethesda's sense of urgency towards their fans.
---
actually i think the last patch brought back the crafting bench dupe. I dont know for sure thouhg. It brought back a lot of old bugs though.
---
Somethings aren‚Äôt there fusion cores for example. Which could very well of not existed originally but came in a mid tier patch, idk it‚Äôs been three months and I don‚Äôt have a good memory. I just based my findings off the fact the power armor glitch now exists again, that was patched in versions 1.3.0 so if it exits, our version has to be from 1.2.0 or earlier, before it was patched.
---
Just proves it wasn't a complete copy and paste of FO 4 like people say tho right?
---
Honestly, they never had a chance. They were ordered to make the Creation Engine, and ancient, buggy mess of a single player RPG base, into an MMORPG. It's a minor miracle it works at all.
---
Agree theres already class action lawsuits against them for other shit. This is illegal under eu law.
---
Semantics, by the way. I'm guessing you knew what I meant. If not, cool. Good  luck.
---
Not if i have anything to say about it, and i do! Im gonna say the n word
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you to write up an essay to explain how you enjoying the game is any of our concern.
---
That went through my mind when I wrote it. I was like damn almost got to meme haha
---
Actually it was never fully fixed
---
Don't you know? Civil-war era weapons do WAY more damage than modern science.
---
i have 2 hrs in and this is the best game i've ever played, why all the youtube hate?
---
Need i remind you jackasses bethesda leaked your info out a month ago. 
---
I even have the perk that self-repairs the weapon when there's a hit. 
---
I don't know. It could be the extra shots. 
---
Yea.. that one time where after farming whitespring for hours ( that is endgame in F76 ) i was down to 15 diluted stimpacks .. like I said in the first post .. you really have to read the hole thing before making comments .. you look a bit silly üôÑ
---
most games are like 12 bucks on g2a
---
We appreciate you guys, you seem to be able to fix the game better than the actual owners. Hopefully it works out for you and Bethesda reaches out... 
---
My thoughts exactly dude well said and thanks for taking your time to voice your opinion
---
Im on this sub to see when the game has met an acceptable standard to be a full game, non of my friends nor me have purchased. One of my friends was tempted by the huge price drops but we all told him not to yet
---
The first sign for us that it wasnt worth getting was that there were no plans on a steam launch
---
Well I‚Äôm already no enjoying it because I‚Äôm walking around with 1000 weight and no way to manage it because my stash is now completely screwed with weight issues. I have a max carry weight of 240 and on a good day never travel around with more than 120 weight on me. So going from a daily weight of 120 to being stuck with 1000 is less than enjoyable.
---
Its been checked its illegal in the eu sorry you cant get your justice boner. 
---
Someone posted a video showing that's likely not the case - though I can't say for certain. I wouldn't be surprised if instead it just restored some previously valid (if always sloppy) automatic exploit detection standards.
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that this is how all players should behave. 
---
Getting caught in a nuke blast makes you hungry
---
cool story, don‚Äôt care.
---
Just to be clear, you promise not to post any more about Fallout, right?
---
&gt;Ms will ban your Xbox account if you link open on Skype
---
What does this mean?
---
she or he or they are the only reason I havent quit yet.
---
You do understand the moral of the story tho right? You aren't as smart as you think you are.
---
Explain this video where the fallout moderators are closing down threads and banning accounts for criticism. 
---
https://youtu.be/4Gi5wFirRQI
---
It's so telling how they never answer posts like yours 
---
Add fireproof rank 2 and dense torso mod. Never a problem with tse.
---
Do you remember that post about the guy whose girlfriend had to leave to go to college on the east coast or something?   she bought the game for her boyfriend (the op) so they could play together...   guy legit thanking bethesda for saving his relationship got like 5k upvotes..         i actually frequent this subreddit because i want to know what bogus public relations / damage control shills look like.
---
I don‚Äôt continue. The last few patches rat fucked the game. 
---
What power armor glitch? The one for getting into locked areas?
---
Not sure if it has been mentioned yet, but white spring bunker / modus only takes one customer at a time now and only at the middle terminal... outer 2 are always busy.
---
Ha you got what you deserved. Maybe they frown on mules and your history was good enough to ban. Remember this is only a 60 experience. You can‚Äôt demand the rate content is added. That doesn‚Äôt have to do much with you but true
---
&gt; but as someone else pointed out, Bethesda has a binding arbitration clause in their TOS
---
Ohh... scary. It's not like that isn't the most frequently disregarded clause that gets thrown out all the time because the very idea that a company could render civil courts powerless before them by basically wagging their finger at all customers, saying "No, no you want do business with us you agree before that we can do anything and you no sue us" is absolutely laughable.
---
30+ minutes is a little much for me. Just waste way too much ammo and supplies for little reward. Probably looking at well over 1000 rounds of ammo at that point. 
---
The problem is she's designed for 8+ players, but getting that many players who are actually capabale of damaging her seems to be a rarity these days. 
---
Sure they are different teams, but hear me out here, maybe have them work ahead at their pace and stop releasing stuff to that atom store for a bit. If you look at it from my side here I feel robbed and like you are laughing to thar bank at my expense. There is an important quote to remember here and that is customer trust is hard won, easily lost, and almost impossible to regain. The longer you apparently seem to miss my POV as the customer and keep me feeling like this not only endangers FO76 but right now I'm totally rethinking buying TES or anything else you're putting out especially with this dated engine.
---
Right now I'm sure I won't preorder from Bethesda again. If I buy TES or another Bethesda game it wont be the special editions I normally would have bought. And honestly Im on the fence of ever buying from Bethesda again.
---
Please take a lesson, think of your customer first and know the profit will follow.
---
OOTL what happened with the latest patch?
---
So I won‚Äôt be moved? If so, you‚Äôre a complete lifesaver. Any idea where to get a dense mod for marine armor?
---
My teammayes' quests are still on my screen an hour after he logged out.

Todd Howard here, reminding you that our recycling bin is full and any other support tickets will get rejected.

I wasn't complaining, just correcting a smug idiot.
---
need to be wrong to be corrected
---
It‚Äôs a fucking joke you nimrod 
---
Why?
---
Unless he deleted it already I don't see anything showing he's a duper. He might well be and this could be a post that's just trying to get sympathy but I also don't see anything on Reddit that would prove he actually duped.
---
I craft marine tactical helmets that same way, just to go around to vendors and sell them. Here‚Äôs hoping they don‚Äôt drop the banhammer on me.
---
I have a soft spot for exactly what this game provides. I've wanted it for close to ten years now, and the different FOnline sessions have been the closest things to fill that gap. I find it fun to just run around the map trying different gear, finding cool stuff to try out, rolling the dice with legendary drops. I have around 200 hours in the game now, and am playing it only because I enjoy it. It's nothing about trying to get my money's worth or justifying some mentality. 
---
The thing is it's two completely different stories to come here, watch videos about the game, etc, and actually play it. It's also just up to chance. Sometimes shit works, sometimes it doesn't. After the patch yesterday I went to the vendors, got some cool power armor plans, made myself a pimped out jetpack set, and then went over to a nearby city just to get the damage bug. In case you're not aware, that is the one where any damage dealt by your guns is completely regenerated by enemies after a few seconds, even if it takes their health down to 1. There is absolutely nothing you can do about it other than leave the server because it will persist until you do. It is gamebreaking and was a massive issue the community was vocal about for months. It got fixed recently...but guess what, this update added it again. So that was around a half hour of gameplay, most of which was spent in menus, until I hit a gamebreaking bug.
---
I said I was going to take a break for a while after that but decided to come back for a little bit since they announced a hotfix is on the way. 2 or 3 hours with no bugs whatsoever. Actually a rather enjoyable experience. It's that kind of time that makes you come back, and the other kind that makes you come to forums and subreddits writing an essay on why bethesda should fire their current developers
---
What the actual fuck are you trying to say? I don't understand stupid.
---
Dense+fireproof+the nerfs. I crafted 80 minis put on demo expert Ord Express dodgy dense fireproof etc...went to town. Only down side is repairing the launcher every 20 minis. Damage was showing around 1,047 per shot.
---
clarity is a good thing, right mind, right action, right speech, my dude.
---
That's rich .. a noob that rely on aimbot telling me what is fun or not. I think vats is the biggest cheat of them all and I would still need to farm xp for a week if i suddenly should get batteriets included and concentrated fire. I played since beta .. i used crap weapons for a Long time when i was a n00b like you. I love a good challenge thats why i Play survival. I don't enjoy serverhopping around for lead and plastic.. capiche?
---
The explosive nerf was to huge at first I could farm white springs just fine and didn‚Äôt have to fix my gun every single time I went around the area in a circle. I even have the gunsmith perk maxed. 
---
A fix for what, specifically?
---
used for switches and lights, maybe a couple other things
---
/r/KenM
---
Cap Collector no longer works, at level 3 cap collector I have found 5 or 6 cap stashes and never been given the option to "search" any of them for more caps
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that the current patch is a fix that messed up perk cards that affect weight carried.
---
thanks
---
What does this add extra carry weight?
---
Uhhhh... no? Why should the lower damage weapon do less armor pen than the higher damage weapon?
---
I‚Äôm a Jew, that‚Äôs a bad joke.
---
You know FO was originally an Obsidian IP right?
---
Yes that‚Äôs why they having to rush out a emergency hot fix now ....cause it was so great lmao ...  your delusional
---
Boy that‚Äôs awkward when somebody lays out an explanation that you know is wrong. I‚Äôm like damn, where did that come from and why did they just lie?
---
Good luck.
---
there's a lot more to sentinel than just the armor itself. how many pieces have sentinel? what about assassin? do you have dodgy? adamantium skeleton? fireproof + dense? what's your total DR?
---
Well boo hoo go throw yourself a pity party then
---
Radaway and Decontamination chamber have the same effect on curing mutations, and almost everyone knows that for a nuke zone you don‚Äôt even have to fight in the nuke zone and if you go in for the flora not even any Rad-X at all is nearly necessary. None of that was a lie. 
---
I don‚Äôt use perk cards involving weight carried. A plethora of items have had their weight values changed across the board between ammo junk aid gear all weight values have been altered, more than just Bobby pins.
---
adds 10 weight per piece you add it to, normal pockets add 5
---
Lol, I would bet a million dollars if I had it, that you are a Democrat. Never wrong!
---
I use a Prime Gatling Gun for Scorchbeasts.
---
Harpoon Gun as a Sniper Rifle.
---
Minigun and .50 Cal for DPS.
---
Gatling Laser for Weak Enemies.
---
Gatling Plasma to show off.
---
Flamer and Cryolator for close-range.
---
MG42 to burn through scrap ammunition.
---
Always keep one melee weapon on hand for when you're backed into a corner. The game sometimes glitches hitboxes with Heavy Weapons because of their length.
---
Don't waste time with Explosives (Fat Man, Missile Launcher, Auto Grenade Launcher, etc.) They're too heavy with too much weight for ammunition. Weight Reduction Perks are a waste of Perk Space.
---
Heavy Weapons Build works best with Power Armor, since a lot of perks group the two together (Ie: Stabilized).
---
Try to Max out Strength and Intelligence, and put 6 into Luck for Bloody Mess and One Gun Army.
---
Bear Arms is a Lifesaver Strength Perk (I have a full weapon wheel, and weigh ~60lbs with Bear Arms as my only weight reduction perk).
---
Keep at least 50lbs of your stash free to store ammunition, and take only about 1000 Rounds for your weapon at most. It'll probably break before you can fire more, and the chances of you running out of ammunition before reaching another stash box is very slim.
---
To grind for ammunition, use Super Duper (Luck) and Ammosmith (Agility) and slam down The Steel Plant and the Prison. Scrap every weapon and collect everything, and you'll have enough ammunition to stockpile for days (Provided you get the lead). 5mm and .50 Cal have an advantage in manufacturing, since you make SO MUCH.
---
Tl;Dr: No weapon is superior. It depends on your play style and perks. Avoid Explosive Weapons, pour all your SPECIAL into Strength and Intelligence, rock Power Armor, and take every perk that maximizes your damage. 
---
I‚Äôll just...throw myself into a fire.
---
Lmao! (You are)
---
What‚Äôs the split inventory thing? It‚Äôs not pulling from my stash when I‚Äôm at my camp anymore?
---
Just a(nother) shout out that I am grateful for your work hand the help provided for the entire community. 76 will definitely be diminished without you if/when you leave.
---
Thx I have the chest piece
---
I wouldn‚Äôt stop you
---
I have assassin's and cavalier not full set but neither would've applied here anyway. Only perks that would've procced here would be dodgy fireproof and the dense chest mod.
---
Maybe this isn't the game for you. I hear Call of Duty is a fun shooter.
---
Guess what... Imma pirate the fuck outta there shit!!
---
Here is a thought:  Fixing the FatMan might help sell more of those skins for it in the shop... 
---
Good luck, and they'll take a month to unban you for their mistake.
---
I  **/u/** [LoneVaultWanderer](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alie1l/hotfix_coming_for_issues_introduced_in_patch_5/efebo9z/?context=1000) , I was wondering if this issue is going to be adressed.
---
\- The difference between weight in pip-boy and the map for fast travel. The fast travel take the map number.
---
\- Having 3 or more charisma and the shared card is removed in a matter of seconds. (I have 3 cha, 2 with mutation when unmodified condition)
---
I haven't tried full auto in a few weeks so it my be fixed now
---
Most of the people post that type of... Post (excuse my redundancy) because they feel betrayed and let down by Bethesda. I myself feel that way, from the canvas bag, the drop to 35 bucks just days after release, the lack of responses(neither Todd nor Pete has done any interview since release) and bug fixes. So maybe, that type of post is them(or we(?)) Trying to let Bethesda know they failed, so they maybe can fix the game OR AT LEAST not fucking up starfield or TESVI. 
---
They killed the black market for dupers by nerfing their favorite OP toy.
---
I hear really great things about Rust. 
---
1) PC, GTX 1050, 16gb ram, I7, Windows 10, all drivers up to date.
---
2) agentvermont
---
3) The launcher loads to the main screen with no issue.  When I hit play, it goes to the world found please stand by, and then crashes to the desktop.  Every single time.  This only has occurred since the latest wonderful patch.  I did all the canned FAQ responses, and I've had no luck getting into the game.  But from what I've been reading about the patch, that may be a good thing.
---
 5) **190130-005397** 
---
Well not necessarily a glitch. An unintended stat value. Excavator armor was inherently giving 200 more carry weight than it should. It was patched OUT in update 1.3.0 
---
Excavator armor is now back to giving its unintended bonus carry weight, which was present in version 1.2.0 and earlier.
---
This comment makes me want to break my back it‚Äôs so confusing 
---
I think the Atom Store (to be clear not defending it) shows how fractured the company is, not unlike most other businesses.  
---
The Marketing arm keeps chugging away with adds for products that died in production, or were phased out until told otherwise.  
---
Yes it would be flipping awesome to see all of their attention turned towards JUST fixing what's wrong, and then and only then try and sell us a link frilly caste bed (really, who is doing your focus groups / community pulse stuff... A Race car bed? But hell im sure some people loved it).  
---
Known that's not going to happen I'm just ignoring the Atom Store, in all its frilly glory, until I can play the game with a clean conscience.
---
While they can kind of legally do this because of the TOS, this is complete bullshit. I would just pirate every game from Bethesda for eternity or just never play another one because the company is way past its prime and their current games suck anyway. I've lost all faith and I will never pre-order a game from any company again.
---
I love seeing all these posts, fuck that game, waste of time, money, and space on my hard drive. 
---
Nicely done once again. Thx!
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that rolling back to the previous patch is different from rolling back to the base game to fix bugs.
---
Even the low level ones are good cuz u can just equip it to use for extra carry weight 
---
Mules are common in online games for storing items you don't want to hold in a bank or on a particular character. They have never been exploits.
---
Seriously, play any MMO and people will tell you they have mule characters. I know I do.
---
Haha that's funny appreciate u sharing that's a reflex I definitely understand! Seriously though I call it the TSF Shotty(2 shot Fatman shotgun) it's actually a viable weapon now.
---
Yeah I was wondering why that was happening. 
---
Thus the statement...they patched an older version of the game...and furthermore Bethesda admitting to that in their post.
---
If you've got over 600 hours, it's probably a good time to take a break anyway. There can't be much left to do. 
---
Hot fix...to fix the unintended errors that occurred. Like Bobby pins weren't in the patch notes but had been accidentally reverted to their old weight so they're fixing that. It's not like they're hotfixing the entire update 5... 
---
Hence the 'if' at the beginning of the sentence.
---
I need it for my enclave outpost C.A.M.P
---
But! Does the rum weight 250kg or glitch through walls? Does the jacket disappear if you exit a building. That is due to testing. :)
---
In all seriousness, if you don't play it, go away and stop trolling us. 
---
Wouldn't be a game to help fix without Bethesda..   
---
But seriously thanks, and apparent hubris aside some of us just want to help, it's not about doing things better, it's about getting things fixed.
---
My gatling plasma died out in 2 mags worth. I realized it was not the weapon for me.
---
Yep.
---
I just play it like a regular fallout game. I don‚Äôt pay attention to the nerfs, I do the build I feel like doing and don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs not the ‚Äúbest‚Äù.
---
I try to ignore the negativity here, mostly because I can pick apart literally any other game like people do here, but I choose to just have fun instead and accept the bugs/issues. It‚Äôs nothing new, every other Bethesda game has them.
---
Is that the TSE? I meant non-legendary. But if that's non-legendary then no idea how exactly it's calculated.
---
I support you ! 
---
I just want a refund for it, but no I downloaded it so I got denied, so I filled out an econsumer complaint, a day ago. 
---
That was from weapons that don't shoot bullets at all, it wasn't about how the second bullet is magically created.
---
I loved doing that...then the towns would hit my fps horribly so I'd dedicate just one settlement as my personal home with all the bells and whistles...But then I'd want vendors at my home, but vendors need a bed, proper housing, a bar/restaurant to take a load off, defenses, nice clothing and weapons, oh god I made another town! My fps!
---
So, I'd find another empty settlement for a player home, then BAM! Another town. Had to download a housing mod where I couldn't do that anymore. Lol
---
I wanna play fo4 now.
---
I‚Äôm not 100% the date I got the excavation armor, but it‚Äôs always functioned like this for me. It‚Äôs never worked as intended.
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that in order to fix current bugs we had to revert previous changes to solve incampatiablity issues. That is why the weight you think you have is not the weight you think you have.
---
I do it with EA... Bethesda just joined the club
---
I was so disappointed in the tommy gun. Thought I found a real treat, but then I realized I've tossed out weapons with higher damage than that. 
---
Man this just keeps getting better and better.
---
This game is getting worse and worse. This last patch was especially shit
---
Had that happen once and it turned out I was standing on the bag. 
---
Thanks buddy.   
---
Not trying to be "that guy" with another "I'm leaving" post, but as of yesterday I literally cannot play the game (long story), so all that's left to me is trying one last time to help fix it.  
---
Hears to one more voice howling at the moon.
---
Last night many of my friends were upset about the changes, and specifically about the increase in grinding that will be required to maintain ammo and repairs.
---
Tonight I played for two hours....alone.  I didn't see any of my friends on.  Looks like I have a single player game now for however long I stay.
---
Totally
---
Yeah, i'm the defensive one, lol, keep projecting.
---
It better be fucking cumming! 
---
Todd Howard here, reminding us plenty and that 500 atoms were given to people who spent more money on the game.

I'm using the escavator armor, no change for me it always did the 100 thing till you exit but that's post 1.2 as well.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if activision was pushing this stuff out there to take the heat of blizzard who has been doing much worse of late.
---
I am the exact opposite, but nevertheless it would be cool to see and would be a paradigm shift in online gaming.
---
As long its 1000 or less atoms this would be great
---
Seems it‚Äôs like a good thing I waited till February. I saw that the new patch was disappointing, so I‚Äôll think I‚Äôm going to pass, enjoy your wasteland adventures!
---
Graham has the best plans
---
Lol well...it's good and bad. I call it my TSF shotty-2 shot Fatman shotgun-and while it's awesome(I crafted 80 minis(ammosmith plus super duper) last craft session)-with Ord Express it's not a big deal, but it's bad that this even POSSIBLE. It is in fact as OP as the old TSE though fwiw
---
Maybe they should put in a dial (or slide liek when your transfering more than 5 items) that lets me select how many of said items I can afford / want to make , so I don‚Äôt have to spam space bar to make a few real quick. I have also been making weapons to scrap and maybe fortunately for me I‚Äôve been low of resources and having to break down bulked 
---
True, the TOS is a joke that's not funny, but if he's got to deal with the legal system.. ya gotta start somewhere. 
---
All pieces are sentinel + assassin. No to dodgy, no adamantium skeleton, I just got fireproof, trying to get dense, and I can‚Äôt check my DR right now because I‚Äôm not on.
---
Bye felicia. See you when the first dlc drops for free.
---
I might be alone here, but I‚Äôd really like to see new characters, and no legendaries. Just vanilla weapons and armor. I know that sounds crazy, but i feel like it could really make the PvP more skill based. 
---
If that was the case they shouldve just kept it 100% and made it so it only works on real explosive weapons and not the legendary affix. Even without it I'm still 1 shotting all enemies besides SBs and now the MQ takes 2 shots.
---
I'm just pointing out that for TSE weapon users that perk is trash now and normal explosive weapons damage is so bad that hardly anyone uses them anyways unless they are RPing something so it makes the perk useless aka broken.
---
Yes and...? I e never used refit until FO76 I'd known how toxic it was and didn't really care for it. With a multiplayer game it made sense to get into it. What is your paranoid delusion, that I work for Beth? Maybe you should read some of the things I've posted, I somehow doubt that would be the things a paid voice would post. But given the insane, self delusional things I've read here I'm sure you'll find a way to twist into whatever bogeyman you want it to be. 
---
Boo! 
---
Lmao
---
Where in the ToS does it say "Don't take dropped items" ?
---
Lol I stopped playing fallout 76 in December. Assassins creed Odyssey is great. 
---
I haven't gotten a single stash over 19 caps with Cap Collector 3. =(
---
Totally, and I'd love just about as much, to see the gleaming perfection of a rebuilding Wasteland...  
---
I'm a conflicted Raider at heart, wrecking the things I secretly love.
---
Todd Howard here, reminding you that who gets banned is decided by unpaid Indian interns who look at excel spreadsheet all day.
---
&gt;Tries to defuse the situation
---
&gt;Gets downvoted 
---
Nah I'm more of a RPG kind of guy. Not that it matters tho as your comment is just a baseless assumption but just for you to know :)
---
I know that having a gun do insane damage to a player not in PVP is a bad thing, but taking the fun out of finding something as ludicrous as an Instigating Incendiary Explosive Combat Shotgun is not the solution. What about just negating added effects against players not flagged for PVP?
---
You have very limited understanding of the implications of yesterday‚Äôs patch, I‚Äôm not going to even agree to disagree on your post.
---
and yet some people here will continue to defend this company and their stunts to death, no matter what they'll do.  
---
sucks to hear it man, real shame if you wanted to play other games on your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) client.... lol
---
I don't believe you and I'm not surprised they don't either. Not saying your lying, but you had to anticipate there was risk to what you are doing.
---
Logically you could just be using the hate bandwagon to try to trick them into giving you access back. I think a fair compromise would be to wipe your 76 account and let you start again fresh.
---
When the flower challenge makes you loose 40 atoms each week , kinda feel like this is by design 
---
That sucks. Maybe it's just that there are two separate values that make me feel like it's on average higher cause before I feel like the perk didn't make a difference 
---
The quest is active but there's no blip or marker telling me where my dropped loot is. Even when I went to disable the quest and track it again, nothing changed. There wasn't any marker any where on my map or task bar.
---
It was worth a shot. First time I‚Äôve ever actually got negative downvotes on a comment as well so I‚Äôm actually kinda glad to experience negative downvotes for once.
---
I honeatly feel the internet is what made games so good but also makes them so terrible. Now they can push out a game and say "oops! We forgot _insert_generic_response_" and add it in to a patch. I feel the quality control is and obviously is terrible, and it makes me wonder if these devs or sales people even test these patches before launching it. I dont want weekly patches if every other one resets it. It also seems that at the rate bethesda is going with all of this we shouldnt expect a playable dlc for awhile. I have such high hopes for this game and honestly want nothing more to see it grow but developers and the people who actually make these games and know how they work should be in charge of what happens to them. They need an actual team scouring these subs and everywhere else for anything they can fix and pass it on. I have seen so many grand ideas on here that would be perfect for the game or even lore of this game but all the sales people over at bethesda wish to do is more fuckery and keep pushing whatever they please. This game WILL be dead by the end of the year at latest if the people in charge dont either get replaced and put in positions with much less power AND they can make this game stable enough to actually trust running dlc on it. Its getting disappointing and i cant even defend this game anymore. Its a punch in the gut from what i thought was one of the last great gaming companies. I cant see myself reccomending this game at all whatsoever in its current state to even my worst enemy.
---
The game has basically become what we know West Virginia to be, a place with a few cool things that is slowly petering out
---
I have defended the game as best as I can but I think it will be a while before I jump back in. I am at level 68, so I have put some time into it, but not as much as some other people. I love this series and I will keep hoping for the best.
---
What do you think muleing is? 
---
Downvoted for being honest. People hate hard truths on this sub. They can't handle it. 
---
Lol it‚Äôs like a milestone for you , and for s silly reason aswell 
---
PS4 here sorry. Sounds like a great idea. Hope it works out. Good luck.
---
That‚Äôs over 316 days
---
Few hundred is nothing if you are keeping 1 star crap.  I was pulling 50-70 in 2-3 hours at white run.
---
And you must be a r/t_d user for somehow making a conversation about anything else be about political opinions... 
---
*checks profile*
---
*unsurprised face*
---
Honestly? I gave up. All my friends gave up months ago when keys bought 3rd party were flagged as pirated copies by Bethesda. But I stuck with it. Until this last patch. The level of apathetic incompetency astounded me, and without any real friends to stick it out with, I finally caved and just deleted the game off my HDD altogether. I don't need this. I have a limited amount of fucks to give out, and I can't afford to give one here anymore. 
---
Anyway, I certainly could use the disk space for something more complete... like a Steam early access title.
---
Sure he "didnt cheat" ... /s
---
Yeah so harvesting garbage is a hundred percent playing the role of a post apocalyptic survivor.
---
Desparate forced meme is desparate and forced
---
Upvote for effort, I‚Äôd just add I‚Äôd like to see a 6.5 Creedmoor sniper to get this long shots in
---
Seems like you have very little understanding of how important yesterday's patch was for moving forward. But what would I know you're probably a salty tse user. 
---
I like standing in a crowd with my vampiric explosive double barrel just watching my HP bob up and down while I blast the fools in the knee caps. I end every combat encounter at full health now... full repair though...oh well it's a blast
---
Oh did you believe that WoW was actually a role playing game?
---
People wanted condition..   but I had to repair both of my melee weapons several times each over the course of an hour of farming. The material sink kills the fun. 
---
I like it.
---
Right?I‚Äôve experienced high karma posts, low karma posts, low karma comments and high karma comments. Finally some people hate my opinion enough to give me some negative karma on a comment. Honestly not complaining/
---
I've always seen them as rule bending but a harmless one and normally dependable when used fairly. Now using a mule to hold what he admitted was dupped and exploit items for later does sound like cheating/ violation of terms.
---
I do agree that the TSE weapons as a whole, especially the TSE shotgun were OP AF (yes I was 1 shotting a lot of mobs) I was able to run a very minimalist rifleman build. I ran with only 1 perk in rifleman, expert rifleman, and Master rifleman. Soon dropped Demo expert and some other perks.
---
I replaced them with QoL perks and it was a good balance IMO.  I would have to shoot 2 sometimes 3 shots to kill lvl 62 mobs and was able to explore without all the hunger/thirst issues. Also wt management was ok since I took a few of those.
---
I would break out the pure dps build only for the SBQ and would likely shoot 200 rounds at her per fight.
---
I just think a 80% drop was too far. A smaller drop to 50% TS 50% Explosive and not touching Demo expert would been fine, and could have been adjusted later without destroying people builds.
---
Maybe move Explosive into the TS tier so you cannot have both.
---
At the very least when doing a nerf like this give people a respec so we can do research and adjust.  The way this was handled i just feel like the rug was pulled out from under us with the shear DPS drop this patch caused.
---
My build was not designed to be a OP God! It was a build that gave me pretty good power but eliminated the most annoying parts of the game so I could explore and do quests, help people as needed.
---
Now I have to inventory micro manage TF out everything and it just feels like a chore now.
---
Well look at fallout 4! They are recreating fallout 3 in fallout 4.
---
We have no proof op isn't lying to try to get reddit opinion to undo a just ban.
---
&gt; He doesn‚Äôt magically own the rights to the software now that he paid for the disc it came on. It‚Äôs still wholly owned by the creators.
---
That's beside the point: you're still allowed pop some TSwift album disc into your PC and run its contents even if you don't just so happen to be the massive media giant that owns the rights to the actual IP.
---
You should start your own post, because you're an idiot. 
---
Nice
---
Hundreds of comments a day? Ummm, no. First. I have a rather busy job AND a life, I dont post on any other area of reddit because I dont be long to any other. Better look again at my profile  son.  I dont have all that many posts at all and the bulk of them aren't praising the game they're calling out BS, like you. As I proved in my post, I dont get to have an opinion if it goes against the hard. Well, sorry, you're sorry ass TSEs are nerfed, deal with it. 
---
Jesus Christ people are STILL hung up over the Beta schedule?  It was NOT "weird".  It was a fucking Beta and NOT Early Access.  That's what a Beta schedule fucking looks like.
---
Being really arrogant and also really wrong, are just common traits I've noticed most share. Was just making a guess, wasn't about a political opinion, more so your demeanor.
---
You certainly did try! Thanks for caring enough to do that.
---
And yeah, there‚Äôs bigger issues going on right now with this cray ol‚Äô patch. We‚Äôll figure it out eventually.
---
I haven't played in a month; what's changed. 
---
It does not take longer for new players to reach endgame, the big changes to EXP gain were only for players over level 50 where the scaling was totally fucked and you could get at least 5 levels a night just fucking around.
---
Either way not going to happen. 
---
I can tell you right now that he reached that point around hour 100. The ability to create a god mode character is the main thing that kept players around and Beth killed that off. 
---
A lot of people have been sharing that something has likely gone wrong with the stealth detection change in the patch, so it's not just you.
---
I had that yesterday and yeah the quest was active but not showing a marker,  seems latest patch came with more bugs.. I wonder what bugs they actually fixed... 
---
Or you know .... Don't cheat in the game when you know they are banning people for cheating in the game 
---
They're making a patch very soon that fixes what's wrong with this one
---
I hav me had it where I died and it look about 10mins of lag before the marker appeared. I‚Äôd given it up for dead, then it popped up
---
Went back, bam, junk &lt;.&lt;
---
Fort defiance, top floors.
---
I walked out with 8 bags which gives 16 fiber and i wasn't even through
---
That is the non legendary damage base. And according to Bathesda it's supposed to be calculated exactly how I'm doing the math. 
---
The problem is it's not doing it in the game. 
---
Mole miners gear breaks down to Ballistic Fiber I think.
---
The WK nerf isn't to bad but the demo nerf is a joke
---
Not true. Assassin's creed suffered from pumping out generic or even outright money grabbing games, and they saw sales plummet. 
---
What did they do? Took some time off, reevaluated the product, and came back with a modernized product that has seen a revitalization of the series. Ubisoft is frankly becoming a masterclass in how to revive your brand after some bad judgement calls. 
---
Hah, I preordered and didn't last a week :/
---
Are you saying this before or after reading that they said what happened, are working to make sure it doesn't happen again, and are issuing another patch to fix what reverted in the coming days? Not asking to be patronizing. Asking to see if you know about said coming patch. 
---
Click on my second link, it's almost exactly that, a "round up" that people pile onto, adding things we've missed and it's what prompted a look into the Targeting HUD and a potential fix.  
---
Not going to comment on staffing, as I've got no clue..  
---
I just want exactly what you said, a way to find the problems and pass them up...   
---
And have them fixed, not next month, or next quarter.. Now.
---
And there is the problem.  Unless someone directly witnesses an object being duplicated, they can not know for certain weather or not it is duplicated. 
---
He grabbed bags from dupers, but you know what? there's no way to tell weather the items in the bags were source, or dupe product. Even Bethesda themselves cant tell, or they'd just purge the duped items from he database and be done with it.
---
At this point, the duped items have proliferated the game economy so far that unless you yourself have gotten a rare loot drop of a legendary item, I'd suspect it from any other source to be duped.
---
And since Bethesda refuses to update to modern software, there will be no way to tell, so you might as well either assume everything is duped, or everything is original, and act accordingly.
---
Personally, I prefer to lean towards Original, cause otherwise I'd be throwing away everything with a legendary star, and that just doesn't make sense. 
---
You and I both...But it probably will be. Only the Atomic Shop is getting actual brand new stuff (which isn't saying much when it's just a new paint job or outfit), along with rehashed fo4 assets.
---
There is.. you just can't see it
---
Because I like the game and playing it with friends.
---
Not trying to be extremely negative but ever since releasing fallout 76 I‚Äôve lost all faith in Bethesda. I bought fallout 76 for the full 60 at launch and i honestly feel like the game shouldve been FTP. Theres so many bugs and issues that we didnt see in fallout 4 that literally ruin the game. Im not believing anything Bethesda says from here on out and even their new space game im gonna wait to buy until streamers and youtubers confirm its not another cash grab piece of trash. Again i love most Bethesda games im not trying to trash them but fuck what are you doing
---
honestly fuck that, just make respecing cost a flat 200 caps. their you go. no more levels needed, or even atoms.
---
I'm staying because I'm somehow lucky enough to not get any of the glitches and bugs this patch, or barely any bugs overall.
---
LOL
---
No way for them to trust your word. I agree that a wipe is fair, but if you have 100 friends duping there are bound to be more mules you are associated with by friends who will just give you back what you lost. In honesty you should have anticipated this and emptied the mule 2 weeks ago when they warned us the ban waves were coming.
---
CAMP is definitely what I got the most hours out of. It could be annoyingly grindy to unlock stuff, but it was fun when you finally did unlock stuff to graduate from a shitty little bare bones shack to experimenting with stuff. I found a spot on the side of a mountain I really liked near the Whitespring and the dried out lake, built myself a cabin and adjoining workshop I was happy with. At a certain point you run out of things to populate it with, or budget to build with, and once that was done I was just kind of like...eh.
---
Near every soldier skeleton. There should be an ammo bag 
---
Duh. But you‚Äôre not allowed to do *anything* you want with it. Just as with software, there are rules to your using it. 
---
1. PC
---
2. Zsinger3
---
3. I cannot repair armor or craft certain items despite having all criteria, perks and supplies.
---
4. N/A
---
What‚Äôs wrong with that anyway? 
---
If you enter an area and enemies have scaled too high just world hop and it almost always resets everything in the immediate area to your level range.
---
Lol 16k lbs is not legit
---
That's what I'm trying to say. Let us see the timer. 
---
It would be great, but still ppl would complain its money grab so.. for most it doesnt matter if u earn it thru game, it matters that u can buy it. So complain complain and so on..
---
And I've still got faith in the game, I don't mind waiting for the game to fix it's game because of the potential it'll have when it is
---
Thats what happens when you cheat or help cheaters cheat. 
---
Your excuse is weak. 
---
Something of an aside: Since you're just starting with it, I'll let you know that you can jump and the reduction remains in effect. For some reason jumping doesn't count as moving for the armor.
---
No its very common. Terms of service apply to your account and your legal name. Not a game.
---
Thank you. 
---
Getting some good three tier weightless is a must. I prefer the ones with a bonus to carry weight reduction to reduce my weight perks in favor of more functional perks. A few pieces like that can eliminate the need for bandolier, thru hiker, and walking pharmacy on a low-carry weight build. 
---
Still, I wouldn't run chameleon unless you're a true stealth build. Otherwise, just keep one chameleon armor piece stashed for when you really need it.
---
G R E G has yo' back. best vendor in the west.
---
True! But im gonna EXPLOIT TGE HELL OUT OUT OF THIS!!!! YAHOOOO!!!!
---
Playing the victim card is just a common trait i‚Äôve noticed 100% of you share... didn‚Äôt have to guess you mother motherfuckers wear your insecurities on your sleeves like some kind of arm band or sash(usually marked with an unfinished picture of a window, or some kind of deformed cross)
---
Right, it's just easier for people to pass knee-jerk judgment. 
---
They made a survival game for an audience that isn‚Äôt interested in a survival game, and now they have no idea how to reconcile that. Survival mode is clear evidence of their confusion.
---
In survival, an encounter with a scorchbeast should be a potentially lethal situation.
---
In a fallout rpg, a scorchbeast should be a loot roulette machine.
---
Two completely different philosophies.
---
When you push away your most loyal fan base and constantly make headlines with every bad decision in the book, you better start to believe that this is going to start effecting sales on Starfield and ES6. Bethesda. Fix yourself before your entire company sinks. I shouldn't have to put you in the same category as EA and Activision. As a very loyal Bethesda fan this honestly hurts me to watch at this point. 
---
Dense works very well against explosions. 
---
And they had the balls to plug some shitty cash grab ES card game in the email. Stay classy, Bethesda
---
how many foundations does it have? if it's more than 1x2, one of your foundation is probably floating. You're probably just gonna have to break it down and rebuild it into a monopod base
---
they gave him 4 days to explain it, he did, and they didnt buy it. 
---
Thats what happens if you let a plumber do electricians work.. 
---
Doesn't matter to me if you was guilty of doing the dupe or if you just took their excess or their duped gear when you "killed them".
---
You had duped gear. You deserve the ban.
---
Something something....
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Is all you do is talk shit to the CMs? I saw you doing the same shit in another thread. 
---
The other persons post, not yours. Decon showers cure mutations which contradicts their post. 
---
I just started a new build. I am still really enjoying the game.
---
I didn't play a victim card, still wrong.
---
yeah my right arm is 3*, poison resistance and much more durable than normal
---
thanks for the advice as well!
---
Removed my power armor and cleared what I could to get my weight down to 700...put my power armor back on, weight went up to 980...doing me a bit confuse 
---
7days to die is a bit slower but since playing it, I haven't gone back to 76
---
Just a guess, but they probably wanted people to do lots of different things instead of repetitively farming a single event. The fact that there are no other reliable ways to get certain things is the actual root cause. It's the reward lottery mechanic that's at fault.
---
Maybe there should be some kind of meta-event system that (for example) yields one or more random legendary equipment, but the reward is shown *beforehand*, not rolled afterwards. You'd have to finish a random set of events to get it, with the number of events being relative to the rarity of the reward. It's more fun to work towards something concrete than to work towards a probable letdown.
---
It looks like a giant red nipple imo 
---
Ah ok I see lol
---
Rust is amazing! However.. it's a pretty hard game to get into and it's more pvp-oriented. If that's what you want, rust is the shit! However, there isn't that much pve content. They're working on it tho.
---
Specifically the HUD swf file.
---
IMPORTANT: If you use baka to add the files individually you'll need to remove them and recompile. 
---
Same for the auto scrapping mod. Think it was called save our stuff. 
---
The auto scrapping mod cause vendors not to be able to trade 
---
I got bored of this game after the heavily nerfed the ammo factory and such.
---
&gt;As someone who had their mule account banned, and never duped or crafted anything on it. 
---
definitely not playing the victim card...
---
Its fun and every patch has made the game more stable for me personally.
---
With tse being nerfed i look forward to drops instead of knowing what i have was the be all end all.
---
I actually did something similar today, I had 130 something steal in my inventory and needed some throwing knives so I put on super duper (since they only make one per 4 steel now which I find dumb as is) and I started just spamming away with it until I started getting Communication to Server errors (which amounted to me only making about 3 knives before I got the message). Tested it again and sure enough I got the same message so I was just ended up having to make them one throwing knife per second which is annoying af.
---
I don't know why the fu ck you're trying to make a case that Bethesda isn't banning dupers.  There are prominent dupers out there who have even come forward to admit that they've had to buy 5+ copies of the game because each time a new dupe method went public and was subsequently patched Bethesda caught and banned their accounts. 
---
The continued existence of dupers isn't because Bethesda isn't banning them, it's because they keep coming back afterwards.
---
I wish chameleon would allow you to become hidden after a while when crouching, how can enemies still detect me?
---
Mob's are bullet sponges now. But I can still get 1k+ dmg on my melee build. /sigh I like variety though. 
---
Because he might get arrested for being suspected by Bethesda of duping? lmao
---
I was so disappointed when I realised that the three bunkers where exactly the same :/
---
üòÇ
---
Would be nice. 
---
"Stock/Caps reset in XX:XX
---
PS4 modus vender for mutations says vender is busy, try again later. All other venders in bunker work fine
---
Just stop playing the game
---
Don't I have to be trying to get something out of it, to be playing it as a card? Once again, I was just correcting someone, that is still WRONG.
---
I just hope this isn't the new working as intended stealth mechanic!
---
Bethesda doing some couched lance damage i see.
---
They needlessly nerfed demolition expert on top of the, admittedly needed, TSE legendary effects nerf. Explosive weapons, as a class, are universally terrible. They just decided to reduce all of their damage by 40% for no good reason.
---
White Knight was also nerfed, because too many players think it's "mandatory" as a perk to pick. Which demonstrates that they have absolutely no idea why so many people thought it was mandatory, it wasn't because it was too good to pass up, it was because armor is apparently made of wet napkins yet requires 10 lbs of ballistic fiber to repair.
---
Some people are also pretty pissed that they decided to leave the something like 4x price increase for vendor plans and mods out of the patch notes, either through incompetence or intentionally because they knew it would be an unpopular decision. 
---
It's totally not super weird that you're lurking around subreddits for games you've even played before just to tell everyone you're so smart for never having played the game before.
---
Nothing, I don‚Äôt even know how OP can wait another month. I made tho exact statement last month and this happened 
---
If only they gave us a little more, how awesome could our houses be. I wish I could show you mine., I think it's pretty cool.
---
Why would they suggest you buy the game again?
---
Did you refund it already?
---
Post screen shots of the tickets so we can actually see what you're actually asking for.
---
Just for arguments sake though, there are a further 400 hours where he could have been violating TOS which were not streamed.... According to his own game play time from his post. Doesn't prove anything I know, I just wanted to point that out. 
---
Try watching his stream archive, 200 hours of Non TOS violating video.. Of which, I'm in some of it, playing the game along side him with the rest of our crew.  
---
To me, that's more than enough proof. 
---
Work smarter, not harder.
---
LOLOLOL üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
That‚Äôs great but how about you fix the guns that are now impossible to kill anything.
---
Gerv meh beck ma 2 shot bam bam splosivo ya dawgz. Feckin killen meh expeer-e-ants
---
It‚Äôs simply not true. He based that information off of a single Reddit thread. He even prefaced it by saying ‚Äúif this thread is anything to go by‚Äù so it‚Äôs almost like he knew it probably wasn‚Äôt true, but hey, negativity will get you more views nowadays. The only old bug mentioned which I personally encountered is the weight of bobby pins reverted back to where it was which is barely negligible. It‚Äôs a small price to pay for the increased stability I‚Äôve noticed since the last patch. So he‚Äôs either being intentionally disingenuous for views or he‚Äôs just incredibly misinformed. That‚Äôs just my honest opinion.
---
Yesterday there was a post of a 5min clear with 8 ppl using tse.  50 cals no less
---
Yep bloodied explosive or furious explosive will serve you well.
---
Actually they appear as a full on body that you can interact with. I played it with some friends and that is what they got going now.
---
Should just get rid of the bobbleheads
---
Mad respect.  Just wanted to say thanks.  Bethesda should be fucking hiring you guys lol
---
Buff up the other legendary effects I mean everyone wanted the TSE because it was great damage. Honestly the mob specific legendarys should be like that. Buff those to 70-90% make me want to carry a varsity of guns for specific mob types. TSE was doing to everything what the mob specific legendarys should have been doing to their respective mob types.
---
Lmao ... again with just the tse focus
---
For sure a faction based fort or claimable bases would probably cut down these kind of events. People need to funnel their destructive passions more specifically. Faction based perks could help as well. Let responder do increased damage to wanted players etc. 
---
And despite all of that, and far fewer resources, you guys still manage to do a better job than Bethesda.
---
Maybe that's why in an argument with my friends, I argued that PUBG was polished and responsive. I'm coming from the bias of this archaic engine.
---
If they shutdown the game would be dead.
---
You don't sound like you love the game at all
---
I feel like this is beating a dead horse, but I did make a short clip of the Radworm bug in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOTVGGdym9w
---
More like 400th time.
---
It's definitely a mix of the "old" fallout fanboys, paid shilling, and, yes, some genuinely disappointed folks. But most users I see complaining and I've noticed this for awhile ONLY post here to complain with some having no evidence of even ever having played the game. 
---
I've learned that devs almost ALWAYS go to far with nerfs and this is no exception
---
2SE needed nerfed... period (and that is basically all I use)
---
And if, what we have been told is true, that people having extreme amounts of gear is causing or helping to cause server issues and stability then the nerf to total weight is fair and was badly needed 
---
The white Knight nerf I don't think was really needed but also isn't a huge deal
---
However the demo expert nerf is what I think is causing the actual legit controversy (I'm not talking about the people that are crying cuz they need to shoot shit more than once to kill it)
---
However I do think they will reverse the demo nerf or change it in some way
---
Me to I am not playing this bullshit game anymore. I am pissed to because I paid 80.00 for this fucking game!!
---
so it is bugged? have you tested it?
---
You sir, said it well!
---
yeah, i'll just wait for an update i guess
---
If they shut down the game, long enough to make it a better game, then I would be extremely happy. I‚Äôm confused 
---
Wonder if any of the lawsuits would qualify people for a refund.
---
Yesterday's patch acted as thought the one before it was never added to the game, so the duping is back because BGS.
---
Oh good, yes. Removal of attributes, as well.
---
You just linked to a sub, dude. You want /u/ for users, not /r/.
---
My thoughts were Rockstar(this came out in Beta the same week RDR2 came out and the sub was suspiciously negative along with the gaming press) or Activision as you mentioned.
---
Though the problems inthis case is that it makes sense from neither because everything is a bullet sponge and they took away the one thing that kill in a few hits besides glorified bats and knives.
---
I've half people with half a dozen angry posts admit they haven't even played it yet.
---
Yes, complain about the state of the game and it's terrible launch. Then in the same breath applaud the same developers that are responsible...absolute dumbasses in this community. 
---
Thanks for the serious reply and insight. The gameplay certainly lacks in desirability sometimes. Maybe a lot unfortunately.
---
&gt;Sorry to inform you, but Bethesda's game engine is not capable of unique item tracking. The database engine they use is ancient. They can not determine original from duped, or else they could simply wipe the duped items from the database. They also can not track ownership history of items so they have no clue where an object came from, or who it's prior owner(s) were. If they could do this, they could restore items that have gone missing from your inventory, but they cant.
---
You're just wrong and obviously have no idea how MMOs work. the engine doesn't database jack shit aside from what it absolutely needs to, because that stuff bloats engines.
---
&gt;As for the mule for 100 players. It's called a community bank. You know, Bethesda intentionally limited the game to encourage a sense of community among it's players. Limiting cap pools for vendors to force people to trade with one another
---
It's hilarious how wrong you are yet you sound confident so you think people will believe you. 76 runs on an ENGINE, the servers run on SERVER SOFTWARE. I guarantee you the server software is capable of databasing item IDs just like they do in ESO (bethesda's other MMO, remember that?).
---
&gt;Skewing difficulties to make it harder for people to solo in the game. But yet, they smack people when they do what every community has done... build a bank to store their wealth.
---
Dude i've been solo, never owned a TSE before hitting 120, and i regularly destroy groups in PvP with a power fist build. I've never had a problem soloing and have actually joined teams and made friends playing solo. great experiences.
---
 &gt;But yet, they smack people when they do what every community has done... build a bank to store their wealth.
---
Not every community is based on a post apocalyptic world where scarcity is supposed to be a gameplay element. You people are destroying the game for yourselves by hoarding shit instead of playing the game the way they intended. There's a reason most people make new fallout 4 characters, and i've seen it happen far too often because they got bored with the game after hoarding enough junk to build another new york city.

Post the links

I can't disagree with this compelling and overwhelming evidence. I myself proved my innocence when I was accused of hijacking a plane by providing 5000 hours of footage of myself *not* hijacking planes.
---
It breaks down into black titanium
---
Gatling Gun for accuracy, efficiency, longevity of use. 50cal for raw up-close DPS while still not breaking in 1 minute.
---
The rest are pretty bad for various reasons, although to be fair I haven‚Äôt fucked around with the harpoon gun or broadsided much. 
---
Did you learn your lesson? Because the rest of us have been ahead of you this entire time. 
---
Fuck me dead there‚Äôs not one person in this thread as half of a monkey as you. 
---
Man this was an issue for a while. I started on launch day, but from around the time I hit level 18/19 I got busy irl and wound up way underleveled to everyone else at 100+ who had hit the endgame several times. 
---
Even beyond things like high level players hanging around the Whitespring to make the ghouls there aggressively high level, my personal favorite is still that time I was doing part of the main quest for Rose to go down into a mine, and an event happened to spawn in so a guy literally 30 levels ahead of me rushes in to do it, and next thing I know I'm having to fight my way through narrow mineshafts full of enemies who *vastly* outlevel me, constantly spamming every health item I've got just to be able to make it the hell out of there. 
---
Like, if you're gonna make high-level players = high-level enemies, the *least* you can do is not give them extra incentives to early/mid-game quest locations where low-level people are guaranteed to be.
---
Post the full source of the email.

Rather than upvote, just tag the community managers. Then at least they're guaranteed to see it.

Man have you read some of those industry pieces? 
---
People working 90 hour weeks for 3+ months, not seeing their family's..  
---
Not sure I'd want a job, just want to lend a hand on the back end.. 
---
But in all seriousness, thanks. We are trying.
---
I am sorry that happened. Some people hate their lives and take it out on other people. It's their only way of being in control or having any kind of power over someone else. May the force be with you in your future endeavors.
---
&gt; Losing all your offline games for an online game ban(regardless of whether it is justified or not) is completely fucked.
---
Also illegal in a bunch of jurisdictions. It's one thing if your actions in one game deny you access to that game. Your actions in one game denying you access to other unrelated games is very, very sketchy territory.
---
I hadnt really thought about how the internet has made game publishers lazy AF due to being able to patch things easily.  Spot on.
---
"Thanks u/ we'll let them know about the same problems that we let them know about when they were all first mentioned the last time and nothing has still been done about them"
---
Yeah Ive got tons of faith. I've honestly never had a problem with the game
---
Based off the fact the update the atom shop more than they update the game itself....20 sounds right. They want your money not your progress.
---
All the evidence I need is what he said in his own post. You start by saying you have nothing to do with this and finish by saying to keep my comments to myself, take your own advice shit for brains. Goddam right I‚Äôm being negative towards a guy who got caught for duping and posts on here looking for sympathy. 
---
I would but I made it to question 2 and none of my answers apply. There needs to be an other spot with a brief text box 
---
Bye duping shit
---
Thanks, we joke and jab, but at the end of the day  most of us just want to help.  
---
I'm angry about the state of things, but I can't hate on the people because I've got no clue what conditions they are working under, all I can personally do is try.
---
I'm fine with a respec of the nerfed cards only but a full respec is just ridiculously over the top in my eyes. 
---
Otherwise, we may as well respec every patch cause there is bound to be some nerf that people will complain they build their whole character around.
---
Thanks, just shouting at the moon, hoping to hear an echo!
---
Depends on what‚Äôs in the terms of service. Microsoft could brick your console if you break terms of service and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything. You own the plastic and electronics inside, not the software, nor the online platform. 
---
oh boy if you want to see how bad shills can be, hope on over to the 'new' r/metro/ and see what real shilling looks like. There are people publicly defending anti-consumerism and anti-competition to degrees that shout they are paid shills.
---
It is amazing how blatant these people working in pr firms can be.
---
I am going to enjoy the lack of server lag with the ‚Äúthousands‚Äù of players claiming to be leaving 
---
Big if true.
---
Maybe you should slow your roll and wait until they are ready to offer mod support instead of thinking you know everything because you wrote some garbage for Fallout 4?
---
Yeah sure. They are the people complaining about 15-45 HP.
---
The first month of WoW was shit and the game was unplayable. It was bad enough that Blizzard have refunds for lost play time. If I remember right, most of the problems were fixed after they upgraded the servers and added more. I do remember how crappy FFXIV was as I was a beta tester. Can't really say anything about EQ1 as it was back in the days of dial up. SWTOR had a hell of a lot of launch problems as well as well as getting shit for being to much single player as well as nothing but grinding after the main story was over.
---
MMOs have always been about getting the base game out and then filling it in after launch. Also remember that Bethesda has always been buggy. I remember giving up on Daggerfall because of the constant crashes to the command prompt. 
---
I think hey should add this option to. 
---
I was stupid and just added points to whatever i liked, not thinking about a special build. When i did thought of it, it was to late. I'm building a 2H melee build now that i really like. I'm lvl 100 now and lvling up isn't going that fast, so respeccing my build takes a lot of time, mainly due to moving the special points.
---
I read on this reddit that the melee build is overpowered too. So i'm scared they will nerf the hell out of it the next time, and that i need to do another 30 lvls or more to respec.  
---
So not getting a total full respec option, and knowing i don't have all day to play, is something that annoys me.
---
Oh my god Todd's literally shitting his pants right now!
---
The "time off" they took was shorter than the time between the last two fallout games. That example is proof that a brand **isn't** ruined by a few bad games. If the next TES game looks good, people are going to buy it despite Fallout 76 being a mess. Plus, AC is an example of design stagnation, if anything. That's a completely different issue.
---
Maybe someone can make a mod for it?
---
I cant say im certain but imo a game designer, if in charge, wouldnt allow this kind of stuff to fly. They seem to put out exactly the opposite of what we ask for and for unreasonable prices which seems to me like a sales person is running it and the devs just run the software and make stuff. I dont want someone fired as thats always terrible but i just want them to see how much the fan base cares and is genuinely trying to help also between the modders literally providing the exact place with the exact fix and the army of players who want to see this game flourish they have everything they need to get this game working or at least in a more stable state than what it is. I just want to know what is going on behind the scenes that is causing these hiccups and issues to be allowed to happen.
---
Still waiting on them to fix the .50 hunting rifle to do more damage than the 308
---
Dumping *all* of your scrap and spare legendaries on a stationary mule for a couple months?
---
Totally possible.
---
Gota get rid of all those duped t2e weapons somehow.....making them worthless takes away the demand basically making them vendor fodder
---
Not to mention a chainsaw that does 2 dmg, barely itching a lvl 5 super mutant when you're lvl 90+ 
---
Why does that even exist?
---
I've come across the same bug.
---
This has got to be the stupidest thing I've ever read
---
maybe all of those modders whining about bugs should apply for a job?
---
The plan is advanced power connectors; included is a conduit wall pass through, located under power connectors in camp build mode. I'm going through the same thing right now. It solved most of my problems. 
---
South Park did a good episode on this a few years ago
---
we are trying our best to still keep it alive - [https://fallout76.enjin.com/](https://fallout76.enjin.com/)
---
Not just reduced, rendered them useless.
---
Jesus fuck. I may be a child but you're a fucking imbecile. How is *drowning*, a form of death in a survival game which is totally negated by a single Perk, not "core"? Or not receiving massive doses of core game element radiation?
---
Please explain how the "its so minor stop moaning" change is good for game play.
---
Look I really don't have a dog in this fight I'm in PA 90% of my time and my armour is purely cosmetic but I've never seen a single post on this platform or any other saying "you know what will make this game GREAT? Having my Perk cards be less effective and forcing me to scavenge more of a rare ish loot while my armour gets further degraded!!!!"
---
And looking at how they handled things like the Nerf to TSE which fucked over a whole class of builds not related to TSE or even the stupid shit surrounding the launch like the canvas bag debacle I think it is fairly easy to ascertain that yes most of the armchair devs have better ideas than the actual devs. 
---
I like this idea and have pitched it as well. I think charging a cap fee per skill point would also be a good idea. Maybe 500 caps per point or something
---
ty
---
FUBAR game is FUBAR
---
I put 200 hours into the game. I got my moneys worth. I am taking a break until things are fixed, like energy weapons and the rampant bugs (I haven't really experienced a lot of them myself, so I guess I've been lucky). I'm going to move on and play something else until they add more stuff and fix the problems, or if my friends want to get together to fuck some super mutants up. I'm still hopefully Bethesda gets it together because I really do enjoy the game. 
---
You're better off
---
where?
---
I kinda hope so. That's how I played it, aside from the occasional sniping of low level baddies swarming a new player. 
---
Bethesda has KILLED the fallout franchise and it sucks I've loved the franchise but with fallout 76 they just keep making more and more bad choices they have fallen out of touch with their consumers! I get it every company has a bad run but THIS BULLSHIT IS REPULSIVE! I really feel we could be watching the Demise of this once great company! Sorry but I think Bethesda owes refunds to anyone who is not happy with this shit sandwich they continue to add shit onto!
---
While I am impressed with your snark, sarcasm, and wit, it does not negate the fact that the footage clearly shows him doing the very things he said he had been doing. Including confronting, and robbing dupers. 
---
&gt;I found mine at Harper's Ferry vendor. Took maybe 3-4 server hops
---
Gonna start pirating there games now. They have reached EA levels. 
---
Not claiming to be perfect, and I'm not alone in bringing bugs, and some of the fixes to the table.  Nor am I claiming solo credit.
---
A couple of the mods I work on or have authored have pending updates, and won't lie that they are behind schedule...   Remember we don't do this as a job, but a hobby..  
---
But did you have one in particular you found particularly offensive?
---
Your right
---
I got the game cause my friend is a huge fallout fan who's wanted me to get into it. A coop Fallout game seemed perfect at the time. As the beta rolled around and what people were saying I advised him to not preorder but it fell on deaf ears... I got the game at full price to be on a level playing field with him and everyone else in the game. I've been playing this alone for about 1.5 months and I couldn't refund it ... feels bad man. Feel like I got duped by Bethesda and more importantly, feels like I got duped by a friend.
---
Np!
---
It wouldn't be so bad if dropping it didn't risk it vanishing in a puff of paper..
---
Been using the Targeting HUD on my T60 and I seldom crash.
---
What I notice was not all enemies were outlined in red, I don't know if it is just me.
---
I'd like to know as well..  Maybe one day?
---
Since Fallout 3\*.
---
You are not thinking clearly. The game has been out since november 14th. That's about 75 days.
---
to reach 16,000 pounds of junk you only have to stash 213 pounds a day. I should note that im also counting stashed ore.
---
that's not hard at all.
---
The definition of hotfix is "a small piece of code developed to correct a major software bug or fault and released as quickly as possible."
---
So if their "hotfix" taking up to 6 days is the quickest thing they can do, I wonder if they even have the capability to revert back to a previous version.
---
Could that really be the problem? It was like 4x4 or 4x5 or something.
---
Strange thing is when i made this camp, i was able to replace it once. And now i needed to replace it again and now i'm unable.
---
I had the same problem when i had 1 base platform and worked with stairs to create a sort of treehouse.
---
True you have a point. I'm just getting weary of having to grind so much in a game that it is becoming a chore to play. Yes yes I concede that there is an element of grind in any MMO or survival game. I'm not arguing that. It's just I've got better things to do than spend half an hour vendor running, half an hour doing Lucky Break and half an hour doing Uranium Fever just to be able to enjoy the sandbox. Even if it is just grinding another game which makes the grind entertaining. 
---
.... They never left lol for some reason Bethesda would rather fix things NO ONE is asking for (only making the game worst) than FIX THE GOTDAMN DUPERS.... I'm convinced Bethesda is ran by a bunch of idiots
---
For a second, I thought that comment was someone making a pretty funny joke. Nope. Real Bethesda employee. 
---
All 400 of them? I guess dropping all the stuff that is now more useless, and getting to working around these glitches.
---
Stop concern trolling, you piece of shit. This is why everyone hates you shitty people.
---
Me too man , me too and it sucks because all the other Fallout games were a fun to play even after completing a lot of quests. I just started playing 7 Days to Die and while the graphics arent the greatest, the game is really fun. Fallout and Bethesda have gone down the toilet like the turd theyve become.
---
TSE weapons were absolutely over the top beyond ridiculous. They are still the best weapons n the game by a not insignificant margin. The very fact you purposefully didn't use them because they suck the fun out of the game tells you that maybe running around insta gibbing everything in sight isn't how the game is meant to be.
---
Enemy stats are wrong, aweful, and need to be adjusted, because the armor system of this game is not good for weapon balance. But that is an entirely different kettle of fish.
---
&gt; The 50 cal is one of the most disgustingly underpowered guns of the projectile varieties
---
The LMG would like to have a talk with you.
---
Happy to supply some mats to rebuild if your on ps4
---
My heavy prefers the Gat.  I carry 3 and cycle thru them as they break (so fast).  I like the idea of the 50cal, but man in combat it just sprays shit everywhere so I end up rarely using it.  Would maybe use LMG more if it didn't suck so bad.
---
Does bethesda have a Yoshi-P to take on the project and turn it around though?
---
I dont think so, they dont seem to have the passion or intention to be upfront with community as FFXIV dev team does.
---
Is Zenimax willing to cut people from their position as SE did? Honestly fat chance.
---
Dupe police clip https://www.twitch.tv/videos/361220642
---
Give up and give me your stuff 
---
I would rather rework Bobbleheads into weekly buff. 
---
It would work like this. You find Explosive Bobblehead you get a weekly buff of 25% Explosive damage it last a week and you can find or use another Explosive Bobble Head.
---
Rework Curator perk so it makes it a 40% from bobble heads.
---
On weekly reset you lose buffs and you have to find all the Bobbleheads again.
---
But shouldn't it be that over powered? Its literally the most powerful thing I can think of, if any of this made sense balance wise, like in older games.
---
&gt; Unfortunately, in their terms and agreements they say that you don't own Fallout 76 (or any other game) you own a license that can be revoked at any time for no reason
---
And depending on the jurisdiction that has as much weight as those "driver not responsible for damage to vehicles" signs on gravel trucks. The EU has various provisions which render TOS and EULAs completely irrelevant.
---
But that's my point. They do have a bad track record. While I would have loved to see this game be a big hit (I was really hoping it would be), the fact of the matter is that Bethesda tend to neglect their games post-launch, and other than hope against hope, there was no evidence to suggest they'd changed prior to launch. 
---
Which is a shame. 76 had amazing potential, and I would have loved to see it realised. 
---
Some people are just dicks. I remember in DCUO when people of the opposite faction would camp the newbie areas. I eventually got high enough that I would hang out in the newbie areas picking off griefers for fun until they left the newbies alone. 
---
He's a duper. He loves weed and The Office. He is the chosen one.
---
They have no idea how to control the weird monster they've created.
---
Mind you, this was just last night. First time in game for all of 2 minutes, getting hang of controls, shot,shot and re-shot until i got the hang of run to get in bushes. Nice intro to everything.  Then 2 nights ago, wandering around Backwater same shit, including one shit head who ran into the bar while I'm standing there trying to bring up the menu and tackles me and stabs me. It's only by luck that i didn't send the controller through the tv screen in frustration. 
---
A break is good.  I broke off about 3 weeks after launch, after just dipping my toes into the mire - figured I'd save some of the content to be new and fresh for me when I come back.  And, following this sub, it looks like I made the right decision.  I really want to love this game, but so many damn annoyances... I couldn't stand to log back in and see a quest to kill a wendigo in a clown costume cluttering up my quest log for the 8000th time... 
---
I want to come back when I can play this single player with mods, like a proper FO game.  BUT I VERY MUCH FEAR that they will monetize the eff out of that... "single player" will require us to rent a private server (like a minecraft Realm), and I bet they will ONLY allow mods through [beth.net](https://beth.net)...
---
IF we think today was a rough day for the community, just wait until they announce monetized mods / SP ....  invest in pitchforks, friends.
---
Lmao the vaults are gonna be just the atrium that only loads in the floor and then followed by "disconnected from server"
---
u/LadyDevann
---
Doesn't cause everyone to CTD, and even those it does, it won't every time.   
---
I personally never had an issue until the previous (mid Jan) patch, and then I was CTD'ing upwards of 9+ times and hour...  
---
As for not all the enemies outlined..   
---
That's a new one, are you a sniper or close combat?
---
**Stuck in crafting animation at certain points. Have to hard reset. 
---
**Mutations arent working correctly
---
**Guns breaking far faster, even with gunsmith 5 
---
**Armor breaking way to fast after White Knight patch
---
Overall... The game is not performing any better. Not fun anymore. Thanks
---
I wouldn't take it personally. They're great ideas, but with all that's going on, the last thing a lot of folk want to see is more stuff being added to the Atomic Shop. 
---
Would be awesome to see these ideas (and other Atomic Shop content) added to the virtual world for free, though. 
---
That's because FO76 wasn't done as a cool "idea" it was purely done as a crash grab and its apparent in every action. The fact people are still clamoring for that atom shop even at its ridiculous prices is terrifying (and lets be real, it's the reason we don't have modded servers) 
---
No, I'm serious, what mod of mine did you find particularly bad?
---
[Citation Needed]
---
Honestly, explosive weapons (Missle launcher, etc...) aren‚Äôt in a good state to begin with
---
it's not my main account so it's not the end of the world for me to wait, but playing a 1 strength main character is goign to be rough without my mules.

you mean this?

Fast travel to Harper's Ferry, go straight ahead to the right of the train car, follow that wall of train cars till there is a door, go through it, jump over the fallen train car on the other side, and go straight ahead down the alley to the right of the broken house, the vendor is on a deck at the top of the small hill :)
---
Maybe because it's a level 5 weapon???????
---
Does that make Pete Hines, Billy McFarland?
---
Have you seen the Bethesda - Austin job postings today?
---
I'll answer the question in the title.
---
No. But I do hope you have fun with what comes next for you and hope to see you again soon!
---
If this game was the related to Fallout, no one would be playing it. 
---
He admits to picking  up duped items and knowing they were duped... I think their swing is just fine. Not saying he deserves a perma ban, but still...
---
Scummy? He bought the game a second time. I don't think that's scummy.
---
Yeah the smug fuck.
---
after farming, i'd drop anything starred into the whitespring sack next to the stash (at the train station) , or the closest container nearest the vendor for others to have for free. I've never gone to the white spring vender in ANY server and not seen that sack FULL to the brim with tons of starred shit. How is this not a form of coop that didn't need other people? I've never grouped and have no plans to. I play(ed) this game solo and would have continued to do so happily. So while I afree with you 92%, I disagree with people saying players aren't helping without needing to interact with others. 
---
this game ... 
---
in my case i just took over my wifes account because she got upset and quit when you first character got the missing pipboy bug.
---
No its not a problem. Bethesda mainly releases singleplayer game. Piracy will solve everything. I wont risk getting locked out of all the games just because I got locked out of 1. Goodluck to Bethesda fighting piracy. 
---
This is the best example why buying games on proprietary launchers is such a problem. 
---
Anyone try dropping something in the artillery grenade box? I‚Äôd try, but my live is off temporarily. 
---
Should change the name of this sub to /r/goodbyeFO76 at this point.
---
is it violating the ToS if i give out my own real name?  lmfao   .......  Ben
---
Now there is /r/fallout76filthycasuals
---
Iirc there are some updates there?
---
Brooo, how come you miss Borderlands, get 1,2 and all the DLC asap. FO76 would be miles better if its half as good as Borderlands. 
---
like you said take a break for a while,nothing wrong with doing that
---
Happy for you to have your opinion but this line sort of gets under my skin every time I see it in some form or another.
---
 "Maybe even pull the game until it is finished and fixed. I may be speaking for myself, but I would wait to play if I knew it would be the fun wonderful game it could be, and it can be."
---
I enjoy the game as is and am looking forward to the PvP in March. Why punish me for enjoying the game with bugs and all by suggesting my play time should now be stopped until you are happy the game works for you. You can always stop playing and wait for it to get better if ever and come back or not.No idea why I now need to stop playing the game because you aren't happy with it.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat you are.  I‚Äôm replaying some old/new games and just logging in to see if any sales are worth the atoms and knocking out easy atom dailies.  I‚Äôd say just don‚Äôt stress, wait for new content, and when some drops just log in and pick up where you left off.
---
Thanks for the offer, but I'm on PC. :)
---
High level events my dude. Also make sure you're hitting up all the vendors for their daily caps
---
Hell I'd pay for that.  Even if it was limited like, 1 respec a month, 5000 caps.  Or $20US?  I don't know but anything would be better than nothing.
---
Bethesda, dick move? Who would think of that. They can't help but burn the entire fan base with this release. 
---
I had a group of people chase and hunt us down a few nights back. We couldn‚Äôt even get kills off of them because they were spamming dead eye and the auto aim. This shit went on for almost an hour or two. I don‚Äôt even remember what caused it.
---
No, a beta takes place a few months before launch so the devs have enough time to iron out the bugs that were found. Early access takes place a few weeks before, and runs into, launch. 
---
This exactly, you could repair in the field instead of having to find a station and go through the menus and animations. Also, I feel that a lot of these repair issues could be easily resolved if they would just introduce armor/weapon repair kits. 
---
You probably have a bunch of games on the shelf to play. Maybe some you haven't played much? I have a bunch I haven't really played. I think i'm getting to the point where I'm either going to start binge watching some TV shows and movies or maybe play a different game. If they listen to wisdom and fix some stuff in the gaame that they previously "fixed" that didn't need "fixed" then I and a lot of other players would probably happily play for a lot longer, but as it stands I have nothing to play for right now. I want to change my build up a little, but they nerfed xp, I want to farm legendaries, but they nerfed loot and 3 stars give 1 star items, I want to buy plans but they increased the prices and nerfed cap stashes. I'm just not willing to put myself through that because they want to manipulate me into playing longer by slowing me down and making things more tedious. This type of thing will never work with me. If I want to walk I walk, if I want to run I run. If they put a harness on me and prevent me from running I'm walking away.

Go to whitesprings golf course and collect all the golf outfits and skirts, be prepared to die, but at least you'll make money. They sell for 15 caps each (26 with Max hard bargain)

Thousands of issued? 
---
What the heck are you running in? A PC made out of pickles and chewing gum? 
---
I've had a few bugs, sure, but nothing game breaking at all. 
---
There‚Äôs a glitch with the chameleon mutation and escape artist perk combination that lets you stay invisible forever basically. You have to intentionally switch armor to undo the effect. Only downside is it‚Äôs not for pvp, other players can see you even though you‚Äôll appear invisible on your screen. But it does somewhat seem to work pve against enemies. They have a harder time detecting you. I wrote a how to post on it a while back, I‚Äôll link it if I can find it. 
---
Has been completely silent on f076, cheeky bastard 
---
I prefer reg armor. 
---
Yes it's kind of hard to see what problem they were trying to solve.  There's enough obvious actual issues to work on without dreaming up imaginary ones.
---
&gt;The bugs that have existed since fallout 4
---
You misspelled Oblivion
---
No, but if its not the lead position then nothing will change.
---
It's even better than that because the ban is for all Bethesda services, not just 76.
---
I really think they‚Äôre setting it up so they can have so boosts of some kind they you can buy.
---
I know they said they wouldn‚Äôt do that. I just don‚Äôt believe them lol 
---
it was my wifes account who quit when the game first released over her character losing her pipboy. It was her first real game which sucks, but didnt affect my main account at all.
---
I hear you, same boat. All these people who were never lucky enough to get a TSE weapon are cheering, I‚Äôve even heard them say it‚Äôs now a challenge to wipe out mobs. It‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs still easy as ever - it just takes longer. Totally unnecessary nerf as now it takes me 5-6 shots with my TSE Handmade instead of 1 or 2. Such a waste of time! Makes playing this game a complete drag.
---
They need to undo this nerf, start looking at how they can balance these weapons in a PVP scenario. Why should people complaining about not being lucky enough to find TSE‚Äôs manage to change the way the game plays for me? Or even people who have lost to other people with TSE‚Äôs, complain enough and Bethesda looks after them.
---
In a PVP sense, TSE‚Äôs are completely OP. I agree 100%. It shouldn‚Äôt be the reason that the whole game changes, just so the minority don‚Äôt complain as much. 
---
Stuck in the middle with you? 
---
I use range weapons, but not a sniper rifle.
---
The enemies not being outlined is happening to me ever since I started playing.
---
Good job on finding the fix for this one.
---
You are entitled to your opinion, these are ment to be god tier weapons. People like myself are upset because we put in alot of effort to get our hands on them and just like that poof all our hard work was removed. I enjoyed one shotting everything, I don't like enemies that are bullet sponges. If it takes 5 shots to kill an enemy 20 enemies that 100 bullets. That's all recourses you have to craft and obtain or farm hotspots. 
---
On top of that PVP is a joke now, you are force to respec into melee or obtain bloodied weapons to do decent damage other wise 2 high level players just end up pouring 1000's of rounds into each other. This happened just yesterday when I tested it - I had a bounty someone came after me I just unloaded into him with my previously good TSE 50 cal, and be both just keep shooting each other trying to occasionally dodge and stimpacking. The fight only ended because the other guy ran out of stimpacks. I used to enjoy PVP because it was tense you had to be careful because TSE was terrifying and you could die with poor positioning or movements now you just spray hundreds of recources at each other for 100-200 caps if the guy is high level. PVP was the only thing I enjoyed in this game and the TSE nerf ruined it for me.
---
Honestly I think this game is going to be the start of a valuable lesson to Bethesda.
---
And since star field and TES 6 are both going to be using their same old broken engine, they may not be around much longer afterwards if they don‚Äôt smarten up.
---
I actually just went back to fallout 4 after my build got nerfed from this patchüòí
---
can i suggest that the explosive card should be redone and rewritten. it reads wrong now and the math is wrong. i feel as will it should be a 3 point card.
---
Cmon gta6
---
You are very short sighted. People who are still here in the subreddit but not playing the game currently WANT this game to be good. They are mostly Fallout and/or Bethesda fans who feel misled and lied to. The exact reason we don't want to let Bethesda get away with this shit is because we still have minimal hope of this game getting better but more importantly we can't let Bethesda think they can pull this same half-assed shit with either Starfield or TES 6. 
---
Cheers for that. Saw it by accident yesterday and bought it immediately. Can't build it yet, I need screws but my BoS PA need fixing so my screws will go for that first and then the generator.
---
Strangely I am not a PA player but collect all the PA and am obsessed with them being 100% or even 130%, even the Raider Armour set.
---
A fixed time would be better imo, like every day at 3:00.
---
Same for me, i got my moneys worth, i've bought more expensive games with 8 hour playtrough. But i've been enjoying this game for 150 hours with only three instances of annoyance, that was losing my junk when crashing on respawning loadings, and once for accidently putting my 1.5k .308 rounds into my bag of death and dying again to exploding legendary robot which caused the bag to despawn.
---
But most of the bugs haven't been really that annoying, and the gameplay is still amazing. And hopefully there is more to come.
---
I didnt see anything about the next patch. I still believe a level of humility needs to be displayed from bethesda. Seriously... It would be nice to see a studio use this tactic. It might even set a standard in the industry as a whole. Sorry... Wrong universe.
---
Right, but the slow it takes you to do those things the longer they can take in releasing content. 
---
Thanks,
---
Any ideas about the Beckley one? I did got a picture with the gas pump there(not a Red Rocket but still looks a Gas Station) and I think I encounterd a bug, it says 4/5 but  upon checking, only three were grayed out.
---
I never once stated that cooperation didn't happen, in fact im sure it did happen in every form possible. However, that sort of cooperation did not require, in any way, TSE Weapons in their old form.
---
My point was simply that TSE's in their old form **discouraged** cooperation, while the reduction in them encourages cooperation.
---
it's time for you guys to quit this junk actually.  
---
the fact that you guys still buy, play, and pay for cosmetic, giving gold to each other here mean Bethesda still stand to gain by delivering this shit. And that's why you guys don't deserve anything better.
---
Leaving the game btw xd
---
But for real though, besides the people saying they're leaving, it's the people putting PSA for stuff people already know about
---
you havent read my post...basic items are for free and it clearly written in general notes section
---
See one of my comments on this thread. It's linked. 
---
I'm hearing you.
---
Thanks, will check when I got home later, appreciate the response good sir.
---
Lol 
---
Idk if it was necessarily taking 3 months to realize the game was a dumpster fire. Or well I dont know, I'm new to actually playing the Fallout franchise. I've really only kept playing it to try and get my monies worth. I doubt I'm the only one but still, it's sad we even got to this point. I feel duped, like an abused partner who was promised it wouldnt happen again.
---
Indeed, they need a sub just to whine about shit. Plenty of us enjoy the game, I had a blast with a few random strangers on the map earlier. This place went from pics, questions, and tips, to a bunch of people crying the blues over their ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù. I‚Äôll give you whatever GameStop offers for used copies of FO76 to go away. 
---
They? Do you mean Bethesda?
---
Damn it Butters.... 
---
I can't buy or sell from vendors while overencumbered, but I'm nowhere near 1,500 carryweight!
---
You sure? I thought that was this sub...cause after this update that‚Äôs all we are.
---
ok, eric cartman!
---
I bet Todd will make some kind of snide remark referencing this game at E3. Like he'll show Starfield and then say something like "we know we aren't the best with dealing with bugs" *smirk "but we've implemented a new blah blah blah"
---
Bethesda wasn't dependent on fallout. 
---
I would much rather give you 1k for a jetpack than spend 10K on a plan to use once, so your buisness should still be rather safe.
---
one more reason never to buy games that are not on STEAM
---
Doubt it. No Mans Sky was different because it was a passion project by a very small team, it was personal to them and they wanted to succeed. Bethesda now is a corporation, that care's about what will get them the most money. When they realize that there's not enough people playing to buy shit form the atom store they'll drop this game
---
Should've read the ToS. Be thankful they didn't turn you into a human centipede for cheating instead.
---
Never trust a banned player claiming he hasn't do anything!
---
I was over 6 years gamemaster and tech.support for a rather larger MMO. I banned several thousand accounts for botting and exploiting.
---
Mostly everyone was claiming, he hasn't done anything. Yet our logfiles and video recordings were showing different story. 
---
Mostly everyone confessed later on to be guilty.
---
So yeah, never trust a banned player!
---
Combination of things.
---
At lower levels I was making sure to always sell to the 7 vendors everyday to make 1400caps a day. 
---
Then with a bank roll and beginning to understanding the market, you can see good deals and do resells or trades.
---
And finally for me end game. A combination of occasional Goodluck from the scorchqueen can pay out quite handsomely, along with my side business of building camps for people.
---
Now moved to front of the post 
---
Aaaand just like that I'm no longer a customer of BethSoft
---
I mean agreed but I definitely think that this is going to leave a bad taste in consumers mouths like now before elder scrolls or any other Bethesda game releases I will be very hesitant to buy it and probably end up just giving my money to Ubisoft üòÇ
---
I completely agree. Its so tedious to finally grab one up after waiting so long. I loved mine. I always loved it. I knew they were going to get nerfed, i dont mind the nerf, but we were getting a 100% boost for explosive which is now reduced to 20% as well as the two shot, it was at +100% and now just 25%. This is also topped off with another horrible nerf including the demolitions expert going from +100dmg now to just +60%. They ruined any use of all explosive weapons. It just absolutely blew my mind. I used to 3 shot a scorchbeast with my shotgun. Now i barely knick off her health with it. Its just to the point where i would have to reiterate my entire build just for these weapons, with all the nerfs to xp, legendary drops, plan costs, and caps, its becoming work rather than fun for me..
---
So that is after the patch? Therefore the patch has a bug? 
---
There is the problem - fallout 76 isn't billing itself as an MMORPG. Other people started calling it that, and it stuck. 
---
Check the wiki, it even says "online action role playing game" which is pretty vague. 
---
Also, let's be clear. In 12 years of FFXI, you paid nearly $1800 to play. Similarly for everquest and WoW. Yeah there is an atom shop in fallout, but it clearly isn't subscription based. 
---
I just don't think fallout 76 is being judged on its merits. I think it is being held up against what people wanted it to be, and yeah, it falls short there. 
---
Thank you but the community wants a "Sorry we fucked up". Some humility would gain trust here.
---
Huge if correct
---
I argued to the death in defence on reddit of the difficulty behind the Bethesda development team. But the updates are embarrassing me for having faith and knowing how difficult creating large world maps and extra LOD layers can be. I appreciate what has been given to me in fallout 76, a lot is very well planned and they did a great job as a wrap. But ffs use some of this launch profit to manage your updates and fixes better. And if it was my company, I wouldn't be paying whoever set the beta and launch dates/plans. That was a catastrophic launch and to call the pre-release a "BETA" is a lie. Mind you they sold a lot of merchandise and extras at premium prices. Problem is that the game is good, but it ain't premium.
---
I believe it to be quite possible that if Bethesda fails to impress the community of consumers owning the game, there's a reasonable chance the consumers would hold a class action lawsuit to Bethesda. It would need evidence that it was misleading, of poor quality, or not what was shown on the box/label whatever, to have a case in Australia. Consumer laws I think are generally quite similar in the U.S.
---
Exactly I'd be rich If I had a dollar for every duplicate complaint on this subreddit
---
They needed to nerf TSE they were stupid powerful. Enemies are bullet sponges but it's not that bad I play solo with a normal lever rifle and I do just fine 
---
You obviously have not hit end game, found all locations, done all quests and events the only thing left is to grind for gear. which because of the last patch is broken because legendary enemies are not dropping legendary w sponsor or armour. 
---
From other people opinion it would of taken longer to fix then two months mabey even a year or more.
---
Oh yeah. No1 has been vocal what so ever
---
You're right we need more of those "To the guy who something something good deed for me" post or another "I love this game fuck the youtubers" post
---
I did. Looks like there on it. However a display of humility would redeem some trust.
---
You can have your cake and eat it too. If not you were just bad at min-maxing. You don't need more then 1/3 points in the tree rifleman experties or commando or whatever you are using. First point is 10% dmg, if you put more you are wasting 6 points on knly 5% dmg. Other then that yoj only need bloody mess and tank killer. Melee doesn't require much at all, just the 40% attack speed snd the armor pircing perk. The rest can all go into quality of life perk and you effectivly have a all in one build. Also don't take to much credit for being viable with a melee weapon, they are stupidly OP now compared to all the rest. They have good damage even with zero investment.
---
Applying now! 
---
This is a big deal for me because I've been playing overencumbered for most of the time since I'm a hoarder.
---
I just now got disconnected seconds after someone launched a nuke. I'd bet they were disappointed, assuming it was a server crash.
---
Ugh.  
---
Beta and Early Access are not defined by the period of time they occur during, the fucking point is the PURPOSE.  Early Access exists for ONE reason, to drum up pre-orders and then a few days before launch give those players uninterrupted access to the full game.  
---
The BETA Bethesda ran was not a "full" beta but instead existed primarily to stress test the servers and catch any last minute bugs and technical issues with the pre-order incentive still there but taking a MAJOR back seat.  That's why the servers were only up for a block of hours every few days, because after each test window they needed to adjust the servers and update the build in time for the next window.
---
Maybe it'll be on the atom store for $12!
---
And XP in general. Now that so many people need to respec most of their strength perks, its a hot spot for leveling up as quick as possible. 
---
I first tried to get a refund and they sent an email asking me why I wanted a refund and marked the ticket solved. Won't be buying another of their games for awhile go be real. 
---
Thanks for agreeing with me, I honestly thought this would get a lot of hate. It's good to know I'm not the only one who thinks that lol.
---
4 times? What were the 4 times they released Skyrim.  I dont know so I am curious 
---
guess we should nerf rifles then
---
Shit like this makes me fearful to play untill they get their act together...
---
This beta and the Destiny 2 betas are the only two I've ever played that convinced me *not* to buy the game.
---
Although plain explosive weapons are \*relatively\* strong now that TSEs are weaker, so maybe they have a useful niche now. Not the missile launcher though, that's just garbage.
---
I really agree with you. I have few more games, but i might be like you and start binging some tv shows. This game had really become all i had looked forward to the whole day. Maybe thats why this update has been so frustrating, maybe im taking it too seriously, or im giving the game more attention than i should. Maybe i should appreciate it a little bit more, and to do that i think im going to take my mind off of it for a little bit. Thank you. I will definitely be trying something different.
---
Can't you see how fucked up that would be. Hey we made this game less fun for you know you have to PAY us money to make the game fun again. Why don't they add an XP boost to the atom store while they're at it and nerf XP gain for everyone else.
---
I haven't gotten a black screen, but whenever I fast travel there my mutations stop working.
---
stashed item weight is random since Dec patch IMO. I didn't touch my stash at all, but sometimes it shows 660, sometimes it shows 560. 
---
I spent $60 on a game that was already barely playable and they break further every couple weeks. Time to go play a Slavic card game simulator.
---
Thanks.  
---
Very odd, and (don't take offense) your 100% sure you have the targeting HUD installed? Had someone else end up finding the VATS overlay / recon mods installed.  
---
Assuming your correct, once I can play the game again, I'll see if I can replicate it and find the range they stop highlighting.
---
To be honest, I don‚Äôt think the people exploiting glitches didn‚Äôt know. They all knew, they just decided to anyway. A lot of them have alt accounts that may or may not ever be connected to their main, too. 
---
You answered your own question. Lvl 11 taking on lvl 40 mobs...and yes they nerfed xp at low levels so people weren‚Äôt power leveling 
---
Well at this point i can't and don't even want to defend Bethesda anymore.  
---
The TSE nerf was heavy enough already. TS was already laughable, since only the Explosive thing was the one that caused it to be so "OP". (Not really overpowered. Just strong enough.)  
---
But really now? Even nerf explosive weapons? Nerf Pipe Weapons? Nerf Armor itself?  
---
What is next on the plan? Nerf Energy weapons?   
---
Nah.. Thanks. I'm done with this for now. I maybe take another look in a few months, but this was too much.  
---
I mean i am glad that you noticed that those pesky Bobbleheads stacking was finally nerfed, but that would have been already enough.  No TSE nerf would have been needed in my eyes. And if it had to be done, at least leave TS alone.   
---
Everyone is going to run around as melee or VATS build with crits. Then soon one of those two things will be nerfed to oblivion too and i am really not in the mood to watch the same shit going on there.   
---
I really tried my best to defend this game. Since it was a lot of fun for a month at least, trying to get a decent weapon, kill of the SBQ and do some exploring. But what am i supposed to do now? The weapons are not worth it no more, since the better option is something i have been using since. Melee. And i am terribly bored by it. VATS? Never was a fan of it and never will be.  
---
Just to put it short. I am not mourning about TSE itself. I mourn about the path this game takes now. Nerfing everything into oblivion, just because it is used by people and some don't like others using it. I didn't even have a TSE weapon myself. I mostly used my melee for normal targets my explosive only Assault Rifle on harder flying targets like the SBQ or mostly pinned her down with Shotguns and Cryolator. 
---
Nah just remove it it's unneeded. 
---
Dunno why you're getting down voted, I started doing the same. Picking locks is for the birds
---
Yikes 
---
All other mmos have a set time across the board.
---
I got like 70 hours in and I died inside when they nerfed workshops too much 
---
Meh... To my eyes the community is exactly the same. There just a flood of poop flinging from people annoyed their favourite gun got nurfed. 
---
Thought they were getting new Engines, atleast StarField..
---
I quit because I ran out of stuff to do after putting in 200 hours, which honestly is a decent amount of time to spend on a game to begin with, so I got my money's worth.
---
And the award for the person to repeat the same news as 100 other people have in the past 24 hours goes to... The guy that posted this! CONGRATS you just posted what 100 people have already said good for you.
---
I don't really care all that much to claim he's even probably a duper but it's a little silly to use a ton of misc. footge of *not* doing something as evidence thaf you never did something. Seeing as how you could really be guilty of it all along and still conveniently have tons of footage of everything but the dirty deed to show everyone.
---
&gt; -Plasma Weapons: Plasma Goo Bug Many corpses are rendered unlootable with endless "Loading" icon.
---

This should have been fixed with the patch from earlier in the month. I haven't had trouble looting goo.
---
It's like people forget about EA and Activision. It will get fixed keep your panties on and blame Zenimax you fools.
---
And with the CONSTANT Nerf of guns its like they want you to be melee and I'm sorry in a real apocalypse I would not be stabbing a ghoul üòÇüòÇ
---
The team behind FF14 was passionate about their project and truly loved their fans. When they admitted there disaster, the director of the game held a press release and cried on stage while expressing his sorrow. They then immediately recreated the game. 
---
Do not expect that from Bethesda. This is not a passion project 
---
Because its reddit. 
---
I didn‚Äôt buy a single TSE from eBay. I found 4 Legit ones and trade and bought with Caps others.
---
But buying Atom Shop Outfits That give an In game Boost or Effect. Is Pay to Win. It crossing a line that needs to be addressed.

This is coming from somebody that has 500 hours in the game and Level 203.

Please god yes.

Nah, Bethesda won't do that. The nerfs are designed to prolong the game by increasing the grind. You do less damage and you're equipment breaks just as much, meaning it will break at a faster rate now. Scorchbeasts are designed by Bethesda to take as much damage as possible, thus wrecking all your shit meaning that you have to spend more time grinding away to replenish your broke shit. 
---
straight jacket from fort defiance are worth 50 with the hard bargain lvl 3
---
Good luck
---
600 hours your never getting back
---
They break within minutes. THey are bugged like energy weapon durability. It's all useless.
---
Lol it's fine. A lot of people are angry I'm just annoyed that people only talk crap instead of helping eachother
---
"I'll pass it along to the team."

You should take your own advice, buddy.

Anything, which was in Fallout 4 should not be the part of the Atomic Shop, but the base game itself.
---
Look up what the abbreviation 'MMO' stands for.  
---
It doesn't apply to 76.
---
Good to know, and ironically that's where I started getting the CTD's linked the the HUD.  
---
Thanks for the Intel, next question, which PowerArmor?
---
EA Released Sims 3 few bugs FIXED in a week Sims 4 some bugs..... Fixed in a week.... EA fans say can you do this EA delivers! Bethesda fans "Can you fix the dupers the server problem! The bulk issue etc." Bethesda: YOU SAID MAKE GUNS USELESS GOT YOU!! 
---
I am glad you have an opinion on my opinion. But my question is... Did you not read the title of the post?? And, YOU are very willing to punish me and everyone else, because you like it broken. It must fill you with joy to spend days, gathering things to have them simply disappear?? Oh, wait, I know what makes you happy happy joy joy, when your level 12 and have 2 level 100's kill you not once, but chase you across the board and do it for an hour, until I server hopped? (Not saying you are that person, using it as an example) Or getting jackshit for killing the scorch beast queen? That's super awesome. Right?
---
The reality is, Bethesda won't take it down. So, don't worry. Enjoy the game. Leave me to my voiced disappointment.
---
Lol compare that to the hate the past three hours.
---
I have another bug - turrets started spawning tipsy-turvy: they spawn with their basemrnt plate or legs slightly sticking out of texture, while their gunning part is inside the texture (underground). Despite such an inconvinient position they still are able to detect and fire in my direction, quite successfully I must say! I dont see bullets, just hear firing sound and my hp goes down. Died twice to this yesterday.

.
---
They need to take the whole game offline for like 8 months and rework everything, then rerelease in October 
---
this thread is full of people that are mad their I.W.I.N. button got taken away haha.. personally i don't give a shit in single player games, but in a multiplayer game like this, especially with the PVP system as it currently is (garbage, and practically mandatory, there was plenty of ways for players to kill you even if you didn't fight back) TSE needed a nerf.. it's fine that one guy loved to use them to make his mostly single player experience more convenient, but many others used them to grief other players, but outright killing them, or completely destroying their base in seconds, or one-shotting enemies before anyone else could tag them... they should have brought other weapons at least closer to their level before nerfing anything else, because now all we're left with is tedious bullshit as everything feels like a BB gun and breaks after 3 magazines, but regardless TSE weapons needed a nerf 
---
You‚Äôre comparing the plans to a single mod.
---
The T60 one. It really doesn't bother me that much. Thanks.
---
They already have your money, they don't give a shit, and would be happy if you just fucked off so they could save money by taking servers offline.
---
Dude what 
---
I've tried to stay positive since launch. Telling people all games have bugs give it time!! But I feel like I'm constantly getting slapped and I'm tired of defending a failing franchise it sucks I had SUCH high hopes for fallout 76
---
My nerfed grenade launcher was so OP.
---
Wow finally someone can get there money worth from this game 
---
They really phoned in the entire development. Nobody there cares.
---
Starfield is deeply fucked in development and idk if they had any progress in Valenwood. Fo76 failure could blow a hole in production plans. This postings can be anything
---
Eg you got disconnected. Not your fault. But your bobby pins doubled.
---
You just unintentionally created 500 items in minutes.
---
Nothing to do with crafting at all.
---
I‚Äôll look tonight.  It should be in the science vendor under notes section.
---
100 if you pre ordered!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK üòÇüòÇ
---
No...I mean ‚Äúview source‚Äù on the email and copy and paste the entire text, including the headers.
---
I'll just take a wild guess here, you're a melee build who runs blondied everything and the patches haven't affected you yet.
---
I'll be waiting to see your rants when it does buddy.
---
And don't be assuming everyone is as stupid as you'd think by buying virtual game items on ebay.
---
"Assuming makes an ass out of you and me".
---
Didn't mama teach you that?
---
I agree with the survival versus rpg framework, but I think the way to reconcile the two concepts is to include lots of survival early, and relatively little survival late. Allow the player to transition to a more heroic state. 
---
* What if food wasn't that nourishing early but advanced recipes later in the game kept food fresh longer and satisfied hunger longer? 
---
* What if early armor broke, but later armor was more durable? 
---
Starting as an assistant pig-keeper really makes you appreciate that level 50 blazing sword of death. 
---
Reducing survival tasks lets people get out and explore. 
---
I think the biggest problem with the game for a survival framework is the space limitations. If I'm really trying to survive with limited resources, am I going to discard Stimpacks from my camp? Would I drop food? Would I drop ammo? How many times have you sold or discarded junk only to have to scrounge for that same type of junk the next day? I have, and that rarely makes sense for a survival game. 
---
Most decent weapons have a better **dps** and usability than any fatman.
---
Blizzard not anymore
---
Yeah, I mean I agree they should have a PTR, but this is a bit on the nose
---
I had a recruiter contact me during the beta when it seemed like shit was hitting the fan. Seemed like they were under a lot of pressure going by the sloppy emails. Hard pass.
---
I had high hopes for this game and I really did enjoy it til the first patch when I wasn't even able to play anymore. Now it seems I haven't missed anything.
---
Time to just keep playing counter strike forever and ever
---
Nope. VATS/Criricals pistol build. Haven't used a single legendary yet. 
---
Ironic, what you said, though.
---
the first thing i did when i got the gauss rifle plans was craft 22 of the suckers so i could get mods, good to know i'd be banned now if i did that.
---
do you have any other characters on your account overweight?
---
My god. 15 hp....
---
do you have mod installed?
---
I'm not sure If I'm stupid for never having a problem with the game. Barely any glitches, rarely crashes.
---
Besides, this is Fallout we are talking about, what Fallout doesn't have bugs or glitches. What I'm doing is saying that we should give the game more time to fix itself, take a break for 2 weeks to a month and come back. Don't sell the game just because you are impatient.
---
Seriously though the team making updates did major oopsie lol
---
Read what you wrote and then how I worded mine.
---
English. Do you speak it?
---
I have been playing almost to the point of addiction since November. Weirdly enough the thing that actually made me just quite was the nerfs to TSE.
---
It sounds silly but I was always a survival player on FO4, where every bullet counts whether it's being fired at you or against you.
---
I just can't go back to bullet sponges again, it ruins the emersion for me.
---
If they increased the power of all weapons in the game (including the enemies) but reduced the DMG against players it would be my dream fix but I don't think everyone would like it
---
Re read it then and put some brain power into it I know that doesn‚Äôt come easy to you 
---
In a few months, you can probably trade in your copy in exchange for an entire GameStop location, look on the bright side. 
---
Instead of using materials move your camp (even a few feet) and everything will be fixed. 
---
&gt; And did you even read the post? He didn‚Äôt cheat.
---
While he can totally be honest, I'd rather not jump to conclusions, you've heard one side of the story, for all we know he could definitely be cheating.
---
That said, what really trouble me is it means that if you're banned (for legitimate or not reasons) from let's say Fo76, you won't be able anymore to play to the next DOOM if it's released on the same launcher. A huge red flag for me.
---
Bethesda... Bethesda... What have you done, how far have you strayed...?
---
Lol. What's the point of this? I'm only lvl 11 and I'd like to be able to use more powerful weapons and gear, but I feel like I've been playing FOREVER to only get to 11. Fn 11! And once I get to the higher levels and get that gear, then what? I can't stand endless grind games. 
---
Ya.  If it was straight PVE with balanced weapons and more group quests, I think people would be happy.  That‚Äôs all I really wanted... to relax after work and dork around in Fallout with my friends.
---
shit!  too bad you do not play, i could use some things for my alt.
---
I wholeheartedly agree. Your grammar is despicable, however. 
---
I mean he‚Äôs not wrong 
---
Lmao I got the digital version üò≠ 
---
Yes. Much better than a lot of people, actually. 
---
Playing on Xbox.
---
Plans should have just been added to event rewards.
---
I play a lot of destiny 2, and random world drops means you play the game to get what you want.
---
Buying plans means you play the economy to get what you want.
---
Plans shouldn't have been a thing for mods, you should just drop actual mods, make people farm those.
---
Now? Plans should have been the reward for week long quests.  Should have been real investments.  THAT makes them rare, those would get people trading for mods.  "I'll craft you a jetpack for a fee!
---
I understand because I started out as a shotgun build. :) If I had a desperate need for plastic elsewhere, I would be unlikely to prioritize bulking my junk. 
---
Same here ...healing factor not worke once since patch . Many other mutations also fucked
---
Just curious what changes did your community do and can console players get this?
---
You‚Äôre fucked üòÇ 
---
I don't know about that, OP is shit tier.
---
Sounds like you got banned for using the dupe exploit 
---
So you don‚Äôt pollute this thread trying to save a game that hardly belongs to you 
---
If you paid for something that is not working, obviously you will rant about it. Otherwise you're applauding  incompetency, hence they will keep doing things like this cause people conforms with it.
---
How many of those non vac servers are run by valve...?
---
You will need to remove the SaveMyStuff mod as it doesn't work with the latest update.
---
I had the same issue yesterday.
---
i agree with you completely, and i also agree TSE weapons needed a nerf and am glad they did, but i don't agree with how they did it... their first a biggest mistake was releasing the game with things so out of control...when so many things start out overpowered as hell and they attempt to balance it after release by effectively nerfing it, it feels like they're taking things away, and that never feels good as a player; the ideal version would have seen everything massively underpowered and them buffing things, that feels like an enhancement and a progression, as it is it's been almost nothing but taking and taking and taking things away, because that's what happens when you apparently have zero internal beta testers.
---
Their other biggest mistake in this context was not buffing other weapons to compensate, the biggest reason people gravitated to TSE weapons was simply because everything else feels so tedious to use; Heavy weapons don't deal nearly enough damage considering the weight of the weapons and ammo (and somehow many of those got the nerf bat as well), energy guns are extremely weak and break way too quickly, and regular guns most are complete trash, and the few that aren't are still no match for melee weapons, especially considering there's still no weight reduction perk for rifles and many rifles weigh more than heavy weapons some-fucking-how
---
it's just a huge shitshow
---
What the gonna ban me for my 50 bulk rubber bc I freaking can‚Äôt craft repair or do anything I‚Äôm tired of the freaking bulk glitch and that means I can‚Äôt use the stuff I‚Äôve been grinding out for to do ANYTHING AT ALL AND ALSO MY LUCKY BREAK STOPPED WORKING TODAY AND TO MAKE IT BETTER MY 3* Grog Axe Does 53 Dmg With all the perks!!!! CMON BETHESDA I FEEL LIKE YOU ARE JUST CHOOSING TO TARGET PEOPLE LIKE HOW I AM.         CONSTANTLY HAVING 5 MAYBE 6/7 LVL 80 SCORCHBEASTS 
---
SPAWN ON ME WHEREVER I FREAKING GO I CANT HANDLE IT ANYMORE I FEEL LIKE A DEV IS SITTING BACK AND LAUGHING AT MY HARD TIME PLAYING THE GAME THAT I
---
SURPRISINGLY HAVENT GIVEN UP ON YET!!! YOURE WELCOME BETHESDA I GAVE YOU 80$ AND FOR WHAT??!!!!! THIS CRAP?              YOU SCREWED UP AND ITLL TAKE ALOT OF APOLOGIES FOR YOURE DEDICATED AND STILL REMAINING FAN-BASE TO COME BACK!!! SORRY BUT IM DONE WITH YOU TILL YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO YOUR JOB!
---
Been saying this from the start, check my history, this game was RUSHED. They took advantage of the player base and delivered an incomplete and rather disconnected game from where fallout players stand.
---
Happy to see people lose hope in a game they tried to like?
---
Wut.
---
that includes my email address in multiple places of the email which i dont really want to share on reddit. why do you want to see that
---
&gt; You're just wrong and obviously have no idea how MMOs work. the engine doesn't database jack shit aside from what it absolutely needs to, because that stuff bloats engines. 
---
Right, And were talking about some other company, that actually uses separate game engines and database servers.  No.. we're talking about Bethesda, the company that split it's creation engine into two pieces, one to run on the client side, and the other to run on the server side.   It still uses the same damn internal database structure that fallout 4 uses, it's only been tweaked to add multi-user capabilities. (just think about the save file sizes for fo4, it was nothing but a single player 'wold state database')
---
Why do you think the servers freak out when someone crafts more than a few items at a time in rapid succession?  - Because the code is not optimized for multiple people doing crap at once.   They clearly are not using a modern database engine like SQL on separate servers from he game engine.  Or we wouldn't have the game server crashing when two people sit at cooking stations and craft large quantities of boiled water.
---
&gt; It's hilarious how wrong you are yet you sound confident so you think people will believe you. 76 runs on an ENGINE, the servers run on SERVER SOFTWARE. I guarantee you the server software is capable of databasing item IDs just like they do in ESO (bethesda's other MMO, remember that?). 
---
76 is nothing more than a split version of the creation engine.  A client, responsible for graphics rendering, world and character asset management, user interface handling, and communications.  And the Server part, which handles synchronization of clients, wold events, stats, and inventory management (database functions).  I'm sure there's more things each side do, but I've covered the basics.
---
Review of the client side esm and ba2 files located in the data folder will verify this. (You can obtain the proper programs for reviewing the games internals from the nexus.)
---
&gt;Dude i've been solo, never owned a TSE before hitting 120, and i regularly destroy groups in PvP with a power fist build. I've never had a problem soloing and have actually joined teams and made friends playing solo. great experiences. 
---
Congratulations, But I don't see what that has to do with the intended slant of the game meant to push people together.  Game mechanics are game mechanics, and it's very clear what Bethesda intention was.
---
&gt;Not every community is based on a post apocalyptic world where scarcity is supposed to be a gameplay element. You people are destroying the game for yourselves by hoarding shit instead of playing the game the way they intended. There's a reason most people make new fallout 4 characters, and i've seen it happen far too often because they got bored with the game after hoarding enough junk to build another new york city.
---
I'm sorry, I didn't see anything in the game manual that said I needed to hike across the map to collect a clip board when ever I needed a spring.
---
Face it, everyone plays the game differently, that is why it's called an open world adventure survival game.  Some people survive better in groups, others like to do the rustic thing and live in a cabin in the woods by themselves.
---
Everybodys way is the right way, there is no wrong way to play the game.  I understand what you are saying about having too much on hand resources kills some of the aspects of the game.  However, I gotta say, being able to say, "Hey, I need a few springs so I can finish this power armor leg, anyone got any they can spare?"  And have three people say, "How many you need?" is a -very- nice thing.  It's called sharing, and its what communities do. I also like being able to greet new players, and craft them low level armor and weapons to give them a head start if they want it.  Some don't, some do, either way it's all good, cause in the end, it's just a game, and it's meant to be fun.  I couldn't do that kind of thing for new players if I didn't collect excess resources.
---
you wont find ladders in any fallout titles because as Todd Howard himself said they "fuck with the Character AI" 
---
Patches like the latest piss off the playerbase and a certain percentage of people will grief because there is nothing else in the game for them.
---
Sucks. 
---
To be honest I have given up on this game. 
---
I tried and tried and persisted. 
---
I put up with the bugs and quirks. 
---
I finally got to the end (far too quickly for my liking). I launched a nuke and got my X01 complete with calibrated shocks and a jet-pack. 
---
The final straw was when I went out in my newly
---
Modified X01 and lost one of the legs. 
---
I didn‚Äôt trade it or scrap it. It simply disappeared. 
---
I am not going to spend hours and hours server hopping to get another calibrated shock to simply wander around re-doing daily quests and events. 
---
Bethesda really screwed this game up. 
---
The price drop to 35 was only for holidays. It's back up to 60 no2
---
Like I mentioned. I'm not saying to not complain at all. I'm saying to not repost the same subject. Instead just comment on a post that explains the same thing
---
I feel I should apologize for lumping the Fallout community into one group. Not everyone is of an understanding nature and some only have social media as a means to enact their slight bit of power through anonymous means. I am sorry.
---
And here I was cheating this entire time in pretty much all games that had a bank/stash limit by harmlessly creating character to stock on them some useful stuff. My...
---
Oh, btw : 
---
Cheating : act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage.
---
I think you have an issue with the "unfairly" (because everyone can't mule ofc) or dishonest (because rules prevent muling)
---
Guessing¬†is to reach a partly (or totally) unqualified conclusion¬†while assuming ¬†is to authenticate by means of belief; to surmise; to suppose to be true, especially without proof.¬†
---
Dude, the 'misc' footage shows him doing exactly what he claimed he was doing..  instead of what the ban letter claims he was doing...  so yeah.. footage=proof he was telling the truth.
---
I don't have a choice I got the digital copy and pre ordered so I will wait and see I understand it's a HUGE game and it would be hard to get every bug! But my thing is you have a community TELLING YOU WHAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED! And instead you say fuck them! Make guns useless! I'm not pissed about the nerf cause yes tse was WAY OPS! But a 50-60% nerf would have been a good starting point! 
---
And Armor... And Pipe Weapons... And... everything Soon‚Ñ¢  
---
Yeah i am done with this.
---
I just don't get what happened. Bethesda has never been the most competent dev, but the sheer amount of incompetence around Fallout 76 is blowing my mind. Accidentally reverting fixes from a previous patch? Wtf.
---
Is this why Fallout 4 was such a mess at release? Is it sheer luck that Fallout 4 and Skyrim weren't train wrecks?
---
I tried really hard to like Fallout 76, but I've hit a point where I just can't excuse them anymore. I don't think I've ever seen a AAA dev fuck up this badly. 
---
Im on ps4 and the number key pad pylon has never worked correctly for me.
---
I like your mods.  Ignore this asshat please.
---
Keep up the good work guys!
---
I used Known Plans, long before they added it to the game.
---
I need to get Perk Loadouts and one other one back on soon.  It's painful not having them.
---
You guys rock :)
---
You still duped, dumbass
---
Browse Bethesdas support forums, or ask a support person to recover something that went missing from your inventory.  All the citations you need are there for the looking.
---
Banned from all of Bethesda
---
Sure let's go scream on reddit anyway to prove their point.
---
If you didn't do anything wrong then you wouldn't be in this situation. Therefore you did something wrong
---
Dude. Just scroll past them. Sheesh.
---
I'm fine with the TSE nerf. 
---
Actually no I'm not they shouldn't have nerfed two shot or Demo Expert. That was stupid. But Bethesda did post saying that they will release a new update very soon that fixes that problems in this one. Probably wait a week or 2
---
I agree, but I think the main thing is that the devs should be been more clear, explaining how the plan for this is to use this not as a new fallout fan but just something to tide fallout fans over until the next one after skyrim and stuff, and that it's meant to be a ongoing and updated game. Not a full launch game. 
---
They really need to look HARD at paying modders for mods that work.
---
Known plans has been a mod for at least a month.  The mod worked better than the Bethesda implementation.
---
Ark paid modders and implmented the work into the  main game.
---
Bethesda should pay modders and do the same thing :)
---
Hah, amazing
---
You heard from an unreliable source.  Duping is not back.  They took the fact that bobby pins were rolled back to 0.1lbs and extrapolated incorrectly that the rest of the glitches came back, too, which is simply not true.
---
I did scroll past, more came up
---
Yep, soon enough people will learn. I used to be the type who get games day one, but after being screwed over by games like The Division, Destony 1 and 2, no way in hell am I going to get Division 2 or Anthem any time soon. I'll wait a few months until the truth about the games comes out. 
---
I'll wait months or a year for any games as a service games from now on because they will never release finished or unbroken.
---
Just black out your email, man. Not that hard.
---
&gt;why do you want to see that version of the email
---
To see proof it came from Bethesda‚Äôs servers.
---
they eventually made their promises live. It is now coop, they improved the story, gameplay, graphics.
---
Yeah, it will (and should !!) still be remembered as a huge scam at launch, but at least they didn't run away with the money and tried to right their wrongs.
---
Welcome to grindout 76 ü§ì
---
Gotta love the modern 'always connected' enforcement 
---
hope the guys who did this are making extra hours to save their game, or at least care a bit. Please Bethesda, recruit some real developers and a QA team. Show some worry about the f game.
---
This last patch, my mood completely shifted. The fact that 95% of the patch was weapon and perk nerfs was just a slap in the face for me. The fact that despite all of these huge issues making the game difficult to enjoy, they still chose to focus on nerfing every last thing they could that still made this game bearable. THAT is what their patches are now focused on? Reducing the benefits of some of the best perks. Reducing weapon damage, and increasing the amount of materials it takes to repair things? It‚Äôs like they want us gone! How could they shift their focus on nerfing when the game is barely playable as is and need TONS of quality of life patches first!
---
Got a snarly go round in circles like a dog going to sleep ...
---
I was always curious about that, so hey that's good knowledge to have LOL
---
Hopefully they read the uproar from the community and fix the fuck ups they made! Still will be playing the game cause I paid100 for it lmao but I am hesitant to buy another Bethesda game after this
---
You‚Äôre making jokes when your game is completely broken? You should be fired devan.
---
Yep thanks we got it mate
---
I wish they would let you make them in batches of 10,50, 100, whatever, instead of one at a time. F stupid the way it is now.
---
Thank you very much for telling me this. I‚Äôm relieved 
---
I had the same problem, but I waited around a minute and it appeared. Though you might have a different problem.
---
&gt; Those vaults better be gigantic content updates
---
Pfft. Expect at best to get a copy/paste of Vault 75 from F4.
---
I go on that subreddit every now and again to see how it had progressed after all these years.
---
Last time I checked they had taken the Z OUT OF DayZ.
---
Seriously, if they fix this update, Two Shot, and Demo I'll never complain again
---
One of the people who's tributes to the "round up" is responsible for one of the map mods available for the PC version of '76, but most of us have avoiding modding the game, trying instead to enjoy it.  
---
As for what can be brought to the console, most if not all of the errors / bugs we've passed along would benefit all, console or otherwise, and it one was of the PlayStation Brethren that helped provide the clues to run down the "HUD" issue, effecting players, regardless of platform. 
---
Welcome to what I call the Nuke Nerf.
---
Find a play style that was OP, and literally nuke nerf it until all the players run away from it like the plague.
---
I used to sell two shot weapons, yes ONE STAR two shot...........for about 2,000 caps each on the market.  I'm down to listing it for 1,000 caps and still nobody is biting.  I may go dump it in a trash can soon.  It's literally not worth the carry wait I'm losing while waiting for it to sell.
---
I pop an ultra-light mod on every armor piece I stash. The guys of it is weapons. 
---
F4 used to have ‚Äúlight‚Äù receivers that make guns lighter if used. F76 has them in a few niche cases (broadsided has one) but most of the time it‚Äôs just tearing it all down to base mod configuration to save up on space.
---
And still, the fans plead with Bethesda.....
---
Is their a button above like!!! Cause this is straight facts!!!!!! Dial it back to about 50-60% and FIX THE GOT DAMN DUPLICATION BUG! 
---
I had 1 level of this perk and it did almost no damage to the enemies. I ditched it pretty fast as it wasnt worth it. I barely noticed a sliver loss even though an attack on me would do far more damage. Idk if this has had any correction with a patch though.
---
After dying as a respawn fast travel while over encumbered? This would be news to me. 
---
You should get a Fallout Game that comes out if it isn't online it doesn't have as many problems because they have experience with offline. This is their first Online Game (which is why it's so glitchy for people) cut Bethesda some slack. It's like drawing for the first time, being proud, and everyone calls it ugly
---
Thanks, I play on ps4 but people like you made my experience on fallout 4 amazing. Hopefully they can get you helping them out. I feel like there's not many people working on a massive work load. Fresh eyes would help. I'm sure the guys and gals doing the fixes would want the help too. :(
---
Upvoted!
---
No, it doesn't belong to me, it "belongs" to every person who paid for the game.   
---
Regardless of ownership, it doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
---
It's been what, almost 3 months since launch. 
---
In all this time the game breaking bugs like AI and animation glitches are still here. What exactly have they fixed?
---
 Almost nothing of worth, most of the patches are nerfs which I am almost certain were made to artificially increase the time sink players have to go through to advance, in order to keep them playing, in the hopes of them buying stuff from the horrible cash shop.
---
And to top it all off, now they are rollbacking to older versions of the game and bringing back bugs and exploits which were presumed fixed. This is a gross incompetence from their part, do these people not know how to use version control in a software company? I mean come on, enough is enough
---
Haha oh my god good one 
---
Any chance the 'every mod plan' will apply to the rare vendors? It'd be nice to not have spent 2 hours trying to buy the mirror ball plan from Grahm / buy drug plans from the bunker that aren't serums / buy X-01 mod plans.
---
Also the ability to re add the 'prototype' paint to the X-01 would be rather nice (as it only currently comes with a freshly made X-01 piece).
---
I've got a crazy idea! How about Bethesda let's the community decide on the next few patches bet this game will be AMAZING! After all we're the ones who have to play it....
---
I have though lol 
---
Because they want you to stick around and buy micro transactions and those lunch boxes that are coming. That‚Äôs why they created this game, to push micro-transactions like every other live service game does 
---
Now guys you know perfectly well that after release most of the team moved onto the next project so now they can only work so fast cause there are only so many people. I can't even begin to imagine where they could find the extra hands familiar with the engine on short notice to tackle the breadth of the work that needs to be done. 
---
*slowly turns to stare at the "seperate" atomshop team*
---
yep... no idea at all whatever will bethesda do?
---
Most legendary drops are base configuration anyways. In any case, it doesn‚Äôt quite work when there‚Äôs a market of people that want a full set of vanguards/bolstering/unyielding/etc.
---
I main LMG because I like to inflict pain on myself. so I'm always in need of .308.
---
Lets not...
---
I thought this already caught on but it really depends on who is playing on the server. I always drop stuff in there and normally others do the same, especially after a SBQ fight.
---
Normally the suitcase ends up getting filled up with 10 or more Ultracite Explosive Vent plans ;)
---
Hopefully it doesn't get saved into your inventory as phantom weight.  Luckily ammo doesn't weigh that much.
---
Party‚Äôs over for you lol. After this last patch,  no one is defending this game anymore. 
---
Exactly, TSEs are overpowered because of Explosive dial down the explosive to 50% and stop duplication. This would solve the TSE crisis. I've been killed by 3 TSE people today. I don't really mind, theyll get banned and I don't care about caps.
---
yeah i have a thread about mine. i crafted less than 20 gamma guns and scrapped them for the mods
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alko1s/crafted\_a\_few\_gamma\_guns\_to\_learn\_mods\_got\_banned/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alko1s/crafted_a_few_gamma_guns_to_learn_mods_got_banned/)
---
how the fuck are we supposed to know not to craft shit unless we are dupers/know how to dupe via mass crafting
---
I had a doggo named that when I was a kid. :‚ÄôC
---
I just don't get how a AAA Studio is fucking up this bad. I mean, Oblivion, Skyrim and Fo4 (I can't really remember much about FO3) had major issues, but it was never this bad.
---
Have they been this incompetent for a while and we just got lucky that the aforementioned games weren't trainwrecks, or did something change recently? The sheer incompetence surrounding FO76 is mindblowing. 
---
I know some authors would love to be paid, others think money pollutes the process...  
---
Regardless of anyone's stance, it would benefit us all if they did reach out.
---
Bro. Smoke some weed or eat some edibles it‚Äôs highly likely your disability will feel better. And enjoy getting griefed while you‚Äôre low level when you get higher level it gets boring and you get no attention. Like a step child you only get attention when you‚Äôre a baby. 
---
Of course people complain. An AAA game should not have any bugs at all really.
---
You're not being through their armor. The highest damage resistant in pve is 300 whereas player can easily have over 600. Thereby negating your power attacks.
---
no
---
One time I was at my armor workbench when I noticed someone come into my house I made. He worked at my weapons workbench, so I was like ‚Äúcool.‚Äù I got out and tried to wave to him, he stood there. A moment later he started meleeing me. I killed him. He respawns, kills me. I respawn, he‚Äôs in the woods by my house sniping at me. I go up there and kill him. He respawns, I kill him again. He respawns, and fucking fat mans my house. As soon as I heard the nuke shot I fucking left the game. 
---
That shit was hilarious as fuck. I was like level 20 and this guy was level 50. He got stomped by someone 30 levels below him so he decided to just mini-nuke their house. Pathetic. 
---
On pc my self Andychal11 happy to help

Ive been playing bethesda games since morrowind and the only time quest markers bother me is when the game gave no information at all about where you need to go, but your character somehow knows the exact spot. These things are extremely rare though.
---
As a SWE "merge of internal development builds failed to execute properly" sounds like bullshit. What obscure version control tool are they using? Merges don't just "fail to execute properly" in Git or SVN. Do they have no build management process? No release branch? Either someone fucked up royally and they are BSing us, or they are seriously incompetent.
---
Which Fallout are you playing?
---
You can't change or exchange any of your perk cards at any time.
---
You can only re-arrange a single SPECIAL point after level 50.
---
I‚Äôm just as disappointed in the sub as I am in the current state of the game. But at the same time, I‚Äôm hopeful in seeing both flourish down the line.
---
Indeed, reading nonsense that isn't even a complete thought is something I don't have much experience with.
---
Your plan sounds like bringing heavy guns in line with others in terms of dps and ammo efficiency. I do agree on the issues here but I would like to see more focus on the guns distinction, other way all guns will become rifles, but looking weirdly. 
---
Heavy guns need to become a specific gameplay. Heavy means they should do tons of damage! My opinion is that minigun-type shit should do INSANE dps, they are big, non-stealthy and ammo-hungry for a reason! Broadsiders, rocket launchers should one-shot any kind of enemy except for SB is modded and perked well. 
---
Pistols imo need specific crit mechanics tied to them or being dual-wieldable. Ohnestly, pistols suck now!
---
Laser weaponry should posses extreme accuracy and VATS hit bonus innately.   
---
Sentinal, assassins, fireproof etc. There are loads of armor and perks that mitigate loads of damage
---
That makes a sad amount of sense. 
---
You nailed it, half the time it's just about a fresh set of eyes that understand enough to know what to look for.  
---
Most of us aren't claiming we can do it better (as some suggest, right or wrong), we just think we can contribute and make it better for everyone. 
---
Very helpful, though as one of the comments points out, the force isn't anything.
---
&gt; I am not 100%, but to my understanding the effectiveness of a weapon might also have to do with the physical shape and material of the projectile.
---
&gt; For instance, an AK-47 round is larger, with potentially more kinetic energy than an M-16.
---
&gt; However, the AK-47 has a tendency to exit the target on the other side, while the M-16 round has a tendency to twist on impact, leaving a much more deadly wound.
---
&gt; A wound with metal in it, is a lot worse than one without.
---
That's true. That's one of the things I complained about. I have an abundance  of everything. That's why I hate it when people complain when I request for Bethesda to make the game harder. Cause it's to easy.
---
Yeah, the responses seem super artificial and not genuine at all.  It's as if the dude was instructed to say thank you followed by the user name then whatever else.
---
60% seems to be the magical number lately. Perks reduced to 60%, event timers increased 60%.
---
Legendary effects reduced... well lets just leave it at that.
---
now he has ladydevann in the next room calling out community concerns faster than he can write them down
---
Righto, off work and will log into FO76. Sounds like I will be the only one playing today, should be an easy farm session then, I need screws, plastic and some bal. fiber. Oh and the Excavator mod plans. You buggers better not be on the server when I login.
---
Yeah that's why I was curious. It's a combat rifle with two full rifleman cards and 30% level of demo expert. Before it did about 190 and I had 40% demo. So that means the base damage was nerfed too? 
---
I know you are trying to looking at it as if the glass is glass is half-full and not trying to rain on your parade but even if you "only" got a TS, it still got a major nerf. If i had a TSE I would be happier than only having a TS since it would still be better.
---
But that's just imo.
---
Agree.
---
Plasma Gatlin gun down a scorchbeast in less than 5 lol
---
It goes on ground after like 1 or 2 minutes, bloodied super sledge and I kill it in another 1 minute
---
As much as I'm enjoying this game (I'm a fairly new player) I do feel I'm gonna hit a wall of boredom at some point and the only way I can see them fixing this game is with massive updates that literally add and change almost the entire game, kinda like No Mans Sky did.
---
If Hello Games can save a doomed game then Bethesda and all their money should definitely be able to do something about Fallout 76.
---
I don't usually have problems with the game either
---
But so many people have been calling it unplayable
---
Over the last patch before the most recent they mainly had it taken care of to where if it did bug out you would at least be able to fast travel to the closest location to your dead body. Now I have a completely blank map (no locations) and as far as I‚Äôm aware of you can‚Äôt fast travel to friends while over encumbered. So pretty screwed. If I have to leave the server for something like that, it kills my vibe for playing fallout. 
---
Eyebots?
---
Did they nerf explosive damage on grenades or just explosive damage Percival cards?
---
Thanks for buying the game twice. Your support will help keep me entertained for months to come!
---
Thanks for the info.
---
same here.  i spend hours building CAMPs.  nice builds BTW
---
Upvote this now everyone
---
Good thread
---
My God, that title. I can't believe that's a real sentence. Only Bethesda... 
---
In co op
---
i had a problem with phoenix last night.  kept hammering away on the "R" button, but it would not go in to trade mode.  no msg, no nothing.  finally gave up and logged off.
---
Works just fine. Nobody cares what misc mod you have on the piece you‚Äôre selling. They can fix that themselves. They just care for the legendary effects. 
---
Ultra-light reduces the weight of a piece from &lt;5 to &lt;1, or of a heavy piece from 10-12 down to 5-7. (Or of most weightless pieces down to absolute zero even with high material mods). Is your friend. Use it. 
---
As I haven‚Äôt tried with the most recent patch but the patch before this one wouldn‚Äôt allow me to fast travel while over encumbered after death, I think it was always to the closest location to my dead body or vault 76 and my camp. 
---
This game is bombing in January 2019...Bethesda is deleting negative comments lol
---
A AAA game on a large open world scale with some bigs is excusable. Look at GTA, Red Dead, precious Beth titles, etc. It's the fact this is a multiplayer game with glaring bugs that be found within minutes of casual play that can ruin the game not only for yourself but for the others on the server as well.
---
So is it just anything that has to use the Bethesda.net launcher or does that also cover side projects that have their own seperate launchers like ESO?
---
Sure, still not acceptable for him to get banned from all his games and account. Just ban his F67 account. Getting a ban to all your singleplayer games because one online game? Wut?
---
Feels that way doesn‚Äôt it?
---
Was attacked while talking to Harper Ferry vendor. Got to him with [Hidden] was crouched, wearing chameleon armour (and thus invisible) with all stealth perks purchased and enabled.
---
Got ambushed and beaten to death by 6 SuperMutants.
---
So, not just you.
---
Yeah happend to me aswell. But with a molerat. He chased me around inside the asylum and finaly i died. Could not kill it :/
---
Yeah this has happened so much to me. Even right at the beginning when I was level 3 at Flatwoods the event started up and suddenly all the robots were everywhere hunting me down and I didn't have a clue what was going on. I thought the event was the quest and it was always like this. I couldn't do any real damage to the supervisors, and there were too many other mobs to cope with. Thankfully the team of high levs (35 seemed high then) killed the robots and ended the event and I got some rewards... I didn't understand why the game just dumped stuff into my pockets either. Strange beginings.
---
They likely are, but I've gotten multiple emails from the "support team" in the past that I should post the bugs to social media to get traction on the issues.  
---
I think they are telling us that because of how fragmented the support is..  
---
I've tried, gotten little traction In the past, maybe "this time" the ball will roll fast enough to make an impact..   
---
There is certainly enough outage to get the attention of those upstairs from the community, so maybe we will get lucky and those upstairs will pay attention / notice us this once. (Pardon the rambling)  
---
You say indeed because you watch anime?
---
Im sure you struggled no more saying that 200 hours of streams no one is ever going to watch, would proove anything.
---
I've yet to see any of those. Too bad, I was rewarded a PA frame at around level 35 or so with full Ultracite. I'm only at 55 and don't have the materials to maintain the armor, so I'm still in X-01 prototype.
---
Yes let‚Äôs talk about me.  It was fun
---
Cool
---
Thanks..
---
Just..... don't pick up more then you need.
---
This. Same problem. Removing it fixed things.
---
Pretending that canvas bag thing had any actual meaning beyond giving people something else to bitch about is insanity. No one even noticed their bag was wrong for three weeks. About half of the ‚Äúissues‚Äù were a joke that obfiscated real issues. The people on this sub who posted a daily upvote farm thread are just as to blame as Bethesda. 
---
SNeak doesn't work for me anymore.
---
I've tried max rank for a few days. It barely scratches the attacker, like 1% of the attackers HP. It does proc off SB screech but even standing in their spam you'll hardly notice it does damage. Procs off friendly Whitespring robots shooting at something else, causing aggro onto you.
---
 The only practical use it could have is for PvP, but obviously it's PvE only.
---
bugthesda shill
---
I'd put my money on the one that's moving at the speed of sound though
---
This will all change after the Hotfix.
---
You picked the wrong kinda game then...MMORPG games are designed for grind. even the people who are lvl 300+ despite spending their time leveling in an easy xp white springs still had to grind for it. 
---
Lol yes!!
---
That‚Äôs weird, but yeah I‚Äôm finally in a stable sever after having to server hop 3 times and closing app and restarting lol 
---
Yep it's off, unless shotguns received some special treatment. Wouldn't be surprised if they got, since explosive effect to apply to each of the shotgun pellets, would be rather broken anyway.
---
I played this game the same way I played fallout 4, but with my wife.
---
Do the plot, launch a nuke kill the dudes, then put it away and wait for the DLC.
---
I'm not going to waste my time theory crafting a build.  This isn't Destiny, they didn't even put a fake grind in (light levels) they put in an RNG hunt, but without any real motivation to hunt for it.
---
But that's ok, it's a single player game that can be played co-op.  I don't play fallout 4 or fallout 3 anymore either.  So I'm not sad about 76.
---
COULD it have been better? Damn right it could have! But I'm not salty.
---
If OP is in any EU nation this would be a lovely time to contact their consumer protection and EU representatives about this. I'm sure they'd love to know this shit is going down 
---
Thanks for the vote of confidence, hoping there is enough good will left to make it hard for Bethesda/Zenimax to keep ignoring us.
---
Was my wifes account, who quit because she has the lost pipboy bug. If you fail at trying to be an asshole im curious what you actually succeed at.
---
This patch has officially made me take a break. I can't handle InventoryManagement76 anymore. Please listen to this community, Beth. 
---
Actually, Bethesda goofed when implementing that. He was still successful at selling his saved legendaries, even a couple thousand pounds over the limit. 
---
And he mostly uses the Quantums for healing, though he's definitely chugged them for caps at least once. (I use the 500 or so I gratefully accepted for healing.)
---
&gt; They want some of the market share of PUBG, COD and Fortnite. 
---
They're not getting it with this, lmao. No fan of those games is going to go to Fallout 76 with as bad a reputation as it already has and having inferior gunplay that every game you listed.
---
I've seen it several times and done it a couple of times myself.
---
It's a little "the rich helping the rich" since the bog is a pretty end level area but still. Take what you need and leave the rest for the next person :)
---
Sadly this is one of the only two side quests which live up to fallout reputation. 90% time we are doing shooting/scrapping/server hopping.
---
This ^ 
---
lol, you have no idea what the database structure on the server side is. And if you think it's the exact same as in fallout 4 then you are *probably* extremely wrong (I say probably because it's doubtful anyone on this sub has seen it). And no, the 'engine' is not just split, that's not how it works.
---
OOF
---
Looks like I overpaid for my F76 (paid $6)...
---
I'm not saying it wasn't fair (my philosophy is: if the game allows it, I should deal with it), it's just that it added insult to injury.
---
There is a special needs player I play with that has the same issue.  His problem was that he just carried his entire inventory on him because he always thought he needed everything.    This is so stupid...  
---
here's another post about this : [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alm3ic/psa\_dont\_craft\_mass\_amounts\_of\_weapons\_to\_scrap/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alm3ic/psa_dont_craft_mass_amounts_of_weapons_to_scrap/)
---
Maybe if you actually played the game instead of hanging around the same golf course all the time you would get a lot higher and get the guns/armour you want, i made a second character the other day an had that to level 11 in under a hour just by travelling killing enemies around that level and suitable quests and events, i dont know wtf your doing to be at that level for so long but it obviously isn't the right way. 
---
The aim of the game isnt to tag a high level an wait for us to kill it....
---
&gt;AAA
---
AAA is an **informal** classification used for video games produced and distributed by a mid-sized or major publisher, typically having higher development and marketing budgets.   
---
It doesn't mean anything at all. It's gibberish spouted by a horde of barnacles trying to make a living from the game industry while not actually producing anything of any real value to anyone.
---
Actually, all pedantry aside, I'm not sure that's legal. Taking back the offline games that you bought and paid for may actually count as theft, or at the very least breach of contract.
---
These devs are too dumb to create a system where direct Fatman hit causes massive damage while outskirt hit does less...
---
Forget PvP. PvE is broken as well.
---
Go into a cave as lvl 10, kill lvl 20 ghouls, a lvl 100 player comes in, and the lvl 10 dies while fighting newly spawned lvl 60 ghouls on the way out.
---
Don't even bother with PvP until PvE is fixed 
---
The true fans play singleplayer games guys. They bought 76 played the plot, and left for another game.
---
The crazies, they expected an amazing MMO or an epic shit show.  The crazies that expected a shitshow for what they expected, and the true fans got an "ok" game that they aren't playing anymore (same as any other singleplayer game they've finished).
---
The method that I saw someone use did involve a world container, but it was explained to me that that was merely efficient/convenient, not integral to the method. It's just faster than the trade menu and safer than a paper bag.
---
I highly doubt that this was intentional. It feels too much like the game being a moron and not functioning correctly.
---
I love how you took something that usually makes other players extremely mad and turned it into a hilarious meme. Good job!
---
Shouldn‚Äôt have duped. Bethesda said they were gonna, now every duper is butt hurt the got banned. 
---
Should have specified that: first gen PS4. We all know that Bethesda never cared to optimize their games for Sony systems, but this is ludicrous. Thanks for taking care to comment.
---
They are playing the game. If they feel like destroying your shit, they have all right to do so. Get over it.
---
And a few days in rehab
---
You'd think Bethesda would be thrilled to have free software fixes, especially since it seems they can't be bothered to fix bugs themselves...
---
I'm sure it's along the lines of corporate bullshit and I feel for the team working on it. Thanks for doing what you do many people appreciate it 
---
The problem is not that it is a huge drain on resources. The problem is is that it is a huge drain on resources without any consistent or worthy reward. I think nobody would have a problem with it being a bullet sponge if it dropped loot a raid boss should.
---
He got banned because manipulating files in a MMO game. Just a simple fact.
---
Now he has to plead his case.  
---
Regardless of my knowledge of how things work or not.  It was his choice to risk that and he accepted it.
---
Very simple concept.
---
*16x the detail*
---
What a meme.
---
With demo on my bunker buster does 330 now and my 2se lever action does 309
---
In Everquest, WoW, LOTRO, WildStar, and SWTOR, I struggled with money at the highest level.   Its common in MMO.
---
Why did you have to use a "mule"? Couldn't you play the game the way it was intended to, like a normal person?
---
I call that cheating. Yes, Bethesda shouldn't have banned your account but you aren't innocent either.
---
Lvl 136 here, mine also dropped at lvl 25 :/ Must be a static level drop. 
---
I changed servers twice and the white spring vendors didn't restash caps so i changed servers again and went to a railroad. Still no caps.
---
Wtf
---
Oh that happens to me every now and then it's annoying but it doesn't happen too often, they should fix it in the next Hotfix coming really soon
---
You agree to a separate TOS for each game you purchase and play. Violation of one TOS should not immediately effect the TOS contract across the board when your actions had no violation in their own tos
---
Welp this was 9 hours ago
---
It is officially tomorrow
---
Your move angry boi~
---
Who are u?
---
So? For weeks it was nerf tse nerf tse. 
---
7 Days to Die is fun. It has also been in Steam Early Access for five years but is still a more playable game than FO76.
---
Sue them for theft of property - be sure to document their behavior, your steps and take them to court. If you don't stand up for yourself, no one else will and you'll be another statistic.
---
I did a post on this late last night on why Fallout 76 is having these issues, and it all has to do with them relying on their newest annexed team to provide all of the bug fixes for the game. Bethesda Austin, who also retrofitted Fallout 4‚Äôs code with netcode to make online possible, is completely overwhelmed with what Bethesda places on their lap. 
---
It seems that Fallout 76 may have been a stress test for if Bethesda‚Äôs creation engine could handle online, moreso than they actually cared about making the best game possible with the Fallout IP. There‚Äôs still job listings posted online looking for people to help fix the game. This will be a very slow recovery if they even plan to make continuous improvements to the game, rather than just deal with bugs and nerfing aspects that add artificial longevity to the game.
---
Any comments on people receiving bans for normal gameplay due to false flags and then never getting a response to their appeal?
---
Todd's master plan to slowly turn it into Skyrim.
---
It's weak for non natural explosive weapons which is fine in my book, I'd love to see a meta that isn't EVERYONE running explosive guns 
---
Wtf is this meaningless paragraph? you openly admit to being an outsider to the 76 community- talking fully out of your ass because this game isn't exactly like 4 or new Vegas and you ha e nothing better rto do in life than to bitch? 
---
*Quintesssentially incorrect* 
---
Eat shit you pretentious fuck
---
What proof would you like? No one sane would divulge the method, thus making it easier to patch, let alone make a video for proof that could get them banned. I saw it done, so I know that it's possible. You can believe what you like.
---
Same with the iceboxes at white springs  lots of people ditch unwanted Legendaries in them. Sadly we also have the assholes who wander up and loot the whole thing and they end up on market and bazaar lol
---
Im not going anywhere
---
 Serious question,  does the TOS actually indicate a ban would include a ban from accessing their launcher? If so this would be legit. 
---
Good thing their single player games are easily acquired for free
---
"What's that barking sound?"
---
That's exactly my point stop reusing the same subject make a subreddit called FO76 complaints or whatever this subreddit is meant to help fellow players not to trash Bethesda.
---
The game was rushed out in time for the holiday season. That was the major fault.
---
Damn, disconnects are the worst, I can easily understand your frustration.
---
No game that's released should have this many bugs
---
And if you didn‚Äôt know it was a duper?
---
What are you supposed to do with the dupers? Completely avoid interacting with them? Kill them and leave their items for someone else?
---
There‚Äôs a reason people who come into contact with counterfeit bills aren‚Äôt arrested.
---
I played Rust for a while- every server I was on was just PVP-obsessed griefers going out of their way to destroy other player's bases and the players themselves.  Saw a lot of racist shit being tagged with paint/spray effects too.  It's a game for trolls.  
---
White knight is still a solid perk. 
---
they are just bored with the game, like so many others, and have fallen to the lowest of the low.......raiders.  shoot the scum on site, and take their cookies too!!
---
i actually did some raiding for the 1st time last night.  some one had a workshop i use every day, they were level 35, i was 34.  i attacked, killed them, they respawned, killed me, we went back and forth like this for about 20 minutes.  then the other player decides to bring out their one shot one kill weapon, and i quit the PvP.  here i was, actually HAVING SOME FUN IN FO76, and this toad ruins it all with some uber weapon.  PvP can be fun, but most have turned in to a joke.
---
my primary toon is level 120, and i STILL do not have a weapon that can kill another player in one shot, wellll maybe some fresh meat right out of vault 76.  :-P
---
What the hell Bethesda? People weren't leaving this sinking ship of a game fast enough for you, so you had to start throwing them overboard? 
---
Is taking breaks from games not normal? Am I supposed to play 1 game religiously for months on end?
---
Ya'll should try taking breaks more often, no matter the game state.
---
My new server has a lot of Whitespring robots dropping dead at random.
---
&gt; It renders nice looking static objects,
---
They really should just turn this game into GMOD.
---
Yeah my Nuka Cola armor helmet now has that atom shop sign, I have a red headlamp on it
---
However, Todd Howard, Pete Hines...deafening silence....
---
Being +200 (with another guy) and destroying someones camp who has -100 levels than u without no fucking reason is to be pathetic and stupid, if they are like this in a game i dont imagine how they are in real life
---
PS4
---
After patch I can't repair my armor anymore and I'm not willing to change my whole armor to another. 
---
Ah that sucks. :(
---
Given the duping introduced severe server instability, I disagree; if they have reasonably strong evidence that you were either duping or benefiting off of duping then locking you out all of your online services is entirely reasonable, and that includes delivery of video games and DRM identifiers.
---
I *do* think Bethesda banning them without reviewing the evidence that they asked him to provide is very much not OK, and that they should be required to reply to his attempt to provide them evidence in a timely fashion.
---
Thanks for the info. Wish the perk could be better. :/
---
Hope someone does. You can play with me on PS4 I'm not on the quitting band wagon hahaha
---
ok.  kinda funny.
---
Yeah you have a valid point, wouldn‚Äôt surprise me.
---
I say the same thing
---
I get that they have been dealt a shit hand because they had to push forward and not delay the release but I‚Äôll never trust them again but I‚Äôll try. 
---
P.S. if they go under because of this mess I‚Äôll be putting in a bid for the fallout I. P.  Is that something you would get behind? 
---
Well, I'm listening. What do you have to say to us? Also what system are you on and where are you currently located. Just for posterity.
---
TLDR: Nerfs across the board, making the game more tedious no matter what your build.
---
If you played 4 with a pile of mods or even vanilla you should be used to those load times, it's literally 30 fucking seconds to wait for a full load, that's some straight inpatient bullshit. Your rad arch has a concrete base, put it anywhere with a concrete floor dude
---
No, I'm fucking done. I'll still consider playing their games if they get any better, but at this point Bethesda's in a heated race with EA for "Worst Video Game Company" as far as I'm concerned. 
---
i do the same thing at whitesprings.  the ice cooler to the left of the golf club entrance.
---
/r/patientgamers
---
Bullet sponging is a serious problem for high level enemies. 
---
I would be fine if all high level enemies did as much damage as a lv 50 Mr Gutsy if they didn't take so many bullets to kill them. 
---
PVE time to kill on both sides needs readjustment.
---
I've only searched two containers since the patch and cap collector search option only showed on the first one. Re-logged the next day (24 hrs) and both containers were still empty. I guess good ol' Bethy broke cap stashes and another good perk üòî
---
Majority of the players should not have one of the most rarest weapon in game?   I can easily say the drop rate of any TSE is less than 0.0167% because I have had well over 600 drops and only ever gotten a single Two Shot, and 4 Explosive weapons.  Never had a TSE drop.  (15 Luck on my character).  Rate calculated based on actually finding a single TSE out of 600 drops.
---
Since you mention Majority of Players, I assume you mean players that bought the duped weapons? It made the game harder for *those* people.   Ok, I can see that and that is fine by me.   Its a risk buying weapons you know were gained from cheating, chalk it up to Karma.
---
In my mind, I see the "majority of players" has having normal weapons or legendaries that were not nerfed.  I can see where nerfing the explosives perk would make it harder for those who are using those types of weapons for primary, sure.  But those are not the majority of players either.   The majority probably use rifles that are not TSE.   How exactly did this patch make it harder? 
---
X-01 prototype is better anyway 
---
If u destroy  of people without reason and u have that attidude of having fun being destructive i dont wanna know how you are in real life, i preffer to help people, not being a toxic player, including if ‚Äúits ok‚Äù for the game doing the stuff u do
---
My god! Yes! And they've put it as a weekly challenge 2 weeks in a row
---
...almost like they don't want us to earn atoms
---
...hmmm
---
For the love of god, they only have two settings, don't they? It's either "Fire? What fire? There's no fire here. \*standing in front of a raging inferno\*" or "Quickly! Demolish the entire city to make sure this out-of-control fire doesn't spread! \*looking at a barbecue\*"
---
If you mean questing and loot collection rather than survival, then there are games like Borderlands 2, The Division, or Destiny. If you mean PvP and Survival, then I can't help you. I don't really play those games.
---
Point is? All the CM'S do is talk shit to us it seem's so why not?
---
Funny, you would think paying AAA pricetags entitles you to a competent game that works as advertised.
---
Nah... 
---
Like this last one?
---
Why not? Bugs in games are fun for me because nothing matters in a video game? Bugs in important software can destroy people's lives. Bugs in a video game are irrelevant nonsense.
---
There isn't one. If there is, it's probably the worst QA dev ever
---
Xbox360
---
Xbone
---
VR 
---
switch
---
.. any others? Is blades included or something? 
---
Hrm.. I see.   Oversight? I was looking forward to getting the X01 Jetpack.
---
Ultracite I can kinda see being troublesome to get because SBQ drops plans for the PA.
---
Also, they should give said atoms if they mess up the coding on it. Free to play mobile games show better etiquette than this pricey AAA title.
---
you know, i got the jukebox in my CAMP.  i LOVE classical music.  Grieg's Morning Mood is just astounding.  i wish i could upload my own music to the jukebox, so i can listen to music i like while i am building another CAMP just for the hell of it.  
---
Another request
---
Please add a community test server. Let us discover your bugs while we play the game, have it open for a period of time before an update, then push the after we found the majority of problems. It would give the game a much better view in life and could possibly save the game

More likely they're ramping up for Elder Scrolls 6. Honestly, it'd be stupid of them to sink more resources into 76 at this point. They could turn it into the best game ever made and the bad press, internet hate, and memory of its early days would still kill it.

Got caught eh.

Well thats bad Luck.

lol the dlc that is the same as the base game.. What other game on the market has ever released something as weak as ripping off the base game and calling it DLC :/
---
btw installed the newest gpu drivers, seems fine again, managed to play for several hrs. crossing fingers. last i installed drivers was in mid december, so didnt think that would make a difference. worth a try if your not on the latest already
---
Are you... taking a hundred screenshots then patching them together into a gif? 
---
That's dedication.
---
I have like 70 mini nukes 
---
"We've implemented more items in Atom Store"
---
Asset rips are never a good thing to advertise, if it was a third party that doe it Bethesda would have sued the shit out them
---
It might actually. From what I can understand from the recent update they wrote, they are not going to use the previous version which had the fixed bugged but just patch some of them on the botched build
---
Bulk Junk was never for crafting.

The special Snowflakes just couldnt get over it that Bulking IS FOR SELLING OFF EXCESS MATERIAL.

Slavic card sim probably has more content :/

I just can`t believe what i`m reading on this subredit. Lvl 11 player pissed because he can`t power level at Whitesprings ... dude seriously go play another game. 
---
They made most plans available to get now, but nobody can get them because they cost even more than a mutation. 
---
I was excited to get a t-60 jet pack but then saw the price tag and closed the game out of sadness. 
---
Sounds like becoming a monk...
---
I did a post on this late last night on why Fallout 76 is having these issues, and it all has to do with them relying on their newest annexed team to provide all of the bug fixes and patches for the game. Bethesda Austin, who also retrofitted Fallout 4‚Äôs code with netcode to make online possible, is completely overwhelmed with what Bethesda placed on their lap. 
---
Im sure they forgave you
---
Damn straight! Preach! 
---
Um, what?
---
i get that a lot too.  it seems when i start my play session, the 1st 3 or 4 servers are shit.  can not hold a workshop, do not dare to do any thing that requires me to stay on the server.  usually after the 4th one, i get a stable server and i can run 3 or 4 workshops and get a 6 hour stretch of uninterrupted game play.
---
Isn't the Handsome Jack collection literally all of the games plus dlc?
---
Another day another BS from our beloved company. I swear this game is just one big experiment to see how far one can push people's patience.
---
Would it be possible to just release some smaller balance patches in-between? The only viable option now is probably melee, could we see a fix to base Explosive weapons (like Missile, Grenade, Auto-Grenade launchers) so that they are viable. Logically, when nerfing the perk to increase explosive damage (to counteract TSE weapons being ridiculous) you would also increase the base damage of the standard explosive weapons, so they do not become obsolete, because they already were and now they definitely are. 
---
That logic deserves a upvote good Sir!
---
I want to destroy your base because you're crying about it. If you don't want to deal with people who enjoy laughing because people get butthurt over a game then you might want to reevaluate yourself. Furthermore "helping" people? Do tell. The entire internet wants to hear how you're such a great person by helping level 2s walk to Flatwoods. A toxic player are people that give a game a bad reputation. Meaning those that make it unbearable for others. That's not people who enjoy destroying bases. That's people that scream if they lose. That's people that act like a white knight until they find a target of their vengeance and you see their dark side come out. You're not any better than the rest of us. You're just lying to yourself.
---
How were you hit with a betf
---
Yea i contemplating deleting this game and reinstalling fo4 on my console.
---
That would be a royally stupid idea for Valve to do. As they would be in violation of many countries consumer protection laws and it would open them up to massive lawsuits if they did.
---
Well, I AM reminded the time Bethesda's "QA" allowed a patch to ship that had dragons flying backwards in Skyrim...
---
\[FUS-RO-DERP!\]([https://youtu.be/qRPdr903BrI](https://youtu.be/qRPdr903BrI))
---
Fuck Bethesda, they've jumped the shark. Even if you had been cheating you should only be banned for that game and not the others you have purchased the license and right to use. 
---
Fuck this shit company, they have gone so down hill.
---
Yes, I agree.  Before this Oblivion was king.   I think it was Bethesda that made that.  There was indeed a storm over how Skyrim was done.   But I thought it was great.
---

Bethesda Austin, who also retrofitted Fallout 4‚Äôs code with netcode to make online possible, but had no experience with the creation engine prior to co-developing the game, is completely overwhelmed with what Bethesda placed on their lap. 
---
Have you tried using a fatman? Or a missile launcher? 
---
Explosive modifier adds 10 damage. 60% of 10 is 6. Doesn't make your gun overpowered, but it is doing what it's supposed to.
---
Haha I agree, what they want and what they‚Äôll get are two different things 
---
Following cause I‚Äôm in the same boat, I usually do events but even that starts to get boring...
---
Exactly, we're all getting the PvP servers we've been begging for since launch simply because the CM's heard our pleas and passed them onto the devs.
---
lmao!!  yup, they nerfed it! 
---
i remember once before, i went there, and during one play session, i leveled up about 20 levels
---
Pretty sure class freak doesn't work on the empath mutation too, or at least it feels like it. 
---
Zllvia

---
My tse guns do absolutely no dmg so if you could just make this right I would appreciate that...uhh  thanks...?
---
True.  Not only that he mentioned purposefully going after the dupers to take their stuff.
---
Lol , 600 hours on 76? Do you literally do anything else ? Shouldn‚Äôt of cheated , don‚Äôt be mad cause that ass got caught .
---
Mate my entire build was around demolition expert.  I was the heavy ordanace player for my team, as non of my regular group likes to use grenades/ can actually use them effectively, so they dumped them on me and would call in heavy ordanance like calling in airstrikes when needed.  I also didn't want to wear power armor. Nothing against it, it's for sure powerful and has its moments, but I didn't want to live my entire life in an iron man suit.  So I used white knight and other perks to enhance your abilities not wearing armor.  This whole fucking update completely killed my entire character, which was already a very specific and underpowered playstyle compared to power armor builds.  
---
Absolutely ridiculous "we felt they were too powerful" bullshit.  Very few people charge into situations with a grenade in each hand, or plant mines around buildings and for those that do I can almost guarantee their experiences are like mine and that it is only okay at best for strength.  You need teammates to suppress fire, your throws have to be spot on, you have to not be experiencing server lag (unlikely) or else what looks like a perfect throw an explosion to you ends up being a frustrating waste as creatures walk right through your explosions like they can't be touched.  I am not happy about this at all and I dont understand why Bethesda would think that this was a good idea when people have been constantly talking about how non power armor builds need to be buffed to match them.
---
Here's a thought. So total nerf for some/most after the last upgrade. Why not have a once only after the upgrade "reset character" option? Which resets perk cards only. 
---
LOL that's hilarious. Too bad you can't kill people with airdrop. I tried to stand at the spot where the metal coffin lands during the enclave event, but it didn't crush me.
---
It‚Äôs not about being hard to stay undetected.  I literally spawned into white springs station with no enemies around (no mole rats) etc., and upon crouching I was in [ Caution ] mode and it NEVER changed.  I walked around looking for enemies without finding any until I walked into white springs.  There was no scorchbeasts in the sky, and I even quick traveled a round the map to multiple locations and still had the [ Caution ] state always up. 
---
Stealth in PvE is broken completely.  I‚Äôm on Xbox. 
---
The bars in caution mode were spaced far apart and didn‚Äôt adjust as if enemies were around, and my healing factor mutation would not work due to the [Caution] status always being up so it wasn‚Äôt just a visual bug.  
---
it is just human nature bud.  get used to it.
---
I got my email confirming my canvas bag and was told I'd get another email for Atoms. Almost 2 months now and I still haven't heard a response.
---
Your lucky, I've all on getting my wife to play once a month üòâ
---
Just a duper trying to get karma with a sob story.
---
&gt;who is still trying to enjoy the game
---
If you are actively TRYING to enjoy a game it's time to stop.
---
Videogames are not supposed to be hard work.
---
Gather low levels and kill mirelurk queens or behemoth‚Äôs, and hear them scream in agony
---
my piece of shit gear isnt worth duping. and no bethesda never said the majority of legendaries are duped
---
Just take a break. If you stick around with nothing to do you'll just get burnt out and grumpy like a lot of folks are now.
---
Tse nerf is good. But now I have to spend resource to repair my weapon after each location because enemies are bullet sponge but now I ALSO need to waste more resource because white knight got nerfed. Yay even more junk gatering simulator. Idiots.
---
TBQH it should have been a FO76 only ban. Especially since banning him from accessing his single player games that he purchased is in violation of a number of countries consumer protection laws. If Bethesda bans the wrong person like this they may wind up on the receiving end of a monstrous lawsuit.
---
Don‚Äôt jump the gun there feller, keep in mind that 76 was worked on solely by Bethesda Austin (a team that had never made a game before) and is not representative of future games such as es6 or Starfeild or whateverthehell it‚Äôs called
---
&gt; I also did take items left in paper bags by dupers as I raided a few of their camps but I never duped myself.
---
did you even read the post?
---
You are a crazy person, but that has to be an interesting way to play. How are you making enough ammo to support that plagstyle?
---
The game has always been too grindy, the mechanics have always been poorly thought out and implemented to the point where they are annoying at best and punishing at worst, and the investment to reward ratio has always sucked. The recent patch just brought those issues right into everyones faces. You know it's bad when most of the perks you slot are there simply to try and mitigate the punishing game mechanics and not to enhance your build or get some enjoyment out of it, leaving too few slots left to add and level-up perk cards that could enhance your build, but even then you just can't stack numbers up against the bullet sponge enemies.
---
For example, even with the fully upgraded Vaccinated perk card (a 90% chance to avoid disease from creatures) I can **guarantee** I'll get one when hit for the second time by a 'diseased' ghoul. I'm now doing more damage with a Ski Sword than with my fully modified 2-shot legendary rifle with maxed out Rifleman, Expert Rifleman, Master Rifleman and Tank Killer. The game now feels just like it's designed to be F2P but with no pay to win mechanics - except there is no win.
---
The patches have become a cycle of 'removing an exploit, fixing a bug, introducing 2 more problems, nerfing whatever way we've found to try and enjoy the game, removing any workaround to the punshing game mechanics and updating the Atom Shop with new content'.
---
that was my first thought. i'm pretty sure guys are pretty much forced to work 24/7 right now.
---
That's the reason most people don't want to be community manager or customer service staff. Sacrificial lambs for the customers to vent their anger, stay strong FO76 community managers!
---
And it is pretty awesome. 
---
This is not jumping the gun. This is a long time coming. Especially after all of the horrible ways Bethesda has badly handled their fuck ups, and their exploitative practices regarding the Creation Club; and now FO76. They're dead to me.
---
"... did not know the gun was loaded."
---
Hey Bethesda,  what new bugs do you and should we expect in the next hotfix? It's always a fun surprise to guess what random game breaking bug will pop up next
---
They cannot even help me out with the broken quest Order of Mystery: Novice.    I got ticket response back saying that they had no tools to help.    If they cannot help with fixing bugs in the game, how are they supposed to track exploits?
---
Fashion Fallout is my #1, but Fallout: Home Decor is definitely where I spent most of my time...
---
...until being hit by the glitch that was mentioned in the patch notes. I can't pick up most floors or any foundations, and it sucks. 
---
I used temporarily-placed foundations to flip brick walls so that they showed white on the outside, and one of those got stuck. Then someone destroyed one of those walls and I accidentally scrapped it  instead of repairing it. That left me with two options: have one section of my wall not match, or have another random foundation outside of my house. I chose the latter. Ultimately, I wound up with three. If I hadn't run out of budget, I think that I could have made it a porch or something. As it is, it makes me want to move my camp.
---
I'm glad that the bug is fixed going forward. I just wish they'd managed to fix it for existing structures, too.
---
Yes same things happens as well. What about the infinite loading bug? When entering new interior and or fast traveling...and you can‚Äôt do shit but close the app completely.
---
I don't think my character's cock will be big enough for Conan Exiles
---
Great decision from them. 100% support for banning cheaters.
---
I bought digital Tri-Centennial...
---
Just when you think you know a developer... Every damn time...
---
Are you a fellow "Non power armor grenadier" like myself?  Well former after the recent patch. If so, I feel your pain mate.  I've never had a patch in any game completely and utterly obliterate my playstyle before when the playstyle felt legit before.
---
How is it fucked up ? You deserved it DONT pick up dupes shit of the ground then come over here and just moan , you‚Äôve just admitted they were duped items doesn‚Äôt really matter if you didn‚Äôt dupe them why would you still pick them up ? Because you thought you could make some extra caps or trades out of it and now look your banned lol . Don‚Äôt pick up remains of duped items it‚Äôs common sense 
---
The ammo is a little difficult to come by but worth it when you are fighting the SB queen. 
---
Oxhorn is a sellout
---
did the same...now i am getting paranoid lol.
---
If the code lets you dupe thats their problem. If they dont want duping then they should fix the damn game
---
Yes to this! The under attack animation feels so good. It‚Äôs like your character has been doing it for years... which if you played fallout 4, you have. 
---
Coming from Fallout 4 that trained you to be a pack rat. It is easier said than done.
---
Those arnt problems caused by their devs(Except for 76) those are bad PR moves I agreed but have nothing to do with the quality of their future games
---
This has happened to me, too, but not with so many plans. Several people have said that the Small Water Purifier plan does this for them.
---
Guys we tried but it's over 
---
Can see the adverts now, " not the best game we've ever made (that says something from Bugthesda) but not the worst ever made by anyone ever" Pre order survival dlc now!
---
Just don‚Äôt buy the dlc or you‚Äôll get that same taste 
---
I must've missed that one!
---
well hell, all i do to make money is scavenge, bulk it up, or smelt, then make the vendor rounds.  also, go to west tek.  lots of super mutants there that give caps in loot.
---
perhaps some one else can post on other super mutant locations?  they are great for caps.
---
Hi mate, are you able to direct me to someone who can paint the paladin scheme for my T60? Happy to supply the mats and/or caps to craft for me.
---
Doesn't sound like something fo76 devs can do. In fo4, some modder did it. It was a game changer!
---
Good, make a new account fucking schmuck
---
Normal BP Rifle compared to Normal Fatman will not.
---
That's nonsense. You level up at the same ridiculous pace as the game they copypasted.
---
What's the point of growing tatos when you can eat some dead guy?
---
It is the same company. Trying to separate the two groups as if that justifies it in any way makes absolutely zero sense.
---
I love playing r/outside
---
3 out of 2 people are bad at math...
---
...and they all work for Bethesda.
---
Yep, and did you read where he also said a lot of the stuff he had came from raids?
---
That's a lackluster name...
---
In the end... Bethesda will lose so many gamers that they'll end up regretting their greedy tactics and buggy ass games.
---
i get those too.  i try to limit my fast travel cause of that.  especially when i have my workshops up and running.
---
i have only had the infinite load bug twice since i bought the game 12/1/18.  go figure?
---
Programmatically speaking, if Bethesda fixed the client-side code (what we use) to limit the transmitted values that go to the server using a simple semaphore flag check that every programmer learns about in undergrad, this whole spamming thing could be resolved without having to ban anyone. 
---
But instead of actually fixing the code, they'd rather write an incredibly complex detection algorithm that produces a ton of false positives and bans people with legitimate uses.   
---
Brilliant.
---
Yeah I'm up to date as well, ty
---
I wish they would they would make another server option you can choose after hitting 50 where every enemy is max level. And I mean even in places likes the forest the enemies should scale to 60+. 
---
This would alleviate the issue of high levels ruining areas for low levels and vice versa. 
---
Also it would be nice to be able to explore and do events anywhere on the map and still find max level legendarys and get good xp. 
---
The thing about borderlands is having 1-3 other people to play with is basically mandatory if you want to really have fun but it's not like fallout 76 where having someone to play with makes it better, it's more like it is barely playable without at least one other person. Also you can beat the game in a couple long nights, a week if you take your time and really stretch it out with all the side quests. There are things to do like new game plus and trying new characters but if you are like me or my friends it's more of a play through once every few years type of game. 
---
Not trying to say it's a bad game, quite the opposite it is great. But it is pretty different from 76 and the story is linear so maybe I'm just saying don't get your hopes up too much since a lot of people on this sub seem to think getting only 100+ hours out of a game makes it the biggest let down in gaming history lol.
---
Well. Done. Less events, less exp, less loot, increased costs, more endless grind. Its just not fun to play anymore.
---
I dont agree with muleing BUT by no means should they ban you from your solo games. I could justify multiplayer games but not solo games. You wanna cheat in skyrim for example I could care less its YOUR world.
---
What bit, my rant? 
---
To glue things together after converting them into adhesive?
---
 (Posted from another thread covering the same topic)

---
Lmao the top comment in this thread during this supposedly contentious period is some more run of the mill bullshit, this community is legit worse than Ovewatch or Fortnite
---
The people who develop the games, and the people who handle PR and the general business are different people. The PR sucks but like I said that in no way affects the quality of work the devs put out. What do you not understand 
---
I disagree, if public opinion of no mans sky can flip 180, literally any game has a chance to transform 
---
I do that every time I'm there!
---
After I had a particularly depressing crash the other day and got booted from the server, I finally quit and went back to Fallout 4.
---
I'll keep an eye on the sub for entertainment if nothing else, but also with the small glimmer of hope that perhaps one day, the game will be in the state it should have been at launch, and I will return.
---
Mistakes? You mean lies.   There are multiple videos of Sean saying multiplayer was included on release.
---
I paid 60 bucks for that crap and now just cannot stand to play that game regardless of anything they improved since release.
---
After my camp got destroyed, I never build my camp near train stations anymore. It's like inviting people to wreck your camp. Now I reside on the peak of Seneca Rocks. Haven't seen any clown since. 
---
I hunt super mutants at top of the world, Harper's ferry &amp; sunny top ski lanes. You get caps plus decent amount for their assault weapons etc. I often do several trips to the traders nearby.
---
You could add Grafton to it but I find they are usually lower levels.
---
I don‚Äôt believe you with regards to your post history, and I‚Äôm glad to see Bethesda go this route.
---
Maybe people will think twice about cheating if it‚Äôs risking their entire game library.
---
And this is why piracy isn‚Äôt taken seriously by half of the gaming community 
---
Coupled with, "tHiS iS ThE BeST GamE EveR!!!  ThAnkz BeThs!  U dO No Wr0nG!"
---
Ya gimme my points back! 
---
Yeah I noticed this earlier....annoying asf
---
So your just another one of those average joes consumer with no standards and think nothing of anything lol exactly what the corporations love. 
---
Just know there are real passionate gamers with standards who don‚Äôt like getting fucked in the ass by corporate.   
---
To a lot of people who aren‚Äôt brainless joes who think nothing of anything 
---
This is more than a ‚Äú don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt play it ‚Äú when people bought it already. 
---
That's a bit defeatist. "We're only keeping it alive because we want it to be good" is exactly why people support the game, because if we give up on it then it won't get better and it has the potential to.
---
Why give a BETA away free when you can charge full price for it and give it a micro transaction store...and then to go next level why give DLC or original when you can take away slap damage and call it new content!
---
Bugthesda are in new territory, changing the game and beign a good example for all aspiring gaming companies out there!
---
For me it says that if I use the first or last vendor in the row - if I use the middle one(s) it works. 
---
Don't know about that.  With white knight equipped, dont think I ever, ever repaired a single armor.  By time it got even remotely close to breaking, I had found a better legendary.   I mean I leveled like 8-9 times easily.   Most likely about 10 times.   I stopped using it completely because was just not really needed.  I only use it to reduce repair cost now.
---
I have over 600 hours played.  I haven‚Äôt been banned for a perk going off as intended. 
---
I don‚Äôt believe you are being honest about the full story.  Mistakes do get made, but I‚Äôd like to hear Bethesda‚Äôs response as to what the real reason (specifically) is why you were banned.
---
Did you dupe?  Did you pick up duped items?  Did you exploit game mechanics at vendors?  
---
These are the reasons people have been banned.  Every false ban story I‚Äôve read so far has been a hoax.
---
When you speak the truth and it hurts, you'll get downvotes from fragile people.
---
Like I said to his friend on r/fallout if it means that much them, his 100+ friends should donate $.50 each and he can have a brand new account and game. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs email based. 
---
Instead they‚Äôre just using everyone here to rant and fix they‚Äôre mistakes. He picked up probably thousands of duped items so him and his friends could have an unfair advantage. 
---
I do wanna play the game, but only when it's better. Until then I'll be playing skyrim for a bit.
---
second one always works for me on xbone
---
Fuck me I'm now shitting myself I picked up 19 straight jackets from an asylum run yesterday lol. Hope they don't think I duped em lol
---
There's usually a high turnaround in big game industry because the job is hardly enjoyable, the pay is poor, and you're kinda expected to move elsewhere once you've outlived your youth. Same as any big corp tech company.
---
Crunch time sucks, and so do jaded execs
---
yeah for 20$ :3 
---
I can't really see this happening. My understanding is that once 76 went gold, the original team was probably diverted to their other products (namely Starfield and later TES6) and a C team was put on 76's maintenance going forward.
---
What happened to the *put-your-junk-in-the-corpse-near-Vault-76* concept?
---
You can't profit off an exploit and then be shocked when they ban you from their games. Online, offline, you're a cheater and they have every right to ban you because who's to say you wouldn't do this again or worse? They have no idea who you are and don't care. That's why they left you on "read" 
---
If I was doing that kind of fuckups as developers did I would be fired within a day. And the funny thing is there was already mod for this which worked almost perfectly - now they've done their own and it doesn't work properly. Are developers kids from the school?
---
We can only hope.
---
Yep, might as well be using a spud gun... 
---
They only published Doom and Wolfenstein. Doom was made by id and wolfenstein 2 by machine games
---
Really is starting to sound like Bethesda don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore.
---
ahhh..store it..good idea
---
Who is Billy?
---
Yea I finished my shotgun build b4 nerf n now its like bake to base stats like a regular shotgun
---
same, funny thing the serum vendor in science wing works only the last one - all three from the left are busy.
---
Irrelevant to someone duping, what's your point? 
---
Well, if the offline content uses any online service of said company, I don't know, why they wouldn't be able to just ban you from all of said services. If all their products use said services, well you're banned from that too. 
---
Don't get me wrong. This case seems to be a mistake. A hard one to figure out with the information from log files and databases but still a mistake.
---
In general I feel like I should be able to ban someone from any of my products, if he is cheating in any way. You ain't own a service just for paying for it, you know?
---
I finally got an explosive shotgun and got to enjoy it for three days before it got severely nerfed. I thought i was finally gonna enjoy this game. Guess not. Thanks Todd Howard, you greedy micro-transaction loving glitchy game making piece of EA shit 
---
I have read that this is the first game for the BGS Austin branch. So this is apparently thier first game, do they may very well be fresh from college/University.
---
&gt; I did not have reduced Fusion Core generation. IDK what everyone else claimed about it being reduced,
---
Every time people find real bugs some other people jump on the bandwagon complaining about that bug *and some others that don't exist*.
---
For this patch it quickly became received wisdom that the problem was previous fixes getting rolled back^1 so some chancers seem to have decided to start claiming that *other* bugs have reappeared when it seems the haven't.
---
^1 which does seem to be part of the problem:
---
&gt; It appears that a merge of internal development builds failed to execute properly prior to releasing Patch 5
---
I haven't complained about anything.. just moved on and started playing wolfenstein 2 
---
Thank you!
---
I have noticed they slowed down the ability to collect water from streams (or perhaps I was lagging).   So maybe they are addressing the timing of things as they find them.
---
True. But I just removed my perk cards that affect rifles, and now my Black Powder is at 123. 
---
I got a bloodied explosive double barrel shotgun, it's out performing my TSE lever action rifle after the patch
---
Every person that posted here in the last 2 months bragging about stealing hundreds of items from dupers is as guilty as the dupers themselves in terms of Bethesda‚Äôs account checks.
---
Why? The janitors are doing the hot fixes for FO76 and they were only employed to clean the floors!
---
Because the "quality of work" speaks for itself, and the PR's shitty attempts to cover it up or justify it while accusing their playerbase just pulls them further into the pit that they dug for themselves. What do *YOU* not understand?
---
I have a feeling that was good ol daddy Bethesda who provided Bethesda Austin with the nuke ban hammer algorithm since they couldn‚Äôt handle programming your simple method into the game themselves. Bethesda Austin had only developed one other game since their creation, a game called battlecry that was never released, the only two other games they worked is Doom‚Äôs multiplayer functionality and co-developing FO76. This is literally their first ever full game that made it to launch, which may explain the crazy rookie mistakes.

Welcome to online live service games. Artificial lengthening is part of the deal with online live service games. They want you to keep playing and spending money on microtransactions so they stretch it out. I bet they already have some content ready and wont release it to stretch out the game lifespan. Hell we know they have at least 2 dlcs in progress if not almost done with the vaults and the president's room in the enclave bunker.
---
Oh dude, you must have been one ugly mf‚Äôer before jumping in because, and I hate to break it to you, all of that fev is neutralised! It‚Äôs just toxic goo! Oof.
---
Yeah this was in the patch notes. It was because of a duplication glitch utilizing them
---
Or you know you and your crew of a 100+ discord people could donate $.50 each to him... instead of trying to fix something that‚Äôs probably not gonna change 
---
I've noticed all kinds of interesting things count as human because I also run around with Butcher's Bounty so I hit "Space" on just about everything I kill. Half the time I'm expecting to see extra meat...then suddenly I drop down and eat it. Then again, as with these guys, after I cannibalize them I can *also* use butcher's bounty. Tons of food just strolling around! Gotta love the two-legged sheep.
---
It should have simply been an offline game with better graphics and storyline. Not this online shit that no one asked for 
---
I mean people tried to tell you. 
---
&gt;battlecry studios
---
Expert's in Micro Transactions and no previous AAA experience, let alone MMO. Wonder what the plan was moving forward for FO76 ...
---
Dont play destiny! It is just as much if not more of a chore than 76!
---
FO76 is my break from ESO while I wait for the next chapter. That's probably 4-5 months from release so I'm sure I'll rotate to other games before then. Eventually we'll start getting 76 DLC and I'll come back for a while.
---
When you pay 60 dollars for a product you get to be entitled. 
---
Shotguns, I love my shotguns. Break both legs, break the arm, finish them with a hammer. 
---
What witch hunting rules are these?
---
Anthem
---
Weirdest Vault-Tec experiment ever.
---
This idea is simple but is perfection. I'd love high-level enemies all over!
---
Idgi how can scrapping a gun YOU crafted teach you mods that you don‚Äôt already know? You learn mods randomly by scrapping guns with those mods, no?
---
Well maybe they do gain something. If your playtime is doubled because you have to spend just as much time on upkeep and maintenance as you do on actually playing then we‚Äôll, your playtime is doubled. The more you play the more likely you are to spend money in the atom shop.
---
I play in different ways depending on different things. I will set myself some goal and I will just grind until it's done or I made some progress with it. I want a mod for my armor, so I need materials to craft a bunch of them. That is what I will be doing for the day. Gathering rubber and ballistic fiber etc. Then I craft 20 pieces of armor, scrap them and don't get the mod. So I put that on the back burner and will do that some more later. Then I want to grind for caps. So I will farm cap stashes. But that has been nerfed now. And I want to get perfect items like for example Heavy Combat with Unyielding and Sentinel maybe and +1 strength on every piece? I don't know. Sometimes I just wander around shooting low level shorched and bloatflies. Sometimes I claim workshops if I need resources. I just do whatever. But when I do it I want to really grind it non-stop for as long as I want to and not have any artificial barrier saying "Sorry wait 24 hours to do this activity".
---
Some asshole made his camp right by the backdoor of the golfclub in the middle of a nuke. Everyone trying kill the ghouls would end up wanted because hitting that damn base. So I started fucking it up. He was like ‚Äúcould you please not‚Äù in an angry-mom tone to which I replied ‚Äúthen move your fucking camp away‚Äù (we had been complaining about his positioning on area chat for a while)
---
He refused. His base got wrecked. 
---
Since then I have a bounty of 200 caps, only getting higher every time I play, because I am trying to get someone to kill me, but everyone runs away. 
---
This is my (raider) life now. 
---
Same janitors testing the hot fix perhaps
---
This whiney comment sums up perfectly what's wrong with this subreddit. The essay for being banned due to duping and cheating is more than reasonable.
---
Getting owned for making a sarcastic and snipey comment by someone pointing out the obvious is golden. 
---
I'll upvote your comment to keep it showcased in the number 1 spot
---
How do you people think this will still work? 
---
Nice camp, when can you have me baptize?
---
I hope they aren't counting glowing meat steak,  throwing knives and boiled water. 
---
Let's be fair though, many of BGS' employees have had prior experience developing another successful online game: Star Wars Galaxies.  The lessons learned from that journey should have served them well on this one.
---
I don't know what they do. I suspect they spend 99% of their time around Whitesprings. I am all over the map with no plan no direction most of the time. Sometimes I do workshops for the events, sometimes I just go from event to event to event. I rarely go to a nuke zone. 
---
Ok, but you‚Äôre selling to 30-something niche markets at once. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you make them all ultralight.
---
Everyone you dislike is somehow connected to duping, is that it?
---
yeah i know the one you're talking about. all it is is adding a value criteria to each mod, they can literally use the same mod. they both have the same engine and fo76 is essentially just fo4  heavily modified for multiplayer so i beleive it is possible.
---
Just stop playing the game 
---
1) PS4
---
2) ApeMan911 PSN
---
4) Grognak's axe will not repair above 100% with applicable perk cards and it auto unequips when you log in and out like grenades used to do prior to patching
---
5) N/A
---
Think you and me are playing the same game mate I‚Äôm loving  it so far just working on my second character now and haveing even more fun
---
Iv even managed to make some nice friends ingame so far ( I prefer to group than solo ) 
---
It's pathetic that modders can do better job that developer of this game...
---
no, you can craft the level 1 unmodded version of something and learn mods. pretty much the only reason people want weapon and armor plans, even though they have legendary versions of them
---
Hi, I'm some reddit middleman for bethsoft. I'll be certain to give you lip service while this problem persists. I guarantee they wont fix anything. I do enjoy feeling important on the internet while not being paid for it
---
Even with the new weight limits you can carry about 2000 lbs per character [Not in Stash].  
---
You don't even need to have a second person there to transfer items either. You can just rejoin the server if you join on a random and your bag will till be in that area for a little while.
---
Mediocre?  Hardly.   Weapons that give +89% dmg (post nerf) for a total of 189% damage is far surpasing every other weapon in the game by a long shot.  They are \*still\* overpowered.
---
Been doing this since day one. Dropping stuff at the corpse down Vault76, overseer camp, in the tills(spell?) in front of vendors, etc. 
---
Adhesive is the only use my character has for stuff like that. He's a cannibal *and* a Carnivore. 
---
I took a break and walked myself right.. into the polar vortex. So not only is Bethesda bringing on the crappy patches, but mother nature is also busy patching the weather. Swell.
---
You do have to understand, you just saw someone get punched in the face and then when someone walked up and said "hey man, that was a dick move" you jumped in to say "well aren't we all really at fault here?"
---
Playing the middle ground when one side is clearly in the wrong will upset people. No one likes a person who fence sits for the sake of fence sitting.
---
War...War never changes.
---
Tonight Vendors have full inventories, none of my stuff shows to sell. I had to hop servers a few times to be able to sell or drop stuff in a container. I feel like it some kind of server issue. 
---
yep the middle one always works for me, the first one is always busy
---
Well, historically this had been true before. Modders have always fixed Bethesda games IMO. 
---
Which is why I don‚Äôt like where games have gone. There was a time where the game was finished when I came out and there wasn‚Äôt anything they could do to change it. Not they can completely make a new game with enough updates.
---
Lol. Told you so. 
---
Mules are such a standard concept in online multiplayer videogames, only the incompetents at Bethesda ban mules. I question whether your ban is even legal as you did not break EULA.
---
Bought TSE and you figure they are  legit?  Are you kidding?  I have seen well over 600 drops easily and not a single one was TSE.  Not one.   Thats less than 0.0016% chance of dropping TSE for me with a 15 luck character.
---
You honestly thing you can buy mulitple TSE and not a single one of those are duped?   I'm willing to bet 99.9984% chance they are duped, every single one.
---
Base damage is way too low just like the minigun
---
but that would also reduce the grind, then people will say they have nothing to do and become griefers...
---
Like at least more than one.
---
quit the game, and wait for most hopefully half a year (or at worst, a year). Currently there is not much else to do.
---
If you like PvP however, you could try them. I heard the devs are releasing a PvP-oriented server.
---
&gt; In general I feel like I should be able to ban someone from any of my products, if he is cheating in any way. You ain't own a service just for paying for it, you know?
---
And the law disagrees, especially in the EU.
---
The quality of work was cause by using their least qualified team. The shitty PR was because non of their PR team is competent. What I‚Äôm saying is that since 76 is no where close to Bethesda‚Äôs full potential for a game you shouldn‚Äôt judge all of their future games off of it. Tes6 for example is not being worked on by just one studio, and my guess is that Bethesda Austin will have nothing to do with it. Therefore it has way more potential than 76 could have ever had. So saying that you‚Äôll never buy a game from them again because they released a bad game made by their least qualified devs would be ‚Äújumping the gun there feller‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs the equivalent of getting banned on CS:GO and losing your entire steam account. 
---
**really**? $60? 
---
Mt local lawn mowing company charges $60 for a quick 20 minute back yard job. That much money. It‚Äôs you 3 hours of unskilled labor. 
---
And you feel entitles to something it took an army of professionals several years to make? 
---
Your 60 bucks is just 60 bucks. Not a license to coat us all with unbridled hate, and neither is it proof what you got is less than you paid for. 
---
Unhappy?  Ever pay Bethesda money again so long as they make buggy software. 
---
It‚Äôa worked wonders so far. 
---
Why do I wish this actually was a thing? We had vampires and werewolves in skyrim so why not super mutants and ghouls.
---
Mechanics could be become a super mutant and get bonuses in strength and endurance but can't take anything from agility or intelligence perks. Also can't wear power armor
---
Ghouls gain health in radiation, strength bonus with amount of radiation but amount of health decreases 
---
Inb4 Yong Yea &amp; TheQuartering make videos on the subjects.
---
I think banning in general needs to be viewed across gaming as a whole with a very critical eye.   
---
The fact I can spend 60 dollars on a product and be told as soon as I start using that product that they've decided I can't use it anymore is extremely ridiculous.   
---
We all justify it to ourselves by saying "well hackers ruin the game" but we never really consider the massive fallout that comes from giving them so much power over something we supposedly own.
---
Worst idea I've seen today.
---
Banning customers for crafting legitimately and yet eBay is still rife with duped items and caps.
---
/slowclap Bethesda
---
Guess if they can't get rid of the dupers its easier to ban everyone else, at least the servers wont be as stressed out as much :/
---
Which vendor and what armor did you find the plan for? 
---
I was able to sell, first thing I did was sell off my extra grenades/mines and junk for that 200, then tabbed over and bought all the plans it made out that I didn't know. Unless they fix this in that hotfix that's coming "next week", I'm probably just done with this game. At least for a while...
---
I broke 500 hours on my main character, and have 2 more characters hovering around level 100 that i just pvp with, so i have no idea how many hours i have in this game but its a lot. not trying to argue about who has more time, just saying just because it doesnt happen in 600 hours doesnt mean that it doesnt happen.
---
have not duped since someone asked me to do the artillery one long ago and i didnt know what i was doing when they told me to stay in the inventory screen and grab it when they say to. i have picked up bags from raiding dupers but that hasnt happened in about a month, so its unlikely to suspend my account now. familiar with the modus method but i havent done it. 
---
dont have a way to prove my story since i cant log in to show my inventory but i dont have 2 of the same items and the only character i have that might be overencumbered on login isnt at the 1500 limit
---
Yea the quad shotgun is acually 32 I got that wrong in the post
---
It does? Please sources. That'd be the same as if a business is not allowed to raise a house ban on someone misbehaving.
---
You are quite right, I can't know for sure what the database structure is, however given Bethesda's public statements about the usage of the creation engine, and their propensity to recycle code where ever possible. When you factor all of that in, along with the general sever behavior under transactional loads like crafting and trading  Along with a history dealing with similar equipment and software, it's not hard to get a general idea of what they've done.
---
I never said it was the exact same as Fallout 4, however they did copy the fallout 4 game files over, hell Dogmeat is even in Fallout76's game files. 
---
My point is, if they didn't absolutely need to make a change to slap this puppy together, they didn't.  This is why I -strongly- believe that the server side portion of the game, is indeed handling the database transactions for inventory, world state, and character stats, instead of forking the load off to an independent database server that is designed to handle such loads. 
---
If you believe otherwise, please explain why crafting or trading heavy numbers of items cause the game server its self to crash.
---
And look at what happened with Fallout 4. The butchering of the writing in Skyrim. The Creation Club bullshit. This is the start of something bad. And their crap PR is doing them no favors. This is a no from me.
---
The budget for an atom store developer is not equal to a game developer to fix this buggy mess. They can keep the store running fairly cheaply and easily. Stopping work on the store won‚Äôt really do anything to speed up the fixing of the game. But yeah it still is insulting to see constant atom shop updates while everything else is being run into the ground.
---
So we have to suck up to the big B to get the updoots?
---
I see...
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone has experience modifying a 17 year old single player game engine to run online, not even Bethesda. They just placed that all on the Austin studio to figure out and fix.
---
Often happens to me. Then suddenly 3 nonlegendary enemies in a row, drop legendary gear. 
---
Only advise I can give: loot everything and be patient for loot to load. 
---
Not that this is the point but I still can't believe after like three patches of being introduced the Vault-Tec Workbench **STILL** keeps repositioning itself.
---
Which one is the Quality Assurance Testers? They need to hire alot of those.
---
Haven't logged on since December because of the first half of that.
---
Telling the truth is not a struggle man.. if you thin it is, that's your problem, not mine.
---
Scrapping a weapon, no matter if you made it or it was spawned loot, will grant you a chance to earn a mod that isn't already [Known]. The system isn't designed to give you the mod(s) that are on the weapon you are scrapping. It could happen, but the chance is as great as earning any other mod. 
---
Good ban imo just based on how you describe your actions which i also guess are described favorable by you. Picking up and keeping stuff you know to be duped. Case closed.
---
Bye bye
---
The problem I had was nothing showing in my sell windows. I couldn't even drop stuff in containers. The vendors crap showed up for me to buy. Hopped servers a few times fixed that. But I don't use any mods. 
---
I don't have a melee build. And I also don't have a tse
---
Maybe build over a cliff, if attacked and you don‚Äôt feel like mixing it up with them just quit, your base disappears, they fall to their death if not in Power Armour.
---
If that‚Äôs not your bag, just relog... easy really...
---
Bottom line it‚Äôs in the rules/systems of the game.  Example: I hate pvp (only greed for microtransactions made them make a PVP Fallout), a guy stole a workshop I had taken, I went back to it and I shot at him as a warning to just leave it, he didn‚Äôt so killed him, felt bad about it but what are you going to do..?
---
Think ultimately the game is done, wasn‚Äôt too bad as I got it at a discount, cost as much as a trip to the cinema and some snacks, so really value for money/time spent it‚Äôs been ok... nothing lasts forever.
---
Valid defence in the US isn't it?
---
If I was in your situation, I would create another bethesda account and explain to them what has happened to your blocked account, taking into account that you are:
---
"appalled of their actions relating to the problem and their lack of communication, which has clearly been an issue since the start of the game"
---
 (does a nylon bag ring any bells?)
---
Pharma Farma, was the first point i put in my build :)
---
Where does one get excavator armour?
---
Jesus Christ some sanity. Exactly my point. It‚Äôs not like developing for the atom store and fixing the game are equal in budget or time or resources 
---
Great points, just gonna point out number 7 here is all i've wanted and needed since the game basically came out. 
---
Haven't played since December because I literally can't move and won't until this is significantly raised. 
---
You would help those that would betray you next patch (again...)? Your dedication to something you love is commendable but you should realize that the Fallout 76 team is a skeleton crew by now. Anything you suggest is going to be put waaay down the queue, if it is read in the first place, and by then the question is whether the game still exists or that Zenimax just pulls the plug.
---
Loving the fallout 76 update  Meanwhile-TSE/Exploiters/online 3rd party fallout 76 players are pissed.   Its a good thing i'm sticking with my melee build/sneak build lol.Ôªø 
---
As far as the bobby pins and other nerfed items I don't use it really hasn't affect me but I guess someone has complain about something.
---
Your argument is that we should just shut up and expect the product to be bad?   
---
Nice. Meanwhile, I bought a bunch of other games for 60 dollars this past year that all have little to no bugs, look incredible, have an actual story and that are worth my time. You want to compare 60 dollars to lawn mowing for some reason, you've already lost your dumbass argument. 
---
That would work.
---
OVER 9000
---
Sounds like a cool challenge. Wish I could find level 300 enemies that actually made me fear for me life. 
---
Hmm or allowing those with TSE to take the fun from others by 1-shotting legendaries during events?
---
it balances out the grind. instead of trying for a 1 in 1,000,000 roll, you can instead use the weapons and armor you dont want as progress towards ones you do. it's literally just converting to a specific material and using that to make what you want. you can get dozens or hundreds of Legendaries a day if you tried, all it does is make the grind way less frustrating and more beneficial. Opens a market for those who can craft rare weapons instead of just crafting the weapons for the sake of dismantling for mods.
---
Modders can save the game. But Bethesda won't listen.
---
I don‚Äôt even PVP so don‚Äôt lump me into that. Simple fix for everything should have been made PVP servers with balance and left Adventure mode alone..
---
Of course it works perfectly, it‚Äôs a picture of a fucking hat. Not quite the same as balancing weapon damage or fixing mutation glitches
---
Damn, I did just that for some leather armor to scrap everything again before the patch. So I can't do that anymore since it results in a ban? WTF... Then make the learning rate higher ...
---
I do this ever few days with amo or plans I have no use for. I'm on ps4. Normally let someone nearby know 
---
The point is armor accounts for a tiny fraction of my mule‚Äôs 4000 weight load. 
---
I have an alt account I use for muling and trading between my characters as I hate bugging friends to help me move things around. Whats tragic is I stopped putting all the scrap etc on one character as I did wonder if they were going to get difficult over that. That said I struggle to believe you need to craft mass amounts of weapons as the mods are so easy to learn (I have every weapon mod in game on a couple of characters now so I talk from experience). Armour yes I can believe as the chances are so much lower. Actually tbh I struggle to see how you'd get enough screws etc to mass craft enough weapons in one run to be mistaken for a duper as they do what 300 a time. Scrapper is useless and returns none of those so a lot of weapons you'd end up using something like 3k a batch.
---
Do you have proof 
---
Right, but Austin's employees have experience developing and running MMORPGs.  So they should be up to the task.  I wasn't really speaking to the task of modifying the engine but rather things that have come up leading up to and since the launch.  
---
I was referring to the part where paying for a service doesn't mean you own it. The EU has widely rendered those sections in TOSes and EULAs null and void. You can still ban someone from an online game for violations of the community guidelines and so on, but if there is an offline component (or in this case, a component that is not part of that game) then banning them from that, too is going to require some *serious* justification.
---
For some reason your more inclined to believe Bethesda? 
---
The same company that has launched most of there titles with the same basic bugs in over the last 10 years and apparently are fixing "soon"?
---
When does the game leave beta?
---
I'd be fine with complete wipe of every single item on the entire server. &lt;shrug&gt;  
---
Not many share that sentiment, but it would fix a totally broken player economy.  
---
Junk is easy enough to get for me to craft my player handmade and my armors anyway.
---
Are You on a data limit with hotel WiFi?
---
Disconnect WiFi &amp; reconnect
---
Not much more I can suggest.
---
It's usually the nearest vendor terminal that says busy for me. If I keep trying other vendors in the row I always find one that works.
---
You think they‚Äôre paying some guy the same amount of money to run the atom shop as they are paying one of their game developers?
---
Yeah, I certainly feel you on that one. Just wouldn't hold my breath is all.
---
You're set on your opinion, but I still will provide my own feedback:
---
I know my TSE 50 cal was unreal with DPS. What I did was sprayed the initial lot with the weapon, stood back, let the group do their thing, we all got our hits, everyone was happy.
---
But yeah I got it. I cant speak for everyone
---
I've got 1x shocks and 2x jetpack mods on PC, but I'm CET timezone, so if you play now it be diificult to cathc up.
---
I can sell you a jet pack mod for 3.5k
---
Too late, I deleted the game soon as patch 5 was released. 
---
Honestly please just give up on this failure of a game and move on to what you guys do...better, single player RPGs. And please for the love of Talos, USE A NEWER ENGINE.
---
i dont have any other games on the same bethesda account other than the classic fallouts you got for buying this one. not a big deal
---
maybe you shouldn't have been such suckers and they would have cared more about appeasing you 
---
PS4 fix tse way to weak now. You have to shoot so many bullets guns brake within 30 minutes if that. Gunsmith perk barely even helps. Blast radius is way to small now too. Items are disappearing off bodies you kill as well as bodies. Bulk items aren‚Äôt working for crafting. Also that d/c or blue screen is the worst because you can‚Äôt rejoin the same server which is frustrating when you just dropped a nuke somewhere. Dedicated servers someday? Going melee is the only option now if you don‚Äôt want to farm junk everything hour because you‚Äôre out of stuff to fix you gun so much now.
---
Completist.... :-)
---
Yeah i got disappointed from fallout 4, not great for role play. Skyrim is debatable but that‚Äôs one of the elder scrolls I‚Äôve played the least of so I wouldn‚Äôt know. PR isn‚Äôt doing them any favors but once again does not affect the product. Because if 76 reviewed they‚Äôll realize that they took a wrong turn and will go back to making games on par with morriwind or fallout 2, at least I hope so. Anyways good debate, I‚Äôm going to bed, have yourself a goodnight 
---
You aren't making a damn bit of sense, you sound like a homeless man who's having a fever dream.
---
No. 
---
My argument is that you should provide feedback, but be civil, and use the empathy organ in your body. 
---
You **are** here and not on another game‚Äôs forum/subreddit. 
---
That means there‚Äôs stuff about the game you like and enjoy, otherwise you‚Äôd be elsewhere. 
---
Instead of throwing toxic sludge at the people who made this stuff you like, be kind and civil. 
---
What I mean is why does there have to be always be an answer to "now what", why can't a game be finished or completed. All other mediums of entertainment are this way, why is it with games even when we get 400 hours out of it, we expect and infinite playability?
---
Not quite a game but the Skyrim together mod is in closed beta and going to be released shortly 
---
Yup, a ‚Äòculture of mediocrity‚Äô. You used to see it a lot in massive state owned companies in the EU and UK in particular. With them it was years of monopoly and unaccountability. I‚Äôm not sure what Bethesda‚Äôs excuse is.
---
Sadly, while the mod community around FO has always been fantastic, it's now just enabling a shit company to keep cranking out shit product.  It's sad, I know.  I've been into the post apocalyptic adventure since Wasteland, but I think it's time to cut bait on Beth.
---
Targeted harassment,  nice.  I guess non-US people are very nice.
---
Terker jerbs un eyr jukin chebin boom 
---
I have zero faith in their ability to actually own up to their mistakes and make a good game. Good night.
---
Agreed, upvoted.
---
What was this Tarp leather jacket?
---
As I said, in response to someone else, something discouraging something else doesn't prevent the something else from happening, it just discourages it.
---
But mamma always said I was handsome.
---
Go ask in your local game store if they got any copies....you'll have 3 complimentary copies in your hand before you can promise not to tell anyone they stock this shit.
---
What the hell is "leave me on read" it makes no sense.
---
8 or 10 SRM6 racks may disagree :p
---
Sorry I‚Äôm not trying to come across as a dick but we‚Äôve all seen how much bethesda listens. I don‚Äôt see them lifting the ban anytime soon (even if this gets their attention), and warranted or not it really should be a 76 ban not his whole acct. If he‚Äôs a big part of your crew it might be worth doing this in the meantime since Bethesda is fucking up left and right all over the place. This is probably on the back burner for them and it seems like you guys actually enjoy the game. 
---
But the math is correct, only 20% of your shotgun is explosive damage. 97/1.2=80 so your explosive damage should be roughly 17. Now you have 60% extra explosive damage 17*1.6=10 there you go with 10 extra damage 
---
I don‚Äôt disbelieve you, necessarily, I just think the more full story is:
---
‚Äú I have picked up bags from raiding dupers but that hasnt happened in about a month, so its unlikely to suspend my account now.‚Äù
---
I think a reason you‚Äôd be banned for this, is that ‚Äúraiders‚Äù were killing ‚Äúdupers I totally don‚Äôt know‚Äù and amassing an incredible inventory of duped items they pretended to obtain from PvP but in reality was simply a means of laundering items in a more defensible way.  
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean you did it.  Just means that‚Äôs what others have done.
---
"They have been working tirelessly to bring patches to the game regularly with a lot of fixes in each patch"   
---
Well since the patches continually break as much as they fix, what exactly do the devs get applauded for. You're saying that essentially all the game Devs did was say "Hey can we try to fix this?" and then the other two teams failed to fix those things. So what do the devs get applauded for exactly? Delegation?   
---
I mean at some point you're going to have to acknowledge that they all work together, and all share the blame. 
---
But you haven't even played the game? And if you did how could you not have enjoyed it if you played it? Checkmate libtard!
---
Did he really wow. 
---
He's certainly jumping band-wagon here for views lol. 
---
IMO the update hasn't effected me personal 1 I don't use ANY TSE weapons
---
so I'm going to assume that 80% of the community is in a rant chaos against Bethesda for it
---
specially- TSE/Exploiters/3rd party online sales players.
---
Have a melee/sneak build
---
And I know I'm probaby going to hear about well melee is going to be the next thing patched you'll but tell me this 
---
I pray for future content these will be the case.
---
Be I g a mutant searching for green stuff or smarty, even just following grahms as an additional merchant.
---
No, it wouldn't. She purchased these games and didn't violate their terms of service. Bethesda can revoke her access to an individual title for violating the TOD, but there's no legal justification for them to take away her access to other games for revenge.
---
This is even more clear if you think of her purchase of the other games not as ownership of property, but as fulfillment of a contract. Violating the Fallout 76 TOS might void her contract for access to Fallout 76, but it wouldn't void the contracts for access to the other games.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be so pissed if I hadn‚Äôt paid $118 nzd for each copy of the game for me and my boyfriend. A full price newly released game should not be like this. Last time I preorder a Bethesda game 
---
It means releasing the game and gathering feedback from it's loyal user base. Then we iterate on that.
---
QA? Oh you mean our users? What do you mean they're different? I don't get it.
---
I see your point. 
---
Still I was talking about banning the online service, not the connected offline products. Feels grey for me.
---
You've got any ECJ precedent cases at hand?
---
In what world is that any form of harassment?
---
pass
---
I have also gave up. Got Tricentennial at launch and loved the game for about a week. Barely stopped playing. 
---
Now though, it's boring. There's nothing to do. The world is dead. I see 2-3 others players in my server most of the time, to put that into perspective for you... I logged into CoD MW2 yesterday and there was over 90,000 online players. 
---
Sorry Bethesda, you tried but failed on this one. Nobody has a positive thing to say about FO76 now. Ever the hardcore long serving fans are jumping ship. 
---
Just uninstalled FO76, rather sad but meh. Think I'll go play GTA or something where there's things to do. 
---
There is no amount of atom shop currency that would be a proper reward for playing this game for SEVEN THOUSAND HOURS.  They could give you 200,000 caps and it would still not be an adequate reward. 
---
 &gt;but it's obvious they want to make it better.
---
I'm gonna sound like an entitled brat but whatever.
---
See the game is almost 3months old now, the time is not about *wanting* things to go better anymore but to actually make them happen.
---
I know it's hard and i'm not shitting on the devs for having all this pressure put on them, they are only obeying orders. In that aspect they have my support because they probably know better than us that what they are told to do doesn't make sense (like rolling back builds to fix stuff really ? ) 
---
But anyway the point is, with this patch the support the few of us (by that i mean us 76 players) still had in the company is at an all time low. Wanting to prove you can fix things won't cut it, *do it*.
---
* Don't fix what isn't broken. (white knight, two shot and demo expert)
---
* Don't rush updates but keep us in the know about your decisions. Receiving for feedback about a potential change is better than having to spend *more* time and effort reverting back later on anyway. If you half ass Something because you are Under a tight time constraint and end up screwing up other things, this will do more harm than good on both sides.
---
* Don't be afraid to put the game down for 24h or more to focus on patching difficult stuff that can't be done on a whim (like server stability. Just let us know few days in advance at least.
---
* Add a Test server. If you can't afford to do it for all platforms, do it for PC at least like some other games do.
---
*If Something receives major justified backlash, please have your Community manager spend some time with us discussing it so we together can find how to fix things.
---
 I know t sounds cliche but we're half of what will keep this game alive, we have to be in good terms about what and how things could be changed. I know 80% of the requests are as good as trash but some well argumented thread about an issue some times doesn't even get aknowledged. 
---
They might be read by the devs but without us receiving an official response we have no other way to know if it has been or not.
---
Like for example why isn't any of the CMs making a pinned thread discussing the 2 major elements of this backlash (demo expert, white knight) in order to gather focalized feedback on the issue and maybe find a middle ground if not a full revert?  
---
I know this will sound bad but I, a player, shouldn't have to tell how they need to do their jobs.
---
yes pve in the game is very easy with just power armor and a 2h weapon, it is known
---
some of us have fun with pvp where you need minmax builds to get around assassin/sentinel sets
---
Dont forget about everyones favorite weapons like the fatman, missile launcher, and grenade launcher! These weapons are total ass now, i can do more damage with a hammer then a nuke please tell me how that makes any sense :P
---
They forgo the realism of the same bullet doing the same amount of physical damage over game balance. It should be buffed, dont get me wrong, and I feel they should add more mods to the LMG as well. Maybe add the Bipod that could be used as a canted foergrip like the anime Gin-Roh. Or find a way to retro fit a MG15 saddle drum to extend ammo.  
---
These situations are not even slightly comparable.
---
Dude I totally agree. I have had to step away from the game for the past few weeks because of how addictive it was 
---
Sadly no. Not an EU resident so I've only found out about most of this second hand.
---
Its not the same they, it‚Äôs two different teams working simultaneously 
---
Any chance that favourite wheel selection bug, which removes changes after restart, is fixed as well?
---
I am in MST timezone, an 8 hour difference to CET. What times work for you?
---
They also read what tips we give for levelling up, get legendaries etc and then with the next patch that thing gets XP nerfed, so don't pat them on the back too much :-)
---
&gt; The game has basically become what we know West Virginia to be, a place with a few cool things that is slowly petering out
---
Well now we know we wouldn‚Äôt want a Fallout 5 that is too true / realistic to the location then
---
Your crib is sweet; I would love to live in the mire but I'm not hard enough to handle the neighbours yet.
---
You actually got a bobby pin?!  
---
Crap, all I got was the 3 star rolling pin.  Some people just have all the luck!   At least your drop can be used for something.
---
Who ? Lol
---
I only have 1 character. 
---
I think the idea is good.
---
haha might be able to get some flowers and a door with that hey!
---
Does morning rain drop on your windows?
---
Idk responded to some trump lover
---
I‚Äôll see about posting it.
---
Wabbajack was crazy...
---
Same for me today. Didn‚Äôt notice it yesterday, but happened multiple times today.
---
I'll be back home around 6:30PM CET (in around 9 hours)
---
Were you mad because I was fuming hahahaha
---
Remember when they blamed every critic of the game, saying they never gave the game a chance and when a reviewer went through the pain of playing it for 60 hours, a post got top page saying he must of enjoyed it if he could play for 60 hours. I gave up trying to argue with the majority of the fanboys ages ago and stooped down to their level.
---
Camping mobs for rare spawns is an old tradition in on-line gaming. Indeed, I'm so old, I can remember camping Lower Guk for my Flowing Black Silk Sash in EverQuest ‚Äî before some of you reading this were born!
---
I agree with the OP that a certain element of romantic chance was stripped by making all the plans &amp; recipes suddenly appear and become permanently available through vendors.
---
But the pre-patch server-hopping is the exact opposite of "immersive." Rather, it's a colossal waste of time, an utterly tedious task entirely unrelieved by the amusement of loading screens (even though I *very much like* being able to review my collected snapshots during that process in this game).
---
IMHO, dumping all the plans &amp; recipes onto the vendors, or even distributing them in genuinely random encounters, is a sorry excuse for skipping the content which should be associated with the player winning these loots. They should almost all be quest rewards. 
---
Clearly you don‚Äôt know how MMO‚Äôs start out 
---
Maybe at least your character shouldn‚Äôt stare at the wheel for a full 2-3 seconds before getting in
---
Except nobody is saying it's the best game ever. It obviously isn't. But you're mentally disabled if you think your opinion is fact.
---
Creed was boring after the 2nd lol
---
I'm waiting for Far Cry before I give up. Crashed twice since I posted this. I hope Far Cry is out tomorrow.
---
I Hate this game now üëéüò•
---
You may need a Hoarders' Anonymous intervention, RiverGrub.
---
Doh I feel your pain, I distinctly remember when I was a lvl 30 character getting trapped by a lvl 60+ rad scorpion. I had to freaking hide in a raider lookout while it skulked underground and occasionally popped out for me to take pot shots at.   I ran out of ammo, and had to be rescued by a random stranger who was over lvl 100.
---
It was probably out performing it before the patch, too....
---
found one east of Sugar Grove, in or around The Mire. The swampy area.
---
It seems a lot of other users are in agreement with me. And if u think that writing an essay to get your money's worth(and no even then) is reasonable, you truly are hilarious. And the only golden thing around here is me getting all the upvotes while you are getting downvoted. Especially, I guess, because most people around here know a joke when they see one, unlike you, mr.golden.
---
i picked them up and dropped them in the river, like i said, none of my characters are over 1500 lbs which is nothing compared to the junk duping monstrosities i have raided. i highly doubt that would be a cause in my case since it happened long before they started banning and before they put in autoflag
---
i can see how people can just pretend they took items of dupers, thats why i didnt keep them. in fact, until they actually announced a 1500 limit, i didnt let either of my mule characters stay overburdened at all, in case they would started targeting mules, i would have no way in knowing what a safe number is before it was announced....
---
That‚Äôs how movies are made :)
---
that works for me 
---
Xbox one X
---
The Pro 1337
---
N/A because it's hard to get screen shots across from X1, but it would just display me standing at spawn looking at the world. (No pip boy)
---
Spawn issues: 
---
If I pull out my pip boy the game will crash. Occasionally I will be able to use my character between loading screens on initial world spawn. When the pip boy glitch occurs, sometimes a death will fit it, sometimes not. On world load, opening the map and fast travelling can also cause a control lock. Then spawning will sometimes cause you to be murdered by invisible enemies. Team members names will not appear in the bottom left of the screen or less frequently thier shared perk cards won't. Then team members will occasionally become completely invisible and even enemy players can have this issue, although you will see bullets explode from them and other ways that they interact with the world such as blocking workbenches. Then the player on world spawn can also just crash to dashboard, especially when trying to spawn into a nuked area. You can also have issues with power armor not equipping pieces on world spawn despite leaving the game with them equipped if you equipped them from the in game menu. Then you risk losing your power amour if the server disconnects whilst you are not in it if you are tweaking parts externally.
---
Menu issues:
---
The game will sometimes not show quests and need a reloading of the game for them to be displayed. Only occurred when joining into a team when the host is on a different quest stage. 
---
Certain "search the area" style missions will not display on map when pressing the button to from the data menu.
---
Delays between purchasing atomic shops C.A.M.P. items and the game registering you can  place them. (Very frustrating when you buy it from the C.A.M.P. menu. 
---
Gameplay Issues:
---
In passive mode occasionally slap damage will still allow you to be one hit killed by enemy players. 
---
When ignoring a player the rest of the team is still visible to them, so hunting you down is far too easy.
---
Power amor can cause a player to freeze when  entering it.
---
Upon eating the game using exit game gameplay width roll back time.
---
Just what I have experienced since this week's patch on xbox.
---
I‚Äôm aiming towards the guilty, they know who they are. I‚Äôm not blaming all of them, I still have hope that this will be fixed and back to fun fallout again.
---
To be fair most Youtubers that rely on the ad revenue are. Point out someone who does Bethesda news that's more principled.
---
You might find one but there aren't many.
---
No. You don't get credit for fixing a broken product. They had to push out those patches because their game was BROKEN and the only way to save their already dwindling player base was to fix it. 
---
And you for sure don't get credit for breaking the product while fixing it. 
---
The post you responded to was simply "Then it should have released in March" 
---
That isn't toxicity, that is a fair criticism. They released the game too early, it wasn't ready, it still isn't ready. 
---
Oh your so kind to us thank you thank you a million times thank you
---
Well we don't actually know the base damage of the explosives effect as far as I know (happy to be proved wrong but the in game damage figure was rubbish) but if you drop the damage from 200% (max perk and 100% base explosive damage) to 32% (20% base with a 60% perk) it always was going to be an utter waste of 5 perk pts as you're only doing 16% of the previous damage.
---
Title from first DLC?
---
yeah seems to corroborate my experience, wish i knew about this before i had the audacity of trying to learn a deep dish mod on a gamma gun that nobody cares about because there is nothing else to do in this game
---
I would rather not have \*any\* more quests like this at all.
---
Mine completely bugged on the Mistress of Mystery: Novice quest and any tickets to customer support basically says 'No we cannot help'.
---
If they put in more quests that just clog up your journal and you can never finish them, then no. 
---
In what sense is it ignoring mods?
---
Some kid going through puberty I think.
---
I just want to thank the devs and community managers.
---
This is a joke by the way, just like the game
---
If you made a point about getting your money's worth then you'd have a point....but you tried to be sarcastic about the essays and came off looking like an idiot. It's very entertaining
---
Yeah especially because it was a fucking molerat! Haha
---
Yikes
---
S'all good, my man. Appreciate the solidarity!
---
your blind to the truth  this reddit was defending fo76 from the start. its just that bethesda is really incompetent
---
I'm far too old and have been in marketing for too long to care about "hype". I just enjoyed the hell out of part one. I've played it for 500+ hours. I hope to find some of that fun in part 2.
---
Hears hoping,I jumped on fo76 for an hour today a whole clip to kill one enemy gun broke in ten minutes garbage ,see you on the range hombre
---
I doubt it. I think the only ones working hard are the community managers. Everyone else is vacaying on a tropical island somewhere with the money we gave them. The interns were left in charge. 
---
I have played a lot of online games from launch, a lot of online games have these types of issues at launch.and for a good while after. It's not uncommon. I had no unrealistic expectations of it going beyond that. We were told the game would be buggy. It will get better. It will get patched and fixed. Other games have had the exact same issues, some worse, some not as bad. I have seen patches, break things, patches delete things, progress lost. I think its unreasonable for the most part to think a giant game with so much in the world, so many mechanics, so many Items, so much going on all the time. The server is having to track EVERY item, EVERY disease, Everything position, everything health, there is SOOOO much going on, it's just unrealistic for people to think these type of games will launch perfect and just run smoothly from day 1. It just does not happen, or it's VERY rare that things don't go sideways for a while. 
---
I enjoy the game just fine. The bugs, for the most part, are really just minor annoyances. There aren't any real game-breaking bugs here. I don't get too many disconnects. 
---
I play it exactly like I played Fallout 3, NV, and Fo4. Just sometimes with friends. 
---
What bothers me the most about this game is the Troll aspects. I just want to be left alone, adventure around, adventure around with a couple of friends. I don't want to PvP at all. This game to me is just not built for PvP. I don't want to have to deal with people breaking my shit up, I really really enjoy building and move my camp at least once or twice a week. I don't get bent out of shape about it though. I just move on. 
---
In the end, I know they will find their stride. All the complaining and threatening and blah blah are not going to make a bit of difference in the end. People just need to sit back, give them time and enjoy what that have.
---
We are living in an instant gratification world, but I am not an instant gratification person. We are in a time where its cool and in to be outraged and offended at everything. I am not. I have always been my own person and always will be. In the end, I find the game fun, My friends find the game fun, we enjoy playing it together. There is really nothing more than that that matters. We have forgotten how to be happy with what we have. 
---
On PS4, I load five times now every time I join the game. First a long loading screen with a still picture. Then a fade to black and more loading while watching a black screen, then I‚Äôm shown the game world for a few seconds, then I‚Äôm thrown back into a loading screen with another still picture, then finally I drop into the world but have to wait for my camp to spawn in and for the game to allow me to move and use my controls 
---
Come on guys, #pcmasterrace?
---
Mod the mod, it works.
---
You think it would be clear that a patch would fix bugs not multiply them.
---
Imagine level 1 mole rat slays level 200 with nerfed tse.
---
wrote it in other replies, but i think since the patch brought back old bugs, it may have brought back the crafting method of duping, so they turned on the autodetecter for mass item creation and i was collateral damage.  
---
this thread seems to corroborate this theory  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alm3ic/psa\_dont\_craft\_mass\_amounts\_of\_weapons\_to\_scrap/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alm3ic/psa_dont_craft_mass_amounts_of_weapons_to_scrap/)  
---
he apparently was also muling a bunch of shit but his account wasnt suspended until he mass crafted for mods. really sounds like an automated flagging system
---
Worth it ,I play to have fun not to get aggro
---
You can get it for 30 now I hear
---
Wood armor has the best stealth mod in the game, and is sort of like early game metal in that it's ballistic resist isn't bad, and it's extremely light weight, but it is very lacking in mod ability and availability, it needs to basically get the light leather treatment where it's always craftable and have all the same basic mods as any other armor so people can get some decent use out of it early, while making it apparent why 3 star wood armor can be extremely valuable.
---
You just described a mechanic in other MMOs that doesn't really solve anything. People would just complaining they don't have enough ballistic fiber drops from Whitesprings Ghouls to farm "nuke shards" to get a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet with faster swing speed and reduced carry weight.
---
See: ecto in Guild Wars 2, etc.
---
I re-played Theme Hospital last year when I didn't find anything new to play... man, that game was FUN.
---
Yeah good luck with that. The fix might not be worth it.
---
Ready to play outer worlds?
---
Lol 1k? I'm specd for heavy weapons and I'm getting 2k, 2800 with power attacks. Not a single melee related perk card
---
*checks draft folder* **shit.**
---
Really want those pink pajamas hey?
---
I'm glad i did not bought this piece of shit of a game :)
---
I‚Äôm certain they automatically flag and then manually review.  It‚Äôs pretty obvious they don‚Äôt have the staff to actually manually hunt people, based on the state of the game.
---
A shill is like a person hired to pretend to be a regular person, who is really in on the scam or promotion of some business or product. Like for example you know those games of chance like 3 cards, or cups and ball? A shill will pretend to be a regular person, walk up and win once or twice, to make the people standing around think they can win. Then when they try they lose. It's a deception. So not quite the correct use of that word.
---
Her RL name is "Rose."
---
These things, Ghouls, Scorched, and especially Mongrels can be seen all over the map. 
---
I am happy you are entertained by this. This was the point of the comment. I sure do hope it's enough to get you going untill the next clusterpatch.
---
I‚Äôd say to give it a year at this rate. Look how little has changed in 3 months 
---
Yeah mine was a elongated neck dog that I couldn't kill because it whips its head around at like 100mph.
---
It is absolutely legendary that this gets ignored. You‚Äôre literally handing them a fix and there is no response?
---
Similar stupid idea: Name shotguns 1/7 shots (0.14285714285 shots has a nice ring) and name the beam splitter .20 shot.
---
Yeah I know it sounds whiney but after playing since beta start the only goal I had was collecting every plan in game..... okay thanks Bethseda its not like we need goals to keep us playing when we consumed all the content after a few weeks...
---
Its a great move for casual players who will pick up the game cheap post launch and just play for 20-30 hours but its really not going to help retention having everything handed out on a platter.
---
I do not have TSE and I say good riddance to all the jerks with TSE that come into events to 1 shot everything that is \*not\* 100 levels lower.
---
Everyone knows the max level is 50 and anything over that is just more cards or moving points.  No other gains.  Level is arbitrary in this game, just gives players more options, not necessarily more power.
---
I'm very happy with the latest patch in all its glory.   It will also reduce the Griefing as well because TSE are severely reduced.  I have 3 players perma-blocked already because they attempted to Grief (with TSE).
---
Ive stopped playing a few weeks back. I may return we shall see. 
---
&gt;But you're mentally disabled if you think your opinion is fact.
---
Hey Pot, meet kettle!
---
Yeah I trust rockstar to make online great wtf was bgs thinking making an online game anyway? 
---
Yeah logically all mmo's marketed as rpg's start out months after release and hardly function with minimal content.
---
I've got my camp where a dog always spawns near Harper's ferry so he's always in my camp üòÅ
---
Of 2020 you mean. There is no way this game is going to be in a decent condition by March, they need like a solid year 
---
That‚Äôs bullshit. VAC on steam will never van your account, just that game.
---
Yeah, I don't get the whole watch other people play a game thing. Repeatedly slamming my dick in a door would be more exciting. The only thing possibly more boring would be watching golf. 
---
I love watching mental gymnastics in action. I'm sure you'll be there to make ironic comments and to get offended when you get called out for it. Keep on being the special person you are üòâ
---
Tbh, sneak wasn't working properly before the last patch, as well. What you are describing is very common.
---
Just another think that needs to get fixed.
---
I think his point is that they ban you from ALL Bethesda games with that ban, not just fo76
---
Thanks for the info. I'll try to use this to my advantage. üëç
---
PVP with TSE was not the thing, I just blocked those people. Its the freaken jerks with TSE going into events and 1 shotting all legendary mobs.
---
Are you saying it's the consumers fault for leaving a dying game that they don't enjoy as the reason why it's dying?
---
I was farming ghouls at a whitesprings nuke with a party of friends, using an automatic Tesla Rifle for tags, and the rebounding health bug is back.  I had to quit the game and rejoin, and constantly keep doing it after a mob or two until I just gave up, put on my power armor and smacked things with an axe.
---
It's unfair for bgs to release the game without a solo campaign like wtf that's their thing solo game modes they hustled us
---
I think honestly the best thing they could do for you guys is speed up and release the new content, skins, whatever EVERYTHING they've been working for post launch, release it right now and sell the game off too a 3rd party studio. 
---
Preferably a game studio with a lot of developers too, that can make larger better updates quicker. I personally think (alot) of studios would want to pick the game up.
---
Dude it's just a beta go to da fallout sub lol
---
I loved Fallout 4, played 3k hours of it on Xbox One. I've been following all the news I can about Fallout 76, and I recently purchased an Xbox One X. It came with a digital edition of Fallout 76 via 25 digit code. I never used it and tossed it in the trash where it belongs. FO76 is an indefensible abomination to the series. The Xbox One X is pretty sweet, but this game. There's no hope for it. 3 Was Great, 4 was pretty good, 76...  Just no.
---
Actually, yes, you do. 
---
They chose to ship early and continue the development long term post launch. This product will remain in development forever. 
---
Pet of that even means that bugs will be introduced too. 
---
Some products do that. 
---
You think you‚Äôre entitled to software without bugs, and have the right to behave like an asshole until there‚Äôs no bugs in the software? 
---
Wow. 
---
A marvel of modern society, you are. 
---
Um no that would make it worse and you cant really hotfix consoles like you can to pc.
---
You don't seem to understand the "games as a service" concept. One year after release, the complete sum of money made from sales of the game is significant lower than the profits from a store like the atom store. ("Yay, another PA skin for 20 bucks")
---
So no, it probably won't drive them out of business. But the company will "feel" this. Bethesda wouldn't be the first game studio to be closed by a parent company or at least get into heavy trouble with a parent company that wasn't satisfied by the numbers.
---
I'm just playing the same for like, an hour a week (My work schedule suuuuuuks).
---
I bought it at launch and I'm still under lvl 30, with only one half-finished set of PA. 
---
I figure, at least for me, by the time I get to the endgame, it'll be the game I paid for? I hope?
---
r/FalloutFilthyCasuals 
---
Are you running chrome in the background?
---
I'm fine with having 1000 bottle caps instead. 
---
Hey y'all prepare yourself for the Rubberband......Maaaan....
---
Thanks
---
This guy maths!
---
Yeah that's true but it got worse. At least i noticed because I was sneaking a lot in this game ;)
---
As an FYI, you may be able to fix this without reloading by changing the view of the pipboy (iirc 'V', but I've changed a lot of my keybinds).
---
I have had this since launch, Win some and lose some. RNGesus did not smile upon you. 
---
There is lots of content I have 200 hours in and less then 60% done. I am level 49 almost 50. I didn‚Äôt cheat MYSELF (because I know there are going to be whiners) by trying to get everything right this second or farm white springs nuke zones. 
---
Your equipment can be fried just by being plugged in to the wall socket even if the socket is switched off. 
---
Unlikely to be the Ethernet.
---
What about the nerfs to events? Monster Mash was my favorite! Your games does not have much content anyway and you NERF all the events ?
---
In the past I've brought several TS for 1k, which I considered decent offer. No one ever wanted more. I don't know if they were commonly brought by anyone, I wanted to try few. Most of the time I wasn't looking at what was being sold, because of so many listings. Plus I found if not pleasant as most people didn't want to have an asking price.
---
After nerf I can't see how they are worth much more than 500. Handmade and gauss rifle might be fair at 1k, if you find someone that wants one.
---
To be fair, they did say a fix is coming to adjust bobby pins weight. From there, all they need to do is fix the rest of this catastrophy. Im sure the game will be totally playable in two decades from now.
---
Plus there is a deathclaw that will roam out of the cave sometimes.
---
You are NOT a true fan for sticking with a broken mess of a game that was intended to be a disrespectful cashgrab from day 1 in development. Still supporting fo76 after you have experienced all the issues makes you the worst kind of "fan" - the one that actively helps companies to get away with worse and worse products. If you support fo76 that means you support the next fallout being a bad game. So please stop calling yourself a true fan if you are part of the problem. We wouldn't haven gotten this messy game in the first place if it wasn't for people like you.
---
My wife quit in the first week of release because her character had the lost pipboy bug. it was her first ever online gaming experience. We paid for her account, why would i let it rot when it wasn't our fault she quit?
---
And despite all that, if someone does buy an account just to mule, there is nothing against the rules or TOS about that. You are being petty.
---
I am too old to waste my time with something that isn't fun.   
---
It was fun for 300+ hours, thanks for that. But Bethesda keeps on making terrible decisions in every field. Makes you wonder how long management will be able to keep their heads. The state of the game is ridiculous for a AAA company. 
---
We're the team mate. 
---
Same. I might give it an another whirl in a few years, but as it stands... nah. I got better things to do. 
---
Hell, even skyrim has more new content coming out since that one can actually be modded.
---
It might but then it may make no difference. If you can stream videos from YouTube or another streaming service without major buffering pauses your connection should be ok. Then it's possibly a server co section issue. 
---
It's not my best moment:
---
"Here's the thing. I can take my character being un-playable and having to make a new character.
---
I can take that character getting bugged and starting over again.
---
What I can't take is when I watch the E3 presentation.
---
x16 times the rendering quality? Innovative quest lines? Gripping story?
---
We have literally been sold a lie. The cash shop is clearly set up to screw us in the long run.
---
I could write for days about this but I've hit my limit.
---
I kept getting sucked into a nostalgia. I miss that feeling from fallout 4 but i've been chasing it in this joke of a game like a heroin addict.
---
This is the cheapest most brutal cash grab we have seen in gaming and it is becoming a trend.
---
Amazon are paying for the postage and giving full refunds for any version ordered.
---
If you acutally want to make a point, if you actually want something to change then stop playing this shite.
---
You will get your refund eventually, most retailers are going to have to offer an option.
---
Even if you love it and still wanna chase it you know these problems are a travesty.
---
Turn it off, get your refund.
---
Hell in a month you will be able to buy a preowned copy for $5 and your account will still posses the pathetic excuse for pre-order bonuses.
---
This game needs development, and we didn't pay to be the testers.
---
I'm out of here. Much love "
---
This sums up the current state of things quite aptly.
---
You know I agree with the microtransaction thing in that I don't care about purely cosmetic items in a game.... But what the *fuck* is with the prices these companies think this shit is worth???
---
I get it, you don't have to buy it. But they are asking money that a few years ago would have brought a full expansion for simple reskins of the sort that get released by the thousands on the nexus. In bethesdas case they are asking that for items they often didn't even have to make, just ported over from F4. Its absolutely insulting. If they were a dollar or two Id have no issue and even that is terrible value.
---
Take a look at Path of Exile for how these should be done. Expensive, but each one is a custom modeled / textured item, usually with its own animations and graphical effects. Buying one gives you something special to show off and supports a developer that treats its fans well, offers an excellent free game and deserves the money. I would be embarrassed to be seen using most of the items in the bethesda store as I wouldn't want to be the type of person that spends $20 on ugly virtual pajamas.
---
You see, I even paid a full price for this game. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone for that price, but at the same time I got my money 100% worth.
---
I mean during release I had few problems too, infinite loading screens, crashes. But seriously, since the release my game has crashed like 10 times max? Maybe the PC version is different, but I haven't ever experienced so many crashes like this and I haven't heard about something like this. I'm not saying it doesn't exist because I haven't experienced it, I'm just saying that's a lot. Maybe corrupted games files or something?
---
Not really true, it is difficult though. I played through most of  ultimate vault Hunter mode as a solo gaige and she's one of the weakest characters for UVH. There are some bosses you need to team for in UVH and TVH towards the end though. But a first playthrough is easily done solo with any of the characters.
---
&gt;. We beat our heads against a brick wall of anti-fo76 and heralds of doom on YouTube, for we were going to enjoy the game!
---
This had absolutely nothing to do with being anti fallout 76 but being anti "early access bugfest release for 60.-" 
---
Didn't they FIX THAT ALREADY? 
---
Play ESO, it's actually pretty good even for solo play
---
Huh, so it wasn‚Äôt my imagination...
---
'member when video games where for fun ?
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôm over here drowning in gears that I‚Äôm having to sell to vendors. Have over 500+ gears. Idk how I got that many 
---
Yep, you convinced me.
---
I used to watch my brother play Mario Bros back in the early 90s. But that's just cause I was Luigi and never got a turn.
---
Sugar Grove,
---
 But Good Luck getting outta there with all your collected junk before the Mr. Handy bots suddenly spawn X 50+ and stay there so when you return you can't get your junk. Also crashed twice whilst I was in there losing all my junk üëé
---
This would be very problematic for consoles, so I would suggest a beta testing server. Could help us avoid this weird, horrible decision making proccess we've been enjoying from so far.
---
Nah, I am just fine and happy with the game. No unrealistic expectations from me, I have started at launch with a lot of online games, this is no different. We will enjoy the extra server space and fewer camps taking up or spots. 
---
How?
---
If you're under level 50 go find mole miners. If you're above level 50 go find deathclaws.
---
Adjustable wrenches, desk fans typewriters,cameras, buttercups to name a few.
---
Really cause Black Ops 4 has updates twice a week sometimes 
---
Bro the keypad switch is useless since day one. What the hell is the point of a keypad code if you just have to throw the switch??? What the hell were they thinking??
---
This is straight up wrong. The armor system in this game dramatically favors burst damage to an almost comical degree. 
---
The ratio of damage to armor determines final damage, and as all enemies have a ton of armor any weapon dealing less than 200 damage per shot is going to be heavily gimped in terms of damage, not 20, TWO HUNDRED is the critical mass where a weapon's damage starts taking a heavy drop against enemy armor, weapons like the minigun are straight terrible, having their damage reduced by a factor of around 7, while a super sledge in it's base form is dealing around a third of it's damage, but with perks can easily reach the point where it does the majority of the actual damage listed while the minigun almost crawls to 1/4.
---
I did the math, against 100 armor a gatling gun needs only 25 bullets to out-damage a minigun's full 500, that is how big a difference 79 damage makes against 14, a factor of 20 rounds to one for a damage difference of 7.5.
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)
---
There is a handy chart at the side that shows how shafted a low damage weapon gets, with a 25 damage weapon suffering a 70% loss of damage against a target where a 250 damage weapon only loses 30%, meaning the 25 damage weapon has to hit &gt;23 times to do the same damage, and a 10 damage weapon has to hit 80 times, dealing a theoretical 800 damage to match 250.

Repost.

I respect that and I'm not tryna shit on anyone's fun.

---
I‚Äôm still having fun playing. I think the nerfs were needed. My explosive weapons are still plenty useful but it seems to have balanced PvP more. The other perk cards were kind of doing better than expected too. The only con I see is that the useless missile launcher/fat man became more useless. They need to balance those with a buff of some kind.
---
Offended? Dude, you made my day. And I am sure we will indeed have many more conversations, my man. Will just follow the trail of illogic and downvotes. Keep up the good work, sir!
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Dupers are adding more to the game than the devs at this point!
---
I have read many comments: but after reading yours - I feel I have a twin! Cheers - and, deftly stated. C
---
Alternately, they could have taken shotguns out of either the two-shot or explosive drop list, and much of the TSE issue would have been solved.  Rifles, pistols and heavy guns were never the problem.  It was always shotguns where the effect was spread to every pellet.  (explosive ammo for a shotgun should and can only be a slug)  TSE was a way to make heavy guns, rifles and pistols perform in a way that valuable during end-game nuke sites.  I'm largely ok with the 75% nerf in explosive damage, but the two-shot nerf was something the community largely agreed was unnecessary.  The demo expert nerf was salt in a wound for a variety of builds that had nothing to do with TSE and were underperforming to begin with.
---
If you did the story quests and explored, captured some workshops and did events, you‚Äôd be lvl 50 by now. And if that‚Äôs ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù for you, better go play Tetris.

Btw, you don‚Äôt like ‚Äúgrind games‚Äù, yet you‚Äôre trying to level just by grinding higher level mobs in the same place over and over? /rolleyes 
---
Hello there,
---
I've noticed two issues that have appeared which are not mentioned as gameplay features added in the patch, all to do with VATS:
---
* Critical hits no longer generate critical meter, I've found no mention of this in the patch notes (someone correct me if I am wrong), was this an intentional change?
---
* VATS combined with Concentrated Fire now has a 'memory' of which limb was selected. For example selecting the head on an enemy and then entering VATS on another enemy will also target their head (or equivalent) rather than just resetting to the torso like previously
---
Thanks!
---
I'm betting Todd is all out of remarks when obsidian drops the outer world's boot on starfield's neck. :P
---
I feel ya,6 shots point blank with a combat shotgun does less damage than one light swing of my sledgehammer why nerf guns that are op irl? Just give us all nerf guns and pillow armor and a million hp  they wrecked an already broken game
---
Lol, you must be really bad at this game. I can still one shot pretty much anything, with my TSE. Maybe don't use level 5 weapons, and get the right perks??.
---
Hard pass
---
Dude, 16.000 is shady AF.
---
Same for me. I never had so many server problems before. This last patch broke it for me. Going back to FO4 until they fix 76 (aka never)... 
---
Gamers want to love the games we play and when they stop providing us enjoyment we must move on. Good luck on your journey! 
---
yea thats my point, its been there forever and i think if the devs played as a normal player for a day, things like this would  be fixed by now
---
yeah i did no where near 300, but i think they set the bar much lower than that.
---
and weapon mods are very tough to unlock for the exotic weapons that dont drop very often. I'm not sure what game you're playing but mods are by far the hardest things to aquire in the game.
---
What's going on? Bethesda going for a full scale witch hunt?
---
Hey op, what happened to your post? It was here literally 2 seconds ago. 
---
no sorry. This is how almost all MMOs start out. But you certainly can pick up all of your toys and take them back home. 
---
My thoughts exactly T1 exact same numbers in my head and everything lol , 2se did need a nerf but not to be nerfed  into the ground :( everyone here listen! If you find something that's actually fun in this game keep it to yourself because if Bethesda finds out about it they'll destroy it
---
Geez... and I thought I saw overreactions yesterday...
---
If they were apologetic about making the game pay to win with loot box microtransactions, outright stole copyrighted materials from other game or mercilessly made fun of their one lone fanboy for his physical disability, ok maybe.
---
All they are is incompetent. It'd be kind of adorable if it wasn't so devastatingly embarrassing and exceedingly frustrating.
---
I wrote a post that included a similar idea yesterday, based on my experience with other online games.
---
[You can read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alb3bu/the_disconnect_between_bethesda_and_their_players/)
---
Try to go for the platinum, that‚Äôs what I did. Or do challenges for atoms 
---
I have been thinking about leaving this sub, but not the game.
---
And I'm not. Few perk changes won't drive me away. When I explore the whole map (soon) and finish the quests (soon) I'll probably move to something else... 
---
I was running Firefox in the background, but I just tried with everything in the background closed and it still happens.
---
I can totally see it get worse, and sorry to hear it. Sneak is one of the only viable options to have a powerful endgame char, so I do hope it gets fixed for you buddy
---
Try GoogleDNS or OpenDns see if that helps. 
---
Seeya! ..... drama whore
---
FYI it works if you set it to your favorites wheel and use it from there
---
it was a must for me to avoid getting vats'd in pvp
---
More likely that Bethesda won't last that long.
---
Byeeeeeeee
---
They never even apologized in the tweet. So no, there was no implied apology. 
---
Just hand it over to Kinggath, he will know exactly what to do with it.
---
What guy. Everyone knows there aren't people at bgs anymore. It's the robot revolution, why do you think there are no npcs in 76. This is all a training ground for them. Wkae up sheeple!!! 
---
Reported in Beta still unfixed.
---
The worms have begun to evolve!
---
 The game has been out since november 14th. That's about 75 days.
---
to reach 16,000 pounds of junk you only have to stash 213 pounds a day.
---
that's not hard at all, especially if you don't bulk your lead, aluminum or smelt your ore. (honestly who has that much acid)
---
i've always kept around 50 of each scrap on my main, then transferred the rest to my alt because i play a 1 strength main.
---
You lot have lasted for way too long imo. One of those things where the more people provide evidence that discounts your belief the harder you believe in it ([https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html](https://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html))?
---
I am just confused why you call yourself "true fans". Nothing wrong with enjoying a game that alot of ppl disslikes but in my opinion a true fan wants the game they love to be the best it can and will not allow the develepors to get away with the shit this subreddit let bethside get away with for so long.
---
Content you don't like is not lack of content. If it were, I'd be claiming how Witcher 3 is content-empty... In fact there's a lot of content in Fo76, it's not just much varied
---
Yeah same, I made 10 bulk and droped about 100
---
Oh yeah been doing this a LONG time now. The suitcase there or even a nearby cash register. Sometimes I go to the first cigarette machine in the starter town and fill it up with plans. 
---
endgame is GARBAGE so probably not.
---
Tbf I once received a prime receiver combat rifle plan from a standard SB
---
And ToS themself have proven to be total bullshit and unable to hold up in court the times they've been brought in front of a judge. You buy a game and after you've paid for it, opened it up, installed it and started the game up you then get a ToS to sign. And if you say no, then what? You sure as fuck aren't able to get a refund on that game.
---
He's an exception to the rule, most people didn't get a single hour of entertainment out of it, literally my entire group of friends (or those among them who bought it) refunded it because it was trash. And I very much doubt most people who bought the game got more than a few hours into it before dropping it.
---
This is a different type of break. This is put it down and maybe delete it, check back in whenever there is new content releasedand maybe not even bother. Its the not coming back part if things arent better part that is different.
---
Bro they dont roll out weekly updates. Read.

---
This is really bad. I‚Äôm worried
---
I wish the jukeboxes in our CAMPs played the same variety as the classical radio station.
---
I have noticed one peculiar thing, though: some of the pieces that play use different instruments than they were written for! Brahms' waltz in A major and Chopin's prelude in E minor are both piano pieces, but they're represented in this game by orchestral arrangements. Why?
---
I feel like an idiot for not making the "duper" connection in the name of that perk card.
---
i just threw away well over 300 because i dont even bother going to the vendors to get rid of them
---
one thing im not sure if its mentioned here or will be fixed in the hotfix is the health regen issue of normal enemies.
---
it was fixed before but came back with patch 5.
---
when i shoot enemies a part of their healthbar regens back.
---
Takes me almost a full clip of a handmade rifle bullets just to shoot a super mutant 68 down. 
---
You are bound to attract some fanboys to attack you, don't mind them. They are what they are. Hope you find another RPG to play soon. Watch out for The Outer Worlds when it's out later this year.
---
Nah, that might actually make the players happy.
---
I don't thing anyone at bethesda knows how armor works in their game sometimes.
---
Weapon A and B are almost balanced against one another in a vacuum, but as soon as you add 10 points aof armor to the target A turns into a steaming pile of garbage.
---
Not for me. Just get this shit fixed quickly and properly and never allow it to happen again is all I ask for. 
---
Beth has no reason to respond to this random post with no proof of anything.
---
Been playing for 300 hours and have yet to get the mod for assaultron blade after dismantling over 200. I would say you do need to sometimes. Its still a chance and its not going to happen the way it happend for you, for everyone. 
---
Erm I think you need to read up on digital licencing works for these games as a service releases. Basically you no longer own the game you just own a lisence to play the game and this agreement can be pulled by the company at any time with no route of recopence. So in half a years time when Bethesda shuts down the servers and you can no longer access the title it's this definition that will keep you from receiving a refund.
---
Unless you mean this in some sort of weird none literal community sense, in which case... I guess if you feel that way, but on a factual "we all own this game" it's a negative.
---
WHAT WITCHERY IS THIS?!?
---
1) hit watoga highschool dining area for 150-200 plastic 
---
2) kill stuff in your favourite spot, keep the weapons
---
3) scrap all loot down to wood and steel. 
---
4) use the plastic to make bulk of everything. 
---
5) stash 3-5 stacks of bulk you might need for yourself, vendor the rest
---
Boom
---
If this alone is not enough, sell meds, drugs, water
---
You can sell max 1400 caps per day (a bit more if you bought something and the vendor has cash again)
---
There are a few perks that help a lot, like chemist and super duper (doesn‚Äôt work on bulking) to make more out of your junk n food. 
---
How are you getting 33 luck?
---
Holy crap that should have been an automatic thing to do.
---
And the animation to start working with a workbench too.
---
They spent money on it. They have every right to be dissapointed. Its not pathetic. 
---
If you wanna talk about pathetic your reaction is pretty sad.
---
Wipe the mule inventory and set a maximum for it or delete the mule character, and warn the player (2 strikes and you are out system), that is appropriate.
---
Bethesda needs to have the tools to manage such things and also needs to react in an appropriate way to different forms of abuse. Offering a online Multiplayer for millions of players, charging money for it also comes with responsibilities. 
---
I don't have a problem with repairing. They should keep it but maybe try a lot less evil villain watchjng your players cry in frustration kinda repair process. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand why they would nerf explosive and two shot, when all of the legendary effects are pretty  much useless excluding a couple on specific weapons, they should‚Äôve just buffed the other legendary effects to make them actually viable.
---
This is insane. If you‚Äôve played more than 300 hours like me, you‚Äôll have gotten some cool 3 star weapons that weigh upwards of 20 lbs, I physically can‚Äôt afford to have those hanging on my main character, even though they‚Äôre super precious weapons but not for my build/chosen perk cards. What are people MEANT to do if not offload their one in a thousand chance weapons to a mule? 
---
Cheers bro. I keep my eyes peeled!
---
For them to be community managers they seem real out of touch with the community. Plenty of helpful pre nerf suggestions were made and got literally zero response from the community managers or passed on. 
---
So I believe some in the community feel they arent doing their jobs either. Tired of seeing the same post about passing it on. Bring us an explanation and some transparency which bethesda promised. 
---
I'm sorry you got caught by the r/games trolls here. These people can't be reasoned with. They decided that they will hate on Fo76 and will spin out any narrative to undermine your opinion. Nice to see reasonable people here. 
---
Cheers dude.

Nothing in the game makes sense. No way a switchblade would do more damage than a 50 cal machine gun round that explodes. 
---
the dogs are especially annoying at the prime site during the event, try using vats when one of those things is flying around. it‚Äôs like spinning around at the speed of light
---
I can see why they banned you from 76 but I can't see how they can legitimately ban you from other games you've purchased. That doesn't seem to fit within consumer laws. 
---
Wow. I've never seen a comment so short, yet so wrong. Please, turn on your brain when you go online and don't judge everyone by your pathtletic little existence. 
---
Used 3000 50 cal bullets on the scorchbeast queen with maxed out heavy guns perks and couldnt even do 10% damage to her. This isn't leveling, it's making the game more tedious and lengthy than it already is.
---
Oh by the way, fanboys you can attack all you like. I am not intimidated by you üòÇüòÇ
---
Edgy and original
---
"30+ minutes" is longer than the timer on the event. The fight ends after 30 minutes if the Scorchbeast Queen has not been defeated.
---
definitely a difference. I play a stealth sniper so it's very noticable.
---
Bethesda dev teams are currently unavailable trying on the new jackets. Please  leave a message and someone will get back to you in 10000 years.
---
Wouldn't this game be an albatross to anyone than maybe Obsidian? 
---
Given the very large dark cloud that looms over the game and how unrealistically sky high expectations on the next company would be, I wouldn't think any sane person would continue on with the game's development.
---
Only way out I see is that Bethesda hunkers down and fixes the core problems with the dev team, whether it's management, skills, man power, budget or whatever else it may be. 
---
Maybe then we have a chance. Right now, I just don't see it happening with the current team. It'll be incremental changes at best with devastating bugs post each new content release. They can't even handle patch releases properly right now.
---
Of course it's possible solo with right Setup but add more players and it's still fucked
---
Low standards are at least some standarsds. Apparently you wouldn't recognize a good game even if it hit you in the head. 
---
Well it's respectable but the SBQ levels and gets stronger with how many players there are. The problem almost every time mentioned is when lower level players come in mass or even higher levels which dont help and makes it harder to kill the queen. So the best possible option to kill it is to be alone if you are good in what you do. Back than we called ppl leechers who act like many players when the Queen comes.
---
No, i was just like most people in this sub. I believed bethesda would fix it. I lasted 3 patches
---
I'm a bit annoyed by the TSE bundle nerf in a way. I never had a TSE weapon but did have a TS (non explosive) weapon I really enjoyed using. Now all the time i spent raiding blast zones with friends for it feels wasted since it's near useless now.  I've always felt TSE was way too strong of a combo and should have been made a prefix like the TS so they can't be paired up. Were both of them powerful? Yes, but I feel like instead of just nerfing both of them into the ground they should have weakened them a bit and ALSO added or changed other legendary effects to make them more desirable as opposed to the TS or E effect. Of course everyone is going to be going for the 2 most powerful effects. They were the only ones that were really worth *grinding* for, but now that's gone too. There's just very little to do being level 120+ and trying to get powerful top tier end game weapons legitimately with friends and randoms was what I liked doing. 
---
TSE weapons were massively op, you realize that the weapon did 300% damage right? The TS providing a 100% increase and the E providing the same. That makes literally everything else i. The game obsolete. Nothing in the game would be needed but a TSE. I feel the nerf was needed for pve and pvp. Maybe less so than what they did but still needed. 
---
I got a legendary tse Bobbypin. Unfortunately it weighed 300 pounds so I left it. 
---
Make this post again!
---
Possibly. However we certainly know man power and budget aren't a problem for bethesda, skills maybe the true issue. They need new staff, new writer, new PR. They aren't going to get away with this again.
---
I personally, do not think they are putting effort into 76. I think there's at tops, 5 guys at bethesda working on the game. There's no way they could waste resources so much with more people. It's impossible with the state of the game. No way is it more than 5 devs.
---
I was in a whitesprings nuke today with three of my pals using an auto tesla rifle.  Same thing happened to me.  Mid- mob at the golf course the weapon just stopped doing damage entirely.  I'd have to quit to desktop and restart.  I guess it was actually ok, because I kept spawning new mobs for everyone else.  I just wish I got to apply damage to the corpses so that I could use the rifle for the intended purpose of tagging mobs and sharing the bounty with others.
---
At least someone felt bad for me and hooked me up with an instigating/vats acc hunting rifle.
---
Nice concise post. Hopefully Bethesda sees this and takes it to heart.
---
All the best dude.
---
LOL sure.
---
 The best pistol in the game. ;)
---
How do people get to solo her every time Nuke her I have level 30 dealing near no damage flocking to her.
---
Yes I agree with others here used to be so much better now they are average along with alot of weapons atm 
---
They made it very clear it was an online only/mp only game from the get-go. They hustled no one.
---
Thats neat, but why did you post a picture of a butterfly?
---
ok.
---
Players were scrapping their Ultracite armor and it was a thing that apparently happened pretty often, so they leveled it with X01 "free" plans. Most players were already hemorrhaging Ultracite armor plans to the point they had no value, anyway.
---
There was never a reason to craft anything that wasn't X01 or Ultracite unless you were in a rush to loop scrap for mods. Plain dropped versions usually had something special that you couldn't craft (often very high condition, for example) or just couldn't be bothered to set up high INT to craft (which really isn't that hard and there used to be an exploit). Early, it was kind of fun to find your first hardened radium rifle to play with to decide if it was something you liked.
---
The rarity of legendaries made it interesting to build your character against. Interesting for me, anyway, as everyone else seems to complain it's impossible to get levels in this game. I've probably "respecced" my character at least 3 times now. I might do it again because I just picked up a legendary Gauss I kind of want to play with. I have at least 7 perk points queued.....
---
People are too busy with the TSE crap to see how broken some of the other mechanics really are. I'm actually kind of interested in seeing what happens when the PVP mode launches. It's good to see Hunter/Hunted got some attention this patch, but it's going to be a whole new ball game when it's a server full of invincible VATS teleport falcon punchers. Try it in Monster Mash some time.
---
Deathclaw drop gears.
---
They‚Äôre giving us a new PVP  mode in March, aren‚Äôt you excited /s
---
they r liars.
---
What did you find?
---
Make this sub OK again.
---
Lol. Man. That was a good laugh

I think they didnt give you a bunch of patch notes again.
---
examples: vats not remembers the last limb you targeted.
---
vats crit meter fills up slower and crits no longer count toward more crits.
---
obvious stealth nerf
---
Physical copies only, digital ones, are full price.
---
&gt;I swear the power armors are made of more screws and springs than the main component. You probably need less black titanium for the excavator armor than you do gears.
---
There's a junk pile not far from the bridge and under a pylon near Harper's Ferry, makes an ideal camp spot.
---
Sorted out my gear and screw needs.
---
Jesus. What's wrong with you? 
---
i have had several sessions where i stay on a server long enough it's just me and maybe one other person
---
Because of the latest nerf... Bethesda really shit all over us
---
Just saying that is slightly longer than 316 days. If you play 3 hours a day it will take you 2533.33 days. 5 hours a day you can do it in 1520 days which equates to I am never getting 7600 hours. Anyway 20 atoms sounds about right.
---
Why does everyone assume that people bought their weapons from ebay? Its always the ignorant ass remark too. TSE dummy bought of ebay for irl money or some other variation. 
---
I am over level 300 and about 160 of levels have come from from farming the queen and nerfsprings. There are many others who also farmed weapons or traded for them or used caps. 
---
You do know that god roll melee weapons and armor were sold just as much as tse right? 
---
It'd be better for consoles... Small updates on pc, all rolled into large updates on console
---
When they fuck something up (Bobby pins) consoles get that fixed before it affects them 
---
A hotfix? That‚Äôs not a hotfix. That‚Äôs literally just a ‚Äúwait till we get around to doing a bug update‚Äù 
---
Yeah the other team is modeling the spiffy jacket....the model is the dev.
---
Arby'sgeddon.
---
Honey you got a Roast Beef comin'
---
Bruh, BGS just griefed their entire player base, where do you think these players learnt it from? 
---
Yes get in a gun fight before you enter and that as fast as they will make it. Next request....I'm pretty good at this.
---
Lots of people feeling the need to announce this to everyone today.
---
Breaking news: Literally nobody cares
---
It's cool, I've talked about giving him the cash for a new copy of the game, but he's kinda burnt on the game, and Bethesda in general after what they've done.  Can't say I blame him on that.
---
Ciao
---
They wont listen to the community on this one either. Just like 100s of different suggestions were presented prior to this patch and they still nerfed everything into oblivion and made it super grindy. 
---
I stopped watching that guy in times when he covered F4 mods - even then most of his videos was nothing more than massive clickbaits. Got him blocked on YT, waste of time to even open his crappy clips...
---
That might be my problem then I can't be on that long, only about 2-3 hours a day.
---
You know that saying this, makes it sound that you are. It sounds that you have your back against the wall and a loaded gun in your shaking hands, while you scream: "I am not intimidated by you!" to the shadows.
---
I actually didn‚Äôt downvote you 
---
&gt;Anything on explosive weapons? 
---
Deside first if you talk about explosive or TSE. They are different.
---
&gt;Nerf was supposed to drop from 100% damage bonus to 25% damage bonus,
---
Nope, that was TS. Explosive 100% -&gt;20% bonus.
---
My explosive revolver dropped from 279 to 146. Now that I'm trying to figure out how it's calculated, can't figure it out. I might need to do check what base damage of non-legendary is, but total damage seems somewhat less than expected.
---
Wow, the incompetence is mind boggling. How do you be this shit Bethesda?
---
Nerfing tse was a good move. Now they can work to bring things up to desired balance. Specifically perking/modding to counter tse is no way to play.
---
Keeping this in mind i see what your trying to get at, but having a good starting field and slowly bringing it up is far better vs letting one run wild. 
---
It‚Äôs bugged for some including me. After you complete the first part of the quest you can no longer login in modus to get the location of the items. You can‚Äôt get the location from modus the item don‚Äôt spawn. So the quest is impossible to complete if you are unlucky. 
---
When? Literally every time a multiplayer game is played. I've had less crashes in this game than I did in RDR2, GTAV, ME3, COD and Battlefield.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
My bad. I fucked up the links. Fixed now!
---
I throw out such number of legendaries in a single day of being focused on farming.
---
You can say buying illegal guns from shady guys is not Falloutish, but I will not be really interested in your opinions if you say so, because that is the most Fallout thing there is.
---
This is satire 
---
Ah ha game setting changes...hot fixes...hmmm 
---
Doubt they will, but thanks. 
---
I fear Bethesda have gone full Konami on us üò•
---
So 
---
You‚Äôre claiming foul and dick move of Bethesda of their rescinding their free offer of fallout 1 and 2
---
But you don‚Äôt acknowledge your dick move of breaking their terms of service?
---
FWIW, i think you‚Äôre lucky,  that they DONT litigate and sue you for breach of contract.
---
Finally if you and other duper‚Äôs actions were the reasons, (creating an unstable environment, ruining people‚Äôs perception and gaming experience) why my friends and others stopped playing, you got what you deserve.
---
Oh I feel ya, I paid $40 nzd and still feel ripped
---
Sweet, less stress on the servers and Bethesda still got that money for future development. Seems like a win to me.
---
Damn I had to do a double take when I read your username haven‚Äôt seen that name in a bit 
---
It would benefit Bethesda and the player base if OP asked publicly the basis for his or her suspension
---
But he could fix all the bugs and balance the game in the blink of an eye!
---
Due to over spawning of power armor frames we nerfed power armor from +100 damage resistant to -100 damage to balance things out. We also increased the animation time by +20%. Please enjoy our game.
---
Specifically countering up the greatest stack of perks with appropriate stack of antiperks is a good thing. TSE barely scratched me, now they do no damage, while I still can 1shot most of the guys with my other weapons. But thats besides the main point, I want bashing damage fixed, I want people contestig workshops, I want more diversity and less useless items.
---
No that would be something funny
---
I was very leery of launching a nuke after the patch. They fucked up nuke launching once already and had to fix it.   Someone else launched a nuke tonight and the server crashed right after it hit.
---
Damn I had those two and scrapped them, seemed pretty useless to me
---
The problem is, i enjoy the game currently, as I'm sure many do. The content lack of is what's killing me inside. 
---
Blah blah blah!
---
Well did you learn something new?
---
I am legit making the default response people are shit posting. GIV UPVOTES
---
I think it is meant for everyone to have their opinion/story/question and voice heard which all subscribers have a right to do. 
---
Saying they dont have that right sounds like a communist
---
75% reduction to dmg on double shot was more than enough without changing demolition expert. I 100% agree with you. 
---
At this point I'm not tempted to leave the reddit over the game lol, though i enjoy the reddit, silly people and all, much like the game itself, flaws and all. 
---
If you feel you gotta explain it...it definitely isn‚Äôt funny 
---
That, and tennis. 
---
I almost downvoted you out of habit of down voting negatives in this post but then I happened to read what you said and thought. ‚ÄúFuck man I need to do my best to make this guy positive!‚Äù
---
Cdkeys sell this game for $10 and even then it is too expensive
---
It‚Äôs not that hard, I think I have around 100 hours and just hit lvl 25 last night. Do some starting quests and you get a lot of XP for finishing plus items that you can actually use. Around white springs I can hardly use weapons I picked up or killed shit for when I was lvl 20. Usually I was getting 25+ things. You have to grind a little, nothing in life is free.. nothing in games is free either ;) (unless you‚Äôre a sore loser and just cheat)
---
Like everybody does, you make compromises: you keep your weapons in your stash and sacrifice other junks. 
---
Or you sell or trade it with another player. Why keeping it when you don't intend to use it? 
---
That's how the game is supposed to be played.
---
I see the issue with workshops as say they produce a lot of stuff fast. Then people don't need to hold onto them for very long before they have thousands of a certain resource and then they don't need workshops anymore, so back to square 1. They just need to include some other incentives, and make them more fun. Like imagine if the waves of mobs that attack the workshop increase in frequency and level, with the chance of some 3 star legendary spawns? Then actually defending a workshop becomes worth it.
---
This is just like your beloved sub these days.
---
gave up a few weeks ago
---
now i'm just here everyday with virtual popcorn. the FALLOUT over fallout, has become the entertainment now
---
That really makes the most sense. 
---
If I have one broken shotgun and six functional ones, surely I have the materials to end up fixing my broken one
---
The plans... That spawn 100% through a simple quest? If you give me 500 caps all discard it for you. 
---
Beat me to it
---
Not 100% spawn rate, hopped 10 servers no spawns but 1
---
What a shitshow
---
Explosive weapons? 
---
Thats not them doing it though. They have reports and if something is a bug they will report it. Its their job. You wouldn't get mad at a cashier who asked you to hand over the money to pay for your items, why get mad at them for doing what they are supposed to. 
---
I love it when people exploit the game and then come crying to a forum of choice to say how innocent they are.  Makes for great reading!
---
Lol this is literally the last post I saw in r/Fo76 I have to remove it to keep the final shred of sanity I hold from all the whine. 
---
 Always craft new Leather Armor rather than repair it. Much cheaper. I generally do this with all armor but my present set I'll be rebuilding for a long time. 
---
 My BOS Heavy Combat Armor I have no plans for. I'm not sure there are any for it. I do know all the BOS mods and apply them to Combat, Sturdy Combat and Heavy Combat. My present level 50 set is 285b 325e and 3r from the underarmor. ;) I have Dense on the Chest and Strengthened on the limbs. A 40mm nade' into the ground at my feet does basically nothing. ;)
---
they just need to remove durability. there is already enough tediousness in the game. ammo is already a consumable used to fire it. irritating to throw in durability + having to scrounge for more mats + farm more.
---
i'm kinda really irritated by ultracite ammo requiring pure fluxes to craft. there's just way to much grinding in the game.
---
Game devs saw the problems; so they deleted post pointing those problems. That's how they care about
---
it's delet
---
"I don't like fo76 and therfore you musn'too!" is something I hear all too commonly in youtube comments. BTW I think they meant r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
No hot fix is a patch which evolves redownloading parts of the game. Game setting changes just change difficulty levels in the map making one hardcore or another not. Remember under the map glitch at array. Your settings have been updated sending you to main menu doesn't fix the array under map bug. I patch is where a game file changes, forcing parts of the game to upload and update your console or pc. A hot fix is where a small piece of code developed to correct a major software bug or fault and released as quickly as possible. Cannot happen on console because that requires large amounts of data to be redownload unlike a pc where a single file can be changed. 
---
Personally I'd rather not do it all over again.. Just to enjoy more pvp... Especially with latest balancing 
---
..... didn't you call me a shill before? O.o
---
It's 12.99$ for faster loading bundle
---
Something giving good rewards isnt a bug, if you hadn't noticed they skim the cream off with every patch, that's the kick in the nuts part :-)
---
Just have them review it and if you are legit toyll be fine. 
---
I do believe that oneshotting anybody through slap damage to be a terrible idea, but I also now its noy TSE problem. Its two different issues: bobblehead stacking that must be fixed, and PvP rules unawareness within the community (i.e. if your teammate initiates violence with other team, or somebody claims a workshop, there are certain scenarios where one player can shoot and kill the other without slap damage)
---
Ps3/x360/pc
---
Ultimate anniversary edition or whatever its called
---
Ps4x1
---
Remastered version
---
FO:76 release was like the FYRE festival of the gaming world.  
---
Ohhhh, so painful. Because it's true.
---
20 or so days... It'll all be a thing of the past
---
This dupe glitch happened to me several times already. Sometimes I get an empty power armor shell but sometimes I get an exact copy of my power armor which is an awesome surprise. Mods and all. Usually I just break down the duplicate pieces for scrap 
---
Although I probably won‚Äôt play again till march / new content / big fixes, posts like this coming from a random dude who has not really anything to say besides how stupid we are for playing a game don‚Äôt really mean anything to me (and probably most of us). Why even bother posting in here?
---
TSE may have needed a nerf (at least when it comes to PVP engagements) but it was too much of a nerf. You're right though, the attractiveness of TSE for me was eliminating the bullet sponginess of enemies, therefore not needing to repair and craft/scavange ammo as much. But since that nerf and the others, I havent bothered with 76, it was getting boring and tedious before and now its worse.
---
If anyones looking for a great game to play either because they've given up on this mess or awaiting further improvement, Ive been playing the Resident Evil 2 remake and its bloody awesome, highly recommend it.
---
Nice to meet you though.....
---
Or check this out, what if each workshop would have a workshop perk card thats kinda passive and a reward for holding the workshop? That would be massively cool
---
But mah endgame.
---
Yeah.. same here. 100 hours in and level 31. So much of the map i have not explored yet, barely touched the quests yet. 
---
I play it pretty much like how i imagine beeing in that kind of situation. I explore every little nook and cranny i can find. 
---
And i dont play the game all the time. At the moment i pretty much play four games. F76, Assasins creed Odyssey, Battlefield V and Resident evil 2. Depends on what i feel like playing from day to day. 
---
I just enjoy exploring and meeting random strangers. I‚Äôve also spent way too much time on building and changing my CAMP.
---
I didn‚Äôt wear armour until I was level 60 and started getting good perks and legendary armour. Dunno if it helps 
---
I don't recall that. But if I did then I wouldn't have been using the term incorrectly.
---
&gt; 1 hour 12 minutes also seems like a super arbitrary number... 12 minutes? Really?
---
12 times 5 is 60. So five events take five hours plus an extra 60 minutes. That makes it 20 times a day.
---
Oh I was wondering what would happen if you put on the grognak costume on a female character 
---
You can enjoy something while also acknowleding it's also in a pretty poor state, similar to listening to the Spice Girls.
---
Rather have a solidish stableish base game to add content into
---
I like how this guy proves your point by circle jerking all overyou. I'm pretty sure aaxo isn't an individual but the pure essence of this sub
---
Although these posts flood the subreddit, I think every single one of them is important to show the devs that something is really wrong with the current state of the game. The more people raise their voice the better.
---
Bulk items are not broken down while crafting. The game says that I don't have 5 rubber but in stash I have 12 bulk rubber. Please fix fast this is so annoying when creating or repairing items.
---
Its on PC
---
no, it's always there if you open TNT dome 3... Shame, it's only for T-51b...
---
i don't get it. the whole of reddit is like this, it's a place for feedback good or bad. the reason there are so many overreactions is because the game is in a shoddy hot mess and it seems the devs aren't getting better at patching/fixing things, let alone bringing in playable content
---
is this a meme on my r/fo76 
---
I would be bored to hell just grinding the same place over and over again. That would for sure kill the game for me.
---
His support message clearly says what he was banned for - duping. He says he didn't do it. Why would he say anything else?
---
i still think that durability should remain left out of the game, like skyrim and fo4. the games already have a large amount of tedium without it.
---
Ohhh!! So that‚Äôs why my Nuka Cola helmet now has an atom shop icon next to it. I made it red tactical to match the paint job. At least now I can easily differentiate it from my other power armors. Thanks!
---
If its giving more than they programmed and wanted it to, it is a bug. Also the community managers arent doing anything but relaying information. Bethesda austin isn't skimming the cream. They are adding salt to your drink. 
---
I hope all the remaining playerbase know they are Bethesdas free QA team
---
Can we run into Arlene. That would be cool.
---
I don't think that's how any of this works.
---
I think you're confusing _moderately capable_ with shill and, from a below average perspective, everything looks like magic to you.
---
Hell even WoW has scaled their dungeons so that everyone in between 1-60 can do a dungeon togethor with only the availability of abilities as their difference
---
I made it through destiny up to the forges... This is childs play. 
---
Woah
---
I don't like how you dismiss the fans that weren't positive about this game as not being "True Fans". Being a true fan doesn't mean being completely subservient and happy when a game company screws up, otherwise Star Wars Battlefront 2 would have made approximately all the money ever.
---
i understood it as he looted things dupers had dropped manually, not from death (i.e. duped items). not a question about junk.
---
i highly doubt bethesda would have a system to sift through looted junk. it's obviously a quantity of suspect items - like TSE weapons or large junk piles - otherwise their algorithm wouldn't trigger.
---
also, dunno what the original post said, but it seems he admitted to knowing the items he looted were duped? and additionally moved over these to the community mule? sounds to me like knowingly using duped items and spreading them out, harming the game just as much as the original dupers.
---
if that's true, he definitely deserves a ban.
---
I have a distance between me and my gf. I am just playing with her because with 76 we can spend more time together. 
---
But god game is awful quest desings bad. Events worth  nothing. There is no such thing in this game rewarding. 
---
Everytime you lose something your armor breaks, weapon breaks, stimpaks finishes, ammo etc. and you gain literally nothing. 
---
Bless your commitment but this reads as a massively toxic relationship. One side thinking the other will change yet they continue to remain a distant and toxic partner. 
---
Is it time to throw in the towel and stop defending these people? 
---
BECAUSE THEY WERE OVERPOWERED AND THIS IS NOT A SINGLE PLAYER GAME
---
Your snake eyes analogy is incorrect. You're making an (obviously incorrect) assumption about the probability of getting a result you don't like (that it should be equally likely as the results you want) and calling the RNG bad instead of revising your estimate of the probability. On a pair of distinct (cubic) dice, there are 36 possible outcomes  It would indeed be unlikely that you would roll snake eyes twenty times in a row; this would occur with a probability of 1/36^20, which is vanishingly small. But getting the mod you don't want isn't like rolling snake eyes. 
---
Instead of estimating the probability of receiving that plan by calculating the event probability based on your observations, you're insisting that it has to be different, and concluding that the dice (the RNG) are weighted. This is the opposite of how you should approach probability.
---
Repeatedly getting the same result from an RNG is only evidence of a broken RNG if you expect all possible results to have an equal probability. *That clearly isn't how plans used to work.* Some plans were deliberately rare. 
---
If explosive vents have a 95% spawn chance, calibrated shocks a 4% chance, and the jetpack a 1% chance, then a functional RNG is going to give you the shit plan, *at random*, 95% of the time. You should expect to see the jetpack only once or twice in one hundred server hops.  Getting two calibrated shocks would not be easy.
---
"Random" doesn't mean that all outcomes occur with the same probability: it simply means that the outcomes are chosen in a completely arbitrary way. For the above example, imagine the RNG as a roll of fair percentile dice: rolling 1-95 gets you an explosive vent, rolling 96-99 gets you calibrated shocks, and rolling 100 (00 on the dice) gets you the jetpack. Because the dice are fair, this is a perfect RNG and the selection process is completely random as a result. 
---
It might have been the red tactical headlamp. It‚Äôs registering as a mothman headlamp now which will be in the shop soon. Same thing happened to me and that‚Äôs what it was in my case
---
Yeah nah
---
Trading to other players is the only real way of gaining money fast other than killing people for caps.
---
Find legendary items or plans to sell.
---
You can always sell to vendors but selling prices are too low and the vendor cap restricts too much, even if you trade to all available vendors You will only gather around 1200-1400 caps per day.
---
Not beating around the bush here but to gather enough caps for something that's 10-12k would require 9-10 days of saving this way. The handmade is about 1560 caps so only 2 days of saving  
---
I lost my chest piece and weapon due to different bug too. 
---
THAT! Is actually a great idea. And I would totally take workshops more for it.
---
Only, according to how they have been operating, that's not the case. They introduce horrible bugs into the PC version, only to introduce them to the console version a week later. These people don't learn. And it takes more time to fix it on consoles.
---
Sounds like you got your money's worth out of a survival game. You're welcome: Everyone at BGS.
---
They nerfed explosives and two shot. So if you had a two shot explosive it‚Äôs basically non legendary now
---
I think he‚Äôs admitted publicly that he‚Äôs guilty. What he hasn‚Äôt done is express remorse.
---
I doubt he ever will.
---
Actually with my country's conversion rate I paid around $300 overal; &gt;.&lt;
---
Oh shit it‚Äôs Christmas. You‚Äôre like alternative Gandalf 
---
It could be, my friend was sporting a red lamp on his so he may have put that on as a bonus for me which went horribly wrong :( 
---
That guy duped and bragged about it on previous posts. Seems pretty fair to me.
---
200 hours and only lvl 50??? 
---
It's giving what they programmed, no more, no less. They want you to grind for things, that's why they do it. Not because it was unbalanced, they want it unbalanced, less rewarding. What's rewarding about what they've done?
---
Always ignore the vocal minority, take a look at posts that agree with what I'm saying, even discount 50% as stampy feet children in a tantrum and the same rings true.
---
it does say they can terminate your right to their services at any moment for any reason (or even no reason). so, technically...
---
if we're not talking about technically (but instead morally)... then it's not such a huge leap to think that looting duped items that you know were duped (because you specifically chased down dupers), and then spreading them out on a community mule to be shared (again, knowing these items were duped!), is an equal crime as to the original dupe, or perhaps even greater.
---
it's not the duping per se that is horrible, it's what the duped items bring. looting them and making them accessible to hundred of people is worse than duping for your own sake.
---
if this is true - that he took duped items knowingly and shared them on some community mule - then he deserved the ban. it's not a stretch of justice at all, and the punitive damage directly correlates with the amount of damage caused to the game.
---
Gotta get more atoms! 
---
I guess you don't remember there whole solo gamer we are hear for you add campaign, it was great check it out ,they also stated you could play solo or with friends and mayhaps I and others took that to literally seeing in hindsight that was my mistake......but don't get it twisted they fukin hustled everyone to pay to play this unfinished pre alpha train wreck of a game imo 
---
They are currently deleting masses of posts of those that show their disappointment with Fallout76 and criticize Bethesda
---
Your reasons and what you do make no difference, break is a break. I've probably taken longer breaks from the game than all these "I'm done for real this time Bethesda!" posts.
---
It's just sad that people have to announce it like they are having a divorce proceeding or something. Just stop playing, no one really cares, come back to it or not, don't need to make it a ceremony.
---
Ultracite calibrated shocks plans exist, except she never drops them.  When I complain about it, people say "that's just the nature of RNG." 
---
No. the nature of RNG is RANDOM.  There is nothing random about the SBQ plan drops. 
---
She drops vents 99.99 percent of the time.  How is that random? 
---
Truly random drops would mean that if she randomly drops 6 different mods, then  there is a 1 in 6 chance of getting the mod you want. 
---
But that simply isn't true. 
---
If you are looking for calibrated shocks, then the chances are more like 1 in 1000. 
---
Let's thank people for doing their basic work? Man, the fanboys are something else.
---
Or to anything else, really. Melee. 
---
I had a Zealot ‚Äòs explosive one.  I discarded it because it was completely ineffective. 
---
Both are computer systems so technically they both have the ability to get hot fixes...
---
Just bringing the name in line with the lacklustre weapon, nothing to see here.
---
I‚Äôm level 16 (I bought the game last month and only get to play every so often) and it‚Äôs almost impossible to level up because every area that I end up questing in has at least level 40/50+ mobs. It‚Äôs honestly just made me go back to playing ESO instead..
---
Thats generaliy the appoach I wanted the game to take. I do think that best scenario would be when people would be trying not to world hop because the rewards for persistency, but that would require 'rejoin last server' button :)
---
Yep thought so, it‚Äôs a red tactical headlamp. I‚Äôd look up a power armor farming video. After a few fast travels I was able to get a full suit of t51b to paint with Nuka Cola skin. It‚Äôs pretty easy. That‚Äôs why I put the red light on in the first place, to match the paint job
---
"IT JUST WORKS"
---
loOk
---
"if their store layout lets me steal, that's their problem. if they don't want me stealing then they should fix their damn store" - u/TryppyTyrtle probably
---
MAKE my sub with cheese again
---
One per second! My god the sheer minutes you've wasted. 
---
Thanks for actually replying, even if it seems like stuff isn't getting done at least we know we're not just yelling into the void.
---
I just realised my previous comment may seem like sarcasm. I'm actually meant it in agreement
---
Yeah I had 132 comments and bam my post got deleted
---
It does.
---
I bought mine at harpers ferry. Not to be confused with herpes ferry that was repeatedly mentioned earlier..lolz
---
Hey Vladtepesx3, do you have a ticket number you can DM to me so I can follow this up with the support team?
---
Exactly.  So, call his bluff and prove that he was banned for duping.  Helps the community realize that people are being banned exclusively for legit reasons.  How does this hurt? 
---
 [u/BethesdaGameStudios\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaGameStudios_)  Is this your anti-dupe solution now? Just banning people when they craft multiple items in a row? The level of incompetence on Bethesda's side is hilarious.
---
This is just how this game runs. Haha wait til you fight a scorchbeast.
---
Making a new character feels atrociously bad because they do nothing but nerf how fast it tskes, like that's going to help me spend time in your game. I stopped playing a while ago and told myself I'd come back after they made some good changes. It looks more like they want to focus on making your grind to the too (which has nothing there) longer and filled with less loot.
---
It should feel like I'm putting my sword to the grindstone, not my teeth.
---
Were you under a rock all day today?
---
Wait the [KNOWN] Tag on plans was a bug? I thought that was a new feature so you didn't accidentally buy already known plans...
---
Almost 50 (49 3/4) ish  and yes I enjoy game content..I don‚Äôt run to find the faster way. I play my way. 
---
It's not 100% mate. I didn't get until my 3rd hop
---
And you can just pop out of your power armor in the middle of a nuke zone to use the workbench!
---
No explosives period.
---
Yes, this is also a much needed feature. I'll be on a server for an hour or 2, then "hey someone s dropping a nuke on prime". Suit up, run out, 1 shot at the scorchqueen and .... Disconnect. I can't get back to the server
---
You are positive you hadn‚Äôt chugged a Rad-X some point before? One of the side effects is suppressing mutations. 
---
i do too...just weird how you're leveling so slow
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt know what their game is.
---
Yeah I've got maps showing all the power armor locations within WV so won't take me long to find a new one but luckily I had a spare t-60 in the time being 
---
That or something in the base is floating. or will be floating because of how the game rounds numbers every time a CAMP is placed
---
people play multiple characters with different needs man. I find weapons that are so rare that I will make a new character and design a build around it.
---
we have 5 character slots, you know that, right?
---
1. PC (Windows 10)
---
2. Same as my username here.
---
3. Didn't take any.

4. At the "Production" terminals in the Whitesprings Bunker, all the MODUS terminals except one show as constantly busy and unusable.

5. N/A

Rename two shot to shrapnel, it makes more sense now
---
Agreed :D
---
Should be fine. Haven't used that mod but I am using Better Inventory and no problems. It's probably against the TOS butt I can't see you being banned for just using a  QOL mod like that. 
---
Right. And this is fine. But you're out of topic now, post is about using a mule where you use a character you're not using as a mule.
---
What would be awesome (but unlikely) is to actually show the armor pieces themselves mounted on the frame in the inventory preview. 
---
"uuuh no u"
---
Great rebuttal.
---
Me too, it was at Mount Blair for me
---
Ugh could you get any more basic.
---
I think this may have been the reason why they put such a high price on the plan.
---
This post in insanely detailed - thank you shadow core. I know I might sound like a broken record, but I have let the team know of these issues with heavy and energy weapons. However, I do want to let you know that I'll be sharing your thread as well - it's incredibly helpful.
---
You should look into getting a surge protector  multi plug have had them blow up saving my equipment.

Patches on console take longer because they need to be properly certified before release. The last thing Sony or MS or any console maker wants is an update that somehow messes up the console. Also I'm fairly certain the charging for patches by MS and Sony were done away with at beginning of this generation. PC has the benefit of being a market that noone really owns. PlayStation and Xbox are closed markets with stricter rules because they can get away with it. Devs on PC also have the ability to rapidly push patches through and fix things as they pop up. On console, because of the certification process, developers tend to bundle as much new content, bug fixes, and overall improvements into a single patch that they can. I'd assume this is done practically for both sides. the certification teams aren't overloaded with numerous small patches and the developers dont have to worry about numerous patch statuses. Also MS and Sony prefer developers take the extra time to get it right the first time, whereas PC devs can release a patch that fucks the game up and then quickly patch it again often times within hours or quicker. On console, releasing a bad patch that can't be fixed on the server side basically means your game will remain in that state for days, a week, or even a couple weeks.
---
Sit down and be quiet you.
---
If thats all you got from that then you must not be too bright. Whatever.
---
Is there any interesting combat or something dangerous? I know it's about exploration, but I need danger to feel engaged. Subnautica did this well.

What you need. I got a bunch

How is he said proof that he was duping lol so if someone said they didnt eat anything your logic is that he did your literally saying the opposite of what his saying so no thats not a valid source of proof again your just being negative to make people feel like shit get out of here with your toxic shit.
---
Yeah I'm just worried about getting banned for using it. It's the only mod I really can't play the game without.
---
Completely this

Lolz but think of all the hours it saved you from?

What the hell man?!?! Glad I'm done learning radiums! Hopefully they'll get this sorted out fast!

Fallout 76 - Xbox One and yes, you can.  I do NOT keep my hacking and lockpicking cards all in the loadout as I do not come across 2/3 regularly in my travels and switch to them only when I do, same with armor, gunsmith, etc.  If I have to switch between my guass (run out of cartridges, it breaks, etc) to my combat shotty, I switch my energy weapon cards for my shotgun cards.
---
Now this may be different on PC/PS4, no idea, but bring up your perks, there's your current 'load', select your card you want to toss back in your pile (looking at my screen right this second Pack Rat under Strength is highlighted because it's the last in that colum, so we'll go with that). I pressed 'unequip', it's gone and I have three points to toss up something else.
---
You can do this with any card in any column and regularly switch them out for the ones you do want so long as they match the points you've freed up.  
---
Too many to name your bound to have something. What‚Äôs your psn?
---
I will admit something here, thats on the border of cheating, and that made my life great. I multilog. I have two PCs and Two F76 accounts. I'm always in a team with myself. You know what is the main purpose why I did so? PERSISTENCY IN GAMEPLAY, ability to rejoin server. I just can't describe how less stressful it became. Also it helps with lots of bugs i.e. my friend is not visible online from acc X but visible from Y, I join friend with Y and join Y with X, problem solved, WTF.
---
I found a load of recipes there yesterday (never seen anything there before though). It was a nice find as I don't really have many recipes so I took the ones I don't have and replaced them with all of my duplicate plans/recipes... hope someone else found them useful before the server reset!
---
Try get it dupe now. Then when it has done so, a few times, scrap all the items in one go. Then get back to me. Past few week a auto system is in place I'm sure. I was building and only building for days before the ban 
---
well, that's the thing isn't it. what did he loot? we don't know. we do know this:
---
a) OP looted something not worth of a ban, but was banned anyway, or
---
b) OP looted something worth of a ban, and was banned
---
in either cases, it's safe to assume that bethesda knows what he looted because why would they otherwise bring action against him? so in the case of a), we have to assume bethesda has made a wrong decision about the nature of items he looted (i.e. they think a 100 screws must be duped), and in the case of b), we have to assume bethesda made a decision based on something \*obvious\* (i.e. 7000 screws, 200 TSE weapons, 100 of one type of legendary with same affixes/prefixes, etc).
---
i don't think bethesda would risk anymore ire from their fans - especially not the developers (who most likely are behind the bans as they are of technical nature), who are more in touch with their playerbase and the game itself - so it ends up in this: either i believe this random guy that "he couldn't reasonably know those items were duped", despite this game being rife with dupers and exploiters, or i believe bethesdas judgement (who i, personally, believe to ere on the cautious side) and it was a clear-cut case of duped items.
---
there are a number of red flags that you might ask yourself. if OP and his friends are streamers who have hundreds of hours streamed playing the game, then how come there is no single segment of the things leading up to his ban? how come none of them have a video showing what they looted? and why did he remove his post? why did he remove many other posts in his reddit comment history? why are some of his streamable clips no longer available? why isn't he telling us what he looted?
---
the \*only\* thing that makes me think bethesda might be wrong is because they've failed so much with fallout 76, but that's a logical fallacy and to assume the developers implementing a ban would share the same shortcomings as the publisher on a marketing level is inane at best and delusional at worst.
---
so, with things as they are, it's very hard to feel that OP is not deserving of a ban on the simple idea of knowingly have made use of duped items. that's enough to me; it's as bad as being a duper.
---
if OP indeed did not know these items were duped (correct me if i'm wrong, but his post here and email to bethesda admitted he knew they were duped, so...) and he couldn't reasonable have assumed so, then he does not deserve the ban.
---
Stststststuttering Stanley

they paid so much attention to TSE and nerfed it to holy hell to the point of being meh and they forgot that melee is just as much if not more of a problem. but hey, princess castle bed

Bryangolley, I'll go to my alt and you can look

My medic's explosive double barrel went from one shotting level 68 super mutants to two shotting them. Sometimes it's three if I'm being lazy on the aiming. 
---
It's jarring at first but not as drastic as it's been made to seem. 
---
Since the patch I am having the same issue, as are others.  It applies ‚Äúcaution‚Äù even when nothing is around.   The problem is intermittent as well‚Äîperhaps 70% of the time. 
---
i was responding to you saying people should trade or sell the weapons there current character is using rather than transferring them because it's "cheating"
---
Why would I care if someone has an extra 15 HP?
---
Plus, you can trade to yourself items. Which should have been a feature.
---
Terrible attempt at joke. Downvoted 
---
Funny, I think spending dozens of hours farming whitesprings to hopefully get a TSE to drop is much more stupid than just buying a TSE from eBay for 2 dollars which takes you like 10 minutes of actual work time to be able to afford? I don‚Äôt blame someone who doesn‚Äôt want to spend weeks farming a gun that they can just buy for the price of a cup of coffee 
---
This was wonderful thank you!! 
---
Hey Qhival, I'm trying to find out what could have happened here with your alternate account. Could you DM me so I can get more info off you?
---
I have been much more stable since the patch (PS4). 
---
Leave this game. Have selfrespect. This company has to learn the mistakes they did. Stop supporting someone who is lying to you. Have selfrespect as a customer. 
---
if so, I must be very lucky to get it on my first dome opening...
---
Please consider both options and decide which seems more realistic.
---
A) Bethesda do not have good tracking of its games versions.
---
B) For some reason Bethesda had to go back to a previous versions becouse the last one could not be used for keeping with the improvement of the game.
---
Wathever you decide is fine for me :).
---
This is my second time downvoted for trying /r/fo76 to understand whats going on, and if I'm right youll have more chances for understanding it while I get downvoted again :).
---
¬°No worries!.
---
Nice!
---
Get rid of the TS. That was never useful for sneak rifles. :\
---
There's also something else going on if you can facetank a Yao Guai with an axe but cannot survive at range.
---
Same for order of mysteries.
---
Request sent
---
I appreciate your opinion, what would of made LOL? 
---
but it does. 100% it says "Bethesda and their services", and that it's binding across their services, for example "from here on, Bethesda, and all its services, and affiliates, as well as affiliated services, and all related services, will be referred to as 'services'".
---
this is more a problem with modern consumer protections than it is a problem with bethesda. plenty of games ban you from their platform if you cheat (not all though).
---
not saying i agree with the account wide ban or anything, but it's the risk when you concentrate all your games to one account.
---
No bad idea then that will be used against us.....you have received illegal caps and your account has been suspended indefinately. If you feel we made a mistake, we make no mistakes, then email us and we will never reconsider your ban. Fyi thanks for all your m ok NY and all your games attached to this account wont work. 
---
The stealth indicator [Hidden/caution/danger] seems to be delayed now too when you crouch. It take a few seconds before its even visible for some reason after you enter stealth.
---
I get this feeling you want your c.a.m.p destroyed lol

I'm not the only one it seems. I haven't played in a week and have been jamming Fallout new California. Actually having fun.

It has the stink of Battlefront 2 all over it. Given, Battlefront 2 worked at launch, but was so badly received that EA cut their losses and reduced the dev team size to the point that BF2 has seen only 3 content drops in the last year and a half (2 of them within 2 months of release) , and only just recently started getting monthly content. 
---
Hmm I tried that but the mark iii still didn‚Äôt work from the favorite wheel. Are you on console? 
---
Theory: Bethesda have given up on this game and have moved on to the next one. Hopefully they've learned a few lessons... 
---
I dont know what's a long pew and a short pew pew?
---
Yeah it certainly feels like the twilight zone up in here where people are literally sucking Bethesda‚Äôs knob over mediocre patches that further ruin the already train wreck of a game.
---
Did you find a solution to this? I'm trying to platinum the game but I can't do the monster mash, heart of the enemy and queen of the hunt events. Nothing works when trying to trigger them :/
---
nah, just invert your walls so the brick is on the inside and the concrete on the outside, it's way more aesthetically pleasing that way though i dont know if the wall will line up
---
They levelled TSE to normal levels, side effect being anything that was just TS or E is now pure West Tek Canvas.... shit.
---
They took the wrong path to levelling it basically :-)
---
But I am having so much fun making you explain everything in ludicrous amounts of detail he he 
---
LETS GOOO

hope you guys are aware of this problem, its affecting alot of players

yep, they should nerf melee as well or rebuff tse's.
---
I've got you beat I got a 3 star lead scrap from an legendary Assultron at Watoga.
---
Refunds and go free to play. In reality we will give you 20 atoms which is fair because playing 7600 hours (316 days) gives the same reward.
---
Complaining about downvotes is stupid. That's people giving there opinion on your post just like you give your opinion in the post
---
Wow, that was really something else. My fully upgraded automatic handmade rifle hits for a whopping 68 damage, and his combat rifle hits for 124. Pretty neat build he has too. 
---
Thanks for sharing this!
---
Yeah they didn't really improve this game since launch, glad I stopped playing this pointless grind pretty early.
---
Ummm known problem in patch 5 not your internet
---
What a cop out of a community manager. Shouldn't even call your self that. You are not managing anything . You are trying to tell your customers we are wrong and what your doing is right . Don't fucking beat around the bush 
---
I thought they were some kinda mutated shrimp?
---
I don‚Äôt sleep or use anything that causes xp bonuses usually. I am also a sneak/sniper build sorry attempting at one lol my perks aren‚Äôt great.  I didn‚Äôt really take workshops I dunno just the way I play I guess 
---
Oh my God, the post has been removed. What the hell is going on?
---
This is the one of the worst, apologetic responses I‚Äôve ever heard
---
Hello folks, I think Skeet Shooter is broken after last patch - previously with equipped Skeet Shooter, your crosshairs become much smaller, but now it is even worse than without that perk. Also if you crouch, the crosshairs become even larger. Look at the images: [https://imgur.com/a/9ZSVX9t](https://imgur.com/a/9ZSVX9t)
---
When im bored of a game i usually find something else to play. Maybe i come back to the game i got bored of at a later time, and maybe not.
---
If i force myself to play a game that starts to bore me i end up burning out and rarely return.
---
That's BC the first modus is talking to the last modus about what to break next! Modus is the reason for all the bugs its skynet all over again.
---
Yep, it's power armor being an incredible improvement over conventional armor.  Hidden rad resist, much better DR and a hidden stagger effect with power armor.  If I don't have Blocker perk equipped, a lvl 91 Deathclaw will take me out in 3-4 hits with conventional armor.  They also stagger me, so getting more shots off is incredibly difficult while I'm being bullied.
---
I disagree on the TS Handmade.  It WAS very good for close quarters room clearance up until Tuesday.  My long range was a TSE bolt action pipe rifle, which does about 1/3 of it's previous damage.
---
This is why a lot of the community was in an uproar. It was the wrong way to nerf, because it nerfed so many more weapons than it needed to.
---
All of my two shot weapons, which range from a .44 to a Gatling Plasma, felt weak before the nerf. Now they feel worse than the non two shot versions, and generally are since the second shot often misses the target. They aren‚Äôt two shot weapons, they‚Äôre 0.625 shot weapons with a slight chance for 125% damage. 
---
Compare that to the explosive weapons I have, which feel exactly like they did before - except I can shoot Feral Ghouls point blank and not suffer nearly as much self inflicted health damage as before. That‚Äôs a buff in my eyes. 
---
Hey Aten, no need to apologise at all mate. Keep this feedback coming. I'm going to respond directly to the thread you linked 
---
I have some X-01 i think.
---
I've got to call you out on your claim, radium rifles are a 0.45% learn chance, that's super low, nit easy to learn... 
---
There's three different levels for the three different subs. On filthy casuals, we really don't give a shit about the "meta" and we tune out the temper tantrums of the vocal minority. On fo76, we get the good and the bad. You get your Bethesda defenders, the complainers, the doomsayers, and the overreacters. R/fallput though.. that's just the circle jerk/echo chamber of the worse of the worst elitist neckbeards that all think they're professional gaming philosophers. The kind of people thay react to changes to a goddamn video game as if god struck them down in real life. 
---
I kinda do sometimes, but I'm not really appreciative of such things. I'm a good problem solver, so I solved most of the problems I had with the game if they could be solved, but haven't really been taking all possible advantages to still have some fun. I.e. I purposely build my character in sub-optimal but super-fun way, while having both the knowledge and the means to get the super-optimal build.
---
Next patch : nerf melee
---
I can't speak for Bethesda but I honestly think you will be fine with that one.  Does absolutely no harm to anyone. 
---
The problem isn't greed but incompetence.
---
Honestly, I don't even see any posts or replies made by Bethesda employee on here. I have to actually search real hard to find some "I'll pass it onto our dev team" generic responses.
---
Look more like an ubersized praying mantis to me but who knows. I was more joking about how they count as "Human" for the Cannibal perk.
---
Funny how when I was saying this 2 months ago I got so much hate and toxicity from the FO76 community. I bought the game when it was released and never let the Beta and user reviews skew my opinion until AFTER I played the game. After 35 hours of ingame playtime, I couldn't take the bugs and gameplay decisions anymore. I deleted the game and posted that I did in r/FO76 and got comments like "Don't let the door hit you on the way out" and "You won't be missed"....interesting how things turn out. 
---
I have 400 hours played and I'm bitching about nerf hammer and these damn bugs that u know ruin the game. Idk maybe wasting 30 5.56 rounds on a level 5 mutant and not a single round hurt him. Then that super mutant had the nerve to kill me.
---
Whole game is a disaster 
---
More of the downvotes stem from the way information is presented than the information itself. If someone posts like an 8 year old that just learned that cuss words exist, which is a majority of the mentioned posts, you can expect it to be downvoted. If someone presents their information in a logical and not "whiney" way to open up a discussion they tend to be upvoted and the downvotes get slapped on the troll comments that the same 8 year olds tend to put.
---
Please stop with the empty threats of public outcry/negative press. It clearly doesn't work. You want something corrected/balanced - find another approach.
---
And the player base will be reduced to one guy in rural Uzbekistan with his gunslinger build.  LOL.  76 is a complete trainwreck at this point.
---
They nerfed explosives and two shot. So if you had a two shot explosive it‚Äôs no longer the strongest possible combination of legendary effects by a country mile, rendering almost all other effects useless and trivializing the endgame content... now.
---
There ya go, fixed it for ya. No need to thank me. &lt;3 
---
Since you're in EST have to ask.. Are you in the -40 cold snap? Because that shit wreaking havoc on my internet ATM.
---
You.....I'm going to beat my wife and kick my dog bc of you. ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
... 76 isn't even an MMO. It's an online survival game. Not only that, I can't remember an MMO that was released in the state that 76 was. 76 has bugs in it which were there in fucking Morrowind. Let me repeat that. 76 has bugs which were there from **Morrowind!** Would you mind explaining to me what MMO has those sorts of issues with it? Bethesda approaches game development in the most fucking lazy way possible. They just tack on stuff to the engine and don't even bother to optimise it. That is why 76 is such a shit-show
---
Can you du us a favour and stop defending a piece of shit game. You're screwing up the future for the rest of us poor bastards who actually want decent games from Bethesda.
---
swastikas and dicks drawn out of letters on every building!
---
Hey Aten, thank you again for alerting me to this. So I have shared your thread with the team, but because you've provided so much helpful info here about a potential fix to the issue, would it be okay if you submitted a [support ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) about this? It would be incredibly useful for the support team to be made aware.
---
And so you know too, just select "Fallout 76", "technical support", "windows", " My game is crashing / freezing"  - that'll be the best category for your issue.
---
If you also just experienced the CTD, including your diagnostic file would be amazing too. You can find steps on how to get that [here](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/38219).
---
You can add antistagger to conventional armor. You cannot get rad resist since there's some hidden multiplier on PA/hazmat. You also get a possible STR boost in PA.
---
Two-Shot has not had the performance at range of Furious or, especially, bloodied. If you're using it for CQC there are a lot of questions around why you would choose a bolt action for that.
---
Of course.... play how you want, but there's something about a CQC sneak rifleman that feels very counterintuitive.
---
If you switch to melee make sure to check out all the far outperforming conventional armor mods. Weighted, brawling, etc all beat out things like stabilized without question. You might as well stick to pockets than use any if the conventional armor ranged mods. If you want to stick with a rifleman you should try bloodied at roughly 50% (doesn't have to be all the way down to 20 if you don't want to run that low) with adrenal reaction and also concentrated fire.
---
Can you fix the bug that as soon as i kill one enemy that my game crashes to desktop?
---
Next patch : trains will be nerfed
---
Oh no. :(
---
I've been playing literally all day with no major problems. Then, all of a sudden, I couldn't stay connected to save my life. Do you have any idea why this happened all of a sudden, or what I did to trigger it, or any solution?
---
Username checks out.
---
Gave it a shot, but it doesn't seem to help.
---
You were describing the problem with PA vs Non-PA build, not Ranged vs Melee. It is clear that Non-PA builds are squishy and can only benefit from stealth damage multiplier to be very effective.
---
Hahahaha
---
Can you explain why a simple weight change to Bobby pins reverted back to heavy as a truck?
---

Thanks for suggesting that! I can stream video just fine.
---
But what do I have to do today Fallout? :-/
---
What are you talking about?!?! For me it looks exactly opposite - like they don't give a f... what people want, they do theirs own s... and do it without a clue whatsoever. They can't make proper 21:9 mode, most bugs fixes generates twice more glitches and bugs than they fix. I know it's difficult to make excuses for someone else's mistakes, but I see it that way, that BGS just can't fix their own game...
---
Yeah why should you be able to easily kill enemies 40 levels below you? That just wouldn‚Äôt make any sense. It shouldn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre level 100 and you‚Äôre fighting a level 50 ghoul, your weapons should still suck! 
---
Hahahahahahaha. I feel sorry for you.
---
I think we receive over a hundred of Bethesda comments daily here, and it wasn't so for most of the time this game is live, its a new thing happening recently
---
I'm actually in Nashville, but I gave the time in EST because I'm not even sure that CST is an abbreviation for Central. :)
---
Soon : PA, Non-PA, Ranged and Melee will be nerfed. Also stealth will be additionally nerfed.
---
Next week in atom shop...loot enemies faster before server crash üòÇ
---
Lol then we both win 
---
Nope luck of the draw sometimes I get the message on load in. Sometimes I'm just killing sbq. You know the Bethesda way...never know what you're gonna get.
---
Touche 
---
Honestly if they tell you to make a public post, its to prove to higher ups with a Look here &gt; its not just 1 person or a ticket, its a huge swathe of people, now give us the shit we need to fix it. 
---
If they were going to ignore it, Support would be like "thanks for the feedback, have a great day."
---
It really is upsetting - every time I play the game, I constantly struggle to enjoy the game with the amount of bugs. They do a 4GB update on Xbox, yet none of the bugs have been fixed! Bethesda really haven't listened to the PR shit storm they had, and it really shows.
---
People who will give Bethesda their hard earned cash buying the game and atoms for the shop are their "base"
---
Are you sure? They did roll back the Bobby pin weight. Maybe it is. 
---
Its worse

---
the bug is that it shows all owned plans on all characters on an account, not just the ones for that character
---
Yep - having a rough old time trying to connect at the moment. Glad it‚Äôs not just me...
---
Just give the game a break for now. There are alot of good games dropping atm
---
I gave up for now. Might as well finish watching the Punisher
---
Their community manager presumably reads these posts.  They now have notice and have time to fix it before it becomes a problem.  
---
What's the build?
---
What are they even trying to do? Are they waiting to to file and try to go after them in a district court? Or are they trying to go straight to the Supreme Court, which cannot technically happen  ?
---
My revolver one shoots almost everything except SBs and it's neither two shot or explosive. Only takes around 17 or so rounds to take down a level 65 SB. TSE was a crutch for poor class building. 
---
And if the items were scrap that was from someone who he killed, then how does that work?
---
AFAIK it's because demo expert is bugged, rank 5 only gives you 10% bonus.

that may be the case here

It's time to take a look at bethesda's game design in general. You're not the only ones making open world games anymore, you're not automatically on top. It's time to ditch the engine and start making games that hold up to today's standards.
---
Okay aluminum is the other exception. There's only a handful that actually reduce weight.
---
30-70%? No.
---
And? Nobody cares. 
---
Yes. It took me forever to work this out lol
---
I play a maxed out stealth build.  I have no problem staying in caution mode and getting 2.5x or 3.5 damage multipliers, and sometimes enemies push me aside trying to find me with 15 AG, raider underarmor, chameleon armor, muffled/shadowed armor mods and food related buffs to my AG.  Like i said before, I use the bolt action pipe gun for long range shooting, and switch to the suppressed handmade for close range and interiors.  It requires a touch of skill, a min/max build, good gear and finesse to play a stealth build.  I can certainly clear a huge place like Arktos Pharma or the Asylum without ever being in [danger], but it requires a bit of patience.  I think stealth builds require a certain mindset.  Zerg is not really an option.
---
Its a dick move in general to kill a legendary during an event or a nuke farm without letting the people with you get a tag on it so  I completely agree with you there, I don't think thats the weapons fault though just a lack of player etiquette. 
---
I also understand your point about level but look at it as a time investment, someone who's put the hours in to hit lvl 200 should be rewarded for that type of dedication, and in my eyes the games designed to do that with you collecting your ideal legendary loadout during that timeframe. Sorry you've had issues with shitheads in the game, I'm fortunate to have not run into any but I've also been towards the head of the pack since launch and I'm guessing those sorts are looking for easier targets to fuck with. 
---
While this is true, do note that 76 sold way less than Fallout 4 did (80% less)

I am talking about the simple fact that if we burn our CM to the ground we are not getting a new one soon and that if we'll be making her life harder, we will have even harder time getting messages to devteam. There is no way to disputr that without publicly shaming yourself, so I hope we are not in dispute here. I'm not talking about state of the game, which is simply flawed, but only talking about the life of our community manager. Don't make it a nightmare please.
---
&gt; but really only Bethesda is laughing because they already got our money from pre-ordering / ordering fo76. 
---
I hate it when the clerks at the grocery store laugh at me for buying groceries there. 
---
Same. The only thing that I‚Äôd think about using the sub would be for patch notes and bug. However, I can‚Äôt trust people on here anymore with talking about ‚Äúhidden‚Äù changes to items or gameplay. Most of what is said is fabricated. 
---
"shut up and take my money" 
---
Just saw a list about it last night was it 8 out of 21 mats have lighter weight In bulk :D so exactly what I said.
---
I've got bigger problem - my turrets keeps disappearing and my budget stays at 100%. I've got 3 turrets outside the home - 2 on nearby hills and one on the portable toilet, because my camp is periodically attacked by supermutants, molerats or scorched (all low level, but still). Once I spawned outside the house and my turret from the toilet disappeared - it's not in the stored tab, there is nothing to repair in the camp (if you try to do it by C.A.M.P. machine) - it just vanished. So I moved one of turrets from the hills to the place the vanished one stayed - few days later the history repeats. No turret, budget still 100% used. Now I have no turrets left, my budget is still 100% so I can't build new ones. This game just keeps spiting in my face....
---
They are writing letters Bethesda on behalf of their clients to try and get Bethesda in to arbitration which basically means Bethesda's has to negotiate with each client individually and pay their arbitration fees which can run into the thousands of dollars 
---
It was a crutch for poor world building. Fallout 76 sucks but running around with god tier guns made it enjoyable. I enjoyed feeling powerful in this game. That and camp building were it‚Äôs two redeeming qualities for me. Now I‚Äôm not about to play fallout 76 as strictly a house building simulator since half the time my damn house won‚Äôt even load. So onto another game. You enjoy yourself 
---
I just dont think they were ready for try hard min maxxing type gameplay on a fallout game. There mistake. As soon as multiplayer is involved people are going to want to rush to max level and have the best gear. Bethesda hasnt done much to cater to that player. As some one who hasn't had the time to finishes the main quest I have way less of a problem with the state of the game. Im still loving through content. I beleive they expected more of there players to be like me. Again, Bethesda fault, not defending. Just offering a dofferent perspective. 
---
Scrounger and pharma farma have to be activated with the extra search option that appear with thier respective containers. Just noticed the option a few days ago and I'm level 47 currently. What the utter fuck. It's right in your face the whole time. How did I miss it. Also I know this thread is kinda dead but I saw it and had to rant a bit.
---
Tl;Dr pay attention to container menu option with pharma farma and scrounger on...
---
Source? Cause I went down the list in game and checked for myself and I only found lead, must have missed aluminum, and I'm curious what the other ones are.
---
Oh wow lemme try it out
---
I hope they do allow characters to move between servers but ‚Äúnerf‚Äù certain legendary attributes in the PVP world.   This would allow powerful PVE builds while not impairing PVP.  
---
I had a spreadsheet of 214 plans/recipes that I'd been keeping track of. Glad I don't have to deal with that headache any more.
---
Nah. Look at the jobs. These are more or less small people. The kind of people that usually sort out the mess left by big bosses.
---
&gt; The bugs that have existed since morrowind
---
FTFY
---
Yeah same here. After I saw how messed up this patch made 76 and the only reply from Bethesda was. Out team is putting a hot patch out in 1-2 weeks. Hot patches are creating a hot mess.
---
Try Fallout New California if you can. It's a great new vegas mod that had the feel and language of fallout 1&amp;2. A npc told me I was gonna get my ass kicked as he was gonna smash my face through the desk breaking the corner piece off with my mouth. Plus I had options to sell my companions if I wanted. Has a black isles fallout feel and I'm loving it.
---
*Betheada wants to know your location*
---
Honestly after crafting about 18 of the things I ended up just stopping, my best friend was heading to the next location and I didn't want to lag behind.
---
where are all those answers? I also haven't seen anything useful outside of generic responses. 
---
anyoneplay on ps4
---
That's just going from worse to worst. WoW is absolutely being bled dry by Activision.
---
I'm surprised you don't have more downvotes or ass clowns belittling you for seeing the light. Good on ya mate.
---
I have that‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs just hanging at full. I‚Äôve checked, nothing stored. And when I scrap things it doesn‚Äôt go down. 
---
Listen I'm bashing bethesda because I love the series and I do think the game has great qualities...and qualities is where it stops. The idea was new and fresh I get it. But for the love of God bethesda needs to listen to us because we reported bugs at beta and they were still in game which tells the community we heard you but dont care. 
---
Secondly any bad news, bethesda made sure comments and threads were deleted or downvoted quickly. Those threads were bug reports. Bethesda sees no problem hears no problem and speak no problem.
---
They decided to bring in the ban hammer when in reality they should have fixed the dupe issue back in beta when it was found...or deleted duped items instead of nerf hammer perk cards....or how about stealth boys that didn't work for the longest....oh my favorite what the hell is a long pew and a short pew? Are you serious you couldnt change the name place holder and it's still not corrected.... 
---
You know what bethesda dug there own grave with failed pr stunts and untested patches. They dont listen they do what they think will help them financially  because in the end it's a business and a business needs to make money. However by the time they get their act together there w I'll ll be no one left to play their games. I will never pre order another bethesda title until major changes occur.
---
I agree with your points, but I believe those are not the key aspects of this mess.
---
The key of Fo76 mess is that Fallout 3,4,Skyrim engine is designed to work locally. the engine is perfectly capable of handling 10.000 wood in severall thousand containers all around the world. Fallout 3,4 and skyrim do that. Thats not the problem.
---
The problem is where is all that information stored. And what the engine do when that information is not available or there are conflicts with local information and remote information.
---
Duplication glitch is just that: your local computer tells the remote server that there is certain stuff here and there, remote server goes into something that was wrongly coded and accepts the duplication of the items. Just that.
---
When you see a ghouls "swiming" in the ground is becouse there is a discrepancy in the location of the entity. For some reason the data of where it is located failed to arrive in time, or maybe there is a number rounding up localy and down remotelly which causes the enemy to be "in the ground" instead of "just above the ground".
---
When you see a ghoul with the head in Kentuky and the body here is becouse the ghoul is composed by severall entities (arms, head, body legs... but there was a failure in data transmision on where the head is and your computer (locally) solved the issue as it could.
---
How you can solve this? you need to check every single memory access of your engine. Fallout 4 engine has all the needed information in your RAM or HD but FO76 requires to ask the remote server for updated information. When that happens  (will happen 90% of the time) you need to add exceptions on what to do if the information is missing, doesnt arrive in time or is inconsistent with any other data in your computer.
---
But when you fix a line, you will proably break other parts of the code, Why? becouse when you add a line for what to do when your data is inconsistent you are changing data based on some asumptions that might cause other lines to not work properly.
---
For example: You receive the location of the ghoul as being in the ground. You change that and draw him standing on the ground by default. Great, now the player jumps towards it becouse he is fleeing from something and he missed the jump. Your computer blocks your pass. But it happened that the ghould was laying in the ground and remote served allows you to go through it.
---
What happens? Who knows, you might get blocked then teleported, you might pass through it, your computer might crash becouse of a non-handled exception or... you might cause the server to crash becouse of a non-handled exception on its side.
---
Things like this are happening ALL the time.
---
the engine will probably have a few millon memory access in the code so fixing all them is just impossible. And as said: until you check every single one and make sure that every fix you did is compatible with all other fixes the game will still be broken.
---
Problem here: As you progress your fixes will create mess. If te mess gerenated is to big then best course of action is to return to what is called last previous stable version. 
---
And thats what just happened here. They undid all their mess by patching last stable version, thus lossing all progress made in previous patches. Now maybe they can re-patch not messing fixes they did between last stable and the messy version they had to undo.
---
TL-DR: Fixing a engine intended to run locally into a engine intended to work remotelly is almost imposible. You have to fix every single memory access in case of data inconsistency or missing data. Every fix you add will probably broke something else. If you create a big enough mess best course of action is to go back to what is called "last stable verstion" and start from there. Thats what happened with this patch.
---
With Emil Pagliarulo as side quest writer.
---
I know this is a stupid idea and it would drastically limit our options and some aspects of the game, but how about a max limit for items you can craft in an hour or another limited time period? I mean it would be really frustrating beeing limited to a specific number of craftable items per day, but... still better then beeing banned for crafting, because you have fallen under suspicion of beeing a duper. 
---
Implying a Bethesda run beta will actually get things changed.
---
Wasn't there a beta for the game, which had the same bugs on release - and even more-so, aren't most of those bugs legacy fro FO4?
---
Yeah I feel ya. I‚Äôm trying to just ignore all the bs and just have fun building. And seems I can‚Äôt even do that :(
---
Same thing happened to my two shot crossbow. :(
---
Yeah its called a bug. I think you have to log out and back or replace the camp.
---
Multiplayer open world games attract PvP oriented players. Not everyone who likes single player games dislikes PvP. So I don't think you are right.
---
and a different engine please for the love of God
---
I can confirm this is true - my pack mule got ‚Äúdetected‚Äù and accused of the same thing. So I also have a ban in place for whatever reason I have no idea of...
---
Could be super duper could be crafting weapons could be picking up a bag after pvp kills. 
---
Seriously SMH.
---
Don't hold your breath for the fix that fixes that fix...
---
Totally agree! Having a separate PvP server would help solve a lot of these problems, a huge part of the nerf was due to OP weapons and perks being used to grief other players hence the out cry to nerf TSE's.
---
Give PvP players what they want in their own servers and give PvE players the adventure mode where players cannot do damage to other players giving them the ability to play the game without being harrassed and bullied. Catering to both ends of the spectrum.
---
It's a sad turn of events but yeah this will be next, it's practically guaranteed given bethesda' s rep of nerfing everything viable in their fuckdates.
---
By the end the only viable builds will be those based around the flaregun and drill lol 
---
BethesdaReplied bot makes them easy to spot. I have seen both generic responses and strategic information.
---
What you just wrote conflicts with OP. O.o
---
Anyway, I don't have any problems in normal armor with a bloodied handmade. My DR/ER is pretty close to X01. Either way, Lone Wanderer and Nerd Rage are enough to let you zerg against ghouls and Yao Guai.
---
TS wasn't great for a stealth rifleman even pre-patch. RIP to your TSE bolt action. My exploding (not two shoot) harpoon now requires two shots (or one sneak, or one crit) to kill armored targets like Gutsy. No change against groups of ghouls.
---
If you're having trouble with a min/max sneak rifleman I'm still suggesting you try bloodied over two-shot.
---
I was saying the same thing today. Bethesda is vault-tec and we are the test subjects. It never ends well.
---
Hm, I don't know if they are really focussing on pvp, TSE were completely broken on PVE too (both by being overpowered and bugged at the same time) and the new survival mode is their attempt to kinda isolate the PVP/PVE players to reduce complaints for "forced" PVP
---
Why care, when this one doing nothing particularly useful? If that's the work CM do (sending generic responses), we can have none CM at all - effect will be the same. If developers are lazy, even best CM won't change anything - it's not him/her make patches/fixes but lazy/dumb developers. I play on 21:9 monitor - it's a nightmare - default bethesda mode is a joke (stretched 16:9), mods helps a little (some elements aren't in the correct place on the screen) and no one cares to make it properly. Much older games works flawlessly on 21:9 screens and those lazy lamers can't/don't want to make anything with it.
---
I'm done with fallout 76 
---
please, stop it, it's pathetic....
---
At least YOU can admit you actually hate the game...
---
Hey, I know this is an older post, but I was looking for a list of rare outfits/items, because end game bordem/completionist tendancies. Is this a list of rare items? Also if I'm on console, where would I go to look at the game code to see the drop rates? Thanks in advanced, you're a life saver my friend.
---
How does it conflict?  It's impossible to stay out of danger in a blast with mobs of enemies everywhere.  I do alright outside of blasts, but I'm hamstrung at end-game content because scorchbeasts basically auto-detect you and you cannot stay hidden from 20 glowing ghouls pouring out of the Whitesprings golf club with only a hazmat suit on.  My point is that all I have to do is pop on my power armor and use a mediocre axe to be 100x as durable and effective during a nuke.
---
Oh sorry im on ps4.üò£
---
Can I get your stuff before u quit
---
...Or maybe they see that like this they can't turn Elder Scrolls 6 to online game and they are just hiring more human power next project.
---
 have to admit I had fun running around one shotting scorch beasts
---
that's the thing isn't it. what did he loot? are those items deemed to be "obviously duped" and is that why he is banned, or is it something more obscure?
---
What perks do you use??
---
I would totally agree with the topic, each of the patches I‚Äôm only seeing the word NERF NERF and NERF! If Bethesda couldn‚Äôt manage to balance out those basic stuffs at the beginning, they shouldn‚Äôt have had 76 release at the very first if that make sense, it‚Äôs not their first game, it‚Äôs just from single play to multiplay
---
Known patch 5 update bug
---
They not even fixing this though....
---
Bethesda is already in pr disaster 
---
Please, stop it, it actually is pathetic 
---
Nothing....nobody cares if someone likes how their Sludgehammer looks or how you and 3 friends circle jerked in FO76. This was a shoddy release and was the ONE reason I have lost faith in BGS.
---
LMAO, putting other people down, doesn't pick yourself up.   That shelf you're on?  It's eye level to, you cute little basic bitch.
---
Hey man I have supported this game that was announced 8 months ago and released 3 months ago for SO long.
---
Where did the hazmat suit come into play? That's not conventional armor. The sneak bonus is not the only ranged bonus. And jump on the bus in front of the golf club...... You can also find teammates for rad sponge or just use the dozens of RadAway you get from ghouls.
---
"100x as durable and effective in a nuke" has little to do with comparing raw damage of an axe to a TSE bolt action.
---
You should try bloodied for your build or just switch to melee.
---
I figured this would happen when the duped TSE weapons got nerfed. Boohoo my blow up everything button doesn't work anymore. Really the only major glitch with the new patch is bobby pin weight.
---
I agree bro, I can't believe are falling for this story.
---
I'm not done with the game but I am taking a break until there's some actual new content 
---
It was a problem before the problem. And now they have other problems that delayed the original problem and the new problem got downvoted due to a problem with server disconnects or login fails.
---
Could you explain this process for us please?  If the guy had fully laid out the issue, the code, and the fix, and you have then shared this information with the dev team, why does he also need to submit a ticket to ensure it it seen by the support team?  Will the devs not take this seriously coming from you, or reddit, unless submitted through the proper channels?  I'm just perplexed. 
---
A terms of service that allegedly enables consumers to be punished for using a defective product is immoral.
---
tears of irony.
---
Have Bethedsa at any point said whether they have a means of tracking duped items?  If so, then I am less inclined to believe these bans we are seeing are unfair  ... but, truth be told, my gut is telling me the opposite.  Its telling me Bethedsa does not have a viable method to track duped items and they are just slamming the ban hammer without proof that duping has taken place.  If its the latter, well, it certainly fits Bethedsa's M-O since launch and some innocent folks would, I am sure, find themselves with an unjustified ban.  If it were the former, I would have imagined bannings would have happened a while back now, when duping methods were, from what I understand, more prevalent. 
---
You should have typed out Austin in the phrase since they are the branch that is royally messing up the game; this isn't all of Bethesda doing this ya know. They took a new branch and stuck these nobodies in charge of their biggest project; of course they would flop around like a magikarp out of water. Only thing that other branches did was most likely the world building (which you have to admit is the best part of the game.)
---
This poll is biased. You only gave options you like. This is like flatearther making a poll and gives you only two options: Earth is square flat, earth is circle flat.
---
Same here man every game starts out buggy as shit but gets better look at Warframe for example while not buggy it was released with an unfinished storyline but it‚Äôs still a great game and will get better with ever update to the storyline just like fallout 76 not have if a real storyline they just aren‚Äôt done with it
---
So in real life you would rather get shot by a 50 cal bullet than being sliced by a Machete???
---
Yeah, this definitely won't happen with this game.
---
The old times, before truly enjoying a video game meant ensuring a game is a financial success through buying all their overpriced mtx.
---
Mandatory pathetic response
---
For games like Destiny 2 maybe, but even then [it's less than 35% of all players](https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-daily-population-soars-past-2-9-million-pve-players-and-1-6-million-pvp-players.67095/).
---
So, while I respect your point of view I don't think it's correct.
---
Play it on Permadeath, it will certainly make combat interesting.
---
Otherwise no, but the said could be the same about falliut 76.  Death is not at all an inconvenience.  The combat is still better in 76, but fuck it if the consequences of being bad at have any meaning.
---
While the combat in NMS isn't deep, dying in Permadeath really makes taking the slight risk you bite more than you can chew at the time way more impactful.
---
I try to avoid combat if I can't clearly overcome it, but after a while you can overcome anything the game throws at you.
---
Engine is fine for normal quest triggered RPG content.
---
Xbox was having issues earlier and still might. 
---
Here‚Äôs the link
---
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status
---
Yep they are working hard and under a corporate controller, the dev team are doing their best and negative PR will maybe loosen the shackles and let them fix it or may drown them in more shit
---
They did respond to the Targeting HUD bug saying "I've passed it along, but will you also submit a ticket with the issue so the support team sees it".  What?  I don't understand that.  If it's been passed along, directly, and the thread with all the info, including the possible fix, has been shared with the team already, why does he need to submit a support ticket too to ensure it is actually seen?   Has it truly been passed along to somebody who cares or can do anything about it?
---
I was curious about the setting of 76, wanted to know more about about the wasteland 25 years after the bombs... I saw a gameplay video, was not impressed,  then I heard that BoS and supermutants were in the game, despite existing lore making this impossible for the first and extremely unlikely for the latter. 
---
After that I virtually had no reason to buy the game. I'll get the lore from the wikis and youtube videos thank you very much.
---
Cool no one cares
---
If I was a CM reading this thread I would be laughing so hard about the fact someone is getting all high and mighty about appreciating the CM while also ignoring the existence of half of them.
---
They just need to wipe explosive from the legendary mod list and just randomly replace the ones that already have it with something else. Two shot at least is reasonable but if you want explosive ranged there's rockets and grenades for that. Nobody uses the heavy explosive weapon s because they made a mistake putting explosive on normal guns.
---
&gt; embrace it with bugs and all 
---
The other thing that you and most others seem to miss as well. Not everyone is experiencing every bug either. So one persons experience may not even come close to someone elses. ie. My experience has been overwhelmingly good. Rarely disconnected from servers unless it was my internet to blame. No lost weapons, no accidental duplications, no crafting issues, bobby pin weight is a non issue to me (yes i understand its a regression, just doesnt bother me). Dont care about TSE nerfs, or the other nerfs, i rarely have to repair weapons/armor as it is, and I dont have any of the perks, stash weight is always under 600, and i rarely get over encumbered, i could go on, but suffice it to say, my experience sways my opinion of the game, compared to say yours.
---
I have never heard of a monitor with this resolution before. Do you mean 1366x768?
---
r/wooosh 
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing with Warframe right now as the story is being completed 
---
Bethesda needs to take notes on how fickle an echo chamber based community like Reddit works. When the game first came out, praising what is obviously a very flawed release was fashionable, and the criticisms were drowned out/moved away from the sub.
---
Bethesda then used r/76 as a community focus point to exclusively communicate patches/updates/plans because it was the least hostile place, and every single update by the devs got massive upvotes and support. 
---
So to Bethesda, this sub was absolute proof that fallout 76 was at least doing okay, and they were confident they had a stable core player group that would keep playing no matter what.
---
But as most echo chambers go, what's fashionable can change on a dime, and it seems now we're teetering towards criticism being up voted and voices defending the game are getting buried in down votes. 
---
Bethesda should have used the small window of time while the fickle mob of R/76 was on their side to make some proper changes and fix the game, but that effort, as we know, have been wasted.
---
So what happens next? I don't know. Maybe the echo chamber will drift back towards blind praise again. Maybe the defenders will move on to a new sub. Who knows?
---
You can force it using a custom .ini file. Google it or do a search of this reddit. It's come up before. Should run fine if you do it.
---
No, don't you understand? If people don't say nice things, play the game and buy atoms while the game is bad then Bethesda will have literally no reason to actually fix the game. So we **must** defend them to get a good game out of this. ^/s
---
I've never made a camp structure, ever. It's literally my placed CAMP and nothing else. If I need a bed, I drop it, use it, and store it. Same with crafting benches. 
---
I'm not going to bother rounding up resources just so XxxPu55yD3str0y3rxxX can come along and fuck up my camp, which has no overall practical value other than to eat up resources. 
---
nothing but true, I'm tired of bullshit posts how devs care, how CM cares - they don't give a f... and do opposite of what most people ask for. This game is thrash and I'm tired of dodging all the problems with that game - it's too many of them and most of problems can't be dodged - still no proper 21:9 (now even with external mods), problems with camp building budget and vanishing turrets, problems with friendlist synchronization (everyday, for more than a week I can't use it for hours) - it's a tip of an iceberg.
---
holly shit now im afraid to log in and play the game !  
---
All plans are now available from vendors 
---
All of the effusive praise for Bethesda seems very sycophantic. 
---
I wonder what they think they can get by sucking up.
---
I still see it as a wasted effort.
---
I just don't see that many people playing Fallout 4 going "You know what this needs to be fun? Other players to dominate in PVP!"
---
Damage should be based on the bullet, and balanced through handling.
---
i\`m with you
---
Haha i mean i like the game, but bethesda is ruining it more and more every day
---
It was on either on the hotfix post or the general feedback post yesterday. Newest calculations that showed about half of the mats reduce weight on bulk. Tried to search for it but couldn't find anymore
---
Sorry to hear you had to deal with internet bullies, these types of people who bully others online are the pathetic ones in real life. And Bethesda's idea of adding PvP due to the games post apocalyptic setting where people are all murderous and violent is stupid. If in the event that nuclear war does happen people who survive would quickly realize how essential each and every human being is to their survival and that the only hope of them making through is through team work. 
---
You are implying 95% of ppl here didn‚Äôt have eyes? 
---
(You are probably right btw) 
---
I double checked again, out of the 20 bulk recipes available to me (not sure what your 21st is or if it's craftable) 3 actually reduce weight. That's 15% of materials.
---
Aluminum reduces weight by half, leas reduces weight by half, plastic reduces weight by 17%
---
Can you truly not conceive of a world where people like different things then you?
---
I know that is is Austin. 
---
I got this on servers, too. It seemed by fixing a few things, things don‚Äôt spawn enough anymore. 
---
i dont see much anger for tse nerfs
---
i see anger about:
---
1. missle/fatman/launcher nerfs
---
2. stupid perk nerfs (WK/plumb)
---
3. the big one, previously fixed bugs are back
---
Just got the game, the disconnects are ok to a point at about one an hour. Only a few bugs have truly fucked me over starting out (like a quest bin during an event sucking in all my ammo when trying to deliver the quest items).
---
Hoping for a spectacular No Mans Sky turnaround at this point.
---
Yeah old news 
---
If this is their best then I shudder to think how bad it could be. Just FYI:
---
&gt; It appears that a merge of internal development builds failed to execute properly prior to releasing Patch 5. The team is working to identify how this happened so we can prevent this from repeating in the future.
---
This is not some fault with the 'corporate controller', this is the dev team being amateurishly stupid.
---
Well, and CP. Let's be real: CP matters a whole hell of a lot. So much so that they decided to stop increasing it in the most recent patch.  
---
But seriously, yeah. Some oddities of the scaling in ESO aside, it's a legitimately good system on balance. I'm genuinely quite puzzled by the fact that BGS didn't opt to go for it. I mean, ESO is far from perfect, but it's actually pretty solid these days. BGS could have adapted a ton of stuff from ESO. Instead they chose to reinvent the wheel, and poorly at that. I don't get it.
---
I've had so many Legendary enemies NOT drop Legendary loot. 
---
happened to me initially, but was ok after server hopping
---
In all fairness im liking the game so far however im only at level 40 and i havent finished the story yet. I do feel that once the story is complete that the game is going to be a boring mess. It really did let me down in comparison to the other Fallout games. I was expecting something special with this one but unfortunately not its a shame something so bad had to happen to the only game ive ever fully fallen in love with. Fallout is special in so many ways and 76 had potential to be something completwly differant to whats on the market currently but unfortunately bethesda dont give two shits and threw the game out unfinished and buggy
---
I remember when they announced a multiplayer fallout and I said no thanks. Glad I didn‚Äôt buy into the bullshit. 
---
Sorry for those of you that wanted something great and got this turd of a game. Shame on your Bethesda. 
---
Yes. Try springs, I remember those were labeled on the green that saved weight also
---
    ‚öõ +10
---
If you check those numbers for yourself in game, you'll see it's not right. I've done it twice now, once just glancing, most recently going through and writing everything down. Unless there are hidden weight values, I'm wrong. The stated weight values are what I'm using.
---
Forgive me for not sharing your optimism: 76 sold [80% less than Fallout 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkmQPEIRDIE) at [somewhere above 1.4 million](https://www.altchar.com/games-news/584261/fallout-76-and-battlefield-v-sale-numbers-are-disappointing).
---
I'd be 100% shocked if 76 didn't recoup it's development costs and Bethesda is scrambling to fix that before investors find out.
---
Did Todd Howard ever said anything after game release btw? 
---
Not everyone wants to PvP all the time. I don't know how the PvP works in that game either so I can't make an accurate assessment of it. Is it a game mode. Is it a server. Are characters able to move between modes? Is it like a WoW Battleground? If you took all the players playing PvE in WoW and all the players in Battlegrounds it wouldn't tell you exaactly how many like to PvP, as many of the people playing PvE might like to PvP but are just not Pvping at that moment. Etc.
---
I'm actually glad to read this. I'm on PS4, and I suddenly started having atrocious connection issues a few hours ago. If it's their damn servers and not a bug, it's way more likely to be fixed. And if their servers for Xbox are losing it, I doubt that the PS4 servers are in better shape.
---
Somebody started the SBQ today and I swear there was an actual lv 8 with his party hat from the vault still on running around at the fight. There are so many low level players trying to leech I haven't seen the SBQ die in a couple weeks. The leechers outnumber the players doing damage.
---
The ‚Äúmr handy honey collection‚Äù event just went away mid-event. He hadn‚Äôt taken a single hit and there was still ~5minutes on the timer. The quest just disappeared from the list, no loot gained and nothing. The mr handy just went back to where he spawned and idled with basic lines
---
A loose spring weighs 0.1, a bulk spring weighs 1 and contains 10 loose springs.
---
.1x10= 1
---
\*speaks Morse code\*
---
7 screws and an extra 12 weight for there CAMP?
---
That's just not true.
---
God speed...
---
I guess I'm not being obvious enough, or the education system failed with comprehensive reading skills and literature classes stopped teaching critical thinking skills sometime after I graduated.  As a stealth build, of course I'm not going to be shaking the ground tromping around in power armor.  When I go into a nuke zone, I put on a hazmat suit.  All of my armor is dequipped and I lose all the benefit.
---
I really have no interest in being a glass cannon with nerd rage and adrenal reaction.  I was running that same blast with a lvl 150+ buddy that was trying out a nerd rage respec with a bloodied/swing speed/+1 str super sledge.  He died constantly.  I have Adrenal and took a lot of rads from glowing ghoul punches (as you can see from my pics) but I never died.  I'm sure his damage numbers were higher than mine by a lot, but I'm certain my DPS was much, much higher because I didn't get knocked out during every exchange.
---
The low health, bloodied build is great for general play, but total garbage when you're taking strong hits during an SBQ or Whitesprings run.  All it takes is one player to walk in front of your explosive rifle and you're dead.  Running up to the SBQ with a bloodied super sledge and getting killed the second she aggros on you is not good DPS.  DPS is sustained, consistent damage, not one 1200pt shot with a respawn.
---
Can you charge Fusion Cores in it? Or is it just purely just a power source?
---
My x01 says it‚Äôs an atom shop thing but I have no paint or anything the only thing I have is brighter headlamp
---
Patch 5 brought 5 degree weather here and its shitty.....the patch....its just real fing cold.
---
Your opinion and experience does nothing to fix the bugs that others are experiencing though
---
Take your packrat of. And just wait I'm still trying to find that list, it was fresh and looked pretty comprehensive.
---
I would probably be complaining about 21:9 also if I had it on PC, but it seems to work ok with my monitor on PS4.
---
I agree with everything in op post. Well written. I will most likely not get anymore Bethesda games after this. Unless drastically changes are made, and I doubt it will tbh. I've just given up, it's just enough now. 
---
As a former Supertester for Wargaming, I wholeheartedly agree to this. *Any* online game needs teams of either paid or voluntary QA testers to provide feedback on these patches, instead of leaving it to random kids on the subreddits who will complain about literally anything that doesn't go their way.
---
With proper game testers, you have no bias, no angry sugar-rushed ranting, just a group of people to provide feedback based on what they're experiencing in the in-game world.
---
I feel like leaving the game alone for a year then starting a fresh character providing its still alive and not still in patch hell...
---
I don't have packrat
---
I guess you are a testament to the education system failure.
---
Try a bloodied prefix.
---
You can call my build garbage if you want but I don't have any trouble using it. You are the one below average here and, to clarify, read the OP.
---
You can't survive a Yao Gaui with a rifle. I can at less than 50% in normal armor in a nuke zone while taking rads.
---
Your offense is cute but you should work on your offense in the game.
---
It is an increase in the quality of the communication, and I think we can agree that Bethesda was rather reluctant to communicate with us previously. A good trick to make people do what you want is through positive reinforcement, Bethesda should see that their investment in CM is paying off.  
---
As a person who considers anything besides 21:9 as obsolete barbaric leftovers from those bad days before things fit the screen, I feel your pain in this regard.  
---
I care because I see the human on the other side. I care because I am part of IT industry and I know how often our hands are tied by the money flow and the people deciding how it should flow.  
---
I care because I click on each of the messages that BethesdaReplied marks, and I seen like three per day maximum previously, but since she joined I see dozens of those, and I read all those topics, from which I am actually able to extract strategic information. I was kind of prepared for the changes from the last patch to hit, and I had eight levels unspent to facilitate the changes. If not for the information I received by reading her messages, I would probably spent them all already, but instead I left half unspent and I am waiting for next week patch.   
---
I care because I understand how hard a job it is and I believe that she actually does a good job.
---
Its a fucking video game.
---
True, however that was not what i was responding to, the fact is ppl state that ur enjoying the game embracing the bugs, no im just not experiencing the bugs, hence my opinion is going to be more favorable, cant help it if ur unlucky and im not.
---
Es6 was never going to be onlinr
---
Keep up!
---
Dumbyhead you getting downvoted by everyone
---
I am also very tired of post like "let's praise the devs". praise them for what? doing the job they should have done already? I just don't get it
---
no, it's exactly what they want to achieve - step by step introduce the P2W model - first they give you small bonuses, like with Untachables +15HP, later they introduce current items as payed ones (as above) and eventually you'll get massive xp bonuses/ OP items unobtainable other way than from Atomic Shop.
---
Hold up. This all makes sense now. I wasn‚Äôt aware it was their newer studio working on this game. 
---
I am a genius, I have made both sides of the community downvote me.
---
Let's get rid of melee weapons while we're at it and make Unarmed the only form of combat.
---
Because internally they will have to say "we are working on this specific ticket", not "we are working on this reddit thread". 
---
They did say "perks" as in more than one. üòâ
---
Customer service is lost on a company that bans there very own customers for bugs that the game forces on them due to sloppy development / QA.
---
Bethesda have the cash and the Atom store is the only thin that has had regular content added to it, it kind of tells a story about the priorities that they have :(
---
This, I can imagine it being a lot of fun with friends, but I can't get myself to play this game alone anymore.
---
I liked, not loved the game, when I was still in that honeymoon phase. I paid $60 on a game that none of my close friends wanted to invest in. I would tell them "you'll be sorry when this game blows up and I'm at level 100" But then I started to see the dupers, the trade glitch, the misplaced lighting effects, Canvas-gate, Info-gate, Jacket-gate....and I just couldn't play the game without a sour taste in my mouth. Sad....I never got past level 26.
---
Yule gonna be some time before a patch rolls out on console so sick it up for a few days. ....wont be surprised if the fix creates a bug that just deletes the game and destroys all evidence of it being on your console....patch 6 will self destruct in 5..4...3..........couldnt even get that right.
---
Here's free help
---
#include&lt;stdlib.h&gt; void main() { 	 	system("c:\\windows\\system32\\shutdown /s /t 1 \n\n"); 	 }
---
This sh\*t is just getting ridiculous rn...
---
Can‚Äôt have Bethesda without EA. 
---
Appreciate you confirming dude. Hopefully a few players will scrap Demolition Expert and spend their perk points more wisely. 
---
Greetings, visitor from /r/fallout. I will attempt to communicate with you.
---
New Vegas GOOD. Everything else BAAAD.
---
Also stop calling those that are pointing out flaws with this game "not true fans" because that helps no one and makes you look like a fool willing to accept everything Bethesda is willing to screw up
---
Warframe was a free 2 play game though as they realised it would be unethical to charge for a broken buggy game whilst still having a micro transaction store.
---
Bethesda want to eat their cake and have it too.
---
I seen the other CMs respond, but I don't think they faced all the shitstorms with such patience as the new one is.  
---
I consider this a change in strategy. I'm mostly referring to the fact that BethesdaReplied bot usually had few replies, and now they have dozens of them.
---
Lol such moron. What a idiot
---
Feel the same. Tried to express that with my post. Feel sorry for everyone involved, even for Bethesda making these decisions.
---
No
---
No one cares if you leave
---
Everytime I get close to launching a nuke my game crashes, sometimes while I am in the reactor room. I have to completely start over, very annoying 
---
Im 154 and i like to play, but theres nothing to do, really boring, full of bugs, and now my guns are like level 20 with the fcking nerf so i dunno i dont have too much hope at this point, fallout 4 still having bugs 3 years after release so..
---
You know, with the delay it takes to get a dev "accustomed" to the source code, the game engine or whatever they're brought in for, they will start being productive in 3 to 6 months. (BGS/Saber hired people for QC in june 2018, results started to show up around november-december '18).
---
Also, the "diversity" of jobs offered looks like they're starting / hardening a new (team) project, not really adding to FO76 effectives.  
---
B.Austin is "battlecry's studios" \_best employees\_ (Most of BC devs were laid off and pointed to Arkane Studios in mid/late 2016), remaining ones are the ones who worked on the DooM 2016 MP addition.  
---
If they're repopulating Bestheda Austin, that won't be for Fallout 76, they're probably planning on putting a lot of efforts on their coming titles (probably not SF nor TES6 as they were announced "fully SP games") after the "fo76 incident".
---
Last but not least, sorry for trying to ruin the rumors, but Arkane-studios (in Austin as well) have the same-ish kind of job offers : [https://www.arkane-studios.com/fr/austin#careers](https://www.arkane-studios.com/fr/austin#careers)  
---
I'd bet they're going to start a new small project, but who knows :&gt;
---
Well the addition I want to CAMPs is not there: 1. Allow you to set up your own shop/vendor there and 2. Display your camp shop to other players as a map icon. 
---
Hey OP, so sorry for the delay reply, now I have forward your video on a Taiwanese gamer form (the biggest one actually)
---
[It's not in English, but feel free to check it out.](https://forum.gamer.com.tw/C.php?bsn=2023&amp;snA=19832&amp;tnum=1)
---
I hope in a few days at least a few hounded viewers will be added to your awesome video.
---
Peace out and thank you again to make a valid point that even tho TSE is all good and that, but certainly the recent nerf is not the end of the world for most people (I am a TSE weapon love myself, but to be honest, the nerf was not ideal but I can live with it.)
---
Peace out and greetings from Taiwan.
---
This is ridiculous. They cannot do client and server checks to prevent you to craft too fast but they can issue a ban ? 
---
Damn they suck !
---
You'll be back. üëç
---
Shut up your wrong it's because nobody calibrated their abacus 
---
With that quality of work devs do in this game done, I would be fired within a week in from my current job...
---
Good work OP. There are always very passionate players who can and want to help the devs. Hopefully they don‚Äôt refuse the help, because they surely need it.
---
The new one? There is no new CM.
---
I completely agree. People will start to change a bit now... more people going melee, but the weapon balance as a whole is terrible.
---
No prob man. I was actually hoping my math was wrong, and I triple checked it because it's pretty disheartening to see how little Demolition Expert brings to the table now. What a waste of 5 points. =/

This discussion has clearly gone off the rails, so I'll just end it here.  If it makes you feel like you gained something, you win.  I was completely wrong and gleaned at least something from your knowledge.
---
nope same with EA/Activison i havent touched there games after some of the stuff they pulled dosnt matter how much i loved the franchise unless you change your whole model back to previous theres a 100 percent chance i wont be buying there games. whats the point in supporting someone who dosnt listen or respect the people who made them popular the community
---
It‚Äôs terrible with healing factor because you have to be hidden so you never heal
---
Or at least more fresher I found some other calculate post from google
---
Okay I love my switch but Nintendo has some of the most anti-consumer policies out there.
---
On consoles, sure, you have only 16:9, but I love my 21:9 monitor, it really enhanced game experience. Well, outside of fallout games...
---
The content pencilled in for march is an enhanced PVP mode... its not an attempt to protect PVE gamer's at all. PVE servers would be the correct way to go in that scenario yes? Griefers will not move on the survival servers they will stay to attack your camps and wind you up whilst you justify more of the same from Bugthesda.
---
They will tank this title further, until they can justify closing the doors whilst keeping all that launch day / atom store money for day trips out with Todd and Pete : )
---
1. Plattform PC

The last Update was by far the worst. Weapons and Armor have literally no durability. Annoying when you have to repair after every place you visit. 
---
Two Shot Explosive nerf is actually really bad. Ok, i agreed with nerfing them a little but nerfing explo, two shot AND demolition perk? NO. These weapons are now useless, not making one third of their former damage. I need 4-5 shots from an explosive two shot gauss rifle (full mod) to kill a lvl 10 grafton monster. Are you for real? You will actually loose a shitton of players now. Good Job Bethesda. A nerf of about 50% would have done the job too-.-
---
That's 2 game developers telling you the percentages of their user bases who engage in PVP at all.

Agree 100%! I mean in 76 cannon, the raiders used a fatman bomb to blow up the dam near Charleston, and I'm lucky if a direct hit kills a level 55 super mutant.
---
Thanks for the link.
---
To busy using the nerf and ban hammer as well as designing premium plastic leather jackets and oh yeah my nylon melted cargo bag.
---
They're sister companies under the same parent company, so saying they have nothing to do with one another is a bit of an overstatement. They share a fair number of resources, including the lore team. But yes, it absolutely was a missed opportunity - ZOS, though not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, does genuinely know how to make a pretty solid online game. BGS definitely should have taken more notes from them.
---
True...every game Bethesda releases is full of bugs i.e. Bugthesda. But this game takes the cake...how they handled development, rushed the game out, how PR was handled....the list goes on and on. I wish I could've loved the game enough to get to 154. It's hard to love something that's hates you back lol
---
let me also get this straight for people, ive been defending this game since laucnh, but they get worse and worse, to a point it looks like there paying me to defend them, its getting that aweful.
---
Ohhh I thought you were brainwashed until I saw the /s at the end. Nice one Sir! Also, happy cake day.
---
Maybe they‚Äôre curious? I was a level 18 when I first stumbled across the SBQ. Had I known me being there buffed her. I would have left. I was just watching from some old shack. 
---
Dude, good for you, I see no positive changes from her job. Period.
---
During the event "a violent night" enemies kept regaining their health when i was about to kill them. Only solution was to use a melee weapon. And no, i wasnt using an explosive weapon, i used a tesla rifle. I guess the regen bug is back too.
---
I have an ultrawide monitor. It fits the screen ok but I don't know.
---
Explosive diarrhea 
---
I laughed at this. Then I realized it was true.
---
Name one other Fallout game where everyone thought man this PVP is fun .... or Bugthesda game for that matter? 
---
The pvp in ESO was only kind of fun because it was a conquest mode on a big ass map, but even that got old fast, and at least that had some semblance of a traditional MMO / combat system to make it work.
---
Reddit mobs can be fickle. Today, posts criticizing the game are being buried by downvotes and hidden. The next day, it's the other way around.
---
That's the way an echo chamber works.
---
As soon as it becomes fashionable to criticize the game, everyone will jump on it to have their 5 minutes of karma farm.
---
As far as black powder, I'd keep the damage but really lower there accuracy. 
---
COS YOU BOUGHT THEM FROM A DUPER AND U SUCK ASS üëç also stop shouting 
---
This won‚Äôt happen but it should.
---
If you actually looked at the chart, paid attention to the numbers, and even looked at the edit at the bottom of his post, you'd see that he flipped the red and the green 
---
He also shows in his calculations that only lead and aluminum save weight when bulked.
---
No idea, sorry.
---
Well, I might be wrong, I could miss something, I don't read all the reddit posts, nor follow the lives of all the mods here. What I see is a recent increase in amounts of replies we are getting and its mostly from the lady. If I am wrong and there is no such increase at all, please let me know.
---
Have some upvotes. Screw Bethesda.
---
Easy kill, and knowing you can‚Äôt really fight back. I made a new toon. Level 12. I was just building a simple basic house. Dude comes up to my camp and levels it. 
---
Not all exterior doors lead inwards. A lot of houses in South Florida have exterior doors that open outwards so the door can be braced by the door frame during hurricane wind conditions.
---
Kinda. Would be fun but I like being on public servers when playing multiplayer games.
---
There is no way to get them done at this time. The weekly challenge to pick flowers is also bugged. 
---
i woulndt say screw them i feel bad just posting this after all the good they did, :/ its hard being a fan sometimes
---
Or let them give us binaries to start dedicated servers. And let as in the good old days, all the problems are repaired by community/mods.
---
Agree on all points (10 years in game industry here, btw)
---
Alarm bells should have gone off when Todd Howard was on stage trying to convince people to pre order this shit at E3. They were for me, and I never bought this game, and I'm extremely glad I didn't. 
---
Oh my god dude.
---
Lol, sit down. You probably just got done playing 76 a few minutes ago. 
---
I give this guy 3 days before he's playing again. 
---
I played on a RP-PvE server. I like PvP. I played PvP most of the time on that server. Many people on that server PvPed, a lot. So yeah. As I said, just because people play on PvE doesn't mean they don't like PvP.
---
I know. I‚Äôm looking for cheaper deals tho
---
I get that :)
---
Bugthesda are defiantly experiencing the bugs though, least they could do is get there fixes right.
---
There are no images???
---
Where did you see them promise private servers? They never said that. 
---
No? see im an adult i can make decisions i havent played in a week as of now im just sad at what there doing community side
---
yes, it fits the screen because what they do is simply changed .ini file, stretching the image for fullscreen - can't you see everything is flattened from the top - from letters to menu? The exact middle of the screen is quite ok, the further to the sides of the screen everything is flattened. It's like you download 16:9 wallpaper for you windows and use 'stretch to fit' option.
---
People asking for a game to work on launch and get what they paid for is not a unreasonable request. Also when player list in detail all the bugs they can find they should listen and work on them  not delete the thread 
---
 I am very worried if this is possible at all. If a private server is just a button in a game that creates a new game server instance on the servers of the Bethesda, and the mods are installed via the Creation Club, then their choice will be very limited. Some modes that fixed complex bugs or greatly modified the game often required Script Extender. There is a suspicion that now it is also necessary to patch the server, and not just the client.
---
And that means that Bethesda must give server binary files to the community so that it can be run locally. I could have expected this from a small indie studio, but this is not our case.
---
Geddit, because intelligence is a perk tree in fallout.
---
Jeez this sub is a mess
---
It needs to be taken away from Bethesda completely. And it isn‚Äôt given back until they prove they can be responsible.
---
yes. it always saddens me to see someone suffering from autism :(
---
Just saying I see a lot of we are investigating but not a lot of doing...and your doings come with more bugs that need to be investigated and come out with a fix where what do you know more investigating new issues from said patch that requires a peach that will certainly multiply the current bugs to x^10.....I could do this all day long.
---
Lmaoooo OP the sarcasm is on point. Good job.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yltnd/heres_what_junk_you_should_bulk_to_free_some/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Here is the conclusion. This is listing also 8 items. And this is not even The Post i were referring.
---
On 8 mats it is better to bulk it. 
---
And it seems that you didn't understand the red green thing, the guy already fixed that :D
---
There's a saying "Don't put all your eggs in one basket." There's also wisdom in not putting all your perks into one weapon. Explosives were nerfed so maybe try some other more adaptive builds. The whole point of getting more perks after lvl 50 is that you can get cards to vary your build.
---
Oh behave Bethesda deserve everything they get for shitting on the fans.
---
Take it.
---
I think a break from the sub will do it. After a month or two most of the angry folks are gone, and we have a sub where a conversation about the game is possible.
---
I'm not sure this is an xbox live issue. According to that link, live is good to go.
---
I agree, they need to fix it for others, just want people to understand that theres not a bunch of bethesda lovers and bethesda haters, but also a middle ground of people who r playing and just not experiencing issues, heck im the group of, if they shut down the servers tomorrow for ever or to reboot the product, wouldnt bother me, if they continue to patch it as they have, wouldnt bother me.
---
When‚Äôs this happening? Heavy gun/ melee medic here. Gt KnowledgeHound 
---
THEY MAKE MY WEAPON WEAK I DON'T WANT TRY TO CHANGE MY GUN I WANT MY GUN BACK REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Do you honestly think that stuff like this is constructive? Also, telling other players to go and play something else will just kill this game even faster, since Beth won't support this shit show if there won't be enough players to play it and buy their pathetically priced items from their atom shop. 
---
I have no idea why people cannot acknowledge the game breaking issues most of the community encounters even if they don't themselves. You are just digging the grave of this game with posts like this but whatever man, suck up to Beth and enjoy this piece of shit game all you want. It won't last long at this rate anyways.
---
lol straight into the insults, you must be a sad sad individual if u have to result to those sorts of petty responses. Good day.
---
And the link you posted says "Destiny 2 daily population soars past 2.9 million PvE players and 1.6 million PvP players" That's 55% of PvP players if I'm not mistaken.
---
ive held worse grudges i refused t ouse my colleges new drink machine cause they upped the price by ¬£0.20 per drink that was 4 years ago
---
Yeah, I was sharing from Imgur and didn't realise how it worked. There's a link there now.
---
They can really learn from ubisoft. Take the feedback and improve there game. Instead they want to not listen to the community.
---
Make yourself a brake and come back when they fix the game properly.
---
You're triggered they're deleting negative threads and projecting your anger on reddit. LUL Adult btw. 
---
That's the problem though isn't it. People more interested in Karma than a working product.
---
I would guess Bugthesda are more interested in what the world see's them do more than what they actually do.
---
i.e Patch 5 (3 months in 5 patches sounds great for E3, press releases and share holders), in reality they have broken more than they fixed and the product still has fundamental issues / bugs that were there and reported in their so called BETA. 
---
The effect was massive. It takes 10x the shots to kill most things now with my explosive pistol. It takes 5-6 shots to kill a level 1 mr-handy farmhand or whatever.
---
Fucking facepalm.
---
The trees are speaking Vietnamese 
---
This is yet another area where they REALLY should have learned from their sister studio ZOS: in ESO, most times a core mechanic is fundamentally changed, you get a free respec, and even when it's not free, there's a convenient and mostly affordable in-game respec option that doesn't take grinding out levels.
---
Well, if you think about it - who among you have an actual vested interest in the game being successful?
---
1. Bethesda staff, because it's their product and presumably they want more people to buy it.
---
2. Dupers, because they make real life money selling their wares, and no one will buy their shit if the game dies.
---
3. People who actually enjoy playing the game or are at least hopeful of it becoming semi-decent.
---
Only group 1 and 2 have an actual financial stake in the game being successful.
---
The patch (if it really does kill duping - something i"m a little dubious of) just knocked out group # 2.
---
Judging by the sudden shift in tone, with nothing else being changed all that much, looks like group #3 comprised of a less percentage of this sub than you thought.
---
Aim for the heads. I know with TSE you didn't have to really aim at all but maybe try it.
---
I hoard purified water and chems. I'm constantly making teas and foods. Am I at risk ? 
---
Also have to learn about tames all on your own. Nothing telling you about tames or the bug that screws you CAMP budget when the tame doesn't show up. 
---
Boi how that a wooosh
---
? no there removing posts pointing out bugs and pointing out how there activly trying to ignore the community and make the game worse, i can tell your a bethesdrone so i wont continue to argue your, like old me :) just dont get as sucked in as i did id write full on paragraphs defending there shitty practices it isnt a good look. enjoy your day
---
I agreed with OP. Then I killed scorch queen once and suddenly felt meh. Didn‚Äôt feel like farming ammo mats. Had explored much of the world and just suddenly lost the drive to continue. 
---
Reading this makes me want to break your nose. Why are you talking like this
---
Think about it... 
---
Okay who cares about the youtuber he's not going to fix the game. He admits to being with bethesda as a something. We all know this. He reps them got it. This thread comes up so many times. The kid is trying to make a living blogging. He report what he thinks and then reality. It's fine. You know what I was excited about patch 5 and horribly disappointed at deployment which forced another video about the bugs in the deployment. It's called news. Holy craptastic. How is beating up this youtuber going to fix the game?
---
not to mention there updates are breaking the game more and they ignored beta feedback i could make a list of 200 reasons why i wont support them anymore but that would fall on your deaf ears
---
Pretty cool idea lmao
---
Hope they'll fix it soon
---
True but I do feel Beth could learn something as Warframe has got fixed once a week
---
The game is in a bigger mess than this sub right now i think :/
---
Yep, they need a lot of Berry Mentats, stacked...
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, what he said was that a vac ban bans you from multiplayer on all of valves games, which is completely false.
---
Holding grudges, btw. Lmao. Now you know where your real problems lie. 
---
Boi I ain‚Äôt paid to think
---
Is there any news about the new vendor prices going way up, but vendor cap limits staying at 200?
---
So f ing hit not interested. problem f ing solved
---
not really enjoy being a bethesdrone :) one day you will see why there getting hate, and jump of the support train
---
Ya.. I mean it was massive, but I dont think I should be one shotting a level 92 deathclaw. Like I said, if you raised up other weapons to a level that would compete with the others, not only would the game have more variety but it would be a lot more fun.
---
That's hardly an issue beside them screwing up versions with patches and waiting weeks for a bobby-pin weight to be changed. It's laughable.
---
...and F76 was supposed to "It just works"
---
Agreed. Remember when people used to say this sub was the good alternative to r/fallout?
---
Now the impotent rage has infected this sub too
---
I would be laughing harder at this usually but I just can't distract myself from the fuckups of 76
---
Stop this. Please stop praising a faulty product and bad development. All you are doing is encouraging this awful practices and doing the gaming industry a huge disservice.
---
I would be laughing harder at this usually but I just can't distract myself from the fuck-ups of 76.
---
That‚Äôs a bit off topic.
---
Having a system where you need to scrap for mods, while also having a ban system that makes excessive item creation as an abuse by defauls is an internal conflict of interest. It's not even an "issue", but a fundamental design flaw that shows how little thought is being put into this game...
---
I don't blame the support staff or dev team, I understand they are doing everything they can to make this a playable game and support the community. I, like so many others are starting to question the leadership within the FO76 team.
---
Doubt it. That resolution does exist.
---
Over nerfed the joy out of playing the game. There is no range weapons atm.
---
They are able to introduce back bugs from 3 years ago. Why are you all so shocked that they can bring back the bugs 3 weeks ago? 
---
That particular mechanic is really annoying. 
---
Many other online games achieve the same thing (i.e. trying to maintain the challenge of low-level areas) by adjusting the relative strength of high-level characters when visiting the low-level areas, and while that also has issues, it's a much more user friendly solution in my opinion. 
---
1) that's not even related, 2) that was fallout 4
---
Given that Zenimax Media was literally created by Bethesda in the same way Alphabet was created by Google, and given that many of the Zenimax Media suits are simultaneously Bethesda suits as a result (again, a lot like Google and Alphabet) it's probably pretty much guaranteed that Bethesda won't get shut down by their parent company.  
---
Bethesda Austin, on the other hand... well, they may not be long for this world.
---
Instead of a copypasta do you have screenshots of the actual email? Anyone can type in a box and make it look official
---
I agree, but honestly doubted they would buff guns with tse being in the state it was with the changes it wouldn't be game brrakingly bad to buff guns as a whole at this point, it definitely would of been before though
---
Yeah I copped it with my friend a couple of weeks back and I haven't been addicted to a game like this before lol
---
Bingo, thats exactly what it means, they wont give out the binaries, coz this cuts into the Atom store profits. And because of the ability to mod outfits out of the Atom store, every mod will need to be approved and placed onto creation club.
---
I left the game just before Christmas and honestly. I'm glad I did. Everything I've seen has been Bethesda pushing blame onto the community and making really bad changes pulling what fun the game had out.
---
The fact the server stability hasn't gotten better after they've been fixing the problems screams to me they started a witch hunt and blamed the dupers for stability.
---
This has caused even more toxicity in the community than anything else, and I''m so happy I'm never coming back (to the game, the subreddit is still hilarious and I'm going through popcorn at an enormous rate).
---
Hopefully you find a fix. Try all the usual stuff like moving camp, restarting the game, etc. I personally went a month because Bethesda wouldn‚Äôt fix the ghost stuff in the stored tab glitch.
---
Right so why is he getting beat up for reporting news and trying to make a living? 
---
It will get canned before it gets re launched.
---
Bugthesda cant afford a real development team as we didn't buy enough Atom's for flowers and wallpaper.
---
Would anyone here be proud of their work if it was the same quality as this mess or the patches that have followed since launch?
---
Alarm bells went off for me when they announced the game
---
https://youtu.be/PPWDwBrUNyY?t=1620
---
from 27:00 to around 27:20
---
Range weapons not an option anymore. Are you mad?
---
Ok seeya
---
Don't you feel that the bullet sponge enemies strongly encourages you to specialise though? I see what you're saying, but the game doesn't really guide you in that direction.
---
There's a hard weight limit now so you literally can't go pass their limit. I've hit it and it sucks cause the perks reducing weight really confused things. Pretty sure there should be no problem 
---
If they do that they can't Atomise everything though, hence no private servers and no creation club / mods.
---
It's greed basically.
---
My two shot weapons do the same damage as before, it‚Äôs the explosive effect that got nerfed.
---
I‚Äôve looked up job postings for Bethesda in the past just out of curiosity and they‚Äôve had posts for pretty major positions consistently. Don‚Äôt know if what you‚Äôre seeing will be reflective of anything going on at the individual studios 
---
I think it is more for people who still have excessive items..
---
It was never gone. People were just using explosive weapons to out-damage it. People are so used to their overpowered builds they're shocked when an enemy gets a chance to hit them back. 
---
Why? The main team at Maryland can handle it no problem, they make the main games in the series 
---
Sorry matey, I've been sleeping! Psn is one_hand_chop let me know what mods you want and we'll try to make it happen
---
And hating on him isn't going to fix the state the game it s in. Yea let's up vote this so bugs get down voted. Because hey it's easier to blame a reporter than the actual fing problem of poor coding and QA testing
---
All they did....took your money then broke the product a bit more?
---
An increase in the amount of replies as a response to the colossal fuckup of the company.
---
But it's nice to know that someone who doesn't actually follow what the CMs are up to swinging in to tell everyone to appreciate them or shut up.
---
Enjoy not getting triggered over pixels on a screen. I guess?
---
That is the one thing I'm hoping will redeem 76, at least for me. I played a couple of weeks after launch and figured that most of my personal issues at least, could be solved with self hosted servers and mods, which Todd also mentioned in the video I linked in another comment.
---
This surprises you?  This is the same company that wants us to be people who have lived together in a vault that are supposed to rebuild the world. 
---
Then, when you exit, you can't make settlements, everyone is occupying their own space, and the same people (the best and the brightest) you've known for 25 years all of a sudden lose their shit and begin raiding your shitty isolated log cabin because destruction is fun.
---
Which means that the only mods will be new models, textures and quests. No bug fixes, no interface optimization, no balance changes, no new features.
---
Neither NSFW content, if you know what I mean =)
---
Sorry for your existence.  
---
I mean I guess, but aren't you embarrassed to have such a sad life? I mean yah this game is really bad like really bad but to just go around just to watch lol wow 
---
Cod is trash but I don't go on the cod sub lol 
---
They have experience with the microtransactions. 
---
Yeah, took all of them, also had grenadier
---
Harper's Ferry 
---
Get out of here with that logic. This is exclusively an impotent rage zone.
---
This game is my biggest regret purchase. I was so fucking pumped for it to come out. Then I realized it was Inventory Management: The Game. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel
---
I think you need to read up on the lore.
---
Maxson broke off before the bombs even fell  **because he found out abot FEV experiments**.  Eventually calling his band of soldiers the brotherhood of steel.
---
In 76 the brotherhood base you come across is a band of soldiers that slowly (not instantly) turned into knights and paladins (despite early on many of the soldiers were a bit iffy on the "knights and paladins" etc naming.
---
And there were Westtek experiments on towns within west virginia.
---
Turns out; BoS and Supermutants were 100% a thing at that time period.
---
In fact in 76 they are in communication with the BoS normal until all the satellites fell out of the sky ~12 years later.
---
Funny how that works.
---
Probably. Just another karma whore cashing in on drama
---
Also what I'm reading about Destiny Crucible is it is a game mode, just like WoW Battlegrounds. That I assume any PvE player can join and play at any time they want. Just because they are not all PvPing all the time doesn't tell you anything.
---
Sounds like a duper crying lol 
---
You don't pay any attention to the shit you post. Read the top comment: OP had pack rat on. Pack rat doesn't effect junk weight when it's in your stash. Therefore, if you bulk your junk and store it in your stash, only lead aluminum and maybe plastic save weight. I'm done with this dumb back and forth
---
I had something similar. Got that email, responded. Nothing yet.
---
Can't even log in to make a ticket
---
Yeah don't hold a grudge, we've got an Atom sale on....lol how is holding a grudge having principles a bad thing? 
---
I mean in this case it's only a bad thing for Bugthesda really isn't it as it's them that's lost yet another customer :P
---
No, it's bugged to hell for a reason - if you'll get atoms by playing game, who will pay for those from atomic shop? I've tried to finish some yesterday (those who require discovering locations thorough the world) with alternate character. I, naive, though that if can't re-discover the location with my main, I'll try and run half the map to the Valley Galeria and get those poky 40 atoms for Mire location challenge with my lvl 3 alt. No luck - it's just bugged... 
---
But, out of nowhere, in the middle of shooting with some molerats, I got 80 points for using 76 Bobbleheads - I even didn't have this challenge on the list, it just pop out of nowhere and I've only used 20+ bobbles, maybe 30, but absolutely no way 76. And not with my alt - that character don't even have bobbles in his inventory. This game is just one, big mess...
---
This game is a lesson to corporation. What I come to watch is the sh\*tstorm they're getting from the people they tried to fool. And this my friend, it ain't sad I tell you.
---
Are you aiming at the people with actually REAL knowledge in modding/CS/development, that are educated and investing their free time for the community, into fixing a game even the game studio doesn't care to follow and patch themselves ?  
---
There's threads after each patch, by "modders", to point at every "hidden / undocumented changes" Bethesda forgot to mention in change logs. 
---
There's actual FIXES and MODS even for FO76 on the Nexus, made by the modders.  
---
Maybe, you're the one who needs a job, instead of keeping lockpicking toolkits IRL on you xD broke ass much ?
---
And energy weapons r made of paper masche(sp?) 
---
Hey can you give me all your gear since you won't be needing it?
---
This is why we can't have nice things. Gamers are ungrateful, self important creatures 
---
You know I wrote a thread about the old engine and people hated me for it but it's TRUE. Should have designed a new engine for a new style game. Snd t ok think starfiekd and rage 2 are running the same engine developed 8 years ago before it was called gamebryo which is 22 years old.
---
So far there has been 0 proof as far as im aware, just people stating so, I have crafted/scrapped a tonne and yeah im still kicking for now.
---
Absolutely. But: You never know what is happening at Beth right now. I think, it‚Äòs an opportunity to learn for both sides. I primarily wanted to reflect on that ‚Äûvideogames are here to enjoy, not to leave ppl desperate‚Äú thing. Let‚Äòs try to get back to the point, where videogames are a regretless and fun way of spending lifetime!
---
You literally sound like a generic twitter girl.
---
If you have packrat on it shows the same weight in your stash and in your inventory for the mats
---
Nerfs are necessary for balance and the overall health of the game, but timing is also important, and generally it‚Äôs not a good idea to implement nerfs while community sentiment is still a bit sore, and there‚Äôs the perception of there being more pressing issues, *even if you can work on both at the same time because they involve different developers. * 
---
It‚Äôs basic community management skills. 
---
"Bethesdrone" you even have a nickname. üòÇ You must have been a super fan. No wonder it triggered you enough to post. 
---
That's exactly what OP is for posting "reee i dont like ur game so i'm quitting". Pathetic attention grab
---
As someone who legitimately crafted and is carrying 34000 5.56mm and 750 Psychobuff, this scares me...
---
Uhh no it doesn‚Äôt. Unless your axe can be swung as fast as your rifle can fire and your arms are long enough to reach as far as the rifle can.
---
If it makes you feel any better about one swing doing more damage than one shot from your rifle, me slamming an axe into your chest irl isn‚Äôt any less devastating than two rifle shots. You‚Äôre still going to die. In fact with the rifle shots they might miss all vital organs and you could live.
---
If they didn't want us to scrap dozens of weapons they shouldn't have designed their game this way.
---
I literally can't imagine them banning for scrapping a *reasonable* amount of weapons. Like under 200 at a time. If you're crafting hundreds and hundreds that's most definitely who they're targeting.
---
I also do not believe that they will do so. Even if this would be possible technically (developers can make a portable version of code that works in data centers) and legally (another eula), they would still not be allowed by top managers - "it is unacceptable to lose money from microntransactions".
---
It wont make it that far, they have suggested maybe private servers towards the end of the year when they look at mods / creation club.
---
They got to get the latest hot fix ready and working before any of that and if past experience is anything to go by, I personally doubt they have the ability to do that let alone keep this mess alive until the end of the year :(
---
Hey man since you are quiting you should gift out all your gear outside of 76 for new players
---
Not for me. 
---
Warframe is free to play.   This sub Reddit sometimes.  Are you guys suffering from Stockholm syndrome?
---
The game is in a bad state because not many resources were put in.  They handed it to their new studio which previously failed as battle cry studios.
---
They marketed the game as a AAA experience when in fact it's just tell reminants of fallout 4 with multiplayer tacked on.  They are using the devoted fanbase as guinea pigs to test multiplayer on their dated engine for future releases like Starfield and ES6.
---
There are no NPCs probably because they are currently overhauling the animation system on Starfield.  Notice how every NPC is a robot and requires no lip movements?  Why hasn't Todd Howard made any statement on 76?  Where the hell is Peter Hines, the PR guy?  He has been radio silent since it's release.
---
They have the resources if they wanted but choose not to.  It was set out as a cheap project from the start.  I don't think Bethesda realise this but 76 failing will affect sales of Starfield and ES6.  
---
How have modders done a better job of fixing the game so far than full time Bethesda employees?  How did an older branch make it into the game?  Why isn't there a staging branch anyways for Bethesda and players to test before moving to production? 
---
I have bought 76 for both the Xbox and PC.  Whilst 120fps is nice the Xbox version has better UI.  PC got a straight up shitty console port with basic modern settings missing.  The controls are awful and the mouse movements are like wading through treacle.  
---
I own every fallout bar the brotherhood of steel.  I loved fallout.  I don't appreciate paying for stuff with atoms that we're in fallout 4 and it's dlc.  Again.  The CMs are doing a job of damage control.  They have their hands tied with what they can say and actually do.  I feel for them but all they can do is relay information passed on.
---
The devs themselves seem arrogant or indifferent to out feedback.  The patch notes so far have been quite standoffish and the labelling of their mistakes as exploits is a strange one.  Take the camp duplication glitch.  They fixed it and called it an exploit players took advantage of.  For an exploit it requires the other player to execute themselves but more often than not it did it automatically.  Players were actually sick of it.  Spending 45 minutes scrapping down 500% over budget was not fun.
---
The need to nerf white knight for no reason but ego.  Seems like there is some animosity towards the community when it's the community that has been supportive and the general gaming community hating on them.  Now it's reached fever pitch when the community is scratching their heads over why bugs are repeatedly reappearing and not being fixed.
---
We are told they are working on it, please provide feedback.  We already have.  Multiple bugs have still not been fixed and have been reported since beta.  This isnt acceptable.  A CM wanted to know what platform the slider bug was on. Do they not even play the game?  Everyone on my friends list who played this knew exactly what it was.  I'm shocked at the amount of posts here detailing bugs being ignored.  
---
Thanking the devs because you're worried about the game failing or because you can't accept they put out an unfinished product is counter productive. I've seen it all before with dayZ.  Devs have families, they are people too blah blah blah.  No this is a business providing a product and is not a passion project by a set group of people.  Resources are distributed and budgets are set.  They aren't your friends and they don't care.
---
This situation needs to be handled by higher ups.  They have lost me as a fan and customer, I've moved on and started playing other titles.  I'm only here now to see if they are reacting to any of this.  If they are actually going to listen.  But I doubt it.    
---
What major content could they even add? More land filled with same-ie buildings to look at and go "WOW, I can't pick anything up because I'm at max weight and my stash was filled before the BETA ended" There's nothing to do in this game save role-play with other humans and that is FAR more fun on pen and paper than in this "game".
---
I really can't believe someone got banned for doing this. I can actually believe that dupers with shitload of duped mats have problems because of recent patch when you can't carry more than 1500 punds + your current carry ability. So bans are not for crafting weapons (I was doing it yesterday - made 12 lever rifles to learn new mods) but for low level alts with millions of duped stuff.
---
I have been getting CTD while loading into a world since the latest patch(Jan 29) any one else experiencing this? Tried this method here to no avail. Any suggestions?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt know, never been banned.
---
99% agree with you. I *WAS* a huge Bethesda fan. Probably my favorite developer (read: not publisher), but not anymore.
---
The other 1% of disagreement is that it has taken them MONTHS to patch some of the most basic and "how was this overlooked" stuff.
---
I still remember the joke about them not knowing how to program climbing a ladder...
---
This is not acceptable. Battlefield 4 online was a nasty broken mess for about a month. Then, they RELEASED THE FIRST DLC FOR FREE because of it. I'm still waiting on an email offering three old games I've already played... Something internally needs to change. Hire outside programmers if the issues seem to complicated. Move leadership around. Improve processes.
---
LISTEN to your fans and supporters. Yes, this can sway things into unpopular decisions or create the impression that "the consumer doesn't know what they want so we'll tell them what they want" but transparency with patch notes mean nothing if the fundamental arguments and needs aren't being met.
---
Anyway, R.I.P. Bethesda (as a good and credible company). Here's hoping you can resurrect as a viable company in the future.
---
My weapons are lvl 45 and 50 and I found all but 1 legit farming, the other I bought off another player for caps. My perks are set up around explosives and big guns and rifles as these are the weapons I use. I paid 80 bucks for this game by preordering the tricentennial edition, I don't want to be a god, but I shouldn't have the issues killing that say a lvl 30 has, I'm not quitting but I am well within my rights to complain
---
Please get rid of combat, so we can [Sit around at our camps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo9AH4vG2wA) singing
---
Fallout 4 engine is creation engine which is gamebryo which is 22 years old
---
This is more than likely a false rumor, no one has any proof that a simple pic would provide so don't worry, OP. I crafted over 30 fire axes to learn the Spike mod and carried them around for a little while, no bans yet. I'll let you know if I do lol
---
Just pop a Daddy-O use that newly found intelligence to go ask the people who did the last patch.
---
 So... What'd ya add? 
---
ah okay! I guess i misunderstood the few posts floating around here. I was worried even having the items pass through my inventory would result in a ban.  Thank you! 
---
&gt;it brings me joy
---
Time to find new hobbies
---
"want you to build a game they want to play" 
---
- yes, that what we want.
---
This. Just copy pasted "emails"
---
Of course, thats all the youtube brigade will need for their next wave of hit pieces
---
Bethesda Austin is there new Micro Transaction experts though isnt it? E
---
if modders fix it then yeah maybe, fps physics, ultrawide, fov etc. are all still issues. 
---
Did you dupe? I crafted and scrapped at least 25 handmades to get the mods I wanted (do you know how many fucking screws that took!) and haven‚Äôt been banned yet.
---
With super duper I‚Äôm constantly crafting and scrapping.
---
Stop worrying, stop watching YouTube twats. Play the game and enjoy.
---
I mean, what do you want a **community manager** to say except the same shit? What's more natural than "thanks I'll let the guys know."?
---
Or maybe it's the fans voicing their concerns.    Ever think of that?
---
Nope it's the YouTubers poisoning their minds, the are only farming for karma, they are Bethesda haters etc.
---
Strange, seen it twice in the two visits I‚Äôve made there since the patch.
---
To let Bethesda know they're not happy. Why do you automatically think it was for you? Just move on.
---
Developing game... After 5months Bethesda is still ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù the game.
---
Loot not loading is normal behaviour in 76. Pretty sure the devs are not just smashing their fists on their keyboard randomly trying to see who can scream ‚ÄúDUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHH‚Äù the loudest.
---
So just place the door facing the other way.
---
Everyone you ban mistakenly should get priority treatment, WITHOUT having to make a reddit post about it. Sigh, like that's going to happen via your ticket system.
---
Because u stupid 
---
Delete your account.
---
You're cool.
---
You must not have read my comments on this thread because your reply doesn‚Äôt make sense. I love the game and still play every day. So you‚Äôre stupid implication that I‚Äôm just whining about hating the game and don‚Äôt want you to have an opinion contrary to mine is clearly false.
---
Yeah kinda defeats the purpose if they make a game nobody wants to play, except a few casual fanbois.
---
And this is what the sub has descended into. Sarcasric bashing of the game and devs to karma whore.
---
not gotten anything over 20 caps since the change :/
---
ESO was a broken buggy mess at launch, absolutely. I fondly remember falling through the floor of the Harborage as the Prophet tried to get me to go witness Mannimarco's betrayal and not being sure if this was supposed to be Oblivion or if I really had just fallen into the void under the game world (it was the latter). The comically large groups camping main quest boss spawn locations were quite something, too.
---
But at the same time, while I decided to stop playing and didn't return until Morrowind, I have to say that I think ESO was a much more complete and functional game at launch. Was it a mediocre MMO? Yes, definitely. But it also mostly worked, and the world and story was good enough to make it at least somewhat worthwhile. Even with just the base zones, ESO was still pretty big at launch, and the world felt interested and worth exploring... and I just didn't feel that with Fallout 76.
---
Also, even at launch Cyrodiil was a vastly superior and ambitious PvP experience than the drek we got with Fallout 76.
---
Oh look someone‚Äôs put their opinion on YouTube!
---
I know I come in when you leave to bask in your glory
---
having a keypad on both sides probably makes the most sense. I got mine working just fine though using a terminal on the non keypad side. Just log onto the terminal, power open the door. Then walk to the other side, input code on keypad and door locks keeping people out of that room. At first the power door set up didn't make sense to me, but i like the way its set up for the most part. Again, a keypad on both sides would be best case.
---
No it's not. The post isn't for you, it's for Bethesda. Get over yourself.
---
Vaccines DO cause autism! - George Washington-Christ
---
Formerly Battle Cry studios.  One which failed previously and was bought by Bethesda.  
---
Says the person triggered by OPs post. Ironic.
---
You could do the same you know. If Bethesda doesn't care why would the bother reading the scribblings of some loser on reddit?
---
So once again: seeya, try not to let the door hit you on the way out
---
Caps
---
So it will take them banning you personally for you to believe it? By then it would be too late wouldn't it?
---
I got mine at Watoga Station
---
What‚Äôs a duper?
---
They never learn. They never think.
---
Copy and pasted code is all bethesda need for the next dlc....hell even the next game :P
---
I didn't knooooooooow the patch was loaded\* and I'm soooo sorry my friends...
---
I didn't knooooooooow the patch was loaded\* and I'll never ever do it a-gain\~
---
\**with bugs*
---
Oh really?  Have you seen the OPs title?
---
Yep. Noticed your posts everywhere.
---
If they cant get something as sim pop le as a weight change what makes you think they can change aspect ratio without messing up...oh wait they did already.
---
If it's not for us then why post it publicly?

Still haven‚Äôt had issues with scalping large amount of weapons/armor/junk. I loot everything from location (ie. Watoga Civic Center) then break it down when I‚Äôm over encumbered. I do this daily for my vendor caps runs. So unless your duping, there is nothing to worry about. I still haven‚Äôt seen proof, just heard rumors. If anybody can point me to real evidence, it would be an interesting read and thanks in advance.

Sometimes I feel much like the OP. Other times I wonder if the Austin studio was just given an impossible task beyond their skill level and were thrown to the wolves with little to no support.
---
I mean there are some very clear managerial issues in terms of decision making regarding stuff like the collectors edition, rum, refunds then no refunds, laughably short "beta" and so on. I'm just not sure if the dev side of things is due to straight up incompetence or they're so much in the weeds and morale is so low, this is the best that they can manage with what they have.
---
I just feel bad for what seems to be some talented people in the studio. There's like little glimmers of a good game mired in a seemingly limitless sea of problems.
---
no it would take more than someone saying i got banned for it. I dont have a habit of believing randoms on the internet spouting things, especially considering this subreddit has been notorious for false rumours already.
---
Anyone that has experienced the blue prints for your camp duping themselves over and over have experienced duping though.
---
Lets just hope Bugthesda's sophisticated way of identifying dupers is able to tell the difference hey :)
---
I mean, the guns aren‚Äôt that much better than their non-legendary counterparts.
---
ES 6 isnt being made by the Austin Studio.
---
Clearly I pissed off a lot of melee builds.  What I was subtly (fyi don't use subtlety on the internet in the future) getting at is that melee is fucking fantastic and I feel like a fool for investing so much in rifle perks.  I started a slugger power armor alt build with a minor in automatic rifles for flying enemies, and I'm having fun even at lvl 5.
---
And now you're responding to every single one. Looks like i either have a stalker or a fan.
---
I do hope you're a stalker. They're so fun to fuck with
---
Lol, I just don't believe OP is done with Bethesda, either. üòÇ That's what made me laugh. They'll be back as soon as the tides are fair again. Reddit karma Farmers. 
---
Thank you bro but whatever i will just try the events 
---
Until when? How long do you give them? In the mean time do you sit there quietly, not letting them know you're pissed off, or try to let them know they need to buck up. It's not like they haven't given them a chance, OP has given the game a lot more than most people have. There comes a point when you've got to say "F*ck it" and move on. YOU are the reason companies like Bethesda think they can get away with this shit. OP has paid his money, he has a RIGHT to say his peace. If you don't like it, ignore it.
---
I just crafted 300 boards to get sum mods
---
You‚Äôre right, thanks.
---
Does it matter what level am I?
---
Im level 30 
---
Apparently the flying mechanics are absolutely fantastic, so it might be worth getting just for that. But... yeah. Not terribly excited for it, either.
---
Bethesda is just a small indie ganes studio and personally my real life friend as opposed to a soulless corporation... how about you just be thankful they're trying you entitled piece of shit?
---
sssh, or they'll carbon copy the ~~Skyrim Dragons~~  I mean *Scorchbeasts* again
---
imagine if it was a COOP story driven game?
---
wasted potential 
---
I see your points.  Well thought out discussion, thank you for the response.
---
I -- I can't tell if you're being serious.  The internet has confused my sarcasm filter.
---
I'm sure they are cursing u and uninstalling the game 
---
Its a grimey filthy little turd like creature that causes server crashes and general instability
---
Hey, some of the mods in the radium are 0.65% chance which makes them a whole lot easier to unlock!
---
That is a whopping 44% easier!
---
Congratulations! (read in Mr Prize Bot voice) 
---
I agree with all of this, I too played ffxi endlessly, I quit at around 500 days playtime.
---
My most recent game I compare to fallout 76 is skyrim: dragonborn dlc. Just that one dlc has more content than all of fallout 76 
---
You do realize Square Enix redid the entire game from the ground up. With the new version being released 9 months later. 76 needs new or better management. The game mainly suffers from poor balance issues. Stuff cut and pasted from 4 that probably wasn‚Äôt properly tested. I still got hope in 76 but these choices in nerfing explosives, how OP melee is and how TSE were really shows the game wasn‚Äôt tested too much. 
---
Karma whore is a bit exaggerated, I'm well aware of the downvote squad that camp this sub. 
---
Well I haven't seen posts referring to CMs work up until recently, and when they showed up they were mostly trying to mock them, or actually to mock her directly.
---
The fuckup is not collosal, in fact I believe its a major overreaction, its not even a third as bad as carry weight PA logout glitch, so the increase in CMs output is still something I consider worth appreciating. The worst part of this patch is the fact that demo expert is weaker for weapon set that looks like it was purposedly underperforming already as in order to estabilish non-Big-guns meta. The dmg output of regular explosives and stuff like alien blaster for me was a sign that those are not the weapons for the initial phase of the game and that they are getting a boost later in the future. 
---
Sorry for not knowing everything, not sorry for recommending stfuing to a big part of the community, especially those rude to the people trying to do their job.
---
No, it's available to all levels now, I'm now 60something and seeing it. Server hop a few times perhaps?
---
Guns age like wine.
---
Why do you think OPs post was for  you? Maybe they're letting Bethesda know through Reddit they've had enough. Did he tag you in the post to let you know he was leaving, or did you read it, decided you don't like him and posted in here to look cool?
---
If you really want to benefit from the legendary effect of a medic's weapon you need to use something with low AP cost in order to fill that critical meter as fast as possible. The best choice for that are pistols, so I would add 9 of those extra points on agi and get the pistol damage perks.
---
Also charisma perks like rad sponge, that activate on a random chance, by my experience, are better left on lvl 1 since they actually have enough power on that lvl (also you can share them an multiply the chance by the number of teammates). Having that in mind maybe you would want to dial back a little on charisma and add some points into luck, and get some perks to boost your critical meter fill rate, and critical damage.
---
Of course not. That's the entirw point to karma whoring. 
---
Shhhh delete this!
---
Fine: attention whoring then. Either way.
---
Division 2?  Jesus, I hated Division "1".  God that game drove me mad.  
---
Yea hmm farming the queen for a damn leg for 2 months and bam on a terminal....wasted time playing
---
That's the line! Lamp on Atom store and thing goes from awesome to PR disaster!
---
&gt; The fuckup is not collosal
---
Do you work in programming or in development? Do you understand how colossal a regression and version control fuckup is?
---
Stay in your lane, stop making light of such laughable performance from a AAA studio.
---
Now I want to get in on it. I love anarchy in my MMO's.
---
Farewell, adieu, auf wiedersein, but.... Why should we care? If you're gonna leave then just leave. Don't post a karma whoring thread that the devs will never read (if they care as little as everyone is claiming)
---
Look at the edit. It's important. I'd never bash anybody working hard and pushing thing through regardless of their opinions simply because their management is incompetent and money greedy.
---
what? they ask you to explain the high rate of item creation??
---
isn't it their job to look into such stuff before banning? 
---
also they are the only ones really able to explain what happend by investigating server logs. 
---
Would they even believe the word of someone they just banned from the game?
---
I seen them on watoga station yesterday 
---
And then cashed in on it with a karma whoring apology when you coulda just edited whatever post you were wrong on.
---
How did you hit it?
---
Is it just me, or are nearly all the MODUS terminals stuck with the creepy smile face since the patch?
---
"A dining room"
---
You don't get banned for crafting and scrapping. Sounds like someone duped and blamed it on something else to justify their own stupidity.
---
1. I've had this gave since day 1 and have busted my ass for everything I've gotten.
---
2. I've not dupped/cheated to get any of my stuff.
---
3. As for third party mods I'm on Xbox and I'll say it I'm not gonna even try to fuck with third party stuff just to play a game.
---
Can we be better than hitting the "Autism" button every time someone holds a different opinion, even if that opinion is bloody stupid?
---
you were ripped off. could have got the game for $12.99 and used free Atoms to by the fluff and skins that came with that edition couldn't you?
---
That assume that people don't get bored and move on to other games. Personally I haven't touched the game since 2018 due to this exact issue. I've been playing other games instead while watching for patch notes that will make the game less tedious.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure the community managers will "pass this information along" too üòâ 
---
Um, you know it's a bug right? There's a new headlamp coming (Mothman Headlamp), and that's why all of a sudden **ALL** headlamps have a atom shop icon on it.
---
Don't start false bullshit
---
I‚Äôm not a melee build, I‚Äôm a rifle build and I fuck up anything that isn‚Äôt the scorchbeast queen. Despite the ridiculous armor rating nerd, I still make scorchbeasts cower in fear at my two shot handmade rifle.
---
Melee is... ok. It‚Äôs extremely limited in range and will eventually get its own nerfs. I‚Äôd much rather my current build because I can just kill anyone using melee before they get anywhere near me.
---
Also eventually there will be buffs to some ranged weapons, as well as explosive and two shot effects. They‚Äôre too weak to even be though about right now.
---
Well according to the math for every bug you get x^10 bug plus a 20% increase in bug probability minus the devs involvement which is y^-50 plus community uproar of (z^2 +4z x 6x^10)20%=long long long long time to never. Kinda like how you'll hit the 7200 hour challenge for 20 at ok ms.
---
I noticed this yesterday, has anyone reported it as a bug?
---
Im done with it two ive loved fallout n Bethesda for yrs ive got n love most of there games but 76 is well beyond a joke before this recent patch i was having problems with my tse damaging targets then healing them back to full heath now it still does that n my guns have been nerf by not half no no no 70 fukn % not to mention more bugs n still fuking old ones. Bethesda seriously i think you need to pull this game back n fix it then re-release it has already cost you so much rep n lost just about every loyal player there is i always said that Bethesda made games for its fans no mirotransaction no ridiculous expensive dlc in fact with falout 4 if you bort th delux before launch you would get all DLC for $30 aud and you looked after fans so well over th yrs but wtf is 76 did you make this just to fuk with us?  was this some kind of joke?? Im stumped how for you have fallen
---
Awesome post.
---
For me, I'm not rethinking the next Fallout. I'm rethinking the next Bethesda game altogether, regardless of franchise. 
---
The truly sad thing is, Fallout 76 was meant to be their opportunity to come back from the downward slide of Fallout 4. 
---
Also, don't worry about feeling like a noob. The difference between 45 to 50 is there but after that the levels are mostly symbolic. You have your non-essential perk card roster filled out more. That's about it.
---
Love the Nerf on tse weapons... Not! Can barely launch a nuke now, scorchbeast queen is impossible to kill even with 2 teams of maxed players. Still haven't fixed any issues that have been ruining the game, such as the 2-3 loading screens everytime you log in or fast travel, or the constant disconnections. which is lovely right after you drop a nuke, or waste the caps capturing a workshop. At least the stuff in the atomic shop looks cool even though it still just as buggy as the excavator armour. Doesn't matter where you put the atomic weapons bench, it'll walk off on you. 
---
Ha! I own it (unistalled a month ago), but me too. It is pretty sad this is my entertainment, but Bethesda did all of this to themselves. Keep it up, Bethesda!
---
/s last statement....I am really sad, though. Fix this shit!
---
Dude, the idea is cool, but those lazy bastards (devs) can't do properly more important things and you want them to "play" with cosmetic look of the armors... Be serious ;)))
---
They can't fire you if you disable your hitbox and can't be interacted with.
---
Shoulda thought this thread through properly then, idiot
---
There‚Äôs always one of them.
---
Wiki says it was co-developed with Maryland. 
---
I‚Äôm the exact same level and have run into the exact same issue as I‚Äôm slowly pushing into the Savage Divide.  Thank you for explaining this, it‚Äôs been highly frustrating.
---
Honestly I wouldn't even be mad if they took the game down right now and took a month to fix it
---
&gt;the nerf to TSE, plus demo expert making a 70% overall damage reduction to my sniper making it not a 1 shot kill headshot on a sneak sniper build is what‚Äôs the issue
---
Seems like you were over relying on an obviously overpowered weapon. I did some testing last night. Crafted a new, non-legendary Western revolver. Went around and found some higher level enemies, 40 glowing miners, 62 charred ghouls, and I was one and two shotting them with sneak headshots. With 0 points in pistol perks. If you have a full sniper build, with damage and armor penetration, and a tse (which, after the nerf is *still* the most powerful legendary combination on guns), and you can't one shot kill things, you might have bigger problems than an explosive nerf.
---
Either you haven't even tried it since the patch, and are just over reacting, or you are just being hyperbolic to the extreme and riding the wave of this latest Bethesda hate train, or you are just really really terrible.
---
I confirm that number 2 happens for me consistently.
---
You found Todd!
---
This is what I'm saying. The community wants this game fixed. If you guys can't do it, hire new people or at least take what knowledgeable people are giving you. Some of these people have been working with Bethesda games longer than the devs, and it shows.
---
It was replaced with sad laughter - the bitter one 
---
Well I don't really meant to imply its "falloutish".
---
I look at it from a game perspective and not from a theme within a game.  Does not matter if its fallout or XCOM2 or Fortnite.
---
I'm relating to any game really when saying buying cheater-items from 
---
others is a unsavory thing to do.  It just hurts the game on the whole.  If someone engages with such tactics, it shows they have little regard to others it affects (jerks 1 shotting legendaries and Griefers leveling bases) just to make themselves feel superior to someone else in an imaginary world.
---
I guess it may be unrealistic to think there should be majority of the community as civil people just wanting to have fun in a game.
---
Its also in Bethesda's best interest to keep the game equal for everyone.  Encourages less bad behaviors and longer play before leaving the game.   If someone blows through all content in 1 week, they are more apt to discontinue playing the game vs someone who took 6 months to finish all quests.   Sure there is not as many people playing now as when the game was first released, very apparent.  But I look forward to playing when all the jerks with TSE and Griefers quit playing.  No not everyone with TSE are Jerks; just the ones that abuse it.
---
They'll make it f2p before that.
---
We all came from normal weapons to Legendaries weapons. We don‚Äôt need to imagine that. Legendaries weapons should perform much better than normal weapons. What‚Äôs your point?
---
Well, the way you are looking at this is not without its points, i.e. agreed the bobby pin weight increase is kinda strange.
---
But from the game playability, which is the perspective that I looked at it from, the bulked stuff issue and the bobby pin weight are not a collosal fuckup.
---
Just pointing out that your post suggests it was 100% developed by Austin. It was co-developed with both them and Maryland. 
---
And Todd said it was their biggest project yet with everyone working on it.  Tell me lies...
---
That man can really jump it for a fat man.
---
If the CM's left tomorrow what would change?
---
No more cut n paste (well pass that on"  comments? Not such a big deal really tbh
---
Fix the source and not the way you get to it...
---
Putting limits on crafting just shows how incompetent the Dev team is
---
You're wrong...bombs dropped on Oct 23 2077 so the devs died...your all wrong....I'll wait until reclamation day and the overseer opens my vault. 
---
I would, but my vacation time hasn't built back up, and it's a really long flight.
---
Me too. Turned me into something angry. I don't think it was a pleasant co op experience when I was in group. Mind you, everyone in the group seemed to have a little more spite in them playing that game. 
---
Pity. It was such a well realised, beautiful world. Just didn't live up to the hype...the hype it created.
---
This x1000
---
What qa team are you talking about? 
---
To be fair, as I said, developers aren‚Äôt the same as the art and visuals department. Many of the bugs you‚Äôll be seeing will be code based, aka developer responsibility. 
---
The art team will be the ones doing new geometry beds (atom store princess bed) and textures (whenever you see a new power armour paint) the two departments are usually separate. 
---
Example: you just had a new bathroom installed in your house and the pipes to your sink bust open and flood the whole room. You don‚Äôt call up the painter and call him a lazy incompetent idiot. You go after the plumber. They both worked on your bathroom but they do very different jobs.
---
Thanks. :) I‚Äôm putting the game aside for now. Looking forward to picking it back up once fixed.
---
Heavy gun perks don't apply to explosive weapons.
---
Damn bethesda uk replied
---
Yes bethesda is on vacation right now and does not give a shit. Please buy our jacket in the mean time
---
Coming soon to an Atomic Shop near you for the low, low price of 1800 atoms...
---
This sounds a lot like "No True Scotsman."
---
I have no idea. I'll have to check again but with removing all weight reducing perks and weight reducing legendary armor I guess I hit 1500. With everything equipped I have like 260 lbs I can carry and only took up 160ish. 
---
It's pretty frustrating that their limit isn't what is possible to carry. If I'm not over encumbered then who cares? Make the limit like 750 above the absolute limit. I'm not really worried about it it's just annoying that there's no way to tell without removing everything.
---
Im used to fusion cores weighing 0.3 lbs
---
I stopped playing, but for religious reasons. Vishnu visited me in my sleep and told me my genitals would fall off if I touched Fallout 76 again. I learned after the last time that when a Hindu god tells me my balls are doing to fall off, they mean business. 
---
To clarify ... I am not the one who got banned and the person who reported getting banned showed the support email telling them they got banned for crafting too much
---
So were anglers and bloodbugs, according to my cannibal. How about we start a cannibalistic tribe in the swamp, since that's where all the "humans" spawn?
---
Still no reduction to 2SE nerf? Not taking away demolition expert or white knight nerf? Not fixing searching caps stashes? There's a lot of other issues that should be included in this hot fix...
---
I got the same feeling here.   I think Bethesda has another team working on Starfield?   That these guys working on FO76 were by themselves for the most part.
---
You have to step back and look at it as a whole though. In my eyes there isn't much difference between "over your head in the AAA MMO space" and being inept and being in a AAA space. 
---
Looks the same from the consumers point of view.
---
Here comes the downvote squad
---
Anyone whining shouldn‚Äôt play. 
---
Lolz agreed 
---
I hope you guys get the game you deserve but if you don't, fear not, another *\*cough\*Obsidian\*cough\** company will take care of it. 
---
Im not even the one banned xD
---
Is it being co-maintained by both studios too?
---
WATOGA STATION 
---
&gt; Unless your axe can be swung as fast as your rifle can fire
---
DING DING DING we have a winner!!!! 
---
Im not banned but i read some Posts on here stating that they did get banned for just crafting
---
Very well constructed appeal.
---
This is reddit you always have to think things through because stupid answers are every where listen to me I'm with stupid ^
---
I am pretty sure they used a bunch of them, not just a single one.
---
Considering some of your comments and posts are you whining about tses and the devs, maybe you should be one of the last few people who should suggest that. What a fucking hypocrite
---
Did someone piss in your cereal?  Is that why your so angry? Is everything okay?  Do you need someone to talk to?  I'll talk to you if your so lonely you act on the internet for attention.  I won't let you down.  üòÉ

---
maybe 50% of those who complain get tired of having to put up with so many mistakes for a game aaa A game that costs 60 dollars. A game that has too many errors to have the 2015 engine a game that has such a short content that it was probably planned for someone who only has 30 minutes per day a game with a pvp so bad that one does everything possible to avoid it If people do not complain, everything remains the same.  Some may complain about anything, but others do it correctly.  And that's what I've been since the beta, but since the beginning of January I stopped playing. 
---
I just wonder, what if bethesda manages to fix the bugs and add new features and content within a few months  i wonder how those whiners will react.... 'thank you bethesda we love you' 
---
Partly true since coders have to insert that newly designed armor mods to actual game not screwing other things in the process. Which may be, as we seen many times already, too difficult for them. 
---
I would prefer if they focus their workforce to do proper 21:9 mode, not this crap we currently have...
---
Tell Bethesda to stop fucking up so that u/Juicehead2 
---
and others can get back to their normal content.
---
Co developed I believe. Once it shipped (unfinished) it seems like it went to new team. What else could it be?
---
I hope that Bethesda is at least grateful, these guys are what's keeping the Fo76 project to be a total disaster. 
---
I blame parents.
---
Apparently they're not. Apparently they are quitting in droves. And the rest are on the forums and reddit not playing.
---
huh?
---
Ha, he's just anticipating it.
---
I'm being dead serious dude, instead of posting a useless comment, you could have been constructive. There's a way for bethesda to do a 180, and thats with virtually no players populating their servers. 
---
Honestly, I understand your post. I still play every day and I have about 350 hours in the game. 
---
That being said, what I think happened is the culmination of more than a few bad months of gaming. 
---
The climate of video games in the last year or two has really shifted from being content-based to instant gratification-based. Opening loot boxes and micro transactions have dominated most of gaming for a while now.
---
The last safe place to assure a game with hundreds of hours of content and replayability over and over again was Bethesda between either the fallout games or the elder scrolls games.
---
We were all hoping for a game to change the status quo. We just got more of the same.
---
I will need to double check. 
---
Yeah, sure. Worse things can happen. I could slam my dick in a blender for instance. Why does that suddenly excuse being Bethesda being utterly incompetent?
---
My comments were troll comments btw. Its not my fault you dont get the sarcasm of it 
---
I agree. Also they should have a big damage falloff, since they are firing ball ammo.
---
Coding 101 &lt;If item is =&lt; 10000 then flag_for_review&gt;
---
"just for crafting" is such a simplification of why, one might even  suggest that this is a "shit post"
---
Yeah.  I felt like the world was inhabited strictly with very angry 13-year-olds.
---
Is there any cjamve Bethesda could pull the game like FFXIV and sort the mess out, or has it past that point? 
---
Fallout 65 is great, it's 76 you need to worry about :-)
---
Or Fast Traveling?  Let's not get silly here.  You're supposed to have *fun* in a game and often times that involves a suspension of disbelief.
---
You shouldve bought Fallout 69 instead of 65 
---
would give you mine if i could, iv uninstalled now anyway.
---
Do you happen to have the link? I‚Äôm interested in the source.
---
Sorry to hear that. I knew this would happen after they said they turned on a program to catch high amounts of items. They probably set it to anything over 5 gets flagged. 
---
Nope it's an ok game and if you got it on sale well worth it IMO
---
I don't think I've seen it go below $35 so far. Are you sure that wasn't region locked keys for Asia/Europe/Aus? I need keys for NA and those haven't gone down in price.
---
same here all my two shots pretty much suck now. TS Combat shotgun is still usable tho. I suggest getting adrenal reaction so you can lower your health a bit and get higher dmg on your weapons to balance out the nerf. 
---
Except i enjoy the game and want it to succeed. I don't see how saying "this,mess you've created" isn't bashing as you claim in your "super important edit", but hey. You keep telling yourself that kiddo
---
I hear you dude. It's just too funny, especially atm where every1 "can't defend this game anymore" :D Like they would defend ppl who scammed them so
---
Looking forward to it. Rust should hold me over until then, hopefully...
---
At nearly the 3 month mark, every patch should fix things...not break things that weren't broken or that had been fixed in a previous patch
---
very much this people on here keep trying to make this out as normal. its one thing when a gane releases and has some bugs its a different story when they release a beta, claiming to be a full game. the whining is warranted people are tired of this becoming a normalized thing. if we are told its a full game then we should get just that.
---
Absolutely all of this post is completely amazing üòç I wish I was reading patch notes
---
Mabey instead of stuck of quiters on this thread mabey ww could get some new developers but these guys aint doing that 
---
Down voted you. Hope you don't mind.
---
I guess for me the difference is nuanced - is it just a management problem or a management AND team problem.
---
At the end of the day it doesn't matter which it is. You still have a game in a terrible state.
---
It's just one of those things that makes you think "no, surely a studio that has such a long running string of success can screw up THIS hard...?", and yet here we are.
---
Ehh my friend got banned for suspicious activity because he was using sentinel armor and not taking damage in PvP...
---
And stupid people too. Are you bashing me or OP? Cause win your complete lack of punctuation it just looks like word soup
---
Maybe OP works for Bethesda 
---
It‚Äôs the only possibility how he can not see it as massive fuck up - and explain the situation the game is in 
---
Yeah, that is why I stopped playing. I made a post recently about
---
Bethesda nerfing the fun out of this game here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aikz1o/bethesda_stop_nerfing_the_fun_out_of_this_game/
---
So, 100% agreed. The company has completly lost touch of its player base. And also lost a lot of fans by doing so. 
---
People just want to play and enjoy the game. Of course they will get praise for everything they do right.
---
I bought a used PC copy on amazon. Can I learn to dupe?
---
Ah the good 'ol, i was being sarcastic/joking. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Just gtfo, moron. Censorship isnt the fucking answer
---
Fair enough, cause if i am honest. i was unsure what sort of weapon i wanted for my Medic. so one guy said yeah give Medic wep a go etc etc.. so i was like ok.. cool so yeah hence the post :P
---
lol, yeah they are only deleting 100% shit posts with no value. If you bothered to scroll through the reddit in stead of being  so desperate for attention you would have seen that for yourself. https://imgur.com/a/1ejsiMe How many alt accounts do you have?
---
I never expected BGS to both deliver a poor quality game and go on and not deal with it. FO76 needs an overhaul on par with FFXIV, it's so weird how passive such an amazing developer is with their newest game.

i don't see a /s anywhere and the phrasing comes as a serious tone maybe you should learn how to actually use sarcasm

Silentkeeper007 xbox live: I convince my friend and his wife to get the game. Respectively i was level 132  over the weekend when Scott built his camp over at Morganton. He was showing a random player who we made friends with his camp. All of my online friends were giving him plans before the tuesday update. Two griefers came in and killed them both and destroyed his camp. I was surver hoping when he texted me to come back to his surver. Scott was over level 17 at the time.
---
So i arrived to find them killing Scott over and again and the random player left. I chased them down and killed on and got murdered by the other. The player was OP with TSE one shotting me blowing up my power armor which resulting me dieing at the same time. I have TSE explosive  but not have managed to learn the SPECIAL Point system to make me strong enough to be OP and do not use mutations. So i quickly put my camp down and just run incumbered in a hazmat suit and tried to fight them failing multiple times.
---
I got frustrated and pulled out around power armor and followed them cause they got bored or killed me and Scott.  I tracked them down Near Vault 76 and fought them again which resulted in my more of my deaths and the loss of caps. I followed them again to Point Pleasant where i predicted their next move and figured they were going after lower level camps and killing players. All the while they harasssed me on xbox live. 
---
Long story short i died more timea than i can count, had to two power armors completely shattered, and a loss of over two thousand camps. After a while i stopped counting. I hate griefers and pray they ban people for this. You wanna grief people i will be there to defend them.
---
 Valid, it would need some dev work. 
---
But probably just replacing one asset with another.
---
And the art team probably wouldn‚Äôt require a lot of downtime for it either, given most of the actual assets for these visual modifications already exist. 
---
Pouches for combat armour already exist in the form of the model for the military ammo bag everyone Scraps for ballistic fibre. Tin cans for the raiders would just be cram cans or empty tin cans.
---
Leather pouches for metal armour could be pulled directly from the geometry from the leather armour.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to imply it would literally be that easy, but easier than from scratch.
---
Granted they‚Äôre likely actually probably buried in future dlc projects like the other vaults.
---
You can pay for higher stats. That's cause for concern.
---
Ok but i am tired of the bitching about dumb shit like nerfing TSE from people who have no lives and have somehow managed to put hundreds of hours in the game and are bored. What did they expect if they played the shit out of the game already? Most people aren't that high up in game hours. In regards to the other stuff, again, I've paced myself with the game (life, you know) so patience I guess as they try to fix things. But make no mistake, patience does have limits.
---
Can I at least get a jump rope?
---
Vishnu pls
---
Melee grenadier that avoids PA here. As I read the patch notes it became more and more apparent that Bethesda hates my character because I didn't have to repair everything after every two hour play session.
---
Needed to be nerfed.
---
Are seriously asking this ??
---
If fallout 3 and 4 didn't have modding some issues would never have been fixed. Being online means they have to listen or the money drys up. 
---
The lever action glitch was fixed in 76 because we can't just fix it ourselves and Bethesda actually is forced to fix problems preventing people from playing or that damage balance. 
---
There is a super fine line between complaining/venting/ and reporting and discussing an issue.
---
People losing their minds over little issues like the bobby pins is stupid though the main problem lies in the fact they don't seem to be able to update the game without breaking other things. 
---
Its as if none of you fragile gamers lived long enough to experience the "UPDATE, PATCH,HOTFIX cycle of development that has been prevalent  since the early 2000's.
---
Upvoted you in return üòÅ
---
You MUST be exaggerating greatly.   I am in Watoga all the time and can 1 shot level 8 Mr Handy with a normal handmade (non legendary) with all the right perks equipped.  I can pretty much 2-3 shot legendary level 50 Major Gutsy still.  The nerfs did not hamper me in anyway, so that remained the same.   Col Gutsy still takes some effort as it did prior to patch.
---
Deathclaws always took several shots for me.   Same with SB.  I am fine with that because they are "end game" mobs and meant to pose a challenge, not cannon fodder.
---
The started shipping previous versions out off the game now as well as patches?
---
Pistols are unique though, there are so many perks for pistols that are not available for other weapons.  Things like increased run speed run speed.  I forget the others, but I remember there being at least a couple.  
---
Plus Pistols are huge advantage when running non-PA build!   Enormous advantage.  You already are going to have 15 points in agility, thus your evasion perk is going to work really well right away.
---
I'm running a perception/luck build and the most I can dish to agility is 11 (suffering low points to other areas).    I'm always curious to see how a well made pistol build will work.   I've also seen some videos on youtube about pistol builds can can kill SB in like 30 seconds with a Level 1 Pipe Pistol as well!    Of course the video changed the stock as it was more of a rifle but it still counted as "pistol" because that was the base gun he started with.   Set it on Auto and used crits/stealth to drive up the damage and had tons of AP. 
---
nope had just logged on and was hopping vendors and it just cut out. My weapon dmg was going up and down as well prob because of adrenal working and then not working. But I think I did have rad worms so maybe that was it. Its just never happened before to my knowledge. I appreciate the info!
---
https://youtu.be/0F87oy3T0aQ already did that
---
While all this negativity is really out of hand, Beth should be rolling out weekly hotfixes and not waiting for their monthly mega patch. You take small steps to reach a goal; not wait the entire year and try to finish it within a month. 
---
I do like the nerfs to TSE though. It was without a doubt something broken that should have been spotted before it went out of control. That being said it does leave a lot of other ranged guns without a very strong end game. Energy being useless, heavy guns are broken, and rifles seem weak overall unless you‚Äôre running a vats sneak build. 
---
I‚Äôd love to see the game improve over time, but it‚Äôs hard to see right now. Aside from that I do plan to keep playing and you won‚Äôt see me actively complaining like a small portion of the community is; the rest are playing or taking a break.
---
TLDR; nerfs to certain criteria are necessary, but no buffs or hotfixes (content is another story) is hurting the game majorly.
---
Are you seriously asking this or taking the piss ?
---
Oh don't get me wrong, it is bashing, bashing Bethesda as a whole not the little hands who tried to do their best. 
---
69 in the wasteland is not going to be as much fun as you are imagining :/
---
Haven't looted 1 bar of soap yet ...
---
Inertial weapons Damage should be tied to the bullet and weapon level, and balanced through handling. 
---
That said Laser and Plasma Weapons should be handled differently.
---
Lasers should be highly customizable in their damage output through their barrel, and not just pistol, mid calibre, and full powered rifle variants, but granular adjustments within each short, long and charging variant.
---
* this one is just my own vanity request. The automatic laser should  fire a continuous energy beam like the assaultron head, but act like a ranged chainsaw weapon doing repeated damage ticks.
---
ROF though the trigger, and Ammo Capacity though it's Capacitor
---
Lasers should be accurate AF with only the users natural wobble and movement affecting accuracy.
---
Emitters  
---
Customizable Beam splitter. Parallel, narrow, medium and wide angle.   
---
Ionizing Emitter- Builds Stun on an enemy. When Sufficient Stun has been applied, the enemy keels over the same way the stun mod for the FO4 supersledge worked but not chance based. Robots should be highly susceptible to this  
---
Beta-Wave Emitter builds burn on an enemy until they ignite.   
---
Stabilized Emitter- compensates for the users naturally wobble and movement, reduces range.   
---
Focusing Emitter- Increases range
---
The Trade offs for Laser Weapons   
---
No Stopping power- It kills the charging deathclaw, or the deathclaw gets up in your grill   
---
No perks that allow the bypassing of ER (BGS doesn't even have to do anything for this one).   
---
Heat Build Up- Implement a system similar to the recent Battlefront games, but instead of being the reload mechanic. Have Heat build up affect weapon Condition. You can run your Laser hot but condition will go down quickly, or you can keep it cool through ROF limiting through the trigger, or the players own trigger discipline, and have the laser run all day
---
A song of Ice and Fire  
---
Being Frosted or set on fire should carry a debuff. I'm thinking being frosted increases ballistic damage done to you by some margin and being on fire does the same but for energy damage. Hurray those Cryo grenades and Molotovs aren't so useless anymore.   
---
I Am Work, Plasma thoughts later
---
the fragility is strong.
---
If you've played other MMO's then this whole thread is one scratchy record.  What matters is how the company communicates, recognises its faults and explains how they'll do better.  Till then (and I'm not holding my breath) play till it's boring then be thankful there's a new Far Cry, just cause, generation zero, Metro... Plenty to get on with.  Emo "I quit" posts won't change a thing. 
---
nope dont have that one but still good to know.
---
Well the nerfing of TSE was amusing, but nerfing white knight sucked as did removing stacking from rad-x (which is only useful if stacked and which stacked in fallout 4).
---
Nah
---
Nope that is skynet taking control bathesda not that smart
---
I think the shift is actually due to the Polar Vortex. You see, when water freezes underground, it expands and causes seismic activity. So, the shift in the community was probably caused by that.
---
I agree, and they've added something to the mix that is addicting.  I think they're testing how strong of a hold it has vs our anger. 
---
I‚Äòm done with the game now cause I wont accept this anymore, I wont let Bethesda destroy things I worked for.
---
Love fallout 65 great game because I'm still stuck in the vault for another 11 years good purchase
---
Thanks mate! Also for the advice, really appreciate that!
---
Exactly. Thats all everyone wanted. Just A game similar to fallout 4 but with the ability to play with a few friends. Its just a shambles atm though. I hope they do something that fixes it 
---
Its a product that people paid for that isn't fit for purpose.
---
Well Hotrod Todd may just bless them with more tinkle from his Winkle.
---
Thank you for the heads up.
---
I only have a handful of armor mods left to unlock and of course about 70% of the Radium Rifle ones becuase of course I do.
---
Been accumulating mats for quite a while - crafting radium rifles is really not cheap - and was planning to let my mule craft them for me and give her some exp in the process, you know, make the best of a bad situation and all that.
---
Now I think I am going to hold my horses on this one until I can shuffle some stuff so if. Beth bans my mule account I am left to rot cut out from my 'supply storage'. 
---
Don't do that....
---
Haha that question is actually goodüòÇ But I told my friend he would get my shit 
---
Because of the radiation, Black Powder Rifles mutated and became more powerful.
---
Above (person I responded to) is an outright lie then. Not exaggeration. It's upvoted high in karma too.
---
People make shit up so much about this game. It's bizarre.
---
Same its fukn bullshit that was th only resson for me to play this game coz ya just fuk shit up but my tse lever guns went from 930 to 270 i mean what th fuck is that? almost 70% nerfed.  bs!!!!
---
One of the least self aware posts I have ever seen.
---
That would be dope as hell. A bunch of crazy cannibal vault dwellers traipsing through the swamp chomping on anything that moves.
---
Kind of is as you typed it....hypocrite
---
yep, a buddy of mine got banned for 'excessive item creation', he responded to the e-mail within the hour... 4 days later he's completely locked out of anything that requires login.  No forums, Support tickets., nothing.
---
It is a joke.
---
I personally find it hilarious when I see people going everywhere crouched, like everywhere, between vendors in Watoga, the dull length of Enclave bunker etc.
---
Dude everyone can see you, you just look odd and very paranoid.... :-)
---
Yeah but bethesda downvote squad is gonna smack you as soon as they wake up.
---
I'm one of those that jumped ship early. I literally quitted the day the first patch came out and stuffs (quests, items and things I'd built in my CAMP disappeared). And I agree -- there are some many better games to play right now that I won't be going back to Fallout 76 until I see an overwhelming "the game now is good" from the community.
---
Keep em banned.
---
marine combat arms. believe i saw them either at grafton or welch. Leaning towards grafton since I was looking for these plans just prior to the patch and saw posts saying all were available there with the server hop method. Was disappointed when I only saw the one plan. Maybe it's on rotation still? /shrug
---
Insert comment defending the atom store: the store team and the developers do not do the same, everything is programmed, blah blah blah
---
the problem is not the store, the problem is that they try to keep trying to get money when the game is not stable , parece un early acces de 60 dolars
---
Very brazen on the part of Bethesda.
---
Same for me but I have moved over to next terminal and it work for me. 
---
"Johnson, you're fired.  Get your stuff and come with me please."
---
"Sorry dude.  I'm a main quest giver and I am flagged as such so I can't be killed.  I know it's annoying, but we got a story to tell, ya know?"
---
"I'm calling security, Johnson."
---
If you hadn't already downloaded the classics, the lock out prevents you from downloading them. 
---
... I'm tempted top do it tbh lol. Reading comments of people trying to defend 76 and by extension Bethesda is more painful.
---
Coming to an Atom store near you October 2102
---
FO76 dies slowly but continuously. At release times and afterwards I would not have thought that the negative atmosphere would sweep me along like an avalanche. I myself have lost the desire to play and FO76 is orphaned on my computer. I will turn to other titles where the community is really taken seriously and not just for appearances.

A gear or cogwheel is a rotating machine part having cut teeth, or in the case of a cogwheel, inserted teeth, which mesh with another toothed part to transmit torque. Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source.¬†Wikipedia.

Just because more than one company does something stupid doesn‚Äôt make it acceptable... Say Bethesda and EA slap you in the face, are you really going to be happy letting Activision and all other companies slap you too because the first two got to do it? The more people stop speaking out like you seem to want, the more anti consumer BS that will happen. 
---
Yeah, it happens, not much you can do about it...
---
What‚Äôs an appropriate amount to craft?
---
Tens, hundreds thousands millions?
---
How much did you have when you were locked out?
---
I craft all the time and pitch to vendors, 10s? not sure I‚Äôm up to the volume you are
---
Not till i get 3840x1080!
---
Not even "fanbois" enjoy pointless grinding.
---
Wait a sec it turns into a meat pile
---
I know right!
---
Makes no difference what team pushes Atom store stuff. They can put it on hold and use it later.
---
Hell, if its a different team lets move that team onto fixing the game! Not one bug so far on the majority of the Atom store stuff funnily enough!
---
There's not much the OP can do about it. 
---
The devs on the other hand...
---
And there ain't no place he's going to
---
I think the community manager is a chat bot or at least is undistinctable from one

Bingo!  Upvoted.   People love to start false rumors for some strange reason.  (Credit card numbers leaked, 1 shotting pacifists)
---
If you don't want to use a medic's gun just use a flamer to heal your team and a plasma or Tesla rifle to deal damage to foes. You can get bear arms to reduce the weight of all of those weapons and get batteries included to reduce the weight of their ammo.
---
Well apparently this post was sarcastic, anyways my point still stands. 
---
Bethesda are not true fans tbh
---
Griefing is the only end game left after they nerfed everything. Sorry you just became pray.....
---
Lol, we need clean versions of underwear, also, I was pertaining to Vault 69 where there was 1 man and 999 women. ;)

Billy "Long Neck" Lesowski over there
---
The only people that think this game is still salvageable are employees and paid sponsors of Bethesda. 
---
I've quit playing on PS4 and have gone back to RD2 And FO4. My fiance hasn't played on PC since the first patch that ruined her game and made it unplayable and super pixelated. 
---
With the PS4 I can maybe sell it to someone that hasn't had the headache of the servers constantly freezing on loading, but the PC version we're stick with a broken game that will never be played because Bethesda screwed their customers over at ever step of this game. 
---
You are correct, there is not much the OP can do about it, the Devs will do nothing about it.
---
I have corrected my statement...
---
It really means a lot to hear you say that, thanks man.
---
I'm not. I stopped trying to craft 308 long ago. the bundles of 12 are hardly worth the time spend gathering steel. when I did, I'd be in full unyielding for super duper. I remember this one time I crafted so many I thought I was going to be banned. super duper procced a boatload of times.
---
ended up with 2K in total. you may think that's a lot, but it's pitiful for heavy standards. I'd be swimming in 5mm for comparison, probably north of thirty thousand rounds. doesn't help that, although the drum holds 75 bullets, you'll go through 2K just casually strolling through the forest and going against a group of super mutants.
---
the MG42 is beautiful and goes perfectly with the marine armor. when it performs well, it's better than the .50 cal or gatling. but holy shit, is it expensive. puts Heavy and Sasha, his minigun, to shame.
---
It brings me back to that that interview with the guy talking about you learning to make and selling the best steaks. It‚Äôs like these guys hadn‚Äôt played the game before it came out 
---
Those particular ghouls are only lvl 9, so if you are too high of a level they won't spawn for you anymore (unless they've patched that...or attempted to patch that).
---
I have no problem using stealth. No idea wtf you people are on about. 
---
It's just a generator - 100 Power
---
BRACE!
---
The thing I described above. The game just becomes confused when some of the materials are in your inventory and some are in your stash. As long as you put everything in one place or the other when you craft and repair it should work fine.
---
Nope they dissapear happened with multiple enemies ghouls deathclaws scorched I even tried coming back after doing some other stuff. Oh well we'll have to wait for a patch I guess
---
what? my post has nothing to do with unbanning dupers, i was asking the possibility of myself getting banned since i had picked up (and got rid of) an excess amount of junk  from a duper i killed. 
---
&gt;I do enjoy feeling important on the internet while not being paid for it. 
---
   I think that's spelled 'Impotent' ... not important.  
---
can't do anything about it either :(
---
Has happened since day 1, its random and hard to replicate, things like that tend to get left...
---
Sometimes they just disapear
---
The gift that keeps on giving :)
---
To be fair, Bethesda has relied on community made content since Oblivion. All the game they made were loaded with bugs but nobody, ultimately, gave a damn because modders would fix them and bring new content within weeks with mods.
---
Unfortunately for Bethesda, this time, mods don't work and it shows their incompetency. What you hear the most on this sub is:
---
Why do you fix this or that?
---
Why no new content?
---
Two major things that the modding community took care of on previous game.
---
Yup, fix it and then revert. Rinse and repeat and let's see if the vault population can take it or snap. Gary
---
I'm sure the overseer gets killed at the end of this story much like fallout1. 
---
Damit I cant afford it I have to play 7200 hours to get 20 atoms
---
Agility is full if you take all the pistol perks, no room for anything else fun.
---
A lot left over for strength though, so ya, you can basically run a hybrid melee build, which is neat.
---
Yeah, I can see that
---
I do as well and just entered the Mire and I am struggling hard. Enemies soak up bullets and I get shot a million times before I‚Äôm able to kill anything. After getting shot a million times I have to repair my armor. So I‚Äôm currently wandering around trying to find screws to repair all my gear, I figure in like 10 levels or so it will be a little easier once I get all the repair perks but this is a bit tedious. 
---
Farming for materials/junk is just not fun, it should be a byproduct of exploration not the other way around.
---
I have complained about the store, I have received answers that the money is for dlc, but apparently that money is for fixing errors 
---
Not the ballistic fiber! God, anything but that!

The golfers can spawn outside of the resort itself. I've come across them on the road that runs north to south outside the eastern boundary of the resort, by a crashed army jeep. I was on 9/10 for ages until I walked down that road.
---
You're a fucking video game.
---
It's just a game, FO5 will be real he retorted
---
It's not really the *majority of players* though, it is only those who post on Reddit and a few other gamer site's comment sections that we see complaining, on any subject  the vocal minority will always float to the top of any argument unless you dig deeper to ascertain what people really think, we have no idea what percentage this represents out of the  *player base*. We don't know the current player base either, what I loved about Eve Online was the single server and the actual number of players online was displayed.
---
I never take notice of reviews on gaming sites, they are out for clicks and copy cat their articles for maximum revenue return, there is no honesty in gaming review sites, it's all bottom line ad $$.
---
You may be a 10 year old, none of us know how old we all are, that is irrelevant.
---
Nope fat fingers and a stupid samsung keyboard.
---
Does it still work?
---
It's justified.
---
I noticed that as well. Was wondering why after taking off the patriot skin for my T60 it still had the atomic shop logo on my helmet.
---
Great, another bloviating youtuber that uses reddit  as a news source. That's right yong, take all those shit posters seriously. Yikes@gorgonpistol for even watching this guy.
---
Would've dropped you a nocturnal drill anyway, it actually did you a favor by vanishing.
---
The only person who knows that answer is you.
---
You should try not to let random internet people make up your mind or form opinions for you.
---
Play it and see for yourself. 
---
Thank you, sir!
---
It's good to have personal objectives, alongside the in-game ones, keeps you busy :)
---
Perhaps... I have noticed a surge of players the last few days that just seem to have unlimited bullets
---
Absolutely! The balance needs to be increased, not nerfed.
---
Hmm, perhaps they really need to move some pistol perks over to endurance then?  Like increasing run speed with pistols out?
---
That's how this one started, people wanting Fallout coop :)
---
Well to be honest the Bobby pin thing is because the patch was built on a old build where the weight change hasn't happened. That should not have happened so yeah kinda the devs fault there.
---
you insta-kill 50 mobs, server crashes due to inability to load 50 inventories at once, u get banned lol.
---
Ok 
---
Sounds like I better not play for some time now until they have it all sorted out 
---
yeah i thought highly about cooking team mates with a flamer so ideally i could remove field and strange in numbers for Friendly fire
---
I get enough grief of the 3 women i live with now. 999 of them 24 / 7 i think id go suck a nuke!
---
Atom shop items were likely created a head of time and require little effort to add. Those would most likely be two completely different teams. I can't stand the way they've gone about the shop in general but still 
---
Obviously they're going push the shop hard. It's the only way to continue making money on FO76. You already paid 60 bucks for the game. They're going to put money into what is going to make them immediate cash. 
---
Fixing the game only fixes public opinion which obviously translates to income but as stated in this forum people are still gonna buy Bethesda games in all likelihood.
---
It's obviously frustrating but
---
No, what would be justified us using the rage flooding this sub constructively, instead of posting thinly veiled karma whore posts
---
Yup a story in a terminal predicted fallout 76 outcome
---
Where is Todd? No activity on Twitter since November :)))))) I'd be quite "worried" if it didn't make sense for him to disappear from planet earth. 
---
So people aren't allowed to make mistakes? They've already said they are addressing it.
---
Get over yourself
---
Yeah, honour the cost that we've paid for the game first!
---
Eat your dinner first and, if you've been good, then you can have a treat, Bethesda.
---
Man I still get shit from my friends from getting this game. They told me to wait countless times but a mp fallout world where we can emerge together had me hooked. After the emptiness, bugs, crashes (thankfully no disconnects) I finally just roll with the punches instead of blocking em. I deleted the game and it still leaves a hole in my wallet. Only positive outcome is that this game really steered me away from ever pre-ordering a game ever.
---
Agreed they have to get their shit together, but people can say whatever they want. People can defend Bethesda if they choose. Likewise, banning of bashing threads is wrong as well. Though, I will say that, holy shit people, it's a video game. Yes, we spent hard earned money on it, but it's still a game. Put some of that anger into real issues bothering the world. Take a break from it and do something else instead of putting 1000 hours into something that was released just in November. I think people forget what games are for sometimes-you know, playing.
---
whenever i read their ‚Äúill pass it along‚Äù i imagine a receptionist writing a note and immediately putting it in the trash
---
Nope it's an old problem now that was discussed like 15 hours ago. But yes patch 5 update go bugs!
---
thanks for making this your own blog spot, any other hot takes or "interesting" thoughts?
---
Yep.  I have a sneak build and it never really worked fully before any patch.  
---
Escape Artist never actually took me out of Danger to Cautious or from Cautious to Hidden either.  I always went and hid somewhere to do it.  After a while it would downgrade but it does that without the skill as well (if your not visible to the mob).  
---
I use Escape Artist because of the run speed affect, that does work well.
---
That was a high point of the game for me too. Too bad I dropped my unique weapons long before I discovered that you could upgrade them on the workbenches... üò¢
---
Dumbyhead I‚Äôm gnot a gnelf I‚Äôm gnot a gnoblin I‚Äôm a gnome and you‚Äôve been gnomed

Just check ebay and you'll have your answer lol
---
Same for me. 2 or 3 guns always out. 
---
It always happens with handmades fir me. I have 3 of them. 2 are always out of the wheel since the last patch. Maybe it is because of the same weapon type. 
---
marine combat arms at lewisburg station
---
" What are your priorities?" money, they're greedy, as EA, Activision and Ubi - they don't give a f... about the until atoms are sold for real money. Wait, soon they'll introduce items that will boost actual gameplay, not only cosmetics...
---
Yes you are my hero
---
Didn't stay long enough to give you another flare gun? Bummer. I'm sure the queen will have one for you
---
The first time I went camping, I was really excited. I grabbed all my stuff out of my parent's van and hurriedly closed the hatch. I didn't see the other Boy Scout standing beside me. The hatch door took the boy's head clean off. 
---
YongYea warning.
---
Pointless is the keyword. I personally don't mind grinding but it has to be rewarding. There has to be some progress. 
---
I'm a big fan of this game, but I feel like I have to also take the critical position sometimes to try and make the game better, and sometimes my attitude is unfair and I know they have a tough job. Fanbois will argue and defend against any criticism. They are oblivious to any problems and even in denial sometimes if they too are experiencing the problems yet say everything is fine. That's not good for a game. Game developers need to know what is causing the players frustration. What is making them unhappy. What is making them mad. Etc.
---
This all f\*ck up could be the theme of a Vault.
---
Maybe a 100% should stop playing the game so Bethesda can get their shit together. 
---
Well as a non-chem user the impact is minimal to me anyway.   Just annoying.  
---

Gamers have always been there to make Bethesda games work properly for them. Their games have always had bugs and glitches. I've had to quit playing FONV and FO3 and Oblivion because the game would freeze after five minutes of game play due to how much loot i stashed.

4. workshops and workbenches no longer recognize bulk junk for use.  I have to break down the bulk junk in order to use it in any workbench, crafting, or building for my CAMP or claimed workship.  Example, even though I have over 300+ aluminum in bulk aluminum, the workbench says I only have a handlful of aluminum to repair my weapons. Its only recognizing the scrap junk.  If I bulk it, its like its gone.   But I can find it within my stash.  This is for all junk types, not just alumunium.  This began with the latest patch on Jan 28th.
---
5. n/a  
---
At least it's not EA...  I was one of the ME3 haters who played it when it first came out.
---
Doesn't matter.
---
They continue to ask for money for a broken product. Which team does what makes no difference to us the end users. They can carry on working on Atom store stuff, re introduce it when the game works. People would drop more cash on Atom's then than they do now that's for sure.
---
Its all about the companies priorities and ethical stance.
---
If Bethesda are relying on Atom store sales to keep the lights on for a game that was a basic rip from a previous game we are in a worse position than we think.
---
I'm working through I think the last few side quests and achievements then I'm done, will find something else to play......... 
---
Just to point out - the ticket number is in the screenshot he posted - #190130-003260.
---
Again, we are not bashing the devs but the management! I appreciate how hard you are defending the devs but you are completely off topic, friend.
---
I'm strapping myself to the cone
---
My char specialises in plasma, missiles and explodey things.  I've been around MMO's, it was obvious a nerf was incoming for TSE.  I picked the worst guns in the game for a reason. Then what did they just do? Yup nerfed the demo perk.  You think TSE players have a reason to be salty... 
---
I would literally work in my free time to write fixes for this game. I'm a developer and it would be great for my CV.
---
I'd happily sign disclosures saying that my work belongs to Bethesda as long as I was also protected likewise from any responsibility.
---
Thank you 
---
Should've seen this server pre-launch. So many "true-fans" this subreddit was considered a joke
---

i just dont understand how we have to appreciate someone for going to reddit top posts and reading outlines (and sometimes fixes) for problems they didnt find and passing them along. 
---
its like praising the person at the fast food window for bridging the gap between you and the guy making your hamburger.

They also said that about everything kinda the new bethesda slogan. And that was a mistake a qa team should have caught get over yourself.

Holly cow. I did same with the handmade, when, after pach finally got the plan at level 78! And will do same  until learn the suppressor mod. 
---
Will be banned? Dont care, will have more spare time to do more proper things in life, than waiste time on this addictive game!
---
They're fixing it, was listed as known issue
---
Yep, there‚Äôs no guarantee every kill will result in a drop. Don‚Äôt recall Beth ever stating that..?
---
They said they would be offering free DLC before the game launched and had no way of knowing how much they would make from the Atom store.
---
Continuing to sell items in a game that is so broken is wrong. Unless of course Bethesda's priorities are cash &gt; customers.
---
I'm not defending anyone. I'm calling you out for cashing in on the outrage
---
Monster Hunter World pulled me away from 76, I will keep checking on it but, for now my frustration level is higher than my enjoyment level with it

---
That‚Äôs honestly not a whole lot better. 
---
Great post! Nice to see a positive message!
---
And when they aren‚Äôt lvl 40 they are level 9 dropping level 5 equipment.  I have only found one hunter rife that wasn‚Äôt level one and i‚Äôm lvl 23.
---
Done....
---
Yeah surprise the real game is rage 2 people that's the one we will get right and if that wrong we always have starfield which all share the same engine and script engine which means they will be pros at fixing bugs.
---
the worst is when you kill them and they remain in an abstract position unable to obtain loot envy of any artist 
---
It‚Äôs funny they got so specific in nerfing TSE as to remove only the stacking ability of explosive bobbleheads but were unspecific enough to nerf two shot as collateral 
---
I assume they were looking for a justification to nerf it all and make the game more of a grind 
---
That is definitely on their end, my internet is almost the highest speed available and I'm directly connected to the router. I've played a ton of online games and this is by far the most unstable. Thank you for the info, didn't really investigate to see that, also wasn't getting any "Server not responding" pop-ups at all before or after, and after I re-logged to fix it it happened again about 15 minutes later.
---
you forgot a very important question: should legendaries be allowed in pvp servers?
---
And I actually do that. I do believe that the person receiving my hamburger order often has to put up with lots of rudeness of other people who think that they are better beings because they do not take burger orders. I try to counter that and always be super nice and friendly to those people.
---
You can have that and appreciate that or you can mock that and loose that.
---
Are/were you using any mods? I know of at least one mod that would cause this (though now I forget which one it was).
---
Glith was even before the last patch. For me it was fixed with waiting for about 5 mins. And respawn location near death spit appeared.
---
Not the lack of loot, the bodies vanish almost instantly, no meat pile or anything, it happens but it's not intentional....
---
I already uninstalled, I'm out

At the risk of a DOX, lol, I'm in southern Alberta.

---
I don't know about you but I'm still hanging around Uranium Fever.
---
on a more serious note, at this point it's safe to assume the game won't get much better until they allow private servers and modders to do their job.
---
Which bug do you mean? Are you talking about duplication?
---
So your logic applied. You buy chair, chair breaks first use. "Oh well shit happens"
---
Yeah the fix then break, then fix thing is a whip lash inducing mind screw.  As well as the guessing games with what we can, and cant use of the core game mechanics without getting banned.
---
You are an idiot. Honestly. If there will be no players Beth will just abandon this piece of shit game and you'll have nothing to play with.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more. I appreciate people‚Äôs frustration... BUT it is just a game.
---
Give it to obsidian!!!!!! 
---
But cashing in on what sorry? Karma? Who even gives a damn about Karma? I'm contributing to the bashing as everybody should because staying silent is the exact reason why this kind of sh\*t is happening even though we had countless similar experiences in the past.
---
If you're going to add that, you may as well ask whether or not you should be allowed to bring over existing characters into Survival.
---
Then i will play just another game lol. 
---
Could we please just focus on finding Todd? Last seen on Twitter in November. AFAIK he might be lost, scared and hungry in a dark sewer with the demogorgon 
---
At this point I think it should be TSE only in the servers..no real risk of getting killed by those RN.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
Yeah a internal road map has ideas and isn't flushed out a public one is basically this is what we are doing and this is what youcam expect

I thought that was weird finding the blue case full in Watoga. But since reading this i guess i need to pass the favor on myself. Thanks for the tip and a good read cause i farm White Springs now then and i leave my legendarys for someone else or while in Watoga.

I want to know how to make a ragstag hang upside down from the ceiling and spin at the entrance to whitesprings golf club I saw that about a week ago

I am  but its because I really, REALLY don't want to run in to anymore fragile gamers in the wasteland. A few things don't go your way and its just hours and hours of complaining, boarder lining an OCD like behavior.
---
Until he signs on post update.....realizes can't stack duped bobbles.....resubmits
---
"I was just being sarcastic!" Yeah alright. Nice try my guy 
---
Yes, I heard that the melee oriented perk actually increases gun speed too?  Forgot what its called.  I plan on dropping the 2/3 levels of the perks already (1 point for 5% damage).  However bloody mess is actually the exact same (1 point for 5% damage).  Sure, bloody mess works with all weapons, but I only carry 1 gun with 1 melee anyway.    So trading extra damage on melee for easier to find corpses.
---
I have no perks at all for melee weapons yet my vampire grognaks will work in a pinch if out of ammo or low.  its just too heavy for a 2 strength build IMO.  I will probably get out my trusty black diamond again with +1 strength and 3 lbs (end result is its weightless).
---
Good idea.  I'd be for pvp servers if they fixed the train wreck that is slap damage/workshop contests /newbie griefing in adventure mode. But no word on that. 
---
It‚Äôs not against the rules, so they should be allowed to play the game how they wish.
---
Yet the game is still shit. But good job replying! Lul
---
Bodys are vanishing I think they may have done it to increase server stability and this is an unintended consequence
---
Goose, golden egg scenario ring any alarm bells... 
---
Okay who's for sandwiches?

Wait - is this chicken?

Yeah that‚Äôs a pain in the arse.

what's that, oh a post that has nothing to do with the game. #CRYFORSHITPOSTERS

You are gonna love the shit outta Bioshock. Just try not to have an aneurism at the end of Infinite :D (which is absolutely my fave of the series btw). One of the best series of all time.

And forgive my ignorance, but what's BL?
---
One thing I find surprising is that there are a lot of people so far that are unhappy that there is even a PvP restriction-free Survival mode.
---
It has no bearing on PvE players and in fact it might get the hardcore PvP players off your back. Sounds like a win-win to me.

Well are you playing or on reddit and forums
---
"Anyone not enjoying the game I am enjoying should not play this game! You should not complain about something you yourself own."
---
Yeah I heard that crafting and breaking items for mods are causing a algorithm to think they are mass crafting to crash the server. Resulting in players getting a ban email.
---
Yeah we stopped playing because we did everything worth doing and there's not much in the way of endgame content. We launched nukes, killed SBQ, and farmed some decent legendaries.
---
I'm watching patches to see if they can pull me back but when I read that they killed all my Two Shot weapons and nerfed my Demolitions Expert perk because of shitty dupers... then nerfed condition perks... and the auto grenade launcher still isn't a big gun for carrying weight purposes... I'll pass.
---
They really lost their way on this one. This game is a product of being entirely beholden to your stockholders. FO76 was not made for us. The devs are certainly not proud of this. Nobody who likes this franchise had any decision making authority. I didn't have high expectations but they just keep making the game more miserable. 
---
Preach! I've been playing with a friend since launch. Even though we're playing on our second characters now, we still find new things to do, as well as content that we missed with our first characters. No session has been boring so far - even if we just spend an hour doing something pointless but fun, like dropping grenades and mines from the monorail elevator while the other one tries to shoot them out of the sky, followed by jumping off of the monorail elevator repeatedly for shits and giggles. Or earlier this week, we followed other players through the asylum - one of us dressed as an asylum worker wielding a drill, the other one as a clown with a fastnacht mask wielding a sledgehammer.
---
I see that there are other players who are worried about the lack of endgame content. My first character is lvl 80 now and I can't be bothered with endgame content just now. I'm more invested in the lore of the game - I read terminal entries and notes. I listen to every holotape I come across. I try to piece together the story of a location that I found while exploring. The game is not a linear path from leaving the vault to (repeatedly) beating the scorchbeast queen. I don't have the best possible gear and I don't mind becasue it keeps the game challenging.
---
Yes, the issues with the game are annoying and the development has been an utter mess so far. But I also understand that there's no point in me being the 1200th person to rant about it online because I have real problems to worry about. 
---
Not sure there will be anyone left to tell us if it's good or not...
---
I'll boot the game up in a year and see the state of it
---
Until then, no thanks. I tried to get into, my wife tried to get into....it's just not a good game and not fallout
---
This. 
---
no one is saying that they can‚Äôt, people are saying to not be a dick (especially to low levels) 
---
griefing a level 60 is far different from griefing a level 17, it literally just makes the game a lot less enjoyable and gives new players the thought of this community being toxic (more than LoL probably)
---
people pretty much are saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be mean to low levels‚Äù n stuff
---
I need they can easily make a new character get the caps on that character and still sell stuff but what they should do is make them unable to trade anything at all so those over weight of like millions in some are just useless 
---
Well yes sir can I have some more!
---
Google slippery slope. They are testing the water. 
---
I will make an example here:
---
At what degree you think will start pay to win?
---
15 hp you said no. How about 16? 17? 18? Why that 1 hp difference makes the difference? By the time you noticing it. It probably at adding 200hp. 
---
It's meant to motivate you into creating a new account and buying the game again in order to create a feeling of accomplishment.
---
It's called comic relief, Google it, also calm down a bit, you seem hyped on Jet.... :-)
---
should be a question as well, yeah.
---
i wish i had the option to not do my JOB when people hurt my feelings.
---
I just kicked my dog because they nerfed pick locking 
---
Did you need both perl cards?
---
Anthem mixed with a little Total War for me. 
---
I thought had the majority of plans before the known tag. Oh how wrong was I, started with 16k caps and by the time I‚Äôd gone to all vendors I was sitting on just under 2k caps lol
---
I do a similar build with about the same special as yours, with shotguns as my spec'd weapon. I've found flexibility to be key, as different groups may have different needs, so I swap in perks as needed to fit the current team (or when I'm solo). I'm not intending on mutations, so I haven't allocated for starched genes nor class freak.   
---
[Here's my build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c35e985&amp;d=cf2ck0ev2ih2ew0ep0sb2pe2sg2a00lt2cq0cc1sd0so0sp0su2as2s72i12e10e40er0lb1ao0id2ci0cl0cm0&amp;w=c62ei1p10pa0p80p90l90lm2at1i30ic4ia0if2ik0i50iq2ie2c72c52cg0cj0cr0ct0cu0ce0e00ah0&amp;n=Corpsman%20Up), fwiw: 
---
You aren't getting a higher stat. You also don't have to pay for it.
---
More serious boosts and OP items. For real money, of course...
---
It's a feature. Finally a fast vehicle in Fallout
---
wait for a pvp mode, when people wanted pvp content 
---
Yeah and unlike EA aren't publically traded so they don't have to release a game every quarter what happened with this recent patch was a mistake but everyone acts like it was the worst thing known to man.
---
Yeah I'm just whining on reddit hehe.
---
That's funny because one of my threads just got up and ran away
---
She'd get him to do that after he put the bins out
---
I agree, I don't feel they are ignoring us outright, but I at least would be ignore the hate posts about a bug, the ones that just swear and rant over it but not give a breakdown of what happened. I would put the issue on our shoulders as players, we need to upvote bugs that are well described and treat the devs with a modicum of respect,as you said they are trying to help.
---
yeah. and this explosive/two shot nerf was the biggest mistake ever. it's okay to nerf but not in this scale. a overall 50% nerf would be enough. you are going to loose a lot of players. rip bethesda
---
No they need to put the game out in f it's misery and focus on other projects. It's over its dead they can't come back from this it's time to cut losses. Bethesda Fallout 76 us a fast lure it's time to write it off the books. Close the servers. 
---
Since the duping thing started I just record everything with Shadow play just in case. so something like this happens I'll just send them like a 12 gig file of me playing the game they can figure it out themselves.
---
I wish that were a joke, but think about it like this. I can spend 800 atoms on a silly lamp.. or spend $6 on an OP weapon.
---
Honestly, if it was something cooler than the silly hat, it might be a harder choice.
---
yeah.  i started a 2nd character.  1st one was pure melee.  the only reason i had a gun was to be able to shoot at SB and QSB to get my share of loot and XP.  when i started the 2nd character, my intent was to play a charismatic sniper.  now i can not play my character as i want, because i am constantly out of .308 ammo, or busted weapon / armor.  so instead of sniping high level creatures from afar, i spend 90% of my time scavenging.
---
BAH!!  would much rather sit in my CAMP, sniping super mutants that come walking up I64!!  L MFAO
---
Because it‚Äôs a slippery slope. You said no to 15 now how about 20 next time? At what hp addition you think will be pay to win? 200? How about 199? No? 198? What‚Äôs the 1hp difference between yes pay to win and no it‚Äôs not. 
---
They've burned through any and all good faith the community had left. The deafening silence after this atrocious patch says everything we need to hear. They have absolutely no clue how to handle this mess, they're panicking trying to fix it and the result is that they are somehow making it even worse for those that haven't officially thrown the towel in yet. When you have a product that is struggling the last thing you want to do is piss off the die-hard fans, the ones clinging onto hope that things will improve through almost every bad decision they're faced with and that's what the last patch has done.
---
To massively nerf repair perks when the underlying issue of paper-mache weapons and armour still exists is insulting. Adding even more grind and maintenance to the game of what was already largely about farming materials for upkeep is unforgivable to me. Congratulations, Bethesda. You turned a shiny suit of fully modded X-01 into the wooden armour you're so keen to force on us every other legendary drop.
---
Happens aaaaaall the time, even before the patch.
---
Thats one reason why i stopped playing. I cant play a Chameleon Build when i cant Sneak Attack
---
Legendary enemies are just broken. If it's a robot, half the time they dont explode. The legendary prefix doesn't always show for certain types of ghouls. Sometimes enemies regen, sometimes they dont. And sometimes killing them drops a legendary, and sometimes they don't.
---
Well consider this, can you go through an entire fight without using a stim?  If yes, then better off with healing factor.  If your constantly using stims during fights? Then perhaps.  
---
But there is a perk that gives +healing with stims if you want to give up another perk.  It would totally offset the penalty.
---
Radaway not such a big deal because I have rad arch at my camp.  Using a few extra does not impact me too much.
---
Are these the same people who comment on posts on facebook when they‚Äôre unfollowing a page, etc? Because it‚Äôs hilarious.

Well... They're gonna do what makes them money. If you want them to value their customers their needs to be an incentive. I already said they're gonna make money any way. So yeah they obviously don't give a shit. They're getting enough praise when they put patches out for them to change their pace or priorities. Even though they're "fixing" dozens of things it's mostly stuff that didn't appear broken to the outside. 
---
It isn't the primary funding. It just will become that over time so it's gonna be a priority. I was mainly saying that it's a lot of cosmetic shit that shouldn't effect bug fixes. Sure they could halt atom shop graphic designers from continuing. What then immediately hire programmers?
---
Possible but unlikely
---
It just ain't gonna be "ethical" bud this is capitalism. 
---
Look at it this way, at least Bethesda is keeping a bunch of people who are terrible at software from working somewhere they could do real harm. Would you want to wake up in hospital one day and see BETHESDA on the machine you're wired up to?  Would you want them writing air traffic control software?? No.  Keep playing FO76, KEEP BETHESDA ALIVE, or pay the price when a patch causes your local nuclear power plant to explode because they ooopsied some old code in. 
---
Had an issue that remove once a weapon then my Hunter Hood from my inventory, may has happend when I picked up my junk bag sometimes it places an item from my inventory in the bag while I'm grabing it and it destroye the item ?
---
ig : Coffeefrenchtoast
---
From the beginning they've said that the game will be moddable at some point, and anything that is helpful for the studio's developers are also/will also be helpful for modders working on the game. Thus they leave it in. Yes, they should have been more careful about allowing access to it (e.g., make the game in non-developement mode or some such teleport players out of it or something like that), but leaving the room in is not the major fuckup that some apparently want it to be.
---
i haven't played this game for a while because it got too boring for me... even being low level and still having regular quests...
---
maybe im gonna pick it up this weekend and give it another chance. but i'm even considering modding to make it more fun... never thought i'd say this. :(
---
it's just not a game for me cause i hate grinding. doesn't make sense to me to play a videogame then, can spend my time better in real life.
---
I have to ask. is there some kind of "Im right no matter what" pill you take in the morning? How do you delude yourself into being right about ANYTHING when you're too ignorant to be wrong? Are facts meaningless and the only thoughts you have are incoherent strands of random band aids to prevent your brain from awakening and realizing *it has no potential living this way*? Is effort and objective conversation so horrifying? Was spelling really that hard in 4th grade that you just gave up?
---
A decked out X01 that too forever to set up lol
---
I agree, that hovering name should vanish, or at least be transparent but visible up close, like 10-15 feet away in direct line of site. Hell, the way the camo field is you can see the player when that close anyway.
---
Yeah, I probably would. I'd probably push for upper management to do something about it and try my damndest to better the situation for everyone.
---
When my project is extremely flawed because my project manager rushed me, I sit there and watch them cry until they help fix the mess they made (better pay or whatever plus a response that doesn't throw me under the bus).
---
Ya kinda are my dude. These project managers and execs need to learn their damn lesson. They can only push a Dev team so hard to finish a game. Most are questioning upper management with the few truly toxic assaulting the devs. The devs know they've done right, and whose fault it really is.
---
And they also pushed forward more merchandise and monetization, along with breaking some shit. One step forward, two steps back. We know where their minds are at, and they need to know we don't like that shit. The game should at the very least been this decent from LAUNCH. 
---
But it speaks a clear message, and will encourage others to do the same instead of just making do with a lackluster shitshow of a money grab.
---
these threads are just as common as the "i quit" threads.
---
Can still one shot glowing ones without batting an eye. Has nothing to do with TSE. They're just soft and people are assholes.
---
Except you are told to kill the queen, it doesn't matter if you shoot her toes or head, while with bungie and many other games you are restricted, oh you can't kill this thing by shooting it's head even if you have a nuclear warhead, because you have to hit it's toe 5 times first. That's what I'm getting at, and if you don't see that then I guess this conversation is over. 
---
Hahahahahaha yeah I gave up after not being able to load in.
---
Ok. So far in my initial reviews. One is copy pasta and the other has an actual image. Both are after the patch. And Bethesda has already reached out to both of them. The common thread among these two is that they  both have alt accounts and it seems they uses them as mules. Apparently one has multiple level 100 alts. I believe more investigation is needed, but I can‚Äôt conclude that they are playing as intended at this time.
---
Agreed..... but right after they cap the strength bonus to melee damage.
---
For a all-in-one build bloody mess is very usefull even with just 5% dmg per poing because you don't need to swap cards and you usually switch between ranged and melee on the fly for example when the scorchbeast queen lands. I personslly hate switching perks snd rather havd both damagd snd confort on my setup. I even play with lockpiking perks on and only switch to glow sight when doing whitespring runs.
---
Well yes :)
---
I have lost full excavator armor minus left leg :/
---
Yup, not the dupe exploits.
---
I mean the Blueprint duplication that copies whatever blueprints for your camp you have stored multiple times. It is also possible to dupe items unintentionally by crafting to quickly and servers kicking you out / crashing at the same time.
---
These are Bethesda issues and people shouldn't be banned for them.
---
Yes... It is. It's a company. Youre only a fan until you have money to spend. Then you're a customer.
---
I put it on a concrete base and it wound up one floor above where I placed it, onto a spot with a wooden base. For a while it would end up floating above me when I put it down.
---
Probably are people like me who are unhappy about it. It's going to have leaderboards and you can bring in your current character. These are bad ways to have a survival mode. I would rather see fresh spawns only and when you die, you die. A mode like this would be fun to play and to watch. What they're implementing is more of a deathmatch style game and i have a hard time seeing how it could be fun. I hope it is and I guess we will see over time. 
---
Hey, you've got the croquet mallet skin for your sledgehammer, no complaining! ;P
---
I did "follow their rules", the rules were changed on me mid way. I only purchased the game in the first place after checking that I would be able to store an unlimited amount of loot on a mule.
---
I have unlimited storage on other survival games.
---
Am I to take from your reply that there's no plans to have the storage options (or an alternative) that existed at the launch of the game when I purchased it and that I only purchased based on that information?
---
Still sounds like your guilty
---
101 : how to shoot yourself in the foot, then in the head and finally in the back.
---
At least now we can expect a lot of new mods for previous games ^^M
---
I will assume Bethesda‚Äôs apology will look something like this 
---
&gt; ‚Äûdue to circumstances we will reschedule the big content update to October‚Äú
---
The superior siege weapon!

"I'm a salty salt boy because now I have to try"
---
Nah it's just now it takes that much more to kill anything! 
---
well progress was carried over, but the challenges were not there until after launch and I would guess that no info that would apply had anywhere to be saved for the challenges.
---
&gt;  Many of RNG loot tables deriving from when a player opens a chest are based off a Dev room chest with the entirity of possible items.
---
This is not how these games (76, FO4, TES5, ‚Ä¶) work though. There are lists in the SeventySix.esm data file for loot tables. You can inspect them using [FO76Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/30).
---
I had a 3 star enemy vanish on me when it died today also. I hit alt-f4 and came here to read how shit this game is. Made me feel a bit better.. but some loot would have been better.
---
The bearing on PvE players is that Bethesda is wasting time making it when there's not enough content in the game proper. And when the PvP players whine about OP methods it's going to affect everyone else because there's a snowballs chance in hell Bethesda is even competent enough to pull of segregated PvP/PvE balancing.
---
I have played all of them, fallout 1-2 are the reason post apocalyptic games are my favourite and I give practically all of them a shot. I already said why I think it's good, so if you read my post you wouldn't have to make any assumptions. 
---
Eh, level 45 Black Diamond is superior IMO.  Equipping it not only is weightless but gives a couple extra pounds.  Plus does better base damage.
---
I know the comparison is between level 25 vs level 45, but not seen a level 45 Meteoritic Sword.  Sure you get the PVP stat, but I dont PVP.

I take my hat off to the community for sticking with the game I couldn't, I played for 10-20 hours and deleted it truly awful I'm totally done with Bethesda and I will never buy another Bethesda product that was the last time they fleece me for ¬£60..... 
---
As it stands ill be buying pre owned / pirating any Bethesda game from here on in. Cancelled my Rage 2 pre order's a week or so back already.
---
I don't condone piracy but at least with pirates i know what I'm getting and my money wont find it's way to Bethesda shareholders.
---
Huh?
---
I know what slippery slopes are. It's a fallacy. They're central to the idea that this "issue" is even worthy of mention because "look at how far we can slide!".
---
Here, I'll take your advice.
---
&gt;**Slippery Slope**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;*(also known as absurd extrapolation, thin edge of the wedge, camel's nose, domino fallacy)*  
---
&gt;Description: When a relatively insignificant first event is suggested to lead to a more significant event, which in turn leads to a more significant event, and so on, until some ultimate, significant event is reached, where the connection of each event is not only unwarranted but with each step it becomes more and more improbable.  Many events are usually present in this fallacy, but only two are actually required -- usually connected by ‚Äúthe next thing you know...‚Äù

In other words, the idea that this little event will lead to pay-to-win mechanics IS the fallacy.

Let's cry wolf when we see wolves and not because we're so scared that there may be wolves out there.

If you craft 300 boards in a short time I'm sure the account t gets flagged. When on god's green Appalachia would you need to make 300 boards....um for duping duh.
---
Here is an idea, why dont they contract hire these modders to come in as a team temporary for a decent amount of pay and work along side the devs in getting these issues fixed?
---
Idk, I've been saying (for so long I'm about to ban myself from this sub to stop being a stick in the mud) that so many of these changes were clearly made to entice a room of directors and investors, not to create a marketable product.
---
This is Bethesda realizing that you can't sell people shit just because you're a popular company, and then realizing that nobody really markets to cheaters AND noobs in one fell swoop. This is kinda genius tbh. They don't give a fuck about what we want to see in the shop, they just want to push sales because income on this game has/is tanking.
---
You can use this time to go take a writing class!
---
&gt; why the hell would the dev room still be left in a game
---
Because that way 3rd party/community devs (modders) will also have access to it when they start supporting modding/modded servers.
---
If you are looking for a chill experience on PC with accepting people send a friend request to FnordBear. I can introduce you to some other chill guys that will trade with you, kit you out, help you build, give you protection, and only for the cost of camaraderie and friendship.

What about items locked in chest? Can't remove some items for some reason.
---
Please go easy on the CMs, though. None of this is their fault, they don't have any other tools than to give infomation back and forth. If the information is false or not headed, there's nothing they can do. In most cases their team leader is not even in the room when decisions are made. And the reward they get for this is the anger of us fans, including sometimes out of the line personal attacks and insults.
---
This is the mess of management and project leads, not the grunts on the front.
---
No idea why anyone would ask for nerfs
---
There‚Äôs a glitch with the escape artist perk and the chameleon mutation combination as well that makes you appear permanently invisible on your screen, but you aren‚Äôt actually invisible to any other players though. Been trying to draw attention to it since before Christmas but Bethesda aren‚Äôt fixing it. 
---
So at what hp addition you think is pay to win?
---
I'm not buying that man. I have two shot weapons with out explosive and with explosive perks, The damage still wrecks. 
---
I dont think so buddy. There is a guy who is stuck on God mode and still hasn't got banned. Even asked devs to fix him.
---
Nope, still very strong.
---
\~Pete Hines
---
No need to be upset
---
At least they have some input about the game.   You know since this is what this sub is about. 
---
This post is just you bitching about someone bitching.  
---
Yeah there has been no real proof other then a copy paste email and the persons word and i don't trust people's wordd on this sub reddit.
---
At release i was undecided but went with hype - that was my bad. Looked for something to play between path of exile leagues. With harsh beginnings i hoped that after month or two things will go better. Now looking at everything im sad. I feel i lost money, i lost trust to company and probably i will not come back to any fallout game any more. Its shame becaue all previous fallouts were great, they were big part of my childhood and my older times. I hope people responsible for such fiasco will answer for it and company/fallout will get better. Unfortunatelly not with me old firend. I wish everyone good luck and hope we will see something great in this new post "nuclear" 76 world
---
what the hell?
---
Kill a stingwing and you can make a fallout 76 turducken!
---
...magnum
---
Agreed, I am just willing to take the hit on loss of melee damage over hard to find corpse pieces.  Plus running a crit build, so use those spots for other stuff dealing with AP and crit.
---
I usually bring about 3k ammo to SBQ fights and my 200% durabilty handmade can make it to the end of the fight without melee. (gunsmith equipped)
---
To late the copied pasted it to rage 2 and starfield....duh
---
No, its not fine. Melee can one shot stuff since beta with garbage weapons and with regular legendaries they can destroy the queen.
---
Its not fine. Either nerf melee too or fix TSE to be useful again because guns in this game are a joke.
---
Technically, their first game as a studio never actually released
---

How the fuck is people clicking a button too fast a ban-able offense?  It is literally how your game is designed, Bethesda.  If you don‚Äôt want people crafting too fast then put up a bullshit progress bar or a hidden 1 second cool down on the button like every mmo since 1995.  Jesus.
---
Your developers HAVE played video games before, right?
---
farm for decent stuff. seriously.
---
I didn‚Äôt know people still play this game lmao
---
This one time when I was 7, I decided to run away from home. I filled a small suitcase with plastic tools and Fruit Rollups. The man who lived in my closet told me what time the bus would pick me up. So, I went to the bus stop and waited. Sure enough, the bus arrived at the right time. But, the driver called the police and they took me home. On the ride home, I thought about the man in my closet. I thought about the way he'd always sneak into my parent's room at night and stare into my mom's mirror, putting on her lipstick over and over again, till it was caked all over his face.
---
It's the internet. Where everything is false rumors
---
Well I was more implying that your base doesn't really need defending in nms, the only times I've died in nms (survival mode) is from straying away too much and environmental hazards (well apart from killing myself with the grenades before I started taking em off my multi tools haha) 
---
50% of the people whining already don't play the game.  Unfortunately many of the rest of us work in related industries or even in professional software development and have a special appreciation for the difficulties that Bethesda face, and how badly they are screwing it up.   If the company I worked for operated like this, we wouldn't have mobile phones. At all. 
---
Give up on Bethesda, in all likelihood the studio that is trying to curate 76 is newly acquired and very inexperienced. The part of Bethesda that actually has history and experience with the creation engine is out of the picture and the people working on it now have no clue how to deal with creation.
---
Not OP. The guy who is being referred to in the comment above mine. 
---
TSE actually made the game more fun. Would have quit weeks ago if not for those weapons. After the patch I tested out and didn't bother logging in again. My 50 cal became a joke. Used to have fun in AWOL armaments event, now with a full clip I could barely dmg a freaking gutsy.
---
I really hope someone explains how the rad-worms bug happened.  Bethesda manage to make the craziest bugs.
---
Yep happens to me all the time, getting fucking sick of re-equiping every time I re-enter my PA.
---
It's a known bug that Bethesda knows about but doesn't care enough to fix it 
---
You cant legit carry 200 weapons with nothing in your inventory. 
---
Right you can get alot of caps by events. But some of us can't play a few a hours a day. Maybe once or twice a week. And us who have no time have all this junk and items to sell, but hardly anyone to sell it too. It's a chore to jump from event and station just to buy these plans at these prices.
---
PvPers i meet tend not to care, they'll never spend a dime. It's the hardcore cheaters, that elitist demographic, that's going to spend real money to be the best. GTA never got them to spend money because they had infinite resources, elitists on CS might buy skins but nobody is ponying up for a purely cosmetic skin on a game they won't sink 1000 hours into.
---
Then Bethesda adds essentially pay-to-win advantages in the shop and it goes to hell.
---
Also forgot Rad-X is reduced as well. 
---
How many people?
---
False. 
---
1. I actually like the content in FO76. Once you get over the conceit that everyone is dead, what‚Äôs there is decent. The mistress of mysteries quest line is an interesting tragedy to discover. 
---
2.  There is *measurably* less content in FO76 than FO4. To the tune of 3-4 times less content. 
---
You do know its not a permanent buff right?  It will be gone in the next three days.
---
And then once i've spent the money with them and the product isn't fit for purpose am i no longer a customer or a fan?
---
Why are you so dense? You can pay for a temporary stat increase. Yes or no?
---
Wait 
---
Are you saying that the I quit threads are common?
---
Or that my post requesting quitters to stop posting quit notices, are common?
---
I struggle with sensing sarcasm in written form lolz
---
i say thanks too, but im not praising someone for doing their job.
---
not all jobs are glorious or pleasant, especially when customers with anger and frustration are involved. 
---
i doubt the solution is people going around proposing everyone just be nice to each other. 
---
This.
---
You mean there no more over powered range weapons right? 
---
To be fair Bethesda never claimed that dead enemies wouldn't just glitch into nowhere.
---
Trash the frame and get a new one üëç
---
I have the same problems. Not every day but sometimes 
---
Grief people. Troll reddit. And maybe they make money playing full time....yeah I'm sorry they are jobless unemployed mainly. 
---
Killed a 3* ghoul last night and got a bloodied assaultron head, think I would have been more happier with the drill
---
LMAO
---
Very good point's! 
---
I go for a medical in a few weeks, if i see Vault-Tec on anything I am out of there!
---
Also, Make EA great again support Bethesda!
---
I‚Äôm here for the comments lolz
---
I‚Äôm not subscribed to this thread and I uninstalled the game but this is pure entertainment 
---
Some of your story sounds pretty fishy, I completely lose any belief in you not duping at the point where you state that you have not duped since you duped...
---
&gt; have not duped since someone asked me to do the artillery one long ago and i didnt know what i was doing when they told me to stay in the inventory screen and grab it when they say to.
---
Ehhh...
---
Lol, no they didn‚Äôt. I misunderstood the point of the OP, but have been corrected. I wallow in my humiliation.
---
422 hours in, most of the time I hunt for rare outfits like the Leather Coat sometimes I hang with my casual friends and we go to the Mire or Cranberry Bog and we bully Super Mutants and Scorched Leaders
---
Right Now, one shot robots in Watoga with A gauss rifle because I need weightless marine armor.
---
I didn't mean it glitches out or anything, I was wearing marine armor but most of it was only welded, but I did the math and it was only counting my armor, not barbarian and the agility equivalent of barbarian. Which sucks because my strength and agility are pretty high
---
Gems like this post why I read this sub even though I don't even own the game. 
---
You do know it's a "small steps method" of implementing more serious and game changing stuff to the Atomic Shop for real money?
---
At the same time melee is one shotting lvl 92 deathclaws since launch. So something is serious off, or the guns are garbage or melee is absurdly overpowered.
---
Maybe just have a proper QA first??
---
I was able to search 2,got like 30 extra caps upon search. Since those, no stash I've found appears with the search option no matter what I do.
---
Well we don't know if it's the majority, not officially and the games industry loves to keep all that shit under wraps, shady fucks and yes, gaming journalism is a joke and honestly almost all forms of news is click baiting and make half assed headers to bring people in, unfortunately it's the norm, what I trust are YouTubers that represent my ideal and pov when it comes to games, they are usually the more critical ones and I feel the ones that can comment on games since they too have ideals they hold games to and praise and scorn them for.
---
As for the age, it is relevant, if you see a comment whining about " SNOWFLAKES" " CRY BABIES" " WHINERS" "FUCKING THIS, STUPID THAT" "REEEEEE" " PEOPLE DONT LIKE THIS AND I DO THEY MUST BE STUPID AND ANYTHING THEY FEEL MATTERS ACTUALLY DOESN'T BECAUSE I DONT CARE ABOUT IT REEEE" and you glance at the age and see it's a kid and realize "oh it's just a kid, they wouldn't know anything about discussions and respecting someone else's stance and bringing forth an actual arguement" you would move on and save yourself a lot of time, age is absolutely relevant
---
This comment reminds me of the scene in Naked Gun when Frank Drebin stands in front of a crowd of onlookers watching an exploding firework factory and he's shouting "Alright move on! Nothing to see here! Please disperse!"
---
So instead of nerfing, is it possible we can cap the amount of health taken by each shot from another player? For instance any weapon with over 250 dmg will only take 25% health. Weapons with lower dmg scale between 5% and 25%. I feel like the logic is sorta already there with how slap dmg is set up. This way no weapons will ever need a nerf. 
---
Also pls let up upgrade the lvl of legendary  items based on our own lvl. 
---
Well, I've read about it yesterday, but some people spend their caps for the plans they've already know, so they can be upset...
---
I have no problem with them, and I don't have any of the shotgun damage perks maxed out (1 star in each, plus bloody mess). They are basically melee firearms though, so if you're using them like rifles, they are going to suck.   
---
Get enforcer, and take out limbs, and you'll seriously increase your fun kneecapping everything.
---
&gt;"not true fans" 
---
Also "entitled" "crybabies" and "whiners."
---
It‚Äôa definitely difficult alone if you want to beat UVHM by yourself but it‚Äôs not impossible. I‚Äôm at lvl62 with Gaige who is easily one of the weakest characters and am currently going through the Tourge‚Äôs campaign of carnage dlc.  
---
I bought the Handsome Collection (Bl2 + all dlc and Bl TPS +all dlc) for ¬£15 second hand and have gotten way over 200 hours out of the game.  
---
I will say that the game is much different to Fo76 though and certainly caters to a niche audience. It‚Äôs pretty much a FPS version of Diablo or a single player/co op Destiny. It isn‚Äôt a game for someone who doesn‚Äôt enjoy repetitive grinding for the best/rarest loot.
---
&gt; boarder lining an OCD like behavior

I'm not exactly familiar with EU laws as I live in the United States.

Please tell me your a youtuber or blogger on fallout 76 bc holy crap bro 760 hour really you played 31 days worth of this game. Lord you need a job or a new job....or maybe I need a new job.

1) PC

2) Lab\_Rat

4) Party Boy/Girl is not multiplying the benefits of alcohol. Recently drank a beer with a +2Str, +2Chr, -1 Int modifier. Additionally I should gain a +2 Luck bonus. Checked my stats pre and post drink and noticed that while I was getting the stat increases, non of the changes were modified by party boy.
---
Way too little way, way too late. This is a dead game guys, you've officially killed Fallout
---
fallout 3 and 4 had mods to sort them out. Just saying lol
---
True. I would still like to try it on my account to see if that is accurate. And maybe bring it to the attention of Bethesda for a possible fix. 
---
I've got a better idea -- you stop playing the game and wait for Bethesda to fix it, other people can keep on playing if they want to.
---
Sigh.
---
It's not the value of HP that matters, it's the situation in which you get that HP that matters.
---
If you can buy a chem on the atom store that you can purchase at any time and use at any time that gives you an HP boost, then we can start discussing pay-to-win. That value could be 1 hp.
---
If it's a temporary event that we may never see again, where the buff isn't tied to the item but wearing it in a team of other people wearing other unique outfits within that range, let's not pretend this is pay to win.
---
You could say that one player making stims sells them to another player for real world money is pay to win. My point isn't whether or not this specific example is pay to win but it's the whole context that matters.
---
In this specific context, it's not pay to win. So relax.
---
Hi there buddy, I'm guessing you're super busy but I hope you see this. There's features in vats that have been totally changed and do not work the same at all: crits seem to recharge much slower, even when trying to proc a crit it seems it doesnt proc half the time you press on the crit button. (i know this one is intended: reduced vats targeting POV). When you kill an enemy thats close in vats, your camera now suddenly looks as high as possible making combat absolutely tedious. And third thing to note, when using concentrated fire, previously wheb engaged in vats, the default limb was Torso. Now the default limb in aiming new targets is the same limb you aimed on the previous target. Now imagine the scenario where you fight a protectron, yao guai and a scorched. They all have different body designs, making swapping between them absolutely hellish. It's litteraly just broken vats. Please look into this, there has been too many changes (mostly unintended) to vats, and I have been playing a vats build since day one. Since Tse's have been nerfed, the only way to deal serious damage is vats crit, but even that doesn't work now. 
---
I quit but just because you asked nicely and tickled my pickle
---
Green thumbs only let you pick 20% of said plant instead of doubling the amount to get in line with other perks and also to prevent it to become a needed card in every build. 
---
I have bad news for you.
---
The only mod available for the Assaultron Blade is learned via plan:
---
Plan: Electrified Assaultron Blade
---
If Bethesda is running on pure Capitalism then it would be nice to hear that from them though?
---
They not man enough to stand by their product or their believes now? Makes them almost as bad as (insert politician / random bad company).
---
The way Todd and Pete were behaving before launch suggested they had some pride in their name and company though. And I mean its not difficult to make a good product and still make profit is it? I mean there's quite a few out there that manage to do both, they just have to want to.
---
They could hire 100 dev's and not sell 1 more item on the Atom store, look at the sales of there other titles. They have more than enough to put this right without asking for more dont they?
---
Rust. 
---
I mean the only reason Fallout 76 exists is because Todd Howard pointed at Rust and said "This is the new hotness that the youth crave. This is our identity now."
---
You know the answer to that question.
---
Yeah, TSE weapons actually made guns viable. Now they are garbage again. If anything it was the TSE that made me and most of my friends to stay playing. We don't give a shit about PvP, we just want to be able to have fun with our PvE without having to use melee (that one shots stuff since the end of BETA).
---
anyone else down voting this for trying to tell people what to do. Just let people ask their questions. For some it is easier to ask their own then to search the answer. no need to be a dick. 
---
My biggest ??? Moment in times like these is that do people just.. not realize other games exist? There are so many fantastic, amazing games out there. And you have people defending the game and saying it‚Äôs fine, or people that will slog through the game even if it‚Äôs not that fun for them, but for what reason? Just play a game that‚Äôs more fun for you at that point. 
---
Melee player, do you understand that 50-95% of the player base had either explosive or two shot or combination of these as their main range weapon? Explosive effect was pretty much a must have on you main. Tse lever doing 160dmg :D gauntlet doing 250+ without any melee perks :D
---
Agreed!
---
I get legit pissed whenever i hear country roads anymore after 76. I fucking loved this game, I even tried to do a 48hr stream of ONLY fallout 76 on release day (I kinda passed out 36hrs in). This game was exactly what I wanted, a multiplayer fallout, and it just felt like a cheap ripoff shitty reskin of a half finished made in china free to play pile of trash. I put over 80 hours into the game before I just couldn't fake enjoying it anymore. Bethesda has forever lost at least one real fan.
---
Basing my opinion on ESO.. whenever pvp players cry about a class or ability, the remaining 95% (pve players) of their players get punished 
---
Holy shit, Destiny does the same: the raid drops gear that makes the raid easier. Them that‚Äôs got shall get. 
---
The only diference is the stupid PvP that barely anyone wants. Make exclusive PvP servers and disable all legendary affixes. Leave our PvE alone.
---
lol!!  wow!! balls man!!  upvoted!
---
You got your moneys worth of gameplay.
---
Stealth is kind of already nerfed.   Does not work right all the time.
---
Yes, what the patch seems to have done is to sometimes disable the double loading screens that were added as a workaround for the bug.
---
Works at Bethesda probably.
---
Community says fix TSE damage, Bethesda hear make bobby pins weigh more :/
---
Yeah, melee is fine doing it right? Amazing how guns can be garbage compared to a board in this game.
---
You probably shouldn‚Äôt play games if stuff like this takes a chunk out of life for you to write about a game that isn‚Äôt up to what you wanted. 1st world problems eh!
---
It's not just a game. I spent real money and full price on a game that was half off two weeks later. I am a consumer i have every right to complain. It not just a game. It's a business and if they can't keep consumers happy they have no business. This isn't just a game. This is consumers unhappy with Bethesda the producer. Its business. If it was free it would just be a game. But it's a real product that people spent real money on and got screwed on... so no it's not just a game.
---
If she‚Äôs not on payroll she ought to be.
---
Nothing sucks more then having to put on a smile and answer to angry folks all damn day.
---
At best you‚Äôre either talking someone down or
---
Preventing someone who desperately needs slap damage.
---
Players who are engaging in griefing are not going to pvp against an actual challenge. That's not why they're doing it. 
---
Thank you
---
To be fair, I also get a lot of legendary gear from non-legendary enemies. Wouldn‚Äôt mind if it was a bit more 1:1, though. 
---
No. Because i can use points in game to get it. But the temporary boost is so pathetic that it isn't worth my time. 
---
Citation for what? 
---
You in need of a medic legendary? I have a 2* medic lever action im trying to sell 
---
No idea how many hours I've got, but it would be in the hundreds for sure. But I know exactly what keeps me playing. It's the two or three really awesome friends I've made, who make everything fun, whether we're searching for clipboards to get Springs or doing uranium fever for the hundredth time.
---
So if it is temporary events, that‚Äôs fine? So it‚Äôs okay to be a temporary event that give you 200hp if you participate with real money. Right?
---
The correct comparison would be just to swap to melee while not wearing PA.
---
normal armor rifleman vs normal armor melee.
---
Same with me.
---
Nice find, I was had a coughing fit at the time of trying to type that out, stupid bronchitis. 
---
PSA: There is something called a "sort order" at the top of the page, and it works!
---
If you don't want to watch everything flood through /new then may I suggest /top or /rising?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but they're not "taking it out of the game" 
---
There is a WIN buttom since beta, its called melee. The most powerful builds are melee based, even during the time TSE were actually good. Queen kills were only possible with melee and there are plenty of videos around of people killing her with melee in 2 minutes. The only moment guns were able to do that was with the insane boublehead stacking.
---
Nerf melee to be as bad as gun then.
---
Hate FO76 PVP nothing but OP griefers....
---
There should be nothing to fix at the 3 month mark. They should be adding fuckin content. 
---
Apparently being banned for crafting too fast now, too. No evidence provided of course. Just a copy paste of an "e-mail' that anyone with two brain cells to rub together could write
---
Solo gods are plenty since beta, melee is pretty much that.
---
Lol ‚Äúcaved‚Äù
---
Then I saw fo65... makes sense lol
---
I played almost that much in the first two weeks while on Xbox - then a month later repeated it when I switched over to PC. A couple hundred hours is nothing. You got weekends too - Friday through Sunday you can't get 40 hours in? That's just 5 weekends of play. I can easily put in 4-8 hours a night during the week so there is another 16 - 32 hours. What are you doing with your life?
---
I got him - he was an albino!
---
I was storing fat man ammo because it's always fun to mess around with. I had about 15 of them before I realized they're 6lb each. 
---
fuck that. I wanna use 'em for funzies but I don't have a fatman and the stash is too limited to store any for later.
---
You're diluted. The anser is yes. I don't have to spend money to get it. I can spend money to get it if I wanted to. 
---
Because wanting your $60 game to actually work as advertised is being entitled?
---
YOU ARE THE REASON the servers are dying - OP
---
ROFLMAOO jesus fucking christ fuck is that retraded bullshit :D
---
Then melee discourages cooperation, melee can one shot stuff with the most garbage legendaries and can destroy the queen with the good ones.
---
Nope they said it would be creation engine still.
---
50% weight management, 25% server hopping, 15% PVP and 10% looking at loading screens :/
---
Ya know... even if you didn‚Äôt dupe to get all that, you‚Äôre still cashing sever instability.
---
Request: you stop posting on Reddit 
---
Ya.  Went to Watoga yesterday and farmed up some Assaultron robots.  Got a few Salvaged Heads, made a couple Assaultron Helmets, and then did this Fix and tested it.
---
It was doing +49 Rads on me every time I fired a 5 Charged attack.  And the animation for the 5 charge was pretty bland.  I was hoping it'd look cool even if the damage wasn't great.  But +49 rads on myself was a deal breaker.  Not even gonna fire it for fun.
---
Scrapped it and made another Assaultron Helmet.
---
Having fun with the game and trolling whiners here.
---
Thanks! 
---
I‚Äôm unsure of the tickled pickle thing 
---
But What the hell lolz
---
The whole point of the beta is to test these things out and see what works. So long as they don't catastrophically screw things up, it can only be a good thing :)
---
It's a time in this forum that I just auto down vote everything if it not regarding the actual issues, over nerfs, grind increases game breaking feature. Even my own comments.
---
He‚Äôs saying they‚Äôre both common 
---
Downvotes because you say -anything- bad about Fo76, when in fact you're trying to help.
---
And bethesda has not answered yet...
---
Agreed. Hopefully modders will be able to mod the game into a single player game with npcs and a good story. You'd be surprised with what they could do lol
---
Have you tried crafting new ones?
---
not sure myself but from a few posts on here since the patch people are having better look with new items rather than the ones they had pre patch.
---
Sucks fo'sure but ya'know Bethesda :/
---
You know the saying.. take a huge shit on the community, get a huge shift in the community.
---
Ok, I made that up.
---
Ya.  I'm guessing it's a message about the slight regen effect after using a Stimpack.  Not all that useful since the health bar kind of shows that too, I think.
---
I been doing this since day 2 at every train stop.   Find a stash and put legendaries/ammo/junk/chems in there once the vendor ran out of caps. 
---
I usually had plenty of stuff to sell to all 7 vendor factions and some left over.
---
I absolutely love this, there is already a minimum range as I discovered when I put my camp to close to lewisburg and couldn't shell it. Of course I only discovered that after I completed building the camp... some indication of the range on the map would be very nice. but...sigh....  given their inability to fix basic fundamental issues that have been there since day 1, I'm not holding my breath on nice new features
---
Yes, also very helpful! I use it quite often. Thanks 
---
Anyone else down voting this for trying to tell staticchmbr what to do?
---
It's only something that has been discussed at great length.
---
She's not doing her job well. NONE of the things the community has asked for or pointed out to be issues have been addressed at all with in game changes. Just a copy and paste script on a word document. Get real. She has done a spectacular job, however, at letting you believe they are actually listening to any of us. All these emails and reports that ate going to the dev team are probably sitting in some unchecked email account's spam folder in cyberspace right now. Until we see a road map and screenshots of these issues actually being conveyed yo the devs, I will not believe she is doing her job. I could care less if she tries to put a band aid over my frustrations, but her job (imo) is to make the devs know what we want. She can't make them do anything, but she can spam the hell out of them until something happens. If anyone cared, there would be noticeable improvement not nerfs on top of nerfs with a still largely broken game.
---
Same lol
---
who decides how many hours a game is worth?
---
you? Bethesda?
---
And lets be honest 760 hours isn't really true, server hopping and staring at loading screens are probably the majority of that play time.
---
No idea what makes your mobs that spongey, most mobs go down in one hit on a VATS sniper build (just rank 1 of every rifle perk), second shot usually finishes them (non TSE, AP lever action)
---
If thats the case im in on the artillery train if they do this...!
---
or a job at bethesda ; )
---
FUCKING. SHUT. UP. 
---
HAHAHHA jesus fucking CHRIST THE FUCK DRUGS you on kid? THE PATCH TODAY, holy fucking jesus christ get fucking real dumbshit ROFL :D :D
---
Hi, serious_bsns!
---
I wanted to stop by and wish you the most terrific day ever! Have a good one!
---
-HappyFriendlyBot
---
So you‚Äôd rather the community be silent about the games issues? That doesn‚Äôt make sense. Gamers community voice is most important 
---
Bethesda has ingame bug notifications system 
---
I use it all the time and I‚Äôve been pretty happy w/response SLA
---
yes my post is a rant BUT a request as well.
---
What‚Äôs your point?
---
And his name is John Cena!
---
Thats the way it goes in MMO's, been like this since the days of Ultima Online (Omg NERF Mages that use halberds! ... No, nerf Dexxers ...No, nerf Archers, yada yada)
---
Problem in Fa76 case is, there are only a few specs worth playing in the first place. And they just nerfed most of them, with the notable exception of melee
---
So if you can get it without spending money how is it pay to win? 
---
Bye bye indeed :) 
---
Interesting copy pasta on a lot of these "goodbye"posts.
---
lol 16k pounds? At 0.1 per scrap that's 160k individual pieces. I'm sorry but why does he need to wait so long to start building / scrapping? 
---
Copy pasta, really? I've literally just experienced and written this. 
---
touche 
---
the Rifle is a single-target weapon.  The Fat Man is an area weapon.  That is the difference.  If it scaled "logically" then mini-nuke would insta-kill an entire hoard of mobs in one shot.  
---
Hmm, I have the chameleon mutation, camo armor and escape artist and never seen this happen.  Of course the mutation never triggers because wearing armor all the time.  So that must be the difference.
---
It's because the Gamma Gun is the only gun"aside From Melee" That can almost insta kill someone with Sentinel Armor. Bethesda Clearly does not like OP guns anymore based off the last patch lol. You angered the gods the Gods! I think I might do this and get banned, but record the process so I can post it everywhere and add to the Shame Train. Also, Don't give the OP shit, Making multiples and then breaking them down is a great way to learn all the mods for said gun.
---
Meanwhile: the Fallout 76 Filthy Casuals community is thriving, we are having a blast, no salt. When shit happens we discuss it, grouphug it out, and everyone moves on. Why the main Fallout 76 subreddit is such a saltmine is beyond me. I'm maybe more patient because I've participated in Fortnite's PVE early access and feedback process for a year, and I've seen what happens when a developer flips the finger for more profit. The Atomic Shop here isn't as tragic as what happened when PVP came out for Fortnite, so that must be what puts it into perspective for me.  
---
"Don't be sad, just sell all your Bobby Pins and keep the Salt to yourself"  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
lol communism op salty as SH1T
---
Once again, context matters cause this hasn't happened and we don't actually know the context in which that'd happen.
---
When it happens, let's talk about it then.
---
Until then, I refer you back to the definition of slippery slope, more specifically:
---
&gt;When a relatively insignificant first event is suggested to lead to a more significant event, which in turn leads to a more significant event, and so on, --&gt; **until some ultimate, significant event is reached, where the connection of each event is not only unwarranted but with each step it becomes more and more improbable.** &lt;--
---
Are you even aware that you're using a slippery slope argument? You know it's not a good thing, right? It's bad logic.
---
Or was everybody else previously complaining actually right and all you idiots how are fight against them but are now complaining and just now seeing the light we're wrong
---
Well they fix anything reported to them via support. 
---
Her teenage journals. Oh
---
From my observations, workshops, teams and PvP are so utterly unpredictable that any semblance of intentional mechanics is entirely coincidental. God alone knows how it happened, which particular mechanic failed, or which combination, and whether the other guy manipulated them intentionally, accidentally, or also had no clue what was going on
---
Please don't.  The way it works now is fine, especially for those of us who tend to play at the same time every day.
---
Record transactions with unknown traders...bit of a sorry state of affairs when the game is that bad this becomes necessary isn't it?
---
You know Bethesda don't have the ability to give or remove items from your characters yea? Even there own GM's recommend starting over if you loose required quest items due to bugs .
---
If someone plays a game 760 hours, he likes it, and 760 hours of a game that he likes is a lot.
---
It was way overpowered, i have one since pre patch. Stop whining.  Mine still does 290. 
---
Oh look I wonder what's in that building over there. Wow look at all these journal entries for me to read, I wonder if there are any golfer ghouls around. Oh look I wonder what's in that building. Wow look at all these journal entries for me to read. I wonder if there are any golfer ghouls around. Oh look at that building over there............
---
I think they spawn on one of the vendors, If I remember right it is the southern most one in the divide. 
---
I have seen stealth work fine though.   
---
About 3 weeks ago, was at harpers ferry and could see stuff dying but no player.  Only when got right next to him and saw cursor change to "Invite to team" did I know where he was.  I am guessing those people who sneak does not "work" for did not equip the sneak perk itself.
---
I feel like there is a massive culture of entitlement here, and BGS has not even been allowed one week at this point to resolve the issues the community has with the latest patch.
---
The fact is, no one complaining here works for BGS/BS, and no one here can understand the priorities, technical process or workflows of the companies, they may be able to infer that experience from elsewhere, but they will never understand it entirely. Please, just give BGS time to sort everything out that they need to.
---
I don't know what to call the recent string of threads, and I feel like the positive vibe that we had on this subreddit is what set us apart from the generalized fallout one. I feel like we can't have a constructive conversation with eachother so it seems pointless to spend any more time here.
---
more customers taking there money else where.
---
Carry on encouraging it and Bethesda might actually have to act, thx :D
---
You sound overly pedantic. If the players didn't exist to buy it, the game wouldn't exist. If everyone stopped playing, Bethesda would stop updating it and shut the servers. Of course we don't own the rights to the game, but if they entirely ignore the player base, then there won't be a game, at all. And that vested stake is why the community owns it, as well.
---
Range weapons ruined. It's a melee slasher after one patch.
---
Whats logic behind this? Encourage people to not play more than a hour?
---
I'm guessing he knew, he followed the other three to their houses and destroyed them. I just rage quit then wrote this, lol. Thing is, he didn't even interact with the workshop in any way. He just walked up, shot everyone dead in seconds, took all their junk. Wasn't marked as hostile, and was one shotting the others and took me out in three. Makes no sense
---
I brought up these points a couple weeks ago and people were just downvoting and following Bethesda blindly. It's not that we want "Ez mode" by having better perks. We just want to have fun when playing a game. The concept isn't hard to grasp.
---
But still it works. You still dodging the question. As the context, it is starting the pay to win trend. 
---
Let me ask you the last question again if it is temporary buff but tie to paying money to get it easily is that a pay to win?
---
I don't have any to test with but if I did I could answer that. My testing in that thread that I link two was pretty rudimentary but it did show that those two cards at least stacked and we're cumulative. It should be easy enough to add something else and tested again.
---
&gt; Repeatedly slamming my dick in a door would be more exciting. 
---
Hum.  Never tried that.  Something new to do after work.
---
the pvp is a complete joke 
---
Haha, yeah that‚Äôs definitely what it is. Try out the glitch, it‚Äôs super easy to activate. Remove all your armor first. Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll be putting it back on. Now get out a weapon which will turn you invisible. Crouch down, put the weapon away, take a step to confirm you‚Äôre staying invisible, then put on any armor. Now the invisibility effect won‚Äôt go away, even when server hopping, fast traveling, attacking, whatever. Only way to undo this is by removing the armor again and getting out a weapon. This will reset the invisibility. 
---
Tenis players tend to have better looking arses than golf players.
---
PA is like a hat in this game, no need to use it imo.
---
They have access to his creation logs so if he‚Äôs in the clear he should get his account back. Op could lie to us, but he can‚Äôt lie to Bethesda. 
---
No not at all (i get its likely) but it doesn't mean that at all. You tubers spend thousands of hours in games they hate for clicks. 
---
Maybe Bethesda should have played for a few hundred hours before launching and see how they felt about it then.
---
But again, who says how long a game should last? You, Bethesda? 
---
I got them all easily on both characters so curious where that stat was published. However it doesn't get away from the simple fact there's no reason you'd ever legitimately do a set of 300 weapon builds in rapid succession (read the ops post). 10-20 yes and thats what I do but never 300 as its a massive waste of un-returnable resources. Saying otherwise is just laughable. You crash the server doing that you were duping or trying to and that's how they're tracing people.
---
Just based on my own experience versus what I read here on Reddit, I think the PS4 may be the most stable platform.  That's not to say it's truly stable! But I can go a few hours without a blue screen or a disconnect and it seems like many people have it much worse than that.
---
If this is actually happening the way people say then the fault lies with, big surprise, Bethesda. You know how you avoid people spamming to create items over and over and over again? MAKE A SLIDER SO WE CAN SELECT THE AMOUNT TO CREATE!! I am amazed that I have to add that I want a slider that scrolls properly in both directions unlike the current broken sliders that scroll infinitely left if you have 40 or more of any single item.
---
So many issues and a lot of them are linked in one way or another. I'll take bullet creation here and rather than create a massive list I'll use short sentence to break up the points so this might read a little weird. I'm also going to ignore that you can store quite a few materials if that's literally all you have because I personally would like to be able to store weapons and armour I won't use often or save for specific things.
---
We need bullets for guns (duh). Lots of enemies are bullet sponges meaning we burn through ammo a lot. We need to craft more ammo. We need materials for ammo. We can't store much of the materials in advance due to low stash sizes. We can't stash ammo in advance for the same low stash size reason. We go out, farm materials and then find a crafting bench where we're forced to stand there and mash a key / button to create ONE SINGLE STACK.
---
Now to expand on that I'm going to use the weapon I know and use most - the .50 cal machine gun. A .50 cal machine gun in the game can use 250 rounds max before reloads. One stack of created ammo with ammosmith perk at max only creates 180 rounds. I won't take Super Duper into account since that isn't guaranteed. We have to craft two lots of ammo just to replace one full reload, 3x to replace 2 reloads.
---
A Scorchbeast Queen fight can see me going through anywhere from 500 rounds to 2k or more if it's going badly and lasts almost all the 30 mins. I need to replace that ammo so back to camp I go and that leads to more key / button mashing rapidly. Picking worst case, 2k, that's 11 times at least and that's just one fight. If I spend a lot of time away from my CAMP then it's likely I have a lot of materials and very little ammo. That key / button mashing only increases the longer I'm away and if I use more weapons plus grenades then that just adds more mashing.
---
All of this is a massive compounded result of not having enough stash space. I'd create a lot of ammo and store it then pick up more as needed when near a world stash. Failing that I have to keep as much ammo on me as possible and use my stash to keep materials to create more. With the amount of ammo we need to do anything, the amount of upkeep needed for armour and weapons we need to store as much as possible and what we have is simply not enough.
---
Yes there had to be nerf but literally no one asked for demo card nerf, or any other card nerfs. TSE nerf itself were way too much. Ts stays the same 100 and E goes from 100 to 25 IF weapon already has two shot effect. Just a Explo effect alone 100 to 50.
---
Then the nerf would still leave the range weapons viable.
---
Read between the lines. If you understood anything about the game then you would know. Your ignorance is obvious and you are exactly the type of person OP wanted to get on his side with his sympathy enduring post. Sucker. 
---
Truth being told you expressed my concerns in a much better way that I am capable of.
---
Good news is Bethesda acknowledged the issues in [this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alcjfs/patch_issue_stealth_crouch_is_less_effective/), so its added to the list. Bad news is we'll have to be patient for the validation and fix.
---
r/woosh
---
That is exactly the point I was making, I was being sarcastic :p
---
People were expecting vaults by now. That's only reason I came to check out this reddit. Seeing that it's still the same content I wont pick it up again. Honestly there are just better grinds out there in games that reward you way better and have a proper end game system. But people will do what they want. 
---
Mirelurk Kings have too much health, and have the similar attack issue as Scorch Beasts with their sonic attack. Only way I can deal with them is just smack them round the head with any handy meele weapon.
---
Similar issue with the Gulpurs, seems all the FarHarbour creatures have this issue.
---
And if they leave this sub too, we will have a sub worth of the game someday.
---
So you‚Äôre done ? ‚Äú99% of our focus is on fixing bugs‚Äù they keep rolling patches back that won‚Äôt happen 
---
I really wish I could upvote this more than once.  Every word here is true.
---
Yeah wtf his score is so low dude
---
not shielded
---
Maybe this analogy will help; the Creation Engine is like the games power bar and they plug things into it like graphics, physics, animation, etc. The issue is that it was never designed to handle this level of load. For the power bar analogy it's like having a 30 amp fuse trying to handle a 50 amp load.
---
Yeah I'm with ya but I love NV/4 over 3.   I stopped playing this game the beginning of December and have yet to see a patch worthy of picking it back up.  Just reading the complaints since then is a major deterrent.  I got to lvl 77 and was just BORED all the time because their is a lack of content.
---
Upvoted. Great ideas mate!
---
And could I just add my repeated request to bring back the Plasma Caster (Fo1+2's 'plasma rifle')!
---
I think it's because the people that Bethesda are using are mostly new to the company and subsequently the creation engine. Where as the modding community, especially the really passionate ones have years of experience, some literally have decades working with the same engine since Morrowwind
---
Possible ban-hammer would be the solution but as I said almost every single player I've come accross has been great. There truely are some good souls wandering the wasteland
---
I have never seen evidence of played I can't see, I do however see lots of folks scurrying around crouched as though they think they were invisible.
---
Are they actually supposed to be invisible or just trying to remove the map marker...serious question.
---
Well, most of the games last about 10 hours, so 760 hours is enough in my opinion.
---
My son got banned while we were playing together. We got no idea why so we asked. 
---
We got the same stupid robo- message again. No explanation and no way to get in touch with a real person. 
---
I'm still furious about the whole thing. I know my son didn't cheat. I helped him out by crafting some pipe guns (he was level 5) 
---
Is that cheating? I was under the impression this game is about playing together. 
---
I'm too tired of putting up with the endless list of new bugs and stuff ups. I got the feeling each patch breaks the game further   
---
Today I got stuck in my power armour. The only way out was to leave the game and go back in. I was able to leave the armour once. After entering it again I got stuck again, no way out.  On top of that my carry weight was reduced because my excavator armour didn't have the additional weight gain. I tried a few times. End game, go back in, leave armour, go back in, get stuck, do it again I found it had something to do with the space suit I picked up at the crash site. Once I got that one off things started working again. Only the carry weight thing still happens... Leave game, loose progress, do it all over again and hope the server doesn't crash. 
---
Anyway I could go on for a long time about my frustration with Bethesda. 
---
At the end I'm just deeply disappointed. 
---
I love FO, I think a clocked over 2500 hours on FO4.  But I'm about to lose it. 
---
I'm just waiting on Metro and Dying Light and I'm gone for good. 
---
There is something called the upvote button. It gives a useful post visibility. Your post is useless so I downvoted it for less visibility. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£üñïüñïüñïüñïüñï
---
Ah ha! now I have reupvote you back. Points for everyone!
---
Not really an option when they're all legendary variants unfortunately 
---
At least they put out free content. 
---
The only downside to spiderman is that I paid 150$ for the collectors edition and the statue was low quality. 
---
OMG how do you not understand this? BECAUSE I CAN PAY TO HAVE A STAT INCREASED. Whether or not you can get atoms in game is irrelevant. You can also pay to get them. 
---
Mxr mods is cool lol
---
nexus modders would get this mess done in maximum of 2 month. thx to all modders who made Fallout series playable stable and interesting.
---
they made the series great... now look what bethesda made...
---
I wish they give this project to the modders and stop messing it up more and more.
---
They wanted their microtransactions. 
---
Of course
---
Check the (known) plans list at the vendor. 
---
I have two characters where one had learned the plan before the patch. My other character that didn't have the plan pre-patch had the handmade gun plan marked as known on the Harper's Ferry vendor.
---
I could still buy and consume the plan on the second character so it's just a visual bug.
---
According to a vocal minority.
---
&gt; But still it works. 
---
Omg... You're a lost cause.
---
However to play along, 200 health bonus for exactly the same conditions as the current Unstoppables event would be ludicrous. Pay to win is questionable given the temporary window but let's say it is. The problem is bridging this unrealistic hypothetical situation to the current real world one.
---
Once again, I refer you back to the highlighted section in the last comment.
---
If you still don't get it, I'm sorry. You're just going to have to find someone who is better able to speak to you at your level.
---
It might be your only option though, depending on what this next fix does :(
---
Not 100% sure if it would help anyways was only a suggestion after reading others having similar issues :/
---
Good. I didn't want to get angry üòÇ
---
&gt; While demanding a leadership change is an unreasonable demand, the fact that so many people upvoted it shows ...
---
That there are a huge number of unreasonable people on this subreddit (well, on all subreddits actually...)
---
It was always good. It suffered a perfect storm of shit publicity, brought on by games journalists, Sony, and the developer.
---
10 hours?
---
Ok so your main games are phone games clearly :/
---
If it makes you feel any better, I can praise it now?
---
Well yes... Haha
---
After the patch I decided to give a stealth build a try. I had 4 pieces of chameleon legendary armor I had been saving in my stash. I had all the sneak-related perk cards maxed out. 
---
It was abysmal. 
---
Enemies detected me from a mile away. 
---
I can't see my damn crosshairs because my f\*&amp;!%g gun is invisible.
---
I was always in "DANGER" mode but could still fast travel.
---
After laboriously clearing two separate areas just to give it a fair chance I said screw that and went back to hulk mode.
---
De gustibus non est disputandum. 
---
They deserve everything they get. They work for scum then they are scum by association. Fuck em! 
---
Unpopular opinion: the modders are part of the problem.
---
As will intentioned as you guys are, if you fix Bethesda's games for free (as you have been doing since 3), these games will continue to be shit. Bethesda has no reason to hire good QA, or bug testing, or bug fixing, if they know the community will do it for them for free.
---
This is coming from someone who ran dozens of mods to make FO4 more into the game I wanted it to be (higher settlement budget, more furniture, optimized graphics and textures). This is coming from someone who actually pays for mods on Nexus, because I think you people are more deserving of money than the lazy studios. 
---
And maybe extra furniture and settlement budget isn't that big of a deal. But it goes too far when modders are fixing fundamental issues like widescreen resolution or when they are trying to make fundamental mechanics actually work. At that point it goes from being a healthy outgrowth of a game, to a outsourcing of fundamental work without compensation. You are literally doing their jobs for free.
---
So I'll say it again: IF YOU DO THEIR WORK FOR THEM FOR FREE, THEY HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO DO IT THEMSELVES. If the community will clean up their mess, they have no reason not to release a buggy mess if that saves the studio money on testing and QA. 
---
Tl;Dr, modding for fundamental issues is a short term solution that creates a long term problem.
---
Considering the game went on sale *twice* within the first month of it being released I wouldn't call that a "minority" if enough bad coverage was enough to hurt its sales in such a way
---
I'm wondering if my freezing/ disconnect issues yesterday were due to the high volume of people downloading the patch? They may use seperate servers or playstations servers to provide this but IDK
---
What you guys want and what is needed to balancenthe game is unfortunately not the aame thing.
---
They don't wanna make the ticket themselves but want it to enter the support queue lol 
---
Nah they can stay here and let potential customers (them fans you mentioned) know about Bethesda's business practices / priorities :)
---
Great you guys brought in old bugs.
---
I was not talking about the games I play, but games that are released.
---
I remember people saying some bobblehead-related perks were broken and you could essentially have stacked explosives forever.
---
maybe they fixed the stacking, but people who were already buffed still have the stack active. it's the only explanation I can come up with if you hadn't initiated pvp.
---
otherwise, bloodied is still just as good as ts and anti-armor + tank killer means you're essentially naked.
---
You don't need to imagine conspiracy theories -- the whole "outrage culture" idea explains it better.
---
So should we get upset at all games that launch broken? Because well that's about 90% of games of 2018 
---
Probably, but one can dream.
---
I'll call anyone that says 20 gauss a liar to their faces.... I've done batches of 10-20 weapons repeatedly on multiple characters on both my accounts since beta. Weapon mods are not at all hard to get the only time consuming element is gathering the resources. Only ones harder were the buy only plans... which are now easily available. Finding rare plans used to be the hardest thing in game ... you clearly aren't playing Fallout 76....
---
All plans that can be unlocked by scrapping where removed from vendors. The BoS plans can be unlocked via scrapping so craft and scrap until you unlock it. 
---
Wow, you really think we needed another one of these posts?
---
Good riddance, dude...
---
Sometimes justice is blind friend 
---
What do you feel as if your contributing to this community making shitty comments as well? Maybe you should leave the sub as well? 
---
Because it works like that in real life. You probably didn‚Äôt know what happened in lots of politics and in real world. Starting something small with less resistance first and work its way up is much easier to do it as a whole. 
---
I am just with more experienced. But call it whatever you want to call it. 
---
I think it's more of a cursed monkey paw situation. "Paw, I wish for no dupers" 
---
*a finger on the paw curls inward*
---
Like a Bethesda customer (ex fan)
---
Thanks - playing on mouse and keyboard I'd never even seen that reference before. ;)
---
You mean back in the good-old-days when almost everyone was optimistic? 
---
That ship has sailed.
---
PREACH!!!! It is possible to love the game and hate the company for what they are doing to said game. I really hope something substantial comes out of this community wide backlash. It feels more and more like Bethesda cares less and less for the suggestions made by their biggest supporters. We just keep getting the middle finger. 
---
Sounds a lot like the Murphy‚Äôs Law about Fast-Acting Fuses. 
---
The OP's topic is scary and makes me wary of crafting handmades (just got the plans, like so many others). The only good thing about this is the Blade Runner reference. +1
---
200% get it right, for every one game that is released 2 buggy messes spawn. That is just code some how it does that. 
---
I'm wondering if this is also now happening with perks. Not the crashing but the sharing of perks nearby to non-team members. Three times lately I've seen perk popups for perks that I do not equip - chance to dodge all damage while low health (I was at 100%), gun repairing itself after use, armour repair after taking a hit. The first two I saw in the last few days but it puzzled me as I have never used those perks in my builds as I stay as high health as possible and use mostly full auto guns. 
---
good just wait If not the sky man could be redeemed, why not fallout?  But the difference is that Bethesda is a large and well-known company. He is playing with the patience of his clients. is taking a long time to leave the game in a normal state, it is still an early access of 60 dollars 
---
It sure is a "known" issue. 
---
I‚Äôm asking folks to stop broadcasting their reasons for quitting Fallout 76.
---
If you‚Äôve identified a problem use Bethesda‚Äôs ingame software 
---
If you‚Äôre looking to drum up sympathy or support  use fine 
---
But if you‚Äôre gonna rant and whine about how youre leaving because you feel cheated because you duped or the game is too hard please just quit and go.
---
It‚Äôs not that hard to quit right?
---
Pardon my ignorance but Does bethesda owe the gaming community anything? In terms of money or compensation for either developing content or 
---
Services rendered or performed?
---
I wasn‚Äôt part of the beta I bought my game in November.
---
I think it‚Äôs safe to say that many of the instability issues aren‚Äôt just design but exploits made by duper‚Äôs. 
---
I do know a few folks who quit playing because they were frustrated with the instability and server issues.
---
Please advise
---
&gt;But the real practical problem I‚Äôve found is having to break bulk down to scrap to be able to repair anything. 
---
Sometimes, not just with Bethesda, this happens with*all* software, fixing one thing inventory messed something else up. This is one of those times. They've acknowledged it, and said it will be addressed in the upcoming hot fix. It's not really necessary to keep beating on that horse.
---
Also, for future reference, bulking junk (other than lead or aluminum) doesn't change the weight. If you are bulking stuff for any reason other than to immediately sell it, you're just wasting plastic.
---
I was so disappointed with the combat and PvP in 76 I bought Blackops4.
---
Oops, walked right into the fundamental latency compensation and hitreg issues there.  
---
Turns out all games can be shit if we want them to be.
---
Yes, its a just a conspiracy to ruin the game. Bethesda is the victim here.
---
u/Comp1ication needs to express his outrage because that's the only way he will ever receive love.
---
Actually it is very relevant.  As is the fact it is a tiny hp boost.
---
Knee jerk reaction auto jump so slippery slope people like you wouldn't know pay to win games if they smacked you in the face with a dead cat.
---
Specifically, researching the Democracy tech would reduce that civ's aggression by one point, on a scale of 0-10. Since Ghandi was at 0, when he researched democracy he'd underflow to 10 and go nuke-happy with his new-found aggression.
---
Believe me I have considered that, but at the moment I am having way too much fun pissing off people like you.
---
That's true - curious where you regularly go underwater though as I've only been a couple of times for more than say 10 seconds. Ahh those moments I embarrassingly fell off things..... ;)
---
Im in favor of this
---
\- Spent my first 150hrs (80ish levels) just discovering the map and killing, didn't focus on missions.
---
\- Spent my next 100hrs (lvl80-140) actually doing missions, didn't launch my first nuke till level 100ish.
---
\- Spent my next 60ish hours  (lvl140-200) Famring the Queen and Whitesprings  
---
\- Have spent my last 50ish hours (lvl200-217) going back to each location and listening to all the tapes and reading letters, lore hunting. 
---
\*\*\*  spent MANY hours building and moving my Camp
---
\*\*\* spent many hours rebuilding my character, started melee, went TSE, and now I'm running low health bloodied mutated build.   
---
Yeah, I do. Unfortunately I liked Bethesda games, and it's taken me six months to reach my point with this game. They need to know their fans are still pissed. You think they don't need to know this? So I assume, you think the game is perfect and running exactly as intended?   
---
Good riddance indeed. I'm happy to leave if the remainder of individuals are as blind and non-understanding as you seem to be. Company has markedly improved. 
---
No, people asking about bulk is getting out of hand. Someone will post about it when there's a thread a few lines below on the same thing. If you can't do minimal research then you don't deserve to repair any items or build your CAMP.
---
$70 early access games, ah there's only been about a dozen of those released this year lol 
---
I'm still waiting for bfV to get out of early access so I can buy it 
---
Loop?
---
I think built and scrapped 500 or so to learn 40 mods
---
You sir are a cunt.
---
Yes exactly, nerf should be about balancing things, making even playing field. Not taking things away :D monkey pulled these nerf numbers and piss poor dev decisions.
---
Melee still doing 15k dmg. Any of my E/TS/TSE weapons never did even nearly those numbers.
---
90% of my game is spent farming repair junk for non PA armour.
---
i Cant keep everything i own fixed at all times. I always have half my armour pieces broken.  Being  a non PA armor user. I have to repair every session some times twice. Now with requiring Ballistic fiber to make any armour past lvl 25., I cant keep up
---
With rank 5 Gunsmith my weapons rarely break ever. I guess this will change soon too
---
Yeah but said idiots will not even know this topic exists.
---
damage seems to decrease with condition, although it is not reflected on the weapon‚Äôs stats. to me, it seems most noticeable when i repair to 160 or 200% (i have max Weapon Artisan perk, i forget it‚Äôs max value right now).
---
I don't believe in karma.
---
Hopefully we can get some Bethesda Moderators attention to this.
---
This practically does the job for the developers.
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
Mind passing this along to help them out?
---
Thanks.
---
\*early access  de 60 dolares 
---
with microtransactions
---
If you haven‚Äôt unlocked all the perk cards,yes. But if you have, not really.
---
The devs are very clearly the problem... 
---
We aren't in 'launch' anymore.
---
I'd love content like this, but I feel like it won't be a thing because of the lore (unless they find a loop hole). If the devs give players the possibility of becoming super mutants and ghouls, they also need to introduce the option to undo the change (in case players regret their choice later on). There is a cure for super mutants in FO4, but that's not only in an entirely different region but also 200 years in the future. I imagine it would be near impossible to introduce a cure for those mutations, which would also work with the lore retroactively. 
---
Think that's the only item so far like that.
---
Lmao this game is shit and Bethesda wont do anything because theyre incompetent.
---
Let me just say that my experience playing the afternoon after the patch was completely inconsistent with this.  My many 2s weapons and one 2se continue to be effective in UF event (ran twice) and in the Bog -- they simply don't make mobs trivial.
---
However -- big, big scrapping bug introduced yesterday.  No yields from scrapping *anything* in weapons or apparel (as opposed to world junk). The scrapped item just disappears.
---
the beta was to find the problems, but they became the beta in the official game 
---
You didn‚Äôt piss me off? Just proved to a community that you‚Äôre ignorant. That‚Äôs about the only thing you achieved. You‚Äôre obviously part of the minority with a huge mouth that cause the current patch to come out that also caused a huge number of people to quit. Takes a lot more to piss me off than someone who contributes nothing üëçüèª
---
No, it‚Äôs a fallacy WHEN used as an argument AND the connections are unwarranted. 
---
Simply using the term doesn‚Äôt equal fallacy. There are many instances where an event can be described as the start of a slippery slope.
---
few more health points per level. I honestly don't even know how many...
---
just hitting 300 hours. been playing since stress test.
---
some farming, some building, some quests, some events, workshops, treasure maps, helping others with their quests, etc. I actually pay attention to the stories, listen to the holotapes, read the terminals, etc. 
---
i understand that the game isn't as packed as RDR2 single player, but i get genuinely confused by people that haven't put 100 hours in the game and say that there is nothing to do. I sit down, blink, and 6 hours is gone.
---
Who's fault is that?
---
I was going to point this out. It looks nice for collecting internet points, but as in most things on this sub lately, oversimplified. I really wish the community would stop being so naive.
---
Because every game broken at launch is fixed with in a week lol, I'm not saying Bethesda is doing a bang up job I'm just saying all developers do this with their games 
---
 Send buggethesda my regards and let them know that everyone thinks their game SUCKS and they will lose a lot of future sales.
---
Sure. Whatever you say.
---
The thing I hate most about this is that you only get 20 atoms for playing the game 300 days
---
If you are happy with your build, then not really. I leveled past 120 because I‚Äôm always in the nuke zones.
---
Yeah I get you. I heard the same thing about the bobble-heads, I guess they hadn't fixed it as they had claimed.   
---
Nope, no PvP initiation at all. He just came over, boom, 3 dead and me at 2/3rds, but it was a handmade so the next two shots came instantly lol. Thing is, 400hp, 550+ damage resistance, Assasins gear - 40% player damage, and -45% explosive from fireproof, dense armour chest + The PvP initiation thing, and I'm still dead in 3. I just don't see how they have left it so broken. 
---
Thank you for the verification. 
---
The beta was never to find problems, this was stated multiple times it was only a server stress test which also did nothing lol but still it wasn't to ever find and fix problems 
---
&gt;**False Equivalence**  
---
&gt;Description: An argument of claim in which two completely opposing arguments appear to be logically equivalent when in fact they are not. The confusion is often due to one shared characteristic between two or more items of comparison in the argument that is way off in the order of magnitude, oversimplified, or just that important additional factors have been ignored.

Wow, you're playing the logical fallacy greatest hits, huh?
---
&gt; I am just with more experienced. But call it whatever you want to call it. 
---
Also for good measure since you made that comment:
---
&gt;The **Dunning-Kruger effect** is a type of cognitive bias in which people believe that they are smarter and more capable than they really are. Essentially, low ability people do not possess the skills needed to recognize their own incompetence. The combination of poor self-awareness and low cognitive ability leads them to overestimate their own capabilities.

---
One week to fix a few things THAT WERE ARLEADY FIXED IN PREVIOUS PATCH? 
---
   Is everyone at buggthesda gone insane??? 
---
Vlad has publicly admitted in the past some of the people he plays with are dupers although he claims he didn't dupe himself.  He's certainly traded around for stuff/gear that's likely duped though.  Tough call here - its like playing with fire, just not lighting the fire yourself.
---
How do you do that?
---
&gt;bethesda will see the capacity free up and reconsider or reverse
---
Wishful thinking. I think management stopped caring about this game before it released.
---
Bethesda's a fucking dumpster fire. 
---
well, in addition to stress test, they are also used to find errors 
---
in general, in all games, it's like that world of warcraft for example 
---
In FO4, missile launchers and the Fat Man gets boosted by both heavy weapons and explosives. The double boost at max makes them \*very\* powerful.
---
You must be a Canuck, I feel the same. I didn't go for the Power edition but did overextend myself to get the tricentennial and then got burned on the collectors guide as well. overall by the fire sale in November I had dropped 200 on the game to play and then saw it drop to a quarter of that. The real butthurt came when they just gave players the first three games which I and many others got for preordering the game. As I see it I'm out the money for a game that shouldn't even be out as a release yet and with the Atom Shop should certainly not be a premium price game.
---
Bethesda is a duper??
---
What a wonderful sub this is.. thank you all kind bros!
---
Bethesda really is the first game in the last 20 years to SUBJECT its  community with the"update, patch and hotfix" cycle of development. I can see why so many players are ready to quit the game forever. What new hell with these dastardly people unleash upon us next, eh bruther? RISE UP
---
You ever have the Archer Farms coffees from Target? I‚Äôd swear the guy at the register laughed a little when he saw me buy that garbage
---
After getting quite high on my main character i just started levelling my other character slots to 50. 
---
At least then I've got multiple builds and the xp wasn't "wasted" as it felt before. Have 4 over 50 now and its better than having 1 character. Especially as the NERF bat has started swinging and there's no real respecs :/
---
Like I said before, you're going to need to talk to someone else. I can't help you, sorry.
---
Is your trash can named dev team? I bet it is 
---
Thank you for that.  Really need some levity in the world.
---
The rant fest out there gets taxing.
---
Have a great day!!
---
Are the Level-Up and Ranked Perk Cards achievements bugged?
---
bethesda is lying, there is no such thing as 'automated code merging'. There's Git, there's SVN, there's TFS. Pick your poison. Developers and managers need to make sure they are merging the right branches manually. There's no technical excuse, this is a human fuckup. Take it from me, or the thousands of software devs that deal with this shit from day to day. I'd be fired on the spot if I let such a ridiculous error get into production.
---
Secondly, there's clearly no regression testing over at bethesda. In 2019. Shows you how little testing is done. How little they care. And how incompetent their company is willing to be perceived as. They're unprofessional. They should be roasted for this crap.
---
Lol, Butthurt hit the nail on the head. Well done my dude :) 
---
I'm not sure I could get off work to fly to Asia...maybe next time.  
---
Cheers. But actually it's not going far enough. They need to be shamed! If your boss was conning pensioners out of money and you knew about it, would you continue to work for your boss and defend them in good conscience? If the answer is yes, then it may well be that it is in fact you who is the cunt. Find them all! Shame them to the ground! They're all complicit. Along with any so called fans who downvote me on this matter.
---
I feel like this is accuracy smoothing. If you shot two shots in quick succession IRL, they won't land in the same spot because of recoil. So instead of making it so every 4th second bullet lands were intended, they just give you a 25% bonus on each pull. 
---
They really should update this to have the second shot do the same damage but go on a slight angle. Great for closer up shots, but further away it loses its impact. 
---
Just because another dev did it as well dosnt make it acceptable. Telling even more ppl to stop playing? Seems like a god idea, Bethesda are really gonna keep investing in the game if the player pop disappears arnt they.
---
The map and the music are the better parts of the game.  I cannot fault the map at all.  Some complain about being too spaceous but then where would we put out camps? 
---
That's why i said additionally
---
Grind for better Legendaries. Which is now pointless.
---
Nuke, nuke and.....nuke!
---
Then why make this post? U clearly dont actually care that ppl are making quit posts
---
I think I've got over four hundred hours now and there's really only one reason for that, the government shutdown.
---
I was furloughed an at home so I played a lot of video games to keep my mind off of the bills.
---
I'm not exactly a young guy and have played all of the fallout games since the beginning and me and many of my friends have had a great time in Fallout 76. 
---
We'd like to help new people whenever we can and have created a cult around the Mothman and have even built a village almost surrounding the gorge junkyard.
---
We do nuke runs, we get dressed up in her cultist outfits and sneak up on unsuspecting players with Longbow flaming chainsaws chasing them around and then dropping items for them afterwards if they had a good reaction.
---
We get large stacks of plans and recipes together and when all of us have gone through them find somebody low-level and drop them off. Ever have somebody drop off 110 plans for you that you didn't know? It's pretty cool.
---
We read Lord and talk about the timeline issues, we chat about the Vault dweller diary Tumblr site, we do a lot of stuff.
---
I‚Äôve been to nearly every map location. In the process, I got all the achievements for the game. Some of those required a bit of extra work. I‚Äôve done every known side/daily quest and actively looked for more. Once that was all done, I started focusing on the grind.
---
My new goals have been making a second character for melee while playing with friends who got the game late, hoarding useful weapons/armor, completing all in game challenges for atoms, and to build a perfect camp. 
---
I‚Äôve even made my own challenges, like playing this melee character using no armor and melee only. Once I got done mutating myself to hell, I have rather few Hp but decent DR/ER. With chems I can hit crazy hard, but most things can still kill me pretty easy. I have to play smart. The in game challenges are also more fun than I expected, or at least were until I ran out of completable ones. The rest are just acquiring plans for new kinds of food, farming for diseases, and a few that can‚Äôt be completed. 
---
Total about 250 hours played. 
---
Not sure what im doing wrong then.  I run a luck/vats build.  Maxed rifleman perks, tenderizer, bloody mess and barley do any damage to SBQ.  
---
&gt; this was done to preventing the loss of mods getting scrapped.
---
nah, it was a faulty merge of patch versions. Hotfix is already coming.
---
Does Bethesda owe us anything? That‚Äôs a lackadaisical question. We‚Äôre the consumers, so without us- they don‚Äôt profit, and if they don‚Äôt profit- they aren‚Äôt a company. When a game this bad is produced it‚Äôs undeniably important as CONSUMERS to voice our opinions whether they are good or bad. Unless you want to be taken advantage of like EA with micro transactions- oh wait, the community spoke up and actually stopped EA from producing future games with loot boxes... *shrugs* 
---
Have you ever played Fallout 1?  it plays more like diablo than a fps.
---
obsidian is a good company, i have high hopes for their next project. 
---
Modders don't have the skillset to write rendering, networking code etc...
---
Another Nocturnal Wooden Left Leg lost...sigh...
---
I was finally thinking of making an alt that wasn‚Äôt power armor dependent. 
---
Maybe? I am not sure. When you pick up something it took like 5 mins before the loot pop in your inventory 
---
I've seen this on anything that uses a slider, like trying to drop only a portion of your ammo or storing or retrieving a portion of something from your stash
---
The decision to use this horrible engine for an always on online game was the failure.  The rest is simply fallout from that initial poor decision.
---
Well I have a family to support and a mortgage to pay which require my stable income. So because family comes first is absolutely work for Satan if I had to. I‚Äôd only stop if I had another job already lined up. They are just doing their job, they all have lives and families. Bethesda‚Äôs wrongs are not theirs. Life isn‚Äôt as simple as you make out kid, leave them alone. Be angry at Bethesda all you want but leave the people doing their jobs alone, they‚Äôve got a hard enough time as it is without being personally attacked 
---
I'm probably going to play less for a while until Bethesda fixes this mess.
---
As I said call it whatever you want and seems like you are affecting by what you just quote the Dunning Kruger Effect. 
---
You kept dodging the question though. 
---
Because you know it‚Äôs true. 
---
Mine dropped from killing an ordinary assaultron in Watoga.
---
&gt; However, to the vast majority of us
---
You've counted?
---
&gt; All of this is extremely shady.
---
Shady?
---
&gt; there are real, important issues with the game that causes massive grief for thousands of people. 
---
Has someone killed your dog?
---
&gt; companies do not give a damn about you
---
You've only just worked this out?  Is that why you're so angry?
---
&gt; Did anyone ever expect Bethesda to become like this? 
---
I thought you understood that companies don't give a damn about you?
---
&gt; It is absolutely obscene
---
A buggy video gane is "absolutely obscene"?  You need to get a grip.
---
&gt; which is even more the reason to talk about it.
---
Of course.  Without the expression of our justified outrage we won't get the thrill of people agreeing with us in order to convince ourselves our tiny, boring little lives are worth it.
---
We aren't a week from launch. We aren't a month from launch. If you're going to use 'whataboutism' at least pick something that is comparable.
---
Sounds kinky.
---
First and last one are always busy on my end. Middle one works.  
---
Going to keep playing, because I'm enjoying it?
---
That is not a bad rate given how pathetic the odds are.
---
How does it feel to burn through what, 1k+ nuclear material and circuitry?
---
I am currently half way through unlocking the mods in the radium long after I have unlocked everything else in all the rest of the weapons.
---
Fuck the radium, honestly.
---
Bethesda ignores us, time for us to ignore Bethesda. I'm done turning this game on, loading it up and encountering bugs until I rage quit. I refuse to call what I did with the game, "playing" because it really wasnt. 
---
Cleaning my house sounds less tedious and more enjoyable than Fallout 76 right now. 
---
Your community issue tracker was removed for some reason. 
---
thanks for the chuckle.
---
How many targets does your black powder rifle hit at once exactly? The benefit of explosive weapons is their aoe potential not their single target spike damage. 
---
Ur wrong 
---
Thank you again for all the work you put into helping this community. Applachia n the real world need more people like you n your friends. 
---
me neither ( i already had the effect before patch tho)
---
Good for you. Was the karma whoring pst nessescary?
---
Don't let the door hit you on the way out
---
I understand your opinion but you have to consider this is a multiplayer game and other people are affected by what is available. Unfortunately your best option is to wait until private servers are available which could presumably have mods to let you have your god mode.
---
&gt;all developers do this with their games
---
No, but its getting worse. Thanks to pre-ordering and early-access.
---
Overweight mules add to server instability - this part violates the TOS of causing harm to other players.  The account should rightfully be banned.  If you didn't abuse alt accounts by storing thousands of items on the alt, it shouldn't be a problem.
---
Hopefully /u/LoneVaultWanderer does a proper review of this.  IMO, the alt account is a clear violation of your TOS, and caused me as another player harm.
---
This is a very good idea. Also yes it's still worth 5 points. (Little more than that actually)
---
I have been meaning to make this suggestion for almost two months. I think it would add a ton of build variety and people attempting speed runs. Which would add even more life to this game. 
---
As an ex Blizzard employee, never work for a gaming company if you enjoy or love their games. You do not want to know how the sausage is made. 
---
‚ÄúPaw, I wish the players we still have left to be happy with the patch notes!‚Äù
---
Probably about as much as those on the opposite end of the spectrum who tend to throw temper tantrums after each patch.
---
I make mothman omelettes every day as part of my play/selling routine and they fetch about 9 caps each and you get enough eggs to make 24 of them . 
---
Actual beta testing is a thing. The B.E.T.A was bullshit.
---
At the moment I am playing FO76, but I took a break from it and played No Man's Sky and some other game I can't remember, but when I returned to FO76 I was having a great time again.
---
Soon it's time for The Division 2 and that will truly test how much I like FO76, because TD1 is my favourite game of this generation.
---
wish I could give you gold for that one.
---
What about simple things, like the unknown/(know) issue? There was a mod for that. The Bethesda fix was buggy while the modders fix worked. To me, it seems like there are plenty of places where modders can still help. Bethesda games have one of the best modding communities.  
---
About a month ago I told my friend: 
---
" I think Bethesda is trying to run this game into the ground so they can just put it behind them" 
---
Every week it feels more and more like that is the case. 
---
Slightly off topic, but I thought they fixed it so you couldn't get mods off weapons you crafted then scrapped.
---
I saw that and I dot now why. Here is the link again: https://github.com/bugthesda
---
To the mods: Do you really think that this is self promotion?
---
Lol.  We don't buff things 'round these parts 
---
Honestly I don't know if chameleon effect stacks.. I use full weightless and chameleon mutation instead..
---
And don't worry it won't be a 10-20% nerf which is normal. No you'll get a 75% nerf and slap like a wet noodle because it's better for the game and we don't want you rushing the content which is non existent anyhow.
---
They don't need to be held accountable. The outrage machine is ridiculous and it's not helping anything. It's what killed the game before it even launched. They've been open about things and have tried to do right by people. They're patching the game constantly, and they never lied about what you'd find in the game. Battlefront 2 has been out for over a year now and at no point has it received the kind of support this game has from its developers. Todd said multiplayer games are difficult and they're going to have a lot of issues, he literally said that, and they're still supporting their game and trying to make it better while children like you bitch and moan all day. If developers who constantly deliver good games trying something new bothers you, you're the issue. Get over yourself
---
Sadly it doesn't fit their narrative, so of course they'll ignore that fact
---
And thats how games are meant to be played. I'm assuming your putting multiple pad-locks on your fridge and toilet to keep up with your consistent trend of doing things.
---
Okay at least it's noticed...
---
Okay brainiac. So could that extend to the cunts who are doing all the bad shit that people have such problems with? Those guys are just doing there jobs ripping us all off right? Surely that makes it okay? Think of there poor families if they don't shit all over us ya selfish fuck! 
---
omg nasty comment in the reply :-( I'm so sorry to read that, I hope you stay strong and keep that thick skin. There are too many children around here, they shoulda increase the game's rating 
---
This . Exactly! You've seen the code so many times it looks right to you, I mean hell, you wrote it, how could it be wrong! Lol
---
I definitely agree they seem like a smaller team, with limited peer review and qa time. I imagine PMs saying "ok, you have 1 week to deliver 300 hours of work.....aaand go!" 
---
Aquila non capit muscas.
---
Are you really trying to argue with this guy? 
---
Don't.
---
When your keyboard finally gives up on a saturday night 9pm while you are gaming with no replacement in the house, you will regret having wasted any keyboard strokes on people like this.
---
How people act in video games is a good representation of how much of a dick they really are.
---
I accrued those hours across three characters in my spare time over November/Christmas. I haven't actually played the game since they at least announced the changes that were made with this latest patch.
---
I *was* just farming Whitesprings nuke zones and materials for ammo crafting, but they fixed the Whitesprings zones, and now all my weapons aren't worth the effort of farming materials for them due to the nerfs to Two Shot and Explosive.
---
update makes the game worse and even more glitchy
---
fanboy: it's getting better

You won‚Äôt get banned this way AND your gf/wife/parents will get off your ass for always playing games :P
---
Exept they already have everyone's money. If you wanted to protest you shoulda never bought the game in the first place, or do a chargeback
---
People are selfish for looking out for their immediate family. Lmfao let me know when you‚Äôre done with Puberty and have spent 5 minutes in the real world kid. Then we‚Äôll talk.
---
Don't give them the same name! Makes it hard to delete if your trying to do it late at night lol
---
I made all of mine look the same and just called them the build names for ease :) Its as close to Perk load outs as i can get atm.
---
Fallout 76 is the DLC, the Atom store is the real game. Launched without errors first day!
---
what platform?
---
This is the same thing in essence, only  with more edge.
---
Just respect their right to post.
---
If that's the dodge thing, then I'm getting it too and I dont have it equipped either. I was like "wtf is this half nekkid dood doing dancing on my screen?!"
---
Because Bethesda wouldn't do that? Or because there's no way modders can help?

So I'm lvl 112, true melee glass cannon through and through, I run with health high enough for you to blow on me and I'll die (thank God for Sependipity), I see the wanted player notification pop up on my screen, low and behold lvl 107 in the middle of a group of &lt;lvl 20 guys down in white springs getting griefed, one shotted this douche and the oppressed were freed, reach out to high lvl peeps on your server, we were in your shoes, let us help.
---
the fanboys for buying clearly known broken game even before launch
---
Yeah realising my mistake. I forget morons/children also use Reddit. 
---
Both sides are being way to extreme. 
---
You claim one side are nothing but fanatics who are blind. 
---
Your side comes off as conspiracy nutjobs, where only you can see the truth. 
---
It's a game. They made mistakes. None of us know the reason why. They said they are going to fix a lot of things they broke or messed up in a hotfix.
---
Get over it.
---
Both sides. 
---
Daily reset based on what? IP timezone so you can VPN and exploit vendors? 
---
People already had TSE shotguns and they kept playing :^)
---
why not?
---
How the fuck is needing TSE weapons nerfing EVERYTHING? For fuck sake people they're not going to give you your God weapons back if you just keep bitching about it. 
---
"One the company can not afford" I don't think it can get any worse 
---
Please provide your game ID so i can report you. 19 is way too high and very suspicious.
---
Best game i've ever enjoyed without buying it or playing it, it just keeps on giving.
---
Good work as always. Why people would down vote this, I will never know.
---
The Beckley one you need to make sure to get the blue price sign and the pumps in the picture. 
---
There's some "fun" to be had? Cool. Tell us more.
---
Yeah! you defend your purchase and experience even when it has massive chronic development, PR and monetisation issues. Even when the company you got it from lied continually and in full knowledge of what they did. 
---
Let's add in the fact that you're not the only one playing the game and people are entitled to shit on the game if they bought it. 
---
If cooperations didn't face backlash they would keep pushing the bullshit bar out. They aren't our friends at the end of the day. 
---
The reason so many people are doing it vocally is because they want to like the game and they want Bethesda to wake up and see that they can't do this to loyal customers. Example: I go to a restaurant and the wait staff is rude to me for no apparent reason, I never go back. 
---
Haha. You're a daft little twat. You need a good kicking lol
---
Double check it's not in the KNOWN plans section.  Known plans appear to be by account, not by character.
---
Universal, not local. It's how it works in Destiny and it works for the community.
---
Silent sniper.
---
Universal reset. It works in the Destiny community.
---
Haha, you call this a poll? Dude this isn't data. I took it at 8:28, used incognito mode and took it again at 8:29. So basically someone can inform the outcome by resubmitting answers.. give me a break
---
Thing is, the higher level players are the ones who will spend money on atoms.  They need players like OP.
---
It definitely seems to be. But also the weapon cards seem to be as well. I tested it on my friends TSE Gauss rifle and the math is not adding up there either. 
---
"stealth power armour". What else do you want? A stealth Abrams?
---
Power armour is a single man tank, plenty of lore explains ythat they're as loud as they are bulky. If you want to be stealthy don't wear it, but don't come asking them to adjust the game to your playstyle
---
Always was really. Melee is king in this game since BETA. TSE gun only gave us a chance of actually being able to use ranged and do more than tickle enemies.
---
They want us to play skyrim in fallout pretty much. Melee is boresome and mindnumbing in FPS games. No fun.
---
Ever single post in this subreddit get downvoted. I think people here just want to see the subreddit/game burn.
---
Yeah, pretty much just chasing legendary items.  I'd hit West Tec, Whitespring, the AWOL event, Uranium Fever, looping Watoga...  Basically anywhere legendary items were going drop, I'd be there.  
---
That's how you find "rare" items.  So many people saying "I spent four hundred hours palying and never ran into ONE tse anywhere!  You had to have cheated!"
---
Uh, nah.  I just spent weeks chasing good shit exclusively and not doing anything but hunting legendaries.  You'd be amazed at how stacked out you can get if you exclusively farm only places where 3* creatures are going to pop up.
---
Actually  it was. And everyone like this. Bethesda needs to see all the people they are losing mo eyes from by not fixing there game.
---
The only people praising this game are Bethesda PR shill accounts. 
---
Nothing in the game should give double damage. Nothing. 
---
And I'm a person who has Demo, and I'm a person that has other Grenade perks.
---
I'm the person my group gives all their Nuka, quantum and frags too. I'm the person always shouting "GRENADE"
---
I'm fine with the change. Because nothing should double the damage in this game. 
---
Its more than just a guilty pleasure. I'm a vulture circling the struggling beast. More fuck ups by Bethesda, more people leaving means the quicker the price will drop for me to buy it.($20+) I want to play the game but I want to pay what I think the game deserves.
---
Did I miss when they boosted enemy health and armor?
---
Quit your bitching. For everyone that wasn't running around one shotting shit the game is exactly the same. My AA lever action still takes 2-3 shots to down a super mutant warlord same as it did before the patch 
---
&gt; I used the known plans mod since it came out. No issues, worked perfectly.
---
It's actually reported to have at least one bug, that it is per player rather than per character.
---
Amusingly Bethesda's version has the same bug...
---
10/10, this culture of outrage is insane. People think constantly shitting on a game will create results in their favor, but it actually does more harm overall. None of these people want Bethesda or 76 to succeed. They say they do, they say they love bethesda games and want nothing more for them to succeed, but their actions show otherwise. Its the craziest shit ive ever seen. 
---
"I wonder what is in that building' feels like the sort of thing that is exciting for the first 50 hours or so till you realize the answer is always "scorched" / "super mutants" or "robots" and "nothing" 
---
Not only is that a false statement but this game is beyond broken- use your defense and give me any game to compare it to FO76 and you lose your own argument 
---
Oh please, don't be yet another arrogant bitch.
---
Bethesda has your money. Unless you do a chargeback they won't give a fuck what you do once you've paid them
---
Glad to see more people doing this. I do every time I‚Äôm at a train station vendor. It‚Äôs always at least ammo, sometimes food in the closest suitcase/lunch box to the vendorbot. 
---
10/10!!
---
I didn‚Äôt mean literal stealth power armor my friend i simply meant like bring the old design where it gave you that feeling of being more ‚Äústealthy‚Äù , I much prefer the older fallouts power armor do to the less bulky factor 
---
This happens a lot with the perks that repair on hit. i don't use em but every now and then the sound and image pops up as if it just triggered on me.
---
With the further nerfs to XP and nerfs to caps, I don't know how anyone can deny they are slowing progression down to hide the fact there is no end game content. 
---
I know there is a certain subset of gamers(I call them sadists) that really really like grindfests. They don't care about the carrot at the end of the stick, they just care about the stick. I.E the people who have gone through Destiny 1 and 2, and still defend those games. Then you have people who are either just shills or fanboys. These are the ones that reply to insane things like saying they "love the realistic survival nature of the game" but then go on and defend items weighing more than their real world counterparts. They also say things like "well if that's the way the devs want it, we should just accept it and be thankful for it". Basically, it's all about the GRIND man! The GRIND!!!!1111!!!!!!
---
I went into 76 blind. I purposely didn't check out info on the game. That's on me. For me, day one, I already hated the survival aspect of the game. Before all the arbitrary bs, and it really is arbitrary for the sake of being arbitrary, I felt like the game was more tedious than fun. It's only gotten more tedious and less fun with each patch. But hey, I only paid $30 for the game(rest was giftcard) so I would say I got my money's worth. I did learn a valuable lesson though. Never again, and I say this as someone who has been buying Bethesda games since Morrowind, never again, will I buy a Bethesda game day one, or even in the initial release window. 
---
Explosive weapons suck. I mean they always sucked but the demolition nerf just made them suck more. Though in defense of the numbers, it is a video game and an *actual* nuke would kill you and everyone else in a half mile radius :p plus the nuke is AOE and black powder is a single-shot weapon with a painfully slow reload speed.
---
No one cares you attention seeking twat. Just leave.
---
Too much of a nerf? They're still among the best legendary weapons in the fucking game. Having to shoot shit more than once doesn't make something a fucking bullet sponge. 
---
Wrong because DLC is free. Most the money they were going to make is atom shop items.  But when they lose half there business guess what no money to be made.
---
Exactly this here. My weapons were doing all around 100-400 dmg pre patch. Not even that overpowered in my opinion, there was one exception which is TSE harp and it did like 1.5k. melee has always done 15k damage.. I don't understand why TSE got nerfed THIS hard. Maybe there was some room for nerf but not friking 190% downgrade :D
---
&gt;UIPipboyEmoteAnimFingerGunHoliday2027 added (EdNote: That is what I call "Being Ambitious")
---
I mean i don't know if i agree with "pack mule" characters carrying 16,000 lbs of junk. But you don't deserve to get banned either. 
---
People already just served hopped until they found the best plan. 
---
Now you just play the game and collect caps until you can buy the best plan. 
---
For real! 
---
Only just noticed this:
---
&gt;**Bethesda**, it is by no mean imaginable acceptable to remove an item previously acquirable in game (red tactical headlamp), change it a bit and making it an Atoms Shop exclusive. This practice must stop now, be reverted, and apologized for. I don't care if it was Zenimax's decision or not, you are the same entity. Those anticonsumer practices must stop. 
---
Talk about burying the lead. This is indeed a BS practice.
---
OP, are you going to make a separate post about this to highlight it?
---
Yeah but... you know the story, OP. Long list of fixes and I'd imagine those that are "in your face observable" will be prioritized. Hope I'm wrong ; )
---
Its an absurd they nerfed TSE guns only to keep melee one shotting stuff like they have been since BETA. TSE made guns viable pretty much.
---
Store, sell or drop some of your regular armor pieces.  This happens to me when I‚Äôve picked up several new pieces and then goes away when I sell them. Not sure if it‚Äôs certain legendary effects on different pieces causing it or what but it‚Äôs certainly annoying. 
---
The unfortunate answer is that it was more than likely out of sheer boredom. There is no endgame content I'm only @lvl70 and after 10 mins of being bored out of my skull I finally just start chasing randoms down and blowing shit up cause THERES NOTHING TO FUCKING DO. All that being said, I'm sure I've been a dick but building a camp takes time and resources. Blowing that up is over the top 
---
Which currently results in bans, right?
---
(According to a few threads)
---
Probably not, but the majority of these issues all branch from the initial release of the game. So just to play the devils advocate; not all blame rests on Austin. 
---
They have confirmed that they mistakenly merged old code so I don‚Äôt have to decide which seems more realistic. 
---
Yeah it's broken beyond repair atm. You really should submit a ticket like I did also.
---
20$ a skin on a 60$ game is not enough for you to call it shit?
---
In other words, the main problem in the game is how the damage/energy resistance works. I didn't think they went ahead with this approach seeing as multiplayer was an added factor, but the fact that you don't get health when leveling to 50 is confirmation. Why they decided to go with this approach instead of a rating that determines the % of damage resistance is crazy to me. I remember this being in Fallout 4 and it was absolutely terrible. Not only would this have made balancing weapons easier, but it would've given incentive to some perks, especially the Endurance attribute.
---
The way things work right now, you can't just increase the damage and everything will be fine, all the stats that I mentioned will still play a factor in making the weapon stronger than intended, which means you would have to reduce one of the stats considerably to compensate for the damage. This is the real issue here and needs to be addressed. Thank you for bringing this up.
---
Read your sentence, and the reread your last comment before that.
---
&gt;No, realism is nowhere close to the issue...sorry.
---
Yep, I have a couple snapshots I posted to twitter with living-dead animals.. dogs, and opossums 
---
Again doesn‚Äôt mean I at all hate this power armor I mean it‚Äôs nice strolling in deflecting nukes by punching them as they fly but I at the same time miss the old design and in no way want it for just my playstyle 
---
Unfortunately, I completed my quest for the black diamond early on at around level 30. My black diamond is long gone. I've moved on to bloody mole miner gauntlet. 
---
Farming always felt cheaty and exploity. It's way too boring and I don't feel like it's the right way to play the game.  
---
10 Go to known good enemy spawn
---
20 Kill said enemies
---
30 Change servers
---
40 GOTO 10  
---
I have deep hatred for people that farm but I don't know how to express it and why exactly. I hate farming.
---
I don't understand this part. Maybe I got lucky...
---
When doing the Fire Breathers quest in (Belching Betty?), every Scorched in there was around level 68. 
---
I was around level 20, and I still made it through. I died a couple of times, but I honestly had no trouble killing enemies 40 levels above me. 
---
Seems like you‚Äôre the one who hasn‚Äôt been playing video games, or maybe you‚Äôre just attracted to shitty games.
---
It's a fucking shooter game, what they think is that people should be spending time shooting shit instead of just mowing groups of enemies down in one or two shots with an explosive weapon. 
---
all you have to do is google that its dead you are seriously a moron if you think anymore then a few people play it why the fuck do you think they made it 15$, and yea dont buy it but it shows game is in a bad state if they are charging more money for a costume then the game itself....even games with bad micro transactions rarely have shit thats more than the game itself
---
How you notify Bethesda on bugs is up to you and doesn‚Äôt really play a part in this conversation.  Someone‚Äôs discussing the game in the games subreddit.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how you didn‚Äôt get my point.  I was pretty straight forward and said
---
 you‚Äôre bitching about someone bitching about the game
---
We are two months from launch. Calm.the.fuck.down.
---
Or go play another game... when Bethesda finally gets it right, you can either stay stubborn and not come back, or you can come back and pretend you never were mad in the first place.
---
Not defending their choices at all they know they fucked up we sure as shit let them know they fucked up at any chance we get.
---
Give them more time. GTA/WoW/sky all shaky launches and patched repeatedly, and 2/3 of those games are made by big names soooooooo maybe give them more time and assume there‚Äôs a 40 hour work week in their lives and not a 24 hours in a day 7 days in a week so they have 168 hours a week to fix their games...
---
I don't know what they think they'll get, but they are receiving account bans for playing legitimately. Maybe they'll buy a second copy. This is the best entertainment game i've ever witnessed even though I never played it &amp; never plan on buying it, fascinating to watch the blazing inferno dumpster fire burn for 3 months.
---
PvP move is where growers go, why deal with slap mode if you have open PvP? Really the argument is redundant. Pve is for all you G rated dwellers, and PvP is for R rated raiders. if you go to pvP then expect to get run over. PvE is for hand holding date night RP gamer ( if that's your good I guess) this will inject a lot of cash into this scenario. Read the story of Conan exiles.. buggy as hell but got the company out of bankruptcy.. lots of fun too
---
I am level 170 and 40 points not attribuate...
---
It‚Äôs cracks me up that people are still trying to defend this game. I give props to the fallout fan boys- sinking with the ship
---
Well OP had 16,000 pounds of scrap from crafting and scrapping weapons (allegedly).  Do 22 guns worth of scrap come near that?
---
My hubby and I both play, but we only have one Playstation so we can't play together :( But I'm level 97 and he's like 70...
---
You should edit the OP to clarify. 
---
One thread.  Hard to put a lot of faith in the word of a person who was banned though.  I‚Äôve crafted and scrapped dozens of of items in a row without issue. 
---
Upset players are not telling to "us", they are telling Bethesda as their got representatives here. Don't like the posts just don't read it.
---
Ohh ho ho.. They aren't listening lol.
---
Yeah, I can accept one tragically flawed game but the way they are responding is just sad
---
why yes? what it'll change?
---
I like his content, but fuck me, right?
---
Anyways... patch on paper looked great - much needed balancing changes and some bug fixes according to the notes.
---
He commented on it. 
---
Patch then turns out to be a fuckfest of new bugs and old ones brought back and it now faces a ton of backlash from the community.
---
This is what youtubers do. Whats the problem here? 
---
Your getting downvoted, but you're not wrong. Not at all. 
---
It's the way the devs use it that's the problem. It's based on an engine that was designed for online play.
---
As for the rest, the devs are the ones that design the gameplay systems, crafting mechanics and everything in between. All of which have thier own special brand of problems. 
---
They prioritise what to patch and how to implement it. If the rest of the community can see what a bad job they're doing I really fail to see how the devs can't. 
---
Not to mention all the crap outside of the game. 
---
Honestly, if they released this as Early Access for like $20-$30 now and then full price at launch, I don't think anybody would be complaining
---
Apparently this can happen with plans which you received as part of a quest chain. I think you get the small water purifier pretty early on from following the Overseer's breadcrumbs.
---
Thanks for bringing this to light.  I didn't realize the modders were acting like an unofficial support community for Bethesda (FOR FREE), and yet that assistance was going unacknowledged leaving much of the game very broken.
---
Huh? 
---
Damn I just crafted few leather armor for the weekly atom challenge lol
---
Sorry you wasted your time on such a bad game lmao
---
I agree. Having the survival aspects in "adventure mode" seems to not really fit when they are introducing a "survival mode". I think the survival thing is why this game got some of it's initial backlash before release. People were excited multiplayer Fallout. Most people didn't ask for survival Fallout. 
---
The dumpster
---
‚ö†Ô∏è A lot of people are gonna tell you to not get the game but don‚Äôt listen to them ‚ö†Ô∏è 
---
Ah the oldest last standing defense in the book for this game
---
Personally no. I said what I had to say. If anyone else feels the need report it, please make sure that you confirm this is how it is working right now. I can see the changes in the game files, but I had no time to confirm it in-game.
---
Considering I gave *my* opinion, I can't be wrong. You can prefer server hopping all you like mate. 
---
I enjoy my RPG's but, I don't think forcing the "Trinity" would be the way to go (considering Beth's lack of experience with Online/JRPGs).
---
Final Fantasy 14 has similar randomized dungeons (Palace of the Dead + Heaven on High), but they allow 1-4 players of any class to enter.
---
So, +1 for randomized Dungeons, but -1 for the Trinity aspect.
---
I take it SSD space is a concern for you? or are you the one that doesn't do insurance because the thought of protecting your investment is just nutz? 
---
I have been playing games a long time and will use what I got to protect my money (the $250 I spent to buy the game for me and two of my Friends and 5k Atoms) from jackasses that ruins it for everyone. because as you can see the OP made a couple guns and now lost out on a $60 dollar game (if the shit show that is Bethesda does make things right) I have 4k rounds for my Telsa and another 2k rounds for my Gauss never have I duped to get that I farmed Watoga and schools for Lead Steel and Plastics, and when making ammo with Super Duper Perk card and the ammo crafting card you can hit a lot of ammo fast and something like this might happen to me so yes I will continue to "be crazy".
---
TL:DR Record your game play, make Bethesda look even more like dumb-asses.
---
yup and ***everytime*** i get into my power armor it has no frame and i cant exit the thing. the last time this happened (just now) I had to close the game with the task manager. been playing today for 2 hours  with 2 server disconnects 1 CDT and 1 TM shut down. oh ya and 10 bobby pins are a pound AGAIN.....
---
With Bethesda games the last two were provided by the modding community. They have never had to do this kind of work all by themselves.
---
Yes, but rarely anyone likes dumping 20 bullets in an enemy if you can grab a board and one hit it.
---
Not to mention that cutting that bullet count to 4-5 would be much more enjoyable.
---
Nah, keep it coming. They deserve this backlash. Now they are fucking over the few who stuck with them after all the previous BS.
---
I'm seriously considering switching from a rifleman build to a heavy weapons/shotgunner build (just for something new, as much as I like my gauss rifle, hauling around another rifle for close quarters work and not having the X-01 shocks to compensate  is sucking up a lot of weight) so I'll be interested to see what happens with them. Your post has a lot of good info in it and will hopefully make someone in the dev team at least think about it.
---
yeah sorry my stupid ass phone autocorrected that, if you link porn over skype and use the same account for xbox live. 
---
No they were both nerfed they now do an additional 25% base damage. It‚Äôs in the patch notes 
---
"Paw, why didn't you come back with the milk 25 years ago?"
---
Wait, wrong paw.
---
There‚Äôs a couple methods still out there- chat with some people from the bazaar if you want to find out
---
I wish. My wife just criticizes me for playing.  
---
‚Äú I don‚Äôt understand games that don‚Äôt end‚Äù 
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
And when enough ppl stop going the restaurant can or may change.
---
But standing outside the restaurant to protest about their poor service makes you look like a stalker
---
Let your actions speak louder then your words
---
Don't buy until they fix this game.
---
They didn't. Which is exactly why they've nerfed xp gains consistently. 
---
They weren't expecting us to finish their game so quickly. 
---
"Other people who have different opinions than me are dumb and wrong"
---
This one got me too. 
---
Also had it happen with a Delbert recipe, but those are found items and those always seemed different from other recipes anyway. 
---
&gt; Companies don't take advice from modders, period.
---
Because *Team Fortress 2* is a game that was never made.
---
"porn on skype" apparently open is the auto corrected work on my phone for porn. 
---
I do this all the time and hope so badly that somebody happens along it and gets enjoyment from it üëç
---
The bug was always on Bethesda's side, never in the mod.  Known plans used the data provided from within the application, so it make sense that the issue persists - garbage in, garbage out.
---
Strength build. But I'd wait for new content first
---
Just coming up on 600 hours. Two characters main (level 250) Alt (level 75). Most time is spent collaborating with the others in our crew, helping them with quests, crafting/modding guns and armor for them and my characters and hunting down 'god roll' legendaries. I tend to avoid grinding when I can but have done around 200 queens and probably 100+ whitesrpings nukes. 
---
I'd have hung up the game long ago if not for the community. We've run any number of challenges including:
---
Trying to make awesome themed camps
---
Races through areas/events
---
Timed West-Tek runs
---
Timed Nuke Silo Runs (personal best 14 mins 12 seconds)
---
Treasure hunts
---
Practicing random acts of kindness with other players in world
---
Roleplaying (to a certain extent anyway...Ad Victorium)
---
I'm not bored yet and keep a 'game diary' where I set out planned activities and challenges and see them through. Am looking forward to more PvE content however.
---
What I posted in the now removed post  
---
While Bethesda asked the community to report bugs and propose feature requests, they never gave us the right tools to do so in an organized fashion that will help both Bethesda and the community...
---
So in the classic Bethesda fan style, I took up the mantle to at least try and bring out what they should had done from the beginning...
---
## Introducing [Bugthesda - Community Issue Tracker for Bethesda games](https://github.com/bugthesda)
---
Bugthesda is a github "organization" were community members can open Issues (bug reports, feature requests, etc.) for games developed by Bethesda Game Studios. Right now there is only a repository for Fallout 76, since I do not want to interfere with the bug tracker the guys over [AFK Mods](https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/) (they guys that bring us the Unofficial Patches), and cause double duty.
---
This endeavor requires the participation of the community and it will need some people to take moderation roles to keep it in check. So, is you are interested, send me a message.
---
I fully hope that Bethesda will take advantage of this, so /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ /u/LadyDevann /u/ LoneVaultWanderer /u/FurySevenSix /u/kindofsquishy /u/Valseek pass the note.
---
### Visit Bugthesda at https://github.com/bugthesda
---
P.S. You will need a github account to be able to post and comment.  
---
P.P.S. /u/Aten_Ra your effort was part of the inspiration for this. I hope that this will ease up your effort of updating that list.
---
I started on launch day, so I was actually in your same position when it came to BETA players being higher levels. Top of the World &amp; Ash heap breadcrumbs were a full stopping point b/c everything was 40+.
---
 I also found out that if you wait till 50 to do all the quests, you will get leveled reward legendaries. So this incentivized me to figure other ways to level, which is what I typically do in other FO games. Found side quests, lots of exploring &amp; clearing locations, crafted, etc... It's not ideal for a normal MMO, which has streamlined questing to the endgame, this is more of a mucking-about questing, of the attitude "things will get done when they get done" since there is no real endgame as of yet. 
---
It would be great if they could add some way to scale the mob to you in the mixed areas or match the players that are closer to lower levels that align with a minimum level req on the zone. 
---
People get angry and just wanna vent :/. Sometimes it‚Äôs constructive and sometimes it‚Äôs just plain childish. 
---
Or, get this, Bethesda could do it themselves? 
---
LOL,  and here I usually say, "If you're gonna fuck me over, at least pull my hair."
---
And you really think we need another smart ass comment from another person from the loud ass minority? Notice how the main post when it came to explosives before the patch barely reached 1.2k upvotes? The current one after the patch from the community of silence has reached 5k+? Yea because smartasses like you want to push the game to the point where nobody plays anymore. Then you will be the same person complaining that the servers are dead. That small loud mouth minority needs to quit and give the vast majority the enjoyable game back without a bunch of crybabies. This patch wiped out a huge majority of actual fallout fans. Not the fan boys who started on fallout 76 and think they‚Äôre fans. I‚Äôm talking the actual community that has played fallout since it originated and completely enjoyed the games. The current issue is their listening to the community who isn‚Äôt going to buy their next game because it will not be an mmo open world. When they should be listening to the community that has been playing since the beginning of fallout. 
---
You're meant to make choices on what to keep and what to sell/trade/scrap/abandon.  Like every other game where there's limits on how much you can carry.  inventory management isn't a new thing Bethesda created to torture you.  The game is not made so you can hoard every little thing in the rare situation where you might use or need it.  
---
This is like watching people who have only camped with an RV or at sites you can drive up to struggle hiking into a camp site because they're incapable of editing down what they want to bring.

I believe I read that if you have a workshop you are open to pvp. I don't know if they have to try to to take it from you or not. I'm not 100% sure about how the pvp works.
---
The recent weight cap also prevents you from picking up items once you are at/past the limit; however, they didn't account for crafting  items or quest rewards obtained while at/past the limit.  The system saw you gaining items when it should have been otherwise impossible to do so, so it assumed you were exploiting.
---
It's not forcing trinity if it only applies to one dungeon. I would be happy with one group required dungeon and the rest solo-able. Even if the group doesn't have to be based on the classic party set up.
---
Delete this thread lol
---
I am a stealth-based player too, and I noticed no change yesterday. My sneak character played over 2 hours and had normal results. Just wondering what platform you are on?
---
I was pitched a game that could be played both 'single player' and with people and for the most part my experiences with people has been locked to just having them visit my camp/visiting theirs or seeing them out in the world so often. Locking content behind the requirement to team up with people when the game doesn't even support text chat is an insane idea, it'd be a clusterfuck. 
---
Does seem to be a lottery
---
&gt; Be cautious with their future games.
---
I won‚Äôt need to be. I‚Äôm giving them the ‚ÄúEA treatment‚Äù - which means I don‚Äôt buy their games until after at least 1 month after release so I can see what kind of mess it is. 
---
For Bethesda, I‚Äôm adding an additional requirement: no more Creation Engine. If they keep recycling this god awful engine, I‚Äôm not buying into it. It‚Äôs lazy, cheap and at the level of cash grabbing. It isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs an old engine, it‚Äôs that it is old *and* shit. And they only are dressing it up, then never address its core limitations and problems.
---
In the state in which the game rests, one would think, out of customer service, they would have just opened the ticket themselves.
---
If you paid attention from when they announced the gAme they said it would be this way and they would listen and fix the game as it went along. New type of mmo game which is going to take a while to get working correctly. The finished product may take a few years but the point is they listen to the consumer playing he game and adjust accordingly to make for a fun experience for the majority. I‚Äôm sure new dlc will be coming soon but give it time. Plenty of other games to play if your not happy. 
---
Wait when you craft stuff and scrap it, you can learn mods for it? I had no clue, that's awesome if thats the case.
---
I got a 2 star  Two Shot / Explosive Hunting Rifle off the Queen just an hour ago.  First tse i've gotten, but looks like loots were not nerfed.
---
they simply didn't update it in english language and that's it but CS:GO and Dota 2 are source games too but still my claim is true and you are still wrong.
---
there‚Äôs always one of them 
---
Nobody gives a fuck about their opinion being heard. They give a fuck about a studio that‚Äôs in over their heads actually getting proper resources/management to improve the game to where it has the potential to go. No idea why you are blasting that guy, he has legitimate complaints. You‚Äôre kind of an asshole in this one imo
---
lol you think they play.....
---
Make Non-Power Armor Grenadiers Great Again!!!
---
I think I have an idea as to what they were thinking and/or trying to accomplish. Many or most of the plans were level-gated, as Bethesda wanted you to be rewarded &amp; have access to those plans as you progressed and leveled-up. But, attendant to that level-gating they made that availability randomized over their servers, which was perhaps a way to keep some content feeling ‚Äúrare.‚Äù A coding error also caused some plans to be accidentally locked to most players (the handmade, for example).
---
Now, this system works for those who feel more casually about acquiring goodies, but this unintentionally led to large amounts of server-hopping for others. Players would hop for hours just to find 1 or 2 plans.
---
So, their solution seemed thus: stop the drudge of hopping for randoms, make plans guaranteed, players can build &amp; scrap for mods at their leisure, but with convenience comes increased prices. These prices may also induce players to purchase more selectively, which might be something they wanted, too.
---
Strength is my personal favorite, can do shotguns, melee and heavy weapons )
---
I‚Äôm a Strength and intelligence build
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying :/ I‚Äôd have understood if the workshop was involved, but it wasn‚Äôt. We were just there for an event, no one was taking it. 
---
They do also have to try and take it, which sets all their defences on you. Turrets etc 
---
I tried to make a light hearted joke in the wake of all the backlash and see that it was wrong. I‚Äôm sorry, it was never my intention to downplay player concerns. In a sea of negativity I try to find small things to make others smile, and this was not the appropriate time for that. Again, I apologize.
---
"Never played it" 
---
My boyfriend is level 6, I'm level 40. I'm thinking about starting an alt so we can struggle together because he just dies all the time right now lol. I'm constantly saving his ass. He's such a noob* according to our 11 year old. Hahahah. 
---
*he is actually very good at games but he doesn't play a lot of fps and this is his first Fallout. 
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer is the team aware of this one?
---
I think the point is say, if you play at 10pm one day, you get your 200 daily caps per vendor.  Currently you have to wait that 20 hours from the point you used them.
---
Currently you have to wait 20 hours or so since the time that you consumed those caps to get your next 200 limit.  So if tomorrow you played much earlier, you miss out.
---
But if the reset happened every day at a set time (say, midnight PST) then it doesn't matter when in the day you play, you can still get your 200 caps without missing a day.
---
And you‚Äôre including yourself in this comment, correct?
---
Go get pissed at people who were buying in game items for real cash on Ebay.  They established there's a market for that, that there's plenty of gamers who want a shortcut and are willing to pay cash for it.  So no shit Bethesda wants to get in on that.
---
the game is fun if you leave sides all the problems, if bethesda can repair it it will be a great game  the problem is that everything is so poorly implemented that leaves much to be desired in all aspects main missions secondary missions pvp in all it is a failure but if not man sky I can redeem fallout 76 can also let's just hope it does not take 2 years 
---
power armor stealth boy mod is your friend here 
---
Melee is king in this game since BETA. TSE guns only made guns overall viable because before that they would only tickle enemies. We are back at that situation.
---
Melee has always been able to one shot stuff and most absurd videos of kiling the queen in legit ways (not stacking explosive boubleheads) were made by melee.
---
Melee in FPS games are nonsense, its boresome and mindnumbing. Its absurd its the only viable way to play the game.
---
I started with a auto pistol slinger but now playing a heavy gun/ melee medic and enjoying it a lot more. If you‚Äôre on Xbox I‚Äôm happy to lend a hand üëç
---
So provide a link! You said you should use facts and not opinions, right? I gave proof that what you said is wrong and you haven‚Äôt provided anything to counter that! Go on, even a page in another language can work!
---
Made a second character to play with my girlfriend. I play melee, she plays with guns. I‚Äôve gotten ahead mostly from being better about managing buffs/getting hits on important enemies. That snowballed at some point to me being able to one hit things and her needing to distribute attacks to tag enemies for xp before I killed them. I‚Äôm level 61 and she‚Äôs 43 now I think

I hate that all plans are available. I enjoyed the gamble when I traveled to different vendors. No point in going some places anymore.
---
Whats the build? Is the character creator the same as FO4?
---
meh...
---
no, not the same
---
I run a power armor shotgun build that can switch to heavy guns and am trying to switch to melee 
---
similar but different if that makes sense
---
Since 2 and 3 star legendary enemies spawn very rarely, at least is it possible to make them drop a 2 or 3 star legendary item respectively?  
---
It's a disappointing anti-climax when you kill a 3 star mirelurk queen and you get a one star junkie's board. 
---
I'm on PC my d00d. PC Master Race.
---
that was their "fix" for the modus dupe where two players could connect and buy back an item one sold.
---
Get the game and just play it then once you get the hang of it and an idea how you like to play, either roll a new toon, or start re rolling your existing one 
---
all the times i have killed the queen there was not a single guy with a TSE ... people just suck, thats why they needed the OP broken weapons.
---
Moders act like there so much better and smarter then the devs how about you go make your own game from scratch 
---
So much absurd in here, in which world do you live where balistic is weaker than melee combat? Thats why modern USA soldiers rush in with axes right? LOL. I know very little about guns but even I know that a gun wound is devasting when it comes about most of the weapons in this game.
---
Build however you want to play because like with many online games developers will tweak things with each patch changing what works and what doesn't.
---
I have sth smiliar when I cook. Its all about servers' response time issue
---
I hear if you drink enough of the rum, it'll actually ...  \*nope.. can't say it... there's not enough alcohol in it to actually kill the taste\*
---
You know.. they can't even use 'quality controlling' the rum as an excuse for being drunk and screwing up everything else...  
---
That‚Äôs not helpful. There is nothing warning us about this in the game at all and it‚Äôs completely unreasonable for them to ban people jistnfor building and scrapping 20 guns in a row. I likely have done this in order to learn mods *because that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre requiring us to do.*
---
So since their process is opaque, we don‚Äôt know that your suggestion even works. And your suggestion simply excuses them by making us change our behavior and finally it will still result in innocent players getting banned because they had no idea such simple things the game encourages us indirectly to do will get them banned.
---
Wait the character appearance? You can change a lot, very similar to FO4 with some added features, though some things are locked on the Atomic Shop or whatever it was called
---
Your perk decision making is different, I‚Äôd say watch videos on it to get a clue
---
I quit
---
Just my opinion, but it appears to me Bethesda has deliberately trashed this game to limit game play, and server use, because they know that the rep this game is getting will not make them wads of cash.  All the bugs they had solved, they brought them back with this last update (1/29/19). Destroying everyone's weapons, messing with the weight again, that is deliberate and calculated to drive players off the servers.  As I said, just my opinion. I'm a little irrational about what they have done to this game and the money I spent on it. Until they fix this mess I'm gone.
---
Well this is a public forum and not a restaurant so that's where the example ends. This online space was made for this type of thing, if the company cared at all they would look at this feedback and fix something. 
---
It sounds good but i‚Äôll need a few changes
---
Well, indeed you did. The guy above is saying an axe is more damaging than getting hit by rifles in RL... I guess thats why soldiers have been using fire axes for the last 500 hundred years right? World war 2 was all about battle axes and fireman axes.
---
I think you're trying to equate the time to fix this specific issue to mean they've quit developing and working on it. You say as much in your post and you don't think that sounds a little exaggerated?
---
Sneak sniper. I play it with regular leather armor and crafted weapons. I one shot anything around my level and two shot most other things. I rarely use power armor...I just toss cores at train stations. I don‚Äôt use Aids. I have mostly damage and defense modifier perks. Other than that I put points in Ammosmith. 
---
It is very easy build because it is not armor dependent. I don‚Äôt notice much of a DR difference between wearing armor or not. I don‚Äôt tend to put myself in situation where armor really matters.
---
I hit Flatwoods and the Firestation for led before I start playing. That gets me around 600 rounds of .45 and 150 rounds of .308. More than enough for a few hours of playing. I carry a short range semi .45 and a long range .308. 
---
The downside is that it a slow paced game style (that can also be good). I also am often overweight because I did not pick any QOL perks like weight reduction. I carry a set if excavator power armor for fast traveling purposes when I am overloaded.
---
You can also get overwhelmed with this build if you agro a bunch if high level stuff. I got stuck in the facility where you build excavator power armor. I accidentally agroed everything after just entering. I git stuff in a bathroom stall and low on ammo. I had to keep opening and closing the stall door as I sniped Super Mutants...who are stupid to figure out how to open a bathroom stall door. Luckily I looted a few grenades and was able to toss them over the stall wall and into the pack of Muty‚Äôs. 10/10 would do again.
---
It gives you just enough power to feel OP when you want and just enough of a handicap to have some fun challenges
---
Do we know if protective can be bought, or just the first two levels?
---
They have had this philosophy for years, though. In Oblivion, the difficulty slider basically increased how much health everything had, and that's it. That's not difficult, that's tedious. 
---
I've got the problem where I unlocked new plans and the items just don't appear in my list. I learned a plan for some high tech table and can't figure out where in the list it's supposed to be :/
---
I dont like the change either, but I wouldnt frame it like this. Because it takes 9 points to get 60% for rifles. The way I would frame it is: demolitions weapons were balanced to need 100% damage to be worth the carry weight. They should have left it at 100% and just made it not affect legendary explosive damage.
---
the bright headlamp is where its at anyway
---
"Mrs. Zcsnightmare, zcsnightmare didn't make it. The machine was updated only to keep alive things that weigh 0.1, such as a bobby pin. But, don't worry, we let the techs know and they said it's going to be hotfixed maybe by the end of the week or next week. More people will die, but the techs are working hard to get it out."
---
Same with mods learnt from scrapping.  I could see it coming from a mile away.  I just knew they would mess it up.  They never ever look into things properly.
---
Another is the caps stash.  Ok we have moved a stash to a container, what perk cards would be affected? Oh right, cap collector.  
---
Mhmm.
---
My wife and I play together.  She is a lvl 74 Shotgunner build, and I am a lvl 79 Rifleman build. The lvl difference comes from being the primary weaponsmith/ammosmith/armorsmith.  That XP can add up when crafting/scraping weapons for mods.
---
I think there‚Äôs a stick up ur butt, I‚Äôd help again but it seems like it‚Äôs waaaaaaaay up there.
---
Anyway good luck with your rantings
---
The fact that you are such a low level makes me assume you rushed through and missed a lot. For example, I am level 65 and recently just started the enclave quest line. 
---
No, melee is NOT okay. It one shots stuff and has been doing that since BETA. Even the crapiest melee legendary can devastate enemies. The most absurd legit videos of fast killing the queen were done by melee.
---
Not sure what that even means but I hope you have the same sentiment for a guy who makes a thread bitching about people bitching and how bitching is annoying and theres nothimg to bitch about because he has nothing to bitch about. üò∂
---
Would you say all Magazines and Bobblehead stacking has been removed?  I see some changes (beyond Explosive), set to Peak Value Modifier.
---
I still like the game
---
This is absolutley the correct idea. From a gameplay perspective this would be a much needed post-game grind.
---
That sounds dope too.
---
This game is on par with farmville.
---
My wife is always 10lvls over me and i have more hrs in than she does, idk how but same happened in FO4 üòπ
---
Start farming nuke zones. If you don‚Äôt have PA, get some excavator power armor lvl 35 and head into a nuke zone. Also, start building an extremely detailed camp. I build a small town with a store and apartments. It took a while and was so much fun to build. 
---
Google search ‚Äúfallout 76 quests‚Äù The gamepedia link will give you a list of every quest you can do. You still haven‚Äôt done the brotherhood and enclave questline.
---
Trading, building new fancy camps, helping out newish players, generally exploring the map, and making new characters
---
Please tell that you are still monitoring some of the "nerfs" to certain perks and evaluating whether or not those "nerfs" were too significant a hit?  I'm trying to understand Bethesda's perspective on these "nerfs", but some of these things do seem like they adversely impacted QoL rather than brought the perks into balance.
---
If something like White Knight is "too good and is a must have", perhaps the underlying issue with armor degradation and repair costs needs to be reevaluated as part of a "nerf" to the perk.  (I recall Patch 4 adjusted certain repair costs, but perhaps that also needs to be evaluated.)  At it is, I may shift from using Luck of the Draw to Lucky Break given that change.
---
The same with plan recipes and whether or not the "premium" is a bit "too premium" when it comes to permanent availability versus RNG.  Especially given that vendor cap pools can make it somewhat challenging to earn caps.  I can understand that an increase may have been a necessity, but perhaps the increase was too substantial?  Especially without that being clearly relayed to the player base.
---
I'm looking forward to playing this weekend, especially if the hotfix hits before the weekend.  But it would be nice to know that these changes could be revisited in the future and revised if they show a detriment to game play.  I'm used to some chores in games (such as prepping for Raids in WoW), but those chores should be meaningful and not too much of a distraction to general game play or other activities.
---
Just because you bash your head continuously against a brick wall, doesn't mean you're a "true fan", it just means you're in an abusive relationship.
---
People need to stop seeing a company as their friend
---
Also, do the bunker buster quest to get into the enclave. Google it to find the spot to start, it‚Äôs easy of harpers ferry

I am convinced a good bit of the positive stuff is paid shilling.

"Thank you Bethesda for ....."

FFXIV was totally scrapped. I know because I had it on release and they started from the ground up. It was an insane undertaking and cost the company a ton of money. Ultimately made them a ton back but at this point, Bethesda is outside the range of being able to do that I'd think. 
---
Ahh sweet, ‚ÄúI was just trolling guys!‚Äù, the classic response of a coward. 
---
Upvoted so bethesda or any CM can see this.

This might help. May not be entirely comprehensive but you're missing some listed there.
---
That‚Äôs demonstrably false. 
---
At best like 1000 pounds (400 odd with excavator PA and 600 stash). 
---
Hmmm a hard choice, a 50cal might blow right through pretty cleanly if close enough but also might hit a bone and leave a 10+ inch exit wound as the shards of what used to be my shoulder are ejected behind me. Does the guy holding the machette look strong ?
---
I'm level 70, hubby is level 49 or 50. We only get the chance to play together when he has a day off and our son is at school (I have to hop on his console) but we enjoy our time when we get the chance.
---
We really ought to get another tv, though. My son has the game too, so we could be a whole family wandering the wasteland together!
---
If I was the CM, I would definitely pass this along for the giggles.
---
Strength is very important. You will run out of carry weight fast so level up your strength. 
---
If you can't get past the hand scanners, I'm guessing you haven't found the Enclave yet.
---
Holy Crap me too!!! That's to damn funny. They actually have duping in the game as a perk card!!!
---
I think it could add an interesting dynamic, if they ever roll out actual new content rather than patches ‚Äòfixes‚Äô...
---
Can't include realism at all, otherwise the .50 cal machine gun would do more damage than the rifles per bullet.
---
Let me say it before you say it- ‚ÄúI enjoy this game so that‚Äôs all that matters‚Äù 
---
Classic. 
---
&gt; Give them more time
---
He said...again.
---
I'm tired of people telling us they're quitting Fallout 76 in the comments and not with a proper post.
---
Sure,not double ,60% is fine as it is. But, refund the fucking points for those who wasted them.
---
I‚Äôve got a full set of T-60 with jet pack and calibrated shocks. Make an offer
---
You've said everything that I'm sure most of us have been thinking.  We love this game, we really do, but it's like that relative who keeps going to jail.  Eventually you just have to stop lending them money and going to visit because they just aren't learning.  They make one step to do better when they get out and take two and a half steps back.  It sucks.  But this mistake has been just the latest in an endless chain of confusing, frustrating and disheartening events, and there's new games out that I've been waiting years for, like AC7 and KH3 and I'm finding drastically fewer faults with either of them.  It's a painful but easy choice to decide where I'm going to spend my time.  
---
Bethesda, y'all need to fix your game.  You need to fix the people making your decisions.  Y'all need to fix everything.  You haven't lost me, just... I'll be over here on KH3 (with its endless cutscenes) for now.
---
Why did you wait an hour before server hopping?
---
I've logged just to upvote. 100% agree on that.
---
I find it immature and pathetic, but that is just me.
---
i prefer str because it increase melee damage.
---
By this logic melee should be the first thing to be nerfed as its OP since BETA.
---
you must be a fun person to hang around 
---
You literally just proved my point...
---
Upovoted so CM can see this and tell bethesda
---
Lol. People complain a LOT. Some of us modders have had to learn to do less in mods than we want to because people expect you to customize it to their personal experience and make it work in the way they want in their unique environment. Especially Beth games, and fallout even more than Skyrim. 
---
FO4 players are some of the most toxic people I've ever been exposed to in any modder community I've been involved in. 
---
it's called changing your opinion upon discovering critical information that defeats your previous claim and thus swaus you to the opposite side. it's what rational people do.
---
he didnt know about all of the problems of this patch when he made the video that talks about how good it is, and when he found out about them his opinion changed.
---
if he was truly a shill he would stick to his previous opinion in order to advance the agenda that he's allegedly shilling
---
Uh, the main quest? Still plenty left to do lol.
---
&gt;Reeee keep the game broken i want content NOW
---
Op's post in a nutshell
---
For Honor was a terrible game that suffered lack of support iirc, i don't really care what direction you think the sub is going in as im not going to be around it too much longer. 
---
&gt;writing like he's some great revolutionary
---
Making a passionate post on reddit? I think he just cares about the game lol, and honestly i admire a bit of passion. A lot of us have been fallout fans for a long time now, and we all feel a bit cheated by this last car crash. 
---
I don't think you realise the only people left here on this sub are people that have stuck with this game and struggled through it's flaws. Amd here you are like " lmao you can't change shit wtf is this post why care lol funny how upset you guys are this won't help anything" *downvotes everyone with a negative opinion because they are butthurt*
---
None of those examples come close to how broken FO76 is. I‚Äôm not denying the issues, but the weight of them doesn‚Äôt hold up
---
Damn straight. üñï
---
At least bitching is somewhat constructive; ‚ÄúI QUIT‚Äù posts are just cries for attention and/or karma. 
---
Can't really take you seriously after reading that you broke a headset because you were mad at a video game. Grow up and get help.
---
Yeah, where the fuck is he?
---
We should be finding him, and having a chat.
---
Ah. That‚Äôs why I was getting 9 strength from whiskey. I thought it was a booze buff for One Violent Night. Which is honestly a pretty cool idea. 
---
It did help me bare knuckle box the Nightstalker though, so that was cool. 
---
I‚Äôm actually giving Anthem a second look if that gives you any idea. I need a good co-op game and Fallout 76 is flailingly failing.
---
Yes. That means Bethesda failed so bad I‚Äôm seriously giving EA a tentative chance I otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have given them.
---
Thanks! I did!
---
No glitch is ever "suppose to be there in the first place".  That's why they are called a glitch.  And I would much rather they get the glitches fixed and the game stable than add new content with new glitches.
---
Thats another bugging item, 3‚òÖ Legendary dropping vegetable starch and 1‚òÖ items :(  
---
Hasn‚Äôt a new headlamp been added to the atom shop? Perhaps it‚Äôs misplaced code, I went to vendor Phoenix yesterday and there were still headlamp mods for sale.
---
Why downvoted? Buggethesda needs to lose rights on Fallout franchise.They spit on the customers and fanbase. Would you even DARE to think 20 years ago that today we will have a princess bed for real $$$ in a Fallout title?
---
When I say nothing ever stood a chance, that often involved me. That weapon is suicide.
---
The thing works as a sniper rifle because *something* will hit what you're aiming at. But every 10th time, a ghoul will pop out right in front of you when you pull the trigger, and everything in the area you are in will die.
---
Difference being, explosive (more so TSE) was so popular it got mass duped and melee not. They were more powerful than melee because they dealt high damage at range with much less perk point investment than melee
---
This is precisely the argument.
---
If that were the case, then the ‚ÄúI QUIT‚Äù posts aren‚Äôt going to make a difference either. 
---
*slow clap* 
---
Agreed!!
---
Greed. Thats why. 
---
It's to remove their dot from the map and to avoid random surprise attacks.
---
Some people just want to me left alone in their fallout world. Stealth is generally the way to do that as it makes it harder for people to find you. You can pick where you go with no on seeing you and again .. avoid annoying mobs that might just want to reach out and touch you.

Also if you want to know why they are playing a mmo, alone. Ask Pete Hines.
---
They‚Äôre more likely to cut their losses and not dump another second of resources into a game that is doomed
---
This past weekend I decided to leave. Looks like I made the right decision based on a lot of the posts I am seeing. 
---
I haven't logged on since Saturday and I don't plan to ever again unless they turn this around. 
---
What. A. Joke. 
---
For now I am happy though as I am turning to some single player games that I never got around to. 
---
Just started Horizon Zero Dawn for the first time and I do not miss Fallout at all after only a day into this game. 
---
The fucking tutorial gave me more excitement than any content that Fo76 has provided me. 
---
First, I've got two characters full limit (2x25k caps), so I really care less. Second, I work in the week and coming back home around 6:30PM, so by that time timer is reset anyway. Third, all items I won't be selling to vendors I'm leaving on the stations for other. 
---
The sub needs two megathreads for the "I quit" posts and the "I'm tired of the I quit posts" posts.   
---
I will test this on PC shortly and drop a note if it's happening or not there, strange how some bugs are platform specific but that's what you get when you design a game for one console and then try and port it to everything else.
---
I think an almost point blank TSE to a super mutants face should one shot it though..... it used to kill both it and you though :-)
---
People digitally sign/agree to a TOS that says they won't abuse exploits. People are being banned for violating the TOS
---
Oh my god. Who the hell cares
---
I don't think they've released any sale numbers, and with the servers set up the way they are, we have no idea how many people are playing.
---
The "vocal minority" are the five or six reddit accounts who show up in every thread and throw out insults to anyone who disagrees with the nerfs, or is fed-up with the bugs, etc.
---
It's that thing where someone goes through and makes sure things actually work, \*before\* they subject the general public to it... 
---
The fact that no one on the dev team caught that the merge didn't work, says a hell of a lot about the quality control in the studio.
---
...You can already add stars
---
You could just look at the difference in how the 2 games are handled and probably work that out. ZOS for all the bad stuff they've done are actually quite good at what they do and have made ESO into something. Why they didn't help BGS or why BGS didn't ask them though is beyond me.

Video games are literally built around putting all of your perks into one weapon, and if that weapon balancing is changed, you are *supposed* to be given a respec to fix your build.
---
Jesus 
---
You want to draw attention to the need for change in the game? Rent a billboard outside of the Bethesda studios and post your criticism there.  Posting it here means it is going to go through several layers of sanitization before anyone with the power to do anything sees it.  And if you want to be taken seriously drop the drama queen antics as those are seen as signs of immaturity and are not taken seriously by serious people.
---
I like that idea. Would also contribute to the secondary player markets.
---
Can confirm, it‚Äôs in one of the caches early on 
---
The delusion of the fanboys is insane. I can see people attacking the other people who are criticizing the game. That's gone on forever. But some people on here actually defended Bethesda when their support ticket system was doxxing people. I've seen people on this sub attack mods, like the known plans mod, acting like if it wasn't from Bethesda it somehow wasn't good enough. Even going so far as to tell people who were using the mod to "enjoy their ban" because they were "technically not playing the game the way Bethesda wants us to" 
---
I'm sure you're one of those people who think praising trump and thanking god for him everyday will make America great again yeah? 
---
What an idiot üôÑ
---
Yes üëç
---
Who wants 2 100GB games on their drive? You're high
---
inB4 they claim cap collector was a form of duping
---
Since it's still broken into 5 layers, why? So they can do what? Not have it at 60%? Put it in something else?
---
Here's the thing. There's no perk points. There's just SPECIAL points. And you can move those around. and it's never going to take 50 levels of grinding to respect your character. Simply because you don't have to move all the points around. 
---
You're still going to need all those SPECIAL points in INT to use Demo.
---
You must have just been born lol 
---
From the wiki:

The Summersville Dam a pre-war installation that powered the nearby towns and cities with hydroelectric power. It also created the artificial lake above¬†Charleston. This Dam would eventually be the downfall of Charleston as¬†David Thrope¬†of the¬†Cutthroats¬†raider gang would use a mininuke to destroy the dam and flood Charleston in an act of the revenge for the (assumed) death of his lover,¬†Rosalynn Jeffries.
---
It‚Äôs not that they wouldn‚Äôt be doing their job, it‚Äôs that we would no longer have a direct connection with them, they would still be doing things for the community.
---
Yeah, that's my plan. Maybe not a year, but I'll start playing again when they add new content. Hopefully by then it'll be fixed and balanced well. 
---
Think that's what they meant.
---
You can't learn it from scrapping, only from plans.
---
"We don't want you to ever play our games again because you're a cheating bastard. Money please"
---
&gt;  a fresh set of eyes says "Look at X" and magically I can see exactly what's wrong.
---
&gt; Allot of the small errors 
---
Ahem.  *A lot*.  Not *allot*.  Allot is a completely different word that means a completely different thing.
---
Just pointing out a small error with a fresh set of eyes :-)
---
Strength is now the only option for a high-damage build. Until they nerf melee for more "balance."
---
Plans are still leveled, so one must be at a certain level before additional plans appear.  
---
SO, in theory, there should not be a low level being able to buy the best gear until they are at higher level.  
---
Given the cesspool of code we are talking about though ‚Ä¶ 
---
Sometimes it really is better to say nothing at all when you have a bot that highlights how many times you say "Thanks for sharing so-and-so," and nothing else, especially when people are under the impression that the devs don't care.  It comes across as empty.  There are other responses that seem genuine since he actually has something of substance to say, but it feels really fake every time he simply goes "thanks for reporting that cody," or "Thank YOU for reporting this, we're really listening and working hard etc etc" especially since the devs seems to screw something up every week.  His empty words contrast Bethesda's actions as of the past 3+ months and it'd be better if he didn't say that stuff at all, or at least toned it back since we have a bot here that lets us keep tabs on just how hard Bethesda is forcing their community manager to bootlick people since they're in full damage control mode right now.
---
Or perhaps those defending and upvoting the game have grown weary of nothing substantial being done and are turning against Bethesda having finally given up on pretending things will be okay. 
---
This isn't an echo chamber. These people suddenly didn't start saying stuff because others did. They're saying it because it is the facts. Notice how people who once praised are beginning to make post finally admitting they're tired of it? People can change their opinions on their own without it being something echoed. It isn't that people are downvoting the praise. It is that the praise is slowly dwindling over time on its own. 
---
It comes from the scorched prefix it allows you to eat most creatures infected 
---
video game vs real life is not fair. real people are afraid of taking any damage whatsoever.  of course ranged is preferred in real life.  But now we use tactics, Army is the ground pounding melee, marines are the guns. So in that sense yes melee is still most common in today's military.
---
I wouldn't blame yourself. You didn't let down your friends. Bethesda let you down.
---
Hopefully you'll learn something from this experience and avoid getting burned again in future.
---
Ditto
---
I really only need those two pieces. No idea what a fair caps price is. 1000/per piece?
---
(You‚Äôre on Xbox, right?)
---
say all that bullshit to melee characters one-swinging most mobs and come back...
---
I‚Äôm taking a break after they nerfed the TSE. I spent about 400 rounds for my TSE Handmade to take down about 15-20 level 40 mole miners, where as previously it would‚Äôve been maybe 100 rounds. Then encountered a level 91 death claw and didn‚Äôt make a dent on it before being killed by it. 
---
#Bullet sponges don‚Äôt make a game more difficult, they just make them a chore.
---
u/ladydevann
---
They aren‚Äôt learning fast enough to keep the game alive 
---
I have an assassin robot peice. im working for the next 12 hours will check when i get home. believe its an arm
---
Probably because it seems naive and dismissive of the problems 
---
Bad
---
I'm pretending the whole fiasco is the end game content. It's been very sad watching a company I love go down the toilet like this, but it's also been kind of entertaining. 
---
Site blocked at work, got a pic somewheres else?
---
People reading and clicking.
---
You realize crafting 10 of something takes roughly 10 seconds, and the guy was using the super duper perk which sometimes creates a duplicate?
---
A 10 second process does not make someone a hermit or mean someone in their life is enabling them. Get s fucking grip.
---
If you‚Äôre building multiple stacks of 200+ combat armors at a time, you‚Äôll probably want to reconsider what is necessary to acquire all the mods. Really, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it unless you cause the server to become unresponsive several times as you craft.
---
Similar feelings. I want to play this game more but I don't know what else to do. I started a new character and this is pretty fun for now.
---
I'd've spelled it *I'd have*, just because the former doesn't feel right.  Even though it is right.
---
Imagine defending Bethesda after they released a game with broken explosives weapons that HEAL enemy's for TWO MONTHS. It's just unacceptable practice to fuck your customers over like this. A lot of people care, it's why everyone here shits on them. 
---
&gt; I work in the week and coming back home around 6:30PM
---
I work every day too.  Sometimes I get home at 7pm and start to play, then only play for an hour.  Sometimes I get home at 5pm and play, sometimes I don't play til 10pm.  
---
So the times I consume vendor stocks and my playtimes don't always line up well leaving me unable to get 200 caps on certain vendors each day.  Days that I end up using the vendor at midnight right before logging out, but the next day play for 1 hour at 5pm, mean I don't get that 200 cap reset.
---
I've played 60 hours. So hour and a half for each level doesn't seem TOO rushed. I have yet to survive an encounter with a scorchbeast and I've only just got my first set of power armor so I dont think I'm power leveling. 
---
100% YES!
---
Melee power armor. 
---
I have tried in vain to understand where Bethesda got the idea that Fallout fans wanted a PvP version of the game, Fallout has always been about the stories, nowhere have I ever read someone ask for a PvP multiplayer version of any Fallout game. The only conclusion I can reach is just trying to grab a market share of that game type while it's hot, and the rush to release for the sole purpose of getting in before the bubble broke as it seems to be doing this year.
---
Feels bad man
---
u/LoneVaultWanderer you might need to take a look into this.
---
Especially all the people thanking them in the thread about the most recent patch notes. The comments were almost overwhelmingly of WTF did you just do Bethesda kind, yet there was this undertone of people completely oblivious to the issues it causes, thanking them like everything was find and dandy. 
---
You feel awful because you are awful.
---
Todd Howard isn‚Äôt sitting back laughing becaus Fallout 76 sales didn‚Äôt make sales expectations. Based on stats from December Fallout 76 barely made back its marketing budget.
---
So you're on the conspiracy nutjob side?
---
Here's something you might not have realized. Everything that Bethesda does is meant to help the company make money. Even when they put out free apps or give stuff away. It's all about making money. 
---
Just because someone does something they enjoy or love, doesn't mean it's not also about making money. 
---
I'm an illustrator, and I love drawing. But my love of drawing doesn't blind me to making money, so I can make a living. 
---
So list me all the things that Bethesda makes that are public service products. Oh there's none. 
---
Ive played alot of pay to win games in the last 20 years, in the past some ive spent ridiculous amounts of money
---
\-this. Well said. Clap clap clap
---
Why are you encouraging them?
---
If you‚Äôre looking for a toxic free zone, this sub ain‚Äôt the place to be for a good couple of days
---
I have it at level 25 but I just dont have the ingredients to build lvl 35. It took me ages to gather enough stuff to finish the quest to build it at lvl 25. 
---
I‚Äôm constantly finding posts that deserve no downvotes on all sorts of subs, but have -5 or something. A lot of reddit users are just weird.
---
I agree but their are issues with this. 
---
If this was a game where the enemies had a working respawn timer/mechanics then your right but this isn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt count the amount of times I‚Äôve cleared an area only to find the enemies I killed at the beginning are already starting to respawn. So I then have to kill them again to leave the area or fast travel. Because of this I‚Äôm forced to carry around extra ammo because inevitably I‚Äôm going to have to kill double the intended enemies in an area at some point. 
---
Go back to Abbie's Bunker, read all terminal entries there and any holo tapes you find.  It should kick off 2 more main quests - you're only about halfway through the main quests.  You need to trigger Reassembly Required and Defiance Has Fallen.
---
Get a raider leg and take it to an armor crafting station to apply that specific mod. Those little yellow boxes are a one time use mod for weapons and armor/PA.
---
Huh good to know. I was wondering why my PA suddenly had that symbol next to it. 
---
Finally an "i'm leaving" post with some actual constructive criticism in it rather than "ree besthesda is bad and their game is bad"
---
See you on the other side, Dweller &lt;3
---
I‚Äôm having fun now, so I‚Äôm gonna continue playing.  I move my camp, build a little, explore a little, repeat.  
---
I leave ammo, plans, and vendor legendaries in the blue suit case at watoga train station all the time. I'm glad to hear others are as well. I'm actually due to drop off 1000+ rounds of shotgun shells and other munitions.
---
Ah okay I was on the wrong page there with where you stood!
---
But if a game goes on sale at the price FO76 does within a week or a month, that generally means that the game is selling well below expectations. I think in the UK alone it was reported that sales were down 80% compared to Fallout 4 at launch. Even if the numbers have improved over time, that's still an *astoundingly* low number of sales.
---
This is kinda like when someone replies all to a reply all email chain to ask people to stop replying to all, lol.
---
The modders just need to stop. Beth has been relying on them to fix buggy code that they never bothered to fix for hire many years now? 
---
He's trapped inside the welcome to Skyrim meme. 
---
U need the armor then u can apply the mod
---
Yeah Xbox. I‚Äôll do 1k per. Full set though only
---
They have unfinished and potentially un-named projects coming, but your right to think people are losing\quitting jobs over this.
---
Honestly the TSE nerfs helped the game a great deal. Now melee needs to get adjusted.. but that‚Äôs not the issue. The issue is old wounds getting reopened.
---
Sorry if I came off hostile, I'm just frustrated. I don't really want to break the game and exploit it, I just want a fair shake. 
---
Oh, so if I use it on a piece of armour I need to find another one to mod another piece of armour? Thanks by the way!
---
you just mod it in the armor workbench on the armor piece it modify - you just don't have to have required materials. But it's one-time-usage - you can't remove mod and modding another overwrites the currently used.
---
Maybe just tag them? 
---
Sounds like server lag. Not a bug.
---
Lol, this guy.
---
You on Xbox?
---
To two (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but my point stands) weapons with only two different effects possible, one for each, and both suck. You know what he meant, don‚Äôt troll.
---
There's no balance. There is only nerfing.
---
I'm 100% done with Bethesda. Since we have the free-market at all that, it's my responsibility never to buy something from them again. 
---
They could have made a "best of 2019" game and got tons of praise and promotion. Instead they would rather make a quick buck. Fuck that, I want a game that's finished by a studio that cares. (Not that the devs don't care, but whoever is calling the shots fucked everyone)
---
The fact that even after the nerfs my TSE auto handmade does *double* the damage of a nonlegendary goes to prove it's viable and people are still just crying because "muh glitch gun"
---
They aren't hotfixing the idiotic nerfs to XP, caps, and carry weight.
---
Yeah what about this guy?
---
I think something got lost in translation there. It‚Äôs more of a broad stroke that gamers neglect other real life things while they play.
---
But hey turn it into whatever you want. Your brain, your rules
---
THIS  
---
One side are cultists trying to lead us to riches in the Lucky Hill mine to feed to their dark god Todd.  
---
The other spouts off on how they "deserve"  X or are entitled to Y for their burden of whacking a pretend monster with a pretend stick and not being rewarded for your effort.  
---
It's a video game.  If you like it play it, if you don't like it...don't play it.
---
Playing on the PS4.  I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve noticed the water.  One thing I did notice was some nice cloud animation when I first started playing at launch.  But I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they made modifications since to improve performance.
---
Nope.
---
Bethesda may think it is all fun and games now but wait till the next game of theirs comes up for preorder.I do believe I will be waiting a month is so after lunch if only out of protest!
---
My TSE non-auto handmade does *less* damage than my non-legendary hunting rifle.  
---
Maybe if I put an automatic receiver on it and then invested in Commando perks, but...Jesus, really?  I already had my build set up the way I want it.  
---
Overreacting is the new meta.
---
 I agree, but what I hate most right now, is that most creatures in particular scorched beast have become massive bullet sponges the queen is invincible right now 
---
Some of us don't seem them as nerfs, but as balance.
---
The only people that seem to always cry nerf at every change are players who thing they should be able to oneshot everything in the game, get the top loots for killing anything, and never ever take any damage. 
---
In short, players that can't handle it if they can't be uber unkillable all the time. 
---
SOMEONE DOWNVOTED YOUR FUCKING POST. WHY ARE PEOPLE DEFENDING THIS GAME STILL?!
---
It makes no difference
---
Don't worry, it's only a bug and it should be fixed within a month.
---
So YOU the personification of the damage nerf???  Ban him!
---
I've had advanced marsupial for a while...I still couldn't dodge shit lol. Do you just sprint while it shoots at you and pray it misses?
---
Nah, it's definitely not because of the TSE nerf. Hell, if anything; I'm happier it got nerfed. Sure, I'd rather everything else get buffed (including enemy hp/scaling/difficulty)
---
I'm not going to bother reading that whole thing. 3 months is infantile for a game of that king. It took *years* for all of the games people compare FO76 to to reach a point where the majority of the community is happy.
---
for me to fix it they need :     
---
free to play     
---
or      
---
offline mode with NPCs    
---
^this, also the photographic opportunities.
---
If I were a game developer I'd want to know why and when people quit my game
---
Wished my wife enjoyed the game as much as I do.
---
Cool that you both play cooperatively.
---
Didn‚Äôt Todd say this was fully playable solo? Surely if you can‚Äôt complete the end game boss solo this is simply untrue. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying TSE should be buffed again but solo players should have some way of dealing massive damage so that they could complete the game solo. Maybe some type of weapon where the ammo is ultra rare. 
---
Nah, I'm donating all my posessions to the discord community I'm in so they can continue to fund the events we do.
---
I plan on trying for a refund and I‚Äôll just rebuy the game if it ever becomes what was marketed.
---
Shit you need to let me get my tinfoil hat before saying these things.
---
I‚Äôm ff14 player lol and 100% agree with u on this
---
i did.
---
I have multiple 4 star weapons, but okay
---
You're whining just as much as they are though. While I agree with your point, execution is poor.
---
There's just as many of these kind of posts as the other ones and I'm not sure which is worse at this point
---
Hmm...I think your friend‚Äôs claim needs verification before you start upsetting your build to fit it.
---
Try comparing damage when at 20% HP normally, and then drink a vodka+25HP, take psychobuff +65HP, and then become Well Fed 25-50HP. Then get down to exactly 20% of the new total and check damage again. If it‚Äôs the same your friend is wrong, and STR all the way.
---
The biggest complaints here aren't even related to TSE nerfs.
---
Please cite for me that the "small steps method" is what Bethedsa intends to do.
---
PS. Please downvote more you petty, petty child.
---
3 months is nothing for a game like this. It might aswell be considered freshly launched. 
---
Red headlamp is now Atom Shop exclusive?  Can someone confirm this?  That's a completely dick move if true.  Not that I care to much, as I ain't giving Bethesda another dollar of my money until they get their shit together and value their customers as much as they value their profit.
---
But man, I don't think I can recall a single game that removed an item from in game after release and made it MTX only.  If this is true it's the perfect example of how Bethesda truly just sees 76 as a MTX machine.  It's the final nail in the coffin, so to speak.
---
Wow, you are just wrong, condescending, and rude. But hey, live how you wanna live. 
---
.....I have multiple 4 star weapons 
---
I don't know if anyone is aware but since the patch bobby pins weigh 0.1 again.  Pretty certain no one has mentioned this and it is brand new information.  Gonna make a super important post about this so keep an eye out for it.
---
Nah, they are just incompetent. Purposely adding bugs would just run off your playerbase. 
---
It's normal to not get things in life.
---
Me, for example.  I don't get how people think the phrase is "suppose to" when it's actually "supposed to."  Your eyes have seen it in writing a thousand times by now.  How did you not pick up on it?
---
Life is a mystery to us all.
---
Yes, but your missing the point clearly.
---
I'm not on about the exploits people choose to use. I'm on about the ones that the game forces on us, which is very clear from the post above yes.
---
Because you added one star to an already 3 star weapon. Stop trolling.
---
Tiiiiiiiiinfoiiiiiiiilllllll
---
The AlIEnS cAuSeD tHe GrEaT wAr, WaKe uP sHeEpLe
---
This. Just because TSE is nerfed to something more reasonable, it doesn't mean that more can't be done to better balance the game out overall. Melee, some weapon and armour degradations, someone posted about how the black powder rifle (i.e. a musket) does more damage than a mini nuke launcher, and so on.
---
Hopefully we'll see more balance changes in the coming weeks and months, and not just nerfs to things we never thought were a problem.
---
No need to re-read, they nerfed for damage balance reasons not for realism.
---
I had just started investing perks into this build. Well, guess I should be happy I only wasted 5 levels of perk points so far, which was a full day of gameplay. Still had fun though?
---
"They've been open about things"
---
They literally hid patch notes from the patch notes AFTER saying they would be completely transparent about patch notes.
---
I hate to bring back an old topic but they lied right out the gate about their special edition because the bags were an inferior product that they didn't plan on being open about, and only when held accountable did they cave. It's nothing to do within the game but it is something attached to the game they were being "open and honest" about.
---
They've lied about the details even! (Four times the graphical details of Fallout 4)
---
I won't play untill they refix infinite loading screen and bulk mats being unusable unless scrapped
---
Right, so they can keep focusing on fixing bugs instead of working on actual updates, because making more work for yourself for little return makes sense. 
---
They help the knife keep proper time.
---
Then don't kill those extra enemies. No one is forcing you to. You admit yourself that you have the option of leaving the immediate area. What matters more to you, spending twice as many bullets or taking an extra minute to walk away?
---
Your situation with enemies suddenly respawning is an exception and not the norm. Bethesda has already patched some situations that were causing it to happen when a new player entered an area you were already clearing. 
---
MOST of this thread is helpful, but please do not make recoil/stagger increase with heavy weapons outside of PA. Its already bad as it is. And please dont make movement slower. In one section of his post, the OP seems to be advocating for a nerf to heavy weapon use outside of power armor, and I'm already struggling. I dont need to be nerfed in recoil and movement speed just because OP wants to make heavy weapons better in power armor. I'm all for things that make heavy weapons more convenient in PA, but *NOT* at the expense of non-PA builds.
---
Thanks for your time.
---
I don't want to onsehot everything, I just want to relax and have fun. This game is a tedious grindfest. I'm glad I hit 100 and completed everything because each patch the game gets more and about THE GRIND!!!!1111!!!!. I don't find that fun and that's why I haven't played this game in weeks. 
---
It's a meme. It means, *Who gives a shit if you are quitting?*
---
I could not agree more
---
You've never played another MMO. Have you?
---
Ps4 and haven't had a problem. I'm lvl 25 w/ 3 ranks in sneak, 7 agility, and one piece of chameleon armor. 
---
My armor weight is pretty bad and I'm missing most of the stealth perks, but as long as I play patient i only have to tuck tail and run rarely.
---
In all fairness that's a balance thing and is the case in most MMOlites. High rate of fire weapons do less damage because you are garantueed lots of hits on target unless you totally suck, while low rate of fire rewards precision
---
Honestly I'd love to use my time to write out a big long post about why Bethesda putting money wayyyy above quality or value or fan/licence respect here was a huge reason why the game turned out so badly but you seem so deadset against any kind of negativity said about the game and it's developers that it'll just be a colossal waste of my time. So you have fun with trying to defend them and this trash game, thankfully it won't matter üòÅ
---
Your complaints accomplish nothing and you aren't helping anyone by flooding this sub with them. Im guessing Bethesda is aware that Reddit is unhappy. I mean, Reddit is USUALLY unhappy.  You're just making people who like the game not come back to the sub. 
---
And blaming Bethesda for their duping 
---
Makes significant difference to players who have inconsistent playtimes.  
---
Where does your loyalty to a game like this come from? Why not just play something else?
---
I get it, some people enjoy the game still. So to them we're all "looking down" on them for enjoying it. What they don't know is that even they could enjoy the game more had bethesda waited longer to release the game. It's a win-win for all of us, but because some people enjoy the current concept of the game, they don't understand it could been made to be way more enjoyable.
---
Guess I should add ‚Äúin my opinion‚Äù to the end of every statement I make in the future. ‚ÄúIn my opinion‚Äù it‚Äôs ok because you have to get up close, you can‚Äôt take on scorchbeasts unless they land and in any pvp scenario where you‚Äôre even a 2 second sprint away from an enemy, they can kill you several times over. It has major drawbacks. Not saying it doesn‚Äôt need a nerf but for me it could do infinite damage and I still wouldn‚Äôt touch it.
---
You forgot to add how quickly your gear breaks in the process. Gotta add that grind to help prevent hitting end game.
---
Hey Lonevaultwanderer why dont you explain why you are not taking your existing customers feelings into consideration? I really enjoyed 76,despite its myriad of bugs and glitches. I accepted it as a work in progress. Played through all quests and events. As a lvl177 my character had the power/weapons/ammo to wander the wasteland searching for.... whatever there was! Now when im attacked by 2 SBs what am I supposed to do...throw my gun at them?? Do you have an inkling as to how many hours of ppls lives you have wasted. Sorry but I can't play 76 anymore as your heavyhanded big brother gestapo attitude...which is why you will not respond to this txt. Because we dont matter to you...just the PvP crowdüò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
" what you've just said was one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul."
---
U still have to wait 20 hours makes no difference 
---
They need to do something to make workshop builds feel more permanent. Why should I invest time and materials into creating my Super Awesome Junkyard Fortress if I'm only going to get to use it for the rest of the session? (And that's leaving aside that "the rest of the session" may be cut short by a crash or a disconnect.)
---
&gt;but why quit? Why not just take a break from the game and check back later.
---
Here's my reasoning - and I hope a lot of other people will read this.
---
This game has been out for enough time for the developers to get control of the situation. The dupe method was out far too long, destroying the economy forever. There's been no new content. They've promised more consistent contact with the community and have failed.
---
**And just to add icing on the cake** They're now **perma banning** anyone who crafts a lot of a single item. The legit people who are doing this to get items to salvage to unlock mods are being banned wrongfully, and being accused of cheating because this was a previous method used by dupers.
---
This shows that the developers have no idea what to do to stop these issues and are just throwing quick band-aids on the issue hoping it heals the gash that the developers have caused.
---
I don‚Äôt know anything but, isn‚Äôt that why we have creation club? Wasn‚Äôt that a way to monetize mods?
---
[Off topic]
---
Sorry if I sound like a conspiracy guy, but it looks like fallout 76 is a rip of all the popular mods that were made for fallout 4.
---
Anyway keep up the good fight.
---
The hero we all need. This man here deserves a medal.
---
For some reason i cant find the same parts and the game ate all my mods out of the stash box. Please help. 
---
Silentkeeper007 xbox live
---
Unfortunately this happens at too many places. EA has recieved massive hate with multiple games, Rockstar North refused to deal with anyone who got a ban because of the faulty system in GTA:V, and now Bethesda is next.
---
All had great lines of games back when they made offline games, but now that they try to join the online club, shit hits the fan hard. 
---
I bet, and I think a lot of you with me, that if FO76 became an offline game without bans and with active modding, people would adore it. The scenery is epic, the game is actually quite challenging (in contrast to FO4) and with active modding enabled you can truely rebuild America the way you like it. Heck, even if it was an offline game with an online side to it (similar to Wildlands), it would do really well.
---
I even loved FO76. I left the vault and right away, my first thought was "okay, now what?", and I want that feeling! I want to feel like a vault dweller leaving and exploring the wasteland as one of the first survivors. I want to be able to either build society, or start a band of raiders to feed on beginning societies. Fearing for a ban, or wondering what bug will be next, is not for me. Some love it, but my character is not one to deal with a reality alternating god. 
---
Lol.
---
Bethesda is so lost..my god
---
Loved it in Fo4 as well, I built all kinds of floating airship settlements.
---
The game is now dead, another PR disaster won't make any difference.
---
If you need to be told who cares why I, among thousands of others, are quitting - You're part of the problem.
---
Yeah, perfectly valid.
---
A little about my mechanic for firing.  I have a Gatling TS, and three max heavy gunner perks and stabilized and one gun army and some other perk that increases damage reduction when firing a HW in PA.
---
I was doing 207 damage per shot before the nerf and 144 after.  So yeah, 63 damage of 207 seems a lot.  But I was rarely ever firing on full auto, since that used stupid amounts of ammo.  I'd fire in short 2-3 shot bursts.  So my effective DPS was a lot lower than it could have been.
---
Trial last night, run into some large bests, simply fire full auto and bring my dps into the range it was under controlled and back up as they approach.  Still no trouble defeating them.
---
So I don't know that my experience is typical.
---
My wife's happy she no longer is dying to her own blast radius from clos-up enemies on her TSE Handmade.  So, there's a slightly visible silver lining there.
---
Legendary Bobby pins!
---
Or booby pins?
---
Like the world needs any more of your morally bankrupt bastard spawn in it either! The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and all that. 
---
this makes me afraid to even play
---
I can't wear the new costume with the underarmor on, this needs to be fixed....
---
Here's what I don't get about these kinds of replies.
---
Your angry at the game. And don't say you aren't, it's in your own words.
---
Yet you played the game until it got to be a grind. You've said you've completed everything. 
---
I don't know how people can play a game for so long, so much, and complain all at the same time.
---
Take a break. Don't eat the whole bar of chocolate at once. 
---
I agree, why did I trust Bethesda? Fo4 was mediocre at best. The only redeeming part was survival, but that wasn't even put in on release.
---
Ho yeah; see you passed by a certain sub of casuals.
---
How long before someone makes a "spiritual successor" of fo76 but actually really good? I'm waiting haha. 
---
I wouldn't even mind if Outerworlds had co-op like Borderlands. I'd leave Bethesda forever and never look back. 
---
I think you‚Äôve misread my comment. The issue is that I can‚Äôt leave an area without killing the extra enemies. The game shouldn‚Äôt give me the option, it should work so that enemies don‚Äôt randomly respawn. 
---
I don‚Äôt think my situation is that much of a exception. 
---
Good tips. One other option is to release higher 'endgame' weapon mods.
---
I really hate the tribalism that's enveloped this game. Its disgusting that any criticism of the game must be peppered with "if you enjoy the game, good for you" and "I know there a are people who enjoy the game..." or else the wrath of the "fo76 is good" tribe will shout you down.
---
Guys, if you enjoy fo76 already then surely you'll welcome criticism of the game as the developer will be able to take the feedback and address the problems. I can point out more flaws in my favourite games than I can with a game I don't like.
---
Now, maybe this game has received an unfair amount of criticism, but that is largely down to the fact Bethesda are a beloved game company. People are rightly upset that the studio that has given them games that they enjoy decided to bring out an unfinished buggy game with many flaws and have asked $60 for it. If it was free to play, or if it was some small indie team developing it then there wouldn't be nearly as much back lash. 
---
bEAthesda
---
Doubt there's any way they have time to change what they're planning / have already built for the vault DLC.
---
Yes. Totally agree with this version.
---
+1
---
Holy shit HZD is such an amazing game. Great choice!
---
If they reset at a set time each vendor would have a line the size of Best Buy on Black Friday five minutes before the reset. 
---
You‚Äôre an awful person.
---
Doubt there is any QA 
---
There are ways to do that, you might want to research them.
---
I usually use cover. Just sprinting doesn‚Äôt usually work. In the Bog there‚Äôs a lot of ditches and player-high tunnels you can drop into when it starts attacking, there‚Äôs trees you can get behind, etc. Side stepping can work but not all the time.
---
I've been patient with all the game not being finished at launch and just shoved out there. Paid extra for the Tri on launch day for it to cut by more than half, okay. I've lived with a disconnect every. damn. time. I take a workshop or more than one nuke lands. Map being empty because no one plays at night I guess. Loot vanishing, dumb camp bugs. You name it, but I'm not terribly interested in being banned for playing. 
---
I'm pissed off that I even have to worry about it just from crafting a fuck ton of bullets when Bethesda, you made every thing a damn bullet  sponge. New low guys, new low. 
---
Dude you really think 5,000 people upvoted a post calling for a change in leadership to what? troll the people who enjoy the game? Get a grip I‚Äôm sure ALOT of people shared the same sentiment. The fact you believe it‚Äôs all a conspiracy shows the stereotypical mindset you have ‚ÄúBethesda didn‚Äôt do anything, those damn duper‚Äôs and trolls tho!!!!‚Äù The fact a post got a lot of upvotes should NOT subtract from the fun anyone feels in a game you clown. 
---
This is a game, dammit! It's not about having FUN!
---
760 hours deep. Until recently I played entirely solo.
---
Levels 1-100 exploring the game
---
Levels 00-250 farming nuked whitesprings non stop, then exp nerfs
---
Levels 250-390 farm stuff, learn everything i can about how the game works
---
Levels 390-424 downloaded chat mod, traded with people for the first time, chat with others
---
" that's a nice place you got there. Hope you don't mind if I make a few adjustments."
---
False. I found the bot last night and he only had a (dirty) spacesuit. :(
---
1) 
---
    PS4, 
---
2) PSN - str8upnobs
---
3) 
---
4) Multiple NEW (to me) issues last night. 
---
A. Bulk repair bug- Must manually unbulk any crafting items to make repairs. 
---
B. Constant Caution Status- For over an hour I was in a constant CAUTION status rendering some of my mutations/buffs useless, and not allowing me to fast travel at times. No matter where I would go I was in CAUTION status. At camp, Watoga (I have completed Mayor for a Day), Train stations etc. Note: Relogging seemed to fix issue.
---
C. Quest to Load Master Holotape in Sam's Terminal- Terminal will not allow me to proceed no matter what I try. Tried relogging to different server, dropping ALL holotapes except for ones tied to missions, killing all enemies in the vicinity. Simply cannot proceed as of now.
---
It wasn't wrong. Some people take things too seriously.
---
Except it's not true, it hasn't happened.
---
Hopefully this is a mistake or oversight, or it turns out the OP did dupe, and not another way the devs are trying to slow down player progression. 
---
Don't Capitalize Every Damn Word In Your Title Post, It Hurts To Read And Also It Takes You Much More Time To Write It, Pressing Shift Every Word
---
Oh no - you're wrong. I'm enjoying Fallout 76 quite a bit even without the boring repetitive tasks that others seem to enjoy!
---
Nothing got lost in translation. I am reading what you literally wrote.
---
Get off Reddit and clean your room so your mom gets off your back.
---
Bethesda is literally burning bridges of the people who are still clinging to this cesspool of a Beta. 
---
The developers took note of the grinding of black desert, but implemented it in a worse way 
---
Hey how about instead of telling him to file the support ticket you just file it yourself since you guys made this mistake and everybody else is already working hard to fix YOUR bugs. 
---
Scrolling past the 10 fucking pixels is what both Bethesda and I are doing.
---
Not complaining, just telling you to stop trolling. It was obvious that op didn‚Äôt mean adding one of the two possible mods to the two possible weapons they can be applied to.
---
Higher level people already have an enormous advantage.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be mean to low levels‚Äù why not it‚Äôs a game. Play it the way that gives you the most joy as long as you aren‚Äôt breaking any rules. 
---
RIP fo76 :( 
---
Which is the most fun guns on the game?!! Is that not a given?? 
---
So yesterday I was only on for an hour to facilitate a trade with somebody. If it does it again today I will definitely submit a ticket.
---
I don't like them but I think it's because I'm a distance fighter.  Bad things have to get way too close for a shotgun to be effective.  I prefer headshot from two buildings over.
---
And it would be filled with assumptions, accusations you can't support and ideas that you can't prove.
---
You'll just add more bullshit out there and fuel others to spread more rumors and negativity.
---
But maybe that's the kind of person you want everyone to see you ask. 
---
I'm not defending them. I'm attacking the nutjobs AND the fanatics. Both sides are wacked. 
---
Same!
---
When you have to rely on a subreddit for help because betheda‚Äôs ability to help customers get unbanned because their game is broken.
---
Great post, sir.  I always ask someone to check my work.  Everything from a simple typo to a totally wrong algorithm can be spotted and you get that "Head slap" moment.
---
I doubt anyone will be upgrading, lol.
---
ITT:  Idiotic narcissists who call all other people that have a different playstyle in this game "Shady/Duper/TOS-breaker".  wtf fallout community...
---
Totally agree.  Or if inspecting the armor showed the different parts on it.  *Anything* to be able to tell them apart.  It's unbelievable that there still isn't a way to do this three months later other than plunking down each frame.
---
Moreover, when you find Power Armor in the wild, the way they assign the standard loot key to "Pick up the armor and permanently store it in my inventory" rather than Transfer is idiotic.  Congratulations, now you have to waste time figuring out which "Power Armor Chassis" is the one you don't actually want.
---
It is insulting to say that anyone who likes this game or thinks Bethesda is trying to make a good game and simply not doing a very good job is sycophantic, or stupid. Just because they‚Äôre doing a bad job doesn‚Äôt mean everyone enjoys these 10 paragraph bitch sessions. It‚Äôs unbelievably negative. Many of us simply don‚Äôt like that much negativity or entitlement or whining in our lives. If we don‚Äôt like a game we stop playing. 
---
Who‚Äôs been banned for this? Crafting stuff then scrapping it is a part of the game at its very core. If that‚Äôs considered cheating, so is sprinting because it‚Äôs faster than walking or using calibrated shocks for the extra weight capacity.
---
Not sure how you can kill anyone in pvp with guns before they charge in unless you are at max range with the low dmg guns do.
---
Scorchbeasts die pretty much instantly when they land as well against melee.
---
Not if it was resetting at a set time each day rather than 20 hours after you used a specific vendor.  That‚Äôs the suggested change. 
---
Watch my newborn while I stand in my camp.
---
What is there to say?  The community manager can't speak for the whole company.  They are relaying concerns to the people who can make things happen.  Todd Howard isn't going to come on Reddit and say "I goofed guys, you're right".  If they were going to respond to something like this, it wouldn't be in a comment reply.
---
It's why I told my friends to wait until next Christmas.
---
Modern bullets either expand or fragment, that's far worse than taking a through and through from a ball.
---
Nee naaa neee naaa.  Grammar police.  Maaa'aaaaaaaaaaaaaam.
---
I just crafted around 400 (which ended up making around 1100 with super duper) stimpacks (diluted). Guess I'll see what happens to me
---
Yeah I mentioned the degradation system.
---
That‚Äôs such a frustrating thing getting those walls to face the way you want them to, I‚Äôve definitely been there as well. I‚Äôm personally never too invested in the camps I build. Like the one in the video, I‚Äôll probably relocate and start from scratch later today. I just love building tons of these, making videos to remember them by, and moving on to the next project. I feel like I always learn a new trick or two from each camp, that I‚Äôll then use in future camps. 
---
At this point, I believe the people posting about this over Bethesda right now. Bethesda doesn't have a reputation worth anything at this point because of what's been going on.
---
Do you know how many people have never even realized those mods are even in the game?? I've taught this multiple +100s
---
Nice shit post syncophant, if the CM was abducted and never seen again nothing would change. CMs are just reddit synths that report back to Pete in his lair, then subsequently dismantle-fucked as soon as our immense displeasure is reported.
---
There ate two sides to every story. There are players that have massive amounts of items. Most of those players are likely dupers. If 9/10 are dupers then I am fine with Beth‚Äôs methodology of banning. If you were wrongfully banned then state your case. If it passes the sniff test then you should be fine.
---
I really only think it is dupers getting banned. I don‚Äôt buy the cases that are being posted where they are innocent players with Mules. Beth has a financial incentive to even keep dupers playing. If Beth band you it is likely legitimate
---
I often wonder if we are all on the same internet. I see one in 10 posts thanking the devs for trying to fix these issues and for the few responses they make on here. I don't recall any of them defending them. This is just another case of if you aren't actively criticizing the game, you are defending it. It really reflects how hard it is for any game dev to satisfy the players. So many of you (us) are over-the-top ridiculous.  
---
Filthy casual, get back to us at 7600 hours
---
The deleting threads, acting like everything is fine, ignoring backlash and putting on a PR Smile is what Pete Hines has been doing for YEARS to people with legitimate concerns and questions.
---
You're only now seeing the true face of Bethesda/Zenimax, they are all like Pete they've just avoided flack because their products were good enough to ignore their pathetic corporate attitudes. Only took a mismanaged online game with a franchise undeserving of this treatment for them to scurry and hide away.
---
Calling you out Pete Hines, you've been silent since release, retweeing other people, no words of your own since this catastrophe you helped build.
---
This. 100% this.
---
Lol that's what I figured. Just wanted to see opinions I guess. I personally viewed it as a current gen game and altho mmo like, it wont really be supported once everyone makes the next gen jump
---
I mean, there are multiple threads on the front page about it. [This one for example](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alko1s/crafted_a_few_gamma_guns_to_learn_mods_got_banned/)
---
I saw the recepies but from what I could tell, they didn't actually seem to save any weight. like it was the exact amount it would have been for the amount that went in- but I could have been misunderstanding it.
---
Still sounded legit though! üòÇ
---
It's not as clumsy or random as a FatMan. It's a more elegant weapon, from a more civilized time.
---
Fuck that‚Äôs a brilliant idea. I‚Äôll start the go fund me page for the billboard
---
This game is not a grind. 
---
I'm with you, I never used a TSE anf only a shitty stalker lever action with a crit buil, but, don't you think it gets a little annoying having to repair sooo much. And is not that I don't have the resources, but still, it just doesn't feel real that a gun break so fast and (without crits) it takes 7 headshots to kill a 68 super mutant warlord. It makes it feel that you are losing more than you gain by killing him :/ just my opinion tho, but yea 100% agree with the nerf to TSE and a little with the White Knight one but I would've preferred to buff a little the vanilla durability so that 60% means more, but since vanilla durability is like 20 shots then +60% makes it 32 shots so is still really low. Maybe if the baseline was 30 shots then +60% would make it 48 shots which is already pretty good and makes it 96 shots at 200% durability which sounds perfectly balanced to me.
---
This game is still in Beta.  We have all elected for early access to help test out bugs.  
---
By using a good gun and shooting at the head, it‚Äôs what I do. If your aim isn‚Äôt that good or your gun has ridiculous recoil, hit the chest. You should be able to kill in two seconds, otherwise it‚Äôs time for an upgrade.
---
It's a bug. There's a new mothman set coming, so all headlamps got kinda fuckered. It'll be fixed
---
Melee got duplicated as hell as well. Diference is people want to use GUNS in a fps. Its obvious most players in a FPS game will rather guns as this type of game is build around it. Just see how boresome is melee in fps games. Now that guns are back tickling players will either go back to melee or just quit.
---
I like this idea as well and did not think of it.   Let RNG make the decision all at once across the board. 
---
Overreacting to the overreacting is the new meta
---
Yeh guess I'll have to do some side questing and exploring. They really should have just scaled the zones to level instead of players
---
&gt; even ~~god~~ Shaggy could not speak truer words
---
I think your funny,  complaining about a weapon and ALL CAPS, then tagging the community manager. 
---
First off of course they destroyed the weapons, there was  1 in 20000 chance of getting a tse and dupers messed that up.
---
Second do you really think anybody including the community manager is going to listen when you are whining like a child? 
---
Exactly. If I 100% the LEGO Star Wars series I don‚Äôt write a novel on reddit about how there‚Äôs nothing to do. I stop playing. 
---
The targeting HUD was the cause of my crashing as well I would crash constantly with it. Now I removed it I hardly crash at all.
---
Oh thanks for sharing it :)
---
I personally played Everquest with some Taiwanese guys many years ago. Good old days... haha
---
Enjoy your fo 76! and also greetings from Korea :)
---
I‚Äôm sorry your build like him got ‚Äúkilled‚Äù but we both know why they did these nerfs, it‚Äôs not for better game play but it is ultimately for when they drop the new PvP, everything they are doing right now is based around the fact they think people are going to ‚Äúlove‚Äù the PvP.  It absolutely infuriating because I didn‚Äôt buy the game for that, I bought it for the fallout experience, the exploration, finding cool new places, a decent story albeit told through holotapes and notes, building my character to my specs and so on. Bethesda is focusing to much on PvP and not enough on what people actual love about Fallout which is the single player experience.  
---
Pharma Farma and selling chems
---
You sneak. You u run for it until the enemy hits its deaggro limit. You don't have to kill everything as long as you get far enough away to unlock fast travel.
---
I can't say if **all** magazines and bobbleheads (didn't have the time to check the one that shown no changes since last patch) have the stacking removed, but the ones that have that edit sure do.
---
You provided a link to the general support forum, not even linking a specific article, and told me to find it on that. I then copy and pasted the exact article you were talking about, which clearly states that if you‚Äôre vac banned from one steam game you‚Äôre NOT vac banned from all valve multiplayer games, like you originally said. You then try to dispute the steam support article, *which you tried to link to,* saying it was incorrect.
---
You have provided literally nothing to support your argument, and a simple google search proves you wrong. And then you berate me for not using facts. Seems a bit like you‚Äôre the one in the wrong here, no?
---
VitoriaRain playing on PS4. I noticed yesterday that I‚Äôm missing several trophies that I should have earned. For example the Reclamation Day one for leaving the vault. I‚Äôm also level 72 and am missing the trophy for getting to level 10. And there are others. How do I go about getting this fixed??
---
You mean synth.
---
I have had a Ps4 for so long and I'm not sure how I'm only just now getting around to playing this game, but I've heard nothing but positive feedback everywhere so I figured i'd give it a go. 
---
I don't know much about the game. Haven't watched any game play and i'm so glad I didn't.
---
Nothing quite like playing a critically acclaimed game for the first time going in blind. 
---
I have a feeling that this game is gonna be up there on my list with Bioshock 1 and Dead Space. Those were games that just blew my mind and I love to replay. 
---
It just shows Bethesda are out of there depth and have no clue what they are doing.
---
They MUST be trying to tank the game so they can forget about it as Todd's getting a head ache.
---
How can a company the size of Bethesda make a game which is a rip from there last game and sixth or seventh in the franchise not have a clue what they are doing with it or what there customers expect?
---
After weeks of CM's posting were passing this along, I've just read in another thread where they asked a guy 1 day ago about what platform the slider issue is on (for trades etc). How the fuck can they NOT know which platform its an issue on if they pay any attention to there customers. And that was after the same CM had commented in other threads a week previous (give or take a day or two) that they would pass the info on about the very same bug!
---
WTF BETHESDA 
---
Cash grab nickle and dime job. I guess well see late next week when the fix come out for the last round of hotbreaks (hotfix seems wrong now).
---
Cant for for this weeks Into the vault, should be today if it is week by week i guess.
---
&gt;If 9/10 are dupers then I am fine with Beth's methodology of banning
---
You literally just said you're okay with that 1 legit player being banned.
---
Considering he is trying to help Bethesda not kill its own game for free. Lol idk why those people downvoted either. I mean he‚Äôs doing it for FREE. People make careers bug testing etc....
---
It is dupers that were banned, they're trying a cover story, as if Bethesda will see it and say..."Hey, we banned this guy for nothing, let's reinstate their account".... It's all noise and bullshit...
---
I think much of the QA stuff is officially run by the Bethesda Softworks part of the company: https://jobs.zenimax.com/locations/view/5
---
Which makes sense - a lot of QA stuff can be done off-site, and it lets QA resources be smoothly moved between projects as some things scale up while others scale down.
---
None of this nonsense helps the community.
---
The worst part of the game is the constant whining about the game.  Or whining about the whining about the game.
---
By far.
---
That red spot on the ground doesn't anywhere near resemble it, but it used to be a dead horse.
---
These big boys hate you pumpkin pickin' rad lickin' mole rat kickin' fellas.
---
Ok, did you not see the shitload of bug/glitches fixed the most recent patch...? The game is not like when it first came out. And its only going to get better with more content on the way.
---
I deleted the game before Christmas. Watched this sub for a couple weeks, saw Bethesda consistently shitting the bed, not going back. Maybe I'll check it out in a year, maybe I won't. But Starfield? TESVI? Not buying them day one. That's how big they fucked up. People are skeptical of ALL of their studios' games now.
---
Had a long vacation period late last year where I got to play the game a lot.  Was on my 3rd character before I got the right build going which as it turned out didn't work anyways and got changed up - lv 1-70 first build, exploring, gathering resources to build stuff to scrap for mods (did a daily radio array/center/sugar grove run), hardly any nukes.  Lv 70-120 was my rebuild and a lot of mindless Whitespring farming before vacation time ended.  Lv 120+ is when I finally started focusing on queen fights and enjoying the endgame, events, etc...  the respec took a lot of grinding unfortunately.
---
And so much time wasted server hopping looking for PA mods mainly calibrated shocks.  Server hopping is such a bad mechanic, glad they finally made most of the plans available but now I have all I really want anyways.  Been playing since beta, but my beta and post-beta characters got dropped since I made various build mistakes - lv 16/36 respectively.
---
Right, there‚Äôs not enough evidence to say if he did or didn‚Äôt cheat. So the most rational thing to do then is decide if cheating in general warrants this extreme of a response. I‚Äôm fine with people getting banned from one online game for cheating. But to ban them from any past titles they own or future titles they could own by the same developer seems disproportionate. 
---
&gt; It was one of the first mods I installed on Fallout 4.
---
[Why don't you install it on Fo76 then?](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/81)
---
That's clever and original.
---
Ahhh, okay.  That's acceptable I suppose.  It would be bad if they took previously cap purchasable items and made them MTX exclusive.  They may as well just add XP potions and purchasable mats at that point and go the way of freemium fuckery.
---
Nah, most of those postings have been up there for months.
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt owe us anything. They created a game. We played the game. And, for 60 dollars, I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre on this sub that means you put a lot of time into the game and got a lot out of it. So we enjoyed the game. Just because it‚Äôs not the vision that was promised and the game changed a bit doesn‚Äôt mean we should have any power to change who is in charge. That‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs job. 
---
Games disappoint us all the time. Peter Molyneux got three cracks at Fable before everyone gave him the collective shrug. BioWare tacked on a bullshit ending to Mass Effect 3 because of rampant community complaints, and they stopped creating Mass Effect games entirely after Andromeda. I have never returned to No Man‚Äôs Sky after the first month or two, same with Sea of Thieves and Destiny 2. I got my time out of all of those games, but I was done. I didn‚Äôt call Rare up or leave posts asking for the heads of dev teams, I just uninstalled and moved on. You can too! 
---
Not only that, but online games change constantly. Sometimes there are nerfs or buffs that don‚Äôt go well. That‚Äôs the nature of online games. It‚Äôs the developers prerogative to change something if they feel it needs to be changed. Yes, they should give us the proper tools to react to such changes, but I‚Äôm certain they‚Äôre learning that. 
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that you are not their boss. Give them the chance to work it out, or leave the game. Don‚Äôt get mad because they have more leeway at work than you do. 
---
I think the problem with most is okay it uses more ammo that's not to bad but it eats a huge chunk of weapon durability and it's not fun spending most of your game time looking for the scrap needed to keep your guns going, especially if you have to use your guns to kill the things in an area to get the scrap to repair your guns. I spend more time scavagincgand trying to avoid using my guns while I scavange to get the thing to repair those guns. If the durability issue was boosted on all guns and heavily on heavy weapons and energy guns I think people would be less mad. But right now I for one have a Gatling laser and it breaks at the 900 round shot of a 1000 round FC and since luck of the draw only chance procs per click and the gatlaser is slow slow to wind up it rarely gets a chance for repair.

if paragon was disappeared by his company, everything is possible Fallout when appearing was planned with the intention of extracting money from its clients through microtransactions, without that the game would disappear so it is doubtful that bethesda let fallout, if you can still get money

Been playing since day 1... Guess it's time to move on. I guess I'll come when vaults open and take a peak? But my expectations are low.

If simeone gives you their xbox copy I'm still blowing shit up 
---
The only difference is if you want to use vendors more than once in the same 20h period.  
---
In fact, if the reset happened during your regular play session you could very easily time things so you go round all vendors  just before reset, wait until they all reset, and then go round all the vendors again immediately. 
---
Pretty sure Power Fist is in unarmed class not melee.

Ur edgy dude

Meh, I guess. I'll spam craft and salvage later this weekend and repost if i get banned lol
---
Sorry is to ask, but is this a compliment or sarcasm.  Its the internet you know. Lol i appreciate the sentiment either way.
---
Autism makes me love the grind. I avoid the crap out of storylines, not because I dislike them, but because there's always something to collect, fix, sell, farm, or build that compels me more. Something to do with creating order out of chaos, I don't know.
---
Most of those postings have been up there for a long time (unfortunately it isn't on the wayback machine, but I remember looking at this site even before the game launched and seeing most of these postings). It's very much the "new talent being brought in" explanation, since Maryland did work on the game but Austin was supposed to be handling all support post-launch, which meant they needed more people.
---
3 months to implement it worse than the mod that did it in every way.
---
My current theory is that they wanted to duplicate the red tactical headlamp code and the edit one to create the mothman headlamp, but the forgot (or forgone) the duplication part. They instead edited the original ID for all the red headlamps and made it craftable/usable only if you have the correct entitlement from the shop
---
But you have yet to perch on top of the broken monorail on the southwestern edge of the cranberry bog

I broke down and got the silver shroud costume so just need voice acting lessons. Lol
---
Seeing as, pre-patch White Knight 2 + Lucky Break 3 made it to where your armor never broke, you can still do the same now, just needing 1 more poit in White Knight.  Most people using both of those perks were using them at max before anyway(which caused your armor to never drop below 75% durability).
---
Yeah, they did this in the Creation Club and I LOVED it so hard.
---
Going in blind was a great choice! Avoid spoilers. Just avoid them. Because you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs a great story, like Bioshock.
---
I‚Äôm complaining that they nerfed all TSE weapons  not just mine. Additionally, the dupers releasing this weapon, is a much smaller issue than those complaining make it out to be. There‚Äôs no reason to punish or make a whole set of weapons useless because of a tiny issue. I didn‚Äôt complain in all caps, I made my point bolded to get to the meat of what I was saying. I‚Äôm not complaining like a child, I provided clear and concise information about why I am taking a break and why the nerf is overkill. I then added to that my opinion that bullet sponges are more detrimental than beneficial and are an extremely artificial attempt to make us grind or whatever more. Maybe we play Fallout for different reason, but I don‚Äôt play to spend over half my ammo on enemies half my level. So excuse me for being a bit annoyed that a game I loved and was enjoying has been reduced to a mess and we are losing more players than we are gaining.

On a magazine 
---
They not stupid bro, they already know the income that can be made from pay to win games. It is not a secret. If they really care about what the customers want then they will make the right choice.
---
It is entitled. The word entitled has just been bastardized by american conservatives. I'm entitled to free speech and a fair trial, just like I'm entitled to having the products I pay for work correctly.
---
I have to agree as much as i want to defend it the game is still far from the glory it could be. Mayhaps it will develop like No mans sky, which i have faithfully played since day one as well,into something greater than its current state. Clearly there is an upper management problem im sure the actual grunts are doing everything they can to salvage but have hands tied by budget cutters and no sayers that are profit hounds. Just my opinion though ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Pick up Monster Hunter World instead. I've logged over 300 hours and it's great both single and multi player. Community is helpful and friendly. The Anniversary event is also going on.
---
Capcom at least cares about their Monster Hunter fans.
---
They released a rushed pile of shit. 
---
I‚Äôve baptized a couple of random wanderers there one time. They followed me on to the edge of the long platform. A drop from there will kill, unless you‚Äôre wearing power armor. They weren‚Äôt. When they got to the edge of the overlook, I left the server. Didn‚Äôt get to see it, but they undoubtedly fell into the abyss. 
---
But where is it?
---
You're comparing Trump to Bethesda?  Really?  That's like saying that Santa is like Hitler because he brought you the Go-Bots when you clearly asked for Transformers.
---
Yeah, same here. 
---
Never got to play 1.0, but heard the stories.
---
So much potential, just like 76, but it was in the wrong hands at the time.
---
While I don't think dropping a Moon/Satellite and unleashing a dragon would help 76, *coughs* I also don't think a change in scenario is likely.
---
Beth is a very different company from SE, and while SE seems to care about retaining customers, Beth just seems to care about cashing them in on them.
---
When purchasing a product, there is a basic expectation it functions as advertised, including being a stable and playable full release. Bethesda has failed to meet this minimum expectation.
---
Additionally, the dupers are partly at fault for abusing the system, but the game was still released with these (massive) oversights. 
---
Even Warframe gave every single soul a few free formas when they did that mass weapon rebalance early last year due to the sheer number of new builds possible.
---
problem is we don't know what red flagged the account. Could have been the amount of wt, could have been mashing the craft button. BETH needs to come out and reassure us that simply mass crafting is not going to get you banned.
---
Problem is a ban, temp or permanent is a game killer. It can take months to get it lifted and the burden of proof is on you. Not sure how you play but I do not record every second of my playtime in order to Prove I am not a cheat.  I have 300+ hrs of game time ... to "prove" i have never cheated at this game I would have to submit 300 hrs of footage which is beyond dumb, and yet it still does not "prove" that other software was not being use to give an unfair advantage. Hell Beth has been so vague about QoL mods that they are in a grey zone technically considered cheats.
---
People are scared cause they know it is nearly impossible to defend yourself once the ban hammer has been used, and with no word from Beth paranoia will run amok for a while. Beth will eventually have to clearly lay out what actually is a ban-i-ble offense.
---
What happens if you simply do not read up on current game news?  Never heard of the dev room and simply trade a 3star drop for a Paint plan?  Is that a ban-able offense.
---
You have 25k cap and just bought 5 weapon plans for guns you have wanted and start crafting them to scrap for mod research. You now craft 40x5 guns with SD that is 260 guns...will this trigger Hal9000?
---
Your only real passion in game is crafting and CAMPs so you play enough to gather junk and scrap it all and buy plans. you trade legendaries for more mats and have a few friends that give you surplus mats. you have ALL 5 characters on the account loaded with extra mats...is this ban-able.
---
Imagine getting off a plane and you are in a foreign country on a planet you have never heard off. You are told only dont break the Law cause in this place all crime is punished by Death. Sadly we will not tell you any of the laws...what do you do...hide in a shack and hope to god having a shack is not a crime.
---
Players in Fo76 are starting to make their shacks as comfortable as possible.
---
I think it happened a while ago.
---
&gt;I'm on PC. I have issue where I went to Poseidon Energy, and then turned on the power. All the monsters inside (scorched humans) aggroed to me as soon as I started combat the 1st time, with the first Scorched. All the inside monsters, in all the rooms, everywhere in Poseidon. They would keep shooting at me, directly into walls, from rooms super far away. 
---
This sound very similar to what people say they are finding difficulty to sneak. As if enemies have much boosted perception. Did they literally shoot walls that were between you and then. Then that could be something else is broken, and not just high perception.
---
&gt;Then I went across the street (river. water street) south to the Junkyard. I could not find all the monsters to kill to capture the junkyard. They did not aggro me, they did not have little quest locators, they were hidden and secret. I spent lots of time trying to catch the junkyard, then going and getting fusion cores and leaving em on the ground, and then doing defense at one of my other workshops. Then I would come back and be unable to find the monsters in the junkyard.
---
That's fairly old bug particularly on that workshop. The enemes might be deep underground or not even present. I don't know if it's an old bug that has been fixed, and now reappeared.
---
"What does 'baffled' mean?  What does 'incompetent' mean?" -- Highlander
---
And even in the previous games, even without a devoted perk path or layout, the Fat Man still had enough base damage to make it worth carrying and firing a shot when you were up against, say, a mirelurk queen or if you saw a bunch of enemies clustered in the distance. In 76, I imagine the base damage has been toned done vs. other weapons to prevent it doing too much damage in PVP, but as a consequence it doesn't really make it that useful to carry. 
---
You pray they ban "griefers"?
---
Give me a break. Both of you should've done what everyone else does. If you feel totally endangered, swap servers.
---
Raiders are part of the game, my guy. You can dislike it or disagree all you want, but it's the truth. People on the internet are assholes and do stupid shit because they can. I'm not defending their behavior but they're also entitled to play the game that way just as much as you are entitled to want to join hands with your friends and sing songs about peace and love
---
Thanks for pointing that out, I've edited my statement to better reflect my meaning
---
Tell that to pubg on xbox. It's been out for over a year and is still a glitchy, buggy mess
---
Same here. I've been playing since launch and haven't experienced a fraction of the bugs other people have. I've always wondered what I am doing that's different--especially since I live in a rural location where my internet connection isn't exactly the greatest. I was actually semi-excited the one time I encountered a spaghetti dog because I could finally see firsthand what everyone was talking about.
---
Your comment history is enlightening.
---
&gt;Did you not know what you were signing up for? Did you expect perfection?
---
Quit acting like what the developers are doing are acceptable by any means. They've blatantly lied to us, and have given us untested bad patches. This game has not improved since launch, it's only gotten worse.
---
Other games get better. Even if it takes time, but Bethesda has had plenty of time and as the creators of arguably one of the best apocalyptic games ever (personal favorite being new vegas) it's unacceptable that we've been sold a $60 pile of used tissue paper.
---
Do you have mutations that boost damage? Did you have Radworms? Radworms currently amplify player statuses I believe both good and bad.
---
Hahahahaha what!?! Oh wow, le sigh 
---
Whitesprings while nuked
---
I support what he is doing but, can help that people are going to hate for no reason
---
Read the post :c I think i made some valid points to make the game improve overall. 
---
And yea sorry, people are complaining lot on this subreddit just because they want to play a more traditional fallout where they want to feel like a god who one-shots everything. The post is not about that, is about legit concerns to help the game :)
---
You've got me hyped. 
---
Cant wait to play my ass off this weekend.
---
I will probably take my time and enjoy. such a beauty of a game. Everything seems so fluid and I love it. 
---
Reminds me of Zelda meets Farcry Primal
---
You have to have really low standards to find this game good.
---
If I ever get around to a heavy weapons character I'll try to remember that. I'm still trying to figure out ammo efficiency for an auto rifle build. Atm the 10mm beats the pipe auto.
---
Confirmation:
---
Burning Mine PvP Zone.
---
There‚Äôs a poster for burning mine in game as well.
---
Complaining on Reddit will not change that, it just makes people who are happy with their purchase stop coming to the sub. 
---
Rage quit / bye Felicia tag, would work just as well. This Subreddit is more like a Facebook page lately. 
---
It's the internet, don't get emotional. Leave if you must, but don't make an announcement about it if you've already made up your mind. It's attention seeking behaviour.
---
it's only my prediction, there is nothing to cite here.
---
P.S. It's not me, who downvoted you...
---
So edgy I cut myself with my own fingernails bro
---
I actually had a post typed up pointing out how he was a nut job.  But crazy don't care.
---
If I brush past a ghoul I am virtually guaranteed Rad Worms, been like that a while though, get 15 - 20 diseases per session sometimes...
---
I disagree 
---
Which part? The car, or the towers/track? I've hopped around quite a bit there, just didn't take any pics, and frankly don't remember the highest bits I got to, but I'm up for a challenge.
---
They. Don't. Care.
---
The game is bad press, and they're going to let it die and fade out before it further damages the brand.
---
Bye Felicia
---
Is anyone REALLY surprised at this point?
---
First it was the paid mods scandal and the $99 horse armor.
---
Then it was the Creation Club pumping out broken, buggy, low-quality content. (Remember the items with terrible animations and such?)
---
Now they've finally created a game that's online-only and doesn't have to compete with free mods that passionate players have made, and they're hitting the gas again and again on trying to pump out cheap cosmetic goods to empty our wallets even further.
---
The last several games they've put out have shown a steadily declining amount of effort on the writing, design, and coding.  They've also shown a very steady or increasing emphasis on monetizing them for after-launch paid content of one sort of another.
---
Look at the big picture, and realizing that finding a way to tie a microtransaction shop to their games is something that they've been trying, and again, and again, for quite a while now.  They could give up on this ambition, or at LEAST show a little respect and class in how they try to get it out there, but at every opportunity they fail to do so.
---
That's no some accident, that's a clear sign of intent.  Recognize that and the truth becomes clear:
---
We'll all miss the kinds of games they used to make, but those games likely aren't going to come back, and they **certainly** aren't going to come back from blindly supporting the current direction of the company.
---
It's time to walk away.  That's the only **effective** way to tell them that we want the old Bethesda back.
---
Bethesda is a joke. They figured out ~10 years ago that their fanbase would sort out their games for them, relied on it too heavily, and now they're not even doing that.
---
another player got a body photo inside the suit it's a dwarf zetan 
---
Great idea, after they stop banning people for building 10-20 guns in a row.
---
Well they‚Äôre getting platinums now.
---
Anyone would notice at this point.
---
I don't need to be told at all. Just leave. I'm not playing anymore either. That doesn't mean I need to make a dramatic karma grab post about it. Bethesda can see how many people are playing their game. They don't need resignation letter from their players.
---
The last tower 
---
&gt;Complaining on Reddit will not change that
---
That's the issue you don't understand. It's not just people being like "wah I want my candy". It's the CUSTOMERS saying your product is shit so here's my feedback. I hope others read this and learn from my mistake.
---
Random magazine spawn, I just gave my only copy  away recently.
---
I was thinking the same thing. They really do mean those posts. They honestly think that you can't compliment the devs and such, because there are game bugs and issues. 
---
You can't really say that you agree with some of the changes. To me, they are more about balancing the game, to keep it challenging. Over being able to one shot anything.
---
Yes, old bugs creeped back in. They are going to address that. To do so, Bethesda has to pay Xbox and PS money because that's how it works. Updates costs money. Hot fixes cost money.
---
Some players clearly want a game where they run around, killing everything and never having to die. This is not that game, and frankly many of us don't want that. 
---
thats no secret, thats the point. Bethesda made a "games as a service" type of game, and then realized "fuck, the diehards, the only people still interested in the game, are racing through the content, we cant monetize that if they complete everything"
---
Like most of magazines in the game - in random places.
---
Until they "balance" that also.
---
More grind seems to be the number one goal.
---
I had that problem, but I had to server hop a little later because of instability and it was back to normal.  I have 3 sneak, escape artist, a chameleon armor piece a stealth armor piece and all the other pieces are shadowed.  Normally, I can move (crouched) across a field and remain hidden as scorch beasts flap overhead and supermutants/scorched/moleminers walk right past me.  With this bug though, I can't even get into hidden inside my own base with no enemies around.
---
Scorchbeasts are not supposed to be the standard for enemy durability. They're supposed to be tough. They're supposed to force you to take the challenge of killing them or attempt to flee. TSE weapons trivializing then was not supposed to be normal. 
---
Your choise...
---
Okay
---
BRAVE
---
Yup :/
---
I guess at least they are consistent, i for one won't be pre ordering or buying any more Bethesda products for myself or my kids, nieces and nephews etc. Got a gaming rig PC in the house and 3 consoles not including the Nintendo stuff laying around.
---
Would have thought the house hold was perfect demographic for Bethesda but they seem determined to put me and everyone else off buying there products ever again and all I ever did was enjoy previous work they had done even if it was a buggy mess. I mean the bar has never been set high with Bethesda games, but enjoyment &gt; bugs but this and the way they treat customers since, nah not going to fly.
---
&gt;it's only my prediction, there is nothing to cite here.
---
Exactly, try not to offer it as fact then.
---
Take that and make sure Bethesda fixes this
---
damn buddy.... 0-0... Post makes me sad.
---
A lot of broken stuff at launch... Players adapted and begrudgingly progress onwards . Each patch something broken had a band-aid put on it only to find out something else was broken with the patch.
---
Fingers crossed that MODS support/Personal servers come out sooner than later.
---
&gt;This game has not improved since launch, it's only gotten worse.
---
As a person who's been playing since launch that is at best an exaggeration or at worst a straight up lie and you know it. 
---
Try running cannibal perk

---
It's not a karma grab post.

The support this thread has received is from everyone else who agrees. You see it in the comments alone.
---
I actually have a level 25 one in my post history, I found it yesterday during breach and clear 3 legendary effects for 1 star
---
because youtuber = bad here
---
Look i convinced Scott to buy the game for him and his wife that was five almost six days ago. Four days straight hes been hit by griefers and hes ready to quit. So dont tell me about peace and love, both he and I served in the military and this is how we keep in touch. Ive know the man 20 years and he has had a pretty patient streak till now. 
---
Thank you for the tag! Collecting all this information.
---
Patience young padawan.
---
So the game has improved? I'm listening...
---
Rad-X was useless before seeing as it suppressed mutations.  Rad-X: Diluted and Radshield have few uses now, outside of high radiation areas other than nuke zones.  PA and Hazmat Suit only for nuke zones.  Besides, you could never stack a high enough amount to take as little as PA/Hazmat Suit due to the hidden resistance of those 2.
---
That seems to be the current state of this board 
---
I'm level 97 and was set upon by two level 80 scorchbeasts at Sunnytop Station just after the last patch. Normally no problem. After 10 minutes of trying to shoot through the nonstop screech storm, the one that was almost dead had swooped away for literally 4 seconds and regained all its health, and I'd barely made a dent in the other. I gave up and server hopped.
---
Hey, I won't lie; I am a new fallout fan. I started playing 76, and it's not what I expected but I do enjoy it. I have one chracter mid 40s, and 1 character close to lvl 6. If you want a friendly face when you play, someone to watch your back on occassion friend me. - I play on PC, nights, and every other weekend. IGN: Kha05. I cannot replace what you lost, but hopefully I can add to your good memories. I hope to see you around.
---
So what you want is all other weopon on pair with the pre nerf tse? They could also justvreplace all enemies with lvl 1 so its even easier.
---
Where do you see melee doing 15k damage????
---
how anyone is playing this trash is beyond me. It's so funny how a rather "simple" F2P game like League of Legends is doing SO much better than this 60‚Ç¨ "AAA" (Jim sterling voice) game. Honestly, your loyalty and passion is wasted. You should go to a game where the devs actually appreacte you. Look at riot games, always active in their forums and the sub, they apologised plenty of time when they messed up either in a video or in a blog post, clear patch notes, clear time lines. I feel sorry for the folks who stuck around this this cash grab.  
---
Gotem üò•üò§üò©üòéüòé
---
Looks like it's old description came.back and is mixing with the new description?
---
And your first instinct to go searching through people's search history is super creepy. 
---
It doubles the base damage, not modded damage. So if your weapon does 80 damage and 100 with a hardened receiver, it will deal 160 damage with two shot and 180 damage with two shot + hardened receiver, instead of the 200 you might expect
---
I've never seen anyone say that once.
---
Unbelievable that people on this sycophant subreddit are finally seeing the light that they have been ripped off and taken advantage of by a company that does NOT GIVE A F about you, just wants your money. Fallout 76 could be an amazing game, I agree with people on here about that but what you don't do as a community when your game is clearly crap and was clearly sold on purpose not finished, not patched correctly or timely compared to other games, develop straight up not listening, is champion said developer and defend said developer. THIS GIVES THEM NO DAMN REASON TO FIX ANYTHING! From a business perspective, why would they fix it if there is so many people willing to take whatever they get and still defend them, still give them money, and etc. Wake up! If the only thing in your life is this community, and the thought of the game going away potentially because of fan backlash scares you and makes you support bad business practices, then you need to do some soul searching. Quit ruining Fallout 76 fallout redditors, because I used to blame Bethesda but I now blame this subreddit.  
---
Aha... Now that you mention it I had Blight when mine went wonky last night too. I'd initially thought it was rad-x as well since I had just finished a sbq event, and checked and it wasn't. Or atleast it wasn't showing in my effects status if it was. Marsupial and Speed Demon weren't working during this time. Not sure about healing factor, as I was full health at the time.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs always been annoying but it‚Äôs super annoying lately. If Radworms could shit screws I‚Äôd never need to farm again. 
---
I‚Äôm still surprised Bethesda hasn‚Äôt replied to this post yet.
---
that website true-achievements or what ever it is shows some tracked numbers....they don't look good :)
---
Dude this game won‚Äôt make it past the summer and that‚Äôs being generous 
---
dont pull that bullshit. they should have released a competent game. not pulled this "it will be done in a few years, then you can enjoy it" bullshit. 
---
Just out of curiosity, what do you need 750 psychobuffs for?
---
I've killed Evan 3 months ago, wasn't he a Ghoul though?
---
Ive never seen a community so defensive of a literall incomplete game. 
---
Never equipped any of those. I just ran enough rounds through my sniper rifle that it‚Äôs actually broken, but the weapons bench tells me ‚Äúthis item doesn‚Äôt need repaired.‚Äù 
---
My TSE Auto Handmade and Hunter‚Äôs The Dragon are both showing about half damaged in inventory but ‚Äúthis item doesn‚Äôt need repaired‚Äù at the weapons bench.
---
But that‚Äôs the whole point of the game - it will evolve over time. 
---
In a year this game won‚Äôt be relevant and there will be too many new games out. This game is done
---
The biggest source of anger/frustration with this patch isn't any of the things they messed up and will hotfix but the working-as-intended TSE nerf.  Regardless of anything else whatever patch nerfed the weapon type employed by 99% of griefers was always going to be the "WoRsT pAtCh EvEr"
---
No, he is a Scorched Wanderer with a pickaxe in some basement
---
Craft five things put down controller and do something else pick controller back up craft five things is what I literally wrote. When did I say you should get off reddit? 
---
That was my experience. I had a few ghouls die a second or two after being hit.
---
I know.  Enforcer for shotguns and Tormentor for rifles.  And throwing sticks at them for Melee.
---
Lol I certainly agree with you there. I leveled to 73. And really dont feel the urge to play anymore
---
Totally wrong. If you want to nerf something that is somewhat op you need no nerf it the right amount. Not 190% Because then you need to nerf the rest of the fuckin game :D 
---
How dare I enjoy a game you don't...
---
In simple terms of performance and game-breaking bugs, yes it has improved. Back at launch I would regularly get disconnected from servers at least once an hour and run into major bugs about every 10 - 15 minutes. Now I can play smoothly for hours on end and rarely run into major bugs. Is Bethesda pushing updates at a rate that makes everyone happy? Maybe not. But I'm not upset with the current state of the game especially looking back on what it was. 
---
This whole rant post was regarding tse and demolition expert. Learn to read.

That's fine however, they should refund the points on a nerfed perk because the player may or may not change their play style because of that nerf.
---
A lot of people are going away from explosives and now have a 5 point perk card they find useless.  This should sound reasonable. 
---
That's why people that call this "RPG" make me laugh. Role play as what? You can't roleplay as anything.
---
Wish people cared this much about actual problems in the world instead of acting like Bethesda owes you there life cause you paid 60$ for a video game you don‚Äôt like first world problems lol 
---
Imagine spending $60 on the game and then 2 weeks later, it's half price
---
Imagine paying for a canvas bag and getting a nylon one... 
---
If they shut it down, it wouldn't be the first time a game was bagged due to performance.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
you dont understand the ammount of negativity? you do realize this is a fallout 76 subreddit right? I'll give you a minute to think that over. 
---
Hey, you should apply to be a developer at Bethesda!  That way you can fix all the problems!  Then we won't have to "wait" on anyone else!
---
What do you really expect them to do though? Freak out? They‚Äôve apologized as much as they can without putting themselves in a spot where they have to give full refunds to people who played hundreds of hours of their game. Sometimes you just take your Ls. They‚Äôve put out hit after hit after hit. If they put out another bad game they‚Äôll lose a lot more fans and a lot more money, but it‚Äôs not as if people should expect that to be the case when they go back to single player. Its really not the end of the world for them. Stakes are higher sure, but that doesn‚Äôt mean the studio dedicated to this should just apologize and give up and lose their jobs. They have to keep trying, and they have to be cheery PR people. Its how business works. If 76 is good in a year Beth can legit still say that all they put out is hits. It‚Äôd be kind of a blatant lie, but I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs the angle they‚Äôd use. You know you‚Äôre a decent game company when you put out a single bad game and people just lose their damn minds.
---
You seem very well spoken and wise beyond this subreddit. There are tidbits in there that every small business owner should have set in their mind.
---
It's a title, so words are supposed to be capitalized. With the exception of articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. So sure, he went overboard with it, but gets an A for effort.
---
Oh god, some chav making us Brits look bad.
---
The game as a whole has not improved. Look at the ratings/reviews - It's only going down.
---
Hell, Look at the amount of streamers playing it / watching it.
---
The game has not improved.
---
I love the game, but I have to agree. They just updated Fallout 4 for multiplayer. They probably needed to build it from the ground up. I mostly just have a problem with power armor glitches, item bag glitches, and duplication glitches (especially the server crashers). The other ones I‚Äôd excuse. I‚Äôm at level 54 and have a blast with every one of my friends that I made on there. Also, Bethesda needs to note that exploits, farming spots, and OP weapons are all parts of the game. They shouldn‚Äôt get rid of them, unless it‚Äôs game breaking (getting to level 50 in 5 minutes)
---
Nut shell version: it was patched onto an older version of the game, so we lost things that had been fixed by previous patches AND  they hit a lot of perks with a heavy nerf hammer including weapon and armor durability/repair cost perks 
---
I just have to say this every time I see it - Bethesda needs to fix doors on the brick building set!
---
How's the new location - is it peaceful enough or do you get mirelurks and other stuff visiting?
---
My sentiments exactly, as a fellow sneak sniper. I did not play any of the previous fallout games, so my learning curve was a bit high on what to expect. This play style let me explore pretty much hassle free when I wanted to, gave me power to bring the pain from a distance when needed. The challenge being not having my cover blown and get over run by mobs with my paper armor. I tend to avoid nuke zones though, as it is fairly difficult without power armor. 
---
But it's truly difficult for others to suggest a build for you without knowing your playstyle. I tend to play the assassin types in most games, and this build was perfect for me. If you do not have a preferred style, I would suggest dabbling with multiple characters until you find one that suits you. I also highly suggest not rushing to "end game". Enjoy the journey, explore the map. Don't worry about leveling.....the levels will come fairly quickly on their own. 
---
Quite rude
---
I agree. So far all we've gotten is dev notes added to patch notes, and a once a week letter about "Coming Soon(!)" apart from CM's occasional posting, (but they're just messengers, not the letter writers).
---
"Dammit Beth, don't just take our money, f*ck us and run. We need to talk."
---
And I totally agree about Twitter. People are getting pissed about a lot of issues, and Beth are just tripping balls in the corner with Barbie.
---
 Bethesda sees us as money dispensers . 
---
Love that last question of yours :-) 
---
Im at lvl112 now. Dunno how many hours. I usually start with round at whitespring just to see if I can get something cool. Then I fast travel to some area where I have yet to explore everything. Try to find some cool location or some random friendly player to hang out with. When it's time to quit I fast travel back to whitespring for one more round of grinding. 
---
My only real problem with this game is the lack of new content. Was hoping for a DLC of some sort, but with all the noise I guess the devs have other issues to handle first.
---
Are you kidding me. 
---
The carry weight in the game is fucking horrible. 
---
This was our only way to fix the crap carrying weight.
---
It's offensive that even though it's optional, they sell that kind of stuff in the store.
---
I've seen this one guy post "my game works fine, but i have a unique network" about 30 / 40 times over the last few weeks...pretty sure they are outsourcing there shilling to countries that have a smaller GDP than Bethesda itself :/
---
I've gone back to wearing modded lvl 20 armor for looting and regular world stuff. 
---
Save the fiber for when I'm actually doing something
---
don't think so, just the first 2
---
You are wrong about the weight.
---
Ffxiv is why I have so much patience. THAT was a terrible release.
---
This one hasn‚Äôt been different than any other early release game in the last 10‚Äôyears.
---
Lol screw you for crafting a bunch of stuff and trying to play our broken ass game. Gg Beth. 
---
Onr single post is not a problem. 14 i give up posts is just annoying and a waste of time. 
---
did I say anything about the enjoyment? you can enjoy a literal pile of garbage. but you cant get pissed when someone tells you its a pile of garbage.
---
I enjoyed the game but I'm just about done at level 135 or so. I need to hack some terminals and read some magazines and I'll be done with the trophies, it's really all I have to do at this point.
---
Yes, they're backward, but you can put a pressure plate inside to momentarily trigger the door and walk out.  In addition to the (obvious) power attachment, there is a hidden attachment at the top of the wall in the middle (above the door) that is a trigger.  If you feed it power, the door opens, so attach the pressure plate to that and run power into the pressure plate and you've got a supermarket door.  If only the laser triggers worked...
---
If they are winningly talking for the scumbags who are intentionally shitting on me because the actual ones are spineless fat little shit bags then yup. They're getting both barrels. And rightly so.
---
No it isn't....
---
Sounds like you got f*cked.
---
What if I told you... That some people really enjoy this game? 
---
Depends on if Sony does what Microsoft does. Xbox is supposedly  going to keep your library compatible going forward like it is now with hundreds of 360 games, Xbox one, Xbox one s and Xbox one x. Sony did PS4 and PS4 pro so they may do the same.
---
Lol I haven't played since red dead came out. Wanted to let things get blown over and ironed out. I came here to see what was happening because I thought about going back in time playing today and looks like I'm not going back for a while.
---
You're right, my opinion is wrong, yours is the only correct one. I'm so sorry.
---
I hope you get it resolved.
---
So wait, Bethesda makes the game less fun by nerfing your perks and build and making the overall more of a grind, and we need to pay more money or earn the right to make the game fun again? You would be any corporations favourite customer
---
Mostly I wander around, explore, actually do the quests in the game, hang out with some friends I made in the game on Discord in an in-game clubhouse we built. 
---
Other than that level a couple alts to try new builds and see the game through more "veteran" eyes, do things differently, etc. 
---
Waiting for Metro Exodus myself. Someone help me til then...
---
Oh no, I paid money to play a game nearly 200 hours. Totally wasted everything!
---
It's a damn game dude. Literally nothing more than a distraction to pass time in your life. Relax
---
I might just have to get back into it. Pretty much haven't touched it since launch month. 
---
I bet Beth execs rue the fact that they let Battlecry take on anything FO related this early.
---
if the game was a competent completed game from the start, I would agree. but it isnt. its fundamentally broken in so many ways, so many features missing, completely broken, or unballanced, all things that should have been fixed before launch. yes games as a service should get new shit. but it should already be solid before that. 
---
No. They need to see this. 
---
Man, I just received it as a gift. Maybe I shouldn't have come here before firing it up.
---
Just out of curiosity, how much are you going to pay?
---
You mistake community for gameplay. Not one of your points touched on gameplay, only what others are doing or saying about the game and honestly if I gave two shits about that, I wouldn't have bought the game to begin with. 
---
it's not that we enjoy it, it's a necessity. otherwise you're running around with crap you find laying on the ground.
---
not even that, just maintaining a high level build takes way too much resources. I'm perpetually low on ballistic fiber.
---
Would agree if it had been free 2 play and they weren't still pushing profit over fixing 
---
He's just a negative little bitch. Read his previous comments in his profile.
---
"Nothing is perfect."
---
There's a big difference between that and consistently making mistake after mistake. The patches aren't actively fixing things so much as taking steps backwards. And it's been enough months in that they should know what they're doing but clearly don't.
---
I stopped playing this and finally decided to give ESO a chance after passing on it for so many years. If you're looking for an online rpg, I can't recommend it enough! I'm playing with my boyfriend now and we're having a blast. 
---
did I say your opinion was wrong? you gotta be fucked in the head to keep making these statements up. 
---
Oh really? Cool! I'll search it up. 
---
I have had a lot of fun playing this game, and look forward to playing it in the future. 
---
It's a single example that has a large amount of supporters behind it, illustrating a rather ignorant standpoint that some members of the community are willing to follow.
---
I agree that a large number of "I give up" posts is problematic and doesn't make for good content but that also paints a picture of a community once again losing members due to the sheer exhaustion of putting up with Bethesda's lackluster performance.
---
thanks for the blog spot bruh.
---
I see both sides, I love the concept, mostly what I'd expect from a fallout title, I like the game in theory. I'm incredibly pissed off at the crashes, the mostly worthless patches, and the ridiculously arrogant approach Bethesda has had in putting out this dumpster fire of a game
---
Get over yourself, this game and bethesda are trash. They are pushing out hot garbage and shoveling it down there fans mouths. This game i knew was going to be buggy but its just plain fucking garbage
---
Your money is most important. You already spent it.  So at this point your choices are to live with it and play game, wait a few months to see if they patch it, or just be an adult and do something else if you don't like it. Self righteous witch hunts on Reddit make the crusaders feel good, but are a huge drag on the community. 
---
Just thought you should know the atom shop devs are a seperate team from the main team. 
---
It'll evolve over time, but the game's been out for a few months now and each patch has steadily nerfed everything without rewarding players nor providing incentives to do what they do. They've fixed a few things which desperately needed it, and that quality of life has been good. But ultimately, they've just made the game worse. 
---
I did enjoy it, and will continue to! Thanks for the encouragement!
---
because you disallow me?
---
After this last patch me and all 3 of my friends that played it all quit.
---
But you don‚Äôt spend points on perks. What people should get 5 points back to so what? Spend it on another perk? You get perks for free. 
---
Good for them. I'm not saying people should not enjoy the game.
---
Hell, I did enjoy it myself. Shit was amazing, especially for what the community did. I looked forward to seeing new posts with stories, or pictures of camps.
---
The discord community I support has done an amazing job with creating events like hide n seek, fight club, treasure hunts, photo contests and more.
---
But all the shit that's going wrong with the game, and only getting worse, has bring myself among many others to an end.
---
I saw a lvl 60-or-so hop around stations apparently to "farm" just these kind of suitcase drops. Had put a load of unsellable plans just before he visited. Went to look after he gone; all plans were now near the vendor in a paper bag. Re-stashed the plans in a blue lunch box, but added the note "DO NOT TOUCH" from the responder at the airpoirt. Made sure my white dot showed on the station in map-view. Just hoping he'd get the memo.
---
Then quit and move on with your life?
---
Wow. They let us use the Super Duper perk then ban us for using it. What a joke. Who is running the BGS Asylum.
---
Whole game is a PR disaster. 
---
Probably not a year.  I've been playing since launch, almost every day (if only to clear out vendors).  I'm a little burned out and due for a break anyway. I'll probably lurk around Reddit and hop back on when there's new content.  
---
Ik it's soooo dumb
---
Mods were just making sure I was okay with sharing my emails with the whole subreddit and I said yes. So should be back now. 
---
Bring on the death threats.
---
Yeah I'm using it and it's well implemented
---
Can you tell me examples of what one side means when they say we deserve ‚ÄúX‚Äù or are entitled to ‚ÄúY‚Äù?
---
It is a Zetan :)
---
The amount of responses here is phenomenal, top community work
---
See the one I really wanted to work, that I bought the plans for, is the keypad door. I really don‚Äôt like the look/ all the clutter that wiring up pressure plates comes with. But hey in the end it‚Äôs a moot point, I‚Äôve gone back to my old door. 
---
Here is the solution:

Just know, even "working" it's not that great.

Blithe comments about the overreacting to the overreacting is the new meta.
---
Happy birthday. Hope they get the problems fixed.
---
you reek of shill
---
I feel like I have been...
---
5 characters all between lv 55 and 100, all themed to a different faction.  
---
Ya. Cool. Then their first DLC can be horse armor.
---
(Not really cool)
---
why would he be a ghoul? 
---
That might be difficult to implement.
---
They nerfed XP but also made leveling up basically a permanent daily quest.  
---
Well I didn't really need to farm to craft my Excavator Suit, just kept playing normally for a while until I found all the springs and screws. And crafting aside, you can find some pretty nice PA pieces as "crap laying on the ground" and some nice weapons too; it's just that you get them more rarely since you meet powerful mobs less often when not specifically looking for them.  
---
But yeah, I get that a good build needs lots if ressources. Especially a non PA one with all the Ballistic Fiber.
---
So we can understand, the hotfix will just include OPs three bullet points or will a full and correct patch (i.e. remerge dev to master) be released and labeled hotfix?
---
Your rationale is the same as when people vote. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm one vote, it doesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù. When everyone thinks that way, no one votes, and Trump wins. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre seeing a dip in the number of unique players signing in, and they‚Äôre worried.
---
Real gamers deserve everything! Far more than you let us receive currently. You need getting rid of... 
---
nice to know you enjoy the taste of bugs
---
This is a survival mmo, this is what those games have, they have a  grind.
---
I'm beginning to think it's a stress test for Bethesda Austin.  One they sure seem to be failing.
---
THATS what my X01 helmet has an atom shop symbol!
---
Wow,  really hope they don‚Äôt make that mistake.
---
I noticed that as well 
---
It is an energy weapon, so therefor by definition, totally worthless in this game, drop or scrap it :-)
---
Communal thanks!
---
Just about to hit 760/7600 hours exploring Appalachia. 
---
I'm taking a break for a bit because I have finally hit my boredom threshold. Various charaters have been built. They have all passed level 100 and are specialised. They've all done all the quests and nuked a SBQ, as well as nuking about everywhere else on the map at one time or another.
---
But I'm just bored and sick of the bugs and issues. Having to restart the app because of an infinite loadscreen or frozen solid. It's never a case of will I get a bluescreen today, it's a case of WHEN will I get one, or even HOW MANY will I get?
---
Fix one bug, make 3 more.
---
I feel like someone high up at Bethesda gave themselves a challenge. How many times can we make the wrong decision in a row before everyone finally throws up their hands in disgust and turns away.
---
Hey Bethesda, are you sure you don't have like an Obsidian mole in there? Making decisions to push away your fan-base so that when Outer Worlds gets released we'll all play that instead.
---
Because the bombs dropped on him
---
why don't you quit?
---
NP thank you for the response.
---
Awesome thanks! 
---
Aww man, you sure told me. I'm sad now.
---
Make it hapn‚Äô capn‚Äô
---
The point exactly ;)
---
This is the blue print dupe glitch.
---
Apparently (can't confirm) but people are being banned and accused of duping, yet this is the same as duping.
---
How can Bethesda tell the difference?
---
It‚Äôs working fine for me. Yeah they keep fucking up things, like bobby pin weight, but overall I‚Äôm happy with the game. Adding the Known tags to plans has improved my experience no end. As for TSEs - don‚Äôt own any, don‚Äôt use any. I play with a level 45 handmade and a level 45 50 cal MG and have killed everything I‚Äôve needed to kill so far. 
---
Looking at the changes to the cost of plan prices I think they though the value was the caps price and what it actually is, is a percent increase from base, because none of the prices match the values entered. 
---
Maybe my sneak is better, because I was in CAUTION but I never got DANGER.  lol
---
Time and money you enjoy wasting is not wasted time or money.
---
I'm ok with the nerf(kinda) but now I think I'm going to change my playstyle because of the nerd and I now have a 5 point card that is useless to me because of that nerf.
---
They should refund the points on nerfed perks. 
---
k
---
My friends and I are all about 220+ hours. It‚Äôs been enjoyable just running in random directions looking for plans, locations, holotapes and events. We just run around and enjoy what happens. I just realized over the weekend there are some large quests likes the Mistress of Mystery that we haven‚Äôt even started. Some times we have entire weekend days slip away from us as we spent 6-8 hours doing nothing relevant. 
---
To be honest that‚Äôs coming to an end, I tried to play this week and was hit with back to back to back infinite loading screens. I‚Äôm going to take a break and come back to when some things are sorted out. 
---
Keep chugging along guys, send my thanks to the team
---
It honestly seems like they're putting more effort into the cash shop than the actual game.
---
Didn't Dead Island also have level scaling like that?  I remember having a lot of fun with high level buddies even though I was using a wooden paddle.
---
Ooh, thanks. Thought it canceled it out.
---
You‚Äôre right, that‚Äôs the other scenario, which if so, heads are rolling right now, and Bethesda is scrambling to staff up to pick up the pieces.
---
Having an opinion is being a paid shill. Go f**k yourself. I am enjoying the content and while you may think you people on reddit make up the majority of the player base you're factually wrong. There can be complaints about all of the issues addressed from patch 5 in various other media outlets that the CMs have been handling for weeks and longer, you just don't know. So when they do something to address these over powered builds snd put them in line with other possible builds it's all of a sudden all up in arms just in this thread. Have you considered the world doesn't revolve around just this thread? Probably not which is why you have to say that the few people who happen to be on this thread who like the changes are paid shills...
---
Weird flex but k
---
You could collect all the information in the world but if you guys aren't taking it in there is no point.
---
Ooo imaginary internet points. I don't even use reddit that much. lmao ok.
---
I did that with my main till I realized...this is not fun anymore.  Started my next 4 characters and stuck to their themes and played the one I felt like each night.  Now there all above level 50 but...hey I can dress like a clown at least...

*Todd Howard bursts through window*

#It's nerf or nothing
---
They can‚Äôt do that in this engine.  Most game engines can‚Äôt do that.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôd like that stuff too, but I‚Äôm not in a hurry, still enjoying my second run through. 
---
Agreed The atom shop was pre planned months ago and is on a set schedule that is more or less automated. They adjusted the prices a lot due to player anger (or to increase sells?) but do not seem willing to alter what they originally planned for content.
---
We are screaming for cool PA paint, raider themed items and weapon skins and it is falling on deaf ears. 
---
FO humor has always been very Dark so if something playful shows up is should have a dark aspect to it. Clown suit with blood stains comes to mind.
---
Instead we get princess beds and Santa outfits packages that cost almost as much as the current game does. (Santa Package was $20, amazon now lists a used copy of fo76 as $27).
---
Beth maybe willing to listen to some things but it is clear they are not listening about Atom store content.
---
60 bucks down the drain, kiddo
---
The vaults are already planned DLC, we just waiting for it to drop...
---
Made me chuckle. Keep up the good work, it's a mostly thankless job during a rough time.
---
Everyone on your team is probably stressed, just be sure to keep your work-life balance in check. Don't be under constant crunch! Happy team makes happy product!
---
Ciao bella
---
Yes crouch to hide. Works with or without chameleon, to varying degrees. 
---
Sneaking in this game is not always effective. Sometimes it works, sometimes I thinks it's bugged. Specially when other players are around is a problem. 
---
The bugs are not evenly distrubuted, I think, though. I've not had many. Apparantly I am the luckiest man on earth and should play the lottery. But I digress...
---
I do some sneaking and use the chameleon armor. I've not tried the mutation, but you would have to forgo armor. I would not recommend that.
---
Thanks for making a post about in game content other than quitting or hating the game!
---
Lol this mook pays for the game and is unimpressed with what he got.
---
So he goes on reddit and calls everyone else fools.
---
This might be the most important post here. BGS faces a rock and a hard place here: the ongoing failure of their internal effort to fix problems to the satisfaction of the community on one hand, and the potential for heavy criticism if they accept the help of unpaid modders.
---
That's why I think it's important for your desire for acknowledgement and dialogue, but not compensation, to be known and clear. Because for the player base, this is a win-win; we get a better game. But BGS needs to know such a move would be supported to even consider it.
---
Are we sure there are no legal limitations to the ways they use your work in theirs? If so this is really just a PR issue, I assume.
---
Thanks for all of your work. The work of modders has been transforming my experience for the better, for over a decade now. I hope it's been a gratifying passion for you as well!
---
Cringe
---
The Vaults have already been created and detailed and on top of that, I dont think Bugthesda even has the tools or knowledge to make anything like Random Generating Dungeons
---
I still enjoy the game if I didn‚Äôt I would quit just like
---
I did cod haven‚Äôt played it sense black ops 2 and no plans to ever go back I have never been happier 
---
Yup, that‚Äôs another launcher they borked up. Repeatedly, after multiple patches where they changed it and were told by players they screwed it up. There was even a patch that said that ‚Äúheavy weapon perks will now apply properly to the M79‚Äù and changed literally NOTHING. I don‚Äôt even know what they *think* they changed.
---
...just how delusional is the op exactly? Solo the queen??? Do you even know that it is those 15k damage melee builds that have been soloing the queen. Not any range weapon builds.
---
Literally no-one asked for demo card nerf.
---
And it's pretty fuking pointless atm to shoot things 4-8 times and the reward is absolute 0. When melee one shots the same target. It's not a problem that melee is now too op. It's a problem of monkey pulling these nerf numbers without testing anything before release.
---
Base value, affected by charisma and perks. Haven't double checked in game to see what it is shown.
---
It's still fun and I bought it understanding online games involve grinding because the developer can't produce an endless flow of new content. There will be times where your options are repeat events, collect materials, upgrade things, and run around killing things or take a break until new content is released.  I also don't expect infinite fun with games.  When it stops being fun, I will pick up another game.  
---
None of the bugs or nerfs have made it unplayable.  Worst I had was getting disconnected during Scorched Earth once.  That was frustrating but jumped servers, found one where the event was still occurring.  
---
I do not feel mistreated by Bethesda.  I gave them $60 and so far they've given me 100+ hours of game play.  Again, I understand it's an online game and the developer will tweak things over time and not all of those tweaks will be in favor of my character build.  I think the only thing that would make me feel that way is when they eventually switch to free for play that as someone who payed for the game I'm not compensated.  But then again I've gotten lots of gameplay, it provided a distraction I really needed this winter, and am pleased with what I got for my money.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between making money and greed. Everyone knows that they‚Äôre there to make money, we‚Äôre not dumb. Greed tho is when you make money through a crash grab, you make short term gains based on manipulation but forgoe long term gains when your customers lose confidence. Bethesda released a buggy game that wasn‚Äôt as advertised, especially the beta part. 
---
They were dishonest with atom store prices, the quality of their merchandise, and some of their fixes were just bandaid fixes that got fucked again, also the hidden nerfs in the first patch.
---
It could happen and has happened. Just no one expects it from Bethesda.
---
Doesn't mean it wont though. Depends on the numbers playing really i guess and Bethesda's priorities.
---
Bump!
---
Same. My fiance an I still play regularly. But our roommate, who we eventually talked into buying and playing with us, hasn't played in weeks. I feel bad for talking him into it. We're about to trickle to a stop ourselves because we can't get any new quests other than daily events and we're bored. The only thing I'm working towards is the mr fuzzy head and my quest to play the games for tickets is broken and will maybe let me do one mini game a day. Regardless, the grind for that item is RIDICULOUS. (About 200 tokens/tickets needed, you get like 4-7 from each game .-.)
---
Anyone who took full advantage of the old acid bulking might...
---
Glol!
---
My carry weight without power armor is like 270 and with perks I tend to carry a lot of guns so I dont really care if one breaks. However I do think they break too fast and most guns could use a buff as they can feel kind of pointless against large swarms of high level enemies. Being able to one shot everything is just bad for multiplayer games though pvp is impossible, it can be hard to get loot if everyone is killing things so fast, there shouldn't be a must use this build. It shouldn't take me 7 shots to kill something with one of the better guns in the game and someone else 1 shot, that gap in power is to big.
---
This  might be the most important post here. BGS faces a rock and a hard  place here: the ongoing failure of their internal effort to fix problems  to the satisfaction of the community on one hand, potential criticism for using the work of unpaid modders on the other.
---
That's  why I think it's important for your desire for acknowledgement and  dialogue, but not compensation, to be known and clear. Because for the  player base, this is a win-win; we get a better game. But BGS needs to  know such a move would be supported to even consider it.
---
Are  we sure there are no legal limitations to the ways they use your work  in theirs? If so this is really just a PR issue, I assume.
---
Thanks  for all of your work. The work of modders has been transforming my  experience for the better, for over a decade now. I hope it's been a  gratifying passion for you as well!
---
At this time I can't recommend but I can say Don't do a Full Auto rifle build as they just Nerfed pretty much all the weapons down to 1/4 - 1/2 of what they were (to the point that you're burning through so much ammo and having to repair so much that it's not even enjoyable).
---
To be honest I would recommend waiting a while to get the game because Bethesda doesn't know what the hell they are doing to the detriment of the game and those who have invested time playing it (like this latest patch nerfing so much and then not even giving players who's spent a ton of level points to build their character the option of doing a respect because Bethesda just pretty much scrapped their build).  Still hoping that Bethesda gets their shit together but at this point they've not given any indication of it.
---
Truthfully with where this game is at it really should still be considered a "Beta" release, so my advise to anyone looking to purchase it is to keep a "wait and see" attitude about it and see if it works out. 
---
It's more surprise than complaining, first few votes were Down, which considering all the demands for fixes surprised me.   
---
TBH downvotes on most non-hate or cheese&amp;whine still surprise me
---
There would not be nearly as much negativity if the game was good, or if they had been competent in trying to fix it. The negativity is justified. Bethesda has been getting away with this crap dor way too long.
---
Addict
---
Okay...  bye then I guess?
---
So when our characters level up, what is it that they get? What do you define that as? Whatever it is, that's what they should refund. 
---
Not me, but general conventions an intelligent wisdom should preclude you from offering up facts when you have none.
---
But, if you want to be an ignorant mouthpiece yelling into the void when you don't know shit, be my guest.  Ignorant and stubborn seems like a poor life choice.
---
Then why are you subscribed to this one? 
---
My playing time dropped off dramatically due to frustration with a variety of glitches and how they bugged my favorite Atom Shop gear.  2 patches later, precisely zero (0) of my pet peeves have been addressed let alone corrected.  It's a shame, game has a lot of promise but the people building it can't see the forest for the trees they are pinned under.
---
I for one will never probably buy a Bethesda game again. 
---
And if I do it will be a second hand copy probably two years after release. 
---
So you didn‚Äôt buy the game? Then what the fuck are you bitching about? Get a life, loser.
---
Next weeks patch to fix last weeks patch is a stretch. 
---
If that breaks more than it fixes ....
---
Maybe Evan is the real progenitor of the scorch virus?

All by his lonely self after the bombs fell, nothing but him and his faithful bat companion. His single, female, bat...
---
Obviously they aren't speaking for everyone, experiences are not universal. But, check the Subreddit. This isn't just some loud discourse, there's a -large- number of unhappy people. Myself included. That can't be denied. 
---
Your not supposed to use mods on online games unless specified you can do yes enjoy the ban 
---
And they probably have a busy schedule.  You don‚Äôt get to dictate this stuff.
---
It was a compliment.
---
You guys ever heard of "Don't shoot the messenger?"
---
Yeah, that's what y'all should be doing right now: don't shoot the messenger (aka the community managers)
---
No love for the grind here, but I do enjoy just playing a game and taking my time exploring and fighting stuff and generally surviving. After a while the levels fell away and the materials hoarded themselves. 
---
first off, don't know why you downvoted me for trying to clarify where you were coming from.
---
second, what do you mean by "bombs dropped on him?"
---
there were plenty of people that were above ground in Appalachia when the bombs fell. Appalachia was not directly impacted. im not understanding the logic.
---
Pathetic.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
nah, id much rather remind you of your own poor life decisions
---
The crafting was done with a grossly overweight character that had thousands of junk on them.  Most players would be long out of junk before they can trigger an alarm.  I just craft 2-3 pieces of chest, arm, leg at a time as I gather materials and scrap them for mods.
---
If they didn't want to accept my appeal, they should have informed me as such. 
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hard to believe at all /:
---
Quite a lot more than one. The game was a critical and public disaster.
---
Yeah, noticed this as well. Would be nice to have functional stealth abilities. We can hope, right?
---
I agree... while they may not be able to help with everything, they've done more to fix the UI than Bethesda has.. Known Plans was one, and with the way Bethesda hosed up the whole perk card system the Perk Card manager is a real Godsend (and after this last patch broke it it was updated and available in less than 24 hours... Wish I could say that for Bethesda pushing hot fixes to issues they break when they patch!)
---
Yeah typing a couple paragraphs here and there really take a toll on the body.
---
This is a very good idea.
---
As random generation is not possible with this engine, I would say, it's already enough, if they just add a dungeon and randomly roll through layouts, which are pre-crafted. If a dungeon has 10-20 layouts, I think this is already better than the same old dungeon over and over again.
---
Yes, this is still not an ideal solution, but at least something, that is possible. Also, in addition to that, you can randomly activate the NPCs in the dungeon, so you never know, where the next enemy hides.
---
Exactly this. 10k bullets of 50 cal or 5mm takes ridiculous amount of hours to gather. And I were always able to use up to 8k ammo on the queen fight... PRE PATCH WITH TSE WEAPONS :D so can you just tell me why you would approve a 190% nerf on range weapons? 
---
It should have been ts stays the same, it's already inaccurate for that matter. If E is combined with ts, make a flag for that in the code and reduce E effect to 25 what it is now. E alone from 100 to 50. These numbers would have nerfed the TSE just right amount but still leave em a viable option.
---
Sucks that console players are stuck with no mods for 76
---
I switched to brick from wood and tin walls after a SB trashed it in savage divide 
---
I‚Äôd like brick roof option 
---
I've heard that many times....   
---
Been a modder for 2 years('ish) now, and I know the Modding culture goes back quite a while, but in my (granted limited in understand and knowledge) opinion it's more a symptom of the cut throat, bleed the bottom line culture.  
---
Everything is made, from Toasters to TV's with less care and focus on the details.  This isn't a "back in my day" thing, literally TV's and Fridges would last decades, and now it's a few years. 
---
The kind of corporate culture spreads like a virus, and makes a quick buck but kills in the long run.  
---
Are we at fault?  
---
I don't think so, we are a symptom if anything, just like the thousands of hobbyist trying to fix the $4000 fridge that broke 3 months after the warranty ended.  
---
Are we making it worse by enabling the bad behavior?  
---
Maybe.
---
Reddit. It's like a full time job lol.
---
Right, but you don't need to agree with the complaining to acknowledge that a lot of people are unhappy. And that's really just it, man. I've personally sunk about three hundred hours into it, myself. 
---
Dude, if you think buying/player computer games is a ‚Äòlife decision‚Äô then you have bigger things to worry about than trying to own people of reddit. 
---
Same for mole rats for me. 
---
How can you be dishonest about an atom price, when it's right there in front of you?
---
I bet your answer is, how can you put something on sale when it first appears in the shop? They never said it was  a sale or reduced. Nope. And stores do it all the time. 
---
It's a lower introductory price. And if you say that's just playing semantics. Welcome to the law. The law is nothing BUT semantics. 
---
And you don't know what greed is. 
---
Why is it ok for a huge AAA title to be sold as a partially finished glitchy and unstable rehash of the old one
---
Anything that would use your [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) account. I have been completely logged out. Unable to use forums as well as anything else on the sites.
---
This is what blows my mind, they definitely have the cash. They have made so much money from Skyrim alone I don‚Äôt get why they haven‚Äôt upgraded their tech or developers 
---
Thank you for the heads up!
---
I bought a plan for the first time now that it was supposed to tell me which ones I already had. Saw all the (Known) plans listed at the top of the vendor list, scrolled down and bought none that didn't have (Known) next to it. Went to read it and the game tells me it's already known. The first plan I ever bought because I thought I wouldn't have to worry about wasting caps on that mistake - and the first one I buy was a lie.
---
Bye Felecia üëã
---
This is a good point
---
Would be nice if they peaked in and started a dialog, they've been tagged many times in the past, but here is to hoping this time the moon howls back. 
---
ha ha ha. If you can't even define it, then how can you even ask for a refund. 
---
Ah yes, ‚ÄúI am a miserable person so I must make everyone else that doesn‚Äôt think the same way I do miserable.‚Äù
---
If you can‚Äôt stand to see other people enjoying a game or be happy, you might want to crawl back under the bridge you came from.  
---
I dont even see the code. All I see is blonde, burnette, redhead.
---
You seem inexperienced in survival games 
---
Ps4. But thank you 
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I spent over 400 rounds of my TSE Handmade to clear out a bunch mole miners that were half my level. Then I can across a level 91 deathclaw and didn‚Äôt put a dent into it. Bullet sponges are the worst.
---
What‚Äôs your point? That you‚Äôre willing to defend a dumpster fire?
---
Tbh I'd rather they fix the bugs and issues with the game before making new atomshop content. 
---
They removed the RP from our G bro
---
Thanks for popping in, but could we open a dialog this time? ;)
---
I've never stated it as a fact, it was just post where I predict what will, in my prediction, happen soon when they introduce P2W elements to AS. And it was you who accused me of beeing child and downvote you, so please, be serious and don't measure another's corn by one's own bushel.
---
They never promised you a traditional fallout game for 76....
---
Ok, if it‚Äôs Level 50 I‚Äôll do 6000 for the whole suit. 
---
Seconded, agreed.
---
This belongs in r/ fallout
---
Yeah true that
---
That would be scary. Unless they implement the "slap" damage for vehicles aswell 
---
So what you're saying is, you're unemployed. You're not only an economic drain, you're a drain on everyone else, too. Quite a little existence you've got there.
---
I would really like to know how you got them so easily. Did you craft and scrap or just scrap ones you found?
---
Yep. Lvl 50
---
760? Those numbers are weak, son! You gotta pump them numbers, pump those numbers good if you wanna get anywhere!
---
Fallout 76 is a hidden gem!!!
---
It will be a proper MMO. Fallout Online.
---
I grind because I want the best weapons and armor the game has to offer. When I'm done, I'll prob just lose interest and give all my stuff away lol.
---
*nod*

Exactly, but atleast we've got some attention this morning, it's a start

You are a god amongst men sir!

Lol Bethesda drops an update that basically nerfs everything then follows it up with wrongly mass banning rip fo76 I had high hopes for you.

Haha, you're totally right, I didn't realize how big of a project that would really be. Small as in small to us lol ;)

Oh, one of them, the ones not intelligent to realise they were lied at throughout Brexit.

Happy birthday, bro! Watch out for them deathclaws!
---
I knew going in it was probably going to be what I enjoyed the most. Settlement building was by far what I got the most mileage out of in FO4, and I especially enjoyed integrating it into my roleplaying, like when I did a Minutemen-only runthrough and would turn certain locations into bases, or Spectacle Island into a supermax prison, to try and create a sense of a military state emerging. Even with the CAMP having a fairly harsh limit, I had fun experimenting with different builds.
---
It's just a shame that for everything beyond my CAMP I felt like I'd done it all in the about month/month and a half I played and feel no desire to go back until we get a content update.
---
Try tagging /u/lonevaultwanderer or /u/ladydevann to see about getting a response to your son's ban.

I hope fast crafting isn't an issue, b/c I don't wait when crafting multiple things, I spam the craft button.
---
Escape artist, you say.. Maybe I should give that a try :) Does it work even when close to the enemy and in plain sight? Then turn around and land another sneak attack? 
---
I quit sleeping this morning too.  I also quit laying in bed.  Needs more karma for being brave!
---
I prefer to think of it as doing god's work. Whoever that is lol. I'm here to restore balance for the underdog.
---
Bethesda can't have that many updates with console games. Xbox and PS don't allow it. 
---
This glitch and the 2 loading screens , a black screen and waiting 15 seconds to move after the map loads. I feel like noone is talking about. Needs to be fixed
---
If you read my write up with sources I did last night, that is exactly what this was, I just can‚Äôt definitively say without being a part of the company, but the evidence is damning.
---
That's for the stockholders to decide. Not the players.
---
There is only three good builds now, and only one I would recommend for new player.
---
Melee is best. Easiest for noobs too.
---
Vats ballistic rifle crit spam is good. Sneak dmg is OP with it, but barely works now.
---
Explosive shotgun is good. Pellets do more thsn listed dmg.
---
The rest suck.

Very few have even acknowledged that there won't be xp glitchers, stacking bobble heads, and several other huge issues that have been discussed to no avail. It's like they see a couple things that effect them personally then blow the entire patch out of proportion. The notes included bugs fixes I'd never even heard of, and they're going unnoticed as if the team isn't focusing on exactly word for word issues that these people with loud voices want. 
---
Those changes to the Nuka Rocketsuit
---
Is that why for some reason it displays my Combat Torso Armor when I put it on?
---
This is not, and it's been said many times here, about who is smarter or better.  
---
We are all human and make mistakes, look at the bloody title of the post, I fat fingered the hell out of it.     
---
This is about a group of people trying to help, that's it.
---
Lol some people need a laugh, mission accomplished.
---
We are on the same brain wave bro
---
Because that's not how a large organization works. 
---
I work with our IT managers pretty closely on some systems oriented problems, I don't have to just put in a service request and wait, I can Skype a manager to get things expedited, but they still need a ticket number so they can track the progress of an issue and have record of it. 
---
In this case they can get a ticket submitted and processed much faster than a random person because they have a direct line of contact with the person working on it, but step 1 is still going to be to submit a ticket.
---
Where does it say he turned when the bombs dropped ? Given that the game takes place some 20 years after the war Evan could‚Äôve turned any time in that period ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

If you really thought that it would be different with any publisher (except CDPR maybe), you must have lived under a rock for the last decade.
---
Publishers aren't your friends and they definitely aren't here to entertain you. They are companies with one single interest: Making money.
---
If you want to change something about that, stop buying broken products instead of whining here on reddit.
---
As if anybody would care, seriously...
---
Let me get this off my chest... any game be it offline or online rarely provides infinite amounts of fun and at some point they get repetitive.  This is not some special occurrence, that's life.  Diminishing returns.  Sure there are the rare games out there you can play over and over and it never gets old but that's not common.  Announcing this happened is like declaring publicly you don't want pizza this weekend because you've already ate it three times this week and expecting people to care.
---
76 is an online game.  Online games do not have an endless stream of new content being released rapid fire.  Nor do they have as much content as an offline game with their initial release.  As a result grinding and PvP is a common mechanism they rely on to fill in those gaps.  If you like grinding or PvP, awesome!  If not, take a break and wait for new content to be released.
---
End game content, never thought of it that way. You have a point. 
---

How has the game improved?
---
I'm eating this shit up. As someone who vocally decried Fo76 pre release and didn't buy it I've been watching the shitshow with glee. I came to this sub about a month ago and made a post asking why people were praising Bethesda for what was so obviously an incomplete game. The responses were incredible: an outpouring of hatred for me (because how could I know the game is bad if I didn't buy it) and defense of dear Bethesda, who were trying their very best to fix the few minor issues the game had. My metaphor that these people had paid $60 for a shit sandwich and were now defending said shit sandwich especially did not go over well. 
---
Seems the tone of this sub has changed a bit in the month I've been gone. If this affected you, do yourself and everyone else a favor: don't buy any more Bethesda stuff. Don't preorder. Wait for the game to come out and get reviewed (no pre release reviews) then decide if it's worth $60. Save your money and your time, say no to shit sandwiches. 
---
All /u/Ladydevann can do is bring it to attention of the development team. What the development team and her and their bosses do with this information isn't up to her. I have no doubt these community managers are doing their job. It seems to be the actual development team not doing their job correctly. Look at all the information we've been giving the community managers and look how the dev team have been doing almost the opposite besides a few QOL changes we've been asking for. Or maybe the higher ups are telling them to focus on other things? After this update will really determine how well the devs are listening to us
---
If you cheat in supermario (go to the minus zone) nintendo still doesn't have the right to ban you from playing zelda. That is crazy. He should be able to cheat all he wants and only risk at most being banned from the online part of that game only. Banning from other games is absurd overreach.
---
Lots of people think not vaccinating their kids is good too, that doesn't mean they are right.
---
Bethesda is not the only game with many many issues, I think it's a symptom of the bleed the bottom line culture effecting so many different industries.  
---
We might be making it worse by enabling, but atleast I know I tried 
---
hopefully they sell the IP back to the originals 
---
I don‚Äôt know you what you mean by ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt really matter. We have no mechanism to backlash besides non-participation. All you can do is quit and come back later. You did the right thing to move on to another game for now.

In smart enough not to delve into such a hot controversy here matey... You just want me banned lol. But yea I'm an exiteer. I believe in independence. We won the vote and that's what votes are for.

Would you rather hear:

"Sorry, we had to delay launch by a few months because we weren't happy with how the game turned out."

"Here's a barely enjoyable game that we rushed to reach the launch date. But hey, we'll release monthly patches to make the game better, so be patient."

I think most ppl have no issue with TSEs being nerfed to the ground. I sure dont. But so many other things went wrong. Past bugs came back. They balanced( nerfed) Whiteknight because ppl were using it to manage gear, which is utterly unsustainable without, because gear breaks way too fast . Thats very detrimental to the game IMO. Ppl that complain about TSE, im sorry but i dont feel emphatic at all, especially if u bought your TSE with real money and/or u duped stuff.

Fallout 76 isn't published by Zenimax.
---
I've been playing it casually since release and I enjoy it. Don't let the flood of negative comments drag you down. I will say that it is far slower than a normal Fallout game, but I find that kind of relaxing. Sometimes I just want to kill ghouls and farm springs for 2 hours. Leave me alone üòÇ

Maybe I should quit this game, it takes more fun away after each patch! I got 12 point on luck, it feels like -12 points!

you are super-triggered there, friend.

It's three months old? What other game got new content in that amount of time? Can you imagine the backlash if they dropped new content without fixing all the bugs? Do you think their delicate servers could handle new content right now?  Maybe if you hadnt googled all the best spots to find this, or the fastest way to do that you wouldn't have ruined your own experience.

Mhh, actually, the known plans mod had the same issue, because it relies on the same framework (basically checking the isLearned condition, which is bugged). Bethesda has to fix this internally

Yeah, I somewhat agree. Disease resistance scales with END though, and I find most people who get diseased play with low END. Also, some last like 15 minutes some last 4+ hrs. Dont waste cures on the ones that pass quickly, and the long ones go to whitesprings.

I mean ya, just saying bye to a great community.  Don't see whats wrong with that.

I noticed the delay the other night but figured it was just lag on my end.  Somewhat glad to see that it wasn't my network.
---
1 more level till final achievement. Then that‚Äôs my plan :).
---
Recently discovered a gem of a game called 20xx, will be devoting my time I that.

My wife doesn‚Äôt play nearly as often as I do, so I‚Äôm in the 110 area, where she just cracked 60. She still surpasses me in damage with her melee/explosives build though...

I wholeheartedly appreciate your dedication to reading opinion posts and providing well-developed responses. I know Reddit is purely an objective site, explicitly created to host cooking recipes and product user manuals, but I couldn't resist. I will endeavor to post only things that align with your world view, according to these new Reddit terms of service, to ensure that I don't violate your safe space in the future.
---
Please accept my humble apology and two middle fingers in recompense.
---
Well obviously the former, but that didn‚Äôt happen. Still, we can ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô all day. Either you‚Äôre enjoying the game as it is at the moment, or you‚Äôre not. 
---
Place all you junk in your stash
---
Also un bulk any junk that may need to be used first.

i don't know i don't remember much about dead island but as far as i know it was made by the same people who made dying light.

I love blowing up cars.

It applies to Fallout 76, all products, and the atom store. 
---
15 HP for limited time... You guys lol.
---
Thanks for your service, and I appreciate you keeping the friendship together. Sorry to hear he's apparently unlucky and such a target, but the venting is misplaced. Raiders aren't doing anything that deserves them to be removed from the game. This is how the game has worked from the beginning.
---
Sorry if you feel responsible for his happiness to be honest this doesn't sound that bad. You died a few times and lost some junk items. So what?
---
Yes, we need a full respec option, and we don't want it to be a store item! We shouldn't have to pay you to fix what you break.
---
I have been there. Any help on what the holotape is called? Just in case I've picked it up without listening to it. After each patch I click into every note and holotape I've ever found just to see if I've missed anything- but maybe you have to listen to them in their entirety? 
---
I have been 1 shot before outside of PvP, only once and it was after i had been PvPing with the guy a few times already, but he hit me a few times with mellee, that only did slap damage, then he got his TSE shotgun and 1 shot me (i was at about 90% health) and i was puzzled that he managed to do it. That was the only time it had happened though and im sure they werr trying to dupe when i encountered them
---
Of course. I understand that /u/Ladydevann is doing her job and from her activity since the recent patch she is doing it damn well. When I said you guys I was talking about the company as a whole, the Cam's are collecting the information but Bethesda is not taking the information in.
---
Carry on, keyboard warriors.
---
And why would they mess with cap stashes? If people are playing and having fun doing that? 
---
i guess thats what im saying though. isnt it their job to have direct connection with us? we‚Äôre literally doing the work for them and explaining how to find problems they shouldve found, then thanking them for listening to us. 
---
im not denying the fact that it may be helpful, just looking at it from further away. 
---
Yeah, i'll let them off for the clipping myself. 
---
You guys are right though, they charge money for it and can't even get that right :/
---
FUUUUTHESDA
---
I could literally fix weapon durability issues in one minute either foedit. I know the exact problem. Why is it taking them four months?
---
I tried it in both Stash and on my character‚Äôs inventory. no dice. will update my original post, sorry and thank you.
---
Play something else dude, im sorry to say. I was hardcore on this game until the last patch, save yourself friend. No amount of fandom is worth this kind of pain, IT TWISTS THE SOULS OF MORTAL MEN
---
Great, maybe you should ask your wife to build your character. She might be used to your constant excuses, "whatabouts", attacks on the education system when you're cornered, and anecdotal evidence from your "friend". She'll probably be kinder to you, too. ;)
---
Two-Shot was never good for sneak rifles. Try bloodied.
---
Better than the old moist pile of trash that is fo76.
---
I see two groups of people here. Group 1: players who love the franchise, want it to be the best it can be, and want to support good game development. Group 2: players who ignore the game's faults, and players who insult BGS/76 just to hate without providing constructive criticism.
---
Group 2 is ignorant at both extremes, and should cancel itself out. We need to downvote and ignore their petty banter.
---
Meanwhile the rest of us should continue both acknowledging the problems we see *while offering what constructive information and criticism we can*, and acknowledging the great potential and experiences in 76 *while being a real community engaged with the game, itself, and each other*.
---
I think one point of 76 was to show us what it'd be like if real people shared the apocalypse. And here we are, trying to make things better one day at a time‚Ä¶
---
See that's the problem with you people. You were told one thing, voted on that, and even though you now know that most of what you told were lies, you still feel that the vote should stick.
---
That's not stupidity, that's madness. Problem is with you Brexit people, you're incapable of reason, clearly, or else you'd realise how bad of an idea it is. You would rather sit back and watch our country implode than accept that you were wrong about Brexit.
---
Stubborn fools, the lot of you. Unfortunately I have to pay the price for your gullibility.
---
I would reinstall for this
---
Never trusting a banned player is stupid. Sometimes there are reasons to trust a banned player. Many banwaves in games have targeted legit players and mass unbannings have occured in games I've played. 
---
Interestingly enough people I know were legit got banned in those banwaves when people who were cheaters I know of got away without punishment. 
---
Mass ban detection tools are never 100% accurate.
---
Right? It's hard enough to get caps in the game, but hey let's make it even harder so people can't get things they are saving for!
---
Agreed, clean the wound, suture it the fuck up and dress it....however a painkiller would be a nice start.  
---
Logic!? You got downvoted for making too much sense man, gonna need you to dial it back. I know you expressed distaste in the store but... then you said a bunch of true stuff about it. Tell you what, I'll upvote you and give this comment even though I will also probably be downvoted.
---
You are not alone my friend. Approaching this game like an mmorpg where you rush to the end, build a perfect set of gear, min /max your perk points is not the way to do it, and would be incredibly frustrating.
---
But taking your time, exploring, working with what legendaries drop for you, and picking up some qol perks are much more enjoyable. Heck was in the 20's before I even made it out of the forest. Now I'm working my way through the other areas and loving it. 
---
Endlessly grinding, using exploits /power leveling /server hopping? No thank you
---
The other day I bought the beds (1 &amp; 2 variant) and they didn't show up in my list of build-able beds.  So I server hopped.  Nuthin'.  I am hoping that they'll just show up today when I login.  
---
Did they ever show up for you?  
---
I'm getting to the point where I'm level 55 or so and I'm just tired of not having or knowing where to get all these plans that I'm missing.  It was novel at first but I'm over it.
---
You don't get how businesses work, do you?  They identify a demand (cash for in game items) and they try to profit on it.  Also businesses don't like it when they're losing out on profit because someone else is making money off of their product.  If no one was demonstrating that they're willing to pay cash to get in game items then they would not pursue that line of revenue because it would likely not be profitable.
---
It's like telemarketing, I hate it but I also hate the gullible idiots who fall for that shit and keep it a viable way to make money.  If they stopped trusting strangers cold calling them, it would cease to be profitable and they would stop doing it.
---
Yeah fair point. I honestly can't see a way out of this mess for them at this point. 
---
Took me five hours yesterday to level from 48 to 49. Spent the same time from 49 to 50 and barely made a dent in progress
---
PLA?
---
Yes, I‚Äôm able to stay in [cautious] state while fighting the queen and get those sneak critical shots (make sure you stay off the ground though, with the marsupial mutation, jump on any fences or hard to reach areas to stay off the queen‚Äôs mobs)
---
No. Is it a private company? Not publicly traded ie. No investors. 
---
I have just as many hours and haven‚Äôt spent a dime on Atoms. Still managed to get the things I wanted. 
---
C a s u a l g a m e r s l o l

TSE are still significantly better than most legendaries despite being massively nerfed. Selling them for less than other legendaries would still be dumb, assuming they were legitimately acquired that‚Äôs a very uncommon and valuable item. 
---
If they are duped, then they likely hold no value to the owner and are just for profit. In that case your point makes sense. 
---
Yeah I've always appreciated the un-official bug fixes on the Nexus for all the Bethesda content over the past 8+ years. Super helpful work, and modders have greatly improved what the official coders wouldn't do themselves. 
---
It sounds insane, but I'd tell you to reach out to the devs via like a LinkedIn or something and connect directly to them with your ideas. I think the CM's only get a narrow avenue to present ideas, and certainly not to pitch an actual codefix vs the avalanche of mundane bug complaints that are sitting in their tickets etc right now. 
---
https://gamestoday.info/pc/fallout/bethesdas-fake-discount-on-the-atomic-store-is-breaking-german-law-other-countries/

So out of my list of things you picked out one thing and we‚Äôre still wrong.
---
That‚Äôs ok tho, I‚Äôm sure Bethesda is grateful to have fans like you
---
Thank you for having the passion to do stuff like this for little to no recognition or reward. 
---
Or let us scrap legendary weapons and with high luck and intelligence, maybe learn scrapped legendary effects. 
---
Then with a boatload of rare mats, let us craft our own 3 star weapons/armour. 
---
It was over 15 times cause the griefer reminded me in a text through xbox live....i stop counting well after that. Look banning maynot been choice words but it was frustration after all but i will keep a look out for other players. I kind of feel like thats my role besides being a part time vendor making guns and armor for players coming out of the vault. The damage was done and i pulled in a few favors and repaired everything but its just principal after someone has to look out for lower level players. Just figured i was raised better share the kindness to players who need it cause griefers tend to ruin the game.

It's promoting a site you're using for your work.  Whether you're making any MONEY off it, though...  Prolly don't want a BIG GLARING INDICATOR of the ongoing issues.  Keep up the work!
---
Except no one would have got their canvas bag, had there not been complaining...
---
There is no support for Bethesda left here. *Stop changing the truth*. The front page is nothing but "I quit" there as been no posivity these recent days, stop acting like anyone here defend this game or prevent you from critisizing it.
---
After the version we got in 4 and now 76 I could never go back to the old one. It felt like armor and not POWER ARMOR like maybe try the heavy combat w and add stealth mods 
---
Fallout: Minecraft Edition. 
---
This game doesn‚Äôt excel at anything besides epic fails.

Finally some sanity in this sub. People are way overreacting.

lol Starfield

Get off that hype train, its just going to go the same way.

A vote is a vote. That's the fucking point! We won it! You can't accept the result and want another and another! It'll never end. And don't go! I don't hate you lol.

The multiplayer is all the issues. It is what's causing most of these bugs for what I've heard and read. And yea a friend told me the game was good and well yea. We know its not great now.

The moisture is from sleet in the gutter this trash is laying in.... its cold af.
---
Just go and see for yourself. It is not perfect but I have enjoyed it. Build for a two handed weapon and max strength. This will help you get the most enjoyable experience. You won‚Äôt have weight issues due to needing ammo and you will have more carry capacity due to high strength. Yea flying enemies will be annoying but that is end game not anywhere near where you are now. Also as a side note i am at the end end end game and it is still not really a big deal. Those jerks gotta land eventually. 
---
The fanboys don't want anyone spoiling their circle jerk.  Its true for every video game, this one is no exception.  The Fallout franchise died when Bethesda forced out the original Fallout development team.
---
maybe to expand the game, since final content does not have 
---
Just to chyme in here - I'm guessing their user agreements are similar to Blizzards. You're never buying a game, even if you buy a physical copy. You're buying a disk, and access to a game. 
---
If you break their rules, you lose that access, you're free to still throw the disk like a frisbee though. 
---
Now, the caveat is, at least for Blizzard, there is a clause in their EULA, that essentially says "We can ban you if we feel like it, for any reason."  It isn't often invoked, because it is bad publicity, but it also means you've got zero legal recourse. You paid for access to a game, you agreed to follow the rules, you broke the rules, you lose access. 
---
To make an analogy: You pay cover to get into a bar, you slap your server on the butt, you get kicked out of the bar - they have no obligation to give you your cover back. 
---
Only mod I have is the ultrawide interface fix. I did a scan/repair of the game last night as a last ditch, but it didn't work.
---
Thank you for posting this because I've come to the conclusion that the community who defends the game are more toxic than those who give negative feedback about it. I'm so tired of posts like, "if you don't enjoy the game then stop playing". How is that helping the game we WANT to improve so we can enjoy?
---
I do enjoy this game, but it gets to a point every night where I get so annoyed that I log off, not from anything challenging but from petty shit. Bugs, messy interface, trade system that sucks, the talent system sucks, the areas feel unrewarding, weapons breaking fast as if ammunition wasn't scarce enough, I stopped having high expectations every time I visit a new area, I need to be 20 lvls higher to use a weapon so I might as well scrap it otherwise its just an extra weight, no dialog options, even inviting a friend to group is a pain in the ass. We were also promised a Fallout game, not a survival game with a Fallout skin slapped on it so you can include false advertising on the list of shit to complain about too.
---
The truth is that the minority are the ones that defend the game. They complain about "toxic YouTube play-throughs" but end up being more toxic to those who want to actually want the game to improve. I play it every night, I do have fun but I also get very easily irritated. If anybody has nothing to complain about the game, they're lying.
---
You can‚Äôt trust every report to be 100% right, you aren‚Äôt on their side to see how many reports that have little information get sent in or not. It‚Äôs possible yours are getting lost in the auto-response machine instead of actually being peer-reviewed by a human at this point and since they already have a lot on their plate. You‚Äôre acting like you have a pre-established 1 on 1 dialogue with Bethesda and they spat in your face but in actuality it‚Äôs a very indirect dialogue full of potential miscommunication. 
---
You summed up my experience to a T. I played about 80 hours before logging off for the last time. I was basically in an endless loop of selling things to vendors and farming legendaries, but I was making no progress in kitting our my character so I just stopped. 
---
All of your examples have been things I've said too so you're making it seem like if you say something positive you're probably a shill. 
---
No, you didn't say everyone
---
I am super triggered. Because the "community" likes one opinion but if you have a different one then you're labeled as a "probable shill" 
---
of course. you lock it, stick around, wait for someone to pick the lock, they become wanted and then you kill em for caps.
---
I want to avoid spoilers - is it possible to give me a slightly stronger hint without spoilering? 
---
No offense, but hanging out just to shit on a game you don't own is pretty weird. 
---
So "True Fans" are the silent sufferers, possibly like a beaten spouse lying in the ditch of life.
---
Only 3% of players have 20 pvp kills. 
---
DO NOT WANT
---
First off, I hope they remove the wrongful duping ban.
---
Secondly, there's a weight limit in the game for good reasons (both in terms of gameplay and performance). Using multiple accounts may be common, but that doesn't make using them to circumvent intentional restrictions of the game right. As a player who has put time and thought into determining which items I can keep and which I must ditch, even knowing it might (and did) cost my character later, I don't pity you or anyone else whose violation of the spirit of the game results in consequences.
---
No hostility intended, but that's my 2¬¢.
---
Ill say it again they can complain and talk about whatever, just don't repeat the same subject repeatedly for 2 days
---
Yes, if someone bases up near a random event spawn point no events will spawn at that point until the base leaves and the area cycles.
---
Lol...
---
&gt;stop calling those that are pointing out flaws with this game "not true fans"
---
Yeah, those weird gatekeepers on who's a "true fan" and who isn't always make me lol. Like, ok, sure, Jan.
---
Can you quote the bit where the person said that? I'm finding it hard to see where he said "True Fans" haven't complained
---
Lighten up Francis.
---
I automatically assumed all the compliments and praise were Bethesda shills on alt accounts, but I guess I'm just super cynical 
---
Already found this out

take it as a gift from Bethesda, you don't have to play their shits anymore and if u want to play Skyrim or something just pirate it ;D
---
Ok is Bethesda a private company?
---
It should be a 3 star perk card then that scales from 20 to 40 to 60. 
---
1 or 2 spots stop it from spawning yes :/
---
/tiphat Bethesda
---
Now this is a good suggestion for this game.
---
I've read a guy say something like "We have another community for this game to avoid you whiners, but we won't tell you where or you would ruin that too"
---
It's kind of sad that there are people that go so far to defend a company that they make ANOTHER "secret" community, separated from both the series and game communities, just to avoid any of the criticism that actually aims to make the game better
---
Remember these reddit threads are basically a tempest in a teacup. You do NOT speak for the vast majority of the community because the vast majority of the community does not use any of these sites to talk about the game at all. 
---
From what I can see most of their fixes have been pretty good and this most recent patch had a merge problem which they have already acknowledged and they are going to put out a hotfix for it and try to figure out what happened. I have had weird merge problems happen before in my own code also and despite automated tests weird things have still happened a few times.
---
They do have serious problems to fix like weapon and armor durability and weapon balancing. Two shot and Explosive both needed to be nerfed hard because they were objectively better than basically every other legendary effect.  That was just a broken design and should never have been allowed. The effects should have been designed around a baseline xx% damage improvement and that xx% can be higher the more situation the effect is.
---
It is tiring to see people say that they have played the game for hundreds of hours and that they hate it now and the game sucks and nobody should enjoy it. If you have played the game for hundreds of hours than your cost per hour is lower than pretty much any form of entertainment and vastly exceeds all but a few games in any given year.
---
What I see are serious problems that need to be addressed while a group of people that enjoy a hate train love to just yell and scream and pitch a fit.
---
Why has no one ever welded a few Mr handys together with a motor cycle seat. That's how I'd traverse the Wasteland!
---
Alright show us on the doll exactly where uncle todd touched you
---
Hey thanks so much. I ended up getting it last night from wolfpack (he commented above). But ty for offering to help!
---
Now repeat that without your lip quivering.
---
No offense, but your opinion is worth even less to me than this heaping shitpile of a game is. Have a good one bud. 
---
What? We are not all just gonna bully the shit out of them all of a sudden are we?
---
I'm defending the game because I actually like to explore shit and take my time with things other than those players who smash the fuck out of it and complete it in a week.
---
They have fixed a butt load of bugs now. Sure they should have been fixed from the start, but at least they didn't leave it. 
---
Story-wise, again should have been there from the start, but what they did say was that it was a totally new experience for them. In all fairness I would rather worry about gameplay than innovative story. I would rather not phase through a fucking wall than listen to some random robot chatting shit for hours and then asking you to make a decision.
---
I would have liked to have NPC humans in the game, but seeing as the game is multiplayer and 4 times bigger than Fo4s map, this would have caused quite a lot more crashes and stability issue with the game.
---
Okay, we know you liked your TSE but this is a bit much...
---
Yes, it could still work but just might be a bit harder. You‚Äôd have to stand/crouch a few times while backing away from the enemies until you get back into [cautious]. 
---
Yes- if you zoom in close enough to the helmet in photo mode the glass on his helmet bcomes clear and you can see the head- it's Zetan.

Well, yes it is. But you might want to check out the one that is actually good...
---
r/MurderedByWords
---
Yes. No. Maybe... I don't know. Could you repeat the question?
---
yeah this sub has turned into people denying how bad the game. its like bethesda are feeding them actual shit and they keep talking about how good it tastes.  Bethesda deserved all the back lash they got. 
---
Nope. There's hell to pay. And you're all paying it! 
---
This made me lol, thanks.
---
Just because you enjoy the game doesn‚Äôt negate the glaring issues that are truly there. It would be quite the gate keeping move to tell people not to voice their opinions on a game they bought. it‚Äôs funny because the disconnect between this sub is that the overwhelmingly high number of opinions are negative. If they were positive nobody would be posting about how people are talking about this game.  Don‚Äôt blame the people talking about the game. It‚Äôs the creators giving them something to talk about whether it be good or bad.
---
Yes and if your camp is there expect it to be destroyed
---
I feel like I'm getting r/whoosh right now
---
Found it in the patch notes from January 10th...
---
"**Repairing**: Component quantities required to repair mid to high level armor and weapons have been reduced up to 20%. ***DevNote***: - Repair costs scale with level, and there's room to reduce costs at higher levels."
---
Vendors will probably have storage limit and cap limit. Then they will be nerfed.
---
Every event in the game has had its XP scaled down and a longer period of time before it can be repeated. Just sayin...
---
No. There are high level monsters in high level areas. That's how they control progression. It makes sense. Does a character become weak around noobs? That doesn't make any sense on any timeline. 
---
They don't listen, they just pass some stuff on to the dev's...apparently.
---
Pretty sure he just bins them and goes back to playing pong.
---
So.....you like the game? 
---
Only in that the way you pay for games is sketchy these days. Why do you think all games are sold through always online launchers? You're not buying a game - you're buying ACCESS to a game, even if it comes with a disk. They can, according to most EULAs ban you for whatever reason they want. You're free to keep your disk though. 
---
Wait how did you take no damage? Dense + fireproof 3? This is hilarious 
---
Not playing a game you like means losing faith in a dev thus letting your friends know not to buy from that company which in turn can make companies go bankrupt. Thus it's better for the company to deliver on the product they promised
---
or close the  store for a time , and fix the game first 
---
100 caps for my shotgun that has a base damage of 300, I dont think that's worth it
---
I made it into the 80s and haven't logged back on in over a week now, games just so damn boring but here I am still hoping to see some kind of good news, but nope
---
Yup
---
You posted on shower thoughts you are pervert nudist griefer!!! /s
---
Sure looks like it.The game is toast .
---
Since the patch, VATS maintains target on last limb called.  I have been using that to my advantage with a hardened 10mm and a headshot crit gunslinger build.  
---
I continue to kill everything from rad scorpions to mirelirks, to supermutants.  I‚Äôm level 56 currently on this alt, so the build is highly viable.
---
Item decay, across weapons/armor is a palpable change still on all characters.  I think the change was an unexpected negative but still does not feel out of balance or that it is not maintainable. 
---
Hit high spawn locations (Whitesprings clubhouse, West-Tek, cabins at the top of the world). If you can, team with someone who can share a 3 point inspirational perk (unless you have it, then simply team with someone and give them the XP love). 
---
Seriously, this is exhausting. Needing validation is fine, but this is thinly veiled "stop liking things I don't like" 
---
see what I mean? You competely missed the point. You just parrot a vote is a vote and Brexit means Brexit without having a fucking clue what Brexit actually means. Does it mean an extra 350 million to the NHS as people voted for? NOPE Does it mean a hard border that some idiots voted for? NOPE
---
Allow me to just emphasise the following sentence in the hopes that it will find it's way into your mind.
---
 *_YOU ARE NOT GETTING WHAT YOU VOTED FOR_*

Do you understand?

Demolition expert should be 3 levels now. 20/40/60. Having it at 5 levels is absurd for how impactful it is now.
---
It‚Äôs not but every server I go to someone is set up by the pond 
---
After going on a brief rant about "anti FO76" haters and YouTubers he then goes on to say that those who made posts here trying to support the devs were the "True Fans"
---
You seem like a pretty toxic person. Downvoted.
---
Tile roofs would be AWESOME!
---
No; not really. That's an excuse. Media matters and shareblue were and are real organizations. Paid shilling and advertising along with corporate warfare is absolutely something companies engage in. There is no conspiracy it's verifiable fact
---
It‚Äôs so annoying everyone sets up right on that pond 
---
Sounds like a rant and a butt hurt fan boy post 
---
Explosive does extra dmg for shotguns.
---
Lol, the downvote brigade is in full swing. 
---
Yeah, that happened to me while I was using my AA explosive gatling. 
---
My TSE rifle build is still fine, no I don't one shot everything anymore. But it's still very much a good build. And an added bonous, I no longer have the fear of firing my gun to close to me and killing myself.
---
I fell in love with my bloodied explosive lever before this balance...well turned out more a nerf...and I love it even more now. I also have been using anti-armor explosive. I switched my demolition perk and put them all into higher ranks of rifleman now which grants more damage than the demolition did maxed. My armor is a mixture of chameleon, bolstering, vanguard, and regenerating. Trying to replace a few Chameleon pieces but for tired of posting again and again on reddit for trades with the extra really good pieces on here so I sold them to bots (after I hooked a buddy up with some fall damage reduction) and figure I'll just play to find others. Pretty much I use sneak multiplier when I can and flip to whatever to put out damage when I'm found out. 
---
I have a bloodied explosive black powder rifle I found a while back - that still hits like a truck. I also just found an anti-armor explosive with vats fill black powder rifle (easily best roll I've ever picked up) last night during son of Dane mission. That hits hard as well. The vats fill could have been reload speed but you know it's still a 1/1M roll so I'll take it. 
---
Why the downvotes? True statement.
---
Yes, we all noticed a ton of things that are "re broken" from this weeks patch.   All sorts of things are broken that were either fixed, or not broken in the first place.   I saw the healing thing, as well as the bulk junk issue, as well as plenty of other things that aren't behaving like they were just a few days ago
---
Another one of those posts. Where someone bitches about others quitting. Just ignore the post and move on. Why is it such a big deal that you make a post about it?
---
Next big game is an Atom style store with no game, just the promise of one soon?
---
It is possible to enjoy this game and not be a paid for sycophant. Opinions are tricky like that. 
---
Terra-cotta like the ones on base in key west FLA.

Heavy AF for hurricanes unsure of SB üò≥

I killed a Scorchbeast Queen and got.......... Scorchbeast meat.. That's all

Good job.
---
Also Fallout:Miami mod on the horizon.
---
I‚Äôm level 256 and this sounds similar to how I‚Äôve spent my 300+ hours. I still enjoy the game but think I‚Äôm gonna go back and finish NV while things improve for 76. I still have hope that it‚Äôll become a great game, but the devs really need to step it up and hot-fix quicker on game breaking issues while regularly releasing new content.

these work for the pistol, but not the SMG.

you should really pick one or the other to specialize in.
---
Seems legit. If I used guns, i would be trying to scoop one up from the apparently hundreds of people ragequitting. 
---
They often do. Some of the most skilled ones on Nexus for Fallout 4 - Fo76 is basically Fo4 with scripting add-ons and what appears to also be borrowed code from Skyrim SE for the Scorchbeasts -  can create new assets and upload them. And the modding teams for the previous Bethesda games pretty much closed out any bug that's within their capacity to fix without access to the source code or redoing the engine.
---
I hope some of those folks got hired on. They immensely improved the PC versions of those games.  
---
I searched this thread and couldn‚Äôt even find comments with concrete problems they wished were fixed. I play the game and had to switch from a TSE to instigating and an AA. I am not experiencing any gameplay issues but I see all these posts that things are terrible. 
---
(In fact, I might be labeled a Bethesda sympathizer for admitting this, but I went from a couple of blue-screens per day to none since the patch and I have no idea why.)
---
They actually made a similar concept for mama murphys chair from fo4. She was originally meant to be in a hovering mr handy with a seat in the face of it lmao. Now all we have left of that cool concept is making her her own special old lady chair.
---
You may need to learn the previous mods before shielded will show up, it was like that prepatch
---
I'm so proud of what they're doing for us. It's truly heroic 
---
This game is a *joke*
---
Well I've bug reported this and a moderator here has said they are "aware" for months now. 
---
Only if we can get a "Has Radworms" tag for the people who keep getting rattled by it.
---
Oh this is such a dangerous precedent to set. Dissent and civil discourse provides the best solutions in all situations. We need to have people willing to have a conversation and disagree on both sides and this undermines that.  
---
I understand that to those who want the game to improve / want Bethesda to put out an exemplary product, this can feel like someone is undermining their agenda, but I think it makes your case stronger to have people in the community that oppose your point of view. It provides the opportunity for a fair and balanced discussion on the situation with multiple perspectives, as opposed to the Reddit community just whipping out their pitchforks in unison.
---
Discourse is okay guys... Now downvote me. :( 
---
It's not brave to declare retirement and give a 5 paragraph essay talking crap on the game before they do.
---
An unmarked grave?  No his body should be stuffed into a porta potty adjacent to a chili eating content at a county fair because after 100+ hours of gameplay I want to stop playing and switch to another game.  That has never happened before I played this abomination of a game. /s
---
Yeah, he made that up. Nowhere in that long rant did the user say that. He's strawmanning
---
I appreciate your thread, mate.  Last night I bought a handmade plan, and I expected to just start making and scrapping them to build up a nice one for myself from learned mods.  
---
Now, I'm going to do maybe one or two a day, you know SO THE DUPE POLICE DON'T COME SWOOPING IN ON ME.
---
They had a cool but buggy game. All they had to do was fix the bugs and leave everything the way it was. But what happened is what always happens: players bitch and then the devs start changing things. Stash limit, pvp, this and that. Like the White Knight and Power Parcher perks. Having White Knight being different gave a slight edge to people that don't want to use PA. Imagine if we didn't get to respec SPECIAL and didn't continue to get new perk cards after level 50. How different would the playing field be? I used to play Star Wars Galaxies when it was cool. Then they changed it, made it 'easier' so younger people can play. They 'dumbed' it down. I wonder how many people will have to stop playing Fallout 76 until the servers shut down for good.
---
Look as far i can say is: he has an TBI/PTSD with insomnia. I help him cope, not obligation just pure friendship. 
---
Personally im most bummed about the new weight limit... any news on private lobbys or servers or singleplayer? F4 was released bugged like f76... so i dont get the hold off on them.
---
Also i think that players that loved to hoard junk back to home where already punished hard enough when the glitch was fixed, slow walk incredibly fast depleting ap.. no fast teleport to camp? That was already punishing enough while we just want to play the game our way.. well lets say i uninstalled the game cause atleast you could give us our well deserved kill loot and aid items but no you like intentionally blackmail the entire account by witholding every reward. I diddnt cheat this game i played fairly to get all those items and now you basically ask me to drop all my junk while i need most to build a stupid base camp and for furniture...  (half of time i cant even repair weapons or my armor cause i still miss items!!!)
---
Its like a big smack in my face..
---
Some people might not agree with me but hey you play your own way too. What if they ‚Äúbanned‚Äù yourp play style? Think about that before sending crybaby comments...
---
Im just trying to openly lay out my feelings here.. im as much as a fan as you only my fun got destroyed in a short matter of time and i payd hard earned money for it as much as you did... so yes it saddens and hurts me deeply.
---
I really hope that i can return soon.. cause i feel like this limit was just another way of forcing everyone onto the survival mode.. fallout isnt all about survival nor is everyone experienced enough for that or can handle that harder play style... 
---
Oh and why i dont think this limit schould be a thing at all? Well i played generally 4 to 6 hours a day on patch 4 till patch 5. Wanna know how much disconnects i only had? 4... so you cant tell me this fixes much... and i bet nuke zones still crash too :) and that has nothing to do with hoarders!!!!
---
Maybe I should‚Äôve offered $0.50 Venmo 
---
You know what sucks... I‚Äôve been a hugeFallout fan for YEARS... not quite as long as many, but for quite a long time, and I‚Äôve been waiting since half way through playing Fallout 3 to be able to play this game with my best friend, and I do in fact Thoroughly enjoy this game and is some cases I defend to the best of my ability, but... I couldn‚Äôt agree more that Bethesda has seriously screwed up.. big time... I just recently joined this sub, but since I joined just a couple of weeks ago there has been an enormous shift in the public.. I still love playing the game I just spent three hours on it last night with my girlfriend helping her through her quests, but they have seriously messed up, and they need to take into account what they have done.. if they want this game to last years like they originally intended they really need to do something big OTHER THAN PVP!! 
---
It felt gratuitously sickening to build and scrap say, 20 radiums and get nothing! When I got down to 2 left I went all out and bought extra mats and with super duper on I made 49. Scrapped them, learned 1 mod. Oh, if you don't know, and I didn't until I'd finished, apparently the science perk that affects weapon cost applies to the radium. I really wish I'd known that earlier, i.e. before I'd learned them all...
---
A respect should be given. If someone spec'd extra points into int for the explosives build then decides with this nerf it wasn't viable or what they enjoyed they should be given some free respect points instead of being forced to waste points that would go elsewhere. 
---
&gt;Did you expect perfection?
---
They've had three months to fix whatever could be fixed.
---
OMG, I can‚Äôt be worse than that!
---
You're missing the most important stealth gun - the dart gun from Fallout 3.  Always fun shooting the legs of the super mutant bearing down on you to hobble him while the poison soaks in.
---
"most" people...  the loudest people do not always constitute the majority
---
I didn't defend them per se, but I didn't abandon them right away either. I told others that asked me about the game to stay away until things smoothed out.
---
Well, now I am staying away. I cant sit by and watch someone keep doing cocaine after so many people have tried to intervene over and over and over. I will no longer be an enabler. It is time for Bethesda to check themselves into rehab willingly, I dont want fallout76 to die but it seems like they are just keeping it in an induced coma instead of trying to cure the disease. 
---
I RP scenarios in my head or with a friend and we go through the motions of said RP. 
---
The other day I create an "adhesive farm" (created vegetable starch which we broke down into adhesive). I dressed like a farmer used a Mr Handy weapon as my farming tool and sat there talking to a friend as the farm grew it's yield.
---
Other days I'll find an owned workshop and PvP it creating a scenario about who owns it and why I need it.
---
Last night I just used the game as an excuse to hang out with a friend and talk to her about life in general as we messed around and did nearly nothing.
---
I treat the game like a sandbox for my own RPing. When private servers come out I think that RP ability will increase adding more value to the game. 
---
You're a very sweet person
---
Make it 15 weight and you've got yourself a deal.
---
Question: why the fuck would you buy anything with real money in this game? Do you realize you are telling the devs that all this bullshit is ok when you continue to give them money? Do you realize you are part of the reason Beth games are starting to be complete shit? Please stop wasting your money and enabling these worthless cash grabs.
---
Because they do have them. I'm assuming you don't trade stocks.
---
Exactly this! They claim they are listening and will look into it. Then a patch comes out and their "listening" turns into, "People thought this was an issue so let's make it worse!". 
---
They already teased it, it‚Äôs called PvP mode üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
My biggest frustration is i have 20 bobby pins in my rl bookbag and they dont weigh 2 lbs.  I joke of course because i agree that this patch angered a lot of people who liked the tse.  I never cared about them.  I am annoyed i have to go back and forth to my inventory to craft to scrap bulk items to craft anything.  When working a full time job i only have so many hours to play so inventory management because of a patch is annoying.
---
Yeah, I was excited to get calibrated shocks for my excavator and X01, only to find out they cost 50 percent more than a mutation for an excavator, and the X01 plans aren't available.  There are a ton of plans I want, but they are soooooo expensive.
---
  I started doing my rounds of killing and selling items picked up for my Daily 1400 caps, and stopped at the second vendor.  It was already getting tedious, but seeing how much everything is now, I just couldn't get as excited.  I wish they would removed the cap limit on the vendors.  I'd be more inclined to stay on longer and do things.  Either that, or increase stash so I can store some things to sell later.
---
It‚Äôll be in the same state it is right now, for a long long time. They need to stop all this new content, and focus on fixing the game.
---
Cool! I did not know that! I would have nabbed that off the cracked up old hag after I finished her off with the jet.
---
Since this sub does not think Bethesda is sufficiently remorseful for making a video game, patches sre now expected to come with resignation letters and / or suicide notes that thank the community for their tireless efforts in posting to Reddit
---
So wait, they made the bobby pins weight go up, bulk scrapping got bugged, and one other thing I can't recall, something with known plans that were actual big issues after their most recent, massive patch with lots of changes.  These will be hotfixed.  
---
Why are we back to suddenly crying that the sky is falling?
---
Of course I can't claim everything is 100% right, I even mention the fact we can't see everything on the HUD post, we are working half blind.  
---
But allot of what we can see, we can prove is not working properly, the community has decoded enough of the game files to allow us to follow the linkage.   
---
I am not trying to claim / assert there is a pre-estabilished line of communication or Dialog, but some of us have either been contacted by on Reddit/BethNet/Discord by Community Managers from time to time, and thus far little, if anything of what we've reported has been resolved.  
---
The point of this is to **try and establish a dialog**. Its clear they need help, and some have been trying to give it since the BETA, without success.  All I'm trying to do is make it clear to them, and the community, that we are here.  
---
Maybe I'm wrong and there are some authors under NDA's working in the background already, but all "we" the consumers of this game can see is a team struggling.
---
Thank you! My friends at work recommended it to me and I've never played it. They wouldn't ruin it, and they told me not to look up anything beforehand.
---
BL is borderlands, which I've also never played. 
---
NO animal riding, all i can envision is Luke Skywalker on the Rancors back! it just doesn't fit Fallout at all.
---
Motorcycles however fit perfectly!
---
Motorcycles could act like PA sets. They are a basic chassis that you put components on to build an operational MC.  Paint job on the Atom store would sell. Some Configurations would create a Dirt Bike like MC that has great agility, build a Pockrocket for Spd or a Cruiser that has a lot of armor.
---
If we can take a 25 yr old Nuked PA set out of the dirt and put it on (see trailers) then I am sure we can put a MC back together.
---
Vegans...
---
Just fire the the people making updates and get a better team. 
---
An armor piercing attachment at the very least would help. Would love both that and a base damage buff because it‚Äôs total garbage right now
---
What it wouldn't be full of is punctuation.
---
1) I didnt spend any caps
---
2) I have every right to voice a complaint about game balance
---
I just picked up my copy, what is griefing?
---
Luck doesn't affect the loot drops, only the condition of the items you find
---
The problem isn‚Äôt boosting the damage the problem (like missiles) is the weight of the ordinance.  Crafting Fat Man bombs is really easy but you don‚Äôt want to be lugging them around and with storage limits it makes almost no sense to use it.  
---
Top ten worst games 2018
---
Down-voted?  People really can't detect sarcasm from context, can they?
---
I mean, come on, if you can't enjoy the game, uninstall it and move on. Everybody gets it, you're not having fun, but how is the circle jerk that is pissing on 76 making your life any more enjoyable? Find a game you enjoy and play that.
---
OP is spot on. Bethesda needs to take a look at who screwed this project up so bad and replace them with someone that is up to the task.
---
"  Automatic guns sucked and still suck after the buff.  "  
---
Pretty sure they were never buffed friend, unless someone can prove me wrong?
---
You already can respect. Respecing SPECIAL won't change the perk card. 
---
The perk still works. Sorry, nothing should double the damage of anything.
---
That's all this really is. Being upset that you still can't double up the damage. Sorry that you feel calling it for what it is is hostile. 
---
Sorry. 
---
Ah, okay, you've convinced me. I've heard good things about it.
---
fast crafting and the way the game saves stuff is apparently exactly what is causing these issues
---
Does that make it better or worse?
---
Well there are perks for the auto rifle and perks for the auto pistol. A lot of the rifle ones are perception I believe, while the pistol ones fall into agility. Having two guns that use the same ammo though is going to get expensive! There are creation perks for ammo too but getting the whole build together might not happen till the 60's. Try out one of the build planners like this [one](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1111111&amp;d=&amp;w=&amp;n=).
---
Yep. Or just set slap damage to a fixed number regardless of weapon used and buffs.
---
Shit. I just got the hand made plans and was gonna go mad. Ah well, I'm rocking melee just now anyway. Instigating War Drum, am I right?! 
---
I can't comment on the won't, none of us know what's going on in the background, right now it's about making it clear their is help available.
---
Sure, but this is a metric based on personal tastes, and not one backed by hard science, like medicine.
---
Wait... AO servers are still up?
---
Honestly, the biggest insult to me as a long time fan was when they dropped the price so soon after I just spent full price
---
But...  I thought declaring that you are done with a game is one of the most scariest and life changing things a human being could do?
---
Then what‚Äôs the ticker symbol?
---
Noice I'll take a look at this.
---
Fine!
---
Just wondering. .. If they actually had messed the code...  And had to revert to a previous one... 
---
Do you believe they would admit it?
---
&gt; Why not nerf shotgun base damage.
---
Because then you'd still have an absurdly powerful legendary version of a weapon, the only difference being that the non-legendary version would be atrocious. 
---
See the problem is there has been ONE person who had their threads deleted and got their account banned, they even provided evidence of the deeds so we know they are telling the truth, there's no evidence anyone else has had this done however.  
---
As far as I can tell, those threads were locked/deleted because they spread misinformation, they talked about the bugs and exploits that have come to light in the newest patch, but only one of those has been proven to be true so far the bobby pin weights.
---
With just 15 minutes of in game time you can find out that people are outright lieing over the Fusion Core generation rate being set back to 0.8p/h.
---
We have no evidence the main duping glitches are back, at least not that I've been able to track down.  
---
There has been an unholy amount of bitching surrounding this game, both from fans and people being overly critical of it.  
---
The style of game that FO76 is, it will always ALWAYS have bugs, glitches and exploits and people wanting to abuse all of those and more.  
---
The game can be updated every week for 10 years and still introduce new game breaking issues and problems, even old ones will reappear from time to time.
---
For those bitching about the nerfs, why?  
---
Bethesda's reasoning made sense for the perks, bring them inline with other perk cards that do the same, they stick out so much. Personally I'd like to see the raw damage cards revisited, we don't need 3 cards adding up to only 60% and taking up 6 points in our builds, 1 card each weapon type equalling 80% for 5 points is far more reasonable.  
---
The nerf to TSE isn't a nerf to guns, it's a nerf to legendary effects, my rifles still do the same damage as before the patch because surprise surprise the perk cards weren't touched nor was the base damage of these guns. ONLY the legendary effects.  
---
Personally I would have preferred to see Explosive become a Primary Trait and Anti-Armour take it's place in Secondary Traits, this would balance things out quite nicely and allowed Two-Shot and Explosive to remain a +100% modifier, as long as all existing TSEs were deleted from all inventories, but I'm sure people would bitch about that far more.  
---
Yes weapon durability still need increasing across the board, and extra increases to all energy weapons.  
---
Energy weapons also still don't get resistance penetration from perks, and need a flat damage buff as well.  
---
But, shit takes time.  
---
All the stuff that needs buffing can wait until the major exploits and issues are gone, a Dev team can't see proper usage stats until the things that do completely insane amounts of damage and trivialise existing content are out of the picture or within reasonable range.
---
YEP. 'I'm going to go on reddit and rant. THAT will show them!!!' If they actually did something more constructive. It must be too cold out to go hold cardboard signs at the BGS offices.
---
Oi! (Fence sitter)[https://youtu.be/VGErC6QQdoc]
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Finally someone gets it!
---
I told my bro i was going to get him Fo76 for Christmas so he could play with me as I preordered. 
---
Glad I got him Witcher 3 instead, RIP FO
---
Got to ask, even though "Username checks out" is very apt here, how is this BS?  
---
Download TESEdit and check some of the info yourself, the data is there, we are just trying to help.
---
The game gets boring, so let's make it harder for new players to advance and just grind, grind, grind. That's a great way to keep a player base. That or they are trying to force people to want to do more PVP which is just going to lead to griefing from bored high level players.
---
‚ÄúThis is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.‚Äù ‚Äï Martin Luther King Jr.
---
To not overstate the issue, this isn't some important political movement, it's just a video game. 
---
However, I feel the quote is apt because we've seen what the status quo position is for Bethesda, specifically back in beta.
---
It took them a fair while but after some pressure they put out this post addressing feedback:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9v0886/beta\_thankyou\_and\_addressing\_your\_feedback/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9v0886/beta_thankyou_and_addressing_your_feedback/)
---
Reading the post, you may notice that they were VERY resistant towards implementing an FoV slider. 
---
They also were looking to address the push to talk feature, which they were resistant with as it's made clear with the language in the post, especially considering it's really just a PC issue, something they went out of their way to highlight. Once again more pressure went from "We'd like to start with encouraging player interaction and will look into adding this in the future" to fast tracking it to the near future as a certain feature.
---
Note there's not a single mention of the issue of fps being locked to 60 because it was tied to the game's physics. Unlocking fps to allow it to go above 60 was one of the most requested features and it didn't even warrant a mention. It took an immense amount of pressure and 2 weeks of work to force BGS to solve a more than decade's old limitation.
---
We shouldn't just sit back and chill. We should be applying constant (but constructive and polite) pressure to ensure that the problems we deem as important as players get resolve.
---
Do you think we'd have a separate Survival mode coming if we just eased off on the PvP issues from both the PvP and PvE perspectives?
---
Aaaaahhh ok. I never played Borderlands either. Bought then secondhand at some point and just couldn't really get into it.
---
Definitely don't read anything about Bioshock. It's too good to ruin that way.
---
Fun fact, Bethesda literally had no sales goals for fallout 76 and their only concern was "rushing it to holiday release" according to ex-bethesda devs, which fully lines up with the development and state of the game üòÅ 
---
You keep being an angry prick though for no reason good luck with that üôÑüôÑ
---
Yes and the holidays events are still happen. And its have a live community
---
not like a laser pointer 
---
&gt;I still like the game
---
This was me prior to the latest patch, but the very next day the XB servers were down when I tried to log in, my IRL friend I bought 76 to play with quit the game after the two shot nerf reduced her two shot lever action rifle firepower (I play melee, so the last time we played together I spent most of my time keeping her alive in a nuke zone which we used to be able to do together), and the ridiculous bobby pin weight issue is back again.
---
I played this morning long enough to finish a game challenge I was close to completing and now I guess I've putting the game on hold until I read of significant improvements. I'm pretty sure my friend is gone for good. :\\
---
Anyway, I'm glad you still like it, but I guess what I'm saying is, I felt the same way this time last week. I never realized how close I was to going from, "I'm having fun" to "Well, I guess I'm done."
---
F'kin disgrace that it comes to this. Amongst all the bugs and broken features and bad customer service they start banning people for nothing to the point where recording game play is the only semi viable option :/
---
One thing after another with Bethesda it seems.
---
I've noticed and been troubled by the same. Previously was able to get a few more supplies, lord knows my weapons are terrible and enemies spawn quite soon on the heels of dead adversaries, wouldn't want me to acquire an extra stimpack or radaway... Like we need an atom purchase that respawns world containers ... Inbound possibly? I recall something of lunchboxes....
---
Did you check the terminal entries and logs too - I know one of the 2 is definitely from a terminal entry, wasn't sure about the 2nd one.
---
Press F to pay respects!
---
&gt;Cap Stashes: To help address cap exploits, caps stashes have been turned into containers, which allows them to properly reset and provide players with instanced loot.
---
First I've heard of any "exploit" with Cap Stashes.
---
We've tried, some of us have had conversations with Community managers in the past, to report bugs and other things, but the data we are passing over seems to be going nowhere.  
---
Some of the above linked stuff has been being reposted on Monthly round ups, and we have already submitted the issues as bugs, either through the page or directly through DMs.  
---
The point is less to get the Attention of the Community managers on this one (though they have ignored multiple pings on the other threads), more about getting the attention of the people who actually can make the calls and or force the fixes.  
---
Think of it like the Canvas bag...
---
We did indeed have a few adjustments for VATS that didn't make it into the patch notes the first time around. We've added the following: 
---
- **(Added Jan 31) VATS:** Now saves the last limb targeted by the player and will attempt to re-target that limb the next time VATS is activated.
---
- **(Added Jan 31) VATS:** Fixed an issue that granted critical charge after firing a critical hit.
---
- **(Added Jan 31) VATS:** Addressed an issue that could cause VATS shots that were rolled as hits to become blocked by poles and other objects with collision. As a result, VATS shots that should hit an enemy creature will now do so much more often.
---
I dropped one of my two fat man legendary launchers this morning.  Some dude returned the favor and dropped a legendary 2 shot Gauss Rifle.  Very nice.  I have been scrapping or dumping weapons routinely since the patch including a really nice legendary auto 50 cal.  Pay it forward!

If you read it has Red or Reed it still makes no sense.

I‚Äôm online now. Caps in-hand. 
---
Eh. You can just say I QUIT THIS GAME SUCKS and leave. That's what people are currently doing. But I can see what you mean
---
It's been depressing from day one, not much has really changed
---
why read something they have no intention of helping out with lol 
---
Nothing I like better than coming here and posting my opinion to see how many downvotes I get. If reddit charged $5 per downvotes and upvotes were free, then nobody would get downvoted.
---
So criticizing something that justifiably deserves to be criticized because you want that thing to be better or at least not damage future things it has a relation to is a bad thing? 
---
Are you saying all the Allied Powers in WW2 should have just "moved on" and not had a circle jerk over the holocaust because they thought what Hitler was doing deserved to be criticized and fought against? 
---
Yeah its really annoying when noobs do a base their just to have bunch of water purifiers gives me the urge to destroy it but not worth the wanted status and caps.
---
Yep, I gave up on them weeks ago - it's simply as the achievements/trophies, but prooved too much for BGS's developers...
---
This same mentality takes place on literally \*every\* subreddit at one point or another. It's a standard phenomena.
---
It used to be that people used the game's forums, which were easily whitewashed, so that only the most positive praise pieces existed. Now on reddit, we see this weird effort at posturing, where fans go full white knight, and just blindly defend companies and games from any and all criticism. The amount of times I've read "Don't like it, don't play it" has been staggering.
---
I kind of hope that, as a culture, we start turning on that type of posting style. It's awful, doesn't accomplish anything, and drives away interested-yet-concerned players by dismissing valid concerns and criticisms in lieu of blind zeal.  
---
This shit is almost identical to the /r/paragon subreddit from back in the day, with swaths of people ASSURING YOU everything was fine, up until the day the game's cancellation was announced.
---
Nope it‚Äôs still very broken for me too.
---
Diablo 2 will always trump most games lol. 
---
Idk what it is honestly, but I recently bought a battle chest from Target for like 20 bucks. Right. Back. In. 
---
That reads like a post-apocalyptic math word problem.

Q: Wanda has six functional shotguns and one broken shotgun. She uses three of the functional shotguns to repair her broken shotgun. Now what does Wanda have?
---
They can't be caring that much about the eldar scroll series either, if they did they wouldn't be using an already dated and aging creation engine they've used since pre history.
---
If they cared that much about it they'd be using a new engine that can take the strain a game of this gen or next would do 
---
Yes, Perk Effects are very dependent on Keyword filters/linkages.  
---
As are weapons.. The reason some heavy weapons (Autogrenade launcher I'm looking at you) are no longer "heavy" are missing keywords that tell the engine to Identify X as Y.
---
There were a few adjustments for VATS that hadn't originally made it into the patch notes, and we've added the following:
---
Additionally, we'll look into your report about the recon scope, thank you for mentioning it!
---
Yes, it was acknowledge by Bethesda.
---
That's stupid.  There's nothing wrong with mule characters in any game.  This isn't a pretend game on the playground where you have to play right or everyone gets mad at you.  They need to put hard mechanics in place if they don't want players doing this.  It's absolutely ridiculous to defend Bethesda for suspending someone for having a fucking mule character.  That's outrageous.

That goes both ways, I was referring to those who express those opinions in a very childlike manner whereas the other person was referring to those who think Bethesda can do no wrong.

The game client is already pulling that info from the server. Having the app pull it from the game client that has already pulled it from the server doesn't add anything.

I'm not for or against the idea I just wanted to point out your misunderstanding. 
---
&gt; I believe the **online single playe**r platform will soon become standard across the board.
---
That will be a dark day indeed. 
---
Is it not clear by now? Bethesda are clueless....even that CM, asked for ref number even though it was on the guys screen shot??
---
What are they playing at.
---
Not yet...  
---
But I don't think any of us are getting mods until the game is stable, playable and ready for it.
---
It's as effective as declaring to the world that you can no longer defend them and are quitting FO76.
---
Not many people really care what you are doing.
---
There is a step required to unlock the account on the terminal, that doesn't properly display, I can't remember exactly where, but if you toggle the quest to be inactive then active again it may fix it, worked for me.
---
Oh &amp; make sure you removed the holotape, and reload it once you have unlocked the account.
---
Overloaded?
---
that some developer of the face they say they are going to do answer questions every time and you're done so hard ? 1 day a month 20 minutes to answer. It is not enough to publish on your page. They made us believe that we would have the vaults in January, but it will be March  we just want to know what will happen with the game 
---
Damn this game gets alot of shit. The name Bethesda just went from one of the most loved and respected developers/publishers to one of the worst.
---
Apparently farming caps stashes is an exploit. Apparently we have to log in once a day to sell 200 caps worth of crap to 7 vendors and wait 24 hours to get more caps.
---
It has been used successfully for a number of different things.  It was one of the things used to help convince Amazon to pick up the Expanse tv show after SciFi cancelled it.
---
Thx for the pics, but they seem to be all the same...no TS or E...?
---
I was agreeing with you.
---
Oh, you're changing from he said that ' "True Fans" don't complain ' to ' "True Fans" made posts here trying to support the Devs ' ? 
---
He mentioned trying to remain positive, but nowhere did he say what you said, he said. His post was a criticism towards/against Bethesda, not the "whiners" or "Cry babies".
---
Because its unheard of for a developer to actually regress their bug fixes by simply being very lazy or very stupid and reverting to a full old build of the game. 
---
It's just another piece of this flaming trainwreck of a game and studio. 
---
&gt; But getting the mod you don't want isn't like rolling snake eyes.
---
I repeat: I am not talking about getting a mod that I don't want. 
---
Do you understand that? 
---
I am talking about the same mod being given as a reward- every single fucking time I do the quest. 
---
There is no more apt comparison than rolling snake eyes 20 times. 
---
None. 
---
prove how, do you think they are going to release internal data that shows how they detect that he was duping? I can think of literally zero times ever that a company has done that. But that's fine, everybody can keep down voting me like bethesda has to respond to every random person on reddit that makes up a story. This is coming from someone that isn't happy with fo76 and hasnt played in probably a month.
---
It does though. [https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Left%20on%20read](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Left%20on%20read) It's like your message on facebook messenger getting 'seen' 5 hours ago but you have gotten no response.
---
Read this reddit.
---
I‚Äôm worried now too, I crafted a lot of Western Revolvers to try and get mods for my TSE Western :(
---
I‚Äôve played since beta and I‚Äôve played legit the whole time. I‚Äôve stuck with this game because I love it even with all its flaws/bugs/nerfs with every patch. But if I get banned for some garbage like that I would quit. No one would care, not even Bethesda, but I‚Äôd be done. 
---
Considering the games god awful sales in this case it's safe to assume they do. 
---
Your choice and right as a free citizen of what ever country you call home.  
---
I don't know where I stand there right now, it's been a rough few months, but I'm trying to avoid the hate and focus on trying to help.
---
If they ever decide to implement perk build slots like you said they should give us the ability to change them by using certain key combinations, finding myself dropping sth. because I missclicked in my pip boy inventory is scary and stupid.
---
Especially for Pc users, why can't we rebind T to open the perk system directly?
---
Also, even though mods help they really shouldn't be this important in order for me to enjoy the game!
---
It was totally spur of the moment. My wife just started spamming the screenshot button, then we realized she had captured enough to make an animated GIF. We'll be installing ShadowPlay tonight
---
It's full of cry babies and people posting the same things to get karma points.
---
Skyrim 2100.
---
What? You're gonna have to speak up.
---
I definitely can understand how you feel. How so many of you feel. Obviously it was not ready. More work should of been done. Bethesda should of made it very clear on its state before release or just left it in Beta testing and sold it as early access. Im not one to cry over spilt milk. For me it is water under the bridge. What is done is done. I do see Bethesda putting out some effort even though it seems like with every launch of fixes somthing else breaks. Regardless i feel with our continued feedback eventually it will all work out. If it doesn't,  well it will be Bethesdas loss, people with think twice about purchasing games from them in the future.  For most of us it was some entertainment for the price of a night out. Most people have had bad experiences that cost much more. take the fyre festival for example that is what you call a real kick in the nuts. Buying a game that did not meet your expectations well thats life it happens all the time. 
---
Am i disappointed in some of the decisions made? Absolutely i am..... I put over 100 hours in the game and my build just got a nurf that pretty much leaves it unplayable in a pvp aspect. I can play support if im with a group lol. See im looking at the positive üòä. I posted about my feelings but i did not throw a big baby fit and call them every name in the book. Some of the posts i read from people it is absolutely ridiculous. Grow up. toss the game in the trash and move on if that is how you feel about it. I feel confident eventually we will get a fair balance. I feel Bethesda is yea off to a bad start but will take the win in the end with our continued support and feedback. I personally do not believe that we will be left with a broken game forever. Relax peeps be cool.  If you want to see success of Fallout76  simply point out bugs and issues as you see them. Obviously they need us otherwise it would of been done right at launch.
---
It's not a bad game its a broken game. They didn't even finish it and they still haven't. They sold a what was basically early acess as a beta changed nothing upon release and almost 3 months later are reintroducing bugs that they fixed? This isn't a mistake it's incompetent. Need I add the fact that they're censoring posts too? How can anyone defend them?
---
It's my belief that fo76 was a test for elder scrolls. If they already didn't care about making a new fallout game then the best scenario for a company would be to use the name to profit while setting the communities standards low for the next elder scrolls while also improving on the engine and learning from their mistakes.
---
Lower standards + minor improvements = "major success" with a side of money 
---
1 post lots of upvotes. He made it sound as though there are tons of examples of this. 1 does not prove that. I admit someone said it. Wow... 
---
I agree with everything in your well-written post except for the very last sentence.  I think Bethesda is already there and considering that the only big thing they have lined up between now and March is a tone deaf PvP mode, new PvE stuff will inevitably be too little, too late.
---
Because, and you touch on this as well, right now, the Scorchbeast Queen is basically the raid content.  And in Patch 5, they've made it so no one wants to do it.  It costs too much ammo, it wrecks your armor, bugs out half the time, and gives players almost nothing in return.  The Vaults, as we understand them so far, are going to be raid dungeons like the missile silos.  You put two and two together and there's a reason why the situation is hopeless.
---
The developers have the wrong attitude for the game they are making and, indeed, for Fallout in general.  Most of us are here because we wanted "Fallout 4 with co-op."  Instead of fixing broken quests and adding new ones, we get competitive PvP and this sucky "Nerf the fun, increase the grind, give nothing in return" philosophy.
---
:)
---
If there's any incentive to grind now, I'm just not seeing it.
---
Yeah that is why I'm hoping anthem doesn't suck since its touched by EA.
---
ESO is made by a totally different studio. Also they've worked hard to fix and turn ESO into a genuinely pretty great game to be fair. 
---
Skyrim bit though yes fully agreed with, modders had to fix that game. 
---
Yup, this kind of thing also happens when drawing. I don't draw anymore but people always said to rotate your paper or flip the drawing if digital, you'll see your mistakes and can correct them. Though I'm pretty sure you can't just rotate your code around to see your errors, haha
---
Communal thanks, not all of the above work is mine, as I mention.  
---
As to why they've not used it, I don't know... It could be PR, it could be legal pitfalls, honestly I don't know...  
---
But we need a dialog, we need some answers, and we need something we can play.
---
I think that is a great mentality to have, I just can't justify spending 80 pounds on a game to have played it only a few hours because it was that bad and still is. 
---
It is legal stealing in my eyes. 
---
Still waiting on that 15k melee dam... Which you will never reply cause you are talking out of your ass.
---
That's what happens when a company sells a buggy, flawed piece of cow pie to their customers. They complain.
---
You think Bethesda is the only company releasing games with problems? 
---
First the community says we want Bethesda to come down hard on dupers, and now it looks like they're swinging the ban hammer a little too wildly (this is the third report of this I've seen). Glad to see they're making an effort, but looks like they need to hone the process. Please keep this up-to-date, hope your ban is lifted.
---
The ladder reset every 6 month's helps a lot.
---
The randomness of the loot is perfect. The ability to play hardcore . to bot ( if you in to that ) it his all spots that i cant resist
---
do you play on XB1? if you do, I will sell u some for a reasonable price.
---
I‚Äôll be on around 7pm ET this evening, gt is same as here.
---
Can the hat be removed and changed with a different hat?
---
I agree. Although simply executing Todd Shitface is too lenient. He should have his fingers all Individually broken and finger nails all pulled out before biting the bullet
---
Many of us said the game would be bad as soon as it was announced. Many of us still tried to support it. Many of us are beyond flabbergasted at they're continued failure. 
---
Literally any online game you can think of with a trading system will have an economy. An economy means there will be "Real World Trading". It is frowned upon but not illegal. Usually Real World Trading happens because people put value on these items. It's a good thing because it gives real value to the items and to the game. But it is bad because it can create a black market or create incentives to take shortcuts. 
---
Making it so the developer takes over this is just as bad as real world trading, the only problem now is that the developer can influence the rarity and can control every aspect of the value of something. It is worse than real world trading.
---
I have to ask, do you identify as an "anti FO76" hater as he mentions it?
---
Its the project managers and creative directors that make the calls and constructive feedback needs to get to them. Joe Developer is not going to be able to do much outside of what he has been assigned to do.
---
Sea of Thieves did the same thing. They constantly announced "new game changing content"...then announced a standalone "pvp mode" and that is their idea of adding content.
---
Don't know, and honestly am not worried, just focused on trying one last time to help.
---
The only people who get things changed usually are the ones who yell and scream and pitch a fit. 
---
I'm level 104 and the things in the Mire still annoy me.  Gulpers and a couple other things tank my best weapons like a champ.  I can get through them, but I just avoid them, and the Mire if at all possible.  It's a shame too, because the atmosphere is incredible.
---
I have literally spoken to dozens of redditors posting and supporting these negative style posts who have never spent 1 minute playing the game. Upvotes doesn't mean players, it mean people who read the rhetoric and believe so they get mad, support it and carry on. This game was hated from announcement. I agree that mentality is terrible and has nothing to do with being a true fan.
---
Maybe Bethesda just doesnt want us to play their game anymore.
---
Where the fuck are you getting your cheese that the cheddar is white? That's fucked
---
But wait there's more.
---
When give anyone or anything the benefit of the doubt and it doesn't go well, that's on you. 
---
Completely different game studio. A simple google search will tell you as much. 
---
Okay, thanks! Will try this when I get a chance.
---
No I‚Äôm not defending anyone doing this and neither should you.
---
I find it rather interesting as you have all the people fed up with Bethesda on one side and then you have the die hard fanboys defending the game (to a nonsensical degree sometimes) on the other. All of this feels a tad crazy at this stage but makes for good reading on the throne lol.
---
Because they lie about sending the info over? Incapable of doing the ticket themselves? Trying to gate the response and slow down the turn around time....
---
Its very weird that they would get all of that info say they've made the team aware, then request a support ticket to make the same team aware ...
---
So, wait,  it's ok for me to enjoy the game but  I have "no right" to complain that people are whining? Isn't that exactly what you are doing? How do you get to determine what my "rights" are and how do your rights trump mine?
---
Let's also discuss "objective" vs. "Subjective". Pretty much everything call out as objective is actually just your opinion, ergo subjective. TSE got nerfed and now the game is "literally unplayable". I dont own or use OP TSEs, so see, subjective, not objective. Bobby pins reverted to 0.1 weight, game is "literally unplayable". I carry &lt; 20 as there is no reason to... see, subjective again. Plans now show "owned" when a player already knows that plan. That's a good thing for everyone. Objective. 
---
Finally the statement of "
---
It's because they rolled the version of the game back one or two versions
---
That must be some kind of mutation.
---
People‚Äôs Liberation Army is the Chinese Army
---
You could be right, but atleast I'll know I tried.
---
Thats what I'm thinking...but I never see uranium fever active.  Guess I'll have to sit on the mine and server hop.
---
When was that? Do you have a link to an actual article that supports the claim or is this just from the 'fanboy underground'
---
Same as Batteleye games. Dont cheat and you dont have to worry about it. 
---
/thread
---
I use all my excess scraps to make ammo for my non melee friends. 
---
Meanwhile I run around injecting strange mutating serums into myself, then swilling booze and chems to drown out the cries from the subreddit. 
---
In all seriousness, since this last patch my unarmored melee build has been fun but taking more damage than I used to from enemies. It makes adrenal reaction feel like a very serious tradeoff. I actually get to hit stuff rather than everything getting melted by a TSE before I get there. During the queen, I find that I‚Äôm much more needed to clear trash around her than I used to be. 
---
They used the name to make money and called it a game. There is no regulations on what constitutes a "full game." They can sling whatever they want as a full game. It looks like a full game, it sounds like a full game, it just doesn't play like a full game.
---
My best melee is still by far my 3* super mutant super sledge with + %40 dmg to SMs. One shot on head...ragdoll.
---
I still am looking for a TSE though, because sometimes it's just fun to deal dmg from a distance. 
---
I do like the fact that ppl with no skill and half my lvl cant one shot me b/c they bought their primo weapon on Ebay. I refuse to buy to dominate...not fun at all.
---
If I find it though, look out. ;)
---
Or maybe they just want shit to change or be better? 
---
That‚Äôs the point.  Now you can just play the game and either get the drop or guaranteed to have it available when you have enough.  No need to server hop for days hoping for RNG to work in your favor. 
---
Only thing I know is you can roleplay as a minuteman wannabe helping people that need it like new players or raider and be wanted force of destruction which is more punishing and pretty dickish.
---
There is allot of anger, and I've got more than a little myself, but if I'm forced to walk away atleast I'll know I tried.
---
I have automatic pistol perk at level 3
---
But it doesn't affect my 10 mm pistol.
---
No damage increase. 
---
Maybe i have to use the gunslinger perk?
---
The fact is that i like explosive weapons and these two are the only ones that i've found till now, also the pistol is vampir and is pretty good for recovering my health bar.
---
&gt;I for one think we should all be proud of these marvelous people quitting a video game, and their contributions to... something about the game and community (help please? I‚Äôm not exactly sure how their contributions would be described)
---
Ever heard of a boycott or a protest? Nah, I guess being snarky about 'lol quitting the game doesn't contribute' is better.
---
I wonder why anyone thought Bethesda ever needed more time.
---
They re-released skyrim many times. Glitches that were in the game in 2011 are still there on the Switch version. The fact that some people still believes that Bethesda cares about fixing their products is incomprehensible as they have never shown any will to do so in other products.
---
If you think private servers are coming, I‚Äôve got a copy of Half Life 3 to sell you. 
---
Someone in a meeting sold this idea somehow, thinking they're losing players quickly because they're progressing too quickly. And new content costs money.
---
If Bethesda was trying they wouldn't have rushed the game out for a Christmas release a year before it's ready.
---
Fuckin  casuals
---
I personally believe that posts. If they're true, it ALL makes sense. Everything.
---
Not talking about monetizing anything, I'm talking about trying to help.  
---
And trust me, the tin foil hats are making the rounds, because allot of the choices made by Bethesda/Zenimax are darn hard to understand.
---
If your main quest is empty then you're bugged. After you finished all the quests from the top of the world npc she should direct you to one of the bunkers where you start the Free States questline. After that you have BoS and Enclave questlines. 
---
A lot of side quests are location specific and they'll trigger after entering an area or reading a terminal.
---
Because, I don't give into being bullied. Obviously I did eventually. I am pretty patient and am very crafty, so I did my thing. 
---
I don't want someone to not enjoy the game. Just don't do it at everyone else's  expense.  Don't ruin someone else's time. If I ever play again, and am asked to do pvp, I might consider it, but don't force it on me. If I wanna shoot people I play other games like Red Dead. That game you absolutely know what will happen and what you are in for. I think Bethesda should just make separate servers for each set of players. Then everyone would be happy. I think.
---
old news, do some reading before you post another useless topic
---
Is the confusion because he asked for a support ticket?
---
I'm the writer of the original post in this group.  I'm the one who's tweet to Bethesda went viral.  I assure you, there were no credit card numbers besides the card used and the last 3 digits.  
---
don't get me wrong. i'm not saying by any means that what was said by the community in the last months was useless. in the contrary. however, let me ask you this: "where is your limit ?". At which moment you decide that you output enough energy on something that you paid 60-80$. Everyone has a limit. that was mine. instead of getting salty i just decided to put it away for a while and get away from all this over the top drama.
---
 One Man Sky turned out to be great after 18 months, Destiny 2 got great with Forsaken. I'm confident that Bethesda will put something together that please mostly everyone at some point. But probably not this week...  
---
hey... i was just trying to propose a drama less point of view and remind people that games should bring you something positive. that was all.
---
btw, thanks for your interesting and constructive comment.
---
Nothing in life ever gets changed or improved except when people blow up about it and cause a huge uproar. 
---
Were you just born or something??? 
---
I think it‚Äôs supposed to be 9 ‚Äòe‚Äôs
---
Not just all the changes but relevant info as well e.g. yes vendors will have all plans available but no mention that there will be price increases or a justification for why those prices were increased.
---
Useful info to have ahead of time rather than getting a fairly rude shock in-game.
---
Eh, I don't have "Favorite" companies anymore as I was let down one too many times. I guess first it was Valve, then it was Overkill, then it was Bethesda, then I guess Valve "kicked me while I was down" and now Bethesda just outright "executed me".
---
Feels good. Im taking more damage too. I like the added challenge! Pve was too easy!
---
I give my friends lead and steel too !
---
I want to choose one of them to upgrade considering my actual build, so if guerrilla doesn't increase damage output for smg what perk can?
---
I convinced three friends to buy this game and also picked up a copy for my kid.  As of yesterday none of the previous mentioned including myself are playing.  I'm not sure my three friends will ever buy anything I recommend again.  They all purchased it at full price and were already peeved about the price drop a week later.  Then the continuous rollout of buggy patches, lack of end game content, and this recent disaster patch V5 was it for them.  
---
A sad day for FO 76 it is indeed.
---
Only if they *actually* quit the game. You know, uninstall it. break their discs. Whatever. 
---
They also have to stop posting on the forums. Can't really be a person that can give feedback when you quit. 
---
The post doesn‚Äôt need to be for me to have permission to say I‚Äôm sick of these diva posts, they can whine and I can say how ridiculously entitled and stupid they sound, and the world keeps turning. 
---
The large amount of backlash is largely from Youtubers and other content creators.
---
Like dont get me wrong 76 is like a 5, 6 at best, but plenty of 5s and 6s go without the shitstorm. Hell the complaints and hate train started the day a multiplayer fallout game was announced, 76 was kind of sunk from the start. 
---
Criticism and pointing out flaws is one thing but just hate training is the same as being a loyal fanatic. Reminds me a lot of sea of thieves at launch and look at it now. Let's just hope Bethesda sticks with it and isn't scared away by the legion of hate cause I would like to see where they go with it. 
---
I think it's perfectly fine to call out people for "dev bashing" when all they're doing is attacking someone's character. Like Todd and Pete are sitting on a pile of money smoking cigars while the servers burn or something. Just because we can't see what they're doing behind closed doors, doesn't mean they don't give a shit. Yesterday there was a post that literally just attacked Todd, and said something like "I guess we see what kind of personality he has" or some shit. Give me a break.
---
I chose not to play last night for the first time since launch due to the state of the game. I'm waiting for the hotfix they announced **the day after the patch** before jumping back in. I'm not blind. I see that there are issues. But we have no idea what's going on inside Bethesda, and to accuse devs of being bad people because of a mistake is disingenuous. It's just looking for someone to blame, and Todd and Pete are the only people everyone knows.
---
Still waiting on my ban for speed crafting hundreds of boiled water
---
Constant negativity and shitting on Bethesda and the game is the only thing that helps the fallout community because its the most pressure you can put on Bethesda to not fuck up the next fallout. 
---
&gt;Yes I'd like to buy shares in this company that doesn't trade on the stock exchange please.
---
Put on that magazine noisy perk and keep your eyes open and you‚Äôll com across it eventually.
---
&gt;They forgot the duplication part
---
Define irony
---
&gt;now that we aren't getting one shotted by everyone?
---
no offense, but my guess is that you're just not very good at the game. melee is the only build capable of outputting 50K damage per swing.
---
even before the nerf.
---
Even if he is lying about it, how do you justify taking away all the games on his account for something he did in one online game?
---
Imagine if a hacker got caught cheating on TF2, steam bans him from his entire account, so the dude can no longer play Skyrim. How the fuck is that okay? 
---
I don't think they are trashing it on purpose but rather keep pulling resources from 76 towards future Bethesda projects. It's the same issue as Master Chief Collection, 343 was more focused on getting halo 5 out rather then fixing MCC. It's not until more recently are they actually trying to get it fixed. I'm going to boycott Bethesda until they focus more on fixing 76, give the Bethesda Game Studios Austin more help and actually fix their game.

I took a break from most games for several years and had not touched Fallout since 1&amp;2.

It might be rusty, it might have a ton of problems, but it's yours and you'll do your best to keep it running.

They would get back to you in a more timely manner but they have to devote all their time and energy to reading all the posts on reddit. So If everyone would please cry into their pillow instead of displaying their keyboard warrior skills here, this player can get a reply from BGS and hopefully get back into the game! Thanks. Downvote away, fucktards.

You misunderstood slightly my bad. What I mean is it SHOULD be OP enough that I can't easily carry 80 minis and fire like an OP TSE pre Nerf. I believe it should be so OP that even with the dense And fireproof I'd blow myself up using it(with the caveat that ammo is much more scarce)
---
I will be honest, I actually liked the game for about 2 weeks but after that it got kinda boring and once it got boring for me its flaws began to stand out for me. As for those making posts after defending the game, well they are only beginning to catch to what everyone else has been saying for months.
---
You get all the perks at max level eventually. Suck it up buttercup

...Because duping vanilla crafted weapons would get you far.

Sheesh Bethesda.  
---
I'm glad I didn't go nuts on the lever action mods I was going to start "farming" last night.
---
I bought this for my friend and we had this grand plan on how we were going to set up a sort of roleplay community for ourselves. Had all the documents and backend work ready, even had a discord setup to create our own little company in the fallout wasteland. At first we tried to push through the bugs, it's a Bethesda game so we weren't too surprised. But eventually it just grated on us too much and within about a month we've stopped playing entirely. Now the general response to me trying to drum up interest in logging into 76 is "Eww" from the others, and that's on the rare times I want to log in and see what's changed. 
---
It sounds like Bethesda does not have a fix for the mass items duping exploit.  Instead they just target anyone crafting a bunch of items, somehow 20 is a bunch, and they ban them.  What a pathetic attempt at a fix for an in game exploit. 
---
No the fact that hes passed the info on, made the team aware and can't put in a support ticket (if that is what is needed after telling the team) himself. 
---
Whats the point of him telling the team and then coming back to the customer to jump through hoops for them? 
---
As someone who works in the SWQA field I think they really banked on the BETA as the offical QA for this and it shows. 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt believe for a second that Todd had any interest in creating 76 at all. Pretty sure his hand was forced and he was told to smile and wave. 
---
Until AFTER the community found out, then they go back and retcon their patch notes. That right there should be illegal as fuck.
---
Don't forget that on PC you still can't rebind keys properly. In a AAA game from 2018.
---
I'm surpised they haven't nerfed "Fortune Finder" and "Cap Collector." Or have they?
---
Except literally nothing in human history would ever have gotten better or improved if people didnt keep complaining about stuff and causing an uproar???

Technically it's ZeniMax who developed the game not bethesda or rather not Bethesda Game Studios that normally does Elder Scrolls games so not entirely the same.

Look into an aae shotgun. Vibes better with melee builds as a ranged alt weapon. 
---
Ranged cant be one shotting melee. The best weapon needs to be 2+ shots for the kill. I like to put it this way: How many free shots do they get while we charge at them in an open field?
---
PvP balance is nice for us right now!
---
No, those were just the mods I got from scrapping the ones that I just made. I had a TS homemade, lost it, don't know how I didn't sell it. I am looking for an Anti-Armor one tho.
---
Yeah a lvl 200+ had like a 4k bounty griefing ton of poor lvl 80s or below.
---
For me, when it launched, it was barely even a game because it kept crashing on me lol. I really shouldn't laugh though as its kind of sad in hindsight to see one of my favourite developers crash so hard :/. It's all the people in denial about it that make me shake my head.
---
Would you like to elaborate or are you just going to drop a one liner and be good with that?
---
I bought the the game because of my friends too. We have all stopped playing after a few months of launch. It‚Äôs not their fault or yours man. It was just a bad product. We had fun while playing but the bugs and stuff just got too much for us. 
---
Screw this game and screw Bethesda, you cant do anything right just quit while your behind.

Beth has only had fallout 3 and Skyrim? What about them entire Elder Scrolls series? Also fallout 4 has some pretty damn good reviews and sales, it just wasn‚Äôt game of the year material like people thought it would be. Elder Scrolls online is the most played MMO currently. Wolf stein and Doom where also very highly praised and sold well enough. Very few games release on the same open world scale as Bethesda games. They‚Äôre still completely unique, and that‚Äôs part of what still sets them apart. As far as PR goes it hasn‚Äôt b

Change your view to see your character when you speak- you should see the ‚Äòspeak‚Äô icon above your character. After they added ‚Äúpush to chat‚Äù I had difficulty mapping my preferred key to chat (double check yours in audio settings). It kept switching back for me. I find it easier to change from ‚Äúpush to chat‚Äù to always on and now just use my mute switch on my headset.

so I have to ask, what did he say?
---
It's gettin to be like r/BreakUps over here!
---
The first intelligent reply! Thank you!
---
I agree that there are almost certainly bad or (more likely) inexperienced/underexperienced project managers involved, but I *have* seen a lot of anger and vitriol at the team as a whole, decrying "the developers", etc. which is not productive either from a critical/critique perspective or from a community perspective.
---
Providing specific, pointed feedback is fine. A few cathartic screeches at the moon, okay. But this sub is having a meltdown over a patch that...honestly, *did* make things better for all but like the 3% of the playerbase who are level 100+ and min/maxing. 
---
I think critiques about how they're handling respecing are valid. An in-game cap-sink for it should at least be available so that people level 250 don't have to grind for centuries to respec. I have no idea what sort of toggles they have available to make that happen or if a new system like this could be exploited and then bitched about adnauseum. A simple SPECIAL refund upon major patches would also be nice/generate good will, I am a fan of that solution as well.
---
Making cosmetics is easier than implementing actual fixes...and provide content for people who like it. Lots of people are enjoying decorating their CAMPs with new items, etc. The people working on the next build/patch are not the same people modeling/texturing the #x powerarmour skin. That's just reality.
---
UPDATE: I played around with these some more last night and it seemed to matter if you had the gas prices sign in the photo. That sign isn't part of the main building; it's off by the road. Maybe coincidence or maybe the solution.

why did you think mods could save an online multiplayer game? are you mental

You will get more damage if you repair above 100% but I don't think the base CND affects the damage.

Good tips! I noticed the same thing when modding my hunting rifle - one of the mods to increase its bash damage also gave a big boost to its condition, and the other mods in that category only offered slight upgrades to rate of fire and other things. I find that the magnification in the game from just a long barrel and glow circle or dot to be plenty, and the scopes just kind of disorient me.

it was 100% clear the game would be lazy bullshit, i don't know what you expected

Nope. My world view is limited

If anybody bothers to check my previous posts in this subreddit you will see i was bringing up all the issues the game has yet my posts were getting downvoted and i was getting "told" that i have jumped on the hate train.

How times have changed...

why did they do this?
---
Lol had* "Damn you small buttons!!!"
---
Dude, you gotta hop of Bethesda‚Äôs dick. They‚Äôre not gonna stick around to meet your parents
---
I've got allot of frustration as well, the patch this week quite literally rendered me unable to play (long story).  
---
It's our right as Consumers to make companies know they've messed up with our wallets and our voices..  There is no way Bethesda/Zenimax doesn't know they have a problem here.  
---
I'm hoping they are going to learn from this (the Bag debacle alone has to be costing them tremendously in both PR and bottom line) and let in some help.  
---
If they don't, I have a clean conscience.
---
Bye bye muler 
---
with time, i'm sure they will put something together that will please the players. 
---
I loved the old school method of repairing in New Vegas and actually hoped to see it return in a form like this. My issue is the parts required to repair don't scale with condition, you can't use scrapper to strip resources you need, and heavy weapons during the late game (especially the energy gatlings) have abysmal condition.
---
Just a justification of why I like condition: Most of these guns have been laying around in the dust for 25 years, in 3/NV even longer, it makes sense
---
If that was what they expected (to make "significantly" higher profits from the atom store than game sales), they would have gone free to play from the beginning. The atom store is there to pay for ongoing development and fixes and to keep hosting the servers. What kind of business model would it be to promise people an endless game for a single one-time purchase, without a store? 
---
Consider how many people spent more in the atom store than they spent to buy the game, I didn't come close and I didn't buy the $200 PA edition as many others did (it sold out).
---
Neither does over exaggerating the problem and not having  a form of rebuttal cause you can‚Äôt defend Bethesda.
---
As a point of comparison, how buggy is this compared to Fallout 3. I remember playing 3 years after the game released there were still game breaking bugs destroying my save file. 
---
I guess that makes more sense, I just hope their not abandoning us and fix this mess, soon. 
---
Well, the ticket is still important for things like that, so the ticket still needs to be made even if the team is aware, but as far as making the customer do it, it could have something to do with policy, or it could be to cover their own ass in case a mistake in creating the ticket is made. I do think that they should be able to create one themselves, but I‚Äôd understand if its policy for whatever reason to have a customer create support tickets themselves. I‚Äôve worked jobs that allowed support tickets to be created and that was policy in my work place, and I imagine others have different policies. 
---
Do we have any numbers on the amount of players in the game, and how that has changed? I‚Äôd be interested to see them, though I‚Äôm sure Beth is keeping them under wraps.

There should be a mic icon beside your name when you talk. Did you see that icon on yourself? If not, maybe the game didn‚Äôt register your mic.

Yep! So glad I didnt trade it away on a duped weapon. I know I've got some that have been through the circle but those two black powder rifles....I found.

I don't know, a cheater here would probably also cheat in Doom if possible.

I gave those free beta keys to the friends i wanted to play with, we are all into multiplayer games those guys were more than me and still didnt like the game. Thats telling isnt it?

Happened to me at Morgan town station , same plans

Nah just griefing
---
With that logic they would just go f2p then, same reason as Raebus30 doing that or abandoning the game would probably destroy what little good will Bethesda has to the point people will be hesitant on buying new game titles and have the company close down.
---
I think alot of people from the other fallout sub are here trying to kill the game 
---
That‚Äôs all reddit is is opinions!  Do you really come here to espouse your point of view and disregard all others?  That coupled with glee at something failing just because you didn‚Äôt like the concept is quite telling.  Also, the dude didn‚Äôt even really say anything inflammatory and you came out guns blazing.  I guess the username checks out, so at least you know what you are.
---
OMG. Yes I got a lot of playing time during the Furlough also.   My wife would say too much.  But I did did level up almost 30 levels (70-100) during that time and acquired my first explosive and two shot guns. ( no TSE though)

It had become common for people to have an alt account and just load up a character.  Even though the character couldn't teleport and was encumbered, they could hold infinite weight.  Plus you have an alt standing in your house all the time to transfer goods between toons.
---
I had friends buy 2nd accounts just for these two purposes.  I even considered it myself.  Even limited to 1500# per toon, the alt account is still the best bank space in the game.
---
I know this is young post but it won‚Äôt make the high numbers of clicks compared to a pro Bethesda post
---
Doesn't change my point. You're saying it's better to just ignore something and pretend it doesn't exist rather than to criticize it?
---
So why is that better? 
---
And my comparison is still fully relevant. You're saying to ignore things you don't like, so since most of the world didn't like the Holocaust they all should have just ignored it yeah? Because according to you it's bad to criticize things correct? 
---
Sarcasm?

CMs are a smoke screen. Theyre paid fans. No one gets in to see the wizard.

New plot: The vault dwellers have nuked fissure site prime and thinned out the number of scorched in the area. They've rebuilt some cities and split into factions. Some rebuilding the brotherhood of steel and regularly working to kill the scorched, some building back up the responders in case any refugees come through or vaults open. Some become raiders. One of 76's residents nukes west tek, nuking the deactivated FEV tanks. The reactivated FEV begins infecting scorched. A new army of scorched super mutants emerge led by a moderately intelligent behemoth intent on converting all humans and scorched. The overseer uses emergency protocols to reopen vault 76 so children can be evacuated, enter the next generation of vault dwellers complete with multiple raid bosses, every so often the scorched behemoth attacks the server creating a server event, after being injured to a certain point it retreats (event rewards over corpse) it's still necessary to nuke fissure site prime to deal with the scorched keep them from repopulating too much. Could even somewhat keep characters from this release like what happened with ARR. Something that epic of change could be worth the wait

&gt; Care to elaborate as to why i hear the dupping glitch is back again?
---
One can only speculate about the motives of the people spreading misinformation like this.
---
Literally all I do now is scavenge and try and build cool camps. 
---
I believe the official reasoning was so that multiple players could get caps from them, since containers have loot each time a new person comes across them, vs. being a consumable that people can just take. FWIW, I think the most I've ever gotten from a caps stash was like 30, so they've never been a big part of my planning, just a happy side effect of being in an area. 
---
I hope you dropped this /s
---
I've managed to get by just fine staying with in the carry weight.  But I just vendor so much stuff... lots of 3 star legendaries that just werent worth their weight.  I'm not a trader... not big on dealing with people in that manner.  But I can completely understand why a trader would need more than 1500 pounds...  considering some guns weigh in excess of 30lbs each.
---
But... 16,000 pounds of junk is... flat out excessive.
---
I'm assuming there is actually a maximum ceiling for how high you can boost your starting CND but I don't know how those numbers work. Probably like a 10% range or something?
---
Not learn it, but with a new perk card  added you can have the chance to get a legendary mod from scrapping legendaries. 
---
43 years old and still a virgin I presume?

"Bethesda is laughing"
---
/facepalm
---
Why do people have to always imagine devs like some kind of cartoon villain with a mustache holding sacks with dollar signs on them? They're just fucking humans, alright. They make mistakes. Grow the fuck up with this shit.
---
Feel free to complain about the bugs, and patches, but stop trying to turn Bethesda employees into fucking villains.
---
230+ hours, made 6 chars all about level 60.  First char played for the story, next 5 built different builds to see what was more fun.  At the point i will take a break for a while till new content comes out.
---
Also my job has lots of wait time, and games that i can play to make time go by really keep me sane. 
---
After reading the second one it almost seems like a low key PR stunt, to shift all blame away from Bethesda Studios and put it on Austin, along with still managing hype for Starfield. Though it could just be some guy that works there, but he seems almost too keen on releasing information.
---
Lol.   50% weight management / selling items is about right.  
---
God, that‚Äôs a bad look. 
---
The fact that people have to go to the extremes of having two accounts to act as mule... surely that tells you something. 
---
Automatic Executioner Radium Rifle is my go-to against these Barbarian, Fireproofed, Nerd Raging, Dodgy, Serendipitous, Ricocheting goofballs in their dense Sentinel and/or Bolstering armor who come after me in Hunter vs Hunted. You go ahead and try to tank all these shots while I‚Äôm chucking pumpkin grenades at you, friendo.
---
(I‚Äôm made of paper, tbh, but this works more often than it should)
---
There's bugs in every game and every mmo launch though. And yes fixes take time, especially when you break everything on your first attempt due to lack of knowledge / QA / Ability or whatever it was. 
---
That's a Bethesda problem though not a customer problem, we did our part giving them the money for the product. If the game is that broken and they really can't delay launch then it should have been free to play / beta test not full price aaa game you get that yea?
---
This is just laughable now, its not one thing here and there its everything they touch.
---
At some point Bethesda have to look after there customers otherwise there wont be any more Bethesda games.
---
Yeah, I know some mods give better stats but if I think about whether it's really worth it... very little benefit for what ends up being a weapon that breaks 10% faster.
---
Yes just as I thought. Even your kinda blebber can easily pull 3-8k with some really basic stuff. Full unyelding set, can be even just 1* every piece... Right mutations and some basic bloodied high dmg one shot melee or unarmed and you already there between 3-8k.
---
Indeed, catch you on the other side. 
---
Not that but on Xbox I will sometimes exit the build mode and am only able to move the camera left and right

So far I've tried to get on and play 4 times after the patch and each time the game freezes right after loading into the world. The game freezes not windows. I can signout and log back in to reset. So this is a game problem and it's actually starting to piss me off now.
---
I'm only at 180 hours and played six hours yesterday. Five hours were spent inventory managing, traveling to every single vendor to grab all their caps and doing a little crafting (crafting is something I really enjoy).
---
The last hour was spent doing one event, fighting some mole miners and Scorched and finally having some fun.
---
Despite the five hours of chores, despite tons of scrapping, despite not looting everything, I had to quit playing until later today when vendor caps refresh and I can make the rounds again. My character is standing on the road 200 lbs overencumbered. I'd like to play now but have to wait.
---
So yeah, my game time is spent doing chores. 
---
That would be cool. 
---
Especially as we can sell mods we don't want to people who do want them. 
---
If BGS was banning people for crafting and scrapping I'd be gone a long time ago.
---
In the last 2 weeks I unlocked all mods for levers, handmade and almost all mods for marine (still missing 2). Just yesterday I made around 50 marine pieces. I'm running around and bugging random strangers to buy their rubber and asbestos. 
---
If I didn't get banned, I don't think anyone was "just for crafting".
---
Awww post removed, that‚Äôs cute, it just prove my point that people are talking out of their asses
---
Here‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt believe that. Since it‚Äôs now a actual container, you can take less than the actual amount of what‚Äôs in the container.  
---
Yeah, they should whip the fix out tomorrow, that'll definitely make sure it works.
---
Lolz 
---
Omg #myfeelingsmatter
---
True. It may very well already be the final countdown. The current patch has already started bleeding players more severely than any other period. Even some people who were playing since launch feel the game is in such a state right now that it's gone backwards even further than the launch state, and purely in terms of the grind I agree. The next big patch will decide the foreseeable future of this game for a massive chunk of the player base, me included. If they start to address this direction and turn it around there can be hope. If they double down and continue making everything in the game a job, that bleed is going to start turning into a coma.
---
I almost did but I'm so glad I got her. Twas a drop from a 1* at whitesprings. I don't look down on lower legendary creatures anymore 
---
I feel the same way, but I hope we are both wrong. 
---
Unless they patch that in later to fix it.. I think they intended for that to happen, so people coudn't turn 50 in at at time. I was surprised when I lost a bunch the first time.. then started to see etchnical data litter the ground everytime I logged in
---
&gt;&gt;Bethesda, it is by no mean imaginable acceptable to remove an item previously acquirable in game (red tactical headlamp), change it a bit and making it an Atoms Shop exclusive. This practice must stop now, be reverted, and apologized for. I don't care if it was Zenimax's decision or not, you are the same entity. Those anticonsumer practices must stop.
---
This. It's bad enough Bethesda has cut content from Fallout 4 (which this game is) and then added it to the Atom Shop, to now start removing items previously in game to put in the Atom Shop? 
---
WTF.
---
Oh, sorry, honestly my apologies, I've had some serious hate thrown my way, both on this thread (just a couple) and a few PM's.  
---
Trying to stay positive, and reply in a more neutral way even to those slinging mud, glad I didn't reply caustically.  This proves you can't judge a book by the title (or in your case by the username!)  
---
Yes, I'm going to be a more wary consumer of Bethesda's products in the future, I don't mean that to be a judgement / declaration, just some of the faith has been lost, and there is some egg on my face as I've been a defender of '76 for quite a while.
---
Sold a junkie explosive fully auto to my bud for 776 caps with the right cards it still fun to use 
---
&gt;let me ask you this: "where is your limit ?"
---
I don't know yet. 
---
I mean, don't get me wrong, the tank is running low and I fully understand that you're done. That's all fine.
---
It's good that you're stepping away, as many others have too. Probably good for your mental health.
---
All I'm saying is that the only way we'll see positive change is eternal vigilance. Walking away takes the stress away from you personally but it doesn't improve the game any. 
---
We as players don't have direct control over the development of the game (though some modders are doing a fantastic job picking up the slack, as they always do) so all we can do is give feedback.
---
If we had faith that Bethesda could pull this off on their own steam, we wouldn't have all this fuss and drama in the first place. Since they seem to be lacking, constant pressure in terms of feedback is necessary for those that care enough about the game to want to see it move in the "right" direction (whatever that means).
---
All the best with your break. Hopefully we both get what we want and the game ends up in a good state sometime in the the future :)
---
Ty, the before sale prices lined up with the regular price of similar items already in the shop. So if you took the time to compare the sale items with theirs preexisting counterparts you'd understand where the "sale/ X% off" numbers came from.
---
Cool, sounds like a fun job!
---
I'm a test team lead, formerly business systems analyst and project manager. 
---
All three for sure.  
---
I was going to put a sarcasm tag in it but figured people shouldn‚Äôt need to be told that. 
---
Nope, apparently I give too much credit :)
---
I understand people‚Äôs frustrations, I just don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm in a position to tell BGS how to run their company or how their devs should do things. 
---
I‚Äôll comment and suggest my ideas if I feel they‚Äôre appropriate, but my opinion isn‚Äôt so important that I feel I have to dedicate long winded ‚ÄúBGS do this or else‚Äù posts.
---
Quality of life? You mean it's too hard to remember that every 20 hours it resets? That if you play around the same time every day, or most days, that it should already have reset for you? Maybe on days you have off, you might start earlier.
---
But it's really not that hard to remember. 
---
How much does it cost in total to have an alt account?
---
&gt; Imagine fixing a game and then breaking it at the same time. 
---
Not much programming experience I take it.
---
In the same way, people who still like the game and support Bethesda shouldn't be called "not true fans" either. And I've seen a lot of it today. Apparently enjoying a Fallout game is enough to be a "not true Fallout fan". Simply, it swings both ways. You cannot expect to not get labeled when the other side is getting labeled ever since the game launched.
---
Tedious and unnecessary.
---
 I don't care what you believe. Go look for yourself.
---
Because they chose their setting to fully populate before opening a new server doesn't mean there's lots of players haha
---
About time you responded, but that and you are incorrect.
---
I've had it happen to myself and my teammates on PS4 as well.
---
I was using the default Backspace key and just tried to change it to another key but doesn't seem to have made a difference. I tried with both with Push to Talk on and off and I never see the speaker icon above my own character.
---
Or spent playing between him his mom dad uncle friends etc. Just leaving it logged in whilst he sleeps....
---
c'mon really that short sighted? Just saying ; )
---
It‚Äôs like berating a waiter because the food you ordered is bad. 
---
The waiters doesn‚Äôt prepare it, as long as what you wanted was passed along, they are not at any fault if the cook either 1. Ignored what you wanted on your plate 2. Gave you something completely different than what you ordered
---
You think that post doesn't deserve downvotes?
---
You think that's a valid viewpoint?
---
You think that we as consumers are *entitled* to more and better games in franchises we want, because... Why exactly?
---
Yea killed sbq last weekend didn't even get a drill no leather left leg nothing meh maybe next time till next time my left leg will be cold 
---
Thanks for making this post without resorting to making Todd and other employees out to be some cartoon villain. I agree that this latest patch was a clusterfuck that should never have happened. For the first time, I chose not to play the game last night while I wait for the hotfix. In their statement, they did say they were investigating how the merging of two builds happened, so that it won't happen again. I know we as players want more explanation than that, but I understand a business doesn't really want everything out in the open.
---
Let's hope this is a bit of a wake-up call, and things start going more smoothly from here. Not sure the game's community could withstand another big fuck up.
---
Thank you for your efforts!
---
They're going to do this but only for the pay-to-play players.
---
Hoping you don't mean you are getting rid of how it tells you if you already know a plan/recipe that is actually very helpful.
---
I have heard many people say this but I can't think of a single time in my life when I have found it to be true. Mostly I just find it makes a situation worse. It doesn't matter if I am dealing with the IRS, Microsoft, DMV, my boss, game companies etc it seems like yelling and screaming is massively counterproductive. Very occasionally it can work and people love to publicize those events but they don't talk much about all the time it failed.
---
Thats still only 1/5th to 1/2 of 15k... still waiting
---
Nope doesn't appear to be a mic icon but I also don't see my own name on the PC, don't know if that is a setting or not. 
---
Not unheard of -- this kind of thing can happen.  It's also not the end of the world
---
Same, but I wish they played with me until lvl 50, they both quit after the first day of couple hours and they both played the beta, feel like they wasted $60.
---
the negativity has a functionality which is that bethesda are forced to try to learn from their mistakes, or to stop producing videogames that are dragging the quality of other publishers down. 
---
That sucks, but this is hilarious. 
---
It‚Äôs like Bethesda can‚Äôt figure out how to properly manage anything... lol. 
---
Maybe we want nothing? Maybe we are happy with the game and realize that getting hostile towards Bethesda doesn't get us anything? It can be really simple - some of us are happy with the game and the changes, so we praise those who made it. There's no need for sycophancy or sucking up. I can simply turn your hyperbolic statement the other way and it will be the same bullshit (but I guess you'll like it less, because it doesn't fit your views):
---
&gt;All of the effusive insults for Bethesda seems very sociopathic.  
---
&gt;I wonder what they think they can get by hating.
---
Ok, I have that perk too, so it should be easy.
---
That headlamp is so bright I can't see anything.
---
Yeah I also just ran out of things to keep my attention. I'm glad they're patching stuff, but without new content I don't see how the game will stay alive.
---
Gotta be a hard pass from me dawg.
---
This just seems like a sloppily composed and unproofread message rather than an algorithm. The ticket is likely needed to keep a paper trail and an account of the issue/what steps are being taken to resolve it (if they try to resolve it lmao). It could be two teams they‚Äôre talking about but didn‚Äôt clarify, it could be that they‚Äôre tripping over words by throwing together some stock phrases and not properly editing to make them make sense. 
---
maybe, but I still got a point.
---
You can shoot the Mr. Handy messenger though. No one cares about that one.
---
I agree wholeheartedly. You can still appreciate and enjoy a product while still being able to acknowledge its imperfections and immense room for growth. There have been dozens of examples since release of things that should have absolutely either not been an issue or been handled quite differently. At the same time, I do appreciate much of the work being done on this Reddit with respect to trying to collect feedback and make positive changes, which I think they've done. Have they handled each issue correctly? No, but they tried, and hopefully if they see something isn't working they will try again. 
---
Case in point, this whole issue regarding perk changes and TSE this patch; was it done correctly, and if not, how do they make amends going forward? I hope they consider this. Have they squashed all the issues? Far from it. People are still looking for endgame content that isn't just looped chores. But all the same, there's potential, and I hope Bethesda is actively learning from it. 
---
Thankfully, from what I have read, this game was done by another team and shouldn't reflect on the upcoming ES6. I look forward to that all the same. But if they ever try to do a multiplayer version of one of their genre's or worlds again, I hope they sit down before they even begin the project and consider what worked and what didn't when they gave it a whirl the first time. ESO surely wasn't clean out the gate either by any stretch.
---
So in the end, am I happy with how things started and are going? Not entirely, but there are positive signs alongside the negatives. Will this worry me over ES6? Unlikely. Will I be hesitant to pick up anything outside Bethesda's single player space going forward? Absolutely. I think I can only trust them right now to make single player games.
---
After all, remember Brink? Because that was Bethesda. LOL
---
If they are struggling creating random loot, imagine random dungeons
---
The irony.
---
According to the vocal minority, if you pay 60$ for a triple A game you're not ENTITLED to a good product. No one "forced" you to buy the game guys! Your mistake! LUL
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts
---
Oh well
---
I'm especially looking forward to the patch, to fix the patch, to fix the patch that fixes the hot fix for the latest patch.

\#FalloutPatchInception
---
Hey u/ladydevann
---
Will there be an "Inside the Vault" this week?
---
Yeah I have a person added that was maybe 180 or 190 when I was like 120 or 150 and now they are probably 250+, I think it is a person that they only play F076 and spend ton of hours a day to the point they gain 5 lvls a day or something when it takes me 3 days to get 1 lvl and I'm around 192.
---
I see what you're saying. It won't bother me once I hit level 224,  as long as I haven't moved any special points. Buttercup understands! 
---
My gamer tag is Void Shape. Like my username here, but with a space. I‚Äôll be sure to be online at 3pm est. Thanks!
---
I never bought that game because of the negative reception it got. And I won't be buying it now. I've had enough of the crap and I'm not giving them any more of my "caps".
---
They should change their name to Rockville and hope people mistake their future releases for Rocksteady or Rockstar games.
---
My favorite is "everyone complaining is a TES baby who can't 1 shot things now"
---
I also did a crapload of farming early on to add grenades to make up for not having capable weapons.  Not that it bailed me out of every situation, but if I got cornered I had a chance to wiggle out of it.   I didn‚Äôt start doing the tougher events until lvl 50+ and also invested early in PA to give me more protection. 
---
Yea I think those will still be day ones for me...
---
Bethesda has people working on addressing the issues with the game. Some people are good at their job's; others not so much. 
---
I get over 100 quite often with max cap collector perk
---
Awesome. :D
---
My only recollection of recent Capcom BS was how they handled Street Fighter.
---
I was talking exclusively about Monster Hunter World. There's no loot boxes. There's no paid DLC. It just gets updated with free content.
---
If you're a fan of the Dark Souls style of challenging and rewarding gameplay, it's definitely worth the money. Monster Hunter is massive in Japan and they care deeply about it there. This port to the UK and US shares that sentiment. 
---
Ehhh I don't feel like I should need to write down what time I went to x vendor everytime I do it. Which is the only way I personally would be able to remember. Also not everyone can play around the same time everyday...?
---
This. Exactly this. I see all these posts about how the game has been so bad since release and is literally unplayable... then they go on about how their lvl 215 character has nothing to do anymore. Here's a tip: this is a $60 game that brought you what, 100+ hours of entertainment? It has done it's job. Every game that is released is not meant to be a life-long, endless source of entertainment and joy. 
---
And for God's sake, please stop asking for refunds. You all sound ridiculous. That's like me buying a car and putting 25k miles on it, then taking it back to the dealership and saying I want my money back because I am bored with it. 
---
No worries; just woke up myself. Adding you now
---
I think you're completely missing the point of my comment, which is simply that this quest line ends without affecting anything, and that that's a shame.  It promises traps for scorchbeasts, which would be nice.  That is all.
---
&gt;Hell even WoW has scaled their dungeons so that everyone in between 1-60 can do a dungeon togethor with only the availability of abilities as their difference
---
When did they do that? I don't think I've ever experienced that playing WoW.
---
Insert a thumb up in your ass and sit on it while you wait üê∏ if you don't know how the rest is achieved its probably not my loss. 
---
Workshops. Nuke Zones. Teaming. Events. The game is what you make of it. If you don't find any pleasure in playing it, don't play it.
---
I'm a casual player since day one and I even agree this game is a bag of baby dicks. I've seen the decline in every aspect of the game. Yes there has been good, but there's also been alot more of bad. I don't hate the developers, designers, etc. I hate the marketing team, sharholders and the executives, Todd Howard. *These are the folks who care more about profit than they do the quality of their games.* These are the folks who are destroying reputable game companies.* These are the folks who are destroying the industry.* These folks can put a 45 into their mouths and squeeze the trigger for all I care. Bethesda isn't a bad company. Their leadership is bad. Best solution atm, Fire everyone from the Top and move down till the entire company has been purged of anyone and everyone who doesn't contribute on a positive level to the company. These execs who are fired. Their names need to be spread throughout the entire gaming industry that way no other gaming company hires them and runs the risk of being fucked over like Bethesda. Make them an example of.
---
that's why I said you're not very good at the game. with a proper setup, any bullets "I put in you while you close the imaginary gap" won't matter at all.
---
not to mention bloodied melee is supposed to be stealthy, not charging at someone from a mile away.
---
I think fallout 76 was the first and last preorder I will do. I'll buy games after they've gotten good reviews (or maybe if they go on a huge sale).
---
I'd wager the people hurling around "entitled gamers" aren't conservatives, mate
---
Yeah I have a lvl 10 alt and made a new character just to get the daily lvl up atom challenge since lvl 10-11 is such a grind and don't want to waste anymore time on this game lvling up.
---
270 hours in... I explored everything.  Every single location on that map, and all of the ones I could find that weren't listed.  I've built about 10 camps over the course.  Did every single quest, every single event, killed the SBQ 100+ times (thanks for making all the work meaningless now btw), I've helped others level, cleaned up bounties, earned some bounties, PvPed a bit (it's stupid), read every journal / terminal entry.
---
Basically, everything the game has to offer + just enjoying time with friends in the wasteland.
---
But honestly, we're all kind of out of things to do at this point.  Now that the SBQ isn't worth fighting, we're not sure what do anymore. Sure she CAN be killed, but she doesn't drop anything worth the condition/ammo loss, you can farm legendaries at whitesprings.
---
No, I think it does deserve downvotes. That‚Äôs why I said it doesn‚Äôt. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
We are entitled to it because that is what was marketed to us. It‚Äôs what we paid for. But, it isn‚Äôt what we got. If you like taking a big, wet sloppy shit in your mouth every time you buy something, by all means continue supporting that behaviour. But I‚Äôm not going to do that, because I don‚Äôt want too.
---
Feel free to post again telling me that I‚Äôm wrong. I do love a good giggle.
---
I hadn't heard about starfield, looks interesting. Gonna have to give it a pre-order.
---
So you cant server hop and keep getting the same cap stash over and over
---
Oh. I didn't know they updated it.
---
Having said that though, I don't see what your issue is. Better that it was there from the start, granted, but at least it's there now.
---
Guy gave them all the info, even a fix!
---
Dev team and CM couldn't create a paper trail themselves though? Internally for an issue that is broken down spoon fed to them and fixed for them. 
---
Maybe they outsource and need the paper trail for invoicing? 
---
~~Cool let us know how that goes~~ Bye
---
It‚Äôs a cult classic
---
Well here on reddit this is how you get shit changed in the video game world. Maybe you weren't here last year for the great BattleFront 2 saga. The fallout from that is still being felt in countries across the globe by big AAA publishers üòçüòçüòç
---
Then we're on the same side. 
---
Where we seem to disagree, is maybe the state of the game and what Bethesda should or shouldn't do to fix it. We both agree that it needs changes/fixes and some of those fixes/changes we'd even agree on.
---
Don't conflate or extrapolate arguments that aren't even there. We're all here wanting the best possible version of FO76.
---
Well... yesterday was complicated by some fucking cheats getting what was coming to them... there was much salt from the fucking cheats... but yesterday‚Äôs patch definitely reduced stability, rolled back some needed fixes, and fucked up white knight for no good reason.
---
I wish they would make it so it also skins the environmental suit. That way you can wear the rad suit and have the rocketsuit look.
---
I am hearing 20 hours but I tried to loot them after 30 hours and most of them had nothing.
---
Not ALL plans are for sale... 
---
I can do that. I'll just wait until it's at like 95% off or something.
---
I had the same problem too. 
---
Sorry this is the first time I can say this it literally is the dupers fault if they would have been as rare as they were supposed to be people wouldn't have cried so loud  well that and dumbasses buying them for real money 
---
I know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but I'm a whale biologist 
---
If they did that we‚Äôd spend more time trying to read the whole thing than playing the game.
---
They nerfed TSE weapons too hard. Change my mind.
---
I bought copies for multiple friends thinking this game would be an awesome joint adventure. Womp womp.
---
Interesting 
---
But what happens when they stop quitting and get back to playing?
---
If they‚Äôre gonna be praised for quitting are they gonna be praised for returning ?
---
I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs fair they‚Äôre lauded as heroes when all they really are, are quitters lolz
---
Whether they quit the game bc they‚Äôre angry
---
Or they quit the quitting and get back to playing because you know, they quit 
---
Hence, quitter 
---
I mean it won't even be noticeable at 1st rank anyway
---
Who said you were in the wrong?  I just observed that no-one who has ever been a programmer would be surprised about bugs being introduced by bugfixes.
---
I wonder how hard it would be to implement. Unspending all your special points without losing track of them, or duping them seems to be a tall order for this dev team. 
---
Sorry, [PS4].  But I really appreciate the offer.  I went ahead and sold everything before it rotted.
---
We SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO need player vendor shops.
---
I think, Bethesda have a right to censor the forums that they host. However, NO censorship should happen here on Reddit, an independent forum. The "Time for New Leadership" thread here should never have been deleted. Locked, maybe, but not deleted. Because OP is right--Bethesda must be held accountable for promises broken and for delivering a software product that is not yet acceptable to many customers.
---
Crashing is failure. I am a programmer, and there is nothing quite like the empty void that opens in your stomach when you find out your .exe crashed on someone. It is not okay. CTD should be extremely rare. Server crash should be extremely rare. In FO76, these are too-frequent experiences (not common, just too frequent), and the software appears to be in need of so much low-level bug fixing that it seems to perform like pre-release software.
---
TL;DR, FO76 was not a minimum viable product--it was below minimum and had not yet reached viable status.
---
I think, it will get there and be fun for many more people if they keep working on it. I don't want Bethesda to give up. Hotfixing the accidental rollbacks is a very good move. Thank you for the quick response, Bethesda!
---
White knighting fans help no one. It's just a mutated form of giving Bethesda a participation trophy. BGS will not get better if they are not given fair constructive criticism, and they will not get better if they are not rewarded with increased player engagement when they do make positive improvements. There has to be a reward for fixing things. That is why I am hanging on and will start playing (and recommending it to friends) after FO76 reaches a pretty good (IMO) software state.
---
"Pretty good" means to me that the servers don't crash and I don't get DC very often and there is more to do in game than get locked into a cycle of grinding for mats to fix equipment so that it works just long enough to grind for mats to fix the equipment again from the decay that occurred during the latest mat grind. What kind of "game" is that, lol? I just want to build a cool C.A.M.P. that doesn't get griefed, and I want to explore and do quests and not get PvP killed while I'm in passive mode.
---
I'll be getting both just won't be preordering either. Hopefully can pick them up at half price 2 weeks after there released üòÇ
---
Lol! Seriously? Who said write down? 
---
You seriously can‚Äôt just remember? Put a little effort into the game? 
---
Sorry, you aren‚Äôt asking for QoL. That‚Äôs just being lazy. 
---
Now give me all the excuses and reasons or whatever you have being able to remember. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be done medical condition or learning disability. 
---
put it in your stash and it loses the icon.
---
Put back in your inventory still doesn't have the icon.  Have to deploy it and put it back in inventory then it gets the atom icon again.
---
He said to prioritise yourself and your family is selfish and that all employees are personally responsible for the morals of their employer. With insults thrown in too. Reddit archives itself so I‚Äôm sure someone can link you the undeleted comment.
---
Dammit!
---
Weird if the vampire 10mm is an auto pistol I would of figured it counted. Maybe its bugged?
---
Inventory management has been the lion's share of my over 500hrs of playing.  Next is farming mats to fix my stuff.  Somewhere between that some fun has been had.
---
Yeah it's the teeny, tiny, extremely small details that make or break a game
---
Actually most problems in history are solved by people that actually do the hard work to come up with a workable solution and then work to implement it. Yelling and complaining does almost nothing because it does not solve the problem and people in power usually ignore it.
---
I hope so. I've been hopeful since the beginning that they'll keep their word and keep adding to the game and fixing things that break. Until then, we're taking a break. :)
---
Sounds good, I'll take a look at it, thanks.
---
Grassroots man! What could possibly go wrong?
---
My friends convinced me to buy this game and then all left me 2 weeks later... meanwhile I've been playing every day since release up until recently. 
---
Wish I never got this game and wasted so much time grinding.  I should of bought Red Dead..
---
Completely agree. Bungie=Bethesda
---
I guess you‚Äôre right, sorry for misunderstanding. You‚Äôre correct, I don‚Äôt know how programming works, but I do know that it shouldn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out how to not reintroduce old bugs that were fixed. 
---
Good points but Bethesda made one of the best games ever, Where‚Äôs Waldo for the NES.
---
I play with friends, rp, take down sbq's, build exciting new camps, find every scrap of story ive missed, adopt noobs, and just explore in general. And theres still so much for me to find. I haven't found much of the Mire yet. 
---
I thought the White Knight nerf was pretty amusing.
---
I wonder how many people screaming for a TSE nerf got punched in the stomach with the White Knight nerf?.... LOL.
---
Karma is such a beautiful thing.
---
But also believing liars doesn't help the game either.
---
Goong for the insult when you can‚Äôt answer, classic :-)
---
This game is less than a third of Fallout 4.  Not a third of what fallout 4 was, i mean a direct 33% of fallout 4 was used to make fallout 76 and the rest thrown out.
---
The amount of effort put into this game is disgustinf, pathetic, and pitiful.
---
\*shrug\*  
---
Click on the link's I've included, see if you think that much work would be put into a post for karma farming.
---
I've got mirrors of most of the posts on BethNet as well, and there is no Karma there.

---
For me personally, the how: You find yourself with a lot of free time when you're jobless.
---
As for the what: My ~450ish hours are divided between 4 different characters. Exploring and immersing myself on my first character. Then every subsequent character I made, I set out with the specific goal of specializing them to use certain weapons, and building their SPECIAL points + perk load-outs to fit the different play styles each one would focus on as a result.
---
For me personally, I've found that having multiple characters is a great way to change up your play style. It's a great way to get around the barrier of having to level up any single character 20+ levels if you ever wanted to switch from one build to another. The only downside is having to level newer characters from scratch, having to farm scrap/weapons/etc.
---
In the end though, with the current state of the end game, you have to find ways to make your own fun.
---
Not much, too much damage I am afraid. They can start and offer full refunds to anyone that wants them without question. Doubt I will be buying a game from them anytime soon including Fallout 5 if it ever comes out.
---
Oh.... they would. This is gamers you're talking about. Just look at any of the other Early Access and Beta ongoing games' forums and replies on social media.
---
Uhmm...no? So every war ever never solved anything? Every coup, protest, revolution, assassination, peoples army etc didn't solve anything? World war 1 and 2 didn't solve anything that was just a dude or two in a backroom? I'm a history major so I know my stuff thanks. Yelling and complaining does everything because it adds huge pressure and the people in power almost never ignore it and if they do they dont last long in power. 
---
Recent example: French people staged massive protest. French government aka people in power made changes and gave said protestors a lot of what they wanted. Case closed. 
---
Something has changed. But for me it seems to always go for the head. Which is fine by me. 
---
Just release this game to the modding community and let us have private servers so we can fix this hot garbage ourselves, as you Bethesda clearly can't.
---
Also I am officially done with any further Bethesda products. After this cash grab disaster of a game and all the truly heinous micro-transactions and merch, you do not deserve anyone buying any of your products henceforth.
---
I still absolutely wreck any mele or gunner builds with a tse sniper üòÇ y'all can't even find me before your dead üòÇ
---
Lol Bugthedsa. It probably triggered a bunch of fanboys who reported it and got it flagged by the automod. 
---
&gt; Did anyone ever expect Bethesda to become like this?  
---
Like everyone? Multiple times? Since day 1?
---
Funny you talk about ignorance yet you fail to see that this is not a fight about whether Bethesda changed but it is a fight whether Bethesda should change. And that is the reason why "fanboys" fail to connect with "crybabies". Because both are partially wrong and both are partially right. And then they piss the other one off by saying things that are just not true.
---
But is is fun to watch you guys :D
---
(PS.: Yes. Blizzard changed. On the other hand also expected.)
---
I agree. Mods need to organize the complaint posts into a single thread or something. This subreddit is very active, but every post is saying the same thing. It's exhausting and a waste of space. We all can acknowledge the game is flawed and needs fixing, but is that ALL we have to post about? 
---
Is this from hitting the craft button really quickly?   Yesterday I was making some boiled water and I was hitting the button as fast as I could.  Afterwards I could have sworn I had more boiled water than I was supposed to.  The cooking interface never updated a change in quantity remaining to craft with while I was doing that.  I think that it would update before the last patch.
---
I play with a guy I met on Reddit in talking about that game. We‚Äôve become fast friends and laugh and laugh and are quite a menacing duo. 
---
We were near in levels. He‚Äôs like 105
---
Mind and I‚Äôm 25 lol
---
He‚Äôs my body guard. 
---
Me too. Doesn't work well either, unfortunately, and that is before The Patch.
---
thanks for the advice there, intolerant username  man. 
---
I want everything fixed, and issues should be voted to the top, but not with vitriol, insults, or "i'm quitting" or "I'm innocent but got banned", that shit can gtfo it helps no one.
---
Why don't you just quit and leave already? Please reply if you disagree so I can add you to my block list and then ensure that I never have to read your bullshit whiny threads anymore. Thanks.
---
I've spent 19 working weeks playing a game I hate. I have no self control to move onto another game. I was forced to play all those hours. You suck, I demand recompense!!!
---
Yes we are finishing up the publication process for it. We hope to have it published soon!
---
100%
---
Or are you one of those people that consider replies "caring" about something one way or another?  
---
I'd wager it also puts pressure on other game companies to NOT make the same mistakes because they see people are obviously fed up with it. If everyone just silently took whatever bullshit they gave us, nothing would be fixed and things like lootboxes and MTX would be worse than they already are. 
---
It's just as fun when you kill them at Whitesprings and they slam through the floor.  You can sometimes see them, under the house, out of reach.
---
Let's see:
---
Cap's reset 20 hours after your purchase.
---
I play at 2 PM, then 7 PM the next day, then 2 PM the day after.
---
I cannot sell to vendor on day 3 as it has not been 20 hours.
---
Caps reset at noon every day.
---
I play at 2 PM, then 7 PM the next day, then 2 PM again the next.
---
I can sell to vendor all 3 times.
---
Get it?
---
Hi all,   
---
We do have a new Mothman Power Armor set on the way that we think is going to be an awesome addition to the game! However, when we modified the Red Tactical Headlamp to build on this Power Armor set‚Äôs theme, it had unintended side effects for loose mod headlamps that were already in the game. We‚Äôre investigating this now, and will let you know once we‚Äôre ready to roll out a fix. In the meantime, you can still purchase the loose mod for this headlamp from the Enclave Vendor.   
---
Thank you for reporting this to us!
---
After I got use to it I actually thought it was awesome! 
---
&gt; Didn't Capcom do some shady stuff recently as well?
---
Yeah, they oversimplified Monster Hunter and turned it into a game for filthy casuals.
---
If we are at the topic what about the phantom mutations you get when mutating and dying?
---
Their effects are not working and only showing up while surpressed and theres no way to activate them except curing them with rad away. I wasted 4000 caps on speed demon for nothing.
---
If you still play this game you are part of the problem... everyone needs to stop for a month to make a statement that we are tired of their BS
---
Except they haven't? The low level devs have sure but Bethesda as a company and the upper management have just been embroiled in one controversy (and in some cases near legal cases) after another. 
---
You sure it isn‚Äôt 99.99%?
---
Give it time. Within a few months the game will be much more stable and enjoyable and will probably have some DLC. Maybe you and your friends can find fun in 76 yet.
---
lol respect the honesty
---
I‚Äôm looking for the brick walls . I started a new character and can‚Äôt find them in HF or WAtago . 
---
Ok so you've never pvp'd. 
---
Got it. 
---
How you gonna hold a workbench? Limited spawn points, people know where you are. Stay in the green circle and dont get shot, hows that work?  You gotta break gaps to GET to snipers. 
---
Sounda like your spending way too much time hiding in bathrooms and closets waiting for your pvp enemy to come to you.  Fun build bro. 
---
Your obviously a butt hurt gunner brigading this thread with nonsense. 
---
Uhm, yeah-nah. You're totally missing what I'm saying. The example he used didn't say what he claimed it said. 
---
Whoah, whoah woah. 
---
Wait.
---
Mothman  power armor you mean?   
---
The mothman flies doesn't he?    
---
This mothman power armor had better not come equipped with a goddamned jet pack. 
---
If so, then there's the answer to why finding a jetpack is so ridiculously difficult: they wanna force you into spending money in that fucking atom shop.
---
That had better not be the reason why.
---
Thanks for the reply. I look forward to these each week, even if they are a little sparse sometimes. It's nice to see these little snapshots into development.
---
Enjoy the game, hate the company. Thats why i wont be buying atoms.
---
So more stealth nerfs. Imagine my shock. 
---
This guy gets it bravo friend üëçüèª The only reason we don'r have lootboxes as much anymore is because everyone threw a giant negative fit over Battlefront 2. 
---
Realese the new Elder Scrolls and it be better than oblivion and skyrim.
---
Ouch. Not even a new controller.
---
That's your prerogative. 
---
GOTY editions are the way to go anyway.  FO3/NV/FO4 with all the DLC and shit?  absolutely worth the wait.
---
I own them (purchased one of the "Mini-Nukes" off ebay for a song and it turned out the codes were still good) but not booted them up, kind of afraid I'll loose a few months in them!
---
Highly irrelevant but ok Billy. 
---
THANK YOU for both noticing user feedback and responding!    
---
Glad to know that. Still don't think it apports anything to the discussion tho.
---
Blush
---
I do risk assessments IRL. Folks say 1 thing but do another. Lolz
---
Thanks for your post üëç
---
Why should I stop playing a game I enjoy?
---
Not a single thing. They fucked up big time and don't even admit that they're wrong
---
Yeah but it's broken currently!
---
What about the atoms i earned in game?
---
I'm saying move on, clearly fo76 isn't for you. What do you know about the background on development or their plans for the future? The game was made by the former Battle Cry Studios, not the same team as the elder scrolls or fo3 or fo4. They plan on making this game evolve over the next 10 years, with private mod servers so the sky is the limit for what this game can be. Min/maxers getting butt hurt over explosives not doing as much damage or that their duped items got them banned are overly vocal saying things like "this game is dead" are toxic, and hardly productive and very likely wont stick around until the game is better. Be constructive with your ideas, because that's who will get listened to.  Ever notice how the civil people are being listened to? Now we can see if plans are known because the people making those kind of constructive suggestions are not damaging the over all operation. 
---
Brb, gotta buy some atoms
---
Your talking point criticisms are wrong and are going to push the game into being an elitist circlejerk with a metagamed black market, like every other game you tryhards get your claws into. Fuck off.
---
That's normal.
---
What are they trading at today?
---
I get in to a degree, when it's somebody who has invested a lo of time into the game. 
---
Yesterday it was some troll who has never played the game asking players why they still play. 
---
it's 60% of 20% now, so really it's 5 points for 12% where it used to be 100%.
---
The only work you're doing is shouting at underdogs in between the periods where your mom brings you your chicken tenders.
---
So here goes my 5 cent. 
---
Sorry in advance for my poor english.
---
I like the game. I played the main story, but then I stopped.
---
I found some people to play with, but the social functions didn't ... well... function and thus I never found the nice people I've met again. 
---
Most people I met in the wasteland have either been inconsequential or worse, a harrasment and since people don't want to play with their mics open or hear other people watching porn in the background you cannot communicate with anything but hand signs. 
---
The game has mechanisms that wants you to loot, but you cannot hoard that loot anywhere. 
---
It wants you to be creative and built, but you cannot built what you want.
---
It tries a new take on RPG's with the card system, but it ends up being you sifting through your deck everytime you want to craft, trade or build.
---
And lastly there is nothing to keep playing for after the main story except interaction with other players, but that interaction is stunted because of bugs (and wether you like their solution to MP stuff, by the PvP, trade and communicationssystem).
---
I think the concept of Fallout76 is awesome. I have had 120 hours of fun (mostly) but I had them alone (mostly). But what I hoped for was an immersive MMORPG in the Fallout universe with meaningful interaction and where your actions as a character meant somehing. 
---
I know I hoped for too much. I am not here to complain. The problems in the game are real, I still see hope for the game, Bethesda and the franchise. 
---
What I need now is a reason to go back in-game and unless Bethesda adress atleast some game-play paradoxes and give me something meaningful to do other than grinding for better gear, I have had the fun I could get from this game.
---
I am not a fan of Bethesda per se, nor do I see myself running around yelling at clouds. I just hope that somebody at the developer team eventually figures out to solve some of the problems or add some more content, because I would love to have a reason throw away my pastime in West Virginia yet again.
---
TL;DR I stopped playing because there is nothing to do but grind after the main story.
---
I‚Äôve seen a couple threads where people are finding the heavy combat in Grafton at the responder bot. 
---
Canada?
---
They were explained as "Vault Raids" in a comment one of the CM's made on another post. Whatever that entails. 
---
with incapable you mean you wanna be a overpowered df, right? you want one shoot kills and dont want do anything and be on lvl100 in the first hour, right? this game is fine right now. nothing to pule about.
---
The game just needs a bunch of work. Bug fixes, balances and content. The day before Patch 5, my buddy and I were roaming Whitesprings because we didn't have anything else to do. I've leveled multiple characters to 50+, tried out different builds, killed the Queen, completed the quests, done events, etc. 
---
At this point I'm just taking a break and playing some Game Pass games until the next big content release that isn't just the same game rehashed without PvP restrictions. 
---
Thank you for this. I have been feeling blue about my rifle build being weakened..... now I am all smiles. 
---
see you in a few months in Appalachia !
---
I always just craft 5 things at a time so I don't waste mats.  I guess if you didn't have any of the mods though I would craft more.
---
OMG this could be super fun!
---
During black friday. And then it went back up.  It's down again now, even lower, but game is a couple months old.
---
So... This change would affect you in any way shape or form in either direction...
---
But you're still against it, because...
---
You just hate change?
---
You don't see a point because it doesn't personally affect *you*?
---
That's... Kinda sad, friend.
---
Who are you?
---
Just dumped all my junk and caps to some low level dwellers, see ya when there's more content.
---
It's sad he's one of the more (maybe most) prominent YT voices when it comes to Fallout. All the best content on 76 gets buried beneath this collection of... just... uninspired people. 
---
Those are free. I don't know if they consider that sold product.
---
This happens every now and then with my PA torso, sometimes even when I climb into my PA the torso will just unequip.
---
The repetition of burning through all my ammunition whilst simultaneously destroying my weapon just isn't fun. I'm okay with repairing it from time to time and needing to craft ammunition, but the monotonous micromanaging makes me feel like I'm playing The Sims. Though it could definitely have benefitting from being toned down a bit, TSEs (or any weapon with similar damage output) serve a purpose. Before saving up enough to get my TSE, the game had plateaued for me. Weight restrictions made it so I was only carrying two weapons at most, so when my primary routinely broke I was without a paddle. I'm sure there's a happy middle somewhere, but I feel we've gone even further from it with the latest patch.
---
Well I see. hate the man that's responsible for absolutely nothing except try to give you updated news. Because I'm sure he knew all these bugs were going to happen before de p.k loyment. You guys make no sense sometimes.
---
No gunners allowed!
---
Check Charleston.  I know I saw them somewhere last night.  I know I only hit up both Watoga ones and Charleston when I was playing
---
why?
---
Nope, 100%...
---
You on the other hand seem very concerned with how people spend their own money.
---
Maybe not the type of thing to concern yourself with
---
Good idea
---
Gamers Rise Up!
---
I enjoy the game, but there's so many obvious issues. They not only address these issues with boilerplate bs, but then they release a patch that rolls back previous fixes and introduces other bugs. How is this even possible for a huge publisher? It's seriously like they're trying to fuck it up.
---
Bethesda has been given so much good will and patience with this and they constantly blow it. As soon as the issues we're obvious on Tuesday, the patch should have been rolled back. And then they announce a full PvP mode? Fix the freaking game first, then add to it.
---
cool story. tell me more about how video games are hard work.
---
I work client relations for a hospital software company. As a rule, we ALWAYS ask that a support ticket be created by the client. I get issues escalated to me directly all the time, but a proper ticket, logged by the client, is always needed. It's vital for issue tracking, time logged (by devs, QA, etc.), reporting... the list goes on and on. This is standard procedure. It doesn't mean the community staff are lazy or failing to report the issue. It's just a needed formality.
---
Well you should probably finish reading it because your assumption as to what the rest of it says is totally completely wrong. 
---
I understand you probably don't like the game. But that doesn't mean you should hate on people who do like the game. 
---
Thanks for sharing that means i wont play this game until its fixed. Too much shit i paid caps for. 
---
Don't let umoms catch you stealing her CC lol! üòÇü§£
---
Saves me a lot of time. Love it. No more scrolling to the limbs or head when bring swarmed.
---
It could though. There‚Äôs no reason for it not to work that way.
---
And I was being sarcastic. I DO believe it should happen, but I know that it won‚Äôt.
---
Lol yeah I'm definitely buying elder scrolls 6. Probably going to pre order it too
---
I only said such a low price because they changed the way cards work without letting anyone know beforehand. I'm not even going to get into the whole "Nerfs are bad!", but changing several levels worth of card and perk choices should be reimbursed in some way.
---
That, or just release private servers already and let the modders fix it just like they have every other Fallout game. Bugs are part of the Fallout franchise(People are still doing bugfixes on fallout 1 and readding quests that were broken or removed), but the lack of an online component has previously meant that modders were free to fix it.
---
Damn I wasnt going to go there.
---
marine is either Watoga station or Phoenix. I think one of them carries casual as well.
---
I‚Äôll check thanx 
---
The same people working on atom shop items probably aren‚Äôt fixing bugs 
---
Shill is a strong word. 
---
I'm mad about a patch that actually rolled bugs back into the game.
---
   I don't have a TSE to be passed off about.
---
I paid $75 pre-order for the next iteration of a game I've love since fallout 1. I'm used to bugs. 
---
This train wreck goes above and beyond anything Bethesda has done before.
---
Get it if it goes on sale. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
---
Don't know squat about Starfield, but I will be pre-ordering ES6 AND putting in for a week's paid vacation from work. 
---
(Literally shoots the messenger)
---
Ok listen here you little shit
---
Ha, yeah a CM somewhere said the devs would look into it. It's kinda dumb, maybe take the parts out add another mod recipe drop in but then again, I would be pissed to get two ultracite explosive vents off the queen.
---
Well... I didnt call you an idiot but you are in the minority at the moment. The majority are upset with Bethesda.
---
'cos I don't much like the idea of doing the exploration/story part of the game coop -- being forced to wait while someone examines things, or being hurried on when you want to take your time.
---
You mean given over to Microsoft... Let that sink in.
---
How though?
---
LMAO, fuck no
---
/r/buttcoin is leaking
---
The only reason they are wasting space in my stash - the hopes of one day displaying them and/or magazines like in FO4.
---
If they would ever definitively say we'll never get that option, I will purge a good chunk of weight from my stash
---
I disagree with the core basis of the OP. All the points made, I disagree. Didn't mean to break up the circlejerk. 
---
No npcs remember? Who would be commentating? Wooby?
---
Yall deserve it at this with the hivemind early on in this sub
---
Really, at the station?  I hadn't even looked for it there.
---
I have done SBQ, but only once, and didn't get that type of loot.  But then, we all know how the loot system is reliable!
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
You're getting downvoted because you are 'eating this shit up'. And watching it with glee. You didn't need to say all that. Your last paraghraph would have sufficed just fine all on its own.
---
Fyre festival acted more responsibly than Bethesda.  
---
And fyre festival was a disaster.
---
The minority based on what metric? People ranting on reddit?
---
Bethesda is really incompetent. They have no clue how to run a multiplayer game. none zero and it shows.   
---
Fix the damn blueprints where i can blueprint my house  
---
Fix the damn camp budget so I can actually build a base (or lower budget cost of some items that take up way way way to much budget)
---
I still don't get how duplicating camp blueprint is a bad thing that should be part of the game.  
---
Pre recorded shit like on holotapes
---
I know this game is a buggy mess with one thousand things wrong with it and one thousand and one ways it could be better so I have no intention of defending Bethesda. 
---
But what I'm sick of is the constant complaining. There's barely any discussion about the game that isn't about the latest terrible thing. The last patch had a lot of good things in it but all these people just cried and cried about nerfs that everyone saw coming a mile away.
---
There's constructive criticism and there's whining. We're seeing too much of the latter.
---
 I only said such a low price because they changed the way cards work without letting anyone know beforehand, and with 200 caps max on vendors, and a 25k cap on players you can't make it too large or it's as pointless as the  current system.
---
 I'm not even going to get into the whole "Nerfs are bad!", but changing several levels worth of card and perk choices should be reimbursed in some way.
---
I have over 500 games on my steam account, the vast majority of which are completely offline games. If I get on CS Go and do some cheating, you think I should lose access to my entire steam account? 
---
There‚Äôs 7 vendor factions. 
---
That's because one of the control rods for it goes in your butt.
---
Ill decide. Make me leave üòä
---
what region are you? I played with a guy from Africa for a while and I could never join his world, the servers were always full.
---
the US servers are pretty dead.
---
I feel the same. People complaining about a game that was worth spending 600+ hours so far seems a bit weird to me. See u in Appalachia, mate :)
---
Currently i don't like it as my muscle memory is always vats button &gt; left to target the head.
---
Now that rotates me through parts iteratively.
---
The more i think about it the more I'd like to not have it. 
---
Sometimes i want to blast that dudes head off then cripple the leg of the next guy and i can't do it quickly now
---
&gt; I do know that it shouldn‚Äôt take a genius to figure out how to not reintroduce old bugs that were fixed. 
---
Actually that's one of the most common things to happen when bugs are fixed or improvements are made -- that's why we have a special word for it -- "regression".
---
That doesn‚Äôt support your argument. 
---
I've fought the SBQ three times, my first time the game didnt think I was apart of the event even though I had the quest and I was dealing damage the the queen and when she died I got no loot from her.
---
The second time, everything was fine, got shit loot though.
---
The third time, after about a minute or two in she decided to stop taking damage entirely, so me and a ton of other people wasted a ton of stimpacks ammo ran away and armor/weapon conditions and time fighting a glitched SBQ.
---
I've been running into this issue a lot, trying to build the excavator power armor. I'm trying to build the right leg and I have the materials but it says I can't build it because I don't have the materials. For the Torso I'm short two rubber and I have 10 bulk Rubber and it's not registering. I've gone around and scrapped all my junk at the tables, at this point I've just got to restart and see what happens
---
I'm sure some people will be skeptical, but the damage is done as far as I'm concerned.
---
I'm worried about playing this game now. I'm worried that something I see as legitimate - for example gathering up a hundred some pounds of water, boiling it, then making a shedload of cornsoup as I do everytime I login - could get me banned.
---
That's not a good place for a player to be. My faith is shaken, I shouldn't have to worry that I could get banned for playing normally. If they don't want us mass crafting stuff then we need to know this asap so we can be in compliance with these new rules.
---
Magic
---
I've played these kinds of games before and I can see where Bethesda is going with this. It's a classic skinner box. They are playing into humans addictive nature. The goal is to make the game grindy enough to keep you clicking.
---
Look at Whitesprings.......it's a classic slot machine. Everytime a nuke launches the junkies line up for a spin at the wheel. Bethesda's job is to give you enough rewards to keep you coming back but not enough that you leave.
---
Most video games have these mechanics in place. Some are just more tacky about the way they go about it.
---
Woo! Bethesdas great, and I support their endeavours, even if they make bad decisios every now and then.
---
If its not for Fo76 im hoping its for a Fallout 5. And it better be a fucking amazing game. Cant wait to enjoy the Fallout world by myself again. 
---
Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate. It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
---
It's a bug that could have been detected and fixed by simply booting up the game and checking to make sure that it works the way they wanted it to
---
Well, usually the problems games have aren't because the devs are shitty, it's because the management tried to get them to do some shit that could not be done on time, that kind of thing.
---
This last fuckup where they patched the game backwards? Yeah, that's probably on the devs. 
---
The overall problems with the game? That's on bad management.
---
I see that they can fix the game, they just havent.
---
Kept you waiting, huh?
---
Not really
---
For the first time in a while I haven't played today/yesterday. I doubt I'm the only one. How many people are on a server? 24 or something? So technically all there would need to be is 23 other players playing to have a full server.
---
We don't care that you critique the game and studio, but do it in a way that isn't whiney and entitled. Stop with the dramatic soapboxing. What's absolutely obscene is the tantrums these supposed adults throwing over the state of a 60 dollar video game. A game that most of us still like and you're ruining with your toxic vitriol. Maybe they are mismanaging this game into oblivion, so be bummed about it, then grow the fuck up and move the fuck on. Bethesda has guys on he ground reaching out and trying to listen to feed back and not one day goes by without a dozen people screaming into the microphone. You think that's helping?
---
If I read the files correctly, no. While they might appear as Atomic Shop items, they do not have any conditions attached to them. It is only the red tactical headlamps (for all types of PA) that got this condition.
---
About tree fitty.
---
How about a refund? 
---
Really don't know..
---
To be fair a lot of the people are from other studios that made AAA MMOs star trek online is one 
---
And I'm assuming that people up high at BGS Austin assured the higher ups at Bethesda that they could do it not thinking/realizing the problems and issues that could/would happen
---
Wasn't people talk about the possibility of gamestop shutting down a couple of months ago? never looked into the talk but I assume it was financial  trouble since physical sells of games have dropped.
---
And what happen to the talking point that bethesda decides what sales stores give? you really think they would let this fly if that was true?
---
To be honest there IS a lot of that going around. I see quite a few people running around trying to kill things with their TSEs and failing miserably. I feel bad for them so I jump in and melee everything to death for them
---
No you aren't
---
Yeah hence the deleted comments. Sometimes even morons realise when they‚Äôre being a dick. No idea regarding the karma on deleted comments
---
They don't consider it a problem if it slows progression.
---
Worst case? Reset to level 1, remove all perks and cards, and set the xp to whatever it was prior to respec. Or even charge a % of XP and call it respec trauma or something on top of a cap cost. I'd gladly pay a few levels worth of XP to just have everything reset to level 1 and let me remake all the choices.
---
That's not legal. If you didnt break the terms of service on the other games that you paid for then they cant deny you access.... I smell a class action lawsuit.
---
People sell items after the SBQ event. I don‚Äôt know how long they remain in the vendor inventory or how many.  
---
It‚Äôs kind of a rip off but if u need just one it can fairly helpful. 
---
Also check the Phoenix vendor in Watoga as well, he‚Äôll have some good finds at times, too.
---
TSE for shitty weapons can't even 20 shot some stuff.
---
They would never give the game to obsidian... Not to mention the fact that obsidian probably wants to stay as far away as possible from this game. 
---
Gotta say that I love your approach to the game. 
---
Hopefully release of new content will add a spark, but there's no issue with playing a game thoroughly and moving on. I should have dropped FO4 long before I stopped playing it. 
---
It was addictive though. 
---
" it just works"
---
Yup.  "Nerf" is gaming community lingo for weakening an aspect of a game.  If you take a regular gun (deadly) and turn it into a Nerf Gun (super safe), you're taking a lot of power away from that gun.  Hence the term, "Nerf".
---
Hardened, severe, Suppressor, aligned long, precise, piercing, and short night vision 
---
All those hours...that God-forsaken event...
---
Nothing. It's too far gone. Even for Starfield and TES:VI, Bethesda games have been relegated to ones I will observe and then pick up in the first post-release seasonal sale. It doesn't matter how good those games turn out to be I will not be a first-wave customer for any of their new releases.
---
How many servers are there? How many people are playing?
---
Or just have a running commentary of current events that are major or funny. Everyone hears the same commentary so not everything said would be about your character.
---
Cool story, didn't come on to reddit to argue. 
---
Hey.....at least you aren‚Äôt being chased by a crocodile through a bug-creature-infested secret botanical gardens research lab. üòâüòò
---
I said the idea in itself of a high micromanagement game isn't bad at all. It actually gives that vibe of a true survival. The problem relays in that it isn't implemented in a fun way but rather a unrealistic, shallow and annoying way. :/ btw I like how I wrote this, sorry for the tag but u/LadyDevann I think it would greatly improve gameplay if the team makes some changes to make the system less annoying but with severe consequences if you don't care about it :)
---
I just killed her twice. Two UA parts, two explosive vents...
---
I think I should change my name to "isuckbethesdacock". I'll probably get better reception from you corporate bootlickers lol!
---
haha....
---
I really need to finish the pending updates for some of the Fallout 4 mods I work on (play 4?)
---
I have a feeling they made a ton of money of fallout shelter though. It's not a full release but if Kanomi gave up on full games for micro transactions then I just have a feeling they are quite profitable.
---
So he‚Äôs still breaking the rules chances are most of those friends are filers and he‚Äôs making for them, so technically not dumping himself but just as bad imo 
---
Hmm, apparently you don't read very well. 
---
Taken from the post you're talking about: "Anyway, I'm not gonna descend into believing/endorsing that this is how it is." Also, "Which isn't to make the insane claim or implication that people can't get fed up and leave of their own volition". Protip: When someone writes "which isn't to make the claim", that means they're not making the claim.
---
And not only is your reading comprehension off, you decided to put a strawman argument into quotations as though I wrote anything remotely stating that Bethesda didn't do anything wrong. I never discussed whether there were problems, only the degree of reaction and the sudden change in the sub's restraint. I also never mentioned dupers... not even a little.
---
Please take a moment to brush yourself off, pick yourself up, and stop not only misreading people, but presenting false statements/viewpoints for them. xD  I mean, for a good who seems to have shit his pants over someone speculating loosely with caveats and clarifications, you seem to be OK with the massively upvoted posts that have zero evidence to sustain the completely unreserved statements being made. 
---
lol, sir. Just lol. 
---
They are too busy working on actual good games.
---
Happens to me a lot, sometimes will crash my game completely and kick me back out to the Xbox dashboard.
---
I think I'm around 500 hours and there is still so much to do. Lots on the map to still discover. Lots of treasure maps and supply requisitions in my inventory. Want to try to do every event once including dailies. Still want to nuke some different spots on the map. I like helping people in the wasteland. Want to take every workshop at least once. I think I'm probably good for another 500 just reading my list I typed.
---
Yes I am! Even as I type this!
---
The root problem is that the engine waa never designed for multiplayer and they are trying to paper over the cracks to make it airtight.
---
I meant like a real one. Like they released the Skill bobbleheads for 76 but those are eh to me.
---
It's possible that they setup a system to auto-ban people who craft items too quickly, but then completely forgot about perks like super duper that can double what you craft.
---
So maybe legitimate players are sometimes getting banned when super duper proc's.
---
This. Exactly this. And it's sad that it's so down here.
---
Being critical of Bethesda and pointing out how bad job they did with the game launch is not hating. BUT claiming how the devs are lazy and deserve to be fired is unacceptable. There are so many factors that play in software dev, even more in game dev, so unless you have insight into Bethesda, you are basically insulting people on the whim. Also, being critical isn't exclusive with pointing out the good. Bethesda has delivered several good patches so far. Suddenly, when single patch is slightly worse, the good patches are missing from the narrative of the "critical" people.
---
On the other hand, enjoying the game isn't sycophancy, asslicking, shillling (or any other fancy name the morons invent to discredit the people who don't fit their narrative). Enjoying the game is simply having fun. Why should there be some deep meaning to it? Why bother with a game we don't enjoy? So that we can write on internet that we do enjoy it? Somehow this eludes the narrative of many people. Occam's razor. Don't seek a conspiracy behind liking the game. We are having fun, we like it. Simple. And when people like something, it's natural to be thankfull to the creators. And - newsflash for many - you can be thankfull and critical at the same time. 
---
By now I'm fully aware that too many people find it offensive when other people enjoy a game they don't like. I don't get the amount of self-importance these people must have to make such statements, but I've learned that this is the norm on the internet now. If someone reading it is one of these jerks, then listen - there's nothing wrong with enjoying a thing, in the same way as there's nothing wrong with disliking the same thing. But these are tastes, these cannot be wrong. When someone is enjoying Fallout 76, then all you can do is to walk away. If you need to insult this person, then your internet priviliges should be revoked until you mature up.
---
Simply put: Enjoying the game is not shilling. Being thankfull to Bethesda is not shilling. Disliking the game is not hating. Being critical of Bethesda is not hating. But there is a line to cross. If you need to insult the people who like/dislike the game or people who made the game, then you are an asshole. Indirect insults like questioning the motives for liking the game or speaking about low standards don't make you any less asshole.
---
Some might call it /r/butthurtcoin
---
From what I remember didnt FONV not even run for the first month?
---
Here's some other people.
---
There are people who worked on Fallout 76 I ***want*** to praise. There is some amazing scenery and some really witty situations and the holotapes are interesting sometimes, some people did work really  hard on this dumpster fire, I feel bad for them haha. But Bethesda needs to be taken out to the wood shed over this hot mess
---
Mods should just delete that garbage. It's just a meme.
---
You would be surprised....
---
Happy Cake Day, btw!
---
I actually wonder how many of these folks are actually Russians looking for all areas that they can try to drive a wedge between people. 
---
I got the handmade plans a week ago. Made 10 or so and scrapped them at one time. ... no warning from Bethesda. 
---
Read his post over. He has scrapped so much that he has a mule that's carrying 16,000 pounds of scrap. That's a lot of scrap.  ... Or even if it's 1,600. I can't see the original post while I type this. 
---
My experience has been that I end up with *less* scrap when I build and scrap things, even sith super super perk enabled. 
---
Steel scrap weighs .05. Bulk steel is 30 scrap and weighs 1.5. you can double check my math, but 30x.05 should be 1.5. I'm not going to do the math for you on all of them, but [here's a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WjWGNTadalTRvtG1MzzFqGVQ3YOWv5QgnurmNyudPZM/edit?usp=drivesdk).
---
Here's the thing. Yeah, if you look at your stash weight, them go bulk 300 steel (10 units of bulk), put it back in the stash, and check the weight again, your stash will be 1 pound lighter. But that's not because bulking saved you weight, it's because you used a pound of plastic.
---
You usually merge all of your individual feature branches and _then_ QA gets a hold of it, you don't just ship it without testing all of the features merged together!
---
Oh SHIT you're one of THOSE people who feel so IMPORTANT that they need to CAPITALIZE words of their YouTube videos to feel SPECIAL.

Instead of creating a duplicate of those FormIDs and edit those to make the new "mothman" headlamps, you edited the originals.
---
It wasnt the nerf it was not being able to craft with bulk junk, excavator PA glitch is back, Bobby pins weigh more than 50 cal rounds again, getting stuck in PA is back, Plan prices were doubled, plans that end game players grinded for are now free, melee can still do 20k+ damage, serendipity perk is bugged now, bounties are still bugged despite the patch notes saying otherwise, people can't trade even though they are below the max limit, all energy weapons are useless, all explosive weapons (not the legendary effect) are no longer viable, and xp was nerfed again, cao stashes only give you 1 cap now, and to top it off yes... explosive legendary effect and two shot legendary effect are useless leaving only melee to fill the gap and this game isn't supposed to be a hack and slash.
---
I experienced pretty consistent server lag last night. There was a 2-3 second delay when selecting an item to be transferred, whether it was at a vendor or random container. Also whenever i fast travel if a walk forward right away i get clipped back to where i loaded into the game after a few steps. This happens every once in a while but last night it was every time.
---
Strangely the servers seem slightly more stable in some ways. Like when i have a melee weapon and a ghoul rushes me, used to be a severe frame rate drop leading to not be able to land a hit until i got a little distance between us. In this situation the frame rates have gone up slightly allowing me to actually aim and land hits as they are right up against me and I'm twisting around to find them. 
---
This is honestly by all objective measures an unfinished and poor product. This type of brazen bad behavior whether it is cover-ups, not giving people what they pre-ordered (the bag thing), etc...it is just the WRONG DIRECTION - and they need to hear it loud and often from the fan base. They make some GREAT games, the last thing we want is to remain quiet and let them ruin a series. 
---
Thanks for the tip, I‚Äôll try that out
---
Omg what a waste of people‚Äôs lives. 
---
You should stop playing any video games and start volunteering at places that actually help people to get done fucking perspective.
---
You also need therapy.
---
my favorite is "DAE bEAtheda BAD??"
---
or, "Bethesda bad, CDPR good"
---
like, people actually try to shame you for complaining about a shit game being shit. if the shit game wasn't shit anymore, or if it was at least managed properly I'd say okay fine. haha, it's over let's all enjoy the game now. 
---
it's not though. it's still shit and by all accounts actually somehow getting shittier. the 'anti-circlejerk' is stupid as hell. 
---
His crimes? What crimes? Also, this subreddit, well the majority at least, hates him. 
---
You literally have a potentially infinite supply of perk points.
---
They are apparently causing them, tho.
---
Considering the game really isn't that old, there's still time. No Mans Sky took forever to get fixed.
---
That's why I didn't bring up dropping stuff.   No one in their right mind would drop something of real value to give to someone else when the game eats just-killed-corpses and just-dropped-stuff.   I've had scorch beasts that I took out at a pretty low character level just flat f-ing disappear as soon as they hit the ground.  Stuff like that should never happen.
---
Shill is an appropriate word. Liar is a strong word, and what you are insinuating.
---
That's not true!
---
They cut a lot of outfits and such from the base game to resell on the Atom Shop.
---
I got ultracite plans last night.  Left Arm and Explosive Vents.
---
It's lonesome and beautiful. I have to fast travel to 76 to kill critters for food, but otherwise I don't miss random spawns destroying my crops/structures.
---
&gt; Collecting all this information
---
We all know you're wasting your fucking time.
---
It has begun.
---
While this is only Gamestop doing it, it means that GameStop can't sell their stock of fo76. If no 3rd party stores buy the game to resell this may force Bethesda to transition to f2p.
---
I've got Speed Demon and generally quite good at handling the controls and I can still never avoid the attacks. I swear they know where you're going to run when they fire, and cover never makes a difference either. Annoying flappy bastards.
---
yeah I'd love to see Hardened versions of ammo change mods as well as something over the "hardened" for pure damage 
---
I feel like it‚Äôs just a desire to like something. I wanted Fallout 76 to be great and I did try to convince myself ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt that bad‚Äù out of my love for the series. It‚Äôs awful.
---
It ran, just buggy and crashed just like any normal game made from them and Beth.
---
They need to face up to the fact they have made, and in all honesty will continue to make mistakes. It's fine-there isn't a company around who hasn't. But banning complaint threads , deleting posts isn't the way. Just say 'Yes , we screwed up X we're working to fix it' You're human guy's we get that. Hiding or deleting the evidence just makes you look more foolish.
---
You think so? I mean most do for sure. Sports teams and leagues are huge about it, at least here in the US. I‚Äôm not saying they cancel out all the negative media around them, but their own Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, etc accounts are usually pretty well monitored. 
---
I don't think it solves the problem, it just avoids it.
---
People have been complaining for ages that Bethesda lean too heavily on the modding community to prop them up. I think it's about time they actually take responsibility for their own game and not rely on modders so much to fix their shit.
---
Particularly for an always online game. You could get away with that for a single player game but for an online multiplayer one, unless modder's fixes can be pushed out to all servers, it only helps a select few.
---
I didn't change much after this week's patch. I'm still mainly using my L40 furious explosive tesla shotgun with [this build](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwQNAgMNBAoBAQEDAgUNKE8CJwIlA8QBAxABbwWmAQOAAQNrAxEBCwOnAQOJAQNxA2wDNgK7AQMkA48BAxkDAA==). I switch off to a bloodied handmade for tagging/long distance. There's a lot of room to improve on those guns but they're the best I've found and I haven't really gotten into trading. And I'm sure I could better optimize perks, maybe add bloody mess. I could probably live without one of or both power patcher/power user.
---
I didn't really see a drop in damage after the patch. Both pre- and post- patch with the explosive tesla shotgun, demolition expert made the difference between 2-shotting and 1-shotting the L50 robots in Watoga, so I've kept that on despite the nerf. I had been running Gunsmith instead until I realized it takes ages for that gun to break.
---
Soon as we have launched a nuke we always say "Gentlemen and ladies! Drop your missles!"
---
You really are in denial. You know you are the minority. 
---
I hate when people use that defense. Often times it's the greatest fans of a thing that critique it the harshest, because they love it. Criticisms of this game absolutely need to be heard. 
---
\&gt;plays game for 700 hours  
---
\&gt;says it sucks and hates the devs for it
---
lol, you have serious mental problems, man
---
You can blame Sony for that
---
I see, might have to do some respecing,  you wouldn't happen to have an extra one of those PF by any chance?
---
If they don't want us crafting as fast as we're currently able to craft then Bethesda **needs** to implement some sort of limiter or cooldown so that our actual abilities are in line with how they want us crafting. 
---
I realize that people use this same argument for duping and other exploits, but I don't think there's any intent to exploit when crafting as fast as possible. If bethesda doesn't want us crafting that fast they can't just tell us "hey slow down" they really do need to impose a limit preventing it.
---
No witch hunting!
---
Exactly. In the last few days I remember ONE post thanking Bethesda for the patch and tons of negative posts, including several drama queens who "finally gave up". I know the patch brought back some issues, but nothing critical. Most of the time people are raging over balance changes as if balancing a game is something wrong. I agree that Bethesda cannot win here. Do several good patches and these people are either silent or make post like "why we shouldn't thank Bethesda". Then comes single patch that is average in quality at worst and these people come out in crowds. It seems that all they do is wait on the sidelines for single misstep to blow out of proportions...
---
Can you post link?
---
well seeing as they don't have experience with online games either, i'd say no.
---
Also, where will you be on the map. I‚Äôll need to walk there haha
---
Well, that one struck a sore spot.
---
Wtf, you trust developers that just want your money?
---
Might explain entitled gamer syndromes.
---
Don't worry, as long as your feefees tell you that you and your pals are the majority, thats all thAT MATTERS.
---
Your like that  person who hates facebook so much that stays on facebook to keep reminding them how much facebook sucks. Instead of constantly bitching about a product you do not enjoy. why not just go play with something else. Haters got to hate i guess. 
---
Maybe because I rather help them than be an asshole?  I realize that not everyone thinks that way.
---
They fonv in one year... Bethesda took ten to make for and it wasnt even good, then they ported all of those assets into a trash empty online game with no content.
---
Let's be real here.   If Pete Hines kicked their newborn child in the face they would yell at the kid for hurting Pete's foot.
---
Bugthesda made my morning lol, bravo good sir/madam. Have a great day!
---
dude just block the bastard and hop servers.
---
Awwww is baby mad that your dupe accounts are getting banned?
---
I don't really know him.
---
I honestly think the backlash hit them so hard that they just brush any real criticism.
---
Either that or the backlash hit them so hard where they just don't care about a game that "nobody likes" anymore. 
---
To me yes cause another change will happen or I get a new drop I want to check so I invest in a new build constantly but can revert to my favored build as needed 
---
Oh my god you're fucking stupid. No one should waste time explaining things to a person who lacks as much intelligence as you do.
---
But at least the games aren't nearly as bad as FO76.
---
Thanks I'll try those options
---
What I find atrocious is that Bethesda is making Billions from all of these broken titles, and is willing to spare only a few devs to fix up their mess. It's like holy fuck, stop being so cheap and fix the damn game! You saved hundreds of millions of dollars by leaving Steam. Use that money to build a team that's not half-assing things. Especially when you refuse to stop using an ancient game engine with Skyrim "spells".
---
It's getting pretty old, pretty fast.
---
People laugh at this concept but I believe it's true. Think about how well shilling did for the political campaigns. Why wouldn't a company like Bethesda take a page from that playbook? It costs them so little and the dividends are huge if done right. I fully believe they pay people to write good things and make the people questioning the patch decisions look bad
---
If Outerworld supports the modding community like Bethesda used to, I'm leaving Bethesda as a loyal customer/guaranteed to buy all games and I'm taking my money to Obsidian.
---
They made fonv in one year.... chances are they would do better then Bethesda either way.
---
it *was more stable. this patch damaged performance pretty bad. hopefully the hotfix will take us back.
---
also, this is not the first nerf.
---
kthxbai. Please stop posting here now.
---
They private servers are going to be hosted by Bethesda. You will not get to host your own server. Source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/9asleu/pete\_hines\_confirms\_that\_fallout\_76\_private/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/9asleu/pete_hines_confirms_that_fallout_76_private/)

The internet would break
---
I'm a Casual Gamer due to I work alot, so I can't spend alot of hours on the game. I've been a fan of Bethesda games since they started. I've also been a Fallout fan since  day 1. But Fallout 76. Wtf. I played early enough to enjoy the White Springs XP/Leg. loot grind, but not early enough to get the chance of getting or even using any of these TSE weapons everyone spoke so highly of. You said you got bored after you felt like a god. I'm bored because I see no further drive/goels in the game. I wanted a TSE weapon pre-patch. They're not worth em now.  I havnt even killed one SB, let alone the queen. If the DLC are crap and Bethesda doesn't unfuck themselves with their patches, I'll be joining the ever growing number of players and fans who are quiting the game (and company) for good.
---
This is where you and I differ in view point. To me it just reads as incompetence i.e. we reminded them of an unlisted change and they then went back and changed it.
---
We're basically their editing team.
---
We shouldn't have to and it's a bad look for the dev team but I personally don't think it's has any malice or deceit behind it.
---
&gt;And I'm over here thrilled that I can easily find and buy plans for C.A.M.P. items
---
How much do those plans cost?
---
I get that, but I can't help it if the rest of you are smoking crack :-)
---
NV is so damned dull.  Every time I replay it, it annoys me more.  I've finally uninstalled it for good.
---
(Of course, I *say* that, but I'll probably play the New California mod at some point this year so I'll have to reinstall NV to do that.)
---
That won't give me my $60 back üò¢
---
GTA online for two weeks you couldn't play it at all and if you did play you ran the risk of your character getting deleted then there was the infinite money glitch three weeks in which they didn't fix for months then their fix was drain everyone account who they thought glitched their money in game 
---
there is no incentive for bethesda to go free to play.
---
their atom shop isn't enough to support the servers.
---
Yup its my fault for letting them trick me, but its their fault not mine that is a shit game lol 
---
Seems a bit excessive, especially with no warning.
---
How is shill an appropriate word here exactly? Is the person trying to entice or encourage others? No. 
---
There is a bug which cause yout Critical meter not to fill up after using a crit shot in VATS. I seems that it works somehow because the damage is still how it should be but it does not get displayed that the crits refill
---
I never said it was. 
---
I play melee only since launch. 
---
I like the new pvp balance is all. Feels better. If someone's within 30 to 50 i got a good shot at being able to live thru a few bullets while i charge!
---
Especially with a preemptive stimpak. 
---
This happens to every single online game, so why the surprise?..
---
Complacency is the accepted norm, any form of resistance is met with ridicule by the majority. 
---
This is trained into people through a life time of conditioning. 
---
Same =good/accepted 
---
Other= bad/ not accepted. 
---
This is a much bigger issue than just a game, but that happens to be our problem here.
---
IMO the increase to armor repair was justified. Once I maxed that one perk out that reduces repair costs to 1 of each item, I ended up with over 200+ of ballistic weave alone.
---
Not all change is bad change.
---
Unlikely anyone will see this at this point but the 21:9 support was also broken by the last patch. 
---
I have a TSE handmade I used only for clearing silos when I went in solo. Well I also used it when I was in an absolute pickle (surrounded and unable to get help)... it's worthless now. I think my two shot handmade does better. Why make the TSE completely useless though? Now everything is a bullet sponge with it. They went a tad too far IMHO
---
It doesn't really make me think. I'm sure there ~are~ people downvoting negative/critical posts because of ideology. Can't say for sure about deleting posts since that's only doable by a mod, so seems unlikely.
---
As I just had to point out to someone else, that post wasn't making a claim, and it's not something I actually believe. But I do believe that there ~are~ trolls who really hate this game and would have no problem coming over to upvote misleading posts. Stuff like that happens all the time. PCGamer posted an article about this patch where the editor himself actually propagated some of the misinformation and linked to that paranoid post with the 10k thumbs up on the Fallout reddit. Like 90% of the replies in the comment section were derisive and mocking of 76-- so are you telling me you think it's crazy that some of those people would follow the link and thumbs up the bash post, even though they don't play?
---
I mean it's not a stretch, dude. xD  Not at all. Go check the stories being written about review bombing Metro Exodus over the venue change to Epic. People spite vote ~all the time~ and this is not ~controversial~ to point out. ;)
---
I'm not touching either until they have been out for a few months, and have good reviews.
---
That said, considering those games are years away - this is a useless idea.
---
This is what worries me about player vending, and it might also be why we don't have player vending yet.
---
For the fatman to have better damage there needs to be a scarcity of ammo. But if people have been hoarding mininukes to trade, then that scarcity is gone, people will just go buy 100 mininukes for like 10 caps from some player vendor.
---
Ugly? Certainly, your intellect is stunning. I'm convinced that your contributions to society are worthy of a Nobel. 
---
&lt;sighs&gt;
---
You're as useful as a dingleberry, but I commend you for trying to hang in there. Now go back to banging rocks together and shotgunning Natty Lite, and leave this English stuff to others.
---
again, that is a single player game. you cant say that they would do better because you're circlejerking a completely different project that was made almost 10 years ago.
---
I've been preaching and praying for private servers as a start (postpone mod support for a ton of reasons). Private servers would at LEAST give a sense of a single Appalachia and allow players to have predictability with who they play with as well as the ability to RP a world with vendors etc. Every time you load the game the world is completely different player wise. Its equivalent to loading fo4 and maybe and KLEO is in a different spot or not there at all. or you never see her again! I like the idea of not having to friend every player but being able to predict where and when someone is.
---
Fair enough. My username and PSN are identical, maybe this was missed. 
---
I don't think it's so much a lack of content (I played for a lot of hours compared to most other games) as it is there is no reason to revisit any of it because of how they structured their world. I sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into previous Fallouts because once you completed a playthrough, you can go back and try something different. Can't do that here. While my enjoyment of the game plummeted after I ran out of "story" quests to do, there's no reason to do another playthrough. I tried to squeeze some more fun out of it after completing the story, because I had a group of friends who all played together, but between the bugs and boredom it's just not worth it. 
---
How did the nerf made your build worse. Did'nt it make just every build about rifle worse. Your build should still be the same with the one difference that demo expert in not worth it anymore so u have 5 perks to respec and basically 10 lvl to grind max. This is not that bad isn't it? The Weapons are weak but still the best so u dont have to get new ones right?
---
How about just a big old "bye Felicia"
---
I take it you haven't been to /r/fo76filthycasuals.
---
I dunno if it's only the red one, my T60 use a bright one and my helmet has the atom symbol now since the last update.
---
This is the kind of content this sub needs more of.  
---
Ya, when I was farming my rare outfits I found this to be 100% reliable. 
---
If there's a house next to the Charleston Station, it won't spawn.
---
&gt; "entitled" "crybabies" and "whiners." 
---
I only say that to people who cry about microtransactions like it's a pay to win game. $20 usd is too much for power armor paint, I agree 100%, so don't buy it. It's that simple.
---
I don't agree with the idea of it being a hate train.
---
Initially, I was optimistic and the noclip documentary really got me excited for the game. I don't agree with the people who doubted from the start at all.
---
The extremely negative reaction is well warrented in my opinion. The handling of this game has been a complete joke. And to be honest, I hope Bethesda do get scared by this and don't try to do another quick cash grab again in the future. I hope they realise the community will not support them if they release a completely unfinished game with a large number of bugs, some directly from fo4, and then continue with anti consumer practices such as ridiculous micro transactions on a $60 game, canvas bag gate, reducing the price a week after launch, refusing refunds, etc. I hope Bethesda get shit scared and vow to never do this shit again. This game has almost ruined their reputation and I am considerably less excited for starfield and es6 because of it. I don't know if I can trust Bethesda in the same way I could before.
---
The term hate train sort of implies fo76 got more hate than it deserved. I think it got the right amount. As I said, the fact it is a Bethesda game puts it up for more scrutiny. If it wasn't broken, if Bethesda were more forgiving with refunds, if they were less heavy handed with microtransactions, then it wouldn't be getting the ripping into that it's getting.
---
To me, it feels like I'm at a restaurant, and a waiter has just given me some raw chicken. When I complain, the other people on the table are saying "stop hating, its fun with friends, my chicken seems fine...". When I ask for a refund, the waiter tells me "but you've cut into it! You can't have a refund now!". The waiter then brings the chicken back to the kitchen and brings it back out, less raw but still raw. This happens a few more times until finally the chicken is cooked. The rest of the table are now saying "see! The chef got there eventually! You shouldn't have complained at the start!" when the fact of the matter is I should have gotten a cooked meal at the start. If this happened at a shitty cafe or diner then nobody would care and I just wouldn't go back there, but if it happened at the Ritz it would be absolutely outrageous.
---
If Bethesda do decide to stop supporting 76, don't blame the critics. The only group that is to blame is Bethesda for thinking that the community would stand for a broken game coming from one of the worlds biggest game studios. I won't be happy if this happens, but the people who were on this hate train shouldn't feel guilty. 
---
Hah!
---
Very well said.  I really never expected them to fall off a cliff and deliver this mess in any game let alone a Fallout title.  There's a lot I enjoy about it but at the same time I have to be honest that the release and how they handled it has been an absolutely circus act not befitting of a AAA developer.
---
I love it how the last thing you‚Äôre still holding onto is the HUD. Talk about looking at the glass half full. üòÇ
---
They explained why the values were adjusted. Since plans are now available consistently and the rarity has been completely scrapped they raised the price.
---
They already have its the half assed Survival mode they are implementing (poorly).
---
I don't care if they go bankrupt, people just need to stop acting like speeds over stupid shit. It just a game, uninstall it.
---
Gamers rise up!
---
Yes, I actually prefer not having to host them myself (all the hassle of setting up servers) and *IF* they keep the promise of mods on there, it might be good for groups of friends.
---
However this probably is just wishful thinking on my part.. Uploading mods to their own servers would most likely not work really well, and they would have to be through creation club which in turn would give them means to charge money for the content
---
Good idea doesnt work. This is Zenimax/Bethesda you are talking about.
---
Square Enix was willing to axe people regardless of position to fix the problem.
---
Square Enix had a passionate director that saved a sinking ship while building a new one simultaneously.
---
FFXIV was a project filled with passionate developers that admited their mistakes and fixed it.
---
FO76 was a cashgrab built on lies and marketing hype.
---
I dont see it ever coming close to what Naoki Yoshida was able to pull off.
---
Dense chest armor mod reduces explosion damage you take, and the perk that used to only give fire resistance and immunity to being set on fire now also reduces explosion damage taken.
---
That's disgusting. Doesn't the power armour know that we're in a post-#metoo era and such behaviour is no longer acceptable?
---
To be fair to them, the position of the PSN you posted definitely makes it look like it was the other players name
---
Also if we open up modding in an online game with no regulation you open yourself up to a lot of potential issues.
---
Yeah it really should.
---
We are over two months after launch and the game has had five patches, and two hot-fixes and is still a bug ridden, unbalanced, poorly designed mess. At this point the game is just a collection poorly designed mechanics mashed together to resemble a survival game.
---
It has become abundantly clear the devs lack the willingness and/or the ability to make the changes the game needs. On top of this every patch has included some "balance" aspect that has done nothing but make the game more tedious and time consuming with no incentive or reward to commiserate with the level of tedium. 
---
The game and its dev team got shit on for the poor state the game was in at launch, and the devs reaction to that is too alienate anyone still willing to play the damn game. Mod support and private servers would at least the remaining player base to taylor the game to thier desires rather waiting for the devs to, hopefully, one day figure out what they are doing.
---
Pretty remarkable post to see upvoted so much because I think you‚Äôre 100% correct, but the fallout sub has been saying this since the beginning and the 76 sub has seemed to be in denial for a long time, even while still enjoying the game.
---
Is there an IP/legal issue with Bethesda using other people code? AFAIK, even outside Bethesda and Fallout, it is quite rare that games incorporate widely used mods improving quality of life or adding new mechanics/contents.
---
So, I agree with all of your points in regards to BGS majorly flubbing this title.
---
I would like to point out that I don't think that your logic tracks if you begin by saying, "it's fine to enjoy the game" and then turn around saying, "if you enjoy the game, you don't have the right to say so."  Please understand that I'm paraphrasing.
---
I wholly agree that BGS needs to be held accountable.  Please understand that it is not your view point, that I disagree with.  I disagree with supposition that players who are, in fact, satisfied with the game should not make their voice heard.  There shouldn't be name calling, I think we can both agree on that.  But if someone enjoys the game, as is, they should be able to voice that here.
---
Bring on the downvotes, because I know their coming.
---
Hmmm...  Are you on Xbox?
---
Do you crave the praise of the enlightened Mothman?
---
Have you encountered the scorched Mothman with yellow eyes?
---
Do you tremble in pleasure When approaching Mount Pleasant?
---
Exactly, it's similar to games that came out around the Minecraft era. The first part of the game is all about getting food and building defenses, then it transitions to more epic adventures once you have the basics taken care of
---
Not listen to the entitled whiners complaining about nerfs, and continue to ban all the dupers and everyone associated with them.  Add more anti griefing measures to cater towards PvE instead of this PvP garbage nonsense.  Work on improving patches and not rush them out.  Continue with the balancing of weapons and perks in both directions - add some buffs where needed.
---
good point.
---
PvP for me is now allot easier and i thought it was piss easy before ...because the people who already sucked now shine through more than ever without the bobbleheads hind behind üòÇ
---
I just finished crafting all the nuka cola ive ever found into nuka grenades... but...
---
Oh no...
---
I was using super DUPER perk while crafting!!
---
Did i bamboozled myself now having 120 of these on me?
---
Do workshop taking/defence events, i regularly get rewarded with 5+ BF a time.
---
The people who want it reversed are out down voting the shiz out of everything that is positive about the Nerf. I'm sure I'll get down voted too... 
---
Pfft.  
---
3 &gt; 4 &gt; NV.  That's my ranking.
---
I'm honestly not sure where 76 goes in the mix.  
---
I feel violated and aroused. 
---
In your opinion, what do you think will happen? Will they pull the plug entirely on this dumpster fire? Or will it just linger about with a few people playing and eventually let the modders have it/private servers type thing where we can have some real fun? I mean aren't there some games that sort of went belly up but got taken in by modders and now are hella fun? 
---
As a player that eschewed the dupe economy and only have used what I‚Äôve picked up myself I was lucky to find a bloodied Gatling gun with bonus limb damage, and I‚Äôve carefully curated my build around it. It‚Äôs a good time.
---
I appreciate Bethesda hasn't responded
---
Really help the player economy!
---
&gt; They can, according to most EULAs ban you for whatever reason they want.
---
And some jurisdictions, the EU in particular, have laws which render those sections of EULAs null and void.

Star field better be amazing

Kudos ma'am/sir

Well, when you first invest in posting a crypto post, you have to accept an immediate drop in your posts value from people who believe crypto is untouchable.  However, since posts are more stable than crypto, eventually it goes into the positives.
---
I'm pretty sure  a lot of them don't...
---
Don't even get me started again man...
---
Bulk xoes not counting as junk anymore.
---
Bobby pins weight 0.1 again.
---
Vendors selling plans for 10 times the amount they use to be.
---
Disconnecting from servers constantly.
---
I can go on but I think we all already know this.
---
The hardcore kiddies are mad that Bethesda took their binkies away so they are throwing their toys out of the pram.
---
We do chores. Collect plastic to make costumes to sell for caps daily. Constantly collecting junk from certain areas to repair broken weapons and armor. Trying to level up more to respec 1 point at a time. Over n over n over again. 
---
Bethesda fucked up **BIG TIME**
---
Theres no way to deny that. If you dont care about it and just accept everything they do, you end up with EA like games from them.
---
We as the community absolutly have to speak up. Otherwise they think they get through with this kind of shit and that cant be happening. 
---
So far I like it honestly.  They could make it a toggle I suppose. 
---
I agree, caps aren‚Äôt unrealistic to earn. I have nearly 3000 after saving for a few days. And I don‚Äôt even have any cap perks.
---
Fair facts. 
---
How bout just let us respect after every big nerf bat blow or when you decided to make some perk cards irrelevant.
---
Exactly! It reminds of the days of the PS3, where you could put Linux on it, but they would block being able to watch videos on the internet because it was a PS3 instead of a regular computer.  I just don‚Äôt get why they lock everything up.
---
Oh don't get me wrong, I'm not at all against modding.
---
I'm just saying that modders shouldn't be used as a crutch. BGS should just get their act together and fix their shit. Free up modders from bug fixes and focus more on cool and zany new features and ideas.
---
300 hours and I'm still finding new locations, finding items and easter eggs in old places, new and cool places to build my house, finding cool new gear, playing with new weapons and mod. I'm lvl 102 on my main and 5 on my alt. I spend a lot of time just chillin in my base with my friends and helping my gf explore things because she's much more meticulous then I am. I fight the queen when she shows up. I launch nukes in unconventional places when I'm curious or just want to hit another players base or something. The daily and weekly challenges keep me busy for a few hours as well considering how sidetracked I get just collecting some basic stuff. I like collecting things so I've been grinding a little bit for caps to buy plans, but the vendor cap limit really slows that train down and gives me an hour of stuff to do every day.
---
People can be both at times lol
---
The incentive is more players. The f2p model isn't about getting all the players to buy things. It's about getting the miniscule percent of players that buy everything.
---
Long term Bethesda has to get the atom shop to pay for the game. Sales will die off and already GameStop in Germany is giving the PS4 game away. 
---
is that name a paladins reference? pssst I main furia 
---
I had a lot of hours from idling around with friends, trying different builds/weapon+armor combos, running around and pvp'ing. I ran out of stuff to do after about a month and i was just staying with the game to not give up on it
---
I legitimately laughed out loud at this, thanks for that.
---
Gamestop has been trying to find a buyer to buy the company, but it seems no one is interested.  Perhaps someone will offer them in store credits.
---
I was having a ton of fun just exploring for my like 200 hours but after doing nukes a bazillion times at two locations I grew tired and stopped about a week ago and picked up ESO instead.
---
Eh, it's acceptable in the sense that mistakes happen.  If it was hotfixed (trololol) it's really not an issue.  But as you said this is symptomatic of a bigger problem, and that is that 76 is getting code check-in's with no review, or worse, sloppy review.
---
No review is an easy problem to fix, just have a senior dev do code reviews.  Boom.  But sloppy?  Oh man.  First you have to determine if you fire the person.  Like maybe it's a tenured eprson that got moved to Austin and is just unhappy with the region and it's effecting an otherwise stellar career.  You don't just shit can someone that has tenure and an otherwise impeccable portfolio.  So then what?  It's team building time, and that is not done overnight.
---
This problem isn't going away anytime soon.  It's huge, but the mislabeling of an asset via laziness or mistake is not really a big deal and an easy fix.   It's the source of the constant problems that are the issue.
---
What if it sucks
---
Two points:
---
If you believed they were incapable there would be no point to criticizing them would there?
---
This is far from the first time they have suffered a back lash.  The New Vegas release was horrible and i took much patching to make it playable.
---
Come join us over at /r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
I am still enjoying the game however I have to say I am strongly disappointed after last patch. I do not mind general changes, they balancing the game a bit more. However I cannot understand how this patch could create more bugs in to the game than I had before. Bobby pins huge weight again, walking inside resource deposit hole makes You stuck under game texture, heads of dead scorched flying in weird angle from them bodies, events finish whithout no reason while I am in a middle of doing them, bulk items do not count as craftable resources in your stash, not mention if part of required resources is in your backpack and other part in stash there is no chance to craft an item even though You do have all necessery resources to craft. 
---
Never in all my years of playin games I have seen a game updates actually working backwards.
---
I agree. I used to see people complain about this game and could understand why they hated it. I had a "it never happened to me, idk what these guys are talking about, it has it's flaws but it aint that bad" mindset, then it happened to me, a glitch that wiped out about 50 hours of gameplay. I won't be returning. Simply put, this game can be fun, but when you lose your progress or when bethesda has a more grind = more content attitude, nerfing everything into oblivion,  I'm out. maybe it will be a game worth picking back up in 2020 but with the downfall of players I've seen, I doubt it.
---
I've been using the mod's up on Nexus since they came out. So about 3 weeks into the launch.
---
I play daily, and have never skipped a day. I'm up to about 10 mods I use constantly too.
---
Lvl 210, still here and playing, haven't been banned.
---
Also, their ToS is worded the exact same as the other Fallout ToS. Their FAQ for Fallout 76 also states that they are not responsible if you break your own game, but they ***do not*** say you cannot use them/they will ban you for using them.
---
Honestly at first I was sure the devs were just time pressured into releasing the game before it was done by management, and we‚Äôre doing their best to release good patches and bring the game more up to snuff in the coming weeks. But this most recent patch, I‚Äôm not so sure anymore. They clearly don‚Äôt know how to balance the game, nerfing things that are powerful while not buffing things that aren‚Äôt just brings the overall power ceiling of your character down, and in a game where enemies are all bullet sponges, no one wants that. And they have no way to close off their dev room, so they just ban every account that breaks into it to sell guns they pull out? That‚Äôs fine and all, but it‚Äôs not a good solution because people are still taking the weapons out and managing to get them on other accounts and sell them. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not happening a lot, and I‚Äôll be honest I wouldn‚Äôt know how to fix it either, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse it. 
---
You know what I think bethesda needs to make their highest priority to save the game? Allow people to start modding the game. Release modded server support. Then people can make bug fix and QOL patches as mods, and stuff like breaking into the dev room won‚Äôt matter as much once mods like cheat terminal or something similar become a thing. That‚Äôs the beauty of single player fallout games, if you cheat the only persons experience you‚Äôre hurting is your own. 
---
Its easy, get a Time Machine and go back a month or so before they nerfed everything.
---
If that's not possible, then you're in for a long grind.
---
It seems the caps Bobblehead is broken, as well. Tested last night, after I did a stash run without bobblehead Tuesday night.
---
I got SIGNIFICANTLY less caps WITH the bobblehead active. I got 3 or 4 stashes where I only got 1 cap, and no option to search it. I have level 3 cap collector.
---
Ppl trust them for the wrong reasons and then that trust is broken and they feel entitled to bitch and moan when they were wrong to ever trust them.
---
Balancing a game is what i trust them to do and they're doing it
---
What the fuck are you taking as a drug? In no way am I, or the other person, actively endorsing the game. I‚Äôm saying that the game isn‚Äôt bad. My opinion is that the game isn‚Äôt as bad as other see it. Remember how you made a post about how the community in game was nice? Well, that‚Äôs what the subreddit used to be like. Now, the subreddit has gone to shit with people from r/Fallout spreading lies about the game and about the company. They aren‚Äôt the most honest company and have made a lot of mistakes, but there are companies that are much worse than Bethesda. And thank you. You made me realize that being in such a hostile environment isn‚Äôt enjoyable. I could give two shits about this subreddit now because the mods just sit on their asses all day and do nothing. 
---
 \*\*\* spent MANY dealing with inventory management 
---
EDIT 2: I think the max I could have would be and extra + 3 from STR armor + 2 from X-cell, + 2 from Alcohol, + 3 from bufftats + 2 from STR bobble head
---
66 if added to my 54, correct me if im wrong
---
heh, I moved from the east side of the map to the west just because I was so sick of dealing with anglers attacking my base. If you don't mind players popping in from time to time, north of Flatwoods is pretty barren of enemy concerns. Every once in a while, a low level feral or super mutant will swing by, and they're easily dispatched by a shot or two. 
---
I have often tried to explain to friends and family how unbelievably awful the gaming community as a whole are. They really do thrive on the negativity to the point that it blinds any reason they have. I mean, the fact that there are multiple people that admittedly don't play and have never played the game coming on here to post how happy this makes them is sad. I can't imagine what the rest of their lives are like. 
---
Can confirm this is absolutely true. Worked on Madden 2013 at EA.   Most people think, just drop a hotfix for these issues.
---
PC:-Hotfix can be deployed at anytime to all machines no issue.  No one will verify the patch such as 3rd party
---
XBOX--MS has a verification process that can take up to two weeks. This is why most patches that are deployed are so large, as they have a bunch of hotfixes in them and any other changes that they are trying to make.
---
Sony--Pretty much the same as Xbox, but even a little more through.  Their QA team, at least for the US, is very large, but they seem to go through everything with a microscope, and even the smallest problem and it is usually rejected.
---
The problem is that most of the verification from the big boys, doesn't look at the things that maybe broke but more of the things that the dev says is fixed.  Unless it is really staring them in the face, many times these small bugs get overlooked.
---
So patch drops on Thursday, reports come in Friday "This is broken".  Devs have a fix almost immediately, but have to bundle it with all of these other fixes.  Verification happens to start Monday, takes only a week, so we are now at Friday, patch/hotfix approved, then MS will tell you when you can release it.  This is a generalized timeline.
---
If they wanted to patch consoles immediately, that is not going to happen.  I have seen them push it through a little faster, but normally, even with all their ducks in a row, the process can still take a week or two. 
---
Look at No Man's Sky, they patch almost every week, but these patches were created months ago, most probably submitted before the 1st of the year and are now getting put in the game.
---
If anyone is in the game industry now, can you confirm this is still how its done?  I am pulling from memory from 5 years ago.
---
I like it. 
---
It's just ridiculous. Either way, not gonna stop me from enjoying 76 :)
---
This is me. That is what open world Bethesda games have done best imho. It is all about the environment storytelling.... Things are placed with some reason, architecture and buildings the way they are for a reason, corpses and objects near them for a reason, things tell a story or at least prompt you (the player) to start thinking what stories might have happened and to think what went on in this location. It's fun for me. Like being a wasteland archaeologist. 
---
&gt; If everybody here is telling that they are quitting, why not tell that I continue? 
---
Unfortunately, dramatic opinions will always draw much more attentions than its counterpart. That is probably why a lot of people in here feel like they need to "announce" their departure, or even highlight the most obvious bugs in such a way that it makes it look like the Armageddon.
---
Yet, I agree about the fact this game is a bloody mess right now, but still it is an unique bloody mess and one that many of us were waiting for. That's the reason why at least some of us won't let it go so easily.
---
That won't mean we'll cut a slack to Beth, we're just patiently waiting until the issues will get fixed so that we may enjoy the game we believe in.
---
I mean, afterall, I \*suppose\* we all have something else to do in the meanwhile... Even if sometimes, some of those who've been posting the usual "THIS IS WHY I'M QUITTING HURR DURR" sound like they don't really have much more interesting other things to do.
---
This is something I‚Äôve wanted in 3D fallout for a long time. There is absolutely no reason that vehicles wouldn‚Äôt work, especially considering there has been working vehicles in other fo game like the highwayman from fallout 2.
---
Boom!
---
Why do you feel the need to cuss, capitalize words for emphasis, and be an all-around Internet ass. You made a logical fallacy ‚Äúpost hoc ergo propter hoc‚Äù. Since OP has posted negative opinions about games before, their opinion isn‚Äôt valid because they‚Äôre always negative. It makes no sense. 
---
But cool, be an opinioned Internet bully and get all uppity about Youtube somehow when it has nothing to do with either of our comments. Nice one, dude. 
---
Server hopping the golf course clubhouse at The Whitespring to kill the ghouls repeatedly and running around farming Watoga bots are the only legitimate ways I know of. I personally leveled my alt from 2-50 in a few days of farming whitespring clubhouse, maybe 15 hours or so total.
---
It's demoralizing, though. Some people are creative, and put heart into things they make. Others are no-talent destroyers. It doesn't matter if it is easy to rebuild. The fact that someone purposely vandalized your creation will put you off of the game. It feels violating and is straight up not fun.
---
Sure, if the feedback is mature and constructive, and a significant chunk of the posts here recently are neither.
---
I"ve scrapped that many guns and came NO WHERE near 16,000 pounds carryweight. I will tell you when I DID have that much carryweight... back when you could do the pocketed armor glitch and I was walking around grabbing EVERYTHING I could in order to help all my teammates build their camps. I mean it took me days to get up to that kind of weight (scrapping junk the entire time)
---
By the time you finish making your vendor runs you will need to go farm mats for ammo. By the time you finish that head on out to find materials to repair your guns and armor. By the time you finish that you should be low on food and water so get to work on that.
---
Unless of course you choose a melee build. In that case do nothing because your weapon will hardly ever break and you don't need ammo.....plus you can kill everything with one shot.
---
There was an exploit where you could defuse a grenade bouquet and get xp, so a lot of people just set up a macro and walked away. 
---
Welcome
---
Bullshit. If they didn't nerf tse ppl would be fine.
---
Maybe... but will you be able to tell it's actually a plan for a brick wall and not some random crap? The plan names are pretty shit imo.
---
I agree now that I look at it from a different perspective. It kinda looks like an add "Come get this bastard: ProducerBoy416!" but I didn't mean it like that lol. 
---
MODS IM SORRY. 
---
To be fair though, it's a good spot for low level people. Vendor right there, pond for your giant water purifier
---
Not a lawyer, so can't comment, anyone here know IP law? ;)
---
also let us break the cards back down so we can just take the initial one star perk if we want
---
*The entire video gaming communities has there standards lowered to oblivion these last couple years.*
---
I could not agree more man. I have read that apparently games being buggy at release could potentially (with time) cause the next gaming crash. People are losing the trust of publishers (EA, Activision) and now thats spreading to game developers (Bethesda). We are all getting sick of micro transactions especially when you need them to progress within a game without grinding to oblivion. Its a sad state of affairs but I hopE this F76 debacle will serve as a lesson to other publishers out there as people are losing their patience.
---
Everyone in my server was fighting a scorch queen that took no damage it was bull shit since everyone used high level weapons 
---
How did this not get reported for clickbait title. Did you use to work for Buzzfeed?
---
I've been having fun, almost as much fun as reading /r/FO76 on a daily basis.
---
But seriously, I played for a couple hours last night after Patch 5, and I think I have the unpopular opinion, that it's the best the game has been so far.
---
Zero disconnects, great performance, and the load times felt at least 50% faster for me. As someone whose system is scrapping the barrel for system requirements, Patch 5 felt great.
---
I've seen a bug where it won't let you craft something if the materials you have are only barely adequate. Like if you need 10 steel and you have 11, it doesn't let you craft it.
---
The problem went away for me when I got more steel.
---
Exploring and looking at everything in agonizing detail... Hubby and I can spend two hours just at one small location going over every inch of the place, looting everything, talking about what we think may have happened at the location, reading any lore and then talking about that, returning home to scrap everything and bulk or craft things, work on the homestead, decorate things, go back out again. 
---
Where did they actually say that anyways?
---
Sorry bro, this opinion is "off meta" and we can't allow such things around here.
---
Thanks. Whenever I try whitespring, the spawns are ridiculously higher leveled than I am. 
---
someone clearly doesn't use non-PA armor.
---
Yes which means its a valid post, not a problem.
---
1 post is a opinion being presented. 14 posts about the same thing is a problem. Do you see the point i am trying to make. 
---
As a side not, i disagree with the post. Your "true fan" level has nothing to do with how actively you post.
---
No one (in the community) is preventing people from reporting, complaining, whining or doing what ever they want to raise awareness about bugs or bad practices.
---
Mistakes **do** happen indeed. But when you edit all the headlamp IDs to add the `ATX_` prefix (thus making them appear as atom shop items in-game) and then you (most probably by mistake) edit the original red lamps to create the "mothman" ones (and add code that make them atom shop exclusive), then there is intent. This is not just a mislabeling due to laziness. 
---
Protesting doesn't win wars, fighting does. Working on better equipment, training, and intelligence wins wars. Coups, revolutions, assassination, people's army etc are all active things of people actually doing something. Going out in the streets and protesting is marginally effective but voting makes a bigger impact.
---
Complaining on a message board is not protesting and has extremely minimal impact.
---
I‚Äôll be on later than that (around 9 est) but if you‚Äôre still looking for help I‚Äôm leveling and alt right now as well (lvl 28 currently if that matters, been sticking mostly to the forest and the toxic valley)
---
You shouldn't use him as a punch line as he's against abortion of fetuses with obvious mental defects. So if anything you should be thanking people like him for your existance.
---
It's true man.  I had 1 cap for the stash above whitespring service center.  But whatever keep discrediting people because thats going to help solve all the problems.
---
The less time you spend on maintenance and item managing the faster you would blow through the missions so the faster you would get bored 
---
If it was just words ppl said on here i wouldn't trust them at all.
---
I too just got the handmade plans at level 212. Was going to craft a bunch now I'm thinking I will just craft one at a time, eh
---
[She apologized...](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alfuv2/-/efftq88) And personally doesn't deserve the backlash IMO.
---
Ya pays your money and ya takes your chances... I have enjoyed EVERY Elder Scrolls game, I enjoyed Fallout 4, and I am currently enjoying Fallout 76. I know it's not a popular position to take but that's my truth. I am very aware of the bugs and issues but I have faith that they will get it right. I didn't pay $60, only $40 for the steal book from Walmart so I don't feel as bad as some. Fact of the matter is Bethesda has never done anything like this before and is learning as they go. It should have been handled better but it wasn't. For me there is still plenty to enjoy as is. 
---
SBQ battles will be interesting with only melee builds playing.
---
If/When you can, post a picture. 
---
YES, the weapon is nearly useless at its current state. Uses ammo really quickly - ammo that you can only craft in very small quantities, and on top of that has ridiculous recoil (esp. for PA, which should logically reduce recoil but oh well) whereas a ,50 cal has almost no recoil...
---
I'm at the same level, I level up quickly by going through west tek, big bend Tunnel, around Watoga. Let me know if this helps.
---
It's not all bad I mean if you can find some filthy casuals on fo76 it might help 
---
I will give watoga a try. And yes, my weapons blow pretty badly. No luck on drops like most of us here. 
---
What's your build line so far?
---
With how you've handled every other "fix" maybe you should just leave energy weapons alone.  I frankly don't trust you people at this point to fix or buff anything without gutting it entirely.
---

Please help.  This is something that needs to have a swift and public resolution.  This isn't the only claim of this that I've heard of.  When I run across others, I'll forward to you as I am able to.  One of the ones a friend of mine told me about was given out because someone crafted multiple weapons so that they could scrap them and learn mods.  If that one ends up being true, there are going to be law suits.  It shouldn't come to that if Bethesda figures out how to reign this in and properly ban the people that fully deserve it and give the benefit of the doubt for those in gray areas.
---
No one should be banned in this manner.  Yes, do something about duplicators, but this is such a new game.  There needs to be a graduated response.  Someone at Bethesda banning someone and ignoring their responses is downright reprehensible.  The whole guilty until proven innocent is garbage.   
---
Toxic players need to go.  Players that are caught in the middle need to be given the benefit of the doubt.  If a system needs to be created so that there are strikes that can be lodged against them and action taken over time.   Those strikes should reset after a good long period of time.  A system like that needs to be implemented for a number of other useful reasons I won't go into here, but should hopefully be pretty obvious.
---
Ballistic Fiber is easy to find. Just look at any army camp.
---
They had us at the first half, not gonna lie
---
The junkyard bug has been there since beta.  Only way to fix it is to find another server.
---
It is very cringy and I genuinely get a kick out of them thinking anyone actually gives a damn about their departure. At least give your shit away if you're that serious. 
---
Lvl 81, the only descent weapon for mid/close range (but not too close) I hade was a 10mm explosive.
---
Now it is useless and every mob is a bullet sponge.
---
The only viable build is PA+melee and it is very very sad. IMO, Bethesda is artificially delaying progress. The result? A chore game.
---
I read all possible Fallout FAQ (even like this one, not a gamer community: [https://help-center.pissedconsumer.com/best-answers-to-12-bethesda-softworks-questions/](https://help-center.pissedconsumer.com/best-answers-to-12-bethesda-softworks-questions/)), forums, blogs, new and old. Nothing! Game keeps crashing! I will call Bethesda every day and ask my friends to do the same.
---
That usually will only happen if there is a high level player in the area that spawned them. Even so, don‚Äôt be afraid of dying. Get a Tesla rifle at level 40 and tag everything once. If you see a high level guy, run along with him making sure you tag everything and let him kill them. Also, get a strong melee weapon and put some perks into that. You should be able to just about 1 hit those level 62‚Äôs at your level with some perks. 
---
Each private sever is going to be it's own self contained ecosystem, the devs confirmed this before release. This is to prevent modded players from interacting with official vanilla servers/players.
---
Ark, Rust, and Conan Exiles all have mods and private servers that are separate from the officials and are self regulated by the players that run them. And that system has been working fine, I see reason why this game would be different.
---
PC &gt; Consoles
---
Last night I played 10-12pm.  If today I play for an hour at 5pm, less than 20 hours after I last played, I would miss out on that days reset.  
---
If it reset daily at a set time, I would be able to play any time within that 24 hour window and still get my daily 200 cap allowance.  
---
https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-will-have-mod-support-but-not-at-launch/
---
A few places.
---
This does not align with the circlejerking echo chamber.
---
Yeah, so what ? Cheating in a singleplayer is as harmless as it can be. Meanwhile, you can be banned because the system *thinks* you cheated in the multiplayer game, which will also prevent you from playing your other games
---
I know I should be able to but I fail miserably. I have already decided I‚Äôm not that good a gamer as I‚Äôd like to be. Thanks. 
---
Which is a good argument for a hard look at rebalancing melee, rather then keeping TSE's the status quo. Sadly, when a rebalance does happen, we're going to have a similar mass freak out.
---
Sad fact, the higher levels require more materials.    
---
It could be that you have enough mats for the low level ones, but not the higher level ones.
---
Also, if the materials you need are bulked, there may be an issue where it won't break down the bulk to craft.  
---
Try these options.
---
If your really stuck- the normal world spawn (I think its level 30) .50 cal machine gun and some pyschobuff shred anything even without perks
---
I don't disagree they likely know, but accord to some reports the team had to learn the engine from scratch, so it's possible there are gabs in the knowledge.  
---
It's also very very likely they are overwhelmed, but a good number of the fixes we've been reporting since the BETA could be fixed in an afternoon watching Netflix.  
---
It's why I'm trying to get their attention, let us help...  
---
The blanket nerf was pretty bad. It made several guns dead, and several dead ones even worse.
---
I was pretty content up until the recent patch; honestly thought things were slowly improving up until patch 5. Bugs were getting fixed albeit not all of them. But the regressions in patch 5 just should have been caught, bottom line. Something in the company needs to improve. 
---
There were mods for that. They were pieces of shit.
---
I played the game for a week and encountered invincible enemies, invisible enemies, broken interactions, broken quests, crashes, greeters that were 100‚Äôs of levels above me due to XP glitches, deleted progress. I feel like I deserve a full refund and I‚Äôve never felt this way about why game I‚Äôve ever played before  
---
I built my base north of watoga.. Bad idea. 3 sb spawned at once 
---
this has been a problem since BETA. The servers never could keep up with us crafting really fast. From what I hear, and I'm not very smart about these things but someone can put it in more better terms... when you craft something you get a notification that something was added, right? "purified water added" or whatever. so you craft a bunch and those 'notifications" get backed up. That makes the server lag. I've frozen the game for me and my buddies by crafting too much water or steak at once. I tend to go much slower now
---
But but, what if your buying stuff with credit earned through the game?
---
To the people who were "PvP ready" in power armor or 1 star armor + a TSE:
---
I forgot about the tunnel. That has decent spawns for carnage. Thanks
---
I think it‚Äôs a dumpster fire at the Austin studio right now, with a ton of people fired. Zenimax is probably trying to bolster Austin‚Äôs numbers now to fix the growing issues, but at the moment they are a skeleton crew, with some devs at Maryland helping with bug fixes instead of working on Starfield for the time being, but since they weren‚Äôt too close to the project they have no idea where to start. 
---
It seems they are nerfing aspects of the game that allowed players to progress through the game quickly and adding a PVP server to add some artificial longevity to it until they can have a full team working on it again. Not the best approach, but that‚Äôs apparently all they can handle right now, it‚Äôs going to be a real slow recovery until they can get some competent hands working on it, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs been so quiet lately on what their plans are. I may be wrong though, but it makes the most sense.
---
Yeah, that's the crappy part. Infinite load while exiting is usually my problem. Join a team so that if you have to disconnect you can log back into the same server.
---
After all the nerfs in that last patch I've had to put the game down also because KH3 came out. I'm all for bug fixes but some of the nerfs were not asked for and I feel like the devs/PMs aren't listening. They have given us a few QoL improvements but that's after how many people posting the same thread here everyday? I was giving them the benefit of the doubt when the game first released because I knew PMs were pushing to get it out the door for the holiday season but at this point I'm having a hard time giving the devs a pass now. Patching in old bugs and doing the laziest fixes (looking at you wide screen support) it's just rookie mistakes that shouldn't be happening for a company like Bethesda. I'll come back in a few months after I see some new content added and I'm done playing KH3. To all the fans who are still playing, I'm happy you are still enjoying the game and keep speaking out about the issues or nothing will get fixed.
---
My computer is at or below the system requirements, so performance has always been 'acceptable', but Patch 5 made everything vastly better for me. Better FPS, and load-times were improved by at least 50% for me.
---
76 has been an overall good game for me, Starfield seems pretty interesting, and I'm sure as hell getting Elder Scrolls. 
---
I'm of the same opinion. There was zero proof.
---
Is this basic information? I don't code so I have no idea. 
---
if you think that the only thing people are upset about are nerfs, then you are clueless.
---
That is part of the point of the official mod support. Once the tools are released it will work just like Fallout 4 mod support on PC and console.
---
Duping came back. And apparantly to dupe you need to lagg the server.
---
Server lagg is the cause of this. :( 
---
Switch server.
---
I have done this and do this regularly. I do not fully believe OP's claim based on this fact. 
---
Why am I not surprised 
---
Even if they take it all and give no credit.. We just want them to use the things we have been reporting, that are still not fixed since the BETA...
---
usualwhale on PC.   I've always got more junk than I need, send a friend request and let's turn this around.
---
Yes, I can. Some of the plan names are bad, but most of them are pretty clear. Brick plans are brick plans, warehouse is warehouse, powered doors feature the powered doors. Sure there are some like antique lights, that don't capture things very well, but it's not a complete wash at all. 
---
And every other person i PvP the last few days... I dont believe every single one sucked... Just relying on the wrong builds üëç
---
Good luck vault dweller! Hopefully a new method of cap farming or vendor rework will occur in the future.
---
Really think the patch was just mean to make the game pacing slower along with promoting longevity for people like yourself.
---
Whitesprings stations has all wall plans
---
If i sold you a car that could only go in reverse, but it works going in reverse, would you be happy with going down the high way like that?
---
I‚Äôm not online now, but mostly for rifles using handmade and strength for carry weight. And all the useless ones I picked early when food and water were scarce and rads were rampant. Would be nice to respec. 
---
Of what?
---
Complaining about bugs in a video game and calling for people to be fired because someone somewhere made a mistake *is* whining ‚Äî it pretty damn childish and shows a lack of understanding in how software development works. And ***no one cares*** if you have 500 hours in game and just can't play it anymore because Bethesda upsets you. No one. Fucking. Cares. 
---
With a little creative brainstorming YES you can take on the role of an NPC. 
---
You can design challenges/ "quests" for your visitors. You can reward your visitors with prizes/loot - however you'd like!  
---
I'm also trying my hand at being a vendor - it's a good side income.. I honestly can't see myself being good at or enjoying this role. It's just a little bit of fun to pick out which legendary weapons are "in stock," and how many Caps I'd expect in order to part ways with each item. Now that Ive got Metal Walls plan on my radar, with a fixed price... I know have to consider what I value most. Which is fun to think about. 
---
The only think stopping you from going full on NPC ( try to be as good as a 'really good' Skyrim or F4 quest mod)  
---
We can all be modders now, in a way. The best part? It's LIVE. And different every time. 
---
Opps, sorry I forgot you can only see names on other players and not yourself. I just did a quick check in game, looks like after the patch, the mic indicator changed to the bottom left ([image](https://i.imgur.com/d3rIOzs.png)), so you should see that if your mic's working in the game. Did you perhaps have the mic muted by accident? (Go sound &gt; recording &gt; microphone properties &gt; levels &gt; See if the mic's mute here)
---
Gtfo with logic. This game has no.place for thoughtful decision 
---
What about the glow in the dark ones they made?
---
I disagree.
---
I think the White Knight nerf was awesome.
---
Whenever you cave into the demands of those crying for a nerf you should also nerf something in their build. This way those people think twice before crying for Nerfs in the future. Everyone always wants to tax the living shit out of the next guy, it's not until they get their shit taxed that they change their position.
---
Incredible 
---
I'll say it can be a fun game, but by most definitions it's not a good game. 
---
If this wasn't Bethesda and Fallout this game would be pretty dead. 
---
Priorities right here
---
One of the vendors sells a plan for a power fist, sorry but can‚Äôt remember which one but I saw the plan while doing a tour of the vendors last night
---
It's on their official forums. Someone tried pointing out the problems with the last patch and their thread was locked for becoming a "flame war" (they said it was civil) so they made another, which was simply deleted and they were banned ("reason for ban: no reason given.")
---
I don't know if the problem is more widespread on their forums (ie. If I make a thread on it, will I also be banned?) but it's classic forum censorship which was riled up a lot of people who were previously defending the game.
---
thanks for giving me your thoughts. I like knowing this sort of stuff. And it does make total sense. I'd like to see this game go somewhere, even if it's down the road and I have to wait. It has potential. I really really enjoy the social part of it. I mean, playing Fallout 4 or 3 or NV now is very lonely, I miss my team. I hope we can all play this game one day and enjoy it but until then...
---
The impact is still the same as melee can one shot stuff. If thats the issue nerf melee to be like guns, tickling enemies.
---
nvm peace
---
Classic case of giving someone a project and no follow up / follow through.  They gave a studio this game, and let them go.  You see the same examples in everyday life.  How many times did something not ring up right at the cash register based on what was marked on the shelf.  No follow up on the guy doing price changes.
---
I understand that you are upset. That doesn't mean that I need to read post after post of people declaring they are quitting the game. I don't care. Take it directly to Bethesda and leave us out of it. Some people are still trying to enjoy the game and the useful information in this sub is getting harder and harder to find. At least take it to r/fallout, they seem to enjoy that type of thing.
---
Yeah like all this hate towards the game is really starting to bother me. Mainly Because I know how companies Act. If they get overwhelmed with negative stuff, then they'll just scrap the whole idea.
---
I seen a dude the other day that said they should just close down the servers and call it quits. 
---
I'm actually enjoying the game. I feel like I'm getting my money's worth. Why should the game get shut down because you have problems with it? That's what I'm worried about. I'm worried Bethesda will throw their hands in the air and say "you know what fuck it. shut them down."
---
Like everyone saw the reviews and saw that it wasn't a great game by standards. But yet people still bought the game and still put about four to five hundred hours into it and every day they post how it's the last straw. Really? Where in that 400 hours did you finally decide to quit?
---
I have never even seen the Tesla rifle. I‚Äôll look into where to find one and give that a go. Thanks
---
Slow down. Don't rush to power level. All you will do is sprint to a crawl and find that there is little game left at the end of the runway.
---
I had a camp just up the hill from Fort Defiance that had 2 of the buggers show up. They might not be able to do anything to me while flying but shame I can't say the same for my buildings. Shortly after 2 other players happened to walk by to find me stood on nothing but a bit of decking, surround by smoke and 2 dead bats.
---
Proof in the pudding is being able to reply once it's happened. It's ok. Look forward to your reply once it's happened üòâüëç
---
This is a bug, somehow the whole Red Tactical headlamp entries got replaced by the Mothman.  
---
This usually can occur when in CreationKit you choose to "rename" instead of creating a new record.
---
Holy narcissism.
---
Nope. I quite for these reasons and so did many if my friends. Fact check all you like. Calling me a liar without checking 1st though is just weak.
---
He could have earned the atoms. Calm down.
---
I had a legendary auto 50 cal w/explosive effects that leveled out at about 100dmg and that was crowd control carnage enjoyment.  Farm Whitespring and go to town on those fools.  Then the patch came and it neutered that weapon to a point where I could burn through hundreds of rounds and barely make a dent in some critters.  Very disappointing when a modded super sledge does 4-5x damage as that‚Äôs not much fun either. 
---
It really shows that BSG got a lot of help from ZOS.
---
Atlas&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Trebuchet
---
https://i.imgur.com/BQLq7lV.jpg
---
Yeah. But the blasts go through all that still. Even hiding in buildings doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
Secondary question: when do the daily challenges reset? Is that time universal?
---
I'm not going to call you a duper. I am going to point out you have provided not a shred of proof to differentiate yourself from a duper. 
---
My encounter so far w/flat woods monster was while being attacked by a SB
---
I couldn‚Äôt get a clear pic of it while being attacked by both.
---
I had hoped he would drop great loot but he didn‚Äôt relative to the work involved.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be the only one here to give you constructive advice: punctuation marks go inside of the ending quotation mark. Please take note everyone.
---
Its not irrelevant, if one shotting enemies is an issue melee needs a major nerf. The moment a melee user is at whitesprings you cannot hit ghouls fast enough due to how fast melee builds hit and kill.
---
Nerfed TSE then nerf melee into oblivion as well. Ridiculous that guns are useless in a FPS game.
---
Veteran game studios don't just spring out of thin air. This is how they're made.
---
Now Bethesda has a bunch of new experts to work on their old game engine.
---
If it is a mistake due to laziness, it is unacceptable for a professional developer. If it is due to intent, it is even worse.
---
No matter which, it is unacceptable for a AAA game developing studio to not have a sanity pass before they push the patch. It took me ~20 manhours to compile the unofficial patch note by looking at differences in the game files. That would take 10 devs, just 2 hours to do.
---
The game has underperformed by a huge margin. The shareholders will want to recoup all those projected profits one way or another.
---
Mark my words mate, expect anything cool to be on the atom shop from now on. They definitely aint gonna make much money from game sales thats for sure. 
---
Buh bye 
---
If they unironically believe they have a player market we should be scared.
---
Theyre Fallout/Bethesda fans, its understandable that many of them dont play F76 lolz
---
Yeah, the farming helps me because I've settled on sort of a glass-canon melee build for each of my mains, focused on damage output, but sacrificing durability in order to get other stuff. So I go through a lot of healing supplies, and it is quicker to reach the caps selling limit when the chem, first aid, and explosive boxes have loot.
---
I found out that sony doesnt track recent players since i switched from xbox and that was like a week ago. . Apparently ps4 does not have an online library where you find your clips.
---
I might regret my decision (ps4 was free tho) 
---
Lazy
---
I like that concept, but I think it requires the game to be designed that way from the ground up. At this point, those sorts of big balance changes are probably part of where the game is in a year or more, once a dedicated audience has settled into the game and given the devs some more direction toward what the core player-base wants.
---
Not really, Sony said the would and it's not like Bethesda was busy fixing there game to implement it as we can see by how bad it is still.
---
&gt;than just deal with bugs and nerfing aspects that add artificial longevity to it
---
It's not even adding artificial longevity: they nerf TSE's‚Äîok sure whatever; but they go so far to kneecap it and leave it just being marginally better than those godawful "legendary effects" like Junkie (+10% base damage) and 10% damage while ADS while also taking Demolition Expert down several notches along with it. What about buffing those effects that are dull and suck ass numerically? What about shit like the Flamer, Minigun, and Gatling Plasma that desperately need damage buffs on top making it so they're more durable than a gun made out of Lego bricks? If they just tear down the shit that's at least good enough or better to use then they're not gonna trick me into thinking it's more fun to dump 500 rounds from an MG42 into a single SM Warlord for more shit drops. I'll just leave like many others who aren't satsfied with having to respec into a specific build to compensate for using weaker weapons and nerfed perks or find/trade for new Bloodied/Furious legendaries that are apparently still allowed to be on a comparable level to pre-nerf Two Shot.
---
Choose the hour of the day with the least amount of active players and this is partially solved.
---
Do you troll every post ? Troll the after post too üëçüòâ
---
Why downvote this?   
---
I think this is a good idea. Intrinsic AP would make it a really interesting choice, combined with slower RoF.
---
Yes, improved and tested, unrushed patches. I agree. 
---
Don't leave us!
---
I totally support pointing out flaws, I just get tired of the circle jerk of whining about everything. Like we get it the game fucked up, we dont need 72 of the same damn posts saying how this and that happened or how Bethesda should be sued out of business. Report the bugs, discuss with constructive criticism, and move on. This was the main reason I un subbed r/fallout because it was a circle jerk hate train on Bethesda, which imo is just as useless to the FO community as the people who defend everything betheada does. 
---
Yeah this sub can become the Fallout equivalent of r/gatekeeping at times if you criticise Fallout 76.
---
I haven't noticed that even since the patch, but I have gone into the sound properties and it was reading my mic levels but I'll go through it again and make sure it isn't muted anywhere. 
---
Yeah the last time a courier was shot a lot of shit went down and the Mojave Desert was never the same again.
---
As are you. According to your comments you play this game 8 hours a day everyday. I don‚Äôt normally comment on dumb shit but you‚Äôre obviously a cunt. 
---
I wonder what they think they can get by saying "I'm done with the game!" or "I quit!". They aren't a cable company, they won't try to buy your business back. 
---
Great addition you made!
---
That was because the PS3 couldn't make sense of those files in that way, the Internet didn't support a lot of things.

Same. One at least managed to get a refund. The other is still pissed at me.

Fallout 4 was my first Fallout game. After learning they scraped weapon CND in 4 i was so happy. Now its back.. Thanks, i hate it.

Of the vampire pistol.

"Actually work" 
---
We can all look through people's comments and gauge how long they've been playing the game. So when you say Ive spent a ton of time playing and enjoying this game but it has glitches therefore it never "actually worked", yes it sounds whiny and entitled. How many hours of entertainment do people expect for $60? 100+ hours is pretty damn good
---
Its a phenomenon specific to Bethesda. The "fans" have an axe to grind and will latch on to anything negative and run with it no matter how false or how frivolous. If there's and opportunity to circle jerk and reaffirm long held (decades for some people) dislikes the Bethesda "fan" community is all over it. What's crazy is people can't just move on with their lives once they're dead set on disliking something.
---
Also good luck with the dating, mate. It's tough out there. (No sarcasm)

I suppose a robot like rose could DJ. I was kind of expecting after rose quest it would turn into a rose DJ radio.

Once mods come out who is going to pay for atom shop items vs modder made 4k outfits with custom meshes ?
---
This is such a good point! Nevermind my original post! I forgot I could earn more points and forget that this ever happened. 
---
this was already discussed in this thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al9q0l/so\_after\_doing\_some\_digging\_into\_the\_development/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al9q0l/so_after_doing_some_digging_into_the_development/) and as it seems with the reviews on 'indeed' the position of QA at bethesda isn't that great...
---
Except community managers don't really go into /r/fallout. The best way to be heard is to be loud unfortunately
---
Atoms are free though? Just play the game? 
---
Yeah I often say, some of us should be writing instructional 'how-tos' of how to play this game by getting through obstacles. How to invite your friend when it seems no one is online, etc haha. We know all the work arounds
---
isn't that what perk cards do though as you level up? prolong/increase the effectiveness of food, drink, armor durability, weapon durability? Have the ability to 'super duper' anything you create. Just my thoughts on it. As a high lvl, i hardly ever 'scrounge' for survival gear...my biggest farming is for lead or gunpowder since i'm a 50cal build.
---
Release was definitely beta. The systems were implemented but not really tested yet.
---
Can you prove the update broke more things than it fixed? 
---
I've always hated the PA HUD, and frequently removed the Helm in earlier FO versions.
---
FO76 keeps the PA HUD even when you remove your Helm, which is just stupid, and frequently causes me difficulties when the helmet un-equips every time I fast travel, that and the added weight that goes into your inventory, like; Wait! how can I be encumbered when I just travelled and didn't pick anything up.
---
BTW, it's been a minute since I've seen the name "Esham", got me nostalgic üòÇ
---
I like it. It makes crippling legs of multiple enemies way easier. Do you know how badass I feel when I cripple both legs and both arms of a super mutant overlord, walk up to them and drop a grenade on their heads? Very. I feel very badass. So rapidly hobbling deathclaws or ghouls or mutants is fun.
---
ehhh once everything is settled and they arent tweaking things so much, I could see them give mode support for ui and inventory like other mmos. nothing that actually changes the game just makes it nicer to look at.
---
After all you cant mod bethesda's servers.
---
Make a stable and enjoyable game with the correct support an MMO game should have. 
---
ZOS screws up all the time and I trust them because they're a team I can see and talk to. 
---
Bethesda's devs are not a separate division with their own leadership and community platforms, it's just all mashed into Bethesda.
---
Or stop being a company beholden to share holders and execs, but that's much less likely. 
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm the one griefing üòÖ I set up this roadside ‚Äúhostel‚Äù called off the rails for new players to stay in, cause I wanna be like a npc vendor or whatever, and it‚Äôs been getting griefed a lot so I‚Äôm always dying when I try to ask passerbys if they need to rest up and trade 
---
Nothing, it is clear this game is a money grab to them and nothing more. There was an entire underwater section of the map nerfed because it wasnt finishes so they just cut it out at release. HOW can they explain that? You cant, and they wont add it, they wont add dogs (even though there is a dog helmet and everyone wants this feature), the ONLY thing the updates address are trivial shit and they just nerf damage always for no reason.  No new content, nothing changed, it never will. If Bethesda did care AT ALL they wouldve released this a year later with everything finished.
---
&gt;calling for people's jobs
---
Just the upper management. I'm sure the folks who do the work are fine people. The ones making the decisions should find another line of work.
---
As much as i hate people who are buying these and the whole situation, he does have a point. 
---
So long as there will be people willing to spend money for shortcuts, companies will do any kind of dance to be sure these people keep doing it.
---
Sadly It ruins it for all "*real*" gamers valuing effort and investement over instant gratification, since companies will cater to those who spend the most even if it's in an unethical way. 
---
(See EA or the old santo outfit debacle with 76)
---
With that said, I don't care if you (general you cause apparently i need to specify it) have kids,  full time job or that it would take you months to do what would take us days or weeks. 
---
Your schedule already says you don't need this gear right away so please for the love of whatever fairy tale you believe in, stop with this mentality of i need it now so i'll buy my way up. You can afford it ? Great but that's irrelevant. 
---
It is ruining the industry for all of us who want to play a game that isn't cut into multiple little pieces and sold separately. 
---
We want full games day 1 and without having in game mechanics incentivizing external purchases.
---
I want to game like it's the late 90s / early 2K again. When what i was buying was what i was getting.
---
I agree with you but no one is ever going to stop buying microtransactions or buying their games.
---
Well it's an extremely well known fact updates and bug fixes break other things, you think Bethesda or fallout isn't going to have the same issues as other games/developers?
---
I can't say the exacts as I have only played it in short periods but they reworked the system I think in Legion so that if you're lvl 20 and your friend is lvl 40 the two of you can still do the same dungeons the mobs will just appear to be different lvls for you.
---
Zones were similarly scaled so you no longer have to leave a zone you were lvling in because it's no longer of the right lvl
---
The modding is/will be locked to private servers, the only way you would have access to the modded game is to play on a private server and anything you do there stays there.

#LearnToMineCoal
---
There shouldn't be the hard cap on ranges except min range, at min range all shots should land within x meters(say 5) of the target all the way to max range where shots land within y meters(say 50), all shots should have a z% (5) of dudding, but will still do xx% (50) of damage on a direct hit.
---
Artillery should have a level with higher levels improving those stats
---
Additionally using arty has a chance of pissing off the locals and inviting a direct attack on your camp
---
The goal of this is to make artillery a useful weapon outside of the one shot you use when you first get it
---
No doubt well said
---
I can only find the mod, but at 50 caps I feel its a safer bet than the plans. 
---
Oh yeah, the post calling for people's jobs only got like 6100 upvotes and appears in the first page of top posts ever on this sub. Doesn't really matter if there were only two topics if the opinion is so popular it reaches the feont page and becomes a top post. 
---
It's not really saying much though. You know how many games I still play after even 300 hours? Maybe like two. I don't even have 300 hours in any Bethesda game. There are too many great games out there to be playing the same thing forever like that. 
---
I believe graham is a shared cap pool with Watoga Station.  So you don‚Äôt have to find him to optimize your daily allowance.  
---
But yes, it would reduce the overall max weekly caps but make it easier for most players to reach the new slightly lower max, increasing overall cap gathering.  
---
My now nerfed TSE shotgun still takes down most ghouls and other critters with 1-2 shots and I‚Äôm fine with that.   My modded Dragon still functions a lot like the pre-patch TSE.  No worries there.  My gripe is other explosives and explosive effects got seriously downgraded and even maxing out Demo Expert (among others) doesn‚Äôt bring it back close to what it was before.  They should have just dealt with the 1 shot issues instead of blanketing all explosive effects. 
---
I mean you‚Äôre wrong, for a couple reasons too. One being if someone is being paid to do a job and they don‚Äôt do it and actually make a negative contribution than they should probably not have that job anymore.  
---
Also this is a company these people arent our friends and if people want to speak out about it they should voice their immense displeasure with what they spent their money on. 
---
And that brings me to your final incorrect point. If the newest patch drastically affects gameplay to the point where it is no longer fun and is different that what was presented earlier when previously paid for that‚Äôs kinda fucked. That‚Äôs like buying a car and then after the newest update you can only drive in reverse. It‚Äôs bad business. 
---
I still like my lever action
---
Thanks for the info. That means if i take 19 hours to sell to all vendors it will reset after an hour? If so thats great new bc i visit the vendors randomly when its convenient. 
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying these are incredibly rookie mistakes that seem to have no direction to them. They never had experience running an MMORPG or even made a Fallout game before, they have no idea how to balance this game out, and there seems to be no leadership direction on what they should do next. Instead of listening to the community they‚Äôre probably taking suggestions from their parent companies on what to do next, putting their word over ours. 
---
That‚Äòs for sure a legit assumption. I also read people complaining about spending 60 bucks for a game they played 600+ hours (as stated in other posts), while I remember times when 40+ hours of playtime was solid. Bethesda screwed it and ppl are right to slap them, but we are all free to not to play their games.
---
Maybe I am too old for this shit :)
---
Wanted to share my thoughts and leave a thanks. 
---
Have good one!
---
Many of the aspects of the game that make sense in a survival game ‚Äî limited stash, food for sustenance rather than buffs, etc ‚Äî don‚Äôt really mesh well with a shooter-looter. Personally, I think the game engine is much better suited for a survival game, but the loot roulette and item collection aspects are probably more attractive to traditional fallout olayers
---
Eh, true enough but that's the rule of the internet: it polarizes people. You gotta learn to read into what they're saying to find what they really want.
---
The conspiracy nutjobs by and large just want an acceptable game to their standards, and feel as though being extreme is the only way to be heard.
---
Likewise, those defending the game feel as though if we alienate Bethesda too hard they'll simply pull the plug on the game and be done with it. They feel as though some extreme positivity/defence of the game is required to drown out the negativity.
---
A "get over it" doesn't fix the core problem: Both sides are on the internet and the game is in an unacceptable state months later for many hundreds of thousands of purchasers. Until they're satisfied (which may be impossible at this point, I'll admit) this isn't going to stop.
---
I feel you. The amount of animosity here is ridiculous. I see people going on rants and tirades and writing long essays on their opinion on the state of something related to the game or why X is necessary and why Y was a stupid decision. I come in here, usually give my opinion in response to a couple posts or comments if it makes sense, but it's just not worth the strain and energy.
---
I bought the game for entertainment. I play it to have fun. If I have an hour before my next class and no work to finish, I might fire it up and run around Appalachia for a bit. If I'm back from work and don't have any schoolwork to finish, I'll play for a while. If I don't have fun with the game, I turn it off and either play something else or do something else with my time. There's enough stress in life without creating more by staging a virtual riot. Sometimes I get heated responding to things I find stupid here, and almost every time I regret choosing not to just ignore the post and move on with my life.
---
And what happen when they make a drastic change to your main build perks? Making your current build non viable.
---
Is it fair to force someone to use a broken build to level for the next 30 levels in order to properly fix a build?
---
Any perk that is changed should have the Perk points refunded and after major patches like the last one a one time only Token that respecs your character in full should be given to all players. Have the token be on a 30 day timer so it cannot be hoarded.  ALL Special points are refunded, all Perk point given back and I would even say all Card packs reset.
---
Since this only happens after a major change it cannot be used to change your build on the fly.
---
Almost every MMO i have played in the last 10 year has had this feature in some capacity as the game mechanic change and players should not be punished when those games happen.
---
Had this been done with the last patch I would likely not been nearly as upset as i have been. A 30 level grind on top of a 80% DPS nerf AND a broken build is not something I look forward to.
---
Where are you basing your numbers on? On Reddit post?

I think the phrase is vocal minority, silent majority.

I'm disabled. and it's cold outside and I don't have a car so I play a LOT. (I also take guitar lessons/spanish lessons etc). I hope that's ok with you. 
---
I explore. Still places I haven't found. I nuke stuff. I kill ghouls at WS looking for legendaries. I do quests. I take workshops and pray I don't get disconnected. I go to community events my friends hold. I help people level up. I find noobs and invite them to the team and build stuff at their camp. I do all kinds of stuff. I never get bored. But I do get disconnected and my game freezes and I have all kinds of problems with the game but I do get my money's worth, I have to. I can't afford another damn game right now. I was an idiot and paid full price for this dumpster fire. So I am enjoying what it does have to offer when it is working well enough to play
---
Agreed. It's my case.
---
&gt;We had no intention of supporting mods at any point

They won't allow this unless they can make money from it.

---
FFXIV was the result of bad game design. Saving it means making a better design.
---
Fallout 76 is the result of bad management. Doesnt matter what they do, unless management changes the game won't.
---
Oh yeah, does that make you feel good? 
---
Funny how they fix that without issue.
---
I still love this game . And I also had no bugs after last patch game crashes have not happen since then. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm lucky or if duper‚Äôs are saying things because they are mad or what is up. But I wish they hurry and let me buy that owl mask. 
---
&gt;"not true fans"
---
Or just stop using the phrase in general. I can't stand whenever people use this, because there isn't an actual definition. The phrase is entirely based upon what you think not what everyone thinks. 
---
An online rpg game acting a micro-mmo should give you more play time than 300 hours. For people giving up after not even 3 months after launch is again, saying a lot. Of course you're not expected to play this game everyday for the rest of your life, but for people having hundreds of hours quitting after 3 months? Yeah that's not good
---
Also I don‚Äôt actually recommend the minmipskip less than 1024 (is ugly) and I‚Äôm sure you can even keep large texture array dimension at 2048 sorry if that‚Äôs vague I‚Äôm quite baked rn 
---
I just prefer Bethesda to these whiny, copycat, misinformed, overly-entitled shitposts. You don‚Äôt know anything about how any of this works. You‚Äôre clogging my feed with garbage.
---
Doubtfull. For every one vocal there are like 10 silent. That's a weak arguement, at least mine provides tangible evidence rather than just a theory.
---
You know what, you've won me over.

This is such a quixotic move, I hope you succeed now.

A maxed out Demolition Expert costs Five points and provides a 60% bonus.
---
Combined the maxed out Rifleman, Expert Rifleman and Master Rifleman perks cost NINE points and provide a total 60% bonus.
---
Please tell me I don't have to do the math for you here to explain which of these is more fucked by comparison.  This is why they balanced Demolition Expert down, it was to match ALL of the other weapon specific perks and it STILL comes out ahead by costing less.
---
Good to see! Have a ghoulish high five :) see you in Appalachia!

Is any of your materials bulked? I dunno if the hotfix for that has applied or not yet.
---
It's Bypassing the stash limit by using a character for storage.  That character does nothing but act like a bank with no storage limit.  That is exploiting, there is no argument against that.
---
Tell me about it. I've tried to make sense of it, I've tried reasoning with people, I've tried getting angry, but there's ultimately no logic to be found here. People accuse the youtubers of being two-faced or making quick changes in their opinions, and yet here we have front page with like 10 posts all declaring they are leaving in the most melodramatic fashion possible. A bunch of them are gilded too. 
---
Sympathy &gt; A simple uninstall.

Boy, you sure are opinionated and bad at math! Raider, responder, watoga train, watoga phoenix, whitespring, enclave, harpers ferry, Graham. Looks like you have some memory problems yourself!

I'll defend one glitch, the character model glitches should be left in as long as they don't impact performance. It's hilarious to see a scorched with a super stretched out neck. 
---
The rest of the glitches deserve hate.

is lever action better than a gauss rifle?

I think it would have been a really good idea for the SBQ to relocate to a random fissure every week.  And for every fissure to be densely surrounded by a different type of vegetation.
---
They don't. Its part of the overall effort to slow progression. They seem to think that will help retain players.
---
Seriously stop nerfing shit what the fuck??? Why?? It‚Äôs not a pvp game it‚Äôs mostly pve PLUS the enemies are already pain in the ass bullet sponges so WHY??!!!

---
One shotting enemies rapidly is an issue, and whitesprings is a bit of an exception to one of my points as 100% of the enemies deliver themselves to the player. 
---
To expand further, the difference is TSE's had range, fire rate and AoE. Their effect on cooperation is *not* the same thing, but rather involves two separate mechanisms with the same end effect (one-shotting enemies). 
---
I don't disagree that a rebalance of melee may be needed, but there are *massive* differences between the mechanism of melee, versus the old TSE's in PvE. Otherwise the playerbase would all be melee if it had the same effectiveness.  (I'm not even a melee user, if that's what you're wondering)
---
Kid, every online game with a trading system has to deal with this. Especially MMOs. Go take a notebook and play a free game called RuneScape if you want an example of how they combat real world trading. In RuneScape you can buy things with real money but it only gets you so far because items require certain skills, quests, or levels. You cannot just of off and buy everything you want since you won't be able to use it. On top of that they dealt with a lot of exploits and they were able to control them because their team is not incompetent. 
---
 I understand they can't and won't directly respond to every single person, and every single comment, post and attempt to get there attention. I'm not naive..  
---
**But I do know they can't afford to keep burning bridges and alienating the Community.**  
---
We were promised a comprehensive list of issues and what was being done, it's not happened.  
---
We were promised a comprehensive and complete list of all changes for each update, and the opposite has happened.  
---
We were promised a end to the "Stealth Nerfing" and that has not happened.  
---
**To try and salvage the relationship with the  Community Opening a Dialog to some proven people....**
---
And I'm not suggesting it has to be me...  I'm not that arrogant... 
---
But creating a way to allow limited communication, even if it was just a weekly handing off a of a list of issues and a file of the fixes, it would help us all.  
---
Letting some of us give them fixes in a patch form, like has been done in Fallout4 in an unofficial form, would save time, many many fixes can be in just a couple hours checked over and merged into the core game files.  
---
Giving access to some of the Proven people to help with QA would not hurt, and if they actually have a Active test build live giving access to some fresh eyes clearly would be a benefit....  
---
And Honestly, getting some new input regarding balancing, ending the Echo chamber would help us all, because they clearly (No offense to anyone and their hard work) need allot of help there.
---
Well they at least need to hire a new marketing team as they are pretty bad. They need a new profession...like gardening or something.
---
I tried rerolling to see if levelling a gunslinger would be fun.  I'm maybe level 13 after way too long of play time.  Enemies are all ridiculously high level and ammo is a PITA to come by.  It was already difficult levelling my original character back when things actually gave XP.  I just gave up on the new toon.  No thanks.

2 hours a day isn't much. Do you balk at people who watch television for 2 hours a day?
---
No. I think it has to do with crafting a bunch of stuff while the carry limit is exceeded. I.e. if you can't even pick up an item because you are so massively overencumbered, then don't craft anything, especially en masse.
---
But that's just a guess.
---
Well what do you honestly want Pete Hines to say that Bethesda's PR team isn't going to tweet? Because he's going to say the same shit they will. It's a company, they aren't just going to let someone say whatever they want. 
---
It is a great game, you are wrong my dude. 
---
Not really, but I am more careful now. I am a little older and a little more choosy on who I get intimate with and I always use protection. Seems to have done the trick.
---
Counter argument is that at least you only have a max of 24 other players to compete with and 24 hour time window to do it in.  
---
I don't know. I haven't used the gauss much.
---
Is this true for Xbox also?  I'm sure Microsoft may provide that data for publishers.
---
I'm not sure that's entirely true, take any popular game right now like destiny 2, COD, Fortnite, gta, assassin's creed.
---
I should add that I have my distance sliders at half or below for most things except grass is max and shadow distance medium 
---
I'm currently using a hunting rifle. Level 7 in  a new game of Fallout 4.
---
No, they do not, as long as you take them out 1 at a time, you can still use them.
---
Sometimes you will need to place it in a world container and then take it back out again to trigger the quest.
---
Once the quest is triggered, any other TDs you pick up merge with the active one.
---
This is such a go-to cop out for developers. If you have a team working on the Atom store, while your game is languishing with bugs and sub-par balance, then move those people off of the Atom store, and move more people onto fixing bugs. 
---
It's not an excuse if you disingenuously point out that you are allocating resources inefficiently, it's just bad management. People say the same thing about Paradox games: "The people making the unit packs aren't the ones patching the game". It doesn't matter, you're paying too much to push out microtransactions, and not paying enough to fix the game. 
---
The people who don't exploit don't have mules so it's still unfairly and still dishonest (skirting around the game rules).  In this game you can't say harmlessly since Bethesda claims the stash limit was put in place due to server performance.
---
We get it, you are delusional
---
&gt; You have no right to complain that people are "dev bashing" and feign ignorance like there's nothing wrong with your game.
---
I haven't seen anyone pretend this game doesn't have problems. What I primarily see is people who acknowledge the issues but also enjoy the game, or people who are just straight up bashing the game with factually wrong or blown out of proportion "issues".
---
Saw a guy last night one hit the queen 3 nukes in a row :\ I thought that was fixed too
---
Ok, so after going over your list, your next quest should be reassembly required. You need to go back to Abbie's bunker, listen to her over the intercom, and pick up the holotape she talks about.
---
What is the incentive to farm stuff if that's the only thing to do?
---
I just bought the game and I'm really wondering this.
---
Instead I'm going to make a self absorbed post on why I'm quitting. I will expect lots of upvotes for karma and hopefully people spend a few dollars to give me gold to completely validate my opinion.
---
Does that include the legendary dog that spawns during SBQ fights that you can't hit unless you're using VATS _and_ are lucky?
---
And just like Bethesda, nobody cares about your opinion.

I watched my C.A.M.P get leveled so I had to rebuild which I spent (and still spend) a lot of time on. I wander and collect and i just love how mindless it gets. I literally worry and think about nothing when I play. That's part of the appeal for me. 
---
can't know if your right or wrong but do personally think the balancing has not been handled well.
---
They have that in Resident Evil?
---
While I really want mods and private or Lan servers I don't think I want them yet. My reasoning being they will most likely stop patching and fall back to the modders will fix it trench. This is a good time for them to get used to actually fixing bugs and not relying on or just accepting that a modder may as well do it. It's good for us because it's good for them to learn. And of course the more they learn about finding and fixing these things the quicker future patches may be and better implemented ones at that.
---
I am annoyed at the state of the game but I also get that it's basically a new team with new multiplayer that's brand new to the engine.
---
It takes 30 minutes because everytime you open your pip boy some scorched fucker is shooting at you from 100 yards out. kill the enemy, open pip boy, and you alerted another fuck who is shooting another 100 yards out. games is nuts and heavily flawed. I had my fun, but what is there to do anymore?

Cool, what‚Äôs your build? I might have some items I can give you.

People need to specific with their issues, most of stuff on front now has a very bad rant to points made ratio.

Or

The simpler answer is, they have different opinions.

Because there is almost literaly nothing better to do in game other than stop playing once you reach that kind of level

I would rather Bethesda do Bethesda's work and not use modders as a crutch like they have for over a decade. Get the modders off fixes and focus more on the other content we all really want.

This happened to me yesterday, too. Using my Blade of Bastet and smacking scorched that I *know* I one-shot and I swung it three or four times before the damn thing died. Of course it's doing damage to *me* no problem. I've kinda had it happen before, but it seems kicked up to 11 lately.
---
Yeah i meant ranged tho. Melee is super good atm.
---
No, I don't know what that one is.

Gauss is more power.  I switch between them and enjoy both.  Use my handmade for mid to short range and a lovely ski sword when I want to get personal.

" added up to all that there is since launch " - i did acknowledge that there's a lot of issues. i did not felt like putting down a list. you play the game, you know all of 'em. 
---
" Don‚Äôt blame the people talking about the game" - there's a huge difference between suggesting to people to let go and blaming them. if you have felt attacked in some ways, that's on you.

This. You can also use the bus, works best if it's already blown up. If it's not just keep an eye on the damage bar.

I have 2 1TB SSD drives in Raid 1 configuration with some big games installed.. ESO+PTS, Star Citizen, plus some virtual machines.  It all adds up. 
---
The issue is you build your perk card profile to fit a certain approach.   For instance, if you don‚Äôt want PA you will tilt your build in that direction.  Same thing with weapon choices and preferences.  You either like to shoot stuff or melee stuff and your perk build will follow accordingly.  So you make sweeping changes (nerfs) and your perk build is probably fucked. And you don‚Äôt want to level up 20x to adjust.  To me it‚Äôs simple.  Allow us to break up existing cards into increments of 1 or 2 or let us re-spec the build.  Doing nothing is a kick in the balls. 
---
Oh no, no no. That's not very nice.

Not gonna lie, Ive owned Skyrim on 3 different consoles, but its usually because by the time i get it on a new one, i dont have the old one anymore. And i love Skyrim. But its always full price which i think is kind of shit. 
---
I would rather that too, but as we can see they don't seem to be doing a good job.

I don't think you understand basic concepts of time and word definitions like "majority".

A fuck ton of people enjoyed destiny 2 dlc and I thought compared to this game it was lifeless, empty, boring, and repetitive.
---
I'm gonna guess you are one of those fortnight kids.. how anyone can say this is a bad game when millions of idiots play that trash game I'll never know.
---
I've seen people who said this was bad talk about how they love ark survival evolved (a truly broken game for years) and 7 days to die (which is the only game worse) then talk shit about this game.
---
Bottom line is people are holding this game to a different standard than any other game. This is much more fun to screw around with friends than any of the other games I listed, hugely.

14 was saved because SE realized they had an MMO junkie on staff whi was foaming at the mouth to make an MMO so they put him and his team in charge of salvaging. I sadly dont think Bethesda will be so lucky

I mean, sure, I bet they *could,* but how long would it take them? Three months in and we have no new content and they still don't have bugs fixed that were in the beta...

You are tasked with creating a new item (for the atom shop, but that is not important right now) based on an existing game. Of course you create a new record (or duplicate the base to make your job easier).

I do not want to bash a actual dev that did this edit, because I am sure that (s)he does not have much experience with with CE. I want to bash the project manager thought, that does not have safeties to catch such mistakes before they are pushed to the live server.
---
What? Unless a game is a massive cash cow, youtubers won't even spend a hundred hours on the game, whether they like it or not. They don't have the time to throw into it. I don't think you grasp the concept of just how much time that is. I've been a massive fan of the dark souls series for around five or six years now. I've played every iteration of it...I got the scholar of the first sin DS2 edition that moved a couple things around, and I got the original DS remastered despite owning the original already. Across six years of playing all of them, I only have about a thousand combined hours. I used to play a lot more back then too, sometimes as much as 10 hours a day. If OP played since beta, this is still an average of ~8.5 hours a day. Even if this time included idling and load screens and any other padding, it's still an incredible commitment
---
&gt;I mean you‚Äôre wrong, for a couple reasons too. One being if someone is being paid to do a job and they don‚Äôt do it and actually make a negative contribution than they should probably not have that job anymore.  
---
So because they're being paid for it, they should never make mistakes and always push out a perfect product? Also, ago exactly are you advocating lose their job here? Can you name a specific position that should be fired?
---
&gt;Also this is a company these people arent our friends and if people want to speak out about it they should voice their immense displeasure with what they spent their money on. 
---
This isn't Bethesda's subreddit ‚Äî it's made and run by the community. This is just a bunch of people bitching that they're not playing anymore. And those topics are fucking pointless. Do you think Bethesda is going to reply to one? Do you think that they don't know that people are upset about the latest patch?
---
&gt;And that brings me to your final incorrect point. If the newest patch drastically affects gameplay to the point where it is no longer fun and is different that what was presented earlier when previously paid for that‚Äôs kinda fucked. That‚Äôs like buying a car and then after the newest update you can only drive in reverse. It‚Äôs bad business. 
---
I really wish people would stop these comparisons. Buying a video game isn't like going to a restaurant, or buying a car, or building a house, or whatever. It's making a video game. The analogy straight up doesn't follow. Cars don't get updates.
---
A more apt comparison would be like when Blizzard accidentally pushed out a patch for Overwatch that had a memory leak. You literally couldn't play the game at all. Or when they removed Blizzard World from the map rotation because it was bugged. That also made the game worse and "different than what was presented earlier".
---
Sometimes patches come out and make games less fun. That's not illegal, immoral, and it certainly doesn't mean someone should lose their job. The entire point of pushing patches out is to change the game. Literally every online game does stuff like that. 
---
Works

Around 350h here, I guess 1/4 grind, 1/4 free exploration,  1/4 building more and more sophisticated camps (my current one, when nuked, needs three times repair all before it unglitches xD), and 1/4 PvP.
---
Yeah I agree with you, Fallout is my favorite series, so this was a real punch in the gut. At times, I can‚Äôt put 76 down, it has a lot of potential, and is the closest thing we have to a post apocalyptic MMORPG with a AAA developer that we all wanted. It‚Äôs just a shame on how they poorly managed it, and didn‚Äôt expect everything to blow up in their faces.
---
No, but I have a cool grenade launcher :)
---
Yes, this is basic information that modders and the devs deal with every day.  There are community built tools that let you browse the games internal files and see how the game is built.  These tools are limited, but even with the limited tools, modders are spotting bugs that the devs, with their 'professional' tools are missing. 
---
Mum's* m8
---
Thanks for the correction. Will make the edit.
---
I hear you.  I was grinding away for days and weeks and was finally able to build or acquire some badass weapons and then they dropped the hammer with the patch.  A bit disappointing but I am already adjusting and hope they fix this latest kerfaffle. 
---
I played Worlds Adrift for a while, not sure of the game's state right now though. Same kind of idea of players are the factions etc in the world. I'd go in with a friend or two though as you're manning an airship so being by yourself means your solution to pirates is likely just to run since you can't fire cannons and steer at the same time. 
---
if they're as bad 76, good riddance

Cool, bye.

That's not how it works. Your are vocal, and upset. That means the other side is silent, and opposite your opinion, or not upset.

Because we don't know the entire situation. We don't know what's going on inside the building. If your boss is telling you to do x y and z even though it's clearly wrong, but if you don't do it you'll get written up or fired by your boss. Should people scream at you to be fired when you're doing what you're demanded to do? No. We don't know what's going on inside so to say people should get fired without knowing who's at fault is childish. Obviously something needs to happen to someone but people will often assume whos at fault without knowing. So we really just need to be loud and vocal about the state of the game itself rather than demanding punishment of people who may be innocent
---
I see what you're saying now.  And you are correct.   But my original comment was about being able to sell the cap limit to vendors twice in the same play session, if the reset happened during that session. 
---
i feel ashamed for being optimistic for this game in spite of all the absolute horseshit that went on in the beta (server problems, being unable to reliably group with the two friends i was playing with, and all the bugs that persist to this day). there's a potentially good game in there somewhere, but it's just buried under so much broken jank right now.
---
When they see less players they'll just double-down and nerf some more stuff. Everything they've done so far makes it clear that they think the game is too easy, and that alone explains why they're losing players so quickly.
---
Hi ! You know what would be an awesome addition to the game? CONTENT ! I know right? Big surprise !

It's more like a turn based tactical RPG than it is like Diablo, but it has the same camera angle. I went back and played after I first played NV. I never finished FO1 or 2 though.

Did you watch the stream?. That's what he said. But he didn't specify a time as I recall, just that it would be later.

Use the High preset and Fullscreen I think - maybe lower distances? Lighting quality at Medium isn‚Äôt noticeably different and also gives me about 10fps.
---
Then make the tweaks in both prefs and custom ini again to apply ultra textures on top of high preset, should work -  it does very well with my 3gb gtx970

SSD also helps a lot, and closing browser/flash/Spotify/launchers/steam can help significantly

I travel on foot, and have naturally resorted to the last one (watoga up to harper's ferry, over to top of world and down to lewisburg). It's the fastest since the tunnel can take you to watoga far faster than the physical distance implies. I guess even in terms of fast travel this is the most efficient

I was thinking the same thing. I briefly debated leaving this sub after the torrent of "PATCH BREAKS GAME BETHESDA IS THE WORST" posts that did nothing to give constructive criticism, just to complain about something that's already being complained about in 4 other posts on the front page.
---
I stayed because of how great this sub can be though. When things are running smoothly the community keeps giving us reasons to play with showing off builds or giving tips or sharing stories.

---
I don't know if there is a way to automatically track hours played on PC but I'm probably at about 200 hours since day 1 of the PC beta. I play almost every day and only miss playing it due to responsibilities. I have two main characters I play, one is a Power Armor two-handed melee / commando build (around level 145) and the other is a level 105 one-handed / regular armor character. I can easily one-hit just about everything with either character and the right weapons / perk slots. One my level 145 I've done pretty much all of the quests including launching a nuke (we failed to kill the queen, however I had several disconnects in the process).
---
What do I do all the time? It's a combination of hunting down 3-star legendary enemies, Whitespring mobbing, crafting, SBQ fights when available, and then making the round to all 7 vendors to sell of the excess stuff and make a few caps. Over time I am slowly building my collection of 2-3 star armor and weapons such as Anti-armor Grognak's Axe or the occasional 3-start weapon that has a good legendary effect along with 90% weight reduction. In time I would like to replace most of my weapons with 90% weight reduced ones and to apply the ultra-light mod to all of my armor pieces.
---
Also, when I see someone with a bounty I fast travel near them to take them out. My average success rate is about 50% of the time with fails mostly coming from them exiting the server. I should note that I don't take their junk, I usually guard it for up to about 1 minute before leaving the area. Also, when I am in the mood, I will role-play as Jason from Friday the 13th and surprise / terrorize random players. I am now thinking about revamping my RPG efforts however I'm trying to come up with another one that I could make work (maybe Michael Meyers from Halloween?).

I don't even know why I keep checking this sub at this pint.  I keep hoping the game will turn around, but every patch just turns into a shit show.   Really only seems to keep reminding me on why I have stayed away.

There are a few different paths it can go down from here. I will be watching to see which path

---
Like I said, this issue has been happening to me since the bulldoze patch came out and two of my friends also have had serious stuttering and crashes with their memory usage up to 99% (using memory cleaner and razer cortex to try and fix some of the issues). I keep everything on medium now just to run the game, on high and ultra I was totally fine before the patch. Now I load in and get maybe an hour of play before the game becomes unplayable with 30 second fps drops and freezes.

Grafton for the mod, still havent found the plan.

In a sports competition you pay to compete, with a game you pay for a product.

Again, "muh cheaters" sounds good in theory but when you think about the amount of power you've given them with that excuse you realize your ideas are just bad in general. You even pulled a "but just don't do X bad thing" as an excuse for why fallible companies should have absolute power over you.

Hence why I did say that once a character is ‚Äòcopied‚Äô offline, they are 2 separate entities. After all someone could take advantage of bugs offline to take online.

It‚Äôs honestly the same issue as the PvP mode, just that adventure characters shouldn‚Äôt be able to jump to PvP due to how stupid of an idea it is.

Marketing is doing their job just fine trust me the hate train you see on Twitter is at most 10% of the fan base someone bought that fallout 76 jacket and just because a youtuber says that Bethesda needs to get its priorities straight doesn't mean shit Bethesda is a business and they have merch to push like those same youtubers who bitch about Bethesda's marketing push their own merch on you during their video or push their patreon 
---
Can I make a suggestion going the other direction? When using terms like ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù you need to cite figures of some variety. If I hear this tone without facts or figures I immediately think whiner. You may be right, and I certainly don‚Äôt agree with their launch timetable or attendant problems, but the reason these threads happen is people getting their feelings hurt over a video game, and that has even less bearing on developer decisions once the product is out the door. 
---
If you‚Äôre that pissed I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lawsuit out there that‚Äôll count you among their class. :(

You're the reason the game industry has declined, keep patting yourself on the back.

I think Todd has become such a poster boy for the company that Zenimax has him say anything they need him to, to have customers keep faith in the game before launch. Bethesda fans love him, and believe most of what he says to be fact, but just because he said all Studios worked on, doesn‚Äôt mean they all collectively focused on developing it.
---
Here is something to process... It used to be 40 atoms for the 7600 hours.
---
For some reason, someone, somewhere felt that 40 atoms was too much to get for playing the game for nearly a solid year, so they halved it.
---
Yeah.
---
I mean, I don't want to rely only on "it didn't happen to me so it can't be true" because there lies a path of dumbassery. But what is worth a little quirk of the brow is that we're not seeing *enough* complaints for it to be something as simple and widespread as mass-crafting.
---
No, you just described the people that come to this subreddit to complain for **months**. If I take my friends or family to the movies and drop $60 and the movie is terrible, guess what I don't do?? I don't come to Reddit to complain about the movie for **months**.
---
Face it, the literal whiners and cry babies are what they are for a reason- they'll take any tiny detail (like some guy complaining that the vendors sell all plans) and claim "look how terrible it is! I'm not going to play this because of reason x, y, and z." And the reality they need to realize- no one gives a fuck what they think.
---
At this point I'm looking at a ton of cry babies that are trying to justify their dislike of this game. New content is coming, and if Bethesda wasn't catering to the whiners, we'd probably be playing it already.
---
So they whine that there's bugs, so they focus on bugs. They whine about features they want like the plans, and Bethesda does what the majority wanted.. and you've got more whiners. Whiners there's no content..
---
Bottom line is this: the **players set this game up to fail.** They wanted fallout 5 and they didn't get it, so they've been condemning this game since the **fucking beta**. It's a damn good game for people who wanted to play fallout with friends, and if you didn't.. you shouldn't have bought it. End of story.
---
Everyone could have been well informed before they bought this game and not bought it if they truly weren't interested. I initially wasn't, but I tried the beta and was happy. And it's only going to get better as long as Bethesda stop catering to self entitled brats.
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **1st Cakeday** golyos! ^(hug)
---
Maybe we just have different values then, because I am a more practical person and would seek to get a new one. 
---
I dont know, I think if they showed any signs of improvement then maybe but this is just a downhill, and they dont really care at all that people like you are still making an effort. Besides, in actuality its their rust bucket held together with duct tape, not yours. 
---
&gt; I've managed to get by just fine staying with in the carry weight.
---
You've managed it, but have you enjoyed it at all?  How much more fun would it be if you could just trade with an alt, and dump everything on him?   Then you don't have to have that dialogue of "I really want this weapon, and I can use it in the future, but I'm overweight and my stash weight is too high."  
---
How many times have you said this to yourself?  I've said it thousands of times.  So many weapons I've wanted to keep and play with later, I've had to drop or sell.   If I had a mule, that would've been so handy, but I wasn't about to shell out another $60 for it.

---
You may not realize it, but spam crafting vanilla items like weapons or armor was (maybe still is) the trigger for how most all of the duping methods worked. The dupers would spam craft like 400-500 items really quickly to destabilize the server and disconnect the character in order to facilitate the duplication process.
---
Technically the method did in fact duplicate all the crafted items, but that was a byproduct not the end result.
---
Lulz. Says the guy who said "I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be done medical condition or learning disability." So now you cant spell or add? I mean, I can blame mine on autocorrect, what's your excuse?
---
Plz &lt;3
---
He didn't need Bobbleheads to one shot you before the patch.
---
Same here! Had few few hours to play game, and yeah... 
---
Pretty swell of you to assume that no one complaining actually got a shit bag, or the shit bottle, and of course they're all dupers.
---
Of course, they're *all* crocodile tears. There's no way any of the people complaining here actually experienced anything they complain about.
---
This game is totally fine. This is all just outrage culture.
---
...douche lol
---
Yeah this looks screwy.  I feel like they want everyone in power armor end game even though they haven't come out and said it.  Hopefully I am wrong.
---
While I'm not sure about a belt, I would probably pay to watch some beatings take place for their sheer ineptitude. 
---
Hey Bethesda, fuck the Atom shop, start airing Pay-Per-View dev beating sessions. I'm sure you'll get more money out of it. 
---
Wait they did? I've been on this sub for a decent amount of time lately but I guess I must've missed that
---
I personally think the number of people logging in has been drastically reduced. Every person I know that has the game and has had it Long enough to be level 100 or so has quit logging in. 
---
I log in every once in a while now, usually for 10 minutes or less.  Long enough to look at my friends list and see that almost all have stopped playing. 
---
Serious changes are needed immediately. Even if they were to fix the major bugs and revamp all weapon damages, there is still a huge problem with player interaction. 
---
The screens are clunky and tedious, the lack of dedicated servers all but destroy player ability to be vendors, the in game economy has been destroyed by glitches existing from titles that used the same engine nearly a decade ago, cap limits have complete destroyed the value of caps, etc....
---
There is also a huge issue with all legendary items. They completely negate any reason to craft any armor or weapon past level 50.  This is a large part of the games content, which if we are honest is severely lacking. 
---
I feel your pain man.
---
My buddy specifically said he was staying away from TSE just because it made things too easy.
---
He had a "meh" gatling gun that was just explosive.  Now thanks to the nuke nerf, he's having to burn tons and tons of ammo just to kill normal enemies.
---
They should've done a League of Legends balance to the patch.  Buff some builds a little, nerf some builds a little.  Then see what the community said.  Next patch they can do a little "more" balancing to the builds.  Until at some point the community stops talking about "this build is way way way too OP" and "this build really sucks".
---
The thing is, "true fans" would criticize the shit out of the game. Because if you truly love a game you would point out its flaws in hopes to get them fixed to make the game BETTER! Who doesnt want a better product?
---
yes and about the barbarian perk not working with mutations and class ffreak? and how can we buy the 9800 caps neon sign which were sold from time to time at watoga but now that it's no longer randomized it's isn't sold anywhere...
---
I'll wait until it's fixed before buying.  Like every bethesda game it's going to be an unfinished piece of shit on an extremely outdated engine from the 90s.
---
I don't get how so many folks have an inventory problem honestly. I just pick up materials that I need. I bulk and sell everything until I get to a comfortable point. If I don't use glass, I keep maybe 20 in the stash. Granted, I've got 200+ of screws, springs and gears, but I burn through them quickly when it comes time to repair. 
---
I've got about 400lbs of junk, and the rest is extra weapons / armor for other builds or for selling. Occasionally I'll move my extra junk/gear to a mule character, but it isn't terribly often
---
I‚Äôm in a nuclear bunker but of course you can sing your neon green song through the wall. Oh I can even be shot though solid concrete... or hit by a scorpion sting
---
Yo ho ho, bitches. I won't get the Bethesda launcher anyway. When they become this anti-consumer, well, consumer will fight back. 
---
That is the money question to be sure. They are adding something in the presently inaccessible Vaults at some unannounced later date, details were pretty vague.
---
There is of course the PvP. Though the PvP has no real reason or reward to doing it. And certainly there's a million better games as PVP combat goes. Fallout gunplay in general, and the horribly off-balanced RPG elements really should drive anyone who isn't crazy off to any other game built around a PvP focus.
---
The majority of live-service games definitely keep a looming threat/promise of new content out there though, and Beth hasn't really said much other then PvP servers in March. Warframe's something of a master at it, some of the stuff they talk about on devstreams doesn't come out for a year, or comes out completely different, but there'll be at least half a dozen upcoming things people are trying to get kitted out for. Destiny has all its upcoming DLC stuff laid out in an annual pass (as much as that carries some negative weight, its also confirmed content). Monster Hunter tends to hand out six week calendars of upcoming stuff, and has on several occasions, also hurled some out of nowhere addition with an hours notice.
---
Other then fixing their bugs, Bethesda's main issue is they need to get some communication up and running, with some sort of idea of where they intend to take the game. Which right now has just been PvP (which even the PvPers seem mostly to say they're doing out of boredom on here), and throwing seasonal gimmicks in the Atom shop.
---
Take Warframe for example, it's entire game map is randomly generated from a set of tiles designed to link up with each other, it would be very easy to generate vaults from this method and no that hard to get it working for other dungeon types
---
Note difficulty is different from the amount of time it would take to do this, the concept isn't anything new and any programmer worth half the money they pay them would have an idea on how to approach this problem, a small team could get a prototype working in a few weeks and from there it just takes level designers and artists to provide tiles for the random generation
---
Dude trump should ask you to build his wall.
---
This was quite an impressive wall of text bro
---
Sounds like you had a frustrating day.
---
For discussion's sake, here are literally the first two things BGS could have done that would have neutered that griefer while not pissing off the majority of players:  
---
A. Prevent stacking bobbleheads / magazines - using additional bobbleheads should improve the time you benefit, not the amount of benefit  
---
B. Move Explosive to the same loot tier as Two-Shot so it would be one or the other instead of neutering two separate types of weapons.
---
Thoughts?
---
With speed demon, pain train, and all rise in pvp it‚Äôs fun as hell. They can‚Äôt outrun me, I can stagger with pain train, and all rise finishes the job nicely.
---
Look, Do you really want me to explain every thing that you do wrong on the sub-reddit?
---
and I have a question: what the hell is the point of writing this type of post? I understand if you have a complaint but you took time and effort to write this like damn Daniel 
---
Bethesda hasn't had my trust in long time, I trust the modders though.
---
Since they aren't stepping up their timetable, they may as well let mod community step in and fix it for them (like they usually do).
---
This is a major issue I encountered playing yesterday that never used to happen before. 
---
Are we Beetlejuicing?  Can I be in the picture?
---
Sorry. Just skimmed didn't read carefully. 
---
Oh sure,
---
Here's my addition - Camp got griefed, 100% destroyed.  Moved camp to new location, got 6x copies of it in my stored camp section.  You know how long it takes to place and delete 6 complex camps?  (I was at about 680% stored budget!)
---
Big gay* 
---
You misspelt  your username.
---
Why would one person with multiple accounts be different for the server than multiple people with one account? It's the same thing to the machines.
---
Nah I've never played fortnight. And I'm not a kid.
---
I did play Destiny 2 though....Destiny 2 has many defects but it doesn't have all the bugs F76 has.  The Destiny2 game engine is modern not this antiquated BS F76 runs on.
---
F76 is bad it's pretty obvious once you understand most of the core mechanics have huge design flaws/bugs. It's a shit show.
---
6 months of hard work, with good results, and a stiff upper lip for criticism.
---
Pissin' in your wheaties ain't a mistake.
---
I agree.  As a normal armor user, the White Knight buff sucks.
---
Fortunately for me I'm on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits constantly trading, so I have tons of caps in case I need to buy more ballistic fiber.
---
But 90% of the user base doesn't go there, so they're stuck farming it and buying horribly overpriced bulk ballistic fiber from the vendors.
---
So thats what you do when we arent playing together, illegal omelette runs....
---
Yawn
---
Your comments make no sense and if you can't understand the purpose for posting this I'll assume no a mount of explaining will help.
---
Good day. 
---
id use them if i could get the recharger rifle, or the mod that can "save" ammo back, that would be pleasent
---
Stable Flux lasts forever. Raw Flux expires rather quickly if you don‚Äôt have Good With Salt (L.) perk. i am unsure the timing on that. google will have it haha
---
I had an explosive radium rifle. I complained for 2 weeks that my gun was far from OP and that the combination of TS and Explosive was the problem. Most of the community ignored my pleas while others just accused me of buying my crappy non TSE.
---
The community didn't stand up for the players who only had a TS or an explosive. I have zero sympathy for those who have fallen who didn't stand for me.
---
Same, I'm back to playing a heavily modded fallout 4 and I've been having a really good time with it!
---
I had hoped the same thing. But sadly have no info. 
---
I feel like this is where I am currently at. :)
---
It's not new. People have been criticizing Bethesda's shoddy practices for ***years***, but have been largely shouted down by the community as a whole "lol, those aren't bugs, those are fun quirks that I don't even want fixed!" After a while, I stopped spitting into the wind and just learned to like Bethesda games for what they were. 
---
This is what I'm doing. 
---
Going to hold off on Conqueror for a bit until that's got some non-raider options and whatnot, but in the mean time I'm going through and figuring out all the other mods I want and getting them to play nicely together haha.
---
If you don't want people to express any emotion about the game, ban all expressions of emotion about the game including enjoyment of it.
---
Bethesda brought this on themselves by encouraging positive emotion using hype and youtube personalities.
---
It's been observed that if people are emotionally invested in a something , once they get to the point that they are so frustrated with it to give up on it they have a negative emotional view of it.
---
I know, right?!
---
check out Borderlands 2, if you havent tried that.
---
Im level 111 and even with every gun in my inventory being TSE i still struggle even with Prime weapons
---
I agree
---
For the sake of that person in charge of that then, I hope (s)he was a newbie with no experience being thrown to the wolves so (s)he could have a little bit of mercy on him/her. Otherwise then yeah, I agree something needs to happen. Sorry, I didn't know that it was literally explained that a dev fucked up
---
hence the long load after loading in world waiting for everything to spawn, don't dare open pip or move.
---
Freedom of choice...  
---
But like I said, one last shout into the void before I turn off the lights and close the door.  
---
&gt;Banning people left and right
---
source? is there even a single confirmed unwarranted ban yet? or is this just more baseless drama kicked up because some hacker/cheater/exploiter put up a sob story?
---
see this happening in every game. supposedly, that game, is the worst offender, and they no longer care. always. it's the same story over and over again, ad naseum. know how many times it turned out being true? once, for me. wow, out of what... couple of dozens titles.
---
feeling very skeptical here. something i missed?
---
People kept bitching about TSE and everything else. I hope you guys enjoy the changes that the game ‚ÄúNEEDed.‚Äù I‚Äôll just go back to BF4 till Anthem comes out. 
---
Oki thx
---
And what about the people that didn't complain about TSE?
---
I have a TSE build that I wasn't even using..........that got nuked.
---
So throw everyone under the bus because "some" people were hating on TSE?
---
Trust me, if they keep this nuke nerfing up, no build will be viable within a month or so.
---
&gt;lower down the armor of enemies but make them hit harder at higher levels 
---
This! More clearly, I'd say scale the damage enemies deals with the level of the player being attacked. So if a ghoul attacks my lvl240 character, then attacks my lvl50 buddy, it should deal me \[far\] more damage. An elegant way to make fighting as a team far more compelling. I'd also like to see enemies spawn at mixed levels according to the levels of players involved. Have lower-level enemies target lower-level players while higher-level enemies target higher-level players.
---
I really believe the spongy enemies need to be addressed as a more fundamental balance issue. There are other suggestions I'd make:
---
* a more thoughtful TSE nerf (restore TS to +100% but don't let Explosive benefit from Demo Expert and it should only affect one projectile per round, not every pellet in a shotshell)
---
* nerf melee so its no more viable than any other weapon type
---
* major energy weapons buff to be as viable as any other weapon type
---
* major explosive weapons (grenades, grenade/missile launchers, Fat Man) bugg to be as viable as any other weapon type, but make Mini Nukes scarce
---
* equalize the perk point costs and benefits across weapon types
---
* add legendary Power Armor and/or give us Dense for PA torsos
---
* buff Marine Armor
---
‚Ä¶and that's all subject to debate and adjustments, but my point is that even after bringing weapons into balance (which you should, as it would make both PvE and PvP more dynamic, unpredictable, and more strategically demanding), but we'd still be dealing with tedious PvE.
---
Speaking of tedious PvE, can we please get some new combat mechanics with Scorchbeasts? They (especially the queen) should be a challenge of quality (strategy and skill), not quantity (of bullets and armor/weapon repairs).
---
Oh and while I think loot should be instanced, instead of simply giving everyone who hits a target once the same randomized pool of loot, how about multiplying the total loot given out by the number of players who've hit the target, but instancing it out to each player according to whatever percentage of damage that player dealt the target?
---
Sorry, I'm just rambling now.
---
thank the lord. You act like you are cool but you are prob a 400 pound man living in our mom's basement.
---
"good day"
---
I'm genuinely curious how people find the time to write multiple pages worth of gripes and sink 300+ hours in a 2 month old video game. Is a video game worth that much? 
---
You're making this claim with absolutely no knowledge of what projects they're currently working on, how much time those projects are taking up and how much time and resources they would be able to spare on Fallout 76 while also ensuring that their upcoming projects stay on schedule and on budget.
---
There's far more things to consider than "tHeY cAn tOtAlLy dO iT", but that requires critical thinking skills.
---
Game Pass makes the console a must own IMO, you did him or her a favor. My other two are only used to play their exclusives now. 
---
Late 40's and both the wife(level 90) and I (level 140) play. Kid is grown so we play every night and weekends-a lot. Unfortunately, we have not played since the patch and probably will not play. Everything we enjoyed about the game was removed/changed. I used to look forward to getting home from work and playing until bedtime. Now, I do not even want to load in. It is a shame that on a PVE game, you have SO many people that like to tell you how to play... We just want to relax and have fun. TSE was something that made it fun for us. We didn't grief anyone and went about our own business. Did we enjoy one-shoting stuff, hell yes we did. Once those weapons were obtained, the game got even better for us. I worked hard and spent ALOT of caps to obtain the PA plans and now, they are just there for the taking. We both had our little hustle, mine with plans/guns and hers was apparel ( go figure ). I could go on and on but at the end of the day, reality hits and we understand it is just a game. It was decent while it lasted. It was by no means a good Fallout game. However, it was the first one that allowed us to play together which was a plus..
---
I spent a lot of time defending this game in hopes Bethesda was going to work hard to fix the game. I got in a lot of arguments about it. And while I legitimately enjoyed my time playing this game it‚Äôs become clear to me that I need to step back for awhile. I hope that at some point the game is in a good state but I just can‚Äôt keep investing time in it until then. 
---
They could have just taken their time and released it in late 2019 without all these huge problems. Some people wouldn‚Äôt like multiplayer Fallout either way but a stable build would make a big difference in the overall feeling and outlook towards the game. It can be fixed and it probably will be but they have to stop the bleeding and quit going backwards. 
---
According to buggedthesda ,yes ,you should.
---
ITT: A bunch of whiny titty babies.
---
This should‚Äôve been posted in the beta or the first week or release it‚Äôs crazy you guys are just realizing this
---
I'm sure that's part of BGS's plan. But as to when this will ever happen? It's probably safe to say that most BGS employees can't even guess.
---
It will be used in a future event. FYI you can already get inside of it via a glitch....
---
They'll fix it, by bringing back the scrap-mods issue.
---
You‚Äôre wrong. 
---
What is this Anthem game i keep hearing of? Why is it so hyped?
---
Agreed, there's an interesting zoom effect in the boarder areas too that gives it a bit of depth 
---
Nobody hates the modders who are trying to fix this game. People hate big headed horrible cunts though...
---
I absolutely adore this change, and I don't at all understand your criticism of it. If you prefer body shots to head shots, torso is still where the system defaults to before you switch to any other part, and it will stay there *until* you switch. 
---
I, by contrast, have a low fire-rate weapon, and I not only want but need to confine myself to head shots, to the point that I'm definitely willing to move, or wait a moment, to get the head shot ‚Äî both of which I can do with Fallout 76's VATS but couldn't in Fallout 4.
---
I very much like this change. It's one of the few things this patch got right.
---
So youre taking the opposite of what the expression means, backed up with number you made up, to provide "tangible evidence".
---
I get it know. I'm arguing with an idiot. Peace
---
What gun? This is some post patch video I did after the patch. It's a instigating dragon / tse dragon / tse handmade / ts handmade. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D7km3qIhHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D7km3qIhHg)
---
They still decent guns imo. You on pistol?
---
Casualties of war like myself. I got thrown under the bus also.
---
Again in the last 2 weeks few people stood against the decision to nerf TS and Explosive individually.
---
How dare you suggest something completely reasonable to me üòú I wish Bethesda justified it a little better upfront though. They indicated their team wouldn't be aware otherwise which comes off as a direct lack of effort on the issue. 
---
Not a great idea to post your full name and email address buddy...
---
Warframe spent a lot of time to make it work right. And they still couldn't do random stuff in their open world ares, and I would call them experts in this sort of thing.
---
Fallout 4 vault dlc would work for this, but tiles a way too small for it to be effective. 
---
What about mod *plans*
---
Because some *plans* for mods are not included in the list of plans for vendors that used to carry them. 
---
The Grafton vendors, for example, used to randomly have plans for the combat amor BOS mod. You‚Äôd have to server hop but eventually could get these plans.
---
Now there‚Äôs no new plans at these vendors when I hop. Just the same long list of plans that I already know.
---
Some things have been moved (or removed) and of course they didn‚Äôt address this in the patch notes.
---
The ride never ends.
---
It's good news for people who engage in short distances where a headshot hit% is sufficiently high. However, it sucks for those who picks on distant targets in VATS to build the critical meter. 
---
They did it was a mistake mistakes happen i can already see the YouTube videos on this from youtubers who have never published a game but are going to tell us how Bethesda should have published this game 
---
And at that note, Bethesda says, "Hold my beer, and watch this." right before they release Patch 5.1
---
A TSE, Armor Piercing Handmade with a Prime Reciever. 
---
Despite all the issues, it was the lack of end game content that drove me to stop playing in late December. Hard to say I didn't get my money out of it though, same deal with my friends. We played for dozens and dozens of hours together. Only had one who put it in once and never played it again but that's on him as far as I'm concerned. 
---
Here's something I was wondering after seeing the shots of the Unstoppables, does the Mistress of Mystery outfit count for this?
---
It only suppresses the negative effects for an hour with the serums. I could be wrong about the times. You do still get negative effects regardless of the way you obtain the mutations. 
---
Enjoy your Slaying. We'll be Silent Ghouls. Lucky you didn't organise such in your country. Very Lucky I'd say üëç
---
I never had a TSE weapon and I kill them just fine with my lever rifle. I use Weapon Artisan to repair my weapons and Fix it Good to repair my armor.
---
I had gotten this issue before, but only a couple of times. I didn't play a ton since the patch so I don't know if it's more frequent now, but I can say it happened to me already within an hour of playing. I'm even able to fast-travel (so obviously no enemies are around) and when I arrive at the new location I still have [Caution] up.
---
If everyone is wearing power armor it's easier to sell power armor skins!
---
But TSE did need a nerf.  Not a nuke nerf, but maybe a 20% across the board.  Then see how it played out.
---
Other builds like melee need a 20% nerf.  Some other builds like energy weapons and normal explosives need a 20% buff.
---
If people are protesting that there's too much trash in the streets, and the lawmakers make dropping a paper wrapper on the ground is a $10,000 fine AND 5 years in jail.............who's really to blame there?
---
I would say the lawmakers over-reacting to a protest, not the protest.
---
Theres a cabin above where the Red Rocket Mega Stop is. Id say a bit NE of that cabin is an unmarked campsite in the mountains. Found 3 foxes there yesterday üëå
---
I played Skyrim on PC and then on Xbone, never tried the PS3 version.  Bethesda games are always a little sketchy on any platform though. hehe
---
That's a trick though. If you just try to build the normal way it doesn't work. We need them to add more variants of the keypad door. Some suggested doors with a keypad on each side. I want them to add one with the keypad on the brick side (just like OP). 
---
So not getting the negatives previously was a bug?
---
Offline modes won't incentive people to buy atom store swag, that is why it's going to be the last thing they provide. It's really as simple as that.  
---
As do I, though I haven't really played for about two weeks. Last time I was on I got a disconnected when a SBQ was about to die. The bugs and server instabilities have greatly diminished my motivation to play.
---
It worked out I had to transfer all of the crafting materials for it from my stash to my actual inventory for some reason
---
They nerf not everything, try melee, it got a buff!
---
Jetpack bug is back, fly around like ironman and kill everything with yout 1 hit super sledge...
---
Careful what you ask for.  From what i hear once you enter that suite the overpowering desire to build walls takes over.
---
The negative is increased hunger and thirst. Not sure if it shows up or it a UI bug, since additions are sometimes hidden in that screen also.
---
I hear you, my friend. Humor is my only way of dealing with these crushing realities. Stay strong!
---
Sorry, complaining about this is the new "end game."
---
I tried reading it but my eyes went out of focus and well, it is not a magic-eye photo.
---
PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT:
---
People could stop pre ordering games.  I feel like the propensity for unfinished games to get released increases when companies "know" that the product is already sold before completition.  Maybe we will get real DLC from companies now as opposed to paying $30 for the rest of the game that you should have already received.
---
What do you guys think?  Does this sound like a decent idea or would it not matter?
---
Interestingly enough, he loves the game pass feature. He's been a PC only gamer for the last 7yrs and is getting able to play all the great XB and console specific games he's missed out on.
---
This is a thing?!?!
---
Oh for sure. I wait out the load times if I'm not in danger of getting murdered. As soon as everything else loads in I start playing. 
---
How far have you made it in game?
---
Never heard of this.
---
What they were supposed to do, is copy the code for the red headlight, and edit it into an atom shop item for the new moth man power armor.
---
What they actually did is change the original headlamp into the moth man power armor item, and lock it to the atom shop. 
---
So now any headlam that shares the base code with the red headlamp can not be equipped without entitlements from the purchase of the mothman power armor (Which is not on sale yet)
---
I personally once saw the Dali Lama walking into the Rio Casino in Las Vegas. 
---
I'm 99.9% sure it was really him.
---
Any chance at all it wasn't actually him pales in comparison to how good this story sounds on the internet.
---
I would imagine that uninstalling a game you're "done" with is something that would happen not as a form of protest but simply because that's the rational thing to do.
---
I wouldn't call it trash. I no longer play it though because it is indeed boring at this point. Reading this subreddit is more entertainment.
---
I think those are both great and legitimate ideas!
---
To be honest, I think a weapon shooting projectiles that are damage unrelated to the weapon is kind of a silly idea to begin with, no?  Explosive should be extra damage but it should have always been tied to weapon damage for the world to make any sense at all to me.  A level 10 machine gun putting out more damage than a max level/modded non-explosive was too much.
---
Of course, they thought they would be rare! So many *lucky* players, I guess!  ;)
---
Buy the Ultracite Gatling Laser from Watoga (if you afford the 20k price tag) that thing melts Scorchbeasts. 
---
Im lvl 236, and i dont have any problems, maybe you should just aim better lol
---
Which they didn't do, but thanks for letting me know. 
---
Frankly, the only way to fix this system is to eliminate the duping. This is a Bethesda problem. They released a buggy mess and are making their players pay for it with bans. 
---
It's almost like this game was published by EA. 
---
Wish they had spelled this out in the patch notes. Thanks for providing an answer that makes sense.
---
The nerf was needed. Point blank. However, it was nerfed TOO much. A good way of nerfing instead of making TS and E 25% (75% reduction) of what it used to be, what they should've done is nerfed each prefix separately by 33%, making them do 66/100% damage they used to do, still good and viable but not OP. HOWEVER, if both prefixes are together; TSE then it's nerfed to 50%, halving the damage output instead of quartering it, again making them still good and viable instead of OP. You still get a good benefit from TS and E by themselves at the 33% damage reduction but with TS and E combine on the same weapon, it's slightly more damage reduction to make up for having two insane hard hitting prefixes. It'll also encourage others to have weapons besides TSE if you're willing to sacrifice a bit of damage for two additonal prefixes that can benefit you in a different scenario. if that all makes sense
---
Well yeah, and have the doors available for metal walls too, but I was telling you how to do it NOW, not never when they fix it.
---
Yes! But I am a Space Cowgirl ;)
---
I have way better games to play...
---
Level 70
---
Bethesda said that the atom shop is "just cosmetic stuff." If there is a set of mothman power armor with  damage resistance that is no better than the X01 and it has a jepack, they can still claim that this is "only cosmetic." 
---
Sure, the chance of finding an X01 jepack in the game is abysmally low, but it's still there. 
---
They can say "monthman power armor is just cosmetic. If you wanna get a jetpack with power armor that has the same damage, all you have to do is server hop for six hours." 
---
It destiny/warframe Meta Ironman suit..
---
Already own the plans

Oh, the engine can do it. We know the engine can make dynamic walkable tiles and walls because camps.
---
What scale the engine can do those dynamic objects is where the tossup is, baked in geometry and walkmesh is a lot less resource intense then having to constantly track positions vs changing objects. And whether their server architecture can run an instance for people to be raiding different dungeons, or everyone in one lobby would be sharing the same ones.
---
Destiny 2 for instance (a much newer engine then Bethesdas) did throw in an RNG dungeon. But it was limited to a few interchangeable chunks of a really long bridge. Which could just be that they didn't put the effort into more, but also could easily be a hard limit on how many of those floating platforms they could have going at once.
---
The most obvious route is to force a player/players to go through a portal or door to the next section, and just teleport them around a big mess of prebuilt rooms (Lost Woods in Zelda is a classic example). That kind of means they'd need a separate map basically just to have them all laid out though.
---
&gt; that they think the game is too easy
---
They're right though... in terms of any kind of challenge, FO76 is a joke.
---
There is no pressure or tension over resources. Food, water, even Stimpacks drop like candy.
---
Enemies are completely stupid and either just stand there firing short bursts with ranged weapons or charge fearlessly at the player to melee.
---
Yes, it is a bug. I see the negative effects disappear while using "Class Freak" perk card (while not in a party) but you'll also notice that the mutations won't work. Taking the perk off and/or joining a team will fix it.
---
Dude, I'm right there with you.  I have a group of 3 co-workers that I game with and I convinced all 3 of them to pre-order F76 with me so we could play the B.E.T.A. together.
---
Now 2 months later we're all done with the game and I feel bad for convincing so many people to drop $60 on a game that we're already done with.
---
It's interesting that you think buying a copy of a game gives you the right to determine that game developers should leave the industry.
---
Go to settings, challenges, character, the first challenge is an hour log, till you get to 7600 hours. Then i dunno what happens. 
---
I‚Äôm having major issues with my weapon damage. My powerfist say 240 one minute then drop to 158 then something else. Have melee mutation 25% extra damage and I know weapons degrade over time but this is something else. It‚Äôs like my mutations not working + degradation.  I heard certain diseases are (rad worms) are causing issues. These problem persist for me even after removing the disease. It affects all my weapon though not just melee. I‚Äôm on PS4 pro
---
You're complaining that you spent 5 hours glued to a game trying to overcome an impossible obstacle with friends; and you would rather spend that time continuing on with the monotonous dead content. 
---
I dont understand how you can still find new and interesting things to do in this game after logging 500 hours. You're either lying or content with being bored and doing the same thing day and day again. Experiencing a cheater/griefer in any game sucks but it at least changes things up. And all you had to do was put the game down for a little while but you dont know how to do that
---
You're right, it's the same to the server.
---
But it's different to the player. You're not going to run around Appalachia 1000x over-encumbered. Instead, when playing a "real" character you'll dump the stuff that's least valuable to you, most of which will disappear. When playing a mule, you'll keep all that stuff, thus increasing the load to the server any time you're logged in as your mule. Which of course you're not doing most of the time (I assume, haven't done it myself), but multiple it by everyone doing it.
---
Performance is half of the issue at most though. The effect on gameplay and even balance, is that some players have a limitless inventory of items to draw from and swap between (especially relevant as balance patches are released), while those of us playing as intended‚Äîwithout mules‚Äîhave to face the consequences of the decisions we make with our inventories.
---
Yup a contract, even one much more serious done in person cannot violate the law, look at the long history of NDA's getting shredded in court when whistleblowers get sued by the company they blew the whistle on. You can write whatever you want in a EULA/NDA/Any other contract, whether or not it is enforceable is another matter.
---
what's funny, with all the hate and vitriol that they spew, when the next Fallout game DOES come out in 2,3,4 years , they'll come crawling back 
---
First they came for the TSE builds, and I laughed at them‚Äî
---
¬† ¬† ¬†Because I was not a TSE build.
---
Then they came for the explosive builds, and I laughed at them‚Äî
---
¬† ¬† ¬†Because I was not a explosive build.
---
Then they came for the armor builds, and I laughed at them‚Äî
---
¬† ¬† ¬†Because I was a PA build.
---
Then they came for melee‚Äîand there was no one left to speak for me.
---
You get acid from bags of fertilizer, not the raw fertilizer that is a basic crafting component.
---
I appreciate your outlook, but I have gotten too old to have the patience for this. I‚Äôve already unsubscribed, but I admire you staying to fight the good fight. Cheers!
---
They received it. They said submit it in 4 days, not submit it and everything will be fine.
---
OCD is a hell of a mental disorder. 
---
Bad touch.
---
I was looking at going melee. Not sure which one to invest in yet. Keeping myself open to options. 
---
Zenimax Media Inc (the parent company of BGS, ZOS, and iD) is privately held. They do have to report to some private equity firms that invested in them, but they don't have "shareholders" like a publicly traded company.
---
You should be able to.  What you can't do is put it backwards at the edge of the foundation.  So add another foundation square in front of where you want the door and then it will let you turn it around.  After you place it, you can remove the foundation square.
---
Im slowly exploring the world. Im level 148, just few day ago I joined BOS. Quests are surprisingly difficult to do as there's always distractions, and I don't like warping around the map with FT.  I do use it plenty though, I like hopping into events. I think I've played something like 400 hours, quite a lot, though I've spent a lot of that time idle too, hiding in a corner, browsing the net. Still played quite a lot.
---
Few day before the patch I found my second explosive weapon, it was 3 star ultracite laser, weighless and anti super mutant, not even max level but kinda decent with it's high rate of fire, now after patch it can be mostly used just to easily tag enemies, it's so little damage. Most of the time I don't try to farm legendaries, even though I do wander around and look for legendaries to kill. And sometimes I do hang around in nuked WS to farm them. But most of the time it's exploring, looting, and gradually doing quests. Maybe 1/5 times there's a nuke, I join that.
---
Here's the gun just few days ago. My first explosive is still very neat, explosive instigating revolver. But it's damage got halved, down to about 140.
---
https://i.imgur.com/PXgGJsG.jpg
---
If the game wouldn't have this duping business it might be worth to farm legendaries or junk, but now, just don't feel like it's worth it, I kill what I see and take what I find, mostly. There are somethings I've never done, mainly server hopping. God I hate loading screens, and this game doesn't like when I alt+tab out during one, often the game runs into lower resolution if I try. So I don't. I wouldn't server hop anyway, since I'm not farming anything.
---
Same. I feel frustrated that I spent money on this game in the first place. But when I was wandering around by myself, the glitches weren‚Äôt so bad. But then I convinced by best friend to get this game and that was a mistake. So. Many. Bugs. Broken quests, teammate disappearing from server somehow while still playing on it, spawning naked, undamageable enemies, and more. I feel so bad that she also wasted money on this game just for me...
---
Must be just you, I have no problems with either.
---
Last I heard, Bethesda was owned by Zenamax, and that's a private company.. so no share holders.
---
"youareahuman" isn't intolerant, as being a human doesn't have negative connotations. Maybe you read it as intolerant because you have negative opinions about homo's? Also, what about homosapian? you are a homo can have multiple meanings. Do you get offended at things often?
---
Scorchbeasts tend to have a LOT  of armor while they are in air but super easy to kill after they land. I know Timmy the TSE power gamer, it didn't die  in 5 seconds like it used to.
---
Wait a second. So you're saying there will be no difference between 40 int and 25 int when crafting PA?
---
Maybe this is the real reason the nerfed TSE weapons?   I'm half- suspecting to find weapons in the Atom shop that are equally OP in the near future, while all in-game weapons are nerfed. 
---
Huh didn‚Äôt think about dodgy. Even without that perk do you have die doing this? I‚Äôd love to spam mini nukes and missiles at hordes of ghouls and other nonsense enemies that love nibbling on my shins 
---
Yup. Everyone in prison is innocent. Didn't you know?
---
Are people really too stupid to understand that there is a difference between TSE and TS w/o E?.......E w/o TS?
---
Yes TSE was OP.
---
No...... myself and others whose shit got nerfed didn't have TSE.
---
This community is ignorant and that's why you all deserved to get your shit nerfed too.
---
I'm calling it now:  This game is dead by Fall 2019, w/ servers shut down by 01Jan20.
---
I hope I'm wrong.  I still have the game installed on my computer, and I still check this sub regularly.   I keep hoping it'll turn around like Conan and No Mans Sky (From what I've heard.)   
---
But they gave been fixing bugs.. fuck, they claim they're still fixing bugs even though I haven't experienced a single bug in a month.
---
I just want new content or features. I'd rather have it now and it be a bit buggy, then have it later because you know it'll *still* be a bit buggy. I've been playing this game with zero issues since the month after release (occasional crash, not enough to frustrate me).. I've finally reached the point where I'm bored, but it has more to do with my friends feeling burnt out.
---
I'm not a fan boy, but I'm sick of all the fake outrage about this game. It's far from perfect, it should have had more content at release.. but I'm pretty sure they had content ready to be released from day one, and they had to switch gears to bug fixing since that's what the community demanded.
---
Oh yeah, that Grafton robot, I always forget about him. Thank you!
---
LOL- You would bounce *a new one* off of the wall and break it trying to play 76?
---
Matches the actual game. 
---
Is the level of testing of this hot fix going to be of the same quality as of the patch itself?
---
I mean, if your QA missed the fact that the patch had a build from a month ago then I am not sure you even need them to test this hot fix. 
---
Your guys have phones right?
---
This is the same type of fuck who writes these stop crying essays when the game was announced. You guys are the same broken record with different text. The community has the right to bitch just as much as they have the right to praise the game. How about STFU about the community and move on.
---
I honestly don't think it's the whole team there that's the problem.
---
It's the management.  They make the decision and the team does the work.
---
I love Fallout, but it's time to change out whoever is LEADING that team.
---
If they'd do something like I proposed here, the community would be a LOT more happy:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/)
---
It's not a support ticket though it's a bug report.
---
The developers are not going to be following up with Aten directly for more information or to let him know the issue has been resolved.
---
I would get that before patch using explosive handmade 
---
It's not really *completely* different. I also just linked one of the first ones I found, because I was in bed and didn't feel like finding more.
---
Good to see some fixs coming out. So when do you plan on fixing the guns that you broke.the gun build got killed but not the melee build that can do 1k+damage this is so unfair to the gun build people.yes the tse needed the damage put down but not killed like you did. The melee builds as if wright now have a unfair advantage over the gun build.
---
PA is not for pvp. You will be outclassed once the player base matures. 3 star armor is better. Hell 1 star armor could be better.
---
Get a bloody sledge. Triple your damage.
---
I rock a 3 star sledge, ive got 2/5 piece of cavalier+ unyielding. The rest is 2 star unyielding.  The goal is 3 or 4 pieces of cavalier and unyielding and 1 or 2 pcs of assasins unyielding. Chameleon helps too. Slap it on if you keep getting seen before you see the enemy player. I keep one chameleon on me but i dont consider it part of my loadout. 
---
PA seems to be mid game gear. I only use it for farming flora in nuke zones. I eat PA users in pvp. They are easy targets. Big yellow targets. 
---
They were supposed to copy and edit the new copy. Instead they just edited the original.
---
being its like this across all platforms, it's not your hardware.
---
Because some fanatics don't want to admit any criticisms of Bethesda or the game. 
---
Yeah I know. But that means he just lied. Or perhaps he *wanted* it to be like that.
---
I don't know.
---
stfu, seriously. Most of us have had a blast for the first 100 hours.
---
The problem I had with youtubers was not the criticism but the mindless meme repetition of people that never played and never wanted to play the game . 
---
I was critical the whole time but there‚Äôs a difference between a measured response and calling people retards for liking the game. 
---
There are still parts that I like, but especially the last ‚Äòpatch‚Äô was an unmitigated disaster. 
---
If I had done something like that to hundreds of customers, they would not even let me back into the building to clear my desk.   
---
As all things should be.
---
eNeRgY WeApOnS aRe ThE FuTuRe
---
Just kidding, I think you're right!  They're getting there, though!
---
It's absolutly a Zetan. I was "lucky" enough to have the body of the first one I killed glitch out in t-pose, meaning I couldn't loot it (boo) but could get a really good look at it (yay!). It's a Zetan in a hover suit, wearing some purple-glowing goggles. You can even blow off it's "chest" and see his feet.
---
Maybe it is but only started after last patch.
---
The ghouls have been able to get on top of the bed long before the most recent patch, at least on PS4. This is why you should go on the wall by jumping from the hedge. 
---
I got that recently when my items were bulked. Had to scrap the bulk first.
---
&gt; I was telling you how to do it NOW, not never when they fix it. 
---
I understand, and appreciate that. TBH I don't like how the white side looks and prefer the brick side on the outside.  I've tried a few tricks to get it to work already, but it always ends up looking... well bad to me. I was actually planning on putting the password next to the keypad like a house number, I only wanted it for aesthetics since I prefer to leave my CAMP open for everyone.  
---
mehhhhhhhh
---
ahahah very smart!  This is a very interesting problem to solve
---
Glad I didn't buy that shit! Fuck bethesda!
---
See, this is why your analogy wasn't that good.
---
And what i try to call for here is to voice real points. Game is unbalanced - how? In what way it show? What you want to be done about it?
---
Same for models and ai.
---
Your car analogy for the frontpage posts: 
---
- my car doesn't work.
---
- what's broken?
---
- it doesn't work. 
---
I do have good with salt, and I have Thru Hiker at level 3 because I carry a stupid amount of cooked food.  So it lasts longer and takes less weight.
---
To the people who are answering "nothing" I'm curious as to why you'd continue to come to this subreddit and comment.
---
Friends talked me into playing. 5 hours of game time and I quit. I think it sucks to lose $60, but I learned that I'll never buy another game till it's been out for at least 2 full months. I'm never going to do a pre-order again for certain. It's just not worth it. I appreciate the lesson.
---
This is just a plain combat rifle.
---
The patch was 2 steps forward, 15 back.  
---
Another commenter told me it's the free states part where I give a holo to Rose that I'm missing. I'm 90% sure I have the holo, but no quest 
---
Yeah that isn't how it works.
---
What? Improve the game? No, no, I think we'll just nerf all other weapons so they're as bad as energy weapons. That'll make it balanced, right? /s
---
Here‚Äôs a little tip, build a huge collection of barricade near your house drop a turret in the middle and any Scorchbeast that do attack will completely ignore your contracted house giving you ample time to kill it. 
---
Embarrassing.  I remember when being banned from a game was punishment, now I envy the dead.
---
They've already made their money... and want to spend as little as possible on post launch PR. It should be very obvious by now... 
---
So were they just reduced in the amount of time they last or take effect?  I don't understand what the nerf was, I can see the time change, but i don't understand what it is changing, I guess.  I live off of RadX and RadAway, so I'd love to know what is up with that.  Especially since you need so much in the blast zones. 
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt have one of the best guns in the game the pal, nor build
---
His criticism is sometimes you want to shoot one body part, then torso the next because it's a more accurate shot than another headshot.
---
Really, it's just that he's used to playing one way, and now he has to play another. That's all the criticism really is. And it is valid, it wasn't really a *necessary* change persay, and he has to relearn a basic aspect of his gameplay.
---
I like the new system too, but I understand the frustration.
---
Not a bug. The serum suppresses the negatives when you first take it, but there is a time limit. After the time limit expires you get the negatives. 
---
Ill be swimming over with my gun collection to collect those :P
---
I've never gotten it to work. I saved every one i ever found before i did the BOS questline, and they still sit in my stash useless.
---
This version of the game seems pretty ‚Äúbeta‚Äù to me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Killed two super mutants yesterday, one with a Gatling gun and one with a mini gun, and their bodies despawned before I could walk up and loot them. That sucks because I need heavy weapons for mods. 
---
My tin foil hat theory is that the game isn't for us, not right now. We are the beta testers and whether or not we buy anything or quit outright doesn't really matter. In a year or two the game might be developed enough to be like No Mans Sky with people saying "it sucked at release but they fixed it and it is fun now." Fallout 76 is for *those* future consumers, not *us* who are playing right now. 
---
Toss into a theory that I've read here than they needed to work on development of their online multiplayer engine and their monetization system. In that way they got us to PAY THEM to beta test it. In the long game the quality of 76 doesn't even matter, it is just a stepping stone for where they want to be in two to five years. 
---
I assume this was to make the perk make them lighter.
---
I made a post on how they should do balance changes.  If they'd take the League of Legends approach to it, people would be a LOT happier with balance changes:
---

Are you actually specced into sneak? Also you understand that enemies can hear you right? 
---
... Then don't play it.
---

---
With the latest update some needed addons, and I was alright with the concept of the TSE nerf, but it got so nerfed its taking 2 shots point blank with a level 50 shotgun to even kill level 16s now... And now with Bobby pins going back up in weight I dropped like 50 of them.. And atleast make it worth crafting ultracite receivers because currently the hardened version that doesnt require ultracite does same damage as ultracite
---
Wasn't my analogy. I just said that to show how your justification was even worse.
---
Didn't notice any difference with max sneak and 10 AGI yesterday.
---
Level 70 in this end game world is impressive...
---
I'm still using my TSE Handmade with rifleman(x3) maxed out, and my vamp dagger for being up;close and personal.
---
Yeah I have an anti-armor one that did like 310 damage before the patch. Now around 256 I think. I have a soft spot for the weapon because the constitution was my fav quest in fallout 4. Love that ragtag robot crew 
---
Well elder scrolls 3 used netimmerse fallout 4 fallout three (obsidian) oblivion was gamebryo that 22 year old engine.
---
I wonder if you listened to the holo and just went to Rose, if she'll kick it off when you talk to her.  Could be that she's the trigger - can't recall since its been a while for me.
---
Nerfing quality of life for the sake of artificially increasing game time and life of the overall game is a terrible, counter-productive trade off. 
---
And that‚Äôs assuming they had some thought prices going beyond ‚Äúdur hey! These numbers don‚Äôt match!‚Äù
---
"Agile software development" 
---
They directly impact your DR, not damage, so unless your DR is different, or they change the way DR affects damage, you are imagining it.  Keep in mind, both of these perks stop working if you have class freak and certain mutations due to rounding issues. It's possible they were removing that issue.
---
Then why bother with that?  Why not use the other powered door and put down pressure plates inside and out?  Then you don't need to put in a code at all.  I mostly want to keep the molerats out of my house so they don't chew it up, and visitors always leave the door open.
---
Accidentally reverting fixes is amateur level shit. We can (and do) expect better from a studio that's been around for almost two decades (or more than 30 years in case of the parent company).
---
It really is as bad as people are making it out to be. The game has been a trainwreck every step of the way so far. 
---
The return on investment in a video game is fascinating to me. You pay $60 and get entertainment for as long as your attention span can handle. Very few other things can provide that value. 
---
Same here. I've been quite enjoying it, even though I know it should be better. The constant disconnect issues were starting to wear on me though, and with this last patch and when I tried to build a handmade from the recipe I'd just bought, but couldn't use my bulk junk, I just had to laugh.. 
---
It's definitely getting ridiculous though, in an almost comedic fashion
---
I hope this gets upvoted more! I am having the same issue but SKIF222 might be right as my three weapons that keep getting un-favorited are ski swords.
---
I mean, this is more of a conversation than most of those threads have.
---
"Defending Bethesda doesn't 'help' the series!"
---
"Yeah, you're right man. Fuck Bethesda."
---
Great discussion. 
---
Yeah sorta. So each game has three sets to get them all. So I have three boxes that are 101 from 3, another 3 boxes that are basically the same but have vault 111 on them for 4 and they released the first box of 76 but also the first box in a limited glow in the dark. 
---
That last part is exactly how I would do it, load times would be fast because of the small tile sizes and as long as you don't have too many different tiles the server shouldn't struggle with it
---
If it's the same bug I get the fix is to put all the materials needed to repair in the same place. Sometimes they all need to be in the stash sometimes they need to be on my person.
---
You realize that mods aren't coming until private servers correct? And private servers aren't coming until the end of the year.. so why are you "helping" them if they didn't ask for it?
---
They've got their own punch list of things they've got to do, and you screaming for attention to tell them things they've likely been working on before you even brought it up.. 
---
Why do you feel like you need to be part of the process, before what you have to offer is even needed? I get you want to help, but either apply for a job if you think you really have something to offer.. or realize they've probably been busting their asses to keep this shit storm from getting worse.
---
I mean fuck man, your post is obviously just *trying to drum up more issues*. If it isn't, you should have worded it very much differently. I wouldn't be surprised if they made a point to ignore you and your people for good, since you're only creating bad optics.
---
It's a fucking company, with procedure, and if they wanted your help I'm sure they would have noticed.
---
no you are not.
---
I‚Äôm not new. I have all my sneak perks, invisible Armor, and played since beta. Something is off. It felt off instantly after the patch.
---
People complaining about the game have the same rights to complain as you do to complain about the complainers.

I'm level 43 and got griefed the other night and my C.A.M.P. completely destroyed by a level 200+ just before the recent patch. I play with my SO, mom, and bro and we are really chill and friendly. I don't get players who want to ruin the game by griefing other players, especially low level players, but I am happy to say the majority of people playing have been super helpful and friendly. Please feel free to quest with us whenever you are on--we'll protect you and help you out! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
But I do know what your saying. If they do it, it would be more of a funko thing. 
---
Definition of ‚Äústicking it to the man‚Äù.  The hero we need but don‚Äôt deserve.
---
I find it incredibly sad that people do not understand the move from selling the software on disc to selling the liscence to software that can be revoked at any time and the reasons why this is something as a consumer you should not want. 
---
This change is only good for the owner of the lisence the product they are selling is now incredibly lessened. You will be unable to play Fallout 76 as intended in 10 years time, you will be able to play any other fallout game though because it is yours... why is this difficult to understand the concept of ownership?
---
Brilliant! 
---
I was wearing shrouded wood armor before the patch, and removed it once the patch installed ‚Äî I still get the stealth movement speed buff provided by the armor. All shrouded wood armor is currently in my stash, but providing the benefit. 
---
All of my Atom Store purchases have been with atoms earned within the game.
---
My two cents. I feel they should un nerf everything and buff energy weapons. For PVP there should be a dmg cap. For instance 250 dmg and up will only take 25% health and anything with less dmg output would be incremental up to 25%. So no matter what all gunfights would take at least 4 shots, which would be fun as hell. They already have the logic somewhat with the way slap dmg is set up. 
---
Game is designed to make money not fun
---
They likely don't and I'd go so far as to say it would be beneficial to spend your earned atoms if you aren't buying anything because they definitely compare atom sales to store purchases, the bigger the disparity the better the message.
---
Taking inspiration from the campaign to bring back the tv show Jericho I have a proposition for all the people out there who have had enough of Fallout 76, Todd and his B.S. and the weight of bobby pins:
---
Today I went to Amazon and ordered a pack of bobby pins and sent them to 
---
Todd Howard,
---
C/O Bethesda Game Studios,
---
1370 Piccard Dr #120, 
---
Rockville, 
---
MD 20850, 
---
USA 
---
It cost me ¬£3.36 including postage. Maybe you should consider doing the same. If you have Amazon prime, you could get a box of bobby pins to Todd today, with free shipping! Why not give it a try. From personal experience it felt great!
---
Thanks for listening,
---
C.J.

on console not really, lots of us, it is a library of years of collections. no need to delete if you don't have memory/storage issues.

Unfortunately, in my experience since people who fast-travel in load so close to the bus, i have seen far more people panic under ghoul attack and blow it up by accident trying to defend themselves than i ever have seen SB there.

Because I want it for aesthetics lol. I like the high tech look of a keypad door. It's the reason I bought it.

Many of the listed issues may not bother my gaming, but if there's something making the game hard for hundreds of players, I'm upvoting. We all paid money, we should all be enjoying the game as much as possible. The Fallout community is a friendly, helpful one (except for that 420 guy that killed me for my workbench, but I digress...). The community is a good one so I add my voice to others on this site that need help with a specific issue. Bethesda should care about profits - the current problems are preventing many purchases from happening. No doubt it's difficult for Bethesda right now because Fallout 4 and other games were so universally loved, but having great products creates great expectations. Hopefully Bethesda sees this site as a problem solver, not just a bitch session, and aggressively works on listed issues to improve our gaming experience.
---
b-b-but TSEs were op /s
---
Exactly what happened to me. Toss in "oh another terminal with 15 entries, yeah I'm kinda sick of those."
---
&gt;  sell everything 
---
That's a problem itself without a lot of server hopping.
---
I think the main problem is whoever is LEADING the development team doesn't have any experience in other online multiplayer survival games (Ark, H1Z1, WarZ, Rust, DayZ, etc).
---
If they'd switch their development to something that is more balanced and fine tuned (and actually put out some content), they'd get a lot better reaction from the community.
---
I made a post about it, check it out :)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/)
---
fully speced for sneak. have chameleon on as well, armor mods for sneak,
---
Not a clue what you mean on 2 shot, they seemed OK in vats when I sniped stuff?  ADS on my handmade semester to work OK as well.
---
Your only argument that it is an exploit is "Because I said so".
---
Here's mine for why it's not. 
---
The character does indeed have a storage limit, you can't just hold infinite items on one person. You have a carry weight and even if you wanted to exceed that you still have the recently implemented hard cap of weight you can reach before you can no longer hold any more. The only difference between OP's mule and your character is yours is probably a higher level. Following your logic you should also be banned, if you have stuff in your inventory and not in your stash then clearly that stuff can't be counted against your stash limit and thus, exploit. 
---
What do you think you're adding by posting here as someone who has not played the game and isn't planning on doing so in the future.
---
Are you on ps4? I‚Äôm in need of some water! 
---
Im in the area midway between watoga and harpers ferry on a level with whitesprings. Its 7 caps to harpers ferry, 11 to watoga station, 5 each to sutton and morgantown from vault 76 and like 9 from sutton to whitesprings. Some where around 40 caps for all.
---
Let's be real and honest if u need to craft cause your mule is past 1500+base carry weight in mats, either your a massive hoarder, you duped shit or you got items from a duper(directly or indirectly). In 2 out of 3 cases the ban is deserved. The case where you got it legit, kinda demands you to be reaaaaally hauling ass and never giving up materials, that on itself makes no sense. Also even grabbing every single item you come across &amp; dismantling it would never make you reach 16k in weight, so i honestly think OP is a duper caught late case.
---
Why did this happen Bethesda you use to give a shit about your fans
---
Hahaha, I meant that sarcastically.
---
Oh I see, that's a bummer. At least I don't have anything good that is not a legendary that I might accidentally scrap. Thx for the answer!
---
What gets me with those posts are how many people are just consolidating and rehashing issues they never experiences and based is solely on someone else's post.  
---
Oh, they are creating assets? Looks a fuck of a lot like simply importing exiting assets from FO4 to me.
---
It looks like a bot.
---
Serious backlash for the first time?  I don't think so.  They took a hammering for FO4 and a massive hit for bugs in the \[PS4\] version of Skyrim.
---
But we can get meta if you like.  You telling us how to behave in a conversation online?  Really?  If we like the game and want to defend the company you're exactly who to tell us not to?  
---
There's likely only one thing that will cause change at the company: a hit to the bottom line.  They've taken one in the drop of prices, and the low sales.  They'll take another in the hit to Atom Shop purchases.  Complaints and backlash online have been happening since B.E.T.A. haven't they?  Yes, they have.  And this has done what?  Well this week it got us a backstep patch.  
---
So consider affecting sales.  That may take a while, it may not be seen until the net launch when the game sales are affected by the reputation hit.  
---
But as a fan of the game, as a gamer in general, and as a denizen of the internet I'm sure as heck not going to change what I say online because other members of a public forum don't want me supporting a company in some way.  
---
I've been objective.  I've posted my issues, and I've posted my complaints.  But, even if I hadn't, I am under 0.0% obligation to do anything other than I want.  Maybe you might have said, "Please don't..." Likely wouldn't have mattered.  But, damn.  Ordering us to?  
---
Nope.  
---
I'd sell you all out for a pouch of screws and a bit more camp budget...
---
I have all the same perks and have no problems at all. Maybe it's system related. I'm on ps4, what about you?
---
I'm not interested in getting into a discussion that turns into anger / trolling, but in good faith.  
---
1) The 6 Articles are a good start but they also show how overwhelmed and out of touch they are. Best example is the TS(E) "Inside the Vault" that caused them to knee jerk retraction (Honestly don't think it was a mistake). I do expect more.  
---
2) They promised it, it's not unreasonable to expect it...  I'm an author and have a few mods that have Hundreds of thousands of edits, resulting in likely a million plus changes, I am painfully aware of how hard it is to track every change, but they keep including stealth nerfs and changes that are important, and are failing to mention,  
---
If they are being included by accident, it reinforces the fact they need better tracking / logging to avoid mistakes like we keep seeing.  
---
3) Again painfully aware of how hard it is to keep track of every change, but with the frustration and outrage in the community they need to follow through on their promises until they have rebuilt trust.  
---
4) You read that wrong, I'd like them to allow us to give them a file, ESP override with fixes we've found. Done in a save and even "Firewalled" manner it would cost them little, and could reap them major rewards, why waste time on the "little things" when we have been doing it for them.
---
5) I actually understand, again painfully.   
---
I have one mod that at first seemed simple and it took me hundreds of hours and nearly a year to properly rebuild. A second is still pending an update after a more than a year and a half... With thousands of people angry they've not gotten new content.   
---
But what I think you're missing is there is simple, low end stuff, that is time consuming that Bethesda/Zenimax could source from us.   
---
6) I don't disagree in part, but until they have "All hands on Deck" they should accept the help that is offered, and many many Online games in the past have used the community, as we have offered, to their Advantage. Dating back to UltimaOnline and EQ Dev's directly contacted OP/PowerGamers to help to balance / catch bugs before they were abused extensively.
---
Nobody is happy these days without participating in group-related OUTRAGE daily. Okay you are mad and you feel "massive grief" over this game, but what do you want? are you not going to be happy until everyone has joined the OUTRAGE? 
---
Have you got much experience with bug fixing in online games? 
---
If the product wasn't working as advertised then vendors would be refunding it like they did with no man's sky. The game is online 24 hours of the day, you can login and play it give or take a few disconnects. That's literally working as advertised, balancing and content are things that need to be worked out as the product is being used.
---
 I'd maybe care if this was going to be the state of the game permanently but they literally said content updates for this game were planned would be free before it launched. Imagine WoW had done that back in vanilla. 
---
Sold!
---
I'm gonna win this war for us! You're all gonna pay!
---
It wasn't a justification, it was pointing out a bad analogy, or a poorly worded one. 
---
Same on XB1, but the hate train won't hear of this.  We must be mistaken and they never got up there before.
---
Isn't the problem also that people are kind of blaming the wrong people, as the people who are making Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield are not the people who are currently working on FO76, as that is taken care of by the people who where making the cancelled game few years back, aren't they the people who are working on the updates for this game currently. So people blaming the ones who do Starfield or Elder Scrolls, is just wrong, as they are not currently doing 76 and thus they shouldn't be blamed for it currently. 
---
Personally I would like to play the game, but the constant negative things you hear about it all the time has made it really hard to play it as all you hear about it is bad things so it takes away from your enjoyement and makes you frustrated even though I enjoyed it.
---
There should just be a ghoul mutation where you don't take radiation damage but have increased limb damage or something like that.
---
i had my camp next to the pond in the golf course for a water source. cleanest area ive seen so far. but everytime i spawn i have to deal with the mirelurks. 
---
thank u man
---
Well, not everyone.  But lots of them.  In their defense they did complain before the patch, too.
---
over 200 hours..but..after work..dinner errands..you can definitely get an ample amount of hours in before bed..and on the weekends..after errands are run we obviously have more playing time..this game is or should i say 'was' extremely addictive..but lately i havent been playing much at all..on monday only about an hour..and yesterday i logged in..and logged out in 5 mins really had no desire to play at all
---
Thank you for the post! We have a lot of really awesome content coming for you with the Vaults. We're working on a roadmap to show when these things will drop. I hope to have an update on when that roadmap will appear soon.
---
ITS all ok.. Because this is what happening now because they Nerf and keep nerfing weapons / perks .   
---
I have friends who now feel it is NOT worth the time and effort to go on Queen hunts to get good drops. They are BUYING them on Ebay.   
---
Why waste time / ammo  trying to kill something that just broke ALL of your guns Wasted all of your ammo that took a day to make. AND now you have to fix Power Armor..   Its easier to just go buy the Plans / Legendary weapons and Armor you want.. and NOT waste all of 2 days getting Armor / weapons fixed, and spend another day farming for lead / steel for ammo.   
---
Im just saying .   Nerf it so its not worth time and effort.  
---
People will find a way to get it easier.  And its not going to be the way Butthesta wants it to happen.    
---
Don't get me started on the infinite loading loot box for up to 5 miniatures on a real lagged server.  Just to find out you got CRAP one star wood armor :(  
---
Yaay..     
---
ya.. I see their point.  not worth it. 
---
What about adding an external keypad and have it power the door?  Maybe that would be a look that you like?
---
When you say a "bunch of weapons" how many would that be? Just trying to get a ballpark of what might be considered an excessively high rate of item creation.
---
I create food and healing salves all the time (x2 chemist with a 30% chance of a super duper proc) to vendor at 5 caps a pop. I'll spam the button for water gathering but as of late have been pausing between each craft.
---
I like doing the Lewsiburg to Big Bend to Watoga route as well.  Especially since it is bookended by a paid of vendors.
---
I agree.  I accept that grind is a part of the game.
---
But on that same note, the game doesn't become MORE fun the more grind you add to it.
---
I do a lot of trading on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  I have a lot of caps from trading so I'll be able to buy ballistic fiber when I need it.
---
But 90% of the player base isn't in those reddits.  They're stuck figuring out how to farm ballistic fiber when EVERYONE else is doing the same thing.  That means more server hops, more farming time, and less fun.
---
I think they should lay off nerfs that "nobody" was asking for.
---
*buy a game and expect it to be good without tons of bugs; when it has bugs that aren't being fixed or come back after "fixing" things with patches, makes a post saying how Bethesda needs to get their act together*
---
"HURR DURR FUCKING ENTITLED WHINY ASSHOLES DON'T LIKE THE GAME I DO NO MORE!"
---
Be careful with your crafting. If you do it too fast you might get your account suspended like that other guy who was using Super Duper and making gamma guns to scrap them for mod plans (an ironically titled perk if you think about it)
---
Hi Matt, what console are you seeing this on?
---
Awesome, this worked. I appreciate your help very much! 
---
The Scots are probably pissed they stayed, now.
---
I'd like to just come and say that people who defended the game this long are anti-consumer parasites and don't actually help the game thrive in anyway whatsoever. Those who call critiques whiners and crybabies need to look in a mirror as they clutch their pearls for a dying product. 
---
To anyone on Xbox that wants a buddy or just to team (or just need a server anchor) by all means look me up. I‚Äôm level 127 and can help defend you, rebuild and help with missions although I won‚Äôt fight for you but I‚Äôll fight with you. I‚Äôll make sure you get the drops you need and want cause I have most of what I need and want. I share perks and being on a team helps with staying on the server also.
---
Xbox: reznorkhan

(Central time on most evenings after 5pm and a lot more on weekends)
---
You're right, I will definitely buy it, but he did say something that should be true. We need to stop preordering. I have tried my best to be an anti-preorder person and advocate, but I fell for Bethesda's shit with 76 because, to me, Bethesda could do no wrong after 4 straight excellent games in a row (elder scrolls and fallout). Now as much as I have loved them in the past, they must fall under the rule of no preorders like all the other companies. 
---
Pc
---
Oh shit, that's terrible. I have that perk on! I love that perk when im crafting healing salves for people. :(
---
yeah, I'm experiencing the same issue.  
---
Sneak is broken after the latest patch, crit meter is bugged too.
---
What level were you when you got the plans for it?
---
Wow, Bethesda keep surprsing me in awful ways. Last game I buy from them thats for sure. I became a laughing stock for my friends (and hate of others) for convincing them to buy the game. Just imagine something like that happening to one of them...
---
It's not going to be a PR disaster. It'll just be shrugged off, because we have no expectations left for this game. No patience, no hope, nothing. It's okay for a little bit early on and it can be fun. But once you're around level 30-40 you'll start getting bored. And once you google it once you'll find controversy upon controversy upon PR disaster upon bug fix rollbacks upon "balancing" changes that make the game more tedious than it already is (and BOY it is tedious already). I understand that you're concerned for the game but as far as most people are concerned, the game is already dead. 
---
I‚Äôm a stealth rifleman as long as both perks are up and on it works just fine 
---
I do miss the explosive demo perks
---
Really? Would you happen to have a link or something for me to find it?
---
wtf are people upvoting this garbage post.
---
Lol, something something fools and their money....
---
Anyways, Elder Scrolls 6 is right around the corner guys! Dont know about you but I‚Äôm pumped. Make sure to preorder! You wouldn‚Äôt want to miss out on the next BIG thing would ya?!
---
Don‚Äôt you know today is ‚Äúcircle jerk hate for BGS‚Äù day? Loosen up bruh 
---
I dont give a shit. 
---
They should have not made fallout 76 but instead gave the engine to obsidian and let them make another fallout. I like fallout 76 but stopped playing bc there are better games out right now and 76 wasn‚Äôt interesting enough. I hope the devs handle this game better in the new year. 
---
&gt; But lots of them.
---
If you cannot prove this with actual data, you're just making up shit to justify dismissing people. 
---
I'm not deleting them lol. Why would I?? I'm kicking ass lol
---
Wasting money, that'll show him!
---
No the analogy was fine as it is easily understood and a perfect reference. Your argument that you want a reverse only car aludes that you want a less functional game. He got it right.
---
Try server hopping.
---
If you get a server where you're the first person there they'll be lower level
---
Yeah that's what I meant
---
Pure speculation, could equally be doing fuck all but drink coffee and taking their time over things...
---
It seems to be an intermittent bug. Server hopping can fix it if it occurs.  Not sure if stealth is effected in normal gameplay other than that one instance I had where I could not hide for an entire session. 
---
They told us in their marketing material that if you preordered the game you would get full access to the beta. Yet the day before the beta it was revealed to be timed. Obviously the whole canvas bag drama with the Dark Rum shit. People felt misled pure and simple.
---
I‚Äôll help you in an hour
---
I have had more than one mob me there before the patch too. I think it depends on where you stand. There's a sweet spot that lets you swipe at them with a super sledge and not be hurt, but its really hard to find and maintain.
---
Eh yeah, movies are one time thing for me...games are another and they will be discussed or " whined" about as long as it's relevant.
---
If you like a franchise you're gonna be vocal about it's lack luster performance and on going quality problems and shit communication by the developers, and no one is going to stop complaining, also in all the complaints and comments on f76 that have traction don't blame the game for not being fo5, you ignorant idiot
---
Also i assume the developers have many branch/departments dedicated to certain aspects of the game from bug fixes and other glitches to future content and patch releases.
---
Now ask yourself, what's the point of making a game or supporting it with new costly content? with no major fan support? ....Maybe that's why the department in charge of releasing new content hasn't announced shit and the game is essentially on life support already, if they had any content they wouldn't be making all these "fixes" and would be releasing all the "content" you keep mentioning or at least they would be teasing it and keeping the hype up, why aren't they doing that?
---
*The point is:* this game is not good, it is subpar quality and the majority of fan know this and they don't support this game, blame the whiners, blame the haters, blame the supposed disappointed fo5 players, blame it all you want but bottom line is this game has already had its time to shine and it didn't catch enough players for the developers to give a fuck about new content and the few players left that are satisfied with this crap are the minority
---
The arguement that "it's going to get better" is in itself a clear indication of the game right now. 
---
It would be one thing if they charged a monthly fee - keep people grinding = more money.  But, a one-time purchase + more grind = No thank you.
---
So...
---
You don't think this is a bad sign *at all* when this game launched less than 3 months ago at $60?
---
yes. means you're full of shit.
---
Yea im def not looking forward to more nerfs, its not really even needed when they can just cap the amount of dmg done between players. 
---
&gt;this patch should have set off some alarms
---
Those alarms should have been blaring and red lights twirling much sooner than this.
---
Who knows? Maybe they'll fix it but un-fix it in the next patch too. 
---
The post were a little overwhelming but this is even more ridiculous and stupid and a horrible comparison
---
I have an account over 4 years old, but lost the password and was having trouble recovering it so created this one a couple weeks ago. Zamzy is the other, but still no karma on that either. lol
---
Aw my feelings
---
I wouldn‚Äôt list to any of the comparisons. It‚Äôs just a real fun and quick paced game you can play with your friends or by yourself with randoms. It‚Äôs also actually different gameplay wise than anything I‚Äôve seen.
---
There‚Äôs an open demo this weekend if you want to check it out. Just keep in mind the build you see is about seven weeks old now, and it just kinda throws you into it without explaining too much. 
---
Yeah, you can remove the hat and wear any other headpiece instead.
---
I think a balanced approach would be:
---
We should be able to LOCK our items in our pip boy so they can't be scrapped, dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Then any legendary items we have UNLOCKED should be able to be SCRAPPED for a 5% chance to pull one legendary modifier off the weapon.
---
People can now farm and grind to their ideal build.  Bonus is it makes mass duped weapons LESS valuable.  Why go for a duped weapon everyone has, when you can effectively grind your perfect weapon for your build instead?
---
Did not get around to trying this as the suggestion below worked, I appreciate the response though! 
---
Thanks! Hopefully the RNG Gods shine on us all
---
Have you tried building a shack around your garden? 
---
Found the TSE user...
---
I hope that is not the case.  Hopefully Bethesda rolls out new content in March with enough ‚Äúwow‚Äù to pull folks back.   I would like to be playing this game for a long, long time.  
---
I don't either :)
---
It's strange, all sorts of random people who rarely post here, have come to say their good byes, and similiar. It's okay, but seems so melodramatic. And I don't understand how serious people are and do they think a lot of people really care what they do with their e-life.
---
&gt;Don‚Äôt buy their next fucking game. 
---
Unless you want to :) People are still individuals. People like different things. People don't all agree on everything.
---
&gt;Skyrim is my top favorite game and even if their next release is a long awaited Elder Scrolls game, Bethesda can blow me
---
I don't think there's no IFs. I recall it was mentioned which comes out next, and it might be TES 6. I think it is. 
---
You say that now, but if you liked TES 5, how would you not like TES 6? Be honest, silent if you don't want to say the inconvinent truth.
---
It's single player and will quite likely be very similiar to TES 5. Hopefully they bring lots of engine upgdares from this game, into it. Depends on how they've managed their code.
---
Do you mean the keypad switch with a powered door? I've been trying to find a good way to build that w/o killing off too much of my adhesive farm. I haven't tried messing with it since the last patch. It may work now since they fixed the wire budget bug. 
---
Same. It‚Äôs not all the time. And it seemed worse yesterday and the server seemed a little slow at the time too. Maybe it‚Äôs related that way. Like I said it‚Äôs hard to prove what is going on but it feels off every so often. Maybe related to the issue some people are saying of damage not happening, or crit meters not filling up on a hit. I just know it‚Äôs not all the time, but it‚Äôs something. 
---
More like a huge shift in their bank account thanks to all the people who bought their low effort game. No one from Bethesda is going to read that wall of text. Already got your money so what‚Äôs the point? 
---
In that room is a terminal that takes presidential seals (some kind of token) in exchange for presidential equipment (armor, suit, rifle).  There's going to be some means of becoming the president - potentially a serverwide election, but that's just speculation.  We're assuming it'll be tied in to the ballot printers and election equipment all over the map, but who knows.  They were for a special election after a senator was removed from office, so it doesn't necessarily make sense that they'd be setup to elect a president.  Then we're assuming there would be events where seals can be earned.  Seeing as how there are only three things to buy for 1 seal each, whatever it is it'll likely be a rare thing to get one.
---
Man, appreciate your link. Thanks for sharing!
---
Content is a crucial point, fully agree.
---
Well they‚Äôre being deleted which is usually by the commenter. Could be mods though your posts are quite vile. Also no you‚Äôre not winning there is nothing to win... Please seek professional help for your mentality issues.
---
Is there any way of knowing if the mothman light is going to be like the vault boy one with a decal effect being projected?
---
And if it was in-game, that would be great... Having to bounce around in discord, add friends, hope it lets you join their game (for some reason, I'm cursed with buggy friend adding).  More work for small gains.
---
Actual data like reading this sub?  And how many is "lots" to you?  Is it the same as me?
---
Forcing? Dude... if you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt play it. 
---
I support this 100%. During the week I'm lucky if I can squeeze in an hour or two before bed, but on weekends I often get up earlier than everyone else in the house and play for a couple hours in the morning. Unfortunately that means if I clear out the vendors on Friday night I can't sell shit during my playtime on Saturday morning.
---
Thanks for sticking around. Can't be easy working with Bethesda's current... Avalanche? Avalanche of issues. I'm looking forward to seeing the roadmap! 
---
Right, this will be the tipping point and not the other 20 **MAJOR** things over the past 3 months, said no one ever.
---
Maybe i was just lucky or something but from the beginning of me playing i always seemed to have tons of adhesive and never needed to rely on farming them out.
---
Dont open it take it to the place he got it if its physical copy and get a refund if it's a digital buy rip
---
Fyi i think its tied to automatic weapons.
---
My semis don't do that
---
Not sure how that would mean anything, but you're entitled to your opinion.
---
I know Mod's aren't coming soon, but if we wait to help them, it will be a great deal longer down the road because I'm pretty sure we won't see publicly mod-able servers until the game is stable.  
---
They likely have a very long ToDo list, without question, but if some of the information we've been trying to provide helps them get it done faster (hence why when we can we include the FormID numbers of the problem and the fix)  how is that bad?  
---
Why am I trying.. Honestly don't know, other than enjoying the game.  
---
I don't want a job inside the Industry, I want to enjoy modding as a hobbyist / enthusiast. The fact I want to do so doesn't negate the help that can be offered. Also maybe I'm reading things wrong, but it looks like they could use the help.  The problems and the "fixes" are creating allot of rage/frustration in the community, this is a way to help with that.
---
The "Bug Roundup" Is trying to drum up more issues, so they can be cataloged, tracked, isolated and if possible fixed, be it by Bethesda or the community.   
---
If they don't want our, my help, we will know soon enough, as I said, this was one last shout into the void before I walked away. I love(d) the concept of '76, and the core framework.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, if grinding for dozens of hours to MAYBE get a decent gun is lazy then I 100% agree with you and will not argue at all.
---
Bye Felicia 
---
Interesting and pretty illogical, good to know.
---
Or cigarettes 
---
Pete Hines: lmao fuck you pay me 
---
Very informative sentence you have there......
---
stop thinking you're the "vast majority", you're not even close.
---
Sweet god, thank you. 
---
If my super sledge goes back to breaking after one trip around Whitespring... that's the complete end for me. Makeshift Warrior was the only saving grace.
---
What a weird system
---
And what exactly is a "cheat" to you? The concept is very subjctive. Its one thing to use a third party mod and destroy people in a real pvp game or MMO game non stop another is using a glitch to get stuff in a pretty much single player game.
---
Thing is, those "EULAS" give way too much power to companies. Some lawyers should start checkin those.
---
You‚Äôre making assumptions based on what you haven‚Äôt witnessed yourself. 
---
I‚Äôve gotten comments calling me lazy, entitled whiner cause I criticized the way they implemented the respec system, not giving us retroactive points if we were above lvl 50 when it was released. 
---
There are definitely people that defend Bethesda to a totally unreasonable degree. 
---
Taking inspiration from the campaign to bring back the TV show Jericho I have a proposition for all the people out there who have had enough of Fallout 76, Todd and his B.S. and the weight of bobby pins: 
---
 Today I went to Amazon and ordered a pack of bobby pins and sent them to  
---
 Todd Howard, C/O Bethesda Game Studios, 1370 Piccard Dr #120,  Rockville,  MD 20850,  USA  
---
 It cost me ¬£3.36 including postage. Maybe you should consider doing the same. If you have Amazon prime, you could get a box of bobby pins to Todd today, with free shipping! Why not give it a try. From personal experience it felt great!  Thanks for listening,  C.J.

I've never seen a game drop 50% a little over a week after release, Black Friday or not. Steam doesn't even allow developers/publishers to submit discounts for the first 30 days after release (unless it's a launch discount) precisely because it's so shitty for the people who bought at release.
---
This game got a 50% discount on Black Friday because it was selling really poorly and reviews were pummelling it. No other reason.
---
It was ridiculously shitty. 
---
The only thing that really bothers me about the game is how ridiculously unoptimized it is. You could have a beast of a rig and still experience stuttering after playing for a while.
---
To be fair, 9 women can't make a baby in a month.
---
The implication that 10 devs can do the same amount of work by splitting it up isn't really accurate. 
---
Source: Am a software developer.
---
That said, even if it took 20 man hours to do it for one person.... yea. And are using tools and external know how to do so. They would literally have everything right in front of them.
---
Nah.  You don't have a problem.  You're doing it in power armor.  When you perch, NOT in power armor, then you need help.
---
Now tell us how you really feel.
---
Development process has ups and downs. Buckle up buttercup.
---
Rarely, but in this case, maybe. Now get to it, send those pins.
---
Vault 76 may have been the control vault, but Fallout 76 was the real experiment.
---
They can deny you whatever they want to deny you.  Im sure its covered in fine print.  Dont be a shit head.  Its pretty simple.
---
I'm spec'd the same as you, but I added a stealth armor piece, all other pieces shadowed and my AGI is 20.  Until this patch, I could sneak past ANYTHING except dogs.  And if I held still the dogs wouldn't see me either.
---
Now?  meh
---
Yeah, so whats the deal with these EULAS in games, no one contest them or something? Isn't there laws about that in USA, of an EULA violating laws and making them invalid?
---
Neato
---
/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ is that way^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^/s
---
Forcing?? Like they hacked your console, and blocked access to your entire library, and instead of loading into the homepage it takes you straight to 76? Wow, yeah, fuck those guys. 
---
We are trying to use analogies to make up for our inability to communicate that, per standard ideology, the product does not function per intended and therefor doesnt work. 
---
There are the parts of the game software wise that have to deliver. You have to be able to get into the game and play it. You have to be able to go through with all the functions of the game.
---
Then there are game mechanics that are based upon how the game is set up. How much damage do i do to keep the game challenging but still fun? What activities need to happen to keep people playing the game? What activities should the player have to invest into risk wise and what should the end reward be?
---
Going further, there is the social mechanics. We do not have anything but reddit, discord and voice chat. Everything but the voice chat is ad hoc, not controlled by bethesda. The voice chat is not enough. Its hard to connect with friends or organize clans or any of the normal operations an MMORPG does. Playing Asherons call back in the day as a 6 year old, i had more capability to find people ingame than i do now. I barely knew how to type.
---
Not a single disconnect for me in around 5 hours last night on xbox either, and load times were faster. I have a TSE that isn't as powerful, yeah, but I've been building into a PA/ .50 cal build anyway, so I just have to go further. Probably take away Enforcer now. 
---
Good suggestion. Expansion is around the corner too.
---
Actual data back up your "but lots of them" statement. Prove "lots of them" had TES and the reason they are complaining is because they can't 1 shot things anymore. If you cannot prove this, don't say it because it comes off sounding ridiculous. 
---
&gt; And how many is "lots" to you? Is it the same as me?
---
I'll ask you, how many have you actually seen? 5? 10? 1000? None of those are "lots of them" to me, there are 171,000 people on this sub. Again, you have NO data and are applying things person A said in a different thread to what person B is saying in another thread to dismiss their opinions. It's stupid.  
---
Moron idiot.  But no srs, I'd love to play it.
---
In a coupke years when it is complete and bugtested.  It looks fun.  I'm not willing to pay money to be a beta tester, though.
---
Good they did? Pray tell, what good? Bait and switching physical products? Pushing Atom shop content while their game is broken?
---
I've gotten about 100 of every single ultracite arm, leg, torso, head.
---
They really need to swap out the reward pools.  Especially for the SBQ.
---
In the FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits I sold a few of those until people figured out they dropped like candy.
---
When I see anything Ultracite in the SBQ loot, I'll pick it up "just in case" it might be something different, but 99.99999999% of the time it's the same trash I got the last 30 queen fights.
---
Look at the big brain on brad.
---
If you build 1 foundation with stairs and a second floor you can buils walls on the bottom of the second floor that will go into the dirt and allow you to leave dirt on the 1st floor and wall in your garden
---
It could be a fluke.
---
I‚Äôve had muties and scorched come right up to me and unless I break cover and initiate a fight it shows hidden 
---
I have had bugs where I think I‚Äôm crouched but It looks like I‚Äôm standing even though it says hidden.
---
"I'm pretty sure most of what's been released in the shop so far had already been finished before release"
---
Yeah. It was finished before release. ..before the release of Fallout 4!!!! 
---
I know guys on crack that make more sense than you
---
Av never seen a more obvious yank in ma fuckin life btw no cunt anywhere on the planet types lit that
---
I think they are repeative I believe. You you complete a set and it starts from zero. I get those level up X times and receive few atoms every now and then. At high levels ranking up new cards though it quite slow.
---
How bout one carrying a sack of money walking away laughing.

He isn't Martin King.  He'd have to be a communist liar coke head who beats woman for that to be the case.

What am I supposed to say to that last bit lol? Okay I'll go and do that for you lol? Yes there is something to win. Gaming! 
---
I‚Äôve seen camps there and still had the random spawns- mostly super mutants, scorched, and pied piper spawns. Maybe there‚Äôs a certain distance they have to be from some trigger
---
`Fallout 76.exe has been added to the atom shop`
---
Neither does attacking Bethesda by spreading rumors or carrying on about your bug report to stir up a mob. 
---
Complaining about a video game on Reddit doesn‚Äôt make you a hero, nor does it making you a smarter or more critical thinker than someone having a good time playing past or around issues. 
---
Make good bug reports and have some patience and if you can‚Äôt then find something better to do with your time. Please. 
---
So you believe loot boxes in battlefront 2 are fair because you can earn them? 
---
Expressing your opinion and giving bad reviews on a game makes a developer wake up to the fact they made a shit game. 
---
I see a lot of Twitch streamers just dicking around with their friends, making camps, helping in events.  They just meander.  
---
It's a differing game style.  I know a lot of people ran through the main quest and then said, "What do I do?"  I didn't kill a SBQ until I was level 75.  I didn't finish the BoS or Enclave lines until then, either.  
---
It's probably inconvenient to go BACK and just wander the land, but there's hundreds of hour of content if you don't just slam the main quest.
---
There seem to be a lot more downs than ups in this game‚Äôs case.
---
I've actually had 40 glowing moleminers spawn for just me in my mid 20s in there.
---
Isn't it that the vendors all charge double the base price, with reductions then made for charisma and perks?
---
There‚Äôs like 5 good games on games pass. It sucks just like PS Now sucks. Definitely not worth buying the console over 
---
The Whitespring Train station sells all four building sets.

---
My GF and I both have two characters each over lvl100. At the moment she is 118 and I'm 120. But, the levels have fluctuated since lvl1 and it's always a race to pass each other lol
---
The people pushing these things to be fixed.. or at least be acknowledged, are the ones who will help improve this game for us all. 
---
    Just imagine if gamers were just like Mother-in-laws with products they are unhappy with. "WHERE IS YOUR MANAGER? I DEMAND TO SPEAK TO HIM" 
---
If I'm reading that right, which I'll admit I dnt really know if I am, it looks to me like they are perhaps removing the additional levels of those two perks so that it's a "one and done"?
---
Yeah, un-asked for nerfs suck.  Adding grind to the game doesn't equal more fun.
---
I made a post about it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/)
---
TSE was nerfed too much, which made ranged weapons unviable again, nerf was needed, but as I said it's too much.
---
Demolition perk card was nerfed causing Missile Launchers and Fatman's to be weaker than they already are (also no respec for wasted points for that)
---
Bobby Pins now weight .1 instead .01 or .001 again
---
Damage bug seems to be back again (saw a thread or two about it, but still needs more citations to be a fact)
---
Dupers being banned is good, but there's been reports of people crafting tons of weapons to scrap for mods being banned as well.
---
The entire update released was this time was from a previous build so we kind of went back an update with this one, ie getting rid of a lot of things the previous update fixed, making them return. (Biggest problem a lot of us are mad about)
---
Or waiting in chameleon mode for people to walk through and blow them up as they get close
---
Step 1 take the weakest version that you can imagine a person's argue.
---
Step 2 make sure you twist it all the way around to say something completely and utterly not what the overall argument is.
---
Step 3 continue to take down this absurd argument.
---
Congratulations, you defeated your self built strawman. He put up one hell of a fight, bit you showed him what for
---
It was working for me like that until new patch. I will wait to next week hotfix to see if it's something wrong about maxed SPECIAL
---
I don't know the full story (and neither do you guys) but if it was unsanitized customer input (aka every ticketing system "comments section" ever) then you would have needed to carefully looked at every single ticket to confirm no customer decided to put their full info in there.
---
It really bothers me that both of you guys act as if you KNOW everything that was leaked.
---
I'd like to go back to a realm reborn, but damn that's a lot of grinding.
---
Hands down the most beautiful game world I've ever seen though. 
---
It's permanent.  Which is unfortunate.  I'd buy that gun off you, but not with a prime receiver on it.  Ammo costs with the flux are just too cumbersome.
---
&gt; I'll ask you, how many have you actually seen? 5? 10? 1000? None of those are "lots of them" to me
---
Then there is no pleasing you.  I have seen people write, in the sub, that they didn't want the TSE nerf.  Post nerf I have seen people write that they were unhappy with it.  I am under not obligation to meet your requirements to state an opinion about how many that was.
---
You may wish to let this one go.
---
That's what the community will have you believe, but the game is getting better imo. It's up to the community to voice concerns about anything they don't like, grabbing pitchforks out this early on is anything but supportive or helpful.
---
What they need is to hire the modders
---
There's a guy in Netherlands who sold all his property to invest in crypto, RIP to him.
---
&gt;There's no end-game incentive to craft weapons and armor.
---
That's true. You only craft rare weapons to unlock those mods. After that you are totally done. So there should be some thing into them. 
---
Not liking more RNG legendarie specially how people still have lots of duped resources. 
---
But some other mechanic to have reason to craft weapons, should exists.
---
But these issues exist, you acknowledge that I assume. Shouldn't you then be more understanding of the issue at hand?
---
Sure, you're having no major issues but many are, so why not stand with your fellow gamers? I get that that sounds a little dramatic but it's not meant to be.
---
First world problems and all that.
---
Yea uninstall this POS
---
&gt; How many times have you sold or discarded junk only to have to scrounge for that same type of junk the next day?

Me on a Monday:  I don't need this plastic, I can sell most of it.

Me on a Tuesday:  FUCK!  I need more plastic!   Why did I only keep 200!?

I'm okay without it.  The DJs kind of got repetitive.  But I did think that Rose would serve as a radio option that had a DJ.

NO I do not think Todd will open it, I'm not even sure they'll accept the parcel, but why the hell not just give it a go. I am by no measure a rich man, but for the small price of just over ¬£3 I now have a warm felling of small personal victory in my belly. And feels GOOD!!
---
Dont cheat then shitter.  Its really simple.

Dont...... cheat.

Then you tried to pull the "bu bu but my friends did it!" shit.  Lawd.
---
And for the love of GOD! Stop thanking them for fixing the fucking mess they made in the first place. 
---
That‚Äôs like thanking the bloke who just stabbed you for bandaging you up.
---
"Take a page from League of Legends" this made evrything you said irrelevant Riot is rly bad at balancing 
---
I 100% agree.  It was management that is running the team ragged chasing down 100+ bugs to fix in ONE patch.  Let them concentrate on the "worst 20" and make sure those ones are fixed and new ones don't pop up as a result of the 20 bug fixes.
---
I think you'll like the post I made about it :)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/)

---
Could also be for DLC.
---
Could also be to backfill people who have left.
---
Live Producer certainly would suggest someone in charge of the live game (versus DLC).
---
I don't really after that they fucked up White Knight, or that it was for no reason. I've had it equipped for the past 85ish levels, and it was just flat out too good. Gathering materials and repairing gear are an intended mechanic of the game. A perk like white Knight should *lessen* those requirements, not remove the mechanic altogether, which is pretty much where it was at before. Maybe they need to tweak the numbers a little more, they already reduced the overall repair costs in general last patch (although that may or may not have been inadvertently rolled back this time). The only way to really know if white Knight is too weak now is to wait until after the hotfix, and then play with for an extended period. Play with it in, play with it off, see how much of a difference it makes over time. I haven't played a ton since the patch, but but I did a bit. Fight some stuff, got beat up some, did some events, killed a few scorch beasts. Nothing I had on broke. I only had one piece that I was even *able to repair*, because it finally dropped below 100%.  All the 500 threads about it after the patch, some before the game was even back up, were gut reactions and hyperbole, which is pretty much always the case right after any kind of balance change.
---
I‚Äôve tapped out as well.  I was expecting something as great as ESO but in the fallout universe.  What I got was a great main story that is able to be finished in a few days, then nothing to do.  I rolled new characters to try different builds.  But in the end, you can do pvp where you take turns 1-shorting each other, or you can kill a mechanicless end game boss over and over and over.  I expect great things will come to this game, but I‚Äôm not going to sit around twiddling my thumbs for months at a time waiting for the next big patch.  
---
I'm not really grinding anymore. I have what decent gear from looting and doing glowing ones/scorched queens. I just worry about them nerfing my flora. Haha
---
 Yeah the door is weird. There are some Scorched not far away and mirelurks have come by a couple of times.
---
 Not really a problem, I have my Fusion Generator behind a 0 lock door to keep them out and I fix stuff once in a while. Just 2 of the starter turrets and a spotlight, right now guard the place.
---
 I keep an open CAMP with all the benches, a fire and you can take my Purified if you are too lazy to boil some. ;)
---
This also happens with pvp. Before and after the patch u will not do damage to  a player randomly. Everything will work except damage so u have to rejoin server to fix it. Annoying ya.
---
Was going to suggest same thing lol
---
&gt; More or less just a SUPER improved version of 76 without CAMP griefers.
---
Maybe no CAMP griefers, but another settlement might need your help. And then another one, if you're not too busy.
---
This is how any number of game systems work, and I honestly think it'ed be great, especially if they bump the cap total to say 220 or something to offset for the days loss. 
---
I was going to make a post about this, but the way things are looking it'll just get downvoted to hell. 
---
I understand the criticisms, I'm not super happy about this latest patch myself. Although I haven't really noticed too much change the days since the updated while playing (note I'm coming up on about 250 hours), but there are quite a few bothersome problems. Especially all the returned bugs from last patch!
---
But over half the posts right now are "I quit!", "Why I'm quitting", and most posts like that. Who does that help (other than the person venting)? This community was historically always about trying to make the game better! Now it's just spammed content about quitting with usually little to no helpful conversation. Criticism can be helpful for sure, but recently it hasn't been. When the game launched it was a mess (still isn't doing much better, but seems to be on a slight positive trend up) and the conversation here was all about constructive criticism. 
---
Lastly, there was a post on here that got some traction titled something like "Bethesda should be firing people right now!". How did the mods allow this? Who are you to say someone should lose their job over this? 
---
This sub was the only good place to discuss this game, discuss changes/fixes, find other people that you can play the game with, ask players for help when needed. Now this sort of content is downvoted or those people are called Bethesda sympathizers.
---
I'm talking about just the mods, as you're always going to get one of the arm/leg/chest drop (which is super silly now, buy I digress.)
---
TWD ‚ÄúWhisperers‚Äù come to mind. 
---
You can also buy atoms, making it Pay-To-Win
---
You can A: Outright buy - Or B: Take time to earn them. 
---
My point is that all atom shop items should remain cosmetic permanently. 
---
Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy movie - *fly swatters*
---
Ehhh its a slippery grey area. Its and introduction event that only last a bit of time. I dont like it, but I wouldnt exactly label it p2w. since at most it is +60 health i dont see it making a big different in fights while it lasts either.
---
I've seen up to [four](https://imgur.com/a/IrF144a) in that area.
---
They don't know because they are rare and mostly useless?
---
No shit.    
---
I never said the opposite. I said there are plenty of bullshit stories in this subreddit, paid or not.
---
Wouldn't your current theory that "they wanted to duplicate the red headlamp code but forgot the duplication part." shoot your last sentence that "probably they will add all the headlamps to the shop?" I wouldn't start up a malicious rumor before there's even proof of that
---
Hopefully your world views and the way you treat people is something that matured with age. Good luck kid.
---
if so, I'm lucky I didn't get banned for grinding out all the handmade mods a couple weeks ago.
---
side note:  that wasn't cheap, either.
---
They aren't though? Zenimax owns the game and account. You agreed that you don't even own the account, in the TOS.
---
"By creating an Account, You agree that You do not own the Account, any user names created on the Account, any Content stored or associated with an Account (such as digital and/or virtual assets, achievements, virtual currency, and other Downloadable Content), or related data associated with the Account."
---
No, I'm not delusional.
---
Although if Bethesda keep going like they are FO76 can be in the top ten worst games of 2019 as well as 2018.
---
I'm just disheartened. Haven't played in weeks, and I don't think I'll launch it again. I really was looking forward to another Fallout game, but this one just isn't it. I tried to not say much in /r/fo76, I wanted to give the studio the benefit of the doubt, and the community had already raised a bunch of concern over the past few months so me adding to the pile probably wouldn't have helped anything.  
---
But I've reached a point where I just don't know what to say anymore. My weekly board game group and I get together and video games always come up in conversation. Lately whenever fo76 gets brought up, everyone just sighs. I've just never seen such lack of care for art. Because at the end of the day, these video games we love and enjoy, are art. But I feel like I'm rifling through the art bin and it's just all photocopy prints instead of something someone made.  
---
I think the best course of action for Bethesda is to pull the game, add another year to development, and do another launch Dec. 2019. I have confidence that they could make this a good game. But with the current stigma surrounding it, the lack of successful patches, and the downward spiral of quality, I'm not sure continuing on this path is beneficial.  
---
I don't want any devs to take this to heart, or that I think they aren't creating anything of quality. I think the studio is full capable. But they need to get back to the roots of game development. Creating great products first. No micro-transactions, no in game stores, no secondary products like rum. Just focus on what is important. A good game, with good mechanics, and a compelling story. Isn't that what games are suppose to be? This is why over the past year I've spent more money on small/indie studios than on the big ones. We all know they are just trying to pump out what can sell quick to make a profit. But these studios really truly need to take a step back, and look at themselves to see what they have become.  
---
thanks for listening everyone 
---
But what if they don't want to blow you? Would you accept getting fucked in the ass instead?
---
Well, Hearthstone is a super-popular game and you can say it's p2w, but many people are happy to play it still. Having the atom shop gear on doesn't make you overly powerful - you just look better.
---
Don't have high hopes. Here are some images:

This is already my GOTY for 2018.  It's not perfect but I'm taking my time and the only major problem I've had with it is everyone running around with lame TSE guns.
---
wait, I thought that was just a funny meme. Is Tod Howard actually tracking people down and kidnapping them?
---
It's just a different strokes type of thing. For me Bethesda games always eventually feel like I'm doing the same thing and interacting the same way with the world over and over again after only like 30 hours. In my opinion the lore is not well written enough to be interesting, it's not even on the level of decent pulp. The environments are the same over and over but arranged differently. The combat is lacking. The quests are "go here and press a button or kill things" if your not interested in the lore that is. 
---
These are complaints I have about all Bethesda games though. Some people sink 1000s of hours I to them, I feel like I'm having the same dream over and over again after just a handful of hours. Just different tastes really. I can sink 1000s of hours into Rocket League where people get bored after just a few.
---
Yeah, ban them and burn their houses! Teenagers without priorites making a big fuzz about people trying to make a garbage grade game more fun by having some better weapons. I agree its fucked up in PvP but most dont want PvP first place.
---
It had better hurry up eh! Err kid... Lol
---
Yeah anything that you buy with real money that boosts your stats is considered P2W. That health COULD be the difference between a loss and a win in a PvP scenario 
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter once you‚Äôre stood still, the gun vanishes ( as it should with Chameleon ) but the green DOT in the sight goes too, frustrating 
---
We will continue to get half assed games like this and Destiny 1 and 2 vanilla (I said vanilla not Forsaken or Taken King) as long as subreddits abuse words like "toxic" and "entitled" for any criticism and literal manchildren get irrationally angry if they see someone saying a game they like is not perfect. If you are guilty of any of this, you deserve this game.
---
Better yet, go buy 10 copies of the game and register the code and never install it. That will show them! They will be so pissed.
---
Each vendor group has its own timer. So the first one you sell to the reset 20 hours later. But the other vendor groups are unaffected by that. 
---
If getting the most caps in each 20 hour period is important to you, you‚Äôre better off keeping track of when you sold to each group. Then you‚Äôll know when the 20 hours are up. 
---
If convenience is more important to you, you‚Äôre very likely to run up against vendors with no caps and no idea when they will reset. 
---
It‚Äôs to avoid this that I sell to all seven at once. It takes about 25 minutes. I make a note of the times and then I know when I can sell again the next day.

Hahaha. It's a bit sad that anyone has to go out of their way, get popular on Reddit and catch the attention of one of you guys to fix your broken game.

I can reluctantly tolerate it if it is themed (like the night health regen or the holding toys for rad resist events) if they start tossing in random items and tagging on a temporary bonus, then I will worry.

Every time people post here on this subreddit after TSE nerf cause they paid real money for one makes me so happy. Those people thought their "investment" was gonna last them a while. Then Bethesda nerf their favourite toys and they throw them out of their prams. What a lovely turn of events.
---
Or the "me and my long lost third cousin who lives in Burundi have finally reconnected because of this game," shite. 
---
Hearthstone is also free to play, and not something many people payed 60 for.
---
Not really.  I've never seen a single patch where one of my mains became the TSE of Leauge.....lol
---
To put it to a finer point, have you ever seen a League Patch where they took Teemo's total damage output and reduced it by 80%+?  He'd be unplayable then.  His auto attacks would do almost nothing.  His shrooms would do LESS damage than super minions.  People would dump Teemo immediately in favor of any other champ they could play.
---
Sure I liked the buffs and didn't like the nerfs.  But it was small nerfs and small buffs.  Then a few patches later other things would get buffed and other things would get nerfed.  It had a balance to it.  I never felt that one of my mains was "unplayable" because of a balance change.  They might not be as OP as before, but I could make it work still.
---
League had balance.  Small nerfs and buffs keep things even.
---
I think you are going to need more than 13 followers to get any traction on your threats.

DAE Witcher *fapfapfapfapfap*?
---
They made some weird fix preventing clipping when using higher FOVs on ultrawide but its still shit.
---
I like it at first but now I can see the game is utter garbage and anyone who defends it is blind to that fact
---
lol no
---
Lol 40 hours. I'm lucky if I get 20 out of most AAA games. 
---
It depends on what's being developed and what cosmetic item is being made.
---
I do concur with the storyline issue that others have brought up. I simply can't get into the story line and now that I think of it, i have no idea what the main storyline even is.... 
---
I don't like how there are no humans around except for other players. It makes the world seem empty. 
---
I also don't like how the quests aren't paired properly with your level. So as a level 25, you are stuck for quests until you level to mid 30's and can wear your power armor and continue questing. 
---
It's not that I don't like the game, I do, but I can't fall in love with it like I did with 3 or 4. It's forgettable, like New Vegas. 
---
then wear a dress and roleplay as a pretty lady until Feb 4
---
Hmm....
---
xD
---
You lost the devs at "buff". They only nerf things. 
---
It can get quite frustrating and grind at times, but this game definitely gives that that rewarding feel of mastering a weapon along with taking down challenging monsters. 
---
Now that is some level of commitment that I can't even think about. But I mean, I did gather 2000+ hours on Skyrim ever since 2013, so I could do this. Maybe.
---
I don't know anymore. Please help.
---
Run speed effect clarify plz?
---
The best part is it's worth 20 Atoms. Are 500 Atoms still worth $5 USD? Your 7,600 hours are worth 20 cents to them.

Patch 5 released on Tuesday with many fixes and adjustments to balance. Amongst the feedback, we saw some questions about a few of the updates and some concerns about problems coming out of the patch including bobby pin weight reverting back to 0.10 lb, problems with Bulk Junk auto-scrapping, and others. Below we‚Äôll shed light on some of the decisions we made and what we‚Äôre doing to resolve any new issues.
---
* **Patch 5 reverted Bobby Pin weight.** In Patch 4, we had reduced Bobby Pin weight from 0.10 lb to 0.001 lb each, and this was mistakenly undone in patch 5. We are addressing this in [**a hotfix going live later today**](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319175/upcoming-hotfix-january-31-2019?language%5B%5D=en). This issue occurred when a merge of our development builds failed to execute properly prior to releasing patch 5. We are working on ways to prevent this from happening again in the future. 
---
* **Bulk Scrap can no longer be auto-scrapped.** This was an unintended side-effect of our change to stop loose mods from being auto-scrapped when you didn‚Äôt have enough materials while trying to craft. We‚Äôve identified the cause of the issue and are currently planning to address it with our upcoming hotfix so that you can get back to crafting without having to manually scrap your bulk items. 
---
* **Plans and Recipes appearing as (Known) across all characters.** This is a UI issue introduced with Patch 5 that caused all plans and recipes a player had learned on one character to appear as ‚Äú(Known)‚Äù across all their characters in trade and inventory menus. Known plans and recipes are intended to be tracked separately for each character on an account, and we‚Äôre currently planning to address this in the upcoming hotfix. 
---
* **Ultracite Power Armor plans being available at Taggerdy‚Äôs Terminal negates the need to fight the Scorchbeast Queen.** One of the key rewards for Belly of the Beast is a full set of Ultracite Power Armor. Some players accidentally deleted this reward and were understandably upset. We made this fix to ensure everyone that completed Belly of the Beast could remake this power armor even if they accidentally dropped or deleted it. These recipes can also drop from the Scorchbeast Queen, but this wasn‚Äôt meant to be one of her primary rewards, since everyone in the Scorched Earth event already should have access to the Ultracite Power Armor. 
---
* **Energy and Heavy Weapons Improvements.** We've heard and share your feedback that energy weapons need to be brought inline with other weapon types. We're also looking to adjust laser weapon durability in a future update. Additionally, after recent balance changes related to Perks and Legendary Mods, players have expressed that explosive non-legendary weapons are now less powerful. We agree there are improvements we can make. We‚Äôre doing an audit of heavy weapons damage and their ammo weights. We plan to increase damage in light of the perk and mod reductions, and plan to reduce ammo weight to make heavy weapons generally more viable. These adjustments will roll those out in a future update. 
---
* **Perk balance adjustments**. Demolition Expert was reduced to match related damage perks. The damage bonus it previously provided was very high and was causing balance problems, especially when combined with the Explosive Rounds Legendary mod. We also reduced the condition loss and repair bonuses offered by the White Knight and Licensed Plumber perks to help them better match perks like Power Patcher. We know the balance changes we made to these cards have caused some frustrations. We make these decisions to encourage more balanced pick rates across all perk cards, and even out perks that can start to feel mandatory when they‚Äôre overperforming compared to other cards. We‚Äôre hearing your feedback about repair costs and we‚Äôre currently looking into reducing them in general with future updates. 
---
* **Vendor plans now cost more Caps.** Vendor prices were originally based on rarity. Guaranteeing their appearance in a Vendor‚Äôs inventory significantly increased the availability of most plans and recipes, and we‚Äôve increased their cap prices as a result. Cap prices have been set relatively high to allow for a market to still exist where players can mod others‚Äô equipment for a cheaper price.
---
Yup even now its still possible to one shot. A cap could make it so no matter what it would take 2 to 4 shots to kill another player using the strongest weapon, making pvp actually fun because it lasts. Not so strong weapons would obviously do less but you get the idea. Fights would be epic. 
---
It's interesting they changed from releasing the PC patch earlier than consoles (to at least test the patches) then just went straight back to release on all platforms at the same time.
---
That sounds like the kind of decision upper management would make.
---
I like your positive thinking, lemme try. ***IF*** Hitler wasn't rejected from Academy of Fine Arts at Vienna, then he could of had more masterpieces then in our timeline.
---
I never once said there were no posts or people defending BGS or FO76. What I did do was point out that the ratio of these types of posts and comments pale in comparison to the negative ones. Also, how have I not witnessed this? I read the same posts and comments as everyone else. I'm sorry some people resorted to calling you names, but the only way you can think that people are blindly defending the game and devs is if you stretch the definition of the word. Seriously, just because someone doesn't call for a full refund or a leadership change or Todd's head or calls them greedy or bashes the Atom store prices does not mean they are defending them. They are more often than not reacting in a manner they feel is rational since it's a $60 video game.
---
Just because you say no doesn‚Äôt make it false. I just literally gave you the definition of pay to win. Not my definition, THE definition lol
---
Check Watoga shop robot thought i saw a-lot of jet paks yesterday after the Patch 5 update.
---
Hey those 13 followers represent at least 6 other silent voices!
---
If by need you mean nerf then no, you are not right. They fixed both of these perks to now properly apply the effect when your special stats aren‚Äôt whole numbers, such is the situation when you have a mutation such as egghead etc.
---
I talked my friends into buying battleborn at full price. Don't feel too bad.
---
400 hours here. I log on to play with my friends doing whatever, running some random directions, helping folks, crafting a bunch of stuff, running a nuke zone, stuff like that.
---
I also keep a trading subreddit open on my other monitor and constantly act as a trader and provisioner for other players. Folks randomly run up to me mid-combat and buy stuff from me. A lot of days I kind of feel like Grahm because I'm high level, will kill whatever they bring with them, and then sell them a bunch of random stuff they need that I carry on me. It's pretty awesome, honestly, and I'm not tired of it yet.
---
 From the full changelog came across this:
---

---
How the fck they fck up adding up a Tag? I guess the event of using different Costumes to get +15 HP is completely broken huh? Seriously Beth do you guys even review your code?
---
So I haven't played in about a month and a half. I'd hit like level 100 and had pretty much everything you could want. I'm interested in how you're supposed to play the game now with the quarter nerfs to explosive two shot. When I was still playing anything I wasn't hitting with an exp TS would take about an entire magazine to put down, even with level 50 armor piercing guns. 
---
Good Ale too ;)

Up until yesterday, it was a one-at-a-time thing for me. Yesterday, someone zoned in by the bus and all 30 ran out and right up onto the bed. It was pretty fun for me, but a little tough on those guys in hazmat suits who turned into little paper bags. On the bright side, I only had to walk a few feet for all the loot spots. 
---
Yes, yes! Establish you're a 'true' fan. Make us feel for all that "waiting" you did. Share how much you spent on video hame. Then, review the timeline of undeniable backlash. 
---
Express your feelibgs with intense, undefined adjectives like "trash." Speak as if it's all truth. For everyone. The people that like this game enjoy eating trash, it seems. Hold onto that view your entire life. Look at you, you're thriving!
---
Atom Store is done by a different group of developers. 
---
They are probably proud of their game. If they weren't, they wouldn't be issuing patches and asking us feedback. 
---
They have been pretty vocal on here as of lately, trying to get stuff worked out. 
---
It wasn't a pleasant day. Love the area, hate the neighborhood. 
---
Maybe we can try checking around swimming pools.
---
I'm a Fallout veteran have played all of the series and was one of those who would have defended them in every way possible. But this last update was the last straw for me. Every time they fix one problem 12 more pop up. I've given up on this game till they fix the issues.
---
Add one of these:

---
lol k
---
i'm sorry but it totally is. the article you linked is about how terms of use or service applies, while we're talking about what kind of terms of use or service corporate entities are allowed to have.
---
I keep logging in after patches. it's an addiction. It's like rooting for a bad sports team. You know they won't win, but you gotta watch anyhow, just in case.
---
I totally agree, but after a few months of playing I'd like a little more communication and the dev notes haven't exactly been as useful as we expected. Like other have said, we need a roadmap for whatever direction this game is going to go in the future (hopefully it's not all PvP focused).
---
Ah, never knew that - Potentially puts me on their chopping block.  When I put on Super Duper (the irony!) and spam the hell out of the spacebar when creating glowing meat steaks after a Whitespring nuke run.
---
It's not changed much yet.. because we've submitted things like this before, but hoping with the recent outrage and the attention it's getting maybe this time...
---
Trust Bethesda? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
The same Bethesda that sold us an early acess game for 60 bucks? The same Bethesda that put a crappy nylon bag in our CEs? The same Bethesda that leaked personal information from their customers? The same Bethesda that gave a free pass for the dark nuka cola fiasco? Do I need to keep going?
---
I take the word of any "xxyllegolassayjainXS" in the internet over anything said by Bethesda. They fucked us. They fucked our friends. I became a laughing stock to some of my friends (and the hate of others) for convicing some to buy this game.
---
To hell with it, its not a big fuzz even if the guy duped or not. To me if he is using items just for fun in the game (as long its not about PvP screwing others but I think pvp shouldnt even be here first place) and not selling them at Ebay its fine to me.
---
because while true for him its not true for everyone personal truths are not facts for him it was not worth it for others it still is me personally I told people to wait from beginning unless they wanted to be part of a crash test that said I still enjoy the game even with the bugs but that doesn't mean I don't report them or try to help people with them or ignore them they just don't effect me enough to stop playing 
---
They nerfed perk cards because people deemed them necessary. That's not a mistake.
---
From what I understand they don't have body parts listed, so maybe it's for a different one?
---
If you checked every body part, then I haven't the foggiest idea.
---
Thanks. Upvoted.
---
Planters are in the game. Why can‚Äôt we use them????
---
If you read after the coma, I wrote "... as an alternative way to acquire them." Given the changes in the name for **ALL** headlamps, I highly suspect that they will add the headlamps to the shop but not make them exclusive to the shop. In other words, you would be able to buy them if you don't care to grind for them.
---
Of course nothing is 100% certain. This is just what the edit highly suggest.
---
I like that someone figured out you could fly to Germany on Ryan air cheaper than for what theyre buying it for in Italy lol 
---
Never said that you get 40 hours, that's just what people expect. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I'm saying what needs to be said even if people don't want to listen. This could be a very bad slippery slope.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/7DVp0EfSlQgspUWrcMzI1O/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-31-2019
---
This is perfect.
---
I know 6 people who bought it including myself, and while I'm hovering thinking about jumping back in constantly everyone else I know has already quit.
---
Hey, that's mean.  I ran into a dude the other day claimed to be "Strongest Super Mutant."  Don't rain on his parade!!
---
We can just agree to disagree on what we mean by ‚Äúdefending‚Äù then. 
---
First make sure there aren't any higher level players in the area.  They go in first, the enemies are higher level.
---
Second, if it still seems too high.  Server hop.  It may be that the higher level players just left that area.
---
Third, there is is probably a MINIMUM cap to the enemy levels.  Like if a level 5 goes into Watoga alone, it won't spawn level 5 enemies because the MINIMUM for that zone is 20 (just a guess on levels, but I'm thinking each zone has a minimum).
---
Hope that helps!
---
Maybe make 2 shot actually 2 shot again? not 1 &amp; 1/4 shot
---
Yup its an idea I read a while back and just added how it could actually work percentage wise. I just want pvp fights to last and be epic. As it is now they will just nerf everything to death and pvp will still suck lol. 
---
Yesterday, I found a level 42 ghoul stronger than the Queen!
---
35 bullets, and he didn't lose a damn HP point‚Ä¶
---
Server hopping does nothing to help sell everything.  Each vendor faction has only 200 caps and resets every 22-24 hours.
---
not sure what you would be referring to.
---
Honestly gotta applaud you, I‚Äôve been off work from a back injury just before the game was released and honestly don‚Äôt even have half your hours
---
I'm a student game developer, I can confirm this is exactly what they're doing. They said the perks were "overperforming"? That just means the game without those perks is boring. Instead of addressing the issue they've only made it worse. There's only 1 logical reason to do that and you've nailed it on the head. 
---
They pull them to the back, splitting the pull.  From there, it's on to the person who spawned them (and also just zoned in) to run to catch half of the room, still missing some.  Sure, it can be done but why?  So some stranger can AFK farm their wave with turrets?  For what? Why do that to another human?
---
That's about as useful as not buying gas for a day.  In the end you just end up buying the same amount of gas on a different day, and nothing changes.
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Yay, fixes to my favorite game
---
What you're taking about here (and the accidental roll back of the last patch) are due effects of "agile". Agile suggests an iterative approach, where you ship a minimally viable product, then you iterate on that produce with small but very regular updates. Those updates are generally shaped by user stories (aka user feedback or complaints).
---
The idea is that you end up with a rapidly evolving product that morphs into the ideal software for your customer. FWIW, Sea of Thieves is using the same system.
---
There are two major drawbacks to the way Bethesda have implemented Agile:
---
* Clearly they have trouble managing updates. It's likely they have multiple smaller teams, each working on different bugs/features (each working on their own isolated build of the game) ... those deferent pieces of work are then merged into the live product once completed. What happened here looks like one team's development code was pushed out before being merged with the current live version. Once in full swing we should expect a patch every week,which means two things... Firstly Bethesda need to sort out their processes to ensure that this never happens again, and secondly the players need to stop freaking out at every patch and understand that if they just post (readable, constructive) feedback, there'll be a new patch next week.
---
* They don't seem to have their own vision for the game. Agile is all about putting the customer  first, designing around their needs and using "customer stories" to drive the direction of software development. And that's great if you're devaloping database or eftpos software, but when you're making database software everyone of your customers broadly agree about what it should be and what it should do - that's not true for a game. It's been hard enough for "Sea of Thieves", where everyone is in broad agreement about what the game even is.... But what even is Fallout? Bethesda don't know, they said players would decide. People play different games with the same software... Traditional Bethesda RPG, survival game, Fallout mmo, co-op shooter, looter shooter, pvp shooter, Fallout flavoured minecraft... They can't rely on us to shape the game's direction, because we don't even agree on what the game is. They have to deside on the game they are trying to build and then prioritise user stories that will push the game in that direction. Design by committee doesn't work. 
---
That‚Äôs because you have a face only a mother could love. 
---
Thanks for playing!
---
lol goty?
---
em "TSE" tier champs are normal thing in League and overnerfing is also super common
---
Aaaand when you get a limb crippled, that limb should fall to the ground as loot that anyone can pick up.
---
I just picked a mutated fern and lost 9 rounds of .45 and 2 grenades... y is this a thing....is it going to start taking my armor next 
---
this is pretty amusing and harmless 
---
So they need to undo their balance changes because you don't like them?  got it.
---
I hate voice chat in MMO's, it just ruins the immersion for me.  I hope they add a txt chat box because the emotes are not enough.
---
Hold up. 
---
 That's retailers lowering the price.  It's not like Bethesda dictates what they sell thier product for. Retailers and businesses already paid Bethesda for the copies. At the least Bethesda might mention a RRP (recommended retail price). 
---
Party!
---
You don't have to grind for them though, you can just buy them at a vendor still. Red tacticals are even for sale at train vendors, you just can't put them on. Probably because of the reason you said, copied it over and neglected to differentiate.
---
I'm just saying, we shouldn't work ourselves into a mob frenzy until it's confirmed lamps are going into the atom shop.
---
There are some people who benefit from malicious rumors
---
mehhhh
---
My stealth was definitely being screwy yesterday. I was stationary and had molerats attack me immediately after going stealth. I was unable to go from caution to hidden near a scorchbeast fissue, had next to no issue pre-patch.
---
This sub isn‚Äôt for fans of either. It‚Äôs for people to discuss fo76
---
I have a build that I made just for grenade launchers, I don't play to have the highest dps, I wanted a fun splody build.  Now that they nerfed explosives expert, my already underperforming build be beyond salvageable.  Don't think people only do certain builds to be better than any other build in the game. its just not true.
---
Ya, the glory boys may need to actually clear some adds so she lands.
---
I‚Äôm sorry 
---
pass me some of that popcorn  (takes a seat)
---
Damn, imagine taking videogames this seriously. Yikes.
---
Just saying, the 2 perks only bug out if you have Class Freak + Egghead or Herd Mentality active at the same time. Class Freak + any other mutation is fine.
---
Hotfix rolling out later today? NiCe.
---
CMs, does that include consoles?
---
I would like to point out though, that FF14 only got those changes made because the devs at Square had the professional integrity and self-awareness to admit that the game had major flaws and issues on a fundamental level. They also had the willingness to make widespread and sweeping redesigns of core mechanics and how they game was played.
---
Without a similar level of professional integrity and self-awareness these devs will never be able to those types of changes here. 
---
Yeah there's one on a little pylon.
---
It‚Äôs probably because you‚Äôre using a shitty hazmat build and just imagining stuff. I mean seriously I play a bloodied build and can run it with regular armor and power armor(although it‚Äôs way better in regular armor) and I see absolutely no point in running a hazmat suit just so you can die in seconds.
---
I can literally tank the queen in my regular armor while radiated down to only 30% hp, while like 10 other mobs are meleeing and shooting me. 
---
Please tell what advantage besides radiation resistance(who cares) that a hazmat suit gives you? Because it sure as heck isn‚Äôt giving me the 75% damage reduction my sentinel set gives, or the 90 special stats my unyielding set gives me.
---
I agree. I'm usually a dollar an hour and I'm stoked. 
---
I didn't quit playing because of Bobby pin weight.
---
No u 
---
AFAIK you are not 'losing' those items. You used them earlier and the UI is displaying that on a delay for some reason.
---
" I need you to understand it's unacceptable "
---
Let me fix this for you...  
---
 I need you to understand it's unacceptable **TO ME**
---
But Bethesda isn't going to write the code if everyone is on board. Sony has a habit of blocking cross platform play
---
My Fatman who launches a Mini Nuke fails in comparison to some naked guy with an axe. Smh
---
That would be awesome, and I'd likely get it to add to my collection of 17 other mutations, but I mostly want to *look* like what I very much already *am*.
---
Might unistall too then. I was also logging in to have fun and actually kill stuff with bullets like they do in real world. Playing a FPS where guns tickle enemies is no fun and as much melee can still one shot enemies and kill queens in few minutes its just not fun (FPS games dont work well with melee, at least in most games).
---
Let me fix this for you...
---
I need you to understand it's unacceptable **TO ME**
---
Had Bethesda demonstrated any actual leadership since Fallout 76 launched‚ÄîTodd and Pete getting out there, taking the proverbial bull by the horns and generating some faith that the company is committed to the game‚Äîthat would be one thing.  But, it seems the entire leadership at Bethesda and BGS are completely AWOL and really just don‚Äôt care very much.  And if Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care about its own game, why should anyone else?
---
They don't need to do anything, but the game in it's current state is too tedious to play and have fun for me personally, so I wont play.
---
Its happened at the white springs station, the back door to the enclave bunker, R&amp;G station, and watoga station for sure. Maybe its just areas that tend to have more players in the vicinity.
---
said every player who has been nerfed in an online game....
---
Strangely most of the people I talk to don't actually regret it. I mean, as far as hours per dollar go, almost everyone got decent mileage out of the game, such as it is. Even I don't particularly regret it. I'm heartbroken at what they did with it, it could have been a gem with proper handling, but I don't exactly regret it. And the entertainment value from seeing Bethesda shoot itself, repeatedly, in feet and ass, in such a public way, has been pretty priceless. It's like watching a trainwreck, you know you should look away but you just keep looking.
---
Have you made the mandatory "I'm Quitting" post to let us all know why you quit? We're sitting on pins and needles from anticipation.
---
Not impressed 
---
they could have split the difference between where they were and where they are and I think people would have been OK on both sides...
---
They might as well have eliminated those prefixes entirely.
---
Maybe they can use their axe to clear so brush so she has a spot to land.
---
The CSR folks are probably emailing a copy of this inspiring letter to the entire company. I‚Äôm sure some are printing it out and posting it on their walls to look at in the dark times.
---
Imo make the brave flair for ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still playing‚Äù posts. 
---
Man, you sound fun to be with but a nightmare to be against! ;)
---
Which values did you use on the math? Weapon listed or outcome based?  I've noticed more than a few discrepancies between the two sometimes.  My lever action has a lower listed damage than the two-shot but it pushes it out much more quickly and accurately, my DPS is inarguably higher with the lower listed damage.  Hard to tell by numbers, just kind of feeling it.  Curious how you worked it all out, your understanding of the magic of damage seems better than mine, heh.
---
I feel like this is becoming unproductive fast, it's not a cop out, but I'm slightly overwhelmed with hundreds of notifications and ton of messages (which I am sure is how the Community Managers feel every day) but I'll respond atleast once more.  
---
\-The TSE Rebalance was not handled properly, and they ended up breaking more than they fixed. Better suggestions were made, not just by me, but the community.  It is not hubris to say I understand balancing issues, I've been playing MMO's since UltrimaOnline, and more then a few times over the years I worked with groups who had open lines to the Dev's, it's how I know it's possible.  It's not in this case, to late to fix what many think is a mistake. 
---
\-It's less about the specific stealth nerfs (on my phone so don't have TESEdit Open to give you an exact example) but more about letting people know about the changes. Wait, just remembered one, there is a good amount of data indicating the Power Armor Fusion core drain rate increased significantly, and more than a few people have been caught with their pants down, not realizing they needed to carry more than a single extra FC with them, resulting in death / lost progress.  It's a minor thing, but it causes animosity.
---
\-You could be correct, and I've acknowledged a few times in this thread I am not a lawyer, cannot claim to know the inner workings and have tried to derail some of the hostile bandwaggons regarding that.  The fear of retroactive attempts at compensation could be a significant issue (again already mentioned), BUT other games have done it in the past, specifically other MMO's, so with the proper disclosures, signed agreements and NDA's it should be easily mitigated. If they want to spend the time, money and energy on that, well, can't comment. 
---
He means cycle the guns after you've stopped. The gun will come back in view
---
I don't think I'm anywhere near that many hours, but level 70 and finished main quest. 
---
When I play I go gather materials for armour upgrades, stuff to sell for caps or looking for plans while I'm waiting for the next content update like you generally do with online games that have planned additional content.  
---
I use automatic , mainly plasma weapons and deal absolutely fuck all damage but I'm still stockpiling materials to make ammo and repair those weapons because balancing will fix it eventually. If I get too bored waiting for them to balance it then I'll stop playing until I do. 
---
Think the problem is coming from people that built up in their head that this videogame MUST be exactly what they want it to be within the time frame they decided. 
---
The game runs, you login to the same account and there's not really much downtime. It's as advertised, it's just unfortunately a bit boring at the moment. 
---
Awesome.thanks for the feedback.
---
basically
---
Truth is the game was rigged from the start
---
That's how players have interpreted it, anyway.  By the same token, the glitchy "fully rank up perk cards" right below it that never seems to clear must also track how many dupes we get from packs or something.
---
I‚Äôve also noticed this. And it‚Äôs doing the thing again where I see the hit register on the health bar and then the enemy magically regenerates 3/4 to all of the damage again instantly. 
---
Are you sitting on...BOBBY PINS?
---
Fallout 3 was a great game.
---
Fallout 76 is a project game. I'm giving it time to correct itself, test the waters for certain features, patch what bugs they can, improve their mechanics and add some extras. I'm not going to give up just because people can't handle the fact that problems happen in programming and want to scream or throw temper tantrums. It's not the end of the fucking world, shit will get fixed. 
---
Now this is what I call a "True fan" right here folks.
---
Because this isn't a game. It's a "Live Service."  
---
It's not about fun, it's about "engagement."  
---
It isn't about making the game fun to play.  It's about "gameplay loops" and "retention."  
---
The rewards for events are shite because they want you to use the "purely cosmetic" item shop with its bloated prices for recycled FO4 assets.  
---
The Atom rewards are pathetically small because they're just there to give you a taste of what you can buy, so you'll spend more cash. Classic psychological manipulation.  
---
This isn't a game.  It's a time-sink hamster wheel designed to be a Fallout-skinned money farm.   
---
Playings devils advocate here, it goes the other way too. Any legit criticism of the game gets smashed down by a gang of Bethesda white knights even when that criticism is well thought out and fair. 
---
I wonder if the evasive changes explain the bug I had yesterday where the Evasive proc emote and animation were triggering every 10 seconds or so event though I didn‚Äôt even have the perk.
---
I mean OP literally said if you enjoy the game thats fine, but if you enjoy a bad game you have to be willing to admit its a bad game. 
---
A randomly generated dungeon sounds like a nice idea. Unsure about turning existing vaults into ones though.
---
Diablo III got a rift system that has randomly generated dungeons, could work for FO76 too but I'm unsure about how lore friendly that is.
---
Who else would I be speaking for? Glad you could bold something and feel important tho.
---
Of course of course its entirely up to you man thats why im saying we just have different values/perspectives its totally cool. 
---
I hope they don‚Äôt disappoint you.
---
Buy it when it's good. Not when it's released.
---
They could go make a fo76imquittingQQ sub and go there instead. 
---
I come here looking for informative information about the game. Be it issues (bugs), interesting camps, weapons, builds, and funny stuff happening. 
---
rumor (noun)

Definition of rumor

1 : talk or opinion widely disseminated with no discernible source

2 : a statement or report current without known authority for its truth
---
I just posted above a list of changes in the games files. I also have confirmation that you cannot apply the red tactical headlamp you can find in game, because it asks for the entitlement. Anyone can confirm my findings if the open up the game files. I'm open to be challenged if I made a mistake somewhere, and ready to apologize. But until then I stand my ground.
---
I care enough for this game to spent hours of my life compiling a list of changes that few read and even fewer really understand. I get nothing out of it. If you believe that someone, somehow is profiting from this, please tell them to contact me. I want a share.
---
too heavy (until 3PM EST)
---
So that was stupid.
---
I dunno man I think you might have a bug, they die to 2 hits with my deathclaw gauntlet.  ^(/s)
---
Melee is king, somehow they sold us an online Fallout game and we STILL got Skyrim.
---
This needs to reach a wider audience, this is the only way to show we're done with the shit they're feeding us
---
Unfortunately most of those seem to be reasons for changes rather than descriptions of fixes.
---
I hope they give a better hot fix note after the maintenance occurs.
---
i never said that ALL the people whining were for 1 specific reason, especially TSE builds. I never owned a TSE weapon and still affected by this change.  It made a character i worked hours on unviable and not playable anymore.  White knight isn't the problem also, its the materials that are needed to repair the armor.  Needing those fibers all the damn time is worse than a chore.  It forces everybody to get into power suits 90 percent of the time because power armor is cheaper to maintain.
---
Allow ammo to be sold !
---
I like how they tried to frame this like a good change.
---
I even saw people cheering for it, because now "cap stashes wouldn't all be taken by other players!"
---
I tried to warn them that this was not a good change.
---
That this was putting less caps in our pockets.
---
Half of the cap stashes I opened Tuesday afternoon gave me 1 cap, last night none of them refreshed for me.
---
Whelp.
---
That was a few weeks ago? Holy shit, it felt way longer than that.
---
We just pushed a new Inside The Vault article [here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/7DVp0EfSlQgspUWrcMzI1O/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-31-2019)that I think addresses some of these thing's you are mentioning here. We touch on reasoning behind some patch decisions and feedback.

---
The most recent patch broke the ability of the game to Craft or Repair using Bulked Items.
---
Unbulk everything and you should be good.
---
\----------------------------------------
---
If that doesn't work, sometimes the Benches don't synch with your Stash.  Go open your stash, then go back to the bench.  It should work then.
---
Hope that helps :)
---
My experience has been just the opposite. But, most people don't know how to bitch correctly to get the proper results. Your last paragraph sums it up correctly. 
---
As a side note, I actually feel sorry for the Community Manager for this game.
---
*sticks finger in mouth, flicks out making popping noise, and twirls finger in air like helicopter*
---
Already done.  ^-^  Replaced it on my game SSD with "Resident Evil 2."  
---
Did I get it right: you're saying that a PA crafted at 1 INT and fully repaired to 200% would be same as a freshly crafted PA at 50 INT?
---
They using it as as a protest to community managers etc. they don‚Äôt want to quit but are pretty much being forced to. 
---
Don't know if it tracks PS4, but I just uninstalled. The game isn't worth playing in its current state. All I do is play with the CAMP, and I hit max budget on my house yesterday.

i have bought some stuff from Atoms earned in game. /shrug Paying real world money? I won't do that. It has nothing to do with not wanting to reward them or whatever -- their prices are so absolutely ridiculous I can't even begin to justify it. Maybe if things were 1/10th the current cost I'd reconsider, but honestly, even $1.80 for one power armor skin is pretty ridiculous. What did Wasteland Workshop cost again? I'm not sure -- I had the season pass.
---
The funny thing is, I know they're counting on "whales" to buy atoms, but they'd make so much more money on atom sales if they made them worth 10x as much (5000 atoms for $5).
---
here is to hoping...  
---
One response so far, and it seems canned, but still hopeful.
---
Wow, thanks for the heads up man!
---
I've been wondering that FOREVER.  Now I can craft my own PA once I get some more unyeilding pieces of armor.
---
they nerfed licenced plumber/WK to give it a more balanced pick rate ...lolok that sounds believable...
---
Yes, that's exactly the OP's topic. Definitely makes it impossible for a long range kill. The other peoples post is the temporary fix. Stand still, go invisible, switch weapons around, and your weapons re-appear, but your body is still invisible.. I just wonder what other players see.. is there a floating weapon?
---
Mine bugs out with under armor, the colors bleed through. :/
---
Hearing people on mics is pretty rare on PC in my experience, but last weekend got listen in on a guy who was pissed that he had been exposed to measles.
---
(CrabRave.mp4)
---
They acknowledged Heavy Weapons!
---
It must be a bug not affecting everyone because I haven't noticed a difference. 
---
U a duper?
---
That‚Äôs fascinating. I wonder what the alliance is lore-wise that they‚Äôd be sharing a cap pool, is there is one.
---
Good things come to those who wait.
---
This is not the damage bug. If you remember the damage bug, the only thing it never effected was melee. You could have all your guns glitched out and not doing any damage, then pull out your super sledge and start wrecking everything.
---
Sounds like server lag, which I‚Äôve noticed has increased a fairly noticeable amount since the patch.
---
I never said they didn't look good, i just can't stand for the practices behind them giving health. 
---
I'm sure it would make a difference, the question is whether it would be a positive one or not. Playing devil's advocate: I could see more microtransactions being added to games to combat what would possibly be percieved as poor reception of the games and poor pre-sales.
---
Yay bulk/scrap fix! The material hoarder that has OCD issues thank you very much!
---
The Shit Show.
---
I suggest you read one of the hundreds upon hundreds of other posts from people, some just like you, that have finally, reluctantly come to the conclusion that Bethesda just does not know what the fuck they are doing with this game.
---
I am referring more to the coding of the game.  Fallout 76 was built on a single player engine that was converted for multiplayer.  That is the reason why it is riddled with bugs, hackers, and other issues.  I just don't think it is suitable for multiplayer.  The foundation needs to be reworked, meaning the engine.  They need to rent out a multiplayer engine or something.
---
Follow up..  
---
I cannot reproduce and submit the log, the patch has quite literally made it impossible for me to play the game, which is why I made the [Bethesda the Mod Author community has been try to provide fixes to you since the BETA. You are still ignoring us and not using them.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljowa/bethesda_the_mod_author_community_has_been_try_to/). Post.  
---
The most recent update, and happy to go into details, not only destroyed my entire play style, but had made it so none of the characters, on all (3) of my accounts can Buy/Sell/Trade/Loot, even the un-encumbered ones.... And no, before you ask, it's not mods causing it. 
---
Yeah understandable but honestly I have 11 supply drop holotapes in my inventory right now. I don't play crazy amounts of time either. So I could see where if you played in a team you could definitely overuse these  things 
---
Getting downvotes for warning people not to be stupid.  Nice!
---
Then maybe don't keep coming to fo76 reddit and complaining about it.  If you don't like it, if you are done with it, then go the fuck away.
---
Not tried the new patch, of course for obvious reasons, but also, I've got other games to play and adulting to do. Fingers crossed they fix it but if not, moving on to other things in life (and other video games) until the next patch and also new content which I'm excited for. 
---
I see what you're saying. The predominant patch updates have been community directed and Everytime they patch, there's massive backlash from the community. 
---
So the concept of the agile approach is going to continue to use the community,as such the community has a responsibility to provide Bethesda with a realistic criticism rather than upvoting and inconvenience in the game so Bethesda changes it immediately. That to me is what I'm seeing - the community is failing Bethesda and the circle comes around and they blame Bethesda for failing the community, a cause and effect, but the reality is the community is to blame for their own behavior whereas Bethesda is trying to please the popular opinion of a small % and not accounting for the other million players that haven't chimed in while the few thousand players are throwing fits. 
---
I totally understand what you mean, but it this case, the workload had a very high degree of parallelism. 
---
I don't want to argue, and you are 100% correct that a studio with all the inside know how should be able to complete a sanity check quite quickly.
---
This is the most transparent inside the vault ever and it's going to piss everyoff because they got what they asked for its going to be a gorgeous zhit show just remember your poncho we are in the splash zone
---
Ha, I Haven't had that happen yet, but I guess I will definitely keep that in mind.
---
So that's why barbarian stopped working for me?  I just gave up on it and chalked it up as a lost 3 points.  Nice to finally know the reason.  Anyone know if this was fixed?
---
Everyone that actually was high level and cared about nuke areas were melee before the TSE weapons. It was ridiculous how weak guns were. I remember when I got to level 100 and went with friends to silos. I would tickle enemies while my friends with CRAP legendary affixes could one shot stuff left and right. 
---
Lets be real, weapons only became viable after TSE. No matter how many people come and say "oh I swear I tested they are still fine!" they are not. My 50 cal tse barely tickles enemies now. Its ridiculous. Its a fucking gun used in combat veicules but for some reason its weaker than a board in this crap game.
---
Still goes again most countries consummer law.
---
I know that it would not even pass the court system test in canada (at least for Quebec....here consumer protection law is mostly provincial domain)
---
Melee needs a nerf too. They both needed a nerf. TSE, TS and E were nerfed too much. no one should be one shotting anything that's a higher level than your weapon other than a scorchbeast 
---
You figured wrong. You aren't a mind reader.
---
My better half by 14 levels. I'm 101 he is 116

Sooo... you had no point to make and therefore tried arguing the meaning of a phrase rather than an opposing point, then resorted to insulting me because again you have no point and are wrong. Got it. Bye kid.
---
I'm still tweaking my heavy weapons TSE gatling build, mainly cause gatling gun fuck yeah, but also now they announced a heavy weapons buff in the near future and I'm sure TSE will be re-balanced again, most likely somewhere in the middle ground of then vs. now
---
There should be a manager / keeper overseeing pull requests (assuming bethesda is even advanced enough to be using git) though. The devs might be overworked, but so what, this is change control's job. If they don't have the proper management structure in place for this kind of crap, it's just pure incompetence from leadership. Somebody should honestly be canned for being this bad at management. It's not a grunt problem that branches were merged incorrectly. That happens all the time comparative to badly merged branches going into PRODUCTION haha really. That's amateur. Worse than amateur.
---
oh ok that's helpful but still makes no sense 
---
Lol I like this, I might do this as well. I wonder if I can order bulk bottle caps...
---
They wanted to delay the anger as long as they could.
---
Agreed, all of the salt in this sub is really a debbie downer
---
I‚Äôve spent lots of time in 76 and only now am I upset that my tse gun is worse than a basic sledgehammer 
---
Except this was never and isn‚Äôt a bug currently. The damage bug never effected melee weapons. I wish people would think at least for a few seconds before they start blabbing and making accusations.
---
Usually they have to end up going back and rewording things on their notes based on how it turns out in game, so assuming they want to implement things before saying it yet just to make sure its somewhat accurate 
---
I snooped through your it history to see if I could find what platform you're on. I didn't see it (might just be me!) but I did see that you're autistic! I am too.
---
If you are, in fact, on PC like I am, I would like to help you out in the game (be it questing or building or whatever. I have most building things unlocked.) My username is totally_ratical :)
---
No they cant. Dont be hostile and not even make a point. 
---
Didn't they just talk about the survival server stuff coming up the other week? &gt;.&gt;
---
SBQ has primary rewards?! Say wha?
---
Yeah purifiers messed up.
---
I play FFIV and was thinking this exact same thing this morning.  One of the most disastrous mmos is now imo the best out there and still making hand of fist with a subscription model no less.
---
Yoshi P come save Fallout!
---
A lot of still enjoy the game, my best friend, my girlfriend and I still enjoy and play the game quite often... it‚Äôs still a good game, the company behind the game keeps screwing up.. they were starting to get a lot better and most of the people now posting the negative comments were mostly happy.. they will get back to how they were.. it‚Äôll just take time.. 
---
Oh did they 'promise' that? That's funny! Guess you'll be waiting til Q2 2020
---
A lot of people *have* quit though.
---
Would Uninstalling would loose all your progress?  
---
I tried finding a gif of it to properly express how much I don't care but was unsuccessful.
---
I think it's Silva Farm that has the chlorine bags (in one of the barns).
---
I was searching there for fertilizer the other day, saw the bags, and was like fertilizer JACKPOT!
---
Nope, it was chlorine.
---
PS4 player here and can confirm after spending a ton of ammo last night in Watoga to reach the vendor.
---
I like how your numbers add up to 105%
---
I bought the Silver Shroud outfit.  What do I win?
---
Yeah no the game's absymal don't get me wrong, I just like the simplicity of it
---
This game is awesome! Especially with fixes. All those other guys will just miss out. 
---
Did everyone forget about the Mistress of Mystery's Danger Room?
---
I am still holding out hope that it involves a horde mode, or something. 
---
XB1 !!
---
I‚Äôd like to offer that pushback for the 99% of people who are complaining about things, leaving crocodile tears while saying they‚Äôre quitting, or trashing the game because they‚Äôre mad a duped (or not) horribly overpowered weapon that never should have existed got nerfed...ISNT DEFENDING BETHESDA. It‚Äôs targeting a whiner who is having an internet temper tantrum
---
Are there legit problems with the game? Hell to the yes. I don‚Äôt like the awful server instability that causes crashes in the middle of buying a plan I server hopped 30 times for. I don‚Äôt like server crashes caused by people duping. I don‚Äôt like a trash ass loser breaking someone‚Äôs camp with a TSE weapon cause they‚Äôre mad you also occupy their camp space when they log in
---
And I I‚Äôm sure we can all agree bobby-pins becoming lead lined again is annoying, along with weight limits and stash restrictions. My best collection hogs so much space it‚Äôs unreal. 
---
But when people do nothing but whine and complain and bitch bitch bitch in 95 percent of comments, it makes this entire sub toxic. I get that you‚Äôre upset. I am too. But I can‚Äôt even post a question without it hitting page 15 faster than /b/ on 4chan. And I know you all know what I mean
---
If you wanna quit or take a break, go ahead. You may not be as missed as you believe. When you come back, people will still love you and welcome you back. Maybe it‚Äôd do you some good to get out from behind the screen
---
So don‚Äôt you get mad at the push back from people who aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwhiny entitled pricks‚Äù because we are enjoying an 80% good game, regardless of flaws. We aren‚Äôt defending Bethesda. We are defending our experience and enjoyment. And people are ruining that in game and on Reddit. THAT is the biggest problem of all. 
---
A solid response. Give them time people, they are working on things. 
---
As a side note, we really need a weight reduction on rifles in general.
---
Doesn't help the compass is off center
---
Probably just their standard policy in case the patch notes mention any exploits that they are patching. If they prereleased the notes it would give people a chance to log on and make use of the exploit asap before they took the servers down.
---
They're probably still compiling all the notes and trying not to miss major changes/fixes (again).
---
Patch notes going live at maintenance is fine. Earlier is better, obviously, but I'd rather they come a bit later and be more comprehensive than be rushed out and incomplete. Because that just leads to more angry players.
---
And the real time VATS feels a lot more realistic to me too
---
20-2-7
---
Probably a week before valentine's day?
---
That still means the game ins't selling.
---
&gt;I paid full price for a AAA game and expect AAA, fully priced quality!
---
So fucking entitled.
---
&gt;Why wasn't the game finished when it was released?
---
Stop complaining. We're lucky Bethesda is releasing anything at all. If they don't fix it, mods will... So what's the problem?
---
&gt;Bethesda just updated the game and caused more problems. Again.
---
All these ungrateful haters. This has to be a troll account.
---
*Bethesda Fans - They Just Work*
---
Prove me wrong then smartass
---
throw a thimble full of water on a raging dumpster fire
---
It's funny that we would rather spend our money on things like this rather than their atom shop. 
---
Well it only gives health if the people buy into it, or if you roll around in a max sized groups, a lot of players either roll around alone or with one or two friends, or spend their atoms on C.A.M.P.S products! 
---
TLDR, he is *quitting* because he is waiting for the next patch. End.

I'm not saying it saves the game wise ass I'm saying I like it
---
This is the benefit of this sub-Reddit and YouTube videos. Despite its shortcomings and many using their video's for monetary gain.
---
m8 simply adding new servers that dont have slap isnt conent
---
Too bad your name isn't OneSilentLeaving then you wouldn't have to make this post.
---
instead of breaking demolition expert, why wouldn't they just make it so it wouldn't apply to weapons with the legendary explosive mod?
---
further, why is the answer to make everything tedious? if some perks feel like you *need* them bc they're that good, why not make the rest of the perks that way, instead of making them undesirable?
---
and to reinforce the fact that they haven't been listening, they mention the increase in plan prices, but no mention of vendor caps. 
---
communication is always appreciated, but man, this is not the response you would think they would want to give with the storm brewing out there. they're making a mistake by not addressing the community.
---
At this point they'll probably leave F76 off their dev resumes when changing jobs, like CGI programmers who worked on The Phantom Menace.
---
It has its issues that can be fixed, however if people arent vocal to an extreme, no company will care enough to fix it
---
My guess was the surprise carry limit and bobblehead fix for dupers.
---
Their characters are handicapped until they dump the majority of their excess weight.

Lmao man you get so offended on behalf of a corporation.   It's so sad.
---
You sir have absolutely no idea what you‚Äôre talking about and clearly have never coded or even heard of PMG.

---
Damn... I‚Äôm kinda happy I haven‚Äôt gone with it in that case... I haven‚Äôt bought any of them.. I wear power armor mostly if not in power armor I‚Äôm wearing a full set of Marine armor and the fire breathers helmet lol
---
A lot of people can afford to buy them. The point is that it's an item that is available for purchase that can give others the upper hand. None of this is about if someone can afford it. This is about fairness. 
---
Every player shouldnt be carrying a 1 shot pvp kill. 
---
Ranged dmg shouldnt ever be a 1 shot pvp kill. 
---
Pvp balance is better after the patch.
---
They just need to adjust npc enemy health pools and armor ratings so you guys get the pve playstyle you are used to. 
---
I like the nerf, but im a pvp melee player. 
---
Don't count on Anthem. It's also broken. Wait a few months. 
---
Probably =\]
---
Ok thanks man
---
Man, so nice to see someone putting this in correct context.  I really can't stand the people who continue to whine and cry and go on like this is the last straw in some greater conflict and now is the time for revolution.
---
The worst part about all the whining is we know damn well these people are still playing the game.  Half of them have super powered characters in the 150 range and are still playing 4 months later despite having complained from day one. 
---
IF you hate the game, go the fuck away and play one you don't.
---
I get that you don't like seeing it.  But people are very unhappy and venting their frustrations via the only method the developers might see it.  They can't know what people don't like, if people don't say anything.
---
I made a post about how to take a more balanced / nuanced approach to the whole patch deal here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/)
---
If people don't provide feedback like this, we'll keep getting more of the same.  I don't want people to quit the game, I want the game to improve :)
---
Yup, I actually got the advanced switches plan before the powered door. I remember getting it to work properly once, but at the expense of a lot of CAMP budget from running so many wires and storing them to get things right. Think the wire budget bug was messing with things. I‚Äôll test it later.
---
but it's not the policy OP wants!!!
---
Queuing up for a server with 7+ friends to deal with griefers targeting low levels around Flatwoods. We even found their bases and razed them to the ground. They got butthurt majorly when dosed with their own medicine. 
---
What went wrong isn't in the hotfix.
---
I think they are releasing a known bug list today and maybe a road map i have to read the last part of the inside the vault again 
---
I bet it does indeed.
---
What is the thematic reason for magical weapons that have bullets that magically double themselves or magically explode or magically inflict more damage on particular type of critter? I agree 100% that the game mechanisms should cleave to the thematic aspects of the world, but Bethesda does not.
---
I'd say we are way past "shit show". At this point it's more of a comedy and this is why I'm sticking around. I mean the game is still fun as a single player game i gotta give em that. But once you are done exploring and questing it all just falls apart: there's nothing but bugs, crap mechanics and weird "balance" patches. And worst of all they did nothing to show us that they know what they are doing. Actually let me rephrase that: they did everything they possibly could to show us that they have no idea what to do with this game. They did fix some bugs, added some QoL features but this train is going nowhere and the last patch is proves it.
---
Fuck man, *you* and your friends should be fortune tellers and make a fortune, if you only weren't wasting time hating on a game you don't even play.
---
Shush.
---
But I didn't have Rad Worms.

Shit, they only give 20 Atoms for that?  Cheapskates.
---
There is plenty wrong with my game but after about a month the people complaining the most are still playing and my question is why? No one is forcing you to play. Some people just wanna complain. I love the game and I really wish "the vast majority" would simply stop playing and let the rest of us enjoy it in peace. 
---
Bravery does go hand in hand with stupidity sometimes so it's not wrong.
---
You know I agree with alot of you that Bethesda needs to be held accountable for this mistake. At this stage they need to release the files to the public so the modding community can fix the game. We all bashed Hello games when no mans sky came out, but at least they fixed there game and owned up to messing it up. To this day they are still adding new free content to there game. Point is Bethseda needs to grow up and call it a failure, just release the game files to us to do the dam game for them.
---
no.
---
My friend has been having this same problem pre-patch as well.  I can also confirm that I have seen the problem occur myself on PC but not as consistently as he seems to have been having the problem.  Not sure if he has had it worse since the patch or not as we don't team up until the weekends due to difference in work schedules.
---
It turns into a meat pile. You have to look for the meat pile.
---
Yeah I've got those feels man. I also got a friend to buy the game and I even bought a few copies for some friends to play with me. But it's just so bad that none of my friends will play with me, they'd rather play just about anything else but this. I mean I really enjoy the game but it has so many problems it drives off most people.
---
i will add my voice to the chorus of how much did you (you all) craft to get flagged for duping?  
---
i got the handmade plans and made roughly 50 crafts of lvl 15 handmades and immediately broke them down to get all the modifications. i regularly pull 200 dirty water then boil then for 100 boiled water to then use in crafting 20 cranberry relish and other foods.   
---
Am I getting or dancing on the edge of getting a ban? I just picked up the lever gun plans when server hopping right before the update and hadnt had a chance to craft a bunch to break down for plans yet now im a lil troubled not wanting to skirt the invisible line and lose everything i have worked for the last couple months.
---
The pay the win aspect is the temporary health increase. 
---
I convinced one friend to pre order the game with me, I made it up to him by gifting him another game, granted a cheaper one lol.
---
Just cause you enjoy the game, doesn't mean it's good or it doesn't have serious flaws. With your logic, I can say Ride to Hell is an objectively good game and it should get game of the decade.
---
There's your opinion, then the general consensus which is a majority's opinion. You may like it, but if the majority, both players and professional critics, say it's bad, then it most likely is bad.
---
I'm new to online gaming but not new to Fallout games. Yes, I have had big bugs like mission needed items getting scrapped and not a way to recover and the little amusing bugs like nude players running in place. But, I'm mostly having fun and after writing in about my bug it got fixed.  They made a product, people expected more, their business model went morally bankrupt etc. are valid complaints but I don't feel any of it. This is a game, entertainment like a movie.
---
I forgot about ammo when I talked about the resource grind - its definitely a big part of what contributes to the resource grind.  At some point, ammo is a large part of the resource grind for players - and why resource grinding changes hurt.
---
Ammo for types we don't need, we can't even sell - though I imagine they'd need to introduce a bulk option to sell unneeded ammo off to the vendors.  If I could sell 5mm at 1 cap per, I'd easily exhaust my vendor cap limits pretty quickly.
---
Yeah maybe the queen could drop some legit weapons/armor instead of plans now everyone already has.
---
Why does Flatwoods man remind me of Tom Brady?
---
Who enjoys playing it? I'm curious. This was the last place on the Internet where people "liked" (more like tolerated) this garbage. And all I see now around here is people quitting, anger and frustration... and I **love** it.
---
No its not that, i want bethesda to wake up, unless servers empty more then it wont happen 
---
If someone plays a shit game for 760 hours is the game really at fault?
---
[deleted]
---
...you know there are weapons besides AAE, right?
---
Top comment
---
yea, Explosive Vents duh.
---
To get more taste ultracite PA? Yay lol
---
If it lets me burn a design into the moon from stealth, than I'm all about it
---
OMG!!!  YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!
---
See this? Someone reads my notes with proper care. And I am stupid and I make mistakes.
---
I went over those again and saw that I c/ped the wrong values for those field. The correct one are:  
---
- `MoM_Armor_MistressOfMysteryOutfit "Garb of Mysteries"` KEYWORD `isUnstoppable_MistressOfMystery` **added**
---
- `ATX_Clothes_Unstoppables_GrognakCostume "Grognak Costume"` KEYWORD `isUnstoppable_Grognak` **added**
---
Thank you /u/neokronx for spotting those.
---
    SURV_ReduceDiseaseResistance_Potion_Effect "SURV_ReduceDiseaseResistance_Potion_Effect"
---
    duration **reduced** from 7200 to 900
---
This would imply the disease resistance effect from RadAway had it's duration considerably reduced. Since this is a negative effect (easier to get diseases), seems like this is actually a beneficial change.
---
r/enlightenedcentrists
---
It is a video game, there is no reason valid reason to accept pay to win practices. 
---
I would say someplace around the National Radio Astronomy Research Center.
---
300+ hours of entertainment - if I never touch it again I'll be satisfied with that
---
we uninstalled yesterday, a flood of others have as well. its letting the devs know we are not going to pay for their mistakes and downright disrespect anymore. 
---
Yup sounds about right except I had to kill her 5 times before it realised it should give me the second shower plan and quest comePM late. Guess what already bought the damn plan.
---
We are working on that.
---
I think you're spending too much time trying to draw attention to yourself, if you don't want to play the game then just don't play it. Your first point can be easily reversed. You don't like it, great for you, bye-bye. I'm not simultaneously defending Bethesda when I say that, I'm just saying you're a little whiner and you're not helping anything.
---
Considering none of this was mentioned in OP's post, you seem to be projecting a bit.  Why don't you make like the order of mysteries and disappear?
---
Wow so edgy, you must be a super cool person.
---
Yes but its nice to have OP weapons
---
So you don't care about the future of the game? Sensible tbh
---
I don't know man, at some point "these two skeletons are hugging! what a deep game todd howard" has run really thin. How many times do they expect us to be super impressed that they wrote a secret side story and that the secret is a lovecraft cult? This is the third game that has that, they did it multiple times across DLC and they do it twice at least in this game. There is no deep story you gotta play 400 games to see, just more reused assets.   
---
Yeah, I'm sure it was the IM QUITTING posts that got the hotfix out lol.
---
Just.... Go away. Real tired of the "why is no one listening to me?!? I MATTER TOO!". Find something else to do with your time. Everyone here hates you. I sure do!
---
You couldn't stop acting like a dick if you tried lmao
---
top kek
---
No they balanced the game so everyone has to use a PA melee build
---
The free market disagrees.  Capitalism is one of the hearts of this game, just ask Mr. Gutsy what he thinks about Commies.
---
Kinda but its really hard defending them at this point. Damage nerf across the board (except melee), degradation of all armor is getting more grindy, not to mention all the stuff before the recent patch. What redeeming traits are left... :( 
---
C'mon, some of us love FO76.  But, then, I owned a copy of ET for Atari 2600.  And I played it.  So, what do I know.  
---
\#oldasfuckgamer
---
This is blasphemy! 
---
And here we have it, one of the few people in this thread with any actual common sense.
---
you having never played the game don't understand...."it just works"...
---
Don't mind me, just here for the comments üëÄ
---
It gives a slight advantedge... I agree it‚Äôs a step in the wrong direction for a short period of time.. but they have had one giant step in the wrong direction between that and there patch.. the only way it gives its full advantedge, as slight as it may be, is in a party of four with everyone wearing it.. that‚Äôs not too often.. if they took a bigger step in the wrong direction not for a short event, but for a longer period of time, I would have to agree even further. But, I can only slightly agree. I see the advantedge it offers, but it only offers it for maybe, MAYBE, 1% of players..  and only for four more days.. I would say it could be more considered a ‚Äúpay for an advantedge‚Äù not a p2w... 
---
Don't forget to get your heads out your arses before you choke.
---
Shoot a .44 pistol at sqb, nice damage. **Not** a single action revolver .44
---
Don't bother arguing with these guys. I don't care if they enjoy the game, everyone has their own opinion. But to say the game is "good" and "they didn't do it on purpose", they are obviously drinking the koolaid.
---
The only way you can prevent this is to logout. Nothing would piss them off more than seeing the camp they're destroying 'disappear'. Try to write down their names first and add them to your block list so they can't find you on another server and try to grief you again. They're probably using the Wrecking Ball perk.
---
on the side bar on the right hand side of the sub. not far underneath the active/subscribed users. it says 'show my flair on this subreddit. it looks like:' and then below it says your un. right next to it, it says 'edit.' click that and pick your flair.
---
Honestly happy my tse guns got nerfed. Most likely not the only one in thinking that they made the game too easy and not as fun. 
---
 I think the issue is all the crashes blue screens crappy gameplay missions, laser weapons, rocket launchers, nukes, grenades and others being obsolete. Perk cards nerfed that shouldn't have like repairing 
---
So, you joined Reddit this month, and almost your entire post history is about bashing the company.. Did you really need to add this topic to your list? troll
---
Just use the Mistress of Mysteries dress that is available in game.
---
I don‚Äôt play those games so I‚Äôd don‚Äôt care about them.
---
\&gt; If you're done with FO76, Uninstall
---
Tried. That's broken too.
---
You just need to use your fists, weapons have been nerfed into uselessness so we can't level up so fast. lol
---
no, I just couldn't care less if a bunch of spoiled children on reddit quit the game.
---
I‚Äôd love a daily reset. As it stands now, if I played late the night before and - gosh forbid I do this with items I‚Äôve earned in the game Bethesda - that means I cannot do it at all for almost a full day. So then I either play early and drop everything since the struggle with inventory management is such a suck fest OR I don‚Äôt play the game when I wanted to as intended. 
---
The legal and monetary issues surrounding allowing modders to change the game are huge.
---
Won't happen.
---
I do. I when I sign in I am not the only one in the server, there are 23 other people. Probably would be more if the servers held more than 24 people at a time.
---
If you think people screeching "I quit" after a nerf patch represents anything, I doubt you play a lot of mmos....
---
Who is we and i doubt people uninstalled it you weren't a giant activist group or anything like i said before my guess is half of the I QUIT posters didn't even uninstall 
---
Why do you care if someone plays a video game?
---
You make some solid points and you could be correct, but in the end, what matters to me in this moment, is knowing I atleast tried one more time before walking away.
---
Sorry man, there were glimmers of hope there but when I think of good games, I can't exactly place F76 even on the same planet as God of War or RDR. The game was fun for awhile but it sadly just got boring to me after 3 weeks or so.   People are mad at the moment but hey if you like the game and you enjoy it who cares right? :).
---
Dont forget that they'll pass this info along
---
that's because it don't exist
---
If it was 25% increase.. it would most definitely be p2w, or even more could be considered, especially if it wasn‚Äôt an event... it‚Äôs more like the strange in number perk.... 
---
You don't understand.
---
A 1* TS Handmade sucks now.
---
A 2* anything with explosive sucks now.
---
I cant find anything on the hotfix,  any word on what they are trying to "hotfix"?
---
Right, so if everyone wouldve said they loved the patch would there have been a hotfix? 
---
No, Im on PC. Stay thirsty, my friend. :D
---
That sounds much better than regular manta man! Lol
---
Buy more
---
Because people want to enjoy the game they bought? If their complaints are valid, and they mostly are, why should they not voice them?
---
Ya know...fallout 76 is not a bad game...free glitches but overall it's good...but all the babies that keep crying about it...grow up...it's a game...play a diff game of ya don't like it...be part of the solution,not the problem
---
Class! lol
---
I agree. I love the YouTube videos Oxhorn has been kinder than most and he‚Äôs actually playing it through. I can‚Äôt not play this game, the will to hunt and find better junk, weapons etc. It‚Äôs like I have to keep playing. 
---
Oh, I did not know THAT.  You, sir, are now my favourite redditor!  Thanks!
---
Dang, I was really trying to engage legitimately. Maybe if I just ranted and gotten really salty?  But you would have found a reason to disregard that as well?
---
The pedestal of "I don't cheat" is really not that high, though, is it?
---
&gt;yes but its nice to have OP weapons
---
...ah
---
Don't even know where to start on that one. AAE isn't even the best option right now lol
---
 Misery sucks. ;) Well I think so. I like Oblivion Lost and of course the unparalleled Narodnaya Solyanka myself. I like COP least of the three.  
---
You know they have been banning people for crafting massive amounts of ammo with the super duper perk right?
---
A PSN friend was helping a lot of guys who didn't have the super duper rank 3 perk card and Ammo smith perk card at level 2. He was using their materials and his materials and did this for about 3 days. Well, right after the patch he was trying to log in and it said his account was deactivated. He received a temporary ban email from the bots. Basically stating that he has been found guilty of if a duplication glitch error and with the massive amount of items that he had on his character and influx of currency to his account he was flagged (paraphrasing). 
---
So, he is waiting to get his account back into the green but he has no proof of video of his crafting just some Facebook posts in his forum.
---
So, with this being said, they assume that their own perk card "Super Duper" is a glitch dupe inducing flags to accounts. Craft enough in any given time frame and you may be banned by the new system they have in place. Be careful! That's another reason why I uninstalled the game yesterday. I'd rather not get banned and lose my Tricentenial edition over some bot program flagging me for doing the exact thing that he did as a service to the FO community. 
---
Stay Frosty.
---
If it weren't the Creation Engine I'd say it might be possible to do this as an honest mistake.
---
Creation is built to make this sort of thing easy and transparent - you can just dupe a BaseID entry (which will give it a new, unique ID) making it a separate thing that you can now edit and spawn RefID's from.  
---
Instead someone just went and skipped the dupe step and edited the original entry directly.
---
Upvoted for truth! Lol. Someone reported me because they didn't like my opinions. So sad! I used and f-word and got in twouble!
---
I bought 4 copies of this previous known as game. 1 for me and 3 for friends. At full cost....
---
TSE needed to be nerfed.
---
Bobblehead stacking needed to be nerfed.
---
True, but you'd pay more, if not just for your first 40 packs.
---
I am sorry...for insulting something that doesn't just not exist, but something that is foreign to Bethesda ;v
---
At the very least perception should stack and give the same buff to a rifle build...
---
But for how long? At some point, you need to give players something to keep them interested, otherwise you‚Äôll lose them by the time you get the game in a better place
---
Check out FreakEasy.
---
Why was it deleted?
---
Maybe for the pro tier players that have their builds nailed down to a perfect min / max.
---
For average players, I don't find any one champ that absolutely destroys me.  I play ranged, mages, and support mainly.  I know what the other champs are capable of and I don't try to face tank melee, dps, or tanks.
---
And as for over-nerfing...........can you link a patch note from League where they reduced the damage output of a SINGLE champ 80% and didn't touch any of the other champs?  They might get a little too heavy on the nerf on one patch, but they bring it back later.  I've seen one of my mains get nerfed one patch, buffed the next, nerfed the next, and buffed again.  They honestly try to even it out.
---
what's the blade of bastet do?
---
Lmfao
---
Meh, should still one-shot a level 52 Gutsy from stealth. You'll want a backup weapon now though.
---
A player probably had a few with the intention of farming Queen, but sold em to free up some weight.
---
Lol, I'm not triggered I'm just laughing at how stupid you are.
---
Please link me an example. And the server shutdown guy said it so they can fix their game not to do it permanently........... reading is sometimes hard i know
---
Looks like some coders that work there need more supervision. Trust, but verify.
---
If you're serious about wanting to profit, turn it into a YouTube vid, this is way more than ten minutes worth to be monetized!

Also https://i.imgur.com/ImUeFY5.png please fill out this form 
---
They should have worked on things before releasing the game and several editions worth more than just the standard game. 
---
I can't even buy any of those they only want other bloody/explosive guns but the drop rate/quality in this game is so bad. Sad times.
---
I wish my TSE Minigun was still good.
---
Wow, coincidentally we posted at the same minute check mine out! I'd also be curious about any role playing 'tubers.
---
None of those games have online multiplayer, except for RDR2 which is a pay to win horse riding simulator. 
---
That's a good start, but there are so many more problems that were created by the last patch that need to be fixed still.  How about when is the next patch after this going to come out?   
---
&gt; I also have confirmation that you cannot apply the red tactical headlamp
---
[Is that so?](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/388410058352099329/539970208522305540/Fallout_76_Screenshot_2019.01.30_-_00.48.44.66.png)
---
I've started a couple characters sure and other than doing dailies consistently I would say most of my play time is spent literally just fucking around. Trying stupid builds, helping people, trolling people, I've spent a lot of time building different camps:

That doesn't count how much time I'm just AFK because I'm doing something else or how much time I've played because it's middle of winter where I live and there's nothing else to do. There really isn't anything to do at 200-300 that the game is just going to give you though. Perhaps there are people are obsessive enough to keep running Whitesprings for 200-300 hours but I am guessing after a certain point most people find their own fun. The end-game has to be more than loot and numbers. If you min-max the game and dupe everything it will be super boring super fast. If you play with friends and like to fuck around living in the world you'll find things to do.
---
Server stability and client stability have both decreased for me after the last patch.   
---
I have also encountered the three star enemy vanishing after death bug recently 
---
Double fail
---
I hope they compensate EVERYONE who is playing through this 1000 atoms minimum at least.
---
This is great! But all this stuff is in script and I‚Äôm having a hard time making heads or tails of it. Any chance of a laymen‚Äôs terms version being released?  
---
AlexKGB is one I watch. He has a in depth knowledge of the technical aspects. 
---
I watch Oxhorn for lore and ManyATrueNerd for his play thru.
---
They aren't afraid to say something is bad or off, but they seem to have a genuinely fun time playig, exploring or learning.
---
Good one sheep.
---
I understand it sucks but how do you see doing 2k+ damage as fun? At these numbers you literally one shot all but maybe 3 creature. I have most of my build done and just scratch passed 800 sometimes but I have to be half dead aka unyeilding at 50%hp. Normally they do 300 diamage and 600 without buffs. Doing 1.4k more than a melee build is just stupid. Especially when I try to fight people in pvp which I like.
---
If he bought from Amazon, you can probably get a refund, anywhere else you probably SOL.
---
Always buy from Amazon.
---
So using one of the character slots to horde items is cheating to you? In a game about hording items? 
---
It's not an exploit, it's just a way of using a character. It doesnt go against ToS, it doesnt break the game.
---
Duping and weight glitches break the game.
---
Having people act as middle men or pack mules for groups isnt.
---
And there is arguments against it, how dare you claim such a logical fallacy.
---
Hey Autismteen, you can dislike what I said but it will never make it any less true.
---
ManyATrueNerd is fantastic!
---
Regift it back to him next year
---
Damn this should have a zillion upvotes but it doesn't because we have cwybabies who are cwitting the game. Wahhhh! Network admins who have awesome computer systems can't pway the game! Wahhhh! Am I being a cunt? Damn right.
---
I‚Äôd like to take a break but I only rotate around 3 games right now and I don‚Äôt have any money to buy more. 
---
People wake the fuck up. They have GOOD reason to not unban this guy and any of the other lying sacks of shit on this forum leaving out all the critical details that likely led to their ban. Read my reply to Vlads main post here and you will understand.
---
And now I buy bobby pin stock :/
---
Nothing says "I have nothing of value to add to this discussion" more than using the word toxic. 
---
Upvote the crap out of this well written post people! 
---
I especially agree with the vendor cap limit comments, this punishes players who can't play every day but can play for many hours at a time when they can.
---
You can turn those three points in rifle and shotgun into 30% damage increase by putting one point into the three separate damage cards for that weapon type. 
---
Yup I have the same problem.
---
No thanks.
---
Bethesda doesn't listen. It's better to create an uprising amongst the community. To organize like a labor union.
---
Go to any chem crafting station
---
Under the pull down menu can‚Äôt remember 
---
Lets you convert fertilizer to acid
---
Can‚Äôt remember the ratio fertilizer to acid
---
Off Topic: acid and cloth make gunpowder 
---
Or loot the muties
---
It's just another melee weapon. You get it through the Mistress of Mysteries questline.
---
It gives increased armor penetration which I've found super helpful.
---
Depends how long you've owned it and what retailer you went through
---
No 
---
I keep wondering about Enforcer, as someone who uses Enforcer.
---
IMO, nerf egregious stuff, but things like White Knight?  Leave it alone.  You aren't going to make every perk amazing.
---
She actually kind of hates it because she's not 12 anymore and it is unmistakably made for children, but hey, that's neither here nor there
---
That's not the glitch, it did not happen with melee.
---
Sure doesn't sound like they're going to remove the Ultracite PA plans from the SBQ loot table.  I don't understand their reasoning - if anyone who completes Belly of the Beast should be able to craft it, then very nearly everyone who contributes to an SBQ kill will already have the plans.  Now, if they only leave the Ultracite MOD plans, that'd make more sense.
---
About the same amount of kills. Same things except once I got the Plague Walker serum.
---
Other then that, vents and knuckles same as you. 
---
It‚Äôs a $60 beta apparently 
---
If it‚Äôs a digital copy, save the key and gift it to your next friend and have him sort this mess out 
---
Yup! Just remember you can‚Äôt repair stuff until it drops below 100% durability. I usually just use it normally then repair it with Fix It Good when I think I‚Äôll need max performance for something.
---
how much in percentage if you know please
---
Gtfo
---
They need to give it to Oblivion.
---
Psn store and a month or two? 
---
Not sure, did some runs around the fissures and maybe a bit more. I didn't notice much.
---
It's the polar vertex. The local municipality plowed in their Saab and they need somewhere to vent. 
---
I too am upset I passed on that.  I could do with purchasable legendary prefixes as mods.  Say 400 atoms for a Bloodied mod I can add to a crafted weapon.
---
That front porch is beautiful.
---
There are a lot of things in this game that need a nerf or a buff.
---
The fact that they realize that balance is a bit wack at the moment is a good thing.
---
The only real question is how fast we can get the bugs squashed and the game brought to stability.
---
welcome..im ps4 but its most likely the same
---
I‚Äôve been thinking of that, I‚Äôd like to experiment with different perks and builds and see how powerful (or useless) I can become 
---
....then proceed to breastfeed Pete
---
&gt;Yeah, so whats the deal with these EULAS in games, no one contest them or something? 
---
Essentially yes, I don't know how many average gamers can afford to lob a lawsuit at a multi-million to billion dollar company and hope having the funds to even see a day in court. So the challenge would need to be brought forth as a class action by a group of people who were harmed by the policy or by a regulator(y agency).
---
&gt;Isn't there laws about that in USA, of an EULA violating laws and making them invalid?
---
I'm not sure about in USA but anywhere with a system of law based on the Napoleonic model (most if not all of the free world), any part of a contract contrary to law is non-binding and is unenforceable, but here's the catch they will have to try to enforce it before you can file suit to get them penalized for attempting to enforce the unenforceable. This is why there are so many contracts in the wide world that have clauses that are illegal, it prevents many from thinking there is anything that can be done about unfair practices but it also means that in order to get results against the organization/person trying to enforce these clauses you need to drag them to court.
---
And, well as a lawyer I know says "You are innocent until proven insolvent". (No justice if you're broke)
---
A related problem with stealth:   If you are on a team, and one member of the team is detected, it seems like the whole team is exposed because no one can pull off stealth shots any more.
---
If there is an area of effect on a team mate being detected, that shouldn't apply to other team mates that are far enough away.  They should still be able to pull off stealth shots.   I'll be trying this some more over the next few days to see if I can ever get far enough away to pull off a stealth shot while on a team that is actively engaged in a fight.  
---
Todd didn't cuck you, you cucked yourself son
---
Yep 
---
But like don‚Äôt cheat...
---
Yeah, I loved Combat Shotguns in previous games but quickly realized there's little point in using one in 76.
---
316 days @ 24 hours a day... its honestly impossible.
---
Just a note for any Community Managers who might see this - your players would rather spend our money on reddit gold and sending bobby pins to Todd to highlight our frustration than purchase Atoms. 
---
I do not know, sorry. I'd love for someone to tell me as well!
---
Just start blocking them and voila! 
---
Aside from when it doesn't work, when does it work? Really? I quit the game awhile ago and hoped for real improvements bc of all of the disconnects and bugs i was experiencing. Maybe its gotten better but i recall disconnecting multiole times in a session (1-2 hours).
---
Dude.  Game's only been out for a couple of months.  Did you expect The Burning Crusade already?
---

Did you had it installed before patch v1.0.5.10 went live? Or you applied it afterwards? (Honest question)
---
See, they *said* they'd be giving us the server files when mod support launches so we could run our own servers.

Oh nice- so if I switch it once and a while it should stop. Thanks!

Don‚Äôt feel bad, me and a few buddies take turns buying a new game for each other when a new game comes out that we want to play together. Fallout 76 came out and it was my turn to buy this time. I purchased 4 copies. And I‚Äôm the only one who still plays the game. At least you bought your own copy and that‚Äôs it.
---
Yeah is sad they just flip everyone‚Äôs bars red and they call it content.
---
But that was a single player RPG completely different from an MMO
---
Also, if making a statement is what you are *honestly* looking to do, unsubscribe from this subreddit (and r/Fallout while you're at it), so you'll stop inflating the subscriber/active user numbers. Furthermore, stop talking about Fallout 76 completely, on forums, on YouTube videos, in tweets, and everywhere else.
---
Even negative feedback shows Bethesda that you care. Show them, and the world, that you don't care by removing this game and the Fallout franchise, and preferably Bethesda and all of their products, from your life completely.
---
PSN is able to look at your play time, so depending on how much time you spent on the game, maybe! If it's like people who played for 200 hours and want a refund, probably not. If it was just a couple of hours to try it out there's a chance. I dunno if they have different "levels" of customer service
---
We get it, you really wanted some karma.
---
Confused, did we read the same thing? This doesnt sound like a nerf.
---
**Energy and Heavy Weapons Improvements.** We've heard and  share your feedback that energy weapons need to be brought inline with  other weapon types. We're also looking to adjust laser weapon durability  in a future update. Additionally, after recent balance changes related  to Perks and Legendary Mods, players have expressed that explosive  non-legendary weapons are now less powerful. We agree there are  improvements we can make. We‚Äôre doing an audit of heavy weapons damage  and their ammo weights. We plan to increase damage in light of the perk  and mod reductions, and plan to reduce ammo weight to make heavy weapons  generally more viable. These adjustments will roll those out in a  future update.
---
it's likely client/server lag or timeouts. you fire some shots and the server update gets lagged or your client just doesn't get the response. You pick some berries or whatever and it updates inventory again and "corrects" the outstanding items on the local client.
---
It should probably just do this silently but for whatever reason it spams a notification that makes it look like stuff is randomly being dropped.
---
LOL!!
---
I guess it depends on how much Bethesda pays whoever makes that decision
---
The game will continue, I mean look at no man's sky it was a dumpster fire in an abortion clinic, then it leveled out and pushed on, now its enjoyable and a standard of what not to do... here's hoping Fallout 76 does not de-throne it...
---
Im going to have to agree with you on this. 
---
What Is unexcusable is that they're screwing up, but the fact they're atleast trying to fix it, shows that they have atleast some care for us.
---
Tho I'll admit I dont belive they'll actualy learn from their fuck ups. They sit down and get a long hard look at whats going on and try their best to not fuck up, listen to the community, and hope this wasnt the last nail in the coffin that'll seal the doom of the game.
---
The only thing they will notice is if we stop buying unfinished games and stop supporting this money grabbing shit. I loved bethesda but I for one wont buy any new game from them period. 
---
Yall ruined it. Great. Every new game is shit rn
---
Had a feeling you would starting harping on about specific genres. Either way those titles are universally considered great games that most would be willing to play 60-70 bucks for. F76 is considered a bad game by most so i would never call it a great game unless I was high on bath salts and hallucinating a decent Fallout multiplayer experience. 
---
Probably, I still tried my best to find the most legit people I could find. Should we just ignore trading is an aspect in the game because cheAters got to cheat to their hearts content and not get punished and reap all the benefits? Like what do you expect people to do. That said I overpayed on all my TSE, as a matter of a fact, I spent cap limit on my first TSE before the dupe glitch had even come out to everyone. Guess that must have been a dupe too right? 
---
I checked the forum and again people being mad and uninstalling the game are two different things you have no proof they uninstalled the game for all you know you are the minority 
---
My argument is, making WK less good doesn‚Äôt make it less mandatory at all. Decreasing armor degradation or making it cheaper to repair armor does. Why not do either of those before nerfing something and pissing off the player base?
---
I enjoy watching eNtaK.
---
You misunderstand - I‚Äôm not saying new content should be released by now. I‚Äôm just saying that they keep leading us on promising new information week after week
---
Interesting. I had multiple trusted reports of people not being able to apply a newly acquired one.  
---
I stand corrected. 
---
If you don't mind, do you have other types of PA to try this? I'm going through the files as we speak to check if the X-01 has something I missed
---
I wish you could over-repair even if it was above 100%.
---
My OCD makes me want to keep my weapons topped off.
---
I get that I'll be wasting materials I need to farm (but Bethesda seems to love that), so that's one grindy thing I'd like to see added....lol
---
Thanks, I came here for the same issue. Finding all the various bugs and glitches in '76 is almost a fun adventure in itself....*almost.*
---
It's extremely difficult to get a refund from the Playstation store at any time.  I would imagine it's impossible to get one after two months.  However, it never hurts to ask.  The worst they can do is say no.
---
I do not say this to be rude, but it appears you are delusional about what it takes to build content for a AAA game.  Ask the teams behind Sim Settlements, Fallout Miami, or Fallout New California if they could add "a couple raids" while simultaneously putting out the fires BGS has been doing.
---
Technically the UAW got what they organized for. It's just that they priced themselves out of a job.
---
For now we're not protesting for pay raises.......we want our wages back.
---
Twisted muscles is great but made my ts handmade a boat anchor. Couldnt hit the side of a barn with it after even with maxed class freak.
---
Most plain TS weapons and E weapons are not duped, and the perk cards that were nerfed are most definitely not duped, and I know a few people who built around those weapons. Who now are looking at 20 more levels to try to get a new viable build -- and when you're over level 250, that takes a long time. And then, who's to say that their new build won't be nerfed to unplayable.  
---
I think TSE needed nerfing. I think there would have been far better ways to do it than destroying many people's builds without allowing them to respec.  
---
FWIW, my build wasn't ruined. Yes, the explosives part was, but all that means is instead of grenades I do more melee. So this isn't sour grapes here.   
---
Honestly, what I would have liked to see is some changes to the way PVP damage works.
---
Serious question how old are you? If you are younger than 18 fine I get your attitude but if you are 18 or older, your attitude is pretty pathetic for your age.
---
Tell me which legendary affixes flatly add damage that is better.
---
Dude, I feel ya. I paid for this game for my friend (bc he couldn‚Äôt afford it at the time), and he said he‚Äôd pay me back. We played maybe 30hrs together and couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. I felt like a piece of shit asking for his money. Fuck this game, and fuck the way Bethesda handled it. 
---
well it should, its had how long to get all of its stuff together?
---
I wondered what happened to you guys. 
---
I'm not so sure bobblehead stacking is nerfed. I saw a guy one hit the queen over 3 nukes last night.
---
It happens to me too. I use a rocket, heated, lengendary bat. My impression is that it happens when  the target is inside my swing. If I back off a little and hit it again with the sweet spot of the bat, it takes damage.
---
It also could be that I'm a little too baseball focused. 
---
Way ahead of you fam.
---
I'd rather see intentionally designed dungeons resulting in uniquely fun encounters. Think of WoW (especially in the early days) where you get a little story via voice acted bosses. I think this makes more sense for Fallout where traditionally each vault has its own story. Further, each fight or encounter can be designed to require some strategy to beat.
---
Everything is fine. There are no bugs in Fallout 76, here in /r/fo76 we are safe, we are free. The Earth Emperor should invite you to Lake Laogai if you feel otherwise.
---
What game are guys playing? i want enemies to be harder lol, and i never had a tse gun.
---
With my full auto rifle i can 2-3 shot a 90+ deathclaw...
---
Sbq on the other hand is different, but thats one endgame boss....
---
Here come the "you didn't patch that rare occurrence that happened to me only once" comments.
---
I'm about to make another bag of popcorn for everyone. üçø
---
Yes.
---
By that reasoning xp farming, item farming, using public nuke codes, relogging etc are all "cheats". I used the system exactly as it was designed.
---
I'm not "outraged", I'm pointing out that at level 580 (with literally every perk maxed) and well over 1500 weight of valuable loot, there's not only nothing to be gained from leveling up but the update has made me unable to loot anything, because nothing I loot is better than my best 1500 weight. Without being able to loot anything else, there's nothing to be gained by even logging in.
---
I foresaw this as an issue before the game  even launched, which is why being able to use mules (like is common in many other games) was literally the main sticking point when it came to purchasing the game in the first place.
---
The game is no longer as it was sold, after I give them written notice and then the 30 days to rectify making the game unplayable for many of us high levels they can go ahead and refund me, my clan and anyone else in the EU now unable to even loot anything that wants it.
---
-----
---
I appreciate that people play games differently, [as I said before the game even launched](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/241859/pvp-vs-rp-and-the-rise-of-the-social-justice-gamer/222?language%5B%5D=en):
---
&gt; I play games to level up as high as I can, gather up more loot then I'll ever be able to use and then sit on it like a dragon, doing nothing with my growing pile of loot.. That's what I enjoy doing in games. If Fo76 was more focused on something I didn't enjoy, especially if it was focused on something that directly went against what I wanted to do (gather up more loot then I can ever use) then why would I want to play it?
---
FO76 allowed me to play the way I play games, it now doesn't. I'm not telling people how they should play, I'm pointing out that the game that was sold at launch allowed me to play my way and it now doesn't (I made my primary storage mule before even making my main character).
---
But since you seem to think you should be able to dictate how people enjoy themselves, please tell me what reason there is to even log in? As in, what is there to gain from say an 18 hour grind?
---
Ok I understand now
---
I'm pretty sure their priorities are in the right place, so far as what they're spending time communicating to us right now.  I can almost guarantee you they'll have more juicy stuff to talk about as soon as the fires die down.
---
Bloodied. Instigating. Furious would probably be better on my automatic pea shooter.
---
ThTs why bloodied weapons still do over 2000 damage. Because that‚Äôs not op 
---
"constant damage at any range"  --  Lasers have beam spread, so some damage loss at extreme range should be expected, but it could be one of the highest range with the lowest damage loss over range out there.   Your point is good, I'm just asking for a variation that takes into account that lasers aren't perfect either.
---
Burning damage is good.
---
Maxing out Strength is a place to start, as each point of STR increases melee damage 5%. Make sure you've got 15 points allocated there. Then there's:
---
* \+1 STR legendary effect armor and melee weapons
---
* BoS and Enclave underarmor (up to +3 STR)
---
* Bobblehead: Strength (+2 STR for 1hr, 2hrs w/*Curator*)
---
* Bobblehead: Melee (+20% melee damage)
---
* magazines (can confer various benefits including melee weapon damage, durability, and weight buffs)
---
* Fury (+30% melee damage, +25 DR, -5 PER)
---
* other chems like Bufftats (+2 STR) and X-Cell (+2 to all SPECIAL)
---
* Mutant Hound Stew (+15% melee damage)
---
* other food: +1-3 STR (deathclaw steak, deathclaw wellington, mole rat chunks, stingwing fillet)
---
* drinks: up to +6 STR w/*Party Boy* (fern flower teas, but especially whiskey and other alcoholic beverages)
---
* *\[Expert/Master\] Slugger* and Motion-assist servos in PA like you mentioned
---
Many of the above do not stack, particularly with items in the same category, so read up on that.
---
Also consider that you get +5 health per END rank, and +10 max AP and +5 sneak per AGI rank. You may additionally want *Barbarian*, *Martial Artist*, *Blocker*, *Incisor*, *Adamantium Skeleton*, *Ironclad*, *Action Boy/Girl*, *Moving Target*, *Marathoner*, *Evasive*, *Adrenaline*, *Suppressor*, *Makeshift Warrior*, *Junk Shield*, and *Starched Genes* \+ *Class Freak*.
---
Then there's mutations. Too many to list and you may well want most of them (make sure you understand what each does as there will be exceptions); especially Scaly Skin, Speed Demon, Twisted Muscles, and Marsupial.
---
Most players getting ridiculous 5-digit damage numbers are using some if not most of the above items/perks/mutations with a Bloodied build and at least 2-star legendary weapons, and are including sneak attack multipliers (sometimes with Ninja) in their damage calculations. They may also be getting revival buffs but I'm not knowledgeable on that as I'm mainly a solo player.
---
I've probably missed a bunch of other buffs too, as I'm not a melee player.
---
Thanks for the advice! I see you have some experience!
---
God I thought it was just me. I was getting slaughtered by Gutsy's yesterday. Was out of stims and probably got killed 5 or 6 times trying to do Powering Monongah before I just gave up.

Last week, a fair amount of people were asking to ban the people who were duping or exploiting. Now they are banning everyone who makes items. I blame this subreddit for the witch hunting by Bethesda. They were only listening to our complaints.

Unfortunately all of this did not justify the 250+ hours I put into the game to do it. I realized very quickly how hollow the endgame is and tried my best to make my own fun, but that got old fast, and this last patch just murdered the game for me. 
---
How is plan pricing based on rarity? If the BoS vendor has all t45, t51, and t60 plans for sale, how are they rare and therefore more expensive? That's....not how the economy works. 
---
GRRRR &gt;:(
---
We had fun playing but got tired of the bugs and once you complete the quests there was not much else to do
---
I'd def give them that a lot of shit in this game is broken, but  4 months is too long for a company with that many resources on this much of a fuckup. I could say stability has come a long way if i hadnt disconnected 3 times the last time we tried to boot it up. I'm on the boat that it probably wont ever be perfectly stable and that the bugs and dupers have already crushed it. Tag onto the fact that bethesda things punishing players who didn't server hop for caps by charging an insane amount of money for the item just because its there now, is not how it should work. 
---
tl;dr -  nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf. does not a fun game make.    
---
Wow. Either this is the funniest thread I ever read or you all need your own support group.

No.

Even if you preordered they wouldn't fully refund
---
What about the people outraged that Heavy and Energy weapons are still under-performing in both damage and durability, despite this being acknowledged since release? 
---
Or the people outraged that weapons like the Missile Launcher and Fat man are extremely weak for their weight consumption and their relevant perk was further nerfed? 
---
Or the people who already hated the chore of gathering ballistic weave and constantly repairing their armor while the White Knight perk gets nerfed? 
---
What about the people who were frustrated with the mismanagement of the game since BETA finding the unfixing of bugs in the latest patch to be the final straw?
---
There's much more outrage about the current state of the game and perceived direction it's heading than just cheaters and TSE users.

This is the exact same thing that happened with ESO.  I waited a year or so before diving in so the bugs could be shaken out.  I have faith things will be going fine in ten months or so.  It seems to be the MO for most online games.  The biggest problem I have with 76 is the lack of a viable player run economic system.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs coming.  The may have a plan to reduce farming and duping.  Though I myself play these games for different reasons it seems than many others.  Online or not, I enjoy the world.  76 is unlike any other online game.  No handholding, no NPCs. I see it as a blank slate.  And I‚Äôm excited to see how far it goes.  I‚Äôm not defending Bethesda but why not see where this goes?  Go and play another game and come back in a few months.  I do want to point out that I‚Äôve had the best RP experiences on 76 than any other online game in the past decade.  For my own selfish purposes I hope you fun RP geeks stick around with me.  
---
As for those who claim you‚Äôve been duped into buying the game?  Bethesda has stolen money from you?  Go exchange your game at GameStop and move on.  You could have waited and, being a savvy consumer, consulted online reviews.  Caveat emptor.
---
I enjoy this social experiment.  It‚Äôs been...interesting.
---
Yes, melee needs a nerf as well.
---
All builds should be viable against each other and there should be no clear superior build.
---
Might as well put a difficulty slider in the menu too
---
Well.. we dont "know" anything yet until someone in the know can tell us what the changes actually are.    
---
I merely said that in the brief time I tested the patch it "felt" like I was taking a bit more dmg, and that was before this change was brought to light. Could be nothing. 
---
Thier sholdn't be such a small stash limit. At the very least it should be 2000. seriously 600? my characters in 3,NV,4, skyrim all had higher carry limits than that. enough of the bullshit. increase the limit on both characters, and stashes, to 300/2000 respectively at base.
---
Also introduce a way to further increase stash limit, by either perks, or a camp Item.
---
I really dislike whatever that was I just watched, i thought i was scrolling then I wasn't then it was just too slow.

Hey, i get what you say here, same goes for me. And i never had a tse gun and i am not even melee user. :)

---
I think you misread the post.  We were all meant to have a full set of Ultracite power armor by the time we fight the sbq which is why the game gave you a full set.  The issue was people scrapping it on accident and then having to fight the sbq to get it again.  This is why power armor frames need to be named and let you see what is equipped on them when in your inventory.
---
Not much positivity, role playing, or videos ever uploaded you're welcome! :)
---
This game is not working for their market share, even if they are working for MMO shares.  The game types are totally different.  If anything they're competing with their own fantasy version, ESO.

I like this game, I don't have any serious problem, and none of the nerfs/buffs are ruining my experience (yet anyway).

But damn all the armchair developers here!

I was there for a little bit!  Nothing like making a little progress on her and then getting booted.  Did you guys finish her off?

As long as the game is fun, I will continue to provide Bethesda financial support.  
---
What is this..?
---
Tons of people have played FO76 for over 400 hours. That's worth a lot more than 60-70 bucks. The game isn't as bad as everyone is saying it is, you and this entire community are over reacting, y'all need to take a step back and relax.
---
Honestly, I think at this point it's just beating a dead horse to be making anti-Beth videos. If you consider "bad" patches to be "big" Beth news, you really must not  have much else to report.  
---
At this point, this is the game. You know it, I know it. No sweeping change is coming, just fixes and small bits of content.  
---
If you like it, stay. If not? Stop playing and try to get your refund (If you're still aching over 60 dollars three months on). I'm not defending the game or Bethsoft; but the constant bitching about a game that isn't going to change is futile. Everyone knows of Bethsoft's dirty deeds; the damage is done. With any luck, going forward, the games will improve. Your quest is over, Paladins. The beast is dead.  
---
As a side note, there are no sure bets in gaming anymore. Stop preordering unless you really want all that plastic taff collectors' editions come with.
---
You have never played it, yet you want to get on a soap box and preach.  Alright, what is your youtube channel?

I give sitting at picnic tables a good 3 second think before committing.  What purpose is there to the over-elaborate sitting animations really?  Its like my character has to decide if its worth breaking a hip over.

---
Did you have rad worms when you recorded this? Noticed you have a disease icon at the bottom right. Rad worms is bugged in this patch and multiplies every effect on your character positive or negative by 50%, so who knows what havoc is caused behind the scenes.
---
 Armor weight negatively effects stealth, as does illumination and gunfire, and closeness / alertness of enemies, these effects could be getting multiplied in ways that the code does not expect. 
---
 I had stealth problems until i cured rad worms, unequipped all my sneak cards and restarted the game, then it seems ... ok... i can run around and clear harper's ferry with sneak melee again. see -&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al6mf1/psa\_rad\_worms\_now\_increases\_all\_player\_effects\_by/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/al6mf1/psa_rad_worms_now_increases_all_player_effects_by/)

I still see ZERO stuff about new content that we might want to see in February (Player Vending, New Events, etc).  If they do a February full of bug fixes, nerfs, and small QOL adjustments...............I won't have any friends left playing by March.

I actually think the White Knight nerf was necessary.  I play about half in non PA armor and half in PA armor and the WK made some players invincible and they never had to repair anything.

This is huge for me as well. I'm not interested in playing Skyrim 2100.
---
Thanks for taking a look! She says she uses some thrifty ingredients but is otherwise faithful to the recipes. Apparently cheese cake is quite fancy!
---
To the best of my knowledge they did not nerf bobble head stacking.
---
Havent looked into them. Ill take a look or two!
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt have fixed levels for each area. It works for many other games.
---
A level 10 wolf kept regenerating it‚Äôs health against me (lvl 65)
---
But there isnt anything to discuss?
---
Some of us actually don‚Äôt want all of our hard work wasted
---
Incisor is a good one once you can get it
---
Who's laughing now huh?
---
Because they want to make even more stealth nerfs, and they are hoping people don't realize and call them out on it. 
---
I don't defend Bethesda I just don't think it's that bad. The worst thing about the game to me is the lack of end game content or any new dlcs
---
Using 21:9 and it definitely changed this patch. Was so used to the stretched icons and text that it feels wrong now, but it functions at that aspect ratio at least.
---
I think all they need to do is add the 10mm pistol to the legendary list (I've yet to see a single one across 200+ levels) and fix energy weapons so we can use Lazer and plasma pistols more reliably.
---
We need a player dmg cap so pvp fights last at least 4 shots with the strongest weapons. Just un nerf everything. 
---
Wow. Just wow. 
---
*Sigh*
---
Mobile ‚Äúscreen capture‚Äù. It‚Äôs very interesting, especially with social media: eg, when posters change the posts later, there is an earlier copy in video form. Peace.
---
add 2 more to the tally. 
---
Its a deal
---
Wow im glad you took the time to amuse me. 
---
What's wrong with this game? Bethesda fixes one thing but breaks another. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to get used to the bug with shadows we have what? A brand new 21:9 crosshair bug! Now the crosshair size is just a little bigger than my screen. It as wide as my ass after I (lvl 25) first met scorchbeast (lvl50). But... maybe the game is preparing me for something. Teaching me to bravely overcome all the bugs and glithches. And when the radioactive ash falls I'll stand up, shake off and say "I've seen it all."
---
I'm at level 111, and I have gotten 6 TSE drops, 3 of them were mostly useless, at least for my character, and I have also got several other TS or explosive weapon drops.
---
My first was a TSE Gauss Rifle that simply didn't work most of the time, it wouldn't do any damage to enemies within about 15-20 yards, just passed straight thru them, and it was to slow to use effectively on SBs that never landed at the time, so I sold it for 600 caps.
---
I've also been rewarded with a TSE single action revolver that was useless, but I was able to sell it to someone that really wanted one for 1000 caps.
---
I got a TSE The Dragon, but the game glitched and took it back the next day.
---
I also currently still have 2 TSE Handmades, level 35 &amp; level 45, and a TSE Gatlin, (level 20)
---
Farming legendary enemies regularly does eventually pay off, but the epic level drops are in the 0.25% range.
---
So... While I do agree that many out there got them from Dupers, and most knew they were trading for a duped weapon, that isn't true for all of us.
---
I run a Stealth/Sniper build, and sneak around killing Legendary enemies while avoiding the others a lot, as I don't see a need to level up quicker, and every shot has a chance of giving away my position.
---
There is. Literally what OP is saying not to do, is to discuss appreciating the game despite its flaws because the majority don‚Äôt like it.
---
Isn‚Äôt Reddit designed to support discourse? Isn‚Äôt that what upvotes and downvotes are for?
---
"Posts that didn't aged well"
---
Every patch has sucked so far. They literally put less effort in the patches than they did to make the game. The game has been out for months and the only real improvement they‚Äôve made is the removal of dupe glitches even tho they‚Äôre still there. Every patch they just nerf a bunch of shit and make the game more grindy and never buff anything to balance out play styles for people who don‚Äôt use melee weapons. The real problem is people like you still defending them when they legit don‚Äôt care. They give us the most minimal responses and insincere apologies and somehow you guys still fall for it
---
If you feel bad for convincing them, then why dont you refund them for their games. 
---
&gt;Today I got a message that my account was suspended indefinitely, and it asks me to explain the "excessively high rate of item creation."
---
That's because they can't detect duping *at all* - they're just scanning inventories and banning people with the wrong items or with too many of the same.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
just like when I get out of my excavator and then get back in and find myself overencumbered...
---
Woo hoo.  Got the Electric Chair plan today
---
I wonder if there is a possibility that vocal minority is at all associated with Bethesda, seeing the way they have dealt with criticism thus far
---
I love how they think people are gonna play this game for 310 days straight
---
Mind if I call you bro? &lt;3 :)
---
You're right. I only saw a couple tickets and subject lines.  Once I figured out what was going on I felt intrusive and shut it all down. So, I don't know if some included full CC numbers.   
---
I completely agree and would in fact preferred a nerf to TSE weapon strictly in pvp combat, or at least less of such a massive nerf. 
---
My guess is that people read all the bitchy posts and decided to buy Red Dead.
---
How's that regret going?
---
Oh I completely understand, and my point was less of saying specific nerfs were warranted/unwarranted and more about people who dismiss people's opinions based on bullshit like "everyone who's complaining is a TES baby who can't 1 shot things"
---
Lol anytime!
---
I have a vampire explosive +10% dmg when aiming 10mm pistol, but the guerrilla perk doesn't affect it :/
---
‚ÄúTons of people‚Äù bought the game but I imagine the people that made it to 400 hours make up a small percentage of those that originally purchased it. I played F76, got to level 86 and got to the end game material. I have played worst games but I would not consider F76 a great game by any means. Outside of all the bugs and bad patches they simply did not sell us what they hyped up. I laugh every time I hear ‚Äú16 times the detail‚Äù now lol.
---
Hi, thanks for replying.    
---
Well, im on PC and games runs fine most of time with mid settings (i5-6400, 16gb ram, GTX 1050)    
---
I'm level 168    
---
Perks in Agility tree are most related to stealth builds (mr. sandman (2), sneak (3), adrenaline (4), scape artist, and evasive (2)    
---
Armor are 4 pieces with unyielding (one of them gives +1 AGI), one with chameleon and the "you're difficult to detteckt while sneaking" hability    
---
It happens everywre (Cranberry Bog, Morgantown, Top of the World, Wendigo's Cave, etc
---
Thanks for help
---
The amount of content in the game gets used up pretty quickly. Replaying it only offers so many different experiences. However, interacting with other players gives unlimited new experiences. I started with a couple random friends I added just so I could fast travel for cheap. That swelled to a group of 20 people we work with, often running 6-10 person teams over discord to coordinate scorchbeast queen fights, create a tight-nit trading community, and skill sharing. Since we've seen everyone else's builds, we're starting to help each other create new characters and level up, filling in gaps in our current team's load out.
---
I really wanted to play this game solo. There's limited solo content. There's unlimited interaction
---
Well Bethesda is about to bring servers down to fix it.
---
I only get it when entering the main building, and there's rarely much players inside, if any. Though loading all those NPCs might cause it.
---
Red Dead still might be there,  but my $60 wil never come back. üò¢
---
HAHAHA!
---
Cool original story like all the others saying the same thing. 
---
The original game was live for 2 years so it just went like any other mmo shutdown.  They did reduce the subscription cost for the final few months and legacy players got a bunch of free stuff when ARR was released.
---
There are so many threads saying what doesnt work, you're just an idiot.
---
So it's just a paint job with weird red eyes. Okay then.
---
*points to Temple* A market can't exist if all the player vendors quit the game
---
This is dumb. Saying you hate the bugs and the bad experiences they can provide is not the same thing as saying you hate the game.
---
You are exactly the type of person OP is talking about.
---
Exactly. I love how excited I get when finding something to be healed with. Lurking around and scoping everything out before taking any action feels very real especially with how much control it gives you. I have been in some awesome and hopeless firefights that have given me some damn cool experiences. 
---
I agree. Boy did Bethesda fuck up this release. It already had a rocky landing pad for when it finally came out, but that doesn't excuse all the anti-consumer shit they been doing lately. As a company, Bethesda is starting to follow in EAs footsteps. Not with microtransactions, but rather with treating their community like idiots, who can't tell the difference between two types of materials
---
Why is it better than screenshots or copying text to reddit?
---
Bethesda is "fixing" the problem today.
---
You're so welcome and thanks for the downvote! It shows how much you care!
---
When you see the event going on at the Lighthouse right to the east of Vault 76, don the appropriate apparel and prepare to receive his Blessing.
---
Just make sure there's plenty of time when you get there and there's a couple of other people to help out. LOL
---
I agree OP. They won't get a dime out of me. In fact they got nothing, I got a refund, thank goodness in the nick of time. I still enjoy the game, but won't be investing anything in it until it is fixed which doesn't look like it is going to happen anytime soon and will be too late, who knows. I really wish I had something else I could play and enjoy as much as Fallout. The latest patch is pretty much sealed it's fate, they focusing on nerfing everything into oblivion, making things harder to buy with little caps we have, damn difficult for me to make decent caps without a massive grind. Stimpacks 834 caps, seriously ? I get gun plans are expensive or PA plans, but Stimpacks ? idk man ..
---
There is an absolute carry weight cap now. 6k nukas would put you over that. Just take out a few at a time and dump them.
---
Most of them are not even fixes. 
---
They are only fixing bobbypins, bulk junk and the new known glitch for plans. 
---
3 fixes.... 
---
Two of which were introduced in the last patch. 
---
Nothing for the pipboy glitch, loading glitch, dupe glitch, perk issues, or even a respec option! 
---
I'll see if I can find/apply those headlamps for the other armors after the hotfix, will DM you with what I find.
---
They even [stated](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alo0gk/bethesda_if_you_make_the_red_tactical_headlight/efg9j18/?context=1000) that this is just an **unintended** side effect of the upcoming Mothman armor. Maybe it's time to edit your post to prevent more baseless fearmongering, yeah?
---
We gonna have to let Bethesda know about your position on the Council of Redditors, so next time they speak to what you specifically want to see. Either that or you just dropped the Royal We,  inwhich case, nicely done. 
---
A retro accent for a retro game makes perfect sense, duhh!
---
I usually partnered selling with buying stuff I wanted, mostly plans and mods, which is impacted by server hopping. I guess the new patch fixes this, but I haven't played in a couple weeks.
---
It‚Äôs extremely frustrating that without much trial and error or testing yourselves, that you guys are jumping to conclusions and wasting the time of a community manager. 
---
They *were* rare, They didn't want to destroy the economy built around those items. Like jetpacks etc.
---
Ok, I'm a pretty hardcore fallout fan. Bethesda in general. Even I can admit that theyve had a lot of time to steer this ship in the right direction and it's no better really than when it launched. New bugs are introduced every patch, new duping methods, and nothing new in the way of content. I really think Bethesda is in need of some tough love here. I have thousands of hours in Fallout and Elder Scrolls games but even I need to step back at some point and admit this is a mess and has been for quite some time now.
---
There you go I upvoted both you or post
---
I literally posted this last week and got downvoted to reddit hell. 
---
I tried that, I won‚Äôt let me take any of the nuka colas. I can take out anything else, but I can‚Äôt even touch ONE nuka cola
---
Wasn't their website and Bethesda launcher also selling it for half price though? 
---
Yeah, I'm still waiting for that long promised "much larger" stash increase.
---
I've taken to offloading things on my alts now.  It's a slow, painful process, and you need a friend if you want to do it safely :(
---
Totally agree! Cant worry about the past, try and make it right now going forward. 
---
So what is the reason then? Flux and a one in a thousand chance to get a serum recipe?
---
Yeah I found a ammo box with 2000 nuke cola's in it, I could transfer even 1 out. I guess they make sure you can't take a lot of items out ..
---
Unfortunately I think you might have to delete you character or log a ticket but they would likely flag you .. or just start a new alt and leave your 90  character and hope it recovers one day or they change something ..
---
Same thing happened to me I dropped the extra pieces and chassis
---
I fight her to keep my Vent stocks high
---
Vendors.  But for some reason it's named and priced the same as the unpainted metal one, so it's a gamble.  Thankfully they have the (known) label now so that should hopefully make it easier for you.
---
I fight her for prime plans, so I can fight her better
---
That's not that actual price , there testing to see what they can get away with. So being vocal about that being an unacceptable price to charge is fine. Hence why I'll wait. 
---
Explosive and Riflemen perks as well as agility perks that added bonus damage. My intent was to get around 5000 base damage like ive seen people do prior
---
Also very valid but im certain nerfing everything across the board would be even less accepted of a change considering the current track record.
---
Ammo and repair materials dump. 
---
i came to see if this place was a circlejerk like people say it is, im very pleased to see that this was the VERY FIRST post i see, thank you.
---
RIP me then
---
Prime plans are the only really unique thing from her
---
No, it's not a Joke, and it's not funny at all, since the Patch my most powerful weapon is an Instigating Death Tambo, which far surpasses my TSE Handmade, Explosive Hunting Rifle, and Explosive Combat SG, so trust me when I say I'm not laughing about the weapons I worked so hard to acquire becoming useless.
---
Crits themselves used to contribute to the crit meter. Now they don't on all weapons. That change alone has gimped many 4LC builds.
---
My build is standing there taking damage and letting the enemies die of exhaustion.  I need a buff to compete with the other builds.  The way it is now, having a weapon feels mandatory.
---
*sarcasticly* They don't know what they are doing. They keep making it worse. They don't care about us.
---
Seriously though they should have done it right the first time, but at least they are willing to fix things now.
---
Legendary effects for pvp should be scaled independently from pvm, simple as that.
---
Bobby pin fix, bulk scrap, and known plan issue will be fixed in hotfix
---
I heard a theory a while ago that was plausible (although from a youtuber). The idea was basically that Bethesda wanted more staff for fo76, but couldn't get it approved from above. So they purchase this other game studio in Austin, and spin it as a growth move, and management naturally thinks it's great and signs off. Next they give all the fo76 work to the new staff, which was pretty much the plan all along, while they continue to work on ES 6 and Starlord or whatever
---
That is your biggest source of frustration, and frankly it's nothing to be super angry about. Is it annoying? Yes, but not enough to be causing so much outrage (not saying you specifically). It will be fixed soon, it's not game breaking so let's just wait a bit.
---
I think they mean drop rates.  So if some item drops more frequently, it'll be cheaper as a plan (like a hunter rifle plan).  If it rarely ever drops, then it'll be more expensive (like a serum plan). 
---
THANK YOU
---
Both at the same time?
---
There may be an "automatic prime receiver" though. I have both my combat rifle.
---
True. I prefered rifles because it wouldnt require me to get in close range with my enemues, allowing me to pick them off from a distance with my stealth perks in play too
---
Another idea is, is there a recipe that uses nuka cola's? maybe you can find receipt with nuka as the ingredient and make a lot of those or something ..
---
needs more PA stations, im not waiting in line behind an Initiate
---
thats a fairly good point.
---
No no the issue is when morons like yourself go and proclaim on a forum that something isn‚Äôt working the way it used to it inspires droves of fellow morons to back up that unfounded claim and thus community managers time and worst of all dev time is wasted to looking for your non existent bug.
---
So in the feature mr.garbage build user, maybe test things for more than a hour(at least a few days) before jumping to conclusions and instigating the possible waste of critical time for several people.
---
Bro, don't be so triggered. It's just reddit.
---
;)
---
Hmmmmm
---
I don't disagree with anything you said here.  I don't think Bethesda has done everything right but I think the new calculations are more in line with what they intended and don't ruin the whole game.  Legitimate players are being put out a little by it, for sure.  My feeling on that is:  I'm willing to take the hit and move it all over for the good of the game.  I think it's a step in the right direction.
---
I'm nearly lvl 170 with 10 points unused.  This change has hurt both my TS and E weapons, I'm not denying it.  I'm just saying that it's worth it to reign in the madness that was TSE + Bobblehead dupers.  When this all blows over: the game will be better for the changes, I think.
---
Honestly, I think they over-nerfed them intentionally to make the duped ones useless.  Instead of pursuing all of the guns, they just change the way they work, no punishment to the players that cheated besides being put out the time and effort.  The rest of us are just put out but we no longer have a duped gun to our heads.
---
This was great input, btw.  Thanks for it
---
Im more or less in the same boat as you, with exception to the white knight perks effect on my build. I found myself crafting new armor instead of repairing, because i didn't have enough ballistic fiber. Maybe that means i suck at not getting hit. But since i got WK perk, that went from daily to couple days. As for bobby pins, i threw out 300. Keep 10 with ne, no more lol
---
Except no, the civil people have made more progress with their request. Look at the people who requested stash size increases, or for plans to be listed as known or not. Those changes have been made, the people crying that their duped eBay weapons that take a scorched queen down in one shot are being mocked, trust me on that.
---
Such a weird argument. Oh no, I'm not a true fan?! What the fuck does that even mean, really? You could argue that someone enjoys something in a different way to you, so then what defines being a true fan? Seems to be that it just amounts to "But I was here first."
---
I feel that I regret buying fallout at full price. It was a slap in the face when It went half off right after launch.
---
"do not try to censor discussions" yet if anyone on here says the bugs suck but they still enjoy the game or they feel people are overreacting to certain aspects they are downvoted and bitched at and called shills. So is it just people need to say bethseda is evil and only bitch about the game and then it's okay? 
---
ESO is alright, but that isn't Bethesda; which is why. 
---
Can you quote me chapter and verse in the ToS/EULA/rules/whatever that using another character as a bank isn't allowed?
---
&gt;Demolition Expert was reduced to match related damage perks. The damage bonus it previously provided was very high and was causing balance problems
---
have they played the game? last time I checked, a black powdered rifle does more than a fat man
---
&gt; We make these decisions to encourage more balanced pick rates across all perk cards, and even out perks that can start to feel mandatory when they‚Äôre overperforming compared to other cards.
---
The reason why they were mandatory was because explosives weapons do jack shit damage to begin with and their ammo weighs a ton.
---
&gt; That said, many of you will also remember, that there was a time, when it was not possible to release a buggy, unfinished game. (Hashtag E.T. for Atari 2600.) Internet made it possible to do so.
---
Oh, there were *plenty* of buggy, unfinished games released before the internet was a thing. The difference was that back then, you couldn't get a patch for that unfinished and buggy game, unless you picked up your landline phone, dialed a number and asked for the company to send you, in the physical mail, the required patch files, on a disk. That's assuming the company even cared enough to patch their game in the first place. And obviously this was not a thing on the earlier consoles.
---
Yes, the internet has brought with it Early Access and other such things, but at least nowadays we *can* actually get our games patched, unlike 30+ years ago.
---
Not a programmer, but it's only been 26 hours. I'm sure it's a 1 thing at a time process. 
---
I just stopped playing and supporting. I'll play new vegas any day of the week, but I'd never actively support any new projects until the company proves themself again.
---
fortnite especially doesnt shit on the fans, it overcharges for its skins by like 10$ per skin sure but they do listen to the community.
---
That's the line they used for your stash 4 months ago. 
---
Games only been out 2 months.
---
Even if you count the Xbox beta - that's been 3.
---
Why not fix the fusion core nerf too then? 
---
It is a single coding change from 0.8 to 3. 
---
Are you willing to gamble that Bethesda WOULDN'T do something as dumb as accidentally flagging people as dupers when they're crafting things legit? That's a risky bet. I trust Bethesda a lot less then I trust any redditors after all the bait and switches they've pulled.
---
in before deleted....
---
now the LMG will do 18 damage instead of 16 and will take 5 mags until breaking instead of 4! cant wait for that HUGE buff
---
So, I preface this by saying I totally don't expect it to happen.
---
But for me, legendary weapons should only be in a hardcore PvP mode if there is loot drop enabled.
---
You want to use that 3* Bloodied Handmade?
---
You best be careful boy.
---
This guy gets it. 
---
i wonder what r/gamingcirclejerk would have to say about this...
---
That's more of a universal request that I would like seen done in general. I am mostly commenting on the fact that PvE isn't even a threat ever when I am rocking sentinel armor and/or and anti armor rifle. Just from a personal perspective of a survival mode I would like moments where I look at the crowd of super mutants in the distance and have to ask "is the loot in there worth the risk?" 
---
2k damage was fun because i could 2 or 3 hit the lvl 50 scorchbeast that kept harassing my camp in the cranberry bog
---
I am with you on Anthem, brother.
---
Oh yeah, in Watoga died a half dozen times at the hands of a few lvl 52 Colonel Gutsys yesterday. Shit was outragous. Even funnier my friend has a camp out by the Bog and three level 52 Colonel Gutsys took out a level 65 Scorch beast. It was insane.
---
But fallout 76 is terrible I have over 100 hours and it's only gotten fucking worse since the beta. 
---
So what, you're just missing your shots?
---
Hahaha I was going to put in more. Before I started this my old camp was duplicated 5 times and I had to scrap so much stuff I had to do a junk run for screws just to build crafting stations
---
Yup, just that simple. /s 
---
You‚Äôre just as bad as the gta online people when someone gets banned for getting money dropped on them, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs bullshit, you knew exactly what you were asking for, you deserve a vac ban‚Äù 
---
Here, find the nuke cola grenade recipe ... if you can find that, I bet you are golden 
---
[https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:\_Nuka-Cola\_Grenade](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Nuka-Cola_Grenade)
---
It must make the Fallout 1&amp;2 fans roll their eyes into the stratosphere to hear these fans say that
---
Ah gotcha I didn‚Äôt realize it had been out for so long in it‚Äôs original design. Thanks good insight!
---
Because then you would have the *several hours* that the servers will be down (because its a 'hotfix', natch) to pore through them and find everything they fucked up and go online to bitch about it.
---
So, put the patch notes afterwards and half of you will be tweaking the nose of the server gods instead.
---
The fact that Fo5 is being developed by BGS, unlike Fo76 which was the newly acquired failing Battle Cry studios means that it will be as good as atleast Fo4, which was admittedly worse than 3.
---
Can you get anything in there?
---
Not only that, it makes sense for a player to actually advertise crafting as a profession. If plans are 1k for everybody they would just go buy the plan. If they're 8k maybe you go find somebody
---
Jesus Christ, I used rifleman as an example.  The SAME damage bonus progression applies to ALL weapon type perks.  Rifleman, Commando, Gladiator, Guerilla, Gunslinger, Heavy Gunner, Shotgunner, Slugger, and Iron Fist ALL cap out at a 60% bonus for 9 points.  Demolition Expert was the ONLY one that provided a 100% bonus for only a 5 point investment.
---
Explosive weapons are NOT supposed to be DPS monsters against single targets, the entire fucking point is that they create EXPLOSIONS and unlike essentially EVERY other weapon type that doesn't have an Explosive legendary modifier are able to damage masses of enemies at once.
---
Oh my tender feelings, you almost hurt them. 
---
Is the Fusion Core bug only on consoles? I took over Monogah power plant earlier and it still produced 1 core every 7.5 minutes to be, just like before the patch.
---
That was 11 months ago.
---
There has been a patch since then that expanded armor sets, if my memory serves. I easily have at least one elemental set  for each Bow, and that's not even counting elemental sets that cater to the strengths of one monster over another. For example, if I'm fighting an Arch Tempered Vaal Hazak, you better has Miasma decorations equipped with a fire element. Otherwise, you wouldn't need Miasma for other monsters.
---
You're taking one person's complaint where you're both totally wrong. There's always going to be a Meta or "optimal" build, but not everyone (Myself included) is perfect, nor could play "optimal". My best example for a wide range of sets lie with bow, because with my 300+ hours of game time, I find some monsters I could use 1 point in constitution, others I'm more comfortable with 3. Add all those variables with elements and I easily have 3 pages worth of Bow load outs.
---
Thats a general problem with the game. TSE was one shotting everything, while other weapons made enemies feel like a bullet sponge. That's why ppl duped it. The nerf to TSE was justified. I would strongly recommend you get that tank killer (armor pen) perks to help you. Btw im in the same boat as you so i feel you, sans TSE weapon. I never got one, and feel was for the better, if i consider the game experience i wanted from this game
---
Yup it's pretty clear of this patch they a bunch of hard core knuckleheads that are clueless ..
---
Yes don't buy the product. Then it's on the company. I came to Fallout 76 subreddit to get away from the negativity from The Fallout subreddit.
---
Seems like anybody that actually is played bethesda's Fallouts know what to expect.
---
I have no problem with people trying to make the game better and working with Developers. But the majority is the same old song and dance.
---
I'm having a great time with the game. I'm not that bothered that my explosives build is less effective. It just takes longer to beat the game then. I'm enjoying my way through at level 53.
---
If I get bored of it I'll go play a different game or different character.
---
That would be a really interesting mechanic however I dont think the survival servers can survive off PvP hype alone. Every PvE experience really should be fight or flight just as much 
---
It is though. They admitted that in a previous patch someone fatfingered the spawn rate making it 0.8 an hour. 
---
A single coding change would fix it. 
---
I made a post here about how to balance bug fixes, nerfs, QOL, and most importantly new CONTENT!

Look at the bottom of the post for the change I proposed to AWOL Armaments :)  They could have that change in the game in about 1 WEEK!
---
like 4 or 5 times over 3 months i got an Ultracite mod that wasnt a Vent, I think its a bug.
---
Since your not smart enough to do the math then my gun went from 1500 to 400 damage 
---
Damn it Karen
---
You found the patch notes? Link?
---
I had a mod for t51 and it magically vanished from my stash box. It was going to get installed on Nuka Armor. Oh well.
---
There were headlamp mod plans, I've seen them.
---
I already have a red tactical headlamp on my x-01, can't wait to get home and see if I can use it or not.
---
Very epic fellow Redditor. I fucking hate your entire existince stop fucking speaking to me in this manner I will shit down your fucking throat like Andy sixx
---
I had the tse pump up in the 900s with all shotgun cards in strength, all in on demo expert and enforcer. 1 star bloody mess. Fortunately for me, Respec to melee won't be hard because I have 15 in strength as that is where all the shotgun cards are.
---
As it sits now and for some unknown reason the shotgun seems to bounce from 313 to 343 and as high as 403 in damage. I'm not sure what is making it fluctuate. It seems slightly different on server change.
---
Very true. There is an automatic prime and a single prime receiver for the handmade, there could be the same options for the railway rifle. Just have to grind for it.
---
Not as awful as your spelling.
---
Waaah!!
---
Same for me (Xbox).
---
Sometimes I'm appear, new loading screen, black screen and the same place... but with weather, light...
---
Loading are very strange since the patch 4...
---
Thanks i will have to try that on pc but do you know of anyway for xbox? I know there are a few programs for things like horizon for stuff like that
---
You're confusing a hotfix ("Oh god! The powder magazine just blew and the ship is sinking! Everyone, get patching or we die!") with a patch or update ("Bulkhead six is stuck open, and we've got a slow leak in the cargo hold; we should fix that next time we're in drydock")
---
A hotfix is made to fix immediate, game-killing issues. You know, like accidentally rolling back previous fixes. These are future patch issues, I'm afraid. 
---
&gt; Not a programmer, but it's only been 26 hours.
---
Yeah...no. It's not 'only been 26 hours'. Multiply that by the number of developers to get the actual man hours it took. If you conservatively guess that there are 10 developers that's over 250 hours to get these three things resolved. It would have been easier to just re-release patch 4.
---
Maybe it is, which would be weird. Has anyone checked on consoles? 
---
Since the patch and the acknowledgement of the fusion core nerf, I haven't taken a powet plant in the last day. 
---
Was it a hoax? 
---
Yeah. I was irritated at first. Then I quickly realized this makes much more sense, 
---
Yes, who cares. This was just a response to all the "I am quitting" posts. 
---
Looks like a random drop but good luck on your quest

I have it as well and also no idea where I got it ..

They did a good job balancing pvp with the last patch. 
---
Demolition nerf was the right thing for pvp. 
---
Pvp is their focus with the release of survival mode. 
---
Good job balancing pvp bethesda. Its much better after the last patch. 
---
To fix pve they need to look at npc enemeies resists and healthpools. Balance should always be driven by the pvp side of the game.

I can't imagine how awful it must be to have a personality where you feel you HAVE to endure a recreational activity.
---
Deploying a patch on a Friday afternoon is a pretty brave thing to do. 
---
Fair :)
---
2160 damage per shot was *never* something that should have been achievable with current health/armor values.
---
Period.
---
Good read definitely sounds like what's going on here the below bullet points Bethesda should really look at as to what the FF14 team learned.
---
"Near the end of his GDC presentation, Yoshida pulled up one final slide, entitled: "What we have learned." Its bullet point lessons were the exact opposites of the mindset that went into building the original FF14:
---
1. Never forget the fans. Without them, there would be no 'us'
---
2. Fun comes first. If it isn't fun, you're doing it wrong¬†
---
3. Never back down. Always aim to amaze
---
4. Don't forget your roots. It's what fans crave"

Thanks for posting.

There are a few posts that nail down most of the Power Armor stuff.
---
However if you're looking for light / sturdy / heavy variants of Normal Armor (leather, wood, marine, combat) the wiki has "some" information but it's woefully incomplete.
---
For a Fallout game, the wiki for Fallout 76 is terribly disappointing.
---
Ideally, they should have hired an "intern" for minimum wage and had them fully flesh out 100% of the wiki for 3 months.  Real data taken directly from the game files.  They have the source code, they can figure it out.
---
You are amazing, and I want to be like you when I hit higher levels. Some people want to destroy everything for their fun, but I also want to protect those who can't protect themselves, even if it means great loss for me. People like you make this game worth playing. Thanks for sharing this, you reminded me why I should get back on the horse.
---
BTW the entire point of this post was to point out that they did not even say what they are going to do (remove the plans from her loot pool or not?), not to debate whether it's worth fighting her (it's not).
---
I like this. Can‚Äôt wait to see how the other millennials react.
---
Well your post likely did very little to change that but good try :P.
---
Yes, this should promote crafting and resale of loot plans, but also, because we no longer have to hope and pray for the vendor to have the plans the offset is that they cost a lot more since they are always available.
---
ESO's comeback is the only reason I haven't lost hope in 76 yet
---
So your point is that it's an awesome nerf, not because it had any positive effect on making the game more enjoyable, but because you're upset by a broad assessment of the community and feel we deserve to have less fun?
---
RE2 already loads pretty fast, but on a SSD there's practically no loading time. I love it.
---
&gt; Why does FO76 even need separate PVP servers when the map is so large with so few players?
---
So that the PVPers are concentrated on a set of servers and know that anyone on that server is up for a fight as opposed to the weird way it is now.
---
Blush 
---
I used to manage ops irl
---
Understanding the SLA and roles and responsibilities was key in managing expectations.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect my work crap rolling into my game experience much less social media
---
Thanks for the laffs
---
50% VATS critical would be good on a rifle.
---
25% fire rate would be lethal on an automatic with furious. Pair that with adrenaline and gun Fu and it's probably pretty OP.
---
33% VATS accuracy making 66% shot a guarantee on an instigating rifle would be lethal.
---
I thought the possibility of selling one-time boosts in the ATOM Store was bad, but taking away in-game items and then charging real money for them? Ladies and gentlemen, we've officially hit a new low.
---
That dude got absolutely roasted though...
---
You should probably read up on the concept of addiction when it comes to game and social media mechanics.
---
This game is primarily entertaining because farming for stupid shit is fun and a great way to waste time.
---
Being old or patient has little to do with it.
---
I might be thinking the beta was in October-- but that's was the FIRST complaint about the game. Was the stash. As soon as people touched it, aside from the fact there's not much to do, and its empty-- is that there wasnt enough stash space for items. 
---
that complaints been known about since then. So 3 Months, going on 4, about half way. slightly semantic, but okay. 
---
But there‚Äôs nothing in here lol
---
What bugs came back though? The damage glitch was confirmed to be just server lag, it didn't come back, duping hasn't come back and the bobby pin thing is barely an issue, you don't even need more than 5 bobby pins at a time.
---
Well when they changed it in patch 4 it didn't cause any bugs. So your argument id a moot point. 
---
This bug has already been patched previously without issue. 
---
It came back in oatch 5 because they used old code, whoch is a big NO for developers. 
---
Thank you so much!
---
&lt;3
---
I literally said "feels". At no point did I proclaim anything was definitively "broken". I posted as much to another commentor, and the OP even said he'd look into the changes and get back to me.     
---
It all in your angry little mind.     
---
Fallout fanboys are no different than any other game. Let them live happily in blind ignorance.
---
Worth a ban.
---
Bloodied builds *should* have higher damage than TSE builds, and melee builds *should* have higher damage than ranged builds.
---
You're at ~30% health, and you're up in someone's face.
---
That seems really, really simple to me.
---
THAT SAID, it is currently pretty far out of line, and definitely needs some adjusting.
---
Honestly read the whole post, and that couldn‚Äôt be said any other way brotha.. great post! I have to agree.. this game has brought me new memories with my best friend/brother that I have moved away from and it is going to bring more! 
---
Todd?
---
Oh thanks, makes sense
---
Misery does love company, I suppose. Let's just keep the nerfs rolling for everyone since not enough people supported you and your plight. /s
---
The devs said that was a large part of the reason in the devnote addendum on the patch notes.
---
Aren't the double loading screens fairly new?
---
But you even said yourself that there is much more server lag since the update so no we r not waisting there time as that is also an issue that needs to be resolved
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request. 
---
**If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:**
---
**All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited or however high they can get it (1,000, 10,000, etc).**  It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.  As many items as they could do with good stability.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
The fusion core nerf? 
---
That is an easy hotfix. 
---
So is reverting white knight changes. 
---
Your argument is weak. 
---
The misconception is that 76 is where BGS' problems are starting. 
---
Every game they've ever released has been buggy as fuck. Every fallout game, including NV was buggy as Fuck. NV actually had the only bug that made me drop a Fallout game a week after launch. 
---
It just got to the point where I had to accept that I love BGS games, and that their products are largely buggy fucks upon release, and weigh that against how much I enjoy those titles.
---
Still enjoy em enough to buy at launch, knowing full well I'm looking at tons of future patches.
---
Just play it. 90% of negative posts in here are whiny rants because their god weapons got taken away from them.
---
I still run with crafted weapons, and enjoy the hell out of it.
---
Lol, you're assuming it didn't affect anything. You don't know that. This too shall pass. Just take a deep breath and relax.
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume you haven‚Äôt played the game in a long time then, because enemies haven‚Äôt been bullet sponges for more than a year lol. This is the problem.. you don‚Äôt have an issue with them charging $20 for an outfit in a $60 game? This is the problem, people are getting complacent. If this game was free to play then those prices wouldn‚Äôt matter, but not for a $60 full priced game. Shit even the Division has much more fair prices for cosmetics on top of cosmetics being easily unlockable in game and that‚Äôs a UBISOFT game. Stop being complacent this is why companies take advantage of us.
---
I don't disagree that the system now is dumb, but that would be the entire point of PVP zones.
---
If PVP zones had the benefit of special enemies and rewards people might actually want to play PVP.
---
I legit think he lives in his mom's basement with those hours
---
I'm just busting yer balls man.  But yah, a lot of issues were known right from the get-go.  Its why I refunded before release.
---
I didn't expect it to be this bad though.  I thought it was just 'unfinished' and considered coming back around in a couple months to see what it was like.
---
This was perhaps the lowest effort joke I've ever seen in my life. Congratulations.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm just gonna log off and log back in another month from now. I didn‚Äôt really plan on playing the game today, just wanted to dispose of them in the event that I want to play later on.

---
What about the accidental fusion core nerf? 
---
Why not hotfix that? 
---
Or revert White Knight? 
---
Easy hotfixes. They didn't do. 
---
Every SB can drop those.
---
If they are leaving they should go to a player on the map and drop their armor, weapons and chems in a bag and then log and uninstall.
---
Those TSE weapons aren't nearly as bad now as thought and I would enjoy getting one.
---
You like a bad video game. 
---
But she's the only guaranteed drop for them
---
Answer to that when your product is so broken is free 2 play. Charge for a game, people expect to be able to play it now now now...its not a difficult concept to grasp really is it
---
I dont' think they expected to have to think so much about PVP.  To me, it's just Fallout 4 but online.  I can't imagine how a fighting game fanatic or hardcore PVPer would feel in this game; imagine how sad it would be if you thought it was going to be legitimately competitive and realized you had to cheat just to keep up in that arena?  The first 2.5 months were bad for every legitimate player, PVP and PVP.  I'm interested to see how it looks balanced.
---
Haha I'm glad I'm not the only one looking for this god forsaken key, my lady looted it someplace... no idea where and my perception is only 1 so I need this key. The wiki lists it as notable loot at Camp Venture, but I've torn the place apart as well as Fort Defiance, no luck. I'm starting to think it could be on CO Wilson's body where ever that maybe as he was Quater master at Venture and leader of BOS after Taggerty was KIA...keep me posted if you make any head way. 
---
What's stopping you from making multiple characters on the mule account? One could be Resource Mule, Weappn Mule, ect. 6k pounds plus their stash limits as well as each of your personals is overkill already for the average player.
---
Also why not just make mule characters on your main account if there's two of you swapping stuff would just be a matter of character switching. That's just a waste of real world money unless both being logged in is just that much more convenient.
---
I'm not defending bethesda per se, they seen to be making shitty decisions daily now. But if a crazy amounts of items are breaking the servers, and by extension, every ones enjoyment of the game. I cant day the weight limit really is that dumb of an idea. 
---
There needs to be some way to keep people in check.
---
And you're assuming it did....
---
See how illogical it is to make assumptions to challenege assumptions? 
---
lol u mad bro
---
I would love to uninstall but they banned me for crafting to much ammo
---
 and if you cant log in you cant actually uninstall the game.
---
[They're like pokemon. Gotta catch em all](https://imgur.com/a/nthpaEY)
---
Bethesda's White Knight folks :).
---
Right, useful rewards you‚Äôre less likely to get at all because you‚Äôre getting Ultracite right leg plans.
---
Once again, same exact glitch for me. Melee and everything as you mentioned.
---
Get out of here.
---
So my tank is all over in special and perks it shows.
---
My alt is much more dialed in. Focus on Perc/agl/intel  and strength minimal
---
I want to respec my tank to strength endurance and agility from highlander quote, heart strength and steel lolz
---
Workshops really haven't been worth it since the ore nerf.  The only useful ones I've found are the ones with Junk Piles.  And that exposes you to the instant teleport PVP you were talking about.
---
If they'd revert the ore nerf to give scrap like it used to, workshops would be worth it again.
---
Until then I just collect bulk junk and give my excess amounts on noobies.
---
you are able to play it nownownow, saying it is unplayable is a blatant lie.
---
fallout and buttcoin are 2 of my main subs. I appreciate the overlap.
---
have fun playing in dead servers if you don't care.
---
Permanent addictions would be nice. Junkie's weapons would be useful
---
Well there'd be loot drop in PvE on the server as well I'd imagine.
---
Without knowing where players are on the map, that'd be pretty scary.
---
To also be fair, FONV was a fucking buggy mess when it was released. The only real difference is that modders were able to fix shit because it was a single player game.
---
Yeah, they should dump their godly stuff to us poor ungodly crafting noobs.
---
If they ignored the haters they'd never do good work. üòã
---
&gt; You have no right to complain that people are "dev bashing" and feign ignorance like there's nothing wrong with your game
---
I mean ... yeah ... but ... this is not how "rights" work at all.  
---
what is the camden daily
---
I will gladly take whatever weapons you don‚Äôt want before u log off 
---
&gt;I can't imagine how awful it must be to have a personality where you feel you HAVE to endure a recreational activity.
---
I think the OP and other posters miss the point when looking at FO76 that the lack of an end game is a calculated design decision. By that, I don't mean there shouldn't be more quests and events added, but this is the exact kind of game that is designed to keep people hooked and pumping in hundreds of hours every month.
---
It's not a single player game so if you're playing it then you're participating in a world that deliberately has no ceiling. 
---
I'm on xbox and seen it twice today. 
---
The enemies healed all damage. And weirdly, didn't move. They seemed glitched in place and unlikable. 
---
The 'magic' one day fix is to roll out patch 4 again until patch 5 actually works.
---
It's not actually magic at all, it's pretty simple unless they are deleting their old versions when they release a new one.
---
I suppose that is very true. They did mention expanding past just junk on the loot drop table but we will just have to wait and see what all that includes 
---
lol, have fun being the vocal minority.
---
The problem with this is that Bethesda keeps editing them without saying anything.
---
i always have to scrap my bulk items in the tinkering station, before I can use them. kinda annoying.
---
I agree with him.
---
I have PS4 how can I tell how many hours I've got in on it?
---
That is a great point

I have been gaming for a very long time and i did rage quit for the first time 
---
But he quit! HE QUIT! The mad lad, what will we ever do? My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.
---
Thanks for your kind words :) Have a nice one!
---
I can understand your point at the same time I don't like getting slap damage while I am crafting or repairing from someone that thinks I want to fight. 
---
While that won't be eliminated entirely I hope it is reduced.
---
There is PVP zones and events in game now, it's just that the server population is too low to get hunter/hunted or Battle That Never Was off the ground
---
Perfectly said my man I‚Äôm getting annoyed of everyone complaining about their TSE. This honestly made the game more fun in every aspect. And I wouldn‚Äôt be considered a casual in the sense that I actually like min/max out my character but this TSE nerf actually made it that you have to build a character not just put an explosive perk on and go out and demolish everything which takes the fun out of building a toon.
---
Does Clytemnestra know you're on Reddit? :P
---
And you can't one shot things with a gun that does 400 damage? I one shot lots of stuff with an anti armor revolver *with no pistol perks equipped.* Even over-repaired, it only does like 120 damage. Hell, even without the anti armor, I can craft a non legendary version, and *still* kill most things in one or two hits, with no pistol perks. So you're claiming that with a full sniper build, with access to armor penetration perks and mods, and with damage increasing perks, and with what is ***still the most powerful combination of legendary effects***, with 400 damage, you can't manage to one shot things with sneak headshots? Either you are lying, or you are missing.
---
Ya I checked every body part but nothing. I have armorer 3 perk maybe I need another perk? Like science or something maybe?
---
WOW..i deleted fo4 to free up space..thought it would be gone completely..thx!!
---
Good, so now there are other alternatives and everyone won't be using the same TSE Handmade, makes for a more balanced game wouldn't you say? TSE made everything else irrelevant, now people will have to use a bit more strategy with their builds and not just demolition expert and a tse gun which was all you needed before.
---
Cool, so you‚Äôd be fine with her having a 10% chance to give something useful and a 90% chance to give something of literally no value to any player who‚Äôs done Belly of the Beast. Enjoy not getting how diluted loot tables are bad. 
---
what is the broken part of this game?  I play all the time and haven't seen but a few very minor annoyances.
---
Well it was. You forget people were able to get 5k base damage on some tse the dragons with perk decks built for it
---
But they already HAVE solved the issue in a previous patch! 
---
It shouldn't take more than a day to re-insert that code into this patch. 
---
No, let's wait another 2-3 weeks to fix something they broke twice now. 
---
So what would happen if your ranged character met your melee character? 
---
https://youtu.be/4HJ_10PQSLU
---
You are dwight 
---
This problem shouldn't ever happen with any game, ever.
---
Just junk, nothing else. 
---
I was wondering if a boycott/strike would be effective. This will do the trick? 
---
Yeah not falling for that one again.  
---
By the way, where is the apology?  Have they even said sorry at all?  They need to address the state of this game and the fans to give back some reassurance and trust.  It's good they are doing a hot fix but only after all the goodbye posts as it was planned for next week.  
---
I won't be reinstalling until big changes happen.  Obviously they can't happen overnight but Bethesda have been silent to the concerns for the direction of this game.
---
They should have been the way they are now from the start and PA plans should be removed from drop tables. Rose also should have given you plans to raider pa instead of the frame.
---
Cause even if they are not free for all, after you have the part getting it again is a waste anyway.
---
This change is good but the plans need to be removed from drop tables. 
---
Where are you getting the numbers 1.2 and 1.6 from?
---
I wish the devs would take their work seriously.
---
YEAH lets let OTHER PEOPLE dictate what fun we can and cant have! I feel ripped off too! How dare this game get bad reviews it must be bad! I wouldnt know because i cant bother to play it myself! Hi yongyea
---
Exactly what leads you to believe Bethesda tracks this, or ANY metrics involving FO76?
---
I use the Chemistry Bench with the sink in it and the Ice Machine to round out my kitchen. Chem bench can even be used as an island.
---
Actually I feel that number is a lot larger than you think. Not everyone is vocal on reddit and plenty console players enjoy the game and stay out of this drama altogether. You are probably in the minority honestly. They hyped up a fallout multiplayer experience, which is exactly what we got. 16 times the detail is actually there, the game is packed with tons of foliage, props, and interactables. We got distant weather systems, nukes, crafting materials everywhere, multiple biome types, hidden lore, more enemy AI in a fallput game than ive ever seen. 76 is the most immersive survival/multiplayer game out there imo, if you dont enjoy the game thats fine but you are wrong as hell in saying its a "bad" game. 
---
That is 6 hours a day every single day. You could do all that stuff in a single 6 hour play session. 
---
Ill look into finding a bloodied tse weapon. Atleast thanks to my low endurance i might be able to compensate for the nerf
---
So now there are choices. How is it a bad thing? 
---
I think one of laymen gamings recent videos called out this sub as nothing but fan boys and sycophants, so you can add sycophants to the list lol.
---
Or Stan! "True Believer!"
---
If the Anthem demo this weekend is even remotely passable then FO76 is probably going to get uninstalled from both of my PS4s.
---
Even if it isn't I might drop it anyway. My wife and I pre-ordered Monster Hunter World to scratch that online co-op itch in the last few weeks of her pregnancy... and our son wound up being born literally the day before it released (he was 3 weeks early) so we never really got around to engaging with it.
---
We were hoping FO76 would fill that void but she gave up on it over a month ago. I've stuck around hoping it would get better but that hope is fading fast.
---
Is this a passive aggressive "I quit" post?
---
Yeah wtf, bunch of sheep here hahaha. So damn ironic. 
---
...I forget nothing. That should not have been possible either
---
Not if we want there to be any semblance of game balance and difficulty whatsoever.
---
LOL that's what I thought too :)
---
They realy need to nerf melee change my mind
---
I noticed that.  Like 1 or 2 people at Whitesprings and no nukes going off on the PS4 servers I was on.
---
I think i'll join ya, maybe even with my super trash, horrible, pea shooter tse handmade. Might kill a few radroaches with it, although i'll probably run out of ammo doing so huh?
---
Dunno if they will touch TSE anytime soon, it is good but not too good right now, and is your gatling TSE only or has something else there too? 
---
He did?
---
Didnt the thread get like 1K upvotes? 
---
Yo, dawg, I heard you like Roadmaps...
---
If you liked the old games, go for it.  It's the RE4 style of third-person shooter gunplay, but with the difficulty and atmosphere of a survival horror game.  Don't let the third person view fool you, you will *not* be killing zombies by the dozen.  =)
---
i took my time with the main story to stretch out my time as much as possible, traded alot with other players, playing with friends i made in the game and building my C.A.M.P but that was a month ago now i log on walk around in my C.A.M.P and instantly log out
---
That's not how it works, lol. I'm sorry you don't understand that.
---
The generator plan drops from the powerup events are NOT rng. They are guaranteed drops in succession from small to fusion every time you complete the events.
---
Lol @760 hours, filthy casuals
---
Uh, probably not.
---
With the amount of bad reviews it got online, and the constant uproar of the community, not a good shot.
---
They could turn it around though.  Some simple fixes I proposed:
---
The map was littered with them?
---
Nice. Endurance needs a complete revamp. 
---
You can only use about 9 points for anything combat useful (mitigation) in endurance. 
---
The rest is all item efficiency/survival crap. Who cares about their goddamn hunger and thirst bars when they got 30 corn soup and 70 purifier water!!!
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to accuse Bethesda of being in the wrong for not having included the mod community entirely into their bug fixing process earlier. It‚Äôs not like that‚Äôs an industry standard it‚Äôd be entirely unprecedented. My main gripe with your post is it comes off like Bethesda should of come up with this already when it‚Äôs not as obvious as presented. It seems like a great idea but the way you convey that is what made me defensive here. 
---
I originally built a nice base that was secure from most creatures. It was a tower type camp with metal walls and elevated turrets. Some enemies would stand out of range of the turrets and shoot them or my walls but for the most part it worked with only small repairs every once in a while. I also had an unlocked section at ground level for other players with access to the necessities. I really liked this set up because I like the PVE aspect of the game and I love to build.
---
However, after having my camp destroyed three times by griefers  I decided I was done with that style of camp and needed more protection. Unless Bethesda decides to do what they should have done and make it impossible for other players to damage your camp if you are on pacifist mode (which is all I have interest in).
---
After much experimentation I succeed in creating a two part camp using mainly concrete ramp and regular foundations along with stairs and upper floors. I built my the first part of my camp by placing a concrete ramp foundation on the ground at the beginning of a bridge. The ramp foundations are basically two stories tall and allow you to attach regular concrete foundations to them without sinking so far into the ground.
---
I eventually got the placement and height of the ramp just right. This enabled me to attach one regular concrete foundation to it that was almost flush with both the inside bridge rail (the rail shows through slightly on the inside of the foundation) and the surface of road. I was then able to make a line of the regular concrete foundations down that edge of the bridge. 
---
Next I attached a metal stairway (not the platform type but that should work too) to the top of the second regular concrete foundation. The a couple of upper floors and then another set of stairs down to the other side of the bridge. Again this took me a bit of experimentation to get the placement right so that everything lined up. 
---
Now I was able to attach a regular concrete foundation to the bottom of the stairs on the other side of the bridge. I then set a line of foundations attached to it parallel to and the same length as on the other side of the bridge. Once the foundations are set you can remove the stairs because foundations are supported.
---
Once the side foundations were in I had to mess around getting foundations at each end to close the area off. I think I ended up using nine foundations on each side and two on the middle at each end. This leaves you with a seven by two area inside to place workshops and your bed and stuff. The floor is the road on the bridge (an in game structure) and the walls are foundations which cannot be destroyed. Keep in mind it may take a while and you may have to use other foundations and ramp foundations to help you glitch your end walls in but once they are in place you should be able to remove any extra foundations.
---
Now I needed a roof so again I attached a regular stairway to the top of one of my foundations. Make sure you place it where you want it because these stairs will have to stay. I placed them where I thought it would make a good sniper spot. Once you place your stairs attach a section of upper floor to the top of it and then another stairway going down. The stairs need to line up so that you can attach an upper floor to the bottom of the second set of stairs that will go to the edge of the foundation. Then just keep attaching upper floors until you end up with a floor/ roof running all the way between the regular concrete foundations.  
---
The only way to access your base will be to activate your camp and store one of the floor pieces or foundations. I recommend removing a floor piece because the foundations (especially the ones on the ends)  are basically glitched in and you may have trouble replacing them. Anyway once safely inside simply replace the upper floor and no other players (unless they are on your team) can access your camp.
---
I do not think it is possible to place the foundations high enough to put in interior walls. I know mine is not quite tall enough for them but all of my crafting stations fit just fine. 
---
I did have problem with a few things jumping through the floor/ roof or into my stored section when I initially placed them but with a bit of tinkering I was able to get everything placed. I tried to place some turrets up on tables inside but this made them just slightly too high and they would either place on top of my roof or go into my stored section. Also pull your items slightly in from the edge of the foundation. My chemistry station would not work initially because I had it tucked to tightly into the corner. It is also possible that one version of a crafting bench may work when others won't. I have not tried it but I saw someone else mention that in their build the large power armor station would not place but would jump to the next floor. However the smaller one placed just fine.
---
I used basically the same technique to make a slightly less secure area under the bridge for my water and adhesive farm. Here I used mainly the concrete ramp foundations to go from the ground to the bottom of the bridge or very close. Again you have to mess around with the height and placement of these and may need to use other foundations to help glitch them in. 
---
The reason this area is less secure is that although I enclosed the area with the foundations there are some areas where players could shoot in. The ramp portion of these foundations is not quite as wide as the bottom part which leaves a small gap on each side of the ramp for other players to shoot in although they can not get inside. The only way to access this area is to activate the camp system and store a foundation. Then walk inside and replace it. 
---
My camp does still get attacked. Sometimes super mutants (and I assume other creatures too) do spawn inside of both my upper and lower sections but it is usually only one that spawns inside while the others spawn outside (I have only had this camp for a few days at this point). I have two turrets placed in each area. For me the attacks have seemed to happen so far mainly when I am at camp and the enemies focus on the turrets which makes them very easy to deal with. So far I have only had two turrets and five plants damaged to the point that they needed repaired rather than stored and set back down.
---
I guess some players may know how to glitch themselves inside of my camp but I am hoping that this design cuts down on the griefing. The three times my other camp was destroyed I was on pacifist mode (I always am) and had done nothing to provoke it. I did not even bother to try and stop them or get revenge it would have been pointless because the way the game is set up the advantage is on the side of the attacker. I don't even think I had seen the players before. Each time it happened everything in my entire base was destroyed except the foundations, stairs and upper floors. 
---
Anyway, I hope this works and hopefully it may help others. Also this will be a really awesome camp if they eventually add fast travel rugs. Then you would not even need to remove a floor or foundation to enter. Of course you can always just fast travel to leave. 
---
It figures they would take the servers down for maintenance at the exact time we set to meet. üò°
---
Before downvoting read my post history on this sub. I usually take a moderate approach to the choices and implementation of the development team.
---
Regarding the ultracite PA plans being part of the Queen's drop table post patch and their response...this really feels like a carefully worded "we don't care". I work for a fortune 500 company. I deal with the federal government daily as part of my job. Part of my job is professional correspondence with US Customs and Border Protection. That paragraph reads just like one of their "I don't really care but I can't directly say that." e-mails.
---
Bottom line aside from the Ultracite mods (which I am fine with) the other power armor parts have no place in her loot table. The response given to the community on the subject is condescending and outright insulting.
---
You keep proclaiming this anger but maybe you‚Äôre just an overly sensitive little man that thinks this is actually aggressive. You clearly have never experienced real aggression.
---
I know right! Ima actually hella pissed
---
Yeah, it's awesome.  I just wish they'd tuned the difficulty for Normal a little lower.  Between the raw damage zombies take, their grab range, and the lickers always placed in close quarters, I find it VERY hard to do the "dodge 'em and run" tactics the game clearly wants you to favor.  
---
You get to the point you don't really need Bobby pins anymore. I dropped and sold a lot but keep like 30+ in case I'm having a bad day finding that sweet spot haha. I think it might help me too, I have my camp on a junk pile that seems to get most materials I need for repairs. Not sure where I keep acquiring ballistic fibers, but it might be from that brotherhood camp you turn technical data into as I loot that place every time, too. 
---
In 340 hours I've only had 4 weapons drop that are 2* or higher.
---
That's not balance.
---
What kind of receiver do you use? I noticed the tweaked (or was it tuned?) auto receiver (the one that increases critical damage) did not get a damage increase from perk cards.
---
yea all i do now is login for daily atoms and to clear the vendors caps out. my gameplay it time gated by the cap limit(both vendor capped and player capped). i never cap stash farmed, takes to long for console players to be worth going thru all the loading screens for such a pitiful amount unless you went all in with cha and the specific perk card.
---
bulk items are useless, only 2 actually cut weight down, the rest i leave unbulked, ive never ever had to sell junk for caps, outfits and drugs/aid items is more then enough. should have just made a specific limit to junk items like every one caps out at a stack of 300 or 500, weighs nothing in a stash so people can use the weight limit of the stash for weapons and armors
---
You are not a downer, because I knew it. This was a joke.
---
This reminds me of the previous hotfix where they "fixed" duping by making it so that you couldn't craft 300 items to roll back to a checkpoint to restore inventory. It was a lazy fix that took an hour for them to work around.
---
And most of these are justifications, not fixes. I'm through trying to be optimistic about this game. Just stop fucking it up so bad that I have to respec my character every month
---
My camps been nuked so many times there's no point doing it myself
---
She's dropped a prime receiver along with an ultricite plan every time I ran her, after I had all the ultricites I didn't stop running her so her loot table was already "diluted". There was always complaints about her drops. Shut up and eat your ultracite explosive venti-os
---
Hard fucking agreement. I've been getting cult vibes from this playerbase ever since the negative press waves first started and everybody began panicking and shouting down anyone who spoke criticisms of the game, as if bringing awareness to issues is a personal insult to them.
---
Here's the copied patch notes.
---
# FALLOUT 76: INSIDE THE VAULT ‚Äì JANUARY 31, 2019
---
This week we‚Äôre providing new insights into some of our decisions with patch 5, including info on weapons balancing, vendor pricing and more.
---
### HOT TOPICS ABOUT PATCH 5
---
* **Patch 5 reverted Bobby Pin weight.** In Patch 4, we had reduced Bobby Pin weight from 0.10 lb to 0.001 lb each, and this was mistakenly undone in patch 5. We are addressing this in [**a hotfix going live later today**](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319175/upcoming-hotfix-january-31-2019?language%5B%5D=en). This issue occurred when a merge of our development builds failed to execute properly prior to releasing patch 5. We are working on ways to prevent this from happening again in the future.
---
* **Bulk Scrap can no longer be auto-scrapped.** This was an unintended side-effect of our change to stop loose mods from being auto-scrapped when you didn‚Äôt have enough materials while trying to craft. We‚Äôve identified the cause of the issue and are currently planning to address it with our upcoming hotfix so that you can get back to crafting without having to manually scrap your bulk items.
---
* **Plans and Recipes appearing as (Known) across all characters.** This is a UI issue introduced with Patch 5 that caused all plans and recipes a player had learned on one character to appear as ‚Äú(Known)‚Äù across all their characters in trade and inventory menus. Known plans and recipes are intended to be tracked separately for each character on an account, and we‚Äôre currently planning to address this in the upcoming hotfix.
---
* **Concerns that Ultracite Power Armor plans being available at Taggerdy‚Äôs Terminal negates the need to fight the Scorchbeast Queen.** One of the key rewards for Belly of the Beast is a full set of Ultracite Power Armor. Some players accidentally deleted this reward and were understandably upset. We made this fix to ensure everyone that completed Belly of the Beast could remake this power armor even if they accidentally dropped or deleted it. These recipes can also drop from the Scorchbeast Queen, but this wasn‚Äôt meant to be one of her primary rewards, since everyone in the Scorched Earth event already should have access to the Ultracite Power Armor.
---
* **Energy and Heavy Weapons Improvements.** We've heard and share your feedback that energy weapons need to be brought inline with other weapon types. We're also looking to adjust laser weapon durability in a future update. Additionally, after recent balance changes related to Perks and Legendary Mods, players have expressed that explosive non-legendary weapons are now less powerful. We agree there are improvements we can make. We‚Äôre doing an audit of heavy weapons damage and their ammo weights. We plan to increase damage in light of the perk and mod reductions, and plan to reduce ammo weight to make heavy weapons generally more viable. These adjustments will roll those out in a future update.
---
* **Perk balance adjustments**. Demolition Expert was reduced to match related damage perks. The damage bonus it previously provided was very high and was causing balance problems, especially when combined with the Explosive Rounds Legendary mod. We also reduced the condition loss and repair bonuses offered by the White Knight and Licensed Plumber perks to help them better match perks like Power Patcher. We know the balance changes we made to these cards have caused some frustrations. We make these decisions to encourage more balanced pick rates across all perk cards, and even out perks that can start to feel mandatory when they‚Äôre overperforming compared to other cards. We‚Äôre hearing your feedback about repair costs and we‚Äôre currently looking into reducing them in general with future updates.
---
### KNOWN ISSUES AND FEEDBACK
---
In a previous ‚ÄúInside the Vault‚Äù we promised to publish a Known Issues list. We had hoped to have this list ready by now. We are currently putting together a list that features not only the top issues we see players referencing, but also some of the top feedback and requests. This list will not be exhaustive and contain every issue or request we‚Äôve seen you share, but we will work to keep it updated consistently to add and provide insight on the biggest things you want to know about.
---
You will be able to find the Known Issue List once available on our [**official forums**](https://bethesda.net/community/category/232/fallout-76?language%5B%5D=en) or on [**Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76). We are aiming to get it out later today. As new fixes are implemented and new top issues and concerns surface, this Known Issues list will grow (and shrink) over time. Stay tuned for more!
---
We hope that you continue to provide us feedback on Fallout 76 and all that‚Äôs involved including these articles and things like the list.
---
Yeah, me and my friends don't want to make "new" characters for every new flavor of server that comes out.
---
With the massive nerfing to XP all over the place, and the price increases on plans, it wouldn't even be remotely worth it to try the PVP mode from level 1.
---
&gt; STOP. FULL STOP. nope. you and this sub ARE NOT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FO76 players. you ain't! I'm sorry. 
---
Because Bethesda makes the player counts public?
---
Sorry, but this game is getting emptier as the fuckups keep piling on, this subreddit is probably quite representative of the player numbers at this point.
---
i dont know what my total hours (lvl 192) are but i started playing 2nd day of beta, then when it released fully i would get on game around 7pm at night and logout around 2 or 3 am (sometimes staying up until 4 or 5 am if something interesting was happening).  
---
i usually start my evenings by hitting 2 or 3 places to farm steel, lead, plastic, or if needing something for another build or repair (like i will go pick cranberries to make relish for myself and friends before they show up). Anywhere from 8pm to 10pm my friends i run with usually show up online. we drop a nuke or two, go farm glowing stuff a bit, hit each others houses mess around, chat, then go vendor stuff, maybe drop another nuke. sprinkle in the wander around and look at stuff. there are still places i have not been to yet (still grey on map). like i just found the crazy cat lady house 3 or 4 nights ago.   
---
always something to do somewhere in the game but my favorite waste time spot is hitting watoga and killing robots in the hopes of finding a 3 star legendary robot from time to time (i have spent 8 hours there farming robots). steel, lead, and legendaries..   
---
not hard to hit massive hours when you can find yourself things to do and thoroughly enjoy (some) mundane things.   
---
I used to play Final Fantasy 11 so i am used to sitting in one spot for hours waiting on a Notorius Monster to spawn to find its spawn time and just randomly killing mobs close by. NM hunting if some ya run with doesnt know spawn time can mean sitting in one spot for up to 24 hours to catch the time it appears, sucks when it spawns and youre in the bathroom or something and it turns into sitting 48 hours. In Final Fantasy anyways.. not sure how other games like that handle those. Anyways when ya get the spawn time it means coming back everyday to try and catch it before someone else does to kill it since its pop window could be roughly 60 minutes before or after pop time.. so more 2 hour waiting.. then if you do catch it youre back the next day and the next.. and after all that if you do catch it you hope the RNG gods are nice and you roll that 1% drop chance to get the item you need, or youre back the next day and the next and so on.
---
Define problem.  How much is Beth paying you?
---
Your not alone
---
There's your endgame content right there, folks.
---
As someone who codes for android apps, yes. Yes it does. 
---
Kudos for some perspective. The gaming community can be a virile, hate machine sometimes and the Fallout fan base is no exception to that
---
Found You Icarus!! Can‚Äôt hide from my PvP Boy!!! Run and make post trying to fool these nerds but you were begging for a pvp server when I was hunting you down like a scared lil chicken you are and whooping your ass with your own buzz blade! 
---
My butthole is clenched with anticipation 
---
I like the game and it's fucked up.
---
Did you see that?
---
I just said I like the game and acknowledged it's fucked up.
---
What now bitches.  
---
Well, the media response and social response certainly mirror the kind of reactions The President gets, as well as the general rationality and fervor of those reactions.    
---
really doubt you haven't had problems but i don't doubt that you have had a good experience.
---
Ill be tossing all my godly gear in a fissure and hopping in, as a nuke comes down outside of the boundaries of the map. 
---
I‚Äôve got to 2 purifiers and it‚Äôs amazing how quickly they stack
---
I typically will leave for noobs @v76 or sell to vendors unless i get mugged by sb and scorched
---
Explosive weapons are meant to pack a serious punch, which they didn¬¥t to before the nerf, and are now completly useless after the nerf. Again, it didn¬¥t got nerfed because it was "out of line" with the other perks (you can repeat that as much as you want) but to nerf the explosive legendary affix even more.
---
 Just because it stands as a dev note in the patch notes, it doesn¬¥t make it true. Or did you ever hear a complaint that launchers and there like are to powerfull or demolition expert is OP? No, the only thing players talked about for a good while was TSE and bobblehead stacking.
---
By your logic glow sight should receive a nerf too, because 60% for 3 points? How dare that perk increases damage by that much!!!elf
---
Clearly buggethesda doesnt care about white knights since they nerfed it
---
Right but I guarantee that no one plays like you, I‚Äôve seen the builds, and they leave little room for anything except killing. These are level 50-100 builds when you have a surplus of everything. Not level 1-75 builds where you don‚Äôt have enough screw to do anything. I tried doing this on a new character and the card unlocks per level don‚Äôt match builds all that well, it had me choosing random cards because the build leveler I follow online stated that I had all the cards I needed that were unlocked at the time. With all this and the issues everyone are having with keeping space in their inventor makes me think that
---
1) you don‚Äôt pick up any junk anymore
---
2)your always close to maxed on weight
---
3)all you do is level and never fallow a quest just to enjoy the game.
---
4)you have a 2-3 star weapon at lvl 50
---
5) you probably don‚Äôt have armor breaking reduction or you have cards at one star for those things.
---
All these things I don‚Äôt want or have. I like collecting junk, fighting players and questing/building.
---
Having a balance of all these things is hard and requires you not to min/max like 2k melee over here ‚òùüèº.
---
I don‚Äôt act like the build I have is perfect like, I‚Äôd rather not have it be perfect. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúgive and take‚Äù game if you want to enjoy you have to remember that part of the ‚Äútake‚Äùis selecting space saving cards or other cards. I see people like this who max out damage and all they do is complain about never having unbroken armor or never having enough of one resource etc. I don‚Äôt want to be one of those complainers, as soon as I remove the chem weight reduction card I start getting like this so I stopped.
---
Considering people rarely had 5k builds and considering i never saw anyone using tse weapons in pvp they were pretty balanced in that aspect. The only unbalance was the duping. If people hadnt had duped the motherloving fuck out of the weapons and instead left them a rarity, they wouldnt have been nerfed and would be the end game weapon
---
Not really, you still get a three star drop.
---
This post should be on top above all other posts.
---
I thought the fallout community was full of great people but I realized that it‚Äôs full of whining kids at least on Reddit, maybe, since it‚Äôs now a multi player game all those whiners come from COD?
---
Yeah they are way too high....smoked lil too much weed probably 
---
A couple of minor inconveniences but I‚Äôm still having a good time 
---
&gt; To make an analogy: You pay cover to get into a bar, you slap your server on the butt, you get kicked out of the bar
---
Kicked out of the entire city since it's all of their games.
---
Kinda sad they dont have one of those "Take a moment to explain why you uninstalled." windows.
---
I always ignore these, but this time id have been glad to let them know of all the big and small things that suck about the game, and also the launcher.
---
I'm level 111ish, had one TSE that I shot a few times said "huh that's cool I guess" and sold. It was a dragon. I love that TSE is nerfed. I'm a little annoyed that other things aren't buffed. It feels like it's more stable now and I don't have to worry about trying to compete with that one guy mowing down everything and I can take my vampire auto tesla all over nuke zones and tank 15 glowing ones while everyone else helps. Can't wait to see what they do for heavy weapons after the latest inside the vault
---
Definitely hasn't changed, I've left it at the default since it was implemented. I changed it today and it seemed to hold the change but didn't make a difference.
---
I think that could be really interesting if it were implemented. It would also help the people who are actually RPing raiders or villains be "infamous".
---
Junkie's used to be one of the hardest to maintain but rewarding legendary effects in FO4. If you thought min-max builds were an odd play style, a Junkie's build would open a whole unexplored avenue. 
---
On what terms? 
---
The gameplay is fine with me, i was never tse main build that everyone is crying over...
---
On terms of disconnection and not being able to log in, i've had issues maybe up to 5 times a day :-)
---
Can we get some clarification on this or?
---
I mean the server disconnects are a little frustrating but I‚Äôm having such a good time playing it that it‚Äôs not that big a deal tbh.  Overall I‚Äôm having a great experience!
---
Sounds like depending on your build certain things are better.
---
Not tse is better than anything.
---
Not that I haven't had any problems but they're pretty timely on updates. Pretty good experience so far
---
I mean, it runs about as well as a cold war era Soviet made car, but it is still fun.
---
Your boss needs to be fired for this comment!  I kid, I kid. 
---
I've had little issues.  The things I've had problems with are just bugs that get worked out in new games.  I've played about 20 or so mmo's since the late 90s and nothing about the release of FO76 has been much different from those releases.  Some were worse and some were better.  Some of the things people have been complaining about have been laughable to me, but people have to get their panties in a wad about something it seems.  All the rage quitting amazes me.  We really need a sub for the quitters so they can regale us with their well thought out \*cough\* rationalizing.
---
Don't forget about melee
---
I was reasonably okay up until the last patch.
---
But you get way more from Whitespring. Not trying do debate the value here though, just wondering if they are purposely going to leave the now worthless ultracite plans in her loot pool or not. 
---
Will they come?
---
I am
---
Not one apology.  Just the patch notes from a few days back put into a post, with them doubling down on the stupid reasons for nerfing white knight and increasing plan costs.  
---
Makes me wonder.  Had the last patch been successful, what would we be seeing in today's inside the vault?  Because it sure wouldn't be talking about patch 5 mistakes.  
---
I mean i shoot and the whole room runs to kill me.
---
So you would agree that most players have probably spent most of their time building around the weapon that dropped for them?
---
Why should the players who rolled a good weapon have their progress reset?
---
How did you go from implying that no other 2nd slots were good.....to this?
---
The crying on this is fucking pathetic. 
---
A nerf to two affixes and 40% demo expert and people act like every gun in the game now does 1 damage.
---
I'm an explosive build and it feels fine with the nerf.
---
I can kill entire packs of nuke zone ghouls with 4 shots of my auto launcher.
---
More glitches? 
---
Please...no. 
---
Sounds like a southpark episode
---
Going to need more time than 11 weeks dude, and its gotten alot better, not worse. Sure there have been set backs, but its no doubt improving. Community needs settle down. 
---
I did logout once I realized they weren't RPing. I had my mike set to "team", so if they were talking I couldn't hear them. I did do a puke emote while they were killing me to see if they'd respond with an emote, but no such luck. I couldn't really grab names because it happened so fast, though.
---
I like to play devil's advocate at times but this rubbed me the wrong way too.
---
I really hope Bethesda doesn‚Äôt start assuming that players play a specific way. I‚Äôve done Scorched Earth countless times and I‚Äôve still never finished the BoS quest for Ultracite Armor. Please Bethesda, don‚Äôt start making adjustments already assuming we use specific armors, guns, or perks
---
The marshmallow to the oats
---
So you're saying we have to fix the game ourselves? What the fuck. 
---
Even people with it installed but not played is probably right on that same sheet of paper, but uninstall would definitely be a stronger indicator.
---
Yup. And every patch is making it better.
---
Your full of shit.  You happened to ‚Äúfind‚Äùduped items and had a super overloaded character just for helping people? 
---
You were duping and got caught. Now your butt hurt because they brought out the ban hammer. 
---
Good job Bethesda. This is what we‚Äôve needed on this game for awhile. Maybe some of the stability issues will  resolve themselves now. 
---
Thanks for making the post though. It should serve as a fair warning of what‚Äôs going to happen to people who continue to unfairly exploit the game. 
---
You can't have a bloodied Two-Shot weapon, they're both first affixes.
---
Why do you feel like you need a TSE weapon? Just because of how much you've heard people talk about it? Have you actually tried using any other legendaries?
---
Honestly having to even manage that much stuff, much less ferry it back and forth between two accounts just sounds like a pain in the ass. And never mind that I'd need another console etc to logistically make it work.
---
So its just a crappy version of the reaction plates? Kinda wanted it to be some sorta welded club melee weapon thing
---
Minority lol, you kidding man. Are you Todd Howard‚Äôs son? That‚Äôs hilarious man. All the review scores, all the videos, all the articles dissecting what went wrong and you think the majority of people who played the game consider it great? If that was the case none of the above would of happened to the degree it did. I‚Äôm a gamer first and a Fallout fan 2nd. It‚Äôs clearly an asset flip of Fallout 4. I mean it has the same bugs and exploits as F4 ffs lol. I gave F76 a fair chance but it‚Äôs not a good game man. Its bad man and the rest of the world knows it. 
---
I too have problems with the G930 and just started to think that it might be a problem with the headset, did you ever find a solution for your problem? I'm about to update my drivers to see if that fixes anything but unfortunately the servers just went down for a hotfix. 
---
It has not. The game has sold almost unbelievably bad according to the numbers, probably why Bethesda apparently had no sales goals for the game. 
---
Plenty, but people with positive experiences generally don't feel the need to rant about it online so you generally see majority negative statements.
---
Not trying to be rude but how do you actually know we are not the majority? Are there some stats I cam check out?  I like the game so not hating but I doubt there are over 70k people playing per platform. 
---
19k for serum recipe... NUTS... Get a full CAP stack to purchase a recipe. I have no intention to getting EVERY Recipe and Plan so it doesn't really matter. I think it was implemented to increase longevity of the game for those who intend to learn everything. 
---
&gt;a vi
---
Why do people write this shit as if its some kind of breaking news?
---
No Mutant's Allowed, which is Fallout's longest running and most influential fan website &amp; forum has always been noted for being a "hate machine". This goes back far before FO3 was even announced.
---
If you don't want to be a part of the Fallout franchise "hate machine" then you should play another game.
---
Without it crashing every 45 mins or so? Without it thinking someone is duping because they are crafting to fast and banning them (latest fuck up)? Without it ....you know what I could go on and on. 
---
We both know the game is in a terrible state, just look at all the issues its had / has. It was launched to early and isn't fit for purpose in its current state.
---
Denial is a beautiful thing, its a shame though once you open your eyes it's tough going back to living in ignorance.
---
Bethesda probably appreciate all that smoke your blowing up there arse, must do them and the game the world of good :D

Juicehed checked and it was working fine

It's bad for those who spent a hundred hours of gameplay building around a weapon only to have it nerfed and need to go back out and face the RNG?
---
Fallout 4 is a single player game, your saves are stored on the HD, you lose them if you uninstall. 76 stores all your information online to prevent cheating.
---

---
- PUBG did not invent the BR formula. No one "stole" from anyone.
---
- Was? Last time I checked it's still the #1 played game in the world and a money printing press for Epic Games, regardless of whether one enjoys the game or not. Personal bias is petty.
---
Oh, well isn't that nice...HOW ABOUT FIXING THE PART THAT DOESN'T ALLOW US TO SIGN IN NOW SINCE YOUR CRAPPY PATCH SCREWED THINGS UP? I haven't had the joy of even seeing how screwed up the patch is since I still can't launch the game. 
---
Putting reduced weight Bobby pins in the Atom Shop.
---
Any news on how busted mutations are with the changes to Radworms?
---
Yup, I wish comments came with the commenter age and iq level. Then I would know what to read and what to skip.
---
I see Bethesda devs are guilding this post. 
---
Agreed, just replied, too.
---
Thank you now you ruined my life. Way to go...
---
But yes I agree. When you see the comments about uninstalling and "my friends and I are quitting" it's usually a small percent of people who exist in that realm who not only care about such things but who are eager enough to voice an opinion on it here or other places. I consider myself a hardcore fan but don't usually go beyond an hour a night. The game, game companies, and game staff don't orbit those here or other social outlets. Their decision process most likely revolves around stats derived from players playing the game; info we aren't privy to. Clearly there is reason for Beth to continue to fix and create atom store content. People ARE buying this stuff and people ARE playing the game. A few over voiced individualized opinions isn't going to move to needle for them much.
---
With that said we should always apply pressure. The fans do matter and should always be heard and considered. But crying flaming personal attacks on staff and creating ideas on how to "punish" Bethesda is just a waste of time.
---
You need to develop a sense of empathy quick. You obviously care very much if anyone else enjoys the game. I didn‚Äôt drink koolaid. I just play it sometimes with my friends (less often than when it came out) and don‚Äôt relentlessly min/max like a lot of people seem to do. I just like the game despite its flaws like every other fallout game. 
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Excavator_power_armor
---
Found this link just now pretty useful
---
A disconnect now and then, but not every time I play. The recent bulked scrap issue with crafting. Other than that I have been having a blast. 
---
too bad someone got to the game with a flaming duel blade chainsaw first
---
I dont blame Beth specifically, i said the whole situation upset me. I see your point though
---
On console? If so, phew. Always capture daily for my core needs. 
---
Fusion cores weren't nerfed
---
That's true, if you're going to nuke a place for loot, Whitesprings is the better choice
---
Problems are so widespread in this game that I can safely say all players have had problems with it.  But maybe some players are less bothered by them and keep playing.  Maybe some haven't come across some of the bugs.  Maybe some haven't gone far enough into the game and haven't seen the bugs.  Maybe they have seen them but shrugged it off.   
---
Downvoted just for saying wow downvoted.
---
this is great actually, I can save myself from the grind while watching the game hindenburg from afar.
---
If you're well and truly leaving and never coming back.........
---
Help a new guy out :)  Find a new guy that's level 40 or so and drop a full set of legendary gear and weapons on them.
---
It's hard enough to play the game with the terrible legendary RNG, give someone else a leg up :)
---
Console too
---
Try using a beam focuser, of you can find or make one. Seems to make it a bit more effective as well as making it last longer than the splitter, and I prefer it over the vanilla one.
---
You.....you guys do realize that this is just a game right? Everybody here is acting like a big medical corporation is trying to hide malpractice cases. When all that happened is you just bought a game you don't like. Whatever happened to returning it and buying something else?
---
Two different questions. I've had plenty of problems, but also had a wonderful experience
---
They are probably attempting to fix the bugs from the last patch. 
---
And successfully making them even worse.
---
Mutations are fun indeed. The blueprint system is good as well, or was. Perk system is also good, like being able to switch cards and still retain a hard point system. Not all bad, it has potential.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319175/upcoming-hotfix-january-31-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
I read some posts here that they were accidentally reverted like bobbypins were. 
---
I wonder how many more weeks until Bethesda Austin shuts down and everyone is fired.
---
Still enjoying it so far. I just did the Line in the Sand event and killed two scorched beasts for the first time with my TS minigun. From all the spongy comments I thought it would take me 10 minutes to kill one of those, but I took them down in like less than a minute. I dunno, maybe later there will be even spongier enemies, but for now I don't see what's the complaints all about. At least as far as sponginess go.
---
To be fair - that's all a hotfix is really ever intended to do.  It should not, however, take 4 days to roll one out.
---
I could care less about their hotfix. I sold my bobbypins already. FUCK buggedthesda already
---
warframe
---
Seriously lol I just got off work early too, with a 3 day weekend 
---
Downvoted for the sense of entitlement in this post.
---
Yes, bad decisions were made regarding this game and its paraphernalia.
---
No, this does not mean Bethesda is incapable. You have no way of knowing who or what is responsible for what is going on, so calling the entire dev team out is completely irresponsible and speaks to your lack of knowledge about game design and management.
---
No, Bethesda is not "shady" for trying to put a rosy tint on things, however bad you or I seem to think they are. This is their game, and they want to sell it to you. That's their job. It's how the industry works. Any employee who posts on social media or anywhere that "things are bad" wouldn't be heroic, or honest, they would be in contractual violation with their employer and **probably fired.** Again, you not acknowledging or realizing this speaks to your ignorance of the production and customer relations process.
---
Criticize the game. Criticize the bugs. Criticize the cheaters. By all means, criticize the faulty production processes that lead to resolved issues being reintroduced to the game. But leveling criticism at the real alive people who are working hard to try and improve things is just downright silly.
---
You can still find 3 stars at Whitesprings? Your luck must be like 18
---
I find the funniest part is it even needs to be said.
---
The entitlement is so blinding. 
---
Preach!
---
Completely agree.  So much petulant, entitled, hyperbolic whining on this sub the last few days. Yeah a few minor things got messed up, and the game got balanced in a way you might not like.  Boo. Hoo.
---
I have to agree with your point, but doesnt that Also go against this very post? For me at least, I acknowledge this game is pretty shit in it's current state. Hopefully they do something about that, likely not though. However, just like your posts says, defending a company (criticizing it too) isnt really doing any good in this subreddit. I'm going to embrace the hate around this comment, but should this subreddit be about the game? Not how the developers have took a shit on the game? 
---
I wish I could come on this subreddit for info, or something cool people have discovered, what weapons to use, what's good or bad. But all this subreddit is filled with is post circlejerking anti-Bethesda. What happened to a subreddit being about what it was created for? This is r/fo76 not r/bethesdabad.
---
QAsmoke is an interior cell that is "nowhere" on the map.         
---
                 
---
You just need cheatengine and a door to whom you know the destination cell. Lookup for the destination cell in ram, replace it with the QAsmoke ID. Not much beth can do about it without changing a big portion of the netcode.                    
---
I think what happens is that when you pick up plants it runs the routine that shows what got added to your inventory, but for some reason it isn't filtered to items gained, and also shows items recently lost, such as ammo spent recently getting removed.
---
They fucking should care. I've got more money, and might still be convinced to offer them some for their next product. They continue on like this though, and I'll find something else to do with it. 
---
Because it‚Äôs a damn video game and people are going to min/max and generally go the easy route. Its the same reason anybody cheeses the Whitesprings farm to begin with. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs pretty frustrating, especially for small farm teams that can‚Äôt continually rotate players to proc the enemy spawn. In my view players ought to have something better to do than grind the same GD locations just to build a god character. I think the Whitesprings farm itself is a symptom of a deeply flawed game so I can‚Äôt really blame players for cheesing it or ‚Äústealing‚Äù kills. 
---

---
I was having issues with disconnects and crashes, but that's all been resolved. I have been enjoying it idk why so many people whine so loud
---
Lol ‚Äúcollecting this info.‚Äù 
---
Lmao i thought I had read them all when it came to I quit posts. Is this like. A video game suicide note? "Im going to miss these things when I am gone". If you like those things, you can just... Keep playing the game? You're only hurting yourself by not playing. Nobody else cares. 
---
Wow!  You would even give each dev a full hour to eat in that 26 hours?
---
Also noticed you didn't allocate any QA hours, which is probably the same mistake Bethesda made with the last release.
---
The issues is they nerfed the most easily effected gun for casuals by over 300% nerf.
---
They left only 3 Hardcore builds left. You have Bloodied, Melee and Sniper build. Which takes a ton of level to adjust to and build. Most of your casuals ran TSE. So it hurt Casuals more.
---
Secondly nobody is saying TSE didn‚Äôt some what a nerf. But nerfing the best guns in the game by 300% percent and not buff base gun damage by 30% across the board to make more Legendaries effective was incompetence showing in Bethesda Austin.
---
The TSE was done because of Melee users losing 50% of PVP battles. Then Your White knights who labeled TSE the symbol of duping. So Bethesda listened nerfed  all guns to death. So now Melee users will win 98% of PVP encounters. The white knights not realizing duper duped everything. Melee Weapons Junk AIDS Armor Guns Plan Recipes serums Clothing. They duped and destroyed everything.
---
Then to revert a lot of QOL changes and add new bug to the game. Oh guess what people are still Duping..
---
Do you now understand the backlash? This is coming for a level 203 who has 600 hours in the game. Who has defended Bethesda, but at some point you got to take the rose colored glasses off.
---
If you think TSE was over powered. You need to educate your self. Bobble Exploits and Sneak builds made TSE seem OP. When reality since Beta Melee builds can hit 10,000k dps builds and can still now isn‚Äôt overpowered?
---
This patch was supposed to be about balancing and Fixes it delivered neither. This patch was a complete Failure and is going to kill the player base if it isn‚Äôt Fixed or addressed ASAP.
---
So when the Majority is telling you that and complaining why are you not listening? Take you rose colored glass and headsets of and listen to the real issues.
---
Dude i doubt that 
---
I was having a great time outside of the random, frequent disconnects until they nerfed my most powerful weapon that I specifically chose perks for. Now I'm stuck with essentially useless perks.
---
Yoshidas bullet points at the end should be made law for all developers and publishers.
---
Yes I do believe there needs to be a change but at this point it's obvious they know what they are doing. They knew it was going to crash at launch. They knew they would receive backlash from the community. They know their engine is beyond repairable. I didn't buy Fallout76 because there was too many red flags for me at reveal trailer. I have watched all the news since releasing. That being said I was a huge fan of Bethesda since Morrowind. I hope Bethesda quits there Half-ass Bullshit and get a development team that works. 
---
I disagree that Bethesda is a horrible monstrous entity because they mismanaged a game. It happens, accept it and move forward. It doesn‚Äôt make them incapable of producing anything of quality in the future. Even EA as much as I have disdain for them always has the potential of releasing a quality project 
---
Stop being ignorant in public. The ONLY fix PvP needs is dedicated PvP servers. Nerfing aspects of the game that affect PvE in order to balance PvP is stupid, lazy and counter productive. PvP was solved long before Fo76 was a twinkle in Todd Howard's eye. It's fine to experiment, but a supposed triple A game that is suffering from more issues than a syphaltic monkey with ADHD is not the place to do it.
---
I think it‚Äôs more because the whiners outnumber people who don‚Äôt
---
A update to fix an update. 
---
I'm a Christmas noob too! I'm 111 though
---
I missed out on this decades fallout game because of how money grubbing Bethesda fucked everyone over
---
Do you have a Job, or are you just on here all day being a fanboi?
---
Oh man, please ban me for playing the game legitimately Bethesda! That will not only guarentee I stop playing 76, but any other releases that come out for a long time. People need to be fired over this dumpster fire...
---
I've seen more folks say they weren't. It's probably just a rumor or someone freaked like, "Omg did they revert the cores?" and someone took that as fact. 
---
fortnite was a hoard mode zombie defense game at one point, the battle royal stuff was a side thing (that became the biggest game on earth)
---
Lets be fucking real here. No one that's legitimately pissed at this game gives a damn about the CMs feelings.
---
 I'm sorry if that comes off as rude or just selfish but the truth is..  With the amount of fuck-ups on the FO76 dev teams part people can't help but vent and lash out at CMs as they're pretty much the ONLY people with any speck of real influence on the game's adjustment (even if only advisory).  People will jump into the subreddit, see a post that accurately describes their frustrations, notice the "Bethesda Replied" annotation and begin to furiously type out their anger. 
---
If the actual dev team spoke out here I assure you the amount of volatility being spewed at CMs would be almost entirely reallocated to the devs. I know I WISH I could tell these devs how incredibly incompetent they are for making backwards progress after months of disappointing patches. 
---
Even if attacks towards CMs get personal at the end of the day people just wanna play a damn fallout game (some w/ friends) and have fun. And currently this game is anything but fun. 
---
We have the technology.. we can make it better than it was.  Better, faster, stronger.
---
A drill to pierce Bethesda?
---
Excuse me?! I paid full price and convinced all my friends to buy the game also at full price, making me rightfully entitled. If this game isn't fixed soon I'll have no other choice but to make a very lengthy post letting everyone know I quit. I didn't spend literally 500 hours and all my caps for a duplicated two shot explosive shotgun for no reason! 
---
Bethesda will undoubtedly track install/uninstall rates as a form of market research. 
---
I would say virtually all modern media companies track users as much as possible to determine trends, to act accordingly. 
---
Youtube can you show hours per week you view, but only on the android app I believe. 
---
Netflix knows exactly how much you watch, how many times you've watched it, and much more information we don't know about. 
---
Website developers absolutely track users to see where people drop off, buy, read the most, to see trends and act accordingly. 
---
And me, personally, I've had GTA 5 installed on my X1 since the day I bought it because I keep going back to it. Games that suck get uninstalled and shelved/sold.  
---
My experience is far from perfect, but still enjoyable.
---
Last patch had more good in it for me than bad.  But server stability has not gotten any better, and the double loading screens and frozen character if you try to move when first loaded is still an ongoing issue.
---
\+1
---
I've been quite happy with my stealth build so far, but it seems like my stealth stats are being completely ignored since the patch
---
Ultracite Arm, Leg, Torso, and Helmet plans are the new Pearl Handed Revolver of the late game.....lol
---
I've taken to dumping them on noobies, or dumping them in containers near vendors.
---
I wish they'd mix up the SBQ and other reward pools to get more variety.
---
Just got the hotfix on my Xbox. 
---
848MB
---
 we need player dmg lvl caps and nerfs, legendary items will not matter. 
---
I downvoted bc this sub sucks.
---
You made me laugh with this one. Cause of the nerf,  likely 3/4 of the players will just be standing and waiting now lol
---
I enjoy the game, but I personally have problems with carry weight and damage being dealt and received. Stash boxes also hold so little, barely twice the carry weight of my own character. Those little things are values that would be easy for me to just edit myself if 76 weren‚Äôt online, or had private servers from the get-go. 
---
I agree. I love all of their games including 76. HOWEVER. I am raging pissed at the TSE nerf. My 130 character now mimics a lvl 30. They have fucked up big time on a scale I‚Äôve never seen. I can handle the disconnects, I can handle the dashboarding. What I will not tolerate is all my hard work time and effort being demolished in seconds by someone who changed the games code for the worse. Horrible move and they need to fix it. ‚ÄúBalancing the game‚Äù is a bullshit excuse. They caved to a bunch of kids who had no skill in playing the game. Pve is ruined now as it costs ten times the bullets to do what 1 used to do. Again now I have to carry more ammo spend more time shooting carry more stimpacks. Forget it. They better fix this shit. Not another dime comes out of my pocket till they make it right 
---
Again with the TSE.
---
You people are ignorant.
---
Two shot and explosive are rolls in 2 different categories. Not every gun with TS or Explosive is a TSE.
---
This community is full of ignorant people who keep repeating griefers, dupers, and TSE......but nobody seems to understand what any of them are.
---
I read your comment and understand what brought you to this point. My post is to be read as sort of input for reflection, since I am no hardcore gamer (2x a week perhaps), some of the issues you mentioned are new to me (e.g. that UI on PC is worse...as a visual designer I have to ask: WTF?!).
---
But your last statement may be on point. Nothing disrupts a branch more than a bunch of people changing their habits. For example, not buying their games any more. Nothing hurts more than that, and may upcoming publishers learn from Bethesda‚Äòs downfall, when customers stopped buying their unfinished products.
---
stupid analogy. In that case they would be trying but the chef refuses to listen and still it‚Äôs not their fault.
---
Heeyyy me and my team found a new spot that might work, I donno if you ever seen the bombed looking area by the monorail lift on the side of the cliff near the crashed vertibird but there's a bit of ghouls there. We are going to launch a nuke there next to see what happens. If you have PS4 send me a message and I'll add you and let you know when I get on this evening. 
---
Yeah I purchased the game a month ago after lurking here for the last two months and reading that with the last couple of updates that they we were beginning to see improvement. Now with the latest update, I‚Äôm sadly regretting my purchase. 
---
It's the same kind of posts like when the game launched that talked about the game net code transmitting things in plain text and other stuff.
---
There is a lot of angst out there and sadly that means the players have to do a lot of research themselves.
---
Several posts on this reddit have stated that the fusion core spawn rate has reverted back to 0.8 an hour at powet plant workshops. 
---
Some people have stated that they have not been reverted. Others say they have. 
---
With the high plan prices, which are horrible for newcomers who have no income and will take them a while to build that, they should be shared across the account. Before when they were cheaper that wouldn't have been an issue, but good luck get a 10mm plan at level 10 at these prices. 
---
A little over 1 gig on ps4
---
I can't say I've ever talked to my family about gaming, I can't imagine actually explaining to them about the gaming community.
---
YES BETHESDA WELL DONE \*CLAP CLAP\* BOBBY PINS ARE WAY MORE IMPORTANT THEN FIXING THE BUG THAT WONT LET PLAYERS LOG IN THE GAME GREAT JOB GUYS PAT YOURSELVES ON THE BACK
---
On PC I've had some issues that caused me slight distress in my experience. But I'm patient and over all I'm enjoying the game fully. For me, to be able to play with friends I've created over the years in the FO community is worth it alone. 
---
I'm thinking outside the box on why we now can buy almost anything and why the prices on those now offered items are so high.  I also realize that the TSE nurf and new weight limit also apply to my theory, all 3 changes yesterday is resetting the market and ridding the game of 100,000's of items.
---
\-  They are trying to bleed the market on caps, lower the overall amount of caps, as well as rid the market (system) of individual items.  In English, get all the "hoarders" or what ever you want to call them to sell/dump their stuff.  I'll use me as a prime example.
---
\- I'm lvl 217, I have 2 accounts, 10 characters.  7 of those characters are mules and everyone of them have 25k caps.  
---
\- The day the new patch hit I spent upwards of 50k on plans, mostly PA plans I didn't already have.   This automatically rid the economy of 50k Caps.  I game those 50k caps BACK to Bethesda.   
---
\-  To counter that I then sold at least 30k worth of guns, plans, serums, junk, clothing, etc (emptied out 3 mules)....to get back "some" of my lost caps.  
---
This did 2 things for the game, got rid of currency and got rid of some of the zillions of items in the game.  It actually did 3 things for the game as noted in the first of my post.  It has also brought the market back in check.  A few examples would be the cost of now nurfed TSE are going for like 1k, 3 days ago they still sold for 2-5k.  Yesterday "Bloodied" weapons we're selling in excess of 15k.  Serums are now selling at an all time low and serum plans have doubled in cost.
---
The bottom line up front is, it's stabilizing the market and purging the system of many items.  How many post did you see yesterday that said something like "Come get free or cheap items at the FO76 Vault"  The system needed a purge, we'll find out in the days/weeks to come if it worked.
---
just my .02 
---
Definitely buy Fallout 76, there is so much to explore and enjoy, the bugs sure are frustrating but you will not regret it, so long as you avoid reading this sub Reddit too much as that could maybe sway your point of view, temper your fun.
---
Buy the game, doubt it will cost you much now and have a ball. I bought my copy for the price of a coffee and a meal at my local coffee house and I don't get many hundreds of hours satisfaction out of a coffee, toasted sandwich and a cake.
---
Yes! I paid $130aud not just once but for 2 coppies of the Ps4 Tricentenial edition for my son and myself and for what exactly.. a shit card Beta that we had to wake at 4am for on a few occasions and a heap of bs skins. And thinking yeh this game is revolutionary i dont mind the extra 30 for the skins vecause this game will remain around the 100 mark for quite a while.... 
---
Not even a 500 atom refund for me. 
---
One of my friends on Xbox1 got the Power armour edition... well didn't he get the shit stick. 
---
Thank you for this mate
---
And I hope you get it.
---
Its just that what they have said pretty clearly points to it being just global PvP enabled servers.
---
What uninstalls?
---
Thnx will have a look after work if the game works 
---
Not me.  I've always balanced praise and criticism.
---
Won't stop doing either :)
---
If I like something, I'll say I like it.  If I don't like it, I'll say I don't like it.
---
How else are they going to know how good / bad a job they're doing.....lol
---
Enemies will often move, or shot, towards  the sound of weapons fire. Changing positions between shots is often enough to lose them. 
---
I'm sure you're aware, but silencers are also helpful for keeping your position concealed.  
---
I DONT OWN THIS GAME.
---
Would some mind educating me on how this specific system works?
---
So say I want to play with 2 of my friends.. and we want to build a single ‚Äúfort‚Äù we can always build on, improve over time, etc. Is this possible for the 3 of us to do this.. similar to Ark. 
---
I couldn't agree more. Sorry to hear about your lever action rifle. 
---
Then stop playing, problem solved. You're welcome.
---
&gt;te 
---
I'm not young. Like I said, read up on the concept of gambling and addiction when it comes to game and social media mechanics. You might learn something.
---
What's the deal with radworms?
---
I logged in yesterday and my mutations, while not suppressed, were not active. I couldn't put together a correlation. 
---
The game is 30 dollars. 15 pre owned. Buy it, play it, and see for yourself. Dont base what you like on what others say. Fuck it dont even listen to me. Do what you like based on you. Fuck the rest. Imo its a good game to casually play. 
---
Its possible to avoid some of the damage when they are attacking normally. 
---
When the projectiles are fired they are locked onto the location the character will be if the character continues its current movement and speed, which is why sprinting while its attacking doesnt do much, the attack is headed to the same location you are. Standing still and moving after the attack doesnt help a great deal either because of the aoe.
---
But if your already strafing left or right and then switch directions after the 4th attack is released all the attacks will head one direction while you go the opposite. This allows me to avoid 2-3 of the 4 projectiles if I get the timing right.
---
If they are spazzing out and firing off attacks like a minigun like they often do then yeah there is just nothing to do about it. The spaz attacks are what need fixed imo.
---
Guess you could sell your account and advertise how many points you had lol. Nobody would bite I bet. I've made over 7500 points for the shop in challenges and none of it would make me wanna buy someone else's
---
Honest mechanics question. How do you hit 10,000 on melee?  I have enough stored points for a serious rebuild, and if I can get a 10,000 dps, I am all over it. I would love to know, not because I doubt, but because I want to emulate 
---
Well, good to know the data is meaningless. The base Xbox one has a 500 gig hard drive. That's like 4 or 5 games. I uninstall games I like on a daily basis because my friends wanna play other stuff that night. 
---
I hope so. Will check tomorrow after this patch. 
---
Going through the same issue on ps4 in 2019 lmao, I know I've read over 20 magazines but still no trophy for me..
---
Be careful with prime receivers.  It's a one time mod that you CANNOT change back.  That gun will forever take the more expensive prime ammo.
---
Just as an FYI, I live in Australia so it's just morning time for me now. Will be following up on it today.
---
But... but we already have the pitchforks... and these torches won't light themselves, now.
---
Joke aside, agree 100%. We've already seen some silly mistakes made, I personally would prefer people not collectively flip their shit until some confirmation happens either way.
---
wtf is hope?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I figured because I looked everywhere . I was only level 6 
---
You answered my question. Thank you!
---
Remember when you bought video games the were finished the day you bought them? 
---
But how many devs were transfered to the atom shop team? 
---
I'm doing pretty much every challenge of the challenge list. Currently at 8700 atom earned and i even spent 800 by mistake.
---
Then i do events to try and earn rare outfits.
---
I did the queen 5 times btw and only go to whitespring for the flora.
---
I could buy kingdom hearts or anthem and be done with f76 but i hate having more than one game at a time,and f76 is still quite fun.
---
OMG.. I thought it was just my xbox. Terrified me. Glad to hear it was not just me! 
---
\&gt;  Skyrim is my top favorite game and even if their next release is a long awaited Elder Scrolls game, Bethesda can blow me. 
---
Do you really prefer it over Witcher 3? Why?
---
I am actually waiting for Bethesda to catch up to that standard, but then there's Cyberpunk 2077 coming this year, soo...
---
Super Duper Mart 
---
They're not assuming shit.   They're stating the basic fucking fact that the PA set is absolutely free just for playing the mission.  There's never been a market for basic Ultracite parts because everyone gets the set for free, what fucking difference does it make that they're even more free than before.
---
Ditto, kiddo.
---
Perhaps they actually enjoy playing the game? Regardless of how much that irks you, why do you care anyway what other people think.
---
5000 damage?
---
You are crying because you don't do 5000 damage...
---
What. The. Fuck.
---
Biggest issue is disconnects/crashes which, for me anyway, have dropped considerably since last patch. Still love it. Been off work this week so have totally no-lifed it. I'm more interested in the exploration, crafting and making characters than running laps of Whitespring with a noobcannon so yeah it's enjoyable.
---
Yeah cause you can craft top-tier epic loot in WoW, right? 
---
I love it. Had small issues, but never anything I felt like really griping about. From time to time I simply wonder about some of the odd design decisions. Make "super duper" locked until level 50? Make a huge water park in the Toxic Valley and put, like, only 12 scorched in there? Make a hospital in Charleston and put, like, 12 scorched in a fairly small entry point? None of this makes me frustrated, and I'm not at all saying that I think it's bad design, I just wonder about it sometimes.
---
Me! Ps4
---
Im in the dark here, what did they do?
---
It's a game mechanic to make and break down your own guns to lead mods - they certainly can't ban for that, even if you made a hundred or more each of a particular gun.
---
I'd bet this is a baseless rumor.
---
A hotfix is meant to fix what the last update broke or implemented incorrectly. They shouldn't include any new items - just fixing the last update as quickly as possible.  They could have spent time making a bigger update that did more than a hotfix but they probably figured we did not want to wait another two weeks. And updates/patches can be done quicker but the quicker they are done, the more bugs/problems there will be because there won't be enough time for testing. Likely these latest issues were because they were trying to hurry the update out by the end of the month when if they could have waited an extra week they could have done better. It's basically a balancing act that happens with any software product.
---
no 
---
Pneumonia days off.
---
Technically there‚Äôs a guy impaled on a spike and raider stuff where my camp is so does that count?
---
But if it sucks would you still buy it?
---
Bloodied build stack a ton of strength and bloodied Weapons 3 Handed..there is videos on YouTube 
---
I have for now, but still am interested to see how Beth handle this current situation, since it will have a major influence over any future games from them I may consider playing.
---
And OP can go fuck himself.  Get the fuck out and don't come back.
---
Games were also buggy af when you bought them, and 99% of the time there were no patches to fix anything. 
---
You? Hell I climbed in my closet and for my old Xbox 1 out thinking my brand new 1x shit the bed. Do you know clustered my closet is? I could have died lol
---
it's not the player's fault if the game's shitty servers can't handle some guy with a full inventory logging in. that's like an extremely tiny amount of information for the server. each item has all sorts of IDs and is associated with meshes and textures and shit, but all that information is being parsed by the client, not the server. at least if they programmed the game correctly it would be. when you play a game it's not your responsibility to regulate or moderate your own behavior to avoid putting strain on the game's server. as long as you're not hacking the game with cheat engine or using exploits, intentionally ddosing the server, or harassing people, you should not be banned. it's bethesda's job to design a game that doesn't get broken by normal people doing normal things. it's not the player's job to avoid doing things that come naturally to them (and which are harmless in the vast majority of AAA games) to avoid breaking the game.
---
Because you people are nuts and it's entertaining
---
honestly the people bitching about the people leaving are far more annoying. 
---
If you can't find those Nuka Cola grenade recipes:
---
Go on FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar reddits.  People keep the plans and sell them to other players.
---
You'll have to pay some caps, but you can get the recipe fairly quickly.
---
I can‚Äôt even log in normally. I have to run command prompt in administrator mode because fallout 76 thinks I have a proxy set up and the only way I can login is if I type netsh winhttp reset proxy ever single time I want to login üòÇ like what the hell bethesda fix your game 
---
It took me a while last night to figure out this was exactly what was going on. Said I needed gears for something and when I check I have literally 100 of them tied up in bulk.
---
No. The majority have finally seen that this isn't going to get better. 
---
Bethesda, unpaid amateurs want to make their own video game with your extremely expensive IP and code! They basically want to do your job for you! Why don't you all give up your paychecks to the Council of Reddit Fallout Elders! 
---
If you're looking to 'In my day we had to walk uphill both ways to be beaten by the headmaster and we thanked him for it' to justify still playing a game you're probably in denial.
---
I‚Äôve being enjoying the game. I just wish there were private servers therefor mods, and hopefully console commands, so I can make it more of my own Fallout, just like the past games. I mean, I can‚Äôt play any other Fallout game without at least 5-10 mods these days. I‚Äôve tried, but there‚Äôs just a bunch of stuff I don‚Äôt like about vanilla Fallout that mods solve for me.
---
very cool. take a downvote
---
1. What platform are you playing on? XboxOne  
---
2. Gamertag/PSN/Bethesda.net account blinkandyurdead
---
3) Videos/screenshots of the issue (if applicable) NA
---
4) Description of the issue (what happened, where did it occur, what did it affect, quest name etc.) 
---
Powering up Poseidon  
---
1. On the roof all enemies were floating above my head in the sky and were going up and down.  
---
2. around the control room many enemies were mostly headless (the ones that were not completely headless the head was slightly visible but was not resolved - looked like static on an old TV.  
---
3. In one of the cooling towers maybe 30% of the surfaces would not resolve the entire time I was in there about 10 mins total.  This was happening during two separate sessions with a logout in between.  So, might have been separate servers.
---
4. In the hallway be the reactor room during one session I was getting swarmed by invisible enemies and could not see or interact with them in any way.  They were able to inflict damage to me.
---
5. Not sure if this is a bug or not but at one point i died in the control room and re-spawned out in the road.  This does not seem like intended gameplay.  Maybe re-spawning somewhere else in the building so I need to find my way back would make sense but thats excessive to be outside the environment on the very edge of such a large internal event zone.  I wasn't able to even get back to my place before the even timer ended.  Seems broken and un-balanced.
---
5) Bethesda Customer Support Ticket Number (if applicable) NA
---
No one's playing 760 already and not balls deep in a gallon jug pissing when they want. 760 hours is some kid trying to swing big dick on reddit. 
---
Thats what I thought yesterday, but the more time goes by, the more worried I get. Just goes to show how annoying rumors can be. They start to get to you.
---
Leave a hole in the floor and build walls in the ground to fence it off. Might take some time to find a good spot which works though.
---
So they changed the radworms disease to boost your mutations while active and that works 100% but when you recover from that disease your mutations no longer work until you get radworms again. I'm not sure if relogging helps but yeah that's the general issue.
---
Nope. It's the notes to the hotfix, which is what this thread is based on.
---
Sounds about right
---
That's it? Lol üòÇ
---
You can't deny reddit promotes a sheep mentality, the entire system is designed that way with up/downvotes and "hot" / "rising" / "top" sorts. That's why that same majority was censoring criticism the entire time the game has been out by downvoting / removing posts criticizing the game. Now that the majority finally agrees with the critics, instead of hating on them, it's "fine" to post criticism here. Irony. 
---
Lol sounds like you‚Äôre trying to dictate how he should feel
---
Lol all this fear mongering thanks for posting
---
Yeah because you know it's a feeling where e can be left out.
---
How long should the game be down for?
---
Confirmed. stuff doubled when I got Rad worms.
---
_I mean technically you didn't provide any evidence in your rebuttal of OP's post_. Yes, people are leaving, but doesn't that mean that the number of people whining is going down?
---
Bethesda designed a game with inventory limitations.
---
Mules are clearly an attempt to circumvent that development choice.
---
To me, this is common sense.
---
If it‚Äôs good, however I won‚Äôt pre order it
---
I haven't laughed harder than when I heard that the nuke codes didn't work past 2018 since they didn't account for it in the code. this game has been broken from launch and needs to be completed without trying to keep the current version hobbling along. trying to develop a game post launch needs to be punished with an angry community.
---
While you're entirely right, this is the one that hits home the most for me:
---
&gt;  I think the Whitesprings farm itself is a symptom of a deeply flawed game so I can‚Äôt really blame players for cheesing it or ‚Äústealing‚Äù kills.
---
You can't fault people for walking through a door that you left open.  Bethesda has no room to be annoyed at those players.  People are gonna do what people are gonna do.  As a player, I can still be annoyed by it when I have to adjust my play to someone trying to steal my lunch!  I don't think all of the cheesers are trying to stop the spawner from getting paid, too, but the system can't force those people to be courteous.  They can take XP/legendaries and don't need to consider if they stop someone else from getting any so they do exactly that.  I don't like that playstyle at all.  I think we're all in this together and prefer it when we try not to step on each others' toes.
---
As for the min/maxing, people are wild about that stuff! I'm so impressed at what they come up with but goddang, my brain doesn't work like that.  I intentionally play this game to slow down, just chill out and walk around in the wasteland.
---
I'm so jaded, I don't think I expected to see eye to eye on so much with you.  I think my conclusions are a little different but we're definitely reading the same book. Cheers!
---
Those who do not shoot her in the air are not helping. 
---
Surveys would be a lot more useful during BETA testing and prerelease.
---
The problem is this game came out of the gate without balance and everything they're doing now comes across like a blind person trying to play darts.
---
What was your suggestion for the TSE rebalance?  My main is a non-AP using sneaky sniper build and I feel like the entire build was completely gutted by the nerf.  Seriously my guy already did a quarter of the damage of a decked out melee build and they just reduced that to 1/16  it feels like.  
---
I'd love to know what options were out there that might not have completely gutted my build
---
Because when you have an enemy like the scorchbeast queen to fight and half of the server is mind their own, you need to pack some serious firepower
---
260 hours is a long time you know. They could crank something out in 100. They could crank something out in 0 hours if they went and grabbed the last version from the repository.
---
You beat me to it
---
Nah. Those posts are just from the cheaters crying wolf after getting banned. If they can't build a black market business off of this game, they are going to try to kill it.
---
I guess.
---
It's a step in the right direction for sure but they need to c ok ntinue to be proactive in bug fix.
---
At least make it a three rank card, if you're going to compare it to other three rank damage cards.
---
But they ignore the other bugs created from last patch, like login and pipboy bugs? 
---
Yeah, this hotfix is still lacking. 
---
Don't open your pipboys everyone for fear of freezing on every log in! 
---
But this certainly doesn't deserve a hotfix! /s
---
Both provided 100% damage bonuses and are treated the same.
---
You assume that.
---
I feel you.  We pre-ordered three copies for the house so we could play together... then the price dropped.  
---
Our duel may never happen for I am on Xbox
---
Dude, people disagreeing with you about whether the game is good aren't discrediting you or disregarding your *feelings*. People who like the game have the right to voice that feeling as well. You need to stop taking what a couple idiots say and applying it to everyone who likes the game. The guy you replied to is losing his MIND that I said Bethesda is a studio made up of people who genuinely wants to make good things, and make games because they love to make games. Saying they're waiting for people to forget so they can stealth in microtransactions‚Äîwhat? Bethesda is not making a pay to win game. It's just so much screaming and negativity. It would be like if I went on the Pokemon subreddit every day with a mile long post about how I hate Pokemon. It bums everyone out.
---
&gt;At some point, you need to give players something to keep them interested
---
That's what they think they're doing with all the nerfs. Make the game "harder" and retain players longer.
---
Lol! Thats where my base is! Ive moved a bunch of times but always end up going back to that exact spot!
---
Any chance a future update can include  Schematics/recipes unlocked for legendary quest items we already earned and may have had to break down for stash limitations.
---
Examples: black diamond/ pyrolyzer /bunker buster/ daisy cutter/all rise/perfect storm/ exc
---
Even if we can only recreate it at level cap in which we earned it originally.
---
 I think it's important, being were not able to run the quests again to re earn the item, and being upcoming PVP balancing patches may make such weapons more viable. 
---
OMG they added fixes to their broken ass game...yay.
---
Why should they apologize? Because they are actively trying to fix bugs, watch and respond to user feedback, rebalancing perks, stopping people from overloading servers from duping? Or because you feel the need to be a cynical ass hat and not see the work they are putting into this game?
---
The hotfix they are applying right now should fix this so you can also wait and see if you don't want to scrap your bulk.
---
You sound like you have a hard case of ‚Äúthe maths‚Äù 
---
When you play the game, do you just see numbers? 
---
No offensive if you have one of those heavy maths brain. 
---
So no one was complaining about those things?
---
What about the Rad worms boosting the effect of anything in the player effects screen by 50%? Really not gonna hotfix that one lol?? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Don't forget the canvas bag.
---
Does the rest of Bethesda live in Aus as well? 
---
Not on when customers using an international service have to wait for 1 guy to wake up is it really ;)
---
Can we at least get some confirmation on the bans people are reporting for crafting to quickly? Is it safe to craft or are we going to get banned? 
---
Please and thank you
---
message me your IGN, I uninstalled the game but later tonight or tomorrow I might reinstall just to give you the stuff and prove the point people are quitting
---
\ *cry-baby wall o'text
---
Ain't nobody got time to read all that shit.
---
MY DRILL IS THE DRILL THAT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS!
---
Yes and might be slightly more playable than an hour ago.
---
it's not like they planned on the players picking up some of the slack that the lack of human NPC's caused. Without other players what makes this game better than FO4?
---
&gt;in
---
The player counts, even without stats are decreasing. This has been noted on many posts here and the number of nukes has dropped significantly as well in my experience.
---
I'm one of the people who enjoy the game even with its flaws.  
---
But goddamn do I really loathe Bethesda for everything. The way they've been handling marketing of the game and everything else (the canvas bags, ffs) is really loathsome and I don't want Bethesda to continue doing things like this. I paid 80‚Ç¨ for the Tricentennial edition and enjoyment-wise I do not regret my decision. But I do feel bad for supporting Bethesda in this adventure of theirs. Especially knowing I could get the game for like 40% of the price I paid for it. I haven't touched the game in a couple of weeks and I will not touch it until I hear Bethesda making actual good decisions and solving their problems.
---
Oh I know and I've used it before. It's fun 
---
Okay.
---
Nothing about weapon durability, nothing about mutations not working. BTW is the dupping back?
---
Well it is literally 7 in the morning right now, his not even on working hours.
---
I'm near whitesprings and for some reason the game counts the ground bear my base as water so all my purifiers are just chilling in the ground
---
Cool, they can just let me "borrow" a 3* rifle until they back!
---
I understand that they wanted to make them into containers but they could atleast make it so all the Cap stashes spawn and you can search them 80% of the time or something. Since this patch, i feel like i wasted 8 perk Points.(Cap collector/Demolition expert) 
---
You can place things on camp fires or on the very edges of tiles. 
---
But nothing on shelves.
---
They will fix it, but bobbypins will now weigh 10 pounds a pin....
---
hahahaha the $ you posted are the delux additons. at gamestop and on the dashboard its 15-20$ right now......no its not even close to the top 10 most played. rd2 even call of duty games like that bro are more played you posted false shit and no its not 2nd highest rated the average score is a 2/10 user and all reviews a 4.10 or lower
---
This is the most entitled thing I've read to date. Jesus christ...
---
If anyone can bitch about the game it's me.  I played my first character for 6 weeks straight and then a bug with taming animals reduced my budget to 0.  After that I couldn't even build a stash.  It's still like that today, unfixed, broken!!!  But you know what, I had a great time that 6 weeks, and I got up, dusty off my big boy pants and started a new character.  The new character is a unique build and I'm enjoying myself.  
---
I feel playing this game now is not mandatory 
---
&gt;addressed 
---
Not "fixed," or "reversed."
---
I definitely agree it needs improvement, I just still enjoy it (the only game i can play co-op with my brother who lives long distance). I recently lost all my best legendaries trying to transfer them between characters (no shared stash ftw), also he has a lot less free time to play so items to share are always welcome :) Just wouldnt want cool stuff to go unused if people are quitting for good.
---
I‚Äôve had a lot of disconnects and times where the game just doesn‚Äôt work. Oh, and I‚Äôve had such long arms my pip-boy screen is too small.
---
But I‚Äôm just taking my time and enjoying things. 76 hours, level 35, still happy :)
---
LOL, I was just on the ball I guess.
---
There is nothing but junk in there however if there was a way to get into the room, there's a way to get to the X-01. I didn't want to find out and get back to, so I'm letting others try, maybe they'll succeed, and Bethesda will patch it. My point for posting it is so it will be patched.
---
Lol. I've had so much fun and watching this shitshow. 
---
The point is that whoever is making the decisions has made bad ones after bad ones. What company keeps you on when you fail at your job for months in a row? Hell, youd even be fired from mcdonalds for failing to do your job for months. With what project managers are paid it is inexcusabke. 
---
What level are you?
---
Lonely, as is the life of a hero and villain.
---
My legendary tse bobbypin is OP
---
That sucks! Sorry you had a bad experience but keep rebuilding, make your camp look so good they can't bring themselves to grief you 
---
Doing anything doesn't help anyone... in this regards.. Unless one of you is going to take a major loan and make a better game....
---
Otherwise ya'll just doing what everyone else does.  Posing opinions. Yelling at each other. Agreeing with each other. Being human. You know... the stuff you hate being told you're doing.
---
The damage isnt hateful, its gonna be 600+.
---
Done.  I ordered him a pound.  There are 300 in a pound which I reminded him of!!  
---
They get there Monday! 
---
Lol nice, ya this game really needs new content wether it be new vaults or thicc bosses.
---
PvP  Survival Mode sounds great but most of the community enjoys playing together &amp; finding new things to fight/explore.
---
You can‚Äôt always get what you want, so taking a break &amp; playing new games will be the only option.
---
I‚Äôm not giving up on you Bethesda, Fallout 76 is great &amp; I met lotz of cool people in-game and Reddit Fallout Network Discord. 
---
Once Anthen comes out, I‚Äôm going to taking my grinding there. 
---
However, I still will hop on time to time to sell to vendors to make my 1,400 caps, Camden Park Daily, and maybe nuke a queen or 2.
---
"Investigating". 
---
Just ready the post by u/despotak. 
---
He did the work of your devs for you! 
---
Hotfix? 
---
Bloodied weapons don't do over 2000 damage.
---
Bloodied unarmed weapons, with 5 pieces of unyielding armor, max iron fist, max radicool, max nerd rage, twisted muscles, talons, adrenal reactions (gonna need that max class freak thrown in), plus alcohol, fury, deathclaw steaks, and glowing steaks might do 2000... But only if you can get to melee while running around radiated down to only like 40 hit points. And basically your whole build is worthless in a nuke zone.
---
Have you ever played an bloodied build? Or fight against one? Or are you just upset because you saw a screen shot or someone's claw and it had a higher damage number than you now?
---
The PvP mode simply removes the restrictions. It's up to us not to turn on each other. If we do, then it's on our heads, not the Devs. You can always stick with adventure mode
---
you guys complained too much about the bobby pins hahaha
---
im really hoping that stability and performance is implied, because that last patch was an immense step backwards.
---
I like those things, but the negatives now far outweigh them.  Moving on to other less frustrating games.
---
You do not have to buy two of anything. You can share games with ONE other Playstation so whichever is the main system make sure they buy all the games. [here's how](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-share-games-on-ps4-2018-easy-guide/amp/) 
---
That way all you have to do it buy a game, start the download, go to your wife's system, log in as you, start the download, then she can log in and the game will be on her screen. üòÅ BEST THING EVER. You can log into Bethesda accounts/battle net accounts in game as asked.
---
Yep. I'm taking it slow rather than poopsocking my way to the meta's "endgame" and it's been a lot of fun.
---
From the community patch notes that mined the update, it appears they fixed radworms by having the disease increase all "spell effects" by 50 percent. Unfortunately (or fortunately for those of us who like the boost), a lot of things are treated as spell effects, not just rad damage.
---
Wow this a really reasonable post that this sub needs. At the moment this sub feels like r/fallout. Remember how we tried to shield ourselves from that place?
---
We are a small number of players. The only reason we get so much attention from Bethesda is because we are on reddit, and reddit seems to have an above average influence on the rest of the internet. I see mainstream gaming news sites every day with new articles and their source being reddit. Youtubers, who we mostly dislike for their drama often link to reddit posts or comments as their source. If this wasnt the case, Bethesda wouldnt care about us hardcore fans. We dont represent the majority. We are the nutjobs on the extreme end.
---
so instead of linking the patch notes on this post you link it in you're video description in order to try to get people to go on you're video. scum
---
That's too funny.
---
Or a cap to the dr so she can be damaged.
---
Well, Bethesda chose not to release any stats and not release on Steam so those stats aren't available.
---
There are PS4 stats that show the number of active players is probably very low  (regardless of sales figures).
---
I have just troubleshooters one and i love, that lite extra damage mostly instantly breaks bots limbs and they die very fast now. 
---
People want to keep Bethesda on the fire for this mess of the game because it‚Äôs a way of drawing a line in the sand for the gamining industry as a whole. It is similar (but smaller scale) to the Star Wars Battlefront controversy with their microtransactions. These companies will try to stretch their name as far as they can to put out quick cash machines or load up micro transactions. Then the fans raise PR hell to show that practices won‚Äôt just hurt sales, but will hurt reputation as well. 
---
It's not working like last patch. I get detected a lot more.
---
add another one
---
I might reinstall but only temporarily to give some stuff away but its off for now
---
Heavy guns, yes please!
---
I appreciate what you're saying, and there's a good chance you're very right to blame management for a lot of the problems with Fo76, both pre and post release.
---
But this post has a LOT of assumption in it, including that their developers are as ethical and quality focused as you are. Unless you're a developer from Bethesda working on 76, it's hard to say this with any kind of certainty.
---
Errors happen in programming all the time, with large scale multiplayer games sometimes you need a community to kick the shit out of your game to find such issues. You can keep laughing about dumb shit though, thats obviously the best way to support a game that was open about needing community help from the beginning. 
---
No, but changing Demolition Expert to a three rank card now that it gives the same buff as the other three rank cards would be nice.
---
It's not even that. It's a blog post where they mention, offhand, something that is being patched but don't actually say what or how. Until/unless they actually post the hotfix patch notes we don't know what's in it. Just that the three things you listed are planned to be included because they were the most talked about issues.
---
Freedom isn‚Äôt freeee!!!
---
Made my chuckle.
---
Each of those was a 100% damage buff with barely any downside. Its was too much. 25% is still strong.
---
&gt;Some players clearly want a game where they run around, killing everything and never having to die
---
I really think this is the case here, it fits with the whole TSE debacle, these *kids* at least that's what they are acting like are playing Fallout 76 like COD.
---
Ok, what? 
---
I'm stating that playing a game for 200+ hours makes that game a good deal, whether you paid $60 or $40. If you have over 1000 hours, that just backs up my words even more. 
---
1000 is a really really really really good deal.  
---
I think he means that Bethesda "needs to be held accountable for what *they're not* doing".
---
To which I agree.
---
Still can't believe the only content we've got in 3 months is the Legendary Hunting Rifle which was not dropping due to a bug...
---
Can't tell if people who defend this game and pretend it's perfect and delusional or just trying to justify a bad purchase decision.
---
It's one thing to acknowledge its issues but still love it, it's wholly different to pretend like those issues don't exist and everyone who dislikes it is a "hater". 
---
The simple answer is that a majority of players simply do not want to participate in PVP.  They don't want to damage other players, they don't want to be damaged by other players, and they don't want their camp busted up.
---
"We didn't want players to feel as though X was mandatory, so we made X a piece of shit." said every bad designer ever. 
---
I always defend this game, but i had SO MANY problems last months...
---
Yes melee is basicaly a guaranteed 1shot
---
How do you join a faction in 76?
---
And what would you even do? 20 people standing around saluting each other?
---
They were never not listening, just because things didn't happen when people wanted them or how people wanted them to happen doesn't mean they were ignoring things.
---
If you haven't done it yet, I'll help when the servers are back up. Gt: beakflats
---
I think your key may be sticky or there's some latency issue in the server.
---
No I'm not
---
It's around 20 to 30 seconds of an inanimate character before you actually load in, see it all the time as people spawn in areas, they are stood like  idiots getting spanked and they don't even know it :-)
---
facts.
---
No fast travel in survival servers!
---
No legendaries would be interesting too.
---
Yes. Do this! 
---
You know what to do when someone is trying to melee you? You run away.
---
It's the plague of issues from FO4 that mainly put me off. I'm not down for dropping money on something that broken since before day one. And the way the company had handled everything from deleting reviews/comments/posts and addressing the fans that spent a buttload of cash on the PA edition, that really put me off
---
Two words... Creation Club... 
---
updates
---
The hotfix is only around 1gb, just how slow is your connection?
---
A true American hero 
---
I have other useful perks and other legendaries. I just prefered TSE over any other legendary effect i was in possesion of. And to first be a shotgun cqc build and then mid way switch to rifleman &amp; demoltion perk deck is annoying and tedious because when i needed to make the switch i was at 50 so i had to keep levelling to do a ton of rearranging of perk points and cards
---
Honestly? This shit should have been sorted pre-launch. 
---
A meager hotfix is better than nothing, but so is a turd sandwich....
---
They could always test patches. Or have management do their job of overseeing.
---
The Bethesda art of recycling assets :/
---
They haven't had an original thought since 2003.
---
25 currently. I don‚Äôt have much time to play but the time I have played has been pretty enjoyable
---
Is it almost worth coming back to yet?  I have been playing Yee Haa GTA (RDR2) for a while now and keeping an eye on this page. 
---
its the "look at me" generation
---
"This game is shit now that I cant one shot people with or without them accepting the fight with my 550 damage shotgun and 200+bobbleheads! REEEEEEEEE!!"
---
BRAVO!
---
&gt;more balanced approach
---
What they're doing makes sense. They're adding grind. On Purpose.
---
(Eye roll) 
---
Nearly 400 hours here. 1) I start with a quick fast travel around the vendors to get my daily caps. Doesn't take long. 2) I do a bit of exploring around areas I'm not so familiar with (*often change guns and outfit first, as I get bored of looking the same for more than a couple of days*) and stash stuff to sell for tomorrow. While I'm doing that there might be 3) an event I especially like or 4) a nuke on prime. 5) last 2 days I've been doing the treasure maps that I've saved up over all 400 hours. Taken ages but I'm getting through it. 6) I build my CAMP or move it somewhere new for a change. It's a church in cranberry bog right now. I'm thinking about making a prison next or a big run down warehouse somewhere. Possibly with lead extractor. 7) I don't chase atoms but have thought I should do some more daily challenges to save up for stuff. Haven't got onto that yet.
---
I've not even visited all the map markers. Have some left around the centre. I still need to finish some side quests too. Oh and I really should restart because I rushed some missions to get one of the vendors. I'd like to actually *read* all the terminals and notes 
---
Found the fo76 developer.
---
I haven't played it in a long time, but I remember my first impression. How many headshots does an end game human take to kill with a typical SMG now? 
---
I won't buy the $20 skin, and if nobody else does then they won't offer them at that price because they won't recoup the costs to draw and model them. I'm fine with microtransactions added after launch for cosmetic items that don't affect gameplay. 
---
As far as I know, nobody has said that every cosmetic in Anthem costs $20, right? Honestly, I think that approach is better than loot boxes that will cost on average way more money with no guarantee of getting the cosmetic you want.
---
[Everyone, please fill one of these out before you leave.](https://i.imgur.com/ImUeFY5.png)
---
That is poor logic on your part. In an RPG game where we create and design our build towards our play style. Which is what help made Fallout and Elder Scrolls popular games.
---
Your now telling me. I have to play certain way because Bethesda or You day so? See that‚Äôs the heart of the problem you it intelligent enough to see.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure a melee user with 5x your gun damage is helping a lot more than you think
---
Who is "we"? This subreddit has many of the same mods as /r/fallout.
---
So you can actually get a TS or an E mod by scrapping??
---
Every game needs updates and patches, I‚Äôve been just as critical of Bethesda with their handling of this game as everyone else but they get credit for attempting to fix it, hell new Vegas was broken on launch and it‚Äôs still almost unplayable on consoles. No games ship 1000% flawless
---
It's at whitesprings isn't it 
---
Again, my furious faster firing Gatling gun works juuuuust fine against the Queen.
---
These outrageous numbers were not necessary and not healthy for the game.
---
I didn't list anything, I'm not the op. I simply linked him to the most recent info that Bethesda had released. That being the notes/explanation of the hotfix and bugs caused by this recent patch. The first 3 of which they state are planned to be in this upcoming hotfix.
---
&gt;Im in no way a modder or know anything about mods
---
For explosive I would agree, two shot not so much. But hey we are all entitled to our opinions. 
---
Did this yesterday and reinstalled fo4. Had a blast with it because IT WORKS!!!
---
What message does that send?
---
Vague term? Thanks for admitting you didn‚Äôt read, or that comprehension isn‚Äôt your strong suit. No matter. You‚Äôve bored me
---
I didn‚Äôt whine, I made a statement and offered numerous other points. You had a sentence
---
Your voice matters as much as everyone else. Sure. And you‚Äôll see exactly how much when you learn how the real world works. 
---
Until then, please don‚Äôt waste my time trying to feel important. Cause theres nothing you can do to stop it. Nothing. 
---
Haha! No worries. I‚Äôll send you some photos this evening when I‚Äôm home :) or invite you over if you‚Äôre on the PS4
---
Why does everyone wanna kill every creature so fast? Like won‚Äôt combat get boring killing everything with one or two shots? I can only speak for myself but I enjoy having a 1-2 minute long battle with a level 60+ super mutant or mutants. I love strafing and juking around an enemy while hearing the sound of gunfire.  Maybe its just me.
---
I‚Äôm hoping they do this in the future.  Or maybe the developers could actually play their own game too
---
That's beautiful
---
&gt;Shut up and stop posting on a public message board about things I don't like.
---
ProTip: Go and petition the mods to make this a banned topic or suck it up.
---
Ran into this to, was firing at a Mr. Gutsy, got him down to 15% (give or take) then i saw his health bar go back to full health, while aiming at him. 
---
I think hotfixes need to be below a download size to be accepted as a hotfix thats why they tackled only three bugs this hotfix 
---
You're leaving\*
---
And we don't give a fuck that you don't care.
---
Ot just fucking go?
---
Fucking lol. I might just take a month off from this game and wait for them to sort it out once and for all.
---
Just like all of these other posts, OP is full of shit. He *literally* admitted to duping in *this* post.
---
I believe that you only crafted a few gamma guns recently, but you're leaving out the part where you actually did what you're being accused of.
---
Good riddance. I hope your ban is permanent.
---
&gt;mer
---
Yes, the scorchbeasts landing patterns are very reliable.
---
I feel like that goes both ways. The community is eating itself over this. The same people writing emotional thought pieces like this while claiming objectivity are also the same ones demanding anyone stop playing/enjoying the game by saying anything other than outrage is "encouraging" bethedsa. Demanding that their view of the game as being uttlerly fubar and unenjoyable is the standard of the "vast majority".
---
I get that it highly disappointed folk. It did. I get that it has lots of flaws. It does. But dont pretend there is some overwhelming quantity of gamers beating up on the complainers and wearing rose colored glasses. Thats absolutely not true. Let people enjoy what they want, or otherwise. 
---
oof
---
Lol you put 3 points into luck just for cap collector? Perk swap dude perk swap
---
There is a very detailed post about it earlier. Guy was a serious modder for FO4 and found the likely cause.
---
Effect with no limiter, daisy chains the effect through every player/hostile player/ NPC in increasing range until it crashes.
---
Really?  Really?
---
My main is a 170 Melee.  To get an optimal build in melee I only have 3 points in perception.  With those 3 points in perception I can get a max of +30% ranged damage.  That's it.  No other ranged buffs.  I have a gauss rifle for backup that takes 20-30 or more solid hits and some headshots to get a level 50 scorchbeast down.  Shooting the queen is just wasting ammo and doing pitiful damage.
---
How about you quit hiding in the fort and next to trees?  She'll land more and I can actually do some damage.
---
On a side note, I didn't hear any "thank you" for the scorched mobs I'm putting down while you're busy shooting the queen.
---
Sincerely, 
---
The Melee Folks that carry you in queen fights.
---
 We get it your mad
---
No one gives a fuck . you like the game ? Ok ? Why do we need to  see your lack of reasons for staying ? We get it you like a game? Ok. We  really don't care just stay lmao we don't need your rant on,why you  decided to play 76. 
---
Well, radworms have been giving major buffs the last couple of days so there's been some ghoul hugging going on.
---
IF YOUR LEAVING THAN WHY IN THE FUCK ARE YOU STILL HERE ?
---
I appreciate you actually responding, I don't hate the game or the idea of it I just wish they waited because it can be so much better then it is now. I'll probably play it in a year when it has end game content
---
This info doesn‚Äôt match the amount of damage you say you do.  If it Issa you say, it should be close to what my build is and I‚Äôm not getting base damages over 400. I have a 50% armor reduction powerfist at about 300-350 base no buffs (except mutations) and at unyeilding half health it‚Äôs at about 450.
---
What‚Äôs your most used weapon base damage?
---
The only difference I can tell is the ultracite, now I decided I don‚Äôt want to do ultracite or any power armor at all so I‚Äôm not sure if that matters for damage.
---
Look I‚Äôm just going to block you. You don‚Äôt seem to understand the deeper metas of the game. You also seem slightly unintelligent. What Flawed Logic. Of course your going to try to run away..but you do have Seatlh builds and boys and mods for PA.. 
---
Now we get to find out who never really cared about Bobby pin weight
---
Blah blah blah cry cry cry Il do what i want with my money 
---
\-TOP- tier?  No....  
---
You can craft Epics to get you a foothold into raids though.  That's a huge part of the WoW crafting system.  Plus specializing in one area you can craft things that are useful to all players which can be sold at the AH  
---
And (in WoW) if you're looking for a particular weapon to round out your stats, you don't have to go do a loop in the same city for hours on end, you know which raid drops the one you're hoping for.  Sure it's still a little grindy and may take months of the same raid, but it's not the same as grinding from a loot table of THOUSANDS in the same spot for hours upon days upon weeks in the same spot.  (Plus you're not competing to just tag the target like fo76 where you have to run around very fast so that the other guy doesn't one-shot all the good loot mobs)  
---
In other words, sure you don't craft -TOP- level, but they at least have a crafting system where continuing to craft is useful... nay, necessary to your character build.
---
No, because they are actively messing up.  Time and time again they are dropping the ball and are so tone deaf to what the community wants and what should be fixed.   Never in my life have I seen such incompetence from a AAA studio. 
---
There is no excuse for the last patch.  It is utter failure of basic development to merge an older branch.  How am I being cynical when they have proven so far that they have no idea how to manage this project. 
---
3 months in and they are only talking of having a roadmap.  What project in this day in age doesn't have a roadmap defined?    
---

No game ships flawless?  ........ I made  a youtube resposne https://youtu.be/MSRCoAgpQ3g ok i'm done meming
---
I'm mad because I know you'd beat me in the wasteland. I'm even madder because you'd deserve to. I'm upvoting but I've got my eye on you!
---
Seriously though, I respect the work you put in and appreciate you sharing it. It didn't occur to me to calculate it myself. I got better at Fallout by reading this. That's the good stuff. Thanks a lot!
---
YOU'RE LEAVING\*
---
^ please refer to the post you commented on 
---
&gt; We know the balance changes we made to these cards have caused some **frustrations**.  
---
Things being frustrating for some players is the exact justification you used to nerf TSE's.  
---
So by your own logic you should've never made these changes, since they're causing frustration?  
---
Sounds like a poor argument made by people who have no idea what their own game should be.  
---
Do you want a PvP game where every weapon is equally competetive? Is that the goal here?  
---
Do all perks need to be equal? Because your own arguments about "mandatory" perks don't make any sense when you have perks that are literally required.  
---
What exactly is Fallout 76 supposed to be? Seriously, because these changes make no sense from either a PvE cooperative experience, nor a PvP experience.  
---
And how could it possibly take any amount of time to make a "Known issues" post? Have Bethesda never heard of "Edit"? It's possible to add or remove items from the list over time...  
---
What exactly are we waiting for here? Do you not already have a list internally of known issues? Are you just winging it every patch?
---
&gt;this is the exact kind of game that is designed to keep people hooked and pumping in hundreds of hours every month.
---
Nope. It's designed for the normal people who maybe play an hour or two a night a few times a week and maybe a few longer sessions sometimes on the weekends. Get a life, man.
---
Yes we can!
---
If destroying the hard work of low level players who are in no position to defend themselves "brings you the most joy", I feel bad for you.
---
Yes. You fucked up bad. I'm not even sure you deserve our forgiveness... Your actions from now will determine that. 
---
Yeah dude, I hope they get shit figured out. Taking a break myself. I‚Äôll check in here and there after big patches.
---
I've crashed here and there (right when trying to launch a nuke) and buddy being invisble are the only ones that irk me. Have a blast playing though! Can't wait for more stuff to do in here. Excited for it. 
---
I actually started a new fallout 4 vr game a bit ago, not because I‚Äôm upset with 76 but because I still haven‚Äôt managed to play it all the way through in vr. Made me realize how much I missed human NPCs instead of relying solely on reading and holotapes 
---
Thank you Bethesda for fixing the things you broke.
---
I hadn't heard that but I do get that, but not all so it's not like they are saying no.
---
Xbox one S

---
I heard about the hot fix but didn't see anything about why my ballistic wepons are breaking at an alarmingly faster rate. I repair my wepons to 200% condition with the perk card. And my wepons use to go for hours with out breaking. Now my wepons are breaking in about 20 mins. Yesterday went to west tek, watoga high school and roboco research center and using a different gun at each location the guns would break before I even finished clearing the location like i said in about 20 mins from maximum condition. And im using them the same amount as before the patch, so its not because im using them more. Im actually getting to use them less because they're breaking so fast. I stopped playing yesterday because of the frustration please look into this. 
---
better systems require bigger files
---
You only need 5, there's like 15 options. go to another.
---
In this analogy though, it was the cops who created the problem in the first place, then turned around and punished you for the inevitable consequences. It's like the cops leaving $1billion on the street so it gets stolen, then arresting someone else later because they found $20 of it in a field a week later.
---
However, I believe the negative reactions people in this forum are having towards Bethesda display a cumulative frustration toward the industry as a whole. 
---
Up until now, Bethesda seemed a last bastion of creativity--somewhat separate from the rest. this is no longer the case, sadly.
---
What we're witnessing here seems to be the denial phase of grief, as well as the progression into anger... and for many, acceptance.
---
It has nothing to do with not liking the game. It has to do with liking the game and wanting to play it but it just doesn't fucking work. 
---
Bethesda gives a fuck. Bethesda has stated they want feedback. Whining is feedback. The book of reasons is what they need to be reading.
---
God damn this should be elementary shit
---
Haha, the only explosive weapon I have is a laser rifle. 
---
I tried to make it work, but only firing 50 shots before it was broken, and the 20% damage nerf from grounded keeps it in my stash.
---
I came from Destiny, which has the same deal.
---
I built a 6x6 base and left 10 blocks empty in the center. Enclosed it all with walls and roof.
---
I have both crops( 3 types), water purif. And fusion generator.
---
I'm waiting for that player vendor update. I'm hoping it notifies the map via a marker that someone is actively vending in that spot. We'll see!
---
The fact that they added this just because players were careless should be received as a positive. They could have easily let it slide and told you to be more careful.
---
Bullet sponges aren't much fun either, especially when your weapons and armor break so easily.  
---
Just more grind for mats that you don't have room for in your stash so you can repair your armor and weapon so you can play the game where bullets do as much damage as spitwads....  not exactly entertaining
---
Damn now someone just needs to invent a way to cure diseases.
---
Sorry, my brain saw the blue "order of mysteries" and associated it with the blue "op of the thread".
---
well its time to come out of retirement, Bethesda Austin is hiring.
---
I hear they are making an exclusive Todd Howard Clone-a-Willy Just for people who pre-ordered the game.
---
Need a mint to get that taste out of your mouth?
---
Yes the word toxic is always always used vaguely and doesn't at all describe anything. That's why perpetually offended snowflakes like you use it all the time. Because it makes something sound worse than it is thus why nothing you said above holds any value whatsoever. We are getting our way. We win. There is nothing you can do to stop this.
---
It isnt worth it anymore and its going to take alot of point respeccing to get a new viable build to work with the weapons i have in my stash
---
I have had same issue's. 
---
Preach it brother. 
---
&gt;10lb bobby pins?
---
Throwing weapons are back baby!
---
I simply imagine the Purge, but the Fallout 76 version.
---
Then youtube clips of crying kids getting owned. 
---
It will attract the right people meant for this, and keep the PVE lovers in Adventure Mode.
---
My only problem is hackers somehow infiltrating &amp; abusing Survival Mode, but that‚Äôs up to Bethesda to monitor that.
---
How much difference do you think firing at her in the air is making? If you‚Äôre a melee build then you likely don‚Äôt have perk cards for guns that cripple enemies. If you don‚Äôt have those perks then what‚Äôs the point of firing at her in the air?
---
Heck if you have no gun dmg perks then the damage your dishing out to her while she‚Äôs in the air is almost certainly negligible as it is making little difference.
---
I'm glad hypotheticals cause this much anger.  I haven't, and don't plan on doing it.  I even said it's the worst thing to do... But go ahead, insult, down vote, get all that negativity out.  It's what I've come to expect from this subreddit community.  Regardless of how many of my posts are to help people.
---
it was locked because someone owned the power plant. lock picking it would be considered stealing and will make you wanted. be glad it didn't let u pick it
---
If they weigh 1 lb unperked, how did you get 6k in your box? Perks don't affect whats in the box.
---
Not sure why I got downvoted for pointing out a bug.  Someone is cranky.
---
Not really, but if you begin writing the companies they have to deal with such as Sony or Xbox you'll see much better response and be able to protect yourself and others more effectively both now and with future releases.
---
I ought to apply to be over the Creative Of Fallout76.
---
something late, this was due the next day after such a problem 
---
Dont give reasons why you want to leave a broken game but at the same time please fill out a form listing the reasons to why we are leaving. 
---
Ive seen some dumb shit in my day. 
---
If only people were this passionate about real world issues. 
---
STOP TRYING TO FIX THE GAME, IT ISN'T FIXED, WHICH MEANS YOU CANT FIX IT!
---
Caps lock is cruise control for awesome 
---
yup i feel the same.  unfortunately, lately i always seem to be out of fusion cores and have to run around without it.  i have the best armor i can craft and still get knocked around pretty badly.
---
Why are the servers down over a 1 gb update. Am I missing something?
---
kkona clap
---
No problem.
---
No imagination necessary. I just described two things that are actually in the game. Lol..
---
Got the game a few weeks back and I've been having a lot of fun, i really believe thar with good updates this could become a greate game, and I really hope that Bethesda knows that and are trying to improve the game. Good to know there are other people still having fun here! :)
---
Nah some don‚Äôt they want the game to fail and think it‚Äôs a failure they don‚Äôt want it to succeed or get better ever the want Bethesda to fail there always on this sub lurking 
---
yeah but back then it was at least a pretty hate machine.
---
I can agree with criticism , but when the posts are just "the game sucks im leaving " and when theres so many of them that you see nothing else it's just annoying , theres plenty of us that still play the game and wanna see what's going on, not that your leaving 
---
Have they upped his appearance in last patch? I've run in to him 3 times since. Thought he was just an urban legend before it.
---
it takes a while to manually carry the packets from the router to the console, damnit!
---
Is what a good weapon?
---
Are you talking about my QE (Quad Explosive)?
---
Or 
---
Are you reverting back to the ignorant everything is a (TSE) argument?
---
For the record my quad explosive radium Rifle does 63 DMG post nerf with 5 levels of perks dedicated to Demolition Expert..........NO IT IS NOT STILL A GOOD WEAPON!!!!!
---
Put Dodgy (AGI) perk on. Padded/Dense armor mod makes SBQ's explosion attacks insignificant. With Dense you take almost no damage.
---
They also had much less content in general. You spent the same $60 for a game you could clear in a few hours.
---
Don't buy into this. The OP definitely duped items and is simply using the mass gun crafting as a red herring. He admitted to it in this very post.
---
They get so many angry "I've uninstalled" customer support tickets that they have a canned, cut and paste response...
---
Greetings!
---
Thank you for contacting Bethesda Customer Support.  My name is Kimbely and I'd be happy to help you today!
---
I understand you were experiencing a number of different issues while playing Fallout 76 on your PC. I know this is incredibly frustrating so I'd like to thank you for your patience! It is my hope that someday you do return to the wastelands of Appalachia. I deeply apologize for any inconvenience and frustration this experience may have caused.
---
I am going to close this ticket, and set it to "SOLVED", but if you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us again. If you should ever decide to return to your adventures, we will be here ready and willing to help! Safe journeys vault dweller, wherever they may take you!

It‚Äôs more fun without PA imo. You could try all BOS vanguard Combat Armor and a diff perk loadout for ballistic and energy resistance higher than any power armor. Unyielding gives you insane specials and is great for bloodied builds. Rare sentinel and cavalier armors reduce damage while standing still or sprinting. Lots of different options! Experiment and see what you like. I will say though, Scorchbeasts melt me no matter what non-PA I wear, doesn‚Äôt seem realistic given the resistances.
---
Bethesda don't need to worry about being technically correct because the playerbase is dumb as a sack of hammers when it comes to development and programming. They can say whatever they like to downplay or straight up lie about a situation and most people will just lap it up.
---
There's a fine line with providing constructive criticism and just bashing the game without giving any ways to improve or even noting problems other than saying "game bad bethesda bad new vegas good lol"
---
I can't stop crying for all the people who bought duped TSE''s, its the only way they understand to play the game... YOU MONSTERS
---
That is not true. They have done hotfixes before which were done when the server was up.
---
Do you still wear your skins and carry a rock knife?
---
Doesn't mean they aren't giving you meaningless platitudes to shut you up. 
---
Ive done Scorched Earth several times IN A RAD SUIT with no defense outside my perks. I would really like to use my actual Legendary Armor that is far harder to obtain than Ultracite Power Armor for more effective and appealing for MY playstyle..
---
I‚Äôm not sure but I have found him more often now that you point it out 
---
Search for plans was taking a huuuuge part in my flowchart. There were mini stops at harpers, Camden‚Äôs, bunker, Watoga etc. I remember pushing myself consistently to check each vendor to before I decide to hop into a new server. 
---
If we can go by trophies, then currently 13.7% of players reached level 50. 7.2% of players won the scorched earth event.
---
If everyone of us on this subreddit is level 50 or higher, we represent less than 13% of players. And 93% of players havent killed the SBQ yet. So the people on this sub that cry for PvE content because theyve done everything, represent less than 7% of players. Most people still have a lot of PvE to do.
---
(This argument only works if the PS4 trophy stats can be used as reliable statistics.)
---
It's not download speed. Servers have been down an hour (so far) to apply the hotfix.  
---
Still, I agree, this is a silly thing to complain about.
---
Weight of Bobby pins
---
Considering how awful her loot is already, having one of those things she drops being *literally worthless* stings a little.
---
At least let us sell the plans to vendors for like 5 caps.

what a trainwreck of a game. I genuinely feel bad for you over this and I hope you'll somehow get your account back.
---
haha its the little things that can push us over the edge :)
---
It‚Äôs posts like this that I read this section.  I wish I could filter out all the whiners and read about good advice , tips, layouts , builds etc. 
---
Could someone just pool all the salt posters into one sub and leave this one for positive discussions ?
---
Unowned 
---
Ok. Thanks
---
Put dense mod on the torso. Vanguard set or bolstering if you have a bloodied wep
---
That would be a hell of a lot better than returning White Knight to its previous level.
---
You're wrong then. /S
---
Didn't change a thing for my melee dude. Still rocking WK+Lucky Break and don't have to repair.
---
They done several including today‚Äôs that weren‚Äôt.
---
Maybe they‚Äôre fixing the ‚Äúserver disconnected‚Äù problem?
---
Nah, just kidding 
---
I am 100% with you, those changes needed to be done. I was just pointing out the size difference.
---
I still don't understand why are we not just gathering configs from the server on launch. We could literally get updates to our game by reloading
---
When the criticism is based on false information (and much of it is not) or is not constructive, it is appropriate to point that out.  name calling and insulting 'criticism' has little value and though it may make someone feel better the volume of it can make finding constructive criticism difficult and the powers that be writing off this subreddit as having little to no value and look to other sources for sane customer feedback.
---
Errors totally happen. Do you know what every other industry on the planet does when it has made an error? They fix it. Often they are obligated contractually to fix their problems before even getting paid.
---
Bethesda has not released a game directly or through subsidiaries in the last decade that didnt come chock full of experience *ENDING* bugs. I'm talking save corruptions, broken main quests, DISAPEARING PROGRESS (in a shoot and loot. Jfc) and others bugs that have been solved by modders that bethesda managed to port across a dozen systems. 
---
As others have said, this game needed an extra year to debug. THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE SOLD THIS PRODUCT IN EVEN ITS CURRENT STATE. I dont get how this game was even released in its state. A minimum quality product should be at the very very least not a brand crushing disappointment. 
---
If Bethesda made software for commercial purposes would you ever buy one of their products if your business depended on said software? 
---
Not so! Instead of 10 bobby pins taking up a whopping 1 lb in my inventory, they take up .1 now! I can carry .9 lbs more of loot!
---
Gaaaaaaame changer!!
---
Yeah, a 60% damage perk for just 5 points is pretty fucked up. It should be 9 points for 60%.
---
With we I meant the people of r/fo76.
---
You sound more butthurt than the people leaving
---
In fact I dont want to spend hours at a crafting table running back and fourth from combat to camp. The way to keep me into a game is for me to stay in combat for long periods of time..
---
Stop jerking yourself off
---
Man, i almost bought this game a few weeks ago.. SUPER glad i havent after subbing here and reading up on it. 
---
Hopefully they get their heads out of their arse and fix it. Bethesda has always done a beautiful job on their games. Its a shame they dropped the bucket on this one. 
---
I... Think you may have been playing the wrong games.
---
"And if we don't get back inline, as punishment, the bobbypin weight will be reverted in future patches!" - Bethesda, maybe. 
---
Yawn.... it's a game. Just a game.  Those of you that have your panties in a bunch over not being able to clomp around the wasteland one shotting everything you come across any more just need to get over it. 
---
Seriously,  the anger from some of you upset people makes me wonder about the inadequacies of our mental health providers nationwide. 
---
I don't think we could get that lucky
---
I do know what you mean.... perv. Hahahaha. Wait, does admitting that make me just as guilty? Crap.
---
the concept of a hurt feelings report just r/whooosh-ed right over your head
---
What problem? I havent been checking the news on the game lately
---
That's what I was thinking. I figured now that they're containers, the runners and farmers won't be able to swoop in and take them all the time and they should always be there for me to grab once a day or whatever the timer is on.
---
Keep us updated OP :)
---
The crashes really suck the life out of you. Some of them have actually had me put the game down and not return for a few days and I'm a huge FO fanboy so I can only imagine how the casual players react.
---
For example, there's a quest in the Order of Mysteries questline where you need to find 5 notes, then you have to unlock a door to find another note and then finally hack a terminal. But each section isn't a separate quest marker so if your game crashes you have to start right from the beginning again. Twice I've got to the last bit - the terminal - and the game has crashed because the room is full of mutants. 
---
the latest update, the one today?
---
Did you read the new Behind the vault? They explained it wasn't a rollback, some (read SOME) of the code got mixed in with the new patch, come on dude be serious, is a bobby pin weighing a measly .09 lb more make any serious detriment to the gaming experience? ATM my char is at 190lbs with like 80 lbs free inventory and 20 in stash, and thats with a bunch of different weapons and junk that im hoarding and dont really use. Some bobby pins aint gonna make much difference in that. 
---
Yes, which makes it even worse because the red crosshairs disappear. Without aim you get four hash marks spaced VERY widely apart. With aim the four hash marks approach each other, but then disappear leaving you with no red aiming reticle, and the circular iron sight is way off to the left side.
---
He‚Äôs not concerned about people not listening to him. This post inevitably got overwhelming support because of how this game is a piece of shit on fire
---
Not all the red rockets look the same just FYI, look for some pilling pumps if you can see an actual RR, I will go and have a look now and update if I find it
---
LOL wtff, Fyre Festival had zero responsible factors.
---
You really hate Bethesda.
---
I get it, you bought the 200$ edition.
---
That really sux, and you deserve your money back. 
---
Xbox LFG posts and through friends lists so far. 
---
I suspect that it may become more mainstream soon. 
---
So either excess stock is being dumped OR the old easy dupe method(s) are back. 
---
I'll ask next time the deal is offered to me. 
---
That's kinda funny. Can I get one of these signed by Todd Howard? Will give a used copy of the game for that
---
So its entitlement because some players of the game are expressing opinions which are different to yours?
---
How does that work?
---
/u/Ladydevann Please bring attention to the Salvaged Assaultron Head bugs. 
---
When you first equip one the game loads all of your fusion cells into the left column. For any of the poor souls who have shot this weapon, this ment the loss of over 1000 or even 10000 fusion cells. You need to drop all your fusion cells for the weapon to load properly.... but then theres bug #2. 
---
Bug number 2 is just as bad, if you have for instance a Quad Salavaged Assaultron head, it can charge 20 TIMES!.. however  when used in or out of stealth it does 0 damage. I guess when you do over 2000 energy damage in 1 shot the game bugs out and thinks your cheating. 
---
Id love to use my Salvaged Assaultron heads one day. 
---
everything you wrote is wrong in other peoples opinion. why should i not reiterate my argument, its the argument im making. im not here to repeat your words to you. people who show up to the SBQ fight and stand around waiting for her to land are not helping.  
---
It‚Äôs not the same bug. That bug never impacted melee, and how OP described it isn‚Äôt even how it worked. I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs just server lag. 
---
I see your point, but at the end up the day it can (all be it probably in a very minor way) give players an advantage over another purchased with real money. 
---
No, i don't agree with that are all.
---
Two shot and explosive was so overpowering. Ppl should have distanced themselves from it knowing it was going to be nerfed.  
---
Not set the expectations on what that type of op gear provided.
---
And next to no one got them as drops.
---
I can give you any weapon you want with any stats on Xbox 
---
They can't ban you from a specific game due to how their accounts are made. Bethesda had to have their own crappy little launcher after all.
---
They nerfed more than they said they were going to, my Explosive Prime Stalker's .50 Cal shoots BB's now... It's used to do about 250+ Damage without any Bobbleheads or Magazine buffs....Now it only does a pitiful 117 Damage using .50 Cal Ultracite Rounds....One of the more time consuming and costly Ammo's to craft in the game.
---
Someone at Bethesda needs to be fired immediately, or atleast smacked in the face hard enough to chip some teeth.
---
Yep this game is shit and this sub is literally the only one to defend it with an iron fist. I don‚Äôt understand it. 
---
fyi it never ends
---
You must not know what toxic means then. My apologies. Ignorance is a choice. But not one I abide or suffer the fools of which indulge. 
---
You‚Äôre on the totally wrong road kiddo. You‚Äôre the offended snowflake and don‚Äôt even realized it. You got triggered by a post saying ‚Äúquit your bitching‚Äù and that means I‚Äôm offended when you are in fact bitching? What reality are you even from lol
---
You‚Äôre getting nothing but me laughing at you right now. And there‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop it. Nothing. Lol. Seriously. 
---
Screen shooting! Thank you 
---
Found the incel wearing his pip boy shirt
---
I like the way to speak. What‚Äôs your gamertag?
---
Dude, this is painfully accurate. It's even worse if you want to play something like ESO or RDR2. 100GB games are ridiculous.
---
photoshop is easy, sign it yourself.
---
Honestly I think it will do better than you expect. One of my friends had one, but without all the perks and his was 1400 before patch, 600 after. Let us know what it ends up being because Im curious.
---
TSEs are still the most powerful, if that's what you are wanting though....
---
Go easy on her. She is working her ass off. When your job is as difficult as hers (listening to and understanding all the complaints about issues which are not her fault, while at the same time, being powerless to fix them because of another incompetent department that refuses to do their job), and you have to say "I understand, I wish I could help more" a million times, you have to joke about it or you'll go insane. One of the two.
---
I complained about the canned response yesterday and its seeming emptiness, and she apologized. There is not much else she can do.
---
I am not defending Bethesda. Their development team has been phoning it in since BETA. But the community managers are not at fault. I have been in their shoes before - it's a hard, thankless job, and you aren't allowed to say, "you're right, the developers all suck at life, and their 'fixes' are a joke." You have to tow the line, apologize, and move on to the next complaint, or get fired.
---
Happens on PS4 too
---
I set up CAMP in a ‚Äúhigh traffic‚Äù area, with Super Mutants, Scorched and whatever randomly arriving. 
---
When I say ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù I mean there‚Äôs a 90% probability that a horde of one type or another will come close to killing me when I resume at my CAMP and can‚Äôt move
---
My workaround is to try to remember to don Power Armor before quitting 
---
I currently have 540 Def without PA . Going unarmed melee and im doing completely fine. PA feels too clumsy and stiff. Basically using it only for the Queen.
---
I'm glad I was able to give a few people a laugh.
---
Take a +1 internet point.
---
Enjoyed the read and another perspective.
---
I am 98 in game, and 50 IRL.  Yeah I am frustrated by some... many things, but the hate out there is crazy.. 
---
Unplug and go play another game for a while.  I been hopping over to BFV to get a change of pace when I am frustrated.
---
thanks for the post.
---
Every body keeps complaining how broken the game is but never give specific examples.  The game is what was expected if you were fallowing it pre launch.  Plus it was a very successful launch.  The vast majority of people have been able to log in and play with their friends.
---
Was it legendary? Legendary mobs regain health. It‚Äôs part of their deal. 
---
And one of the fixes is fucking bobbypins! 
---
Sure ,but remember to warn them that bethesda is banning people nowadays just for crafting a few weapons.
---
They kinda suck right now because of the nerf. 
---
&gt;*I can't think of one off the top of my head that has been as Rocky and meandering as this one*
---
I honestly don't understand how you can admit this and then basically tell people their complaints are full of shit.
---
This game is exemplary of *everything* seriously wrong with the current attitude of corporations in the video game industry. Literally everything. It is a low-effort title that was pushed out way ahead of reasonable deadlines with multiple layers of serious issues.
---
I'm the person who posted the stats about SBQ and how unrepresentative of the general population this subreddit it. And I still think that.
---
But I also think, opinions of everyone here aside (and let's be clear. I disagree with almost as many complaints as I agree with at this point), that the way this game has been and is being handled is *completely fucking unacceptable* and I think that anyone arguing against that point *is doing harm to the health of the video game community and industry as a whole.*
---
Holy shoot..
---
I don't see any thing about the mutation bug fixes in this patch note.  Does it mean it we'll mutations will be disabled whenever we recover from rad worms?
---
Its not my feelings. The amount of bad media and talk around the game is beyond staggering. It was literally a conversation multiple times in the early days of the game on this VERY SUBREDDIT. 
---
You are the one relying on feelings and ignorance and clearly got triggered by my comment.  
---
I'm not defending bethesda, but there's a few super rabid people on here that shoot the messenger, and it's very disappointing seeing that sort of behavior. 
---
Lmao I definitely understood the explosive nerf, but the two shot already having terrible accuracy, was what I thought evened that modifier out
---
Fair point
---
Enjoying a game and pissing your pants because many players are pissed about an unfinished game with outdated graphics and textures made on an outdated engine from the 90s aren't the same thing. 
---
People spent their hard earned money on a broken product by a company who used anti consumer bait and switch tactics and they have every right to post about their displeasure. 
---
You don't like it? Too bad.  
---
I‚Äôll probably just delete the character if I can‚Äôt drop them. I took the risk by being an accomplice to duping, so if I can‚Äôt fix it with the next broken patch, unfortunately I‚Äôll have to bite the bullet and delete the character.
---
I just want to run as fast as ghouls.  
---
You haven't learned to refund the game and stop playing though. And you haven't learned to stop buying Bethesda games and stop giving them your time of day. 
---
&gt;Even negative feedback shows Bethesda that you care.
---
But I do care?
---
I spoke to Todd, you can expect your check in the mail on February 30th
---
ur offer?
---
I haven‚Äôt had any issues with game. I‚Äôm playing it single player, so admittedly the story is a tad dry. But, as an overall experience, I‚Äôm having a great time.
---
I always wonder about the vast majority, and there is a slim chance that they are playing and enjoying the game, without spamming the two first page of reddit with rage.
---
Yes, they do screw major things up, but i still thankful they were brave to make it online despite they know they will get a lot of hate.
---
Thank you! Hopefully it does 
---
I agree they nurfed them too much but when you could one shot an enemy at rifle range with a tse pump then something was a bit broken.  Pvp as a whole needs to be rebalanced because the non player enemies tend to have higher health and DR then players but the weapons deal the same to both. Pvp needs to be rethought maybe have weapons have different values against players then the npc enemies.  
---
Just wanted to say that nerfing the two-shot explosive weapons was absolutely the right thing to do.   Legions of trolls have flown into a frothing rage ever since it happened,  but keep in mind these are probably the same people who go around wrecking peoples' bases and one-shot killing everything at uranium fever hogging all the XP and legendary loot. They are threatening to leave the game for the nerf. God, I hope they are serious.  They won't be missed. 
---
1.4k
---
Holy wild speculation and unconfirmed facts Batman!
---
Skyrim is still a top seller on Steam. I think they're fine.
---
Can we do this
---
Yeah im fine with the explosive nerf, its just the two shot nerf that makes 0 sense
---
I hate to break it to you but "No company honestly cares about how any of your feel".  the only reason they ask for your satisfaction is so they can fire people that screw up. 
---
Yeah, found out that by accident. Now I go out of PA to tank Scorchbeasts.
---
You also can just craft the lowest level version possible, as there doens't seem to be any real increase in chance at higher levels.  So they cost less materials.
---
That was, honestly, my first thought.  But that's why i asked :-)
---
Looks like it might be a latency introduced bug given that some others have had it happen to them as well.
---
I enjoy the hell out of the game, I did the stress test event and a lot of my worries went away. That being said I do recognize the flaws and bugs, but it‚Äôs also Bethesda so I take it with a grain of salt knowing that it‚Äôs never going to be perfect.  I tell anyone who hasn‚Äôt played it that says something negative to watch a video of it or try to play it if they can. Those who have played it, just wait and see what it‚Äôs like in a years time. It‚Äôs been a few months since it came out and evolving and will continue to be for a while. 
---
We're investigating reports of stealth issues. Can you guys comment and let me know what character level you are, your perks and armor?
---
Nicely done. :)
---
I don't think there's really any risk to doing something like you are doing. Likely the OP is seeing some issue related to being way over the weight limit, and/or the sheer number of items they could be creating with that volume of materials.
---
that‚Äôs what happens if you implement pvp the way they did. 
---
200 hours and you're mad about paying full price. Jesus
---
a bunch of youtubers and the idiots at kotaku as well as a bunch of chumps on reddit are not an accurate smaple size of anything.
---
The starting Premise is Explosive was OverPowered as a Legendary effect in Fallout 4, and it should have never, ever been a Secondary (Major) legendary Effect. A very very simple fix would have been.  
---
\-Clone the Explosive legendary Effect, and move it to the Primary (Prefix) Legendary slot.  Adjust so the Demo Perks only effect it at roughly 50% (BUT UNDER NO WAY CHANGE THE DEMO PERKS)
---
\-Restrict which weapons the Explosive Legendary effect can be attached to (Energy weapons are silly...)  
---
\-Clone the new Explosive legendary Effect, remove the special FX, adjust slightly so it makes sense for Energy Weapons and add it to Energy weapons.
---
\-On the Original Explosive Secondary (Major) Effect, Adjust the keywords so it no longer benefits from the Demo based perks, dmg or radius. It remains the most powerful of the Secondary legendary effects, but is a 25 point bonus, not 800 +/- w/ perks.
---
\-Leave Two-Shot untouched, because the issue was never, ever TwoShot. Infact Bloodied for example is much much more powerful than Two-Shot.  
---
What they did not only gutted those weapons, it completely destroyed the Demo based builds, and made the niche and already significantly underpowered Missile Launcher and Fatman completely worthless now, saying nothing of the Broadsider. 
---
playstation best
---
&gt; If they just didn't do that, it would have solved a lot of problems 
---
People would have still complain because their TSE got nerfed.
---
u have a furious explosive .50 cal with reduced weight?
---
Is it my fault they spent their money ? Were they forced too? 
---
Yep. The top is always filled with people making a grandiose "exit". But protip: they aren't really leaving and giving up. They're staying and complaining more. 
---
Big ol' circlejerk goin on of players who decided to not play anymore. But they still have all the time in the world to moan, cry, and make empty threats. 
---
[Relax Buttercup](https://i.imgur.com/a/ZqK8guc)
---
AA and explosive don‚Äôt work together atm ...
---
And your random comments found on the subreddit for said game are? 
---
Yeah. No.
---
This is my main bitch about the tse nerf, there is already so little end game content and now they took the SBQ event from us.
---
They don‚Äôt 
---
I‚Äôve got a set of fully modded vanguard armor, and my defense is *BETTER* than all power armor, minus radiation. My rad protection is only 5 sadly
---
What exactly are the improvements? Releasing patches which address basic game balance and fixing bugs that should never have been in the release are not actual improvements.
---
Bethesda and all other developers and publishers are right to be called out on this behavior because otherwise, it's going to keep happening.
---
This is all fine. Now give us a respec for perks.
---
"Jesus wept."
---
I wonder how many days until this guy gets banned. Like one, right? Probably?
---
"Now saves the last limb targeted by the player and will attempt to re-target that limb the next time VATS is activated"
---
Another bad idea... =(
---
Makes me worried for their games in the future. Whether they do any online functions or not
---
A true fan wants their game to be as good as can be expected from the developers. No true fan would just blindly defend a developer who has fucked up so incredibly much.
---
Married for 24 years with 2 children.
---
Yeah, I posted they must be putting soy in the water to fem the population. He does have a point about casuals who played and can't put together a build to save their lives. Also people that age, they don't care to pvp anyways. I get where he's coming from.
---
Really we should only respect people who can code xD If you can't write assembly or at least c, keep you're opinions to yourself! xD I'm being sarcastic btw
---
Pretty sure you can get rid of software regardless of whether or not you can log in to their client. Pretty, pretty, pretty sure. 
---
Why
---
As someone who only uses PA in nuke zones I would be fine with that but, honestly, I was home sick yesterday and played for a good 10 hours running around in my regular armor with the nerfed White Knight and it's not really all that bad. Armor still broke down very slowly and still barely cost anything to repair.
---
From what I have been told, it has to do with the way console code is stored and updated. While on pc the updates are limited to replacing specific files, on consoles the files are in effect grouped in larger blocks of files. So when a few lines of code are changed in a file rather than just downloading and replacing the individual file (as is done in pc updates) the entire block that file is in has to be downloaded. If the changes effected multiple files stored in multiple groups, then mutiple blocks have to be downloaded. 
---
Hot mess
---
I‚Äôm level 71, playing since the BETA. I‚Äôve run into issues, most of which didn‚Äôt stop me from playing. The bulk items issue with the latest patch did cause me to stop until a fix is out. Looks like they got right on it so I‚Äôll be back out there tonight. :)
---
Nope, my current armor is ZERO (0) and I do great.  Only wear a radiation suit.
---
760 hours would be 31.6 days @ 24 hrs a day, so, 63 days @ 12 hours a day, 84.4 days @ 9 hours a day play time. its been roughly 78 days since full (Nov. 14th, not counting beta time) release so roughly 9.75 hrs a day add in weekends (if he has a job), weekends would free him up for 12 to 16 hours play time (assuming 8 hours sleep). would take daily average down to 7 or 8 hours during workdays. not impossible.  
---
no clue what my hours are but ive played since second day of beta, i work 10am to 6pm, get home at 620. jump on game around 7pm. go to bed at 3am, sleep until 9am rinse and repeat.. so i get roughly 8 hours play time a day/night, and if the wife doesnt have plans for my days off (visiting grandkids and so on) and can play roughly 16 hours straight on my weekends.. 
---
it's not.
---
It's pretty telling that you are flat out not allowed to have an opinion on this game that isn't blind, petty hatred.
---
You can't say ANYTHING positive about the game. Not the environment, the voice acting, the story, *nothing*.
---
No one will listen even if you take the time to make an itemized list of all the flaws with the game and the company as a whole. 
---
ALL that matters is that you dared to take an objective, nuanced opinion on the game that isn't frothing-at-the-mouth hatred. That is *all* you people care about, and anyone else is just a Todd Howard dick sucker or Bethesda shill. You don't give a shit about making the game better or what could change going forward. Or hell, the fact that the previous patch's mistake is being hot fixed as we speak.
---
When it comes to 76, nothing matters to people except how much they can bury the game in hatred and then pile as much abuse as they can upon those who dare take a more rational approach. 
---
You guys are a bunch of fucking children.
---
Oh, duh. The 10mm pistol is Gunslinger. Myyyy faaaaault.
---
That's a weird question since the game has never been free. I bought two, both of them pre-release so we could play the beta.
---
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you're being willfully ignorant at this point for trolling purposes.
---
TSE was overpowering not two shot and not explosive. You're just salty because you were getting owned in PvP.
---
Dear Bethesda,
---
I would like to apply for all the listed positions. Here is my resume:
---
Experience: Never been involved in any aspect of game development. But once made a python program that kept track of who would win in Mario Party. (kept track of coins earned and games won; you had to input the values manually of course).
---
Skills:  No creative ability whatsoever. Can barely draw stick figures.
---
Desired pay: You don't have to pay me.
---
Summary: I feel I would be a great fit and could really add to the team. Plus you don't have to pay me so execs' pay will not be affected!
---
Let the griefing begin!
---
It's one thing to voice it, it is another to make post-after-post-after-post crying about one thing, then the next. If it is that horrible, stop torturing yourself and just quit playing. You don't have to live a life of frustration.
---
No, I want Bethesda to give me my $60 dollar game.
---
You do, it seems to bother you enough that more and more people regret their purchase.
---
They've said support for private servers/modding would happen late this year
---
Dude, the game has a stash limit.
---
You are circumventing that stash limit, that is an exploit.  The tos isn't going to list everything that's an exploit.  I honestly don't understand how you can think this isn't cheating.
---
I just assume that the bugs, while creating new ones all the time, will be ironed out in time. Very optimistic, I know. Fallout is my life. I've been the biggest fan since 3, even went back and played 1, 2, Tactics, even that garbage BOS for PS2. I LOVE Fallout. That being said, I don't harbor the hatred others do over FO76. Was it exactly how I anticipated it to be? Yes and no. Yes, it was a watered down FO experience online with grinding elements. It was a semi-mmo so that was to be expected. I did expect much more endgame content, which has been a huge bummer for me as I've completed all the story quests and side quests that I've found. I'm currently lvl 72 and play everyday for at least a couple hours. It has grown a bit stale with the lack of endgame content. But I do have to mention that aside from FO4 with its settlement building, all the Fallout games lack anything after the story is completed, assuming you've already done the side quests. I can't really hold it against them for that. I'm not trying to defend Bethesda. Yes, I'm a fanboy, but I also do see and agree with the problems of FO76. That being said, I'm also not oblivious to the fact that people just want to complain and be nostalgists about literally everything they remotely care about. When FO4 came out, I remember people being PISSED about it, dialogue coming to mind. Nothing could ever touch the masterpiece that FONV was. Now people are saying the same about FO76 in comparison to FO4. FONV, while great, lacked graphics, in depth weapon customization, enemy variety (excluding dlc), settlement building, endgame content, etc. It's BGS first attempt at a game like this. Yes, they should've waited another year to iron things out, but on the positive side, they're basically building this game as we play it. Seemingly listening to the community as they do it, though people will find ways to argue that. We're basically helping to build a Fallout game while getting to play it. That's really kind of neat. This game came out 2/3 months ago and too soon at that. Give it time to actually come to fruition. I can't think of a single AAA game that has come out completed at launch. (Not saying there isn't one, just can't think of one.) I'm sure it's my biased excitement for anything Fallout, but I'm remaining hopeful that this game is going to totally rock and with our continued input, we may even help create a killer product that sees years of continued support and updates instead of letting this ambitious project.... fall out.... (I had to slip it in). But who knows, they could possibly even add free expansion areas like Far Harbor, Pittstown, etc. Here's to hoping Bethesda gets it's opportunity at a Reclamation Day with its player base.

Except I wasn't banned by the company that owns the game and therefore have no need to defend myself. Herp to the derp, buddy. I don't think you understand what context means or how it applies to reasoning. xD
---
Does it include some atom store items, maybe? 
---
Nice, thanks for the info, so thats about 1million, maybe? That would make us reddit users a quarter of the population.  But again there's really no way to tell for sure. Im just saying, we matter lol. 
---
Probably bugged. The two effects cancel each other partially 
---
If your gonna ruin a game we've all paid for, at least give us some free atoms. 
---
actually TSE is no longer the best. It now varies on the enemy you are fighting or type of weapon you are using
---
 Now I do have 5 levels of Ironclad and 3 levels of Fireproof, which is certainly part of both those numbers and my Explosion Resistance.
---
Of course they're going to abandon the game at some point. Do you really think that servers will still be up 10-20 years from now. People will have moved on. It's not like WoW where there's a monthly fee.
---
The question isn't if, but when. And whether we'll get free content at some point. Or even paid content.
---
So far, it's not looking really good with Survival mode being the first significant "update."
---
Player ending....they going to nuke us all?!?
---
; )
---
It's fairly obvious that the world creation was handled by their established team, as that is the only part of the game that is actually well done.
---
Call it what it is, a shameless cash grab from a disreputable company that's screwed us in the past.  They're not stupid, they knew the state of the game, they are familiar with other premium game titles and knew fo76 didn't stand up.  They also knew that with the agreements you'd have to click just to play the game, there would be no recourse if you were unsatisfied.  So why not, right?
---
It takes a while to get the hamsters back on the wheels after giving them a break when they take the servers down.
---
The fact you know more about the game than they do and the fact I'm married and cant get with you both make me sad. You're awesome and amazing. 
---
It's the greatest show on Earth
---
The OP is right, and even if the post looks like some grammar &amp; punctuation stress test, I do share the sentiment. It's understandable that hundreds or maybe thousands of players are quitting now, but if every single one of them feels entitled to write an eulogy about it, it simply paints a skewed picture of the player base. At least I sure hope that's the case. ;-)
---
Let's just carefully say that for many of them the last straw might have been the hard carry weight limit being applied, and I'm not exactly bemoaning their goodbyes...
---
I'm not against using exploits in games, as long as they don't affect other people's gameplay, but the massively overencumbered folks had it coming, and they knew it was coming sooner or later. I advise everyone to switch playstiles in order to adapt, drop your excess stuff for others to find, and find new legit ways to kill the queen.
---
You know, play it like a game, not like a chore.
---
Hows about giving more details since I at least never heard about this bug before.
---
&gt; I haven't actually known you get it for free. Might explain why no one wants to buy the plans I've got from queen. 
---
Did you actually do the quest or did you just start running over to the big red circle every time you got the alert?
---
I play this game with a couple of people that walk around with "player the overseers tape" as the the only quest asking stupid question like "hey were do you get the 1st water pump plans"
---
The posts you are referring to are from exploiters trying to save their accounts by lying.
---
Wait. I thought this was a subreddit for the FALLOUT 76 player community.
---
Am I wrong. Is this a forum to run by Bethesda?
---
Oof man, I do some TLDR posts, but you killed it here :)
---
Try highlighting your main bullet points, and doing shorter paragraphs.
---
Like this one I did:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/?sort=new)
---
If you want to read it all, it's there for the reading.  But if you're thinking FML my post is too long to read, you can get the gist of it from the highlighted bullet points.
---
Hope that helps man :)
---
Not everyone has fibre to premises internet. 
---
On adsl, some people will have to set the update to download overnight, if they want their internet usuable during the day for work, netflix etc. 
---
well said.
---
Such a pathetic generalization lol.
---
You make a good point. But server lag and instability is a well known issue to them, and this post isn‚Äôt about that. And posts bringing awareness to server lag and instability haven‚Äôt been needed for awhile as it has been a known issue since the release of the game.
---
Actually they do. Some of us paid for this dumpster fire and we're still waiting for what we paid for; a finished game. Thats not entitlement. 
---
Some out sourced GM no doubt covering there tracks / clearing there schedule as they would rather play the new patch now bobby pins aren't weighing them down anymore.
---
Moral of the story is my wallet is now closed to Bethesda.
---
Probably the missile launcher. Makes the SBQ giggle a bit.
---
YOU decided the game was about hording.  Bethesda says no hording through their in game rules.  Give me an argument that circumventing an in game mechanic is not an exploit.
---
I Go by the damage figures quoted and how they fire, different enemy types are something difficult to quantify when comparing weapons.
---
AAE will be useful in PVP however....
---
That only applies to melee weapons and armor pieces. Guns don't get any damage boost from being over-repaired.
---
How many pooches have to get screwed? We need to get PETA involved at this point. 
---
I go by the quality of a game‚Äôs graphics &amp; engine of gameplay to see if the devs got the money &amp; resources to make a close to flawless game (bug wise).  Fallout 76 looking a little better &amp; using the same engine with Fallout 4 let me make the decision to just hold off pre ordering or buying on release.  It let me make the inference that they‚Äôll definitely have bugs since you need a good engine these days for online games to work.   
---
I still had high hopes but it‚Äôs always bad news for Fallout 76 these days pertaining to bugs &amp; slow release of content.
---
I won‚Äôt uninstall b/c I see that Bethesda is trying, but I‚Äôll take a break &amp; take my grind habit elsewhere in the meantime 
---
In hindsight, do your research b4 pre ordering or buying on launch.
---
Skepticism is key to understanding the unknown.
---
I think most people would have been happy with the damage caps (like a max damage per weapon type or per base damage) that applied to all weapon types.  Where it messed up is with casual players, particularly a handmade is the favorite weapon type for much the of the community.  The got Pull of them does 92 DMG (for me with 7 related perk points.  An Axe does 300% more than that with (with just 3 per points for me), you have have melees with 10K+ damage on the current system if you push the build.  
---
And they make us download a 1GB update + stand a server down time in main time (gmt) again 
---
Silva farm, where is that on the world?
---
Well don't delete your character, keep it, you invested too much time in it. Just create a new character with a new different name in a months time. I have 10 characters. I mess around on .. 2 xboxes .. other characters are useful
---
The opinion of this sub used to be that this is not a FO76 hate sub. I feel as entitled to this opinion as r/aww feels entitled to cute cat pics.

You like WWE.
---
&gt;This company needs to be held accountable for what they've done, and it is absolutely necessary to call out every single decision they make which undermine their customers, fans and gamers in general.
---
Uh... since when?  Since they nerfed the most duped, OP weapon in the game?  This new demand for accountability sure as hell wasn't around  back when I would log in to find my camp gone and  entire items (generators in particular) were missing.    
---
When I complained about it I was told that it was somehow my fault for not blue printing it or something.
---
&gt; Banning people left and right,
---
Banning them for what?  I've heard of people being banned for duping. If that is what you mean, then I say good riddance.  
---
Oh, I wasn't complaining, just correcting this commentor's assumption that OP was complaining about the download. 
---
Yup ..just drop off some bags at vault 76.
---
Happened to me last night after trying to exit build mode in a workshop in order to defend it from a swarm of mirelurks. I was stuck in 3rd person for a bit before I was able to switch back.
---
Can't connect, can't disconnect. Problem solved.
---
Or go ahead and keep playing.
---
The TSE nerf has nothing to do with melee PVE, it was more due to how non-TSE ppl could not do anything in PVE if a TSE user was present due to him 1-hit killing everything before anyone else could have a chance at landing any hit at all. The mass duping made this issue even worse. Some ppl only think of themselves and forget that there's ppl out there that haven't spent a ton of money to buy any good legendary weapons nor have been lucky enough to find any. Now since TSE got nerfed, other ppl now actually have a chance to land a hit on an enemy in PVE before the TSE user can kill said enemy.
---
People are still duping lol 
---
Yes I did. But I prefer them to talk with actions instead of words. I was the fist to acknowledge that the red headlamp might have been a mistake. But changing the EDID of *ALL* of the headlamps, I find it difficult to attribute it to a mistake. And I was the first to say that I do not care if the add the headlamps to the shop in parallel of being able to acquire them in game. 
---
In their own post I gave them exact details of what the problematic entries where. And any Beth developer that sees that understands that is literally 20 mins of work to correct the mistake. And yet here we are, 23:00 my time, with me looking at the hotfix files, compiling the community patch notes for v1.0.5.14, and you know what I do **not** see? A fix for the red headlamps. 
---
***Actions speak louder than words***
---
I've effectively said as much a couple times already..   
---
Generally the thread has maintained positive, productive tone, but I'm really hoping we can get more than just the Community manager's to weight in for once. 
---
I really start to think Bethesda got their developers from Microsoft... This is almost as disastrous as Windows update.
---
 LOL
---
&gt; That said I struggle to believe you need to craft mass amounts of weapons as the mods are so easy to learn (I have every weapon mod in game on a couple of characters now so I talk from experience)
---
It's definitely not "so easy" to learn every single one. For rare drops (like the handmade) most people can't possibly find enough in the world to be able to learn all the mods by scrapping. Not saying no one has ever done it, but it's just not practical for players that aren't constantly farming for high level weapon drops. And even then, I've scrapped hundreds of common rifles and shotguns and I still learn new mods once in a while. 
---
I uninstalled it already. Then reinstalled. Then uninstalled. Then reinstalled. Then...
---
I got a 3 TB external drive for this reason. My PS4 has a 1TB that is full and PS4 download speeds are terrible so i got the external. you can usually find the 1TB for a decent price, but I know that's not very convenient :/
---
Not gunna disagree with you on those points.  Not saying its better, saying is fresh content so in a sense makes it better. 
---
Ive played FO3, NV, and FO4 several times through... ready for a new story...  course I have finished this one but so many areas I still have to explore.
---
Dupe glitch? Not trying to be condescending but how do you know there is a new one? And how long have they neglected to patch it?
---
My bad,i can't read
---
Really? I've got an anti armor explosive shotgun. It seems to work ok.
---
Bethesda launcher is the final boss
---
Go to Camden park and do the minigames for Mr. Fuzzy tokens. You turn in 400 tokens for a busted/dirty looking Mr. Fuzzy suit.
---
Same drivel is said every patch.
---
Look at how many subs this forum has. Divide that by number of consoles. Are we the majority? Also, factor in not everyone on this sub agrees with each other. It is a minority, no way around it really. 
---
I think it's more choice than ability
---
nah.
---
Yeah, I'm still playing... no reason for me to stop... 
---
That‚Äôs a good idea, I‚Äôm just scared to get banned because one of my characters has obviously duped items in that characters stash box. 
---
I guess I could just take everything out of the box and give them to a new character, that why I can keep all of the clothes I‚Äôve been collecting
---
That's not mentioned in the rules.
---
There is no "opinion of this sub" you're just being another entitled gamer.
---
They don't give too much power to companies in this context IMO, and for a very simple reason. Game publishers have no reason to ban innocent people. None. That means they lose business and piss off a customer, who will likely tell their friends. It's a bad situation. Therefore it's in their best interest to only ban people who are breaking their rules and to avoid arbitrary use or interpretation of the EULA.
---
As far as your question, it doesn't matter what 'cheat' is to me. I didn't make the game, I didn't make the rules. When you participate in an online game the only definition of cheating that matters is that put forward by the company, and in the case of 76, it's very clear to anyone with a brain that duping and abusing exploits for gains is cheating. Things like, you know, a grenade trap that you can farm endlessly for XP. It's generally pretty obvious what cheating is and if it's not you have the option to ask before you take the risk of breaking the rules.

Except we've (Mod Authors, and I'm sure others) have been told (and I have the emails) from the ticketing support team to post these issues on Reddit / Facebook / Twitter for months, to get attention to the issues.
---
I don‚Äôt think it has any crippling effect, it could disable a limb if you hit it, due to the high damage per shot.

Suitcases at Railway stations are better imo, dont want the disappearing bag thing to happen :D :D
---
Playing in game.... Hell no. I‚Äôm level 153.
---
I‚Äôm not the highest in any given server. In some cases, I‚Äôm the lowest level. I observe levels such that I can give out free stimpaks. One in every 5 servers, I come across someone in the level 10-30 range. Most people below 10 are mules anchored to one spot. Nearly everyone that fights in PVP has a decent melee like a grog Axe and a TSE Shotgun.
---
People with 40 hour - 60 hour weeks can still dump a ton of hours in the game
---
We get your point of view but many of us don't want a melee game, we bought the game as a shooter.  A axe shouldn't be 3x stronger than a two shot explosive gun, and you shouldn't be able to push either past a mini-nuke damage wise.
---
You mean, exploiters would just go on the internet and make pitchfork posts in an effort to save their accounts by lying?
---
If I remember correctly monongah power plant has a bunch of bags around it.
---
I just logged in. Gonna drop a nuke.
---
It is believable. Its was just a terrible idea.
---
So you never played FO1 or FO2, both of which needed bugfixes after release?
---
 "Now saves the last limb targeted by the player and will attempt to re-target that limb the next time VATS is activated"
---
And Mothman cult. Just saying.
---
Well said. I concur
---
They don't want to use mods or offer help to modders because it opens a door which will allow more mods in. Once mods start coming in, they can't charge for that content. It's pretty clear cut that this was always the plan from the jump. How people didn't see that is beyond me.
---
Yeah - Bulk items for crafting fixed today. One shot invisible dude, no idea on that one.
---
If you posted on this subreddit and it got deleted, it was probably because you broke one of the posting rules listed to the right.
---
Literally not playing until that‚Äôs fixed and a couple of the re-introduced issues like power armor bug (though sounds like it‚Äôs a lesser version of the original bug)
---
this guy keeps it 100
---
Thanks for the info. Did it a month ago.
---
And don't forget to unsubscribe from FO76.
---
I do yeah, i have fun with it. But I certainly don't go around telling people that they're wrong when they say its bad.
---
But lol, love when people get so angry that they go through someone's post history looking for "dirt"
---
You, too, like a bad video game :)
---
so fanboyism only?
---
YOU CAN STILL PURCHASE IT EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW IT'S GOR UNINTENDED SIDE EFFECTS? Here we go AGAIN.
---
It's like taking a hot shit. It all ends up being a sweaty, burning mess. But at least it's out of the way and there's more room for blazin' wings.
---
meh thats all they did? :(
---
Don't straw man me. That is a total mischaracterization of what I wrote. 
---
I recently found a lot of cement bags at the monorail elevator. Take the SE elevator, walk up the stairs and through the loop. There you should find a makeshift bridge secured with cement bags and lead weights. 
---
This guy gets it. Hotfixes don‚Äôt always mean the servers stay up it‚Äôs more often an out of cycle deployment.
---
I tried out normal armour for the first time a couple of days ago, and even with armour perks and felt very squishy. 
---
With the detriment of little radiation protection, you would think that normal armour gets some decent positives. 
---
Maybe in a future update....
---
3 bags on the shelf by vendor bot Phoenix. 
---
Yeah this happened to me before, another player started to claim the workshop I had, steps out side the area  before it becomes uncontested (unknown), kill's me, takes my stuff, runs off and then leaves the world. 
---
I mean, there's a fix today
---
Ps4 too. 1.004 gb

Wrong. This subreddit was FULL of awesome nontoxicity until Tuesdays patch went thru. The majority of posts were about interesting things that happened or sharing CAMP builds or looking for advice. All of that has been replaced by pissed off players like you clamoring for blood. To be fair, most of those posts since Tuesday HAVEN'T been toxic; they have been a little whiney at times but generally decent and certainly NOT suggesting toxic ways to ruin the game for other players. Unlike yours.
---
You acknowledged you'd catch some negativity for your post. You caught it. Now, own that the toxicity is yours and take it somewhere else.
---
subbed to subreddit becasue I own and played the game.
---
But now that you mention it, you're right, I'll unsub from this shitty game's sub reddit.
---
Good call.
---
I'm not, Actually a non-OP melee build (I use silly weapons like pipwrenches, lead pipes, Guitar swords and don't max out my perks)...  
---
But I've tested nearly every legendary weapon and perk combo, so I see how badly they destroyed the Demo builds.   
---
They made the previously barely justifiable Missile launchers and Fatmen completely worthless now.
---
If you can see it, they can see it!
---
A lot of it to Zenimax probably. They also have to pay their employees, pay the bills for all their offices, employee benefits. Devs are forced to rush when money is getting low. Not sure if that is the case here though.
---
Interesting, it's all the more relevant because I never had a TSE, only a two-shot gauss, which, was still nerfed into oblivion by the changes.
---
Feel your pain...
---
I agree, that image is loud and obnoxious. Lol
---
If you put the tormentor perk in luck on then yes.
---
aT tHe CoNcReTe StOrE
---
I saw some T51 pieces today at that warehouse in Morgantown.
---
I'd say the biggest changed was the sheer display of incompetence when it comes to patching. They fixed the Bobby pin weight from .1 to .001 with a patch earlier this month, only for it to come back in the patch that came back the other day. The game's development has actually regressed. I'm sure it's not the first game to do it,  but I think we all expected better of Bethesda.
---
You think one person or group of people has been making all of these somewhat questionable decisions?
---
Channel 5 Gaming

Saw it on a pretty new Video about anti armor guns After the nerf patch

All over.

Pretty much any place in Ash Heap usually has an armor
---
A few in the buildings around Watoga
---
So many places it's hard to list them all.
---
If you see a Power Armor Station, chances are it has a chance to spawn a Power Armor in or around it.
---
#thatpart
---
I mean using your statistics of 171k in this subreddit,  less than 10% (based on posts with the most likes) were able to cry foul and have tse nerfed in the first place. And I get it,  despite having a few  , I would be the first to agree they needed a rebalance, and I was also annoyed by the grief meta that primarily focused from these weapons.... but a rebalance should be to all weapons, armor, and perks effecting them. I get you represent the casual majority ,  and don't fault you for your opinions. Maybe I represent the casual minority,  as I dont have more than 100 hours but have actually paid for 2 (one regular and one Tricentenial ed.) accounts (the latter mainly to mule all the stuff I can't part with but can't cram into my meager storage.
---
But to your point I feel people have a right to be upset... not tantrum style , whoa is me I'm quitting , but for the general lack of understanding/care of what such nerfs do,  without sitting down and thinking about how it effects every aspect of game play.
---
I could list all the broken things that got over looked or point out that you kill one meta but every one will gravitate to the next one...  bottom line is in a game that encourages you to vary your play styles,  they don't leave you many effective options as of yet.
---
I however am optimistic of the future... I hope they figure it out and get it right.
---
there's an inbox?
---
&gt; That only applies to melee weapons and armor pieces. Guns don't get any damage boost from being over-repaired.  
---
Yes they do.
---
Ah my bad, you didn‚Äôt make the melee comment I was referring to. The melee guy said he‚Äôs hitting for 2.4k or something like that. If I were to compare my build to yours yeah it would be low because for strength we can NOT max out 3 cards like this, the simple answer is other cards like incisor and for fists the fist damage one also are just better, I did max one card for damage but did the math and can get more out of 3 one star cards.
---
So since there‚Äôs no monthly subscription and we all already paid them how does this make BSG lose money? 
---
They can still roll back the mistake that was the "TSE Rebalance"
---
Makes sense with the alien blasters and shit around the map.
---
there is also a frame up on top of the highschool.
---
Lol idk its just hard to say without official stats. I guess it is what it is. 
---
No, i didn't say that.
---
The idea that spending 5-10 hours a day doesn't make your opinion more important is my point.
---
If anything, in Bethesdas eyes, it means less as you play the game so much but say you hate it.... Its hypocritical and obnoxious.
---
THANK YOU. Jesus I had to go too far down to find someone with common sense here. 
---
Got a suggestion. Would it be possible to put different seasons in Fallout 76? Swap in sets of textures that reflect Appalachia in summer, spring, and winter? Maybe a few changes in terms of gameplay-- say, you get hungrier when it's cold, thirstier during the summer? You'd need different clothing during the year? Different distributions of monsters (say, more insects during the summer months)? 
---
"You could have your account banned immediately after you create it because they don't like the name you've chosen and you'd have 0 options to appeal this."
---
Wtf are you talking about lol. You're so far out of the scope of reality on this one I don't know what to say. Why in the hell would a business want to ban people and lose customers because they 'don't like the name you've chosen'? It's an exaggerated and impractical example of a paranoid contention. It's a gd video game publisher ok, it's not my local government.
---
Also, "infallible companies" and "absolute power over you" make you sound like a maniac. Seriously. You sound like a tinfoil hat wearer. So I'm going to block you after this. Because I can't engage with that degree of paranoia. We won't see eye-to-eye.
---
Last comment: As I've already mentioned, and maybe you should look into this, as concerns most online games you are not purchasing the game, you are purchasing access to the game. This is why you're not allowed to resell in-game assets you earn, like gear... you don't actually own them. It's just like walking into an arcade, you're paying to play the cabinet, not to own it. So yea, it's just like a sports competition where you pay to join in, not to control the game itself. Whatever ideas you have about what a 'product' means, you need to start looking at the details involved in what you buy because you clearly don't understand them.
---
Maybe that's just the first of several patches for all we know. 
---
My ps4 currently downloading version 1.9. Is server gonna be inaccessible for a while as same as the patch 2 days ago ?
---
Watoga. There are is one near the center next to a downed vertibird. There is also another one if you go west from there, to a red building with a fire escape. Go up and hang a left then up some stairs. There will be another power armor frame next to a vertibird.
---
That sucks if using a recon scope, you‚Äôll lose all your markers.  But still good to know.  Thanks
---
Borderlands 2 is what you‚Äôre looking for
---
Agreed OP. This smells of incompetence at its, lack of understanding of the game. Chronic disregard about the current player base. Using a sledge hammer to impact all users instead of admitting and dealing with the duping issue. They should of singled out all dupers, but instead they took a LAZY approach and basically said fuck it and mandated a strict carry weight limit on everyone because of it. They could go easily scanned all accounts like they claimed they could do and just delete or ban obvious individuals with too stuff. I think I have been patient enough but probably will look at finding something else to play and never intend of buying another Bethesda game period.
---
You used the word discredit. Empathy is not feelings.
---
&gt;the game isn't good
---
Opinions aren't facts. Negative posts is a bummer, always, whether the game is broken or not. It's a great rule to follow‚Äîif someone enjoys something, telling them why they shouldn't is a dick move.
---
I have had over 260 hours of enjoyment out of this game.  There have been nights of frustration, but nothing to make me rage so hard that I needed to post about it.
---
I have enjoyed this game immensely.  I still haven't finished the core content either.
---
The vertibird crash,top of high school and the outpost just SE has the armor. Got full lvl 50 t51 in 2 hops but now that people need cores the parts are being stripped and sold to the vendors more often.
---
It's common practice in all forms of development and usually one of the easier things to implement.
---
Xbox one here and each time I try to get into world it does the countdown then immediately says disconnected from server
---
I think you got your $60 worth. Time to let go of the sunk cost. 
---
Good stuff. I‚Äôd also like to say that whenever a patch is released in pretty much any game any forum or reddit associated with it gets flooded with people who don‚Äôt like the game and don‚Äôt play the game just to throw gasoline on the fire.
---
Exactly the same issue for me since the patch. PC
---
Is it back? Fml. 
---
They're making it real hard for me to buy the next Skyrim. Can't support a company that pulls this shit.
---
Until Tuesday night, all was smooth sailing. Got kicked off a server during a scorchbeast fight once, not the worst. Then Tuesday night I was looting ghouls and getting legendary after legendary. I dont know which ones, because I'm stuck in place and I cant open my inventory. 
---
So if this helps people understand why even the most diehard apologists are angry, there ya go.
---
And how did you close gaps between yourself and ranged enemies? The guys who could 1 shot you from a range?  Did you charge them?  Zig zag? Hide in a closet? How did it work out?
---
How did you hold workshops when ranged snipers with 1 shot tse's were fixed on the green circled bench area? With no range, how ?

they purposfuly didn't release the metrics for it and as the game isn't on steam people can't use steamspy to get those metrics. the only numbers we have are the number of articles and fan reaction vids that properly document how broken the game is.

In Watoga/ Cranberry bog area.   I was able to put together entire suits of level 50 T60 and T51 power armor.   There's  a spawn on top the watoga emergency center and the building across from that where power armor spawns. More often than not, it's pieces with T60 and T51 power armor pieces. The brotherhood bases in the cranberry bog spawn them too. I was able to put one together with roughly an hour of server hopping for each one. It's not difficult. 
---
Bethesda! Nerf this shit right now!
---
Lmao. 
---
(What a stupid reply, hey?)
---
I wear mostly Vanguard armor (mix of Leather and Combat, with one Marine leg) and have fought Scorchbeasts without too much concern. Defense hovers in the ~250ish range for physical, and ~300 for energy.
---
However, I play a ranged build, so I‚Äôm not getting pummeled as frequently as a melee build would be.
---
I would like private servers more if it wasn't only 25 people per server.
---
One of the big points that you hit on is the cart-before-the-horse leveling.  I'd love to plan a build, but if you spend over 400 hrs, and still don't find the weapon you need for the build, you're kind of screwed.  And by find I mean find organically in the game, even farming and hopping. It is easy to build from the ground up if you can count on a quick trade facilitated by a 3rd party community or, worse, going to eBay and outright buying something.
---
At one point last night I was running in super slow motion. I think Speed Demon did the reverse of its effect x10. Could barely move. 
---
Now thats epic 
---
Uses the term "REEEEEE" and then states
---
&gt;Most of you are too stupid to understand much of anything,
---
Yet, who's the one defending a busted ass game? Wow.
---
Maybe, they shouldn't have tried to do the thing they have no experience doing. Maybe patience is supposed to be used while we wait for a new games, and not for existing games to get too a playable state due to a hideous premature birth
---
I've randomly found pieces all over the map, mostly on the random power armor chassises and occasionally in the steamer trunks 
---
Where does it say that having a character holding items is an exploit? If it's not against the terms of service then you aren't exploiting anything. That's what I'm trying to get at here. Just because you personally think it takes away from the experience doesn't make it an exploit, it's just not how you choose to play. 
---
If someone isn't spec'd for range and doesn't have a decent gun, they should at least run around and clear the adds on the ground so those that can damage the queen in the air don't have to pull off her deal with the ground enemies.
---
Did you download and install the patch?
---
Odd. I‚Äôm on PS4 with nearly a full lobby of players now. I‚Äôd assume you‚Äôve got maybe a few minutes most
---
&gt;We are working on ways to prevent this from happening again in the future.
---
Ha!
---
Today's hotfix 
---
630 hours played here. 
---
What keeps me going is the friends ive made while playing this game. I couldn't imagine playing this game without them. I've started a small community on ps4, every-time i met someone that meshed well with me and the few friends i played with at the time got an invite to my community and/or friends-list. Then the community started growing with friends of friends or meeting others in area chat and now its booming with over 30 members. We all have a blast sharing ideas, screenshots and do what we can to enjoy the game. 
---
I would also suggest playing at least 2 characters. I have my main lvl191 that uses heavy weapons and my lvl35 character as a melee only playstyle. Its nice to vary up the gameplay. 
---
Id also suggest never affiliating with dupers or out of game merching communities simply because there is such little content in this game, the only way to keep me playing is to farm my own gear. I know its hard to stay clean when 50% of the community is infected by dupers but its worth it if you are. The latest patch with all the plans has been amazing too, finally something to grind for. 
---
You could hang out in camps/workshops waiting for events to pop. My favorites being Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, Horde missions and the messenger (if hes in a high level zone). 
---
Two things i wish this game had though, at least when im playing with a large amount of my community members...
---
an Area + Team chat setting and a server browser so i can fit more of my friends into the same server. Or like a lobby identifier on my friends list showcasing like 20/24 so i know if there is room. 
---
/u/Ladydevann Some great feedback here i think for those who have spent a lot of time in game. 
---
I am with you, I felt so bad I sent a buddy 60 bucks on Venmo, with the message, "Never bring up Fo76 again"
---
No it‚Äôs just annoying that every other post on this sub is complaining. Stop playing the game and talking about it if you don‚Äôt like it.  
---
LOL...yeah you may melt an ordinary SB, but my Gun would take inches off a SBQ's health bar with 1 box of Ultracite .50 Cal ammo. Your normal .50 Cal is garbage compared to mine, you bullshit yourself...git good.
---
I think that is a very fair question. 
---
Bethesda won't release full sales stats, but we can use intuition and understanding of the gaming market. We can also use 3rd party figures, that while not exact, can help triangulate an idea of sales. 
---
Without a doubt, FO76 sales are disappointing, But one outfit estimates they sold 1.4 million digital downloads in November. NPD, a different outfit, listed FO76 as the 4th biggest selling Console game in November, but did not attach numbers to it. 
---
What we know for market analysis is that for AAA titles, \~75% of sales is still physical copies. And analysis by Statista shows that in 2017 21% of all games sales were digital. Meaning, that it is exceedingly likely the physical sales figures for November are much higher than 1.4 million. 
---
If we assume that 1.4 million digital download estimation represents 25% share, we can estimate total sales in November at 5.6 million units. 
---
Which seems like a lot, until you realize it is half of RDR2...
---
BUT, it is still a shitload of people. and only using that one month, it is not unreasonable to assume that 171K represents &lt;3% of the FO76 base.  
---
Thank you so much for the very detailed comment that helps tremendously!
---
Someone just commented to me that the MODUS duping glitch is back and very popular. 
---
It is hard to confirm if true or not as I don't dupe. 
---
But leather coats are now selling for 100 caps a piece on xbox since this morning. 
---
So... yeah. 
---
Your comment is the exact thing your laughing about
---
Nah I like silence I have kids thanks 
---
K, i asked you to fulfill the burden of proof. Why are they not trying to just make money? Thats a fairly reasonable base line assumption.
---
Bloodied and Instigating both do 100%.
---
Again you keep reverting back to the combination of the two effects. 
---
You so desperately want TSE nerfed that you didn't care about guns that didn't have TSE being nerfed. Therefore I am super happy to see that White Knight got nerfed.

I agree with almost everything you've just said but for balance I would like to point out the "average" gamer experiencing the same problems as the rest of us don't bother coming on Reddit to complain or point out bugs or give improvement suggestions.
---
The simply quit the game, write it off as broken, shit or meh!
---
Let there vendors vent, they often have valid suggestions too.
---
Oh my god, that is NIGHTMARE FUEL.
---
I have the same problem, randomly, regardless if in a power armor or not. Regular laser rifle.
---
Shit happens, shit unhappens, then shit happens again. that's life bro

Why was the demolition perk not fixed in todays patch. 
---
My level 45 explosive handmade. 
---
Damage without perk  67
---
Damage with all 5 demolition perks: 74
---
Come on this stinks.
---
This bloody game, not sure what it is about it but instead of focusing on other games I am now browsing the internet for cheap keys so I can start an alt and share inventory because FO76 doesn't have a shared stash between alts.
---
Looks like CDKEYS has one for $10. Basically I can get the game for the price of 2 coffees :).
---
Anyhow no idea where I fit into the groups Casual / Hardcore / Junkie / Other. Probably Junkie based on how much time I spent on this game vs. other games.
---
The main problem with that is, at some point the development team starts to have to cut staff.
---
I saw that happen over at SOE / Daybreak in H1Z1.  The main problem with H1Z1 was they stopped listening to the players.  People left, more devs got fired, more people left, more devs got fired.  It went that way for a while until H1Z1 Just survive doesn't exist.
---
Stay as long as you can.  Offer helpful suggestions.  See if they can turn it around.  That's the best method.
---
If it ever becomes "too much", leave and come back later.  See if it's better :)
---
I have this problem on PC as well. I think I was using Grant's Saber (or whatever one you get from the Mistress of Mysteries questline.)
---
Have you heard the latest? Apparently bronze is going to be huge.
---
So, I got flamed a bit for using the phrase "true fans". Personally, when I say "true fans" I am talking about people who are fans of Fallout games in general, had an idea of what they were getting into with a fallout title (or thought they did) when they started playing 76, and I don't think being critical of the game now or a couple months ago excludes anyone from being a "true fan". 
---
That said, those who I don't consider true fans are the ones who were making YouTube videos purely for the purpose of the views and spreading downright false information. The people who propagated the lies without any fact checking and who made click bait posts just for the upvotes because it was trendy at the time. The people who hate on fallout 76, never having played a previous fallout game, because it isn't Call of Duty. Those are the people I don't consider to be true fans. 
---
Maybe mine isn't a popular opinion, that's ok. I had a lot of fun when I first started playing fallout despite the issues. The game is getting worse in a lot of ways almost as quickly as it is getting better in others, and that is why many of the people who stuck this long are now losing faith. Just because you didn't stick around as long as we did doesn't make you any less of a true fan of fallout. 
---
Watoga or burning mine and run to belching Betty, in the room where you start the Fire Breathers quest
---
I feel the same way. I bought this game for a friend for Christmas and she was stoked to start playing. We have been playing less and less each week. 
---
Ohh... Last thing... And then I jump and marsupial don't work
---
I can‚Äôt get on today. Tomorrow at 3:00 Pm est I will be on. 
---
Plastic is gold in this game. 
---
How is the SBQ different? 
---
My husband and I have been playing Fallout since 1999. When we were broke, we took turns on our one computer, eventually, we had the money to play parallel, each on our own PC. All along, what I have really wanted is to explore the wasteland with him, having each other's back. We were really excited when 76 was announced, and bought ourselves each a copy and one for our 14-year-old son. We look greatly forward to a private server, that we can mod and mess around with, but it's something our family can do together. We enjoy playing on the servers most of the time, but the occasional person who decides to run up and beat you to death with a knife while you try to get away makes us look forward to a no grief experience. 
---
We have the occasional bug, the occasional disconnect, things that we have to wait for a hotfix for, bad internet days where we can't always play, but we also beta tested Ultima Online a million years ago, and we have seen what sometimes feels like all the multiplayer game bugs, and for this one we're not paying $15 a month for the privilege of. Bethesda seems committed to getting it right, and I am fine being patient for that. I get frustrated like everyone else, but for the most part, the happiness of being able to run around Appalachia with my husband when he comes home from work outweighs the bad. 
---
This is a problem I have with armor mechanics in this game. Regular armor with right mods offering way more protection than PA and you can even get stat bonuses with some setups. 
---
Doubt it was intended.  Nothing they do really works out as intended.  For good or bad.  At least they didn't have us wait 2 weeks for another random hoop to jump through during gameplay.  I guess that's the real endgame.
---
Heard they are looking to improve some or all heavy weapons and reduce their ammo weight.
---
Personally, I know this man. He grinds day in and day out because he cares about the game. He wants to have fun with his buddies, he plays with me a lot.
---
He does see a lot of numbers, but he sees a lot of humans too. 
---
We‚Äôve talked a lot about what can be done on paper for this game, and what can happen in reality. The math plays a big role, but we are trying to help everybody I‚Äôm the process.
---
Stuff like this makes me hate gaming more and more. Gaming companies are so far removed from it's players and care about nothing but money but at a very near point in time decisions to put money first will lead to people to avoid your games. There was a balance but I fear it's long gone.
---
You can find some on existing frames I have 3 witch I still can't wear....
---
Good bot.
---
I'm the same, don't plan on playing for a while but I don't want to have to wait hours for it to install if/when it's worth it again. 
---
I‚Äôm loading in now 
---
Be pissed and wander aimlessly while killing everything.
---
You're hoping in the future you can give us an update of when to expect a roadmap that outlines when we can expect content?
---
They should delete the Ultracite Armor plans from the queens loot table. No one can use them anymore. Theres no reason for them to exist, if everyone just gets them for free from the terminal. 
---
I didn't even want the game a bud bought it for me I love it now... Of course I played wot for years so I love grindfests 
---
lol this sub is turning into NMA 
---
These kinds of posts are a sight for sore eyes. Keep up the good work!
---
Idk why anyone is thinking new content should be out within 3 months of launch. Thats a none issue since its not a subscription game. That said i agree it has its issues. Idc how long it takes to fix though since i never have to pay another dime.
---
People already crowding around white springs farming that clubhouse lol.
---
Virulent**
---
Noted. We will hoard up as much as we can.
---
Also, about stashing, is there any tips to lower the bulk of any of the materials or stuff ?
---
This is devastating for all those players that like to go on scrap runs with 20 bulk boxes...Crawling  in..... my skin... this wounds... will.. never heal. This is why i'm torn :(
---
Good luck.  The traders at FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar have been snapping them up and holding onto anything that might be the new meta like it's their firstborn child.
---
At least until that new meta gets nuke nerfed like TSE.....lol
---
They need to do more gradual balance changes like League of Legends.  I made a post about it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how\_to\_do\_nerfs\_buffs\_bug\_fixes\_and\_content\_to/?sort=new](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alrk55/how_to_do_nerfs_buffs_bug_fixes_and_content_to/?sort=new)
---
LOLOLOLOL... 2 steps forward 10 backwards. 
---
I guess we got to be content with bobby pins weight get fixed/put back to previous patch.

---
Your need to find a better weapon bro, you won't find it here on reddit . Kick rocks sucka...
---
Rifle is already better than most ranged. Heavy, pistol, explosive, energy, need buffs.
---
Op you are asking for it at this point continuing to play this game. Abandon it and let it die an embarrassing death already. 
---
You know, you're right, it's not the end of the world.
---
But it still isn't working as it should, and it's perfectly fine to point that out.
---
You sound like a tool.
---
1) I acknowledged the CMs, they aren't the only ones working for Bethesda though and shouldn't be the only ones trying to put out the fires.
---
2)How long did it take to fix many other issues? Not just the ones they made on the last update or needed fixes since BETA that haven't been made yet?
---
3)A semi weekly newsletter is an alright step in the right direction, but not exactly bigger picture. 
---
No. I only use PA when fighting the SBQ. I play solo and use a jack of all trades kinda build.
---
I agree with this, I am a melee and the TSE's still are fun to use and clear enemies with. Sure no where near as powerful but still fun. Handmade and TSE's are my guns even after the patch. I still use my super sledges for mix it up .. couldn't kill any scorch beasts anymore from he ground, they refused to land, I will see how good they are still when I get one to land.
---
You seriously have fucked everyone who has worked hard to get all of the demolition perks, as well as screwed up the game even worse. You deserve the lawsuits that are against you now. In fact, after this post, I'll be looking for a way to join them.  
---
I have a lvl 45 TSE shotgun. With no perk it does 155 damage. Level does matter.
---
At 8 hours a day you'd be at 7600 hours in 2.6 years roughly.   No-one is going to be playing this game then much less in 2+ years.
---
One of the most stable releases they've had....that's not a good advert for them fyi
---
Can we print this post out and mail/fax it to everyone involved in Fallout 76? The design notes here are laughably counterproductive. "People weren't doing what we wanted, so instead of fixing the systems to make that activity easier we made the workarounds harder." That's the worst possible way to solve any of these issues. 
---
Yeah let me insult you because you dont take something not that important in non serious way
---
Im an angry gamer &gt;:(
---
I wonder if all those stats are skewed from early release people who didnt like the game and canceled their preorder. I highly doubt that many people bought the game but never even left the vault.
---
What a stupid meme.  They gave everyone who owned all of Skyrim the Special Edition for free.
---
Tomato tamato :)
---
Maybe it would be cool if you teamed up with listed traders to help defend against greifers - could be fun. 
---
"As it should" industry insider here folks.
---
Done. Question 3 is weird though. I bought and played my own game. 
---
oh look, another toxic comment from another troll who loves disagreeing with the genuinely accepted opinions of the masses for the sake of being edgy and different. I expect if you pay for a burger and fries from McDonald's and they forget the burger you'll just carry on about your day because you gave them your money and they didn't give it to you because they don't owe it to you, and expecting them to fulfill your order makes you entitled.
---
&gt; It's not good for the community. 
---
You mean the community that's upvoting the posts you're complaining about?  
---
Okay im going to ask this question, how many of you have actually created a game? Then to those of you who have, how many have created a bug free mmo? Every developer with a mmo deals with bugs. Do you think blizzard doesn't have bugs try again. The difference is that devs like Blizzard use PTR to help cut down on bugs this is Bethesdas first dive into the MMO age its bound to have issues. The question becomes are they going to do something about it (patches) or just leave the game broken? They are attempting to fix issues but just because it isnt fast enough for you you think its them not caring about the game. The community is the ones causing issues for them not the game. When you people break the game intentionally by accessing the dev room or dup items your breaking the games coding. Wake up your ruining the game not Bethesda because they now have to fix the codes you broke by doing something your not supposed to be doing. So before you all come at the devs for broken codes in game check yourself. With the recent bans that have come because of the dev room issue its becoming better. Why dont you try enjoying the game and let the dev do their job. You posting things like this here are taking their attention away from fixing the game to address your cry baby complaints. Shut up let them do their job. Honestly at least they are attempting to fix things and bitching about the recent patch that "broke" a previous patch isnt going to help get it fixed. Do what those of in the Indy game dev community are doing disect the code for yourself see if you can find the issue. Otherwise shut your mouth and enjoy the game. Stop the whining.
---
Fallout communities exist to hate on fallout games (unless theyre old enough) is what I learned 
---
In a slap damage situation, melee always wins. That‚Äôs how most fights are started. 
---
If it‚Äôs a workshop battle, the other person is typically nearby, and you can kill them with one swift strike. 
---
There really is no running.
---
Am I though? What‚Äôs a more realistic situation? 
---
A casual hears he can buy guns amor and what ever he what‚Äôs with cash over EBay or Fiver or another web site for $20 and he has his end game gear and build.
---
As a hardcore grinder can earn caps and buy off other players.
---
Or a Hardcore Player buying them for cash?
---
That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre playing the game, and using its mechanics (damage avoidance etc). 
---
The people whining about this and TSE are the ones who used them as a crutch and bother figuring the other game mechanics out. 
---
Bethesda is doing it in part to pull them out of that rabbit hole and force them to actually play the game and its mechanics. 
---
I know some people who were involved with the development and QA in the game; Bethesda made mistakes because Bethesda didn‚Äôt QA very much. They cut a lot of contract QA workers halfway through the contracts and never even got far enough into the game to test high level content. The actual QA employees were pretty neutered as well. They‚Äôd report bugs and be told it wasn‚Äôt a bug/to ignore it. Staff in the MD office were more concerned with just playing the game rather than thoroughly testing it and shouldered all of it onto the overworked TX staff, who were already working more hours than needed.
---
and the problem before was it didnt scrap bulk items automatically.....make up your damn minds.
---
Nah I don‚Äôt just like it, I love this game flaws and all. 
---
lol at getting angry. I make fun of the people who are getting so bent out of shape for every little thing. 
---
My point was maybe you are not the best person to gatekeep what is good and bad, and anyway what kind of person goes around trying to convince people what they like is bad? 
---
Damn got me there
---
You can't read? I didn't write anything about pain and frustration, just pointing out problems the game has.
---
&gt; I just can't join the howls of protest. I have never had a TSE gun.  
---
I can't join the howls of protest either. I too have never had a TSE gun.   
---
Funny how that works isn't it? 
---
I think there's a clear an obvious  connection there. 
---
Sorry, I'm not going to join the rage machine because a gun that I don't have and armor that I don't use got nerfed. 
---
&gt;How did you play Fallout?
---
Uhhhh
---
&gt;Would you recommend this Character to a Friend?
---
Would I recommend Benny to a friend? Sure...
---
I'd be willing to to bet that a Bloodied or an Instigating is better than two shot.
---
25% fire rate and 50% limb damage would probably be better than explosive. Explosive turned into a steaming pile after the Nerf.
---
Oh god you sound like trump.
---
Are you not aware that this game is broken and buggy and the attempts to fix it have been hamfisted and counterproductive? Where else would we discuss those things? 
---
So who's the real duper here? lol
---
Downvoter here. These patch notes are utterly bereft of anything useful or even interesting that is not better explained by the official patch notes. Total waste of time.
---
I've been seeing a problem where the SBQ glitches and intermittently just stops taking any damage.  Not sure if this applies to the regular scorchbeasts have the same problem.
---
i found one it was only lvl 35 but someone sold it in watoga, i tossed the mirv mod on it and still have it in my stash hoping its useful one day, i tried firing it across the creek to the nuka cola plant to hit a parked car but they fell in the water.. i was sad.
---
The fuck even is TSE?
---
Troubleshooters gatling gun, 60* damage perks, cripple perks and armor penetration perks. So you don't even use a full build? 
---
Where did you get the full set of T-51b power armor plans(not mods)?
---
Wow almost no damage at all now. 
---
I've always been against legendary items and enemies even in Fallout 4. I think that they mostly just break the game balance. If you want to have a tough enemy that drops a better than normal weapon or armor piece, make it a boss in a dungeon that drops a unique item instead of relying on RNG to give you one of them "god rolls" that I've never seen in person before.
---
Guilty* too :-/
---
I used the word discredit, yes. But not in relation to my feelings. Also, the definition of empathy:
---
em¬∑pa¬∑thy
---
/Ààemp…ôTHƒì/
---
the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.
---
&gt;opinions aren't facts
---
You're right, [except fallout 76 is widely considered not to be a good game, and that's an objective fact.](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/fallout-76) I also picked the highest rated version of the game, which is the ps4 version.
---
They confirmed new content is done. They are just fixing balance and glitches before they release it. Makes sense imo. You don't want people 1 shotting their way through raids day 1. I say they should take their time and get the first dlc right
---
The age of outrage will never be satisfied. 
---
Shutdown was good for me - I was in the middle of being chased by a scorchbeast, scorched and the Flatwoods monster. Heaven knows where I'll spawn back in though. I just ran anywhere and all I know is I was perched on a ledge of a cliff when disconnected. 
---
Till everyone notices that the only thing in safes now is salt?

---
Known this for ages and guns still break too fast.
---
I'm giving you an upvote. Glad to see you go. 
---
I feel like the people with a massive amount of playtime might have convinced themselves to grind away and when the game is fixed or when it starts to gain popularity again, they will be ahead. (I have around 80 hours, 2 characters)
---
I know that at least 4 people play in France.
---
Balance legendaries IN pvp. Thats what they are beginning to do and its great! Pvp is the best part of this game.
---
Face it. Pvp is going to drive balance from here on forward. Nerfing melee doesnt help. Melee needs to be a 1 shot bc we dont have ranged attacks. Ranged cannot be a 1 shot or melee isn't viable. Top end ranged gear should be 2+ shots to take down a player. 
---
How many times can you shoot me in an open field while i charge with my super sledge? From 50 ft? 25 ft? 10 ft?
---
Lol at all you pve tse nerds crying about muh nerfed explosives!
---
Prior to this patch ranged tse users owned the pvp landscape.  How am i supposed to kill someone if i dont have a ranged attack and theirs 1 shots me? I need to be able to eat 1 or 2 bullets as a melee pvper.  I need an honest chance of getting close to you.
---
Now it feels very balanced. 3 shots to kill me is fair. I dont think i faced an AAE user yet. Also vats crit headshots still 1 shot me pvp. So theres still a way for you guys to be competitive. 
---
You guys are always wrong. Bethesda please 
---
 Stop listeneing to this subreddit. People here are the worst. 
---
PvP is going to drive balance. 
---
You never pvp'd so your opinion is worthless.
---
The PVE side of the game can be fixed with adjustments to enemy npc health pools and armor ratings. Dont call for a melee nerf if you dont have any understanding of the other side of the game (PVP). 
---
PvP just took the steering wheel on player balance. Feels good man.
---
"it just works"
---
They really need to do a more balanced approach to both nerfs and buffs.  I outlined it in my post here:
---
Solo and singleplayer are two different things.
---
You can play an MMO solo. You cannot play it singleplayer.
---
The distinction is up to the player to make, and should be an easy one considering the fact they already told everyone (many times) it is multiplayer only.
---
That sledgehammer you pick up will be your best friend for the next 400 hours

&gt; I run away from scorch beasts. 
---
Don't.  Seriously, stand up to the bullies, it's liberating.
---
(I heavily recommend PA though, even though I personally *hate* power armor for most of the gameplay).
---
I‚Äôd be really surprised if it wasn‚Äôt. It was lag central for me yesterday and I normally have minimal lag. I gave up on crafting a few times and had the menu pop up several minutes later. Of course it waits until I‚Äôm getting my ass kicked by something lol. 
---
People often say the same thing on /r/wow but the opinion on those subreddits are often shared by the majority.
---
Plenty of games that were apparently alive or good games according to some despite the opinion of their subreddits or forums died not long after.
---
Fo76 was doomed to fail when they decided to use the fo4 game engine, which was never intended for multiplayer and never intended to be only patched by them, these games thrived and needed mod support. Without it they are boned.
---
Your scrapping needs will change as you advance. 
---
Be wary of meeting with people who offer to trade with you in their camps. Most players are great, but some want to kill you and take your scrap. 
---
Related to that, message me here if you're on PS4. Will drop you a welcome to the wasteland gift. 
---
I'm a bit short on scrap right now, but i'll come up with something good. 
---
You should ban yourself from life with a pistol
---
+1 karma for every  Expert database developers and game dev in the sub.
---
I would love this. I love games that have fishing.
---
Lol, im terrible. Search pacify sorchbeast. There is a post from yeaterday with a screenshot
---
Watoga, converted munitions factory 
---
He's trying to get a rise out of players by gloating he got it for free but the thing is nobody cares lol
---
Wait a bit, to do some of the missions because they give rewards based on your lvl. So basically if you do mayor for a day at 20 you will get an all rise legendary super sledge stuck at lvl 20 that will be useless at higher levels. Good luck vault dweller!
---
Watoga for sure I‚Äôm missing one arm on my 51 and torso on t60 .
---
Anybody have an extra one I‚Äôm on Xbox 
---
These things happen. Curious if it's an issue on pc as well. Can't wait till it's fixed.
---
How come people haven't had a come to Jesus moment with the anti-scorched mods? They MELT SBs. 
---
Slap that on a combat rifle or Handmade and that mosquito is going down. 
---
Yeah, its called having basic standards of what a $60 product should be.
---
Fixing things that should never have made it into release is not an "improvement" especially not when the patch that just came out 10 minutes ago once again fucked up scrapping bulked items.
---
I uninstalled a couple of days ago, sadly. But i'll hopefully be back with a new character in a few months after some improvements!
---
I never actually said that. Merely pointed at the factual evidence you can find EVERYWHERE if you just hop onto google. F76 reuses all the assets from Fallout 4, sounds like a glorified mod to me man lol. I would consider you in denial if you can‚Äôt even admit to the factual short comings of F76. The fact you disregard everything I say (even if true) kinda makes you a fan boy. Actually the fact you call a universally bad game a ‚Äúgreat game‚Äù sounds very fanboy. All the downvotes on your ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great game‚Äù comment shows how much people disagree with you but I guess they haven‚Äôt played 400 plus hours like apparently the ‚Äúmajority‚Äù of people who bought the game did lol.
---
That was my second guess lol
---
Yeah I was specced right. My TSE Level 50 Combat Rifle took 4-8 shots to kill enemies over level 50 non SB or SBQ. My handemade was the same. My Pump Shotgun was 2-3 Shot everything But SB SBQ.
---
Shotgun where broke because each pellet did max damage. So if it said you did 1200 dps like my TSE did. Each Pellet Did 1200 Damage.
---
Bloodied needs a build and instigating is 1 shot.
---
I have tse, it was blatantly op and the game is better after the nerf.
---
Every company has a different definition. When my company does it  there is downtime.
---
Why not buff the base version of the all the weapons, so we won‚Äôt need to farm in a disgraceful annoying way legendary effects ? Why not make the base game better, so that we can happily play without having to grind resources 70% of our time to play 30 % of it the way we want ? I would happily drop all my legendary in a paper bag, if I could use the crafted weapons for killing things alive.   
---
I've never used White Knight since I have more important things I need the Agility points on. And the only times I use power armor are in nuke zones and silos. Yet, my armor rarely breaks during a multi-hour game session and I always have enough ballistic fiber to fix it. Having it break every half hour just seems crazy. Do you not use stealth, cover, or positioning at all and just tank all the incoming damage while pounding back stimpacks non-stop?
---
"fuck up" They said they would change it so bulk boxes  could get scraped and be used easier for crafting. what you meant to write was "WHY DIDN'T THEY READ OUR MINDS"
---
An advantage that is available to all players. 
---
Now hold up. Unless you shoot one bullet a second then I will outperform your build with no maxed perks. Handmade without legendaries was a very sought after recipe, the gun is very good. 
---
complaining about a game you might be enjoying isn't entitlement, it's you wanting the game to become better.
---
Lots of people love FO76 or WoW for example, and just want those games to improve.
---
It literally happened with overwatch banning people with names in support of trump.
---
It was a massive story so either you're a liar or just really desperate to defend million dollar businesses.
---
Throw on Fireproof *3 and youll never worry about them again.
---
You can even stand there as they incessantly spam and take little damage.
---
Once i learned that i now hunt those fucks. No more running away and dying in three spams from them
---
Get 99 fishing on RuneScape. Would not recommend lmao
---
Depends on the weapon.
---
Explosive is still really good for multi-hit big damage weapons (like shotguns, dragons, or harpoon Fletchettes.)
---
Ooootherwiiiiiiise... Yeah. It's barely "good" now.
---
Where?
---
Usually when I log in, my hat is off. Or helmet if in excavator armor. 
---
No big deal unless I drop right into a battle. 
---
Great. Can't wait for the fish duping. 
---
I applaud you for your honesty and anger towards BETH for punishing the innocent.  Very selfless of you.  I still play though, incase anyone thinks im on a " dont play fo76" band wagon.
---
I just sat down for an hour after getting home from work. Such. regret. If only I could follow Bethesda 24/7 perhaps I'd be playing right now. 
---
BuY mUh caNvAS bAG
---
Just exited the game immediately when I noticed this. Absolutely unacceptable. I was perfectly playing the game as is. But this is a whole new level of ineptitude. 
---
Cool, i‚Äôm just letting you know, that not a correct use of the word...
---
No problem, just a shame I can't really give anymore concrete details on how or why they might be occurring. Here's hoping everything works out in the end!
---
If you compare idiots posting on reddit to Bethesda's actual employees, then yeah, I guess they are actually expert game designers.
---
I'm not. I'm trying to spread awareness. I'm likely not even going to play anymore.
---
No but there is a top dog that approves it. Either a product manager or project manager, thats how it works.
---
They did some kind of chargeback that obviously Bethesda hasn't picked up on or can't associate to the specific user account and are bragging about how they still have access to the game...
---
In other words: shitpost.
---
This happened to me in DCUO on PS4 i started playing a week or so after the ps3 outage for a motnh or whatever it was, paid for a 2nd month after and cancelled my sub. 
---
Noticed that I had access to the first DLC fight for the light after it was put out and i hadn't subbed, kept access to that and all the other DLC's after that until SOE changed back to Daybreak games.
---
The game went F2P because it was loosing customers and offered the dlcs as part of the premium membership or whatever it was and me and a few others in the league that spoke about it all still had free access to everything. 
---
Shows what a bad dev team that no one challenges can do to a game, went free 2 play as not enough cash but couldn't work out that they weren't charging people for it.
---
I almost felt bad for them, but John Smedly is the anti christ of gaming and SWG fans worldwide so couldn't have happened to a nicer guys company.
---
Low endurance equals higher chance for diseases. I always have diseases.

I want a fishing boat &gt;:(
---
I don't really get it, as far as I know AA doesn't actually affect E damage.
---
There was better was to get the results they want and make the community happy.
---
Yay!  1.09 update just finished installing!
---
I've got a TSE also and I never used it because the game was better with my QE.
---
Now my commando build sucks and so does Fallout 76.
---
Well someone has to do something, because Bethesda sure ain't acting like one.
---
You can lie to yourself, but the rest of us aren't listening and don't give a shit.
---
well i was just replying to the 760 hours being impossible, did not go into it further or looked at 7600 hours, just saying hitting 760 right now with how long the games been out is totally possible for anyone. If they spend all their free time on it even with a job.
---
While a small percentage. it is a captive audience. It is an interaction platform. 
---
I meant I can't play when the servers are down. I can't even download anything while the servers are down. I wasn't referring to any download as there was none.
---
And actually I thought the servers would be down longer, hours, like during normal patches. I just tried to play just when the servers went down, so there was no note about how long it would take. And obviously thus I didn't hang around to notice how fast they resume operation. It was mere 14 MB for PC, still took more than hour from me.
---
And fuck up the lore completely? Nope!
---
HARK BELIEVERS OUR MESSIAH HATH SPOKEN!!!  Once again GREAT post man!!!  For those of you here of the same mindset that haven't found us over at r/fo76FilthyCasuals I'd encourage you to have a look.  Our Sub was started as a reaction to  [u/nevetando](https://www.reddit.com/user/nevetando) first post along the same lines.  We are just a bunch of people who play the game as it is not as it others SAY it should be.  Does it have issues? Sure it does.  Have they bungled some stuff?  YEP!  But a LOT of us still find it enjoyable to play.  The incessant hate and frustration in here is mind-boggling.  
---
As a comedian, I enjoy listening to said, "If you don't like it, then MAKE YOUR OWN!"

But if you require respite come on over to the LIGHT side...We have cookies....(ok we don't really)
---
FFXIV and ESO absolutely take the cake when it comes to visuals in the MMO world. If I could marry FFXIV's dungeon mechanics with ESO's world and quest writing, then maintain both of their visual qualities, I'd have the perfect MMO, in my opinion. 
---
Thanks, that is what I just have seen. Just tired of waiting cause I play every day and things move too slowly without real new satisfaction. Even if I still like this game, my disgust of Beth grows more these days. Definitely not buying other Beth game before long time and certainly not atoms. Half angry, half sad 
---
Complaining is fine.
---
Thinking having more hours into the game makes your complaint more important is entitlement.
---
lol I didn't know that about Workshop PVP. What a mess 
---
That's kind of OP.  Super duper to give you a small boost to success rate.  
---
Ok, not kind of, that's super fucking OP.  
---
I still kinda like the idea.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about if you can't see this as being a fuck up or a notable issue.
---
There is always the Hello Games route. Release empty game, say and do nothing for an entire year. And then release regular content updates that completely revive the game and make it amazing.
---
Well here's the thing they make money off of their current games. They still sell quite a bit of the fallout and elder scrolls series as well as make money from micro transactions. But to run a good business you have to invest in other things they have assets and stocks and other investments. This game was not solely to fund elder scrolls and even then that didn't give them the reason to fuck it up. It would be ignorant to think that.
---
That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying Bethesda needs to reevaluate the ban system to make it more fair.
---
I meant that I used buff out drugs for a short time. They were used one at a time. Melee builds are better than what I'm using for sure, but being able to kite helps some of the time. I was thinking of trying out a cryolator that could push out decent dmg in repsonse to melee builds. 
---
Assuming everyone on this subreddit is level 50 or higher would be a poor assumption to make. My one and only character is currently level 28; I stopped playing when my friends did, and won't return until the mess that is this game is improved. I follow the news here to see if that will ever happen. I am far from alone in that.
---
Have you never played another online game before? Taking weeks to put together basic bug fixes is extremely common, some "basic" bugs persist for months or longer before they're finally fixed. Usually because what most players consider to be a basic bug fix actually involves a shit-ton of work trying to figure out exactly what's causing the problem and how to fix it without negatively affecting anything else, and the bug is minor enough or rare enough that it takes a backseat to more pressing bugs. Gamers complaining about "easy bug fixes" are as insightful as [the meme](https://i.imgur.com/xNWld3g.jpg) about using coding and algorithms to prevent drones from crashing into each other.

Why the H8 for Pipe Revolvers? Just because they aren‚Äôt on *Legendary Loot Table|s*? /s
---
No need to feel guilty or even care. Bethesda surely doesn't care about you or it's player base. After the amount of crashes, freezes, lost gears and weapons, everything deserves to play it for free (Those that actually want to). You have done your time .. either keep playing or play something but definitely don't feel guilty ..
---
Maybe leave the comedy to the comedians, huh? :P
---
I don't think anyone needs a degree and 5+ years experience in the field to know that ideally, your scrap would stay in whatever form you choose to put it in, unless you choose otherwise.
---
Seems pretty simple really.
---
I completely disagree. Devs, Support reps, even escalation managers can file an internal defect/ticket/bug with the provided infor and it gets the same treatment. 
---
Source: I manage escalations over various industries, technologies and ticketing systems.
---
Not only that, but ran into a duper for a trade the other day and he didn‚Äôt specialize in TSE, he had 1000s of every bloodied, Anti-armor,etc. along with every outfit,etc. so nerfing tse was useless. People don‚Äôt understand that in a few weeks, it will just be something else in the crosshairs. Nerfs should never happen, period. They are just a way to cover a problem that they have no idea how to fix.
---
Wow you missed a lot
---
Please explain How. Also melee is the true problem
---
No, that's not what you said, and the ban system is fine, they just need to evaluate appeals faster.
---
I am not lvl 100 yet, so I haven't been able to (not lvl 50's), till now at least, and I'm still only lvl 95.
---
I believe you were supposed only be able to pacify those half your level. But now there seems to be no restriction.
---
It's funny you mention that.....lol
---
I'm on the FO76 Market and FO76 Bazzar trading reddits all the time.
---
There's a guy on there that specifically advertises his Leveling Weapons.  It's not duped stuff either.  Just decent rolls on lower level items that he sells to people for caps so they can bring up alts easier :)
---
p.s.  Good on you for giving that weapon to a noobie that needed it.  Even if you did or did not know them, I bet they appreciated it!
---
Well, usually the person making the claim has the burden of proof. Since that's the OP, I'd look to them. However, for the sake of internet arguments:
---
Patches and hotfixes. If they game is dead and a cash grab, what could they possibly achieve by continuing to update and patch the game? They are spending resources and payroll on people working to improve and update the game. (regardless of how effective they are or your opinion on what changes they have made)
---
Continued advertising. I see ads for this game in various places. Those cost money.
---
Survival mode. Why release an entire new game mode if you just want to suck as much as you can from initial sales and the Atom store.
---
I may be able to think of more. Let me know. ;)
---
I‚Äôm being honest and open minded but you seem like one of the close minded ones.
---
Well, Fallout 76 was the third or fourth most sold game in November. That's just physical copies by the way. So it sold quite a lot, don't know how much exactly. Of those players, how many do you reckon like Fallout and Reddit? Most people in that group would likely find /r/Fallout or some more popular games subreddit. Then take an even smaller group of people who like 76 specifically and go to this subreddit. It's logical to assume that if you specify a quality from a population, the sample with that quality must be at least equal to or smaller than the population.
---
I just really doubt that 100,000 people would make up a significant portion of players, assuming all 100,000 actively participate of course and haven't just forgotten to unsubscribe. 
---
intentional or incompetence?
---
I was hoping we would get one last in the 'darkness' theme last week but all we got was a princess bed.
---
I want my X01 PA painted like a mothman then you can apply the red or purple headlamp/eyes to match.
---
What about The rad worms issue??? Now whenever I get rad worms it increases all debuffs on my mutations by 25%. Also, for some reason my raider Armor duplicated my xo1 Armor, and now I have 2 sets of identical x01 Armor. 
---
For someone that comes across as a typical FO76 fanboy, you should really try reading and listening to the games holotapes and terminal entries more.
---
You still have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Whitesprings or level 40 mole miners in uranium fever?
---
Brilliant :)
---
Really? I would have thought the 100 throwing knives would all have identical IDs? If you're right then I understand how completely stuffed it is.
---
&gt;The legal and monetary issues surrounding allowing modders to change the game are huge.
---
theirs no legal or monetary issues  , modding exists and will still exist long after F076 dies 
---
I consistently get radworms (Thanks level 68 charred ghouls!)
---
and i have every mutation but carnivore.
---
Ive never had radworms affect anything other than charred ghouls attacks become way more powerful
---
Yooo i chose benny too
---
Because ring a ding ding baby... and the monologue in the beginning
---
On one hand, I kinda hope they don't fix it because since this went down all of their games have only been like, 12 dollars.
---
You actually have more shotgun perks them I did. I only had 1 rank of each.
---
It doesn't make any sense to me as to why I was 1 shotting things and you weren't.
---
Except this. I was pretty close to the enemy and would jump and shoot so pretty sure all my pellets hit. Because if I didn't do that w the crazy spread on that gun I'd blow myself up half the time if I tried to shoot it normally. 
---
They looked like this before the patch.
---
Only two decimals display in the UI.
---
Chances are it's just the same glitch they already fixed once, but it got rolled back in this weeks patch like the bobby pin fix. Assume that means they just need to actually merge the missing stuff into the newest patch branch and it will be fixed again.
---
I'm looking forward to getting away from the sneakcreeps that stalk and slapsnipe...
---
I don't know what your situation was, but I did quite a few scrap alls yesterday and din't have that problem. 
---
For PC. Not for consoles.
---
If you guys have so many issues with the game and Bethesda why not just sop playing it?
---
makes sense 
---
Country Rooooooooooooads, Take Me Home
---
you like a bad video game
---
Unpopular opinion but I don‚Äôt really mind that. I‚Äôve had a lot of fun beta testing this hot mess. Honestly I wish they would have just flagged it as early access from the start. They still would have had massive sales and about 50% less drama. 
---
I didn't give a shit about the bobby pin weight. And never understood why people cared. I carry 8 bobby pins on me and have 10 in my stash. I never break more than 2 bobby pins before finding 10 more, which I just sell. Do people really suck at the lockpicking minigame that much? 
---
Anyways, this hotfix was addressing nothing that bugged me at all but I was happy they were trying to appease the community.
---
But the fact that they added in this new bug, just speaks volumes about their capabilities as a development team. More so than any other fuck up so far. At least to me.
---
I just want to point out that the Beta is counted seperately. So this is post release. But lets look at similar stats from other games(Ill just pick some well known ones):
---
Spider-Man 94.7% defeated the first boss(its basically the intro)
---
Skyrim 83.1% of players completed Unbound(left that first cave in Helgen)
---
Horizon Zero Dawn 93.7% of players finished the intro
---
GTA V 76.3% got the first story achievement
---
Dragon Ball XV2 88.4% of players defeated the first opponent(Raditz)
---
Doom 80.7% completed the first mission
---
Nier Automata 84.9% of players got the first achievement
---
God of War 93.9 % of players defeated the intro biss
---
My conclusion: only the PS4 exclusive titles reached numbers above 90%. It seems normal that a game only reaches between 80% and 90%, and FO76s 87.8% seem to be totally fine.
---
I guess GTA V scores lower because many people either play singleplayer but not the story mode, or they play the multiplayer part only and never touched the singleplayer.
---
I have the same impression as you. My handmade rifle is 4x weaker than my action lever rifle but the latter breaks so quickly. 
---
"Get knowledge" ok
---
Was NoAutoScrapJunk what was keeping Bulk junk from being scrapped from "scrap all junk?"
---
You sir, are a superstar!
---
We have no way of knowing if they are still playing or not. I'm sure a lot of players stopped playing after a few hours and are not coming back because White Knight was nerfed.
---
Uhh, banning political things is pretty common in games, so yea, names with a political nature can definitely get shut down and with good reason. That is a long-standing policy with many publishers and I think most people support it which is why it's still around. I don't want to game with someone named MexicansAreRapists or MAGA or BuildThatWall or any other dumb sleaze associated with that manic tangerine. 
---
I'm not desperate to do anything right now but smoke a bean and play Fallout 76. And I'm gonna do that. You, however, should learn to reign in your word choices and big claims. Maybe then people will be more apt to engage with you and not think you're a lunatic claiming corporations have "absolute power" over us because of a gd EULA most people are never affected by in the first place. I mean what, did you expect me to join an uprising because some people tried to bring politics into a game and got shut down for it? xD
---
222
---
What, no. Guns are absolute junk. Snipers got a huge stealth nerf too.
---
Who cares about logging in? We already bought the game, it won't make any difference if you continue playing or not. As long as you refrain from giving Bethesda more money via Atom shop, it's fine.
---
Bloodied explosive pipe bolt action with low hp build and mutations. 
---
 We're also looking to adjust laser weapon durability in a future update.  
---
I hope they wont forget plasma heavy weapons that suffer more from durability
---
Guess I'm no casual, then. Or all the people I play with. Maybe it's just a definition issue. I understand casual players as people who don't rush towards endgame content and instead enjoy the game... casually. I don't have to be the best with the ultimate gear to have fun. 
---
yep, it's not new...
---
I dont like this idea at all. For one thing, it is too easy to buff atats, and that creates loopholes and balance challenges, etc. Too risky. Second, I dont want to have to max INT just to be good at my weapon. It needlessly kills build diversity.
---
If you want high-int players to be more likely to be better with energy weapons, give optional but desirable perk cards that help energy weapons and that are based on INT. Like maybe an INT perk called Energy Scalpel that gives armor penetration on energy weapons. Balance it to be useful, and to stack with Tank Killer etc. Or maybe a perk called Machine Harvest that, if slotted when you make a kill on a Robot or Turret, it gives a chance for finding some energy weapon ammo on the target.
---
These ideas may not be perfect, but you get the idea. Making damage on energy weapons scale with INT just kills some character concepts you probably havent thought of. Like my Laser Commando I have planned who has Int 6 and uses energy weapons from stealth. I dont want to feel obligated to move 9 points around on my build just to make you happy. I would rather have some energy weapon perks, and then I can make the call on how important they are to me.
---
good idea!
---
That wasn‚Äôt the point.
---
I have one account for everything on [battle.net](https://battle.net), because I don't hack or break tos, so why would I go though this hopes and possibility extra security risk 
---
Run from high levels. I have had many experiences with just getting blown away while in pacifist mode for no reason. If you get approached by one or a group of them I suggest running and logging out asap.
---
I never bought from a duper..
---
What happened to the "not paying to win" scenario? Getting a 15% health bonus per team member by wearing an Unstoppables outfit which is purchased with atoms seems to be exactly paying for an edge to me.
---
Don‚Äôt forget they ruin server stability.
---
Nerf the nukes to bring them more in line with pipe rifle level server stability.
---
I seriously want to see someone pacify a queen. 
---
To add to that since they are not on Steam they need to record that information for investors to show them if a product is doing well or not. 
---
Then do it. Do it, do it, do it, do it!
---
If anyone is leaving playstation, can I have your stuff? 
---
Ark did that with mods, and the people loved it.  They found the most popular mods and integrated them into the game.
---
Players got content, modders got paid, and the studio didn't have to work as hard.
---
Everyone wins :)
---
p.s.  However having the modders completely take over would be a disaster.  They don't have access to all of the source code.  So one modder would add something that another modder would counteract.  Another modder would add something that made all of the player inventory disappear.  You need the studio to test, and work on, and integrate the mods.
---
There are some in life whom you may mistreat and abuse and they won't ever raise a hand in their own defense. In ancient times we called them "Slaves", now, we call them Bethesdrones.
---
Lmao. You stopped playing because of other people complaining? What a weird way to live your life. Using Reddit as a guide for anything honestly seems like an absolutely terrible idea. This sub especially likes to key up the drama to the nth degree for everything. 
---
So you can't. Next time you make claims, come prepared.
---
Derp. I just said that. It doesn‚Äôt matter in the context that you were initially being a smartass about in that it doesn‚Äôt skew the math, it effects durability and damage output. My observation wasn‚Äôt about how much damage the gun does at different levels it was about how demolition expert affects the damage output. Sorry you have such a hard time understanding context.
---
This is my second character, been on since BETA, your comment was stupid af gtfo. 
---
I didn't imply that you did. I mean in general. 
---
I never really had a good reason to spend caps or even to make caps at end game. Now that I have access to so many plans, thanks to the changes, I have a reason to spend the money I've casually amassed and have been hoarding. I actually finally found plans at a vendor for some chems I really wanted.

I will, so we're back to negative. Lol

They don't care about that. They get off on making the hit. In their mind, they totally got you.

Have you not noticed that happening?

Posiedon Energy has a concrete extractor in its workshop
---
This has happened to me for over a month and nothing ever fixes it. Always my left leg, which is annoying af because I have calibrated shocks and only use my PA to fast travel when overencumbered and for nuke zones.
---
more like you need to go to jail. I hate people that steal money through chargebacks.
---
Physical copies =/= still remaining players. Also achievement %s are skewed by accounts who quit the game immediately 
---
First you lied to me and said it didn't happen at all and now you're saying it's a long standing policy in all games (ps: it's not. You're lying through your teeth yet again.)
---
So what's your story now? You've blatantly lied to me twice and both times called me crazy for something you admit exist.
---
Go fuck yourself.
---
Head to r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Its packed with people not exploding with immaturity and the attitude of a petulant child.
---
I've had a great time and almost everyone i speak to in game feels the same way. Fo76 is seemingly full of trolls, people who haven't played the game and angry people just wanting to twist the dagger more because they still aren't happy yet.
---
I'm not seeing any of these insanely low deals for recipes on any trading subreddit I frequent for any platform. I am seeing some periodic large drops, though, which are a bit uncharacteristic given the steady demand for those recipes (3k is pretty uncharacteristically low per recipe). I hope they aren't being duped en masse because that would be a real hit to the economy for these plans.

Confirmed on XB1.  Scrap All will unbulk items in your personal inventory.

He said he "loves strafing an juking around  an enemy while hearing the sound of gunfire" and you depict him as a happy camper... What's your problem ? Can't you just read ?
---
And it seems that for you, fun means being rewarded (the "not fun" 5 rounds back and wood armor) ? Fighting can be fun, the action of fighting can be fun not the reward after fight. 
---
Sorry to hear about your rl problems but all I can say is that‚Äôs the game. There is no end game content besides continually grinding sbq or a few other nuke spots. So when people get bored others may suffer. That‚Äôs how the game is setup. 
---
yeah but ...bobby pins...
---
Prob same guy.. def same inventory. Plus, they ruined my pa hunting by putting it all in vendor. Good thing u didnt pay 20k for those T60 feet!
---
your point?
---
If they implemented different high level bosses for each nuked zone i think plenty of people would shut up for a moment.
---
Someone launched a nuke near my camp deep in the Mire...all it spawned were some regular ass stingwings that two level 200+ cleared in one second.
---
I knew it was a waste but near my camp so i grabbed some flowers. 
---
Make it a Mega Mirelurk Queen that eats bullets like a SBQ and now were talking.
---
Her buffed acid attacks would melt even the one shotters. Itd be a real fight. thats just one zone. 
---
Pssst, your decimal is in the wrong place. It now takes 1000 bobby pins to equal 1 pound.
---
Where do you see the number of hours ?
---
I uninstalled the launcher

Current problem = fixed

Future problems = fixed

Pff no. I steamroll over anyone with a gun in their hands. Even AAE shotguns and the FE Minigun are worthless to bring.
---
Yeah, they're going a little crazy with working on bug fixes and nerfs.....lol
---
Gotta get some content in there.  Something to see, do, explore, enjoy :)
---
Better drop all your Bobby pins so you're not exploiting risking a ban

Me and a friend for FO76 on sale for ¬£8 from CDkeys. 
---
It was a daily deal and for ¬£8 we have both said we accept it's a flawed game but we both almost bought it on release for ¬£60 and had we done that, we both would have wanted a refund or for them to fix all the bugs and issues. 
---
¬£8 for this game to me is a reasonable price, ¬£50/¬£60 is not.

After the patch I am having issues with the audio. I own 2 xbox controllers. My primary controller has the headphone adapter. If my headphone is plugged into the adapter I will hear audio and when I unplug my headphones the audio cuts out.  The audio will be their  for roughly 5 secs than cut off. I will go into settings and switch it to auto than back to none to see if it will resolve it but it will cut off. Would the issue be in the adapter, headphones or controller. The controller is up to date in firmware. I am only having this issue with Fallout 76.

I actually did buy the plan off somebody for 20k lol..

&gt; The Dragon 	Black powder rifle 	Chance to cripple. Extra limb damage. 
---
Do you realize that Bethesda had the complete right to contest the chargeback but instead chose to ignore it, and legally that means they forfeit the money? You might want to research how chargebacks work.
---
Things are acting wierd since the patch, especially if you have radworms.  I equipped my 3 lockpick cards to do a level 3 safe and it said my level was 4.  For a while my game was acting like all my perk cards were equipped, inventory weight went down by 300 pounds, perk animations were popping up for weapon and armor repair, and the mysterious stranger showed up and I didn't even realize I had that card.
---
Then when radworms expires, things go way down below normal, so maybe that's what happened to you.  It should get corrected by relogging.
---
Amen 
---
I haven't been paying close attention since getting my excavator armor, but I had a full set of t60 pretty early. 
---
There's a farmhouse up in the north with a shed near it and another way back behind it. You have to search around to get a key for the 2nd shed. Check there. 
---
&gt;They're a company that has had nothing but success all these years, and now that they're experiencing serious backlash for the first time, they're on full damage control mode.
---
Is anyone actually surprised by this?  They did the exact same thing after Elder Scrolls Online launched (and during the beta leading up to it), the only difference was "Zenimax Online Studios" vs "Bethesda Game Studios" - same publisher, same higher-ups making the final decision on things.
---
Hell, you even have the *same damn problem* that ESO had with your account name being visible to everyone, alongside a refusal to implement 2FA to help alleviate part of the issue (at the time, I don't think they've done anything to fix it since even after many of us clamored for it).
---
ESO took a year or more to get their act somewhat together, based on what people who stuck it out have said, but that also involved them shifting from a "buy the game + monthly subscription" model to the model FO76 currently uses - "buy the game + ingame shop".  They're gonna have a seriously hard time making it up to players any time soon, and the communication has only marginally improved.
---
Ran into something similar the same day the patch came out. Was at Dryer Chem. and we ran into a scorched gulper. He just ran directly away from us to the NE and didn't take any damage. PS4
---
Because it takes 30 bullets in the head for a 68 super mutant to go down while his other 3 buddies have their miniguns on you
---
Hey Bethesda, whoever is in charge of 76,
---
Fuck you buddy
---
I still have no clue why they even messed with this.  All we wanted was for MODS to not auto-scrap.  I think that was loud and clear.  Bulk was working fine.
---
Physical copies =/= still remaining players. Also achievement %s are skewed by accounts who quit the game immediately.
---
Many online games have massive sale numbers that dwarf in comparison to the actual active player count. This argument shouldnt be using physical copies as direct count of anyone continuing to be invested in the game.
---
260ish.
---
More invigorated to play now tbh.
---
760 hours is roughly 31 days out of 79 days (1896 hours). Thats almost 5 months of work if you work 40 hours a week. That's absolutely ridiculous.
---
stealth buff?
---
Id like a server browser so i can get all my friends/community in the same lobby. PvP in this game is best when everyone wants to be apart of it. Like building a war dome and everyone using boxing gloves. Or taking bets who can launch the furthest off a flinging trap from a mountain. 
---
Can we just hire some of these modders?! 
---
Go to your challenges and there should be one for hours played that will list it.
---
No. The "we", are mad about TSE nerfs and that. I was glad of them. But as everyone else was complaining I figured I have now a good reason to, too. Heh.
---
Plus they really should have waited, the hotfix fixed nothing even remotely relevant, while because of how they messed up some branches, there could very well be major problems left that got reintroduced on the patch, and doing hotfix now, will pretty likely mean they won't do any Friday, and then it's weeked...
---
Lets just hope there isn't any major problems, the rad worm bug can be taken positively advantage of. Have fun.
---
Was a hot fix just before allegedly 
---
My end game currently is milking the queen‚Äôs scorched spawns of sloths, yao guis, mireluke queens/kings.
---
Watching others fight the queen until it‚Äôs like 5 minutes left, then I finish the queen off. 
---
Yeah I agree, give the death claw island a prime fissure for a Death Claw King, or behemoth lake w/ a prime fissure for a Colossal Behemoth.
---
Truth is, the game was shit from the start. 
---
Don't buy either of those and instead wait for Outer Worlds.
---
Yeah.  This is new from them "fixing" stuff.
---
Probably is not definitely and I run a player store. 
---
Just opened this evening before the maintenance started - out over the weekend - open for business Monday 7pm 
---
if you had rad worms then lost is, the effects went even more whack. all my mutation positives and negatives were buffed with that disease and once it was gone i lost more positive then i was even gaining. i was literally jumping less then regular. it was whack. 
---
hope hotfix fixes even though its not listed. 
---
Bethesda number cruncher's probably do though...or at least they should, unless of course there just as good as the rest of the Bethesda Team :)
---
They just put out an update. It‚Äôs not like they aren‚Äôt being active 
---
I will grant you that.
---
400 ish
---
Have a level 130 Single Shot ranged character and a level 170 Melee main.
---
Was going to say this, the inward is if you get snowed in and have to get out.
---
Twice now you have called yourself a fanboy so glad we agree there. You are entitled to your opinion but that doesn‚Äôt mean I have to agree with you.
---
Has the look and feel of a New Vegas interior. I like !
---
These guys slapsnipe from long range, fade away and you never even see them. They don't care if they kill you because they "totally would have if it was a realistic game". Have you not noticed that?
---
From what I have hear No Man's Sky got a lot better. I have to trust the 100s of people I heard say that, never played it myself. No doubt 76 will even out and get better. I just want to avoid the frustration that comes with drastic change. It felt as though all the fun was sucked out of the game in an instant. Perhaps in a few weeks I will feel like giving it another go, but right now I am just too frustrated.
---
Any way you could share your build? I'm new to playing around with Melee and trying to figure everything out and would appreciate it.
---
They've already nerfed guns so melee is significantly better at this point
---
That sucks. I like using it. I guess I'll have to try something new.
---
Explosive effect is what made guns viable over melee. The first month of the game there were a lot of complaints about melee being the only viable option. 
---
I hope that they just buff guns overall, and leave explosive as a small damage increase but still has the benefit of explosive AOE
---
If you are crafting thousands of weapons for mods , you are doing it wrong. I know almost every mod in the game and i just break down the weapons i loot. So im not sure why people are crafting thousands of weapons. 
---
If what you say is true then its needs changed. But this sub is packed with people who exaggerate, lie, and bash the game. So its hard to believe stuff sometimes 
---
I nominate this for best feature not a bug of 2019 rofl let's all go get red worms fighting ghouls at Whitespring!!!
---
Frankly, TSE needed a nerf either way, and anyone complaining about that can suck it. But Bethesda really could have just made demo expert not apply to explosive legendary effects and it would have solved that problem without screwing up every other explosive/grenade build.
---
Yeah suppose. But explosive perks affected explosive legendary in Fallout 4 so it was fairly obvious they would have same here. 
---
Not realizing how broken things would end up when you have combination of TS and E, plus perks on top of it.
---
&gt;ay 
---
Yesterday the patch made it so bulked items would not automatically scrap (as they did previously) when you were crafting or repairing items.
---
So they issued a "hotfix" which rather than restore the original behavior instead makes it so all bulked items in your inventory get scrapped if you use the scrap all command.
---
Remember when everyone thought Roadhog got nerfed into obsolescence? 
---
I will never understand those people that post the big long dramatic farewells. 
---
Another interesting thing is how impossible it is for people to accept that other people like something they don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been called a fascist, a fanboy, and ffs seriously I‚Äôve been called a Trump supporter in this very sub because I like the game. I‚Äôm not even kidding. They used my flare as justification for that one. Or they just tell me I‚Äôm deluding myself into thinking that I like the game because (insert ridiculous reason here). Like some people can‚Äôt fathom that their opinion is subjective. 
---
I like the game. It‚Äôs ok guys. It‚Äôs ok for me to like a game that you‚Äôre mad at. I think it needs a LOT of work but I genuinely enjoy logging in and messing around every day. It‚Äôs ok if you don‚Äôt like the game. We can disagree and still peacefully discuss the flaws and features. 
---
Thanks, mate! &lt;3
---
Too much salt isn't good for the heart. You should take a break :)
---
Moving your camp causing overlapping blueprints (which was labeled as a damn *exploit* by Bethesda, like that's not a slap in the face) is a major  and common bug with one of the most basic systems of the game (this should have just been fixed, thankfully).
---
My power armor unequipping itself every time I fast travel is a minor, but common bug with one of the most basic systems of the game.
---
There have been multiple broken events that flat out didn't work, like Protest March. Major and common bug with a basic game system.
---
I can keep going.
---
I said for every bug which we will call x there is a x^10 that another bug comes around
---
You guys are awesome I love reading these. 
---
This^
---
I mean all guns when I say rifles btw
---
Apologies don‚Äôt fix a darn thing. 
---
Military ammo bags and military grade tapes give ballistic fiber
---
honestly this is the kind of post we need more of in this subreddit. A viable alternate perspective that offers insight and a chance for constructive debate. I preordered FO76 but after playing for quite a bit of time post launch I got burnt out. The past couple weeks I havent been playing much of it. I dont have a level 200 character. I thnk Im level 60 something. I dont have a handmade or the plans for it. I havent even finished the main questline. I browse the subreddit for patch notes and posts like these that offer insight and discussion. 
---
But if i were to log on today and find my camp missing or my inventory gone or some other horrible bug affecting my data I dont think id be that upset. I kind of prepare for that every time I load up because its a bethesda game (which deserves a whole nother post). There will be a patch and it may fuck even more shit up. Ill just play something else until bethesda figures their shit out. If you spent a lot of money on higher tiered editions than I understand youre frustration. This supposed final product is nowhere near a final product and you deserve to be heard. As for me, I've gotten my moneys worth.
---
1000x yes!   
---
People here act like they work in the industry when they clearly do not. I'm sure these people are the same ones who get their Medical Degrees from Facebook.   
---
If you have a major issue with the game then let Bethesda know through their customer service rather than making a long winded post about how "They should just fire their staff and hire modders to do the work for them".    
---
Give Bethesda a minute to make it right. It's going to take a moment because things have to go through certifications. Most people don't understand that certifications take time. Of course they aren't going to get it right every single time, but what game ever has?
---
I carry 4 gatling plasma's for 1 SBQ fight. I thought that was just how they worked. Lol. With bear arms its like 10 pounds for each. Weapon Artisan is a must though, you can get 2 clips per.... LOL. 
---
That was more a general rant towards practically all the other threads. 
---
As a grenadier, yes that is exactly how I play.  I take the damage so others don't have to and can keep their sniping positions.  Usually its healing salves and diluted stimpacks.  
---
Punctuation. Please.
---
Looks like we need another Hotfix
---
Planters. You have no idea how much I miss planters.
---
For me it just seems like they‚Äôre healing weirdly compared to they were 
---
I agree all guns depending on the gun. Needs a 25-35% Base Damage Buff. That would make other Legendary Guns more Valuable and useful.
---
Well I know my husband will to. So take that suckaaaa!

According to Bethesda, oversized stash limits place extra load on the server, it could be assumed overlimit characters do as well.  The first sentence kicks in.  To play your silly game, the second sentence kicks in, SHOW ME WHERE ZENIMAX authorized your use of a mule? So you can't? next time come prepared.
---
Your in denial about your actions, its okay.  
---
People used to sell them all the time on the discord and trading subreddits.
---
It's just short of one shoting bloated ones (with no shotgun perks, that's perfectly acceptable imo)
---
The people complaining there is nothing to do are fallout fans who only want to play solo. Ive wasted 200 hours just fucking around with friends. 
---
What OP is describing is a fairly standard industry workflow. I'm not in the game development business myself, but I have two friends who were (one worked for Tellatale - RIP - and the other used to be on the Guild Wars 2 dev team before she left for less stressful and more lucrative work) and from what I've heard from them, this rings pretty true. The dev team itself very probably knows there are serious issues and are definitely some long hours leading to  stupid mistakes, but they're almost certainly doing their best... with a management team that is putting them through hell and not giving them the resources that they need. That was certainly the case for both of my friends, especially the one who worked for Telltale.
---
yikes
---
Lmao if you think they plan on supporting this game over the next 10 years especially with it's awful sales you're too far down the rabbit hole to see sense üòî
---
And sorry but tons of people have been constructive with their ideas myself included but that doesn't do anything, heck even modders who have literally sent Bethesda the code needed to fix some of their bugs get ignored because Bethesda literally does not care. I'm not sure why some people delude themselves into thinking they do it's sad. 
---
&gt;The only thing that's not fair about the hot fix is that it comes right after I sold more than a hundred bobby pins to a vendor.
---
That's what most people should do. There's no point to have a lot of them. Also the bug didn't affect ther weight in your inventory. It was displaying 0.1 but real weight was probably the old 0.001. That 0.1 was in effect only on your stash.
---
Something seemed off when I last harvested corn. I guess that would be it.
---
Ok thanks 
---
It ain‚Äôt the best, but i have a legendary barber walking cane with all 3 star gladiator perks and incisor equipped and i can kill almost anything (except scorchbeasts) within 2-3 hits 
---
Thank you for the reply. While I do not agree with your point of view, everyone is welcome to their opinion. And that is why the upvote/downvote system works. Have a great day.
---
I think we‚Äôre having logical and semantic struggles. 
---
Yes. That is not contradictory. 
---
Make a topic, gain traction, give us argument to work on the ticket. 
---
Create the ticket so we have something to work upon.
---
Ideally all ranged weapons and their perks should be in one category like Perception.  Have the damage scale off that.
---
For people trying out new builds, you'd have to waste 10 levels of respec just to get your intelligence maxed to 15.
---
If you decided to go back, it's another 10 levels of respec.
---
My melee main has all the damage perks in strength, and the damage scales off strength, so it makes sense.
---
They were sought after because they are rare drops in the world and there is only one place where one spawns and even if you server hop someone else already grabbed it.
---
Up until the patch you couldn't get mods for it without scraping and you couldn't scrap them unless you were lucky to y one drop. Same thing with the radium rifle.
---
My gun was a radium Rifle. Originally I had 5 perks in rifle man until I upgraded my receiver to automatic. I was still restructuring my perk build when this update hit but was likely only going to keep 1 of each commando card because the first level gives +10% and I was leaning towards using more VATS perks as opposed to the additional 5% gains per slot. 
---
I got banned for 7 days from this sub-Reddit just a couple weeks ago when they posted patch notes and I called them out on their crap. It was funny to me. Anything negative is seen as blasphemy.
---
Care to elaborate? 
---
Well, outside of getting a proper headcount from Bethesda's servers, there's really no way of telling whether it's growing or not. This all the information we can infer from so unless you have any other ideas of for counting, feel free to tell us. I just think that of all the countable things we do have, it's best not to just dismiss it as inaccurate.
---
My xbox is not back up yet.. 
---
Possibly through the technical data quest? I would also like to know.
---
Yeah I agree but I think the emotional rants should be tagged so people who don't want to read it don't have to. 
---
I'm just glad to see that they're willing to look at general game balance. It certainly needs to start here but I hope it iterates over all aspects of the game cause there's a lot that's unbalanced.
---
It goes to show they aren't particularly rigorous about vetting changes.
---
I love the salt of people that are happy TSEs are getting nerfed. Just goes to show how infantile and petty some of the player base can be.
---
goodbye letter inc?
---
anti-scorch mod is +50% against scorched -20% against other stuff... Couple it with tank killer and a stinging or whatever magazine and it hits real hard. 
---
Sure, of course it is a niche gun, and carry weight is an issue. but it is effective. 
---
I like them...
---
Hey man I call it like it is, Maybe the game will undergo some management changes from the Roookie devs that are working on the game. In case you didn‚Äôt know, the studio working on this game was founded by zenimax and made one game that was an overwatch clone before it became Bethesda Austin. This game uses all assets from fallout 4, which is why the bugs all carried over from fallout 4, and these developers have little to no experience with the engine they are working on, just because a game plain and simply runs and has the most basic of content doesn‚Äôt mean everybody has to be satisfied with it when there‚Äôs plenty of non-AAA titles that offer far more then what this game has to offer. Honestly, for the ammount of copy/paste(figure of speech) that this game uses there should be far less bugs since the engine has been in ‚Äútesting‚Äù so to speak since the fallout 4 release, and the fact that little to nothing changed since then till after it was pointed out as a major issue in the multiplayer version of the game is pathetic. Not to mention the ballance changes go against all logic, and rather then making MORE competitive and viable builds, they just nerf what‚Äôs strong and leave all of the near useless items unchanged. It defies all logic in my eyes to patch one of the few builds considered strong because other builds under preform and few bullet spongey. This literally fixes nothing and punishes people who didn‚Äôt cheat. Because now the cheaters still have the caps to go buy the next best weapons, meanwhile we are stuck with nerfed fodder we payed an arm and a leg for to what probably was some cheater. 
---
Okay, but ‚Ä¶ I don't care.
---
How many stars on it? Perks on it?
---
Just over 100, level 75, just launched my first nuke and finished the main story quests, just mooching around discovering the places left, waiting for something more than events to do. 
---
Same, never used white knight other than to repair my armor then I take it right back off since beta. Don't even own power armor. Also don't use any of the weapon durability perks either. Its hilarious to listen to these people claim white knight was an absolute must have and now since the nerf the game is unplayable, uhm no, no its not.
---
The problem with that gun wasn't the bloodied part. Try a bloodied gun without explosive, it's damage won't be nearly that high. So all the more evidence explosive needed to be nerfed.
---
While I agree, they will report sensationalized drama without any credibility... it doesn't really change the fact with that patch launching in the first place.
---
It was a mess, and that's an understatement.
---
Will definitely try this. I did finish that questline. One of my favorites, and blade of Bastet is a beast. Thanks. 
---
So explain, I really don't understand how you can
---
They're hotfixing it today
---
They noticed to fix 3 bugs. And even failed delivering one.
---
Still nothing about the favorite items bug.
---
Still nothing about the Rad Worms affecting consumable and mutations.
---
Still nothing about ultra wide support broken again.
---
But its ok. Bobby pin now weights .001 again (y)
---
They won't advertise their duped recipes on market subreddits that ban dupers. 
---
Check xbox lfg posts. Too many there to count. 
---
So far it seems rare outfits like whitesprings jumpsuits sre the last items that have yet to be duped. 
---
A quick browse of the last frw posts gives me: hunters longcoats 100 caps (many in stock) 
---
Serums 75 caps
---
X01 jetpacks and shocks 500 each
---
Yesterday someone was selling 3 star unyielding BOS armour 100 caps a piece. 
---
And earlier today serum recipes 100-200 caps a piece. 
---
All on LFG xbox. 
---
What funny is that my results would be:
---
75% 2 Handed Melee
---
25% SSE (single shot explosive)
---
I reserve the 2 hander for glowing, ghouls and beasts when they land.  The SSE (single shot explosive) is great for wiping out level &lt;level 20 guys on areas up north when I'm farming things.  But outside of that I don't have enough perks to make it worthwhile to take out the higher level guys -just to "touch" them so I can get XP for when others do.
---
Be weird to see other players teleport onto benches though...
---
It wasn't an advert, it was just a fact of how the game was. It was overall stable, until I added mods to it that definitely made it more unstable, but not nearly as unstable as mods could do in previous titles.
---
Yeah, a splatapult will wreck a rifleman if it gets up close... but it‚Äôs also got a few tons on him!
---
Had this issue last night before the patch, closed app and relogged and was back to normal.
---
Tato
---
You can say whatever you want but MY opinion on this game =TRASH lol 
---
15 special is the usual usable cap though
---
Empty your junk into your stash all the time.
---
Don‚Äôt be scared of dying, the only loss is junk. Which should be next to nothing.
---
Keep your base small so it‚Äôs cheaper to repair.
---
Melee wins. Shotgun shells and 5.56 are the expensive ammo.
---
There are 7 vendor factions that you can collect up to 1400 caps per 24 hours.
---
Was it really worth it for consoles though?  Biggest bonus was the change to 64-bit.  And regardless of all of that, its the only remastered game I've ever received for free due to owning the original.
---
So Bethesda learns their lesson and other game publishers take note?? Are people supposed to thank Bethesda for very slowly occasionally fixing a small part of the game when they actively chose to release the game in it's state and have continually dug themselves a deeper and deeper hole? 
---
What is the point of letting a company that fucks up and negatively impacts its consumers and fans off the hook??
---
And my point is, how is that unfair?
---
Thanks for this. You're right, even with negative reviews and with people warning us it wasn't possible to foresee just how it would ultimately turn out. I expected too much from Bethesda.
---
 I do feel bad about preordering a copy for me &amp; a friend, then telling our other gamer friends "It's gonna be a good game!". So like 15 friendos from another game are hyped, most of them get the game. A lot of us were there during the BETA test because of the game codes for preordering. Then the game comes out and it's fun at first. Then you see the way they respond to bugs / exploits and things are taking so long to patch (or not fixed at all) and then it's already on sale 9 days later, with the price just going down. And all the rest happened, months later they still don't have any word from management on what's going on currently or a roadmap for what's ahead. Community manager comment making jokes about "passing info along to the team" just to troll. They released the gear from the atom store with a boost to base stats before they even fix things like laser guns or the scorchbeast queen's loot table. Of all the people in my friends list, nobody logs on and most have already uninstalled. I just want new content and a purge of the duped materials. But they're doing blanket nerfs that punish everybody instead, managing to roll back the game so old bugs are back.
---
There's a couple tricks. One is to create an L shape with floor tiles, plant something in the inner corner, then place a floor tile down after. second is to put down a fire pit, counts as ground, looks pretty ugly but you can place plants on it. you can also group multiples to be enough that a small water purifier can be placed. Other method is to leave a floor tile empty so that the ground underneath can be accessed similar to when people build a base around an extractor. Lastly with one set of stairs with a base of a floor tile, you can create an upper floor that walls can snap to going all the way down into the ground leaving open a ground space for plants.
---
Honestly I would prefer if they gave us dirt boxes or even better a dirt tile so that we can create rooftop gardens or level out the ground surrounding our camp to lay down neat rows of plants with clean fencing all around it.
---
....and? 
---
I‚Äôve put my Excaliburs helmet on my favorites wheel for this very reason lmao.
---
No, but the right to deny service to any of their servers at any time for any reason is definitely in there.
---
I agree with you. Ill be leaning back in my chair, strafing, jumping over obstacles, trying to put cover between me and that huge group of mole miners. I die a lot cause I get so into the firefight that I will forget to check my health. I don't get mad at the game. I spawn back and go back at it. Its great.
---
I wish.  If they made the new survival mode actually difficult with perma-death, slower stimpacks, and harsher food/drink/sleep requirements I would play the shit out of it
---
It‚Äôs just too bad you can‚Äôt one shot the SBQ anymore. Just terrible.
---
They have from day 1. You must not be reading their forums.
---
Who cares as along as they fix the issues...smh
---
There is legit no point in bulking anything other than lead or aluminum unless you plan to sell it, this is such a pathetic thing to be upset about.
---
Yeah, at some point through it switches sides. I once got killed by a random barrel exploding long after all the scorched were dead, and my only respawn option was on the side that I was trying to get to. It was nice, but I still had to go back in for my junk so it didn't really save much time. My guess would be the big central room with the armor bench and all the crates/pillars is the cutoff
---
In short, I agree with the dissonance though..  
---
The replies from the Community managers about the Atom's group being a different distinct group reinforce that.  
---
Maybe it is too far gone, or maybe they just need a wakeup, I can't know.  
---
But I can say I tried
---
Lmaoo all my friends are casuals, they couldn‚Äôt kill SQB without me, and they had tse weapons. Hell one of them FINALLY hit 45 last night. I know a decent amount/have seen a lot of casuals with tse. They weren‚Äôt 1 shotting anything, but I can tell you from experience and getting griefed out of thousands of caps that bobblehead stacking is broken.

I think these kinds of people must be totally perplexed that a developer is *expected* to actually support its $60 game and issue updates that actually fix issues in a timely manner.
---
Imagine if the game had a proper development schedule and wasn't rushed out the door with all of these bugs in the first place.
---
I personally thing they‚Äôre response to the community response is even bigger bullshit than their response yesterday 
---
Hey I thought I got a bargain with a couple of recipes for 1k a pop.

But this is what happens when you release a game with KNOWN duping glitches from the beta!

Just started a new character. I plan on doing. Melee charisma build with maybe alcoholic
---
Why do you guys still play this game?
---
Well, when you put it that way......
---
Freedom of speech bro 
---
i HAVE a TSE gun... and found it dramatically unbalanced the game.  It allowed me to do things i wouldn't have normally been able to do.  Kind of ruined the end game for me.  But hope provides.  My buddy got the game late and still has a lvl 5 character so ill just start a new one LOL
---
To be fair the game failing IS a really good thing both for Bethesda and the AAA space in general because it shows this kind of shit wont be accepted of pay off and Bethesda hopefully might remember why it even got this far to begin with. 
---
There was also more content in FO4 upon release than there is in 76. Lots more. The base game was loaded. 
---
The Reddit players know what they are talking about. If they‚Äôre outraged about balance issues it‚Äôs because there are balance issues. Nerfing legendary explosive mods was a great change. Nerfing Demo expert and leaving it a 5 point skill is completely unnecessary. All that does is nerf grenades and launchers (which are already costly and weigh lots) when they are already weaker than they should be. 
---
People rightfully are questioning Bethesda‚Äôs competence after this. You really think people who put hours into this game are not typically Reddit users? That‚Äôs probably wishful. I would love to see numbers but I know I never get placed in a full server. Usually 10-15 people at most are on a server with me at one time.  I would think that with this type of game (which caters to the RPG player) that players are much more likely to frequent the subreddit than players who play mobile games and other shit like that. There‚Äôs so much to explore and figure out its almost automatic if you enjoy the game. 
---
Your whole post is based on an assumption of the game having tons more players than Reddit subscribers. I don‚Äôt buy it. 
---
Build hasn't changed at all. Gatling gun and lever action.
---
Maybe try not being a noob and sitting down in combat. 
---
&gt;There's now a hotfix shortly released after that fixed all the major bugs that got (re-)introduced.
---
False.
---
Don't said it would, after the point of no return. They initially didnt super Cris platform play, then came out and said they would like 15 days before launch
---
This is the ideology of sheep.

Yeah like a "critical rant" kinds category?
---
It's sarcasm.  I even say as much.
---
Program manager, fam. Or, ya know, manually delete the files and run Ccleaner. 
---
Yeah I had no perks other than 5 Demolition Expert. I shot the suicider mutant at West Tek in the face 3 times before he went down and he is naked.
---
I turned the game off after my short trip to West Tek. Level 123 and I had to run away I was so unprepared for the insane loss if damage. I used to run West Tek fairly easily.
---
That was the extent of my research. I think I'm going to go back to Fallout 4. PvP Fallout doesn't do it for me....and running away from super mutants.

Oh my bad man. Misread your comment. Sorry.

"A bit" so somewhat serious. I meant no insult to you. Just responding

thx

r/oof
---
Nah but I havent been as active on here as I am for Fallout stuff. There's some pretty scary people on here anyways, to think we have to share the same planet with some of them üòìüòìüòì
---
Don't worry, with a file size like that we already did.
---
Okay. But should Bethesda really be balancing their game around the "power armor eschewing, grenade only using, no stealth/cover/positioning, can't be bothered to swing by a military base once in a while to collect ballistic fiber, and doesn't want spend any of their hard earned caps on it at a vendor" crowd? That seems oddly specific.
---
Xbox is also not working for me as well
---
No they didn‚Äôt, they gave a bunch of bullshit justifications for the changes they made.
---
Wasn‚Äôt really a patch just a Hotfix:  
---
^ a small piece of code developed to correct a major software bug or fault and released as quickly as possible.^
---
I doubt the current version of the game engine could handle that, if they made a whole new engine rather then "Updating" the engine that could work.
---
Yeah.. not all of us are basement-dwelling neckbeards. For some of us, all our friends exist in something we call "reality" and not online.
---
That means, the players who play solo shouldn't be disadvantageous to items &amp; rewards that others in groups would receive for having no life, no job, no loved ones, and endless possibilities &amp; time to "grind" for them.
---
It's not like you "earned" it in a more deserving way just because you chose the "having no life" route vs. a solo player who completed a questline.
---
Right the whole situation is muffed got a company floundering, a divided community of people who like it and those who don't, and whole lot of people that think if you don't love it you're a troll.
---
Thank you I will check it out!

At generals steakhouse in the bog. Behind the building there's a bunch of gnomes in the garden and small shed/mobile home that scrap for concrete.

The issue is bulk auto scraps when you scrap all junk. Read before you post ignorant shit.

thx i will check
---
It definitely seems like everyone was willing to be patient until those guns got nerfed. Seems yo be the biggest issues everyone has. No one likes it when they're overpowered toys get broken, especially those who may have paid real money for them (though I don't know why anyone would). 
---
Guy. If i drop my phone and break it, it is trash. If one day my phone just stops working, it is trash. It doesn't matter how many great times we had together, trash is still trash. I got to lvl 80, I built my giant house. And those 2 things weren't enough to make me feel like this game wasn't trash. Because this game, is trash.

what is this, a voice of REASON?

My actual stealth sniper (74ish, 15 agi, ultralight armor, 1 chameleon armor piece, 3/3 stealth perk) feels like she gets picked up a lot easier now too
---
tbh I don't use white knight. I just equip fix it when repairing my armor to get it up to 200%, and white knight for the easier repairs, but outside of crafting I don't keep it on for the durability boost. The only thing that gets broken semi quickly is my legendary leather arm, everything else can usually last at least one thorough trip around the map.
---
Imo look at how Bioware is doing. They dont have just community managers chatting over there a lot its actual dev leads and those very important discussing and taking in feedback.
---
im definitely excited..haven heard any new updates for the game for awhile tho
---
Just wait until the next patch when the accidentally revert the hard inventory limits.

Just saw this! Thank you!

Fanboy through and through, proud of it. And that's hilarious coming from the guy trying his damnedest to convince someone else on the internet that a game they like is "bad". 
---
"You're entitled to your opinion but you're a fuckin idiot fanboy for thinking that way!" - this is you, a guy who thinks his opinions are better than others. I have stated multiple times that I do not agree, shows a lot about you if you feel the need to continue berating someone for their stance on a videogame.
---
Well the major complaint was "bulk doesn't auto scrap anymore" worded specifically like that Sooooooo you got what you people asked for.
---
This
---
lol i do this all the time to people. Its actually a really good way to stock up on junk. I only server swap if I loot enough to make me over-encumbered. 
---
Sorry bro 
---
Holding key to sitting is a good idea
---
How is the idea of INT scaling any different from the current state of Melee &amp; Unarmed scaling off STR though?
---
Some of the most used builds right basically say "dump as many points as you can into Strength and hit things with Dead Lizard Fingers or a Rocket Powered Hammer."
---
Melee/Unarmed damage is practically the only reliable damage type currently, because what it can put out works with the damage enemies can take. More Weapons should be in line with those levels.
---
And your point about not wanting to have to put a ton of points into Intelligence? That was my whole argument! Right now, NO ONE wants to have to put points into INT! This gives a reason to! And giving more reason to consider investing points in INT doesn't hurt build options, it does the reverse! It provides *more* options because you want to weigh how much you want to divide up your limited point total!
---
More perks, on the other hand, might be a problem. Energy Weapons can already benefit from perks like Tank Killer, Tormentor, Commando, etc. The issue is not that there aren't enough effect options, it's that Energy Weapons lack the base damage to really utilize the options. 
---
They aren't valid for their own reasons, independent of my opinion.  "Everybody is a duper and a baby" has zero logic applied to it, it's just a statement.  Saying something and then claiming it's LOGICAL doesn't make it so.  "lol u mad bro" hardly destroyed me with any semblance of intelligence or forethought.  You are the one rehashing your "talking points" which are blind insults to anyone and everyone.  If you want to appear logical, don't negate your own arguments by accusing me of the very thing you continue to do.  
---
Why do you keep mentioning fearing getting banned? Why would you get banned exactly?
---
I was pretty sure they've had clear communication this entire time.
---
You're not getting it, methinks.
---
When someone cries injustice, they need to provide proof to get my support. ~Especially~ on the internet, where people make shit up all the time. What I was trying to point out to this dude is that it's silly to come here and complain about being banned and then provide no evidence whatsoever that they're innocent. Why should I believe him over the people who banned him? 
---
The safest bet is to take a neutral position of non-assumption, and that's what I'm doing, so it's funny to see you write "I'll assume you are". I assume neither guilt nor innocence. But, and I guess this is where you got your misconception from, I AM comfortable leaving a ~common sense~ reply indicating that words alone are not redemptive. I won't support someone based on nothing more than a claim of innocence because so many guilty people make that claim that it's become pointless. So if the OP wants us to believe him then he needs to give something back in the form of support. And if he can't? Then don't post in the first place IMO, because I don't know what you expect when it's just your word versus the authorities (and FYI, it would be the same thing in real life if a person was charged with a crime-- common sense says even guilty people will claim innocence, so it's best not to believe that claim until it's proven, and let the person go through the system until they either falsify the charge or find some other way to show people the truth).
---
That's about as clear as I can be. If you don't agree with this approach then don't bother replying, because it's one cornerstone of my system of morality and justice and I will not make exceptions for video game posters. xD
---
Well, patched the Xbox, logged in, traveled to Uranium Fever, and then server disconnected me. All &lt; 2 min.. That might be a new record.

Hello, RichardReagan, Level 88, PS4. I am having nothing but problems since January 29, and the patch today January 31 has not responded the important issues for me. Here is what going on: I use a Quad Hardened Pump Action Shotgun. It is exploding but not two shot. It was obviously nerfed on the 29th but now it is broken. The new base damage with all of my shotgun/demolition perks removed while the weapon is unequipped is 156. As soon as I equip it the damage drops to 142. I have no negative status effects and removed every perk card in case something else was causing this. I unequipped the gun and added 5 ranks of demolition expert. The gun registered a base damage of 171. Once equipped that dropped to 156. I unequipped the gun, removed demolition perks, and added 4 points of shotgunner perks which should combine for 35% damage increase over base. Base damage with those perks was 210. Once I equipped the gun it dropped to 191. So I unequipped the gun and added demolition on top of my shotgunners. This should give a combined 95% damage increase over base damage. Unequipped the damage on the gun is 231, equipped it is 210. It appears as though something is hitting my damage in the background and shotgunner is not stacking with demolition expert. According to my calculations shotgunner 4 ranks along with 5 ranks of demolition expert should combine for a 95% damage increase over base damage. This means I should have 304 damage instead I only have 210 dmg. This is very concerning to me because I have created a shotgun type and now my character is being killed by level 10 scorched. On top of this frustration my mutations are still randomly not working. The first time logging back in after the newest hot fix my marsupial was half normal jump instead of twice normal jump. After server hopping it is working but my speed demon is not. Please tell me that Bethesda is working on fixing these issues rapidly. I've played since early December and really enjoyed the game despite all of its issues. Now the game is not only not fun but I am angry that my character is unusable. I know this isn't an issue for everyone because others who are shotgunners I have spoken with are not having this problem. Please help me, give me a complete Respec for free, or refund my money for the game. As it is now it is not playable, not fun, and definitely not soloable like I was told it would be at all E3 conferences. I would prefer to be fixed but since I can't play until I am a refund would be acceptable and I would move on to another game without do many problems. Thanks.
---
Fair enough. There still might be more to come though. 
---
You first dismiss my claim by saying Bethesda doesn't make sales figures or player counts public then turn around and say the game is fading fast and getting emptier... 
---
Do I have to be the one to point this out. You are trying to say I can't claim this sub it not the majority but you CAN claim it is getting empty? 
---
Okay man... whatever. 
---
Holy shit. The day before too...
---
:,(,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
---
Same here with my gf, so we're still negative! Lol/jk
---
What I have been looking forward to the most, asking for the most, and wanting the most, yah.  Private servers and enabling ppl to use mods and mod content to do what they want.
---
Heh!  My time hasn't come yet...but you can guarantee when my time comes there will be a giveaway before I nuke my C.A.M.P.!
---
To reply to your edited post, assuming your not trying to min max with 20% hp max radiation bloodied build.
---
All rise is best non grind melee
---
Overall best would be furious or bloodied with strength and swing speed super sledge or normal sledge. 
---
These wepons are good main wepons or standard secondary wepons doing enough damage without perk cards to still work effectively. 
---
The stash limit says hording isn't an intended method of play.
---
Character encumbrance says hording isn't an intended method of play.
---
The recently introduced max weight limit per character says hording isn't an intended method of play.
---
Yes perks let you carry more than you otherwise can, that's an ingame mechanic to carry more than you normally could but where do you ever get the impression that its a horders game? its not past fallouts.
---
The widespread use of mules does not mean it isn't exploiting. 
---
"How is using what is there, without using glitches, cheating?"
---
Let me ask you this, for awhile people were using the artillery storage box as an unlimited storage box, do you think this was exploiting?  Common sense would say it wasn't intended otherwise why would they limit stash space?  It wasn't a bug, it wasn't a glitch it was an oversight by the dev team.   Was abusing that oversight an exploit?  I would say yes, but what are your thoughts?  Moving on...you can't trade with yourself on the same account, using a mule is rather inconvenient so you have to go out of the way to use mules.  Is this really an intended game feature?  Obviously I say it isn't.  There really isn't anyway to stop muling without restricting normal play/trading, maybe this is why they don't do much about it?  Whether its common is irrelevant, whether the devs do anything about it is irrelevant.  Muling is exploiting, simply because you are bypassing the stash limit by doing it.
---
Yeah you are wrong 
---
There has been a hotfix
---
Uninstalling, Pre-ordered (oops), super disappointed. Biggest annoyance for me was the sky flickering constantly. Like strobing. Haven't played for a month now. Supposedly this patch fixed it but I don't care anymore.
---
From the article, "Energy and Heavy Weapons Improvements.¬†We've heard and share your feedback that energy weapons need to be brought inline with other weapon types. We're also looking to adjust laser weapon durability in a future update."
---
Plasma is an energy weapon. Although they explicitly laser weapon durability I'm sure this will impact plasma because they are fixing Energy &amp; Heavy weapons.
---
Lol okay! Thanks! 
---
In breach of rule six. Isn‚Äôt that so irritating? Isn‚Äôt that the worst thing yet today? 
---
Exaggerated. Have original Xbox, no extra storage have 8 games In total including RD2
---
Cool strawman, bro. Have a nice life.
---
I mean, that's already been the case. Did everybody forget the auto weapon buff? The 10mm smg became one of the best mid-game weapons thanks to that, and a good effect legendary one like furious is now viable for end-game. The reason they nerfed TSE and explosive was because they were both ridiculously overperforming relative to every other legendary effect, making anything else obsolete. Bringing those two down to the level of everything else is easier and takes less time than buffing 15 other effects to match the overpowered one. They might do it later, but this was a pressing issue that everybody was complaining about daily, so they needed to do SOMETHING fast
---
That would be perfect
---
I can‚Äôt fucking copy paste none of that fucking shit
---
Jesus this comes handy af. Thanks !
---
Do you know if they changed the spread of the weapon - not aimed, if the crosshairs are closer together for you?
---
You are like those guys that get cheated on by the same girl 5 times and still try again 
---
I am lvl 87-ish (I really quit watching after 50 and have never killed the SBQ (though I have launched the nuke and just about everything else.  Since I place a 1-shot sniper built (6 points of rifleman/expert rifleman, 3 point of covert ops, sandman, etc.)  the SBQ raid is really pointless to me.
---
The few 76 discords I'm on have now decayed to meme spams :')

Thank you!

Any build suggestions? Whats your personal favorite?
---
\#LeaveRadWormsAlone !! :D
---
No matter what they do, people of reddit will complain about everything in the game. They could fix every single bug and people would still complain 
---
You dont need to play 5-10 hours a day to realize what a ridiculous and amateur fuckup release a patch that reverts your AAA title back to an older and buggier game version is bad. Do you honestly think its only people who play dozens of hours a week that have this point of view? 
---
i won a bet about that with a friend.
---
I told him that they will not consider that removing the `NoAutoScrapJunk` (that was the low hanging "solution") will make them to be scrapped when you press the scrap all
---
Shit show !!!

If no one else has helped I will be home in a couple of hours and can give you a hand.

I'll even build you some level appropriate armor and weapons with mods of your choice.

I've killed 4 or 5 SB since the patch using my TSE handmade, they're definitely not five times harder, maybe used about 50 more rounds to kill each one, so maybe you're build or weapon. To be honest I started having more fun with the game since I'm not one shotting damn near every enemy I come across, so IMO the nerf was needed, maybe not as bad as they nerfed but it was definitely needed. Pre patch most SB once landed was usually killed in about 10 or so rounds, I managed to kill a few while still flying and Mirelurk Queens took about two shots, I was about to give my TSE a break but now it works as it should. Instead of bitching about the nerf we should be bitching about why there is no end game content out yet, why don't the devs come up with some server based events, like taking on huge hoard of scotch, ghouls, or robots. Making more areas worth nuking, I've got about 350 hrs in and played the BETA and I still play the game and enjoy it I just want more content, bug fixes, buff energy weapons, and more. 
---
I didn't have much time to test it out, so I'm not sure. I just know I was head-shotting ghouls from a good distance with VATS instead of constantly missing. 
---
Notedx5
---
I think they should change it to an extra chance at the mods. I still haven‚Äôt gotten anything but explosive vent and rusty knuckles 
---
Hey I am the type of person who has to walk through my feelings, and give things a well needed second chance, or rather third chances and so on. But I do know, to work through some of those feelings, ya gotta feel emotions or have thoughts that are, at the time, most likely irrational. But yeah, I'm not clamoring on about how great it is yet, but i still very much enjoy the game, and most of the community. Haha.
---
Keep them in. Plans are too expensive at the terminal. 
---
I'm very well aware of the bugs people have experienced; I've visited this sub. That's my point. I've never had my power armor unequipped when fast traveling. You say it's a common one, but if there wasn't a community of people playing the game like this sub, I wouldn't know about it. There weren't subreddits back in the late 90s/early 2000s for people to congregate, and message boards weren't exactly mainstream. Games released then were buggy as hell the same way. Hell, sometimes those older games would just *break* with no rhyme or reason. 
---
Yeah I called him out as I have participated in forum conversations in the past and have been muted for far less. First page he responded with snarky responses to what could have been constructive talks. Then page two devolves into a bashing match. He was baiting and goading other forum goers, eliciting the exact response he wanted because of his anger over the latest patch. 
---
There was nothing civil about the title of his forum post nor any of his responses. I don't play fallout 76 but have been a fallout fan since the original. There are clear problems here but the guy who made the original post on r/fallout should not be taken seriously. 
---
There are many levels to this situation which are failing to be addressed as a lack of understanding continues to breed between the consumer and the corporation. 
---
The world is defined by business and a company is only able to function by the continued investment of interested parties who are invited to contribute financially in order to gain capital.
---
When a company suffers a product failure of this scale it is forced into a position of vulnerability and liability that it simply cannot afford.
---
What we as the consumer are arguing for, unfortunately, is for Bethesda to accept liability for a massive product failure. This will undoubtedly cause the company to - like any high level corporate entity - take financial responsibility for its failure, causing the company to take an operating loss that will affect all it's current product development, future development and investment. In modern business at this level, the company will likely fragment and fail. 
---
Considering the complexity of intellectual rights, publishing rights and it's status as a subsidiary of Zenimax it is likely that parent corporation will simply close the company and attain as many of the intellectual property rights as possible to cut its losses and Bethesda games will cease to exist.
---
Their behaviour is justified from their position, however the reality is probably even more complex for them behind closed doors as pressure from their parent likely led them into this situation in the first place. 
---
This is the end of Bethesda.
---
Amateur sleuthing is baseless and this is merely a disjointed observation based on my extremely limited knowledge of business. I'm mainly basing this opinionated statement on my observation of similar product failures by other video game developers of the past who are no longer operational.

No, you can just read a entry and get them for free

Those aren't entirely unreasonable ways to go about it, but also, demo expert being +100% for 5 points is way out of line with other damage perks being +60% for 9 points. If the base explosive weapons are underpowered without a +100% perk, then they need to be looked at and maybe balanced. But re-balancing always needs to start with bringing the hugely overpowered stuff the affects multiple weapons first, and then individual weapons can be looked at and adjusted on a case by case basis.
---
Im sure many were , as it was so trivial to buy them. But that's what they desided to do. Non TSE were powerful enough to kill powerful enemies with few bullets. 
---
People wanted totally OP glitch guns and now they are cold turkey when the eventual nerf came. It's hard to upgrade from TSE. For many weapons there's AA-E above TES, but is there enough of those for everyone, specially with some people getting bans. And then more dedicated bloodied builds which take more effort.
---
I don't know what in supposed to do with them or the supply drop things.
---
Not sure if it was mentioned already, but you listed the dates of DLC. However, you forgot to mention that they made this game in about half the time it took to make Fallout 4. That's why there isn't as much content either. If they had taken just as long, we'd probably have twice as much content from the beginning.
---
I've seen no armor mod plans at any vendor since the update. Fortunately I had most of them already, but if you still need them then you're out of luck. Not sure if the change was intentional. I don't think I've seen NV scope plans either, but I wasn't really looking.
---
I've never seen BoS plans as a world spawn, but I think Dense shows up occasionally. I have found one BoS plan from Toxic Wastes treasure map.
---
Explosive Vent is the rarest plan of all time :O
---
Dodgy helps but without you won't die unless you fire every round right at your feet. Keep I. Mind I run empathy too so I take 33% more damage
---
It was a hot fix that fixed what 2 / 3 of the things it was supposed too, because they broke it a week before with a poorly executed patch. 
---
Don't go shooting your load or nothing its nothing for them to be proud off. 
---
There professional developers not 8 year old's looking for a pat on the back.
---
Ughh there are still a lot of people who think he's little more than an ult battery. 
---
You're literally bitching about other people bitching about bitching js
---
Well that's pointless. 
---
Im lvl 95, had a couple of bugs, many crashes at nuke zone. Playing on ps4, fps drops some time happens, but nothing critical. A lot of people just really overstate frustration when some bs happens. Quite good game, enjoeyd surviving in appalacia overall, but game unfortunately lacks of polished product sense, hope they will patch it in near future.
---
You can join me and u/cheesewheelmare, we are defenately not RPing but we like to trade and deal with people ingame, so that might fit.
---
Feel free to either add LxndrSonGoku or Cheesewheelmare ingame anytime!
---
I know 
---
I find that hard to believe with the piss poor rendition of PVP that launched with the game.  I mean that's just grossly incompetent.  Then again, FO76 has been mired in said incompetence so maybe you're right..
---
if they made offline servers, made it an expansion for fallout 4, or just ported some of the weapons/armors etc to fallout 4, i would buy them. I want to be in control of something I buy for many of the reasons you already faced.
---
Some of the bugs are game breaking, to the point where I see Fallout 76 heading down the same road as Perfect World International (PWI) and becoming pay to win. Or down the same road as Marvel Heroes, where the duplication and the builds don't get proper respecs after an update and break the game.
---
In the end, in that case, the novelty will wear off, and people will move on.
---
Fallout 4 and the earlier games were given to me as an early christmas present back when Fallout 4 was released, and I've put over 9000 (no, not kidding) hours into the game with an under-speced pc for most of it, which I have finally gotten upgraded to handle the game a whole lot better. 
---
My point is here, that I've played quite a few MMOs, and I've spent more time on Fallout then most of them, and I've seen what happens. I see a "Bad Ending" for 76 going down this path, and I'd rather not see the death or the huge monetization of another franchise that I have fallen in love with.
---
TSE could‚Äôve been nerfed without fucking over throwable grenades. Now I just want my 5 points back. 
---
*Hey just noticed..* it's your **5th Cakeday** cuorebrave! ^(hug)
---
I don‚Äôt much, except to sometimes cross rivers. 
---
I did fall into a water filled pit in the cave where the Uranium Fever event takes place and couldn‚Äôt get out while in power armor.   
---
After struggling for what seemed like an eternity to get out, it hit me that I would have to exit the power armor and swim for it.   I had a moment of doubt that I could get my armor back.  
---
I‚Äôll never understand how you sink with power armor on but float with it in your backpack...   guess it must come with built in floatation packs...   (grin)
---
Were talking about a game where you can literally fire 8 nukes at once from a handheld launcher. Pretty sure balance doesnt really exist. Also consider the balancing factor of this weapon is that you had to be a reasonable distance away to not be blown up by the blast radius making some of the shotguns alot harder to use
---
I think these sort of people are either 13 years old fan boi's or dev's that work for gaming companies that should be working instead of spouting shit on reddit tbh.
---
Oh I've already favorited that one in my list of subs. Had this one there for a while but after this I'm done checking here as much as I did. 
---
New bug after the Jan 29 patch. Mutations are listed but stop working randomly. 
---
That's true, but how big is your selection?
---
One of the player vendors I know has a metric ton of weapons, armor, meds, and mats on them.  They even sell full suits of modded power armor (T-45, T-51, T60 with all pieces modded).
---
No way they can function after this patch.  Their shop is done.  They'd have to drop 80% of it just to trade or move.
---
The saddest thing is the guy bought a 2nd game account so he could double box his vendor and his main character.  He alt tabs to go adventuring, and then alt tabs back when someone talks in area chat near his alt.
---
Man I was never trying to convince you of anything. I already knew you were straight up delusional lol. I just wanted to stress WHY you are and why most people disagree with your statement that F76 is a great game lol. Disagree all you want but if you can‚Äôt except the facts and resort to ‚Äúguess I‚Äôm a fanboy then‚Äù and then you opinion is a rather weak one. I mean you straight up said the MAJORITY of people that have played the game have 400 plus hours lol. Where did you pull that out lol?
---
oh ok
---
No sir thats not life. In the real world when shit happens, then responsible adults unshit the happening. They don't go around spilling shit from the slop bucket and claim its just part of the cleaning process. 
---
Sucks. I bought 2 jetpack plans the day before that so...prob why im so damn bitter
---
I actually suspect it's all a long term prep for adding online multiplayer to future single player games (Fallout 5 or Elder Scrolls Bananna or whatever). And like many long term projects, you don't get all that much funding as time goes on. Kinda have to pay your own way eventually.
---
So,from my view, those of us like me who actually enjoy the game in spite of it's bugs and issues are basically beta-ing for people who... well, lets be honest, will still complain about the multiplayer in FO5, but at least with less justification.
---
Nope, it's just a cosmetic alternative for one already in game. Don't want to spoil anything, though. 
---
&gt; But, I will still say that Bethesda took huge steps towards stabilizing the game in this patch. I have not crashed since the patch. Recipes being consistently available at vendors is a huge improvement. The weight limit is a huge value add to fight dupers. 
---
And do you think changes like this would have happened if no one complained?  What if we were all like you and just said "pfft, game is fine, you all are try-hards".
---
True some people are complaining about lack of content.  But plenty of us are complaining about crashes, loading issues, exploits, patching blunders and tone-def combat changes.  Yeah, you don't care about the White Knight change, but would you care if wasn't changed?  Just because something doesn't effect you personally doesn't make it okay or valid.
---
We aren't complaining the car only comes in black, we are upset it only has 3 wheels.  Maybe that would be okay with you if you only "casually" drive to work.  We are playing a first person shooter game that have weapons that are unusable three months into the game.
---
It is also not fair to compare the 76 and Fallout 4 timeline.  FO4 was a complete game at launch.  There were definitely bugs, but not even in the same ballpark as 76.  Not to mention, it was a single player game which gave players a multitude of ways of fixing issues on their own.  We are at Bethesda's mercy for 76.
---
Lastly, maybe people here complaining are the minority, and casuals make up most of the player base.  But I promise you there is even a more massive player base that didn't buy the game or quit because of the on going shit show.  And when enough people disappear, and there isn't enough money coming in, it will 100% affect the game as a whole.
---
I can claim it's getting empty based on lower server populations, far less nuke launches and besides my own experience many posts on here from other players making the same observations.
---
Your claim that this sub is not representative of "the majority" comes without any real explanation of who "the majority" is. Without the game being a successful MMORPG or any other genre you're trying to claim that the views of a forum don't meet up to what you think the opinions of "the majority" should be.
---
My argument was that given the dwindling player counts, the number of users posting on here is ***probably*** quite representative of the actual player count at this point.
---
507.
---
And Yes, I have the TSEs and the OP melees, and a Set of legendary Heavy Combat BOS Armor 
---
Ask me anything.
---
Restart has it working, cheers
---
I think it got even brighter when they buffef the regular light. Makes it hard to see sometimes due to the glare. 
---
yea i got all 3 and i want to turn them in for my winnings!
---
Man at this point, if you're able to, I'd request a refund...
---
I kind of agree but I wish they had done their first online test as a DLC for fallout 4, tested it, worked through the bugs and in a few years given us a proper fresh online fallout game. That way they could have still mass tested it over a long period of time while getting some money through DLC sales but the customer don't feel cheated if it doesn't work as the core game is still fallout 4. 
---
I convinced a friend to buy fo76 too, he stopped playing jsut days after he bought it and bow I feel like I ripped him of 
---
And a point reimbursement to anyone who had Demo Expert 
---
That's a shame! Would be cool if you could plug a core in to charge it up!
---
Wait.... They didn't take them out of her loot table? Even though you automatically get the plans from,belly of the beast??? That's the same as getting plans for wooden walls from her, it's completely pointless. How is this a thing? Are the Dev's heads up their ass for warmth? 
---
Lol, thankfully no....
---
I like the numbers but as a heavy gun player, I also would like to see the heavy guns been buffed way stronger then now. 
---
Currently a non-legeneary combat rifle with a sneak/VATS crit build can solo the SBQ in less than 2 minutes.
---
If guns were to receive a baseline buff, crit/sneak multiplier damage would need to be addressed somehow.
---
Things don't operate on a vacuum and you need to consider all aspects. TSEs were not the only viable ranged weapons, despite what most of the community seems to think.
---
I'm talking about after the hotfix
---
Level 155 with 18 Agility (with amor and food), 3 points in sneak (perk), escape artist (perk), and chameleon armor. Using silenced weapons and no power armor of course.
---
Some the situations I have been running into so far are as follows:
---
- Crouched (hidden) and not moving but all of sudden mole rats who are far away immediately dive on me (danger).
---
-  Crouched (hidden), Fire a shot at super mutant from far away with a headshot from my silenced tse gauss and immediately go to danger. 
---
go outside 
---
Calibrated springs? Those were being sold as mods on vendors for fairly cheap, anyone got them if they wanted.
---
To sell sometimes I end up with 300 plus by scraping weapons 
---
What \*are\* they for? Can they be redeemed somewhere for anything?
---
You know, I read the the Inside the Vault bullet: 
---
" **One of the key rewards for Belly of the Beast is a full set of Ultracite Power Armor. Some players accidentally deleted this reward and were understandably upset. We made this fix to ensure everyone that completed Belly of the Beast could remake this power armor even if they accidentally dropped or deleted it. These recipes can also drop from the Scorchbeast Queen, but this wasn‚Äôt meant to be one of her primary rewards, since everyone in the Scorched Earth event already should have access to the Ultracite Power Armor."**
---
It makes sense EXCEPT for the fact that "wasn't meant to be one of her primary rewards" seems to have... well, not worked.  I have gotten more Ultracite Explosive Vent and Helm plans than I can count.  Maybe people have had a different experience, but I feel like I get an average of 1.5 Ultracite armor plans per Scorched Earth event.  Maybe keep them in but not drop if they are known to the player? IDK, maybe that is a little too complicated.  
---
Im gonna see what happens next weel before i do that. Im not even touching the game this week after all the horrid things i have read the patch did. Im gonna be patient a week longer. If the next one doesnt fix anything again im uninstalling. No need to have a game that big on my ps4 if its not even going to function properly. 
---
&gt; I did this before. It generated a lot of discussion and some entrepreneurial type souls started a new subreddit over it.
---
Ok? Who the hell cares???
---
&gt;I am going to do it again, despite the fact that last time my inbox was full of hate mail from over 800 comments
---
I can only imagine why with a post like this
---
&gt;My point last time is there are more people that are causal players than there are players that are "try-hards". My point is once again the same. This sub is leans towards the latter. 
---
Rhetoric with no facts attached. No thanks. Moving on.
---
&gt;The evidence is clear, as a simple inspection of the top several posts are made by people claiming hundreds of hours into the game. 760 hours in one case ... This sub is not normal. you are not the "average" player of this game.
---
LMFAO redditore posting anonymously that they've put in X hours into the game, and top voted posts are evidence??! That sounds reasonable /s
---
&gt;And yes, this is a really sloppy job of running a game. I have played ALOT of games in my old age (dinosaur age in reddit years) A lot of online games. A lot of console games.... and I can't think of one off the top of my head that has been as rocky and meandering as this one...
---
You must have a very perverse idea of quality then because I've played so many that top fallout 76. Battlefront 2, Battlefield Hardline/4, call of duty ghosts, SWTOR, Skyrim at one point was unplayable for a month or more. But sure, be a premadonna and pretend this is the worst game there has ever been. 
---
&gt;I just can't join the howls of protest. I have never had a TSE gun. I don't even have a single point
---
My God, there's more? Is this a master's thesis?! If it is, I couldn't tell you what it was about because there's no structure and it's an endless ramble about everything while saying nothing. 
---
I see your white knight perk card was unaffected, thanks for that insight as to why my opinion is wrong so was gta5 single solo or multiplayer or all 3? Wait never mind I've wasted enough of your time I'll let you get back to your castle sir
---
Only melee weapons.
---
Oh, my bad. I haven't been on today. I wasn't aware that it happened yet. 
---
A PSA isn't upset.  A PSA is letting people know so they aren't surprised and GET upset.  
---
It‚Äôs found it‚Äôs niche!
---
I mean that‚Äôs the only way you can sell it, but go ahead 
---
I didn't say it was a bad thing. I said that's what the most popular thing on the sub is, and OP is not being honest when he says that's a mature environment.
---
Then in my new edit I talked about why that sub exists. That one's more complaing^3 but your comment was made almost as soon as I made the edit.
---
Looks like we've had exact opposite experiences with these games.
---
New Vegas, with all of it's bugs and problems still gets defended these days because "they had to finish it in a year." Yes games get delayed, but sometimes the developers aren't allowed to. Unlike New Vegas and other singleplayers, they can continue working on 76. 
---
If you didn't like FO4, you would'nt like 76.
---
I'm fine with them keeping plans for mods, but I want them to completely remove the armor plans because, why go through all the effort to kill her just to get a plan that you can get off reading a terminal?
---
And I'm telling you all bugs that *I,* and multiple people I know, have experienced, repeatedly.
---
I'm glad *your* experience has been relatively bug free, but mine has not. I have not nor will I complain about a single thing in this game that has not personally affected me, I have plenty that has to complain about already.
---
Can someone tell me how a casual even obtains those TSEs?  Have more than 400 hours in game and have yet to loot a single TSE myself.  That's hardcore but no TSE.  In all that time I found a single Explosive legendary - it was a lv 20 Troubleshooter's combat rifle, a bunch of various TSs, but ZERO TSEs.
---
Because of RoF. Just like weapons in real life.
---
50 cal bullet has allot more armor penetration over 5.56. 
---
I'm level 80 and I two-shot them with my melee weapon, yay! 
---
I really think there should be a respec option.  I don't care if it's a rare drop item or something that costs loads of Caps or even Atoms!  Respeccing level by level is really not ideal, especially when every update brings changes to perks, guns and armour.
---
&gt;What? I only had a TSE pump action shotgun for about a week before the nerf. 
---
Maybe you aimed and he didn't. I could one shot many thing with just instigating explosive revolver. TSE handmade with silencer would have one shotted pretty much anything except few high healt enemies.
---
It is the default phrase about how a project manager thinks :P
---
Yeah...its just trolls, definitly not reasonabke people who were upset about not being able to craft with bulk, excavator PA glitch being back, Bobby pins weighing more than 50 cal rounds again, getting stuck in PA being back, Plan prices were doubled, plans that end game players grinded for now being free, melee still doing 20k+ damage, serendipity perk being bugged, bounties still being bugged despite the patch notes saying otherwise, people not being able to trade even though they are below the max limit, all energy weapons beong useless, all explosive weapons (not the legendary effect) no longer being viable, and xp was nerfed again, cap stashes only giveing you 1 cap, and to top it off yes... explosive legendary effect and two shot
---
The loading screen bug seemed fixed for me (on PC) after the last major patch (before the hotfix). Though if others are still experiencing it, I can't really dispute that.
---
The load times also seemed faster. 
---
I regret this post. Today, my rose colored glasses came off. 
---
Does crit take only base damage without perks? Cause dunno with crit modifiers on top it is still better to max the perks out. 
---
are some items only sellable bulked? ive been to many vendors and noticed they can take some unbulked junk
---
Wait, I thought it was the revolver grip... You know, the elusive Ivory one
---
I understand the feeling but, objectively, isn‚Äôt that 100% irrelevant to you, in practice? Whereas the problems with the game and the frustration of terrible PR do affect you (and many others obviously).
---
The open demo starts tomorrow. I played the VIP one a few days ago and it was pretty damn fun actually. You should check it out on YouTube. 
---
Hotfix for some bugs, I guess.
---
I'm a casual player and I'm not even subscribed here. I play with my brother almost exclusively for a couple hours every other night. It is an absolute blast. We were both very hesitant about buying it at first but we're now approaching level 20 and don't have many complaints.
---
I think min maxers need to find another game. There's lots of MMORPGs for hardcore min maxers. This isn't really that kind of game if you're stat obsessed. I'm sure there will hardly be a noticeable difference in combat anyways. It looks like Bethesda doesn't want easy mode either. Easy mode will just as likely make someone quit the game than making it too difficult.
---
End game is also extremely difficult to do in any online game. It usually ends with PVP, and Bethesda has plans for that. Other than that, start a new character.
---
Just my 2 c.
---
Well a large amount of this community defend it as "PvP". Imo it isn't PvP when you run up at level 200+ and kill people under level 20.
---
&gt;Reply
---
The game has vendors in several locations.
---
You can sell bulked items to vendors for caps.
---
Yeah mabey a 40% for heavy but any buff is better than no buff
---
Being able to stay connected to a server for more than 45 mins would be enough for me at this point. 
---
Lol I know! 
---
This reminds me of Homer Simspon and his bird bobble toy at the nuke plant.  Probably that type of testing.
---
Yep its pretty annoying, and now you can get all of them for reading a terminal 
---
Level 173 one piece of chameleon armor, having an issues where I will get my hidden will go to caution and not revert back until I relog. i can fast travel, no enemies nearby just a permenent caution, which means my healing factor mutation will not work, aslo have had the issue where my marsupial randomly stops working as well
---
This is single handedly the greatest idea suggested for FO76 I‚Äôve personally heard!!! üòç I love it and would play the game a ton more.  
---
Oh yea, dude that's the rarest plan in the game
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
The problem here is between the chair and the computer or console.
---
\#LeaveRAdWormsAlone 
---
I'm sure the intern tried it's best.
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to make that sound like I was trying to discourage you. I have endless respect for you, how despite the amount of hate thrown your way and with how hopeless this whole situation feels, you still had to try to salvage this in any way you could. That takes a lot more than most people could give. You're trying to look at this logically rather than hating on Bethesda and cursing them out. It's quite noble. I don't think the modding community is to blame here because otherwise I feel like Bethesda would've done the same thing other companies have done in the past and literally release an unfinished game. I can't really think of any long term solutions at this time, but maybe, just maybe this discussion here could light a spark that would get everyone at Bethesda, from CEO to janitor, to realize how to salvage the situation. Like you said, at least we can say we tried. It could work, it could not work, but we'll never know unless we try.
---
And posts have inherent value, there's communication bring exchanged. Bit coins were tulips
---
I will definitely check it out, thanks. 
---
You can sell stuff like silver scrap, gold scrap, nuclear waste, antibiotics and fiber optics and ballistic material without bulking (I don't think you can even bulk those materials).
---
Everything like lead, steel, springs, leather, plastic and so on cannot be sold unless it is bulked first.
---
They could always ask Mom to help I guess.
---
Thank you. The industries wanton misuse of "hotfix", "beta" and "alpha" infuriate me to no end.
---
I personally want this for the sake of my poor 2 shot ultracite laser rifle bc it doesn't even do 100 damage with an optimized build
---
I hate pay to play or pay to win as much as anyone else.
---
I can forgive this oversight.  You can get the Mistress of Mystery outfit by playing the game.  Most people however scrapped or dropped it.
---
It's also a temporary buff of 15 hp when your pool is around 300 hp.
---
But yes, I believe they should steer clear of stuff like this in the future.
---
Only lead and aluminum save weight by bulking, steel doesn't. It only looks that way because you lose plastic
---
Grow up already!
---
So this was posted just a minute prior to this post, good discussion on both. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alv0jl/can\_bethesda\_remove\_ultracite\_armor\_plans\_out\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alv0jl/can_bethesda_remove_ultracite_armor_plans_out_of/)
---
I am really sorry to disappoint you friend. I wish they put such effort care and love into their game. :(
---
Here is what the future holds for you:
---
whitesprings, watoga high school, events
---
This is not the original argument. We were arguing that games released in the late 90s/early 2000s were buggy as well and never got fixed. 
---
I was simply saying that, much like you not remembering the bugginess of those old games, I wouldn't know about a lot of bugs in 76 without a community 170k people strong posting about every single bug they find. It was an example of why you might not remember those old games being buggy. You likely didn't have 200k people showing you every single one. 
---
True but sometimes that's how people want it. 
---
honestly they should have called the first part the pre-beta and the first year the beta pointing out the game would radically changing - honestly from my point of view I've played 20+ mmo's first year to me this is the crash test still which makes me a bit more chill about it
---
that said they should just rebrand this as a extended beta now and says its to improve the game quality and as a apology give people a free reset of their character where they can repick every perk ever special from lvl 1 and give them some atoms as a hey were listening were trying even if we aren't getting it right 
---
I never have enough steel to bulk.  .45 ammo for my combat rifle eats through it all. 
---
Actually from what I‚Äôve been doing there are 8 items that decrease stash weight when bulking and that would be from the best of my knowledge:
---
-Aluminum
---
-copper 
---
-cork
---
-fertilizer
---
-gears 
---
-lead
---
-oil 
---
-springs
---
Some may not reduce significantly until there are larger numbers of them (for me oil-410 at the moment, aluminum, lead, gears, and springs are the most for me) 
---
So? Maybe he's got Dodgy, or Sentinel armor, or there was lag, etc etc etc 
---
Pete Hines is so happy with it he has taken a celebratory 3 month holiday. A well earned long-service leave break.
---
Same for me as well on xbox one
---
Sounds like fun to me.  I‚Äôm a stealth build, on the west coast.  Feel free to add me - deathstalkerpup
---
Check your disease status I think you're suffering from the Rad Worms "bug".
---
Sorry I could wast the braincells to read your pissy rant.
---
Well past ridiculous.  Still fun, but well past ridiculous.  Sometimes I wonder if they are running a Vault Tec inspired social test to see how long gamers will put up with ineptitude.  
---
Yes!! All long-lived games need a silly time-sink...fishing and fishing achievements please! We can start community fishing tournaments, fish caught with the most extraneous eyes/limbs wins!
---
Same. I hit up Beth support because I was a bit put off that the price dropped by practically 50% online and in my neighboring retailers just days after release. They told me that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt offer refunds as a result of Black Friday sales‚Äù it had nothing to do with Black Friday sales, they had all come and gone already.
---
I then asked if I could just have some atoms for a skin I wanted and they didn‚Äôt even have the decency to answer me. the way I see it, I just think it‚Äôs fucked that people who are day 1 fans of the franchise, who ended up pre ordering or buying day of ended up paying about $25-30 more than the next guy who got the game for half after sales bombed. I get that it‚Äôs partially on the buyer but the least they could have done was tossed us atoms or some sort of beta-only skin to appease us. That wouldn‚Äôt have cost them anything, but no, Bethesda doesn‚Äôt give a shit.
---
Man, and I've been just giving them away.  I should have asked for a price check.
---
I know about those but I meant more of a farming spot if anyone has one, ghouls only give me like 100 xp now 
---
Its the same, aside from the fact that it makes no sense. STR makes sense because you hit harder when you are stronger. But I would remove damage increases for melee from STR before adding this mechanic to every stat. Having to max PER for rifle damage, or max AGI for Pistol damage is equally insipid.
---
If you want to buff damage based on weapon durability, which is buffed by INT. But I think this is a misguided path. If you dont want perk bloat then just fix weak weapons by changing base damage. Thats my preference.
---
Lmao this is so typical for Bethesda. They always pull those lazy short sighted "fixes".
---
Like when they tried fixing duping by let us stack gear only to 255, so that you can't reache the 300.

My TSE Minigun does 37 dmg.. 
---
I've heard that using the Atom Shop Combat Armor paint only works on un-modified armor.
---
Not sure if they fixed it yet or not.
---
I'm waiting for some cool Brotherhood or Enclave "over-armor" cosmetics.  Never really was a fan of the various armor piece "football pads" look :)
---
What kinda lame ass shit is that? That's not real, is it? Please tell me that's someone's mod.
---
I was joking btw
---
Have you noticed this entire sub is burning pile of trash lately? 
---
The drop request papers.. You need to go to one of radio towers marked on the map. Sometimes the machine will need repairs, other times you just need to defeat the enemies. When you fix the terminal there is a button to press to upload holotape. That's how you use them. 
---
He never said "well" or "properly".
---
My comment isn't about enabling mods, it concerns why Bethesda is so ardent on ignoring the modding community. They don't want to cede any ground to open that door because they want to charge for mod like content. As soon as they legitimize the modding community by incorporating their suggestions and fixes, they have opened that door and people will continue to push the boundaries toward modding.
---
Ikr? The only time I even got *explosive* was when someone happened to sell it to a vendor, allowing me to buy it off of it (and I'm somewhere in between a casual and hardcore player).
---
I more or less said the same thing earlier, minus the example, and get downvoted. Such an awesome community we have here.
---
They could be a fan of the Cleveland Browns, you don't know that.
---
Well best way is to do stuff that spawns enemies. Events are good for that and give extra xp on completelion.
---
right, the invisible isnt even very invisible, most players can still see u unless you hide in a bush too or something, but the percentage does stack??? can you show me where it says yhis somewhere, even if it was for 4
---
Vats matrix overlay or targeting his?
---
I like your concept. Definitely agree about more power armor stations. Too bad there isnt some BoS decor for ya.
---
They probably would've made a lot more money if the game was free to play or around the $20 mark. That and lower priced cosmetic items would've made them bank.
---
Instead, they chose to price it as an AAA game, make the world's most expensive microtransactions and on top of that, release it as a buggy unfinished mess.
---
I'd like that, I have to scroll through about 150 different clothing items I'm hoarding to find my legendary armor
---
My TSE Minigun does 37 dmg -_-
---
Well that targeting hud is a whole [other issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ajk3tq/bug_fix_pretty_sure_i_just_figured_out_the_cause/?st=JRGP5XEU&amp;sh=57fe801e) 
---
See [Here](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319175/upcoming-hotfix-january-31-2019?language=en)  for details. 
---
It's debatable whether 1 perk card slot is worth it for an additional 5% damage. First 3 cards give you 30% then 6 more slots for an additional 30. Those 6 slots can be put into other perks like anti tank or adrenaline.
---
I was going for a fast paced VATS commando build.
---
Playing Fallout 4 now though.
---
95, sneak rank 3, escape artist, 16 agility, 1 chameleon armor piece, 2 armor pieces with "harder to detect while sneaking" legendary affix (not in the dark). That legendary effect has never seemed to do anything, mind you. Even before the patch. But earlier today went from hidden to danger after being seen by a scorchbeast who hadn't taken off yet after spawning at its fissure, while I was on a cliff easily 100 yards away laterally and 70ish yards above its ground level. Also couldn't even tell you how many times the entire Whitespring golf club's population of ghouls has seen through my stealth and mobbed me all at once, and all my weapons are silent.
---
yeah but the armor will break down quicker if not always equipped
---
dont know if they messed up or not and changed it but i know some plans are still random to show up. i had 5 stash boxes left to buy and had to server hop a few times before they showed up to buy. i found grahm earlier today and he didnt even have his specialty plan that starburst clock i believe i was really mad, sad and disappointed.
---
The patch wasn‚Äôt even out for 24 hours before we were inundated with sappy bullshit essays about why people just HAD to leave the game, and Bethesda was already in the process of fixing it. It‚Äôs like these people have never played an online-only game before. 
---
And the fact that the majority of these whiny posts directing Bethesda to personally explain why they did this or calling for a restructuring of the company and/or employees (lol) are coming from people who somehow beat an 80-hour campaign and are already in the endgame grind just a couple months after launch is insane. Hey, level 100+ ultrabadass with all legendary weapons and armor, you are not the norm and you shouldn‚Äôt be catered to in lieu of balance for the people who don‚Äôt have all day and night to power through this massive game. This sub has been cancer the last 48 hours because of the tiny, most-vocal minority they seem to think they‚Äôre personally owed an explanation for apology. It‚Äôs laughable and pathetic. 
---
If you rush to the end of a game meant to last for years, don‚Äôt be surprised when you‚Äôre hit the hardest by changes meant for normal gamers with a normal amount of time to play. 
---
So far technical data only has two rewards that I know of:
---
Shielded BOS Underarmor Plan
---
Brotherhood Initiate Paint Plan
---
Unless they changed the loot tables recently.
---
Y'know, if you didn't immediately OHKO everything in the room and just sat back to watch for a few moments, you'd see that most of the enemies have decent AI, even brilliant in some places, and the stupid ones are by design (ferals act like mindless zombies because they *are* mindless zombies).
---
I've had the car, gold watch, 100 paper money, 1,000 paper money, and several random weapons from him. Is there really one where you get some cram ?
---
r/fo76 seems to be the place for ex TSE dupers to whine on, very sad.
---
Where was this mindset when the game launched? Waiting so long to open your eyes to whats wrong with something is a big part of why it only got worse over time.
---
same
---
:D It makes sense and it's the kinda thing that just sticks in your mind so I like it. Just never heard it before.
---
I think the problem is that they're listening to the community too much to be honest. The only thing they were right to listen to was how to communicate- and they listened and are doing much better.
---
But I feel like the community thinks they have Bethesda by the balls- too many already trying to push what they think this game needs to be.. like the majority of us wanted to see if a plan was already learned right? Well this one motherfucker yesterday proclaimed he's not going to play this game anymore *"because what's the point of going to the vendor anymore"*
---
I'm sitting here on the sidelines watching the community make demands, insults, condemn.. almost no one willing to say anything positive at this point because the "community" is fucking toxic as fuck.
---
So yeah, I don't want to see a game being influenced by a bunch of douche bags that think Bethesda owes them for spending up to $60 bucks. It's a fucking joke.
---
For any would be douche bags, give it a fucking rest already- we don't need more negative and toxic bullshit. If it isn't productive, maybe keep your mouth shut.
---
I mean, that's fine, but just drop the plastic if you don't want it. Far easier than individually bulking it a couple times, and it will have the exact same effect. 
---
No no I was only pointing it out its the internet....immaturity is rampant even I fall to it tbh I like complaining and bitching. Echo chambers don't benefit anyone. I love the game I left this sub and went to the other bc it was all I saw was quitting and crying echo and they took my tse echo but even a positive echo can be to much. I've still came back  cause I need balance too.  I just don't want my feed full of wah bags 
---
Ill check later when I get on unless someone responds. I've got some shocks I'm sure it would love to eat.
---
Quicker, sure, but not quick enough to be a big inconvenience to me
---
Or alternatively they can just make some short and sweet goodbyes. I do hate the long name calling complaint posts. Personally I just updated mine and I'm going to maybe play a little tommorow but I'm not sinking 3+ hours a day into it anytime soon. 
---
Id like to know as well
---
Everytime i think maybe I should grab this game for cheap on a key site, there's another one of these that happens. 
---
Yeah i guess i never saw the value of caps tbh myself, and the hassle of getting the plastic to bulk it all. 
---
Id usually just sell some nuke zone mats and stack of chem's along with the odd weapons to get the vendor's 200 when i needed it.
---
I sposse if you wanted max caps to but TSE's and Armour etc it helps...or did at least till they fix it again :/
---
Thanks for the link! Seeing all the wholesome posts is rejuvenating. I'll definitely be over there more.
---
You're the one not understanding that you don't save weight by bulking. Except for aluminium and lead none of the other materials weigh less when bulked. You may think they do because you are destroing the plastic in the process and less plastic equals less weight. If you really just bulk it for vendors you are not making much profit. You can easily clear all vendor cash with some nuked flora. I pity poor souls who keep farming plastic for some fools gold.
---
Look at you go dude, "your opinion is weak." - says guy with superior opinion. 
---
I got tired of arguing this shit with you because it's never going to go anywhere. You just can't stop can you? Bro I've read all facts you presented here and I still think the game is fun and good. This whole time you've been trying to convince me I'm delusional and a fanboy for thinking so and i've just been agreeing with you because you're an idiot. You're talking out of your ass at this point.
---
You took that out of context, what I meant was the majority aren't on reddit bitching and are actually enjoying the game. later prick
---
I don‚Äôt know how many hours it takes to reset but yes.  It does suck.  Can still get lots of caps you just need to do runs at different locations now every other day or so :/ 
---
600 hours is insane, maybe they just want you to go outside.
---
"entitled" yet you're angry because people's opinions are different to yours?
---
‚ÄúI think something fundamentally broke in the last update‚Äù - OP 1 day ago 
---
Every single weapon in my inventory currently breaks within 5-20 minutes. It's really fucking bad. Theres so few good builds and weapons now.
---
FOH
---
Sort by weight it'll bring the heavy stuff to the top.
---
This one's going to be "fun" for the players who carry all their junk around.
---
Maybe in another month Bethesda will add a flag to distinguish between "auto scrap" and "scrap for use".
---
I'd love some flags. I'm thinking I'll have indoor PA stations. I currently have the insides locked and empty because I thought I was reaching my budget too fast decorating with stash boxes but I'm only 70% or so
---
What a substantive post!
---
I know,  I forgot my sarcasm font.  Honestly my only frustration with text based communication.  
---
No need for that. You'd be surprised just how many *adults* don't know how to PC. 
---
No, please don't go! Give us one more chance. We can do better not will be different this time! You'll see!
---
With the newest patch that allows the vendors to always have every item they sell so we don't have to server hop anymore, an answer to the OP question would bring many people joy. Anyone find a list?
---
 "Your concern trolling is a transparent tactic to derail the discussion. Go fuck yourself with a rusty hoe. "
---
This is great logic you've totally destroyed us with.  Great job. 
---
So that's what's happened to my T-60 helmet? I had the Red Tactical light on it, and now it's marked with the Atom symbol in my inventory. 
---
I actually don't mind because now I can tell which is my suit of T-60, but it doesn't really make sense and now I can't trade it if I wanted to. 
---
Amen
---
I can't give you a 100% definite answer, but I've used the loadout manager for over a month now and never had any issues. Nobody I know has gotten banned for using it. It's one of if not THE most popular PC mod, so if something were to happen I'm sure news would spread quickly about it
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ welcome home brother.  Pop this on https://youtu.be/FRPeYP6gS-s and relax.
---
I'm no fan boy lol and I just don't value caps in this game as for the most part they were'nt / aren't needed.
---
If i wanted to add to my caps id just sell weapons etc always seemed quicker to me
---
Pretty sure you can get all the outfits in game....
---
My caps are basically full at the moment, but I still bulk everything so I don't have to fuck around if I'm doing a vendor run.
---
You sure you don't want to buy my 500 ultracite arms, legs, torsos, and helmets?  You know they could be valuable later.....lol
---
I'd love to see a randomized Power Armor Piece plans and Mods Plans loot pool for the queen :)
---
Heck if it's random enough, some of those piece plans and mod plans might actually have some trade value!
---
p.s.  I have 1,000 ultracite explosive vents also up for sale......lol
---
Well it's all about the games I guess. I just switched to a newer Xbox yesterday, but I had a bunch more than 5. Some of them were less than 1gb
---
Who knows.
---
You‚Äôre getting downvoted but I agree with you, and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one. To say that the population of this sub is a tiny fraction of the playerbase is incorrect. I‚Äôd say that even if that was true, it doesn‚Äôt matter. This subreddit is where 99% of the mass reporting of bugs and problems to Bethesda goes on.
---
So they went ahead on the 2 shot nerf.  Doubt I'll ever log back in again.  I'll stick with destiny, anthem and division 2.  Game has to many other bugs for them to nerf dumb stuff like that.
---
The Witcher 3 is already a better Skyrim.   If you haven‚Äôt played it, go do it now!
---
Bethesda cheaped out and rode creation engine into the ground.  If 76 were JUST a lazy cash grab, one last monetization of the old ways, fine.  But that they built Starfield and ES6 on the same pile of shit.  Unforgivable.
---
This comment is dead on point.
---
 OP: You are delusional. 
---
Some of my armor is weightless though :/ and I keep a couple sets of different type (i.e full regenerating, full zealot's, full vanguard), and having it all over the place is almost as bad
---
&gt;" your opinion about being the big dick swinging one-shot shotty badass that you use to be" 
---
I lol'ed at that.  One-Shot Shotty Badass needs to be a rap song. 
---
Cool, did you want a cookie? 
---
Please, yes. And either sort your equipped stuff to the top, or sort armor by body part.

Grammar aside hotfix implies they are fixing things instead of breaking things that were not broken, maybe call it a distraction from the hopelessness 
---
BGS Austin is the group that has the people with multiplayer development experience, Montreal is the microtransaction unit.
---
BGS Maryland is the studio that hasn't really done anything that supports a second player since before Daggerfall. They might be the most experienced at using the Creation Engine, but balancing any sort of multiplayer activity is well outside their forte.
---
This could have been one of the best games ever with just a little bit of better management (more aggressive bug fixing, different release date, etc). Instead you had hundreds if not thousands of youtubers and streamers were making fun of the dumb bugs (that you knew about from beta) in the first month of release.   
---
Good luck milking the last few whales and true fans that are still playing today.
---
I was wondering why my bright headlight for the t-60 all of a sudden changed the set as being flagged as an Atom item.  Makes sense now.
---
How come when I want to craft a weapon and I have all the materials I need it still won‚Äôt craft?

I barely get on, but if you need Pure Water hmu @DrEpicFrag

There is plenty out there.

Wow, no way! Bye

You can also use your photo camera to peek up into the inaccessible oval office for a few loading screen snapshots

---
To some extent, they're not needed, but you have to sell everything for caps before you can buy anything.
---
So even though the prices are shit, it's not like you can just dump a bunch of stuff at a vendor to directly trade for some expensive plan or annoying material.
---
So what are you in for?
---
*shrug*  
---
You could be correct, but it looks, from the feedback from the community, like they as a collective are a little frustrated with how many issues remain, the new issues introduced, the QA Issues, etc.  
---
Maybe a little help wouldn't kill them.
---
Game of the year ?
---
Perhaps a bit. But it's a change to what we are used to.
---
A lot of players don't have too much of extra plastic so you have to be bit careful now.
---
You cannot sell loose junk *that can be bulked.* Loose junk that can't be bulked (e.g., silver, ballistic fiber, screws) has non-zero value and can indeed be sold as is.
---
Now, I'm not telling you how to play your game but it seems inefficient to me to try kill a flying creature solely by punching it to death
---
It took me a month of farming for him to get everything I wanted so don‚Äôt give up 
---
Can‚Äôt wait to hook a 3* Angler and get massacred Jaws style.

Also looking for dense mod plans and BOS combat Armor Legs plans. It‚Äôs another example of information not being in the patch notes ;(
---
amen
---
Yep this is the only reason I used white knight, armor got damaged way to fast.
---
I'm just tired of seeing all of the "I quit" posts, honestly. It's an attention grab: we all know you'll end up playing again within a week, if you want to quit playing just quit playing. 
---
Already did a month ago homie. Let's hope the message sparks a feeling of lets fix this, rather than let's scrap this
---
I would love a cookie.
---
IMO the game missed the mark entirely. I gave it a try, I played it, and just don't enjoy it. Uninstalled around Christmas.
---
But shit in this game doesnt really kill you.  So what's the point.  Take the hit and kill it. Dont pussy foot around it.
---
Finishing the scorched earth event, which gives you some flux/resources
---
Ultracite mod plan (most likely an explosive vent, but it's still the only way to get the good stuff)
---
Prime receiver plan
---
Max level legendary with the potential to be ***
---
and a bunch of crap that any crowned enemy might drop if you still need it
---
Yes, this is exactly the distinction. It took me a while to figure out the rule.
---
omg it's a freaking patch....thats not what a freaking "hotfix" is. hotfixes are supposed to be server side and applied automatically once connected to the internet till they can actually test(fully) and put it into patches. how come every other game has to wait for patch certifications when it seems all they have to do is call it a hotfix and put it out right away?
---
if you played borderlands 2 or any other games in the past you are not actually supposed to download anything in a "hotfix"
---
Prime receivers, yo. The amount of ammo crafted per flux does need some rebalancing since they're currently useless for ammo-chewers, but for sniper rifles? \*kisses fingers\*
---
They don't need to fix it because it was never broken. It was a hoax. Worked fine for me after patch 5, worked fine for all the YouTubers who actually tried it out. worked fine on livestream when people did it there. People were complaining about real problems and some just added fuel to the fire by making up problems that was never there.
---
See ya!
---
once polls close tomorrow i will post detailed pictures of the poll stats i have access too for everyone to see . 
---
I very much want community servers, but first I think we need a solid base game with all major bugs and balance issues sorted. I'm sure more bugs will come with the private servers, with plenty of opportunities for modders to continue doing their work. If I thought Bethesda was willing to incorporate community-developed fixes my answer would be different, but I think they're going to need to get that foundation laid first.
---
Dethroning the monarch and a sense of accomplishment? Or "the true treasure was the friends you made along the way"?
---
I was also confused by this in the comments.  Let's hope for some clarification.
---
I'm so angry with Bethesda at this point, i'm 1 click away from uninstalling the game. Ready to play Anthem.
---
cool analogy but you made it way too complicated. shit happens, shit unhappens, shit happens, shit unhappens. Nothing more to it than that.
---
Or a bunch quit because of the impossible position zenimax, management, and Todd put them in. Now they‚Äôre trying to backfill.
---
Pure bs. They fixed jackshit.
---
If you duped and or participated in it in anyway and got banned too damn bad! üò¢ reap what you sow and move along.
---
I am sure the intern tried it is best?
---
Firstly you keep replying so it‚Äôs your own fault you got a dose of the truth. The fact you resort to swear words tells me you haven‚Äôt much of a leg to stand on. All your arguments against the things I have said were ridiculously weak hence I consider your stance on F76 quite weak and even more so that you consider it a ‚Äúgreat game‚Äù when almost universally people disagree with you. I get it, you are butt hurt. You last reply very much conveyed that. I just feel sorry for you because you clearly haven‚Äôt actually played a ‚Äúgreat game‚Äù.
---
not sure how any of this has anything to do with my comment but uhhh ok....
---
what a sorry ass apologist statement. To think they're operating on the idea of a majority balance vs being completely incompetent. People aren't asking for a balance patch for the try hards, people are asking for a variety in build type, bug fixes, optimization and ***basic features in other games*** people have to argue about it tooth and nail just to get that. Like how many times do they have to drop the ball until you realize how foolish it is to defend this sort of behavior?
---
Serves you right! You goddamn vegetarian hobo.
---
Two shot itself didnt need a nerf.  It giving 100% damage made up for all its problems of not working well in vats and also bad recoil making you miss allot to begin with.  Now they nerfed them down to 25% there is no point in using a two shot weapon.  Two shot wasnt the problem, only the explosive legendary was.
---
With the newest patch (#5 on Jan. 29, 2019), that allows the vendor to have a fixed item list, which prevents us from having to server hop, a list like this would bring many people joy. Anyone find one?
---
Non play to win is kind of a hilarious typo (I hope), typed that way it sounds like you prefer pay to win.
---
Ok thanks!
---
Yes, this is major and it was my first reaction to those patch notes. I immediately figured that they did, in fact, make the change because people ditched the "power armor frame" (gee, wouldn't it be nice to be able to see what's on a frame in your inventory without deploying it?) and I'm okay with it...as long as the SBQ's loot isn't the same as the free plans.
---
Always welcoming new faces. User: vault310. I usually roll with a few people all reasonable balanced players. 
---
No I mean the community that was here before that. The one that will be back after the patch day bitchfest goes away.
---
To a degree yes, but I definitely thinks it‚Äôs possible to over do it for sure. I mean removing the demo expert perk from effecting legendary modifiers would bring the damage down by almost 50% of the bonus damage from perks since gunslinger and riflemen both effect the pipe bolt action. As for if that‚Äôs intended we still don‚Äôt know but since it survived so many patches it must be as intended to bring the pipe bolt action to the level of a sniper damage wise? But yeah demo expert was 100% bonus damage of my 235% damage increases to my weapon in my current build not factoring the 2.5x sneak attack. With demo expert out that woulda reduced my weapons damage enough to bring it under 1000, which to me seems actually pretty reasonable for a sniper rifle. Especially since the build I have to go sacrifices all QoL perks and armor perks just to go full sneak/glass cannon. But now that the guns been gimped by about 1000 damage what‚Äôs the point of going a sneak build if your forced into combat every time. Now you have to run escape artist just to be a viable sneak build, and making less things viable is always a bad idea in my eyes for the longevity of the game. All in all, this game honestly shoulda never involved pvp. In my eyes pvp was the deciding factor, and since this games assets all come from a single player game, this game was fatally flawed from the start. Ballance will never be achieved for pvp in a game based around the single player game of fallout 4, I just don‚Äôt see it being possible. 
---
I believe the patch for the TSE weapons was needed but again they have got it wrong to me they have gone from one extreme to the other would have been better to drop the power of TSE down by half especially when I have to constantly now grind for materials to make more bullets as I am chewing through them like crazy also the excavator armour weight problem is so annoying I can spawn in with a weight of 400 plus but then for some reason it will drop to 320 and then will go back to 420 and if I get out of the armor it drops to 320 permanently until I leave the world and spawn back in, fix it so when you get out of the armour the weight stays the same.
---
Last night I was rebuilding my camp and I was running out of resources went and farmed some more stuff and the excess junk I tried to put back into my stash it said my stash limit was 625 and I knew I had room prior, also have been finding a bug with my mutations, sometime when I spawn in my marsupial mutation will not allow me to jump until I leave the world and it rests itself, all in all Bethesda have managed to break a good franchise in Fallout, I am not enjoying this game anymore and I suppose many other people are not either because when I go into the worlds now there is very few players, I am on PC by the way. 
---
Whew looks like a lot of work :P
---
I can understand why these updates take so long. Changing a single value must be hard on their fingers.
---
How are those mutations holding up?
---
" Max level legendary with the potential to be \*\*\* "
---
lol?
---
I don‚Äôt see the game as a trash.. people have recently complained about how the nerf broke many builds which made them really disappointed (me included). However i don‚Äôt see anyone saying the game is useless... 
---
\#LeaveRadWormsAlone ! :D
---
U suck at trading....I had shit on of good weapons before I was level 40 waiting to use. 
---
I think just offering a free respec to those who's builds were royally screwed over due to the nerf would have gone a long way. 
---
There's no ferrying though.  You log into both accounts.   Mule account just chills in your base.  You fire him up, and just use him like a stash.  There is no pain about it.  You literally just alt +tab between the 2 accounts.  It couldn't be easier.  
---
Of course this works easier on PC than console.   Console sounds like it would be cancer to do this with, unless you legit have 2 consoles.  
---
How many times are we gonna have to teach you this lesson, old man?
---
Yeah, I liked using it, too. The worst part is that it worked perfectly well (I had been running T.HUD for a while, and only rarely crashed), but a prior patch broke it.
---
I agree with the overall sentiment here and so I'll upvote. Every patch brings a load of improvements but there are usually some very questionable changes as well. This is what people focus on the most and it leads to an exaggerated response. No doubt about that. But I think that your idea of "most players aren't affected so it's not important" is not only false but a dangerous mentality. 
---
In regards to the demo expert Nerf:
---
"The damage bonus it previously provided was very high and was causing balance problems, especially when combined with the Explosive Rounds Legendary mod"
---
More like ONLY when combined with explosive rounds. Explosive weapons are still tragically under powered especially for their weight : ( 
---
The White Knight Nerf actually makes sense but it is rightfully ill regarded. The problem being that ballistic fiber is simply too boring and too hard to farm. You may play more casually, ignoring or rarely engaging in end-game content but this is a major kick in the teeth to the people who invest the most time and effort into this game.
---
That is just from the latest patch. Let's not forget the non-sensical Nerf to event cool-downs and such. My point being, while I agree that people tend to overreact, it is not a good idea to throw your hands up and say "this doesn't affect me so whatever". I think Bethesda would have had a much better reaction if they made an effort to lace in some of the much needed buffs with the nerfs. So it isn't all take and no give.
---
I think this is a huge over reaction.  People are trying to hard to form a rally when the rally is if you're upset.  Stop posting about them, stop supporting them, and stop trying to rally others.  If you're upset then boycot.
---
I don't care because I don't get this involved in games.  I am a casual player so I find all these gripes (no offense to anyone) silly.
---
I get it though from the other side and I support the complaints too, but as an individual with choices it comes down. To don't support or support.  Unfortunately there are casual gamers like myself who will support because they aren't totally worried about hardcore buy in like many are.
---
Did they promise offline mode?
---
I thought that was the one thing they never promised?
---
Pretty sure each mini nuke does like 400 damage which if so would do 3200 damage if all hits are successful. 
---
Gotta love autocorrect on mobile 
---
&gt;There is also a huge issue with **all** legendary items. They **completely negate any reason to craft any armor or weapon past level 50**.  This is a large part of the games content, which if we are honest is severely lacking.
---
Don't speak in absolutes and then backpedal when you know what I meant. Your Medic's Gatling Gun does not make craftable items totally obsolete. If you said "huge issue with explosive/two shots" or "huge issue with bloodied", okay. But you didn't. 
---
Also, mods. You craft to deconstruct for mods. Or, at least you did, before that was bannable XD
---
Don't buy Bethesda games. 
---
I'm a dad to ,I feel ya I like to play to relax not get frustrated. this game was far from ready to release but I'm glad you are enjoying it good luck bro
---
Oh good, a other post like this.
---
I was getting antsy. It's been a whole 7 minutes till the last one. 
---
Oh wow awesome thanks.
---
What i really don't understand is how the hell do you guys manage your stash with so much bulk. Without bulk for me it's easy because i just keep 100 of everything and 300 of most important materials. With bulk you need a frikin calculator because not all stacks are equal. No wonder i see people spending 1 hour in their CAMP, all they do is manage their inventory while i do it in 5 seconds and go back looting. Selling bulk to vendors is the least effective method to empy vendor cash. Fools gold i guess.
---
I'm not the one expending mountains of effort whining about a video game like a toddler.
---
Yeah they did, but they never said when exactly. 
---
I heard something like late 2019 early 2020
---
Add the flag back, you mean. It worked fine prior to the patch, which broke it for crafting, then the hotfix broke it's protection against "Scrap All".
---
Translation, seen ome guys not sure what they doing MUST BEHAX0RS!
---
That's what you get for Tato-rustlin'
---
Good post with some good points. I play a lot and want more content in the worst way. However, I am also aware that I play more than most and am ahead of the curve. IMO FO76 has become a bit of a fad in regards to bashing.  
---
Some patches can be done that way, (especially if they are server-side only) but it's not specifically what the term means. Hotfix is usually used to indicate something important that needs to be released and was not in the planned patch/release schedule. Generally high-priority fixes for critical issues that were newly introduced, or sometimes for long-standing bugs that may have just recently been discovered.
---
Also, if the impact isn't completely breaking or service-interrupting, a Hotfix will likely be preferred over a full rollback of the breaking change. (I.e. as bad as the new flaws were that were introduced in the last fo76 patch, It would be much worse to have to do a full revert of those changes, at least from Bethesda's perspective.)
---
When does Bethesda quit fucking up?
---
I‚Äôm sorry I had lmao to but I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that big of an issue. How often does this happen to you that you are requesting it to be removed from the game?Safe to say there are probably 5000 legitimate concerns with the game that should be addressed before this is even a thought. 
---
In conclusion: I hope that you remain standing in all of your Appalachian endeavors! 
---
So wait, are you saying they *aren‚Äôt* going to fire the whole dev team because of a post on Reddit?! But the post got gold!!!
---
Nearly as infantile and petty as leaving because of the nerf, but not quite.
---
Saying people are infantile assumes we don't also have them and are jealous, this is not the case, I have TSE handmade.

Best way is to go into a time machine and travel back a couple weeks and farm whitespring nukes.

Wow shut up...

Yellow armor = Excavator power armor
---
I'll try to launch a nuke before :(
---
Great write up! 
---
I've spent the majority of the the first 80-100 hours just exploring the map. Going through locations and looting. Scrapping items. Building homes, scrapping homes, relocating and building again etc. It was only recently I started questing, killing the queen and now at my about 150 hour mark I finally launched my first nuke. 
---
Post- ‚ÄúHotfix‚Äù (31 January 2019):
---
Confirm non-expiring [Caution] status, when hidden and area cleared.
---
Left area, crouched, by a far margin, still [Caution]. Fast traveled to C.A.M.P., [Hidden] resets.
---
Yep, yep, No.
---
Good advice but I'd personally recommend not using ccleaner, it's slowly got full of bloatware with all the free trial mode stuff and about 18 months ago was the subject of a major vulnerability. Programs like that were relevant back when people had 30GB harddrives, these days you're more likely to cause yourself problems.
---
If you really want something for privacy reasons I'd recommend looking into Bleachbit, which I believe is open-source.
---
Ive only ever used my TSE in pvp and it was accidental. A Full X01 Level 100 Power Armour was harrassing the level 14 member of our group. He threw a grenade at us. It scraped me and i near instantly swung around and one hit him
---
They do not mention that they are planning to fix the damage rollback bug, and their statement does not acknowledge what I believe really happened.
---
I see people here talking about being level 200+, having **16,000lbs of junk on mule accounts**, and having multiple tse weapons. 
---
That's not us. That's not the majority, and that's not even indicative of the people, like myself, that play often but not hard core. I'm tired of the people that play ten or more hours per day, every single day, acting like they're anything but the highly vocal minority 
---
Complaining isn't inherently immature. I feel like that's something that's getting lost in all this discussion.
---
Couldn't I just as easily say its immature to be quiet about issues, and go to a community designed to ignore them because its hard to just see people complain about something you like?
---
Actually nvm, I do believe that is immature. This sub was allegedly created for discussion, and that means sometimes there's going to be discussion you don't like. It has been about 48 hours since the broken update, and OP is trying again to get people who feel like victims to move to a new subreddit. this isn't like weeks and weeks of negative complaining. It's just two days. 
---
I can see from your history that this subreddit was perfectly suited for all your fallout 76 related discussion until the update rolled out. In just one day "I just don't want my feed full of wah bags" became your label for this sub, and you sought out a place built only for the downplay of complaints.
---
There was actually a post by u/qualityspoork that outlined and compared the weight of items in bulk vs. the same quantity of individual scrap needed to bulk junk and the weight savings or weight gain of each I just pulled it up to look at it and it goes
---
Bulk Aluminum(.13) vs .30 for scrap, bulk copper(.25) vs .30 for scrap, bulk cork(.08) vs .10 for scrap, bulk fertilizer(.50) vs .60 for raw, bulk lead(.25) vs .60 for scrap, bulk oil(.25) vs .30 for waste, bulk springs(.25) vs .30 for loose. 
---
Those were the 8 that I had mentioned some are very small gains until large amounts in which case the main weight savings is definitely in the loss of plastic... but any little bit helps!!!!!
---
Laser pointers are great, maybe you‚Äôll blind the thing you hit.
---
They need substantial damage increases too.
---
The open demo is tomorrow at 11am CST if you're interested in giving it a go!
---
Doesn't sound like duping to me. There's a glitch where sometimes power armor doesn't show up on a character, that's where the long arms and legs come in. I often collect 120 units of dirty water to boil it back to (slightly) cleaner boiled water. And Whitesprings is a known spawn point for ghouls. The yellow power armor will be excavator armor.
---
I knew someone would say this. Didn‚Äôt seem legit for a level 12 to be fighting enemies this high. He also had power armor he couldn‚Äôt legit wear at lvl 12, I think?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt put it that simple. 
---
F76 invited multiplayer audiences. You know what a multiplayer are? Younger. 
---
And you know what they‚Äôre used to playing? Battlefield. Call of Duty. Fortnite. 
---
And how have these games brought them to understand games? 
---
Strong gun + FPS skill should get you through the toughest battles in the game. 
---
Fallout (any fallout) is t like that. You need to work the game‚Äôs mechanics. Learn the system. Stack effects. Make painful compromises. Adjust play style to qualify for the conditions the perks, effects, mutations or mods set. You have to, you know, play the game. 
---
TSE‚Äôs has an unintended effect. It inadvertently gave them one gun that was powerful enough to not need to do all that.  And all of a sudden they got the Fortnite experience they found familiar. 
---
But then Bethesda said ‚Äúsorry guy, that‚Äôs not the direction we‚Äôre taking this game. Your access to a million of these guns in circulation was unintended; we won‚Äôt take them away, but we will tone them down so you have to play the game and it‚Äôs mechanics as intended‚Äù. 
---
And that threw them off into ‚Äúgame mechanics who?‚Äù And ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt a single gun that on its own is enough to be end-game powerful; I don‚Äôt do all that game mechanics stuff, your call of duty title is broken‚Äù. 
---
All the old timers (those who haven‚Äôt been put off by the new F76 formula) are looking at this and going tsk-tsk-tsk...
---
I didnt even see him, i just shot when i turned around and i bullseyed his torso
---
Yeah but that's not normal protocol, and Bethesda isn't experiencing an extreme breakdown of internal systems as far as anyone with any sort of credibility knows.
---
I am following the OPs advice.  To avoid throwing good time after bad time(and to send Bugthesda a message), I am uninstalling.¬†   
---
Peace....
---
The message that you are posting in the wrong subreddit now?
---
I'm playing Fallout 4 right now and it's a shame because I realize how much I was enjoying 76 until they nerfed my explosive radium rifle. It wasn't even a two shot.
---
Yeah. My friends stopped listening to me after I got them all to buy Star Wars: The old Republic, Rift, and Age of Conan
---
Ah...The sound of a bunch of pouting RAIDERS.  Priceless.  Because regardless of what you called yourselves or whatever justification you spat out, you were behaving like raiders...and see how they ended up in the game.  All dead.  Raiding is NOT a sustainable lifestyle.
---
TSE was insanely overpowered.  I purchased one from another player about a week before the patch.  Had to claw my way through a bunch of Super Mutants to get to the seller and after he sold it to me, plowed through the remainder holed up inside West Tek.  It was euphoric and terrifying at the same time.
---
Before the patch, if you had a TSE, you had the touch of death.  It felt like nothing in the game could stop you.  Death was less than three trigger pulls away.  But there was a counter for other players...White Knight and a few associated perks.  If I ran into the wrong person, my shiny new TSE had no effect.
---
After the patch, someone engaged me in PVP, and this time I was able to win in a much more fair fight.  For those who have read my previous posts, this time when I was shot in the back while trading with a vendor, I didn‚Äôt hesitate.  I pulled out my automatic gamma gun and shot the perpetrator dead.  It felt liberating!
---
I‚Äôm THRILLED the patch took care of these exploits, because I know it will make for a better game for the masses.  As the original poster stated, the casual player.  Without the few to give the masses grief, this game has a chance to survive its terrible kickoff.  
---
I hope to be one of the players to stick around years from now, so I can watch the newcomers that venture down a particular quiet (well, except for the crickets) country road only to find a repurposed mining tower, and a middle aged man around level 108, to tell them tales about the ‚Äúdark times‚Äù when this world was much more savage.
---
They could have gave the remastered current gen version to people who had the base game and DLC on the 360 and PS3
---
The moment I read that ESO would have "open dungeons" I thought "Fuck that, I'll have to pass on this" 
---
As a console player, not really. Mod fixes are totally of no value to people not on PC platforms. I also have some fundamental disagreement with the idea that the community should be fixing Bethesda's problems at all. It's kind of a band-aid fix and falsely removes the responsibility from the actual developers to fix their own problems.
---
Yes but why trading should be the main focus of the game. Yes it's a online game where the economy is the most important thing but don't you think that there should be another way. I prefer to find that gun not just go and buy it. Plus the hours of server hopping to get the caps for that legendary gun + the fact that there will be a chance of that gun being duped.  
---
I believe the thread was ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what junk you should bulk to free some weight in your stash.‚Äù Pretty good long read actually!
---
Lol it's okay
---
The "vocal" minority calling out the bugfest of  fo76 is the exact reason why I won't buy the game until it's bug free. If it's not, then I will never buy it. 
---
How sad of a person do you have to be to enjoy a full fledged broken product that you paid full price for and were completely ripped off? ü§£
---
Wow, almost like all of these things have been brought up a ton! Oh my gosh! Almost like if you use your eyes instead of hiding behind your shill blinders you would see that.
---
Also yeah, shouldn't have happened, and two shot didnt need nerfed. Pretty simple bud.
---
Sure. Are you saying he deserves to ruin the fun of everybody else?
---
Man oh man.
---
For me, since the patch, they don‚Äôt respawn nearly as fast anymore.
---
Over the past few weeks, the respawn time for me has stretched out slowly. Chem boxes take about a week now to respawn for me. When I find a new chem box or crate, it seems like less items than what I would find in others a month ago. 
---
I like the game when it works. The lack of NPC is lame. I refuse to buy anything that like DLC, Atoms, etc for this game because they fucked it up so badly.
---
Oh, thank G-d!
---
Sounds about normal to me. I usually burn about 60 hours in more linear games, 300ish for open world, and several thousand in MMOs - it's a standard for myself as well. Anything lower in my libraries are most likely from bundle sales, of which I have little intention to play.
---
It was happening in the middle of the golf range. No water around. It just seemed like he was doing something fast.   
---
His power armor appeared randomly after a while of doing this. Seems related to what you‚Äôre saying 
---
Bethesda prob didn't want to say to much as they weren't 100% sure if this fix would fix or not lol 
---
I guess we wait a week now for the next empty vague ITV ; )
---
From my point of view, for what it's worth (admittedly nothing) if there were any real world consequences being applied at Bethesda, pushing out a patch that was so flawed would have resulted in firings.   
---
Can you imagine if an automaker like Tesla pushed out a firmware update to their vehicles that was this flawed?  Or worse yet, an automated prescription filling machine company pushing out an update like this.  Both could easily result in deaths, but somehow this is 'acceptable' behavior from a game company. 
---
I know in the broadcast industry, this kind of sloppy work would result in you getting canned, no questions asked.
---
THANK YOU!!! &lt;3 Friends and I will make use of your stuff, I really appreciate it. What games are you planning to play instead?
---
Good Bot
---
I wish container respawn happened that fast for me!
---
This Patch convinced me to delete the game from my PS4, and I hated explosive weapons as well but this patch had a whole lot of uneeded nerfs that didnt fix any problems.  Time to move on to better games.  All the bugs and glitches already brought me back to destiny and with the new games comming out in Feb and march and this terrible patch I'm convinced to move on.
---
People can only get jerked around so much before even die hard fans get pissed off. 
---
you could just find people with those plans and purchase the item you are after for a fraction of the price. It sure as heck beats rolling those RNG dice for a couple months.
---
I'm thinking that PC players having the majority of issues and your statement might have something in common.. like I wonder how many other programs and processes they have running when I hear about their issues. Mainly because I know people that are tech savvy and haven't had any issues whatsoever..
---
That's a bug, not deliberate AI. Also, I did say "Most."
---
No I'm trying to not be a dick that's why I left but I guess I could but that would be immature kinda like speaking down to people who you don't know their reasoning  behind their decisions 
---
I love how dozens of posts were made like this months ago and everyone was so fucking butthurt they downvoted it, because they couldn't understand that the people bitching about it- Were fans to and *actually* wanted the game to succeed.   
---
Yet you guys constantly downvoted saying stupid fucking shit  like, "Well I'm at least having fun with the game!"   
---
Who's having fun with a broken game now you fucks? Who's making a post like this get thousands of upvotes all of a sudden?   
---
Most of you guys deserve this game 100% as it was the day of release. Most of you are Twats and if you guys really want to show Bethesda you mean business, uninstall the game. 
---
Bunch of garbage then really
---
&gt;The level 12 had yellow decked out power armor.
---
Zis is not possibil!
---
Haha yes well labeling that power armor would have been a better fix than giving the plans away. 
---
Well because of 76. I decided to play Fallout 4 again and oh boy there is a difference.
---
Keep sucking that corporate c-ck
---
true but guerrilla wasn't in fallout 4 what i am saying is they need to make the perk useful and give SMGs into this category 
---
It doesn't matter who they hire, management is asking them to work the long hours. They are working the long hours. The fact of the matter it doesn't matter who you are, after a certain point of tiredness you will make more mistakes.
---
An effective management team recognizes that after a certain point of tiredness people will make more mistakes and doesn't push them to that point.
---
&gt; The sooner many of you realize that were are griping to a terribly small sample size you'll realize that your heart is in the right place, but the wrong platform. 
---
Please, oh wise casual, tell us how to "gripe" correctly. 
---
there's a point where even the biggest of fans can have their relationship turn sour.
---
And then knowing Bethesda it‚Äôll either lag like hell for some people or just have constant crashes which won‚Äôt be fixed until Q4 2021
---
i understand, i'm upset too, but the game itself can still be enjoyable, yes?
---
ain't that just as fallout-y as it gets?
---
Must be game of the year if its the only game OP ever played hey!
---
I‚Äôm on now.  GT is denstreifen
---
They did it too the bright one too
---
Poor Tim. I know his feels.
---
You're absolutely right about the whole percentage of players thing.
---
But when you look at other stats such as total time played, most likely to recommend the game, most likely to purchase atoms, most likely to circulate news etc, then actually we do constitute a really considerable percentage of the *important* demographic
---
What I did was just craft Power Fists (no idea where I found the plan) then scrap them as suggested at the lowest level. I went through 10-15 before I got the puncturing mod. Don't have heated, but didn't want that since it's less powerful anyway. I am currently level 126 and have a legendary level 50 Instigating Power Fist (Double damage if the target is full health) which makes it great for Whitesprings leveling (or anything not a Scorchbeast or Deathclaw.) But keep in mind, I'm a melee build.
---

---
BAH HA HA HA! Yes, yes, \*of course\* cramming a random map generator into this engine should be just as easy as doing so for a game designed to do it from the get go. You can tell by the amount of random map generators we've been downloading for FO4, instead of complete meticulous world rebuilds that spend ages just getting the basic map done.
---
Or are you saying nobody, modder or dev, have ever seriously considered the possibility, and all that's missing from a Fallout Random Map Utopia is a few weeks of effort from a small team? You should assemble a small crack team of 90's would-be hackers to make this. Be sure to tape their hands on the keyboard, I'd like to learn to code too!
---
No, seriously though, if a random map generator was that easy to implement, we'd already have Random Vault Interiors V4 on Nexus right now. I mean, it's not like it hasn't been discussed before...
---
Is bobble head stacking still a thing?
---
&gt;att
---
It has everything to do with fanboyism.
---
The problem before was that it ignored that flag for crafting &amp; repairing, which is why it automatically scrapped X-01 shocks. They need two separate flags.
---
Well if you can get in to the military wing, you can get plans for X01 off the terminal for free, but the vendor doesn't carry them
---
They can totally make a lore explanation for legendaries in this game (maybe not off stingwings)
---
But what I‚Äôm saying is that regular guns are so bad to the point where you need a god-good rolled legendary to live well
---
Product is a product doesn't matter what it is
---
...which isn't craftable at a level the level 12 could equip, is it?
---
1 shot who with the dethclaw gauntlet???
---
Ghouls?? Players??? Squirrels? 
---
Guns are viable. They just cant be a 1 shot in PvP.  That makes melee not viable in pvp.
---
3 or 4 shots is how it should be
---
&gt;What the company needs its its player base to communicate in a constructive manor.
---
You're obviously new to this subreddit, you can find dozens of constructive posts that have been downvoted by the fucking plebs that say they're "still having fun" with the game. 
---
Okay so it is still in my PA?
---
Phew!
---
1.2 is for the 20% damage bonus from explosive and 1.6 is the 60% damage bonus from the explosive perk card. Since the perk card only buffs the explosive damage you have to multiply it with the explosiv bonus damage and not the total gun damage. 
---
Jesus Christ its like a cult
---
Ive done that multiple times on the lever rifle and handmade and never got banned.  I'm sure there is more to his or her story than what they have told you.
---
It was a glitch as they ate releasing a mothman paint they where using it as a base but they messed up the file
---
Too late man I've called it quits. Just can't be bothered.  
---
Ps: Have fun tho
---
I'm a super try hard, no life min maxer and I'm still just playing the game as normal too. So what if they brought back bugs, so you have any idea how many games I've played that have done that? It's not a huge deal people. Never ran white knight either, because it doesn't increase dam, speed or health.
---
Now that you're done, can you unsubscribe from the subreddit?    
---
If you want to see real change in the community, uninstall yourself, and send a tangible message so we all understand. Also, we'll be happier because we won't feel obligated to read your whine-y daily, or whatever keeps you complainin' every fucking day. 
---
If you can't understand why your friend might have different interests, then I wonder how good of a friend you are, lol.
---
I can run forwards in 76
---
That would be really awesome... Just make like a Fusion Core Recharge Station, or something...
---
Although, even if it were implemented, I'm sure it'd be resource intensive... i.e. Stable Flux.
---
point being what?
---
Customers do not care about how hard the life of a dev is...unless your looking to buy the most over worked dev ever then maybe 
---
Damn all we need is AI humans and it might as well be a sequel to 4.
---
Have you not been in Burning Mine? It's an actual location in-game.
---
Its true!
---
I‚Äôm glad! :)
---
Oh, so it should only do 5-6 nukes worth of damage instead.
---
Or 2 bigger ones (regular Fatman maxes out at 1091)
---
I... Still disagree.
---
Cant play now, ill add u and see if  ur online anytime, then we can. 
---
The team might have been waiting just outside the golf club's radius for him to trigger the respawn glitch.
---
Ah! Makes sense. 
---
I pre-ordered and enjoy the game despite some buggy play at times. My friends bought the game on sale after a few weeks. We are up to five of us playing nearly every day and we like it. Shrug. 
---
Meanwhile RDR2 is collecting dust for two months. You can‚Äôt anticipate what will catch on with a group of friends. There are plenty of games I was tired of after a couple of weeks. 
---
Yeah this most of all convinces me 
---
you think?
---
So again not sure what hes doing so must be cheating?
---
Level 25
---
Yes and no. 
---
I'd want these servers only if all achievements were disabled and there was some limitation on their use. I wouldn't want Bethesda to use this as an excuse to not fix things
---
I LOVE LOVE LOVE that you call people entitled pricks because they aren't posting what YOU want. Doesn't that, ya know, make YOU the entitled prick? 
---
False positivity. It‚Äôs bugs, not the egregious balance changes they made. The Inside The Vault notes are not reassuring either
---
"Scrap all" now scraps all your bulk items. lol
---
Happened to me too. Can't sign in at all. So... all of the mods I owned and maintained on [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net)? Yep. No access.
---
100% agree- just posted a similar thought-
---
What do you mean? One is a software glitch, and the other is physically walking into a store and stealing things
---
How does a level 12 equip power armor?
---
&gt; FO76 is in no way behind schedule for content update compared to the previous game.   
---
Except FO4 launched with quite a bit more content than FO76.  
---
Just take a minute and compare the number of quests between the games.  
---
Launching an online game with no endgame loop is nothing but a clear sign of incompetence.  
---
Launching an RPG with nothing but a handful of quests is nothing but a clear sign of incompetence.  
---
Now, one can argue where the incompetence lies: With management, the studio, the designers, or the developers. But no matter where the fault falls, it's still incompetent bollocks.  
---
The issue is less with... issues.. and more that the game is just not fun once you hit a very sharp edge. It goes from being fun and challenging, to nothing to do whatsoever in the span of literal minutes.  
---
A fun game that has issues is still a fun game; A bad/boring game that has no issues is still a bad/boring game.  
---
If FO76 had content, a proper gameplay loop, more than a handful of quests, etc.. It would be much easier to excuse the never-ending stream of poorly excused issues, bugs, and missteps.
---
I read about mod support might come late 2019 along with private servers, never heard anything to suggest single player mode though.
---
Don't stress at all mate. Timezones are a pain in the a\*\* sometimes :)
---
I‚Äôm starting to think they don‚Äôt have tools to test the game, they plan, code, check the code, and hope there isn‚Äôt a flaw on it before releasing. 
---
Don‚Äôt feel bad, I did the same thing the first few days with Pharma Farms.
---
My cooldowns are 2+ days on some boxes. It annoys me that I have the card maxed out and when I am able to use it, it doesn‚Äôt always give extra. 
---
Have fun with it! It is definitely one of my fav cards.
---
Are you sure he wasn't level 120?
---
So they were a shit shot then?
---
Its level 25 for the quest to get the stuff to make it, can you get given a set and use it at any level?
---
I'm like 90% sure that a hotfix doesn't have to be small. 
---
In software development a major issue that need to be fixed immediately results in a "firecall"... pretty sure that is why it is a "hotfix". 
---
Yes.  Because this couldn't possibly be the work of professionals.
---
i may wrong. im confident regarding vendors but not sure when it comes to containers.
---
I regularly craft hundreds of Dirty Water into Boiled Water at once spamming E and Enter. 
---
Using Super Duper, Green Thumb, and a Bonus XP item it's pretty easy to get a ton of experience and have a lot of saleable items to show for it in the end.
---
&gt;ull
---
The game was sold with the idea it would have content released after launch.
---
These bug fixes and patches are trying to fix things that should never have been present in the release. On top of that Bethesda continuously fail at even fixing what they claim to have fixed.
---
I'm glad your expectations for a $60 product from a corporation are so flexible, but other people do have actual standards and expectations and the bullshit Bethesda has pulled with not only FO76s release but the terrible patching and lack of QA testing is the kind of practice that becomes endemic because people just accept it and never speak up about it being wrong.
---
Suns fan. 
---
This happened to me on PS4 last night as well. A 3 star Legendary Mirelurk Queen, took her down...and unlootable. Then ran into a Flatwoods Monster (my first!) and after a loooooong battle (rehealing?) I killed it...only for it to teleport halfway through a tree and also be unlootable. 
---
Everything its a bloody deathcalw gauntlet
---
Well, you have to :-)
---
LOL, what? This is terrible if true, just imagine you just bulked up all your excess materials for your daily round of sales at vendors, pick up a desk fan and a battered clipboard on the way, come by a bench and [scrap all] because it's routine, only to find out you just wasted 200 plastic for nothing?
---
Not too bad my ass. Three small changes in this hotfix, and one of them is another clusterfuck already. Yikes.
---
The satisfaction of a job well done and the adulation of a grateful populace.
---
Wait, what is that exactly?
---
I have not been excited about nearly all of the patch notes so far.  A game like this should have playable pool / poker tables, fishing, etc.  There is no way you can let characters build a new immersive society without the ability to do anything social other than grind.    
---
I would gladly join with some allies and have a nice evening chatting and fishing ( or playing holdem) otherwise you pretty much are just sitting there.    
---
It also shouldn't be that hard to implement...
---
The sense of camaraderie as the majority of the server forms a giant team unified by a single... Sorry, I just got two-shotted by someone who is *already bored* and wants to PVP.
---
They said it‚Äôs a bug, they will fix at some point.
---
And yet I'm sure there are plenty of us who know how to actually use a computer and still have problems that we can do nothing about because it's the game or servers.
---
The alternate solution would have been to create a `BulkJunk` (or whatever) keyword that gives the bulk items all of the properties of `NoAutoScrapJunk` except that they can be auto-scrapped for crafting.
---
The one they went with was fast, easy, and perhaps "dirty", but was probably the most reliable route to getting the "scrap when crafting" functionality back for a quick fix without having to devote time to double-check that introducing the new keyword didn't inflict a more dangerous, wide-reaching bug than "I accidentally scrapped all of my bulk lead on the way to the vendor bot".
---
I think this subject goes both ways.  Part of the problem is the circle jerk of hate, but on the other side of the coin is the circle jerk of blindness where any criticism is wrong.  It seems most people have to get extreme with this game.
---
And you know what they've said before...
---
Down with extresimism
---
Can Confirm. Going to school for IT. also, Adam is a great name ;)
---
 Neat don‚Äôt see why you‚Äôd think we cared
---
Found it. Read it long ago. Top comment says the OP had a junk weight perk skewing the numbers. Then in all caps, he says lead and aluminum.
---
Why you‚Äôd need a spreadsheet to figure out that 10x.1=1 or 15x.05=.75 or 30x.05=1.5
---
(All other bulk)
---
Lead and aluminum play out like
---
20x.1=1 then 10x.1=.5
---
Close enough on the name if not...
---
I'm not countering your argument, but I just wanted to state that not everyone paid full price for it. They lowered it a couple weeks later.
---
Warm-fix?
---
Your logic is broken. 
---
The game doesn't need legendary weapons and armor, the game needs the weapons and armor to be viable. Legendary weapons and armor are a lazy replacement for game design.
---
Yes I considered that and double checked. 
---
&gt; Banning people left and right
---
If you're implying that banning accounts that either duped and exploited or those that made it to the Dev Room- ***SHOULDN'T*** be banned, than your entire post is a moot point.   
---
I agree with you on almost everything, but if you don't agree with the banning of exploiters, glitchers, cheaters, dupers, and those who have made it to the Dev room- Than you my friend, are part of the problem. 
---
Also you can force spawn the ghouls at whitespring or could not sure if they broke it fixed it etc. 
---
Needed a group, someone fast travels away runs back and they respawn. Not sure it would be considered cheating tbh :P
---
How sad of a person do you have to be to get joy from other people's (assumed) pain?
---
Oh forgot to mention but this was in Whitesprings Golf right behind the clubhouse. It was fucking massive, filled with heavy turrets on all sides
---
Gotcha. You‚Äôre right when it comes to vendors, though. 
---
They changed this during the ‚Äúhotfix‚Äù.  I was doing the same thing all last night and this mornings. Just checked a fem minutes ago and didn‚Äôt get one legendary the entire time.  
---
BGS seems pretty lousy at making fixing.  They seem to struggle finding a nice balance.  Always one extreme or the other.  
---
Also, many of the ghouls seem to be frozen.  Won‚Äôt take any damage but still showing as alive, very strange...  probably another incoming hotfix to fix the hotfix that fixed the update.  This is getting pretty ridiculous at this point...
---
You... struggle? To do what? I have zero TSE and I don‚Äôt feel like I struggle on either of my characters. 
---
This started because you said I was bitching
---
Sarcasm??
---
Has to be sarcasm...no one could be so we-Todded to pick this as GOTY.
---
Good one OP..wink, wink.
---
They made clear before launch that any DLC/expansions would be free, so don‚Äôt worry about that. I‚Äôve also stuck to the included 500 atoms and whatever I got from playing, so hi5, I guess.
---
Nah I just expect them to implement universal industry standards for code development used in literally any kind of software development. You know, the kind of thing everybody competent in industry does to prevent this exact kind of fuckup?
---
Ok bye :)
---
This is exactly the issue. Their processes need to be analyzed and improved. Not to mention some honest communication. 
---
It‚Äôs actually one of the most useful barrel you can have. It spawn infinite number of boatfly as long as you kept shooting it. And farm acid and meat. 
---
BRAVO!!
---
Bot
---
I think at this point it's more likely they'll add magic and call it TES
---
&gt; This game has been out for 2.5 months \[...\]
---
Yes. And we are outraged (many of us) because of this. We deserve a full functioning game AT RELEASE, or at least a few weeks afterwards. And 2.5 months is a very long time to clean up the mess.
---
&gt; the game is still a baby. 
---
This is not an Early Access version of a indie developer studio! This is a full prices AAA game of a well known and established company. And it was advertised as a AAA game. Sure, not all of us had played through the story (? if there is any?). I also had only a level 30ish character, but I uninstalled the game. Why? Because I don't accept it. When Bethesda does not deliver a Fallout experience AT LAUNCH, I quit playing. Maybe I will give the game a chance when private servers are released and the game gets playable with dozends of mods. When I read the patch notes today with that emergency hotfix, I knew it was the right decision.
---
&gt;  And yes, this is a really sloppy job of running a game.
---
You say it! And we accept that, what will come next? And what will come in the future with Starfield and TES6 and Fallout 5? Fallout 76 had more developer than ever. They had the support of multiple studios. And the experience is worse than just adding multiplayer to Fallout 4/Skyrim. There are bugs present, which were resolved by the community years ago! The first mods for widescreen support came up a few days after launch. Why hasn't Bethesda implemented that in the first way? Because they didn't care. And when we stop caring for good games and do not boycott bad games, there won't be a change. We would have to buy every ingame asset - as it is almost the case already with the Atomic Shop. Selling assets which should be included in the base game shows how Bethesda cares.
---
&gt; But, I will still say that Bethesda took huge steps towards stabilizing the game in this patch. 
---
Just a few more lines about how Bethesda "stablizes" and cares for the game. The limit the frame rate to 60 FPS, because otherwise the physics can go crazy. They limit the maximum carry weight per player, because too many items in the world would cause server stability problems. Instead of balancing TSE or explosive perks, they reduce their effectiveness so that nobody uses it anymore. Things which are not used need no balancing at all - problem solved.
---
They needed a nerf and i have plenty of issues with how the game is now. Just that I can't voice them in the raging outcry about the most OP shit being nerfed. 
---
The mindset that just because you enjoy something means it doesn't have any faults is really unhealthy for the future of video games.
---
You can enjoy something that has faults.
---
Those faults are still worth addressing.
---
Leave the sub too.
---
So you want a powerfull TSE weapon because you think it will be so OP it will shadow everything else but you miss Fallout 4 where it didn't mattered if weapons had a legendary effect or not. You do realise they nefed TSE in this patch to be equal to all other legendaries right? It now only does 20% +25% extra damage, you can easily replace that with any other two legendary effects and be just as powerfull. I have a legendary combat rifle with double damage at full health and i one shot every mob from stealth on headshots. I can'g wait untill ghey nerf melee to so people can finally learn hos to GIT GUD jnstead of just complaining that they can no longer 1 shot enemies while shoting thdm in the chest while spoted instead of learning game mechanics like headshot and stealth and min-maxing. Scorchbeasts and mierluck queens are not regular mobs that you can just wreck solo in 2 seconds. You shoulx bd complajning sbout their trashy drop nog for their bulletsponge health. We need more bulletsponge elite mobs like that mord than anything except Bethesda forgot to make them legendary to drop good loot.
---
In response to this, my second character I made hit 125-130 something like that, and I played through most of the big updates, finally stopping a few weeks ago for this same reason.  I love this series, and really enjoyed this game, but it felt like it was the same thing over and over, and was unable to hold my interest.  Maybe I burned out on it too quick is all.
---
Not only that, they ban your account from all games on the Bethesda launcher (including single player games.)
---
I lost track when I had to struggle to read anymore. Proofread, yo. 
---
OH CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN!
---
Thanks for looking at this, Ladydevann.
---
After doing a quick test at the power station near White Springs train station following the most recent hot fix I believe the sneak behavior may be fixed, back to how it was before patch 5. At least I was able to get really close to some vicious wolves there without 'caution' triggering and even escape artist seemed to work when I shot one of them and quickly backed away. That wolf started moving in my direction but then seemed to have 'lost my scent'.  
---
I'll do some more testing tomorrow to confirm for sure.
---
In the meantime, the requested details
---
I'm level 39 with sneak rank 3, escape artist and 1 piece of chameleon armor.
---
Before the patch I was able to get very close up to enemies (\~5-6 meters even) while remaining 'hidden' or get off a shot or two, back away with the enemies going to my last location and remain there clueless (thanks to escape artist, I guess), rinse-repeat.   
---
After the patch 'caution' would trigger from miles away, and enemies would start coming at me as if I was just running around without any sneaking perks.
---
Why do you play with that piece of shit game? Banned?, god they made you a fucking favor...
---
Time to step up and find better things 
---
I hadn‚Äôt any with me. He luckily was just outside of the 1st nuke. My mates went and tried to quickly send a 2nd one but he took it off
---
&gt; creation logs
---
Yeah ... imma guess they aren't logging as much as they need to be to effectively police the game.
---
Bleed and poison and rad effects have a chance to give disease for each point they apply. It‚Äôs guaranteed when fighting ghouls sadly.
---
Umm guys now I cannot sell bulk to vendors.   Sigh
---
I think the guns are perfectly balanced if you ask me. Everyone is just used to one shot kills these days.
---
There nothing like they should. A two shot fat man does as much damage as a sledge hammer. A legendary rolling pen does as much damage as my legendary handmade. Just blows my mind 
---
Of course not dying was not the issue. It was at this moment but that's not the problem. I have thought so many times that theses animations are too slow and because of that annoying. But it's true there are so many things more important to change I agree. Just want that in the future they will change that. If a future will be

"You don't do it the way I do! You suck!"   /s

Except it's not at all incorrect. There is zero requirement that a hotfix have no server downtime.  A hotfix typically refers to a deployment made outside of the normal delivery cadence.  Often times this is a small fix that doesn't require downtime for the product, but that is not always the case. It doesn't even necessarily require a "server" -- you can hotfix a battery.

Blizzard agrees: " A hotfix is a change made to the game deemed critical enough that it cannot be held off until a regular content patch."
---
TL;DR -- you're wrong, Bethesda is using the phrase correctly
---
They were never reverted to begin with, at least not for Poseidon.
---
Don‚Äôt cure radworms and keep it for as long as possible.

Can i have your stuff

Wouldn't sweat it. 2-3 orbital strikes and I'd keep doing my thing. I can see it being an issue for lower level guys who would get chewed up by the turrets tho.

At this point is it a fallout game ? This is fallout online... just make it free to play.

What if you've barely started it? I just can't bring myself to play it for some reason... I'm still like level 7 or something...

sure bigger holes are more lethal on soft targets, but the Yamato's 18inch guns weren't anymore effective than the Iowa's 16inch.

Pretty sure that would be considered an exploit

How the fuck can you end up playing someone else's character?
---
BS on this one, must be someone using there PC / console without them knowing? Or there's 2 of them living in one head?
---
From what I tested with heavy weapons - every damage perk helps.
---
I agree that 9 points for pure damage is too much and all weapons should have been like demo expert is now. 
---
probably because its one of the most newest games to have been remastered so far.
---
Circle jerking against bethesda since announcement night does not help the fallout community.  
---
Logged in yesterday, killed my first 2 Scorchbeast Queens, got a melee upgrade, made a couple friends after I PvP'd them at a workshop, finished a couple quests, built up my current camp. Under a dollar per hour of fun, and you can make the launch price of the game in less than a day of hard work.
---
Repeatedly saying bethesda is "objectively" pro-hitler, that doesn't make it true.
---
I just want them to add 10mm smg and submachine gun to guerrilla perk instead of commando

Firstly you replied lol. Secondly I don‚Äôt need to dumb dumb. Just type F76 reviews into google and just glance at the first five results. Type F76 into YouTube and be amazed by all the negative vids. I‚Äôm not your paralegal and it‚Äôs pretty obvious that info is every where.

Enemies detect me faster. Often I can't escape by crouching and uncrouching. Stays much longer in danger mode or caution. Sometimes stays there for long times even when no enemies in sight or even there. don't hear them.. miles away.. Tested it for hours in west tek because I lvled there after the patch. Before the patch I got detected less often and the meter was moving faster. It seems to be a basic problem after the patch not only in certain areas.
---
That's the "fans" biggest mistake, there is no relationship with a company like Bethesda other than give monies please.
---
Well i hadn‚Äôt any (and not sure how you get them btw). The real problem was the lag (getting hit by a horde of invisible glowing ones ain‚Äôt fun) and the crashes
---
What about the billion trash legendary weapons and armor?
---
Yeah I've had a few frozen enemies of various types. Alive? Dead? Unknown. Unsearchable/unkillable? _Of course_

Yeah that kind of idea

I got a good video of one backwards running off into the distance despite being dead and lootable, lol

It doesn‚Äôt matter what the profession is if you work someone for 16 hours a day repeatedly, they will make mistakes.

That is why you structure your company so you don't work people 16 hours a day.

How many hours a day the developers work is not a decision they make, that is a decision  management makes based off how large of development team they hire and what deadlines are set.

Same rule applies in every industry: good, fast or cheap. Choose any two.

Plus Bethesda deletes and locks a lot more shit than on here. I don't know why anyone would ever want to post on some publisher/developers native forums for that exact reason.

&gt; This sub has repeatedly posted stats showing how small of a fraction of players have killed a SBQ, or even have hit level 50... 
---
I have not seem them. Can a brotha get a link? Not mad, just curious.
---
And, on a counterpoint, people on this sub currently couldn't care less about one specific thing like TSE's or SBQ, it's the general attitude and incompetence that has been shown by Bethesda. How do you "accidentally" roll back a patch? That has nothing to do with how much I play this game, it has to do with how much they work on it. 
---
I understand your sentiment but their behavior isn't for the "long term" or to please the broad 50% cause those people also had bobby pins weighing 0.1 lbs yesterday. Casual, try-hard, doesn't matter, the game is still broken and they just took a pretty decent step backwards. "Casual" gamers are just, by definition, too casual to complain about it. Hell, you could even say that the try hard's are doing them a favor by reporting all the end-game issues before the casuals get to that point. It would be a stretch, but you could say it.
---
When everything is nerfed  
---
nothing will be.
---
That was patched apparently. 
---
No one cares
---
As most guns should be. If you can one hit with a sledge hammer you should definitely be able to one shot with a legendary two shot anything .45 and up. I mean your really telling me a two shot .50 caliber takes twice as long to kill an enemy than any level 50 melee weapon does. That‚Äôs crazy... 
---
Eh I always try my best to play Devil‚Äôs Advocate. 
---
That's for your grippers to figure out.  Not mine because I don't have the problem with it.  But the amount of subscribers compared to the amount of daily players makes the complaints trivial here.  
---
Is Reddit the right platform?  Could be but gotta rally the troops in first.
---
Best of luck.
---
"It appears that a merge of internal development builds failed to execute properly prior to releasing Patch 5." is not the same as saying that they accidentally merged the current build with an old buggy build.  The fact that this was possible means that they have a fundamental problem with their development system that they weren't aware of: "The team is working to identify how this happened"
---
Please link previous posts on my topic if you assert that this is old news. I disagree.
---
No buff, just back to how it was before patch 5. It was working great for me.  
---
Will do some more testing tomorrow, but a quick test after today's hotfix seemed to indicate it was back to normal.
---
Could we get a Mjolnir effect? You know, so I can throw my super sledge at stuff cuz... why not? 
---
They mentioned in today's In the Vault they're looking into further game balance, specifically in cases just like the fat man and other vanilla weapons with explosive effects. Give it some time.
---
It's basically a green flamer. 
---
I know about the nurf but still TSE is better than a default level 50 Sniper Rifle with 130 damage (my main weapon, cuz I'm a "stealth sniper build" or I used to be before I realised how OP is the mele in this game. No I don't want to shadow everything like 10-15 shots to a scorched beast, not 100+. And yes the drops are awful.
---
Oh, for fuck's sakes. So, the patch to fix the patch needs to be patched?
---
If you're on Xbox1 add me. same GT as my reddit. I'm typically never on during the day, (I work a lot, finishing up school, and log in after my kiddos are in bed) but I always do a sell run in the evenings so that's pretty consistent
---
And here we go again... a classic reaction which i saw numerous times! Newsflash: you missed the point. I loved this game too, even in that state in which I bought it. Lvl 150 on my main, 62 on my second character now. But who in gods name can still pretend to like this? This is just sad, bc it represents the gaming industry these days. We all have such low expectations nowadays it‚Äôs simply amazing. But it‚Äôs 3 1/2 month!!! And the game gets worse with every patch. I defended them in the beginning, indeed had ‚Äûa BLAST!‚Äú, but this isn‚Äôt acceptable anymore. They should take the whole thing offline for good and fix the main issues. 
---
Amen!
---
If you don't like it, make a post to throw on top of the hundreds already existing about the same problem. You asked a question and got the answer
---
If your over lvl 50 and using 100 plus bullets to kill a scorch beast then your build needs some serious work man
---
Yes nerf everything so we can‚Äôt do anything.... then they will see....so nerf melee now
---
Alright go get me my free Last of Us remaster copy please.  Skyrim is two years older so by that logic I should expect it on my PSN account tonight, right?
---
Nope, mine is working fine
---
So an exploit 
---
Yup. Just had a melee guy drop into a full sprint and one-shot two of the three legendaries before I could get a clear line of fire for a single shot due to the hallways and such. Even if you don't PVP, one-shotting is an issue if event loot is going to work like this. It's not worth going to events if you "win", but don't get any legendary wood armor out of it.

The only things that are particular to her are Ultracite Mod plans and the rad shower. She may also be the only thing that drops serum plans?

How is that even possible? Are level 5 TSE shotguns possible to spawn? And how would he boost damage without all the perks, and with bobbleheads and magazines no longer stackable?
---
Are you *sure* that number 7 was the player level, and not the caps bounty being displayed?
---
MELEE FTW
---
It depends on what level of mobs you load into.   Also your loading time is affected by your hardware time.  If you have a slow-mo hard drive you'll spend a lot more time loading than if you have a screaming fast SSD.   I have a screaming fast SSD (like it tops out at 3000 MB/sec) and I still have a good 5 to 20 seconds of taking damage.   20 seconds of radiation in a nuke zone is lethal.  
---
Implying someone is greedy for not giving out \*enough\* free stuff is some choosing beggarish shit.

You don't think that almost 4k Upvotes is "rallying the troops"?

Then in the old Bethesda saying, "get the fuck out of this thread!"

To get rid of bounty you ask Thanos to snap his fingers.

it does yes, but again customers don't care. If you work too many hours change jobs or speak to boss.

Don't expect the customer that wants to buy xyz to care, they work just as hard if not harder in there own professions
---
With explosives it turns into an automatic explosive shotgun 
---
yeah I'm not sure either. I've read reports about it, but testing my AAE MG42 against the Whitesprings Assaultrons, it does seem to deal a lot more damage than a regular one.
---
Some weapons still do a lot of dmg. The dragon for instance. It will never change until they cap the amount of dmg players can do to each other per shot.  
---
You and me both. I feel your sadness. Everything about 76 has been a disappointment. If only...
---
I‚Äôll cut you up with a board mate. Melee is really that powerful.
---
It has to be! Bc it‚Äôs indeed like a Stone Age simulator now, running around with your axe...

My biggest hit is my one star TS Gauss Rifle.  Not explosive, but a good roll for an efficient weapon.  Now it's barely worth rebuilding a rifle build around it.
---
Same with fallout 4 it just fucks you over I got spawn camped by 4 glowing ones once
---
Did you not read the part of my post (or the point of the whole thing) where I said only Whitesprings should have legendaries lowered and _everywhere else_ should have ledge drops *raised*? 
---
Any potential change also doesn't have to be done immediately either. But you can't disagree that Whitesprings is unbalanced. But we'll just farm the golf club 5 hours a day forever, that's a good plan for the future. Forget ideas about the rest of the map being a viable alternative

The reason every goes there for legendaries is because Bethesda made it harder to get them naturally. They decreased the chances pf getting it even if you killed a legendary so if you want to get one, you gotta go there. Otherwise you are screwed. Doesn‚Äôt help that they made even more of legendary effects worthless. 
---
I've worked in both game industry QA and tech industry QE field and there is a VAST difference in how QA/QE is seen. On the game side, QA is there to just regression test and make sure systems are working as designed by the designers. All bug priorities are a "suggestion" and creative suggestion for content is "heard" but brushed aside and the Producers/Lead Designers make the call on everything. When something breaks, it's quick and easy to blame QA that something wasn't found, only to have the finger pointed back saying "we found it, you said don't worry about it." Lot of blame, not a lot of fixing the problem. QE side, QE works with Product Managers on on assessments and priority, and generally have much more say with developers in what is/isn't working and what needs to be fixed vs fixed in an incremental. If something is missed or a problem is discovered, the problem gets fixed, no one gets blamed. And yes, we do get to say when something can/cannot be released. It's a much better life.  
---
QA in game industry = high school/frat party  
---
QE in the tech industry = responsible adult
---
If you haven't played 3 or NV, I'd recommend those too. Currently replaying NV then I plan to do a survival mode FO 4 replay. Then hopefully 76 will be at a place I feel comfortable playing it
---
I do not believe the mod plans for ultra ire PA are available at taggetys terminal (haven‚Äôt logged in to check) but if you delete you ultracite PA you should not have to kill the queen to roll the dice and try to learn the plans for the main armor. That should not be endgame content. 
---
It's very possible that this was because of the camp duplication glitch with one of the previous Bethesda patches. It's not purposeful duping. 
---
The glitch stored tons of duplicated items. I ended up with something like 800 tatos and corn. You could place all of those items without them being added to camp budget. They probably just took full advantage of the glitch when it was active. 
---
Awful is puting it nicely, i just kill them to get some piece and quiet i don't even check their loot.
---
Yep with this last patch my sneak sniper got ruined. From 1500 damage to less then 500 and gets nearly 1 shot by anything not a basic scorch, such as death claws, mirelurk queens, etc.
---
Well shit, I must not have seen that top comment at first.... thank you for shedding light! Might have to look a little tonight.. see if there‚Äôs any good weight saving area.. I already have a few ideas of junk I never touch for anything I use.. like fuckin bone shards... Thank you though! I never saw that one before.. and when I just looked it up I didn‚Äôt even bother reading the comments, wasn‚Äôt thinking of that...
---
I knew about this for a while, but there wasn‚Äôt really much of an explanation ingame was there? Game could definitely benefit from a few more tutorials
---
Casuals? You mean people who want everything handed to them, and want everything to be overly easy? I'm a casual player and I'm super glad they finally nerfed TSE, it's taken them way too long. 
---
I guess I should have added /pedant to my post. I was teasing about it's versus its.
---
To sell. For money. I cracked the code for ya dude.
---
Um. Actualy. My TSE pump did 2048 damage with maxed receiver, perks, and a max stack in adrenilin. 
---
I‚Äôm serverhoping now trying to find a nuke so I can get covolt flux
---
Open testing starts tomorrow
---
I'd like to understand how "Casuals" even obtain TSE. The post is ridiculous.
---
Very fair point
---
So they were supposed to be rare drops but then using glitches people found a way to duplicate them and they flooded the game with them.  You either get extremely lucky or get it from another player where it's likely a dupe.  I guess you might currently find some stashed in random containers as people try to get their weight below 1500.
---
Have you read your edit alot about circle jerk why they left fallout reddit soon so forth.. It was definitely bitching about the game this reddit and the filthy reddit. I was pointing out a pointless bitch session. I was not inherently calling you immature and left it impersonal....but believe I don't have to. Then I even agreed with you on some points and you turned on me like I'm the bad guy.  Also if you don't like the game,probably came over just to troll this sub, and generally like to be negative what is keeping you here.  I mean I see you are a moderator so you understand why people should remain civil.  Or am I reading your history incorrectly. 
---
Very nice wi
---
Very nice work...
---
Tested, beer bottles and mods were not scrapped when in inventory. Neither was hardened mass, but digested goo was.(that's how it's worked so far)
---
Because of past bugs that caused blueprints to duplicate and go above camp limits, this could be done without cheating. Supposedly it has been fixed, but when you moved your camp, there was a chance that all items would double in storage, so your 4 turrets would become 8 when you unpacked your camp. You couldn't add anything  (including wires), but if you built your camp in a way that was self contained, you could use the bug to do the above.
---
The game broke for me before they fixed respawning. You could be wearing Excavator to increase your carry capacity but by dying the game wouldn‚Äôt account for it and considered you over encumbered and if that happened you couldn‚Äôt respawn, PERIOD. If you were lucky you could respawn at 76 but the first nuke I had ever seen was not the case for this. Got 5 minutes of it just to realize the enemies were extremely spongy but dropped basic loot. I was higher than your level and it took FOREVER to kill a single enemy. Things have gotten somewhat better but I can assure you people aren‚Äôt complaining for the hell of it. Bethesda‚Äôs been given the benefit of the doubt for previous games when the story was good but this game released with issues that they had for 4 years. The FPS speed issue has existed even in fallout 3 over a decade ago and it took 2 weeks to fix. That should help show you where and how they prioritize issues
---
Same... So disappointed I got the game before that happened and they wouldn't  give the sale to me.
---
I agree with you, and I totally think that the main reason for not acknowledging (sorry if mispelled, not english native) is the game being multiplayer.
---
Everytime a game has mor than 1 human player on it at the same time, some people INSTANTLY start to compare their stuff, instead of enjoying said stuff.
---
Happens 100% of the time.
---
Meh I had a long retort but is it honestly worth it. This was all started cause you were bitching.
---

the "pick flowers" challenge this week is not working, nor did the pick flowers challenge work last week.  The take photos at red rocket challenge this week is not working for me either.  The kill cryptids challenge this week seemed to work prior to the patch and patch fix, in that I killed a mirelurk with a Tesla shotgun and it register as 1/5 but I have since killed at least a dozen with the exact same gun and I'm still at 1/5.  Basically 3 out of the 5 weekly challenges this week are buggy/broken.  Seriously, if Bethesda can't be bothered to fix the challenges or at least take them out of the rotation, then just automatically credit us the atoms.  
---
A TSE with perks can get 300 still, not melee level, but one shot territory non the less....
---
Its not our fault that Bethesda couldn‚Äôt be bothered to actually fix the real problem of dupers and instead decided to punish everyone. 
---
Instead of Nerfing everything. They should have buffed other weapons to encourage other forms of play. Now its either melee or your fucked. 
---
I have almost 9k hours on ESO. It really is based on the game. I have one game that I have like 14 minutes on. Some just don‚Äôt click with you, some do, and some are kinda in the middle. That‚Äôs how you get those 150 hour games.
---
It's sad, but it looks like Fallout 76 is headed down the same road as Shadowbane with the griefer friendly thing.  Camp destroying, overpowering weapons and perks to the point that even the reduced damage doesn't stop griefers from murdering, and etc.  This policy of quote, "Turning Aholes into content", isn't flying.  On the day when Ultima Online lost its monopoly to its first competitor, the option to force PvP died.  You can't stop people from leaving and taking their money to other games.  Keep this up and what happened to Shadowbane will happen to Fallout 76.  The griefers were the only people playing, whining that all the sheep were gone.  There wasn't enough of them to cover the cost of keeping the servers going.  The game revenues stayed underwater until the business people stepped in and pulled the plug.  These games and their servers are a "for profit" venture....
---
My opinion is: the devs will read this whole post and they will do one thing: they will nerf the whitespring. Reason ? It will make it balanced with the other regions.  
---
If you believe the stats from the accomplishments for ps4 and Xbox, this sub represents somewhere from 5 to 10 percent of the player base that made it past level 25.
---
That isn't a majority, however that is a large enough some size to get effective feedback.
---
Also this sub has more members than those in game who have killed 20 players on ps4 and Xbox.
---
Except if they sold it they wouldn‚Äôt be fired up about not being able to craft with it for 1 day
---
Just gonna leave the sub, tired of people telling everyone else how they should feel every day... this is just beating a dead horse at this point. If someone isn't angry and is somewhat enjoying their experience then they should be able to do that without getting this shoved down their throat everyday... talk about gate-keeping. This whole argument boils down to "You're not as angry about this as I am so you're wrong and need to get angrier".
---
Primary rewards?
---
‚ÄúDisconnected from Server‚Äù as she dies. Or as the nuke launches. Her primary reward, singular, is regret.
---
In my experience, CCleaner is pretty useful but I wouldn't touch the registry with it unless I was one thousand percent sure. 
---
Except Browns fans don't watch just in case they win‚Äìthey watch just in case they don't get beaten as horribly as usual.
---
That‚Äôs it? 500? Petty heroes trying to play with the big boys. Don‚Äôt make me laugh, HAHAHAHAHAHABA *cough* *cough* fuck.
---
I think you missed most of why people were complaining. The TSE nerf isn't the primary reason. Sure, some people were bummed about that, but nobody thought that TSEs were balanced.
---
The problem was everything else they managed to bungle in the process:
---
* Reintroducing numerous old bugs because they used an older version of the game as a base (seriously, this is rookie mistake)
---
* Adding new bugs in their "patch"
---
* Completely borking over explosive builds in an effort to nerf TSEs. Rule number one of balance is you target the thing you're specifically trying to nerf.
---
* Making the game even more grindy than it was before, which was rather grindy, by "balancing" traits such as White Knight which nobody was complaining about. Similar to their "fix" for Feed the People.
---
   * They fix the "bugs" that people like, but don't fix the bugs people complain about such as incessant Scorchbeast spam.
---
* Jacking up prices on existing plans to add to the grind, but not increasing vendor cap limits to compensate.
---
I think contrary. From what I understand the casual player doesnt like grind. They dont like their games being a chore. This patch added in more unnecessary grind which would appeal against the causal player. Also this sub may very well represent the majority of the player considering that the player for fo76 is not very large and this sub has well over 171k. Not everyone who posts and browses this sub is subscribed to it so you cant go off that number either.
---
From what I can tell they use an auto ban when someone is crafting "unnatural" amounts.  The stash space is 600 lbs so once you get above that I can see why the game flags it.  Because people have been dumping everything onto mule accounts and the recent patch now prevents characters from being over-encumbered by 1500 (I think, not 100% on that).  People are clearing the alts by mass crafting with the materials they been storing which then gets flagged as "unnatural".  If people just followed the progression of the game (instead of trying to circumvent it with a mule) their stash space would fill up then they would either sell the excess scrap or craft/scrap to learn mods in intervals instead of massive quantities.  It would be a nonissue.
---
Bethesda has not specifically addressed mules, but have now indirectly addressed it by capping carry weight with the patch.  But yes using a mule is an exploit.  Muling bypasses the intended game mechanic of storage space by (previously) allowing people to bank everything infinitely.  That is the definition of an exploit, regardless of whether it's enforced in this or any other game.
---
If not being able to carry or keep everything you find is that offensive to you then this game is just not your cup of tea, and that's fine. Inventory management is a core part of the game.  You have to choose what weapons/armor to keep and you can't infinitely bank consumables.  That's part of the game.  Not to mention we all have to share a server so if you have 20,000 items that all need to be instanced on command it affects everybody.
---
Yup noticed it too 
---
I‚Äôve got hundreds of games to play, but the only thing that keeps me turning on my PS4 is Fo76. Cant exactly explain why, I‚Äôm aware of all the issues but they don‚Äôt effect my actual gameplay. Been building lots of different camps and making videos like [this one](https://youtu.be/RA5RGR_vYnI). But unfortunately the best thing to do in this climate is stay silent. 
---
Bethesda is a game publishing unit which has an estimated net worth of $3 billion?  What is on display in the criticism of F76 is indignation, and righteously so. Offer me a refund, and I will go and read a book, or something. Try to sell me another game in the future,.. maybe THEN Bethesda will realise how this failed game has affected their net worth. Fool me once...
---
&gt;but the game seems totally fine to me.
---
Get a mutation, contract Rad Worms and then go and hit Scrap All on a workbench with some bulk in your inventory. That should sort this misunderstanding out.
---
In 15 years of being a programmer i've never heard it used in this way (except maybe by bethesda).   
---
Unequips White Knite Perk: i hear ya bro.
---
This reminds me of the Destiny community.
---
There is also the achievement bug that you didn‚Äôt awarded at level 50.  I‚Äôm sure this influences the stats.
---
The problem is that it was ‚ÄúThe End Game‚Äù
---
When you remove ‚Äúthe end game‚Äù you have to replace it with something, and they didn‚Äôt. 
---
Not only that, now it is nearly impossible to kill the SCQ because Bethesda didn‚Äôt scale it tp compensate for that fact. Now even if you have 10 people working together, you won‚Äôt be able to kill it. 
---
You'll have to wait for Patch 6 to fix the carry weight bugs introduced by Patch 5.  The hotfix didn't address any carry weight bugs.
---
It‚Äôs most likely the radworms 1.5x multiplier to all added non base stats, like carry weight for your power armor adds 100 but on radworms it adds 150. Check that out maybe.
---
That‚Äôs just how life is dude. I preordered the game, so I am in the same boat. I try not to think about it or dwell on it
---
Only TSE I've found is a gatling laser, before the nerf it was more dangerous to me than any enemy in the wastland. I still feel lucky to have it, because since i heard about this game i wanted to be a badass BoS type character. I think your suggestion could be a great way making energy weapons viable (along with increased durability), without making them op.  
---
^(or you can do what most do.. have multiple weapons and armor set up for different situations playing to your strengths!!)
---
Lemme guess, hunter longcoat or Leather longcoat ? I have them and due to how rare they are ( especially the leather one) i don't want to use anything hiding them. 
---
Are you on PS4? If so, yes, you need twice the size of the total game install for any updates. 
---
"Maybe they shouldn't have tried to do the thing they have no experience doing"
---
Yes because that's how the world works. You have to try new things to improve. You can't GET experience doing something without DOING the thing you have no experience with.
---
I'm not so troubled by the term, I know what they mean. I am somewhat troubled by your presentation of an unsourced definition. Where did this come from? Is it a source with authority in the field of technology, or perhaps language?
---
Sorry if this seems a bit harsh, but Question Time is on the telly and it's winding me up. It does put me in the mindset of questioning people's information and motives though.
---
"now that TSE weapons are nerfed, I feel melee is the only suitable option."
---
Is different than
---
"Bethesda no longer cares about this game and ruined it. My TSE weapon went from 800 damage to 200 which is bullshit. How do I kill anything?????!!!!!??"
---
On a side note: the amount of people who claim a 200 damage weapon "can't kill anything" is wrong and obnoxious. You can't *one shot* anything maybe, but 200 is more than doable
---
If you *don't* enjoy this game stop playing it. To me it's all been one giant immature circle jerk. If you're used to playing god in Bethesda games fine, but you have to realize that a vast majority of the community have been and continue to be fine with the game. Get the fuck over it and stop playing, if you actually want to send a message thats your best option. 
---
https://youtu.be/wnoBiYzqTck

Playing, enjoying and talking about it on youtube, lol. 
---
That‚Äôs what they are gonna end up doing at this rate. They Should of just left well enough alone
---
Shoutout to the vocal minority, that actually expresses their unhappiness and gets the company to fix shit that should have been fixed before launch. 
---
there‚Äôs 2 things happening. Usually it‚Äôs the legal pvp. Sometimes it‚Äôs someone doing a million damage by cheating.
---
Either way... just be a lad and tell every noob you meet that you won‚Äôt die if you don‚Äôt fire back, and dying doesn‚Äôt matter. Then, they‚Äôll be a little more prepared for brutality.
---
&gt; the Fallout fan base is no exception to that
---
Bethesda fans in general are usually an amplified version of that.
---
There‚Äôs only 24 people per server if you wish to pay it off split it evenly between everyone on the server. I‚Äôd be cool with any bounty being paid off at that point. A free random 100 caps nice! 
---
I'll take "whinny crap that made me leave r/fallout in the first place" for $500, Alex.
---
A buddy and I were discussing something like that a while ago about turning the plethora of unused perk cards into extra perk points. Taking like ten+ unused perk cards and giving an extra perk point. It would help to cut out cards we don't use and also cut back on having to constantly switch out perk cards.
---
Purchased fusion generator plans from whitesprings bunker and they never transferred to my inventory. It was gone from the vendor however. Modius in the production location.

You can still kill it with melee. Only after they nerf melee Bethesda will realise SBQ became unkillable.
---
Counterstrike!
---
Not viable, your looking at it from your own point of view but you need to open those mind receptors. I run a no power armor build. It‚Äôs already hard for nuke zones for me. Any more and I‚Äôm basically useless. I would have to respec into PA for just that one thing.
---
Really worried about Elder Scrolls
---
This illustrates the fevered logic of a person who legitimately equates his gripes with fallout 76 to free speech. Ffs dude you're taking this a bit too seriously wow 
---
But they are facing a credibility and customer crisis
---
I'd honestly be fine with it if they allowed for extensive upgrading of structures and defenses like Ark. With sufficient effort, you can turn your Ark base into a multi-hour raid encounter for persistent enemies. In Fallout 76 your base is about as brittle as a pack of level 1 ghouls. If someone really wants to destroy it, there is nothing that you can do to stop them other than passive things like moving your base or leaving the server.
---
Do you have evidence to the contrary? Were the interviews done with Obsidian's team post NV launch just a hoax orchestrated by vaultec?
---
I didn't believe it at first, but after reading about all the stupid shit that went on (the hard word limit for voiced characters, leading to ED-E, game and dlc deadlines) i took on a much different view of Bethesda than i previously held.
---
But if you have proof that a bunch of people just lied years ago about something they had no reason to lie about, then id love to see it.  But the evidence we have supports it. *Bethesda* even said they gave Obsidian a very short deadline to get the game done by, and (im less sure about this part) by missing it (by a little bit i think) there were financial penalties.
---
So how is it a myth, exactly?
---
My whole build revolves around sneaking headshots. Level 55,  3 points in sneak, escape artist ect ect. I could hardly farm whitesprings last night. I'm pretty bummed right now as my character is broken as he does no real damage outside of sneak shots. 
---
ITT: Unhelpful sarcasm and salt
---
These break ip posts are so F‚Äôn cringy
---
Yeah. I've only witnessed it once. I was at the golf club and a team invited me a few times until I accepted, then had me move back with the others. One of them relogged and all the glowing ghouls respawned. I wondered if having players there not on their team interfered with the respawn, and that's why they invited me, but I don't know. And the server did crash a few minutes later.
---
I think they had done it several times before on that server without a crash, because the ice chest had about a hundred 1-star legendaries in it.
---
The game is getting balance and getting rid of dupers, yay! Still enjoying it. 
---
If Bethesda weren't making such amateur mistakes then there would be less people pitching in.
---
"Sorry everyone there was an unknown dependency between module X and module Y which caused Z unexpected behaviour"

vs.

"Oopsie woopsie we released the wrong (untested) version"
---
Use a computer is one thing, what graphics card are you using? Latest update for that card? Does the update mention fallout 76? Is there an alpha update? What direct x are you using? Have you tried different compatibility modes? What os? Have you setup your qos on your router to make your computer or fallout 76 specifically for highest priority? There's probably 100 other things you could do.
---
Funny enough, the guy I know who's had the best experience since day 1 is playing on a Mac, running barebones windows with nothing else. But he also knows his shit, not just how to "use" a computer.
---
I still see people camping out there like that with turrets. Is there anything to it besides griefing at this point? 
---
Im not complaining as much as pointing out the obvious. They over nerfed guns by a long shot. I really hope. They ‚Äúbalance‚Äù everything better. Including melee. You can‚Äôt just kick every dog in the room but one 
---
*shrug* sucks to be them i guess? Complaining about the most abundant resource in the game seems odd to me in any context, you can get it everywhere effortlesssly
---
You werent asking that though you were asking why bulk at all :p
---
Isn‚Äôt there a bug for this? I have 100 hours into the game (yes, minority) but xbox hasn‚Äôt given me the reclamation day achievement. I thought this was supposed to get fixed. 
---
Edit: spelling
---
It's pretty obvious. They've been nerfing supposed bugs that were being used to grind xp and legendary weapons too. It's not something new, it's a clear continued effort to slow down gameplay to a crawl, and it was already tedious at launch. Honestly it's like they don't even want their game to be successful anymore. 
---
Yeah this sub has too many people that just want to yell, but not offer solutions. 
---
The bobby pin bug isn't terrible so repeating that the bug is back with multiple threads is ridiculous. Just let it be known and it will be fixed. Yes I understand that bugs shouldn't reappear, but it happens. 
---
There should have been more testing before this patch went live. So my frustration is with the people who greenlighted this patch.
---
I totally agree with your perspective, and I wish more people shared this view. 
---
I would prefer not to crash and to not have to deal with little bugs than have new content. 
---
I really really enjoy the world bethesda has created. I've had a lot of fun. I just want it to work is all. 
---
I gotchu
---
I dont see liversss though
---
My PSN: DJ_Dribbles
---
&gt; Of course they aren't going to get it right every single time, but what game ever has?
---
Name a single time they have got it right.
---
Is that even possible? 
---
They also just need to employ proper quality control and test the builds before pushing them out, every mistake they have made so far is due to a failure of process.  Coding mistakes will happen, but their inability to catch these mistakes and prevent them from being forward facing to the public is an example of how poorly managed this studio is.  This is basic quality control stuff.
---
Ha I heard after 50 hours it's unplayable ..I need Xbox anyway
---
&gt; you and this sub ARE NOT THE VAST MAJORITY OF FO76 players.
---
This is a good argument to make in many settings, such as when thinking about how successful Fallout 4 was (sure, some fans online were disappointed, but the game sold exceptionally well, suggesting the opinion of r/fallout was not representative).
---
I'm not sure if this is the right way to be thinking about Fallout 76. We lack really solid data on this, but I find it reasonable to believe that the people actively discussing Fallout 76 represent a small fraction on the total number of people that purchased a copy. But is "1 purchase = 1 vote" the best way to think about engagement? What about total playtime, for instance? People talking about the game online probably represent a much higher fraction of total play time, particularly going forward (i.e. if most of the casual gamers have moved on at this point then it makes sense to focus more on the more vocal parts of the community).
---
Of course, ultimately Bethesda is only allowed to do all of this so that they can make money - and since the game has microtransactions in place, the people that Bethesda really cares about (or at least the people that their owner really cares about) are the people that spend actual money on microtransactions - so there is a strong temptation to ignore *both* casual players and the more vocal ones in preference of those that actually pay money for stuff.
---
&gt; EDIT: Just googled this, Fallout 4 came out Nov 10th, 2015. First DLC was March 2016 (Automatron) the first REAL game expansion, Far Harbor, was in May. FO76 is in no way behind schedule for content update compared to the previous game. 
---
And again we run into the fundamental issue that we, and Bethesda, have been grappling with since this game was conceived of. Is Fallout 4 the right benchmark? Yes, it was their previous game, so it's a natural point of comparison. But it also wasn't an online game that intended on funding servers and future development at least in part by microtransactions. Destiny 2, for instance, launched in September 2017 and got its first major expansion in December 2017. Heck, even the Bethesda devs talked about how important it is for "live" games to get fresh content out quickly (https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs?t=1859).
---
Honestly, I don't have the faintest idea of what will constitute "late" for new content for this game.
---
I had a "sleeping" ghoul actually get up, then walk off. Right through the wall... It was untargetable too
---
Why would you do that? I kept mine at 60% already so I just have to add another point to it. I‚Äôm sure aqua boy perk won‚Äôt be missed.
---
When the advertised (publicly many places) it would be a strike system involving character wipes long long before then
---
Jesus Christ be praised it's Henry
---
You don‚Äôt need any materials to apply a mod. It will say you do but just click it and it will apply. 
---
Yeah PS4! Thanks
---
I mean, wouldn‚Äôt it be unfair if you could survive a nuke zone without PA? The whole point is that you are a literal walking tank, wearing an airtight nuclear power mech suit.  You should have to wear as much protection as possible to enter a nuke zone I believe. 
---
I know this is a video game but it wouldn‚Äôt be realistic in Fallout sense if anybody could go in and survive. Either wear PA and respec or a hazmat suit and suffer from 0DR, it wouldn‚Äôt be fun if everybody can do everything without sacrificing. 
---
Not even remotely accurate
---
Yeah I agree. You can‚Äôt take the damage away from every weapon in the game deeming then completely useless and not touch melee at all making them 60 times more powerful than your top tier legendary two shot 
---
Already did with the hotfix today.  The place is a shit show right now...
---
Oops! Liverrsss
---
I agree. But that‚Äôs not much a choice is it, in game where it prided itself claiming that all of your choices mattered. Bethesda could have easily avoided this if they buffed other weapons or perk cards to encourage other ways to play. Now it has become broken 
---
yes, I myself find it complete bullshit that you had to repay for a copy of the last of us with barely any improvements a year later, feelsbadsman.
---
Someone claimed 760 hours of gameplay?! Wtf. 
---
I‚Äôll give it a shot and report back in a moment 
---
Holding onto gear with the intent to use it is different than holding on to gear to act as a bank, it doesn't matter who you are holding it for.  If that character is just extra bank space, then that is exploiting.  Your rl analogy is off a bit, it would be more like your house is only permitted to have 4 occupants but you are housing 6, isn't that breaking the law?  Who the mule is holding the stuff for is irrelevant, the fact that its sole purpose is to bypass the stash limit is what matters and that is what makes it cheating.
---
I'm pretty sure a hotfix is any sort of fast update to fix some problems, regardless of taking down the servers or not.
---
On top of that I'm not sure Bethesda could makes those types of changes while the servers are live.
---
This post is the definition of entitlement if you look it up in the dictionary. 
---
Yeah, shoutout to the silent majority. Who up until last week were actually the loud majority. But now that they all hate the game the majority **must** now be silent because the majority **must** be enjoying the game.
---
Chargeback are often buyer sided as is the intention and purpose of their existence, but in this case Bethesda never responded to me on customer service or the chargeback at all
---
I'm with you. Fuck this sub and its whineyness. I dont care who quits and stays I'm sick of the spam and temper tantrums. 
---
You're lying to me right now. I've missed both shots of TS fairly often with 95% accuracy in vats at medium-close range let alone sniping. You are super full of shit. Also maybe try that again, what the fuck are you saying ADS on your handmade semester? lol
---
All in all, I doubt I‚Äôll be coming back but I do feel like I got my money‚Äôs worth. 30 dollars for roughly 100 hrs
---
Break ip or break up?  You're cringy for the shitty spelling alone.  Stop defending bethesda because its out of your goodwill and love 
---
You're right, i was thinking two shot even though i was reading explosive.
---
Yes. I feel like this is the only human thing I've read on the subreddit all day 
---
Bethesda has been like this for years, it‚Äôs just now with a crack in Bethesda that people can see what Bethesda really is.
---
Well it happened sooner then I thought. Yeah at some point people will start to realize that and consider it before posting. It already happened a couple of times...
---
Yeah that‚Äôs terrible compared to where the tse should be. They guns for god shake. I mean for real. Not to mention the most iconic weapon in the game being the fat man. Even with perks does practically nothing compared to your top tier melee weapons and it shots nukes. I mean the logic behind the changes they made are there but it‚Äôs been blown out of the water
---
&gt;My problem with a lot of people in the community is that no multiplayer game is ‚Äòperfect‚Äô and for me no online game has to be perfect so stop getting mad at this game.
---
Have you considered that there is a vast range of quality between 'perfect' and 'shit'? If someone served you up a literal plate of shit in a restaurant and said 'Hey, no food is perfect' would you accept that?
---
&gt;It is Bethesda‚Äôs first time ever making a multiplayer game so just stop with all the hate
---
And if you went into a restaurant, paid top dollar for a meal and then they brought out a happy meal and said 'Hey our chef has only been here one day and he used to be a plumber' would you accept that?
---
If the answer is yes then by all means tell people to stop hating.
---
I feel your pain but this is dumb reasoning on your part when it comes to the job. If you don‚Äôt get hired and climb the ladder then nothing‚Äôs gonna change. If you want to make change, get promoted and become a boss until you can start making change. That‚Äôs what I was taught.
---
Why would they drop the plastic when most likely they intend to sell it?
---
4k upvotes compared to the tens of thousands playing is my point to the big picture 
---
Accusng me of stupidity rather than taking the time to realize 4k of you upset compared to the thousands of active users on the servers that marginalize the 4k you speak of suggests you are on the wrong platform.
---
Unfortunately you're failure to identify that this is a way to "hurt Bethesda" or "giving to the man" is just wasted time.  Again,. Boycotting on a large scale sends a message.  
---
Anyways. Like I said.  Best of luck.
---
Ps- your argument based on the spent on a subreddit is poor in context.  Don't like my opinion move along. Not hard. :-)
---
For real, this game is great. Best Fallout game I ever played. 
---
Don't feel bad, just be wary of any future Zenimax or Bethesda releases in the future. In reality their no different than EA or any other developer.
---
I uninstalled the game a few days ago.
---
I love Fallout series; I revere Bethesda as one of the best game developing companies out there.  I was prepared to stick it out with Fallout 76 and see the changes come through.
---
But the truth of the matter is, the game should have been released with more polish.  We shouldn‚Äôt have to buy a game for $40-60 upon release that barely would have qualified as an Beta.  I don‚Äôt have much respect for Bethesda right now.  I won‚Äôt have faith in them until they release their next game at a standard that the entire community can agree is at least okay.
---
Mine seems to be working as expected.  Rank 3.  Didn't notice anything wrong last night.
---
I got it, thank you though!! Turns out you don‚Äôt even need the flux 
---
Because they're not actually fixing the laundry list of stuff that's wrong with this game? I agree, yes, they are working on the game still and that's pretty cool. It's just that the work's bush league for a AAA title should have been, you know, *finished* before being released. 
---
Take energy weapons for example. Those are still useless, and have been since the beta. I'm sure glad it got 'addressed' in this blog post, but I've seen at least 3 other posts from /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ account reps since release stating 'we are aware of the issue and have passed it along' to be numb to an empty response like that.
---
From a Dev/QA standpoint, this makes no sense. How did ***nobody*** notice any of this before pushing it out to release? In regards to energy weapons; either QA is so continually horrible it's practically non-existent, or they flat out did not play an entire class of weapons before releasing the game.
---
Take [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aljowa/bethesda_the_mod_author_community_has_been_try_to/) and [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aj11j2/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_jan_2019/) for further examples. The work is practically done for them, yet the issues persist. 
---
There's no point in having /u/slenderf0x and /u/LoneVaultWanderer come through here and say 'Wow this is great we'll pass this along!' because the proof is in the pudding. The developers at  /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ have already shown how much input from a dedicated fanbase means to them. They have fixes laid out above, that have been known for some time, but are still absent. How long have we been asking for a known issues list? How about accurate patch notes? We **still** have people pulling change logs from the files themselves, as the patch notes still fail to detail the actual changes to the game.
---
Things that were broken at launch are **still** broken (power armor compass, social menu), being **re-broken** (PA weight bug) and rather than fix it bethesda is working on things like a survival mode nobody asked for. Should they fix the existing game, before adding another? Surely I'm not the only one who sees that makes no sense.
---
We're not cynical asshats. /u/BethesdaGameStudios_ /Zenimax is *continually* dropping the ball on a beloved game series. I've been playing Fallout since 2, and it just fucking sucks to see my favorite game series being ruined by Bethesda's bumbling and Zenimax's greed. This game could have been so so much more, but let's face it. It was shoved out the door to meet holiday 2018 release, when it should have stayed in the oven until spring/summer 2019. 
---
I've bought every Fallout game before this one, some multiple times. I can say with certainty this is the last Bethesda product I will ever buy
---
I try to sell those first, but I don't farm a whole lot. I buy some of the gear that people sell to traders.
---
Sometimes I'll buy some unknown plans and then sell more stuff, though I don't really need them.
---
Elder Scrolls Online comes to mind, lol. Geesh
---
They nerfed all explosives via nerfing the demolitions perk card. They also specifically nerfed explosive legendary effects.
---
Try exit and renter if it changes, then it‚Äôs a known bug.
---
You‚Äôre correct!! Thanks a ton! By any chance do you know if I could equip the jet pack + lets say core assembly? Or is one mod per individual piece of power armor
---
If a developer has a bowell movement *we need to know!*
---
I have the armour set, I was talking about the mods for it. Thanks anyway.
---
As someone else said in perhaps a harsher way, there are alternatives for uninstalling software. You don‚Äôt need to rely on Bethesda‚Äôs launcher to accomplish the task. 
---
Who knows, maybe by the time they unban you they will have fixed the glaring issues that have been plaguing this game from the start. One can dream, anyway.  
---
was reading this post during a load screen and loaded in to two scorched smashin on me, felt the need to upvote this
---
The game isn't unplayable or broken. It has issues but not unplayable. 
---
Because we are all entitled to complain about the shitty game we paid too much for?
---
what‚Äôs the sacrifice in wearing power armor? Having to get out to use a bench lol? 
---
I‚Äôd like to spec in lead lined and somehow work out a rad resist to add to that. Like the food that adds rad resist and maybe even rad x but go in without mutations or something. Why force me to play a build I didn‚Äôt put any perks into like at all.
---
Btw since I didn‚Äôt spec in building PA I still get rad damage while wearing it.
---
Hahahaha that was the most obnoxious glitch and I think I'm just going to take a break if that's the case. 
---
Erase this damn post Jesus enjoy it while it lasts
---
Agreed. I stopped playing weeks ago. What a POS game 
---
That's not an equal comparison. The game isn't nearly that broken. 
---
It's hard to say because the PVP system is so lacking. I'm only judging by taking bounties. I run a bloodied/unyielding build. I one shot most people on a bounty. Sometimes I get  quick one who tries to stim pack but I power through it and out swing their healing. Honestly, I think the Nerf removed any counter to my build.  
---
The worst part is that I've never made it to low health. I've been one shot before but in a fight, it's always near full health and I one or two shot them anyway. Now there is no counter my build... Melee will rule the world.
---
Since the 31th of jan update, there is no longer a search option for chem containers when using Pharma Farma. 
---
Also, the recon scope(on a hunting rifle) sometimes ‚Äústicks‚Äù after shooting when you ads. So even if you if release the ads button it still somehow looks down the sight. This was also the case prepatch. 
---
Im on a PS4 Pro
---
Rifle Gaming did a video on this... weeks ago. 
---
How much for the buzz blade plan, the shishkebab plan, the ripper plan and tesla rifle plan?
---
Yeah... going back to Skyrim or FO4 where my copious amount of mods will be the reason my game crashes.
---
Breaking any sort of controls they have over their support process wouldn't help anything. Idk if I'd call it a crisis either. People treating a video game as if it's the most important thing in their life and being **outraged** by anything bad the company does isn't representative of the playerbase. I'm not happy about some of the changes, [but whatever](https://youtu.be/xzpndHtdl9A), my life isn't negativity impacted by them and I still plan on playing while the Superbowl is on.
---
'dev. note: we have found that The Whitesprings resort is over performing so we have reduced the legendary spawn chance to 1/20th, adjusted the loot table of the glowing ghouls to match that of the bloodbugs and added a moderate chance to spawn an immortal molerat that follows you to your camp, eats your plants, shits on your bed then proceeds to cuddle up on your lap while you are playing the banjo demanding cuddles while it irradiates you, thus bringing it more in line with other locations'. 
---
There was a level 68 roaming around whisperings night before last constantly chattering like she didn't know people could hear it. I don't have a headset so i couldn't say anything and judge her reaction. It was just like how area chat used to be, but maybe she was holding down the push to talk button for some reason.
---
That stretch from CTRL to F can give you a nasty hand cramp. 
---
If I‚Äôm going to go sell bulked items to vendors, I sell it. Sometimes I buy bulk steel, especially now that I‚Äôm pretty well set on plans and don‚Äôt have much else to spend caps on. If I want to scrap bulks, I have to scrap everything, then go scrap them as well? 
---
I *like* hearing that they‚Äôll scrap with one button push now. 
---
Edit: I make and sell Marine Tactical Helmets instead of Bulks anyway, better caps for the plastic used. 
---
It seems to come from the definition Google presents when the term is searched. The Wikipedia article acknowledges that the original use of the term involves the systems being "hot" when the fix is applied, but that the definition used often by developers is that it is simply done quickly and outside of normal development.
---
In 2009 (original FAQ no longer on the current website) Blizzard Entertainment defined their use of hotfix as:
---
&gt;A hotfix is a change made to the game deemed critical enough that it cannot be held off until a regular content patch. Hotfixes require only a server-side change with no download and can be implemented with no downtime, or a short restart of the realms.
---
My take is that OP is correct on the original definition of hotfix, but language evolves and there is at minimum a decade of precedent for the definition Bethesda used.
---
Lol @ the people who blindly put their faith into this game and pre ordered.
---
What did the main dev say? Was it ‚ÄúWe just want to try something a little different.‚Äù?
---
Nobody wanted this game. 
---
Unsubscribe while you are at it.  I mean what's the point of being here otherwise?
---
The endless "I'm quitting" and other 'shitting all over' posts do get a bit redundant, but are needed: the complaints are valid and since the CM's are active here it gives them insight into what the more dedicated players (I say more dedicated because most casual players don't hang out on subreddits for every game they play) are feeling.  
---
Your "I'm unsubbing" post.... contributes to nothing.  
---
Don't let the vault door hit you on the way out.  
---
So instead of saying "you have reached for craft limit for x amount of time," they just ban you. I've given BGS so many benefits of the doubt but this is a true low point.
---
No prob! Mods are basically an ‚Äúall in one kit‚Äù, if you will. It‚Äôs one mod per piece of armor. 
---
Bye!
---
Lol, I think I‚Äôve read this before haven‚Äôt I ? 
---
You got your TSE taken away from you and now you are mad as hell.
---
God I'm loving this.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alko1s/crafted_a_few_gamma_guns_to_learn_mods_got_banned/
---
You can read it for yourself if you want
---
No, your base is yours and theirs is theirs. In a group they can build on your property, but only when grouped up.
---
Whoever drops the c.a.m.p. owns it and it will only be visible when they are logged in.
---
Definitely agree, it‚Äôs very annoying. 
---
I would like to see Bethesda defenders to come in here and tell us this is normal. This is not normal at all. 
---
Yep I feel ya . I think this is something new after the recent patch. Every time I travel to my camp it spawn some kinda enemy 
---
That will TOTALLY fix everything. /s
---
Also, if you arent using missile launcher, just drop the missiles, you will find a lot. You don‚Äôt need more stash space, you need to optimize.
---
Because they would have walls of text about bugs they know about and chose to ignore while releasing new outfits and skins for real money.
---
It's almost like grafting their ancient shitty engine onto an online game was a bad idea.
---
It's completely absurd they didn't build a proper database backend
---
I'm really active here so I'm not very silent but I'm having a blast especially after this patch.
---
There's moments where I'm challenged and drops are far more exciting knowing ts/e isn't the be all end all.
---
You‚Äôll be pulling your hair out when you get to end game content and go launch a nuke only to be booted from the server. 
---
Seriously?
---
With the way ammo and weight work it is more important to have higher dmg per shot than dps, low dmg automatics really aren‚Äôt viable, you burn through ammunition too fast for what you get in dmg
---
Another thing - likely useless to you... You must have your headset as the audio device prior to loading the game.  You cannot switch it after loading.  I do wish you luck on resolving this.
---
I agree completely. Don‚Äôt be the white knight for Bethesda. Realize they just nerfed your ass off. 
---
Well that's due to your dial-up internet. Took about 5 min for me to download.  
---
We don't care. Bye Felicia!
---
Hotfixesitself
---
I made 20 to 30 of the same gun every day for a week to learn all the plans for all the guns and never heard anything about it.
---
This took days to get done, so Im thinking room-temp-fix.
---
It‚Äôs a good system, give it a chance is all I‚Äôm saying. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but I don‚Äôt need to see numbers to know how shitty my TSE Minigun doing 37 dmg is. I can‚Äôt kill a super mutante without loading 150 bullets. 
---
Switch the ammo type off of .308, we need something more sustainable for a weapon that can drain 1000 rounds in 3 minutes
---
Same here. Some mention of the carry weight change would be nice, after all it did just kill all player run shops. 
---
Once you understand the game well enough, break the problems it presents down to smaller more tackleable problems and deal with them individually, yes it is. 
---
You're right. Except melee or get fucked. I do fine when I swap to crit pistols or sneak rifles.
---
Everything you said about Bethseda I couldn't agree more. I'm 100%with you.
---
But there are other specs as good or better then melee.
---
Do you want some build advice? I'll be more then happy to let you know what hat works for me. I had zero issue 1 shotting things before I went melee w my non legendary lever action. I'm only melee now because I got tired of ammo farming.
---
I'll happily let you know what build I used to 1 shot everything w a non legendary lever action. 
---
Im camped out in the mire and even before this patch I would get attacked as soon as I spawn in.
---
Nope they still have unique outfits and items
---
Lol offline mode doesnt mean bethesda would ever trust pc with the code.
---
Probably not. Your C.A.M.P. is your own. Your teammates can help you build it, but it is still yours, and when you log out it disappears until you log back in again. Also, there is a (smallish) limit on how much stuff you can put in your camp, and you can't can't combine camps with another person.
---
You‚Äôve just invented a new business model‚Äîskipping right over free-to-play and going right for the get-paid-to-play meta model.   I just hope all of the in-game advertising won‚Äôt be too distracting....
---
There are plenty of other places where you can enjoy the work instead of killing yourself over trying to change an incompetent culture.
---
So if you‚Äôre at full stash limit with everything bulked and you do a scrap all and unbulk all your items thereby increasing their weight....what happens?
---
FO76 is not an "another fallout game"
---
It is a sandbox survival game using the Fallout franchise.
---
Thanks for the info. 
---
I think that‚Äôs the point he‚Äôs trying to make. Even giving the upper 7% of the PS4 player base the benefit of the doubt in terms of how far along the subscribers here are, the people already at or past the end game are a very small minority
---
Believe mirror ball plans is Graham only?
---
It‚Äôs been happening since the beta for me
---
Down voted already? :o
---
Is there any chance they were just using a bare chassis?
---
I‚Äôm at level 58. I have experienced two inconvenient disconnects, and a few funny glitches, but nothing that prevents me from enjoying the game. 
---
I‚Äôd say the move of the folks whining on r/fo over to here has been the worst part. I‚Äôd just wish they‚Äôd leave this subreddit for constructive feedback.
---
They ‚Äúaddressed‚Äù the frustrations with bullshit justifications.
---
 Yeah that's the one. There is a silver one below as well. I have not bothered extracting as I can just pull 4 ore and make 20 lead all the time. Sitting on over 300 now. ;)
---
 Its a very sweet place. The neighbors have mostly been cool. ;)
---
Why though?
---
Pre nerf 5pts of demo+ tse gave 300% more damage.
---
9pts gives 60% but most do 3pts for 30%
---
How on earth does that come close to balance or even a decision to make when creating a build?
---
Nope dont think so, I just found him and nothing special
---
Runescape does a polling system. Although it‚Äôs a bit hectic at time, it still does the job in showing who wants what and who doesn‚Äôt.  
---
And with the abundance of Voting places in West Virginia you could set a place in game to vote on those updates.  
---
It's the constant "let's all take a minute to thank x!". It's literally everyday, for some reason they are a constant karma farm, if anyone points it out they are buried with down votes and deleted by mods.
