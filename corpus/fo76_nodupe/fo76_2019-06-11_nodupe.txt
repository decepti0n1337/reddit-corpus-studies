Can I play the game without PlayStation Plus? I own the disc
---
---
---
Survival mode is amazing. 
---
I don’t play adventure anymore. I love wandering around doing challenges/maps/exploring with the added challenge of watching out for hostile players!
---
I hope that’s it for modes, honestly. I’d like to see this be added into Adventure Mode. But maybe only make it available if you’ve completed “I am Become Death.”
---
It's just a stash box to craft at your camp
---
I have heard of this elusive creature. Is the quests still active or do I just have to find one in the wilds?
---
So I've not really followed this game since it launched. But I did see they've added some PvE stuff like vaults. What are those exactly? Are they group content?
---

---
If you're a PvE player what kinds of content and activities are there? I'm interested in giving this a shot for the free trial.
---
I am downloading the update now, but I'm the same when it comes to BR modes. I've been working all day but I've been reading and it seems like nearly everyone is freaking happy.
---
I'm glad the developers are totally rocking the upgrades on this game.
---
Pretty sure the quest is still active. It’s a repeating event.
---
&gt;if you have only played that one game in the series
---
Only game I've played, but I dove heavily into the lore. Read a bit, but mostly watched lore videos. The story of the universe has me fully drawn in. 
---
&gt;It is free now so it’s a great time financially to try it. 
---
I just saw that earlier today.  I'll have to give it a try. Thanks for the reminder. 
---
&gt; I think it’s a great time to begin...well, except it’s Monday : (.
---
I'm a teacher. I've got until September lol.
---
Same!! My buddy and I usually just use Xbox Party to be able to hear eachother... but now I guess we'll have to figure out how to get it working correctly.
---
'get undeservedly eviscerated' in particular the word 'undeservedly'. Todd is the face of Bethesda and as such get's the grief when they mess up. He also gets the praise when they do something good, e.g. becoming known as 'God Howard'
---
Yeah that seems to be the case from what I've seen. Idk how I feel about it...
---
For 500 an hour, you can hire me to play YouTube over the mic and follow you around.
---
I've only gotten caps for killing but it's a great way to get XP i just hope you keep overseer rank
---
I saw someone say they are just character icons. Not 100% though.
---
This was even more effective in survival mode with chameleon Armour hahaha
---
Second and third that.
---
Is it!? Is it just added to your once automatically after you rank up? I’m at 5 and I haven’t seen one yet.
---
ty so much this worked, is this a viable solution for other mods as well? I wanted to grab an inventory sorter and a reshade possibly
---
Can you play the game without PlayStation plus? I own the disc already
---
Hey does anyone know hoe to play with friends along with randoms
---
I was surprised that I enjoyed the nuclear winter....good times
---
So basically they made it the same as all other battle royales. Lame. Would be a lot cooler if there was some strategy involved by way of perk choices or at least limited gear selections.
---
I just tried removing all my perks and reapplying them, and that fixed both Gun Fu and Pharma Farma.
---
Let us build our own radio stations and be hosts.
---
Is the legendary vendor still available? Can I still complete the Nukashine quests and Scout quests?
---
Throwing myself in here in case someone actually comes with an answer haha.
---
It should work for them all best I know, the game itself won't load them up as its not finding the custom.ini
---
Yup to all three.
---
First 10 ranks are player icons, perk card packs and stash boxes, after that I don’t know but later on you’ll unlock power armour skins, new helmets, a Vault 51 jumpsuit and camp trophies all of which you can use in adventure mode
---
think it’s a very low percentage but it’s still there
---
Oh god…
---
No mods or custom ini here either, it reset all my controls settings to default.  Didn't check video settings but they seem unchanged.
---
Summer, summer is coming...
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Maybe the raiders can upload her program into the sheepsquach impostor :)
---
Nothing they are just player icons to use
---
Last night I had a dream I was playing the new battle royale mode. I was taking down fools left and right, and at the end a machine spawned and to win I had to take it. I won of course, because I'm a great player in my dreams.
---
Wait so I can change my profile picture to a fucking box?
---
Only if you look at like that.  Ijust prefer not to go that route. If it works for someone eles Cool.
---
You have extremely low standards.
---
Yep
---
There needs to be a huge cut in the time it takes between matches. Maybe let the exploration of Vault 51 take place in Adventure, not in the couple minutes before a match. Not like we can really immerse ourselves in the lore while on the clock and hearing the constant loud ass "FWUMP FWUMP FWUMP" from everyone punching everything.
---
 I'm not sure how to post.  I'm not familiar with the BGS file system.
---
I think the only reason I quit was because I learned the pump shotty schematic was forever out of my reach due to my level and I just didn't feel like restarting.  It was beyond stupid to limit the level ranges schematics become available.
---
Did they ever change that?
---
Basically
---
Deadass I did this the other day in a workshop:
---
https://i.imgur.com/hb4Wi9c.png
---
Yep. I just checked modless, Gun Fu is broken.
---
Right. The playing field is level and the game is definitely strategic. Best of luck out there!
---
Got a "diseased chair" at level 10
---
We say autumn too you ain’t special.
---
I don't know if I'm doing something wrong. If I'm in a team with random people can they automatically just hear me if my mic is on or do I have to do something for that to work?
---
because it is for soy boys, twitch thots, and 12 year olds
---
4 games and died first encounter in all 4. Reason I don't get battle royal games.
---
Or building fucking shit.
---
Yeah I agree with the load time. Im sure a lot goes in to it, but a big turn off for these battle royale games is how long it takes to load vs how long the game lasts. Let me get back in fast and id gladly play it more. Love it aside from thay.
---
[removed]
---
To expand on quakesumos point..
---
Yup, plenty.
---
Well, while I'm sure you probably believe it, you're opinion isn't the only one. You're style of play isn't the only one. They didn't take away adventure mode. Go play that.
---
I recently came back to F76. I bought it at launch and didn't play for a few months. I made a new character recently and I have to say that I'm enjoying the game quite a lot and new content only makes me want to play it more. And I'm glad there will be NPC's coming. Things are looking good for this game.
---
Well for the most part you did actually, i just tend to over analyze and make a quick summary with assumptions based on the walls first paragraph. 
---
Though based upon your previous posts i did get the idea that you are not at all a fan of PvP in fallout 76, and i agree with you on that, not because i don't like PvP games but because of how this game handles twitch mechanics along with a lot of variables included in the mix that makes it kind off un appealing to me. Maybe because i grew up playing CS a battle royale type of PvP multi player game, no server lags and no OP gear, everyone spawns with equally leveled gear regardless of load out they choose that suits their play style. I always loved playing that game.
---
Now i am not saying that people who spent hundreds of hours grinding for the best gear they can get their hands on should be leveled to a player who has barely jumped into the game and has put less than 20 hours in game and little to no effort on getting their gear to be at an even playing field with the veterans. 
---
To me if Bethesda was to make a BR mode, it would be better if  everybody should be able to spawn in with a pre selected load out of their choosing, no perk cards in play or gear carried over from adventure/survival. Just the pre selected load out, an equal playing field for everyone regardless of level. 
---
And the incentive? Legendaries that can be carried over to other modes.
---
Just my 2cents. Havent logged on to see how the new mode is so i can't even say anything about other than what has been speculated over the internet pripr to E3.
---
Oh look, PVE players bitching about not being catered to every second again. Who would have foreseen this occurring?
---
Xbox
---
I’ve only played one game, now I’m sitting at work waiting to go home so I can play it into the early hours of the morning. I love it.
---
They are not loot boxes
---
the first cartoony one is a player icon. The later three are skins for your stash box. The red squares are perk cards, you can redeem them from your pip boy in the vault waiting area
---
Made it to the level 10 room an dfound nothing but a holotape so far
---
/u/ladydevann, /u/valseek, /u/jessbethesda, are you guys aware of this one?
---
I don't know if they are levelled, but I'm not that good with reading levelled lists in the ESM. Hopefully, someone more knowledgeable with the ESM data structure can let us all know.
---
You keep raging against the machine, you outrage fanatic, you.
---
/Me looks at keyboard,  
---
Story checks out.
---
Oh my hope's were raised for a moment then! I suppose it's a case of hoping it gets addressed and fixed at some point soon
---
God Howard
---
They are completely different modes. You mean is not fun to play to you.
---
It’s worded as a year 2 dlc so I’d place my bets around November 19th
---
I don’t think so
---
If you are a teacher then it’s the best time to buy! And thanks for teaching. I had some amazing teachers.  As I’m remembering a few of mine right now while writing this, so will kids years from now looking back to find your footprints in their life.  It’s a really noble vocation...and apologies if you are an English teacher just ‘cause...grammar.
---
Guess what, Gun Fu is broken by this update lol
---
It works pretty well in Adventure too, I was on top of a golf cart at WS last night in Chameleon and people were just going right on by without a second glance.
---
I think as long as your at the right angle, in a bush, just not standing right in a path at eye level most won't noticed the chameleon effect.
---
I thought they were letting everyone play it for free :(
---
We don’t say ‘ain’t’
---
FO76 Community: "Can you fix broadsider? Can you buff missile launchers, they suck? Can you fix the pioneer scout badge quests? Can we have more camp budget? Etc...."
---
Bethesda: "How about a battle royal!?"
---
What's better?
---
I'd let Todd Howard get low on my standards
---
They’re C.A.M.P stash boxes
---
You’ve still covered pretty much all of the main content but the dlcs will give you plenty of fresh running around to do.
---
In nuclear winter your  gear doesn’t transfer you just start new each time.
---
Not much! :)
---
Id be more partial to “K Billy’s Super Sounds of the 70’s” personally. 
---
https://youtu.be/8mto3YoSIEM
---
Looks like no one agrees with you
---
“New game mode is pretty fun though!” 😂 glad those assholes didn’t ruin the game for you
---
Well i got the elders coat but idk if that counts
---
I have played the game and being honest.... even being a huge fan of fallout I can say that now Fallout 76 feels like a game, at the beginning felt like a Beta game and that was for the next 5 months, but at this moment it feels nice to play :)
---
Yeah it’s still a shit learn rare at high INT, and I’m not 100% sure that what I proposed is true, but I still boost my INT to 25 with unyielding and berry mentats just in case.
---
"I want a Fallout battle royal!!"
---
-No one, ever
---
Into the wee hours of the mornin!
---
Way to definitely not be toxic at all...
---
Haha glad someone caught it. Sucks it doesn't let you edit titles. I'm forever displayed as an illiterate baboon across this sub 🤣
---
no
---
Do kills made in Nuclear Winter count toward the Good Grief trophy? It's all I need to platinum!
---
You can actually build in nuclear winter. I'm not sure exactly how to do it but the guy in my party placed down turret however I couldn't when I placed my camp so I imagine you find the plans in the game.
---
Ok thanks for that
---
I'm just happily playing my game and laughing at the toxic ones. If you see me as toxic I apologize.
---
A bit bitter over one small group of mediocre players. Not everyone is a douche.
---
They are but the website says you need that because it is multiplayer
---
It should. I’ve got it as well and can see it in the atomic shop with the option to favorite it. All of your “owned” outfits will be at the very end of all the outfits available, right before the headwear section
---
Congrats.
---
Ah probably....I was referring to the fortnite stuff... nuclear winter reminded me of counter strike many many years ago
---
like in any battle royale, yes
---
no he went back to Dogg again
---
I know. I already checked. And nothing.
---
Yeah it's not for everyone,  I respect that :)
---
Imagine Rose gets loose in Watgo's bot factory and hops herself from bot, after bot, after bot.
---
I think it said in the patch notes that the game mode won't allow you to play with any mods enabled for that very reason.
---
Sorry man, just read your post. Im in Melbourne so might be tricky to be online at same time :-(
---
I'm pretty sure I tried that. I'm not on my PC now but I'll try later. This doesn't look like a feature though. The character stutters as if he was stuck in terrain until I press a second directional key.
---
I wish we could play with friends.
---
I've played 12 games now, won 5 and went 2nd 4 times ;)
---
You do need PS+
---
One and done.
---
No squad for me so I not even thinking about playing this a second time.
---
This is what the crossbow should be in the main game it makes it an actual worth while weapon.
---
That is how FO76 updates. It replaces the whole game to reduce overall file size.
---
Yes you do need a PS+ subscription. For that reason it may be better to play on PC. Plus PC players don't seem to have to deal with the DL times that console players do either.
---
Everyone can tell you the game is bad or good but how reliable is that information if they don’t know your play personality? Roll the dice and figure it out for yourself. Is it really going to ruin the rest of your life to redownload a game and try it again?
---
im still downloading it &gt;-&lt; ill msg back when its done
---
I played Adventure Mode for a couple of hours after the update today and didn't see anything new broken.
---
Yes we do, and it’s Spring for us bottom dwellers lol
---
fun...the load times on ps4 are alittle long but I am having a lot of fun with this. More than I thought I would.
---
I checked and there was nothing there. Im restarting fallout though. Maybe a refresh will do it
---
Explosive weapons (not legendary effect) seem to be op now. Not sure if it's visual bug or actually how it's always been.
---
Bless
---
No one cared who I was until I put on the headset
---
Yep, and Bethesda [is apparently aware](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz2d7s/gun_fu_perk_not_working_after_nuclear_winter/eqpiojg).
---
Yeah you usually get nothing but I got a cap from one yesterday in adventure mode haha
---
Keanu Reeves... For the love of Talos... Keanu Reeves!
---
I'm using it, it feels the exact same as marsupial.
---
Once you go Dogg...
---
I've hid in a tower at the end while everyone else fought it out. Ironically they where murdered by the SB and I won
---
40 euros. No regrets as well
---
so basically fortnite bushes?
---
SWEET I KNEW MY BUSH WOOKIE TRAINING WOULD PAY OFF
---
Shhh, they’ll nerf it to level 21 and up.
---
Someone suggested before that Nukes should cause a map wide rad storm. That would be amazing.
---
Is it your own fermenter? Not sure if by design or bug, but found i can't use anyone elses. Only my own.
---
What’s the point of this new battle royale? To be overseer? Also what do you get that carry’s over to the main game ?
---
You’re welcome! Glad you found it
---
I don't tend to trust this company anymore. So when my download says something like "downloading demo" which is what the ps store says, I get sketched out. Plus the main game page still had it at $30 until you went 2 pages down to the demo page. Demos usually aren't full games, hence me asking a reasonable question.
---
Anyone know what level though?
---
Blackout has zombies but they are marked on the map so you can avoid them
---
What this guy said
---
I just hit level 6 and have had two server crashes on XB1.  I guess considering how many matches I’ve played it’s not too.  Won one match and got overseer but didn’t get anything. Probably part of the sneak peek I’m guessing.
---
I was just thinking this! It would be so awesome
---
it wasnt upvotes, people were just saying really trashy things at me that got removed by mods
---
I was looking forward to some analysis of the damage numbers with specific perks, ranks, weapons and legendary effects  to refine my setup and reduce my gun collection for some more stash space.
---
This is the absurd.
---
I don't see a /s so I must assume you are serious.
---
Yeah and fresh out of the vault newbies would love that too.
---
"Bush wookies... Bush Wookies everywhere..."
---
"But this is Fallout?"
---
"Mutant Bush Wookies..."
---
Play.
---
mods don't get you banned.
---
I should have switched those two words around or somehow worded this thing differently.  There is deserved criticism and undeserved evisceration.  I didn’t realize me referencing only the part of the blowback that was undeserved would make it seem as though I thought all criticism was undeserved.  In other words I am thanking them for taking the undeserved part of it.  The whole post had nothing to do with the well-deserved criticism which existed and was understood by seemingly everyone including Bethesda.  It’s a given they would stand by normal criticism and even really harsh criticism.  I am not talking about those.
---
I traded kills with a non-PA guy, while in T51, while using a gatling. On my first round no less.
---
So you can definitely die in PA if you stop dead in your tracks to gatling someone.
---
That sucks. My guess is they’re saving content until it officially releases.
---
All of the backlash was deserved. 
---
This game came out ~7 months ago and is still broken in so many ways. Instead of fixing bugs, they're adding BR. 
---
Many of us paid $60 for the privilege of being beta testers and this game is now in the bargain bin. 
---
This has been one of the worst gaming experiences I've had in recent history and that includes NMS and Sea of Thieves.
---
You might want to give some more context so we can understand what the hell you're talking about.
---
They should just make it a "hard" mode. Increased needs, increased damage, increased rads, increase exp/rewards, always PvP. Maybe even Lower Carry Weight or in increased weight on certain items.
---
And then again at 100 😂
---
Lol it was funny seeing all the Bethesda haters in the comments on the e3 livestream when the crowd was clapping instead of booing
---
Was wondering this too.  What are the crate rewards?
---
Not like in game crates, but ones you get for leveling
---
Exactly. Thats what I like about it. There no over the top movement. It's about aiming and shooting but there's also a lot of mechanics people are just starting to understand. Honestly I didn't think id like it this much. It's cool I'm pretty sure the experience carries over to the single player game as well.
---
Bro, if any Theys got away with the least amount of trouble.  
---
They got away with lying to customer.  
---
They should thank that they didn't had to deal with lawsuit and shutdown of company.
---
Go to the atom shop and favorite it
---
I totally agree.
---
You have to have bought an Atom shop outfit. Go into the Atom Shop and select it as the NW favorite.
---
Exactly
---
I see you are trying to emulate a certain imbecilic twitter talkers vernacular. That is truly the saddest part of this thread.
---
You don’t. They aren’t crates. They are automatically unlocked icons you earn.
---
I don't agree, but it certainly way better than I thought it was going to be. To think this is just a beta... Great future for 76!
---
Yeah it's called rotating. If the team is bad, you can make it to #2 solo by laying low, don't bother with rez, but it's not fun. Valid tactic though in br! I took down a scorchbeast in last game, they hit hard cause you're not geared out. Guess they count as elite [https://i.imgur.com/1zu1MZV.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1zu1MZV.jpg)
---
weird,  in adventure mode you clearly hear your character grunt, followed by blood splatter AND a arrow of the direction the shot came from
---
Yeah I can see the UI gripe. The map being the way it is is fun, you need to actually think about your position and the foliage adds a good stealth element
---
That Hellfire and Inferno Power Armors are making me salavate. They look so amazing!
---
Ok. But how do I open them then? Where do I find what I’ve unlocked?
---
funny cuz i think nuclear winter sucks. not fun at all and it has no place in a fallout game.
---
Way to generalize an entire demographic because of your negative experience

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

This is for NUCLEAR WINTER
---
Hopefully revives and hacking counts as well!
---
The Vault 51 suit shows up as an Atom Shop purchased item, so there's a good chance it's universal.
---
Might depend on the actual item though.
---
I suck at pvp in battle royal team deathmatch seems to be ok but never can kill anything in these got my first two kills and it was cause my teammate was getting killed and they wasn't paying attention to me 2 kills 6 games yeah I need to just go back to adventure.
---
this is happening to me as well. pausing the download and reopening the launcher keeps changing the GB number too (it says 11.76GB/11.76GB for me rn). super weird
---
They are in the atomic shop. The containers are skins.
---
hey, jumping on now.  Are you around?
---
I’m a special one, sorry. Have a nice day
---
2 on 2 off 3 on 3 off which is nice because I get a three day weekend every other weekend but rest of the time its kind of rough. all in all its cool I like it . just makes organized gaming events and stuff out of the question.
---
Right! The idea of this game mode would had been the pun of a joke a year ago. Now it’s a reality, that strangely fits nicely
---
thank you brüther
---
Threeee doggg oweeeeeeeeeeee!!!
---
Yeah I was pissed watching the press conference. I had heard rumors of a BR mode being added but I thought it was bs. The fact that the mode centers around becoming an overseer just makes me even more disappointed. Running expirements on a vault sounds like a amazing concept. Hopefully they'll act on this concept in the next entry.
---
Ah..well ok then. That just seemed like a lot!
---
And that is exactly how it works. Be patient and most of all be sneaky.
---
Reading through the subreddit a believe one is just a player icon and the others are skins for you stash box in adventure mode, a bit disappointing if you ask me
---
Wastelanders is coming in the fall
---
awesome ty for info
---
I think you can invite via social. But I don’t have any 76 friends, so that’s a guess.
---
I've won a few and no PA, I bet it's just a higher level unlock
---
Okay just checking back in this mode is dope and I’m having a lot of fun with it
---
He is a robot though
---
Right there with you man. I love this Battle Royale. Really, really impressive so far!!
---
Yep. It's getting me killed, I'm a bloodied build so I don't have time for bugs.
---
its an awesome update for people who can...
---
So you keep your level between games?
---
Everyone hated that
---
I think the later levels will give something decent at least I hope
---
It improves after level 10.
---
Yup
---
Ok. Cant wait to unlock all the new loot. Just hope they dont start adding seasons in a adding a paid battle pass ststem like fortnite and apex.
---
I’d rather have more pve action. More dlc like fallout 4.
---
I think it’s fun or plain funny to squirrel away
---
Yea but your name pops up in red on their screen. So they would know someone is right in front of them they would have to just pin point it! Lol
---
That would be interesting, like being able to play a murder mystery DURING the crime itself. Being able to be there before eveyrone died would be an interesting thing, and maybe would work for a prequel game if they ever made one. But no need to restart the game for it, we just got the people back in the land, i dont wanna lose that achievement.
---
Click the letters and Posters found at Train Stations and C.A.M.P.S
---
Build the free terminal item in your camp, it will direct you to new content...
---
Get the new Camera. Search YouTube for locations
---
Look up the legendary vendor also check out the new and improved White Springs Mall.
---
Any idea on the hellfire armor?
---
Check the volume control and their mic might be too far away from their mouth.
---
Agreed... I had a team that attempted to blitz a group holder up in the Sutton Station...
---
Yeah my aim is shit I have issues killed ai
---
Yeah the thought has entered my mind but I have a feeling that the game they wanted to make was Adventure Mode. I don't think they just wanted to make another Battle Royale. I'm sure we will see updates for Nuclear Winter for years to come (which is exciting) but I don't think it will take away content from Adventure Mode.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Adventure Mode is the meat and potatoes of the game, Nuclear Winter is the gravy.
---
They are exclusive to Nuclear Winter. For now...
---
I would be curious as to the same
---
Naw lesson learned is dont accept blind invites.
---
Also, dont fall for the low level hitting you with a knife routine.  They do no damage and there is always some high level stealthboyed nearby waiting to one shot you.
---
New one I found Saturday night was a player is wanted at his team mates camp.  The guy who owns the camp acts like the other guy is attacking him and his camp while fake shooting at him.  The second you try to help him they both attack you.
---
These annoyances aside, dont be afraid of all us higher levels.  Most of us wont invite to team but we will help you out.  Stim you, help you kill something, hell I'll give you some water and chems if you're dyin.  And theres a lot of us.
---
I'm having a blast. I might never play adventure again :D
---
Gary!
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
No problem. You have a nice day, too.
---
it's fun. i'm a complete cheese on this kind of game modes, but it's still great fun just to being in a fallout world where everyone starts at equal foot and all of the sudden you're dead, but no actual consequences for dying.
---
it is great fun, and since is fully optional i'm 110% ok with this existing inside a game that i have already paid money to have at launch
---
Is the game playable yet
---
Got to go into the Atomic Shop directly and hover over the item you want to wear and there is a button at the bottom of the screen that says NW Favorite, that is what your looking for.
---
I wish I knew
---
He might as well delete his account.
---
Turns out it’s a skin for your stash box
---
Oh ok yea I thought it was just me but thanks for the info
---
Came here to ask a similar question for ps4. Launched the game and it told me I needed to patch. Closed game and initiated download. Now its saying it needs 22gb of space. Fuck I don't even want to play the new mode.
---
Yep. Can't use mine, Biv's or ones at other camps
---
that kinda sounds more like a personal problem than a game one
---
put nukashine in nuclear winter
---
Oh you mean the 'planted, paid shills?'
---
I do believe the people up front were wildly enthusiastic and probably Beth employees or very close to it. And they really stuck the cameras on the people dressed in fallout stuff, because knowing the gaming community right now there were probably actually a lot of people crossed armed and booing. 
---
I get why they would ensure there are some fans up front , it's a huge show and the world is watching. It's no different then padding seats at concerts and stand up shows. 
---
When someone shoots a Netflix special they aren't going to have a bunch of hecklers and empty seats
---
I know I’m so used to just pressing vats once and going on a killing spree lol
---
Sorry man, that sucks so hard. 
---
It doesn’t help, but at least it was caps and not a piece of gear!
---
It honestly reminds me of Fasnacht and having the whole community together in one place.
---
I love it
---
[Plan your build first here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) 
---
As changing things up later is a pain in the arse
---
Is there any LFG forum for this? I’m on PC looking for buddies to play the game and queue with for this mode also. (Returning player)
---
Al teams I’m on die immediately or leave almost just won as a solo with 8 kills.
---
this is the first im hearing of it
---
Turns out it’s a stash box skin
---
Epic did it with fortnite. Abandoned the main game when the battle royal game got popular.
---

---
Go in settings and turn on push to talk. Most often people don't use their mics.
---
Same issue here
---
They reset monday at 5.... so just recently. I doubt anyone has them yet. Even nukacrypt still says unsolved. 
---
https://nukacrypt.com/
---
I thought it was in settings
---
Oh man, I really hope weapon holstering is back. It has annoyed me to no end ever since FO4 that we just pull our guns out of thin air. Really unpolished
---
Looks like I need to play something else till wastelanders in out.
---
Trippy
---
People are still figuring out how to play the new mode, and there are a lot of free trial players this week. It’s got potential
---
I’m just glad to see todd again honestly, I need more of him in my life
---
I believe they're going to do that when it "officially" launches (this is just a preview beta)
---
The Battle Royale ain't for me. My copy of the game should be arriving today if all goes well and I'm hella excited to get stuck in
---
The moment mods and private/offline comes to FO76 I’ll hop back in without a second though. I love the work you modders do!
---
Can confirm that on ps4 as well
---
That's what vending machines are for bro. You cant trust anyone out there. How did you manage to trade him 50k caps but not get the gun in the same trade?
---
Caps, exp, NW exclusive skins. You gain overseer expirience to get overseer rangs, with each rank you'll get rewards like icons, skins, perk card etc each 10 overseer ranks you're able to open new vault 51 locations and learn about it's lore
---
When in the vault go to the atom shop and select a skin you own it will be favorited.
---
Spent half the day in nuclear winter and the other half in adventure, I've yet to find a single new bug
---
The small stash is just an icon. Not sure about the other but I’ve seen people say it’s a skin
---
My cousin’s ex use to drink gravy alone... anything is possible 😐
---
I noticed something similar, my AAE was doing about 40% more damage per bullet than my TSE, the TSE edged out with both bullets being accounted for.  I would assume that the TSE is calculating the damage and then splitting the damage across each bullet.
---
I know where you're coming from. So usually what I do is just run around the map and gather up the goods that I need. Once you figure out a good route for yourself it'll be real easy and takes a lot less time than a workshop does to gather resources.
---
This has happened to me a few times and once I got a gnarly headache and almost threw up. Had to quit the game for a day.
---
That was my thought process also I wanted to test some situational weapons against my current bloodied setup with different damage boost cards.
---
You should be fine. Only mods i could see getting you banned is if you're cheating, like using an aim bot or something to give you an advantage over others. Something like this is just a cosmetic thing to make it look better.
---
Fyi if you plan to play battle royale mode, any and all mods are blocked. So you'd have to disable or remove them when playing.
---
I just logged in and saw that.
---
It's been an unmarked Vault since March but never has it been stated that it was the nuclear winter vault.
---
Ya I play the battle royale today and over all it’s not super bad but it’s not really for me either, it still has a fallout feel to it but I’m still a adventurous type
---
And that’s why
---
Cosmetic you unlock as you ascend overseer ranks I think.
---
People always hate on br but when it comes out it’s always pretty good I feel like
---
Okay. Thank you!
---
It's been marked since then. The patch after they added in the vault, they added a number to it.
---
Nice catch!
---
yes
---
Console? Might accidentally bump into him
---
Wouldnt mind a ping system like in Apex. Feel like the countdown when you are downed is too short and I would like if someone could come up with where the higher level drops are on the map, so far camp mc McClintock and some of the SE areas seem to be popular but some data would help. Love the BR mode so far but tweaks are needed.
---
No ini edits required the game supports 21:9 now. Ive been running a 3440x1440 monitor for a few months now with no issues. Is your ini file read only? could be that its not updating when you change to your resolution in the game menus.
---
Is VATS usable or removed completely?
---
Totally fucking agree. I was very disappointed.
---
Ive never been able to use voice chat.. no matter what Ive tried I just cant hear a thing
---
That means I should be doing better since new ppl dont know how stuff works yet I'm gonna be worse as time goes on.
---
 I think it's more of I cant use a static weapon I use all the time and get good with it's kinda odd I do fine in cod battlefield but cant seem to kill anything in battle royal.
---
I've seen thebandit on before thanks for the heads up.
---
I disagree with only one perk per SPECIAL. I have 3 lvl 1 Str cards equipped.
---
How do you open the crates you unlock in nuclear winter?
---
If it looks, feels, smells, and walks like a dog.... "ITS A DOG"
---
You have to turn them off before playing  nuclear winter. some stupid reason idk.
---
All's I'm saying is, I'm not enjoying the game atm so I'm not playing atm, and I'm not sitting here hoping that the people who think differently are uncomfortable or eating their words or feeling bad in anyway... 
---
Fanboyism can be just as toxic as haterism...
---
With new damage numbers system we totally need it. also would be nice to choose armor for dummy to see how damage works with different armor types
---
Hasnt happened until today for me. I swapped back to Adventure from Nuke Winter. All the colors maaaaan.
---
That's... never happened to me before. I'm not sure you're correct..
---
I’m on late shift this week so my schedule is crazy but I accepted! Currently waiting for the update 😑
---
actually a good idea. maybe even induvidual markers would be cool.
---
They usually have a root point behind a lot of their satire, it's not like they picked FO76 out of a hat.
---
I'm not really enjoying it either. It's too "fast paced" for me, fallout to me has always been slow and ponderous, about atmosphere and tactical choices. Maybe I just got old.
---
i’m not good at it, therefore it is bad and a waste
---
It does.
---
Gotcha, thanks
---
They are player icons guys. Feels bad.
---
I like it.
---
if you mean like the one you get at rank 4, they’re just icons. i was really disappointed after looking through camp menu and everything looking for it and then found it in atom shop
---
Jesus right numerous times I've watched people blitz uphill against people who are heavily fortified shooting downwards when they have no cover.
---
But hey decoys are always nice
---
Oh wait is it out already?
---
The loading screens its to long 3 in a row, they need to work on it to be faster i would like a option to load again after finishing the last one, at least put me back in the lobby and not in the mode screen option, but its lots of fun so far
---
Did I say it was a waste for everyone no I'd said for someone like me
---
Thanks, we should have a stickies post with scammers
---
What did it for me,
---
Isn't it an emblem?
---
Self proclaimed "gamers" who get legitimately mad at people for liking a game they don't make me feel better about myself.
---
I never implied you did
---
Me and a friend donned space suits and marsupial jumped around new players giving out free stuff and being goofy. Ran into one asshole almost immediately who told us to screw off because he logged 1000 hours in Fallout 4. Other than that it was a good time.
---
You bring over cosmetics, apparent and your SPECIAL points (minus passive bonuses) but nothing else. Overseer rank is gained by surviving as long as you can and killing enemies. Your rank lets you access more areas in Vault 51.
---
Had the exact same problem today. Even the terminal you can put in your camp told me the daily was ready to be done. Gave me the quest marker to talk to him and he just kept complaining about nuclear waste but didn't give the quest.
---
Just a side question here. Is a TSE Gatling Plasma really worth 50k Caps?
---
You've leveled up, go into adventure mode to do it.
---
The reason the collect option isn't there is because you are dropping it. It makes it an unclaimed set of power armor until someone enters it. You want to deploy it, by selecting it through pipboy. The name also goes away because you are removing it from your inventory. Not sure if you were actually looking for a response or answer, but I just want you to know that this isn't a bug. You are dropping the item instead of deploying.
---
Lol at first I was excited I mean free drugs hell yeah. But woof the headache after was wild.
---
Have you tried it yet?  
---
I don't think we will see legendary items carry over for balance reasons that should be clear once you play a couple rounds
---
&gt;Third, "laughing stock" is a bit of a reach. They released one subjectively bad game.
---
It's pretty funny that you'd say this in a post about an article that's taking the absolute piss out of Bethesda for that bad game.
---
You can just favourite atom shop items.
---
I'm still salty about that. Kinda curious sometimes if they actually changed something in the last few months, been quite a time since I quit...
---
That's what I thought but nothing happened when I logged into adventure mode
---
For now since its in beta but once the actual update rolls out the vault should open
---
The majority of my experience from every Battle Royale match comes from the survival experience for me
---
First and foremost its fallout. But dont get me wrong, i wouldnt stand for crap. There so much i enjoy about it. The size of the world, the way it looks. It has its parts of difficulty. Camp building is awesome and able to make your own stores. Bethesda works on this game constantly. New stuff almost every week + fixes. This newest update/game mode is fun af. The game has its issues but nothing game breaking. For real, im happy i ignored the hate and picked this up months ago. Play everyday.
---
Same here. I tried with two characters and no luck.
---
Yes. For a week trial.
---
Go ahead and complain on expensive games or something. Go fight for the cause. If $25 dollars or a free trial is not worth your time then don't support it. 
---
But please stop whining on the forums, keep it to yourself nobody cares if a game has a couple of MTX because we're talking about years of entertainment, we've established this a while ago. Games can't be released like the old times because sometimes you wouldn't be able to fix it with the technology back then. You ended up having buggy messes that fucked people's life's and couldn't be repaired because of some small mistake. This is the future of gaming, we've embraced it a while ago. 
---
Yes the game will have it's faults but they will fix it and when you support it you see the fruits thru time. 
---
I admire that you fight for what you believe, we're humans and we need to coexist with each other. 
---
So don't you think that you're being a little over dramatic in a forum where people have actually invested their time in? 
---
Just saying, this will be my last reply because based on your history you're a persistent one ;)
---
The begining start by doing the first responders missions and do powering up posidon when you get to morgantown stop by Grafton steel if you haven't learned the tinker bench plan should be one right next to the tinker bench.dont forget to equip pharma farma and push search to reveal more items this will help with supplies like water stims disease cures and rad away. One you have a tinker bench water purifier and power generator you have all the supplies for you base of operation just make you camp near water and away from vault 76 for more fat travel options. If your near the Farris wheel north of the map do the event leader of the pack to get you some early legendary.
---
That's you man. Enjoy. 
---
I've had enough people come down on me for liking this game, and not just online, but in real life. I've never seen that before. 
---
People go.out of their way to slight this game or belittle you for liking it. I'm not a fan boy, I barely get to game 8 hours a week. So this is the only game im playing right now, and yeah it's pretty lame to have tons of people shitting on your hobby constantly. 
---
So yeah, I cant wait until even another year from now when the game is a whole different beast and hopefully even better than it is now. 
---
I'll do what I want, thanks for your comment though :)
---
How does this get past testing? Like how the actual hell?
---
Yes dogmeat atleast.
---
Awesome, glad it wasn't just me!
---
My advice is to run around frantically waving your hands while wearing your underwear on your head.  
---
As for fallout 76, you can find new quest lines by visiting train stops and looking at the posters, and also go check the basement of Arktos pharma in the forest as well as the sewers of harpers ferry :)
---
You can only get traps and turrets from world drops, they won't carry over in blueprints. So your best bet is to make a defensible CAMP blueprint. Just remember though that other players can get a nuke an insta kill you if you decide to turtle.
---
I suck at PvP too. Almost got one kill in my first game. Died halfway through. 
---
To quote my friend, "The only way to get better is to play with people who are better than you."
---
No.
---
Side note, love your name
---
Loot is individual for you both - both from bodies and containers. What my friends and I do is just pick up everything and then figure out what each of us is using- it’s really useful especially for ammo if say you use 10mm and I used .45 we just swap :)
---
I play solo mostly. I know that if you both tag an enemy and kill it you'll both get different items. No sharing there. Most loot on the ground is only there for the first person to grab it then it's gone until the server reloads it hours later. There could be a few exceptions however.
---
Thanks I'll give it a go.
---
yes...i can read,  im stating that this doesn't happen in adventure mode
---
I believe they are cosmetic items.
---
Then yes it's a waste cause I can't play it. All I'm playing is load screen simulator on how many times I  I got to restart it just to die from the first person I see I bought fallout for a somewhat fallout experience not fortnite.
---
I didn't think about this!!!
---
Nothing, you carry over no items and can only use what you can pick up and find.
---
I never heard about the Nuka Dark. Was it as bad as the bags?
---
I guess children don't count.
---
It was so great to meet you and the rest crew!
---
Thanks for being constructive with your criticism haha. I'll be sure to watch out for those other things though, it was a real heart breaker even though my base was easy to fix. Next time I'll be more careful haha
---
Best instance I had of priorities.  Spawn into the zone run into the building, enemy jumps in the PA first, I proceed to loot the room of weapons, they try to punch me while I hit them with grenade launcher rounds and finish them off with a Tommy Gun.
---
Moral of the story, always grab the gun first.
---
I got a water from one just the other day, but first one in a long time
---
New phrase unlocked. I dog this game. Noice.
---
I got the four codes. Couldn’t figure out how to launch one though
---
This is a list of links to comments made by Bethesda employees in this thread:
---
This is a bot providing a service. If you have any questions, please [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ffo76). If you'd like this bots functionality for yourself please ask the r/Layer7 devs.[](#AUTOGEN_TSBREPLIEDBOT)
---
Only downside is that you pick a spot to spawn rather than jumping in from the air. This does mean you have no idea where anybody else will spawn, so you can end up surrounded by other players.
---
The tone is completely different.
---
That’s cool. I’ve been running stealth/vats crit since the beta and wrote a guide on it a while back. I tried to pioneer it during the massive TSE cheating phase but it was largely ignored because it required more thought than 5 points in explosive, marsupial, and a TSE shotgun
---
I actually have videos of wasting a lot of great players and then getting tons of hate mail calling me cheater..... by cheaters. The irony was astounding
---
Here’s a tip start at cow sports cementary and take the bridge all the way down till you get to other side and go through door and use terminal to get weapon, ive won 8 games already doing this route
---
Which rank though
---
I believe it’s essentially a beta in a sense. I think it’s being taken down after this week, worked on and probably soon after reintroduced.
---
So glad I bought it, every video says not to buy but I went with my gut. And I’m glad I did got it at half off too with 500 atoms
---
Luckily enough I started with the new game mode and ended with adventure mode haha.
---
All in all still a fun game!
---
When I've spent more time in a load screen than the game in the past hour I find it a waste of time I should be farming to get my daily script from the vendor to get some crappy legendaries.
---
It isn’t bugged you literally can’t vats other players in nw.
---
Hey you, you’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush. Same as us, and that thief over there.
---
Fair point. Not overly bitter but it was one of the moments where you let out a heavy sigh as you admit you've been duped haha. Also had the mic open so I'm sure they got a good chuckle out of it.
---
Doesn’t help the magazines are small af too
---
You could just ignore the haters instead of seeking vindication though. I've been made fun of for buying and playing the game to, it didn't hurt me in the least. I've had enjoyment in the game, just ran out of things to do so I'm doing other things and hoping Bethesda has a sensible endgame at some point...
---
I think it's only cosmetics from the atom store. I bet that when Nuclear Winter officially releases they are going to make it free to play just like Epic did with Fortnite.
---
I have wanted to fly over the world (adventure mode) to get a sense of the areas, every time I have a vantage point I always try to pick out landmarks and get see if I can get my bearings. Does anyone know of a video or a way to do that? The closest thing I saw was with the catapult “bug”
---
its basically a beta
---
And if possible I recommend shortening the amount of time between matches. Being trapped in a room with 50 bored people punching the air for two minutes gets old fast
---
Nail - Head.   
---
  
---
Besides the demands for info, the spam is mighty, I've got hundreds and hundreds of unread notifications, and we haven't cross the. 24 hour mark.  
---
No clue if this will be an isolated event and if it will net even cleaner channels of communication, but we can hope.
---
I agree. Map-wide rad storms, not as much unless multiple nukes go off at once in a close area. Ground bursts are the ones that cause massive fallout. Air burst, like the nukes in-game seem to be, not so much. They're roughly the same yield as Little Boy and Fat Man, I think, and those didn't even cause craters. 
---
Environment wise, I totally agree. I don't know about the logistics, but having the vegetation and buildings in nuke zones basically unflinching in the face of a *fucking nuke* is something that's always bothered me. 
---
Take Whitespring. Windows should be gone. There should be flashburns on buildings and the ground from things like trees and cars. Trees should be stripped of leaves and such. Unsturdy buildings should be rubble. 
---
But, maybe that's just too realistic?
---
Rewards from leveling in NW carry to adventure mode that’s all. Think of it as a mini game.
---
I wish i could get it to trigger the first time :(
---
Where does it tell you this?
---
The first couple are icons then you get a small blue box like the one you find in the BR mode I have one at my camp. I got a few more icons after that but it looks like I'll get an Overseers chair at level 10 I'm currently rank 8
---
True enough but I mean the first go to for those players once the game has a little resurgence is to troll people is pretty shitty but I'll be sure to limit my high level interactions to those with mics!
---
I've heard of this high road. I'll stick to the low thanks :)
---
The good thing about Fallout 76 is that you can do pretty much whatever you want. Go solo or in a group, explore the map, do events, do quests, gather materials to build a CAMP or to sell to other players, jump to Survival or the new Nuclear Winter to play against other players...
---
Loot is individual for the most part. Containers in the world can be looted by every player and the contents are unique to each one. So your wife might find pre-war money inside a locker, and you a pipe pistol. But the items that are not in containers can only be picked up by one player. Bobbleheads, for example, or some weapons. 
---
There are certain perk cards that give buffs and utility for being in a group, and there are also some that benefit you when you travel alone. Like I said, you can do whatever you want. You don't always have to explore together.
---
Its a pre-beta
---
I honestly feel like NW was actually a way for them to normalize the game for future additions
---
It looks like it walks with it's arms &amp; hands like a centaur. It has a weird collection of protruding body parts like a centaur. Of course it's not a FO3 type centaur.
---
I find griefers to be incredibly pathetic. They put way too much time and effort into doing annoying worthless things, in a game they bought and paid for just like we did. Is there time really that valueless that they spend it goading people so they can kill them for probably 20 lbs of easily farmed junk/caps?
---
Everyone keeps calling nuclear winter NW and my head says nukaworld every time
---
Yes can invite via social tab.
---
Lol, you do you my man. Also thanks for the downvotes.
---
I play on PS4, and the controls really suck, especially since vats is now partially deactivated. Coming from Rainbow 6 to this mess is a nightmare. I hope they fix this "control delay" on console... :(
---
What rewards carry over?
---
Yeah, now I will try to limit my interactions to people with mics and maybe some others acting friendly.
---
The cap was removed just after launch. Delete the ini files you changed so the game can remake them. I had lots of graphics troubles due to changing the ini file and then a patch fixing some things.
---
Just making shit up
---
Woo hoo!
---
Squad up in the main menu. If you want to matchmake into a squad it's automatically on.
---
Hang on isnt the max stack 25k?
---
Imagine being such a piss boi that you drop your power armour on the floor, get mad that your power armour is on the floor and then say it's because the game is broken lololol, good on you sc00pula, I can't bring myself to be nice to people like that
---
The reality is, if a child has access to the game, that is exclusively the fault _of the parent_ not the game company, and game companies should _never_ cater to children unless it is a -_game for children_.
---
I’ve only crashed once, and that was my Xbox, not the game itself
---
It's so you can switch out your perk cards. I know it seems pointless at atm, but when you get a bunch of cards, those 2 mins will be valuable.
---
Rank 1 in NW unlocks a vault 51 suit you can craft in adventure.
---
There's plenty of amazing players out here that will do anything to help another person out. The community is amazing overall, so it's even more jarring when someone griefs you. Just ignore them.
---
Eh BR is just as much a
---
Dont worried the wastelander's dlc is still to come. They wont forget.
---
The game isn't on steam yet.
---
Great point. I will be sure to get back out there and just enjoy my time.
---
Thanks! Worked great.
---
I just played a couple matches, never ever been interested in Battle Royale but had a lot of fun there, the thing is I know this world and it's mechanics and I like it. I think it's a great addition to the game, just something extra, I'm sure a looot of people are gonna love it
---
Have you uninstalled/reinstalled the game? Sometimes updates will fudge a file somewhere
---
You heard her Utobitha!
---
Sadly no. I need to post the screen capture. He was slouched back against the wall of the outhouse. Yes, it appears that the crashed space station is going to be the main raider base.
---
I wouldn't count on it been like that for months its actually pretty good on PC console is sluggish
---
It just seems like it's a recurring issue where he opens his mouth, makes a definitive statement, "Cosmetic only", as an example, and somewhere down the line...he's a damn liar.
---
Not 100% sure, but you will get a key. On your current account you should be able to redeem it. The game is only available through the Bethesda launcher right now.
---
Have you watched [this](https://m.ign.com/articles/2019/06/02/bethesda-knew-fallout-76-would-have-bumps-a-ign-unfiltered) interview? Around 1:35 Todd blatantly says "we never expected this game to receive good metacritic ratings". And goes on to try to justify this by essentially saying this type of development is standard now. His humbleness during e3 was mostly a facade to try and avoid being put on people's shit list. I do applaud the team that was tasked to make the game playable and get it to the point it is now but never forget Bethesda originally sold people a broken product and this cannot become the stanard in any industry.
---
Dont feel bad took me a while to figure out. Lol
---
I accidently shot one of them tonight and unfortunately for them, they happened to be wanted so down they went. But silver lining, I revived them straight away and that counted for my pioneer scout revive an ally so I'm not stuck on that part anymore!
---
That would be nice, considering my adventure mode camp has been in the same place for months and I don't want to move it.
---
Well thats a shame, better just pack the whole game mode up and fuck it right off.
---
Not big on BR but they did a good job.  Do not like the cross over to and from adventure mode tho.
---
You think that’s bad, wait till you get stuck with a whining ten year old on your team.
---
It's a Battle Royale, which comes from the Japanese movie (or book? or manga?) by the same name. In this case 52 people enter the world and you need to be the last left alive. You can't hide for long because the perimeter of the map is constantly shrinking, if you get caught outside the perimeter you'll die. Fallout's BR mode is based around squads rather than individual players, which really helps bad players like myself. You can bring CAMP blueprints over from adventure mode, although turrets have to be found if you want to place them. If you get 4 nuclear cards and the nuclear briefcase you can nuke part of the map.
---
raid
---
Awesome. No windows store or anything right ?
---
no, you are right. its the complete opposite of what makes fallout a good game. this should have been some kind of map change, not some stupid BR DLC
---
Good call. Completely forgot. Thanks !
---
On the main menu, go to social and invite to team from there. Make sure they are also on the home screen so you don’t join their game. And then whoever is team leader can start up the match
---
I found it thanks
---
All that time playing all the fallout games could be time put into your 76 account getting ready for year2.
---
Yes
---
Thanks, that’s what I couldn’t figure out. Seems like you could have an outfit locker or some such thing in the lobby.
---
respectfully, I disagree. 
---
If the game makes its money in the Atom shop, then it doesn't need to be good, it just needs to be good enough to drive the micro-transactions, and worse, pay to win.
---
This game went through the early access stage, and, depending on who is talking, still had quite a few issues, some could be considered game breaking.
---
As for people filing lawsuits, if you were sold a broken car, and told it'll get fixed eventually, maybe, you'd want your money back. 
---
Same goes for the game, the screw up with the bags, and yes the screw up with the Nuka dark rum. Bethesda let that company use their name/licence to sell a product, they should have made sure it wasn't something people would feel ripped off about.
---
Nuka dark was dumb. However, Bethesda advertised something and switched it out for a cheaper product but kept their original advertisement. They fucked up on that one.
---
If you cancel the update, it often times deletes the whole game. Idk why exactly
---
Where can I equip my cosmetics? Just started nw 🙏🏻
---
Sounded like they will at least rotate them.
---
The beginning of this game is kind of challenging.  There isn't a helluva lot of direction as to what to do first, unless you pay attention to everything you read and read everything you see.  
---
I don't mind helping someone out a bit if it will keep them in the game and exploring.
---
Hey, your game, you do what you want. :)
---
I don't know.
---
Sorry! Must have slipped.
---
Could you elaborate please?👍
---
Mine keeps doing it when I go into ny perk cards when I’m in the forest on Adventure mode
---
Social menu at the menu.
---
Nvm... I’m dumb
---
I know at the vault door there is a Holotape that is level 101. Other than that I can’t be sure
---
tbh I just got Demolition Expert as a perk and I do not need any other perk besides Hacker now to easily get kills (most of the time)
---
Won't explain how though, I'll enjoy it while it lasts haha
---
I don't want to say bloodied should be nerfed but unyielding is kinda out of control. I don't think Bethesda really designed this game thinking people would consistently have +15 to every stat on top of what they've already allocated and any bonus stats from the armor pieces abilities.
---
I've done everything I can to maximize my plasma rifles damage but it still takes like 20 rounds to kill a Yao guai that my buddy one shots with is deathclaw gauntlet, and he does enough overkill damage to kill it more than once
---
Nope, just Bethesda atm.
---
Haha thanks I’m an idiot just figured it out. Thank you very much
---
No problem!
---
At first i thought the devs were incompetent, turns out they were just working on NW, its quality shows that they put time into it and thats why adventure mode has been suffering from the start and will continue to if NW is a big hit
---
Plenty of instability on PC, especially when we run a series of nukes. Had a server disco earlier today moments after a queen fight. Happens all. The. Time. I'm not even sure there's a major difference between the software backends for each client platform.
---
I just had to rationalize this as well. I figured out how to wear cosmetics, and then later found armor and was bummed to see what happened
---
IKR I’m really digging the grey and red T-51 and the orange Ultracite one
---
with textured mods seeing with previous examples of textured mod on fallout 76 people often get banned because they think “textured th that’s. CHEATING BAN THEM FOREVER OR Till they write a apology easy “ that what happen to the previous moderate the essay one that sadly really true so yes by past examples you would get banned
---
Even with a mic when I’m saying, “Hey, here’s some free loot, take it”. I still get the scared rabbit look.
---
Not stupid. The reason is to prevent unfair advantage by anyone. Until they can provide official mod support, no real way to differentiate between your texture mod and someone cheating by using an aim bot. 
---
So far it's been really successful and that's partly do to stripping everyone down so everyone has the same chance to win. It all comes down to skill.
---
Rant incoming.
---
Really at this point in time, I have decided to try games (and also TV shows and movies) first myself before deciding if it’s bad or not and just shutting out the outside noise. 
---
I’ve experienced games (and again other medias) that people enjoy but I just couldn’t stand for the first half an hour (Spiderman PS4 comes to mind) but alot of people enjoyed it. I do enjoy things that people love like Skyrim, Witcher 3, Uncharted, Halo and etc. I also like BFV and Halo 5 which have mixed reception. I just wish I have the funds and time to experience all the games and decide for myself. 
---
Back to FO76, I have played the beta on my Xbox and enjoyed it for a few hours before quitting as I couldnt stand playing an fps in 30fps and that’s my issue. I’ll play it on my PC right now and we’ll see how it goes.
---
Sweet link from over 3 months ago
---
I too hate BR in most games. I see no difference with BR here but I am enjoying it.
---
There is a lot to be polished to make the game more enjoyable that could spill over into adventure mode like third person perspective accuracy could be a lot better so that when your aiming at someone and shooting your not hitting the fence in front of you instead of the person your clearly aiming at.
---
Implemented this in the post. Thanks for idea.
---
Has to seem lazy but is there a known list yet? That you know of?
---
Me and my teammates were not the voice chat with the option to press the button.  but putting the microphone always worked if it went well.  the truth that I do not like it when I play with randoms
---
Most of the toxic players quit, more updates keep coming out, and the community continues to try and work together to rebuild West Virginia. If who.ever reads this hasn't gotten tje game yet, now is a good time. Almost all of the issues at launch have been resolved.
---
Make sure you play in a squad and spawn with them. Fallouts BR is based around squads and not individual players.
---
Yo guys jumping into this, why is control customization so limited I can't even change my weapon keybindings.
---
That would have never happened. Zenimax has a net worth of 2.5 billion. With how shitty this game preformed at launch roughly 30-60 million would have been used to pay a class action.
---
There's no need to be unhappy friendo, have you tried playing "outside"? The graphics are great!
---
Sucks that its permadeath for each run
---
Yes I’m curious as well. I’ve asked like 10 people how to access these boxes etc. but no one will reply with an answer I’m 7 and I’ve yet to notice anything new so I feel like I’m missing out!
---
Yea I have faith they will take some of the positive feedback onboard, be nice to get a general feedback and suggestions post going...
---
That’s cool, I notice you get XP and caps for adventure mode too
---
Frustrating... I was able to get straight into games when I joined a friend on US Servers
---
Remember guys if you're gonna suck Todd's dick don't let your molars graze the head.
---
I wish we had the option of voting to remain as a team, and the ability to in ite members of parties/ friends list.
---
Otherwise its dope, a truly level playing field.
---
I've died twice already before loading into the game. Just my two cents
---
Really fun 
---
Although we can’t place camp blueprints as Bethesda said we could according to their website. 
---
It must be a bug maybe?
---
thats nice of you.  Ive asked a few dozen under-10s if they needed any armor chems or guns and 99% are alt characters.  Im getting tired of asking, so great youre doing that.
---
On my 3rd round and enjoying it so far!
---
People like you and your friends are what make this game great! Just want you to know that.
---
I've gotta agree. I scoffed when I heard about the initial BR leaks, but it actually fits the game quite well. I've never touched a BR, so it's a nice surprise that they did a great job creating one inside of a completely different game. I'm honestly just really pleased we have a form of balanced PvP in the game.
---
You have an overseer rank that increases the more you play.
---
When 76 came out in beta, you could insert the disc or enable the game to download and it would download ontop of the beta. I assume that this trial will do the same. If you buy the full version it should overwrite ontop of the trial.
---
One fist of iron, the other of steel, and the left one totally got him, huh?
---
Seems completely independent of any "risk" factor. The little orchard to the southwest usually has a power armor and/or epic crate. I started off the last match in a full suit of power armor with an automatic handmade and some drugs
---
It’s a stash box for your camp!
---
Can I? and replace it with private servers so I can mod
---
Generally it's pretty fun. It's not like there are difficult recoil patterns, and that's me talking as someone who's garbo at pvp
---
It will be out later this fall
---
Earlier I saw people saying you can equip outfits for NW in the atom shop. There's a button prompt for it? I haven't checked that yet.
---
Maybe if your character reacted to the FEV virus in a way similar to how Alice reacted to the T-virus in Resident Evil your character would get only positive effects from the infection like greater strength, endurance, and immortality.
---
I would want an option where you can requeue into another match along with the already existing leave option..
---
Yup I got a buddy that if he shows up to the queen fight it's over in 2min.
---
Thanks. :(
---
If on PS4 hmu. MoonlightCowboy
---
Ikr, I was not expecting to like the mode but for some reason I do!
---
They definitely make you tougher, but not by a huge margin, which is actually great. Otherwise, those who weren't so lucky to find some would be screwed. I'm pretty happy with the balance overall so far.
---
I thought it was suppose to be this summer? Isnt that what the road map said?
---
Great thing about it is I just met that friend today. He was a level 45 that just came back to the game after a bit of a hiatus. I got him a bunch of mutations and we got him up to level 51 and got him a decent weapon and gear set and we started having a blast. socializing is the best part of this game. giving to others makes it enjoyable for everyone.
---
Just had a match where we took on the final team 3v3 and I went down right and got hard killed right before my teammates took out the last guy, and I DID get the Overseer XP bonus!
---
Lol I cant remember off hand, you might be right
---
Idk if it's quite finished yet, idk what "sneak peek" means.
---
Ditto Jess!
---
When you download the trial, you are downloading the full game. It’s technically a “Free play” period
---
You just need the access key or disc once the week is up. Apparently -50% off for anyone who buys during the free play event
---
Fuck yeah
---
The only communication allowed in nw is team chat. Area chat isn’t an option.
---
I think the trial is the full game?
---
Wat? esplain yerself.
---
You can on PC. If it's for xbox/ps4 I do not know.
---
You have to have an owned one in the Atom shop. Select it from there, there will be a little nuke on your favorite
---
Gamers, as a whole, need to abandon preorders. If we want working products on launch, we have to stop buying unfinished ones. The preorder content is never worth the post-launch headaches that issuing an early paycheque causes.
---
Your sanity
---
Total blast!
---
Definitely needs more stuff to interact with. Maybe actually let us play slots or drink at the bar. I think that'd be a great way to kill off those minutes of wait time that we're gonna sit through over and over.
---
Oh, and please give us a target range where we can test weapon types. I didn't realize how bad I am at aiming with certain weapons.
---
amazing lol
---
Im not 100%. I dont think it had an official day, but pretty sure it said mid summer. Idk. I know wastelanders is this fall. If its not coming out until fall, i better binge it and get my fill. Haha
---
Yeah via the atom shop OR while your in the vault waiting you can go to a cut out talking about it and it prompts you to open the atomic shop.
---
yea sadly those old dailies arent like the new ones that stay with you even if you leave the server (biv, scoutquests)
---
Thanks! I have quite a few atom shop outfits so I will see if I can figure it out!
---
Another thing to add to this might be for PVP...  
---
If you choose to play in a group, remind each member to have pacifist mode enabled. If one party member has pacifist mode off, you will be open to PVP with others.
---
Sneak is broken..... again!!!
---
I hate battle royles but 3 games later and 9 kills. I think it could be a thing
---
I've caught several people hiding behind cars. I'm guessing they're new players who don't realize how deadly they are when they explode.
---
Let him be voiced by Snoop Dogg. Haha.
---
That's exactly the feeling!! Thats a great strategy I may do that if I encounter this again
---
Not the person you asked, but I'm on PC and I experience all sorts of issues, bugs and server instability. Last patch I couldn't go more than an hour without my game crashing. My friends weren't having the same problems, but the game was way less stable last patch compared to previous patches.
---
It's tied to your character though, so if you have multiple characters you'll have to level them up individually.  Sounds obvious but for some reason I had thought it would be different.
---
If it wasn't for the people that hate on 76 Bethesda would never have felt so much pressure to make 76 better, not just for the sake of the game itself but for all of their games in the future. Most people don't hate on a game just to hate it but they actually want to to be better and expect more from a company like Bethesda.
---
Every time I see a post like this it makes me think this is a echo chamber where everyone pats everyone else on the back for thinking alike.
---
might be glitched as it's only in BETA
---
I love the game. But a lot of the initial backlash was deserved though.
---
U get just a little xp for adventure mode. It leveled me up but i was close to leveling
---
Is it bad that all I want is a clean toilet and some unbroken glass windows?
---
Just hit don't find team or whatever before you click NW
---
Your rewards are atoms shop items mostly icons for me so far. I'm pleasantly surprised in how much I love this new mode. Hope that sneak peek turns into full access real soon! Dont want to lose this mode for very long after this week. It's really revived the game for me.
---
Map has to load for that guy who is using wifi on a 4 year old modem.
---
Yes, you can turn "Auto Fill Team" or whatever it says on and off. I think it's square on PS4 as you enter the game mode. I played several games solo thus far.
---
Its pre beta. Dought everything is released
---
Holy shiiiiiit. You sound like me: PVP nerd, fallout fan. I thought this BR looked wack as hell in the Beth conference. 
---
Guess I should give it a fair shake.
---
should I call the whambulance for you? :D
---
PC that can run Apex decently enough.  Have died multiple times already before loading in and had crippling lag off the start multiple times.
---
That nuclear winter is not being truly released until later on. it's not that hard to grasp. . .
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz5n2g/nw\_is\_in\_beta\_solid\_beta\_but\_still\_need/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz5n2g/nw_is_in_beta_solid_beta_but_still_need/) 
---
I made a post about this. if you are interested.
---
It's probably tied into that "legendary" mode as well, letting those who don't want to start completely from scratch do so
---
It's pretty fun.  I wish there were more modes than just squad, like singles and doubles.  But other than that it works really well.  I like how there are mongrels and ghouls and stuff, none of the other Battle Royale games had non-player enemies.
---
I agree with you to be honest. That's any sub really though.
---
on xbox live, it was typically difficult to play for any extended session without getting either a disconnect or a hard crash anytime in about the first three months, at least. To the point where a lot of quests were pretty hard to finish because you just couldn't play the game that long without dropping from the server.
---
I played the game for the initial month, left for 2 months, came back and haven’t stopped playing. Different for everyone give it a shot
---
That’s totally something Chad would say
---
It would be even cooler if they actually ran a live 24 hour radio show. Have different hosts during the day and they can have pre recorded segments too.
---
Wat? Esplain yourself.
---
They are right. I did 3 rounds solo. The longest I lasted was 8 1/2 minutes.
---
Hes the most one note and boring of the 3 hosts we have had. Fitting that he is just an AI
---
U can take vault suit off
---
I have it the complete opposite. It's like everyone's mic is 30ft into their mouth.
---
I have a buddy on PSN who would be willing to attach a bayonet to anyone's The Dragon for 250 caps. Just send him a Buddy Request and mention The Dragon @ ARMBAND7 :)
---
Sneak is broken....... again!!!
---
It will only let me equip one atomic shop item... Either hat or outfit...?
---
Thought I was going to hate it can't stop playing it
---
Not really that i know of
---
It's just the tip from BGS.  
---
1 week now and then wait until the fall for the full release. They won't be gentle.
---
Same here. Gun Fu is pretty much core to my build too. Guess I won't be playing until this gets fixed.
---
As soon as I read the patch notes that said they fixed it so you instantly exit VATS after a kill, I thought to myself..."wonder if that will break Gun Fu??"....surprise!
---
It dies pretty quickly with three people
---
They're player icons.
---
"Vault Dwellers hate him!"
---
It's been smooth for me so far but I did witness a team mate fall through the map twice and get downed for no reason just past the creak north west of the vault tec agricultural place.
---
Um, it's super easy to kill, so not sure if that's gonna happen.
---
I totally get where you're coming from. With 400 hours or so in the game total, I can assure you there are more encounters ahead that will likely leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, but those will mostly be caused by equipment, more so than player skill. The variety of situational PvP combat can however also on occassions make for amazing experiences, and I hope you'll have more of those moving forward :)
---
I think, I read if you end up buying the game your progress is carried over.
---
No, but you can enter the overseers office once you reach level 10
---
area chat is frustrating -- happens to me all the time, too.  It gets back to normal once chatting via console or when on a team (usually).
---
The thing that kills me every time when I log in after being gone a while is that the game engine is decade-old tech and it shows.  I dare them to fix that.
---
Charlie bugged on me saying the code was invalid. Jumped servers, ran it all again, same thing. Tried Bravo and same thing. Just launched a nuke from Alpha couple hours ago and worked fine.
---
Not really. I suppose you can keep an eye on the 3 missile silo sites, see if anyone is there getting ready to launch. Usually takes 20-30min. But that won't guarantee an SBQ event. They might just launch on whitesprings or somewhere else.
---
Your best bet is to you post on subreddits, see if you can join in on other launching the nuke.
---
Not enough budget I'm afraid. I asked.
---
Just gotta roll with it. I’ve met some pretty awful people and a few pretty cool ones. Let’s just hope that you don’t turn into them when you get better gear and levels. I know I try to be the opposite.
---
But still you will face some 4 people squads, and you know. rip bro. 
---
But yeah. I think we need dynamic spawns, not just "random fixed spawns"
---
With the game beta we kept rank, hopefully here too
---
Can you... clarify?  Where does it say what icon I won?  Is it a "crate" I select and open in a menu somewhere? Or are icons just dropping in?
---
We kept our beta progress from the actual Fallout 76 Beta, hopefully its the same with Nuclear winter
---
Yeah please!
---
Me and the wife play together most of the time now.
---
To start with I was playing solo so done a lot of levelling up and completing the story prior to the wife starting her new character as a team. It allowed me to be able to help her get through some trickier aspects of the stories.
---
When it comes to XP, you actually share this. When we were both doing the same thing I got XP when the wife done it and when I done it, same with getting extra caps as well.
---
As others have said, loot is individual and it’s helpful for swapping ammo since I use shotgun shells and she used 10mm and .45s.
---
Now we have both competed the main mission we just wander around off the beaten path taking down things and exploring.
---
Nah, you're misunderstanding what happened. Most if not all of the critique the game got was warranted (the content of the critique, not the sheer volume of it). There were some outliers that made shit up, but for the most part everyone that was hating on the game made fair points and no one was blowing anything out of proportion. What was out of proportion was how many people were trashing the game. And why that happened, well, the state of the game was so trash and so many people got it that there was a large and easy to obtain audience of upset people that youtubers, understandably, tapped into. Nothing more, nothing less. Just youtubers and journalists looking for easy views and clicks. 
---
TL;DR: The game was in a garbage state at release, the majority of people were mad about that, not about what kind of game it was.
---
Everybody is saying not to fill team but I think your saying everyman for himself? I that what you are meaning?
---
I find it nice at  the moment to go in there to not be punched by everyone.
---
Any sign of the hellfire armor?
---
First you need to go to ur social menu. Add your wife to ur group that way if ur the party leader you go and do your missions and she can see all the quests u are doing,  She can even hear everything u hear when you completing missions or side quests. Yous can even do your stuff then u can promote her to be party leader then you can go do all the quests or missions she wants to do. Hell go do the same quests you just did. Ah what else, so if both of you get a shot on an enemie, you both get the loot and exp. When looting containers or lockers you will both get loot from it. It's only physical things you see in the open only 1 of you can get but it does regenerate! When building your wifes C.A.M.P if ur in a party you too can build at her place using your own materials. Works great if u have a plan she doesn't. If ur wanting to all ways team up yous some special points to a team card so if ur using a stim she will get some aswell from the team bonus etc. Heaps of other stuff I prob didn't mention.
---
I laughed my ass off when he said that because I was like, “Who stuck around? Maybe a total of 10K Bethesda fanboys but that’s it.”
---
You can always launch them yourself...
---
Yeah it's a little rough around the edges haha.
---
versus everything else requiring 9 for the same damage increase?
---
Take of your clothes and start doing heart emojies, works every time lol
---
Just curious, but why don't you like the crossover?  Personally I like it, just wondering what the counterpoint is.
---
Class freak?
---
We can use mutations in there?
---
Dude, I hate BR...but I loved this, it's balanced out well and they did a great job of keeping it completely separate from the main game.
---
How does it work? New cbaracter that you xfer the bonus to, or a 76r that participates and you get boost from finiahing?
---
Also, how foes it start equal?
---
On vacation for 2 more days...
---
You act as if the haters didn't have substance to their arguments in the early days. Nor are you acknowledging the fact that they could slip right back into their old bad habits.
---
It's truly great things have drastically improved but that doesn't change how it started.
---
Tell me, have they removed all non-cosmetic items from the Atom shop or did you guys just let it blow over that they broke their promise?
---
So I’m still unclear what happens if you bring a higher level character to NW 
---
Do all the belongings go into the void while your are in NW, and come back when you return ?
---
Seeing as you have about the same bedtime as me haha, I'd be down to join up with you. I'll most likely only be playing a few rounds every day when I get home from work around 3 pm EDT, if you're playing around the same time let's team up.
---
PSN: justseeker623
---
Your friend can find at the same place if they server hope around without you in the group
---
The helmet and suit are separate now you craft and equip them separately
---
I agree with you, but frankly his point isn't wholly wrong either. The spawn system, for example, is garbage for a multiplayer game. They've really made nukes nearly worthless simply due to the spawn system. That being said, this is still a problem due to the business depts and heads of bethesda pushing the dev team to release the game as soon as possible with as little testing as necessary so lots of things were overlooked that didn't work and fit a multiplayer game got through.
---
And stash boxes
---
I learned my lesson with other players -- I was incredibly naive for the first few weeks.  After my camp being destroyed a few times (150+ lvl players wasted their orbital strikes on my lowly level 15 shack), I moved my camp, stopped accepting ANY team invites from strangers, and turned my mic off.  I still use it on occasion to offer new players help, but I turned into a grumpy old person real quick.
---
It's just icons for the first few ranks.
---
Came across a couple of level 2's on PS4 earlier, dropped them some stimpacks and radaway, and some ammo that I was drowning in ( I don't use many guns) gave them a friendly salute before continuing on, its nice to see new players, even if it is because it is free to play this week.
---
I know it would not be timeline correct, but I would love Three Dog making announcements. It would be cool to hear “Do_Me_6388 just took down Warlord_632 at Big Fred’s BBQ for a lousy 12 caps...Watch out boys and girls”.
---
\&gt;Ritual Gas Mask  
---
I'll take your entire stock
---
\-------------------
---
Hate battle royals but I'm having a blast with this one...
---
No, they shouldn't.    
---
76 is the first Vault to open. Considering the number of people outside when the bombs dropped, then 25  years is long enough for most people outside to die b/c of various reasons.    
---
I don't know how Wastelanders is going to start but all of a sudden, people are coming out of said Vault and who's left in this area might come out or people would travel there.    
---
Like any MMO when it first came out, I'm sure many reacted similarly. Players don't like this and that and want this and that. 76 can only get better over time....IF Howard and Co don't screw it up.
---
You sound like a cry baby
---
I fucking love it. First game on first game, shit was fun as hell. Even had fun the second game although my team got destroyed pretty quick in, still got 1 kill in
---
Im working on that smart ass!!!   Thanks for the input though
---
I look forward to hanging out gamer gal pal style!
---
This is my first time building in the area.... i was always chasing deposits, but then finally settled on a nice view
---
Yeah you can find mutation serum sometime and the usual 'rad give mutation'
---
But how do I know I get them? Do I open them? Which ones do I get?  It would be nice if Bethesda said this but I'm rank 5 with 2 wins no clear rewards. Even icons
---
Picture because it’s not... it’s not under stash boxes or atom shop
---
If you missed other updates you probably are having to download them now
---
I think they made all schematics available basically everywhere. Could be wrong
---
Well it's pvp without legendaries at least :3
---
I can’t see myself stopping for anything short of Starfield or ES6. I started at beta, more than got my money’s worth, and am so glad I didn’t listen to the negative press and cancel my preorder. I love this game - and this is coming from a lifelong fan who has played every iteration of the game all the way back to the PC days. 
---
Keep it up Bethesda
---
Maybe I can finally get my (apparently) bugged final trophy of reviving 20 players!
---
There can be only one!!!!!!!
---
Wake me up when we find vault 69.....
---
Heeeeyooo.
---
Yup. No love for Solo players.
---
it siad it leveled me up twice,but when i switched back to Advent, there wasn't anything.
---
Some of the terminals say lvl 51 or higher ! Ur not far off
---
Ditto.  My pistol character just got 3 more perk points, but I’m not sure the cost is worth it.
---
Weird, I always have to spend 20-30 seconds "WAITING FOR OTHER PLAYERS" before it puts me in the game, and I see everybody around me starting off at the same time
---
Maybe they can be a ghoul after 76 if you have mods
---
I also would like to know what the crates are
---
I dont care about promises and bugs man. I just play a game I find fun.
---
'Oh waaah,  but Mr . Todd  pinky pwomised!'
---
Same here, it seems like the new vats kill animation is working TOO well.
---
Ditto
---
Yeah you'll lose a portion of all aid you are carrying. Stuff in your stash is safe though.
---
Story's not done yet. So, I tear down all the walls for 2 levels on that side of my building, including having to store my fusion generator so nothing is powered from my lights to my water purifiers to my resource extractors. Give my wild friend plenty of room to get out. I decide to take a run to Grafton in case my friend was a bit shy in coming out while i was there. Potter around, knock over the Grafton monster and a few Muties and come home. 
---
Good News! My Animal Friend came out. 
---
Bad News. I was left having to repair all the bits i had to take out of home. 
---
Worse News? I knew my Wild Friend had come out because, out of all of this effort, sombody must have shot and killed it. So i come home to a see through house, and a dead animal! 😐
---
Or did u see ur overseer level go up
---
Seems like no one remembered the ESO launch.  I waited 4 months to get this and rarely had issues.
---
So any recommendations for a good ps4 compatible headset?
---
For the meantime I have just switched in enforcer and blew the dust off my combat shotty in hope that it will fixed quickly so I can go back to my handmade.
---
Not redownloading this mess for a battls royale mode
---
Do you have a volume control on your headset? Sometimes mine accidentally gets turned down that way.
---
“We never expected this game to receive good metacritic ratings.”  Are you saying that this is the same basically as saying that it was  “a broken or unfinished game?”
---
When people have sentinel I don't know why I'd bother until I have a set
---
Is it just me or should nuclear winter be a free for all and have no teams? Just my two cents on the matter is that BR mode is meant for the last one standing. Not 1 on 4 when theres only 5 people left.
---
Won't let me chose my bandana and goggles
---
But what about the human scorched ? I'm curious to see if they'll be replaced by raiders or some other hostile humans
---
Like on the cord? It's at max. Again, it's just the voice
---
Were you on a team? If so, yuppers, totes a glitch.

Are you still crying?
---
Anyone on PS4 care to team up and knock this out? That'd be awesome. Let me know.
---
Yea all plans you can build aside from basic walls are found in the mode itself
---
Oh Great, they're retconning all the fucking lore now.
---
Huh, i had the opposite experienced. On ps4, iv played about 4-5 matches so far all with random fill and each one had at least 1 person on a mic, one we all had mics and we actually won the match too. I kno 5 is a small sample size but maybe its the community.
---
I friend told me
---
Wasnt expecting to find Elite here.. Greetings Cmdr
---
They have been sperated for quite awhile, I was rocking it on Xbox without the helmet, I wish the neck part went with the helmet as well but it's still pretty decent.
---
That last idea is nuts. That would be heavy, man. That’s really original.
---
One is an emblem and another is a skin for the stash
---
I can say one thing about Bethesda 
---
It aint EA
---
Ty ty ty
---
Is it a good idea or too much?
---
And that the gamemode is being played by people not just attracted to FPS games, which is kinda the main draw for most BR games.
---
I stopped playing because I hate doing quests and having a ton of fun then just getting stuck I a quest because I can’t kill level 60 ghouls at level 23. I wish they would get rid of the whole level system or upgrade the damage on weapons so I can have at least a little fight.
---
Having the same issue here. My partner and I play on PS4
---
No, no it’s good. Really good
---
Yup. Like u/Aexens said, you can find serums in containers, and you can get them the old fashioned way by irradiating yourself.  The second round I played I got a combat sniper rifle, and a couple minutes later I took too many rads and got chameleon. That made shit significantly easier into I got down to me vs couple of full squads.
---
145 here. Went into a silo with an ad hoc team once, got as far as the biometric ID card and someone else launched from a different silo so we all bailed to go to that nuke zone instead.
---
Pretty sure the "stash" unlocked at level 5 overseer is a CAMP stash skin :)
---
Not yet, not sure if there ever will be. Bethesda setup a new reddit though r/Vault51 for people Looking For Groups doing all things pew pew stab stab.
---
It’s very frustrating that everyone who looked at that list of combat enhancements last week said ‘how will this affect gun fu’ and not a single programmer at Bethesda bothered to follow up or even test it. I’ve defended this game since day one but it seems no one learns or even tries to improve the workflow at Bethesda. It seems the attitude is ‘who cares if something breaks. We’ll let them whine for a month, roll out a patch and then we’ll look like heroes.’ I’m so tired of it. We still can’t complete the possum badges that were rolled out a month ago. It’s obvious that not a single sole at Bethesda bothered to see if they were even earnable. The lack of quality control and testing is astonishing for a AAA game company. 
---
We were starting to get to a place where it looked like a corner was turned in the development, but here we are. Yes, this is a very trivial bug in the grand scheme but it’s a symptom of a much larger, systematic problem. This change was an absolute no-brainer that they should’ve tested it with gun fu. Not some obscure bug that would only happen in an extremely rare case. 
---
I was going to start dropping money on atoms to show support but not now. Not until there’s some fundamental development change at the studio.
---
First and only time I tried this mode I landed, got chased up some steps by a guy that instantly had a gun a the start. As I was running from that guy I got ambushed by a dude with a sword, I jumped of the building to escape and got shot in the back. Fucking terribly boring, nothing I could do the very MOMENT I set foot in the mode.
---
I think a fair amount of people stuck around and a lot of new people began playing to an extent.  Let me put it this way, (and you have to see the humor in this), I saw them put out numbers on how many sheepsquatch were killed in the wild Appalachia update, and it was well over a million which surprised me.  I think it was close to 2 but don’t quote me. I just remember it was surprisingly high.  And I thought, either a lot more people are playing or...like...I am the worst sheepsquatch killer in all of Fallout 76! Lol
---
I am not at all interested in Survival - I spend 100% of my time in Adventure. I didn't think I would care for NW, but it's not too bad. Even though I haven't lasted into the final eight even once - I don't think I've even had a PK. A couple of times I couldn't even find a weapon, so it was a bit of a shit storm. But it was enjoyable and not instant slaughter like the last BR type games I've played, even when players were put in the same place as the opposition.
---
Is this cross-platform play or am I only playing with other PC players? Also, is the ultimate plan to use different parts of the map? Four or five times, the final battle ended up in the same area at the end of the bridge, and I could see it getting old pretty easily. Having said that, the premise seems to be entertaining - I would see all kinds of games and situations where a forest fire could be encroaching in on a mission you had to complete, as a unique means to constrain the game space or the time limit.
---
I will probably play it again later tonight.
---
This was the first thing I thought of when hearing it too.
---
Why thank you. I always wanted to give ideas that could make it more challenging and fun. This would allow others to take on that role plus it could be an event that populated.
---
Same here
---
They are pretty good, but only for rare situations. When you get swarmed by more than two enemies, it really loses its value. It's a gimmick, but not a bad one.
---
You can usually find a few in the display cases at Philippi Battlefield Cemetery in the northeast part of the toxic valley
---
Right? Today was the first time I played with a radium rifle. It was a blast.
---
Could be but I didn't know you could do that. Cool
---
This alone would make me actually buy the game.
---
"Has no bearing"
---
The perk card system uses your existing special layout so anyone who is under level 50 is at a disadvantage even if it a small one
---
Skins for stuff in the other game mode
---
Thank you for the info, this was everything I wanted to know before trying the mode.
---
Is it capped at 10 for this week?
---
What's the difference between the barrels type and the different ammo recipe's?
---
I wish I could buy these skins :( unfortunately I started playing a week after the War rider skin was on on sale and that was the one I wanted the most :(
---
I came here to more or less say this. I was really excited for the game and foolishly pre-ordered it. Bethesda games, specifically fallout and elder scrolls are the only things I pre-order because they were reliably awesome, but I was so unbelievably disappointed with fallout 76 not just at launch, but the barrage of fumbles that succeeded it's release. Poor business choices, anticonsumer practices, pathetic patches that caused more issues than solved, the entire reliance on pisspoor inventory management, etc. I just felt slapped in the face over and over and I stopped playing all together around New year's. 
---
I'm really happy that they've improved the game, but at the same time I felt so burned by the release that I don't think I can go back to it, regardless of how good it's gotten. It's just left such a sour taste in my mouth that won't go away.
---
I've had a few of those rounds too. They happen. Eskridge when you don't know where prone spawn until right before the game loads. I've been killed wire a few times before I could even find a gun, lol.
---
So, out of curiosity, how were you being greifed? Did they not actually intend to use the workshop, and were just farming you for caps? If they took it and used it, i dont really see that as greifing. I take workshops from people all the time, because i need the resources.
---
Captain: What happen?
---
Operator: Sombody set up us the bomb!
---
If ya see me, well holla

Ive been enjoying the game since launch and if I see you out there I'll drop you some ammo and stuff.
---
And while I appreciate him taking ownership of the issues the game had, Todd didn't technically apologize.
---
Pc here, verify your cache. I do not crash anymore since doing that.
---
Ok, if you go back to adventure and check your build menu you can place the stash box. And the icons are unlocked in the atom shop menu.
---
You read the blog? Pretty hateful words in there.
---
Proof or gtfo with the unsubstantiated claims guy.

I’ve seen a 12
---
For real I got so attached to my 3* armor and 3* weapons that I wouldn’t dare shoot 10mm or use a combat rifle. I was never perked for shotguns, but now when I find one I have a blast in this game mod. I’m glad they leveled the playing field for now until everyone unlocks the good perks, which IMO they shouldn’t even have any for total fairness but it’s still a great game mode.
---
Actually...just like this past fans, haha. I did admit 30 seconds in!
---
Where can we open them?
---
I was going to say your dignity.
---
I heard there will be some sort of prestige system coming into place so old players will may be doing everything again  and wastelanders is an add on to the base game?
---
Then you missed some stuff at lvl 6 there's a tape you can listen to. It's behind the stage decor on the left 😉
---
It’s here for possibly only 1 week, so I’m going to focus on BR more just in case it disappears
---
Ok so you can check the icons in the atomstore menu and the stash box is unlocked in the build menu in adventure. If your past level 5 at least
---
I didn't realize they added the NPCs in, I am surprised they can post on reddit tho

Hoes mad.

My BE BP rifle does 1100 base damage. That's 5k with sneak/crit shot. It's no joke.
---
Fast travel to Harpers Ferry. Ryn straught ahead, and there are two display cases inside the small building to your left. There is a BP rifle, a BP pistol, a tomahawk, and .50 ball ammo in the display cases.
---
For most enemies, yeah. Black powder weapons are worth using. I like the pistols, the reload speed is worth the lower damage, I think. 
---
I agree, the sound is very satisfying. Head over to Harper's Ferry and get yourself a dragon, love those. Eventually, look for instigating black powder weapons, that really makes them worthwhile.
---

I found Nukashune by accident, drank it, and ended up at a ledge place

Only usable against npcs i heard
---
It may be your overseer rank that leveled up. Either way, you get caps and EXP for your adventure progress
---
This made me LOL.
---
Just make sure to worship something fun!
---
I did, it did not fix the issue. I was crashing every 15-30 minutes at one point, so yeah, I started looking around to see what I could do to fix it. While yes, it did reduce my crashing issue from near constant to about once an hour, I was still crashing like crazy.
---
Go into adventure mode and build a stash box, you will see the new ones you unlock. Then you start to unlock some cardboard cutouts and at level 10 you get the blue computer chair
---
I actually just saw someones Face was the same colors! JUST their face though! We were waiting in Vault 51. They were stoneddddd
---
Hey if it's stable there, maybe we can live with more than 24 people in all of Appalachia in Adventure mode...?
---
You can’t open the, they just look like boxes but the ones you are seeing at low lever at the stash box skins
---
You know, back about five years ago, I got a code to participate in the final beta weekend for ESO.  In the survey, I said it was a buggy mess that needs more testing.  Five weeks later, it released.  I had no interest in paying $60 (?) for it, so I uninstalled everything. 
---
Fast forward to last October, I buy FO76 on release.  Yup, it was a buggy mess, but there was no subscription and I love the Fallout universe more than Tamriel (but not by much to be honest), so I stuck with it and notice it improve over these past months.  I am impressed that they're working on making the game better and this mode looks like a blast. 
---
But the other day, I wondered about ESO.  I looked on Steam, saw it on sale for $10, so I bought it.  As an aside, holy shit that was a huge download.
---
So I was able to play it today after all the flipping updates.  Holy hell it plays like an entirely different game.  
---
This experience makes me excited to see what they do with 76 here.  If ESO's improvements over the last 5 years are anything to go by, this game has a damn bright future.
---
👍
---
Verify your game files, check any mods if you are using them, update the custom ini
---
Played one game so far. Was enjoying myself... till I fell thru the map... :(
---
I love how the next post on the power armor imigur link is two dogs getting it on in the back of a car hahaha
---
I’m pretty sure there actually is a terminal next to the one about X-02 that says lvl 101. Plus I’ve got a strong feeling that once you start getting past the barriers in the main area there will be even more to find deeper in the Vault with crazier requirements
---
I’m sorry to say this to y’all but all that bear stuff is way too adorable for me to ignore. I might have to... purchase... atoms.
---
Hows your connection?
---
no comment
---
This. This is what survival is ment to be. It wasnt ment to be just pvp. But that seems to be what most people think it is for. Yes it heavily weighted towards killing other players, but thats more of feature then its whole purpose of exsistance.
---
Team up in the social menu, then queue up for the game 👍
---
Its only atom store items. Favorite them to you in br
---
I have this problem also. The few times I have teamed with people I can't hear them. Also on ps4
---
After being party leader and playing a few rounds of Nuclear Winter I jumped back into adventure mode and now I can't trade with other players...
---
Go to fo76filthycasuals
---
Thanks
---
It's definitely not "fun", but I have to admit, it's a hell of a lot less terrible than I had ever expected. Its the closest thing to working pvp to be found in the game. With some balance passes and tweaks I could see it being a somewhat popular sidegame. It's not for me though, I played about 20 matches today, even won 2 of them somehow, doubt I'll be playing it much though.
---
I also want some NPC's inside the whitespring house
---
I cant work out how to do it..?
---
Not an issue.
---
I submitted a complaint thing and got it.
---
Thank you, your sentence tells me everything I need to know about your dumb personality
---
Omg yes
---
Someone who knew that slang definitely thought that I was old.
---
Fortnite 76 is actually good. I am just not sure the game will be balanced once a player Overseer level 100 will have optimal Perk cards.
---
Same! I hope it gets fixed soon . So frustrating without it :(
---
Oh yes ignore the fact that they released a broken game. Completely lied to their player base that coughed up money for the special edition. Consistently released patch after patch for the longest time that caused more problems than solving them. And then lied again when releasing non-cosmetic items into the in game store.
---
Yeah you totally don't sound like a shill ignoring all the glaring mistakes in favor of your aggressive fanaticism.
---
It's pretty fun to me, everyone's different though, right? Lol. I'll play this when I get bored of the main game, but yeah, it's dinette a "side piece" to everything the game has to offer.
---
Power armor is garbage actually, scout armor even seems superior. Likely because it's easier to hit someone in a tank. It only gives players like 30% less damage taken, since players drop in 1-2 second flat under fire, that means they live for 2.5 seconds instead.
---

But you can only hear the podcasts at specific radio beacons, right? Or am I missing something?

witty death screen comment
---
Well I tried to give away ammo and it’s worse than before.  They didn’t run away in fear they just ignored me entirely. Emotes did nothing. My mic is being used elsewhere at the moment so I couldn’t explain. Feelsbadman. Good on you though!!
---
It’s not bad, and certainly better than I expected. Having said that, I was still kinda bored after a few games. Your mileage may vary depending on how you feel about the BR genre, though, as I could take it or leave it.
---
So under lvl 5 players should have free rain on stealing and greifing and never get wanted from it 
---
Ok good idea
---
Played about 10 games have found 1 nuke code once
---
You need 5 to launch a nuke
---
Very very unlikely to happen
---
I dont ignore them, I just dont give a fuck. I have always enjoyed the game, and that's all that matters to me.
---
But it says unlock items while playing or something like that with that PA standing next to it?
---
Take advantage of the free trial! IMO (and I’m biased, I love it) it’s absolutely worth buying.
---
But if you’re stuck on the fence the free trial is the best way to test the waters without losing out :)
---
Lol yours. Has to be a cudi budi.
---
If the left one don't get ya, then the right one will.
---
Kinda the same thing with WoW for a lot of people right now. Even if they turn things around Blizzard has burnt so many loyal fans they probably aren't ever going to fully recover.
---
Not sure. Maybe atoms? Then you buy them
---
Hence the “or nothing at all” comment in my post. ;)
---
I disagree, I think teams are what will make this mode work.  But this is the first day of the trial period.  I am sure there will be other options besides quad teams when it actually launches.

Same issue for me. I have tried several times, both in the same game instance and after logging out &amp; back into the game. I've tried initiating the quest from the terminal and by interacting with Pompy directly; neither work. The last time I completed it was last night, so that makes me think something in patch 10 broke the quest.
---
Same here, I was able to complete Biv and Treadly, but Pompey keeps repeating what he says, even the initial chat when he starts the quest runs through, but still no quest. I've logged, hopped servers. Nothing.
---
Do we open them?
---
If so where
---
Thank you I will try it out :)
---
Nope. You’ve got to consume the plan to craft it, however once you’ve consumed it once it will flag as “(Known) Heavy Combat Armor Legs” next time it’s in your inventory :)
---
As long as it says (known) next to a plan that means you can drop it. The original, or first time you see the plan, is consumed when you learn it, clearing from your inventory.
---
if its already learned, (says "known" before the plan), then yes, it can be crafted.
---
It appeared to be a frosted glass bottle, but ended up being a plastic shell
---
Infinite health, it's just a punching bag
---
Once you learn it it disappears, the extra ones will say known beside it so you can sell it
---
This was 6 hours ago. You’re too late for a witty remark.
---
Yep..melee builds are so screwed. I miss VATS in PVP, but this mode is fun as hell! Just need to get on a team that will actually stick/work together!
---
So after you consume it, then drop the plan, you can still craft it?
---
Probably more than once. Two times?
---
I shall inform my local government official immediately.

Haven't played since I beat the queen at launch, would you recommend restarting or picking up where I left off for Wild Appalachia + Nuclear winter?
---
Hey debby downer
---
Did you kill all the beasties? 8 think  even if you defeat all other players if there's still a beast inside the safe zone you need to kill it.  I was with a teammate and we we're the last ones standing but we only got the winning announcement once we killed 2 mirelucks that where in the safe zone with us
---
Im a level 17. Will i be able to compete?
---
If not being able to remove is the case at least(because i just noticed this) have the option to go into solo BR or team BR after you press fill team on or off. I think it would make it a hell of alot more fun if everyone in one lobby was solo or team not mixed.
---
Yes. When you enter nuclear winter, you start with nothing but the Vault suit on your back.
---
Same here. What an annoyance.
---
I love it. Cant wait for full release
---
Thank you all. You’d think that by level 106 I would know this. 🤦‍♂️
---
isn't the musket just the laser core with some wacky lever that overcharges the microcells? i mean... you don't need enclave productions machines to tinker that, just some curious mind trying to hurt people with lesser resources xd
---
I jumped back in maybe a month or two ago and am 4 levels away from being able to use everything I find, and I'm glad I came back. With the free week and the deep discounts, you'd be pretty silly to miss out. Especially if you can gather some friends (or an especially inept group of home invaders).
---
I got super salty just now when I spawned in to a hunter mirelurk that killed me and the guy who spawned in with me was too busy pulling his pud to finish it off and res me!
---
...maybe they didn’t have a stimpack because we just started off...never mind haha, my fault for trying to slap a hunter mirelurk to death anyways.
---
No. I’m 11 right now.
---
I'm so envious of the journey that's ahead of them, remembering how terrifying the scorched were to me in early levels then finally getting the gear to bring down the scorchbeasts. So much fun!
---
They sold 20% of the PHYSICAL media of Fallout 4 in the UK. That is such a garbage statistic that means absolutely nothing all the naysayers needed a fig leaf to cover their hate. Everyone who was claiming it would fold by the new year or a black Friday sale meant the game had bombed.   
---
People were too emotionally invested in the game not being exactly the game pictures in their heads, I ended up having to explain to a make up artist that people really were mad at me for enjoying something I had bought for myself with my own money and they chose not to.
---
It’s fun, only issue I’ve run into is my weight is close, but still under 100, drains AP and gives the warning until I drop to about 70-80 then pick up again
---
No doubt about it
---
I am hoping (naively?) that they are slowly replacing parts of their engine.  My worry is that they are not and will never be able to increase server size considerably.  If we could put camps closer together and have 100+ person servers that you could join it would solve a lot of the problems with their 'we are the npcs' vision.   
---
Bringing in AI NPCs will help a lot but it would still be nice for them to be able to build what they actually wanted without engine restrictions.
---
Hey fanboy
---
Yeah I figured that out thanks tho
---
\#metoo
---
And you get it all back.   Hmmmm   Ok !!
---
How many dances do you start with?
---
I love that I can earn caps and xp for the Adventure Mode! I'm also using Nuclear Winter to grind the Field Medic trophy for the platinum.
---
Get it for maximum $25. I got mine for 20 on ebay.
---
It may be that option it for full release. Since this is a “sneak peak” whose to say that this is all their is? It may be possible that the mode will have team and solo. In any case, as long as we ask, it may come to fruition.
---
1 cloth to repair?
---
becoming wanted for the first time scared the crap out of me.  Had NO idea why I became wanted at the time.  Learned further on I'd picked a lock on a toolbox at an "owned" workshop...but had no idea what that meant at the time.  :P
---
I'm getting the impression that there is almost no correlation between your character's experiences in NW and Adventure. I took my level 148 one-and-only character in, didn't get any substantial advantages, and it had no effect on my stash/belongings when I logged back in to Adventure.
---
They do say that you get some Adventure mode XP and leveling as a result of playing NW, but I haven't really explored that yet. I've received notification 3x during NW that I have been leveled up in Adventure as a result, but I am definitely not level 151 (unless I have a bunch of level-ups stacked in the pip-boy and didn't notice it).
---
If you have a second plan and it says "known" you can drop the other copies you have and you can craft them still. 
---
If it dosent say "known" it means you haven't consumed it yet.
---
It's live?!
---
That's why I specifically said Nuclear Winter.
---
I enjoyed playing Nuclear Winter, but the loading times were infuriating.  I'd rather have the waiting room be the drop selection map and then go directly into the game.  I feel like it loads different portions of the game 3 excess times.
---
R/futurama
---
How do you play like that? Im a lefty and i just use wsad like everyone else lol.
---
Side note.. this is a good time to uncouple buttons like bash and nades. Wont happen but a man can dream.
---
They can't pick level 3 locks
---
Perks perks perks
---
How about you explain why it's not fun debby
---
Felt awkward a few times running past folks offering free shit and not realizing my mic wasn’t on when I say “thanks for the stuff but I have four other chars”. As I’m playing on a low level toon with a friend checking out the game.
---
So when you consume it the plan will disappear — you can then get it again through events, exploring and looting. It’s when you have that SECOND plan you can sell it or drop it for someone :)
---
Yeah except you couldn't launch it because the game deleted itself off your computer 
---
But if you for some reason don't want to count what was basically just an early launch as the launch, then yeah it went fine

Find some friends? I play this game with friends all the time so...find some as well?
---
Takes down scorchbeasts quick
---
While I agree on proof, F76 aimbots /are/ a real thing.
---
I know the frustration, but the reality is, Bethesda probably won’t get around to fixing it for a while. You just have to move your camp. That’s not the most satisfying answer, I know.
---
operation tourniquet was a success, just not in the way that they were hoping for...

Fanboys are going to kill your e rep with down votes.
---
I had a lot of disconnects during my 2 hours of playing today.  Usually once every few times I play -- today it was 3 times in 2 hours.   
---
I know nothing about servers, but maybe the game was not ready for the influx of players from "free week"?  Or the added game?
---
This is testing.
---
That’s my prep time. Level up, open perk cards, swap cards, play soccer .. I like it
---
Nice! I bought 50 rockets from a player cause... I dont know why. It looked cool in my PA. Now i can free up stash space in style!
---
Complaints will be met with lots of down votes.
---
Yep! Your Adventure/Survival mode Level, perks and gear are irrelevant in NW. Everyone has an equal playing field.
---
As of rn the only time to mess with your perk loadout and explore the unlockable areas of the vault is during this period so probably a little intentional. But ya it cud be shortened a bit.
---
Yep! Till the 17th!
---
Have you ever even played PUBG? I am an avid fan of both games and I would definitely say as a BR, PUBG is leaps and bounds better but Nuclear Winter is a lot of fun in a different way.
---
None of my friends play the game. And the majority play on PlayStation where i have an Xbox. Im a solo guy through and through too so I didnt even bother asking the ones who have xbox to get F76.
---
The headset isnt just beneficial for the voice chat, (although i agree that is invaluable if your teammates chat back). But the surround sound spacial awareness you get from a good headset is more important than ever.
---
Thanks! Where do you access it in game?
---
They  have definitely done testing before this and this is a consistent guaranteed issue. If they knew about why not have a known issues post somewhere. If they didn’t how did that happen? They’re called bugthesda for a reason and things like this need sorted.
---
Just wondering, with Nuclear Winter, can you join the game with a friend and be on the same team, or is it auto assigned random every time?
---
I'm glad it's getting some positive responses, or at least anything instead of just "DAE battle royale bad?"
---
Good to know that it actually wasn't the end of the world, the unending curse of Fallout, the death of a franchise, etc. etc.
---
Ask if people wanna play with u on here then, look for people 2 play with instead of asking for it 2 be a solo experience....
---
Because that's not what the OP asked. The answer to the original question is 'No'.
---
The skull is the number of players you personally killed, the eye is the number of slain players spectating you.
---
I think the system is just fine. Use pipe weapons and work ur way up. What's bad with that?
---
I see that
---
So i dont lose ammo/gear when playing?
---
I just abhor pipe weapons, and would prefer to use practically anything else.
---
there are a lot of Fickle Freds on this sub...but Im sure you already knew that.
---
i dont know if you ever played other battle royales but they have a circle that over the game closes in in order to funnel people together.
---
check your map from time to time to see it.
---
perk cards are accessed by opening the inventory(tab) then pressing t
---
Take advantage of the Free Trial going on until the 17th.
---
If you decide to buy it I'm sure it is on sale right now. I remember there being a 50% off sale.
---
GameStop also has it $30 new and $20 pre-owned as of right now.
---
I actually say buy it after the trial because not only is it cheaper now but is also leagues beyond what it was during the BETA and at release. New content has come along with a bunch of bug fixes.
---
It still has issues but nothing like how it was for those (me) who paid $60 and survived since BETA.
---
True, I used a pipe revolver till level 20. Way better than a 10mm.
---
God about time!
---
Lovely route if not too many people spawn in the with ya.
---
Ha yea I’m prepared for it. Would like to see some constructive feedback though.
---
I second that!  Frustrated is not the word I'm looking for. :-/
---
I just bought my deluxe edition from walmart for $21 with tax
---
Just as long as the game stays free for me....maybe a discount off the next FO game. 
---
Show us thanks.
---
How do I send nukes in br, ive gotten all codes but then what
---
I dont like pipe much but they have a place in the game
---
Pipe gun is usually the first gun you receive and there’s one right when you come out of the vault on the dead bodies there. 
---
By the time you go to the Overseers camp and then head to Flatwoods and finish the quests there you should be at least level 5 and it goes quick!! (Otherwise you’re doing it wrong). 
---
If you’re not farming Flatwoods and doing the Vaulttec Ag center quest which should start automatically... you’re missing out big time on a lot of scrap and xp building! 
---
Either way by the time you get done with the events in Flatwoods you should be at least lvl 5 if not higher.
---
Seems like it will be a DLC similar to fo4's -- you can't really get to it without going through at least some of the story.
---
Lol yeah that sucks. And you can revive a teammate without a stimpack, just takes longer
---
legitimate complaint about something he doesn't like is completely different from hate baiting and raging about how awful everything is. I don't like that power armor is useless in pvp but I still like 76 over all, peeps can have legitimate gripes man :P
---
You got the ban hammer!
---
Same bug
---
Nothing surprises me anymore with this game.
---
*Helloooooo Capital Wasteland, this is Three Daaawwwg Awooooo and we're coming to you live from our fortified bunker. What's a disc? Hell if I know, but I'm gonna keep talking anyway*
---
&gt; I’m glad they leveled the playing field for now until everyone unlocks the good perks, which IMO they shouldn’t even have any for total fairness but it’s still a great game mode.
---
From what I've seen, most of the perks involve reduced weight, reduced spread/increased range, etc. Not much that actually impacts damage. Sure, your shotgun has a tighter spread, but if you run around like a dumbass I'm still going to take you down.
---
I’m only referring to the revolver, the rest is crap.
---
correct
---
If you asked me if I wanted this mode I'd have said no. But now that it is here and I've played it I am really enjoying it and can see it is the answer for those who wish to fight each other.
---
I have some issues with the mode, when it's time to select spawn it should beep to let you know to look at screen if got bored waiting. I'd have liked the story behind it to have been that we're all raiders fighting each other instead. Chems feel pointless and too many.
---
Is vats not supposed to be a thing?
---
There should be a separate queue at the very least. Solo, duo, full team of 5.
---
I am using "Cloudy's Fallout 76 Mod Manager", and whatever it does, takes care of it. I just deselect mods and save and go into NW.
---
i think you have equipped the only cards they give you to begin.. so don't worry about that. (quip them before the game, like regular mode)
---
circle on the map shows danger.. you can also tell in the top right, the dot is you, the yellow is safe, the red is.. well obvious  ;-)
---
we're all just playing and learning as we go *granted many have prior BR experience from other games.. part of the charm of fallout, no  :-)
---
I am trying to farm as little as possible and just make my way around exploring,but at my current rate, it'll get far grindier than I would like far too quickly.
---
You have to kill the scorchbeast?
---
I'm like you but as far as battle royals go I would recommend Apex it's the easiest to get into and being f2p helps a lot if you end up not liking it.
---
Everyone is equal, there's no buffs to levels as you don't have all your perks
---
I already got downvoted
---
Are you supposed to leave the match once you die? Or wait it out ?
---
OMG........
---
Mmmm
---
In my experience, she flys away as soon as someone throws one. So no savage ya dive yo get buy it, and everyone kisses out on the opportunity for the melee guys to knock her heath down.
---
I submitted a ticket but not sure if it went through so will double check on that.
---
You have to immerse yourself in the game. You get out of it what you put into it. I am not really seeing where the game has gotten a lot of hype. But the game IS a lot better and has come a long way since launch. At least for me.
---
Nope, i will once i get a chance. Any tips before i jump in? I dont wanna look like a high lvl noob tagging everyone i see on sight.
---
Dodging the question? Guess ur Debby Dodger now
---
17 bucks on amazon. That’s a steel.
---
Yeah it’s part of a bundle that’s $10
---
Other than water what would they steal? Sorry but there’s tons of veggies out there to farm without having them at your camp.
---
Lock the water up with lvl 3 if need be...
---
Should be?  Maybe.  But for the most part, I'm seeing Level 2-4s at Flatwoods.
---
It is kind of interesting to see how the flow of little yellow dots emerge from the Vault and where they tend to go.  You can easily distinguish the "explorers" from the "follow the waypoints" crowd.
---
I’m assuming since it’s under armor that it’s not allowed. I can’t remember if it has any base stats before it’s treated. If it doesn’t have any, seems like I should be allowed.
---
Not only do i not have q Microphone due to my dog destroying mine, I find it way more fun to be alone through the wasteland. As well why couldnt they incorporate 1 game mode strictly solo style experience? The whole game is based around teaming up or having alot of people on the server join the event you created (SBQ, Sheepsquatch event, etc) and is primarily team based. Why couldnt they add a solo style game mode? Even then why not have solo and team options?  Just questions i have based on your responses.
---
It was brought up(going off my last sentence above) that it is still day 1 and its possible to seperate the two, but idk, i felt it couldve been thought out a bit more before launching the trial.
---
Agreed.
---
I was just pointing out that complaining about anything legitimate or not will get you down votes.
---
Oh.... you're a sneak build and you are complaining because sneak detection got screwed up again?.......down vote.
---
Oh you don't like the new game mode.......down vote.
---
Fanboys here are down vote trigger happy and usually are accompanied by a group of fanboys verbally assaulting you.
---
I think the game mechanic of a fire shrinking the game world in both terms of closing the play area and making it time-limited is a great idea. I watched a team member lose track of how close the fire was getting, earlier today, and tried to sprint up the hill from the Flatwoods motel northeastwards but the fire overran him. Realistically it should have killed him, but somehow he managed to survive and run past the flaming front again when the fire stopped contracting. Anybody able to tell us how long you have to be past the flame front ("outside") for you to die?
---
Love how you delete your previous posts and scurry away when I ask for some proof of your accusations. Thanks for confirming for me that you were just trolling like I assumed.
---
I have had it happen a bunch. You could pack up your camp move the camp 3 feet to the left and then rebuild at all hopefully without the glitches time. That’s all I have fixed it.
---
Are people now complaining about the addition of humans.
---
i still haven't bought it. Still waiting for it to be 20 bucks.  And apparently its still broken.  So I'm glad I didn't buy it yet.
---
It's a battle royale for sure. I joined and was put on a team with 3 randos with no mics. 1 left as it started, 1 died if the fire when the map shrunk, and I got killed from behind before I could turn around while my last teammate ran away.
---
I don't like battle royale's so I'm probably biased...
---
Your all good man the more people who help the better 🙌👌👌👍
---
goddamnit of course its paid content
---
With the right perk cards (vats) plus weapon who needs a aimbot??
---
No under armors, only outfits. I know right...
---
Only issue I have with it is that it takes too long to load.
---
They shouldn't remove them, but they shuttle add a silo mode for people who want strict 1v51 play.
---
Personally, play solo and I love taking down teams and watching them freak out as their teammates start dropping like flies.
---
You aren't too bright are you?
---
I answered your question. Try rephrasing it.
---
Newsflash, dont use the fucking radio if you dont like it!
---
Take your time. Immerse yourself. There’s plenty to do at all levels. No need to rush the endgame.
---
The eyes mean that’s how many people are currently spectating. And that nuke is absolutely insane!
---
Maybe I've been too optimistic and trusting of Bethesda, but I always thought we would get human NPCs eventually. I felt like they always said we would be the "first" humans to emerge into the wasteland, not the "only ones to ever" emerge. I guess I always assumed an expansion or something would open a vault and more humans would pour out, or the BoS or Enclave would invade and show up (before I discovered their fates in Appalachia). Still, glad to see it and how excited everyone is about it.
---
Ah, you don't want to work for the God tier weapons then? Millennial? Got to put in the work to progress in this game pal. Sorry if you feel it takes too long to get advanced in levels. Head directly East from 76, keep walking until you reach The Mire. Should be enough high level beasts that you can attempt to kill and get mucho xp. Granted you might die a heck of a lot there, but you've short circuited the whole level progression and annoying gaining better weapons routine in one swoop.
---
Or just grind the game like the rest of us have already done.
---
Welcome to the wasteland, vault dweller.
---
Well it also comes with 1500 atoms and 6 repair kits, still think the coat she be sold in the atomic shop
---
I like games where there's nothing to do but shoot other guys, I just don't see why I need a game other than tf2 to scratch that itch.
---
Yep. They need to be spread out more. I figured I would post this to try to bring it to the dev's attention.
---
I’ve heard some griping in game, but it seems most people I’ve talked to are waiting to see how it’s implemented.
---
Its not amazing. Its a carbon copy of every battle royale game ever made. 
---
The bonus? If you pick a bad starting point, you get to suffer through 3 minutes of tighty whiteys punching random people for no reason. 
---
Oh damn you looted a scoped revolver. Really scoped revolver? Well damn son, you best hope you can use it to snipe at 132 or else some naked broads gonna punch you to death.
---
when in the below level 15 range throwing knifes are OP by the way. take that pipe pistol and melt it down, make yourself a nice board for melee and throw knifes for ranged. you'll be one shooting everything from stealth and steel is easy to come by. once you leave the forest it will not be nearly as effective though so you'll have to get an actual weapon then. also go to  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fce4335&amp;d=s92sf2se2sg2ss2ej4eo2er2eh1c72l71lt2a42pp2pk2pl2pd2iq2ep0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=38cghfe9](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fce4335&amp;d=s92sf2se2sg2ss2ej4eo2er2eh1c72l71lt2a42pp2pk2pl2pd2iq2ep0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=38cghfe9) to avoid messing up your character and tinker with the perk cards. and consider  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the\_way\_of\_the\_green\_thumb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the_way_of_the_green_thumb/)  reading the guide I wrote thats especially usefull to brand new players.
---
Nah yea made it to being the last of 4 people and just got wrecked by the other 3 who ended up doing emotes to each other. Has happened 3 out of the 6 games ive played where I'm getting wrecked or assasinated by teams and i felt that it couldve been more thought out(even though my post doesnt state other wise i was just upset they didnt think of that)
---
Well there you go, literal proof people domt actually give a fuck about the games content, they just wanna hage on it.
---
Bruh, I just don't wanna grind for the bare minimum weapon since fallout 1
---
Fallouts combat mechanics aren’t meant for pvp, its being adapted to this system. Playing with other will help less skilled players be more comfortable with the mode (probably why it set to team as default). Starting off solo was done in survival and it was a mess that turned people away, not what you’d want from a marketing stand point when trying to entice new/returning players.
---
There are a lot of great charisma perks that benefit playing on a team. Start off with Inspirational and enjoy the XP boost :)
---
Ok. So are we supposed to leave match after we die , after our team is eliminated or wait it out till the end?
---
Wheres the bundle at? Atom shop?
---
Not all of us high level players are buttheads like the one you encountered.  It always takes a few knuckleheads to paint a negative picture of everyone trying to help others.  For that I'm truly sorry...
---
Is this your first time in fo76? Or do you have an existing character? Because I don’t know how much differently the new game mode works yet from the storyline. If this is your first time in the game you may need to get your feet wet in adventure mode to understand where everything is laid out before you dive into battle royale.
---
Confirmed broken here as well.
---
What improvements have you enjoyed the most so far?
---
Why can’t we have vats for PVP as well? I suck without it tbh.
---
Someone just called me a millennial and I have no idea if they are serious or not.
---
ya so did I It's busted
---
Quit dodging Debby. You know what I asked. You aren't too bright are you?
---
I keep a BPR on all my characters, including a vanilla Dragon and an explosive ghoul slayer Dragon.
---
I don't usually do battle royales. But this?
---
This is nice.
---
The nuka dark and bag should be held against Bethesda, not 76. The problem is most of the people who wanted the game cancelled don’t care if they’re unrelated. Those were legit complaints, but they aren’t legit when you blame the game itself.
---
This.
---
Depending on your level, there are different things you can do to postpone repair.  Makeshift Warrior and Gunsmith are obvious candidates for reducing wear on weapons.  White Knight eventually unlocks and does the same thing for armor.
---
To some extent, prior to Lv. 50 or White Knight, you want to scavenge armor rather than repair it.  You typically want to save repairs for Legendary pieces.
---
I guess... It does make sense. Just not for people who play solo but heres to hoping they incorporate a solo nuclear winter option after the trial period.
---
It's been kinda spotty for me since 9.5, I have to spam interact to get him or the other to acknowledge.
---
Going to the personal terminal first will get the quest your talking about to show up left hand of screen, the bug parts one hasn't been but will eventually register &amp; then complete (I tend to show up with bug parts on hand).
---
Uuuollolloloolllwwsu know that llllkmkk is the best game I’ve ever kkkl
---
I truly deeply love only a few things. And your idea is one of them.
---
I had one DC today.
---
They had been pretty rare for the past couple weeks.
---
You don't really gain anything from waiting to the end
---
Where’s the bundle at? Atom shop?
---
If you don't want to bother finding junk to fix your armor, weapons and exploring then maybe the new BR mode would fit you. It's all run and shoot with fallout them. I like it but I'm not sure how long it will last before I get burn out.
---
Been wondering about it too, it prompts NW stash received but not sure where to claim it
---
Main menu when you select play it’ll be the right most mode called nuclear winter
---
what are the new nuke codes this week
---
honestly probably nobodys gotten high enough overseer rank to unlock any of those things to make a list for every one else, I'm rank 8 overseer but I've already unlocked several new variants of the stash boxes through Nuclear winter, I'm guessing all the locked areas of the vault are the ranks where the nicer rewards are unlocked
---
It’s just a thought not gospel. I play solo myself but found it comforting to play with randoms. Played solo and got wrecked by another solo player. I know I suck at pvp.
---
As someone who HATES BR games, this is actually very encouraging to hear.
---
True dat
---
There are damage perks. I lucked into a semi-auto rifle +40% damage perk after a few games. Possibly a bit OP.
---
Very nice. Great success 👍👍
---
Then you could just wear a radiation suit/power armor and be fine. That would make the ring pointless.
---
Scorch beasts are carriers, they are not impacted by the condition. Just look at their skin compared to other scorched enemies as evidence. It’s probably based on how bats have traditionally been carriers of a variety of fungi/diseases.
---
What's with the nuclear winter power armor sets? Are there two separate sets, one with superheated reabar rods and one with just the regular rods? Or does the headlamp cause the rods to glow? Or is the superheated rod version exclusive to the new BR mode? There was a statue that talked about exclusive rewards in the hub of V51 with the superheated rod version along with the crusader welding helmet
---
Also, did you just call me a millennial? That is honestly one of the oddest insults I've ever received.
---
They dont have a track record of making great games. They have a track record of making great stories that they stick into janky ass games and until now everyone gave them a pass because the end experience was still passable.
---
Unless I’m mistaken, there’s no Radaway in the BR, right? So being in storm would mean you’re beyond fucked instead of just burning a bit.
---
That is brilliant.
---
I know what you asked...... indirectly. Work on your delivery so you sound less dickish when you deal with people in real life.
---
The answer is 'No' not everyone is liking the new mode. Some don't like Battle Royale period and many here play solo and don't enjoy having squads of 4 gang up on them.
---
Chode
---
It’s bonus damage for any explosive weapon vs. the rest is mandatory if you even want to consider competitive damage. 9 basic cards +5 to even consider explosive anything. I’m not saying it should be as strong as before but crippling your build by adding 5 extra points in a kill that will barely bump your damage to make a difference doesn’t end up worth it. At my level and build, if I were to invest 5 points into explosive, I’d either have near no defense or I would be taking away more damage than I’d be getting with explosive. I could see if it was a two or three star card with 50-75-100. But not five. If you have five points to toss around, you aren’t even close to finalizing your build.
---
Get some adequate armor, and a good handful of melee weapons. Kill everything in sight. Sell everything you don't need to the vendor bots at the railway stations. Check player vending machines for good deals for weapons. You'll actually have it easier than us level 200's
---
If you know he is still there, you still have access to the room. Which means you are still, technicly, cheating.
---
ya the game updated restart the launcher and sign in from there should fix it till next update
---
There is radaway in BR
---
I agree with you completely. They had three options:
---
1. abandon future development - think this can't happen? Ask Mass Effect: Andromeda fans about that.
---
2. Presume to be the smart ones - they could have said "this is the game we made, and if you dont like it dont play it.
---
3. reverse course - make SWEEPING core level structural changes to the design, the atmosphere, and the UI.
---
They could have selected any, and they selected #3 - the only option that put the players in the role of overseer.
---
Try removing everything that holds weight off of you and relog. That was what you had to do with invisible weight bugs in the past.
---
Sounds like the definitive Battle Royale experience! Or, per the norm. 😁
---
It does make sense though. im pretty good at PVP, ive just been getting wrecked by teams. First time i played this i made it to top 4 and just got demolished cause at that point it was 3v1. The other 2 times I was about to kill a guy, and got killed by 2 others shooting at me who then proceeded to pick their teammate up. I just had different expectations for what it was going to be than what it ended up being. Still enjoy it though. It just needs work.
---
Agreed. Have over 400 hours in PVE not a huge fan of Survival because of the broken aspects of builds. The BR is the perfect way to give us a balanced PVP game mode to play. 
---
I really couldnt have thought of a better way to tie in BR to the fallout world by making it a Vault Tec experiment. Super cool that instead of just looting a vault and reading terminals to get a story, We are the story. 
---
Havnt done much to progress through the vault, can anyone tell if there is more lore in terminals in the vault to tell us about the previous inhabitants? Or were there even any people in this vault?
---
ya its busted
---
It’s on the microsoft store for me, should be able to access it on whatever platform when on the main menu screen
---
Kind of. It's more like saying "I know it has problems and isn't our best work, but making a great game was never our goal." Or "Yeah it was a cash grab".
---
Either way a game company's primary goal should be to make good fun games and this would be reflected on rating sites and in reviews.
---
There's radaway, rad-x, hazmat suits, and power armor. Radium rifles are just as useless as in survival/adventure mode, too
---
There you go. Well it's in beta. So hopefully the uneven matching will be resolved.
---
Only major bug I've encountered so far is you can't select the turrets/walls quick kits without major lag(PS4).  I don't even bother after I tried a few times and died from hard lag every time.
---
At the very LEAST it's a great break from adventure mode. I played 3 rounds and it was fun. Having never played a battle royal style game before.
---
don't be such a ground baby
---
Is NMA still going? Last I visited was like ten years ago to download the fallout 2 megamod lol
---
I found an OP thing... get the 40% rifle damage card, and bloody mess card, and the scoped lever has 230 damage
---

This is the thing that pops up over everyones head, it is also by our names in party chat.
---
Its so you can visually see what type of armor the other player is wearing
---
ZeniMax...
---
Because the outfit goes over the armor normally. This way though others can see what tier armor you have. It would be a little unfair to not know what they have on.
---
Hahaha it's all just luck, I searched for the bot for the first time last week, 5th try I get it and it's got nothing good, so I don't buy anything. Server hop and load in, he's back again with the long coat 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
I agree it was a little forward to say it was better than PUBG
---
Newsflash chill the fuck out it was just an opinion.
---
I agree completely. And they could have easily just walked away from the game entirely and wrote it off as a failed effort (see: Mass Effect Andromeda).
---
But they went back to the design documents, and wrote edits and notes all over them. They deserve every fair criticism they got over the launch, but over the course of the past 12 months, and the immediate plans for year 2, I think it's only fair that we give credit where it's due: they listened to their fans, and made changes.
---
And not insignificant changes - the fundamental core of the game (no NPCs) is being tossed out for a new core fundamental. You can't do that and be arrogant at the same time. It requires a bit of humility.
---
I had one crash on PS4, but otherwise, it's been perfectly fine. No other crashes, frame issues, whatever. It's perfectly functional as far as my experience goes.
---
Gotta do the scout stuff
---
Thats exactly what some are but they're limited to the BR mode. For example theres one perk that allows you to lock pick anything and you don't need bobby pins.
---
I mean. They can just crank the rads such that they fry you evne through armor.
---
I recall lore from many of the games saying the world kept burning for weeks after the war ended. It makes sense. Not all nukes cause mass radiation.
---
Read the poster at the train station to start the quest. Look for the Boy Scout looking one.
---
Literally no contact after the 2nd or 3rd day. Not when the accounts where returned briefly, not when they where taken away again. Straight up nothing. I've lost count of the updates to the tickets ive sent.
---
Gameplays not improved. Theres been massive nerfs, new visual issues, the last patch caused enemies to slide on the ground attacking you. Survival mode now has camps that cant be destroyed for some reason. Theres been new features and stability improvement but the game is farming kills, crafting and collecting junk. Frankly if you dont have 3 star items they are junk anyways. Work on your perks, and save caps for player vending. BR is the only change to gameplay. Frankly though we dont need 3 game modes when the first ones still broke.
---
" my armor and weapons needed repair and ammo. I spent most of my time running around aimlessly killing things for junk and ammo" that's the personification of any open world survival game. finding the stuff is part of game. that's the challenge,  that's like complaining that you have to touch people when you're playing tag. I suspect you are trolling sir. good day o7
---
Is it me or am I actually weaker in power armor?
---
Patch notes said they adjusted budget for some stuff. I think neon signs and letters. 
---
So not broke. You're just over budget after the adjustments.
---
It might have been a baby boomer. They harbor a lot of anger towards millennials even though their generation sold millennials out.

You'll need to look at the Tadpole challenges under challenges &gt; world and complete 3 to unlock the standard backpack plan.

The challenges menu is located under the main menu in game or through the little weekly/daily thing on the map screen in the top right area.
---
I exclusively use revolvers when I am foraging. For high end quests  I do have to go with something bit punchier, but just roaming around looking for plastic, I love the double action. The sound it makes is so sexy.

I considered that and left it all in the church in flatwoods. Just want someone to have it. If not oh well I don’t need it lol

Mate, it's the first step to balanced PvP in 76. Not your preferred game mode? That's fine. I get that you wanna circlejerk the BR hate, but it seems like a fun PvP mode in a game that's starved for solid PvP.
---
Under challenges and the bottem group of challenges tadpole badge
---
I mean it's quick.
---
I don't like it, but it's quick.
---
Still pretty sure I'm doing it only as long as necessary to unlock the skins, plans, etc.
---
\&gt; If Fallout 76 came out as an alpha they could’ve avoided the backlash of selling a broken game 
---
No. No they wouldn't. Generally the second you charge money for access your game is "out". You can call it whatever you want, but if people have to pay to play and are able to do so without limits, your game is out and open for critique. An alpha tag may have helped but the game would have been taken to task regardless.
---
And I've got a Furious, SS, +1 Str Golf Club that wrecks house as well. Teams up perfectly with a Whitesprings Jumpsuit, Fishermans hat and a scoped hunting rifle. Perfect for hunting gophers 👍🏻
---
Is it me or am I actually weaker against players while I wear power armor?
---
BR’s are definitely not for everyone, but I wouldn’t give up just yet. They definitely take a little time to get better at. Try to find some people and team up, makes it a million times better when you have people to communicate and call out things with. If you decide not to, that’s your call obviously and hope you have fun regardless in the game.
---
If you figure it out let me know, and I’ll do the same.
---
I've yet to jump in, are the new perk cards that come with Nuclear Winter available through the game mode yet? Or will that be later, when the "full release" happens?
---
Your forgetting about the “quality premium content” that you spend an additional $50 on just to get a cooler looking ship skin.
---
It’s one of the more “involved” quests.  I’d grab a camera, and you’ll need a friend.
---
Have you read through this sub at all today?
---
It’s mainly for server stability, but your build limit does increase as you level up
---
invite them to a party til someone joins, game chat is terrible maybe they can't hear you
---
I was in your shoes bro, and at half price it’s a steal. Ive played older fallout games so I know what they’re capable of so I know this game will be great. Bought it yesterday then to find out they added  a br mode!  I’m at work wishing to be home so I could play lmao
---
Level 4
---
I just played for two hours before my nightshift at work and I really want to call in.
---
They are icons, like the avatar player photos. Super lame, I know. If only they were real items!😭
---
Also u gotta read the scouts poster at a train station
---
I did something similar to you OP, and left off with most of my time spent on resource management, which was only an end game chore in every other fallout game. When I came back to 76 a few months ago I simply deleted my old character and made a new one, which I’m much more invested in than my last one now at lvl 63.
---
I’ve been told that last part is false. Still have no confirmation either way though.
---
So its the opposite of standard/survival mode? Weird.
---
I’ve seen many 3 and 4 story homes. Not sure what your issue is there...
---
As for the limit, you’re building a camp...not a mansion
---
No trophies popped for me as I got out of the vault.  Which makes sense, I suppose.
---
Oof
---
I've been playing since launch. Level 242 now. After a long day of work I still very much enjoy hopping on a server for an hour. I'll never understand all the hate this game gets. I love it so fuck em.
---
Yeah they have topics on every f
---
You have to do many pioneer scout quests to get a backpack. It's a surprisingly long series of quests. Some of it's fun enough, but it's not quick and easy. The scout poster at train stations will get the quest started. Beyond that, if you need help, search the subreddit for tadpole scout quests.   
---
It's not something to try in your first day or week of the game.
---
If they are trying something new you would think they would actually want to make sure they did a good job. I know I certainly would. Not see the dumpster fire it was going to be, declaring "good enough", and charging full price for a game that is still unfinished. Also, if they were doing something completely new it seems like they should perhaps, you know, make a new game engine instead of using one that has been around since Oblivion. Pretty sad there have been more new consoles from Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo than new game engines from Bethesda. 
---
The fool admitted it was going to be bad. Not for a single second did he take that as a sign the game should be delayed. Instead they continually poured gasoline on that dumpster fire in some misguided attempt to put it out. They don't deserve sympathy for something they brought upon themselves.
---
But none of it was signs or letters.
---
Pay attention to the teams drop zone / placement and make sure you are near by.  
---
   
---
Turn on VC to atleast listen.   
---
Crouch and sprint allot, never in a straight line and for the love of all things holy don't get over encumbered
---
Yeah it has certainly improved quite a bit. I will say the other day I was very pissed off that I had finally collected a full T60 power armor set and while I was repairing and painting it, the right arm disappeared....
---
Normally i just got to hear rattle about still being a tadpole and the oldest one at that but the dialogue is nothing like usual
---
It’s huge for me that you get Adventure XP and caps. Makes it feel much more rewarding
---
Ive been a Bethesda fanboy since Daggerfall came out, and even I am willing to admit that this wasn't part of a plan. This was a concession to what the players insisted.
---
When is the full release?
---
Yeah searched all over can confirm player icons
---
Hopefully they will with Fallout traditionally being a single player title.
---
Many Debbie Downers got flamed for claiming that Fallout 76 was trying bro be Fortnite. I'll continue to be a realist and call things how I see them.....not really concerned about down votes on the internet.
---
So I'm not really into battle royals, I haven't found any that hooked me. The mode is fine. My only criticism so far is that there needs to be a way to edit your perks/appearance without joining a game. Also when in the lobby it's really annoying trying to read terminals or listen to holotapes while someone is punching you.
---
I just bought my first Python, there's dozens of us!
---
What if I want to be a level one raider?
---
The bundle is 13$ in cad
---
im sobbing i want this coat so badly
---
\#1 Find the Tourist so that you can get a camera. do those quests. Then #2 Read the scout poster at a train station, do the quests that pop up, and grind yer booty off.
---
I agree it'll get old quickly, but it's necessary for preparation. I think they just need to allow us to do more in the vault than read terminals and punch each other. I think making the slots functional, letting us drink at the bar, and maybe even a shooting range to practice your aim with certain weapons would all be great.
---
Is it me or am I actually weaker while wearing power armor in nuclear winter?
---
Figured it out, those are just skins for stash boxes lol for adventure mode
---
Started D2 over the weekend. I enjoy it and they want to go more RPG in September so that is a massive plus for me.
---
If it makes you feel better I was wondering too, so thanks lol
---
It doesn’t increase as you level up.
---
I cant speak to any platform but XB1...however, I have experienced this problem many times before and the only thing that fixed it was a hard restart of my console. Ive also had people in the area hear snippets of me when I was in team chat. The in game chat is pretty buggy unfortunately. Hopefully someone on PC can help you troubleshoot it.
---
People think it’s false because they will level up multiple times then return to their camp to build more but will find nothing has changed, the reason the increase of build limit seems like it’s so insignificant or non existent is because it only takes effect when you move your camp, ie - you are at max build limit, level up 20 levels, move your camp by finding a new location on the map, opening pip boy and placing camp, and now you are able to build a bit more
---
Not in Nuclear Winter (but he hasn't stated whether it was in NW or not).
---
calm down
---
A simple youtube search for "Fallout 76 Aimbot" returns dozens of results showing that aimbotting is very much possible in 76.
---
Are you really so clueless as to think it would be any different for the Nuclear Winter? Its the same game, with the same engine.
---
Oh. Welp. I’ll take it lol. I’ll assume that’s how you earn PA skins too
---
Boy that sub hates 76. Poor souls.
---
Know the feeling, when I first started it was a game of "make sure to tag that enemy so you get xp" and it feels as if the endgame is very much the same
---
well that is a giant bummer, at this point they should only be decreasing budget prices not increasing them for stuff that's already been in the game :(
---
Be in a team with them before starting
---
I dont doubt the overlap i  players, just wasnt expecting it. You a console or pc player? I recently helped a streamer go from python or so to anaconda in two sessions
---
Only crashed once after 3 hours
---
How fall out is now is how it should have been at release. In the beginning with the release it was clear as day that fallout 76 needed more time in the oven but it's beginning to be coming to a more playable state I'm looking forward to the settlers and raiders DLC I'm not a big fan of Battle Royale so I won't even bother with nuclear winter but that's fine as long as I get something in the fallout world I can do with.
---
Tons of people go to overseers
---
Yay, I was never gonna hack a computer 502 times in adventure mode (not sure if that's even the last of the hacking challenges)
---
LOL my RDR2 is still sealed and on my bookcase :) bought it at launch but FO76 was my go to back then and I never got around to it.
---
I swear I feel like I'm actually weaker while I wear PA in this new game mode
---
Have you tried, prior to start a game, turning the Music slider all the way down?
---
I used to get this thing where I'd hear a loud "pop" and the audio would go.  Seemed to happen most when I fast traveled to player CAMPs.  It hasn't happened since I disabled the music.  I have a theory that it has to do with the (still broken?) Appalachian/Classical Radios or the Jukeboxes.
---
Yep, I've tried auto, area, and team multiple times. Logged in and out multiple times. Checked my windows audio settings. Unplugged and replugged my headset....
---
I've been playing adventure mode for like 4 months and had a level 43 character but had to start over. Do you know if you have to stay all the way through a match? Because you get the xp and stuff right after you die
---
This is what it says. So either related to that, or maybe it is a bug? If you don't think it's because of this, I'd say open a case.
---
Billboards: The amount of C.A.M.P. and Workshop budget consumed by various neon billboards has been made more consistent.
---
While I love the idea of the world progressing based upon each character, I do worry about splitting the community. It's rarely a good thing for online games. Besides, Wastelanders may bring in people who aren't willing to go through the no-human-NPC base game.
---
The roadmap only states Summer 2019 for the time being.

---
Is that why people are invisible? Good information
---
Now now, we don't need to be like them and point fingers and call names. Just enjoy the games, that's what they don't want you to do.
---
Ive had the opposite experience with PA. I found some my second game, and then I got basically two hit by a sniper. Full t51, and I got two shot.
---
Lol vats has been bugged for like almost a month? Cant vats melee anything that flies
---
Lvl 11 is a weapon skin, revolver I think, and Lvl 12 is a cool statue
---
I thought those were bodies that got caught outside during the nuclear blast. Not petrified scorched
---
Well, in my experience they don’t, so I’ll change it to make it seem more like it’s just my experience than fact
---
I've noticed that the hidden indicator doesn't exist, so is sneaking even a thing you need to do
---
Reddit and the masses over reacted again as usual. Hating on shit before they even know exactly what it is. I’m glad people are enjoying it even after all the drama leading up to the launch
---
Yep. My assumption was that the complaint about taking too long to level up was coming from somebody that wasn't used to the long haul style of grinding away to affect a selection of small increases. And with Millennials being the most vocal about what they 'deserve to get' as opposed to 'working hard to get' it's hard not to consider a leveling complaint to be coming from a    youngster.
---
Rarely do animals die to their own venom/ poison.
---
Yea we had 3 friends in our team and 1 random last few games and it was so much better than when I was alone in a team of randoms, I really like the tactics you can come up with to bait other players when communicating which doesn't seem to happen with randoms on EU servers
---
Thank you. 
---
The reason I was asking is because I really like the new mood. And I'm already hooked after an hour of playing. I just wanted to know how long I would have to deal with withdrawals
---
Ahh! Nice! I bet that’s how you get PAs as well! Thanks!
---
I would be perfectly ok with new players missing out on empty WV, it kind of enriched the sense of change for people who first left the vault. In that regard it would be extra cool if new players came out of another vault as well.
---
I have been playing since the beta and have started to notice an overly positive trend in this sub, while a lot of the stuff they are adding is quite good and damn near impressive the game still has quite a few problems. Let's try to keep the negativity and positivity to reasonable levels, we definitely don't want this sub to become r/gameofthrones
---
The art of disguise! They slapped on “Year 2” to make it look like this was the plan all along when they know that the fucked up really bad so now they have to give the people what they want. I.E. NPC’s
---
That's a fair point.
---
They were returned and then removed again, weird as hell.  
---
     
---
Short of getting someone on the phone (pretty sure there is a number floating around) I don't have a clue.

Jesus, someone seems to be in denial over losing hours of their life.
---
Platform?
---
I sent you a friend request. I'm in Australia so times might be weird but happy to give it a try
---
But endgame!!!!!
---
LOL as a big FO76, The Division and Warframe player I can only smile everytime I see people complain about endgame and no content and whatever.
---
These type of games are meant to be played your way, you make your own fun and if that isn't your style or you are bored just play something else. No need to trash talk the game.
---
I can support that.
---
Spawn on the church in flatwoods. Always 3 containers, 3/4 games had an orange one. Can also hack the terminals (1*) and request a weapon
---
It’s already available... marine wet suit
---
That’s hardly fair. With how extravagant we can get even with the limits, I don’t exactly think the argument “it’s just a camp” is true.
---
You only have to use them in the beginning, that’s the point, they’re trash tier weapons scavengers cobbled together out of random parts. When you level up you’ll get better and better stuff
---
yep. mine changed a few times and then never finished downloading.
---
Hell yeah OP ✌️
---
I expected nothing, and was still let down.
---
I hate when people think fornite set the standard for battle royale. If anything it ruined it for good games like pubg
---
I would love if survival was like day z and add actual strategy to the game
---
Well shit, it didn't work anymore?
---
I don't really dislike the weapons in general, I dislike how they were copy-pasted straight from fo4 instead of having a bunch of new low tier guns.
---
Be in a team before you go into a game
---
my CAMP is 5 stories. level 300+ and yes my budget increases on level up without moving my CAMP. hope this helps 🙂
---
Definitely. Give people a taste of what they were so quick to bash and maybe they’ll change their minds.
---
it sux..spent half an hour so far trying to get in..it finds a world then i get server not responding...disconnected..4 times in a row now
---
Its fun. Why would we be mad?
---
That’s what I wanna know
---
As Todd said, maybe we should of given people who owned fallout 4 alpha/beta testing access before final/official release.
---
i was kinda curious about this too,i mostly play the game solo,so you can invite people while in the main menu?
---
I’m still waiting for my canvas bag
---
Right!
---
Could use some more free atoms though...
---
it would be good if i could get in.spent half an hour trying..it finds a world then i get server not responding..disconnectee..4 times in a row now
---
Everything balanced. I like it.
---
It is surprisingly fun. Been playing it all day. Only crashed once which might make it more stable than adventure. I also like that im leveling up and unlocking stuff in adventure mode at the same time.
---
Shush
---
There were multiple post before about how nobody wanted nuclear winter now y'all are just sitting there quiet😂😂😂
---
As all things should be
---
Yep, hold the player list button and you’ll see your friends list pop up
---
  I hate Battle Royales. It is a boring and repetitive gamemode.  
---
  With that said, I am actually enjoying it on Fo76, it is fast paced and has some cool gimmicks (monsters, fallout stuff like radiation, etc)  
---
    
---
  My only complaint so far is that ever since I came back to the game (I left before Push to Talk was a thing and came back yesterday), either no one uses the mic or no one knows how to set it up, which leaves me having to do Emotes to get the randomly assembled team  out of the fire storm. (Or is it a problem on my end?)
---
Yea just via the social tab — it was new to me too
---
Fair point, but even as someone who generally dislikes BR's it was enjoyable... 
---
Regardless here is to hoping Wastelanders is what we hope it could be and pushes '76 into the "green" for allot of people on the edge.
---
godammit
---
Gaming journalist should be launched into the sun
---
It is a great new feature, but as an RPG player I really want the exact OPPOSITE of this game mode. It is cool that they did this, but I really want a slower, community based, RPG experience that is challenging. With a real in-game economy!
---
Yea, especially with battle royale. I really didn’t think they needed to add a battle royale to fallout. Those games are stupid and it feels like they only added it because of how popular Fortnite and PUBG is. They should just stick with dlcs for the game.
---
Nope. It's mostly replaced by hiding in bushes. Fortunately it's squad-only so people aren't inclined to bush-camp unless they ran out of team-mates.
---
I like a little bit of BR some days and now I can do it in Fallout. I think it is a good thing, it will also give incentive to improve gun play in Fallout.
---
The gun play in Fallout isn't the greatest to me personally.
---
There are no new perk cards outside of nuclear winter if that is what you are asking, at least not for nuclear winter.
---
We’re playing it. I think the general opinion was that they wanted new content not game type. But its still fun
---
it looked like it was done, but it kept downloading and the progress bar never completely filled. i had it going for another hour, but there was no change. i ended up just canceling it and restarting the download.
---
Wow, that's some impressive mental gymnastic there.
---
Thank you. Just wanted to make sure !
---
I mean this is a survival game, scrounging for materials and bullets is like a core aspect of survival games
---
Wait how did u play it already?
---
You mean the gamemode or the Free-To-Play?
---
Oh man, that sucks especially since I have a limited bandwidth allowance.
---
It's not that hard, they just dredge up old shit and lie enough about it so people that don't play the game will think it's worse than it is.
---
I was watching one youtubers roundup of yesterdays E3 stuff and when they got to 76 they started off nice but eventually fell back on how no one can trust Bethesda to not fuck ultimately fuck their players over because they already "nerfed armor durability and forced people to buy repair kits for money"
---
I mean I'm happy, they did a good job. Doesn't mean I wouldn't have rather had wastelanders sooner though, gotta take what you get though I guess.
---
When it is done.
---

1st match.  Picked an out of the way spot, found several good crates, found some PA.  Tried to enter it, got put into a no action state, died to background radiation near the suit.
---
I miss my gloves too :c
---
Ohhhh ok so well just pretend it never happened got it
---
Or, in my case, I unloaded a radium rifle into a mans in PA
---
Tell that to my friend. Got a taste of it Day 1 and vowed to never reinstall. His opinions are iron; he could believe aliens weren’t real, watch a Martin fly down in a UFO and abduct everyone in his neighbourhood, and then still hold that belief that aliens don’t exist. 
---
He doesn’t change his opinion for ANYTHING, and it pisses me off because I’ve convinced almost all of my other friends to return to 76. He refuses to be proved wrong.
---
Give them nuka shine... wait, everyone else already recommended that.
---
Always had the same problem as well
---
We didn't sell anybody out fool! That's what politicians do!

Blackout had a few areas around the map with zombies, but blackout never really got that big, as far as I know
---
Haha solid as a rock

Who's to say we aren't the raiders?

Invite them to a team, fast travel to Cranberry Bog, tell them to follow, leave team.
---
Oh I haven’t heard this.

my internet is pretty slow so it took most of the day to do it. it seems to be going a little faster now than it did earlier which is good. i hope you have better luck than i did!
---
As others have said, start the tadpole missions by reading the poster at train stations. Be warned: Getting the backpack is a LOT of work, and may take you several hours to complete. You might wanna hold off on getting it for now until you level up a bit more. Have fun in the wasteland!
---
Thing is you need prepare you build regarding you play style. If you don't like the micromanagement then improve it with perks.
---
In order to level up and gear up my alts I use different strategies. In one I buy my gear every ten levels, is not cost effective but is fast. In other I game with level 20 armor, it is cheap to repair. In other I loot everything, then craft is cheap. In other I use power armor, repairs is practically non needed for armor, and can use whatever weapon is dropped.
---
The game has a lot of options, just choose a alternative. Loot is my favorite thing to do in order to have a zen experience, but sometimes I just wanna quest.
---
Said something along those lines during a recent interview.
---
mini pubg squads.. with NUKES!
---
 "Gameplays not improved. " Yes server stability is better and graphical glitches have been diminished. not eliminated but many have been fixed.
---
"Theres been massive nerfs," much needed balance changes regarding TSE I assume. it pissed me off because I just got my TSE gauss right before the nerf. it did however need to be nerfed. 
---
"new visual issues the last patch caused enemies to slide on the ground attacking you." that's not new its old they fixed it earlier and then broke it again lol. 
---
 "Survival mode now has camps that cant be destroyed for some reason." the reason being toxic griefing Aholes seal clubbing noobs - they also removed slap damage because said griefers.
---
"Theres been new features and stability improvement but the game is farming kills, crafting and collecting junk." agreed
---
" Frankly if you dont have 3 star items they are junk anyways." not to a brand new character leveling up.  that first onestar weap can be a real game changer.
---
"Work on your perks, and save caps for player vending. BR is the only change to game play. Frankly though we don't need 3 game modes when the first ones still broke" Agreed completely that shit gets on my nerves. its related to the 6 sigma LEAN philosophy embraced by many in the manufacturing industries and then by the cellphone industries and now game companies are doing it to.  essentially the process involves just "making a product" not a good one just something that doesn't count as fraud by selling it, then using the customer base as your QA department. I think we need to get some sort of law passed banning that shit. currently using the LEAN process has become the only financially viable method of survivability to any large corporation in certain feilds now. The only way to get companies to stop would be a law that forces everyone to the same Quality Assurance Level. Otherwise if one company is able to utilize the LEAN process the others would pretty much be forced to by stockholders in order to keep up.  
---
   I think any product that receives too many complaints and fails on to many levels at once should be subject to something like the lemon law in the auto industry.
---
   That being said considering the business landscape that bethesda finds itself currently inhabiting I do like the company as a whole and have faith in the long run. I don't think Todd Howard wanted any of what went down I just feel like reality sort of pushed their hand on it. like everyone elses.
---
It could have been anthem part 2 glad it’s not
---
Haven’t played a game yet, too busy trying to get my shop in working order. But I keep hearing good things about it, so I’ll try a game tomorrow after school
---
I literally just did this tonight, saw a level one at V76, and threw on my ritualistic cloths and mask and grabbed my cultist blade an waited crouched outside the vault. along with the bottle of Nukashine, I gave some ammo, a one star legendary level 15 double barrel shotgun and some plans.
---
They are stash boxes
---
Somebody awesome gave me a full set of pocketed leather armor and a .50 cal sniper rifle... and I spent a minute just standing there because I'd forgotten how to use emotes 😬
---
Thank you, Mysterious Stranger!
---
Sorry for the bad times bro. It did make things a little more tense on the server but I’ve not heard of this bad being widespread. Maybe check your internet or try a different time when others in your region may be offline?
---
&gt;People always complain about something
---
It's important to give props to the developers for improving the game, but don't pretend like they don't deserve any of the criticisms they got during launch.
---
Lol. You just made me and my co-workers laugh. 
---
Honestly though, half the fun of 76 is the grind. The unexpected drop of a new weapon, or dealing to a beast that a day earlier was your nemesis is where the game hooks you in. It just doesn't drop xp easy. Try and team up with slightly higher level players than you, that will increase the level of monsters you encounter, and the earnt xp increases too. Just be aware that if you see a level 200+ player in your area, the difficulty might go straight to a level 90 Deathclaw bearing down on you.
---
The equal playing field and no vats against players makes it much more enjoyable
---
There is no solution. Happened to me too. You were bound to have to start deleting them eventually anyway
---
I always dump a huge pile of bp’s for newbies. People are for the most part pretty nice in game.
---
Holy shit, *this* is what makes this game special.
---
Welcome to the grind. Leveling will get easier once you figure out how and where to do it. Whitesprings clubhouse is a good spot. But as a low lvl stay away from high lvl players. They will spawn high lvl enemies. If you do end up with some just stay back and shoot every enemy once at least.
---
Only temporary. If it’s free forever then the game gets flooded with people who haven’t purchased the full game. Plus opens a door for full free to play which isn’t cool for those of us who drop lots of time and energy
---
Is it just me but it feels like I'm actually weaker in PA
---
i got in on the fifth time..kiled by a megasloth in the first minute lol..no gun no armor..this is hard
---
I discovered years ago that first person shooters just aren’t for me,  I’m not twitchy enough for the controls.  That being said I tried Nuclear Winter and came away thinking that while it’s not for me,  this mode will be really good for those that enjoy it.  As long as it brings in more people who buy Atoms and keep the game supported I’m fine with it,  just keep adventure going strong and I’ll be happy.
---
Pride and prestige..sarcasm I guess?
---
I’m glad you got in! It can suck to have a bad drop, let me know how it goes later on.m
---
You can, it's called "Kits" you find them and theyre prebuilt buildings you can drop/place.
---
I didn’t give up, I just got tired of the constant micromanagement of my inventory.
---
Is it better?
---
Well done for doing something they should've done a year ago? Yeah, well done indeed.
---
Really enjoying it so far, one of the cleanest BR experiences I've played. The update/changes to combat really helped too.
---
Don't add random people from fallout then?

Yeah it is...... the menu switching thou is hot garbage to nav that quickly
---
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING ADVENTURE MODE, THIS IS NUCLEAR WINTER NOT ADVENTURE MODE
---
Sometimes I find people I might want to play with again
---
Thousands might be pushing it, but yeah, he's rather charming when he's awkward.
---
Satisfaction 😀
---
Titan fall is a legend
---
So will we still be able to experience the "old world" before the NPCs took over, or do they take over and the world is forever changed? Any ideas?
---
I was under the impression that only one person can win
---
Why? Why couldn't it have worked?
---
We should be able to name our dummy to
---
Can confirm.  Even tried again after daily reset, and still no-go :-\\
---
i loaded in and found my teammates already had weapons and armor in the first minute..i couldnt find anything in time to protect.myself
---
If you start the quest by going to the circle or killing a SB, it’s bugged
---
You have to start it by reading Scribe Grant’s terminal in Fort Defiance
---
I’m not sure if that’s right. I couldn’t find anything new in my adventure mode. Besides the free one from the atom shop.
---
I’m not sure yet. I won’t be able to play for a little longer than I hoped today. I logged in early today to get the update and did the daily farming but got pulled away before I could check it out. 
---
Not sure what to expect as it sounds like they wipe your character clean for the match.
---
They really need to reenable the punchbowls for shites und giggles.
---
Bethesda has said before though that as you level up the camp budget cost of items decreases, so you are able to build more because each item takes up less space, rather than the actual budget increasing
---
Only Nuclear Winter though... so it’s not harming those who “spend lots of time on the game.” Eventually, people will stop playing Nuclear Winter because you have to own 76. It won’t be this way forever, due to it being free week.
---
What’s it look like
---
Died instantly first 2 matches trying to punch the first petson I saw, couple games later got a 3 game winning streak. BOW BEFORE YOUR OVERSEER! BOW YA SHITS!
---
I usually spawn a shack/building over from teammates so I don’t get railroaded like that.  Also a lot of boxes aren’t in normal areas. They can be just tossed about the grass.
---
Never played any other BR type game and I am loving NW.
---
It's like they dont want people to have fun lmao
---
I am enjoying it. Last 3 game got dropped in solo though
---
GREED.
---
Pretty sure it’s a player icon
---
Did they fix the stomach yet?
---
Grahm dont understand all this fus about this radio thing
---
Titanfall or team fortress?
---
I would assume that multiple maps would be in rotation after full launch of the game mode.
---
I mean, people still play fortnite lol
---
And I’m glad there’s a free week so that more get inspired to buy the game, it’s just not cool to make content we paid into and continue to pay into via atoms then free for randoms forever
---
It has been several months since I played, so I can't remember what I have for pistols, but I'm sure I have nearly one of every kind. But I just don't have the drive to load up the game anymore, I'd have to either keep at it and struggle to play the way I wanted, or level up a new character to be riflemen and Power Armor build to take advantage of the way that build has it easier.
---
Mother f**ker
---
I hope I can run the wiring still.. I'm at max camp budget minus 4 wires pre patch.
---
ok..thnx for the tip
---
Pharma farma worked for me today.
---
i played for about 1/2 hour. i did very poorly, but it was still kinda fun.
---
oh boy
---
You Pc? If so let’s squad up!
---
I've been scrolling This Thread just to see if anyone else noticed that. That pretty much kills my play style and wastes three points.
---
Just found a fire breather samurai helmet on Instagram, looks tight as fuck,  @discover.fallout
---
Me and my normal squad just copped three wins in a row!
---
Actually there are very good ways to trade and signal, just use your mic! (I understand this isn't possible for everyone, but it is very frustrating to have teammates without mics)
---
Yeah, I think it's the same bug from about 4 months ago. Just scrapped another light(atomic lamp) and tried to place a cat lamp, now I can't place either.
---
I thought it was just a fluke, but yeah I just got the plasma gatling thing. IIRC this was a bug one or two updates ago, it just means it came back
---
&gt; but the massive amounts myself and others have had needs to be fixed ASAP
---
There is not a single person other than you complaining about bugs. I played adventure and NW today and there are no new bugs
---
That's hilarious. I use mine all the time to Nuka-Travel since I'm constantly overweight and can't fast travel anymore. It's a crap shoot, but most times it gets me closer to the direction I wanted to go. :)
---
Not even players on same team can win? If so thats weird.
---
Source?
---
ps4..how do u.join with teammates? it looks random to me
---
No. You need farm them manually. But you don't need be in the workshop or settlement, just do another activity and then return. The farming is fun when done in this way.
---
Well shit, that could be a game changer if you're lucky enough to find a matching weapon.
---
I could 100% be wrong that’s just what I thought. I see what you mean though.
---
Just make a custom list, you can do that.
---
I haven't had any problems. Just built that awesome Mr. Pebbles lamp and a few new items in my camp with no issues. Hope your problem gets solved soon. I'm sure servers will go down tomorrow for some maintenance.
---
Idk for PS, but on PC you get in a team via social screen and then the leader enters the match and the rest get sent along too
---
How
---
Well you must have Luck +10 then!
---
You can still repair with materials lol, I have like 7 repair kits from the queen and have never used one
---
You can absolutely repair your items with junk.  Repair kits aren't necessary for gameplay.
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
You mean like this hater?
---
 https://youtu.be/ghdOSTAda1w
---
I literally couldn't get through his whole video because it's just the rehashed hating on the game on what it was at launch and about the bag and nuke dark bottle. It's been 7 months and some youtubers are still trying to ride the hate train to get likes and subscribes. Maybe near the end he talks about the BR mode or any of the past patches but I couldn't sit through how ignorant he sounded.
---
You can repair. Pay attention to the options. You have choice of repair kits or workbench repair
---
You can use materials. If you look at the options (at the bottom of the screen) when you use workbenches, you'll see how to do it.
---
Never smoke a cigarette on the battlefield soldier 
---
!
---
I don't know the steps by heart but it wasn't hard to figure out.
---
Ok pal.
---
That’s good. You could make like 20 separate BR maps out of Appalachia
---
Whew! Okay, good - I couldn't see the option. Lemme look again. :)
---
I think with my S.P.E.C.I.A.L. And armour parts it is haha
---
Its really pathetic I cant even get through ten seconds haha
---
Lucky....no one has been talking at all in the 10 matches I've played so far...getting annoying really lol
---
Id like a radio tower which would enable me to broadcast my own station.
---
its meh at best, I'm sorry
---
Four dawg awwwwwhhhh!!!
---
oh..i tried to join on  a friend in social menu..but wouldnt let me..
---
17 at Walmart and apparently Amazon too
---
You let them find their way in office and kept quiet while your 401k plan and real estate investments went to the moon. Now millennials can't find jobs and if they do they can't afford a house with their mediocre wage.
---
He kind of looks like a weird fat Hitler behind that podium with weird shit on it.
---
Oh okay
---
It's a bug. Other people reported if earlier. Not a case of needing to turn on your teammates at end or anything.
---
Usually someone breaks the ice with "anyone have a mic?" or something. Try it!
---
If PVP mode had us start new characters then it would of been just as fun
---
I'm in the same spot.  Not a BR/PvP guy.  Tried a couple matches, first one I died when I couldn't enter some PA I found and just sat there like meat.  2nd one I didn't see anyone then until there were only 20 or so people left, promptly got ganked from someone I was looking in their direction and never saw.
---
I'm sure I'll grind out the levels at some point for the story, but it's just not for me.
---
I hope so after 76 idk if I could go back to Solo Fallout, I hope Fo5 has Co-op atleast.
---
One complaint my friends always have about fortnight and apex is that it’s the same map and same locations. I think if they have multiple drop circles in rotation it would bring a much needed variety into the genre. I don’t play BR games a lot but I still think it would be fun not knowing what map rotation your going to get.
---
Honestly, that sounds like a problem on your end (unless you're on PS4 which is having system wide issues), I played 5 or 6 matches after work and didn't have a single DC, and the game ran buttery smooth.
---
So what are the chances this was the pvp they intended all along. but due to players throwing fits about how upset they are Bethesda rushed to deliver the pvp beta until nuclear winter was ready to replace it.
---
I've only played about 10 rounds so far, but the three times I got power armor I went down pretty quick, and out of the six or so encounters with others in power armor, the only one that didn't have me winning was when it was three on one.
---
People in power armor seem to be huge slow targets without an appropriate increase in survivability; the only reason I can see for using it would be to negate the speed debuff from heavy weapons.
---
Yeah who knows might also be a bug, i think this is like an early beta for NW.
---
I've had "number 1" happen to me once. I have another small complaint that I mentioned in another post.
---
Your emote icons above your head can be seen by enemies.
---
$11 where?
---
Thursday prob
---
This is a little culty.
---
Me too, its the mr pebbles lamp i wanted to place!:( bought it and as soon as i tried placing it i discovered the bug, ended up deleting some stuff thinking it was full, then was confused when it still didnt work so i deleted every item in my camp and yet still 100% full
---
Can confirm a team wins.  Our team won tonight because one of us lived and we got the Overseer notification after he killed the last guy.
---
You should want 76 to hope to parallel the turnabout that D2 made.
---
**The Purveyor:** The levels of legendary items granted by the Purveyor now better match the buyer’s Character level.
---
What does this mean?
---
 My only concern was the potential for the BR to take priority over the PVE content. I still hope that isn’t the case and I’ll enjoy the BR mode while it’s out and while I wait for the road map.
---
The only time i lose control is when the server is about to shit the bed. But that has a little pop up telling you controls are disabled.
---
Oh thanks for the heads up!
---
The people complaining about not wanting BR and the people praising this mode are likely different people.
---
My experience as well, maybe there are perks to make it worthwhile.
---
It's a sneak peek. Aka testing pls read the game modes title next time pls
---
So far no enemy’s have dropped with me
---
Ive had the mics bugged before and usually a restart fixed it for me
---
The first thing I do is toss the blue jumpsuit. You can see it from a mile away,
---
Also, the fucking losers who downvoted my first post reeaaally need to get a life.
---
I see improvement, a long long way to go, but improvement none the less
---
Forsaken and annual pass for Y2 is going to be 40 bucks with the Base game and CoO/Warmind going FTP. Destiny 2 has a shit ton to offer and is worth the cash.
---
Thanks dude.
---
I got like 800 caps today.
---
Can we get the storm on different parts of the map though? Let’s get different Biomes into the mix.
---
They literally said that the Fire storm was caused by all the nukes being dropped, the radiation comes from the fallout of a nuclear blast, so the storm being fire makes senses because that's what a nuclear blast produces
---
I just hate that there is no solo mode. It should be fun if you have a stack.
---
This is pretty much the whole reasoning.
---
You don’t necessarily have to like it, but there are no NPCs specifically because of the story. The entire idea of the game is that we’re rebuilding and reclaiming Appalachia
---
How about putting 76 on hold like I was suggesting. I'd rather see them put assets spent on 76 into TES6 or Starfield than continuing development on a failure of a game like 76.
---
Invite to team from main menu.  Team leader starts game.
---
Agree 100%.  I just spent 2 days building a brand new C.A.M.P. where I planned everything around the exact spot that players spawn.  Now, it's pretty much a different spawn point every time they arrive.  A friend tested by FT'ing away, and back to my C.A.M.P. over and over and over.  This is REALLY annoying. :-(
---
I don’t think that they will. From what I’ve gathered is that the settlers will have one spot that is just a throwaway location with no interior right now, and the raiders will have the space station. The base story as of now would be unaffected.
---
but it gives you radiation?
---
I'll get a cap or two from them a decent percent of the time. Got Radaway one time
---
It's incredibly clunky but still fun.
---
Just like in the beta- if I keep my progression awesome- if I don’t as least it was fun as hell
---
I've just come up with a new game mode, and it's infinitely better than the new battle royal. Think battleship, but cows! We can call it something clever like Cattleship.  xD
---
Is there a way to mark stuff that I don't know?  Like how you would flag an enemy for teammates without mics in fortnite or Apex by pressing right on the d-bad or a bound key on a computer?  Or to mark 'Radium rifle in this crate'?  Because as it stands I'm having to painstakingly describe the exact spot to a teammate with no mic (or even to one with one)... and it's anything but very good.
---
Well there it is! I’ve seen a few people say that there team was the only one to survive and nothing happened. Just death. That sucks!
---
I don't think they're atom shop items. I think you're correct that they have to be unlocked, you just haven't unlocked them. Keep playing NW to do so.
---
From what I've heard you actually can wake up in a wagon with skeletons, never seen it myself though.
---
Oh ok so you think they slapped this together last weekend? If they knew they should say. If not something needs to happen in studio. Is 76 in a “sneak peek” period? No? Then why are there so many consistent repeatable common bugs?
---
Computer says that was predicted.. he was weak
---
its somewhat rare as it only comes from that event, it isnt very valuable though
---
If you're brand new you don't need one. Just play the game, scrap/sell as needed, and fill your stash with useful stuff.
---
Just call the radio host 'Cerberus':In Greek mythology, Cerberus was a three-headed dog that guarded the gates to the underworld. I have a STRONG feeling that the host (if only one) will be female this time, just my guess.
---
Totally agree, I feel like an idiot out there haha.
---
&gt; journalists should be launched into the sun 
---
FTFY
---
Rub your hands together 🤠
---
But then there’s the incentives of Free Players buying atoms and spending them for cosmetics. STW players in fort nite weren’t necessarily scornful of the new BR mode, no? It was fun, free content.
---
Not really that rare hate to say. I usually get 1 every other breach and clear. I usually find lower level players and hand them out.
---
Does anyone know if progress in nuclear winter carries over after the sneak peak?
---
It's a nuclear storm. Causes by us.  Perfectly Fallout related.
---
I melee so the only thing that I use to hit SBQ are The Dragons / Black Powder Rifle. I don’t have anything else in my build to consistently take them down. They are fun to bust out to start a fight too.
---
Doesn't Playstation have a club system like Xbox? I host a club for my friends from each game I met them in, so I always know who I can hit up depending on what game I'm in.
---
LMFAO!
---
I’m personally having  a pretty good time playing NW! I’ve never played BR before so it’s something new. Also what did you get for winning? Did you get that cool trophy!?
---
Out of town but will try and explore when I'm back on Friday!   
---
If I don't respond by then please remind me, my E3 post has gotten out of hand notification wise.
---
Thank you Incel, very cool!
---
I'm not sure I most play single player games, so I don't know much about playing with friends
---
They have been working on this ok. This isn't and original Fo76 this is Nuclear winter that is being tested ok and yes Nuclear winter is still in its testing period. Honestly the game has been working fine for me.
---
Omg! Thank you so much! I was so confused! You're a legend.
---
Yea can confirm, both times ive said “anyone have a mic” two other people instantly came on lmaoo
---
I didnt get sick of it in 400+ hours of fallout 4
---
Open up the map n go to challenge n look up world challenges the tadpole badges / challenges should b towards the bottom. Hope I helped n good luck
---
Well One did, for forwarded this..

---
Same. I've never enjoyed a battle royal game until now. I really think it's an awesome addition.
---
Yeah. Luckily nuclear winter feels rather balanced. Except for the m79 grande launcher.
---
"Until" implies it stops on \[before reaching\] July 8, the term "through" means inclusive of \[each of the stated dates\].
---
In Challenges under the World section
---
Same here, even if I miss vats
---
~anthem disappoint intensifies~
---
Post-Patch I can't get Pompy to trigger now even though the terminal says he's ready to meet.  Sigh
---
You get four codes then you get the briefcase open your misc tab and click on it then pick where to nuke
---
To be fair, this game should have been delayed it’s release by a few months to iron out some of the more critical and embarrassing issues.
---
You have to remember that this gamemode doesn't have players with 800lbs of stash space, plus their camps placed among the world. Also once a player dies they are removed so performance only gets better as the match goes on.
---
He said in a recent interview that he would have preferred to have a much longer beta/testing period. One of the methods for getting more players to test was not necessarily needing to pre-order, but "maybe people who had Fallout 4 could have been opted in to a special trial or something"  (paraphrasing on my part, but along this lines).
---
Im gonna pop a video up tomorrow, maybe pop one up yourself if you can?
---
Id love to see it
---
They still need to tweak aspects of controls for a little smoother gameplay (still a bit clunky) but it does feel much better.  I honestly was very surprised at how well the game ran. And sound effects are very good I feel. Plus, I'll admit it, I actually somewhat enjoyed this royale mode.  Smaller map, less running around it feels, and a tad bit faster from my experience thus far.  The 2 other br games I've played I did not like at all so this did surprise me honestly.
---
wow this guys so cool he doesn't even know how to SPELL fortnite
---
peak alpha male
---
Same but I cant use vats apart from vatsing  my own frags. It makes melee really hard
---
Agreed, I was a little unsure about battle royal but they killed it, was going to try one match see how it was, been in it most of the day lol
---
Yup it’s not working also VATS itself seems a little busted. I was missing 5 shots with 95% hit chance. I’m sure it will be fixed soon though.
---
I like that duplicate perk cards give you overseer XP.
---
Well I never knew a deathclaw could be so cute. Guess I know what I'm reading for the rest of the night.
---
In 10 matches, I got a radium rifle early on in three of them, but I haven't actually taken hits from someone using one.
---
Most of my radiation has come from barrels; that said, I've also picked up more rad away than I can shake my fist at.
---
Do you think they'll pop after we buy the game ?
---
When it gives you the 30 second countdown, it should open your map. If not, open it manually. You choose where to spawn - the three blue dots are your teammates. Spawn somewhere near them
---
I just delivered a gift bag to a group of 4. I’m pretty sure I scared them off wearing my tattered mole outfit.  Even helped them on the Morgantown cargodrop event... they ran off.
---
Pretty sure those of us, myself included, that never wanted it, are too busy dissecting all the crazy shit we actually wanted, like new enemies, npcs, and that new power armor that were all teased. Not to mention, most of us are starting to realize that Bethesda couldn't give two shits what the players really want, they dilude themselves into thinking this game is perfect, and that they can do no wrong. It's tiring to keep trying to get them to listen, when they've begun adopting a very "lalala we can't hear you" attitude.
---
They are perk cards. Open them in your perk menu, same as in adventure/survival mode
---
Yeah, they’ve been doing a good job in my opinion. Just wanted this out there for awareness.
---
If you don't pick your spawning spot then the game will spawn you randonly on the map.
---
You might need to craft it at an armor workbench
---
Can we pack the lawyers in with them?
---
Nukashine grenades
---
They unlock icons and skins for the other modes. I'm only level 6, but apparently the rewards get better as you climb the ranks.
---
Maybe something like what they do on GTA online around christmas would be nice, full fledged faction snowball fights
---
You will likely need to craft it at an armor workbench in the game, then equip it.
---
For it to show up? Been doing nuclear winter all day lol
---
Well to be honest most of the people seem to be enjoying it in the community so I guess it is a welcome thing.
---
Have you tried switching it from borderless mode? Makes a huge difference for some (me included).
---
My first game I spawned in on top of a bunch of barrels and took 50+ radiation a second and half my health bar was gone before I had a chance to move lol.
---
Claim them for plans then immediately leave.
---
Don’t even bother with the initial defense.
---
Anything you build or any effort you put in will be taken, along with your caps, by folks who insist on murdering you because they can.
---
It’s frustrating and a huge departure from the player culture at launch but unless they change the mechanics in adventure mode it simply is what it is.  Apparently PvP is even more fun for the “rawr I’m a raider” mentality when you can’t or won’t participate in it.
---
As others have said anything that can be gained in a workshop, other than plans, can be gained from a good farming route (including fusion cores).
---
I was skeptical on it because pvp in the normal game is kinda bad (imo), and I'm not really into BR games style games, but I actually enjoyed the BR mode. I only played a few games and almost won one, plus I get caps and exp for my adventure mode character
---
Posted a [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bz6eyq/story_chad_the_clown/) based on this picture. Thanks for the inspiration!
---
I hop servers till I see someone or multiple someones over lvl 50 in the launch sites usually 5-20 mins later a nuke is launched
---
What? That isn’t what’s being discussed. At all.
---
But outfits you equip in adventure do not carry over to nuclear winter and I've seen a lot of people wearing it in nuclear winter? And you can't use benches in NW
---
That’s a yes.
---
SO MUCH FUN
---
Ahhh👍🏼 thank you fine sir😊
---
Did you look under the completed items?   It could be that it's considered completed and that's why you're not seeing at as an active quest.
---
Also, I find broken pro snap cameras everywhere.  I even repaired a few until I realized that I only needed one and you can't sell them.
---
Should keep rank if they run it like they did the game beta
---
There is not for either sadly :(
---
It’s fun. Got two wins already. But no nuke.
---
At the risk of spoiling my strategy, here you go: spawn near the red rocket south of Flatwoods. It has several containers and a loot terminal. Head NNE from there between the houses and the hillside. One of the houses had a high chance of spawning a PA frame on the back porch.
---
From there, just go where the fire forces you to go.
---
You don't equip things through that Atom shop, so you probably do have to make it at a workbench. At least try?
---
I agree we should at least be able to use it on AI enemies
---
I would recommend crafting it in adventure first then check the atom shop near the bottom of apparel. I don't know that you need to first bit it showed up for me
---
Is it just me or am I getting bioshock 2 multiplayer vibes off this too?  Loved that multiplayer, and might be crazy
---
:(
---
Hi, I watched the whole video a while back because it's better than starting at Reddit. Which of those bugs are caused by an out-of-the-ordinary situation? They may not have happened to everyone, but anyone could have had those bugs happen to them, he wasn't playing in a weird way.
---
I don't have PC or would help more. Give it a quick Google and all the key mappings will be returned. You may be able to go to settings and see what the keys are set to
---
I don't want to lose the garbage I have collected for a long time, including the clothes that can be seen everywhere but need time to collect. It's now limited to 1,500 pounds, and no amount of material in the account can be destroyed on its own. I don't understand why bethesda hasn't responded yet. Do I have to delete everything? It's easier for me to buy another account. I want the worthless garbage that I spend my time collecting
---
Your budget doesn't increase with level. Please stop spreading this ridiculous nonsense.
---
The number one filter I would like to see is, Mic Required. So far too many matches are ruined because the randos you are stuck with cant, or wont talk. So far, everyone I have grouped with that has a Mic has agreed with me and the ones without havn't complained.
---
Not sure if you have to create a Bethesda account for Xbox or Playstation but if you did then maybe. But probably not
---
There is another post about this. Seems quite a few people are having issues.
---
Both, and if you liked it you can get it 50% off.

Grab lots and lots and lots of spacesuits
---
Well thanks for that cause my wife just made her character and accidentally put a point in to charisma after spending an hour or so in the character creator...
---
For the few minutes I spent in adventure, I loved seeing all the new little dwellers with party hats running around. Never see that these days
---
That's not how it works. Different studios work on different projects. You're saying you want the FO76 team (Austin) to also work on TES6, FO5, and Starfield? I'd rather keep those game in the studios they belong, and keep the Austin team away from them.
---
Just tamed a sloth
---
I'll experiment and see what I can find, thanks for commenting
---
I thought we were able to? Maybe I read the patch notes wrong and all I've run into so far is like a couple ghouls so I didn't need it
---
I meant against players but AI definitely
---
You can use it on AI
---
I think it's broken on Xbox.
---
I was thinking the same thing. I haven't even unlocked any rooms yet and I have found terminals that requires 105. And I can't help but think with how long it takes to get a lobby and how little so you get from playing. That it would be almost impossible to reach that level esspecially in the next week
---
No. No they haven't. They've made adjustments to the amount of budget some items require, but you do not increase build budget when you level up.
---
Glad I’m not the only one with this
---
ayup.
---
High lvl friend with high charisma shares 3 lock picking perks with his lvl 4 friend now a lvl 4 can pick lvl 3 locks and not get wanted for it
---
For nuclear winter, you DO have to equip it in the atom shop.
---
Hah sorry, Team Fortress 2!
---
Nukes burrows
---
It you’re on PC you can get it
---
There's no level cap in that area. If you spawn in first it'll scale to you, but if a level 60+ player comes into the zone it'll start spawning mobs at their level.
---
I dont like it. The games combat just isnt good for pvp
---
Because you yourself have to learn the prime plan for 50 Cal to be able to craft the ammo
---
Yeah I've swapped my settings to team chat but no luck unfortunately. I'll have to keep fiddling around with it
---
That’s what we call a pro tip ladies and ghouls.

White springs golf club and resident houses

Haven't had a chance to play yet but that sounds like a good thing. PA is supposed to be feared and powerful in the lore and what not.

There’s no downside to leaving the match early as far as I can tell. If I don’t have teammates alive (unless they didn’t spawn anywhere near me and are just slowly crawling through bushes there whole time) I leave the match as soon as I die after reading my match breakdown.
---
What is the question? Maybe language barrier? You’re looking to craft ultracite .50 but don’t have the option?
---
Almost completely separate, right? Dont you have to level your character in the main game to use all of the perk cards?
---
It looks cool and I like that they listened and made it more fair than the current PvP mode by having everyone start fresh with scattered weapons and armour rather than carrying over the existing bloodied builds, etc.  I've seen footage of it and, while I'm not a big PvP fan, I can see where this would actually be fun.
---
Now, if they could make a capture the flag version with re-spawning, that would be awesome....  They could even let you build defenses around your flag, with it being a CAMP area.   I'm a big lover of CTF...
---
For fucks sake!  Should I switch back to regular 50 ammo or is prime worth it on a FE ma deuce?
---
Yeah, 900ish xp for reaching endgame is well worth the time spent. 
---
And no resources gambled. 
---
I don't have to feel like I'm wasting my time, and I can scratch that occasional pvp itch. For me it's a win/win.
---
I think we all were! Glad I could help!
---
And have FO76 go down the same path H1Z1 and Fortnite did? No thank you.
---
White Springs, West Tech, and if you happen to be in Watoga, keep an eye out for legendary bots for free stuff.
---
integrated graphics? that fixed my problems first time running
---
I thought if I owned the gun I’d be able to craft the ammo.    Apparently not.
---
They are player icons, not actual loot crates
---
Athlete, Archery, and Swimming are probably the three easiest to get done.
---
No they give a shit about what players want just not what you want y'all got you're pve content first dlc be happy with that we get winter y'all get wastelander seems fair to me bud
---
No I don’t think perk cards come into play from adventure or survival
---
Sony said no like usual, Bethesda didn't rule it out for the future though, and Sony seems to be getting a little bit more into cross play
---
Good question. Do you have a prime receiver?
---
What a hot fucking take on this echo chamber of a subreddit
---
Is your next post gonna be "unpopular opinion: i actually love this game"?
---
Kings Anglish friend.
---
I'm a dlc hor myself. When I play a game I get hooked and only okay that game, sometimes for months. Sea of thieves for a year. I too want that rare outfit or totally desired weapon even if I don't then on using it. So flaunt your gear and be proud friend, you are not alone
---
Yes.
---
Yeah bcos, every one dies in that fire, how can winner walk away?
---
Or a flying school bus...
---
There's a decent boost but you'll have to continually be buying instead of being able to craft
---
yeah i'm going to need to read more. this isn't the kind of game you can pause and figure out as you go along. i did find a menu where i was able to see and friend request him... but couldn't figure out how to get there again.
---
also, I spent half an hour adventuring and looting fallout style to be killed by some robots. i respawned at the spot i died (i was near a landmark) but was killed again before i could retrieve my baggie. so i'm assuming all my stuff is gone.
---
i put my camp down somewhere to see what it did. i guess that's it, no take-backs without paying. oh well.
---
nobody knows
---
The first one is an icon the second is for your camp. The statue of vaultboy holding a severed head that's in the red power armors right hand will be creditable at overseer level 21.
---
Honestly they should allow people to create their own radio / broadcasting stations at their C.A.M.P. and players can have their own stations that other players could tune in to listen to.
---
Yes, I actually got the daily level up when i went back to adventure mode from playing NW
---
Well try turning on the damage indicators feature, it's off by default
---
They'll just say everything should have been in at launch
---
She has a really really strong armour effect.
---
Holy hell, I'm starting to think you aren't a troll but actually suffer from paranoia first downvote bots and now I'm have an alt on the mod team?
---
Along with Zoe Quinn.
---
Especially our low level alts....
---
It doesn't work like that, only works when you're shooting at someone and it's already on
---
Well... I’ll have to respectfully disagree. Just ran about 10 or so games with my homies. It’s pretty awful. Why do they mark the other players with a red blip on screen when you engage? Wtf. So many other things. IMO it’s bad. Enjoy it, peoples. 😁
---
You will start to remember the hot spots for gear in time. Don't let it get to you just yet. Once you start to learn where creates are it makes getting equipped much easier. Zoom in and drop right on buildings. Sometimes the creates are right there m gl
---
That’s odd. Sorry didn’t mean to offend. I’ve played this game since beta but have ever struggled to craft the ammo I need. Ammo crafting should not be locked. Maybe try joining a new server.
---
I love it man I’m not hiding g it at all man that shit is super fun
---
Even more so if Whitesprings is nuked. There's generally a good 6 or so legendary un-nuked, but when it's nuked it easily doubles the amount you can score.
---
No sir. It’s plugged into the GPU.
---
Huh, it's been literally perfect in my past 100 hours on PC
---
Do you have to stay after you die?
---
All your owned apparel is at the bottom of the respective categories
---
Imagine final area being fissure prime and someone nukes it and suddenly you're all fighting the queen as the flames get closer.
---
That's not true. I can craft all the prime ammo and I've only bothered to learn a handful of plans. OP is probably just missing the required flux or something.
---
Simply put, I paid for an FO themed survival adventure game, not \*yet another\* BR. Had I known there was going to be a BR mode implemented, I wouldn't have bought the game (among other issues I'm currently having). If I wanted a BR, I would've played Apex Legends. "At least they're doing a different take on a BR!" I'd rather they keep working on their different take on their Survival Adventure.
---
Now, there are 3 different game modes, each requiring a balance and design team to maintain it because metas will set in with any competitive mode, and the resources are going to go towards the most popular one. If that's the BR, then exploring Appalachia stops being the center piece of the game.   
---
Pick an identity, and stick with it.
---
It will take a while. I was new to fo myself and getting used to the pipboy and all the things in the game was a tough learning curve. But once you get it, god this game is fun.
---
On PC every game I've played, theres been at least 1-2 other players with a mic, if bot the whole team.
---
Without voice chat, i have killed 3-5 people each game and won one match from seven. This is first game where randoms stay with teammates. No fucking kids like in fortnite. Bless this community of mature people :D
---
The limbs protect more but break quickly
---
They got rid of the legendary bots :{
---
I'm seeing something similar with my normal flamer. For the Possum challenge I'm toasting eyebots and other robots but I ran into a handful of level one normal eyebots in Flatwoods that would drop to just a few hit points then their health would restore and I'd do it again. Had to melee them to take them down.
---
Explosive lasers don’t work work demo expert, plus the number is inaccurate.
---
It's just you. If I wanted to play BR I'd play one of the hundreds of better ones out there.
---
I actually prefer Apex legends for my BR fix. Never really liked the others.
---
Will need to try this one still.
---
U can earn skins and other items for all modes as well. Think i got a new stash box so far. Havent seen a full list yet
---
Thank you guys! 
---
Been eyein this mission for a while now. I want my refrigerator pack and move some point in luck.
---
The dude is just a troll, he is accusing me of having a mod alt that banned him.
---
I picked up a used copy for $12.00 pm GameFly last week. I figured even if it’s as bad as they says it’s still as cheap as a movie. I’ve not been disappointed. Either this was a completely different game at launch or people over reacted a bit.
---
Your Adventure/Survival SPECIAL are carried over though.
---
I like it. I am excited to earn more rewards.
---
I'm a casual player. As such I've never wanted to enter the PvP scene because I don't spend the time to get all the legendary gear it takes to be viable. Battle royal on the other hand, that I can get behind. Did a round tonight and it was so much fun (died in about two minutes). It's a form of PvP I can actually get behind since it gives everyone a level playing field (and despite what some people say, I actually really like Fallout's aiming system since it can be super accurate if you just use the sights).
---
Valhalla.
---
I know they talked about earning rewards in NW that are available in other modes like camp objects and other customization. Do you know if any are available yet?
---
I haven't gotten the chance to try it yet
---
The dude is just a bit off or a troll, he is now accusing me of having a alt on the mod team here. Lol
---
You have to own an outfit from the atom shop.  Go to that outfit in the atom shop and there will be a button to press favorite for NW
---
Crossbow. If you can hit them a couple times, they are gone.
---
That is how I play Apex.
---
The function already exists. I’m not on right now but it’s a field of view option. I think that’s what it’s called. I put mine at 50% and looks much better. Not perfect but better.
---
That's not the exact reason. Everyone has a minute or two of invisibility, but it turns off if you pick something off or attack someone.
---
I don't think I get it when you say "haters" like there were legitimate issues at launch, numerous amounts of bugs, glitches, lies and so on. The game is still buggy now. Sure it's less buggy but still not perfect. There's no problem with a game getting better with time just like No Man's Sky. But to basically say that the "haters" were unjust is ridiculous to say the least. Bethesda and this game deserved every little bit of criticism they got. But the people who played the game didn't deserve the hatred they got.
---
What console?
---
Throwing lawyers into the sun is an insult to the sun.
---
I don't know what to tell you, maybe it's a advancement of the random damage bug from before it had evolved
---
No. They are humans infected with the virus that scorch beasts carry. It slowly consumes and replaces them with ultracite dust
---
That would explain why nearly  no one plays the current survival mode. This is Fallout 76, not Fortnight 76. The only people that want it, are the people that just want to play every lazy BR game ever, with a Fallout skin on it, and a super jenky combat system, but I'm sure eventually someone will have wanted it, instead of maybe playing any of the other copy paste games.
---
If you hit RB, I think, while you have a wheel slot highlighted you get a dropdown list if everything in your inventory that's favorable to choose for that slot.
---
Yeah, it can be  stressful. I’m playing solo and I suck at aiming so I’m basically hiding from everyone in an ever shrinking circle and just waiting to be killed. Sorta like a slasher movie.
---
Thanks for proving this sub is filled with mentally handicapped people, I had a really good laugh.
---
There are "Kit"s, that are just little single piece CAMP style stuff. A guard tower you can stand on, a concrete wall to hide behind, a turret to cover your back.
---
No,it gives you what you got when you die
---
I’ve gotten some profile pictures like the icons &amp; I’m level 7. Not sure if you get camp items or skins when you get higher?
---
Thank you! I have a few and i really don't know if there's any way to know about it in the in game tips.
---
I read somewhere that the Scortch Beast Queen has something like 400 armour and you need to do more damage than that to hurt her.  With a gatling gun or .50 cal machine gun I believe that each hit in succession is additive.  So, if your gatling does 50 per shot, it would take 8 shots in succession before you start doing damage.  If you miss, then it starts over again.
---
With single shot weapons you have to be doing over 400 (assuming no armour modifiers) before doing damage.  If you have modifiers or perk cards that ignore armour, then that factors into it.
---
Also, the SBQ health scales with the number of players.  So if there are fewer players in the zone then she doesn't have as much health as when you have greater numbers.   Not sure what the scaling numbers are.
---
It's why I switched to a Zealot's .50 cal Explosive machine gun.  it does enough damage per round and spits out enough lead that it takes chunks out of her health, when getting a full 250 rounds on her, rather than slivers.
---
At least, that's my understanding...
---
Where did I say the critisicm was unjust?
---
I'm talking about the many people who go out of there way to bash this game and personally attack those who enjoy it.
---
...and your unsolicited submission means they can't use that name.  Doh!
---
Hunh?
---
Totally agree...or had a larger pool of people test it.
---
You're welcome
---
Lol it takes like 5 shots to take someone down it makes me mad and the sniper rifle takes two shots to the head when it should just be a one shot to the head
---
Yeah I have Bloody Mess but I need 9 luck to use it unfortunately
---
Oh i think you do have to create a bethesda account. would be cool if this was an option.
---
You didn’t offend im just fucking around.  So what’s the reality.......should I be able to craft this ammo having the gun or do I have to read the plan?  It’s not on the menu under ultracite at my tinkers bench.
---
I dont think that's true.
---
I'm kinda now liking nuclear winter
---
Running borderless mode?
---
Exactly this! Can't be broken by players, infinite health, just simply displays damage per hit, and every five seconds, shows your average DPS, ARK survival did an amazing job with their training dummy and it became a mandatory part of every base due to its usefulness, more so in this game.
---
gun fu is busted
---
For that new Mr. Pebbles?!?? Am I right?!? He’s already at the camp here.
---
Yeah but those 5 shots are from a weapon you cant miss with, can shoot through Windows, and can move with little accuracy penalty with.
---
I wondered why I didn't see any yesterday. Thanks for the info!
---
Its okay. You can also give them the benefit of the doubt, and assume they didn't try to fuck this up and think it would make money. You can assume that after getting someone to make a functional wearable power armor helmet with lights and voice modulator, they didn't think people would be dying on the hill of "I want a 5 dollar canvas bag instead of a nylon bag to hold it in."  
---
You can believe that after the earlier negatives, they didn't intend to make more drama with the Nuka rum, but due to that being a licenced product rather than a first party product, they might not have had enough say to prevent it.  
---
Its alright man, its okay. Admitting they fucked up doesn't mean you have to assume the worst.
---
I’m enjoying it even though I’m not very good at it. I think limiting to seven total perk cards is interesting, but it really does limit your options. I’ve had the Hacker card from the very beginning but in maybe 20 matches I’ve only seen one terminal. And of course I couldn’t hack it because I stopped using the Hacker card after game six or so because it was useless. Same thing with the lock picking perk, I haven’t seen any locked containers yet. If the two were one perk I’d put it in just to have it, but they’re not worth it otherwise.
---
Huh. I haven't unlocked anything that requires more than 1 point. How do you know what the requirements are?
---
Ya i heard it's from the dev room im on xbox though
---
Anger management dude the OP I was calling out for believing in that silly conspiracy about downvote bots is now claiming I have an alt account on the mod team and bannex him.
---
Basically dude is either suffering from paranoia or is just a conspiracy theorist.
---
IMO, this looks great, but it takes away the last remaining bit of post-apocalyptic hue.
---
In the video from E3 they say time has moved on since we left the vault
---
Lol well yeah but didn’t the video say you get to sit in the overseers seat if it’s just get to a certain rank and done that’s not very fun.
---
I found a room behind the level 10 wall (I'm 11) there is another laser door which requires level 100.
---
When it does it just reload your gun and it will fix the issue.
---
No one plays survival mode cause y'all cried too much and it ain't fun and its a wasteland stop holding hand to hand
---
Most require 1 stat in that perk. Good ones use 3 and OP ones (tenderizer and Bloody mess) require 9
---
It's with overseer ranks, not wins.
---
I'm a big fallout/Skyrim fan so a lot of the gathering, crafting, weapon mechanics are familiar on the surface. But this is a new game, and my first online game so that's bringing new challenges. 
---
Also, before I started my game I changed my 'display name' on Bethesda launcher and used same name in-game. Apparently I'm stuck with my sign in username no matter what? That sucks.
---
My Instigating Dragoon is not working like it did pre-patch. What was a one shot now takes two or three.
---
Does anyone know how building works in NW? The only things I've been able to build so far are the kits you can loot with a wall or turret or whatnot, but I have no idea how to...or even if I can, open regular build mode to place floors or walls.
---
This...every time lol
---
At the end of the game it says "upcoming rewards" and shows crates and stuff...
---
I've watched a couple, you can still voice chat with your team so I've told them where things are coming from when possible though your view is limited to their third person.  Also good to get an idea of how things play out.  Stealth Boys are a very good way to turn a fight around or get the drop on people.
---
FFS how is it possible to do this in a week.
---
It wouldn't work with the way it is now because you have to create a character in adventure mode 1st or says, plus it is tied to the level each special skill is set in adventure. Even though it would be nice and make it so it's always being played, It just wouldn't work with this setup =/
---
It’d be nice to do it in the main screen instead of the 30 seconds to a minute in the vault
---
Yep, that's the bug.
---
My friend played it for 30 minutes and quit. He didn't care all the stuff he complained about is fixed because he's immune to logic it seems. He just wants to hate on the game and played it enough to justify it. Now if he plays it again, he'll have to like it and change his opinion which he doesn't want to do. So why would any of these people change? Lol
---
I heard that but I was thinking maybe a year or 2 at most but it sounds like it might be much longer
---
Using those kits from your inventory will open the build menu so you can place them down. You can also set down a camp to build stuff
---
Just a little bit of frustration.
---
OH FUCK YEAH. I was honestly hoping to god that Bethesda added more vaults and more subtle vault locations, (like think back to Fallout 3, with having a vault under a garage). They were so cool to happen upon and explore in NV and 3.
---
Totally, it doesn't seem to do anything at all.
---
Ok some of these PvP changes exclusive to Nuclear Winter should really be implemented into the main game.
---
I just wanna see everyone enjoy it and get along and keep it alive . :)
---
You also need a briefcase but Iv never found one
---
Its funny because I was about to buy it and use it too. Did you try to favorite it and it wouldn't let you?
---
I found that out. I can’t find one either lol
---
Only thing I have against it is that picking weapons and stuff feels a tiny bit clunky and solo is really hard to play. Also wish there was more of the map
---
Hey guys we knowingly shipped a broken mess of game that was more a beta, lied about the collectors edition, messed up fixing that issue and only decided to give you what you actually paid for after huge public outlash, but we're sorry.
---
Oh and here's Fortni, I mean here's BR.
---
A lot of perk cards grant DR bonuses that go away if you are in power armor. So yeah, it’s entirely possible to actually have a higher DR when you are out of your armor.
---
Try fully exiting the game and coming back
---
We will have to wait and see i guess
---
Thanks for the reply! Is there a way to open the build menu if you don't have a kit?
---
Can you use the perk cards from NW in adventure?
---
Yeah I wished it was a bit more detailed...I just thought I was supposed to be opening these boxes or something lol just making sure I was missing out! Thank you!
---
It got way better around patch 6 or 7 and has been going back down every patch.
---
I can’t figure out how to open the loot crates does anyone know how?
---
I would say promises were unfulfilled for sure...and everyone has done that in their personal life.  But accountability is different in business.  However, I do find a difference in someone trying hard to deliver on a promise and someone who never intended to fulfill that promise and I definitely see the former here more than the latter.  But, my post was more about the undeserved personal and professional attack’s as opposed to the “well-deserved criticism” that was a separate issue.
---
Upon the next major rank milestone
---
The crates are loot crate player icons in the atomic shop, not actual crates
---
I like where the game is now but yeah that's a turd thing to say. He knew they were delivering an u fished game that would still sell.
---
How do you open the boxes you get at level 5 and 10?
---
Wow, nice man. Did you win?
---
Yeah I think that would make more sense.
---
Wait so are they adding raiders too? Cause i miss those fuckers
---
Oh weird.
---
I keep meaning to give it another try.  I just got bored eventually.  Though I know there's so many more quests now.  Maybe when I get done with Enderal.
---
Maybe ask the people you see it on? Also, maybe you have to reboot the game?
---
Thanks :)
---
Yeah, it's a bummer, but I understand why they did it.
---
Whatever the default is set to. I didn’t change it.
---
Grenade Launchers are actually fun to use, for once!
---
For the first people who started it anyway.
---
Cool thing about this is you can end up having to use any of the weird makeshift weapons you'd otherwise never bother with.
---
Dude, I actually like it.
---
Not weaker just an bigger target
---
Master. Im sure
---
I didn't vote for the Republicans that did this. And I am 64 and in the same sinking boat you described. I worked my entire life since I was 15 and had everything ripped right out from under me so the rich can have more. Wake up and quit blaming age groups. That's not where the problem is.
---
I hate not having vats. I'm a vat user through and through.
---
Terminal on the main floor near the double doors has all the information you need. Also the few minutes is a great tool to make you play again.  I've already found several holotapes and explored pretty much every room I can with my level. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I think the quickness of it makes the exploring more exciting.
---
Worked! Thank you
---
Fully agree
---
Make sure everyone is on the main menu. Then select social and their name then invite to team.
---
Try swapping it out, it has a bizarre negative impact for what seems like a majority of players
---
Might have accidently clicked no fill when entering a game, before you click it from the three options, look at the bottom of the screen
---
There are plenty among us.  Some even vote.
---
That's what I've understood because I can only craft ultracite ammo for weapons who's prime receiver plan I've learned. Plus it wouldn't make much sense to be able to just get a prime weapon and then know how to craft it's ammo without having to learn the plans first.
---
You only get a few hundred xp. That's like killing one scorched beast.
---
This post aged well lol
---
Where does that briefcase spawn?
---
Thanks!
---
Thats cool and all buy I bought this game for PvE content, not Battle royale content.
---
Bill Clinton was the one who sold us out.
---
Agreed. Everyone upvote him please.
---
Thank you Robert Baratheon, very cool!
---
It says to go to adventure mode to level up my character. I've played 50+ games of nuclear winter so far so I have more than a few hundred xp
---
Lol.
---
I've had the bug in the past too, but not every time. Was weird. Logged in just now after your comment here to check. Textures seem to be good at the moment?  However, I know sometimes they were okay in the past too, and would randomly switch back to the [weird](https://i.imgur.com/poXk2bd.png) [ass](https://i.imgur.com/gDfAoVn.png) textures.
---
Wondering how long before the patch for the patch comes out? Thinking I should just go play Metro for a week and wait this mess out
---
I already got u fuckers beat im 76-Dog
---
Yeah there’s a lot of us playing! I just got carried in a few matches tonight myself.
---
VATs now closes after firing a single shot and not killing an enemy. Yay...?
---
I have actually seen this asked. My response is this; if that starts happening, then we (as a consumer base) let Bethesda know that's not the direction we want the game to go. That's about all we can do.
---
I think Beth can manage adding content to both
---
I thought I saw 2 Holo tapes for level 6 and 7 but I couldn't find them again. Thanks!
---
Well it's a great thing it has both there, chum!
---
I don't think so, not 100% sure tho
---
Please never wear anything but the clown outfit.
---
This is true, only Hellfire was shown. I have two theories about this atm:
---
1. X-02 is a surprise for us, and we won’t actually see it until the full mode releases
---
2. Hellfire armor has been retconned to be designated as X-02, having been developed in a prototype stage after the X-01 but before the Enclave created their FO3-era armor.
---
I hear you on the nerves! I start fumbling with buttons, shaking the controller without even meaning to, and before I know it I'm using my wrist to run away 😂
---
One thing that's helped me - try spawning consistently in the same place - that way you get a hang of the general areas to look and loot. Oh! And make sure to check EVERY container picked up an automatic radium rifle from a suitcase, and a scoped rifle in a trash can; cigarette dispensers have been pretty good for meds for me as well.
---
Nah the last guy murdered me ): but it was fun and I felt accomplished
---
I have to say i wasn't too on board with the BR idea but after playing it I'm hooked especially Bethesda you give me some exclusive stash boxes or deco for my camp count me in!
---
:Q:can someone post a link to the a breakdown of the "upcoming rewards" that are displayed after game. Please forgive my ignorance of it was already posted and i missed it.
---
Ive win 5 games and been really close at a dozen times and each time it give me around 2k xp in adventure mode
---
If it’s culty to believe they deserved criticism, but not personal and professional attacks then maybe it is.  I think I was misunderstood a little.  I just posted one thing that was appreciative to a game company that had a rough year without posting something negative.  There are always plenty of negative things said without anything positive.  Some are deserved in critique, and others are just trash talk.  Is it so wrong to see people that kept working on something to make it better, and after they turn a real corner to say, “thanks” to the team?  Man, if redemption is not possible anymore then this world is gonna get pretty lonely pretty quick.
---
Idk but seems worth the wait, looks really fun and promising. However, I tuned into the top fo76 streamer at the time who was playing NW and he died in what had to be less than a minute about 5-6 times in a row, it was painful to watch. He was queuing up solo and always spawning near multiple people. Seemed really awful, but I assume will be fixed before the full release of NW.
---
Lol people like you praising Bethesda for actually doing what game studios are supposed to do after the crap they pulled is exactly why they don't care about backlash.
---
Sorry boss. It's a random drop from lvl3 safes and occasional explosive crates.
---
I’ve played two matches so far. It’s ridiculously fun. It far exceeded any expectations I had.
---
I pre ordered the game (the 80 dollar edition that comes with the skins). As much as I respect the people that still like this game all I would like is my $84.99 back (that was the price after tax).
---
grr I am at work now wont be able to try it for awhile- is the XP comparable to adventure mode grinding out scorchbeast kills? currently a full lap around all the fissures = 1 level (I am level 251) and I want a bunch of spare levels on hand for any changes I might need to make for the faction based stuff. I am by nature a guard dog so the faction based pvp is what I am interested in. the battle royale mode might be ok for leveling though if the xp is decent.
---
This is true of the main game as well.
---
I have atleast 1 for sale. Got it off a super mutant.
---
"Undeservedly". Na I'll stick with Todd thanking me for sticking by. I won't thank a freaking corporation for delivering a product I payed for months down the line. Beth is one of the last "entities" you should be thanking.
---
We are being sold out right now. If you haven't noticed. Tax cuts for the rich that we will get to pay for. Healthcare being destroyed by Trump and his enabler McConnell. Every bill passed in the house being trashed in the Senate without a vote. That's us being screwed. The bills don't have to pass but not considering them at all is kin to treason.
---
They're stash box skins in Adventure Mode
---
You just described Apex Legends. I am biased too, but the other direction. I really enjoyed Apex. Other games demanded more time so I had to prioritise but was fun while it lasted
---
The mode is coming back, this is just an early look at it. You’ll be able to grind your heart away then and they might even increase the amount of XP you earn for the full release
---
Just put the small one as a stash box at my camp
---
That was it.  Thanks.
---
Nice! I can’t wait to check them out
---
Democrats nare the ones making deals with the Koch brothers as we speak.
---
What’s your platform? Im PC.
---
IGN: roundyroundy
---
Love how i only play a few matches and already have kids meassaging me how im a bitch with no skills.
---
That was around before NW
---
Check your stash box menu in the build screen in adventure mode.
---
I have won around 5 as well and nothing is happening in adventure mode.
---
You have to learn the plan - just having the gun  is not enough to craft the ammo.
---
SBQ drop. Every time I did SBQ event I got a prime plan till I got all of them then they don't drop anymore ( from my experience).
---
&gt;I'm an idiot consumer cause I was happy to spend 60 bucks on this
---
I paid full retail as well and was happy to do it. I haven't regretted a single penny of it so far. I love Bethesda games.
---
Yeah I am a weird demographic for BR. I like them but only a few matches a week max then I move onto my staple games.
---
I keep getting stalemates because someone always drops the nuke and kills everyone at the end.
---
Random
---
Lol.  I friggin suck at this mode.  
---
Fun as hell though.
---
PC
---
IGN roundyroundy
---
I went and checked mine and I had another level up I could use but I did have alot banked so I could be mistaken
---
They already own the GOP. So what's new? It's politics as usual in Washington and someone keeps voting the same crooked politicians into office.
---
Power armor is a huge disadvantage.  You can’t hide and it’s easy to see and hit from far away.
---
Yea u gotta team up. Half the time no one speaks anyway but def need to have someone getting ur back or receiving u
---
Do this. I can confirm that this made it show up for me
---
Ok, I hear ya.  Not trying to argue, I just want to say how I see something here:  He says the metacritic thing, the gaming outlets title it “cash grab” or the first thing you said.  Except that is not what he said.  Hardly any outlet printed exactly what he said.  It’s a little different, not much...but a little.  Is it a lie? Is it the difference between a nylon bag and a canvas bag? If you told me in person “he admitted...” and didn’t use his exact words man, I am not gonna call you a liar.  I will understand what you were saying or that you don’t see a difference, etc... but it’s because even as a stranger, I wanna give you the benefit of the doubt.
---
You can level up and get caps for Adventure mode in another mode.  Adventure mode Specials carry over to BR.  I have an unfair advantage with my 9 point card equipped right now.
---
There is zero reason why these two modes should connect in anyway.
---
At least the rewards are account wide.
---
It's a special kind of alcohol you can craft
---
Just got done from a good playthrough
---
My thoughts: need more pve- the amount of creatures felt kind of pathetic 
---
Adding people to the party shouldn't gave me add them as friend first, it's going to clog up my friends list so fast.
---
Otherwise I thoroughly enjoyed this mode. More than I thought I was going to. Hated the idea of BR on fallout but its smooth in a fallout likeness. 
---
Cant wait to see the final product and all the updates that may come along in the future.
---
What does it do?
---
There is no Democrats and Republicans they are all selling us out. Fastest way to get rich in America is to become a politician.
---
They've said you need to get 4 code pieces as well as a briefcase
---
Appreciate the input. TY.
---
Ive actually been doing well which surprises me. Think i nuked him that round n thats why he got pissy
---
Had a smashing good time in there today, we just couldn't stop playing it.
---
Oops! Yes I'm in PC. Sent you a request
---
It's a different type of exploring, agreed. I'm just someone who prefers a slow exploration style, and I'm sure there are others who are the same. Especially since Bethesda clearly put a lot of time and work into making this staging area. The least they could do is let us appreciate it at our own pace.
---
And sometimes it's the fastest way to get from Fallout to Skyrim
---
It's a drink that gives really good benefits that you can learn to make and then make vintage which you always want to make it vintage because you end up somewhere crazy because you black out. Look at a wall in a trainstatiion and get the "attend the fraternity party" quest
---
Its probably just the hellfire based on the second thing you said, but god knows only what rank you unlock it at. Ive seen terminals that go up to rank 105
---
Yeah looks like they fixed the stomach
---
Small blue and yellow loot box from NW
---
They're player icons, not loot crates
---
I thought the atomic shop underarmor doesn't provide any benefits? It's just like the Vault 51 one that we have now...
---
You didn't watch E3 did you? 🤣
---
Huh sounds pretty interesting, thanks for answering :)
---
Same with my buddy - he's so into Vats I had to get into vats just to get a shot off before he killed enemies 😂 I'm actually really surprised he's enjoying it as much as I am. It's definitely been a learning curve for him, but after most of the day he's starting to match me in kills, even surpass me in some games. If you decide to stick with the game mode I know you'll find a way to overcome no vats. Best of luck if you do!
---
it buffs melee, then when it wears off it teleports you to a random location. Its a bit of a meme in the fo76 community to give them to low levels
---
No. Everyone begins in a vault 51 jumpsuit unless you have an outfit favorited in the atom shop.
---
I just wanna wake up in new Vegas
---
Yes but I mean the ones from atomic shop like the black elite one or tinfoil...
---
I dnt remember when i got it.. (Button spaming get me next match lol) but i read you get it lvl 5 OS rank it unlocks. Also i believe at lvl 10 you can pass through laser grids. There was a guy one lobby walking freely through them like in whitesprings bunker once you gain access.
---
Lmao
---
No argument there. Not that I haven't enjoyed our conversation but it's off topic for this Reddit. So before we get moderated I am stopping. And thanks for keeping it civil. That seems a little rare these days.
---
One day you just might.
---
PS4, sorry I forgot to add that
---
Hmm, I'm on Xbox
---
I guess we’re waiting for a match now?
---
It dies and is considered an Elite AI kill.   Taken out 3 so far.
---
Trust me, so am I. Sometimes it takes me 20 minutes to explore 1 building. But you literally have the entire game to explore at your leisure. I really like this fast paced one because it relies on my quick memory and action to do the exploring (which both suck btw). I really like that this one thing is different.
---
I personally believe getting PvP right is very complicated. I play Destiny2 and Warframe and both games have criticisms with PvP. 
---
The Division 1 did a good job for me but that took them a year or 2 to get right.
---
I am not thanking the entity, but those that worked on the game and continue to do so.
---
Literally the other day when making a new character I tried making a Jim Lahey looking character but it didn’t really work. Maybe I’m just not good at really knowing and utilizing the character creator.
---
Xbox one x
---
theres a terminal for lvl 81 so yeah prob
---
100% Agree. I get bored of all these Battle Royale games really easily, but the fact that this one actually helps me level up and gives me caps in adventure mode really makes it worth while. I think it's something I'll play whenever I have no quests to do and I don't feel like grinding levels by nuking the same place repeatedly. Also is it me or does the gun play feel so much better. I've been using that 50 Cal. Machine Gun and it's a monster. I've already won a game and had 8 kills in that one game. I'm actually having fun with this and it's great.   
---
Though I wish I could explore the Vault in adventure mode but I guess I can't complain much.
---
Can't really say that I hate anything about it. They made genuinely good design decisions for a change. On the minor stuff, the lobby delay is a bit long, perk cards too strong given how random they are, and the taken-damage indicator is too weak. I'm expecting it to get ruined by hackers on PC eventually, but time will tell.
---
Only using that tiny slice of map feels like a waste, but I imagine they'll add more of them later, and at least it has New River Gorge Bridge on it. Had one guy fall (or jump?) off it while I was shooting at him. Cracked me up.
---
that's fair enough I think - a global multiplier to all of your damage regardless of weapon is pretty amazing.
---
Everyone is going to say the Whitespring and WesTek and the Burrows while that's not necessarily wrong what you're going to end up with are a bunch of garbage 1\* legendary nocturnal wooden legs if you do that. Yes, sometimes you get a 3\* mob and maybe get good roll out of it but if you want something a little nicer you're gonna want to focus on horde events in the mire and the bog and maybe the divide. The big boss is almost always a 3\* mob and if you learn how to milk the horde boss you can start racking up the legendary kills.
---
They want you to farm or trade for higher level enemies. Upgrading weapons to higher level makes for a lot less grinding.
---
Check adventure mode.  Go to stash boxes in camp build menu.  You unlocked a stash box skin.
---
🤣🤣🤣 I play in a team and I still hide in the bushes because I'm a terrible shot. Lol
---
Love it!
---
Stop deep throating Todd and the devs
---
I’d like to team up with you on PSN. PSN is r_castro33
---
You unlock player icons, camp items, and nuclear wasteland perk cards. I think in much higher levels weapon skins too
---
I did not praise Bethesda, I praised the people who worked really hard there day in and day out.  It’s the difference between, like, ...probably the closest thing I could think of as far as an analogy goes would be the difference between a country and its people.
---
That makes no sense. Why does it matter?
---
It's strange, isn't it? I'm not really a fan of battle royale games or even pvp, but man... it's kinda fun.
---
I think it's much better than survival mode, too. Without players having a carefully selected arsenal of legendary items, pvp is actually fun.
---
It feels like a level playing field each time that in a way feels like the older Fallout games. Huh.
---
does it spawn in a crate or is it found lying some where
---
ya same experience here
---
I am level 250 I do not often go through the hassle of a silo run now days to get the queen, I cannot upgrade my weapon and I have already gotten everything from her that she is going to give me that I want. essentially if you're not after something only she can provide I have two better alternatives for you. oh also I have everything related to the flora stuff I need as well so nuke zones are not something I need anymore. 
---
If I want XP I just go from fissure to fissure killing scorchbeasts and their little armies. a full lap = 1 level. very little loot management or any of that business so its pretty fast and gives good chunks of XP. Takes about 30 minutes to an hour and a half depending on many variables.
---
If I want legendaries I go west tek harpers ferry ....robco and white springs. (white spring is not my favorite I find the loot not great and the mobs annoying. west tek is my favorite.
---
I didn’t touch either of those but I heard Sea of Thieves was rough
---
Nope. Not there either.
---
I'm lv 19 with 13 wins. It only gives 525 for placement, 310 if the game lasts about 20 mins, 100 per player kill and 20 per player down. You must be pushing 11 kills a game.
---
Thematically the perfect way to end a Fallout BR game. I don't think anyone had figured out how to use the nukes when I was playing earlier though.
---
There would definitely be a big lore on why and how they got in 79.
---
Like for example, they got scared of them getting demolished by the scorched.
---
Obviously making fun of people because they don't share your enjoyment is up there too.
---
You can find them on shelves
---
Surprisingly enjoyed it, even though ever cared or into battle royal.  Not too into it but I would play 1 or 2 matches once a while after a long playthrough of adventure mode.
---
I don’t know about a list of progression rewards but I can give you a list of TACO BELLS MOST TASTIEST TREATS u/TacoBellMenu
---
Do they make a sound like the large crates
---
Yeah, I dropped my external he's on my away at work xbox &amp; it took 24 hours to download again
---
First Skyrim Grandma got her well deserved NPC.. now lets get Fallout Grandma an NPC!
---
I totally agree.  Maybe I am missing something.  Do you think I do not believe that they deserved criticism?  I do.  I think they did not deserve the unfair criticism which is of a different genre.  So I totally agree with you.  I just wrote the post poorly lol.  Because I assumed, (yeah my fault there), that by writing undeservedly eviscerated people would not think I was taking about the criticism that was deserved...but the other part of it.
---
What does NW stand for?
---
Like, before entering v51 or after? Fill team must be on to invite? Thanks in advance.
---
No problem, happy slaying!
---
I was just in a game where the last circle was nuked
---
upload on youtube and post link here.
---
How do you send nuke? I managed to get maximaly 3codes.
---
Yes. Probably a wrongdoing on their part but nonetheless, the game is actually fun and not filled with extremely sweaty kids.
---
I'm definitely staying, I love it honestly. I also hate that you can't fast travel though. I haven't killed anyone though
---
I hope when the full mode is released we get all different portions of the map to play on (I kinda assume this will be the case).  Def just this is fun so far for sure tho
---
Unfortunately I can't answer that 😔 I don't pay attention to it all that much 😓 I can say I leveled up my 108 adventure character to 111 though, maybe 10-15 games..? It was definitely as if being a team player gave you more XP though. My buddy was a little selfish in the beginning - not healing people and had a hard time reaching overseer rank 4. While I hit that rank in just a few games by (I presume) healing teammates - beyond that one aspect there wasn't much differences in our gameplay.
---
I would certainly say give it a try and make it to the 10 minute mark, see how much XP you get, and see if you think it's a better use of your time than running fissures. I would vouch that it's more fun though 🙂
---
They did say NW/BR could go offline with little notice if things come up...hopefully that applies across the board.
---
It came with today's patch.
---
Will make the difference between pushing someone or not, if you're wearing wood and spot a marine, probably best to be cautious
---
Yes, but not by us.  We pay the company, and the company pays them.  If there was no middle man I would see your point.  But as there is, I personally don’t know what is required for that pay whether it be to act or say something in particular or work within the confines of a certain timetable/budget.
---
I gotta ask are you serious? I know there's a red-eye in Fallout Equestria but it's just by name right?
---
Angry Joe actually recognized that the game is getting better. So that’s a win! I left the game a while back but wastelanders has me excited. I hate BRs but nuclear winter is pretty fun!
---
Someone, please help it is Monday the 10th and I am trying to download the free trial of Fallout 76 on PlayStation but they are only giving me the option to purchase the game for half off even though it is in the free trial section.
---
Maybe they could implement it so that if you load into nuclear winter you just get put into the vault with some other people. Then from there you can initiate a match.  Kind of like the headquarters in call of duty: WW2.  That way you can explore the vault, set up your perks, practice at a shooting range, all before you even search for a game.  This could cut down the time before a match because you can just do all your stuff before you queue up
---
terminal for level 105 too.
---
Dumb question but does anyone know how you can wear outfits in the nuclear winter lobby?
---
Not enough..... our lads here are getting way too cold. Out of junk to make anymore campfires....
---
But your character level does, I had to start a new character on PC and I sunk a point into perception. Then when I went into nuclear winter, my SPECIAL levels were the same as adventure mode, so it does carry over, meaning you'll need to level your character in adventure or survival to use all of your perks.
---
my work life schedule complicates team related activities :(
---
Seriously though. It's like they're testing which game ends up with the most fans. Free trial week the same week br pre beta...🤔
---
Same thing happened with Battlefront 2. Game is pretty great now, always played good and progression has been completely turned around and fixed.
---
Nifty. I'm new to BR type games, so I have no idea wtf I'm doing lol.
---
I thought they were interested the Nw. I got gunned down by someone with an explosive shotgun
---
😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂
---
Some people just don't understand that you can't hate the player - you've gotta hate the game. For fact is, if the roles were reversed those kids would feel like kings 🤣
---
Thank you Kung Fu Man, very cool
---
He would have done the same 🤷‍♂️ Poor losers definitely know how to kill a good game victory high, or heck, even a kill high sometimes.
---
thanks. saved me having to wait 3 hours to download it on my laptop. my new character now has 700 weight to get rid of
---
You sound like you're just shit at games in general, lmao.
---
Not sure about that, but definitely player icons
---
Cross Progression would be awesome. I'd love to play on PC and xbox
---
I was level 32 after 7 games with 3-5kills and one win i was level 34. My gf was 14, was playing with me, also got few kills and after those 7games she was 16lvl. For lowbies it is good, cause you get 10-50xp per mob. It is well balanced.
---
If they’re your friends they should respect you asking them straightforward. That’s the first step I feel between making this post. Although I can understand where you’re coming from.
---
TLDR; Player Vending,3 New Storylines ,sheepsquatch and imposter sheepsquatch(new endgame bosses),Brewing alcohol and drinks,2 new dungueons (burrows and greentec i think),for a week a really fucking fun BR(and I hate battle royale lol) New camera with its own storyline.Backpacks (up to +90 carry weight max) quests for those as well. And much more also LOTS OF BUGS FIXED
---
WHEW I was so frustrated when I spawned, and had no freaking clue what to do. Now, I'm not great at PVP but I know enough to get by. Thing is, glitches will get you. Like the aim down the sights not releasing when you need it to! That got me killed. 
---
But yeah it's fun. You got a lot of stuff going on to make your heart beat really fast! I thought it was more exciting than Survival mode to be sure. I just wish we could skip the lobby part where all the level 2s are running around punching everything ! I also wish we could get the sleep &amp; musical buffs...but whatever. it's fun. I liked it. I had a stellar team though-- I think that helped tremendously. I won the match. With their help.
---
What if two guys plays on same account? Why you need same rank on all chars?
---
You hear 'em Randers?
---
The shit-hawks...
---
&gt; -It's not a completely separate set, but a 'paint'. Meaning that you can apply it to any power armor set.
---
so you are saying you can make a t-45 look like hellfire? sounds strange as it does more than just change the paint like most skins
---
PS4 as well.
---
Theyre icons. Its not a loot crate. Go to the atom shop to equip them. Same goes for the weapon skins. one of them is placable in your camp as a stash box.
---
Do whatever wanna do
---
Kovac Muldoon drop pods would be waaaaay cooler, just sayin...
---
im not new but its going away? :(
---
Its freaking battle royale. You literally have 2 seconds to decide no matter what armor they are wearing. What weapon they have matters more than their armor. My friend was wearing no armor with a gatling and people still attacked him.
---
Great to hear you're having fun with it despite the vats 😁 The kills will come - I've noticed grenades are pretty good if you have at least 1 teammate. One Aggros them into a corner and the other lobs a grenade.... I haven't successfully done this yet as I always forget about grenades... but it's definitely been done to me and my buddy a few times.
---
As for fast traveling - I know my luck would make me burn in the ring of fire 😂
---
Yup, I won with a surviving teammate also.
---
Yes, xbox. I was getting "Disconnected from server" immediately after the loading screens of fast travel or going indoors. It was also rolling me back as well.
---
To fix it, I logged in, ran to a nearby location and logged out (no fast travel.) When I logged back in I could fast travel and go indoors again.  Don't know if this info helps, you could try logging out before another disconnect and see if it helps?
---
You get an icon and a stash box skin
---
I would rather we all just rush out of vault 51 like a stampede.
---
Just figured it out, thanks anyways!
---
Vats should be closing after you make a kill or when out of LOS
---
Totally. No matter the company PvP will always be difficult. Playing R6 Siege alot and other popular FPS theres always something people find to complain about.  Never played Div 1 or 2. 
---
Im just glad that they have a really solid base here with Nuclear Winter. Something about it being not influenced by twitch views and esports makes its super casual in practice.  When I play Apex, PUBG, etc. I tend to get triggered, (prolly cause I'm trash) not so much here in Fallout BR.Sure some people will be sweaty. But its just an all around good time. 
---
As long as this game mode keeps this casual feel for me Ill keep playing.
---
So are you telling me that you know when you're taking damage on Nuclear Winter? You've never just been getting shot and didn't realize you were getting shit because your character doesn't react to it?
---
I just did this exact thing, but lied about what it was. I said it was a free level-up that was super rare, and that lights start to explode when you drink it to celebrate. I had 3 made. One person took it and ran without drinking (Godspeed, my man). A second took it, drank it, but didn't have a mic. They ended up between the a Fissure Site and Firebase LT. They managed to get back to the Vault themselves without my help.
---
Third guy had a mic. I gave the speech, he took the Nukashine, drank it, and I just said "Welcome to Fallout 76." He starts reacting to the color changes and spins in circles for a little while and then vanishes. Lucky for him, he spawned a short walk away from the Whitespring Bunker, so I was able to run to him and explain what I did, and how to get back to his area without spending the few caps he had. He was laughing the whole time, it was great.
---
From what I read regarding the BETA, we will have to create a new character and start fresh.
---
Someone who is home, check pipboy if time have mooved.
---
Is there currently anywhere to view these stats at all?
---
YOu find turrets and stuff in containers. The turrets can be 'built' like in the regular game but you dont need materials, they'r just ready to drop turrets. You set 'em down and go. Same with defensive walls-- they're those huge concrete walls which is cool. 
---
But yeah you can build a real camp and put down all the stuff you want but you will probably get it eaten up by the fire
---
Haha sounds like my normal session, perma crouched to take advantage of sneak and vats crit. So im guessing there wont be any builds on this mode? I was planning on taking my junkie build for it. 
---
That build was born in survival, whacking everyone with a lead pipe wearing nothing but his undies lol! 
---
But thanks for the tips!
---
I’ll do that thanks mate 
---
Idk, i just found 3 codes early in the match, then we killed a team and in their bodies it was a briefcase, I realized I only needed one more code and I quickly started searching creatures cuz they have a high chance of dropping them
---
Found one crab and and I opened my pip boy, searched the briefcase and I marked the nuke zone 
---
Bad English sorry
---
Can't tell when I'm getting shot at, my character doesn't react to getting damaged and I end up dying.
---
Console?
---
Grahm.
---
"Alright, everybody in, pay us."
---
Todd Howard
---
Yayyyyyyyyy
---
Happened to me on PC
---
Lol that’s funny I just canceled my Fo76 installation to install all three Metro games about 10 mins ago. I want to enjoy 76 but NW not having solos looks painful, and I can’t deal with anymore bugs on top of the ones that may never be fixed. Last update I was excited, reinstalled and the first two workshops I claimed both bugged out on the first defense mission with enemies not spawning or spawning stuck inside of something.
---
:'( Dang, that ranged weight one would've been so nice.
---
I only have one character he is level 250...something. I keep thinking he is complete and fully finished but I always end up adjusting / tweaking, currently considering a stealth explosive heavy gun build. ( thinking stealth nukes for faction based pvp in the future) probably would be ten to 20 more levels just unlocking the perks and moving special around a tad, if I hate it then I will have to put it back where I was.....I cannot justify building a new character because you're not just starting over on gear you're starting over on all the plans you have unlocked etc. every time I try to make an alt and leave my main I run into something stupid like not having a fusion generator at a workshop or being unable to upgrade something etc and its always easier for me to just tweak my main than start from scratch.
---
I've been playing since the Beta and dispite it's faults I enjoy the game. Yes I'm well aware that it was flawed but I enjoy it. Plus it's a much better game now
---
Few games this morning, it's good and I enjoyed it.
---
Its not what I want from fallout which is a game I seek to explore and find all the hidden stories but they've put out a fun BR mode
---
? Why is that happening? For my Xbox its just asking 2.84 GB to download through network?
---
Id suggest going to Bethesda.net and reading the past Patch notes to get full details. Dont blame if you if you dont. Its alot of reading.
---
The crates are player icons in the atomic shop. Other than that, you get perks and xp.
---
That would be awesome :)
---
seems to have fixed itself but this is odd to be happening.
---
I want that X-02 Armor Tho!
---
On the plus side my lvl30 rocket launcher went fro 190 something to 234 when i logged in today...
---
Loving it
---
Maybe just read the other 354235535 topics about rewards today
---
Cool, thanks for explaining.
---
You get a free one every day. From t-45s till, X-01.
---
How do you make a catapult?
---
Yay
---
I had to completely close my game and reopen it for it to appear in the atom shop so I could equip it for nuclear winter
---
Its listed as an add on for the game.
---
I've never played socially. Tonight I made three new "friends," lol. Hats off to Bethesda, I feel so much more comfortable playing with randos now. I am the chronically level 19 player running away from all the team/trade invites before now.
---
Got 3 codes and the case so far.
---
And the history behind the vault and its dwellers is a nice touch!
---
Oof sorry I offended you guy
---
I get critisism from both friends and family just for owning the game and talking about it.
---
If you've got time for a fissure run, you've got time to stim a couple randoms 😉 I can get you a XP number for sure tomorrow when we play again no problem - I need to get my daily caps and scrip still 😅 That way it won't funk too much with your schedule, and you won't have to waste your time trying it out - instead focusing on the guarantee level.
---
Ah, this irrelevant fuck that's also a cuck.
---
Pls no, I need to go wash now...
---
I am hoping to find this out as well
---
I was wondering this too. Then I stumbled upon a display with a new set of power armor holding a statue and a badass knight helmet. I don't know if they're available yet but they sure are cool
---
Did you really understand what I tried to say? Or it was confusing?
---
You mean the people who can now buy the game for 1/3 the price rather than extend BGS an 8mo 0% apr advance on a playable game?
---
Yeah, lol at them....
---
It is a lot of fun- only two wins so far but exciting!
---
Then that gives you an unfair advantage over other players and its not a battle royale, its just survival mode in a small map with a fire storm surrounding you.
---
I've never really dug any other battle royale type game but I'm having fun with this, probably because I like my character and it still feels like Fallout.  The fact that, other than perks, everyone starts on the same level is really appealing.
---
It's funny how some matches I get smoked immediately, and others I do really really well, even winning one.  It's probably a 90/10 ratio, lol, but when I do well I wonder how I'm doing anything differently than the matches where I die instantly.  Finding an automatic or sniper rifle early helps a TON.  I don't know if it's because I'm so used to those during normal play.  If I have an SMG, shotgun or heavy gun, I'm useless.
---
A BR with all the legendary gear and perks and mutations would be amazingly imbalanced. It's basically a test of gear not skill.
---
Theres so much. Stash size increase to 800 lbs. 
---
Scortchbeast lands more often now so you can actually hit it with melee attacks. You can capture frogs and put them in jars around your camp. You can brew alchohol and drink it, black out and wake up in a random location on the map. You can also sell things in your own personal vending machines at your camp now too. Theres a lot thats changed. Its totally playable now.
---
Finaly we can find build to fuck her down.
---
Strangely enough it still says 10.23.2102 on mine
---
Stealth vats rifle is OP. Buffing it would be insane. My level 150 rifle drops almost anything in one shot.
---
IT is pretty fun, which surprised me. I expected it to be pretty boring something to play through when have a minute or two.... then I spent the last 4 hours playing it.
---
hmm, ok thanks. Yeah i don't really want to lose all that but i just remember it being really buggy going through the game and since you can't repeat quests maybe it would be cool, but i guess it isn't that important
---
Ye i did understand :) your english isn't as bad as mine, don't worry :D
---
I could swear I recently got shot up by a guy that I didn’t instigate at all and the only thing that would have allowed him to do so was that I was not in passive. Also, there have been a few times where me or my friend needed to hurt the other to get a challenge and we always can first shot long as we are not in passive mode. So in my experience it seems you are the one wrong here. But I cannot test it to make sure right now as I am across country from my PS4 and will be for the next two weeks. If I remember I’ll ask my friend to let me experiment when I get back.
---
Fake news
---
Yeah I was actually pretty annoyed that they jumped on the Battle Royale bandwagon but it's surprisingly very fun. Like I've played like 10 games today.
---
yeah, two times in a row here with a big rollback seemed very odd to me too
---
I also have a vega 64 and just tried to play this game again and am experiencing the same issue
---
Oh yeah, Bethesda, the company behind horse armor and paid mods would never have anything but the best planned for consumers. It's just a complete accident that they continue to try and milk their player base like literal cash cows.
---
Lvl 10 has a picture of an overseer chair that looks like camp furniture
---
They’d probably take the laws of physics to the Supreme Court, get them overturned, then set up an off-shore shell company on the Sun’s surface. Then they’d charge NASA 8 Million per hour and demand a retainer for the next 5 Billion years, or until the Sun runs out of hydrogen and goes super nova.
---
They’d call their new Solar Law firm “Sun and Sons” or “Better Call Sol”.
---
TLDR: I need a life.
---
Sounds awesone, not the unfair advantage..but ive just spent a lot of time getting my armor and weapons. Would love to use it in a royal mode. Just not my thing i guess
---
They are! I am like lvl 5 and I have the small blue stash box unlocked in the atom shop
---
Shame.
---
more concerned with life interruptions.  I have to go afk a lot I don't see me being able to do that in BR mode. how long are the matches on average?
---
Me too lol
---
Pretty sure there will be / are builds ;)
---
I appreciate it mate
---
Why?
---
I wish i could give you plat just for this simple comment.
---
What the fuck is wrong with you lmao, you seem to have confused 76 with anthem.
---
I guess it would be imbalanced but its the same in survival. Just not my game i suppose
---
Wondering why I would get down voted for pointing out a bug. Guess some people just don't gety
---
Dude this is incredible what the fuqqqq
---
But do your perks and attributes actually affect your player in NW?
---
That is absolutely hilarious 😂 I knew they had to fall off something when it says 'so-so died' instead of killed by. This makes me want to stay under the bridge 🤣
---
I agree completely with all of the criticism. It actually makes me wonder if the info in Vault 51 will only ever be accessible during that 1-3 min wait?
---
To be fair the Chinese stealth armor in New Vegas would be more fair as it was cosmetic only. Having a armor that generates a stealth field like in fallout 3 less likely to be in game
---
"extremely sweaty kids" - wtf?
---
In my instance experience there's usually a helpful team member that grabbed the ammo but not the gun
---
might have to make a new character and play through the story again and see how it goes
---
I think those may become available at higher levels of overseer cuz Beth did say there were some new ones IIRC
---
I was surprised
---
I would say my only gripe is weapon swap time, and I can't listen to country roads as I'm geting gunned down but yeah it's really fun
---
You know those guys.
---
I agree completely.  I've never been much for pvp games, but the fact that the matches are quick and everyone starts on equal footing makes dying immediately not too annoying.  Aside from having to queue back up and wait for another match, it's fine.
---
I'm honestly surprised that I'm having as much fun as I am.
---
No stats pre upgrades, I think it's just not implemented as a oversight
---
I like it too. But only if i,play with friends. Randos with no mics suck ass
---
I mean you might have considered me a hater at launch because I hated it. It's a bit more fun now though so I'm playing it and enjoying it.
---
You can, much like you can with the Plague Rider skin even though that one is clearly a X-01 styled set.
---
I really want it too
---
how much?
---
More talking when sneaking with a scope or something? Where you get the choose of fighting or sneaking away, I think I'd prefer cosmetics but can see the use of it, like you say though not useful every engagement
---
Nah, you lose nothing. But you do gain caps and experience that transfer to your PVE and PVP character. I got 50 caps for a 1 in 1 K/D, and 7 min survived, for one match. Gotta say, I was pretty happy even though I got my shiny power-armored ass handed to me.
---
Watched a top streamer on mixer die within the first minute about 5-6 games in a row, it was painful just to watch. I canceled the download, I’ll wait for solo NW &amp; NPCs lol.
---
I wouldn't worry. After the free week I really doubt people are going to be buying 76 just to play BR.
---
Oh sweet! I'll be trying it out when i get home, but 1st i gotta say hi to all the newbies coming out of the vault, im sure they will be thirsty from them rushing out of that vault door so ill be waiting outside for them with a backpack full of nukashine!
---
The rewards get better after lvl 10
---
You do realize Apex and Fallout 76 are different games?
---
I just like to watch my team but I don’t think you miss out on anything by leaving
---
Yeah I uset gift emote when i was givin teammate some supplies i didn't needed. Then we was attacked by wild granades. When everything exploded i saw gift emote in distance. Thanks for this gift, really awesome.
---
Ill see if i still have in the morning n let ya know
---
No. While it shows that characters special number, only one perk card is playable at a time, regardless of points in a specific special.
---
Anything worth noting behind level 10? If no spoilers are allowed feel free to dm
---
my entire twitter feed has been filled to the brim with blind hate for fo76. mocking them for doing literally exactly what everyone wanted in the new update, mocking the genuinely good BR mode, just mindless "BETHESDA BAD. FALLOUT 76 BAD. CDPR GOOD." bullshit, post after post. they even overran jokers_trick!
---
If if someone stole my wallet and it had $60 in it, i couldn’t imagine telling everyone about it 6 months later lol.
---
Ok I wont be on till the weekend
---
The only time you see them is after the match.
---
I can see the ammo in the container.  I'll grab it along with the corresponding gun, equip the new gun and have 00/000 ammo.  It's like I took the ammo but it failed to appear in my inventory.  It almost always happens with the second gun I pick up, no matter what it is.
---
Lol nice! I ended up trying it for a while and gotta admit, the risk/reward is bad ass. Still get XP, still get caps, etc. and you don’t lose anything. It’s bad ass.
---
it's not really the journalists so much as shitbags like skillup who blindly rant about it on twitter. jim sterling just made a "post mortem" video on fo76, even though it's literally been improving every fucking patch. don't even get me fucking started on juicehead.
---
Kinda dumb. Should at least get a bonus if your team wins and sticking with them
---
I do not miss the days of having super shit internet. Count yourself lucky that you can at least download the game in half a day before they ran good internet down my road it would have taken me over a week nonstop to download 76.
---
Now do you go in with all your perks?
---
I like it but man do I suck. I feel like when I shoot people, no matter the gun, they have time to run and hide, when I get shot, even in PA once, I drop like a bag of rocks faster than I can even react, let alone stimpack or hide. Not sure what I’m doing wrong.
---
It's fun I already played it for 2 hours straight and haven't gotten bored
---
Cool
---
Do you get the 525 exp like #1? I had one drop on me, nuke stripped me naked when I fell over.
---
If that was what he actually said without saying the part that came before that quote, I would totally understand the vitriol that quote received...lol
---
I hope bethesda reads this. But some atomic shop items need to be disabled for nuclear winter once in game.  
---
Yellow flight helmet + survivalists outfit = easy to hide in bushes and vegetation meaning an in game advantage from the atomic shop.   
---
Though I wouldn't be opposed to said items being added as an armor "survivors armor" which has almost no DR and some color swaps to make it slightly easier to spot.
---
You mean haters as in a minority of trolls, right? Because I was one of the people utterly underwhelmed with the BETA, and now things have improved, and even before we knew Wastelanders was NPCs, I've paid my money when it met my baseline expectations of a consumer product and I'm getting my enjoyment out of it. I'll never say it was handled well, or even a good idea when we could have had Wastelanders from the start, because even Todd isn't arguing that mistakes weren't made. Trying to neatly file anyone who was critical into a file not far from 'my mortal enemy' isn't productive or helpful, and dropping a post that is the equivalent of waiting outside 76 and dropping (1) Bulk Fertilizer isn't going to mend rifts in the fandom. Not attacking you, just making a observation.
---
Look out for bad players and just try to be a nice guy. In my experience, most players are cool so just try to be cool back to them.
---
Do I need PS+ to play the free week on PS4?
---
That's how it works in every game mode, and BTW the stealth boy hides your red dot too
---
Hate to say it but I doubt this will happen, we brought this exact issue up, and the fact other outfits are an unfair penalty (space suit etc) but they were comfortable with some subtle choices being there for the players
---
You can equip atomic shop items? How?
---
I just started this about 30 minutes ago and I've been just stuck with my jumpsuit
---
Still scares me, though I guess I will use the advantage while I can.
---
Positioning is everything in BR games. If you dont have the gun skill there are plenty of way to outthink enemies in these games. Just always try to think ahead.
---
 Ask yourself questions about where you are on the map compared to the circle. Where could other teams be? 
---
Sticking together is big in this game because of the fast TTK so use the buddy system. 
---
Always assume their is a enemy around the corner and youll nevee get caught off guard when you do see one.
---
Natural cover is your best friend. Use them to move between locations so your never in a open field with no where to run to. 
---
Think like Obi-Wan Kenobi and stick to the high ground. 
---
Other than simple coms will get your very far with solid teamplay.
---
Congrats on the first W and hope you find your way to many more.
---
Not sure why leveling was a problem, but basically no, it’s the same game just with a little more of the same. Less people play, hence the free week.
---
Stash got increased, but again, it’s just going to be a constant issue if it was for you then.
---
In atomic shop scroll to an item you have and look at the key options bellow.
---
You won't be able to do most of the new content with a new character (unless you have help), so I'd say stick with your main. Unless it's an Event I'd suggest avoiding fast travel when doing the quests, Appalachia is more fun when you walk through it as apposed to teleporting around the map.
---
I think they're player icons
---
I hate that I headshot somebody with a sniper and it only takes half of their health when it should be a instant down if you get shot in the head
---
I got disconnected many many times today in adventure mode but not in NW, strange how that works.
---
Nay
---
Ps4 
---
Willwill04
---
Suggestion was made during alpha, and also that some thinks auto-assign (but can be changed) to the favorites to make things faster
---
Unless it was the kind of radiation that could penetrate the suits
---
I know how that goes. Thankfully average is about 20 minutes from what Bethesda says. My personal average is 15 maybe? Sometimes you get 30 people deciding to spawn in the exact same place, but thankfully Beth put in counter measures to prevent spawn killing. Really just boils down to asking yourself - do you want loot? Or do you want to live to see the house down the road to see if it has loot??
---
Total transparency here - I was forced to go AFK 4 times today thanks to business calls, and I'm not even mad about it. Neither were my random teams because they all went off on their own. Even my buddy was alright with it and went on to see how long he could last.
---
Awesome, thanks for the info! 
---
I tried to search around before asking but didn't find much on if the early game had been changed at all.
---
Well if we were in the same game, thanks alot for killing me.
---
Were you using a super-sledge with the rocket attachment?  It makes an annoying sound, one of the reasons why I switched to a super-sledge with the spikes mod.
---
Also, players with weapons that have electrical mods will make crackling sound.
---
[Alot](http://i.imgur.com/BOw8s.png)
---
This subreddit fucking triggers me, if you try to go again sheeps, you gonna get downvoted pretty bad. 
---
You are right sir!
---
Its BR. It could just do the same damage as the fire
---
Exactly, there are only avatar icons , also you can win stash boxes for adventure mode but only that
---
Sorry lmao. a lot*
---
This is an early preview, it will go away but will come back permanently in the future.
---
Literally witnessed the concern in their eyes when we got the PlayTest it; it's a labor of love and it shows
---
You only get the XP for what you play not what you watch. You don’t need XP for supervising
---
Next time you log in it will give you the option to play the three different modes. You didn't get the option before because you didn't have a character.
---
Thanks for this, because i was about to buy one just for this.
---
No it just does damage like all the other rings in the 40 other BR games out there
---
Pretty sure you can turn off party mode and go solo before you login to the server with the "Fill Party" option.
---
Never liked BR either, tried a bit of BO4 blackout and disliked it. I've been playing this almost all day. I'm enjoying the progression and the fact that I'm not risking any of my gear doing this. Disappointing that people on PC have already found ways of cheating though, I stumbled upon two people teleporting 15 feet per second in the past hour, and one of them almost definitely had aimbot.
---
Early game hasnt changed much at all other the QOL improvements. 
---
Morgantown Airport did however recieve a facelift inside of the building a few patched back so if you care to see go and check it out.
---
You can hide in the bushes in a bright blue vault suit edged in gold as well
---
 I'm unable to use a card that takes 3 points in any one trait, since I only have one point leveled
---
Just happened to me too
---
Sweet! I just wanna rock my cowboy hat and bandana lol
---
I agree that trying out different weapon types has been fun.  My two characters are rifle-based and two handed melee based, so I've never really messed around with shotguns, grenade launchers and heavy weapons.  It's interesting to try them out.
---
The one thing I miss is my suppressor on a sniper rifle.  I feel like I'm making **so much noise** in NW mode, even though stealth is a non-issue.  LOL
---
I did get killed by one guy in a match, being one of the last 3 left and watched him after he dusted me.  I don't know if he got lucky and acquired the chameleon mutation, or it's some kind of new perk card, but he handily won the entire match by crouching on top of a rocky outcropping near the center of the ring and picked off everyone who came near.
---
Aww. Not a fan of BR? Did you give it a go?
---
No arguments here, last I knew headshots meant instant death 🤷‍♂️ Instant down would be gracious.
---
I think it's Mergal the cat hiding in there,lol
---
[Here’s the video](https://youtu.be/gmBDQOFAIRU) 
---
Check if that was us lol
---
For all y’all jumping back in did you start a new character or keep playing with your old one? Is it worth playing through from the beginning again?
---
Exactly id be too similiar to Survival and it wouldnt be a BR it would just another PVP gamemode. 
---
Dont worry I highly doubt this is the only gamemode we will get for PvP stuff.
---
it was fun, it played better than I expected. Only thing that I am like WTF, and I understand why is done like that but damn why is everything lvl locked. I dont want to spend my time having to play BR to find out the lore or anything that happened inside vault 51.
---
Lol I aint no sheep brotha I know ima get down voted lol popular opinion is fckn dumb
---
Yeah Apex was great when everyone was still casual. It is getting a little too competitive for my casual approach to BR :)
---
Nuclear winter LOADING SCREENS, Finally a game that really lets you wait and wait and wait.
---
But seriously can we fix this game-play is slow and LOADING SCREENS take way to long,
---
Also why am i not returned to lobby after the game ends?
---
why am i returning to the main menu?
---
Lol
---
One of the major essential flaws with the game is that it tried to be all things to all people - hybrid PvP/PvE that satisfies neither, multiplayer but single player just as viable, etc...
---
Doubling down on what is at this point, and should have been from the jump, over arching design flaw is not a good sign.
---
But you’ll never get the piggies to acknowledge it *shrug*.
---
I honestly don’t know but I know I leveled up so I assume it was still quite a good amount.
---
Oh relax, pull that participation trophy out of your ass and maybe you could enjoy a game
---
Shoot her wings and cripple them, tie her up and stick your pee pee in her. That is how you fuck down the SBQ.
---
Yep, I was reviving my friend while I was in power armor, instead of making me revive my friend it kicked me out of the power armor and froze my game
---
My friends that are all close friends know this. But, my friends list expands to friends of friends that I’ve played with and had a great time with and looser acquaintances, etc..
---
No such luck. My left hand isn't fully functional and the controller's a little old … the sticks like to move on their own form time to time. 
---
Aiming's just not in  my toolbox.
---
Automatic handmade not good for you? Need that explosive laser huh
---
Grats.. You're probably better than you think. I got on a lame streamers team and he wouldn't revive. I'm at least as good as that guy, caught with a board vs gun on landing. I seen oxhorn after dying on one team, spectating my teammate. You want to see someone who's good, watch grimmmz on twitch. He owned 10 guys right at the beginning of the match, makes you feel like a chump.
---
Yeah, its not like there is a giant red triangle floating over enemies.
---
Hmm... only if there was a tactical way to get the msg to them...
---
I see what you did there. I too consume  Nuka Cola.
---
I'm not feeling it for BR either but I haven't tried it yet, as a general rule though I just see no point to those sorts of matches. the up coming faction based stuff is interesting to me though. a good long term war against an entire faction. that's more my thing I am a guard dog by nature so having a designated enemy is critical for me to enjoy pvp.   UO Archers guild of vesper anti pk protecting noobs at the bank, WoW alliance druid flag runner extraordinaire war-song gulch (peeps were like feral druids suck at pvp I was like hold my beer went bear form cat form ate them all the end cool story bro.) and all around bger. gw2 engineer home map defender of mother fn flame throwing doom in wvw ( peeps were like FT isnt viable in pvp I was like hold my beer "aaaah it burns it burns"and they all died the end cool story bro.) 
---
   All those things had a long term objective, I had to get my butt kicked a lot before I figured everything out but it was cool. if they can offer me that in the future factions expansion I will probably live in faction based pvp land. if it gets created . which I think it will but I am prepared for disappointment. Welp thats about as many run on nonsensical sentances as I can fit into one paragraph.. my work here is done :D
---
Give you things to work towards I guess. It sucks for the person who doesn't want to play BR at all, that is true.
---
It’s so you can read the terminals and listen to the holotapes..?
---
Only floats over AI's  and enemies that are not crouched.
---
No I haven't played nuclear winter yet, that random damage bug was a adventure mode thing, but who knows what bugs came with nuclear winter, it's a online only game
---
and after you read them&gt;?
---
Not that well.
---
*ba dum tiss*
---
I’ve taken to using a piece of paper. I’ve got 13 dammit!
---
People have told me they are cosmetic items in adventure but I dont think this is true
---
Yeah i dont think so either unless i have to open them somehow first. I cant find them in any menu
---
And then don't look at your map until you make your way home.
---
Yes! Finally someone to talk to.
---
No
---
Seriously. And not because of some virtuous reasons, it's just that any free to play games always invite bazillion toxic cellar crawlers for some reasons and this game doesn't need any more of that.
---
I just went to West-Tek and did my "unofficial" testing on the dummies there.
---
I knew my instigating hunting rifle was pretty beastly, but holy shit I had no idea until I saw the actual numbers.  I'm curious to link up with my buddy that plays a bloodied unarmed build to hear what his numbers look like.  He can take out the Encryptid boss with 5-6 hits.
---
It would be nice to have more melee animations, and maybe the ability to swipe through multiple enemies after a certain damage threshold or something.
---
They’re icons and stash box skins - not actual crates
---
And you just resolved the plot of War Games. 
---
“How about a nice game of chess?”
---
You can do Nukashine stuff at low levels, and can do most of Laying Lowe, but need to be leveled and have other people to do the final quest for it. Most of the other stuff you're going to want the resources of a leveled character for. Starting a new character in this game is more for the joy of creating a new build.... But keep in mind that given enough time you can transition an existing character into a completely new build if so desired.
---
They're just icons in the Atom Shop
---
You get icons first and then at the higher ranks you unlock the camp items for the crates
---
Some are player icons and others are stash box skins
---
Ah thank you very much for the help
---
That would be more fun if we get a few other mechanics for group stuff to allow melee to tank.
---
No problem
---
How?
---
You can... turn off the auto fill feature and it is free for all
---
I got super lucky and found the briefcase right away, and quickly found three nuke cards. Then I got the Chameleon mutation, found a fourth card and nuked one of the final circles so I was in the only survivable area and won.
---
I felt like a jackass just wiping out the last few teams fighting it out, but it was so satisfying.
---
Oh okay thanks
---
You haven’t missed it! Not here just yet!
---
Nope.  I’m familiar with the jet sound of a supersledge though,  this was very much a sizzling sound.
---
I was wondering about this, as a vats sniper. Any hard proof that it **does not** increase damage on each vats kill? In other words, does having to re-engage vats cancel the benefits of the perk, or are you just re-engaging vats, but still getting a damage buff?
---
About 99% of the time it disengages vats for me after I down a target. But I remember *one* instance where two super mutants were one in front of the other, and it did auto-swap to the next target.
---
So maybe your aim has to be relatively close to the next target? I’m sure it will get fixed, in the mean time maybe we can try out different AGI cards in Gun Fu’s place 🤷‍♂️
---
I think Dad needs job
---
I mean, my build has over 400 dr/er, I’m not saying that I don’t still soak up damage, but if I was in a team with someone with more charisma perks/healer I would be invincible.
---
I rarely play (level 70 or so), but do a bats pistol build. It’s ok against humanoids, even Yao Guai - but it’s fucking useless against anything bigger or harder.
---
Replying to the top comment just so future googles can see:
---
I tried the game on launch with a heavily overcloked gtx1070 and an i7 7600k and while the game would maintain a mostly steady 60fps at 1080p, there was severe hitching and stuttering, much like fallout 4. Fallout 4 has iFPSclamp ini hacks to fix the stuttering, but Fallout 76 does not as far as I know.
---
Fortunately, after trying the game it seems the stuttering is no longer an issue. Perhaps it was a driver thing, but it's playable on my system now. The game overall is still very choppy due to multiple issues that can't be fixed with mods (such as stutter while sprinting) but it's nothing game ruining, especially if you aren't looking for it. The game is equal to xbox one now as far as frame timing goes (obviously if you can hit 60fps it'll be better but that's beside the point). I imagine this is different for every single system, much like Fallout 4 - which my main PC still stutters without hacks and is much less smooth than the xbox one verison.
---
If you go to adventure mode you can go to the atom shop. Then go to icons and you can scroll down to see the ones you have unlocked. If you go to your camp you will see new stash boxes unlocked if your high enough rank. I’m 6 so I guess it unlocked at 5. It’s the small loot box but it’s pretty cool. I’m assuming at the next couple ranks you can craft the bigger boxes.
---
Thanks for detailed guilde. lol
---
I'm enjoying it as well. It does feel remarkably balanced. I'm curious if they'll switch regions from time to time, so it keeps a fresh appeal.
---
FEED THE PEOPLE!
---
Dungeons and Dragons Online actually has training dummies you can place on a guild's airship.  They show you damage numbers, but the health regens back to full after absorbing maybe 50,000 points of damage.  It's kinda like when an unkillable friendly (Grahm for example) gets downed, but his health eventually regens.  
---
It seems like something pretty easy to implement, seeing as it already exists for vendors, although I don't know the first thing about coding.
---
Good thing no one cares.
---
What did you unlock when you got to 10? Did you get the cool statue? Or the helmet or anything?
---
Yea ive done 5 rounds now. Just not my thing
---
Yeah I was running into the VATS issue too. For awhile it looked like VATS would only let me get one head shot before closing out without killing the Super Mutants I was shooting at.
---
Switched to targeting Torso and it seemed to not close randomly afterwards.
---
I totally feel that. I have a few weapons that I keep a little pricey in my vendor for that same reason.
---
yes it sure did gave us more things to do, but damn thats a hell off a grind. 
---
us (possum challenges are a bitch)
---
BGS= oh you think thats a bitch hold my beer. NW everything lvl locked. lol
---
What Platform?
---
On the Playstation I set my online mode in the PS4 profile menu to appear offline, turn off the system for a bit, then go back in.  I then launch Fallout 76 and set the "block for session" for all of my online friends.  Most of the time they don't discover that I am online because they rely on the Playstation status, not the Fallout status, to find me.  But, yeah, the feature to hide from your friends needs work.
---
I agree, there are just times that you want to do your own thing.  I like to role play as a sniper from time to time but doing it in a group just doesn't have the same feel to it...
---
Why is this downvoted, homie is giving his honest opinion and being respectful about it
---

If you don't mind a humble hater giving his opinion. I will not redownload because it should have been at launch not a year later.  I am super glad people are enjoying the game and that the game has been mostly fixed. I don't want this fix it in post attitude to be acceptable anymore so hard pass on coming back.
---
Hope they take all they learned from FO76 and use it on the next installment.
---
Make party while everyone is on main menu. Then queue.
---
Yeah I'll give it another go. It just seems so superficial and pointless i guess. The nuclear fire "time control" kind of rushes things a bit too much... ends up just being a coin flip to some extent. We shall see...
---
It auto fills a team too!! So fun!
---
I like survival better
---
I think this is random based on your hardware. This was my main concern, as at launch it was nearly unplayable, much like unmodified fallout 4 is for me on the same system. Framerate was generally fine because my system is overkill for the resolution I play at, but the hitching and stuttering vsync issues were terrible
---
However after trying the free trial, the game no longer stutters for me in the way it did before. I lucked out, and feel like I'm on the other end of the Fallout 4 stutter issue now - where I was jealous of people who the game ran smoothly for without any physics hacks.
---
Holy shit - fucking accurate.
---
And also shows exactly why they love this sub, their motto is basically: thisisfine.jpg
---
i figured that, but i dont have the option to invite people to my team
---
Yeah I know this. But literally every other BR rewards you for not abandoning the team and there's no respawn after death so if I help my team to the end and I die but the team wins I should be able to gain from that too no??
---
Awesome, thanks man
---
250, but I started with the lifegiver perk that also gave me 45 more. Idk if everybody starts with the same perks or if it's random
---
i know that, i have played before just never with a pre made group, trying to invite my brother but at the main menu i dont have the option to invite anyone
---
If someone runs up to you and does emotes and there’s a bag on the ground - they’re trying to give you things! - Try to do events that you see in the forest /green part of the map - these are great for XP and have the chance to drop Plans and some have the chance at legendary mobs. Definitely try to stay out of the cranberry bog and the mire - I know you probably wanna explore but you’ll really be like a smol fish in the desert out there. Try to figure out what kind of weapon style you like early and choose your perks accordingly - melee and shot gun perks are mostly under strength while pistols and the like are agility and rifles are perception - some have supporting perks in other categories like luck! As far as keeping yourself well fed and hydrated - pick up non perishable food such as canned dog food - you can get the can do perk which gives you an additional option to search containers for non perishable food! This can save you the pain of food that spoils. As far as water - always check player camps to see if they leave their water unlocked - free purified water!
---
Yes. Obviously
---
Have fun. Find what you like to do in the game - and do that. There is literally something for everyone here.
---
If you don't want a challenge yet, stay away from survival mode for sure. Both other modes will be fun and helpful for you to play. Furthermore, in adventure, try sticking around the forest region that Vault 76 is in for a while to level up - following the main mission can get pretty helter skelter if you're not leveled and don't have teammates.
---
I played it tonight as well and it was a lot of fun. I can’t wait to play it again.
---
or do they also have to be at main menu?
---
Briefly: Enjoy story, do events, dont rush leveling as endgame is not as important as story. IMO
---
Blow jobs
---
You need to go to the main menu - open the social tab - inv friend to team - queue for nw
---
Everyone at main menu
---
Warm em up with a tactical nuclear weapon.
---
Yea they gave up on it *Last Year*
---
I’m thinking of them more as a “returning player”
---
well that would explain it, thank you
---
I guess that the cosmetic items are probably high rank rewards. Nobody reached an really high rank yet within a day.
---
This isn’t the “official suck off BGS” sub, no matter how slobbery y’all get.
---
got it thanks, I just didnt know the person i wanted to invite to team needed to be on main menu as well
---
Besides that, 10 atoms per night ain't helpful enough m
---
GT SkullCrackaX, about to send you a friend request and join your game. Or try to, haven't done this before. Maybe meet at the lighthouse and I'll jump off?
---
Technically it is possible for 52 randoms to go in solo and have that button pressed.... but the likely hood they will all be matched together...? I'd say slim.
---
Been working perfectly on ranged ....so yeah they broke it!
---
I don't want to do Tadpole bullshit on my 10 characters either, but it seems that receiving a backpack is something that requires the humiliation. With BR at least there is some lore underneath, with tadbullshit its the single biggest gripe I have with the game, that somehow my character is too imbecile to pickup or buy a backpack.
---
What
---
Sub’s as toxic as a nuke storm dude. These people are te Cult Of Atom. We’re filthy unbelievers. Get used to it.
---
At 26 I was exploring Cranberry Bog - don't go unless you have stimpaks, but it helped me level super fast.... I did die a lot though, so kept little to no junk on me.
---
Can do
---
The only truly essential mod on for the PC version, [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124). It allows you to create loadouts using an external site and putting them into a text configuration. You can also save them directly from within game, but that requires an additional mod that needs to be updated each and every patch.
---
That said, it's down at the moment :(
---
I have a feeling that they still can't get special separation quite right yet which is why it is the way it is.
---
For everything that's virtually wiped out, having SPECIAL stat caps from adventure seems really odd and random. They will probably change it at release.
---
Give it a shot, it could surprise you.
---
All that junk you skip because you think you don't need it? You will! Junk is always good to have on hand, you never know what future missions might require so store those gears and bolts!
---
Stimpacks and Radaway are sparse compared to previous games so make sure  you take those too.
---
And remember to take your time and have fun, there's no rush to get to the endgame and Wastelanders doesn't come out till the fall.
---
Yeah, I still pop in for a day every week or two.
---
He’s still right.
---
Tbh any given server could be cannon if they picked one. It’s plausible that American citizens caused more damage to America than China did by going full YOLO in the apocalypse.
---
Obviously the subreddit for the game is gonna like the game lmfao
---
I just remember a bunch of "challenge" type stuff unlocked on the lower left side of my screen.  I couldn't even keep track of what they were.  I was riding pretty high after miraculously surviving against two players and a scorchbeast at the end.
---
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
---
Leveling up gets progressively more difficult though so if you have multiple charterers you can take them all to rank 5 then whichever one has gotten the best perk cards you can just stick with that one
---
Take your time and explore, there's a lot of things out there. There's no rush
---
There is literally no reason what so ever for 2 people to play on the same account, at least not on xbox. Idk about other systems.
---
Well if you want you can opt out of joining a team and go solo. Idk if that would make much of a difference or not.
---
1v51 = 1v1v1v1v1v1v1v1...etc. 52 people joining solo would have to press the button to not fill their team, and get matched up together (creating 52 'teams') for it to be a free for all.
---
Ultracite ammo isn't in the regular ammo list. It has its own list. Scroll further down in the menu.
---
Radium Rifles are the best, lowering their max health as you hurt them so they can't even heal back up is just balls to the wall.
---
Read terminal entrys.
---
Not sure how familair you are with the series.
---
If you are a fan of lore, terminals provide a massive amount of info on locations, people, things you may have otherwise never known. Holotapes are just as good and easier considering no reading involved. Having that little bit of lore makes the world a bit more immersive and it just adds to the experience.  
---
also group up with other people. Makes friends in the world and youll naturally make memories. I have tons of pictures and recordings of stupid things that have happened simply from just having a buddy to play with. This is, afterall, a multiplayer fallout.
---
Nope.. it's a different server..
---
That's why i am glad i bought PS4. No mods = no cheaters.
---
#FoRtNiTe 76
---
The PC version's "box copy" is a DVD case with a cardboard disc that has a retail key on it. There's no physical media inside.
---
Follow the Overseers quest line and the ones that spawn from it... this will keep you in areas with low level enemies until you rank up a bit. 
---
Going to Flatwoods is part of that and while there doing the quests you should have no problem leveling up to at least 5 or 7. 
---
Look through and farm everything!!! 
---
There’s at least 4-6 plans there and a few pieces of leather armor on some of the porches. 
---
Doing the quest going to Vaulttec Ag with Mr Farmbots, will get you plenty of metals! 
---
Pacifist mode... once you get to level 5 it turns off... so got to setting and turn it back on! Unless you want to accidentally shoot someone then get killed and they take all your junk...lol
---
IF you team MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS IT ON!! If someone doesn’t and they shoot someone y’all are in for it! 
---
Don’t take workshops... this is the number one way to lose all your junk and get killed as higher levels will hunt you down... besides you can farm more materials and xp roaming around than you can in any workshop. 
---
Power armor... you can start the Miner Miracles quest line early! You can complete everything except building the the excavator armor. Once you hit 25, and you have enough supplies, you can build the PA then go back and register it after once you hit 25. (Basically forget about the Raider Armor at lvl 15) you’ll be farming to repair it and it will slow leveling besides it’s not great at that level... 
---
Don’t pick players locks... it’s a pet peeve and you’ll get wanted and then killed... trust me there...
---
Want help? Just ask... lots of good peeps out there!
---
The best I've ever gotten was a single cap.  Once I got a coffee mug.  I tend to just walk right past them unless I'm doing Collision Course for atoms.  I just pop them all while I'm waiting for the next wave.
---
Thank god. Ive been collecting plushes and I got a little nervous
---
Auto grenade launcher is very powerful if your spec’d for that playstyle. Two shot is the best prefix for it, you carpet bomb an area in seconds. 
---
Also ordinance express let’s me carry like 300+ rounds. Weight isn’t an issue
---
I have been shot people that are invisible right in front of me and by people with no weapon.
---
Glad to help, and now I'm off to bed.
---
Did you hear me speaking, by any chance? I can't figure out if my mic is working, but I don't think it is.
---
Really hope there’s a quest to put her into a human body, then install her as mayor of the raiders. That or the raiders just murder her, murder the cancer bats with vault 79 gold bullets or something, and are the new greatest threat. But waaaay less annoying.
---
I did, I just don't use voice chat. Thank you, again!
---
This and join or just tag along other players. I find that if im active and not just taggin stuff for xp ppl dont mind so much.
---
I go ham with all my .38 and 10mm in some full auto. Just to use it and help out a bit. Also res downed players... Its a small thing but ppl like a teammate.. Not a vulture☺
---
No it's a free for all server..  no teams for anyone..
---
Ahh well that sucks. I don't have gear to truly compete in survival so I haven't played it too much. Cause it's basically just that for me "how long will i survive" haha
---
THEY ASKED IF ENEMIES STILL FEEL LIKE TANKS
---
YMMV - Depends on your build and level of enemies you're facing 🤷‍♂️
---
WHHHHAAAAAAT????!!!!!
---
Ps4, I got it to work but my installation of fallout 75 is now 65 gigabytes and I'm down to 27
---
No they are not. If your struggling to kill things it’s not the weapons but your build. I have a shotgun build that does roughly 900 damage a shot. If your struggling against super mutants maybe you should look at your perk card load out and see what you can do to improve. Rather than complain about nerfs.
---
Bobby B!
---
It depends on the enemy, but overall no
---
I don't condemn people for their devotion to Bethesda, I condemn Bethesda for their deceitful marketing and side stepping of issues and shady nerfs.
---
I had to stop playing this game because the headaches it caused were becoming unbearable, and even the advice o reddit did not help it. 
---
I hope people get their money's worth out of this game, but at $60 when I purchased I know I did not get mine.
---
Thanks marv can I get SCP 4
---
Yea everyone thinks that but it depends. You can use grenades and mines and sneak perks all kinds of stuff thats easy to get. I dont think its too bad anyway
---
Just keep at it I was the same at first but by the end of the night I am getting around one to two kills
---
Was waiting for this post all evening. Thank you! I noticed this as soon as I got home and played it. Fortunately I found myself sidetracked with the Nuclear Winter mode.
---
Upvote
---
Oh yeh I'm just saying I get melted lol
---
Only YOUR team isn't filled. Everyone else has team mates, especially if you go in solo and press that button. Then it's more 1v3v4v2v4v1v...etc. Still you against the world for sure, but not free for all in the sense of every man/women/child/windigo for itself.
---
I low-key think it's better executed and more fun than other battle royale games
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH you're a lifesaver I was really upset about this but now I have it downloading !!!
---
Thanks for the extra feedback, I was considering just respeccing my old shotgun build, I originally quit the game because I got tired of having to farm materials for shells constantly, but it might just be too much work.
---
I will most likely end up making a new character if only because it will probably be quicker to get to speed than respeccing a level 70+ character.
---
It wouldn't make any difference if I had an explosive laser rifle and Sentinel armor.......4 players will win vs. 1 player 99.98% of the time.
---
But I found out the amount of points you have in a spot dictates if you can use more of the same SPECIAL points. Like I tried to use the perk card that gives you faster stimpack healing (rank 6 I believe) but I couldn’t use it because I didn’t have enough perk points left to use it I guess. If not idk how I couldn’t use it :p
---
Just played with a rank 16. Makes me feel weak as a 10 lol, even though I'm constantly getting matched with lower levels on my team
---
Go to the atomic shop and the items you buy/have bought will give you the option
---
Good point...i put a lot of perks into my fully auto rifle builds...is there a good resource to learn about builds?
---
No word on this?
---
What’s in the level 10 area of the vault? Anything?
---
I want it too, keep me in the loop lol.
---
Workshop defense missions. You get 300 or so for claiming then another 300 for each time you defend it. On top of all the exp you get from the waves of enemies. I went from 23 to 36 on a day mostly solo sometimes I grouped with randoms for the 15% buff. Also do the feed the people event for canned meat stew. It will give you 5% exp for an hr. Make sure your well rested also. And if your ballsy go to the cranberry bog and get some cranberries for cranberry jam which also gives more exp. after buffs you can get 30% bonus exp.
---
Yes that’s the only way
---
What system are you on?
---
I'm loving it so far I won 2 matches and people really cooperate a lot it's so much fun :3
---
Not really, some cool items but no more lore.
---
Are the outfits only atomshop outfits?
---
I dont know.. nor am I gonna check tonight.. but that's why I put question marks around it.. cuz I wasnt sure.. thank you
---
Perk wise, try out nukesanddragons character planner which gives you information about the perk cards and mutations in the game and you can plan your character to level 50 (as level 50 is when you stop getting S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats but you still collect cards). When you get a cards you can swap them out whenever you like. Say you have 3 strength, you can have three rank one special cards or one rank three special card.
---
Camp wise, don’t do what I did and spend your life in your camp. I mean my camp is amazing but I’m behind where I want to be. A good idea would be to build your camp in an area with resources I.e copper Vein or a copper Deposit (you can only place extractors on deposits). Workshops are only available when you are in a game so if you leave that game you lose ownership of the workshop and if you join a new one you must claim the workshop again. Workshops are good to get plans and XP from however they can be contested by other players.
---
You find weapons around the place and legendaries off of legendary enemies. A 1 star weapon has one legendary, 2 star has two legendary effects, 3 star has three legendary effects. You can trade unwanted legendaries for Scrip at a legendary vendor and trade them with the Purveyor (near harpers ferry) to get a randomised legendary weapon that you can afford. I.e 15 scrip for a legendary 1 star armor piece or 100 scrip for a three star ranged weapon and the like. There are certain build types you can get like TSE (two shot explosives - weapons break quicker cause durability is based on shot count) or Bloodied (stronger the less health you have) but you’d need to read more on that.
---
You are prone to diseases from a lot of things; being in water, being in the ash heap, having a lot of rads, animal attacks, creature attacks but there are things to prevent stuff like that as well as you get disease cures. If you’re thirsty or hungry your AP decreases to half of what you could get and if you’re well fed or whatever having enough water is called, you get benefits.
---
It costs to fast travel and everything is in real time so you can’t sleep in a bed you can only rest. Also there are recommended levels in areas so be wary of that. Another thing is leveling in general, you must be a certain level to use certain items but if you aren’t the correct level just store it in your stash and save it for later. You will also need plans to craft things in fallout 76. To get weapon mods you scrap the same type of weapon. I.e you have Four hunting rifles, scrap three to get mods for it. 
---
Quests, there are a lot of quests and I will say the main story is pretty difficult to follow but it will be under the ‘main’ tab in your pip boy. You also have Side (misc included as side) Daily and event tabs. Events you get rewards upon completion (like most) quests however event quests can be triggered multiple times in a day. 
---
I haven’t played the other game modes; Nuclear Winter (battle Royale) and Survival (PvP) much yet so all I can really inform you on is Adventure.
---
Hope this helps
---
What a Chad.
---
I’m level ten and I seem to be only opening up perk cards and not cratEs, is there a way to open the crates?
---
Not that I’m aware of. However you can go to nukesdragon and make your build and then post the link here and people can give you feedback. Of course every build is subjective.
---
Originally after the tse patch yes but that was when I wasnt built for any of the weapons. Now I have a heavy gun, pistol and rifle/commando builds and they all benefit from them
---
Yea that is mostly the case. I played for a few hours and most of the time my team died off and I was left on my own. Almost every game I had to cheese it out of a fire fight because I was out gunned by a long shot. Everytime I ran into someone in PA they were unkillable! I tried with hunting rifles, shotgun, and 50 cal! No luck. So I hope I get a tank killer card in a perk pack soon!!!
---
Never played this game but might get it just for this mode.
---
Absolutely ✌ Apologies for not fully explaining what I meant in the first place.
---
You're always going to be farming for ammo. If you're playing solo I'd suggest stealth sniper or stealth commando, both builds are easy on ammo consumption, and farming mats to craft more isn't overly time consuming.
---
My other folder says 69 gigs so that's probably where it went
---
Glad to have you along for the ride!  
---
It is a massive world with lots of places to explore and lots of cool and unique loot to gather.  
---
A lot of the higher-level events are really exciting as well.
---
Have fun and be safe wandering the wastes!
---
I'll do that, thanks man...or woman....fellow player? But really thanks.
---
When every single year he puts out another apology for fucking up, he can take his golden parachute and shove it up his ass.
---
I’m enjoying it, but keep forgetting to set perk cards before entering the game... I’m a melee player so the gun play is taking some time to get used to.
---
1000 hours plus still my favorite place to hang out online.
---
If you have gatling gun, no enemy is safe. Not even those on hills. + plasma granates will kill you in one boom.
---
Yeah I'm past that point of wanting it back. I've owned my current account for longer than the original one. I just really REALLY want my atom shop stuff. I paid money for that stuff and I can't get the Christmas bundles anymore. I'm a day 1 player and would buy limited time items because I LOVE exclusive items that say "That guy is fancy". Now I don't have any of it.
---
It's only available until the 17th because it's in beta. I believe eventually it will be a full time option in the menu.
---
I mean picking your spot if great up until half the server decides to spawn in the same area and it just turns into a crapshoot
---
At least with the skydiving you know how man people are going toward your targeted destination and you can peel off and go somewhere else if you decide it's too hot
---
me too
---
Not sure about PlayStation, but PC has been running flawless all night.  Even the new winter mode was surprisingly smooth and lag free.
---
No problem.
---
So i underatand now that i just suck lol
---
I started playing again today and had a ton of fun.
---
Ill start working on my build. I LOVE.my commando build.
---
Why would escaping to a high level zone in the vault with a bunch of high-level punch-happy murderers make sense?
---
Yes. I heard it was…da bomb. 😎
---
Or radium rifles man. There is like no radaway around.
---
IS THAT HOW YOU SPEAK TO YOUR OVERSEER?
---
This bums me out a little bit but thanks for the heads up.  I hope they plan to do more skins with the Hellfire model in addition to the fiery skins.
---
Just like getting stoned off paint fumes while you paint a car or something! The headache is horrible!
---
I'd probably play it if they offer solo. My first and only attempt with a random squad everyone split up and died immediately. The last remaining player seemed to run away from me as I tried to meet up with them. We finally got killed and I got to watch a squad of 4 sharing the loot they found on our corpses. Obviously they were mic'd up and we never stood a chance.
---
I suck at BR but I'm still having fun.
---
Who?
---
Thanks man I really appreciate it.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahaha.
---
Gotcha, what items have you gotten? Only a nine myself.  For what it’s worth your the highest I’ve seen/heard
---
My boyfriend and I both experienced this in two different nuke zones on two different servers. VERY loud sizzling and roaring sound, almost like the sound made right as the nuke drops and the debris is blowing past you (without the music).
---
Same. I came in with low expectations and, quite honestly, haven’t seen what all the bad hype is about. Not sure if I’m easy to please or if I just enjoy the break from reality.
---
I had to stop playing because of the uncontrollable headaches and migranes this game caused, but I am glad they are improving it and that it is looking better since launch.
---
This game isn’t like every other BR.  Maybe they’ll add something like that in but as of now it’s such a small detail in a game like this especially how new NW is
---
Claim gorge junkyard, run WS, hop server, repeat.
---
I actually like it. Won the 3rd match I played and a youtube I watch killed me in an other. It was fun ^^
---
Thank you
---
Agreed. My favorite game in a LOOOOOOONG TIME! And these updates keep getting better and better! Plus, what game gives you the DLC for free!!?? It’s great.
---
I really would rather not be on a team though so hopefully that becomes an option
---
You can only have 7 cards equipped as well. So 35 would be the max level for NW as any special points beyond that aren't used. Though being lvl 50 or higher would give you more flexibility.
---
You punch people in the boxing ring or work on your cardio. Lounge about socializing with your soon to be victims. But seriously It’s only 2 mins let’s be reasonable. I could argue that you would want those 2 mins to meet your team set your perk load out and discuss a drop point. If anything I wouldn’t mind a little bit more time. I’m in no hurry, just there to have fun playing a game with friends.
---
I liked it so much i pre ordered it! haha
---
But oh damn, didnt know the game mode wasnt staying definitely until they “upgraded” it
---
Hey it’s you! I never doubted you! Looked fun from the trailers too
---
&gt; **We tend not to go chasing after trends.**
---
Yeah, it's a known bug,"they're looking into it".
---
I really hope we do keep it. It would be lame to have to level up all over again
---
22 on discord...
---
A 7. I’m 0/10 lol, BR is not my thing — I’m level 4
---
Stay away from the mire and the cranberry bog lol lots of things hide In the mire ;)
---
Got the Overseers Chair, Blue Camo paint for the .44 and the Power armors. A hotrod skin for the 10mm.
---
Some nice items.
---
looks like you just have to keep playing and leveling up and you'll eventually unlock the good stuff. Probably 2-3 worth while items and im gonna assume the max level is 50 until... next season?
---
I was able to just complete it following /u/krispin41 comment. Go get the password off the dresser in fort defiance and you should be prompted to power it on after you go back to the automated research terminal.
---
Any idea what he got for those levels?
---
Guess it was some kind of curse that was broken by whining on reddit.
---
I am on pc too! Was sad because no one talked on group chat, started going solo, but now its working yay
---
I got to Overseer Rank 6 and unlocked the Medium Stash Box.  At first I thought it was a skin for the Stash Box but it is an icon.  I think the Medium Stash Box skin is unlocked at a later Rank.  The Small Stash Box skin is unlocked at an earlier Rank in addition to a player icon.
---
So you don't want "rifles" buffed. You want Tse buffed.. You know those got nerfed because they used to be OP. and you aren't even using the right perks to get the most damage out of Tse.. What. You might be your own worst enemy. 
---
Once you get a bloodied weapon you'll stop complaining until you run into someone with a legacy bloodied explosive laser rifle and you'll complain about them too, people always complain about the gun they don't have yet. 
---
Bloodied should be the strongest modifier because you have to sacrifice the most to use it. What do you sacrifice for Tse? A slight accuracy penalty in vats? Cmon you can't have it all without some downsides.
---
&gt;For a fix in the next patch
---
Didn’t think it was my thing but gave it a shot. If I was better at pvp I might have liked it. But waiting 5 minutes to lobby/load for 5 minutes of play was boring. I was on a decent team one time and that was fun. I made it to 10 minutes that time :)
---
you probably won't need help. Leveling up is much easier now. you wont hit a wall till level 25 or so. even then you can probably push through with  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the\_way\_of\_the\_green\_thumb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the_way_of_the_green_thumb/) 
---
with player vending you don't have to work through a whole map under leveled and under geared, the player shops usually have plenty of ammo for sell cheap and radiation arches , beds, music stuff. workbenches etc. it is still a little grindy at times to level up but its twice as easy as the beginning days. With healing salve from the green thumb guide I hunted the scorch beasts for the enclave rank at level 25, successfully launched my own nuke, and completed the main story line by level 30  ish. super easy barely an inconvenience, but I have over 1k hours in the game at this point so I have a pretty good grasp on where and how to get everything and I just transferred over a bunch of caps from my main so I had a lot of advantages. I would say that even discounting prior knowledge and caps its still far easier just from the player vending places.
---
Sounds like your friends and family have some growing up to do.
---
I agree. As far as I am concerned they still haven't 'apologised'. They shipped and charged full price for a game that was at times quite unplayable.
---
A level 13 was hanging around in the lobby I'm 11
---
You've won 13 matches?
---
Omg if I wanted to play battle royal rubbish I would of bought the stupid game why is it here I mean seriously what has it got to do with fall out.  If it's not bad enough ripping us off with nylon bags to then claim theirs claim form so well hidden people couldn't find them to then find out their was an capped time to submit... We now have this ridiculous copy right put in the game... From day dot I've defended the games hour pusuading people to ignore YouTube bull.... Bethesda Im really struggling to defend the game when you pull a stupid stunt like this.. Beginning to feel like give me my money back so I can buy that stupid game if you really want people to play it that bad,    
---
It's bad enough I can't access project paradise and contacting support hit a,   I don't give a crap reply,  now this.   we wanted a mission relevant to f76 in the vaults adventure not a rip of of another game...  not a good game at that.
---
Nope... weapon skin at 25 though... he said skins, trophies, and CAMP items so far
---
Barely

RedEye in Fallout: Equestria is the leader of a gang of Slavers that works from the ruins of a theme park and runs his own radio station from said theme park to spread his propaganda. While His personality is different, they do share a lot of similarities between one another, other than RedEye from Nuka-World isn't the Overboss (due to that being for the player).
---
I’m just curious, but why need to redownload the whole game again? I get that it technically isn’t going to be 2 games left over when it’s complete, but why would we need to download it a second time, why not just make us download the new and changed files again? Seems like a waste of bandwidth
---
Its testing for the mode they are probably not ready to open the vault fully yet, I haven't tried it to find out
---
I would say probably a little. I just started and got a rank 3 iron clad but my endurance is capped at 2 so I can't use it :/
---
Thanks! I hate this
---
Why is let say 20 health points and 80 radiation considered that you have 20% of health, and not 100%? It deducts from your actual health points, not from maximum. And it breaks all the related game mechanics, in this case in player favour who uses bloodied and nerd rage which depends on health amount.
---
As far as I understand, no. They count for how many perks you can take in one SPECIAL stat, but seem to have little or no influence on the usual things.
---
I think that they need to get rid of AP restriction..
---
Also the inventory management is terrible. So even when you want to drop something it's very clunky.
---
It’s been a blast. Met some interesting folks. Died many interesting ways. Repeatedly. Seriously, I’m not very good, but it’s been so much fun. Well done all around. 
---
Hopefully when it officially launches, there’s an option to play with your friends, cause I haven’t seen it yet
---
I got same problem with some perception perk increasing reload speed for rifles.
---
Oh no, that stuff sucks. But saying it does suck doesn't mean everything is done on purpose. I.E Benefit of the doubt. Assume human error happens rather than blame everything on greed, even when actual greed would tell you "Don't do this."
---
TL:dr
---
I just bought it again because I heard the updates made this game great
---
Yeah I’ve noticed that too. Area chat is disabled too according to the devnotes. I think it might be people who are playing that are a bit shy? I mean it makes survival sense to be part of a team but I know that a lot of people aren’t very extroverted in this game. In my experience, anyway. Also maybe people didn’t get the memo that area chat is off so might be afraid to use mic?
---
Isn't there some theory that Cerberus means spotted?
---
Ikr u thought it would be a cheap knock off of another battle royale
---
It's spread all over the map.  Try Morgantown
---
Don’t underestimate the bladed board lol I snuck up behind the final three and nailed them all with it a bit ago and they had no idea what was going on
---
Entirely could- See Fortnite STW mode that birthed the BR juggernaut and then was comparably abandoned for a year.
---
But from what we’ve seen of Wastelanders, I’m willing to give it a chance. The big difference is there is no free-to-play version of Nuclear Winter that doesn’t require a FO76 purchase, which is what let BR grow immediately and sapping dev and player interest in the paid mode. If that changes... RIP Adventure mode.
---
Just played my first match with randoms, actually had a lot of fun, we all killed a few people, fought some mirelurks and then died fighting another team when we were all ambushed by more mirelurks a few minutes later. Definitely going to play it again.
---
Why do you feel like you need 250+ health as a rifleman? Seriously that's so much overkill it's just silly. How many times are you actually taking lots of damage? Do you value your health pool so much that you use the lifegiver perks? I bet you don't, but you still say "I can't use bloodied, I need my health!".
---
No. You. Don't. You can easily run a bloodied gun at half health and still do massive damage and have a relatively safe health pool,  if you feel particularly safe you can drop down to low health and max out your dmg and you will run circles around a Tse weapon that breaks twice as fast and has garbage accuracy.
---
He's talking about the hellfire skin.
---
No. The new PA
---
Or you know people who only have one Xbox per house...
---
I too surprisingly am enjoying it. I do worry that with its success Bethesda is going to continue dumping more and more resources into it resulting in less content for PvE than we would have gotten without BR. I bought this game because it was supposed to be an online fallout survival RPG with pvp elements. No one ever said anything about having a Battle Royale mode. I really am not a fan of locking content behind pvp for a game like this. Unless it's easily achievable like play for 30 min or something. I'm sure there are folks like myself that suck at pvp and never get kills that would be very sad to miss out on content because we aren't skilled enough.
---
And the new lobby music is so DAMN GOOD
---
I wrote a guide specifically for this often asked question.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the\_way\_of\_the\_green\_thumb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the_way_of_the_green_thumb/) 
---
also Toxic\_Razz posted a very good over all strat as well. 
---
I find its better to just go where the game takes you and let the levels happen as they happen, the more I focus on that next level the longer they seem to take.
---
NEW MR. PEBBLES CAMP MERCHANDISE
---
I couldn't equip frog legs at first because it required 9 agility and I was only 8. I have a bunch more cards that require 7+ in a specific special too.
---
Nothing that a bloodied weapon can't handle.
---
The crate at level 5. Period. The rest are park cards boxes.
---
My bad.  No idea.  I haven't played the new patch yet.  Perhaps winning the BR.
---
It shows a number same as regular perks.
---
How does the BR work? Do you spawn randomly and all pick up level 1 weapons or like do u have perks?
---
I was kind of having the same problem, sometimes turning seemed like it was lagging but then it would work fine again. Can’t remember which direction it was doing it on
---
Is that resistance the same value or amount as health? And thank you for the reply that makes sense!
---
Yeah, I saw somebody with a clear aimbot and who was using some kind of teleports. I think it was some exploit related to VR because it was always jumping like 10-15 feet forward the same way you move in fallout 4 VR, one of the guys spectating the cheater mentioned that. He was just teleporting around instagibbing people with a combat shotgun lmao
---
Scrap all weapons and armor you’re not actively using.  You’ll get more.  This unlocks craftable modifications.
---
STORE YOUR JUNK in your stash regularly.  Expect to die at any moment.  Don’t be that person who comes on Reddit to cry about the 1000 lbs of junk they were carrying when they died and someone took it.  😂
---
Take your time with the main  story.  Some of the quest reward  you can only get once and they’re tied to your level.  Best to wait until you’re level 50+.
---
Adhesive can be grown at your camp.
---
Always set your camp on at least one resource node.  There are a few spots you can fit two.  
---
Do the Power Up events early to unlock generator plans.  You’ll need a hazmat suit.
---
They might put a cooldown on stimpacks on the next patch though.
---
I've seen a door requiring level 100, so at least that
---
I saw x-02 PA referenced on a terminal I want it. Also a terminal requires rank 105 so at least that high
---
Great, thanks!
---
Nay for me , its nice with variation but personally i have 0 interest in BR . Going back to eso until we get new content .
---
I use a auto 10mm pistol and it may have worked once all night for me.  I'm definitely seeing issues as well.
---
I've seen teleporting too
---
But how where they placed in the map though?  Were they forced to drink nukashine? LOL
---
Definitely, the best perk cards require as much as 9 of a SPECIAL. Bloody mess needs 9 luck, and it gives you a 15% damage bonus to all weapons. There's a perk for no fall damage that needs I think 6 or 7 agility
---
I also really like it and hope that we get a Pvp adventure mode with this kind of stats.
---
The only bad thing is that the game has a problem with rendering with scopes. The models take some seconds to load and the buildings look like trash (played on ps4)
---
with that fashion sense a nuke would have been mercy
---
Experiencing the same. Shit servers probably based on location. Am Australian.
---
Post mortem is just the industry name for post launch, not a "lol dead game" thing
---
Fortnite actually did this around Halloween and also Valentine's Day. They added zombies to the game which would give you shield and loot when killed. There were a lot of complaints but mostly because it took over all modes and you couldn't play without them. It was sort of fun though.
---
I had a similar issue, but I think it's just in the netcode honestly
---
Did you look in the Search option for this forum? You're nowhere near the first person to ask this
---
I would use voice chat if the feature worked for me. I set up my mic so its working in windows but it never registers in FO76 ... I have to use those gesture things.
---
For early players, learning to not be a hoarder is very helpful. Inventory management is the devil. By breaking hoarding habits early, you’ll have a much better time. You’ll tweak these as you go, but here are some good practices to follow: 
---
The 100 Junk Rule - Don’t keep more than 100 of any individual scrap component in your stash at any given time. Sell the excess to vendor bots. You may think you need to save everything—but you don’t. 
---
Bulk to sell, not to store - Bulking doesn’t save weight, not anything significant anyway. It just looks like it does because it uses plastic. Bulk junk items to sell them to vendors, that’s it. Junk items that can’t be bulked can be sold individually.
---
If you find a non-legendary weapon or armor piece that’s above your level, scrap it. You may feel compelled to save it, but you don’t need to. You’ll find more. 
---
Don’t be a loot piñata - A loot piñata is someone who carries all their junk on them at all times. Workshops are really the only PvP situations in Adventure Mode, and “Raiders” love to kill low levels and see how much loot they drop. Hoarding is common, so it’s usually a lot. Follow the hoarding suggestions and you’ll always have plenty of room to stash your junk every chance you get.
---
There are things such as constructive criticism, and there is what was written here which honestly I don't even know how to describe.
---
I'm glad tho the game looks like it does and not like you've described it.
---
They were never tanky. They take a handful of shots.
---
God I hope her IGN was Mama\_Murphy
---
Oh. Ok
---
I’ve noticed i have a couple new icons available, but only saw them when I went through everything in the shop looking for owned items I never bought. Dumb way to do it. 
---
I’ve also got a new stash box available in the camp menu, underneath the main stash box. It’s one of the blue and yellow boxes from nuclear winter, looks pretty good. And it’s small enough to put on a table or something.
---
It seems like a good setting for a BR tbh.  The only thing that I think would be nice is if you could more freely respec stats for the BR mode instead of being stuck with what you specced your Adventure mode (or whatever it's called) character in.
---
yeah this out right forced me to unequip gunfu due to the auto ending of vats :/
---
Someone doesnt know how xbox works. Only one xbox account needs xbox gold and then every other account on it can use it a d all the games for free.
---
Nope. I won it and got ZERO rewards
---
Because it’s a vault and crazy things happen in a vault.
---
I was waiting until the end of the year to give it another chance, but after yesterday I’m ready to jump back in as soon as I get home (out of town from my PS4 atm). I want to be ready for when these NPCs show up!
---
My advice is if its new just wait awhile for it to get fixed. If it gets fixed. Survival mode never did. And a lot of bugs have lived since beta.
---
Yeah, after today I think it’ll just be a once in awhile thing, but what the heck. More options are better.
---
Very nice.
---
I'm honestly really confused about what your trying to say in this comment. I haven't looked around but the cash grab thing was just from my thoughts (a little extreme but that's how I felt about the launch). As far as the qoute, yes it was not a exact qoute but I'll add that below and maybe no outlet has transcribed it but ign did record it straight from Todd's mouth.
---
My main point was Todd actually said in the recorded interview (not sure about the article I didn't read it I just watched it) "We knew that going into this... We knew that it's not that. Right. You would say look this isn't... This isnt a game, even from the beginning... This is not gonna be like you know, a high metacritic game. Thats not what this is, given what it is". This is really unacceptable. Like I said before a game company's primary goal should be to make quality games that people enjoy playing, not deploy something that people will eventually enjoy.
---
so they release a shit game and are forced to make it better to not end this in a complete fiasco and you guys still kiss their asses? he didnt even apologize when they should just like sony when the psn hack went down. dude you deserve all of this and more because bethesda can do what they want and you would buy the next game in a second
---
Area around vault 76 is protected from nukes.
---
Fair enough. That's something I do like, that we're getting more game out the game. I'm an adventure player first but love that I'll be able to mess around with Nuclear Winter in my downtime!
---
I liked it too but I can’t put my finger on why
---
No, lol at them for constantly shit talking a game they haven't played or probably won't because they believe the game is as bad as it was at launch even though it's plenty fun and theres a lot to do.
---
Not true, I played a few matches with team fill off, and there were obvious teams playing against me. 
---
It kinda makes it impossible to play solo. It needs a separate mode desperately.
---
Been on for last 5 hours not one disconnect or blue screen etc. (Aussie)
---
Sleep, eat either cranberry cobblers of cranberry relish, play Survival mode
---
I'm glad I could help. Enjoy Nuclear Winter :)
---
You need time to adjust your perk cards. You don’t do it every time, but without that 2 minute window there wouldn’t be time.
---
You want mic spam? Cus that's how you get mic spam.
---
Yeah it sucks. Every time I load in, the game already started so I’m automatically disconnected
---
Welcome to Appalachia!
---
No but I mean a requeue ability would be nicer than going to the main menu.
---
Ever seen the movie hunger game? It's kinda like that where you get drop in an area with nothing and you have to go searching for weapons and armor and last one alive win type thing
---
Rainbow six siege gives you all dlc for free since day 1 it came out. Including latest oos and no pay to win.
---
Yeah when they said leveling the playing field, I never imagined this. It’s really good though
---
Too bad you missed out when they gave away the base game for free a couple months back
---
It's actually a fungus that is infecting people.
---
I totally agree. I've got 3 strength cards so far for a character with only 3 strength lol. It would be nice to use those on my other character with 15 strength.
---
My only issue is that it's rough on the eyes after playing 12 hours strait.
---
It already has a story, you should try playing it
---
How long does it take to get into a game?
---
Store your junk !! Or atleast dont come here crying that someone took your your junkbag if you die. Its all part of the game so.  Store store
---
Yeah no issues here also Australian
---
Helps to no what platform your playing on 👍
---
Basically you have to hit the ground running and find at least one container and hope like hell it has something useful in it. 
---
You don’t have to do it as a team, you can turn that off by hitting whatever button it says, X on Xbox. If you go in solo I recommend choosing a starting spot you don’t think many people will choose and running away immediately if more than two other people look to be spawning in the same area. Loot boxes are everywhere so you don’t have to risk yourself for any particular one. And power armor doesn’t really see, to protect you very well, so I don’t bother with it. But my solo method is to hide while I move into the ever decreasing circles. I suck at non vats aiming so I’ve only got two kills but I’ve made second place twice by just outlasting everyone else. Almost everyone else. 
---
I don’t know how often I’ll play after binging today but it’s kinda fun.
---
Legit move the pvp balancing / power limits over to survival, and that shit would be grand.
---
It really is unexpectedly fun. I expected to go in and just feel like it was a slow neutered BR that I would end up just ignoring. But the mode is actually pretty fun. *And* it still feels like Fallout to me, which is rad.
---
just move your Fallout76Custom.ini file someplace else.  or delete it.
---
I just need to get in there to map vault 51 out, so I can recreate it in Fallout 4 XD. I will be a quick kill for someone.
---
Sweet now I know.
---
Lol, that is ridiculous, haha. Came here for the same question. 
---
Not only is it not a loot crate, it isn't a stash box skin either. It's an icon of a stash box, haha. 
---
Currently lvl 4 (grinded there to get the chest)
---
Sorry, just edited. On PC.
---
Appalachian deserters came back?
---
Giving the benefit of the doubt to a company when they've shown zeal and willingness to take advantage of their players at every turn is ridiculous. You're also assuming that greed is never short sighted or can cause you to make poor decisions. People and companies both make decisions that significantly hurt and affect them, either because they don't see the consequences or they assume they can survive despite them. 
---
You shouldn't attribute everything to malice, but you also shouldn't just give people the benefit of the doubt in every situation.
---
In my eyes Fallout 76 has the potential to be something amazing and in another year or two the differences between it and the initial rough start will be like night/day, especially once moddable private servers come into play.
---
It's a lot like ESO in that regard where the first year for ESO was rough, with plenty of memes around about how it was just a 'console beta'.  But Zenimax Online Studios turned that ship around and now it's doing very well for itself much to the chagrin of people who hate or dismiss it because it's not Skyrim with multiplayer.
---
Fallout 76 looks to be going that same direction where you're going to still have people like Jim Sterling and the vocal portion of r/fallout's population frothing at the mouth over it because it's not what they wanted, but everyone else will be enjoying it or will be able to at least acknowledge Bethesda's efforts to turn its rough launch around.
---
I'm still very optimistic for the game's future and Bethesda looks to be taking the steps to keep moving it closer to realizing this thing's full potential.
---
that is annoying
---
Getting back into a queue is such a time suck.  
---
Am I doing it wrong, or do I have to completely select the mode again from the menu, can’t I just reload back in?
---
Same dude, on XBOX
---
This is all I could ever want, even if it's a Dolly Bot
---
Omg I’ve thought about doing this lol do you get messages ???
---
26 on ps4 a few minutes ago. That guy was a beast and told me he wins around 70%of his matches
---
They need to put that in the main game.
---
Mods are definitely a thing. It’s not beyond reason to think some people will use mods to cheat. This is a beta and I’m sure it will be addressed. Apex legends suffered a similar fate at launch. Except FO76 already has a large community that knows the game engine so a simple mod to give you god mode or teleports would be a simple task.
---
Ps4 didnt happen to me. Did it in first person. Maybe why
---
I didn't click the link.. But knew exactly who you meant after that description..
---
Ya i stayed with the team and some fucknut takes all the ammo bu leaves the gun.. Every time. So i had a sword and 3 guns with zero ammo. Few times in a row. Im not big on BR games but it was fun for what it is. Adventure mode has all kinds of nubs running around the forest and survival i lasted almost 2 and 1/2 hrs before someone came to kill me. So i like it.
---
All things you unlock besides perk cards should be account-wide not character-locked. Plans, recipes, etc - its bullshit you have to repeat some of the stuff
---
Idk why they would. They are pretty limited and stop working when you are damaged.
---
It’s very annoying but not that shocking. I got to level 7 expecting something a little better. It seems like once you hit level 10 you might be able to start unlocking better items like the statue and power armor but I’m not 100% sure.
---
Truth
---
People are already up in arms about hellfire being in the game. I mentioned the terminal hours ago and people just went on about how it shouldn't be a thing yet.
---
I agree because I would hate to have to level up both characters I have to the max level
---
Again. 
---
Fallout was hardly the first franchise to take the paper and pen systems and bring them to PC..... There is more than a decade of games doing that before Fallout existed.  It was about as far from new as you can possibly get.
---
The post apocalyptic setting? That was definitely a rarely done concept. It was all high fantasy back then. 
---
Fallout 3 is a pretty iconic game. It's influence is pretty obvious. 
---
However a FPS/RPG? That wasn't exactly new either. See System Shock 2..... A decade prior. Or Mass effect just a year prior?
---
Fallout, while it is one of my favorite series of all time, isn't great because it's mechanically or genre innovating. It's the setting, the aesthetic, the sense of humour.
---
It's still broken , even some basic mechanics don't function to this day. But hey "thanks for still taking our shit and spending soem bucks on the way". No company would come out and say it's trash and they are sorry. But they have to "thank" the "community", can't let those last few sitting in the dark. Was disgusted watching that 76 spiel play out during E3, as if we're cattle. Hope you value that totally sincere thank you, don't forget to get some atoms on your way out.  If you think only hating just look op games as a service.
---
What screwed me over most of this evening is they changed the default pc push to talk button, so I kept thinking my mic wasn't working. Now that I went into the settings and chamged it back I've been better at talking with my team.
---
:)
---
Cheers got it sorted thank you
---
My tse tears through enemies, shotgun, heavy gun, rifle. Just have to have the build
---
Regardless of that the second your sights go past a human player their name pops up. Just keep your eyes peeled and move slow? I hide in bushes with the patriot suit and people run by me all the time so...
---
I’ve been playing since Fallout 1 came out, and lemme tell ya, “crazy things happen in a vault” didn’t start until Fallout 3. You young whippersnappers don’t understand what it was like to live in a perfectly normal vault that just happened to need a water chip. Which I provided! By walking uphill (both ways!) through the snowy post apocalyptic wasteland!
---
Food tasted better back then, too, for the record.
---
If people like it, more power to them. But I don't like Battle Royale in general, so I will just ignore the mode.
---
Think you need time spent in BR mode. Only played a few games but unlocked something. 
---
So maybe not just winning but staying alive as long as possable?
---
/u/Mistique actually makes sense and should be upvoted. Probably why Bethesda implemented this way.  
---
On consoles, the right to play the game is either associated to the disc (if bought physical copy) or the console (if bought digital copy), meaning you can play the game using different accounts/profiles. In this case, you're right.
---
But on a PC, it is different, right to play the game is linked to your Bethesda account. Meaning if you want 2 people playing the game, either they share the same account or buy two copies of the game.
---
https://www.gottabemobile.com/fallout-76-problems-fixes/
---
Thanks, fixed it just by deleting what ever said 2018 in my Data file.
---
What did you unlock a d hiw did you claim it?
---
Exactly, I've been running ironclad in the br and when I get scout or marine armour I will be just as tanky as power armour users, pair that with a 50 cal machine gun and I can melt them very easily
---
Been working perfectly for ranged isnt the samw aa not broken if its broken for certain weapons that means its broken, you have a funny way of saying broken "perfectly" lol
---
 (slaps you with hardback dictionary)
---
Try that. I play on ps4 but I feel for u man. This is a good game. Hope everything works out for u
---
ill try checking that where are they located
---
Would like to know too
---
Most of the new hate can be boiled down to 
---
I spent all day in NW and my stuff is still selling fine
---
Springs gears screws ultacite black titanium blastics fiber aluminum
---
Press tab.
---
Turn on pacifist mode when you enter events, or just keep it on so you cant be trolled by random high level players sending you invites to try and kill you. 
---
Also, try not to accept random invites too to much
---
Once you get to the last 3 groups alive, you start earning much more exp for being alive. You get like 200 for a decent match in 4th, 400 for third, and a bit over 1000 for 1st
---
Idk lol? BR is not really my thing so i just hopped in for a few games... But i couldnt find a gun with ammo so i crept around a lot and got few kills with sword.
---
Honestly have no idea but i did get something for staying alive so long... Maybe atoms?
---
Fallout's Battle Royale is intended to be a quick and competitive battle between individuals and teams. As players begin with none of their collected equipment or gear an emphasis in player skill is present
---
The default option is to be placed in a team with 1-3 other people when you join NW. Your team can deploy anywhere on the map and you do not have to be in any proximity to each other, or really interact with each other at all either, should you choose. Once you spawn in you will have to gather gear from containers and loot crates, and then: survive
---
This game mode is exceptionally different from Adventure or Survival and is more of a competitive and demonstrative sport than the rest of the game
---
Yay, it's alot of fun
---
Which is really bizarre.  
---
Like a lot of (initial) hate for ESO (beyond its early technical issues) was because it wasn't enough like Skyrim.  It was basically a awkward hybrid that compromised on too many things from the Elder Scrolls RPGs for the sake of fitting it into an MMORPG format.   One Tamriel and later system additions helped reduce that quite a bit and ESO seems to pretty much be up there near WoW and FFXIV nowadays. 
---
Meanwhile Fallout 76 is literally Fallout 4 with online multiplayer, along with some reworked/additional systems (perk functionality, mutations, etc.), no human NPCs or safe hubs (beyond maybe train stations), and overall it didn't compromise too heavily on its look/feel.  It is very much a Fallout game, yet people have been rabidly tearing it apart and leaping at every little bit of drama they can.  
---
Either way I feel like much like ESO, Fallout 76 is going down a path where it's going to succeed and grow, and the folks who want to be salty about it will just have to stay salty.
---
You tube tbh I could tell you but would take me 40 minutes to type it out check YouTube
---
In my opinion its ready, pvp is balanced and fair, loot crates and supplies arent buggy and messed up. I think they should release it now.
---
Noted 👍
---
The thing that happened that is kind of weird, got shot through a big tree. I was using it for cover to rez and watched the bullets come right through. It was like it wasn't there.
---
Your best bet starting out is just to pick up EVERYTHING and scrap like crazy, including weapons. Claiming workshops also helps a ton, and it’s always easier to claim/keep one on a team. Just go for any in the forest area and build resource collectors. Claiming gives you materials, aid, and plans, as well as the resources from the shop. Defending it also earns rewards.
---
Didn’t happen for me
---
That's not true. With the home xbox feature all Accounts on the xbox can use the games owned my a single a count AND use xbox love gold.
---
Ha yea i do too sometimes
---
Sorry that english is not my language you asshat !
---
Does anyone know how to level up S.p.e.c.i.a.l points for it? Ive gotten cards that require 3 or 9 but cant be equipped for obvious reasons..
---
I don't think so dude. I dont think you kept anything
---
That's exactly what I said...
---
As is its awesome, which I don't usually care for battle royal but I'm pleasantly surprised

Perks help with materials, aid items, and ammo.  They don’t function as passive skills always so you usually have to activate them yourself which isn’t hard just press the prompted button to “search”.  For materials it depends on what you need.  Find and locate sugar grove for plenty of steel, screws, and gears.  If it’s only one or two things you need you could always hover over the build item then click to tag search for missing items.  Then all items that have that material will have a magnifying glass on their name stating that it’s one you want.  Wood is everywhere.  Steel is in almost everything.  Build your Camp on a resource deposit or two for extra materials like concrete or copper.  There’s a map for all resource deposits as well.  For guns just kill and loot.  In the beginning it’ll be difficult since most the better gear is level locked.  Usually if you check venders they’ll have some and most high level players don’t mind crafting you a full set of armor for your level and a weapon.  Hope this helps.

Wait really? I've never played the game before until today and I still can't get in!
---
I watched the Bethesda e3 presentation live on twitch, and right after Bethesda wrapped up, 4 random nerds started bashing Bethesda and 76 in particular. Of the four of them, only three had even played the game and none of them had played since launch, but all four of them KNEW 76 was a terrible game that nobody plays or enjoys. 
---
I just rolled my eyes and then watched the Wastelanders trailer again. Their loss.
---
I got PA the first time I played. Spawned right in front of it. I thought it would give me an advantage but you are right a mini gun took me out almost instantly.
---
What a total  Chad.
---
Wait really? I've never played the game before and the farthest I've gotten is the load screen!
---
So fun, I totally suck but so fun!’
---
Set up your C.A.M.P next to a junk extractor (search google for fallout 76 resource map) and this’ll get you a random mix of junk, you very rarely need stuff like crystal and gold so you shouldn’t stockpile it, I mainly focus on looting steel and lead because you can use these to make bullets :) if you go onto a piece of junk you’ll be able to look at its components and tag certain ones, this will make any piece of junk containing any of those components have a little magnifying glass next to its name (very helpful to avoid stockpiling stuff you don’t need)
---
False, the name only pops up if they have fired a gun and are standing. Just did some tests. Yeah crouched in a bush is counted as behind a wall sort of like how bushes block vats.  
---
So yeah hiding in a bush with the right cosmetics is viable. got to second doing it, though I am a bad shot in combat.
---
Rewards are granted by leaving up your overseer rank. After a match an after match report shows up and displays your progress towards the next rank as well and the rewards for the next four or five ranks. Most are perk card packs. But for example, rank 2, you unlock the vault 51 jumpsuit in the atom shop.  I would bet that after 20-25 levels another cosmetic will appear and be unlocked on the atom shop for you to equip. Considering some of the laser grids and terminals require an overseer rank of 87. I would imagine the best rewards are in high tiers that you will only get a glimpse of when you get close to them.
---
What? Did you not enjoy getting the shit beat out of you? /s
---
[New phone background.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/uQ5rGqp)
---
The highest vault grid I have seen is 30. Where is the 87?
---
Adhesive, a scrap weapons to learn mods once you notice your not learning anything start selling them, keep all stims radaway and disease cures
---
Cheeky
---
The thing with Fallout 76 though is that it has the potential to become popular.  With the Wastelanders update it'll be the closest it likely can be to a multiplayer Fallout, with the last big component being private modded servers which they've stated will be sometime after the game's first year.  
---
It could very likely hit a point where it redeems itself if Bethesda keeps doing what they've been doing so far to improve things.
---
Was this the same issue you had?  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/WPSpjQQ](https://imgur.com/a/WPSpjQQ)
---
Wood, steel and lead are generally the ones I go for as these get used up pretty quickly on base building + ammo
---
Ok well let us know if you figure it out. You can see some challenges added in and i definitely got some atoms. Like i said tho BR is not my thing and only played for hr or so today
---
Go back to the Rainbow six subreddit.
---
The only issue I have is how long is takes for the map to open up. It's only a few seconds but it's very annoying. Other then that it's flawless
---
Welcome to battle royales hahah. Forreal I say the same thing at times when I play apex
---
I found a solution, I had to crack open the ini file in My Games and add " **bGamepadEnable=0** " under General.
---
Lmao you mad? He asked what other games does that, i shared info. Who knows he might like games that keep dlc free and play it
---
The level 87 wasnt a laser grid but a terminal. I just grouped them together. I don’t remember what terminal it was.
---
Don't hit the robots at Whitespring
---
You must have the fill team checkbox deselected.
---
Oh hard same. I think I’ve killed three people today, one of which had no weapons! But it’s a blast.
---
Made friends with a lvl 100 and followed him around
---
Stated working this arvo
---
Pretty sure vats being broken goes through language barriers. Ass hat!
---
Youre near invisible at the start of the match for quite a while until you either interact with something/attack a player, use that time to stake out your surroundings and locate some boxes.
---
Oh god... pay to win!? With what?? Garbage repair kits that you get a better version of IN GAME? No one buys that shit, and if they do who cares. Anyways, that’s one game. It wasn’t a literal question. And is the dlc new maps? Because if so I don’t think that matches up to the additions that Bethesda is making. I personally have never played a game with free dlc that equates to fo76.
---
As long as you're getting sneak bonuses then it works. Stealth doesn't last for long when you're firing unsuppressed weapons though.
---
I have not, no. I haven't figured out what this thing is yet, other than I get shot and die lots. I have no gun, but hey, I guess that's normal? Or something?
---
As soon as I read the "VATS will close after a kill" I thought to myself that this will stuff up Gun-Fu. I'm not happy to find out I was right.
---
Just give us deathmatches with rewards for participating and greater rewards for winning.
---
You allocate your SPECIALS in adventure mode.
---
2-3 mins to a find match
---
And it's funny because the day after the Bethesda conference the same YouTubers who've been constantly frothing at the mouth over 76 started regurgitating the same things they've been saying.  Also using the argument "HuMaN nPcS sHoUlD hAvE bEeN a BaSiC fEaTuRe".
---
Yeah, I noticed that too..
---
"Team Eliminated"

No, you aren't a paid beth shill. Yes, you are a idiot consumer. But it's ok beth does their best to tickle your balls and kiss you on the cheek while this shit is still burning.
---
[Oxhorns live stream of nuclear winter](https://youtu.be/vgDmKuKV3Ic)  if you go to about 16 mins in oxhorn explores the vault and you can see some of the high level terminals that range from 20-71
---
Ok cool, I’ll have to just ask some high level players for some startup stuff. I’ll definitely look up that map for the resources.
---
This one dude just practically wrote me a thesis over on r/NintendoSwitch about how FALLOUT 76 BAD. Like, seriously an essay.
---
I assume these come back to the regular game?
---
If you’re on PS4 I’d be willing to help with what I can.
---
No there is no faster way to start. You have to do it from the menu every time
---
I'm sure there's a good chunk of folks who're still salty that ESO turned around and is successful enough to where it's one of the only relevant/regularly talked about MMOs still.
---
I really like it too actually, much better than I anticipated.
---
If you’re on PS4 I’d be willing to help with what I can!  Oh and do as many events as you can.  Always good loot from them.
---
Run while you still can. There are better devs and games out there.
---
make sure you set in the display options to make it fullscreen.  anything else may hinder your FPS.
---
Get your 1400, or as much as you can from the vendor bots by selling anything they'll buy.  Get ALL the plastic, as you'll need it to bulk your excess junk.  The most of any junk I keep is 100.  Building or ammo making would require more.
---
As the other guy said, it's all to do with your adventure special. So if you want a different set of perks you might want to make an adventure character to suit.
---
1800+ hours in. Been banned unjustly, spent over $300 on that account, bought a fresh one, spent over $300 on the new one.
---
The game itself is good. Bethesda are shit. People need to not give gaming companies slack. The games reputation is fucking ruined by the first 3 months. Hopefully it can recover.
---
In your pip-boy under the Junk tab, press RB (on console at least) for component view. Once there, scroll down clicking on adhesive, screws, springs, and gears. Items in the world containing these components will then be marked with a little magnifying glass icon. 
---
The point is to help you stock up on those very necessary bits and bobs. Other important components are ballistic fiber, circuitry, oil, and even nuclear waste. Have fun!
---
This would be a lifesaver
---
Everybody loves a bit of full release

---
just for good measure.
---
We are not unworthy consumers, we are their customers. You can’t have a business without us.
---
Yeah, I don't think folks understand that the game world is supposed to have an evolving story.   It made sense for us to start off being released into an inhospitable wasteland where everyone is dead.  We find out exactly why and how it happened and what we can do to try and fix shit.
---
Lo and behold, after many months of reclamation efforts Human NPCs are now going to start settling in, and we may very well see the birth of NPC safe hubs and such (though I'd hope/guess we'll have to do defense events for them).
---
Now I just need to remember how to edit my SPECIAL...
---
I know I’m late and somebody already told you iron ore is what gets you steel, but if you claim Grafton steel yard and set up the extractors, you can get a ton of steel.
---
What he said except that gears are pretty easy to find and you can easily farm titanium once you’ve made your Excavator armor. Even Ultracite is pretty easy to find. But for sure hoard screws, springs, aluminum and ballistic fiber. Those are always needed even at L200.
---
I own the game since day 1 and i really like the idea of making this mode free to play forever, keeping the stuff we got in the atom shop still visible in this mode makes me wonder if this is the way they are going with it.. Imo It's the perfect way to get new players and to keep selling things on the atom shop.
---
This has been happening to people long before nuclear winter, it's an ongoing bug.
---
Lol no its a connection issue. Turn off and turn on kinda thing. Modem, PC or box, refresh the stuffs.
---
I understand games as a service.  20 years ago games were $50...some $60. Adjusted for inflation that should be $90 to $100 today.  There was a turning point where development costs got larger and a choice had to be made.  Two futures existed at that point...the one we are in and the other path not chosen.  
---
1) going forward release games without dlc, (as in all the dlc would be included originally which is usually about an extra $30-40).  Then each game costs $90-100.  Steeper price of admission and longer development, (but personally this is the future I would have chosen because I am not a fan of games as a service.,.but I do understand why the model exists).
---
2) the other future is a lower price of admission keeping the cost of games at $60 and releasing the dlc over the next year adding that extra $30-40 necessary for the times changing.  Most all things are more expensive than 20 years ago.  Not all, but most.  Now with this model you have what can feel like an incomplete game many times to me.  Games as a service don’t feel like complete games with add-ons but more like a game released with a chunk missing.  But, it does allow the price to stay the same with a full purchase of $90-100 ostensibly available should you like the base game.  
---
As consumers we can’t have our cake and eat it too,  they have to make up a 20 year cost difference somehow.  This is the path they have chosen, (the industry by and large), and it is what it is.  I can tail against games as a service ( because I don’t like them either), but I can not expect the result to change how much money I spend for the most part.  It could be a little more expensive or less expensive, but it won’t meet the necessary budget otherwise.  
---
Either way, though, the game industry and the consumers are the ones that have chosen this path with games as a service.  One can get individuals to choose differently, but as a pack we’re sort of useless unless we agree on something...and it is notoriously difficult to get us all to agree on anything...lol.  My thanks is not for those decisions, it is simply for continuing to support the game in an industry where that doesn’t always happen.  No offense meant at all, and I could be wrong about any or all of it.  There are much smarter people on here than me who probably have a better knowledge of the exact reason/mechanism the industry developed in order to keep prices down relative to everything else going up the last 20 years.
---
Plus they are very noisy. The footsteps are very noticeable, giving your position.
---
Yeeah. I jumped to overseer level 3 immediately. Also I got about 1000 exp for adventure.
---
Jeez i never said f76 has pay to win so take a chill pill lol i simply said "free dlc ans no pay to win" since most paid dlc games have pay to win. I agree med kits dont give you a big ass advantage to the point its game breaking. Plus they are ewsy to get with SBQ. And Yes on R6s its mostly maps. Also limited time events like Outbreak. It was so good they are making it its own game.
---
You can farm titanium while your farming gears - from moleminers
---
So, now 15 days later how does it feel? I like it lol.
---
lmao so only cosmetic items from Nuclear Winter? not even going to touch it then I am going to wait for more adventure based content.
---
Good point
---
It is pretty weird right?  Also you can get duplicates like they could not prevent that form happening.  You get a dupe it eats it and gives you 50 exp.
---
Thankfully I recently PL'ed an alt up to 40ish to play around with a new build.  The point spread is pretty favorable currently and gives me an advantage.  I have three 9 point cards equipped.  Frog legs is awesome btw..  Id rather be playing a blank BR only char or my STR melee main char but 15 str and not much else is ugh for BR.
---
My username is relevant here, you mean the vending machines are welcome mats right? Not an actual new plan or anything?
---
All the better to poop myself in when the fire storm arrives.
---
Got kinda mixed feelings here.
---
Yes, I really appreciate how Bethesda doesn’t gave up on the game after the more than rough launch, but instead keeps adding content and fixes constantly. And seeing how much the game has developed in about half a year is quite amazing.
---
On the other hand, I still feel that releasing the game in the state that it was at the time for a full AAA price was just an unexcusable insult. Sure, it was to be expected that there would be hickups to iron out. But these were much more than minor hickups. And these were quite obvious to everyone.
---
Why did they feel they need to rush the release? Just should have stayed in Beta for a few more months, and what a much better launch it would have been…
---
I'm rather terrible at it, but feel like it's fun. And when you're bored of just doing dailies over and over and over it's nice to have a mode where your Adventure stats/armor/weapons don't matter and you can just go shoot each other.
---
As so many of who posted, I am not a BR fan myself. I jumped in after patch and started playing it, had a blast, made it to level 5 overseer. I barely got myself to go back into adventure mode to scrap some legendary junk I had. There were at most 10 people on the server, and only one above 100. So everyone was playing BR mostly.
---
After the short experience I had, I think it needs some balance changes/improvements. I am aware this is not the final form so this is all based on what is currently available.
---
First of all, solo matches. I do not want to be forced to team up with randoms, and I do not want to be forced to play every match against teams. I hope it was done in this way now because of the free trial, so people are "incentivized" to group up for it. 
---
Balance seems a tad bit out of place. With the right cards and weapons, someone can melt mostly anyone regardless of armor. We might have the OP builds issue we have already, but at a different scale and situation.
---
Overseer ranks. Some parts of the vault/terminals/stuff requires very high levels of overseer. There are some for 100+. That is a lot of grinding to do, and while it is fun, it might be a little bit to much, depending on the XP scaling with levels.
---
Sometimes the name and health bar appear at far distances when aiming towards players, making it easy to spot them.
---
Getting stuck on small obstacles that are sometimes in bushes is annoying.
---
The screams are absolutely brilliant!
---
With some adjustments I really feel that this mode will be really fun for a long time.
---
As a noob focus on leveling for now. as you get better equipped and your stash starts backing up as long as you try to keep 100 of each type junk you'll never have junk problems. Once I finished the main story line and all the side missions I cared for my junk stash became my secondary quest generator in a way. if I am over 100 I sell or drop it. if I am under 100 I farm for that junk specific. its an easy goal to aim for and your balance is always shifting so keeping everything 100 is a continuous source of "something to do" at level 250 with 1k hours that starts to become important. OH extra junk you cannot sell. if you have a ton of steel and need to toss it for example, make throwing knifes or something to get some xp out of it. you'll have to build according to what you have but instead of just throwing it out crafting can be a good source of xp and help you eliminate too much of any material you cant sell.
---
Yup, I would buy the next one.  (I mean of course only if it was one I was interested in, but for arguments sake let’s say it was Fallout 5).  Fool me once shame on you, but fool me twice...  
---
We all stuck together on a rough ride.  I would buy the next one after launch based on what happened.  But if the same thing happened again, I would be hard pressed to buy the one after that.
---
Oh my bad lol. I’ve had this argument so many times on this sub! I feel like if people are dumb enough to buy those things then let them. That certainly isn’t effecting me and it gives them 0 advantage over me. It probably is targeted towards more casual players anyways. I’m not discrediting rainbow six I’m just saying hardly anyone would give out free dlc that is damn near equal to the base game. Down vote me if you want, that’s a fact tho!
---
A lot, I have a perception perk card for 40% more damage with auto weapons lol got to be the best perk card going for pvp? Also have one where I can jump 300% higher. Already pretty satisfied with these two and am only level 4.
---
&gt; Apologise for what? is my question. The game was never garbage, a lot of the people who want Todd and Bethesda to be apologising for the game haven't played since launch. People spoke, they listened and they made the changes and the game is much better off for it, actions speak louder than words and they've done plenty of good actions.
---
Honestly at this point I'm convinced people want to hear him say, "We're sorry we made Fallout 76".   Because somehow there are folks who still want to write this off as an elaborate cash grab and don't like that Todd called 76 a "passion project".  
---
Like I don't believe those people want to hear anything else from Todd other than him admitting that Fallout 76 was a mistake, which it clearly isn't.
---
I bought the actual bundle and got my extra 500 atoms but I don't seem to have gotten my coat.
---
Make it 15.
---
Dude... literally same thing here! Had enough camp space before the update, I know that. Wanted to build the new lamp. But now I was full, so I deleted one light, then a purifier (already got just 2), 3 crops and another light, still full and can’t craft the deleted items back. Seriously, we get one update/dlc and a shitload of bugs emerge. After 7 months still the same crap...
---
I'm a huge Fortnite fan though I mostly play the non-BR 20v20 respawn mode (first team to 150 kills wins). I watch a lot of streams and would say that both Fortnite and Fallout 3/NV/4 are among my top games ever. Never played more realistic BR games like H1Z1 or PUBG. My favorite mode in Fortnite was actually 50 v 50 and the last team standing won, I think that mode was too laggy so they haven't had it in a while. I kind of play Fortnite as an adventure game and it has some really amazing environmental storytelling which to me is one of the things I love about ESO/FO games.
---
I didn't like FO76 mostly because of the constant need to eat and drink, would have rather just used stimpaks. Also the game didn't feel very stable so I figured I'd wait. I only played on game of Nuclear Winter so far and it did lag pretty hard when I got attacked with a mini-gun. That was on Xbox and I have the PC version too so I'll try that tomorrow.
---
Right off the bat I love these basic things which aren't in Fortnite: armor, melee weapons, and the ability to switch between first and third person. Also building actual "forts" instead of fast paced build battles is going to be a lot of fun. Also in Fortnite the guns have bloom and I'm a huge fan of the guns in Fallout 4 and really liked the shooting in FO76 when I played it. So I think if this mode feels stable I will get into it.
---
Lmao you good fam
---
I like this while were at it let's have the ability to make firing ranges. Dummies, Targets and ammo crate/cans to even place ammo in ( it doesnt count toward stash space perhaps? )
---
I tried like 4 rounds and I'm not that into it. I've never liked BR modes though so eh
---
While i understand not wanting rewards lvl locked to a mode you dont want to play it still makes sense. I mean if i was a player all-in on the Nuclear Winter mode id feel a little cheated if my progression in it didnt mean anything other than higher lvls and a few caps. But honestly, while im enjoying the gameplay, im not holding my breath to hav any mind blowing lore from vault 51 from unlocking new areas. I’ll save my hype for Wastelanders.
---
I sell two of the  “You have been insulted” notes for 7676 caps. No bites thus far.
---
Also, not my idea, stole it from someone here.
---
However, I have been wanting to build a third vending machine with just that note and a copious amount of salt, fee of charge.
---
all weapons have craftable level ranges so it might be 10-20-30-40-50, some only go upto 45. I think these become available as you get to those levels and ofc some require perk cards like gunsmith. random drops are completely random. don't quote me on it but i'm sure you can get shotguns from level 10 maybe 15.
---
They are icons or different stash boxes from the atomic shop, you can't open them.
---
Same
---
I can't believe people are playing that shit battle royal, sluts like you inspire Bethesda to make more terrible content
---
I'd say "#GamerGaters first," but the poor sun didn't do anything to deserve that hell.
---
I cannot find it on any map showing where deposit locations are could you be more exact or make an image?
---
X0-1 armor unlocked at lvl 15. I'm lvl 14
---
Skin
---
If you got “The letter” reports are you will be ignored
---
You have been banned *temporarily* until such time as they believe the dupe loop holes have been plugged, at which time, the duping accounts are to be unlocked
---
Yeah, they said they were trying to fill their 2 TB hard drive. It’s fixed now though.
---
well least there's a lot less bored gankers in adventure mode for the time being. fusion core farming fool I am !!:P
---
I hate BR games. Actually, love this one. It's pretty fun. Not gonna spend all my time there, but I think it what they needed to bring some potential new players to the game. It's a proper PvP format. Survival was a silly Idea. It should have been competitive modes with proper PvP modes, king of the hill, CTF, President, deathmatch, team deathmatch, ect. Probably some modes I am forgetting. Some faction style PvP battles would be great. It needs a healthy PvP.
---
That makes sense.... sucks to be using a low level character then... dont have full perk loadout. No wonder Im dying heaps.
---
Didnt happen to me.
---
AFAIK you don’t need stimpak to revive other players
---
I'm lvl 14
---
70% towards 15
---
Gave it a go once but not my thing, I only really play RPGs anyway so nothing for me in that mode.
---
Dose that count as a victory or a tie?
---
Nope hate it, picked up half decent weapons and armor but keep being killed in close quarters whilst giving no damage to the opponent makes no sense.
---
Also it has made the adventure servers unstable.
---
No excuses needed, honestly I think you have a better picture of it than me by the looks of it. It's not the price that's a issue for me honestly. It's mostly the part of companies recycling a lot of stuff from old games and not even trying to hide it. Next to that I have played 76 quite a bit and noticed a lot of this early on but decided to stick with it. Hoping it would follow the part of games as a service. But it just felt more and more like incomplete parts were pushed aside under the disguise of it being a service.
---
I find it hard to really word what I mean by that last sentence. What it boils down to is the danger of games as a service being used a way to sell incomplete products (not talking about dlc but basic game functions). Also hopefully my post wasn't too harsh. Just amazed still about E3 and the current state of 76. I quit not too long ago and was secretly hoping for something.
---
PS4?
---
It sounds like your missing a file from a quick google search. Make sure your not interneting while download a massive file like this. You may have to re download unfortunately.
---
It's a player icon. Nothing special. If you want to equip it, go to the atom shop under icons and scroll near the bottom, you can choose to equip it there
---
You sure it's not just the visual bug that causes your collections to display zero? You might not have actually lost anything.
---
Someone set one out for my level 2 friend. 
---
I of course let him drink it.
---
The one thing fans and haters can agree on.
---
Like i would ever go back to adventure mode haha.
---
might as well try it, it's pretty fun
---
I did only one match but knocked someone in PA with a 3-4 hits of a combat shotgun... and then his teammate one shotted me in my scout armor. I did one match as a solo to preview, will try filling tomorrow!
---
Kermit
---
There is a sign with the fallout guy wearing jewelry in the vault and you can equip it there or from the atomic shop screen.
---
Which skin?
---
Maybe that's the difference.
---
Yeah Sutton and Flatwoods are the two biggest towns and sometimes there's 4 squads all spawning on the same one and other times nobody goes there
---
I've played a good number of rounds though and I've kinda come to the conclusion it's better to spawn on one of the big areas and expect a clusterfuck and be pleasantly surprised when you have the whole town to yourself than it is to spawn out in the middle of nowhere thinking you'll be alone then realising other people had the same idea and there's 6 of you racing to find the one crate that spawns there
---
Some camo blue skin. Ugly
---
I've never heard of that bug. I'll make a run to try to buy a Legendary and see if I have the scrips still.
---
PS4 not a single crash for 2 months
---
Another thing I wasnt aware of.. use a max level character :/ because the cards are based on your adventure mode perk layout.. which is kinda frustrating.
---
I'm over 1000 hrs also. Definitely a fun game. I live watching the wife run full steam at a Hermit Crab &amp; give it a good taste of whatever melee weapon she happens to have on her at the time.
---
The way I see it is the glitches are Vault Tec testing it's next lineup of vault dwellers. It's worth thinking about since whenever we are all playing, it's only a simulation.
---
Nothing too special. I remember it was something that dropped normally, I think an assault or combat rifle. Would have been nice if it wasn't down to 10 players where we all already had out gear set up
---
Yeah but flstwoods is quite a distance away
---
Oh so they are perma banned. Gotcha.
---
No, his "Post mortems" are specifically about dead games. Except for this one. I think he realised the game isn't dying like he desperately wants it to and wanted to squeeze in his two minutes hate while the clickbait's still good.
---
It's irritating because he's usually one of the better YouTubers - his videos on things like paid loot boxes, crunch culture, toxic work environments and bigotry in the gaming community are excellent and important - but he's one of the very worst when it comes to hating Bethesda because they're Bethesda because they're Bethesda.
---
I honestly see no issue in doing so. Its just a lot easier on me to give the benefit of the doubt to a game company that has accepted it's own mistakes and is attempting to make it up to the playerbase and has been following player feedback very well. Regardless of past issues, I don't think moving goalposts backwards through time helps anyone.
---
Guess ill need to age my character up a bit.
---
Yeah, that's how mine looked. I think pausing the download is what kept messing it up. My second try downloading is still going and the total file size hasn't changed. I haven't paused it and it's been steady at 61.91GB.
---
Few caps to a vendor, like 10-20c
---
I scrap them myself, you get bugger all for doing so though
---
Parts aren’t worth money unless they’re modded
---
Im at 12 rn and theres an overseer chair at 10 and what looks like kellogs pistol at 11
---
I know fixing pa at a pa station does that. Sometimes when Things die they rattle and get stuck places too though happens often at whitesprings
---
Well shit for me then, just wasted my allowance.   
---
I'm currently backing up the files atm hoping I can just copy it over just in case.
---
You are a winner! They are still there!
---
To give a more high-level answer:
---
What I DON‘T like that this mode is the most Fallout unlike experience. All the elements that differentiated the (3D) Fallouts from mere shooter games are gone. IMO Fallout is all about consequences of your actions. The most fun I‘ve had with Fallout so far was FO4‘s survival mode: Ramped up difficulty and no quick saves. I‘ve you’ve died after 1 hour roaming around in the Glowing Sea - tough luck! You lose all of your progress/items and go back to your last bed/mattress/sleeping bag save point. Better be more careful next time mf! NW seems to be the exact opposite: A more casual and fast-paced experience with no consequences whatsoever.
---
BUT.
---
What I DO like though is that it exists! FO76 desperately needed some good press and, judging from recent posts here, it seems that Bethesda knocked it out of the park with this one. It gives me hope that the new Wastelanders DLC will be as well thought/designed. So definitely two thumbs up from me here.
---
You can use the old ones for it.
---
Depends if you have the atoms allready for the scrapping challange for scrapping power armor items.
---
I agree, the one modification I would make is give it a slight delay or countdown after you drop in order to make everyone aware that the game has started.
---
You dont need titanium for a long time so forget that. Screws and glue to build new guns and mods..
---
Lead is key for ammo
---
Aluminium is good too.
---
The best method i have found is 100. After you have 100 of something bulk the extra at a tinkers table and sell it to a bot. Adjust as your game play need. As you move along in your build you will need diffrent things.
---
Example: copper and crystal is uber important to a laser build but almost wothless to a balistic build.
---
From what I’ve gathered
---
I’m surprised this post has been left up actually, usually mods are all over it and pull them all
---
Ok, but that plus their bold faced lie marketing scheme of listing shit for a discounted price when it was never actually a discount to begin with is some untrustworthy shit too. They're being sketchy as fuck that's all I'm saying.
---
Amen
---
But as a noob all of that is not important.  What is key is ammo armor and a brand new gun.
---
Atomic shop menu. If you equip an outfit in the game mode it unequips any armor you may have gotten though 😕
---
Yeah it's pretty fun and a nice break from adventure. I had a really funny win when it was 2 squads left. The last squad was up on the bridge and the circle closed in on them, leaving them stuck in the middle of the bridge. We were below and built a house to cover from their bullets. Eventually after a lot of sniping the circle moved and they were forced to suicide off the bridge or burn to death, giving us the win.
---
It’s says stalemate, I think it means it was a tie
---
I understood that reference.
---
i think they’re trying to go back to go back to the older days where everything was free (F3) or everything was brown (NV) /s
---
No issues for me and my team. Played all day today no disconnects.
---
Awesome I’m only at 5 right now but look forward to leveling up as much as possible before the beta ends.
---
Yeeeeeeeep. I have enjoyed the game immensely despite it's glaring flaws, but I'm exhausted at this point. If Wastelanders brings in anything meaningful to the survival mode, I'll probably revisit the game then.
---
Might be asleep tbh
---
Come across any machine gun sound glitches?
---
1440 monitor i assume?
---
I am glad you guys having fun, and i know i get downvoted for hell for this. 
---
But i bought a game for being a good Fallout MMO ... This is just wasted resources and time for gamemode which is already STUFFED on market. I am glad people having fun. 
---
I had a lot of fun in a game. But it is nowhere it should be as it is now. Again just a waste of resources IMO ...
---
I loved Fallout. And I didnt really like this game much. There was a lot of good things going on for it, but mostly frustrating for me. Between the relentless grind and the existence of the real-money Atom store, the multitude of bugs, lack of off-line playability (my internet makes it so that I often lose lots of progress and invested resources), and unavoidable PVP and griefing, FO76 became a great disappointment. To me and my 3 friends who bought it together.
---
I like subbing this place, though, because I like seeing the good parts of it. And I love Fallout, still. 
---
I keep hoping that one day I can come back to an actual decent game. I hope the new Wastelanders update later helps enough that I might like it and get my $60 worth.
---
Its fun but its based in extreme luck..
---
Within a weeks time I ran the full gambit of emotions. First knee jerk reaction was we don't need a BR in 76, then I thought about it and concluded that I'm indifferent because like survival, I won't play it. Then I became intrigued by how it would work and when they announced all the stuff in that mode I became excited. And now, having played several matches (with one 7th place finish), I'm in love. I think the best thing about it is you have nothing to loose and everything to gain from playing that mode. I don't like dying in adventure and I sure as hell don't like dying in survival (which I won't even play), but I go into this mode expecting to die and just trying to take as many with me as possible. I like that you don't loose any junk/chems/caps and instead are able to gain xp and caps.
---
Any chance I could buy or trade it from your friend or trade it, I've been trying to farm it for my responder character that lives in Flatwoods now for about a week with no luck on any of parts.
---
That's what I ended up doing too. I found this (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9st86q/how_to_fix_data_redownloading_if_you_backed_up/) and I think it helped the download go a little faster at first, but I won't really know if it worked until it's finished.
---
Pretty much yes
---
Better than broken game mechanics not being addressed. Its luck based but atleast you last longer than 5 seconds
---
1920x1080
---
What makes it fun compared to screecher filled BR?
---
Is there already a list of ranks/rewards?
---
It's a preview of beta of the mode.
---
Tbh I didn’t notice. Not saying the mode is bug free. My comment revolves around getting disconnected. On Xbox as well
---
Great idea it seems simple and it would improve creating a build also nice just for a shooting range in a military style camp!
---
Oh shit I have to make wastelander championship wrestling now!
---
Nope. But we know there are rewards for rank
---
Meh..
---
I ended up with a less-than-optimal team that all spawned in different locations and died in the first 2 mins. I was left completely alone for each of my encounters during that match. I ended up getting a fair few kills, including wiping out a squad of three on the bridge early on. It ended up being me trapped in a tower against the final three people. I downed two of them and barely died to the other. Considering the circumstances, I consider that a win, especially because I downed one of the guys WHILE FALLING FROM THE TOWER
---
It seemed like whenever I got close to the sound my game would freeze. Brains probably fried from the anger
---
Because many people have multiple characters and it leads to the following:
---
1. They might have other characters with different special points distribution and they don't want to respec their main to try out different playstyle in NW.
---
2. One does not want to collect all the rewards working twice as hard for the second character and even more beyond that. Would you be happy if for example you'd need to buy atomic shop items for each of your chars separately?
---
Male sure it not running in a window. I had a prob where i had fullscreen but the game said it was windowed. The answer is out there cause ppl play this on a console.
---
I’m not very good so my only gripe so far is having to wait so long to get back into a game. I wish when you died it just booted you back into the Vault.
---
Other than that I absolutely love it. Like what most people are already saying, I hate BR. Love BR76 though.
---
Uhh, what exactly were you expecting? I'm enjoying the mode so far but I would be infuriated if there were some OP perks or plans for overseer level 75 or something
---
What platform?
---
its fullscreen
---
It would need the ability to team up and switch people out too. Or at least provide two options after a match
---
You get caps and xp for the character you go in with.
---
Would be nice to have a solo mode
---
Don’t listen to this guy... use your starting perks there the best, just don’t get on my team thank you.
---
Yeah nah, that's just a cheater. These losers found a way to cheat within 12 hours of the game mode's launch
---
Ps4
---
Just keep scrapping them, you get 80 atoms for scrapping 76 power armor parts. After you get done with that, sell them to vendors or just don't bother picking them up. They have a horrendous weight-to-value ratio.
---
I think your second point is an apt analogy, and why that might should be patched at the earliest convenience
---
What is the file editing you did? Every patch and update can wreck mods
---
same here mate. I got a pretty nice set-up and I drop down to 20 pretty often. I play on medium-low with a 1070, 32 gigs of ram, and a i7. Same issue :( It's just something up with the game I'm assuming.
---
My parallel with the bag analogy was that they said “bag” and they showed a canvas bag.  They delivered a nylon bag.  It still works the same, it has the same dimensions, same logo, still a bag.  But there is a difference between a nylon bag and a canvas bag.  Gaming journalism went berserk over that difference.  (Note I did not say them going berserk was unwarranted). He said they knew it was not going to have a high metacritic score.  Most titles I saw reporting on it said “Bethesda admits the game was broken” or some other paraphrased statement.  It’s not what he said, it has a slightly different meaning, but it does have a similar spirit with regards to knowing some people would be disappointed in the beginning.  What’s good for the goose is good for the gander.  Those that hold others accountable should also hold themselves accountable.  If the reviewing industry, (not sure that is even a thing...lol), wants to title an article with a quote that is “basically what he said” then they can expect “basically a bag.”  If they want to quote exactly what he said, then they deserve exactly a bag and vice versa.  So I understand this.  This was deserved maybe...but then by doing this we’re no better.  Conflict will always exist so long as neither side is willing to hold themselves with the same accountability with which they hold the opposition.  Where I live there was a horrible natural disaster about 10 years ago.  People rolled everything out of their houses as if it was ruined.  There was this notion that, “well I pay for the damn insurance I might as well use it.”  And they paid, I mean they really paid.  People remodeled their homes, it was insane.  Because of this new laws were implemented and changes were made to how insurance is paid out.  Fast forward and now many people have lost their homes because they could not get the insurance to pay.  Did they deserve that? Do others who held themselves accountable during that first storm deserve that?  I am not sure how to make such a moral judgement.  But what I do know is that if they held themselves accountable and the insurance company accountable the first time, everything would have worked for the people the second time as well. The people lost their voice, because they simply could not help themselves.  Honestly it’s late.  I may not be making sense at this point.  Long story short I find it no less disingenuous to show a canvas bag and ship a nylon one than to quote him saying it was broken rather than quoting what he said.
---
Nuclear Winter is fun, yes, but also very clunky (but well... Fallout 76 is clunky afterall). 
---
It's not really in the same league than PUBG.
---
But it's fun. I do agree.
---
To me if you put it what he said before it's actually worse because he's playing dumb and treating the people who bought the game like idiots. It's just catchier without it. The sentiment remains the same, don't doubt that for a second.
---
"Reported" all anyone does anymore these days.. Scrub
---
Cerberus... three headed dog... three... dog... THREE DOG
---
My fastest round was when I spawned near glowing Snallyghaster and was too slow to get a weapon. Really quick.
---
If you genuinely hated Battle Royale games you probably wouldn’t be enjoying this.
---
It seems to me you just disliked something for being popular without actually giving it a fair chance before, and now that you’ve gotten a taste you understand the obvious appeal.
---
Sometimes people carry a lot of shit with them, especially when equipped with perks and armor with junk weight reduction.
---
I had a young guy claim he'd been "Jew punched" in NW this morning. Playing since November and I hadn't heard that kind of thing before.
---
He's not alive during NV either. He's an AI, although I don't remember if he's prewar or postwar
---
why aren't there scorched mutants FVE maybe?
---
If you enjoying with this keep going but maximizing perk cards are important for benefit from them well.
---
I went back to adventure and my camp was missing, no warning, I joined another server and everything was ok again.
---
I mean its a pre beta ...
---
For some reason this game mode is really fun and it actually does work, I think they've done a very good job with this battle royale mode
---
This leads me to believe it isn’t the Battle Royale genre that you didn’t like. You just didn’t like the popularity of it.
---
If you genuinely didn’t like the genre you wouldn’t be enjoying this, because it doesn’t do THAT much differently than the other popular BR games. It has its own quirks, but otherwise it’s the same basic gameplay loop.
---
Experiencing the same
---
This seems like a great way to start a new character lol might actually request someone come and nuka shine me and then just play on from where I end up 😂
---
You call getting stuck with 3 strangers who have all the self control and tactical wisdom of a bag of puppies fun??? Actually, ya! It is! LOL

13 is a shark 10mm skin btw, 15 seems to be one of the mid tier loot boxes
---
I picked it up last week to give it a chance. I’ve only met generous/helpful folk in game so far, great community!
---
Only PC thing i guess?
---
There is no such thing as Responders fire breathers outfit - you can either have firebreather outfit or responders fireman outfit. The first is worthless, guaranteed reward, the second rare event outfit.
---
The encryptid event is an easy one for this, people get downed there all the time and there's a large pool of water. Same thing with project paradise, there's plenty of water all around the facility and the alpha is going to smack everybody down in one hit
---
Oof. Bud you sound like a hardcore fanboy right now. Tone it down.
---
No one ever spawns at the mine near Slocum's Joe.
---
I thought it was an acknowledgement of how the community felt.  As in, the community felt like the the attitude was “just pay me” and he wanted to be real by utilizing that same language which was being thrown around.  I felt he was trying to illustrate that he understood by not allowing it to bake and develop longer it came out as “just pay us.” I could be wrong that is just what I perceived.
---
i have not seen anything on xb1 as of yet (overseer rank 10) prob just a pc thing or a trash kid that thinks he should be doing better
---
Just fyi, my settings have the intro video off and it still lets me play NW without issue. I think some of my other custom settings got reset with this update, haven't gotten to checking yet
---
A bit confusing on some parts but I got the gist of it, currently doing it now.
---
Did it work for you though?
---
Noice!
---
I feel like that would be way too claustrophobic
---
He’s not wrong stop downvoting him:(
---
Shovel is the unknown soldier event in the northeast corner of the map. Dunno about wolves
---
There are multiple posts about hackers, i belive it is because PC comunity can mod, Hopefuly we are safe on consoles. That's why i don't want mods at all.
---
I kept spawning at the Charleston Capital and jumping off into the water until I died. 
---
I did kill myself with frags at the river in front of the Overseer’s Camp, but it didn’t work as well he last time I had tried it.
---
I thought you couldn't have an active custom ini to play NW. I'll check it out tomorrow.
---
I have not tried it out, I am not a hater of Battle Royales, but I dislike the way everyone is throwing Battle Royales at my face.
---
I am glad at least that this Fallout Battle Royale is optional, I can still play my usual fallout without needing to play this mode, I might try it out for the sake of having a decent opinion.
---
I mean good story, but the game is honestly amazing enough as is
---
Hell yes. I could barely hit a guy at point blank range with a shotgun.
---
“Jew Punched”? What the actual fuck is that?
---
I just can’t wait for the inevitable “I was banned for mods but all I used was the UI upgrade” posts that will happen.  
---
Use the report function.
---
What country are you in?
---
Oh my god same here! I’m a VATS sneak build and holy crap it’s been hard
---
Before fallout 76 the only online game I used to play was Diablo 3. At some moment in the early days of it Blizzard implemented Paragon levelling system above the standard character levelling. Looked pretty much the same as the Overseer levels rn, paragons gave certain bonuses to just one character and you needed to farmparagons on each char separately which was quite a chore tbh.
---
Shortly after that they changed Paragon levels to be account wide so every char you play with could contribute to other chars' power. That makes playing the game with different characters (different classes/builds) more rewarding and the game overall less repetitive as I see it. Hope Bethesda will go the same path here.
---
As of now I don't think I'll invest much time in playing NW mode because of that. I want all the hard earned rewards (and surviving the entire br is not that easy if you're not a very skilled pvp'er) to be available to all of my characters.
---
I’d agree, but the Stealthboys are very powerful right now, and the SB Auto Laser/Tesla combo is Stupid OP.
---
We may have less FPS on console but at least we all play the game fair!
---
We can play some games tomorrow if you would like! Game mode is insane and just a blast with a team... Pm if you want to!
---
PC master race? Thank God I'm on console
---
That was pretty good.
---
Never used vats, never will 👌
---
Because people don't want to be bloodies. There should be other equally viable builds to chose.
---
“They look like their rotting” made my night.
---
Sorry I don’t have a fix for you but you are hilarious. Take an upvote anyways.
---
Well yeah, and all starting quests are there too. No way a level 5 can traverse a nuke zone to start responder quests.
---
same
---
Man I wish I could complain that’s how I get killed over and over again but I play on consoles. (Not saying it isn’t a problem, just lamenting my lack of skill)
---
Also on Xbox, and I play a ton in survival mode. To be fair it’s still in “beta”
---
I hope we see permanent survival servers where everyone starts over at lvl 1, and you can’t trade stuff over from other characters it would be fun &amp; challenging. 
---
You can have it with current rules or alter them. Just my 2 cents
---
All pc issue....
---
I think you know what I meant.
---
I guess you could call me a fanboy... it’s literally the only game I play. I’ve played since fo3 so I’m a pretty big fan of the series. Definitely don’t take offense from someone trying to shame me for being such a big fan. Well I’ve personally never played any game of this magnitude that has free dlc of this size. And idk how this predatory game practices got brought into it. Simply agreeing with OP that he’s not the only one who thinks this game is great, regardless of the online bashing it and its players get.
---
Like with shotgunner and all that?
---
Personally its really bugging me that a lvl 1 character doesnt get the same perk loadout as a lvl 50+ character - I thought we were supposed to be put on equal footing.
---
Don't think so after I told him how rare it is
---
Your hitbox is much larger and your resistance is only slightly better. 
---
You are weaker in PA. Just go with marine armor.
---
I don’t understand why Vats aren’t allowed. Yeah it’s aimbot but it eats your stamina like crazy and everyone would have it too. It’s in the other PvP mode too.
---
You know he means the fireman outfit from what he so clearly explains so don't bother trolling.
---
Since this is a “beta” for the nuclear winter dlc, does this mean that we will most likely lose our progress when the final version comes out.
---
That's odd, I've been using a quad-automatic tesla that I've been using as my primary and have never seen this issue. I'm on Xbox though, is it just a PC issue?
---
I just ended a 15hr stream so I may have been a bit out of it, but, it is supposed to be a *fair* gamemode and.. well, 
---
teleporting to players and around the map while not taking damage (at least based on Battle's comments) is a bit aggravating. It goes against everything the mode is.
---
I suppose your opinion varies, but I just hope this doesnt become as prevalent as it has in Survival.
---
Unless you have means to get 'a foot on the door' and high level speechcraft you are SoL.
---
Said that this applies to everything in life so master of the obvious moment I guess?
---
Otherwise it would seem that any and every suspension-related ticket has been excluded from any SLA metrics that they may abide by so it will just languish in the queue.
---
Lol dont do that. Thats from beta for one. And 2 its an online game... Re verfify your files. And hope you dont have to download again.
---
This is a monitor issue.
---
I generally understood that to likely be the case, though I do not wish to witch hunt, I just hope this does not become regular occurance.
---
You clearly have no idea what trolling means.
---
Sounds lovely. Wish the gameplay was near parity.
---
Have some God damn faith. It turned out fine
---
Its on Spotify
---
 
---
Did you get something for becoming overseer? Somekind of reward? Or mb more exp?
---
When you revive a player, aren’t you both in the same place? Anyway it didn’t register the challenge for me and I closed and restarted the game and it worked.
---
I'm a sniper with a IE lever with all steath perks and I do not one shot everything unless its night and a super mutant or weaker.
---
I mean I've got the VTU Baseball Cap and the Vault-Tec Jumpsuit which are both event clothing that I would offer for the single item; got them while trying to get the outfit.
---
all cards. you dont have equip every cards at the same time. Change them with others when needed.
---
Another suggestion I'd make is to have SPECIAL separate from your Adventure mode.  Doesn't really feel fun when you have to respec in Adventure mode or else create a brand new character just to go down a better path or work more towards what build you'd like to go for in BR.
---
Why does this post sound mildly threatening
---
Its only a free trial people not fully into game yet. They’ll do that sooner or later.
---
I've also noticed not many people spawn at the airport, expert with 3 squads all spawn there but again, you never know until it's too late
---
Post your build and we can fix that. I was doing it with a combat rifle, or an indication hunting rifle for super mutants.
---
The idea that you get random cards different from others doesn’t make it that 100% equal. But yah, apparently they are sort of pushing you to play adventure mode more to increase your special points.
---
Nah it's not the full version
---
Post your build and we can fix that. I was doing it with a combat rifle, or an instigating hunting rifle for super mutants.
---
Yes it is im listening to it right now.
---
I got you fam. What have you got for me?
---
Also on thw itunes store or apple music.
---
You need a new console or next gen.. Bethesda can do shit about my aging PC but i can. 
---
You got what you paid for.
---
Great list of potential improvements
---
It really does.. a level 1 character can get a level 9 perk card but cant use it. The higher level player gets the advantage :/ seems ridiculous to me after theyve gone to all the effort of wiping everything else for equal footing.
---
I dont support this " teleporting nonsense" or any of the cheat people have supposedly been mentioning but the mode isn't even 100% yet.. Its a beta so im sure the "losers" will find cracks in the holes.. If the speed demon is making him teleport then they need to fix that sht asap, especially since speed demon will probably be a must have..
---
The aiming in fallout76 isnt that good and im using maxed sensitivity but then again, I'm on console..
---
Is anyone else really sad they ran out of Xbox live but you get paid next week :(
---
Same, any idea what is that?
---
I think I understand what you were saying in that sentence.  It’s a really fine, (almost eerie), line that contrasts staying in budget from making more money.  If I was listening in on a meeting where they said, “we have to cut this part out for dlc or we won’t make our profit margin” (as in it is necessary to ensure everyone gets paid), I wouldn’t like it but I would understand it.  If the same thing was done but with the attitude, “you know...(clears throat)...we could make more money if we cut...”. I would feel nauseated.  To you I can see it looks like they have gone down that second road.  They may have...i don’t know.  But I do know I would not call them EA yet, and I am pretty sure EA is not going to make anything I would enjoy as compared to Bethesda.  If they have gone down that second road there is nothing for me to say or do that will change that.  But if there is even a chance they are honestly trying to still go down that first road then I don’t want them thinking I don’t appreciate the effort.  Even if you fail, little is less inspirational than having the effort you failed with chastised alongside the failure itself.  No thanks for the rocky start, no thanks for the bugs, the misleads, etc... but I have to believe things are gray and not black and white in order to hope for a better future.  So no thanks to all the stuff that made it rough, but thanks to all the effort and to making it better today than it was yesterday.  Essentially, I suppose, that’s my paradigm.
---
shovels can be found i sad ditch around whitesprings. they were digging up a safe.
---
 i more commonly find wolfs to the left of the map 
---
around tyler county fair.
---
As a non BR fan, which also didnt want another PvP mode...I found it very fun.For me it only lacks text chat, as every other BR game has it.
---
same for adventure mode
---
I use vats for 3 reasons spotting and shooting one hitters and melee fn rats. Everything else it's tap tap tap
---
I've still got a while to go before it finishes, but I need to go to bed so I'm leaving it going overnight. I'll report back in the morning though.
---
There is a terminal that says level 100
---
Sorry didn't know, ps4 i am on.
---
Bethesda can optimize the game to run at a decent framerate. not that im saying they arent doing that already.
---
Cool, hope it works for you I had to restart it as I had some folders that weren't there when I first started to download and it got all confusing lol.
---
You cant get mods for the crossbow yet, maybe in new wastelanders they add something
---
Ah, I understand now. I apologise. Yeah, its.. unlikely to be Speed Demon causing it.
---
Good point.  Maybe it’s just because it’s the trial period?
---
Also for players with no extra characters. I was super disappointed to see my perk points carried over, I was really hoping for a fresh start. I don't see what logic it makes for them to expect you to want the same exact perk points for a completely different style of gameplay.
---
Are you looking to become a more competitive player? What time zone?
---
lol, how is it a monitor issue?
---
Im on PC and mostly agree with you. But then again i can't go back to that pip boy menu. The scrolling for days.. Jesus.
---
I guarantee that ppl have found a way to put vats in BR mode. Thats what ppl do. I have only played a bit abd the hit markers and icons above every player were not my thing.
---
You said it, man.
---
&gt; No one remembers bad launches
---
Oh, there's definitely going to be a vocal minority who'll never lose their raging hateboners/Internet grudges on this game for defiling their precious Fallout franchise or whatever.
---
The real MVP!
---
Wait whats the best armour in the game?
---
50 cal machine gun goat
---
How is the game able to run on a old ass xbox just fine and your having issues? Problem is on your end dude.
---
Jet pack plans, t-45, t-50 or t-60. Legendary weapons,  treasure maps galore, mountains of chems, etc
---
There is kinda there is, it’s a billboard in the vault that sends you directly to the atom store. Kinda weird but the mode makes it a ton more interesting to buy clothing and skins.
---
Console safe space i forgot... Yes its a 3rd party company who is to blame for you being a cheap ass when it comes to game. How could i forget.

I wouldn’t mind being more competitive! I want to do well and play smart! 
---
I’m in PST!
---
This helped me ( I think ).

I really only have performance issues and inv management issues and otherwise the game mode is solid
---
“ Undeservedly eviscerated” Hello did you play the game at launch? Did you see the reasons for the criticism? You can’t seriously think that the game didn’t deserve the backlash.
---
I want to but I work almost all day tomorrow 😭 retail is the worst
---
There is a radio in the pipboy
---
USA, timezone PST! Sorry should have posted that with the original post!
---
How many caps you got?
---
That happens in a rare occurrence where the enemy fired their last bullet while being downed. The gun will fire endlessly and give away your position, or crash you out if the firing rate is too fast.
---
That's strange. Xbox had early BETA access, so why not the Demo?
---
I tried this, didn't do anything. Thanks for the attempt, though :)
---
You: “I’ve personally never played any game of this magnitude that has free DLC of this size...”
---
Also you: “I guess you could call me a fanboy, **its literally the only game I play**
---
Obviously you wouldn’t know what else is out there if you literally don’t play anything else. You are under informed on the matter to know what other games are offering.
---
I think more xp (placement xp). Not sure if the challenge unlock rewarded anything
---
Depends really on your build, for me it’s unyielding sentinel
---
They could also take tge other route... Where PC gets chat.. Buttons are not tied together cause its a controler port... Much better inventory thats the #1 mod.
---
We suffer cause of you players too. Plz dont throw out words like optimization when you have zero clue what it means.
---
No it ends on like 2min
---
All of those mechanics are still there. Stealth boy Tesla meta hasn’t changed, but it picked up the Shotgun laser pistol.
---
I thought it would just stay here. I thought only the free trial stayed till that date.
---
A little under 2k, if none of that works... Soft lips
---
My missile turrets were damaged but did not reappear when I auto-repaired.  Storing the floor they were sitting on made them appear in storage and they could be reinstalled.
---
Woomy?
---
I'm jumping in for this free week, if I like it I'll buy it so I get a good start ahead of the NPC update
---
Haha, tempting. I wanna help you, but you got nothing for me. Sorry bud.
---
Rampage kill at the end tossing me at 12 kills. Got the Auto laser pistol and I knew it was over.
---
Found 2 stealthboys and wiped 2 entire teams with each one.
---
Damn that is brutal, what by chance are you looking for?
---
its deff not a because of mods,  when you click BR mode on pc it literally deletes and resets your entire custom.ini file and you cant edit or make a new one without restarting the game, at which point it will delete/reset the file again.  so these hackers are flat out using trainers and other outside exploits

Them fixing console performance dosent prevent them from fixing pc problems. its not a console vs pc issue here. you seem very angry at consoles.
---
good to know, thanks.
---
Yup had a few of em already hitting me up to team up. Sure thing my stomping grounds are the mire and cranberry bog. Before i accepted the team invites i made sure i was standing by a fissure site every time. 
---
Welcome to the wasteland!
---
My expectations? You gave them some fine Nukashine ;)
---
You weren't kidding. Many of you are hopeless without VATS lol
---
I was at 1/3rd health, no stims. Then stumbled into a 4 man squad. They literally had me surrounded and all within spitting distance. I thought this was it, game over! 
---
I just kept moving, all while systematically killing them off one at a time. It was ridiculous how they couldn't even get one hit to land! 
---
Once the dust finally settled, i stood upon a pile of their corpses.

I don't know. I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't ask our correct him. What are you supposed to say to a stranger?

I’m on EST and I Lead a small but extremely competitive PvP based team.
---
There is something better than them being on the outside with all that hate, and that’s them joining us in arms.  The excess disdain I think is in large part correlated with the excess passion with which we have all enjoyed the worlds Bethesda has created.  It’s why a stranger is unlikely to upset you but your wife can drive you nuts! Lol just a light joke.  Insert “husband” for wife and it’s probably even more true.  But yeah, because you are crazy about your partner.   People are crazy about these games...in a good way.  And when you enjoy something that much every bump in the road, every failure, and every change is perceived through that lens of intensity.  Some of the most avid and awesome players that were part of our gaming community in elder scrolls and previous fallout games are likely out there.  The dust is settling...and I am happy to welcome them in with the hope they enjoy it more than ever.  Like...I meant that with all the sincerity in the world, but I can totally see how it’s likely too lovey/dovey/sentimental for the Internet.  Just...feel what I’m sayin’...because I do mean it.   The only thing better than being right is being understood.  I understand why I’m playing and I would like to think I understand why they are not.  Hopefully they will give it another chance.
---
X-02 is mentioned on a terminal in vault 51 Zax apparently was insistent he be given the suit the terminal is on the bottom floor the room to the left of the laser grid
---
Yes.. Cause its always consoles that cant run the game.. Then bitch about a 4 year old box. It's like listening to someone who cant get good toast yet they refuse to buy a new toaster! 
---
Fucking madness
---
I will do my best to accommodate you and help you learn and compete if you wish.
---
Yeah
---
You can, just invite them to a team while in the main menu.
---
I'm pretty sure this game was supposed to die at launch. It didn't.
---
It didn't die after all the overblown rage over canvas bag, repair kits, etc.
---
It didn't die when it didn't have NPCs.
---
It didn't die when survival came.
---
It didn't die when BR came.
---
All these premonition nonsense from the piss tinted crystal balls have failed again and again and again and again and again...
---
Just. Fucking give up on hating.
---
It sucks when there is basically no communication in games like these.
---
Also I'm just curious where on this map you found a tower lol Personally I fell off the bridge once but no one saw it so my dignity is intact.
---
https://youtu.be/Mtsw9gt-Jew
---
that's so dum , thx man
---
Yeah I had this. I was using a pistol and in PA I could basically see my own arms and little else.
---
I tried it for some hours but I can't do it. People are just killing me and I can barely do any damage. I have no idea why. My GPU is boing too, because it seems to run faster and summer too, and bad hardware. I wonder if I would need to try to aim ahead in regards to ping. But the game doesn't tell me my ping. And it's rather difficult mode to practice. Plus every new game I need to restart the game as my login expires but the client doesn't notice it.(that bug has been for long and depends on some obsure ports or whatever)
---
The mode is really well done in that you can just go and try it. No hardcore muling required to dump all your valuables, which prevents me from going adventure. That is really good, but clearly it's not for me. Getting level 5 requires hours of just surviving and hiding.
---
You’d think NW will have its own SPECIAL based on rank or something.. it’s beta anyway.. they must be ironing things for later
---
Do events and missions. They grant a nice amount of exp and the exp from enemies you encounter is also great.
---
100% agree thats how it should be
---
I think I had a similiar issues years ago. 
---
game crashes, windows notification pops up, GPU driver crashed and cannot be restored. Only certain games caused that. With time it occurred more often and more games. I eventually got the GPU replaced by the manufacturer.
---
Remove the driver completely and clean new installation. 
---
https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solvednvidia-display-driver-stopped-working-and-has-recovered/
---
Maybe you get lucky ^^
---
No I don’t think that.  I agree it deserved criticism.  I am not taking about the criticism that was well-deserved.  For sure there was criticism that was deserved.  I am talking about the criticism which was not deserved.
---
Ok thanks
---
Wastelanders? Adding npcs and all that good stuff. You should have watched the E3 before trying to hate on it.
---
That's pretty good! If I remembered to use stealth boys in combat, maybe I would survive more often haha
---
From what I've gathered they're releasing a beta of it during the free week.
---
its a BA, nothing more, nothing less. its not good its not bad....but nothing special at all. its way worse than any other BR (who knew) tho.....
---
I am a huge fan of it. Levelled playing fields, non OP armours/weapons and generally fair. I just wish there was more info on it. I made one of my mules into a nuclear winter character, as the info states before you start it. I can't use certain rank 3 cards because my special stats are not high enough? There was no mention of this before hand. I am also confused how you get your atom store outfits as you cannot use workbenches in the game? Any ideas?
---
I've watched PUBG and it definetetely is more refined pure shooter. F76 NW is quite Fallout style.
---
I used to hate fallout 76 for its lack of fun content. After playing about 10 games of NW, I can say that I’m having more fun with the game then I have in a long time. 
---
I agree they need to add more content across the board in this game, but I feel like this was a step in the right direction to get new people in the door as well as give veterans a fun mode to play while we wait for new content. 
---
I believe nuclear winter will evolve depending on the response from the players. I don’t know about you but it sure does beat doing the exact same dungeon over and over again to level up.
---
Agree.
---
Total unexpierienced before in pvp as well as br/deathmatch - gave it a shot as survival back then but having a blast every round since it went live. Adventure is my "home soil" but i dont mind a "vacation" in nuclear winter every now and then.
---
They’re very powerful right now. I got about 15 wins tonight before I clocked out, and SB Auto Pistol is just so much more powerful than the rest.
---
Really happy you're enjoying it mate :) See you out there
---
Ok. You didn't mention extra the options. You checked those too?
---
Lmao. The game will succeed with it without them.
---
Their is usually a shovel underneath the workbench inside the shack/shed, next to the post office in Helvetia.
---

---
The radio is available in all modes except Nuclear Winter.
---
I’d go 10k caps, or reduced caps with all your recreational Chem’s. I’m a Raider after all.
---
I played for about 30hrs on day one and didn't encounter any game breakers, there was a broken side quest and some visual glitches but from level 1 to launching a nuke I CTD'd maybe twice. as far as i know there is still a bug in the game where you log in and the bonus from excavator is applied twice until you leave the suit and enter it again.
---
I played with a random guy and my bro has the game but we haven't gotten around to playing together yet, there are still plans I'd like to find, gear to get. I think the game started to taper off a little for me once i'd ran out of exploration it becomes a little bit repetitive with the events and farming mats for ammo and then more events. but I had a decent amount of fun playing through to lvl 90. the game has its moments and i'm excited to see where it goes, i'm certain ill keep logging in and having adventures for as long as the servers are up.
---
What is  SB Auto Laser? I've not seen all weapons there, just only once found handmade.
---
Really happy you are all enjoying it so much! Please keep letting us know any feedback or issues you have :)
---
They're not allowed it seems, I've got the tac ops &amp; it's not an option
---
Happened to me today without ever going into the new game mode. Panic inducing for sure.
---
Yeah, I'm worried about that, too... just going to have to keep "reminding" them, I guess.
---
Since i got called a cringy npc in my last post - i would take the job.
---
Won't be worse than Travis.
---
Vault tec jumpsuit isn’t event clothing
---
Yeah, it ends so abruptly. Hopefully they fix it.
---
This is really valuable feedback everyone. I'll make sure the team sees this. Thank you so much
---
Damn, but thanks
---
You and everyone since release
---
Okay!
---
Thank YOU for the feedback! Sharing this with the Devs now :)
---
i want these anti-vats legendaries the enemies have equipped
---
Thank you. Also more info on how the reward system works would be great.
---
Fantastic. I love when bugs are basically just "features. To fix this "feature" use melee, grenades or a gamma gun. For whatever reason those still deal damage during it. But yeah I'm getting fed up of this bug already.
---
Yawn. Spare us your speculation. I think multiple modes adds variety and that doesn’t hurt. Besides this is by far and away the fairest and cleanest iteration of PvP in the game.
---
Game developement needs money. People clearly like this mode.
---
Don’t worry
---
There are some people (like me) that won’t bother with NW BR. Just not interested at all. I’ll stick with PVE adventure.
---
So if I gave you all my chems (I probably have 50 or more assorted) how low would you go on caps?
---
I had no interest in it either, but after all of the rave reviews here I gave it a try.  Eh.  Not my thing.  As I suspected.
---
More PvE, quests, etc. please.
---
I sat in the river outside the vault tec agricultural place in Flatwoods when the bots were hostile. I just sat there letting them shoot me. My friend revived me, job done. 
---
Was a bit tedious as I have mutations like grounded and healing factor so it took forever to need revived, even though I took all my armour off. But it worked.
---
Just ask “What Do you mean by that?”
---
Wow how could they do such trivial error. Oh well.
---
Great story! Thank you for sharing. Awesome tips too! Gotta practice my sniping game haha
---
This, and also a way to see your overseer progress and stats.
---
I tried PUBG.  I didnt like it, nor did I care for Fortnite.  Im.enjoying NW for now.
---
Yeah, you can also not pick up items if you want.
---
It’s so true.  It’s literally both those things.
---
A hotrod skin? I got a green shark for 10mm
---
Love it so much mate. Thank you for the kind words
---
Shits on pubg tbh. It's a LOT better than I expected
---
Smells like bullshit. I just FOUND these drugs and was looking for places to dispose of them.
---
OK, now that the rage has subsided:
---
- They have blocked the ability to override the startup preload so no more icon sorting tags (or custom fonts etc) maybe for now, maybe until finally we get private servers.
---
- sResourceArchiveMisc has been deprecated.
---
- PLM is broken but the author is working on it.
---
- UI mods like Better Inventory are working.
---
- Strings edits are working.
---
- Mesh/Material/Texture mods are working.
---
- I am sick and tired of NW ralated posts, most of them inane, clogging the whole sub.
---
Taking a break until PLM is back up and running.
---
Stealthboys, the consumable, make you invisible with no downsides (it’s as broken as it sounds) for a whole 30 seconds
---
Auto Laser pistol has a splitter and a 30 round mag. It appears to have much more dps than any other auto gun (and rifle) at the cost of range.
---
Combine the two and your running around with the greatest method to close distance and the greatest weapon to clean up shop.
---
The sad thing is, this was pretty much the meta (except the Tesla cheese) before. Nothing’s changed really.
---
Tried it, was a bit fun. Got bored after an hour or so and went back to my normal game.
---
I'm sure ill have another go again sometime...
---
Damn. I wish I'd read this 10 minutes earlier. Bought a skin then realized it wouldnt show under armor so I spent even more money to get tac ops only to find out it doesn't show.
---
I too became distracted with the new mode it's a real blast and I love it despite my initial skepticism when I saw the trailer during E3. I hope they get on this and fix it soon, it's not a game breaker for me more of a quality of life card so I want my easy living back!
---
Best way to earn exp is to buddie up with a high level. All u need is 1 shot on a high level enemie and u get the exp when it dies, but playing solo look for super mutant camps or farm the airport for exp and weopon mods or what old mate said, go do events and missions.
---
Played a few rounds of it, not bad. Biggest issue is the teams. Its no fun wanting to play solo, and having to face off 1v4 against people. There should be separate ques
---
also been having audio probs for about a week , left side drop out, or background volume issues..Last night one step forword, mute ...one step back, full vol.
---
It’s all balanced
---
It just felt sorta empty. It would have been way better as a single player story rather than the online empty map it is. If Bethesda decided to resell the game as a single player rpg I imagine it would sell extremely well. Or if they decided to give it bigger caps on servers and have rust like servers where I can pick where I build. Rather than bounce from server to server wondering if my shit will spawn with me.
---
Thank you for the suggestion mate! I can float this one with the team :)
---
Also text chat would be cool.
---
No one needs to say sorry. It’s a good game now. But no one needs to say sorry to Bethesda. Their mistakes
---
Thx! Sended my application.

He's not talking about PvE. He's talking specifically about BR
---
Bro chill, this isn’t Fortnite
---
ah yes my 1050ti 12gb ram, i5 4th gen, is the problem LOL, i can run alot of the most popular games on medium or high at 60 fps solid lol, it is the game, not me
---
Have you tried checking if turning down your graphics settings fixes it?
---
Yeah, I imagine the new player I saw yesterday (handjobjim6969) probably feels this way too.
---
Well, I agree with this point as well. I'd like to see an opportunity to freely redistribute special points however you want before the battle only within the NW mode without any changes applied to other game modes. I think they'll implement this scheme sooner or later.
---
I think you have to be wearing a swimming costume.
---
lol! lol! lol! lol!  
---
many ppl gave up coz bethesda doesnt give a crap what the community wants...this stupid BR is the best example for it. ppl just like it because its FO themed, but bascially its worse than any other BR out there. classic fanboys with low expectations....this mod will die out after 16th of june faster than the dinosaurs after the meteor hit.  
---
fo76 pve is doomed and thats why the pve players will move to other games. bethesda rather sucks the br-kiddies d\*\*ks hard than giving the actual community that stayed even after this catastrophic launch what they want: pve content. the heart and soul of every FO, for gods sake. take a look at ESO, this game was such a pile of crap when it launched, the abo system, stuff like that. they listenend and made the game better. today TESO is stunningly beautiful and created with so much love. then fo76 came out - same situation, just a different setting. what did they do? after so many weeks of making the game better and listening to the community, they just gave up midway. 
---
but hey...thats it for me at least. i dont want to wait another infinite number of weeks for the next pve content thats just a freakin safari like the pioneer scouts.
---
Thx! You're welcome.
---
It happened on my 1st match. I was not amused &gt;=[
---
Your welcome!

---
I just like jamming it up in the lobby on the stage with everyone playing instruments!
---
Yeah, I remember hearing this back then but I’m honestly fine with the mode. It gives me more things to do and earn.
---
Assuming you’re on PC, press the corresponding number key on the top row of your keyboard to use it quickly
---
You get a little better armor, you get a lot easier to hit.
---
I got a Tri Barell Missle Launcher
---
Yeah thank you Todd Howard for giving us the game we should've got last year.. Yeah no. They don't deserve praise for making the game into an actual game a year after it's come out.
---
I just want to know if our progress in the Sneak Peek will be reset, or if we get to keep it as in the BETA. It's fun but I don't want to rank up two characters and then find out I have to rank them up \*again\* when Nuclear Winter releases fully.
---
what do you mean it’s a cheap tactic to use my explosive laser and camp outside vault 76 in survival
---
bang on (pun intended).
---
vats is auto aim. if you cant aim your weapon..........
---
looks like all the super duper vats critical builds,just fell on their arses.
---
There's always going to be someone who's not interested in certain aspects. I suck at BR so I don't know if I'll personally play it, but... It doesn't affect me in anyway whatsoever when it comes to playing the adventure or survival mode. Not everyone will be pleased but I've seen a lot of people enjoying it which is awesome. Some people want NPC's and some people don't, it's impossible that everyone will be happy. But I don't see the point in hating on something just because I don't enjoy it. The world is already full of so much bitterness and hate. Glad you and many others are having fun playing this new mode. :)
---
Just please fix the sound. People sound like they are shooting 10 miles away when they are only 10 feet away
---
edgy
---
Shut it bot theres a reason people dont like you
---
I cant enjoy it becouse there are players better then me.
---
Might as well be now that BR is out. The damage is already done, they should go all the way now lol
---
Explosive laser? I thought they got rid of that?
---
I can see why people want that, and I do too somewhat. My only problem with the idea is that scammers and other shitheels could easily have multiple personas to hide behind.
---
*gangly legged eldritch horror and weapon holstering*

can speak only for myself but i dont like it if other players take everything. Take some is ok for me but take all isnt nice. Thats why i lock some of my water purifiers...
---
Well everyother player should bow. Its you dude.. You got the car.. You just cant drive if you know what im saying
---
Not even 12 hours and the community is already trying to reshape the game mode. Try to play within what you’re offered for a bit.
---
You can play slots. You can also get eyes checked, flush toilet, get coffee, sleep and instruments. Still looking for more, but can def play slots
---
Nothing wrong with roleplaying a mentat addicted prostitute.
---
Thank you so much. This is gonna make this game so much more fun. Also do you know how much health each player has? Its really hard to know when to push when I can't tell if my enemies are weak or not.
---
Oh so it does take from the owner. I’ll stop than.
---
So the water from the purifier stays in the purifier till it’s picked up? So by lock you lock a door or?
---
I don't like battle royale games, never played any of them I'm level 205 on fallout 76. I really like this battle royale they added you have a actual you level up and progress to work on its not buggy load in fast not vats in The game mode very balance. I say you can't say anything till you play the game mode. I say 👍👍👍 to this game mode
---
Shhhh
---
This ain't the same game from when it launched mate. No one is gonna say sorry.
---
To *also* be fair, the canvas bags and the Nuka Dark had nothing to do with the actual *game* or the *developers*. It's not like Jeff Gardiner personally signed off on those things.
---
why did you play Fortnite for months while having no fun doing so? walk me through the psychology here.
---
Okay? Good to know I suppose.
---
It makes sense to have it character ranked. You’re character is one person, makes no sense to have a new character to be Able to get in
---
Thank you for the info, I was really hoping it wasn't a full set of actual power armor if I wanted it cause then that means I'd have to play more NW which my anxiety doesn't really make for a fun time.
---
Bro there is a lot of other games with BR tho?
---
Where do you get it then? I literally have only seen 2 in 900 hours of gameplay and earned the one I have from doing First things First.
---
Even more so, I could see fo76 private servers gaining traction as competition for GTARP. They just need to add more animations and emotes for people to do.
---
Yeah?
---
Do you have a friend you'd trust with your account info? I haven't had Live in years but my buddies account is "homed" on my console and mine on his. I occasionally just buy a game he wants lol.
---
Name checks out😂😂
---
My targets were standing in a small cluster practically waiting for a firing squad (west tek main entrance) so there was no issue there, I wasnt using the vats system any differently this time to my previous play session either in which I didn't experience this issue, so that couldn't have been the issue here, also with the new damage number shown per shot it was easy to see that on re engaging the vats was producing the same damage per shot, again this was all on targets at a similar range within a small cluster. With this card maxed out and before the damage counter was accessible you could easily see a marked difference between killing the first enemy and then killing the next one. In the meantime I've switched out to enforcer and started using my shotgun again, it's not a game breaking factor for me but ya know when you get used to something, you just dont like it to be taken away!
---
No alert
---
Didn't apex legends do the respawn thing first??
---
Actually Fortnite has copied this feature from Apex Legends. but whatever :D IMO that's a must have feature
---
said no one ever
---
Haha hell yeah! My best win was the poor las guy and i gatling gun'd him from above while he ran around trying to not get shredded. I was on a cliff 😂
---
Go for it then mate
---
Other brs have a very casual friendly terrain, no need to think about positioning past high/low.
---
Right! Thanks for reminding me, Fortnite did copy Apex with this, sorry for the ignorance.
---
shut up
---
Yeh definitely nice to have something else to do. As for other players it's too be expected. Ppl will be back! I do like that I had whitesprings to myself 5 times though 😂
---
Well I got 295 with life giver perk equipped so 250 without it
---
They are icons and STASH skins. Not real loot boxes.
---
I am also partial to "borrowing corn" I see no problem with it
---
How embarrassing.
---
**P R O T E C T A N D S E R V E**

*with the recent tweaks which make it much better.
---
Thanks for the helpful suggestions, though it didn't work for me.  After turning the music slider all the way down on the start menu, I entered a world to find the audio still cut.  Thanks anyways, and I wish you a nice day.  Cheers!
---
What the hell is your problem with the mode? 😂😂😂 I’d rather have it than not???
---
So every time you level up you get the... same vault 51 stash skin. Over and over again?
---
Peopke are liking it, so who really cares - things change
---
Two to the head?
---
Our group is sitting at 2 wins in a row right now and this is probably the most fun I've had in a battle royale!
---
Im totally not into BR. I think its kind of annoying that they are forcing people to play it just to get stuff for adventure mode. For me BR is very far removed from a traditional fallout game. Regardless of what they offer I think I'll pass.
---
Get over it. Let people enjoy things. If you don’t like it don’t play it.
---
Oh okay yeah that makes sense. I was in a 1v1 and I hit the other guy for over 200 before he killed me and I was so confused as to why he wasn't dead.
---
Sorry to hear it however it is good to know that it's not an isolated incident on my part due to servers or anything client side, if anything I believe/assume that it's just been an oversight on Bethesdas part.
---
Welp, good to know. Just turned on the damage counter myself, might conduct the same test.
---
Meh, I’ll probably swap in something else until they address it.
---
Maybe they added br to keep the current players playing until new dlc comes out.
---
Sell them on ePray :)
---
Did anyone use the Atomic Radio mod in Fo4? That style would work well for 76.
---
Nope, a different. Like small, medium, large skins.
---
Also, there are display icons, they are separete rewards from the skins.
---
 add each other to be on a team in the main menu. Then everyone selects Battle Royale.
---
If you're in a nuke zone, you're likely taking in a lot of radiation..which can kill you.
---
It sure as hell had a rocky launch, but damn al the stuff they added and gonna add is making this game worth my bucks!
---
I have to ask, were you just playing the BR mode on fallout?
---
I believe the plants are instanced to each player, much like the rest of the flora in this game-- my garden never has any plants pulled and it's been in my camp with a hundred visitors. So you're not stealing from anybody in that case. And most of us leave our purifiers unlocked so that folks can take some water, so again, don't be afraid to help yourself.
---
I can see why no one pays you to do this stuff.
---
not really, i hate it
---
Got it already: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byzmcm/upcoming\_atom\_shop\_items\_nuclear\_winter\_datamines/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/byzmcm/upcoming_atom_shop_items_nuclear_winter_datamines/)
---
Yes I was
---
Good luck contending with all the hackers, just like every other game on PC.
---
Idk after reading this i just had the thought where itd be 4 vertibirds at N, E, S, and W points going towards the center so that if you dont jump off in time you blow up with the vertibirds crashing into each other
---
I can’t wait to have my own purifier but I am only level 10 haha
---
that's nice
---
I've seen some gameplay vids (Oxhorn) and am really looking forward to jumping in. And I don't even like PVP.
---
I hate Battle Royales of any kind, but Nuclear Winter's BR was actually really good, and it shocked me. But multiple game modes are a good thing as it gives us more to do then hunting scorched and running around the breadth of the world for our camps. They've added a lot already across the board and wastelanders looks to shake up the game even more in a positive way.
---
I have a few diferent corps, I use raw melons for hunger/thirst, others are for alcohol brewing.
---
I have no problem if you take everything. I have an open copper harvester, take some ore if you need it.
---
Same for water.
---
I'm not a fan of Battle Royals either but you really should try this one out, way more fun that I expected.
---
Where were you 6 months ago?
---
 Not slogging away with the rest of us ( who were giving BGS a lot of constructive advice ).
---
What's your perk build?
---
Players will get the abillity to break into the radio station and talk in the show for everyone to hear for 20 seconds
---
Nice, so far I live off of carrot soup but I may upgrade to corn soup soon. Living the classy life
---
PA is shielded, which is what I was wearing.
---
How do I interact with one?
---
I was looking forward to playing with the damage counter after stacking up 6 kills with adrenaline and gun fu on top to see what my highest damage number would be per shot, i agree though that in the meantime I have various other options for perks so nows a good a time as any to play around with different builds agility wise!
---
Unfortunately some people will never be happy, I just wish they'd do it somewhere else
---
Lmao. That would be chaos. It would just the N word 10% of the time
---
Wasn't that youtuber Bellular? He's usually quite objective (to the point of having arguments in defense of EA or Epic), but Bethesda seems to be that guy's sore spot. He loses most of his objectivity when speaking about Bethesda and loves to custruct "what if Bethesda does X" scenarios to further demonise them. He especially loves to repeat his "they nerfed armor durability and then 4 months later introduced repair kit" strawman...
---
You can find a plan to make them
---
The razorgrain soup gives more hp back and some hp regen also.
---
With the quad crossbows in the base game you press x four times to load four arrows before you fire. So I'd reckon x would do it. Press 3 times.
---
You can still only fire one at a time but it's 3 shots before reloading.
---
My one s is like that on all modes. Went to pc and don't have the same problems.
---
They didn't just suddenly toss this together. I'm willing to bet this has been in the works way before  fo76 was initially released. 
---
You ever think this "lie" was to throw people off their sent, maybe allow for a bigger surprise when it's actually released. 
---
It's pretty common practice to spread misinformation. It's done for tv series and movies all the time. You don't want someone dropping a major spoiler before they are even done filming.
---
Relax.... At this point you're just looking for reasons to hate. Does it even really matter what he said ages ago? Are you telling me you never change your mind about anything? This is life, things change. While you're there being a sad angry person, rest of us are having a blast enjoying the hell out of this game!
---
I'm sure it wasn't as bad as many of you did
---
Sneak VATS Crit, but i was trying it without crits for consistency
---
I think it was still getting the 2.5 sneak bonus each time....i will have to check a little more thoroughly tonight but wondered if anyone else saw the same thing?
---
I’ll have to check into that! I just planted my first razor grain today. I am going to move my camp soon to flatter ground right now I’m between a cliff and a house- i thought I had to hide my base
---
Need a fix asap! I was worried about it, when I heard about VATS closing right after a kill already... Now its actually broken and the card is useless.
---
This ^^^^^
---
I really doubt you're that compelling
---
A lot of good points here, especially regarding fake reports, as my impression is that if a well written report gets to the top of e.g. this subreddit, it will get picked up by vloggers who pretend they're news outlets, and suddenly there are "news reports" on banned lvl. 900 accounts, deleted characters, 1001 bugs compilations infesting the YouTube front page.
---
And even if you don't have a headset just try to stick together. Most teams are split up  most of the time so your team of 4 can easily pick them off 1 by 1 as you run into them.
---
I am a gatling laser user. one lap around white springs will yeild 3 almost full cores in roughly 24 minutes.unless you're able to loot before and after. haven't done that didn't even know it was a thing. at any rate I would still prefer taking power plants. you get three fully charged cores every 24 minutes. if you take one you can hold a steady inventory while doing events and scavenging and slowly gain extra cores if you go back every 24 minute block and when you defend. if you get two power plants you can go full on scorchbeast hunting jumping from fissure to fissure killing them all their minions and still steadily gain inventory but it gets tricker to get back to harvest the cores and defend the workshops. with three power plants. its 9 every 24 minutes. you wont have time to do anything but low level junk searches and short quick room clears. IE go to west tek clear front area loot scrap stock vending machine real fast,  then it will be time to harvest cores or you'll get an alarm for defending one of them. it gets a bit hectic with three  I tend to run the loop then get rested and music bonus while I wait for the egg timer to tick down. I have just found its to much hassle to commit to anything with three shops. I do have issues with gatling laser though. 
---
1. you're in a catch 22. to get cores you have to take shops and gatling laser doesn't armor ignore and stagger rarely procs and generally its a crappy weapon for any defensive type pvp. essentially, sucky pvp gun but you have to make yourself vulnerable to getting ganked to secure its best source of amo.
---
2. I get jeolous when I see scorchbeasts get dropped a good 30 percent faster with other heavy guns, I get downright annoyed when meleers drop them in only a few hits. 
---
3. it spits out partially empty cores. ammos says 999 i have all max level cores in my inventory it reloads a few times next time I check theres multiple mostly empty fusion cores, 30% 40 % etc. wtf gun why??
---
I feel like Vampiric gatling laser makes up for those things by just offering the laziest easiest form of fighting in the game. I rarely use stims I only carry a few super stims with me. and I can facetank the queen and the entire bog while sipping coffee. some would probably consider it boring its that easy. its click hold dead click hold dead over and over. no weapon swaps no stealth needed . heck you can even do it drunk cause I was plowed the other night and did fine in a queen fight. durability is good enough I can kill all the scorched beast at the fissures twice before repairing but that's with max weapon artisan and max gunsmith. overall i like it but I am very lazy and not focused on minmaxing damage or being the best. I guess I do have my character optimized for laziness. just not damage :P
---
Np have fun
---
Is there any rewards for winning a game ? I’ve won one and I’m just curious I didn’t get anything haha
---
I didn’t know the update launched since I haven’t played 76 for a few months, did they really add a battle royale mode?
---
So you want to be able to see the previous matches stats? Or do you want a overall stats page?
---
It's many hours later, I've restarted and started multiple times, it's still like that.
---
The survival aspect for me. It feels less like a battle royale because players are only one of the many dangers. Feels like what I imagine the hunger games books would be like.
---
I don’t see it as a negative tho, because their BR is different.... bruh instead of player against players only, you got to worry about Wasteland creatures and Nukes! It’s BR in their hands, why would it be disappointing?
---
Should be good im at stable 144
---
40 scrip
---
I've seen a lot of complaints about the DBNO system.
---
All I'll say is that this is Bethesda, they've got a monkey paw.
---
We wanted Refrigeration, we got it locked to backpacks, behind a quest, and theres already a perk that does the same thing and doesn't stack.
---
Don't like the DBNO? Don't be suprised if they remove it just to have us die instantly, since it's quicker to the next match.
---
It's popular to hate Bethesda for any possible reason they can find, most haters ain't even Fallout fans, have never played and only joiden the train because reasons. Similar to hating EA but that trend is apparently old now...
---
Oh my God. I just realized. My teammates all died last game but I killed the event and it was me vs a team of 2 and while I was looting my teammates bodies I picked up a briefcase, but my dumbass thought it was just codes and I ended up losing. Fuck my life
---
I think it's awesome me
---
Nothing you can do. The recommended system spec is not enough for a stable 60fps on low in 1080p.
---
You are right, it shouldn't be a thing. There should be no "knocked". You should just die and there should be no revivem
---
I played 4-5 matches yesterday and i reached level 4, and in my second match i reached second one alive until i stick out my head and died hehe. In general i dont like pvp, BUT the Nuclear Winter was so fun! Is short (20 minutes), everyone is equal, is fun trying to move stealthy, find equipment and stay alive from the other players and the fire. I don't even minded if some other player killed me. And the map felt new! I will play more this week. The only thing is that i dont have much time to explore the Vault 51, before the fight begins. I hope in the future we will have more time.
---
Add a queue system and change the map  every now and again. Other than that, it’s a solid game mode to play when you’re not on adventure or PVP
---
That or launch nukes non stop taking turns launching. Each player can launch 1 every hour at each silo.
---
that sounds way less fun than just playing it yourself
---
PA doesn't prevent it 100%, you still get rads.
---
NO !! ITS REAL, THE WASTELAND IS REAL! I AM DEFINITELY DISAGREEING WITH YOU. shhh wtf dude overseer is every damn where! that's the kind of talk that gets you landed in a big old jar of green goo and turned into a super mutant. my friends all said I was nuts but I have seen it theres tubs of green goo with super muties innit. NICE SEEING YOU ZIPPY WATCH THOSE CRAZY IDEAS OF YOURS NOW BYE.
---
Because this is the opposite of what people asked for. It’s kinda fun, I admit that.
---
But this is what everyone said don’t do, and they did it anyways. It’s not about how good the BR mode is. People are angry about these new updates because it’s against the wishes of the fallout community.
---
And when they do listen, they do such a bad job. Like the NPC dialogue. More or less every speech option was either Yes, No, Yes + Caps, No - caps.
---
They continue to stay the same.
---
I guess I’m bothered they haven’t increased their quality of games up to the standards of FNV, which came out 9 years ago
---
I think its just extra overseer xp and caps.
---
To be fair, I’d much rather have that. 
---
People are so fucking thirsty for a quick kill they focus downed people before focusing the actual team.
---
In probably 95% of my matches, my team or I would be suppressing the enemies and they would still just go for the downed player to just die.
---
most players are happy for you to take some of the crops and water as they quickly respawn, you can place locks on water purifers so you would need to lockpick it to get the water (lockpicking in somebody else's camp will make you wanted), i have plenty of crops and purifers in my camp set up for other players to help themselves and then a couple of locked water purifers for my own use, from my experience those players that don't want you taking their crops will build walls around them so you can't take them and lock all of their water purifers
---
Ah ok, so if it’s open it’s prob safe to take then eh?
---
I'm so glad I'm at the point in my life where $20 isn't the deciding factor on whether I try something to see if I actually enjoy it...
---
I want a pet hermit crab so bad I would pay bethesda 20 bucks just to have one follow me around.
---
An in game name and under it the account name with half smaller font could be nice
---
This happens and has been happening since forever. Just go scrip 1 item and it’ll reload properly. Or go visit a possum machine and see how many badges you have. That screen that shows badges and scrip is pretty new and bugs out just like vendors used to show 0 caps available to sell but you can sell to it anyway as long as the amount of time to reset has passed.
---
There's already tons of ways to find players through discord and reddit. None the less gl on it!
---
Do SPECIAL stats matter in NW? I think it just lets you have 7 generic slots for cards. At least that’s what it looked like to me. I was in a bit of a rush setting it up in the vault.
---
if only the critical hits and perks weren’t so weren‘t so reliant ln VATS ..
---
Sometimes you keep playing games that aren’t fun. I spent overtime on FO4 and Skyrim, even when the game wasn’t fun anymore.
---
Videogame addiction bruh 😂
---
in the top left of the forest region is a logging camp full of super mutants, it's a good palce for xp and weapons you can sell to vendors
---
I have faith it will be fixed, like the strange in numbers card for example, they took there time but it got done and now that card works fine (no more having to pop it out and back in whilst praying it works), but you are 100% right it does make it a void perk at the moment, I know that stealth sniper builds that have built around this perk will see a huge drop off in there damage numbers because of it, the automatic builds I cannot see it affecting on a huge scale, unless you have a tank of a mob to kill.
---
The gun play seems to be improved after this update as well? Even in adventure? 😋
---
You haven't even played the main game, nevermimd NW, so the only leg you have to stand on is the one in the middle of your forehead (no matter how small and limp, kinda like you're post).
---
Thanks man. I’ve never been a fan of discord, and teamspeak and the like - If it’s overkill and easy to find, maybe this subreddit can be added to the many tools for people. Never can have too many options :)
---
I’m with you man, 100%. I don’t want this BR mode but they are still trying to tend to everyone’s needs... did you forget they are coming out with the Wastelanders DLC? They’re trying their best to make this Fallout Online a better game.
---
Yes, quest definitely NOT working. Go to meet Scout Leader Tready and once spoken to him it disappears, no quest given.
---
Same. I think I spawned in a moment before a teammate who spawned directly in front of me but I was frozen u til he came in. Never had an issue with being attacked before I could move. I’ve only played a few games tho.
---
Thanks! Sniping is just so dominant because most of the other weapons can't hit a thing at any range outside of "very short" (with the exception of the .50 cal). And yes, individually you may miss half your shots, but if your whole TEAM misses half, and you are all shooting at one guy, he's still down in seconds. You can pin down and hold a whole enemy team at bay from the cover of a few bushes and trees if they don't snipe back in a coordinated manner. Our formula that worked almost every time:
---
Start at, and hug the map edge as long as you can. It keeps you from getting attacked from behind, and lets everyone else kill each-other off and waste ammo/health while your team gears up and distributes weapons, armor, and stims for maximum team benefit. Keep your team alive, they will keep you alive.
---
Everyone needs a sniper rifle, and a powerful close-range secondary (I prefer the grenade launcher) in case you get rushed.
---
Call enemy positions using the compass (North, south, east, northwest, etc.) and large landmarks. Like "South, across the road". It's short, and easily gets everyone looking the right direction and location for an enemy quickly. And hopefuly helping you shoot them to death.
---
NEVER leave the group. For obvious reasons. Never MEANS never. No cowboy shit. Always be thinking "Can my team revive me if I get downed here?" and always hug hard cover, so if you get dropped, your team can use the cover to revive you without getting killed trying to do it.
---
That's it. Sounds simple, but we had to practice doing it for an hour before we started to climb into the top ranks and then on to dominance.
---
Fair enough, I'm sure many will prioritize yours. Just need to spread the word.
---
Np.
---
Yeah I'm going to have to switch up my build a bit for sure, maybe take concentrated fire off. Will definitely swap to commando over rifleman.
---
You can server hop and look for events that have people in it, join and tag every monster.
---
Or if you are looking for area where to level up/or do some quests, i would say at that level you should go to morgantown airport, if you didn't already done everything in that area. Then maybe go north to toxic valley, but remember there will be higher level = you will have problems with ammo and aid.
---
Same. I play on a regular PS4. Hardly any technical issues.
---
I know. I applaud them. They SHOULD be doing this though. We paid, they didn’t deliver a proper game of their usual standard, until now.
---
I just wish they listened to us a bit more. There seems to be a heavy disconnect. They even released some mobile EOS games or something? Trash lol
---
Guessing imma get shit on for this but I tried it and super didn't like it, this might be because fallout for me has been exploring the beautiful environment and this new way of looking at things just doesn't feel right.
---
I kept watching a game I died in and that how it ended. A nuclear draw. Good for you!
---
Fallout is now a a looter shooter, not a rpg, not the old concept of a fallout game. 
---
The small bethesda niche love this type of mindless fun, we will never get a fallout like before 4 again.
---
Really, I wasn't expecting to like Nuclear Winter as much as I do. It's really great!
---
You should also really thing of improving the gun fu perk also in terms of speed. It's so slow on the next enemy it should be instantly swap to the next enemy now instead of soooloooooowwwww.
---
Also the distance could be more wide. I'm faster in retargeting myself than with this perk!
---
I was disappointed in it not being account based. I wanted to level up my alt so I started on him and after many games I found out nothing I unlocked was on main character and I had to start at 0 again. :(
---
I don’t know how I feel about this. There could be BR only players that come along and Bethesda is basically forcing them to play adventure mode to maximize their BR abilities. And moving around perk points require them to keep playing adventure to adjust perk points to play BR the way they want....
---
They need to untie that. And maybe load a prelobby screen for managing special stats and perk cards before finding a server.
---
Bethesda: Add anything from older fallout game to fallout76.
---
Fallout fans: THIS IS LORE BREAKING.
---
Ok so who is loremaster, developers or some random nerds? (no offence)
---
You can get the blue pill at any pharmacy  to last more than 47 secs in your sex life. Theres no such 5hin at the Atom Shop.. yet.
---
Apology?
---
A single man tear runs down my cheek.
---
First time I built my Camp under the Junkyard, near the riverside, where is a datacollector locates, with some reed nearby.
---
It is nice, flat, and water is at the doorstep, with pleanty of woods too for boil and cook.
---
Now I moved my camp to a cliff. Nice view :)
---
I found someone who got me the codes. Alpha worked! I'm surprised I didn't have to insert another key card to launch though. It just let me go ahead and punch the code in
---
I have played couple dozen games and only once me and my team got both nuke and codes and of course none of us remembered until we managed to win and the only guy who died asked, "where's the nuke? Shouldn't the game end in nuke?". It was painful realization of lost opportunity
---
Didn't read that he hasn't even played it - either play it then comment or just shut up
---
So it sends you to a random place EVERY time? I had no idea. I only ever drank it once. Great prank.
---
I’ll check that out, I’m near the  church in flatwoods across the street against the cliff ahha
---
I just started playing a couple weeks ago. The first game I ever truly fell in love with was fallout 3, back in what, 2009? really don't remember.
---
NV was great, FO4 was also very cool to me, but I lost interest faster. really can't pinpoint why.
---
I stayed away from 76 initially, not necessarily because I was worried about the negativity, but more because when I did inevitably play it, I wanted it to be stable.  I am so glad that I decided to give it a shot. I'm also kind of mad at myself for not starting earlier, I feel like I've missed out on this beautiful transformation I always read about.
---
ultimately I am having a blast, and I'm so glad that it seems to just be getting better. thank you guys for sticking with it so they had the drive to keep investing so much. I am so looking forward to playing this game for the next few years
---
I hope to goes more towards an RPG. That will be easier with NPCs and choices based on morality (or lack there of), rather than the main focus being...shoot. Kill. Loot. Repeat.
---
Being excited is good, I am to, but posts like this should really wait until the new expansion gets released.
---
All they showed was a trailer, same as last years E3 and we know how that turned out.
---
Adventure mode is a good mix of the two. It’s what kept me here through all the bugs this game had/has.
---
Its a nice fusion atm.
---
It's a cosmetic crate for your camp. Not actually a crate you can open with loot inside of it. There's not that kind of stuff in FO76
---
Honestly I would prefer an easy ping system than having VATS on wildlife. I don’t think the wildlife is that strong (A scorch East even showed up at one point and I didn’t even bother to fight it, then my teammate hosed it down with a quick burst from his .50 and killed it in moments.) so having VATS is a bit redundant for taking down the walking lootcrates.
---
My problems are more with the style of content (and bugs, always bugs), rather than anything major.
---
Mainly stuff seems to be poorly implemented, either being functionally identical to an already superior item (Fridge Backpack Vs Good With Salt), or being (stylistically) recycled content/ideas (Wastelanders vs Nuka-World).
---
I do love the game, but Beth needs some new blood in it's ideas department.
---
Awesome thanks! Send love to team from me aswell!
---
yes if they left it unlocked then it usually means they left it unlocked for others to take the water, i have 5 small purifers set up in my camp for anyone to take water from, just take what you need
---
It was the first time all 4 of us had mics, we made it to the end, just the 4 of us and 1 enemy... then he nuked the circle while walking around in the storm.  So close.
---
True or a pinging system.
---
Just wait until it fully releases and people make it their part time job like the other BR
---
Are the atom shop clothings upgradable ? Would suck badly if the battlecoat has no upgrades available
---
Yes he did say that but it the article you linked, it also says 
---
"However, just because Fallout 76 and none of Bethesda’s current titles don’t have battle royale, that doesn’t mean the company isn’t open to pursuing it in the future. Hines said that if someone at Bethesda were able to come up with a battle royale game that was “unique or different or cool,” that the company may consider moving forward with the idea."
---
That article was from a year ago, and most likely the studio developing Fo76 were more focused on Adventure mode and launch before any survival and BR mode.
---
Well, if you put it like that I feel bad for my comment haha. It was fueled more by my frustration for what looked to me like a joke/blatant lie at E3. Because it didn't line up with what I think is the real state of the game atm. Which even though I spent quite an amount of time in the game is still just my opinion and maybe not a fact.
---
I hope you still enjoy the game. A game you can enjoy is hard to come by sometimes.
---
I wonder this too. I have a 3 star antiarmor. Has the limb dmg and dmg resistance while reloading but it's primed :(
---
Tbh I ain’t mad at your opinion. All I want it a Remastered Fallout 3 and NV but I like that they are updating 76 instead of leaving it the way they did at release. Shit, it was trash but they fixed it... yeah they brought more issues cause of this update but seeing what they did in the past, they’ll fix it soon. IMO
---
A super mutant radio station. The host talks about the most random stuff, has issues starting music, "stupid machine! Play mu-*music starts*" "Humans moving to big circle, making things. Don't they know plenty of places to take over? Stupid huma-*music starts*"
---
They actually do. There are cards that cost more than 1 point and you need higher stats to put them on.
---
Do you guys think it would it be beneficial for fallout 76 to make nuclear winter mode free to play? I was thinking that it maybe would be a nice gateway to want to play the full game.
---
i haven't done OT since i got the bacpack, so i was really confused. I thought you meant "Operation Tiddy" as, like, a codename for your BR team
---
You got downvoted Because you criticized the game. I will now be downvoted as well lol.
---
But ye, it’s still in BETA, gotta wait for the next patch I guess.
---
Not if my Diving Legion can help it! Or the terrifying Samurai Firemen of Sutton!
---
True wastelander!
---
I get tired about people complaining about the 'AAA price' of FO76 when you consider the amount of content delivered (and I should point out that I've experienced virtually no technical issues, unlike some others). When I calculate how much time I've spent playing FO76 and the amount of time I'll be playing it into the future, the game works out to be a huge bargain.
---
Many people have found things to do. I'm sure you can too. I believe in you.
---
serums negate the negatives for an hour, which makes class freak even less useful
---
So there are different rarities of crates? It seems odd because there’s a crate every other level. 
---
I don’t see why you’d want crates laying all around your camp.
---
They should add FO3 combat armor in the atom shop. I'd buy it!
---
I thought fallout was an RPG already...
---
No problems here.
---
I think you hit the nail on the head. Its using the familiar game mechanics but applying it differently.
---
Therer are 3 or 4 different crates. The ones you can see in the NW lobby. Small, medium and big. Doubt there're more.
---
Not much until fall, with npcs.
---
You can farm for your dream weapons and armors.
---
You can do possum badges for backpack mods.
---
You can do sheepsquatch quest if you missed it.
---
You can try to find plans and decorate your camp.
---
So, casual things.
---
Just leave?
---
Get the new backpack, do the new events, get Legendary script. There’s so much do to
---
I agree. CTF is awesome!
---
Also a lot less jumping up and down like in FN...
---
I can understand. I played fortnite for a while. And I never really enjoyed it. But I felt like I must have been missing something for all of my friends to be hooked on it. So I kept trying it but it never came to me
---
so can you get it outside of nuclear winter?
---
I like having knocked players it adds suspense to these types of game. Do I play the hero save my friend or watch where the fire is coming from.  Or do I knock a player and watch if he goes to his team or he acts as spotter
---
Ah right, thanks!
---
Ey now leave me at least half of them!
---
Ah that's pretty annoying
---
I can confirm that it's possible to cheat. I study programming alongside physics and with the little i know i already found way to use external programs in game, so what can those do who actually know about games. (FYI game doesn't start if you have mods but changing ini file fixes that...)
---
I am way past bed time, still playing...trying to decide if I just play all night and screw sleep...
---
I understand that,  but I was in PA walking next to Drop Site V9, no enemies, full health low rads, and my health went to zero.
---
Yeah. But i mean we cant give them too much credit. They needed to fix this game. If they didn’t, their name would be ran into the ground. This is them redeeming themselves, and in a way, they did it already.
---
So because they didn’t ditch us with their bug infested game earlier, many will buy their next game :)
---
And god, an fo3/fnv remake? Id spend my last dime on that
---
No? I bought this game being told it's a fun borderlands / fortnite series
---
Blue? It needs some golden lines from the sides...
---
A guy sent me a video of him getting the plan from breach and clear. I can share it on xbox if interested. GT: PrimeBigTime
---
I did the event a dozen times and haven't gotten it yet though
---
From the social menu. Find you friend in friends list, select invite to team....
---
Jokes on you I don’t have nightmares! I get daymares because spiders are horrid hairy things!
---
It's honestly just incredible the level of projection people can go through. Yes, the 'haters' are the one grasping at straws.. definitely. Meanwhile I'll be over here, playing games that had a main quest line and NPC's and Multiplayer when they were released, not about a year later.
---
Absolutely hilarious.
---
This game was not in a playable state at launch, everyone who criticized it was justified to do so.
---
Bethesda has just added another year of development which would have made any other game better, which is what should have happened in the first place imo.
---
I am happy that Besthesda has continued to support the game and make it the game it should have been at launch, I am on the other hand still skeptical and will wait until after the new expansion has been released to try out the game again. All we have seen is a trailer which is what was released at last years E3... and we know how that went.
---
&gt; most devisive and openly bashed game in history 
---
Have you tried Anthem?
---
It was still a thing before NW, just a visual bug so no need to worry.
---
Don’t get the down votes. If people here ordered a pizza and the bread base came and the pizzeria said, ‘Oh. We’ll add the rest of it further down the line.’ then I gather they’d be cool with that.
---
Trading works in two ways: directly with a player (holding the triangle button on PS4, I don't know on Xbox/PC). You can offer an item for caps, and the other player can buy it, reject it, or offer an item of their own.
---
And then there's player vending, which are machines that players put at their CAMPS, and fill them with items to sell for caps, that you can go and buy without having to interact with the players themselves.
---
There are several types of workbenches - tinkerer, chem station, cooking station, armor workbench, Power Armor workbench, and weapons workbench.
---
To repair, craft or modify armor you go to the armor workbench; to repair weapons, craft or modify them to the weapons workbench, and so on.
---
In workbenches you can also scrap the junk you've picked up so it is reduced to its basic components (crafting materials), and also reduces the weight of that junk.
---
Check the pronounciation too, if you wrote it this way I'm sure that's how you say it as well!
---
My hope is that Fo76 is just a lowkey test for proper coop for TES6 and Starfield
---
I dont know about that, but I also notice that the E3 atom bundle is not avaliable either.
---
Hey, when there’s a world war, you’re the first one to go on the Frontlines :D
---
Bethesda released the game on consoles, they should make their game run decently on consoles.
---
Consoles cost more than PC’s in the long run, so he’s not a cheap ass.
---
And you’re saltier than pickle-chips
---
You’re an idiot.
---
*Take your time in the Forest* (the starting area that makes up the mid-west of the map), then adventure cautiously into the north and south west of the map. The big tall middle of the map can get pretty high level so be careful around there. East is for high level stuff.
---
Trading directly with a player is a nightmare. With a robot it gives you a list of what you have to sell and what they have to buy, but each purchase is separate unlike in previous games. With player machines you can't sell them anything, only buy.
---
Workbenches each do a separate thing, weapons do weapons etc. If you look at it it will tell you the button prompts to create new things, scrap old things and modify or repair old things.
---
I recommend that you open your pip-boy, go to junk, press the button to sort by components and select *screws* and *ballistic fiber* because you will always need them. The game will add a little magnifying glass next to things that contain them so you know you need them.
---
Scrap all junk at a bench (any except cooking) and drop it all off in your stash as often as possible. It's heavy and you'll lose it if you die.
---
Have fun.
---
PS Shotguns are pretty good fun, if you get a few perks in shotguns you can cripple anything that looks at you funny.
---
Good to know, cheers
---
Same here. I played FO76 exclusively after the Beta until I picked up Days Gone and got into that. But I still go back to the wasteland once or twice a week. It's like going back to a favourite holiday location (but full of murderous creatures). Perhaps more now that we have Battle Royal (which has never interested me previously, but looks huge fun). I'll probably be playing this game till I'm 70 (and, no, I'm not 69 and 11 months old)
---
I'm going to assume it's probably a rare spawn in the University then? I'm gonna go take a look, thanks for the info.
---
You need all of the codes to launch plus the briefcase, is that correct?
---
I just did this quest and ended up in the Mire, at level 22.
---
Died five minutes later trying to help Grahm fight a lvl 67 Mirelurk Crab.
---
Oh I imagine that's part of the idea, since Fo76's primary purpose was to deliver online multiplayer using the Creation Engine.
---
Does it go ten min without crashing yet?
---
Does that to me a lot.
---
Just keep trying, or reboot the game, and keep trying.
---
It may also be an issue with your network connection on your device.
---
Yup - I am loving it. Just which there was something baked in to communicate with the team, like, oh look there is a supply stash. Like in Apex Legends.
---
Whilst I'm not trying to convince you to play something you don't want to, I came to NW absolutely despising games like Fortnite and PUBG.
---
I played a few games and now I'm hooked. It's amazing how much fun I had with my two friends I play the game with.
---
I’m happy people enjoy it, why should I be sad?
---
That said my experience was different:
---
- Waiting.....
---
- More waiting.....
---
- Preparing match....
---
- Even more waiting.....
---
- Finally I spawn!
---
- Pickup a weapon in a toolbox or something
---
- Look! There’s a guy over there! I’m gonna shoot him!!!!
---
- Oh..... he’s shooting me back, go figure
---
- D.E.A.D.
---
- Back to adventure mode
---
Yeah not much of a PvP player at all, much more into exploration and camp building but loved this last night. A really fun quick diversion. Genuinely surprised how much I enjoyed it.
---
Im interested in this also. No explanation of how to access them at all
---
I defended it from the get go, I quite liked it. But there was a lot of things that they had to be called out on and the game simply was not ready for launch.
---
Equally, I am not against the presence of micro transactions, but they are taking the piss with the current item price.
---
Yes, i love exploring and quests. Are they gonna add anything new to that?
---
Agree. I sub to Jim Sterling because he makes good content now and again. But his hate boner for FO76 is embarrassing. You can almost hear him drooling at any opportunity he gets to bash the Beth.
---
I'm a vanguard sent user myself! Not good enough to walk that close to death haha
---
well the fortnite "aspect" of the game is less than 24 hours old. It's hardly the main focus.
---
The game revolves around managing your resources (weapons, armour, and CAMP-wise) to 'survive'. The exact nature of that survival is up to the player, be it PVP, vending, exploring etc.
---
im on xbox 1 s and  I didnt see any off that for like 6 or 7 matches I played last night.
---
There are some new high level things, like *Arktos* and the *sewers*, but I haven't tried them. I hear there will be new stuff with NPCs some time, but I don't know when. Starting a *new character* is how I make RPGs seem fresh again, but I know that isn't for everyone. I tried the BR thing and found it surprisingly fun, despite the fact that I don't like multiplayer games. The rewards suck though.
---
If you want to try something different in-game, I was thinking about re-purposing one of my high level characters into a *photographer* and just going around seeing what cool photos I could take. This might not do it for you though.
---
What the fuck are you talking about? Where did I criticize? My flair is "bug". I'm trying to let Bethesda know about a bug. Please, PLEASE tell me where I criticized the game...
---
Same. I've never been interested in BR games (though I was oddly addicted to watching Pewdiepie play PubG), but this looks really fun. I'm so glad everyone gets to start at the same level. And it's a nice touch that you can select your starting location.
---
Trust me, you could barely play for 2 hours before losing connection to the server or having invisible enemies attack you from all directions. The state it is in now is leagues better than it was at launch.
---
Some are stash boxes and some are player icons. Also, people like all sorts for camps. Personally I've been looking forward to getting vault-tek crates.
---
DarkRP in Fallout 76 is my dream.
---
I’m on your side lol.
---
This subreddit has many idiots who downvote people who say anything not super positive about the game
---
I have two characters...so I’m doing both.
---
I love this game but when I see something wrong I call it out. That's how stuff gets fixed.
---
Hey now lol
---
Well I have started 2 new characters. It's actually better experience each time. If you are HC gamer and Fallout fan, you should definitely try this "only use items you found, never craft or repair anything and drop broken items" and if you are like realism enthusiastic, go imaging you can only carry what you could carry in real life: One big gun on back, one pistol on hip, just little ammo, maybe a melee weapon in hand and like whatever healing aid and stuff but only when your character has armor that includes pockets like in leather armor. I loved that kind of RPG adventure
---
Agreed. Most ppl pretend its all good
---
Lol how pissed are you
---
This will definetly help to increase comunity, as it will be more streamed on twitch and youtube now.
---
In that case it is nothing like other rpg's I have played, I just would love to see one day a fallout game made (fallout 76 2?) that is a true rpg
---
I mean, it’s free side content that you don’t have to partake in. It’s something new and refreshing, and it’s actually fairly well done. I see this as a strictly positive addition to fallout 76
---
“Hear the slightest fart” im literally crying. So damn true.
---
I don't see system so I will explain for PC.
---
At every workbench except fermenter and alcohol crafting station( distillery? the name is not with me at the moment) and cooking utilities, you can scrap excess armor, weapons and junk to more basic components by pressing the R key (default).
---
At weapons/armor workbench you can either craft by pressing E or modify/repair by pressing SPACE key. In order to repair you have to inspect your item by first pressing the T key and then R for workbench repair. Also you can rename them while inspecting by pressing the V key.
---
For chemist workbench you can only craft chems, healing supplies or smelting ores for metal scraps with acid or spoiled food for fertilizer.
---
Tinkerers workbench is used to bulk excess scrap for sale or in the case of acid and lead to lower the weight. And crafting ammunition, grenades and some quest items. After you find the dead tourist, you can craft your camera and modify it as well at this workbench.
---
As for tips, do as much events in the starting area as you can. Also visit player's camps when you have more caps to buy cheap plans if they are available.
---
Read your plans and recipes under Notes tab.
---
If you use any of the following perks:
---
- Scrounger
---
- Pharma farma
---
- Can do
---
- Butcher's bounty,
---
don't forget to search the containers by pressing the designated button SPACE on PC.
---
This will yield more resources.
---
If you have more questions I will answer them. If you need in game explanation I can be online in 5-6 hours to help.
---
I like your suggestion of creating a new character. Maybe I will do that. Thanks!
---
Photos sounds interesting, ty
---
"Making Yourself look like a Child"

---
They are alreading adding new things, yes.
---
Yes, the Nuclear Winter update isn't a fully aimed at BR according to the roadmap. There is probably a (small) quest that wil be released at the officialrelease date. Don't forget that this is only a Nuclear Winter BR sneak peak (basically a beta).
---
Load time issues, they need to shorten load times in general.
---
there's weapon holstering??
---
More RPG but Fo76 has shit ton of super good stuff next Fallout game needs. More choices, more consequences and dialogues like we had in New Vegas. Fallout 4 went into wrong direction in my opinion. I rated it 3/10 when Fo3 and FoNV got 9/10 and Fo76 is now 8/10 (that rating is affected by the fact that I rate the game as ONLINE MULTIPLAYER FALLOUT not as "The fallout 5 everyone thought it is")
---
Do you mean the vault tec jumpsuit (blue outfit) or the vault tec university jumpsuit (blue and gold underarmor)
---
You do realise 76 is a spin-off right?
---
That it's not a Main Series game, it's like Tactics/BoS?
---
Ah, whatever. The sky has already fallen for you, while for the rest of us, it's just raining.
---
Yes, please. Also, I don't see this mentioned, but when I'm taken back to the main menu on ps4, I'm always disconnected with an error and have to log back in. Not a big deal, but still additional 30 seconds of wait time between matches.
---
honestly now that ive given it a somewhat fair shot, it aint that bad. Its one of the most fair BR modes ive played. And the only BR ive really played was Apex Legends right after its launch before I got bored of it. Im just surprised the game can handle 52 players in one server and have pretty good performance and netcode. I'd say its the most polished thing in 76 right now
---
Confirmed in PC. A guy in my time got a .50 cal and star shooting at the floor....  and killing everyone in the server 🤣
---
Yep, had about about 3 in the last hour.
---
The chem workbench can be used to make gunpowder (acid and cloth), but eventually you'll get plenty of it off of super mutants. The tinker's bench allows you to craft ammo (lead+steel+gunpowder).
---
Yeah, this should be fixed. Also I can't equip some outfits from the atom store in combination with a mask. Selecting a mask deselects my outfit.
---
NO OP BUILDS. No LVL 200 with Endgear. EZ Wins. :D :D I love it.
---
its actually a lot off fun, give it a try, and you will see that some stuff its not even close to what you thought they were based on your post.
---
Tactics and Bos are non canon, 76 is canon. New vegas is a mainline fallout as it's canon, yet described as a spinoff.
---
Sorry to say, it's really not worth much. Berserkers isn't a fancied first roll, and with it not having explosive, or VATS perks either, as the guy above said 40 scrip or a ~500 caps for someone else to scrip
---
Doesn't look like it. There's a trophy for exiting vault 76 right at the start which I didn't get and the list hasn't even come up in my trophy list.
---
My question is, will any trophies you've done all automatically pop when you purchase the game? I'd hate to start from the beginning again to get the trophies after putting a bit of time into it this week.
---
They should spawn in some creatures for shits and giggles and it would be total chaos in the vault lol
---
I’d like too know too so ima just leave this comment here.
---
I did a tips for new players post yesterday and put "drink nukashine" in there. Couldn't resist.
---
Defending/killing knocked players has been a staple of BR games since day 1. Wtf are you talking about lol
---
Still no gatling laser, gatling plasma, gatling gun or 50 .cal skins 🙁 my heavy is a sad panda
---
I was the same with fallout 4, can't put my finger on it either, Just lost interest
---
I'm showing my age, but fallout 1 was a game changer for me &amp; ive played them all since.
---
 I've now put in over 800 hours into 76, which is the most I've ever played a game &amp; I'm glad I've stuck with it since beta. Think the multiplayer aspects keep it interesting as you never know what another player will do.
---
Welcome &amp; have fun
---
I kinda figured it was intentional, that way you could see what level of armor your opponent has
---
From all the streams I have yet to come across someone that genuinely dislikes nuclear winter. Hats off to Bethesda!!
---
Let everyone change their name as well
---
And? I know it has. Doesn’t mean I have to like the feature. Tf you talking about?
---
Bugs have always been apart of gaming doesn’t mean I have to enjoy them.
---
I agree it’s a lot better and I mean ALOT better than I expected
---
Have you played any other Fallout Game?
---
Do you honestly believe that a Spin Off will determine the path the Main Series takes?
---
Do some research at the least, before claiming Fallout is a new series, and never has been/never will be an RPG (again).
---
Then why let us bring in our outfits at all?
---
No. This entire post is utter fucking rubbish. Every single bit of criticism is justified. The release game was a broken mess that they should forever be ashamed of and hopefully serves as a lesson to other companies to actually take their time before rushing a product out.
---
Bethesda are a company. They want your money. Todd Howard is the the face they show us. They release an unfinished garbage broken product and spent 6 months fixing it. Congrats, the game is playable. They do not deserve gratitude for fixing their own mess. If their intent is to sell us a product, at least make sure it fucking works.
---
Direct your gratitude towards the developers who CLEARLY had to rush a product and have spent 6 months trying to fix it. They weren't the ones forcing a release date before it was ready.
---
I dunno if you remember but classic CS was actually kind of fast compared to this, and had stuff like bunny hopping.
---
Look up A-bomb Radio or Old World radio on youtube if you want plenty of fallout style music.
---

Ill will volunteer if this is what the world is going to be like!
---
God damn consoles hold back all the good games.
---
No matter what.. Its this kids fault.. Cause i dont want to play what he calls 30 fps. Sry dude.. Buy a sports car if you want to go fast. Ya know? 
---
Also i love you☺
---
I found 2 in the past 24h one in flatwoods container in the firebreathers place across from the church. 2nd one was found off grafton monster or somewhere near charleston station (I was trynna get hunters longcoat) hope this helps!
---
Any time. I'm thinking that stealth will work well because then I can sneak up and take photos without agro'ing enemies, but mostly I'm thinking of photographing players playing. I got a cool shot of some guy PVPing.
---
I for one like the progression of getting awesome gear and then one-shotting noobs. It remindes me of Classic WoW, grinding for that awesome gear to bring into BG's to stomp people who haven't worked that hard or are brand new.
---
However, the PvP "toggle" system needs to be fixed for those who don't want to PvP within certain PvE zones.
---
I will also say that there are a few balance changes that need to be made for high-end gear, but the distinguishable difference between low-level and high-level gear should remain the same.
---
How is canon lore = spin off or not? It's a different game than rpg fallouts, it was advertised as a different game than rpg fallouts, yet half a year later people still think it's main series fallout rpg. What gives?
---
You’re confusing me.
---
Bethesda released the game on ps4. Either they should optimize the game to run on The console they released the game on, or todd howard personally can swallow my shit
---
People read terms?
---
I'm wondering if your armor stacks like in fo4.  When I was in Power armor it still showed I was wearing marine combat armor.  I still died quick, so maybe it doesn't.
---
Some are camp stash boxes, others are player icons.
---
You play in the forest so of course blue jumpsuits are going to stand out a bit, but not that much. The loot spawn are completely random. It's a team battle royal so stay in group and protect your teammates, bit don't stay to close to each others as not to get shredded by Gatling guns
---
76 is an MMORPG. saying "small Bethesda niche love this" makes me wonder, as a long time FO fan.. What do you have in mind, that would keep the game popular with an online crowd, but still wrangle in all the different opinions of tons of players personalities for you. to me, that sounds pretty stale
---
I am genuinely interested in what you have in mind to improve the game, no hate
---
I kind of thought that, I don’t think I’ve seen anyone say they are looking for a berserker anything.
---
Thanks - scrip it is lol
---
A reference to what?
---
Blueprinting any large, elaborate structure is always going to be an issue because of the finicky way the foundations interact with the landscape. Try building something with a single foundation base. Lots of people do. I prefer starting fresh each time and building into and around existing structures. Or you could try to build a separate, small structure for your vending machines and just blueprint that.
---
It's funny because X-02 armor is actually something you can buy in the creation club in Fallout 4. They're basically making a fan made item canon. (Unless that item was made by Bethesda, I'm not sure)
---
After a few rounds 2 min is def enough.    
---
Hope they make the reload faster
---
They really should.
---
Is there a way to check your stats?
---
“It’s just you”
---
Well Said. Have an UpVote and a little applause.  
---
Looking forward to NPC's being added later on this year, as long as there's no Preston Garvey type character, the type you'd rather shoot than help, it should be glorious!
---
Don't die.
---
Happiness is a warm gun!
---
Great to see that it has been acknowledged by the team quickly, and at least a fix is being arranged so not all hope is lost, I needed an excuse to work on my aim anyhow after quickly realising over in nuclear winter that I have forgotten how to shoot by myself!
---
Well, at least one person's said it now, so...
---
Yes and my breakfast was cold... No xbox releases games.. Dont mix up your words. Every game that gets cross platform has contracts. And a major part of that is to hold back what a gam3 could be on pc. Look at new vegas. J swaywr had to add mods to put content back in the game. You fucking plebs are holding back society.
---
1000exp isn't that much really. How long did they match last?
---
It's just that it's such a great environment, it deserves unrushed exploration. But there's no reason both ways can't be met. They could leave it the way it is in NW (in fact some people don't even want it, they want to get into NW faster), and make it explorable in Adventure. That way anyone who wants to can go into it in Adventure and just hang out.
---
If as with 4, and now 76 they are continuing to stray from rpg elements in favour of becoming a looter shooter. I believe that they should go full out looter shooter, Make linear team death match maps, a zombies mode but with ghouls.
---
Too broke to buy a console? Save up, maybe you can get one someday
---
While this sounds really cool the way you got this band of brothers together, solo players should still be able to play solo, and not have to decide either to team up with strangers or to be against teams and get sniped in a coordinated fashion :)
---
I really hope that they split the mode at launch, so that we, the loners, can play as we wish. 
---
It also makes more sense as there is one overseer spot open. Having the option to quickly kill your team-mates at the end of a match would also be ... fun?
---
I actually enjoy it a lot I even one my first match couple hours ago I stayed up all night playing I’m gonna be tired at work today 🐼
---
I don’t either. I’m real bad at them. But I say, it’s worth just a few tries honestly. It’s real neat. It’s got a good style, and it’ll feel familiar to you. 
---
If you don’t want to, that’s fine, but if you’re skipping over it just cause you dislike BRs, I’d just recommend reconsidering and trying it out a few times because there’s something fun about it that I have never ever found in any other BR. You do you though! Just my 2¢!
---
Would be nice to explore just for lore/background reason. So you don't have to rush through.
---
Maybe also for some to have a direct ingame access to nuclear winter mode without exit and reentry.
---
How do you open the stash boxes
---
Genuinely the only sensible advice I can think of is stick with your team. Solo players die quickly.
---
To flex on the vault suits in the lobby
---
I would like to think Thursday with the next inside the vault
---
Ok..you win. How will us PC players ever get the monies for a fancy box?
---
What to do if you're not interested in BR? Play BR, honestly.
---
I hate, seriously fucking hate, BR games and hate even more how big that shit has gotten....However, as against it as I was that BR was coming to 76, this shit is fuckin awesome! 
---
I only got about 2 hours of sleep last night because I couldn't put Nuclear Winter down as it was so damn addictive. Now I'm gonna be dragging ass at work...Oh well, do it again tonight!
---
Seriously, give NW a shot. Play a few games, it's fun as fuck! Playing with friends makes it even funner.
---
No them owning up isn't good enough. Them fixing shit and putting their words into action might make things good enough but the fact they thought it was OK to launch a game in that state really says way more than any patch after the fact could.
---
Press x on PS4, can't comment on other versions.
---
Nerdy - from the bottom of my blood pumping thing in the chest area... Never change.
---
Are you talking about the Public Workbenches (PW)? These are worth taking on for a new player as they reward you with drugs, plans, weapons etc. Taking over a PW does open you up to PVP, but this has never, ever happened to me (I'm a Level 77). If you come across an unclaimed PW the game should announce it as a mission. To claim it you have to kill all the local enemies and pay a small charge in caps. Once you claim it you'll be rewarded. Very soon after you'll be given a 'Defend' quest and given a few minutes to build turrets etc using the PW's resources. You then have to kill of waves of enemies (dogs, ghouls, liberators etc). It's usually pretty easy in the early game. Once you've defended the PW you'll be given even more rewards. Then leave the PW behind and go do something else. It's not usually worth the time and effort to build extractors to mine the mineral pits.
---
You can open a Lemonade stand, buy water in bulk and sell it for more at a Marathon Run, or you can sell your butt by a truck stop for chump change. I recommend the lemonade and water stand :)
---
It isn't because I and others would like to have the option to explore it. Just let NW keep the 2 minutes or maybe less and make the vault accessible in adventure and survival mode. A place like that shouldn't be only used for an gamemode.
---
Honestly I’d actually kinda disagree. The game is not designed from the ground up to be a BR, so it’s got clunkier Fallout gameplay whilst being a BR. Most hardcore or just regular BR players (Apex, Fortnite, ROE, etc etc) would probably find it too clunky and not as smooth and fast as most BR games. 
---
I’d say it’s more for Fallout fans and players looking to try something new, whether it be a BR or just any game. But that’s what I’ve felt while playing, I can understand you’d feel different. Everyone plays BRs differently, so..
---
atomic store shop, press Purchase Atoms
---
&gt;All they showed was a trailer
---
You do know we get to play nuclear winter DLC for a week, right?
---
Nukashine gives you an instant buff to your xp gain but it also spoils very fast so you have to drink it straight away ;)
---
Weird I still haven’t found any in my menus or in the lobby to open. I’ve collected one but I think it was just an icon
---
Fallout 76 is way better than some would have you think. (Mainly the infantile petulant whiners)  
---
I never wanted a refund, like some whined they needed, it's not perfect, nothing is, but it's grown so much since launch, and is becoming a favourite of mine in the Fallout series, although I still feel Fallout 4 is the best one, FO76 might surpass it at some point, might.
---
I have a discord if you wanna join that
---
I already did that and bought the 1000 deal but it only came with the 1000
---
It’s the very similar terms as joining the Creation Club for fallout 4 fyi
---
It's absolutely  not for me; I just don't like Battle Royale games at all, but I did give it a couple of goes and everyone in the lobby seemed pretty fired up about it.
---
I guess it satisfies that PvP urge that many folks have without the need for making that "One Perfect Build" that everyone needs to adopt in Survival PvP in order to be competitive.
---
Their track record with bugs isn't very good but I really haven't ran into any major bugs in the 15-ish games I've played so far. This is easily the most bug-free update in months so idk what you are on about
---
Maybe that's like, the official designation they're giving the Hellfire armor?
---
When you get killed in NW I'd prefer to be dropped back into the vault instead of booted back to the main menu. This would give people more time to explore. I'd love a entrance/exit door to adventure in there too tho
---
I hate the idea of % chance to hit. I trust myself more than my wrist watch.
---
they just don't drop anymore. If you have an old one, you still have it.
---
Stash boxes are accessed in the camp build menu, icons through the atomic shop.
---
Having to defend a downed teammate adds a whole new layer to BR dynamics. The goal is to be the last team standing, by any means necessary. What are you suggesting? Sending an otherwise downed player straight back to the lobby? Why do you think your opinion about a standard BR feature matters? And comparing this feature to a bug is fucking stupid and you know it.
---
I've heard Farmville doesn't let you kill downed players
---
Ah okay thank you
---
Blablabla... I haven't bought the game... Blablabla... Bethesda is evil... Blablabla... I complain about a game i don't know at all... Blablabla... Please notice me... Blablabla... I have affection issue... Blablabla Bethesda is evil... Blablabla...
---
Opinions aren't right or wrong! You don't have to like everything! :)
---
I don't like it either - mostly because I don't like that genre of game. It isn't Fallout for me. Fallout is about skills, gear, building a character to fit your playstyle.
---
Many folks seem to be having fun though, which is only a good thing, I guess :)
---
Nope I'm only being disconnected when trying to Leave a server
---
It's pretty fun with a team with mic. I actually won my second game and finished as second after that. Pump action is OP
---
What difference does it make? 7600 hours is such a ludicrous number that it's surely unobtainable.
---
I'd like to unlock rewards like a box of screws and stuff. That would be awesome. "Congratulations! Here is a bulk packet of ballistic fiber and 300XP."
---
No actually I genuinely hate BR games.
---
There is a separate version which is to the right of the others. Says e3 bundle or something like that.
---
That would be cool. Time to explore while it's ongoing and also maybe with some Terminals/Screens or else were you can watch the 10 last remaining players.
---
Me and my friend really enjoyed it, we've player three games so far and won two of them in a row, I've enjoyed the game, so far the only problem I've run into is kills and such, it works for the most part, but there does seem to be something buggy with kills awarded, I threw a grenade into a group of enemies and saw the bodies fly, as well as the damage, but was awarded no kills, but instead my partner who wasn't even close was awarded all my kills for the game. but it is surprisingly an enjoyable experience that seems to have a  bit of polish. and fairly balanced for all types of players, I was surprised when two games in a row only 2 teams of 2 remained
---
&gt; Specifically 5.56?
---
Supermutants, but only if you use another weapon instead of one that uses 5.56. Farming lead, steal and acid/gunpowder to craft 5.56 while using super duper and ammosmith is stil the best option though.
---
Battle Royale isn't really my thing, but if people are enjoying it, and it's making the game better IE More money spent = more cashflow to develop more content.... I'm happy with it.
---
You're overpowered two shot weapons have been correctly nerfed. So you'll have to learn a new way to play, with a new perk load out.
---
I suggest bloodied/stealth.
---
Haha at first I felt the "map drop" was lazy but it's actually amazing when you and friends choose a location and its revealed that there is a swarm of people there lmao the reactions are priceless. So tense and simple!
---
Only complaint is for a way to revive people and/or to lengthen lives
---
but in doing that, you're asking them to sacrifice one aspect of good gameplay and lean completely on another. it seems to me like they're trying to do both, but have been having a hard time because it's new
---
There is no reason to use vsync anyway, if you dont uncap your framerate in the ini files. The framerate is caped at 60 fps.
---
Raid idiots are workshops. Fun and rewarding
---
&gt; overpowered
---
&gt; bloodied
---
Uhm?.
---
I don't see a issue with your dragon damage, it looks doubled to me
---
Yeah, but there's a terminal in Vault 51 where their Top Scientist (name escapes me) sent a request for the X-02 plans to the Enclave at Adams, so it's in the canon now, unless this is all some kind of simulation.
---
Bloodied is a trade off..... One hit from a ghoul and I'm pretty much dead.
---
Maybe we could play mini games to help our remaining team members. Win a boxing tournament for a directed weapon drop for example haha.
---
I mean... It did have a LOT of room for improvement. Still does.
---
I hate the weapon wheel in all of the game modes. I liked the Fallout 4 shortcuts a lot more. It's a real struggle to slam a RadAway when you're stuck in a corner surrounded by glowing ferals. I was very surprised to find that I enjoyed the BR mode, but the rewards aren't enough. I want to get a packet of screws or something useful.
---
if there is no problem with the Dragon, then why is the hunting rifle so high in comparison? even though the base damage is almost 1/2 of the dragon?
---
They give you the lowest level one, there's a version for every 10 levels.
---
So it's fair to me that I do so much damage.
---
Totally agree. I'm lazy and sometimes i don't wanna speak... i just wanna hear the gunshots and footsteps
---
It's the last one listed in the 'purchase atoms' page.
---
No issues, but the server I was on went down for maintenance. I got a 20 minute notification.
---
I’d love to throw two suggestions out:
---
1 - I’d love for the entire team to be rewarded with a little XP if a teammate makes it to the end. It gives us more reason to stay and watch and root for our teammates after death.
---
2 - let us play pipboy games in the death window if we don’t want to leave the team or the game, but don’t want to observe the game.
---
This sounds like the area. Waterfall and a little boat :)  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ7cvfZzo-Y&amp;t=2s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ7cvfZzo-Y&amp;t=2s)
---
Yep, and building a better one also checks off one of the challenges
---
Don't feel bad, Chad.  Don't hang low. Ex-President W. Bush still loves you.
---
It's fun, but your not wrong they did say no battle royal, but it wouldn't be the first to time they lied, but the other commenters are right you should experience it first, when I first heard that nw would be battle royal I thought hey it's gonna suck, but after actually playing it, it's actually fun
---
And would you know off the top of your head some good places to farm those materials? I kinda figured crafting it myself would be the better option but I’m just unsure where the best places are to farm things and honestly haven’t looked anything up yet lol
---
Yeah I dont mind that but this just said controls disabled, then disconnected and back to start screen
---
I disagree. It's essentially a level so it should be per character.
---
Good yes.  Mirv no!  It split in the mirv normally "deplys" a short distance after launching.  And normally it lands close enough to hurt you.  And make it a two shot.   Nope. Nope. Nope.
---
"It ShOuLd HaVe BeEn BeTtEr FrOm ThE sTaRt" - literally every moron attacking this game
---
No the instigating effect does double damage on first hit I believe, and the hunting rifle is effected by rifle man perks and any higher damage dealing mods you have on it
---
The thing is, you dont need legendary items in those games because once the story ends, theres little to no end game content. Sure you can complete the remaining missions and explore but thats it. In MMOs, you need end game content to give players a reason to keep playing, and the randomized legendary system is exactly that (until more DLC arrives).
---
Lmao if you want this play COD... fallout is a god damn rpg. 76 is mmorpg because it’s online
---
I thought my controller was on the fritz (I mean it is, but in a different way)!
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one with this issue.
---
Where do the rewards go? I got the rank up perk card packs, but it says I get a box also, but where does that box go?
---
Do you have a PS+ subscription, you'll need that to.
---
I thought the Dragon was affected by the Rifle perks too?
---
Both Dragon and HR are Instigating
---
It’s a bittersweet feeling seeing so few player vendor camps in adventure mode. Goes to show just how much the player established player base actually likes BR, or so it seems at this time. I love it. 
---
For me, it’s about how casual it all is. It’s fun to exchange fire and actually have engagements that last more than a few seconds. If my team dies, no one is screaming toxicity at anyone, we just move on to the next match. The item/weapon availability is great, and the carry weight limit forces you to choose from just a few to keep on you. 
---
I honestly could go on but I think you get the idea. The elitists and day one haters can bash it all they want, but deep down I KNOW they’re just too stubborn to swallow their pride and admit this game has been great all along.
---
I found it so much fun, a very pleasant surprise.
---
Well my shotgun wasn’t even the two shot version, explosive, vampiric, and lightweight. I just feel it does so little damage that it’s not even worth using at this point. I was in the middle of semi rebuilding my character to be more rifle centric and drop shotguns altogether, maybe pick up something else instead as a side arm/backup weapon.  It’s just been too long since I’ve played and I’m sure some of the spots that were good to farm at release aren’t as good as ones that were discovered more recently.
---
No idea. I've won 5 games and reached lvl 10... no idea where my rewards are if there are a y at all.
---
I have found it very enjoyable especially if you get a full squad of 4 buddies and queue up together. It is a nice change of pace from just farming bosses and about everything I wanted/expected from a Fallout BR. Thematically it also fits very well and feels more organic unlike a lot of other games with BR sub games imo.
---
I'm not sure, but I believe that the instigating doubled your hunting rifle damage and the sneak damage also did
---
I always hated PvP in any games. I am a noob for that.
---
I never played BR games for that reason.
---
But NW is great. I have fun! Even if I get killed a lot :)
---
Yar I ran up FNV and FO4 and they do the same. As they are not actual real time shooters, the need to try and jump+strafe never arose in several thousand hours.
---
I gotta say that Im with you... I like that mode a lot even though I suck at it and usually don't play that stuff xD
---
I am unhappy with human npcs. I was enjoying not hearing the same four or five canned phrases from the bots. I don't understand the whole cash grab thing, do the baby marxists not realize everything Bethesda releases is intended to make money? It's not as if the owners or employees wan the company to go bankrupt.
---
Also, is buying the legendaries from the legendary vendor worth it? I didn’t know if collecting them and trading them in for scrips was an efficient way to get some good 3* legendaries
---
When I was playing a match yesterday, sitting on a hill sniping people as the ring grew closer and I could hear the heat behind me and the distortion of my screen and as I found myself one of the last three fighting, I died to a stupid mistake, cursed myself, and realized my heart was racing in my chest like I had just finished a good run.
---
I didn't want to admit it, but it's actually really fun.
---
I was very disappointed to learn that mine was just a bloody icon. Why would I want a box as my icon? Give me a fistful of lead and screws instead!
---
I hate to say... I've been testing smaller and smaller builds on one foundation block for a few weeks now. I use about 55% of my space. Your separate vending build is brilliant though. As I'm building yet again, I'll do it now. -Thank you.
---
r/titlegore
---
Well, I have news for you, this is a BR game, so you don’t hate them. 🤔
---
I wouldn't doubt that they're very similar, but I don't remember coming across any mentions of supplementary terms in previous Fallout games. Having to accept things you're not even given links to, is based on my experience a relatively new thing.
---
I wasn't able to find the eula for F4 Creation Club with a quick google search, so I couldn't check it.
---
What did you, as you said in your title, *loathe* about them?
---
I watched my hubby play while I waited for my download to finish.  It looks like so much fun! I really really suck at PvP but I'm super amped to try it.
---
It's annoying how alike their names are, I'm referring to the blue jumpsuit outfit the with vault tec logo on the back and the front pocket.
---
Why play 76 then
---
If the legendary items negatively impact the balance of combat (which I definitely think they do) then maybe it's not worth it on the grounds of giving players something to grind for.
---
* The sneak should affect both Deragon and HR equally.
---
* Instigating should affect both Dragon and HR equally. (although it will make the difference between them greater)
---
* Rifle perk cards should affect both equally.
---
Tonight I will remove all my perk cards to ensure I am not making a silly mistake somewhere and then check the damages again. Need to find some easy enemies to test this against.... would be good to have a target in Camp that we could test against.
---
Lucky Hole Mine for lead ore. Don't forget to wear Excavator PA to get more lead ore for each node. 
---
Steel can basically be found anywhere but it can be combined with farming super mutants for 5.56. Just loot al their guns and other steel weapons and scrap them while using the scrapper perk.
---
Acid is a bit more difficult but can be found on Yaoguai and can also be farmed at the Hemlock Holes Maintenance workshop located in the Toxic Valley.
---
Rank 9 with 4 wins... no idea
---
Posters in train station
---
They are icons and STASH skins for adventure/survival
---
I wondered the same
---
I find keeping the camp smaller and building up saves a lot of budget. Lights, turrets, brahim pens and tamed animals take up the most space.  
---
I found this cool place with a waterfall and boat. I was able to build everything I needed and by keeping it smaller I still have a huge budget left.  
---
Yeah thats only the BR mode though, which a lot of people(not me) aren't interested in, I'm talking about the Expansion.
---
Do i not get to open them somehow? I want cool animations :C
---

Experimental M.I.R.V.: Firing the Experimental MIRV Fat Man in a downward direction no longer causes the explosion to occur extremely close to the player.
---
How about modes for different sizes of groups? Doubles? SINGLES?
---
Wish I had read them. 
---
Turns out I gave up my first born son. His name is Shaun. Have you seen him?
---
How am i supposed to get them? I dont see them anywhere
---
what ive found: 
---
1. stick with your team
---
2. (on XB1 at least) nobody ever drops cream (all loot to yourself)
---
3. auto AR feels stupidly strong
---
4. ive opted for one of my dark color AS skins, green camo ones imo stick out in the brown grasses of the area.
---
5. watch the top of your screen for names and hp bar popups, i found you can get a general location on someone from a bit of a distance from that
---
So what’s the meta so far?
---
Is it agility based for mobility? Is it luck based for nuke codes? What are we seeing so far?
---
Atomshop. You can unlock them from there for free.
---
I played for an hour before and had 2 server disconnects. In the UK if that makes a difference.
---
I hope they come out with a solo mode and etc in the near future so I don’t have to go against full squads. Other than that, I enjoy it. Not so bad.
---
If you bought the atom packs with the promotion, you need to craft it at your armor bench, for a few cloth scrap. It is at the over armor section.
---
How about some RL local hosts such as the McElroy brother's? DJUNG DJUNG  DJUNG  DJUNG  DJUNG  DJUNG I WANT TO MUCH! ON LITERALLY ANYTHING!
---
But he will buy them blood packs.
---
They are just skins, not lootboxes.
---
Them dudes died when the bombs hit.
---
bottom line up front, focus on the shot gun or rifle don't bother trying both, consider unarmed for secondary and back up weapon if you want two skills.
---
yeah , they nerfed my tse gauss I had to rebuild from that myself. now I rock the vampire laser gat for all its glory.. and faults.  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f148e68&amp;d=sq2sr2s32id2c72lt2sg2a12a72p10s12ic4ip2ls2sx2cu2l71ep0e52cr0&amp;w=&amp;n=Gatling%20laser%20lowcost&amp;m=9af1c](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f148e68&amp;d=sq2sr2s32id2c72lt2sg2a12a72p10s12ic4ip2ls2sx2cu2l71ep0e52cr0&amp;w=&amp;n=Gatling%20laser%20lowcost&amp;m=9af1c) theoretically the damage is underwhelming enough that it will not be nerfed and possibly they may even buff it!
---
when fighting scorchbeast you have to make sure youre in an open area so they can land. if your on a building or too close to trees for example they will not land. Also enforcer for the shotgun staggers....I think. cripples. if you can get a cripple hit on them, and youre in the open,  they will land. the tse is still viable but you basically have to build more damage into your build for that shotgun. if you're using rifles then maybe you have some of the old school multiple weapons loadout. that wont work well now, need to focus on one weapon one weapon only and build everything around it. if you absoloutly must have two weapon types unarmed melee is the least expensive back up weapon you can get. (perk cost wise enhanced with mutations makes it just as powerfull as the others.)
---
fighting scorchbeasts for loot is a bad investment. they are however a great source of XP, for legendary farming I recommend  west tek harpers ferry whitespring and robco. 
---
from the overall tone of your post it feels like your frustrated most with ammo efficiency and lack of burst. if you haven't tried black powder rifle and dragon that is some serious range. with unarmed melee as back up or with a smaller semi auto for lots of small things the black powder rifle is by far the most ammo efficent of ballistic rifles and the ammo is cheap to make. suggest combining it with stealth and vats crits for maximum joygasms. shoot. hide reload rinse repeat if swarmed by smaller faster things break out the secondary weapon. the dragon looks better on paper that the standard black powder but it rarely ever gets all four shots on target and the dura sucks monkey balls even with gunsmith 5. regular old black powder rifle lasts awhile and you'd be surprised how much fun they are.
---
I suppose if you consider the matching mechanics for setting up the games that's something to think about in how the matches could be balanced. That and other parameters to match players as best as possible to the game.
---
As to the other points. Nothing stopping you from doing some recce in adventure mode to scope out sites. Fine, it won't tell you the loot drops but it's still assessing the ground in a more critical mindset for the NW mode.
---
Saw 15 lvl 4 and lower in Flatwoods and all the way up to Vault 76 yesterday and I hope some will stay. A new inflow of gamers would give Bethesda more money and motivation to keep Fallout 76 alive.
---
Should I level up with the game as is or just wait till the new NPC's and quest lines show up?
---
I’m pretty sure I got the plan for that one near the radio tower NE flatwoods. If you fast travel to the tower, there’s a house right near, it was outside on a chair next to a workbench
---
Yeah, I read through that whole thing after some weird shit at the top of it
---
Anything online these days have super questionable EULA
---
Literally nothing you buy is considered yours and can be taken away (your account included) at their discretion, lol
---
It la been fixed now
---
I would be broke after the first round. Bet?
---
People are stupid. They made up their minds and trying to convince them otherwise simply means you are a shill.
---
You can have custom ini and it allow you to play NW mode. You need to have no custom files in game's folder.
---
There are PvE elements in BR.
---
Is it just me who can't help but drink the shine? Like i know i shouldn't. I know i may die... But i just do.
---
Probably says more about me than i should share here haha.
---
Double or nothing 😂
---
Been saying since the beginning of this that ALL online games have this kinda bumpy rough start on day one. The die hards will defend (and why wouldn't they. They saw it will only get better) and some will work tirelessly to troll anyone who does like it. (That's their right I just don't feed the trolls) but eventually, the game will get better and they will listen to the community it all just takes time.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
I have a two shot with 90% reduced weight I carry around it's great. I run a shotgun build but got 3 points into the demolition perk so the Fatman does about 1500 damage. It's great if u need to take out a group of enemies fast, I usually just carry about 3 mini nukes. If I didn't have reduced weight I prob wouldn't bother with it though
---
Signed.
---
Also, there should be a free personal terminal in the atom shop for your camp.  It’ll tell you about dailies you’ve unlocked and where to go for some new content.
---
Strange. I live in EU, midle of it, and I was able to buy that package.
---
PC player.
---
Might take it out for special occasions, Queen, Arktos, Whitesprings etc.
---
Deal! No pain no gain!
---
They literally just announced NPC’s and story.. I’m not sure what your talking about
---
Ye this will be great, I am sure they will implement it after this pre beta, it's a no brainier
---
oh just want to add the shotgun is probably still the most versatile weapon you can get if you want to focus on just one weapon type. its excellent up close decent at medium range and at long range you can just use it to aggro mobs to you. you might burn more ammo at long range in those rare occasions where you cant close but even at longer ranges you can still plink things to death. just reread your post about the rifle / shotgun portion of your build. yeah if you're going to use that shotgun you're gonna have to pump all perks into one or the other its not strong enough by itself anymore. I am not sure if explosion perks  affect damage anymore either.
---
Your question on here is the equivalent of Googling it 😅
---
The game has always had npc's and story, I never said that and I don't know what you're talking about
---
Its an online only game. No single player.
---
I think he's with the insitute.
---
Yeah I was surprised too. I even won on my third match.  Im really not that into battle royales either.
---
I get that, but from June 10 - 17 it's supposed to be FREE. I assumed that meant not buying the game OR having an online subscription.
---
Nice to hear that from you. As someone who has well near 500 hours playing since launch I just wanted to see if I could provide some advice from my point of view. In my experience the survival elements start becoming really easy as you level up. I would begin to farm "non-perishables"; the most popular is probably going to be dog food, but going to the locked fridge at flatwoods every day will also work. Enemies are pretty broken sometimes, but as you start farming you'll begin forming strategies to deal with them better. I suggest you stick to the forest until you can get at least past level 10-15. You might want to look into perk builds to maximize whatever play style you want to follow. After a while it does get boring (level 150 some for me), but I just made some new characters to experiment with new perks. I haven't played since January, and coming back after E3 I realized there's a whole lot of new stuff so stick around. There's bound to be more content soon after you get bored. Most importantly, play at your own pace, and set small goals for yourself. What I like most about this game is that leaving for months didn't really leave me in a position of being lost. Take in the scenery, collect dumb things, dress as a fire fighter. Just enjoy yourself.
---
Oh No
---
And no vats
---
Ohhhhhh ok that makes sense
---
You can get a free two day ps plus trial too
---
True. But sony requires you to have ps plus to play online
---
Too many? more like not enough.
---
Then all 3D fallouts are spin offs because they are vastly different to 1 and 2
---
Yesh bought that, just because it was free lol. Will have a look, thanks.
---
Bethesda isn't in charge of what requires a PS+ subscription. Personally I think it's absolute BS that you need PS+ to play online one the PS4, but hey ho.
---
You can hide them from your quest log. Problem solved, /thread.
---
I killed 7 people with a nuke last night.
---
As much as this is something I definitely didn't want I actually had fun. Good effort devs cant wait for wastelanders now. 🍾
---
Hmm I havent heard of this free week, but it sounds like some fine print stuff.
---
You can download this game for free the one week yes, but u still need PS plus to play it cause it's a online only game
---
I know it’s a nitpick; I would just prefer to take my time with each one and savor the lore instead of feeling rushed to get them out of the pipboy.
---
Other side effect: After playing NW for 2-3 hours, for some reason I've got over 150 purified water in my inventory
---
They do that when they have crippled limbs.
---
I’m going to venture a guess, that maybe buying in bulk before, you had “A LOT”....?..... perhaps bethesda decided you had “to many” when all the ruling issues were being resolved, and deleted them.
---
im personally not to worried about it based on the fact that on X1 the "LFG" thing is already full of people trying to make "god squads" like every other br game has. asking for # of wins and overseer ranks etc.
---
that said id like to see a list of all the cards you can choose from, so far i haven't seen anything that would give a huge edge
---
No you sre not the only one and yes you can go into pipboy tasks click the quest to unselect it and remove the wall of text currently covering the right side of your screen. Also if you go to the map you can click on the markers that appear there and choose to stop tracking them. youre welcome I just saved your life. o7
---
Where are these skins? Am i blind ? I cant find anything in the atomic shop
---
It was more a kind of rant, because in the older installments anything of the above mentioned things would happen to inform you about new content.
---
Go to the atom store from the main menu or pause button. You can favourite unlocked skins there that will show up in NW.
---
Maybe your grenade downed them and your friend finished them off.
---
It just looks so funny
---
ini edits are working fine, please don't change it for the game is  unplayable without the tweaks I use: disabled anti-aliasing, disabled depth of field, disabled v-sync, disabled mouse acceleration, manual mouse sensitivity tweak, XY/ mouse-scaling fix. If these edits didn't work I'd have refunded during the BETA, so I'm really glad they work, please don't change that.
---
If your playing the free trial this week it maybe BR only. I really only have been playing solo storyline for months.
---
Nice.
---
I think we did. You just havent gotten one yet.
---
Or do as I do, when you have a "safe" moment while camping a building or similar, drop all you don't need, and let em know. Did in a few matches with np
---
You can drop items though, so if people need stuff, they could just ask.
---
Seen that happen a lot in other BR. Don't see why it should be any different here.
---
I play solo in adventure mode 99% of the time. It's fun to bump into other players here and there, but I don't feel the need to team up all the time. Adding a designated solo mode would serve nothing other than making the game more like the single player entries, which was never the point.
---
Simple some people, like me, love the lore and the world bethesda builds but also want to experience it with friends. Funny thing is that this has brought more people into the mainline games. My mates got 76 for the multi player but they became enthralled in the lore and now many of them are playing through the old games. Something that I struggle to get them to try out before playing 76.
---
Gotta editorialise the shit out of it for the sweet sweet karma.. amirite?
---
Or OP really is just too dumb to read past 5 sentences.
---
Wait really?
---
I bought about 300+ maybe 400+ (I’m pretty sure it was around that) and I sold most then kept about 150 for myself.
---
been playing since launch. I do not have a ps+ account and have not been prompted to do so.
---
my son and daughter do, but under their own names. ?????????
---
I should maybe keep my gob shut.
---
I got four wins already. The last one I won I had a .50 cal with 200 rounds and power armor with psycho, bufftats, and drive. The other three players went down really quick lol.
---
I technically don't mind that. It's kind of like playing monopoly and thinking that you can take the monopoly money and your in-game character with you after the game's over, etc.  
---
But also, if you put in actual money and your expectations aren't met, then there should be room to negotiate for a refund.
---
The whole lobby ganging up and beating the shit out of some mole miners would be a fun watch
---
Yeah, I'm on PS4. I was just struggling with how trading with other players works, I figured that the workbenches would be somewhat similar to those in FO4. Other than tinkerer, I'm assuming that has something to do with mods etc....
---
Level 10 is an overseers chair which looks pretty nice actually. Level 11 is a .44 skin and level 12 is the statue if I remember correctly
---
A great game shouldn't need apologies made for it at E3 after the state it was launched in just seven months ago.
---
Sweet, thanks man! Going to explore the starting area when I get home and see what I can find :).
---
Pretty sure the new cards are only for NW
---
We are still only in early access for the mode.
---
Maybe even an option for just “find new game.”
---
You need the atoms lack that specifically called the E3 bundle .
---
100 x 2 (instigating) = 200.
---
200 x 2.5 (x2 vats crit + 50% more vats crit damage) = 500.
---
500 x 2.5 (Sneak shot with covert operative) = 1250.
---
Using weak points damage multiplier (i.e. shooting head) makes it x2 for a total of 2500.
---
Enjoy your gun mate :)
---
Only glitch so far I saw is reviving people while in power armor. You may get stuck in your armor and cannot move
---
You're comparing apples with oranges. It's great that you love what's in NW but if the other game modes had a 20 min life cycle, I don't think people would be complaining much about balance either.
---
Balance of Adventure/Survival is all good but what lessons can they take from NW that they can apply to those other modes?
---
Brill! Thanks for taking the time to reply :)
---
Or the friend may have shot the grenade
---
...sure.
---
I got a 10 kill win yesterday with a nuke lmao I love this addition to the game it’s just so nice to have something to do when I get bored of adventure
---
You must've heard gunfights in the distance and decided to keep hiding in the bushes then lol
---
Don't think it's balanced. Some weapons are definitely better than others and same goes for armors and perks. At least in adventure mode, a good legendary effect can make some utterly shitty weapons like pipe guns viable
---
It wouldn't even be too difficult because the entrance of Vault 51 already exists on the adventure/survival map.
---
It's it on the Bethesda website?
---
Some of them are icons. Look that section in the shop. Look for a tiny atombomb thingy in the corner.
---
thanks a lo for the info. Its a railway, I really love killing the Westtek Mutants with a single nail. :)
---
You drunk?
---
Bad thing is when they are coming from all directions :-(
---
Yeah, the public workbenches. I saw something about taking them over/being contested etc. Going to see if I can find one around where I am.at the moment. I the first town you come to as part of the quest line. 
---
Thanks for taking the time to reply man.
---
Well I agree with you except for the creature balance..clearly they are too squishy. Maybe if they hit harder it would balance with their low health.
---
But for firefights, man is the balance good. Especially the scarcity of meds. I literally had to hunt someone down and kill them just in the hopes they had some radaway on them. It felt like real survival.
---
I don't think it should be balanced that way for adventure mode because PvP is not as important or prevalent there, but definitely for survival mode.
---
Haha yeah I thought of that too. Would it still show damage numbers if someone else detonated it?
---
'Choo choo motherfucker' xD
---
If Nukashine is anything like the latter part of the name, I want some ;). 
---
Word on the Grapetats is that you black out and come round in some random place on the map. 
---
How do I get me some haha.
---
Those perk cards are specifically for Nuclear Winter. Read the rest of Bethesda's post.
---
is it referring to the Legendary player thing? but it has not been released yet
---
I love the deployment method tbh. Its always a fun experience to be like "Alright boys where we dropping" "Well this place shouldnt be too crowded no one ever drops here" *Literally 8 dots appear on top of yours "Oh fuck" 😂
---
How would new players start playing if Vault 76 is dysfunctional 24 hours after Reclamation Day? Maybe we could switch between 2102 and 2103 - there’s no way they would scrap the entire Scorched storyline?
---
Yeah but I’ve found that people in fortnite are overly competitive whereas us dudes in the 76 BR aren’t gonna be playing super sweaty most of the time so we actually see it as fun when midway through a fight we get attacked by Lurks
---
About 24 minutes if I remember correctly. Also adventure exp gains can vary in team slightly since you get it only from activities you do (teammate AI kills doesnt grant you bonus). Or at least it seems to me it's working that way.
---
I'm sure once the mode actually comes out we'll get them
---
Ok i can see that some icons are now unlocked, but they could do something more special cuz like how am i supposed to know what i’ve unlocked
---
Thanks, I appreciate all the info; been try to find out more about that jumpsuit ever since seeing and then getting it from somewhere that shares the rare event loot table.
---
I think what makes this one special is that they genuinely did a good job giving it such a classic fallout story to tie it all together. The ring of fire is also wonderful, much more terrifying and realistic than a laser wall or bomb field.
---
Or just offer chat... Like every game ever...
---
Indeed. It still is unacceptable that it launched at this state but they are working on it.
---
Yeah. I think they just took the time to place some spawnpoints for the lootcrates on this area for now.
---
I am terrible at it and yeah, it's actually really fun
---
Thankfully, I live in Australia, so... There is literally always room for dispute here
---
I feel like it might open in adventure/survival when the mode goes full release
---
Oh. Now I have no clue, that’s weird. Maybe there is a glitch where if one person shoots someone elses grenade, either only the grenade thrower sees the damage, or both see the damage?
---
Two Shot Explosive weapons suck at PvP most of the time. Bad aim and damage mitigated by fireproof+dense.
---
With proper build and relevant game knowledge, survival is awesome too.
---
There’s one in the bar too c:
---
A records screen would be cool, with like most kills in one game etc
---
You give me hope 😁. Time for me to leave vats alone in adventure mode
---
Yeah, no text chat is IMHO heavily detrimental. So either that or a ping system akin to Apex Legends would be really nice.
---
Hey man, no worries, babies have been made in less than 47secs! Keep practicing maybe you get to last a minute like us minutemen! 👍
---
Just please don’t tell them to put it in the shop ;( thanks for all that you do
---
9/10 no its not worth it, but I still do it as selling the rubbish legendarys to a vendor is pointless as it's so easy to farm some mutants for weapons to sell.
---
Plus who doesn't like a gamble?
---
Try to stick to cover most of the time and pick your fights. You might be dying quick because you pick a fight with a guy not realising his three teammates are nearby and looking right at you
---
Nuclear winter hasn't actually released yet, this is just a prebeta sneak peak.
---
Agreed. It is confusing.
---
Or no ping systems and just implement chat..you konw.. Like every game ever. I play on pc and less then 1 in 100 ppl uses a mic.
---
Bump, idk why this post is not appearing on the subreddits list of posts :/
---
I've easily killed an PA user with the .50 machinegun.
---
ok, thank you!
---
and i thought so too, but it turned down the reason he was confused was because he was already gone, and didn't notice the enemies
---
There is a similar outfit called Field Scribe Outfit
---
Oh, tinkerer is for ammo and bulking your junk, mostly. Bulking your junk helps to reduce its weight and also you can sell it to vendors that way. But it takes plastic to bulk something.
---
No it's not .At least for me
---
Wifi warrior?
---
Not been my experience at all.
---
I just had someone tell me they were looking for the “red one” and then said there were 4 diff ones
---
Text chat can still be very situational. You can't really chat during a firefight, whereas with a ping system you can communicate without compromising your combat capability too much.
---
Like I said, either will do. Both would be great.
---
Stop camping. Actually try to be aggressive,   Btw it’s easy to see that Vault 76 suit in bushes.
---
I am stuck at 7/8 and looking for Automatron as well. I have seen other players with it in their inventory. Also, they're not necessarily random. Grognak the Barbarian is a guaranteed spawn at Grafton Dam. Just server hop, if need be, but it's there.
---
Same, I was at 60 something gig, then went to 60/18, then [this](https://i.imgur.com/Y3soNJW.png), then [this](https://i.imgur.com/lGyaF21.png). I restarted pc and launcher nothing seems to have helped, the fo76 folder doesnt increase in size either, idk wtf it is downloading or where.
---
Really? I tried and my character sat down and stared at the machine.
---
I found it, thank you
---
Why you people like this? I made it clear im not interested yet some comments still trying to shove me BR
---
Really? I tried and my character sat and stared at the machine.
---
The answer to your question is no. Todd said it’s more fun with friends. Now go into the waste and make some friends.
---
Looks like it. I've just emptied my adventure inventory from any water, played few NW rounds, went back to Adv and I have 24 purified waters  in my inventory.
---
Still "ongoing"
---
Yes you can. Voice is faster but chat is more clear. You may be new to gaming with randoms but chat is always an option and my best team mates are silent.
---
it's kinda funny that I agree with you and OP wholeheartedly. why is that?
---
Bad things were exaggerated while good things were downplayed.
---
At times it looked to be a combined planned roast of Bethesda.
---
Fuck the haters, don’t like it don’t play it.
---
Might try that, ty
---
I collect everything haha. I always feel like it could have some use at some point in the future. Loaded up a stash box with loot yesterday. If I put a load of items in a stash box, I can collect it from any box, right? 
---
Say I add a load of bottles, desk fans and plates into one, and a load of weapons I've found into another, I can collect all of it at a 3rd place?
---
Same with me. I played it a day yesterday after disregarding it as something I probably wouldn't like. Boy was I wrong
---
Apex is free to play? Hmm...
---
Now we have damage numbers it's going to make testing these things much easier :)
---
Woah great smart original comment!
---
are thry referring to the science scribe snd engineer outfits?
---
so in adventure mode, we all bite the bullet and drop vats,tse's,mutations etc ie ,remove easy peasy,i'm god. then even adventure mode becomes WAY better.
---
I have not yet played BR as yet, thought i'd let the dust settle down, but been following these posts, waiting for the screams. Surprisingly few, I have a sneaky suspision, that they dont want to admit, that they fell on their arses.
---
however, ramp up adventure mode a good couple of notches outwith the training areas.
---
I was on this server still watching after getting KO'd.  Thanks for the good laugh!
---
I wasn't using VATS in first place because of heavy PA build I'm running, however now I have to get used to lighter rifle builds in NW...
---
I agree, the game suffers greatly from sub-par optimization, not only on consoles, but on PC as well. I logged back in today after the update only to have my settings switched to "very low" and having everything look horrible. There are tons of games that are much prettier that run on my pc without issues. I really hope Beth gets around to rebuilding the graphics engine for performance, rather than god rays that shine through the ground.
---
I agree it was justified. But it was very playable.
---
I've already read every terminal I could get my hands on so far.
---
Lol it's not near as bad as apex. I can actually get kills in this one.
---
Cherry picking ✔
---
Never played the game ✔
---
Sorry not sorry✔
---
Never gonna play✔
---
Took the time to post a random opinion on a fo76 sub ✔
---
It all checks out 💯
---
Keep practicing
---
Too much content!!! Must load fo4 again to sit in wasteland board to tears!
---
If you have a full team with mics,  you are at a huge advantage.   I’ve gotten a few wins with randoms.  But communication is key.
---
**TURN ON YOUR GODDAMN MICROPHONES**! We need to **communicate** so that we can **win** the video game.
---
In my opinion the xo1 is the best. I mainly use PA for nuke zones and I think it's got the best rad resistance.
---
Sniping is awesome. That's where I get the most kills.. 308
---
Dont be rushed. Its an rpg.. Unlike that last trash you played. You set the pace. And hide things you dont have intrest in.
---
I haven't tried it yet but I figured the no vats thing would be pretty good in pvp.
---
Do it. De-select then in your pip boy. The you won’t see them (unless you inadvertently complete them). I agree I don’t want to see them all so I hide most of them and wander around looking for wolves to mug.
---
It is no crazy jumping stealthboy crit spam
---
I can't stand these "TSE are so powerful" statements anymore. People like OP need to play the game more rather than reading reddit and the TSE conspiracy. 
---
TSE are so 90s. It's like saying a Walkman has the best audio quality.
---
No idea. They just asked if I had the brotherhood scribe outfit and when i said yes, they asked “the red one?”  So I’m not sure what they’re talking about
---
And mutations. Lol. Pumped to try it out
---
The Field Scribe Outfit is red themed
---
Perhaps it was too early to note this, from the downvotes this has been taken as bashing, rather than concern about longevity and the lifeblood (new players) of a gamemode, along with the questionable descision to gate the story behind an increasingly and extremely high level within the mode. Would it hurt to allow anyone in the 'lobby' (which I assume won't be only accessable in two-minute intervals in the full release) to explore the lore and listen to the holotapes if they so wished, and IF they felt like playing NW itself they could? Again, gating it behind success and extreme levels of progress limits the less able players of the game to access the story outside Wikia.
---
As for the modes, perhaps a tier system? Level 1-10 get paired. 20-40. 50-100. Top-Scores vs Top Scorers. Throwing everyone into a blender is just asking for tears long term in my opinions. Or the mode to just be ignored if it gets too frustrating to advance. 
---
Ironically I could level up while catching up on my tv-shows. If you find a nice big bush in the 'safe' zones and AFK in it people will walk right past you. It happened to me multiple times while I had to handle a phonecall. I saw them and heard the footsteps but they never noticed me. You get 200xp+ for duration survived.
---
They gave you a valid opinion and reasoning for why you might like this BR even if you don’t like other ones. 
---
At the end of the day if you make a post asking for people’s opinions because you’re unable to have your own, don’t complain when they give you these opinions
---
You only get rewards from increasing your overseer's rank. But you'll get more exp for a win. 
---
Open your pip boy next time you're waiting in the vault, you might have some perk card packs to open
---
Next month apparently
---
Or just wave as you pass them. Most people are nice.
---
Yeah, I've been one shot with a .44 while in power armor, through a wall at the Responders sign up location in a couple matches. I also got shot while on the bridge by the Creamery with no one visibly around.
---
There's an option that makes you join a team (or solo).When in the mode menu, try hovering over NW and it should display it below the menu frame.
---
It has a grouping  feature.
---
To further your sim theory I've noticed the players in the vault have an almost holographic sheen to them. Look closely and you can almost see matrix code scrolling down some faces in certain lights
---
Huh weird
---
Awe but next week is my birthday, June the 18th. I don't see why they couldn't just keep this one map considering also there are a bunch of new people who are playing just for this game mode. If they go out and buy the game to play it then why give them a reason to wait?
---
Do you just mean a sort of flag for your friends list that shows you want to join a team?
---
What’s in the overseers room once you get to level 10?
---
I have no idea what everyone is using. Your SPECIAL stats have no impact on gameplay outside of allowing you to equip perk cards. I can say there appears to be 3 main hot spots. Heveltia, Camp McClintock, and Sutton.
---
Got some nukashine to share? lol
---
I'm on xbox and my mix will stop regersting every few matches which requires me to restart the whole game.
---
Have not had this issue in 4-5 hours worth of play.
---
Sounds like it's your internet, try a wired connection if you can.
---
Missing the old tune and video, it was charging me to play, evoking so many cool places with that nostalgia tune.  
---
This one doesn't make me want to play adventure mode
---
And perks.
---
I'm sorry , there was no quest line?
---
The game had non human npcs, Wastelanders is adding dialogue choice and nee story elements, but the main quest was there. You'd know that if you tried it and didn't just regurgitate what you see on YouTube.
---
I hope for the final release they will also include a BR that takes place in the full map.
---
I have to admit i expected battle royale and barring battlefield 1 i have never enjoyed it but reading this has convinced me to give it a go. Regardless i still have adventure mode.
---
if you make a major change to a video setting you need to restart the game.
---
New player here, thanks for the welcome.
---
Not fancy to write everything again, but:

---
So, see you in Appalachia. Ready to slay some radstags, ghouls, or just hang out with some homebrew...
---
In the main menu, select Social, then invite a friend, this was not possible until now, then select play with a team and chose your prefered mode.
---
I have no idea, im on xbox tho.
---
But it's that way with all other plans and perks in the game? My alt doesn't start knowing marsupial serum just because my main does. Not sure why this mode would be different?
---
Sounds sweaty ...
---
Really? LOL WTF, I used them often XDD
---
This mode next text chat ASAP, (adventure needing it too) there is no BR game without text chat. Also, emotes need to be hidden
---
I remember this as well! They were one of my main sources of nuclear material, early on!
---
I am having a discussion about this right now. I’m level 299 and it seems like the higher I get in level the more hostile people are to me.

---
Dumped hard bargain and excess charisma points, and put them in perception and maxed rifleman. Just switch out lone wanderer while shopping/selling, its what i do and it takes just a couple of seconds. Likewise with ammosmith and super duper when crafting ammo.
---
Perhaps add electically charged and carnivore for extra spice.
---
Funny, i just fiddled around with a similar thought today.
---
I genuinely thought I was going to hate it.  And I hate that I actually LOVE it.  I haven’t laughed that hard in so long playing it last night.  I AM CONVERTED PRAISE LORD AND SAVIOR TODD.
---
I've been using a sub-machine gun in Adventure mode for the past week, it's pretty fun.
---
You can fast travel 
---
But did you have power armour somewhere before you logged off?
---
Congratulations in advance!
---
The issue is that they tried applying a PVE system to PVP. The issue isnt legendary items and weapons - it's anti armour.
---
The reason people blow you up so quick in Power armor? its due to anti armor.
---
anti amor means that DR = nothing, thats the root of the issues in PVP. combine that with the player damage it's just set out to not translate well to a PVP system that was added at a later time. the NW system is a nice workaround to eliminate the issues, but it really doesnt address the balance problems in survival for example.
---
Maybe them revealing the sheepyeti.
---
Use the favorites wheel. It's so much quicker once you get used to using that by default. 
---
In normal adventure mode people rarely use favorites but in NW, it's kinda necessary to adjust to the combat
---
This is why I stopped playing online games on my ps4. E. S. O. Was fun but not for what I had to pay to play it on the PS +
---
I haven’t gotten anywhere near that level so I can’t comment but it’s a shame you’ve had that
---
They are not limited that way.
---
I absolutely want everyone to come play the game  100%
---
Can confirm. Got told to level up in adventure mode and nothing carried over.
---
I did fast travel, was still stuck lol and no I don’t think I did
---
Silly person.
---
Pretty sure they plan on letting you do that eventually once NW is out of its beta... But maybe not, might stay locked like 76 is.
---
got the impression, that the free FALLOUT TRIAL was for a week, but BR would remain for those who already have the game ?
---
Tadpole ones are all complete worthy.  Chemist and Musician are still bugged and it’s all I have left and it’s driving me crazy.
---
Ok weird but did you get in power armour during any game play?
---
Yeesh man that's a bit intense in terms of time, why did you get banned?
---
Golden
---
His name is Braun. He was the scientist in Fallout 3 who you met in the LifeSim pods.
---
But there can be only one Overseer, can't there? So presumably the team has to fight it out at some point. Is that right?
---
That's hilarious
---
Yeah same, I don't like Battle Royal games at all (and I suck at them to add to that negative opinion) but I played Nuclear Winter and even tho I still suck, I don't hate it, I actually kinda like it.
---
I agree with your post. It’s so tough getting people to try this game. I’ve been like annoying my friends to download the trial. They’re like no that game sucks(they read that on the internet) I’m like this is the best game you’ve never played. Give it a try it’s free.     And the new mode wasn’t wanted and man people love it! Just like other will if they would just try the game!
---
See a doctor?
---
Oh ya, I think I had it in my stash
---
I hope so. I don't see the point in taking it away considering it's already patched in the game.
---
I don't hate it. But it would have been better if there was something non pvp based.
---
I don’t believe I’m making any apologies for the game. I’m praising it for what it is and HAS been instead of reiterating what some mean YouTube man said because easy clickbait revenue. 
---
I can form my own opinions based on hours of my own gameplay instead of watching/ listening to someone else on the internet. 
---
You DONT have to scour the subreddit seven months after release if you’re still mad about how this game failed your expectations at launch.
---
But all the rewards except perk cards go for all characters. Im not sure if theres anything in the locked rooms that is character specific, but i would doubt it.
---
That may be it there is a lot of glitches in this game
---
That’s almost where my camp is. I’ve rebuilt mine and it’s pretty big now. It has 3 Brahmin right next to it so that was a bonus. Yeah it’s the lights that’s taking all my budget but I really need them
---
Yeah, but we’re gonna get that too, so there’s that!
---
Oh ok thank you!
---
I think everyone’s still a little nervous haha
---
Yeah, the backlash is definitely deserved. Even Todd seemed surprised people stuck with the game after his lies. And he knows he can keep milking the few fans that have stayed behind now  with appreciation posts like this. After all the bad decisions he has made people still lap up the shit if he tells them it's chocolate.
---
I’m not even kidding. I woke up a little early today so I jumped on to do a little shopping. I tend to find good deals in the early hours of the day. And I wasn’t on for more then 45 minutes and was attacked by two players on different servers.
---
It made me realize so quickly how scared I am of everything hahah.  “OMG A NAME FLASHED WHAT DO WE DO!”  The best is to have everyone in your team pick a different spot and meet in the middle (whoever survives 🤣).  We won twice so far with that method.  I don’t recommend it haha.
---
Yea and I'm excited for that part. But while I wait I guess I've got this still.
---
There aren’t plans for the crops. You have to pick the crops somewhere in the world in order to be able to plant. 
---
Travel to some of the farms to find most of it. 
---
Good luck!
---
You can check your inventory in you armour and outfits you might see power armour chassis
---
Used to get nuclear waste from them all the time in the beta
---
No its BR with compass markers. Not stoked on it at all. But free weekenders and survival players who spwan camp are lovin it.
---
Maybe im just Too ridged in how my competition games go. It eased up the hunt for scoreboard players in survival so ill take that as a win.
---
Try using a Receiver that has Critical in its description, like Calibrated (Superior Critical), or Severe (Improves Damage and Critical).
---
Thatsssss not the games fault. That’s an issue with internet/hardware.
---
they all have different stats not a big PA user myself but i have the x0-1 or excavator on me at all times.
---
P8ck them up and you should be able to plant them. I can't plant pumpkins yet tho
---
I understand the hate for a BR in this game. No point in bitching about it tho. Don't like it? Don't play.
---
Great info thank you!
---
More options for players in a game, especially options it seems many people do like, allows for more copies of the game to get sold which means more money for developers to add to the mode that you DO like. 
---
You're having a temper tantrum at the buffet cause they brought more turkey while you're waiting on crab legs. It's coming son, it's coming. Other people eat too.
---
yup loads on ps4 last night. bethesda got it right, when they dropped pvp from ad/mode, noticed more and more players coming onto the game since. A weeks free trial has certainly boosted that. they should do this on a regular basis.
---
If I click on my friends name in social my only options are “mute”, “block for session” and “report player”?
---
I dont know hes still there lol. I know he *was* there and i know he is nowhere else to be seen, so its safe to assume he is still there
---
You get to plant them just by having them in your inventory and having fert. You can't plant pumpkins atm tho.
---
3 wins last night. Having a blast!
---
But it waits for every played to load. And you start invisible
---
Oh you totally have to hide the ones that you aren’t working on. I leave 1 most of the time up. 2 max. Any more than that and I go insane.  My gf leaves them all up and half her screen is yellow text and I bug out just looking at it hahaha.
---
In apex I had a guy use text to chat just to call me a bitch the entire game.
---
ini files are working, thank Todd
---
agreed.
---
Haven't tried it out, however lore-wise this is the only game where I feel like a BR mode even makes sense. I'm actually fairly impressed with the whole idea (I know they are late to the BR-fad, but it's actually done really neat from what I've seen). Can't wait to try it out later this week.
---
Camp McClinTilly
---
And that is why I have my CAMP there. Home Sweet Home!
---
wish I could say the same, as I really want to play through the story.  after months of not playing I had last week off.  I tried 3 times.  
---
First day some lv226 dude in power armor ran into my base and started trying to shoot everything (I am level 15, btw.. not even 1/10th his level), I logged before he killed me or ruined my base    
---
Day 2? trying to do the quests it sent me to an area with level 65+ ghouls.. ya again im 15, i got destroyed.   
---
So third day I decided to try one last time.. got sent on a different quest, heading to that area a giant level 50 scorched dragon pops up from the road and slaughters me.  ya,  not fun and I think I finally give up.  hopefully I can find a wiki with a good writeup of the story.
---
I'm glad we finally have balanced pvp
---
I have quite a lot of the "antique lights." The candles and the lanterns that don't need power. I could be wrong but they seem to take up less of the budget than the other lights.
---
Ty
---
my thoughts, maybe this is a new player,hard to tell from post,
---
thought I would mention just in case its another limited time like the robot parade
---
I actually got two kills this morning!
---
I won’t say that I love it but I like it much more than I thought. It feels like a change of pace and if I get too frustrated I can pop back into standard mode and become a god of Appalachia again.
---
Yes they will be living in the crashed space station in the toxic valley. Hopefully Rose recruits a few so we can visit her and her gang every now and then.
---
&gt; Because we all know you can totally kill people with pacifist mode on Adventure, right?
---
Pacifist mode isn't meant to prevent you from being killed, pacifist mode prevents you from damaging another player, and hence possibly initiating PvP with them.
---
There are two ways you can get into PvP with another player in Adventure:
---
1. You have a public workshop and someone tries to take it from you.  This is very rare.
---
2. You, or a team-mate of yours,^* attacks another player with pacifist mode *off* and the other player retaliates.
---
Since you *can* kill people in adventure mode I can't see how Todd was lying when he, correctly, observed that most people don't try to.
---
(* And that is just about the only way you can enter PvP without being warned -- some evildoer tricks you into joining a team, then conspires with a friend to start PvP then the friend attacks you.  This can happen but it is rare).

It’s a crumby thing yes. But not fallouts fault.  You must pay PlayStation to gain access to online games
---
I know we can go into the challenges to see what's ahead in the next rank, but I think we should have an overseer screen like we get at the end of the match to quickly glance at the rank/rewards.
---
Was just about to hit buy... Can’t see any other info RE taking under armor in though
---
I kinda like it too, also love that we can get caps and xp for adventure mode!
---
Im pretty sure i got a level 50 pack.
---
It's a sneak peak but honestly it wouldn't make sense to take it away. So I'd like some clarification if we get to keep it or not and if not we should try to get them to reconsider.
---
Nice to see some progress to this game. Maybe - one day - they will exchange the old af engine with a good one.
---
&gt; Im angry because of the lies.
---
Nah, you're angry because you're a sheep.  You are offended that some people like something you don't, so that makes you angry.
---
They do not
---
I don’t fully understand it .... what are the benefits to adventure mode?
---
I’ve got every light there is, signs, glitter balls, chandeliers and lots of the the Mr Pebbles lights. I’m at the limit now but I need more.
---
If it's so bad why are you wasting time in r/FO76?
---
then why not say
---
&gt; We made 73 new perk cards exclusive to Nuclear Winter.
---
? It makes no sense.
---
Posters in the train stations should spark some new quests.  Or even in some peoples camps.  I have all my quest posters up in a row.
---
Yes! This happens to me every time I try to exit a server in adventure mode too. But it’s even more annoying in nuclear winter! I’ve never left a game without an unknown server error.
---
I thought it was going to be a hot mess.  I cant stand fortnite or any BR games I have tried.  Pleasantly surprised by this.
---
Nuclear Winter's pvp is actually fun!
---
We'll have to wait for the full release, this is just a taste, the full nuclear winter expansion still hasn't come up
---
and farm them ticks.
---
There is a flag icon that shows where the circle is.
---
I'm glad. I wasn't sure if Bethesda prepared for this. Then it said stalemate.
---
I wanted to dislike, but can't really bring myself to do it. It's decently balanced and the cap and xp rewards make it a decent break from the main game.
---
Hahahaha. Well. We may have found the problem. I love camps at night with heaps of lights!
---
I kept reading this as nuka world haha
---
Survival is still in Beta. Doesn't inspire confidence.
---
Good. Games SHOULD develop and evolve. I loved fo and fo2 when they came out, tactics less so because it was just trying to capitalize on the syndicate buzz at the time. 
---
When 3 came out it was a great refresh to the franchise and I know I'm not alone in believing that it was a better option than just another isometric which by that point had died out and felt clunky. NV got released as an absolute unplayable bugfest but introduced a lot more choices than we had in 3 and so people loved it and then they brought building and workshops into 4, again some people didn't like the new features but many loved it. 
---
Fallout as a franchise since it was created has existed in many forms and 76 isn't going to change that now any more than smash Bros means they'd never have another Mario game.  
---
Just let people have their fun even if it isn't the fun you want to be having. There will be something for you most likely down the line and if not, I'm sure you'll find something else to fill your time.
---
I cant speak for others, but I know I won't play it again not because I know it will be bad, but out of principle. Even if it becomes the perfect Fallout game, this isnt about the game being bad. It's about allowing this to happen again in the future. By playing we show that "Its okay to s**t in our hands as long as you clean up a little bit over half a year later."
---
Omfg this.
---
The progression is nice, other BR games seem like too much of a grind
---
I know that I have maybe too many. But when I run to my camp in the dark it looks like there’s a party going on.
---
Man I'm sure glad mass effect didnt have to patch in its psionics. Or that skyrim didnt have to add in dragons months later because they needed to go on the 'roadmap'. 
---
It's not regurgitation. You're going through denial. Anyone with a pair of functioning eyes can see the game is and was a desperate cash grab and disaster.
---
I have finished adventure mode with 2 characters, so i haven't touched fo76 for months, but nuclear winter entertained me yesterday pretty well!
---
I’d agree with you, except they also awkwardly shoved the legendary system into Fallout 4. A game that never needed it.
---
One hundred percent this. I'm a lore guy, and my main characters are generally benevolent and not into death matches for reward, so on both fronts I don't particularly want to have to grind to Overseer 100+ just to read a few terminals and listen to a few holotapes. Hell, I'm getting 'old' as far as twitch reflexes go, and I don't spend much time playing FPS games outside lazily sniping predictable NPCs in Fallout games. More than once I've gotten the jump on someone, using an automatic rifle, and even with short controlled bursts and that advantage the whipper snappers often manage to kick my ass anyway. And that's fine. Not everything is for everyone, but does the story have to be gated behind laser walls?!
---
Cool, I didn’t realize that I’ll have to try it
---
It is just as you described and it shouldn't be as you described. I wont be paying another 40k for camp plans for new characters, and I'd love to build a fancy camp on each of those toons. Unfortunately, not possible, and its a design choice I'd love to see changed.
---
Sounds like they're definitely asking about the Field Scribe Outfit. I have a spare one if you're on PC?
---
I fell of a cliff after about 10 seconds.  *Not* an impressive start.
---
This is gonna be awesome
---
Yeah. VATS seems to run tighter. Run and shoot is a lot more fluid. Beware...it breaks Gun Fu.
---
Well as fun as NW is it tends to attract the Fortnite crowd
---
I thought you were gonna say because you can’t get access to the best areas until you’re levelled up.
---
How could I have possibly personally enjoyed it right?
---
I'd rather vote for an option to play alone on a server...
---
Does it say downloading or installing? I know the first install takes a while. If it still says downloading, I'd check your connection.  There might be the last few MB or kB that it hasn't downloaded yet
---
Jew Punch? Woah didn't know that Krav Maga is a Fallout Perk now. 
---
Everyday something new...
---
lmao
---
happened to me too but it completed after a few mbs downloaded
---
Nope
---
Crates, adventure xp and caps, perks for NW and maybe when the mode is completely released, the vault 51 will have more for us. Because when you level up it actually tells you to go to adventure mode for something.
---
Pacifist mode helps out from other players and if you get other players with you, then you will survive but I also hide from the scorch beast or run from them. Don't give up so easily.
---
Survival is a completely different type of playstyle and player. Survival is for those minmax kids that are willing to grind for three weeks or more just to get an armor set they want. I don't have that type of time or dedication. 
---
So I'll die and lose some junk and aid hopping onto survival for a few minutes to get the weekly weapon (because somehow I always think it's not worth the time to rearrange everything in my stash) and end up getting trolled and pissed for about 15 min... Then I don't care anymore, go about my life back in adventure mode. 
---
Having survival mode like it is keeps those players off adventure mode more and things have only gotten better and less annoying there since. 
---
So as far as I'm concerned, let it stay broken and OP and I'll just keep to Adventure and NW and let them do their own thing.
---
Logical assumption, but kinda weakens the point of buying stuff in the store.
---
Also would like to favourite an under-armor skin for use in NW also instead of the blue-tastic vault suit but not an option. Hopefully they fix that before the official launch.
---
I’m on Xbox, but thanks!
---
I think they should more than throw the capacity. Yes I understand that the reason it's so small is to keep server performance, but I mean as I goal. 
---
I think the amount they should aim for is... 76.
---
Hacker is definitely worth it, the one game I found 2 terminals hacked them both, requested weapons and they automatically added to my inventory (I thought it was gonna be an airdrop, but this was way better) it was guns like an automatic grenade launcher, I was surprised. The other terminal I requested aid, and got stimpacks, definitely gonna keep that perk.
---
Well, there's always been perks in one form or another throughout the series.
---
This. If that's all we ever see of it then chances are most people will read and listen to the lore on Wikia instead, where they aren't being cut off and all sorts of annoyances like being punched by a clown.
---
Yeah. Someone contacted Bethesda earlier. They are looking into it. Its been working with pistols for me. No others though.
---
You shouldn't make grand and all encompassing statements from your opinions perhaps.  Everyone has their own opinions, and that's good.  I voted with my wallet this time around, and I am not unhappy with that decision.  Not based on YouTube clickbaits, or blind fanboy hivemind.  
---
You may have interpreted this as a slight against you, but perhaps you missed the bit about E3.  They hyped a game last year, and hyped it hard, and it came out of the gate lackluster at best.  This year, they owned up to the, ahem, fallout for rushing it. Am I glad that folks are enjoying it?  Sure.  I have friends who play it and say it's leaps and bounds better than it was.  It just isn't my idea of a game I'd purchase.
---
You DON'T get to put imaginary words into other people's mouths.
---
It says downloading it was originaly downloading 50 something GB now it says 23 that's why I'm waiting in case it's still downloading those 30 extra GB and it's just the UI that is bugged.
---
Cant even dab on them hoes :(
---
Couldn't agree more , thanks Bethesda for listening to the people.
---
Amazing.
---
I think I’ll focus on it for a week or 2 as my main, just to try and get max overseer level, which I’m not sure what the max level is.
---
It’s because reasonable people are able to hold contradictory opinions without having to choose one or the other to wrap their identity around. 
---
It’s rare on the internet, so great job!
---
 I noticed this in the patch notes (Combat Improvements section) and thought it might affect this perk card

##### REACT MORE QUICKLY
---
* Drawing and Holstering: Many weapons can now be fired to cancel their drawing and holstering animations.
---
* Pistols: Now more quickly enter iron sights.
---
* Scoped Weapons: Now transition to their scopes much more quickly.
---
* Sprint: Can now be used immediately after firing a ranged weapon.
---
* Sprint: Can now be used to cancel reload animations.
---
* **V.A.T.S.: Now closes immediately when one of your attacks kills the targeted enemy.**
---
That’s just physical glitching that been in the game for a while, but I like the theory haha
---
And no one is going to make you, but it's that way in single player FO too. 
---
You only have what that particular character has earned. It's pretty much that way in most games as far as "earned" or "purchased" items. 
---
Rolling a new character is always an option, and you'd keep anything you purchased in Atomic shop, that is per account, but stuff you get in game will likely always be per character.
---
You know, this is really funny cause when I first started playing this game, fresh out of the vault, about a month back, I had a player give me a bunch of items, one of them being Nukashine, I cherished all the items the player gave me because it was so thoughtful of him/her to help me out, even went as far as to keep the Nukashine a symbol of... hope in humanity. Didn't realize I was getting roofie'd til just a couple days ago.
---
I'm on it everyday. Can't tear myself away from it at times.
---
Honestly I don't know when I will stop playing.
---
I never said that. You might have enjoyed it, you're more than welcome to. I like my share of bad games, you'd just be objectively wrong to claim its anything else. This was a game designed with no love, no meaningful goal, no honesty. It was made to milk money from people that love Bethesda and abuse their goodwill, and that's what it does. Their paltry attempts to salvage their reputation by making it actually approach a state of playability is simply salt on the wound.
---
You are invisible for a short while or until you interact with something as far as I can tell.
---
Um, did you not pay attention to E3? All the news about Wayland's shows that there's gonna be raiders vs sellers, and we pick sides
---
they seriously need to included OP weapons and armor sets. ;)
---
I believe it's also related to simulations. It's the only theory that makes sense and explains everything.
---
Yea I was being an ass...
---
And I disagree with you completely. Good day.
---
Maybe he's Batman. A shadowy figure that rides the thin line between hero and criminal. 
---
He swooped in and saved us from a duping ring, confiscated their illicit wares, and now he is being blamed.
---
Thank you for your heroic service. Your ban-sacrifice will serve as a reminder to the entire Reddit FO76 community that there is someone protecting us. As well as a warning to evildoers everywhere.
---
Well, I had a 3* mob drop 3* wood armor for the first time last night, so that is new, and it confirms the wood armor change was not for the Purveyor alone.
---
I'm in the same boat. I asked specifically about junk. What are you trying to sell?
---
&gt; The reason people blow you up so quick in Power armor? its due to anti armor.
---
Nah. Most pvper's worth their salt don't use ballistic weapons. Also with the way DR works, a good build can smash through it without AA. My Heavy weapons toon has a harpoon gun that can deal upwards of 1500 damage, add in vats crit + a sneak attack = your DR didn't affect my damage anyway. My rifle toon has the same shit except it's a dragon. I can 1 shot anyone I want provided they don't know I'm there and their assassins/sent armor didn't all proc at once.
---
This. There's a lot of lore, holotapes, and other rewards I'd like to take a look at without feeling I have to rush because of the deployment counter.
---
I would think not... I would hope not
---
u/LadyDevann u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
 The below update is affecting the GunFu perk card
---
**V.A.T.S.:** Now closes immediately when one of your attacks kills the targeted enemy.
---
This has to be a bug or something right? never had an update go over 7 gbs
---
Quite possible. They should look into that.
---
same here
---
Made a post on this issue last night. I’m afraid that BR content will take priority over Adventure mode and the wrong sort will flood the community that has organically become one of the most helping on Xbox live in 2019. BR communities are as toxic as they come, we’ve seen it all in the last 2 years. Would be a shame for the game to absolutely flip directions just to save the title and erase the awful start Bethesda had (which at this point as been nearly redeemed by simply improving Adventure gameplay).
---
If it’s anything like xbone you only need one account paying the subscription per console for all accounts to use online play. That could be it?
---
Well, need to say I went to bed so much later yesterday. And yes, I though it will be something I will experience just in case of daily make me. I was wrong. I had lot of fun. It may sound rough, but thrill when guy jump you from behind, you  run out of ammo and then just finish him with hatchet .. you need to experience this to understand. I was doomed with his teamates on one side and firewall on another, but I took him with me. Unfortunately as people will learn more, it will become less fun. Coordinated sniper team is no fun to face. But... maybe I am wrong, as I was before release :)
---
This was my attitude. Then I came to realize that BR gives more casual players like me a way to PvP since it creates an even playing field regardless of level or equipment.
---
They removed the weapon shortcuts on PC ?
---
broken the GunFu perk
---
when in adventure/survival I think
---
As someone who loved BR game modes and loathed FO76 on launch and only just recently found a new lease of life in it. I love this game mode. It functions, the gameplay style of fallout fits very well into the game mode and the looting is very good for the style of play. Good job bethesda.
---
The only criticism, TPP and FPP servers. I found a slight advantage on the game when I was playing in third person it almost felt unfair being able to sneak round corners and take out an enemy before they've had time to react. Would be a welcome change, but overall it's a fun little time waster and a nice change of pace to the adventure mode.
---
This is gold right here
---
In the real world you would wear your armor over clothing, and having it over in this mode would give you an unfair advantage
---
My biggest issue? Myself. I gotta re-train my brain that just about EVERY weapon is viable.
---
So basically hope there is no one super high level around otherwise my game experience is ruined cause I can barely damage those enemies
---
Oh yeah, I forgot about the zombies.
---
Yes. And there is a stashbox at every Red rocket, player's camps and some locations spread in the world. Think of them like opening a worm hole directly to your stash.
---
Most of us thought that we were robbing other players when found these stashes in the world.
---
Tip: don't stash weapon or armor around your level, unless it is way better than yours. Scrapping them yields mods, which will make yours better.
---
If you join a random team I’d say no.  This creates unbalanced where only high level overseers will play together and kick lovelies off.    
---
But.   If you join a team of friends, then you have options. And I say yes.
---
My favorite spot to spawn is the light house right by the border
---
I just hope they add a proper solo mode for it. I hope they don't think just because Apex is only squad that it's a good idea. Apex has characters built from the ground up to work together, NW doesn't.
---
they are not crates, they are stash skins.
---
You start getting icons rank 4 through 8, then 9 is a picture frame for photo mode.  10 looks like a buildable overseer chair for camp and 11 looks like a fancy pistol/revolver
---
I don’t why the fuck people would quit if they added a BR. It makes no fucking sense just don’t play it if you don’t want to. Me personally, I enjoy it better than any other. It’s very different and unique.
---
Cue surrounding a vending machine with traps or putting it on a cliffside.
---
Some more tactical areas like the water park or for a real twist inside a silo
---
Small crate is a player icon. Small supply crate is a stashbox buildable in your camp.
---
They're stash skins.
---
they did quit.....quit adventure to play the battle royale mode :P
---
If you’ve played WoW, or any MMO for that matters, you’ll remember that PvE and PvP are not balanced in the same way. They’re two completely different style of play.
---
I think this is the BR beta. There are things that they want to tweak once they actually see how it works. But I still think it would be nice if they kept it around since it is a new game mode, and to me send like a really fun way to level up a new character and gain caps
---
only play pacifist mode.  this is almost always what drives me away.  The times before last week i was: killed by 2 guys with exploding bullet chain guns (in pacifist mode), had a lv160ish guy come take a junkyard i claimed (noone was even near it when I started), and it goes on like that.
---
i sneak everywhere hoping it hides me from the main map so people will leave me alone to play.. never seems to work.  
---
Im not giving up after 3 bad experiences, almost every time I've tried to play its ended up this way.  i mean ibe had the gsme since nov, and im still lv15...
---
I had the F04 music played at my wedding.  That song still gets me fired up!
---
i was ok with the idea, not my thing. I did played it last night and it was fun as hell, after this week its going to suck to go to normal adventure or PvP
---
&gt; If the legendary items negatively impact the balance of combat (which I definitely think they do)
---
Yeah but I think they don't. I love what they do to this game. Maybe that's an unpopular opinion, but I really enjoy grinding for good gear. It's the same basic end game premise as games like PoE and Diablo. It's a rush to get that lucky god roll... unfortunately it was on a rolling pin, time to farm some more!
---
Some of you don't like the grind and I get that, but honestly, you don't need to grind for the best gear to be good enough to down any content easily. I was killing lvl 80 scorchbeasts with a stock .50 cals in seconds before I had a bloodied one. Good news though, there is quite a bit of content to play and if you don't like legendaries, you can opt out of using them. You can viably kill anything with non-legendary weapons except perhaps the SBQ, and even then you probably can with the right builds.
---
It's called  **Dialectical thinking,** it's sadly an uncommon ability.
---
Just put me inside vault 69 and I’ll be fine
---
Oh, well then thank you for your replies because I was thinking about that XD
---
I actually timed this yesterday. From the moment I hit the "quit" button to the spawn point in my next match was 5 min, 45 sec. The game itself didn't last that long. So I definitely agree something needs to speed up this process. I'm wondering if it's like this only because the mode is "pre-beta".
---
You didn't happen to be wearing Power Armor, were you?
---
I never planned on quiting.. I wasnt a fan of the idea of BR but I had to see how they did it... and they did it RIGHT!!! This was a msg to the hardcore people who were just "NO, EFF THAT, IF BR COMES I QUIT"..
---
downing can be revived....gotta double-tap those mofos
---
One of my few complaints with the game is down time.  I want to get right back in and go at it again.
---
Remember this is just a beta, things are liable to change
---
How did the final enemy die?
---
First, I love that a player belonging to the raider faction is the most representative of what a wasteland would be. 
---
Second, you don't have the lower level that would inhibit people because they feel like a douchebag. They are probably just looking for some PvP in a game where not many people want to
---
They are stash boxes, I can build the small vault tec crate
---
I don't know, once you log in the whole map is open to explore. later leveling actually opens different game modes. but no matter how long you wait, some vaults like 94 may never open.
---
Bobble heads and the magazines. I don’t use em, but I presume other people would
---
Detail, that I just noticed, with the last patch they have set default settings, so those who had changed the key to press to talk should look at it again, at least I just realized playing in adventure mode
---
Who ever said that they were scraping the entire scorched quest line? They are adding on to the main quest line with wastelanders, not replacing it.
---
Not as far as I can tell given the small limit of time.
---
Pumpkins are not plantable - those are gourds, they look very similiar.
---
New Vegas really didn't have enough choices and/or consequences, but I guess that's a consequence of it having to be an open-world game as well.
---
No. Just visit a bunch of other vendors and check what they are charging generally.
---
So sad too...
---
I hate to see my character hands
---
He was hiding in a bush after we killed his teammate after the circle got super small and we just killed him after we found him
---
True, but they aren’t good for PvP.
---
Honestly, airdrops would be more worth out of everyone got rewards from it
---
Got my disc for 10€ last week.
---
i wouldn't worry that re-sellers run out of their stuck soon...
---
Supposedly you're going to have to level up in the mode itself in order to unlock sections of the vault. That's great for people who are any good at PvP, but an odd design choice for a segment of the player base generally less focused on lore.
---
My only concern with it is how bad the fps drops will be for me, the game runs insanely badly in the base game in some areas.
---
Hmm. For a second, I thought you were the guy I played with. Had the power armor, and the 50 cal. like you. Last dude died from a Scorchbeast though.
---
If you focus on downed player, his teammates gonna wreck you.
---
Characters are linked to your Bethesda account, and saved in the cloud. As long as you redeem the key on the same account, it doesn't matter where you buy it.
---
What a wonderful patch. For the third time in a row..a disappointment. You focused your effort just for that miserable BR mode. Old glitches still there, no new enemies, no new contents (...and no, a brief added mission from time to time is NOT sufficient for a MMO ), endgame still boring..etc etc. gg bethesda.
---
Wonder why you got rated down for this? It's a fair and true point, and a concern a lot of us have, and **it doesn't stop us from playing or supporting the mode,** some of us are just interested in the lore. Some, like myself, more than the actual fighting. Asking for this is **not** bashing. Rating down anything mildly critical of design choices in what might as well be a *beta* period isn't ***bashing***. People downvoting for asking questions are acting more like a battered partner than consumers of a product and fan of a franchise. Bethesda being told what they were handling badly is why the game has gotten better.
---
They were fun in fallout 4, honestly. You haven't lived until you've fired a never ending Experimental MIRV. 
---
Couldn't for the life of me figure out how to survive it
---
I wish I could find a grandmother with a deadly shot. I mostly get stoners who blame the rest of the team for dying.
---
Right after the update, I did run into a lot more legendary enemies in Whitespring than usual.  This was before a nuke got dropped as well.  I think I got about 8-10 while clearing the entire resort.
---
NW is different because it is the only BR I’ve truly enjoyed
---
Nicely done
---
You really need to learn what a spinoff means
---
Well you don’t have to listen to their radio
---
atom shop
---
Lol, now go take off the perk card that lets you deal +100% to creatures xD
---
Check the atomic shop.
---
If it's anything like Skyrim and Fallout 4 the data files come compiled in an esm. I'm guessing even a simple change to the esm requires the entire esm to be downloaded.
---
I played on and off but I think now with all the upcoming things ill start fresh and just enjoy the game. I liked the atmosphere before, but due to a bug i lost my then high lvl character ( either that or I was drunk and decided to start over). But yeah thank you all for sticking with this game. There were some things at launch I certantly didnt like, but things are truly shaping up.
---
Already took it off
---
Yeah, I made the mistake of buying an under armor to use in NW. Goodbye 700 atoms
---
It's not anywhere as smooth as Apex Legends or other BRs but it's a lot of fun. I dig it.
---
I've just checked mine and it worked! Haven't started playing yet, but everything seems to be working as it should. I definitely think pausing the download was what screwed it up yesterday.
---
you could be correct. wasn't going ask sony tho.
---
cheers
---
&gt;they shit on pretty much any game that isn't NV
---
Even on Fallout 1/2?
---
My experience in one one sentence  
---
HOW THE FUCK DID YOU KILL ME WITH A 10MM PISTOL AGAINST T51 THE FUCK
---
Why don't you, "Well actually..." it for us. Again.
---
Also camp mccain is a awesome drop zone
---
Tip: Get a machine gun. Those can kick serious ass.
---
wait, you guys have sex?
---
I don’t think so just on console it makes things difficult especially in a gun fight
---
I just can't get into those type of games. Played 4 rounds of nw and it seemed like it was built well, just not for me.
---
 I don't have fun only shooting at other players I guess. I would much rather explore, read lore and follow a story.
---
 I think the main problem is my old Call of Duty days have burnt me out on any type of game where you just shoot other people. I played a couple rounds of fortnite br, Apex br and now this nw.  I just don't see the fun or allure in dying logging to the main menu then doing it all over again starting from scratch. It's just not my thing.
---
 I wish I could like it so I could have something to do between content patches on the adventure mode. 
---
O well, glad everyone else is enjoying it.
---
Having more than 24 would help get more traffic to our vendor stores.
---
Indeed they did
---
"placeholder text" means text that was supposed to be temporary, during development. They replaced the placeholder text with the actual text it's supposed to have, which is what you see in your screenshot.
---

---
But maybe turned into a feral ghoul ? Nuke that site again !!!
---
What do you unlock at level 5? I missed what it said
---
It’s not a bug, though (well the mask part may be, but the outfit/armor stuff isn’t). It’s fully intended. Letting the outfit stay over your armor masks what armor you’re using, which, in a battle royale, is vital info for your opponents. It’d literally be a pay-to-win feature. Do you have marine armor under your outfit? Or is it raider? Your opponent has no idea. So they get rid of that question by not letting the outfit cover the armor.
---
So, i can only use atomic shop cosmetics? And thanks btw, found it
---
Eh, what I'm going on about is when the schematics themselves become available as drops/purchases, not the level ranges I can actually craft an item.  
---
When I last played, it was said that the schematics for the handmade assault rifle for example were locked out after level 40 or 45.  So I'm server hopping and checking vendors for zero chance at certain schematics being available for purchase because I was past their drop/sale cap.
---
And you have to do this around four to five **hundred** times to get access to the holotapes/terminal entries that explain the story. At an average of 200xp per round and if the levels don't get vastly longer. This realisation has sadly soured my enjoyment of the mode.
---
Nice, thanks for the Intel. Would you elaborate on the wood armor change you mention? I'm not familiar with it.
---
Yep...
---
Well yeah. But this is nit a game i bought in for.
---
Depends. If it autoplays over my radio as I get close it's not my choice.
---
We all know how much they dislike push to talk.
---
You will get a four leaf clover
---
I have, my pcp told me since it was only that game that seemed to be causing it, I should avoid it and come back if the migranes were still going.  I have not had an incident since I last played. I want to love the game but my head says "NO GAME FOR YOU"
---
google 900 hours guy
---
He meant areas within vault 51 lol
---
No clue, i‘m lvl 1
---
Ah! Thanks for update.  Cause yeahhhhh wnought deaths from my own misfires.
---
Fascinating.
---
Even better: Get some ass. Those can kick some serious kick
---
I cleared westek and not one legendary. Then went to WS and nothing.
---
Maybe just bad luck (?)
---
Tbh, I don't even think this changes the fighting. You still need Overseer rank 11 or whatever to read the holotape or enter the room, but you can do so in peace and read away at Vault 51 in adventure mode without having to be deployed mid-reading.
---
Yeah with my Canadian girlfriend and her friends. You wouldn’t know them, they’re Canadian.
---
Can't disagree. But i just simply doubt that people will want Fallout battleroyale when there is so many options and free. Thats why i think this is a waste of resources. Hopefuly i am wrong.
---
S/He means in Vault 51. Areas are fenced off by laser walls you can't pass until certain levels of 'Overseer' progression levels. In fact, for some reason I can't pick up holotapes left out in the open until I finish several hundred matches.
---
No. I dont use mics, ever.
---
This is testament to the importance of the publisher and the developer being one in the same. BGS is a commercial entity, yes, but clearly they also take a degree of pride in their creative work. Bioware was swallowed up by EA, Bungie was swallowed up by Activision - and it shows.
---
While F76 has always had some issues, it has shown serious incremental growth and improvement. Anyone who has played this regularly can see that.
---
I think it's important for a community to always remain critical of the game, because it keeps the devs sharp and focused. But in this case, at least you can see that feedback does have an impact.
---
Even betterer: Get some nuke codes, and Hiroshima the fuck out of the final circle.
---
The crates are stash boxes, i can build the small blue one
---
Just keep this in mind: you can download Borderlands: the Handsome Collection (with the new DLC they released to bridge to 3) and a classic Sonic compilation for free this month with a ps+ membership. You can still play them even once the membership has expired.
---
Even if you absolutely hate 76, it's totally worth a month or few days free trial of plus.
---
What did you unlock?
---
Yeah, but it's all fun and games until everyone spawns there, and takes all the loot.
---
Same happened to me. I have two male characters and because they both represent me they look same but one is lvl 106 and new one is 35 which I was planning on leveling up while enjoying new BR. After being lvl 4 I went adventure to see what new I have got and realized my mistake
---
Bluffers I guess. Those who don’t like BR don’t play it, such as me :)
---
Yes , well said!
---
I actually don't play fallout 76 but was looking at the subreddit after the Bethesda conference, I also have not played elite in a while but have a pretty sweet hanger of ships. Im on PC, message me if you want my Discord/Steam! Always looking for more folks to play games with. Recently I have been playing RB6, Apex, Dead by Daylight, Destiny 2 plus a usual smathering of fighting games or Hearthstone/MTG.
---
My gut tells me that with the freebie week loot drops have been increased. Have been hanging out around Wixon Homestead and the Scorched here are dropping a ton of armor, guns. Trying to focus on some farming this week while the economy is hot.
---
Never mind I’ve misread your post lol
---
I'm not sure. Fighting in Nuclear Winter is still generally a case of who starts shooting/saw who first. If you have to flee the storm into an area where a few others people are already settled in you are almost certainly about to die.
---
Everybody, including your friends must be in the main menu to make it work. Not already on a server or playing adventure mode. Basically, it must be written main menu next to
---
Even better: Go to your nearest electricity provide and cut power to the surrounding areas, you can be beaten if there’s no competition
---
Sounds like you spent some time camping.
---
well, we are going to be getting more than patch 10 or 11. there should be one-three updates per month (june, july, august) it would be nice to know when to expect them.
---
Good for you bro, unfortunately I couldn't make it work on my end for some reason.
---
Are you a first time player on free trial too?
---
Ok, thanks.
---
What a terrible design...
---
i'd love to but everyone bullies me for being a kid smh
---
Really? I never had issues with PA and even took Down to people with it in a team once.
---
I wonder how it would play out if one of us got it... tbh we always all preferred to not use PA whenever possible in adventure mode and took over workshops that way too 
---
We don’t like the hud and mobility loss:
---
You need rank 100+ to have access to certain terminal(s)
---
Yeah, I crashed a few times back to back when trying to fast travel to a friend last night. I’d been playing for a couple of hours at that point, but I couldn’t get back on for long enough to justify trying to play anymore. Ended up just throwing in the towel. Hopefully it was just a shitty server night.
---
Usually when I am listing something I just think "how much would I pay for this item if I wanted it". Then I list it for 5-10 caps less.
---
Still 100x better than fortnite 
---
Double click/tap my comment if you agree

---
I dislike all BR Ive tried. Apex was tolerable and didnt feel very toxic, but the gear discrimination was real. Fortnight was satisfying but the building was ridiculous.
---
NW feels a little toxic for some reason but being a minigame and not the focus of the entire expirence, the gear balance is spot on, the round length is comfortable, and I dont get pissed when I die.
---
I play on 5 different accounts in my house on 2 different PS4s. Only one of them has PS plus so you are fine.
---
Yeah, but, what about all the fucking Ching Chong Chinese people?
---
Springboard traps, doormats and cows
---
Who mentioned Fortnite?
---
To hang out with friends.
---
Only played Fortnite and a little Apex, so this is a limited opinion:
---
Smaller map, any world loot container can be looted/has a chance at weapons, not just the Vault-Tec "Chests."
---
More variety in weapons and mods (random), no auto-aim, more clunky to assign them to slots.
---
Less about building, more about skills and tactics.
---
Not as hectic, cartoony or slow as others.
---
How long is the sneak peak lasting? Is this mode staying for a while? I want to try it out
---
Are you on ps4 my man? Id love a game of cattle ships
---
My team has not found one yet but I actually stack drugs when possible and the Damage resistance helps.
---
My goal is to use PA, my Heavy gunner perk, medic perk and drugs and try to tank some hits for the team
---
I was so exited to hear that the nuclear winter that literally every fallout NPC was talking about was about to be added into the game. 
---
To find out that it’s a battle royal mode, my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined. 
---
Just when you think they were able to pull the game out of the flames of the launch, they cut the cables and send the game straight to hell.

|-|-|-|-|-|-|

Considering the overwhelmingly positive response from the vast majority of people playing to right now, including all the free trial players who are using this new mode and also getting into adventure, I'd say it's safe to say that you are. 
---
Even if all this does is create some monetary fun to blow off steam and grind up some unlockables during adventure it gives us something to do while most of us are waiting for them to keep releasing fixes and adjustments til Wastelanders gets released. That's what I think many of us are waiting for now. 
---
Pretty much give us this and a repeatable xp grind non-stop spawn dungeon and I think most of us would be pretty placated for the next month or so while they're doing what they need to getting things ready to open the vaults.
---
Simple, message them with the phrase “Tiananmen Square Protests 1989”
---
Do you mean features? All of the improvements have been a positive experience
---
There's nothing stopping you from doing it on adventure servers, there's no reason to further separate the player base on yet another game mode.
---
Came here to say basically the same thing. Game is currently only accessible through the Bethesda launcher.
---
The 'outfits' in adventure mode cover up all your armor and under armor and are aesthetic. 
---
They aren't meant to have armor over them, it's not a bug.
---
I think it’s less about managing relationships and more about a function that isn’t working. “Block” and “block for session” still makes you visible. 
---
I’d also like a way to be able to manage when I want to play with others and when I just want to spend an afternoon soloing quests, diving into the lore through terminals, building at my camp, or even doing quests with just my partner or close friends.
---
 I love my community and love playing with friends but a do not disturb sign would be extremely helpful.
---
For How long BR mode will be available?
---
Why? It's not like anything happened in Tiananmen Square, June 4th, 1989.
---
maybe once the full nuclear winter is released but for now team wins. So as i think of it for now it's more of a deadmatch than a battle royal
---
I've noticed (in Adventure/Survival) that different underamours make you "Bulkier/Skinnier," but I don't know if it affects the hitbox.
---
I don't think it would affect NW (since "Everything" was re-balanced for that mode.
---
Problem is that many of these new players don't know about communal drop areas yet so it's likely to get server reset before someone even finds it.
---
That would’ve been funny! We did fight a scorchbeast in the small-ish circle though and it only gave a deathclaw gauntlet and meds
---
I was shocked at how well it worked and how the game play was smooth. It's a world of difference between this launch and PuBG, which was unplayable for me. Clearly all the lag and load time issues in adventure/survival are based around the sheer number of items in the world because without them, it was a great experience.
---
Welcome back! The player vending has been such a literal game changer for getting that one thing you've always seen and never needed, until you do.
---
As an added bonus, it really opened my eyes to the fact that my CAMP is an absolute dump.
---
It is good addation. They are carring nuke codes. And scorchbeast are good threat, because they do egouth damage to kill you fast.
---
 A couple dozen? Did you sleep?
---
Actually the vats is bugged for me. Now the vats stays on when the enemy i killed dies, and has a delayed exit :/
---
G2A is a bethesda launcher key code
---
Maybe have them in certain areas then. Spawning right on you seems daft. I understand tension and wasteland stuff but yeah.
---
I already roleplay but finding others that roleplay is a bit of a challenge. For people that enjoy roleplaying it’s an option and rather than thinking it will separate the player base you could also argue that it may attract more players to try fallout 76.
---
You're getting downvoted because OP is claiming a bug that isnt a bug. 
---
The outfits we have in the vault are meant to go over your armor and under armor and be aesthetic only.
---
If anything they could make it so the outfit stays on even though you have armor equipped  it then people would be checking their pip boy for confirmation of what armor they are wearing
---
And they make it worth your while to actually play it, instead of them just throwing the mode in and just going "here you go. Have fun."
---
Have you played the game? Armor goes under your clothes in this game.
---
I hated the way you chewed your Salisbury Steak in the vault, now I'm going to shoot you.
---
Recent players.
---
So this is actually an interesting thing. The cost you would find on raddit and the cost of in world vending is completely different, and it takes some experimentation and believe it or not your location and the look of your shop seems to have an effect on what people will buy and how much the will pay. Aesthetics matter. 
---
As far as pricing goes there are a couple factors one of witch is how long do you want to sit on a certain item. I mostly sell Bloodied, anti armor, Vampire, Furious, and Instigating 3 star weapons everything else I grind unless it has an interesting secondary effect like explodie or swing speed. 
---
Most explodies will sell for 5-10k depending on the primary effect. Two shot and bloodied being the higher end of that, but I would sell them here on reddit you will get a better return. Melee I price for a good primary 750-1000 caps for the first star then add anything from 250-1000 caps for each star after that. Then there is a multiplier. Say the legendary effects are bloodied, swing speed, +1 strength on a desirable weapon like a Bowie knife. Just the stars I would price at 3k the the time that by 2 or 3 depending on how long I wanted to sit on it. So I would price it at 6-9k. Bowie’s are light and people will pay 9k but you may sit on it for a time period. 
---
Armor I generally start at 750 for the first star and 250 for each star with multipliers depending on what it is. Metal armor are more valued then trapper armor. And then there are effects like sentinel, cavalier, AP refresh, and weapons reduction that will fetch a good price. I’ll add 2k just for the sentinel/cavalier effect. 1.5k for AP and WWR. So let’s say you have a cloaking sentinel with AP. The clocking is not vary popular but you could still get 2.5 to 3.5k for it because of the other effects on the armor. Things like Unyielding or vanguard with these effects I would sell here on raddit you will get a better deal. 
---
Ammo I sell for 1 cap each unless it’s a rare ammo like 2mm or plasma cartage I sell them for 2 caps. I don’t sell cryos they are priceless but I will by them for as much as 3 caps each. I also don’t sell fusion cores by ill buy then when needed for 50 caps. 
---
Stim packs I sell for 15-20, RadAway I sell for 10. All combat drugs I sell for 25. Bobble heads I sell for 100, stealth boys 50-75.
---
Over all it’s trial and error. If you have any doubts over price it and over time reduce the price until it sells. I hope that helps.
---
I’m sorry I’m a little dumb but how can I use my clothes on my character in the new mode? Do I have to have them equiped in adventure before I go into the Battle Royal?
---
Atomic Shop.
---
Favorite them I  the Atom shop
---
What’s nukashine
---
Yepp, I love it. It reminds me of playing COD in the good ole days and working toward something. Love getting back into a game. There’s a certain thrill that most modern online games don’t provide anymore
---
It would be more fuck if the UI wasn't complete dog shit and it didn't take 7 minutes to get into a game after entering lobby
---
But besides that its alright. Wish your special stats wasn't based of your campaign special. New player so i can't equip any cards and can't level up from playing this mode but i want to play this before it dies in 2 weeks
---
Also is there any way to increase voice chat. It is extremely low and can't hear anyone at all
---
If they can improve the server performance hopefully they’ll increase the population. 
---
Has anyone else noticed your base loading much quicker since the last patch?
---
My second match me and another player spawned and then had a fist fight to the death. I won &gt;:)
---
Vault 52 jumpsuit i think
---
And that sir, is what wins br’s
---
Awesome, I think I have a good bit of steel, it’s more the lead and acid that eludes me lol
---
Ah just read, you have to favourite pre purchased items. Thanks.
---
Or just not force us in there for fucking 8 minutes for no reason. Or at least let us explore it offline because at this point all it does is make it take forever to get into a game
---
Open a ticket with Bethesda and send them all the info you recorded. Hopefully you were able to get their screen names and all. Because I'm so sick and tired of the dupers.
---
Maybe, could of just been a busy server you were on and it had already been cleared.  When I got on, I didn't see a single other person at WS which is rare.  That's a good spot to farm legendaries and XP.
---
I did.  I have the capability to make several types of ultracite ammo....:but not 50.
---
or the loud ass banjo you can hear throughout entire vault
---
Anyone want to group up later on PlayStation for Nuclear Winter and adventure mode
---
Go find some and drink it and find out
---
It has less bugs than Fortnite... it’s a miracle. No pay to win... no battle pass.... no buying overseerer ranks.... nothing... just the best BR I have ever played. Thanks Bethesda. Thank you.
---
So it is a bug then. OP is claiming that his outfits get taken off when he puts on armor. This shouldn’t be happening, since outfits are visual and usually stay equipped when you switch armors.
---
Yes everyone please spawn at the bridge.. all the time. Thanks
---
"Well if it isn't the clever one!"
---
You are probably right.  I'm gonna do the same after I finish building my new camp.  All I have left is lighting and turrets.
---
Where are you at, it feels like it starts getting to be a bit of a grind in the higher levels
---
I never understood why people feel like they have to bash a game or a company. If you don't a videogame, that's fine. There are many things I don't like either.
---
I hope they enjoy the trial and maybe stick with us.
---
Yup and that's your reason to keep playing. My problem with most Battle Royales and Overwatch, and other games like that, is that eventually you realize there's no point to playing...While here you get rewards and lore in the main FO76 game, so it feels far more relevant, which makes it more fun and exciting.
---
I don't think they're going to do this. You unlock more lore by leveling up in the BR mode. That's what they expect you to do is play so you can unlock more of the story.
---
I’ll have to give that a try, right now I’m using a handmade that’s fully decked with attachments and all the perks to make non auto rifles better.
---
Northwest edge, where there's the road that zigzags back and forth up a mountain. Near the top of it is a little lookout tower.
---
Unfortunately no, but if they ever set up cross platform systems I'll look you up.
---
I agree.
---
Exact same feels :p
---
PS4 has a "Status" thing for stuff like this, or you can message friends who have the game, not sure about Xbox (PC is something else, I guess).
---
There's already an auto-group option on all platforms, so you can either message your friends, or use the LFG tool provided.
---
If you can't win fight, retreat. This is not game for pussies like fortnite is. :D
---
Sounds good my mam
---
Yes... it's because 176,345,712,996 items don't have to load.
---
The game was clean for a few hours, but last night the cheaters already started showing up. Whether this becomes regular occurrence depends on how bethesda reacts to it. If we get silence, expect more and more cheaters every match
---
It gets pretty exhausting to still be seeing every other person up on some high horse about how “Bethesda isn’t getting my money because of the irredeemable launch”. It’s been like, half a year and the game has improved more than even its supporters could have hoped. Time to get over it maybe?
---
You do start getting better rewards after level 9 though. CAMP items like a Vault 51 oveseers chair and weapons skins.
---
....
---
Yes. You have to create a character in adventure mode first. Complete the initial "leaving the vault" mission. This will then unlock the other two modes.
---
There's nothing wrong with my internet or hardware, and I'm not the only one having this issue. So the error is  on the Bethesda side.
---
I've also noticed that the sum of the download "xx of yy GB" changes depending on the downloaded amount and the total size of the game. Obviously, one of the coders fucked up.
---
Never intended to quit because of this.
---
Said that I did not have an epiphany either.
---
Played a couple of matches to see if it was worth what had been sacrificed in the altar of BR, nope, it wasn't and still not for me regardless of the fact that this BR is FO flavoured. Moving on.
---
Personally buy bobbles at 20c for challenge. See a lot @100c, so thats probably the upper limit of saleable.
---
Ah yeah but when you’re in the circle you have no idea how close you are to the edge of the new zone
---
Pc gamers have an advantage, easier to avoid vats. But yes, it might be time to rely on it less
---
Well, there is serums, so some mutation, but not much.
---
It seems like underarmor should probably work, but not much else.
---
ugh, that's what we were afraid of...I'm reading it still works with pistols? dis true?
---
Pretty much this
---
I don't think so, I believe some of the others were on console
---
It's pretty well done tbh, and I think holding us over til Wastelanders and trying to bring in a new fan base is exactly the point. 
---
Throw in a repeatable non-stop spawn asaault dungeon quest and I think we can keep ourselves occupied for the next 6 weeks while they get caught up on bug fixes and adjustments.l before they launch Wastelanders and open the vaults.
---
Absolutely this. Hopefully they’ll end up banned as they deserve.
---
Played fortnite the whole time the TDM mode was up, and never touched the BR mode, played PUBG once and died in like the first 10 so just didn't have fun and refunded it. BR really doesn't interest me, but damn I'm having fun in this one and 2 friends and myself have already won 2 matches in the first hour of it being live.
---
I understand people bashing Bethesda for the fiascos with the merchandises, I will be pretty pissed to if I paid for the Collector's Edition or the Nuka Dark. 
---
But I never understand the hatred for the game itself. I played it at the B.E.T.A. and it was okay. Not great, but definitely doesn't deserve the overwhelming hate. And people still can't let it go even up to now. People will talk trash about the game just because it's Fallout 76.
---
cheers all much appreciated. I thought I had tried with them in my inventory but I guess not!
---
!remindme 7 hours
---
I tend to sell bulk junk for for 35-45 caps depending on what it is. Adhesive and aluminum being on the higher end of that. Screws I sell for 3-5 each depending how I feel when loading the machine.
---
The problem is that legendary weapons aren't good endgame itemization. They are totally random and they can take you from 0 to outer space in a single drop. The only way that provides any length of content is to simply make the good ones so rare that the average player doesn't get them for a long time if ever. 
---
MMORPGs, ARPGs and Lootershooters have been around for a long time now. The way to make good endgame rewards is already known. Bethesda chose to ignore it.
---
Correct
---
What harm are they doing you? So self righteous it's unbelievable lol.
---
Not to mention there's a substantial Easter egg devoted to them in the game
---
Feels bad man
---
You're being extremely pedantic lol
---
Do you want them to be more specific said say,  "I've hated all BR games until this one."
---
Would that make you happy?
---
Instead of creating a new mode, just find others on this sub or create a new 76RP sub and just join in existing player worlds. Nothing is preventing this right now, just takes a bit of effort or coordination on your part.
---
You get both Overseer XP, real xp that transfers to adventure mode and caps, also it unlocks player icons. We might get other rewards in the future higher up, I am only Overseer rank 7 so far.
---
So far I’m level 15 and it pretty good
---
So not the dopemine rush you feel when a god roll drops aye
---
Not a fan of PvP but it's not bad for a quick play. Definitely better than normal PvP where honestly being less than level 50 and having only base items is not a good time
---
How did you launch the bike? My group found 5 nuke codes and gave them all to someone but we never knew how to use them.
---
I had my doubts after getting bored with the genre, and not really wanting it in 76, but after a couple rounds, this feels different enough, works well with the Appalachia map, and is exciting and fun.
---

---
What weapons were they talking about? There were a couple weapons I noticed multiple different people start selling on the market that I had never seen even mentioned before so I was suspicious.
---
Lol, right. My CAMP sucks compared to some of the places I saw last night. Really cool.
---
Yep plus there a many holotapes scattered around linked to player leveling.  Seems cool.
---
it's like getting up early to beat the traffic, and finding that everyone got up early to beat the traffic.
---
Feels for ya, man.
---
The issue isn't that it takes effort to get things, the issue is to make it so random that most items are completely unusable, some people will never get anything that is good, and oh yea, the whole advancement and itemization system also isn't leveraged to allow you to build some kind of specific interesting character but simply to raise your stats until the game balance breaks and you're oneshotting bosses.
---
Oh yeah, I get ya. I've been watching Jim for years so the 76 stuff is a little disappointing, even if the criticism at launch is well justified. I've yet to watch the recent Jimquisition but he's explained before that he's sick of Bethesda making the same mistakes and that I can understand
---
are briefcases just scattered around randomly or are they in containers? I've yet to see one, which is annoying as I had 4 keycards in one match :/
---
I love Fallout lore. I own the PAX survival guide and paid more for it than I did 76. I own the art book/s. I have the FO3, NV and FO4 Collectors Editions. I have over a thousand hours logged across the series. I've played the classics a dozen times over the years. I actually like Mothership Zeta and Honest Hearts. I have the two action figures on my wall. So, trust that I'm telling the truth when I say that I ***LOVE*** the lore and would do a lot, spend a lot, to enjoy it. But to get to Rank 100+ is going to take HUNDREDS of hours of PvP by itself... for what? Probably less than a dozen terminal entries and some voiced dialog? Even if the spirit was willing, the flesh is weak, and I think I'd burn out *long* before I get to rank 50, let alone rank 100+. It's a ludicrous *barrier* more than motivation. I'll just end up reading the Wikia and listening to the soundbites.
---
Haha it was never going to be smooth sailing if they were messing with vats. 
---
It's obvious to me that we're still in beta and we are the play testers. They clearly don't do it before they release a patch as this would be obvious in five seconds if they had.
---
Yeah, i'm pretty excited for the vault raids. Tbh, the content stream has been pretty good so far and hopefully that continues.
---
They would be if they were designed well.
---
They go to another school!
---
Still sounds like your console/pc. It’s not the game. Sorry man. Maybe reboot your stuff. Double check your internet.  If it’s a PS4 do the download in rest mode.  Works so much quicker.
---
Can’t argue with that.
---
You probably call conservatives Nazi's too lol. Scum indeed.
---
read the top right of the splash-screen
---
There are. It’s called anti armor build you’ll ignore 113% of armor so you can kill a bloodied in 1 shot it’s balanced your just garbage
---
Just tried it this morning.  This is the first time I've ever tried a battle Royale type game ever and I found it quite addicting quickly.  Plus I love the fallout universe period so it hooked me even more.  I don't care what some people have said, I really like this game.  Haters gonna hate
---
Yes. I have played every day, bar about 4, since beginning of December on xbox. 
---
There had been a rise in hostility and a down turn cooperation... is this just part of levelling up in FO76? Or a product of the lack of recent content? I noticed that there were far fewer high level players last night after the BR mode launched... also was much more peaceful...
---
OP is asking if the search can happen while they spectate
---
It's not like on June 4th, 1989 in Tiananmen Square there was some kind of...I don't know...protest turned violent or something.
---
There's also mention of [REDACTED] being shipped there by one Stanislaus Braun...
---
da fuck is an rpg then mate? im prety sure people in survival ware rping and actually acting as raiders..... i dont think you know what rpg stands for.
---
it's good business. a week with a new mode that people are seeming to enjoy, coupled with 50% off the ticket price and boom, larger user base and more profits. Todd can finally afford that space shuttle he's been eyeing 😊
---
It would be an interesting option to have server with tag, language and role. Only optionally (like the nuclear winter option to fill group), so only those who really want that experience at the cost of maybe it will touch on a less full server while most people would continue on normal servers.
---
Precisely today I enjoyed very much visiting a CAMP where its owner has kindly shown me the operation of his fully functional electric chair (even gave me a spark while being a bit far away) and his throne with perfect mist effect decorated next to a photo session with his chainsaw Flamethrowers ... were only a few minutes, no microphone, only gestures, but superbly fluid and with just a few gestures ... then my partner came and killed him to see that I had taken some life, I told him to return his junk and I showed my disagreement with that action ...
---
A great experience that in a server dedicated to the role and filtered by language to be able to openly use the microphone would multiply exponentially. And all this only because he saw me taking out the camera.
---
The community asks for it, the community needs it. The best thing about Fallout is its atmosphere and the community that gives it life.
---
I found the rifleman perk last night too. I had a combat rifle sniper tapping people rapidly for 140 it was amazing.
---
Nothing out of the ordinary happened in Tiananmen Square, June 4th, 1989, and people definitely didn't die.
---
They broke it...
---
Pharma Farma, radaway up my butt :D
---
Only the game's economy &amp; server stability, no big deal right?
---
People are downvoting you without explaining which doesn’t answer your question if it is in fact genuine.  The dupers are devaluating a market that most players are keeping legitimate to maintain gameplay.  It ruins the game for a lot of casual players.  Its cheating and a tos violation as well.  It is not self-righteous, it is the right thing to do to report them and Bethesda suggests it.
---
The Sunshine Company raids for profit. The expenditure of ammunition in random acts of violence is counter to that policy. 
---
Don’t be a bigot even raiders have friends.
---
I think it was a Faschnacht unlockable.
---
Did you listen to me?  
---
We need to see what armor we are wearing. If we are running around in outfits we would have to switch to our pip boy to see if we are wearing our marine armor or one of the 3 wood armor we picked up. 
---
I'm sure it's working as intended. It may not be the most efficient , and be changed in the full version, but it's not a bug.
---
So you're saying it's okay for a game to be a buggy mess from the beginning? I mean, are you that much of a contrarian dipshit?
---
they said from the very beginning the game would be supported for 10 years, so that's what we paid for
---
It was a limited Atomic Shop item for Faschnaht. No longer available I'm afraid.
---
I would say its an okay game now. Still plenty bugs but yeah... nothing to do really and boring quests and so on, but its kinda fun
---
Both were DOA so good comparison
---
It's a sphere. If you can place your camp on flat ground you're only getting half the height. Putting it up in a tree or something gives you more height to build in.
---
Damn all I every got was giant mask and soldier
---
.is there a way to bring those into NW? Or only atom shop stuff
---
I will die for You :D
---
Added and pmed, need the same
---
I spawn at the hotel and almost always find a lvl 2 chest, a plan, and a few other weapons. Plus no one else seems to spawn near it, and it's fairly midmap so there's time to set up defenses.
---
Yeah km well aware no need to be condescending. 
---
If it worked like that in NW we would have to check our pip  boy to see which ar.ors we have.
---
No, NW has separate list of cosmetics.
---
You mean trying to escape the burning after each conquest? 
---
Stay safe kids.
---
Start the download.... 15 second
---
After I patched yesterday it wanted to download that amount for me as well.   Fortunately it flew through it in like 20 seconds and everything was fine.    I'm not sure what it did or why it did it but I had no other issues other then some elevated blood pressure from thinking I was going to have to download the game.
---
The one thing I did do was immediately backup my copy of the game on another drive.   I am also not a new player such as yourself.   This is on PC as well.   Hopefully this helps in some way.
---
Always hazmat kids, always hazmat.
---
I find it interesting that nobody uses melee when we don't have bloodied swing speed super sledges
---
 I like the point, but the weight limit is to have people who like to use heavy weapons be able to. A good fix would be to only be able to carry a certain amount of weapons and healing items rather than base it on weight.
---
I just didn't bother with any ranged weapon at all. I'm melee in adventure and I know I'd suck at aiming, but hey, others also suck at it too so I smashed instead. It's so funny when you run n zigzags and a 3 player enemy team goes full storm trooper on you. I get my best kill streaks with a combat knife. My team could pick others while they panic too so it just works.
---
Soooooooooooooooooooooooo much.
---
Yeah and I don't play them at all. I actually wholly hate PvP in everything I play but I'm not unreasonable and would rather give something new a try when presented the opportunity. Not knowing where your opponents are until you're being sniped by a fully armored squadron is kind of pointless to me. I lack skills to play this game mode and I'm not motivated to develop them so... *Shrug*
---
I’m joining later never played. I hope I can get encounters with randoms.  I’ll put vc on. Kinda wondering what it will be like
---
What kind of a moron are you? You don't care about bugs and promises? You have to be a troll. The rest of us actually fucking care, because it's important for a game to work properly when selling it for 60 fucking bucks.
---
I knew there some contrarian morons here, but I didn't think it was this bad.
---
You'll love it, the game in its current state is fantastic, there's more to do than I have time for. Sure there's a little bug here and there but week by week this game just gets better and better for me.
---
Have fun 👍
---
No you wouldnt
---
Hi! In what way is chemist broken? Thanks
---
Outstanding idea!! .... now let me dress it!
---
U on PS4
---
Not everyone uses reddit and it’s a lot of effort trying to coordinate roleplaying with people from all around the world due to time zones etc. I think it’s a good idea, and if this was an option on the menu, people that haven’t tried roleplaying  may be interested in trying it out rather than micromanaging a reddit/web forum.
---
It feels like more of a chore trying to coordinate it all whereas it would be a lot more convenient if there was an option available to play with others that roleplay.
---
Absolutely! Maybe I'll run into a Bethesda dev or two....im the immortal words of Lord Shaxx in Destiny: *"We can trade punches"* 😂
---
It's whoever finds Marine armor that always kills me lol. Last night I found marine armor and managed to be last man standing, but I did have a stellar crew too.
---
wait. It was 59 gb for me, ended in 30 seconds
---
No, you're an idiot and a troll. Your account is literally named after 76.
---
Why does it even matter so much to you? Why does it bother you so badly that somebody can not like other BR games but somehow find NW to be enjoyable?
---
Yeah i definitely experienced the last people just hiding in bushes / behind trees as well. And we definitely need pvp related emotes- I was able to convey with like “come here” and “gift” when I was trying to share with teammates who didn’t have a mic but others don’t seem to share the loot :/
---
https://www.google.com
---
I am but I'm UK time and not on a whole load atm unfortunately.
---
AA doesn't do much. Due to how the armor mechanic works in this game, AA is just a straight damage boost, I think around 28% without any other armor penetrating effects. It becomes less effective the more armor penetrating stuff you use.
---
It slows you down and you can hear it a mile away just like in survival mode
---
Only atom shop stuff and the mask you’re asking about was a atom shop one
---
I will agree that Apex is fun. I play that with a few other friends too.
---
You also earn perk cards, weapon and power armour skins... things like that for the people not interested in lore.
---
I have no idea really, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume that Xbox would have a more talkative community, what with the ease of headsets and whatnot.
---
(I know it's easy on PC too to hook up a mic, but being vocal on a console is more baked in)
---
Gotcha
---
Yeah the crossbow is deadly af
---
I use a shotgun because I can’t seem to hit anything. I can’t decide if the hit boxes are off or I really am that bad.
---
you can still use vats for world creatures just an fyi.
---
I would agree we got jumped by one group last night all over 150. Other then that most were under 50 on the server. I’m still trying to figure out what that one group was using on us. I haven’t been one shot like that sense the old days when TSE’s and staking explosive bobble heads was a thing.
---
Cool bra
---
I never liked using VATS, and I definitely feel well prepared for this mode. I've also been practicing falling shots with marsupial, and yesterday I managed to down somebody while jumping off a tower in my power armor. The trick is to completely ignore your raised weapon model
---
Yh but not in pvp and that's great
---
You guys 4 real? My 69,99$ went for a freaking br mode -.- and you guys are clapping ,, literally most of my challenges and daily quests are bugged but instead of fixing the game hope here's a br mode......
---
So rather than putting in effort yourself to coordinate you'd rather the developers spend far more time and resources to create an entirely different mode? 
---
And you think making a post on Reddit is too much of a chore. ...k
---
You must be disappointed a lot. Companies say all kinds of things to sell products, doesn't mean that's what you are buying. Show me where the purchase price of your game listed 10 years of support!
---
No, not yet at least. The devs are pretty great about community feedback and NW is in beta anyway. Things are liable to change
---
Np
---
And it just keeps getting better!
---
Yes! You just gotta keep trying, and you get points. Just keep playing it and you level up. Nothing to lose! Nothing!
---
Agreed on both!  Being able to enter back into 51 after being eliminated in NW is a great idea, using the awesome "lobby" they created for us.
---
I really thought we would be able to enter in adventure mode just to be able to explore and read the terminals in 51.  Perhaps this will change when NW gets out of Beta...one can hope!
---
The next one is at level 16 or 17. It’s the long yellow one. 
---
I just want to the big orange and blue one. Or the heated power armor.
---
I am s o glad I didn’t buy Nuka Dark - I was going to but a friend talked me out of it because I don’t even drink and she was like “surely you’ll be able to just find the bottle on eBay in a while” and omg I’m so glad I listened cause all I cared about was the bottle and I would have been so sad
---
What's this got to do with the original post?
---
I know what you mean but don't forget that to this point it's just a pre Beta state and things may get changed til release maybe even the higher ranks or the system altogether
---
Yeah, it's just a trial for right now, too see what needs fixing and such. Has a release actually been set for it? If it has, I missed it.
---
Never ever a mic... I am on PC and need a text chat ! Simple!
---
The medium stash box is rank 16 I think.
---
Yeah I miss cod :mw multiplayer before hacks got so prevalent. Nothing will ever satisfy me like that did, not with all the hacks out there, but this comes close
---
It’s fine. I’ve recklessly smashed a downvote button at some point in my Reddit career. I get it. I should point out that even if I don’t care for something that doesn’t mean I also think it shouldn’t exist. It doesn’t mean if something isn’t great that people can’t enjoy it 
---
EXAMPLE: I love all the terminator movies. Huge fan since the first. Loved every single one. A lot of those movies are objectively bad. Haha. 
---
I found it at the very least interesting to see Fallout in this way. I mean how crazy is this... from me spending hundreds of hours across fallout games isolated by myself just scavenging my heart out, to me and my friends being together in the same wasteland looting and team fighting other survivors who are real people across the world. It’s such a romantic idea that just did not work for me.
---
Are there any outfits that you know of
---
Flatwoods
---
Inaccurate with all TSE Gat Plasma users?
---
It's just like the repair kits, constant shitstorm here when it was datamined and then, when it comes out...nobody cares. I wonder where all those "if fallout 76 becomes fortnite I'm leaving" people are.  Knowing this community, I find it hard to believe they actually did just leave without any dramatic posts
---
The most fundamental issue I see with this game is that the perk and itemization system aren't leveraged to let you build a mechanically distinct character that tackles the wasteland in a way that suits your preferred playstyle and fills a role in a team, but simply as a way to give yourself gamebreaking amounts of firepower. 
---
Spinning the ill conceived Legendary system from Fallout 4 into the endgame content for this game was just not a good design choice for all kinds of reasons. The randomness of it flies in the face of people trying to build their own character. You have to build your character to accommodate the best weapon you have, not build a weapon that accommodates the character you want to play. The way you acquire legendaries flies in the face of people who like Fallout because they like scavenging and exploring. It creates an entirely separate system for how to acquire items that actually matter, and then relegates the scavenging and exploring to an upkeep task because your damn weapons still break every five minutes in this game. 
---
It's been a bad system from day 1, I've called it out from day 1, and the fact that the game's community has shrunk down to only the people who don't care hasn't actually fixed any of these problems that have driven people away from this game.
---
It depends what level you are and where you’re going on the map
---
go and take over as maky workshops as possible, you will get good XP and easy mobs to kill with your turrets
---
NW is more of a “spree of corpse”. Died. Had fun. 10/10.
---
Be patient. It takes awhile man. Everybody went through that. I know I did when I was lower leveled still.
---
Build and gear dependence is what makes PvP outside Nuclear Winter such an unbalanced mess.  Sorry but Survival mode is just a big bunch of unbalanced nonsense and there's no need for PvP in Adventure mode where its 99% trolling.
---
I loved it as well and it worked so well and game play was so smooth, I'd like to see it expanded upon. I'm sure they are already working on new areas of the map but I'd like to see additional game modes. Something along the lines of faction based wars. 26 v 26 or maybe 13 v 13 v 13 v 13. Fight to control areas and let us pick factions. It would require bigger teams which I think is something that's already needed in adventure and survival. The mechanics can work the same as Nuclear Winter (no VATS, no legendary's) but you could let players unlock weapons and armor as they level.
---
The mission I’m currently doing is to go into a mine and get the black water bandits key fragment, I’m only about level 12 but there enemies are usually level 40+
---
I got sucked in too lol. I think all the scared people need to know is that you have nothing, not one thing to lose in br mode and everything to gain
---
Yes, any explosive laser does more damage than what the number says, best way is to play test on either players or a set creature ie behemoth
---
Haha, thanks man!
---
Just did another quick run and picked up 2 legendary bits of armor ( one 2 star ).
---
Ran into a heap of ghouls in the first room then had to leave to defend a workshop.
---
The PC population is fine, plus there's a text chat mod which will help you group up with people easier. Most of us have each other on  our friends lists so we can jump between servers when someone calls it out on the global chat. It also makes trading a lot easier as well.
---
Remember this is a sneak peek so there is probably a lot of other things that will be in the final product. Like this
---
No different than needing an Xbox Gold to play online over there, or did they change that now?
---
And that's how fallout ends. With thunderous applause.....
---
I haven’t been paying much attention. rank 15 is the blue enclave power armor, or ultracite. It might just be for all power armor.  I’m going to be grinding all day, I’ll update you if I see anything.
---
Tried playing on my lunch break, 5 games, no communication, going on their own and never helping each other... At least there's a commun part between all BR
---
two more questions: does your body leave the game when you log off? do skills gained in story mode transfer to BR?
---
Nothing wrong with Apex, lol. I have a couple friends I play that with as well! I feel like I suck worse at it though 😂
---
Take off the vault suit. It doesn’t really protect you anyways and half the time the people I see who have atom shop items are wearing the outfits like the BRIGHT ORANGE space suit or the alarming aqua fasnacht helmet. Not too hard to spot imo lol and you only get your outfit until the first time you find armor anyway
---
This should help [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-zone-map-with-recommended-level-range/](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-zone-map-with-recommended-level-range/)
---
On PC it auto teams us if we aren't on a team (we don't have to add them to the friends list first). You can turn off the option in the menu
---
Thanks for the explanation. Very detailed.
---
I'm an idiot now? Wow man, real civil. My username is this because I started using reddit for  the 76 sub because I play it a bunch....
---
They're already grasping at straws lol. People were saying it's a greedy cash grab after e3 announced year 2 of free content
---
Yup, new player here. Many thanks to the dude with the CAMP near the lumber mill, who help by killing the enemies chasing me - I didn’t catch your name (Morgan?) 
---
He also called me over and gave me some stimpaks, healing items, food, water and ammo.  
---
I didn’t even know how to use the emotes to say thank you to him.
---
But that you it was unexpected and highly appreciated. 
---
👍🏻🥇😁
---
Dramatic exit is mandatory, you’re dead right.
---
People would kill it.
---
Yeah dude your way to early for Blackwater bandits  rn I was level 30ish when I did those and they were still hard. The more you level up the more damage your guns starts doing, usually by increments of 5 levels.
---
go left behind the vault. look for small shack. Then.....................up to you.
---
It shouldn’t affect your play much, accuracy is accuracy. They may have a better understanding than you but that may be it. Br games typically spawn you with nothing and you have to scavenge for loot in order to be the last squad/person standing. Their are different play styles such as the careful sneaky person or the rush in and guns blazing person. Good luck with whatever you do mate
---
Same question: where can you open them?
---
I enjoyed more than i thought i would but i hoped vertibirds would carry us to the spawn point of our choice that would be even more fallout like!
---
Circle is the safe zone
---
Take your time. Loot and scrap EVERYTHING and breakdown junk every chance you get. Stay in and around flatwoods a while. Takeover workshops and defend. Dont feel rushed because its a trial period. Its on you to immerse yourself in the game. You get out of it what you put into it.
---
I was expecting it to happen on console due to them sharing the same Revive/Leave power armor button,   I'm surprised it happens on pc too, can you change your keybind to revive to something else or is it shared aswell? Might be a workaround if you can.
---
Ok. But I’d have no frame of reference since I’ve never had a Gatling Plasma of any kind before.
---
It worked for me
---
Todd ''Sweet little lies'' Howard
---
What should I do then? All my missions are that high level, should I just go around the lower areas and pick off stuff?
---
Might be lag? I dunno, didn’t play it enough.
---
There really is no need to resort to petty sarcasm over the internet.
---
I have made a suggestion to the developers and you have disagreed with it and that's fine, just leave it at that.
---
I have tried to do the above before and like I said it is a chore. I work a full time job and have commitments to family etc. The last thing that I want to do is come home from work and coordinate an entire reddit/forum for roleplaying before I actually get to roleplay. 
---
The developers are paid to for their time, so yes, I have suggested that this may be an idea that they could develop if there is enough interest. I would like to load up the game and join a world that roleplays, it's that simple.
---
That is correct. Everybody starts fresh with no armor or weapons in NW. You have to go out and find both with your team. 
---
The only thing I'd say to do for now, in order to be able to "keep up" with those of us who have been playing NW would be to practice not using vats to kill things with guns. That's really about it.
---
Yeah you’re right, thanks :)
---
Your character disappears when you log off. Perk cards, mutations, and gear do not transfer. S.P.E.C.I.A.L Skill points do.
---
Awesome.
---
Yurp.. if you get to the flag on the compass you'll be in safe zone
---
That would take forever, haha. I'm in.
---
this not how we greet newcomers. This is supposed to be a community.
---
Played for maybe 5 minutes, waited like 10 minutes to play. Found it boring, left, back to adventure mode to actually play fallout not fallnite 76.
---
Sure, but if that was why they were fenced off, they could have just as easily deactivated them until the 'full' version releases. It feels like this is how it's intended to be. And it's going to result in a tiny percentage of the playerbase ever seeing the story in-game because even if you love this mode now, in several hundred hours when you are only half-way through the ranks, you (royal you, as in the players in general) likely aren't going to be thinking about holotapes and terminals anymore. More likely burnt out and playing normal mode again, a different game, or just loaded up the Wikia.
---
You dont have to be good PvP to level. You get much more experience by just staying alive longer, which isnt hard to dig you hide.
---
Try to do events in the forest and explore, just keep exploring the forest and you’ll get easier quests, it’s hard to get up to level 20 but after that the game starts picking up, I’m level 63 and it’s a lot easier now.
---
I mean yeah, generally people who play more than you will be better than you. But that isn’t always true. You can jump into it whenever you want, but now would definitely be the easiest time to do so since there isn’t a clearly defined meta or skill base yet. Generally if you’re good at the combat in this game you’ll be good at NW. So far I average about 6-10 kills a game and I don’t consider myself to be that good. But at the end of the day the first couple minutes of a match are usually pure luck with what weapons you’re able to get compared to the other guys. So yeah, don’t feel bad if you miss out now because it isn’t really gonna change much for you. It’s still gonna release eventually and you’re gonna be able to play it whenever you want then (assuming it stays populated).
---
The battle royle feels like fallout without vats. If ur good at fallout u will be fine
---
One of the ways I got items early on was to have a high level player take u through some high leveled areas and help u out and u will get some better drops this way thats wat I did at least I had some high levels help me level up 15 levels in one night
---
Being okay with a shoddy product at launch that gets somewhat playable months after the fact is why the dev process is terrible today. So I guess revel in it.
---
You should probably stick to the Forest, The Toxic Valley, and The Ash Heap until you reach maybe level 20-25 or so. The other 3 biomes are more high level and difficult to do alone while so low.
---
Yeah fair point
---
Thank you so much for listening to the community with the wastelanders update, really happy with the improvements being made!
---
I will never be able to be a serious player in NW when I'm going up against four organized and communicating players. Good for them, I hope they are having a blast but solo players stand little chance.
---
Yeah I’ll try that :)
---
Weightless ammo in adventure mode would be great. I'm tired of wasting fusion cores just so I can run around.
---
The worst thing about Vault 51 is how fucking amazing it is in there.  A concert stage?  A boxing ring?  Gambling machines?  Those people were living the life!
---
I have played on both Xbox and pc. IMO the game runs better on pc. And the community isn't as toxic.
---
I envy you, I really do, so much enthusiasm and joy towards the game, I just get pissed off every time I remembering bought the incomplete game.
---
super fun, i think!
---
No you can melt power armor in NW with any weapon
---
Your gonna have to be more specific than that
---
I also enjoyed it man, very nice and very fun, my only suggestion as a lowly consumer would be to increase the map size slightly and tweak with the fire wall. (Maybe the firewall things might fix itself if the map is bigger.)
---
Yeah that would be your problem right there then. If you’re already collecting Rose’s key fragments then you’ve advanced the quest line a bit too far for your level already. Your weapons aren’t necessarily junk but level 40 mole miners can soak up a lot of damage, a lot more than level 12 weapons are going to be dishing out.
---
At your level you should be doing some of the quests in Toxic Valley or if you were aiming for somewhere a bit in the middle The Ash Heap. Right now both of those zones will have enemies more scaled to the tiers of weapons you have access too.
---
Been looking for a post to answer this but couldn’t find it... played about 5 games yesterday and honestly had a blast. But one game I managed to pick up 5 nuke codes but had no idea what to do with them. How do I finish the job with the nuke in NW?
---
Follow the main quest. It'll point you in the right direction. Just remember not to rush it otherwise you might hit a difficulty wall when you start to explore other regions
---
Would like to know as well
---
I'll keep that in mind. I've got some decent weapons and someone made me some hardened pocketed hear last night so I'll scrap any extra weapons. Wants sure if it's worth it to keep hold and sell? Or just sell the junk from them? 
---
I'll get the hang of it all soon ha! Thanks for your replies :)
---
You would be wrong, lol
---
Get a scope and you'll be legendary.
---
Its pre beta. Trophies would come when it releases probaly
---
Yeah it’s not bad.
---
can you use your existing characters or do you start with a level 1 character?
---
thanks guys
---
I always blamed the game for being unbalanced but I guess I was just uneducated about it, I’m really enjoying the game otherwise :)
---
This is probably a more negative opinion on the game but here is mine
---
First of all i want to say it is a lot more fuck then i thought it would be (when it was announced i was laughing my ass off at how cash grabby and stupid this idea it was)
---
First issue is the UI has to change it is absolute garbage for this type of game mode
---
Second issue is that vault 51 you spend way to much time in there then needed why the hell do you have to wait 3 more minutes after all players are in?
---
Third the entry method to the BR. Pretty much every BR that has existed entry method is skydiving in weather this be Apex, Pubg, Fortnite, H1Z1 The only one i can think of that didn't was Darwin project and i could be wrong here.
---
It seems they didn't want to do this because it probably would not fit in lore wise but also to not just look like they are copying every other BR. But, the problem this ensures it gives people with beefier computers a strategical advantage on PC (and probably console too if you have pro versions of consoles)
---
Because you just spawn into the map people with better systems have faster load in times they get to actually play before others (I have on many occasions literally watched enemies walking around looting while i am still stuck frozen for the like 2 seconds after you get vision (my rigg is a 1060, 8 gb ddr4, i5 6500 and have the game installed on ssd)
---
If they added in a skydiving sequence or some other creative way it would fix this instantly
---
Fourth issue I have is there is absolutely no communication in this game. I don't voice chat to rando's and even if i did for me the voice chat is so low i can't even hear anyone. they need to add some form of ping system and or chat system. Trying to signal that i found power armor is infuriating because there is no system in place
---
Also most important issue is there is no radio.
---
While i think the core elements of the game are really fun there is so much in the way that makes the game infuriating and unplayable and I am fairly certain this mode will be dead in a month even if they fix everything
---
High Off Radtoads!
---
I really hope they do. Not that I don't enjoy playing with randos but we are going to get wrecked when we go up against an organized team.
---
It even has a small garden and a playground with footballs (soccer, yeah I'm European).
---
Have you messed with the in files at all? You sometimes fall through when you do.
---
A game that relies on RNG to make it's weapons effective, is not balanced. Weapons should be viable because of player build/skill, not because they got lucky.
---
someones posted a vid, gives a fairly good impression of what to expect.
---
personally, never got far thru it before alarms started ringing and exited as soon as the perk cards came out. be your own judge.
---
U can favorite it in atomic shop to wear in nuclear winter
---
but did you GET THE PIE? those machines are such a tease.
---
You're getting down voted because this is the opposite of what someone should be complaining about. They're prioritizing function over fashion, being able to determine your opponents denenses at a glance over seeing their fancy atom shop outfit. If they did the opposite it would be a shit show of people with atom shop outfits being able to hide what armor they have and people screaming about how Bethesda prioritized cosmetics over everything.
---
Not that I know of
---
Everyone is different and your opinion is valid, lol. It's not for everyone and that's cool. No judgment here! I'm a mainstay in adventure mode and it'll stay that way, for the most part. But, when I do feel the need for some PVP, then I know that NW is the best bet for me to have the most fun.
---
one more: is tricentennial edition worth it?
---
Yeah man the best think is playing with what you find. On adventure and survival I have only god roll legendaries, mutations out the ass, more chems and ammo than I know what to do with. This is fun because it makes me/everyone use things we find in crates or loot bags after a kill. You have to play smart because who knows when you’re finding more ammo or stimpaks. The combat sniper rifle, I’ve had loads of them before.. never used them but in NW I realize it’s a pretty fun weapon. The challenge is a nice change. Being well over level 200 not much will challenge me, now a guy level 0 never playing can wreck me. 
---
And yeah you don’t have any worries about losing junk, caps and aid like in survival if that’s not your cup of tea.
---
If nobody datamined it yet, it's probably server-side and not something we can figure out. There are at least 100 overseer levels, and it becomes more difficult to level up after each one, so I doubt anybody's going to get you a full list before the pre-beta is over
---
Is it atop shop items only? My hunters long coat was made for this game mode :/ lol
---
A lot of players will try to attack you so you fight back, but they usually have more than one person around, either they’re confident in their gear of being op or they want to ambush you. Most of the time I would advise not to fight back with them.
---
The Nuclear Winter crossbows can hold 3 bolts, the adventure mode crossbow is unchanged
---
If you look outside the sub, it's still people bitching about it all over the place. That's cool. We don't need em. 😎
---
Its a good balance, and treating itself like a minigame and not a full title I think really sells the BR-accessability staple.
---
It was pretty awesome trolling around with 3 other dudes tactical as fricc
---
I enjoy reading about people's experience in the game like this :)
---
It's great how it sucks you in. The other day I dropped in for ten minutes to check something out at my base. Two hours later I was on the other side of the map running for my life from a gang of glowing anglers.
---
I agree...d about three or so hours ago, after I noticed a few things. The map is extemely, extremely small. Random loot, and random teams, often means you have lost before you even begin, wasting up to twenty minutes of the only life you have. I like a fair fight and being randomly asigned a partner who runs off the other direction, a knife, and some wooden armor, while plenty of my supposed rivals are randomly asigned competant team mates, a gatling laser and ammo, and spawn next to Liberty Prime just doesn't feel like fair play. (Either direction. It's not right if the shoe is on the other foot, either.)
---
Also, next match, look at how far your xp bar progresses, and then go see what level you have to be to enter the Overseers office. If you are a lore buff that last one will make you despair more than anything else.
---
You need 4 nuke codes and a launch briefcase.
---
Sorry, imeant different from other BR's
---
Unfortunately you will come across players like this, thankfully they are in the minority. (I assume this is in Adventure Mode?). Stick with it, I'm sure you'll encounter many more positive experiences than negative ones!
---
I can't argue that they could've done a better job with communicating but there are two points in the post (if I remember correctly) where they clearly state that the perks are not transferable to adventure mode.
---
For sure. I’m sure they will implement some things that will make the process smooth.
---
If you're looking for some fun quests while there I can recommend going to a train station and looking at the posters on the wall. I wouldn't recommend the pioneer scouts one until leveled up but the other two are great for lower levels!
---
LOL they're the "Iron armor/weapons" of fallout franchise. high weight, low value.
---
I seen the little briefcase icon was empty, just hadn’t came across one at all.. are they random spawns or found in chests or bodies?
---
Imo honestly the only system where the stuff isn't totally unfair to newer levels or less equipped is how destiny's is set up, so only endgame content is effected by gear levels. Its incredibly off putting to new players to get destroyed even though they might be better then the experienced counterpart.
---
You have to be in build mode at your C.A.M.P or work shop, when you're in build mode they will show up under food
---
Which ones you get from campfire?
---
sigh.. wouldn't be the first time :)
---
Thank you :)
---
Use a microphone, 90% of my matches the other guys started talking once i started talking.
---
So much easier to play when you communicate.
---
Vats will kill most of you, you need to play it like a fps sometimes with the natural scopes/iron scope. You'll get killer in survival and br modes. A lot of people can't live without vats in this game.
---
Is it weird that I started following them? I was like their Guardian Angel wearing a suit of T-51 Power Armor.
---
I wish you didn’t feel that way :( I just take it as it is - so many games feel incomplete these days - releasing with betas or early access for years and then you have repay for it (looking at you ark you piece of trash) like idk I guess it doesn’t bother me anymore because it feels like that is just how the industry is gonna be. I am just a very laid back person and I’m just happy for any content. I know they’re working hard but I also know they can do better but I feel like with wastelanders and stuff that there’s a lot to look forward to and we are going in the right direction. I hope one day maybe the game won’t make you upset anymore :(
---
Sit in a bush for 15 minutes and get to read some lore in a few months. Sounds amazing.
---
It doesn't change the core game experience. As far as I'm aware it just gives some exclusive cosmetics
---
I guess this is what happens when you go for that wider audience. You get fallout 4, an empty shell mp game, and then a fallout BR game to recoup costs.
---
This. Most people in adventure mode are friendly and try to help one another out in the wastes. You'll occasionally run across folks like this though. Just gotta learn to give them the thumbs up emoji (although I wish there was a f@&amp;k you emoji) and go back to doing what you were doing.
---
Some people are just dicks and do this. 90% of people you’ll see are super nice, and if you’re low level, they will often drop you waters and stimpacks or even make you a little suit of leather armor or something.
---
Also another game mode idea -
---
Sole Survivor. 30 new spawns vs 1 actual adventure character or a randomised uber character in armor and gear etc.
---
All the newbies are a team who have to gear up to try to take down the power armor player or prevent them from completing objectives, moving to certain areas or otherwise progressing.
---
King of the Hill or Capture the Vaultboy scenarios could also be worth it.
---
Can you just find quests via exploring?
---
Wrong. I killed a dude with a bone club when he was trying to kill me with a 50cal. 
---
Call it a wish bone!
---
Yes, but when I tried to favorite the mask and the hat it unfavorited the other one.  Tried it like three times.
---
Yup, it’ll ask you to examine stuff in buildings
---
I might be getting on myself
---
I appreciate the advice. Thanks :)
---
Yes my dumbass forgot to write "plan" but nevermind I got what I was looking for
---
Yeah this why I'm fine with jt
---
Man I don't know where you were but the whole internet freaked the hell out when 76 was leaked as multi-player last year
---
I get that man but I'm not being sarcastic. As someone who spent years playing pen and paper RPGs, there's tons of people who say they want to RP but I regularly find that if they aren't willing to put in any upfront effort then the chance of them lasting long enough to really matter is pretty low. 
---
I get you have a job, pretty sure most of us do or at the very least something else other than the game that requires effort. 
---
My suggestion was a legitimate solution to your request that can be done right now. Which is, use the tools provided and start RPing today. 
---
You'd rather someone else does the work because you don't feel you have the time, that's cool whatever. But I don't think that it's something that the devs should prioritize at this point when there's so many other things necessary. 
---
You posted your thoughts, I posted mine. Not really a debate. 
---
You do you man. Enjoy your life.
---
I actually support complete removal of PvP from adventure mode. Lets get shit straight. Fallout is a franchise with decades of tradition. Despite being an awesome setting for online interactions and PvP (F2 was supposed to be online but $$), majority of the playerbase comes with pretty 'single-player' or 'coop' expectations, and I believe these needs should be listened to. Us, the PvP minority are exactly this - a minority. Sure we want some stuff for ourselves and we received survival. Whoever initiates PvP on adventure is lame.
---
But the gear and build dependence doesn't make survival a mess. There's no single best build in this game, and despite majority of the playerbase being only aware of two character archetypes (sentinel/cavalier), there are four valid choices when it comes to armor selection, and lots of combinations with different weapons. Badly balanced game is a game where everybody is forced into single path or else indoubtly inferior. If people researched their stuff, the'd know the opinion that 'you need TSE + assassin/sentinel for PvP' is based on premises that are both structurally false and based on obsolete data. There is only one weapon currently in game that needs balance adjustments (or in fact range-parameter bugfix), and its Explosive Laser Rifle. Rest of the powerful gear is fine. When its a team of pro players fighting another team of pro players, the PvP on survival is excellent. I'm not surprised that when casuals are exposed to pros they go "what the fuck". But the fix for this situation is not via methods of balance adjustments, its via knowledge sharing. 
---
Below I linked my current PvP toon, it includes description of various PvP related mechanics which makes what I linked vastly superior than what is achieved by majority assassin/sentinel players, as its only a minority which knows that this set is only usefull on ranges above hundred meters. I don't use sentinel armor myself and my main gun is not explosive. I rock at PvP. Learn how, below:
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/imprezobus/
---
😂
---
Not even. It would be no different than the entire rest of the game
---
I'm not sure what mode I'm in :D. Thanks for answering
---
It should be easy to datamine doe.
---
I play PUBG most nights. I am prefering NW at the minute.
---
No I have a baby. When I play I try not to wake her up. Also sometimes she’s an ass hat and like to scream. It’s for my benefit as much as yours.
---
I agree, but I never started... Nor do I now, play fallout for its FPS characteristics. And I actually enjoy vats, more so on fallout 4 with the cinematic camera you get.
---
The areas are somewhat level locked. The forest is pretty much exclusively level 1-6 enemies, toxic valley and ash heap tend to be around 16-20 with rare level 30-40 enemies, savage divide is 30-60, and then the mire/cranberry bog usually spawn max level enemies. There are plenty of quests and events to do in each area, so the game assumes you're leveling somewhere around that pace as you go to each area
---
The whitesprings is a very high level area. You don't have to do the other faction quests but you will struggle because the enclave is the last faction you're supposed to meet.
---
Yeah, I agree
---
I think it is just called Plan: Cabinets - I am pretty sure I’ve seen them on Grahm before but you might go to white springs and check all the vendors there to see if they have it
---
Well you have to follow the main questline to join the enclave lol. That doesn't mean you can't to off on your own and level up. 
---
Also, the area should level up to the highest level person in that area. So if you are the first person to get to white spring (before some like...level 100 or something) then the critters around that area should be closer to your level. If you're having issues with it just hop servers until things are leveled to you.
---
Honestly, I can deal with the random nature, and the PvP itself. It's more the latter point that is bugging me. The gate the lore is locked behind is so extreme that I honestly don't see anyone but the most hardcore PvPers (who, honestly, are probably playing a different game) ever seeing it.
---
Yep. Way more issues with game crashes and trolls on console than pc. I am on PC and get maybe 1 crash every few weeks. I have also not had to deal with people baiting mobs into my camp or killing me repeatably for now real benefit.
---
&gt;I’m afraid that BR content will take priority over Adventure mode
---
Did we watch the same E3 trailer? Because i remember that they showed a full blown addon where you get a new main story,side quests,vault raids, settlements, npc:s, choices, dialogue options, companions etc etc etc
---
Then they showed a BR mode, now if you compare those two has the br gotten more effort from the devs?
---
Only if you're particularly fond of patriotic clothing options. Otherwise you'd be better off buying the limited edition 1500 caps and elder jacket bonus pack and buying something that fits your style.
---
Would be impossible on console, we can already run too fast for game loading in objects and buildings lol
---
It's more even in terms of play. The other PvP mode I spawn into and die after a few minutes if I'm not hiding since level 50 and  don't have many legendaries. 
---
Still more into PvE, but the new mode is a lot better for PvP. Vats still works for AI enemies though
---
This is exactly how I felt. I rolled my eyes and joined a match because "Hey, it's new content, might as well check it out"
---
15 matches later I can say that this is probably my favorite update so far.
---
I am glad that you came back man. I hope you get a lot of enjoyment out of it! I am pretty excited for everything myself. I’m not good at pvp and I’ve been dying a lot in NW but it’s fun
---
Even in Vault 51. Just have maybe 20 players. Every dweller for themselves. Just have the ZAX using lasers to kill everything in rooms "outside". The safe area.
---
So this is common?
---
It's seriously horrible, I cannot unnotice it now.
---
Icons.... I think a loot crate would be better. lol
---
I don’t use the ultracite it’s to expensive to maintain and I would rather use those resources elsewhere. I primarily use the X01 and the T60 (when I built it it was the easiest to find the mods for). I also use the excavator armor a lot when picking throw led deposits for the bonus.
---
To be fair, this is the only glitch I've ran into so far. 
---
Sure there's some issues I'm experiencing with freezes but I'm just assuming it's because of the xbox/consoles.
---
Like a freeze when you try to use a quick placeable object,
---
 sometimes when you loot too fast your game freezes for a second (i don't know if that's how it works, I was getting chased by someone when i didn't have a gun and managed to get inside a house and loot a box, i spammed pretty hard on the a button so I'm guessing it kinda glitched it and froze me for a few seconds, unfortunately when it came back there was a guy teabagging me in my downed state)
---
Like the guy above said, it's technically a beta without that many issues, especially compared to launch...
---
One of the terminals in 52 makes mention of an x-02 pa.  Wonder if that is one of the unlockables.  Says it was delivered vault 51
---
I'm level 360 and the hardest part for me is not being able to pick up more than a couple of things lol. Also remembering to use what I pick up asap because I could die any second and you can't take it with you!
---
Definitely. Sucks being booted to the menu, waiting to enter a server, loading in, waiting those few minutes for prep, and then the final load into the match. If they could cut out some of that wait time it wouldn't feel like it takes so long.
---
Also, I suck ass and have lasted less time in a couple matches than I did loading into them. Maybe that's why it feels so long.
---
I have a feeling some of those will have the X-02 plans that the vault received.
---
I know where to get a combat shotgun and 50cal without fail
---
Good it wasn’t just me lol I made my husband who’s level 50 something go with me to help kill the miners 😂
---
I downvoted you because this definitely should not be "fixed" 
---
It would be bullshit to be in a Battle Royale game where you have no visual clue what armor anyone is wearing.
---
No problem - oh and don't feel like you have to apologise for enjoying the free trial, nor are you thick or horrid, you are just new to the game. I hope the rest of the trial goes much better for you.
---
I really liked spawning at the bridge and it’s kind of intense if you spawn at the creamery because a lot of people spawn at the camp on the other end of the bridge so you never know if they’re gonna be coming to you and I’ve almost always had a fight there so it feels like a good spot
---
Is it jsut me or did performance inprovr on the PS4?
---
Recently Installed 76 about 2 or 3 days ago and olayed a bit with really choppy frames. After the nuclear wibter update came out, i immideatly notice a boost in performance.
---
Some times it only takes one secs.
---
I ran around like a twat for 2 mins looking for an armour workbench as I could see other players wearing apparel that was not the vault 51 jumpsuit.
---
Turns out you assign your NW favourite in the atomic shop.  2 mins was not enough time to figure this out.
---
Yep atom shop only right now
---
Hit up the Tyler county fairgrounds and the workshop at the dirt track. Full of low level scorched and ghouls. Make sure you have a melee weapon and just go nuts. You’ll get a good amount of scrap and some ammo and guns, and then if you have 25 caps, take the dirt track workshop. It’ll spawn mobs if ghouls or mole rats or something easy and you can grind a couple levels worth of XP
---
I’d like it if you could explore the lore of that place, and when you go inside there is a terminal that lets you queue up for a match while you explore.
---
Same here. I found it to be more of a sign that says "Shoot Me First."

That sucks man, I'm guessing you're pc? You'd think you'd have a way to message strangers like we do on console.
---
Maybe next time suggest giving email address or something if you think you'll want to play with someone again?
---
As for your issue I can't be any help, good luck 🤞
---
I have 10 or so photos of that stage with different groups of people on the stage, take a photo nearly every time I go in there
---
Only did a few games, my teammates were running alone on their own, and would leave me alone against a squad while they escaped
---
doesnt tell much
---
I seem to be having a similar problem, I had space before (very little but still space). Tried placing down some new WV stuff, get told I’ve exceeded budget, I delete one of my neon billboards and a water purifier. No luck. Put my other billboard in storage with the other one before I deleted it. Placed it back down from storage, now I can’t connect a wire.
---
Why fix something that isn’t broke? Is there a way to directly tell Bethesda that this is a problem?
---
My same experience. I started doing the No Auto Team ... and I'm having more fun, a lot less time worrying about people.
---
I realize I'm crossing streams here, but the best radio host in the history of video games imo was Mr. Torgue. He's not doing anything until September, can we get him on a short term contract?
---
Yeah but this is not adventure mode.. 
---
Why do you want everybody hopping on the match in full blown marine armor and you have no way of telling if they are wearing armor at all?
---
naw, were you guys mic’d up? i try gift items but then everyone new seems to run away and just do their own thing
---
&gt; and also that some thinks auto-assign (but can be changed) to the favorites to make things faster
---
the latter has been added, hasn't it?  certainly when i was playing NW this morning, every item i collected automatically got added to my favourites wheel..  it seemed to do it intelligiently as well, adding weapons clockwise from the top, and aid anti-clockwise (although this may not be the case and it just looked that way because spaces appeared on my wheel when i dropped items)..
---
I disabled the mic from the start at release. Now it has push to talk, I re-enabled it. I can see that I am transmitting, but my team cannot hear me for some reason.
---
It is actually really good. Fallout br I mean
---
Surprisingly this is the most fun I’ve had in any game in a while. 
---
I’m trying to get at least 30 if not 50 by the end of the week. 
---
My job is 12 hour shifts so I have a lot of time to myself. Which is a curse in itself.
---
Imagine wanting to meet the enclave in F3, but not wanting to be “dragged along like a wazzock” and go find your dad.
---
Not to interested in the NW content, however the trailer for it was very entertaining! Can't wait for Wastelanders....
---
&gt;Well you have to follow the main questline to join the enclave lol
---
Not true, you can start it at any time - although going to "the cave" at level 5 isn't recommended.
---
Go on....
---
I’m sure we all have duped items. Especially everyone who has played since launch.
---
This aint like the rest of the game.
---
Why dont you suggest at the same time that they add sentinel armor and bloodied explosive weapons to game..
---
For real invisible armor is stupid AF when it comes to a br game where you could just bait people into thinking you are not wearing anything.
---
&gt; the whole advancement and itemization system also isn't leveraged to allow you to build some kind of specific interesting character but simply to raise your stats until the game balance breaks and you're oneshotting bosses.
---
This is untrue on every level. I only consider there to be two bosses currently, SBQ and ISS, neither of which can be 1 shot. You absolutely can, and many **have** used the item and level system to make themed characters for fun. This is a game, play it how you want. Raising your stats has very little to do with 1 shotting anything unless you're a melee build. 
---
Besides, about one shotting high level mobs, what part of that is broken game balance? It's end game power, I can only assume since they gave us all these tools it was all intended to work this way. Just because it doesn't please **you** doesn't mean it's broken or not working well. You're coming off as very holier than thou, because the devs aren't idiots, they knew how strong some of this stuff would be and it's pretty easy to obtain most of it.
---
&gt; some people will never get anything that is good
---
No, everyone gets good stuff, and fairly often. Some people will never get the best of the best and that's only right imo. If that shit was easy to get, then whats the point of farming? If you didn't get it quickly, someone else would and you could get it cheap. Over saturation reduces value of the best items, if they made drops easier to get they'd have to remove trading. Pick your poison and quit complaining about things you haven't put any real thought into.
---
It never allowed me to equip multiple.  only one.
---
Yeah Zoe’s quests start out easy but get hard really quick
---
The thing about this mode, is that it is team oriented. So, communication is key. I don't mind talking to randoms, but christ...please have a mic! I don't know how many games I went into yesterday that either no one had a mic, or maybe one or two teammates had mics, but no one bothered to say anything. Everyone needs one for BR. It's pretty essential, for a team activity. 
---
And, I noticed the same for people spawning in before me and I have a decent system myself
---
CPU: Ryzen 2600
---
RAM: 16GB DDR4 3200 memory
---
GPU: Nvidia GTX 1060 3GB
---
Along with the game installed on a M.2 SSD. There were still a few times I was still loading in and saw others already wielding weapons, lol. So it was like "OH SHIT, GO GO GO GO GO!"
---
Honestly I'm glad they didn't just not add the terminals and tapes, it was the first thing I seen on my first time in the lobby and thought "this is super cool" and I would not have grinded rank 6 if the first holo tape wasn't there :p
---
Also: it takes so long for me to join a match. It can't be a connection issue--I have good connection and can play Adventure Mode with Discord without any issues. One time, it took me a full 10 minutes to just join a match.
---
seems unlikely, but who knows...I believe it must be random.
---
Any weapons boxes etc..I have opened all over the map have good items and i end up with the same gear every time.
---
While a perfectly valid statement, I'm not sure how that helps translate the "balance" of NW into the other game modes.
---
The requirements and constraints are totally different between NW and the other game mods. How would you " make the balancing of adventure and survival more like this" as the OP asked?
---
How do you choose your team? I can't even play with  friends from my own list, let alone team up on purpose with strangers...
---
This, I want this.
---
Also no vats teleporting. I was curious how melee would play out in BR.
---
Ok dude I didn’t say immediately. And yes we did. We finally got those human NPCs that people shit on Bethesda for not putting in the game at the start (because they’re dumb fans and don’t understand progressive storytelling).
---
I killed someone with a cultist blade, and in turn was nearly killed by someone with a board.
---
Well lucky for you the same game you do enjoy playing is still there.
---
This happens to PC as well.
---
Thank you. Sounds awesome.
---
Not necessarily. You don't need a mic for apex. While it defiantly helps their pinging system is amazing
---
Did you follow the instructions? Seems there's already a Bethesda account with your email. So just follow the instructions to reset your password.
---
While I agree there are options - the powerful players with top tier gear - in your case the VATS crit rifles - still do the best.  Do agree that Survival can be made better but as long as there’s gear and builds dependence I’ll never consider it as a skills based PvP mode.  Really not interested in BR myself but its more dependent on map knowledge and you start each match on more even terms.
---
Because launching a nuke is end game and produces the SBQ, I always associated the Enclave questline as being the "main questline".
---
For me as soon as the released the battle royal I dug it’s grave and buried it in the back of my mind right next to what my geometry homework was for today. At least with betas you know your getting, an work in progress. But fallout 76 was released and marketed as complete when quite frankly it was a unfinished, broken game.
---
On that note, it's also a really great way to keep the player driven economy going. Rare weapons and outfits being traded allows players to gain and spend caps constantly, keeping the wheel moving and adding a whole other layer to what keeps people playing.
---
The one I found was just sitting on a table in a house. So I assume they are all just put in the open unless you pick it off a dead body.
---
The Mire.
---
I have reset password and even trued the site but still no luck .apparently I can link a "quick account " but have no clue how
---
In my experience, they have been taking things like this seriously. I had one instance where someone added me and tried to sell me stuff for real money. Recorded it all and reported it. Another time someone added me and was following me around and shooting me with a paintball gun. Took screenshots and reported it. Both screen names are still on my friends list still and never online anymore. I can only assume they were banned / suspended.
---
last time is was a dead drop in the main overseers cache with a crap ton of ammo. I think I want to set a whole stage where we are talking on microphone when the drink it. to hear to the reaction and then fast travel to the new location and video the response. I would likely be apologetic to the nasty joke and probably find something to gift. I dont know how early in the game I started fast travelling, so I dont know if anyone under Lvl 5 knows they can fast travel free back to vault 76...
---
someone had posted here or elsewhere seeing a very low level player wandering aimlessly south of the cranberry bog. I wonder if they were victim to this prank.
---
Yeah, but that wasn't any part of the hate that FO76 got **at launch**, that was all done and over with well before. It got brought up often by some videos and journalists, but less as a criticism and more as just a talking point about why people might be further disappointed in the game.
---
I've been spawning in the orchard every time, and there are definitely patterns. Either the toolbox in the barn or the safe in the upstairs of the house will always be lockpickable, and the other will be inaccessible. There is a good chance of a rare crate in the upstairs, and a high chance of there being power armor either in that same upstairs or in the barn. Might be just my luck but the rare crate, if it's there almost always has either an automatic handmade or automatic laser rifle.
---
&gt;I have finished adventure mode with 2 characters
---
What?!? There is no "finish" to adventure mode.
---
I grab it all... then let them know what extra I have when im near them and if im dropping what weapons I do not need.
---
What are you on? Xbox, ps4, pc?
---
One of the perk cards is ironclad, I believe. Gives you a boost to defense without wearing PA. So yeah, marine and scout armor seems to be the two best at the moment, couple that with ironclad and you're pretty hard to take down.
---
They really do need to fix directional sound, though.  I was playing last night and kept hearing phantom footsteps of my teammate behind me, but they were in front of me.  Might be some desync issue?
---
"If anyone has tips on how to desensitize self from dying too much, that'd be great. :D"
---
If you want to desensitize yourself about dying, the best way is.... to die a lot.
---
With that in mind, pick a spawn point you KNOW will have lots of players, and as soon as you spawn run straight into the thick of it. Grab a gun, or swing the fists, but be hyper aggressive.
---
Chances are, you will die in the first minute. That's fine. Jump in another game, do the same thing.
---
By the end of the evening you'll have died a ton of times, and dying wont be this scary thing, you'll be used to it.
---
Next day play properly - pick a sensible spawn, pick fights you think you'll win, but you wont have a crippling fear of dying
---
Thanks boss 👍🏼
---
..... always getting done from behind by a stranger!
---
I feel like you are willfully missing my point.
---
Haha yeah I understand that 😂 I was picking up everything the first match and then realized I could only carry 115 pounds haha! And in other modes I always forget chems but once I pick them up now I just pop them to be ready. Very different than what we’ve been playing that’s for sure
---
Agreed-  this fixes most everything that kept me from liking and playing survival. Everybody starts on an even footing, and i don't leave my aid or junk on the ground when i die.
---
Every queue i joined was full of players, and when i went back to adventure mode to collect my daily vendor caps and do some challenges, the player count was DEAD. Maybe just because it was the first day and everybody was trying it out, but seemed like everybody was playing BR.
---
This is a win for Bethesda.
---
True, the ping system is excellent
---
For the SBQ (I am bloodied) I use power armor with emergency protocols, I have as many heavy gunner perk cards as possible, max stabalized, bloody mess, born survivor and nerd rage. I use one gun army to cripple her then swap back to bloody mess once that's done. 
---
I live under 20% health the entire fight and very rarely do I go down during any SBQ fight. If you wanted to I guess you could throw in serendipity.
---
I do still have to spam the occasional stimpak but generally it's easy going. Only thing that's dangerous to me is the rad scorpions it seems, the poison is very fast acting. 
---
The gun is a prime bloodied faster fire rate 50 cal.
---
I love the marine wetsuit but it’s an underarmor. We need an outfit counterpart for sneaky characters. 
---
The Chinese Stealth suit would be amazing, personally I would love to see the assassin suit return too.
---
You can turn off the "fill team" option if you want! I played solo and still had a great time, it even has its advantages (like being able to hide and ambush more effectively, not sharing loot to get best items, etc) although you cannot be revived by a teammate
---
XD same and especially when you say you are going to get off and released a few hour pass. I give myself a list of task to do and when a nuke launches 3 times in a row, I can't leave those at all. It's fun playing with others. First game to enjoy playing online with others too.
---
See, I think the randomized legendary system is very important from a company standpoint, and to an extent, for players to feel like they really got something special when a good one drops. They need to keep people grinding and we eat it up. The only issue I have with heavy RNG systems in MMOs is that often times, the systems overshadow any guaranteed gear that's worthwhile. If they had something akin to raid weapons, powerful pieces with set perks that you can either grind for or just straight up earn in an activity upon completion, I think that would help nullify the feeling that you're not gonna get anything good unless you're lucky.
---
Are you on PC?
---
I can't speak to 76 (I haven't looked into it), but for many games you are correct.  It is *possible* to write the games in a way that you have a lot of separate files that are referenced by the main game file while it's running, and there are advantages to that (such as this, smaller updates), but there are also disadvantages.  
---
Plus, once you've gotten the thing up and running, switching between the two methods isn't something that is easily accomplished.  It can be a *ton* of extra work.
---
If FO4 was as you say, it's no surprise that 76 is, since 76 is really just a modified version of FO4.
---
Then you probably need to open a ticket.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Wow, thanks for the input I had no clue I was playing the game incorrectly.
---
After 30 games you have enough time in those 2 minutes, believe me xD
---
highly highly highly doubt.
---
It is like it but even more.
---
Lower level gear without charisma and perks yield next to no caps, but after you stop earning mods by scrapping you can sell them.
---
For a steady income of caps:
---
Sell all junk items which have only one component like ceramic or cloth 
---
Pick and sell any burned magazine or books.
---
Sell excess food and chems.
---
Sell excess grenades, throwing knives can be better dps wise, only lack the aoe damage. Crafted at weapons workbench and cost steel.
---
Also get green thumb and harvest blackberries.
---
Each pick yields 2 caps in a vendor.
---
Pick every outfit and sell it.
---
Go near workshops and clear them of enemies when the quest is added to you journal, but don't take it - the quest reeards you 20 caps.
---
Also do events and quests as much as you can.
---
And there are even more methods you will find them out soon. :)
---
And welcome, Nukashine toast to you!
---
I keep saying “make survival rust” and getting some down votes but I think NW proved me right :)
---
question, are the firefights longer because of slower ttk or just weaker weapons? I'm really used to fast ttk games and usually don't have much fun with games with slower ttk, and I'm a bit worried nuclear winter might be the same.
---
Seems like this vault wanted to rear up risk takers
---
Ah, that's cool, I didn't know that. It would still be cool if there was a solo option so no one had the team advantage.
---
Ah, apologies for misunderstanding you
---
Never been thinking about implementing PA in this build, do you use alot of those stims? I get through a really hard run with around 20 max, mostly less.
---
With nuclear winter having 52 players per game I reckon it could be a future possibility
---
it's ok, first couple of matches were fun but it became stale quickly, also good luck to you if you dont have friends that play the game anymore like i do, you will be stuck with people with constant mic on or no one communicating at all, so far i still have to meet an enemy npc
---
i mean then...jump in?
---
Is anyone still doing nukes? :P
---
I ran around last night (after I got tired of being reminded how bad I am at pvp :P ), and rarely saw more than a couple people over level 30.  I wasn't even able to find more than a couple camps that had vending open.
---
I'm sure it will level back out once the free week and the NW test is over.
---
The terminal at sunshine meadows next to the food processor seems to always be working
---
You have a long ways to go. Btw those workshops disable pacifist mode. 
---
Besides there will always be palyers who want to steal workshops. If someone owns it, I leave it alone but I ask if I can trade. Even if the player is lower level than me.
---
Make Woobie a new raid boss comparable to the SBQ
---
Can't lay down
---
This error code either means you are banned or the game still thinks you are trying to play BETA. Do a scan and repair from the launcher options. If that does not work, you are banned.
---
Sure, and people do that. There is no reason to allow Atom Shop outfits but not outfits anyone can wear though, right? Can you think of a single good reason that doesn't involve dollar sign cartoon eyes?
---
I've been playing since BETA and I've only run as part of a team about five times up to now: this game is definitely not multiplayer only :-p  I'm very sorry to hear about your technical difficulties
---
&gt;layed for maybe 5 minutes
---
Way to give it the good ol' college try there, kid!
---
I went in expecting to never even try it. I tried it. I suck terribly at it, as expected, but it was pretty fun. I liked making a little progress even though i didn't do very well. I've always hated BR, but i want to play more NW tonight, so i guess they did something right.
---
I think he means 7 cards total but they could be all in a category
---
The best we could ever hope for, would be mounts.
---
It was expected, that is how "gAmErS" work.
---
Beth announces a game, people get mad it doesn't have npc:s
---
Beth announces npc:s, people get mad they weren't there when it launched
---
Beth adds npc:s people get mad about the next thing.
---
Its cycle, if you are dedicated on hating something, you will figure out how to hate anything they do.
---
Yeah but don't rng play a big role in BR? Gears you pick up, spawn locations, whether the ring shrink to your favor and stuff... those are all rng and somehow people seem to be okay with that but can't stand rng when it comes to legendaries. People gotta make up their mind
---
PS4
---
&gt;minutemen
---
There's a settlement that needs your help
---
Yes, Go on....
---
You can add me English-Jimmy... won’t be on till 3ish eastern
---
Bicycles!!
---
A little incentive is fine. I agree. Hell, make it so your team has to win a match, but don't gate the story behind an unrealistic goal.
---
Hater here, ready for downvotes. Even if the game is massively better then it was at launch, I personally tried and failed to love this game. After grinding though bugs and crashes, the wife just looked at me and asked "are we even having fun?" Simply put, no I wasn't and havnt touched it since. With so many fantastic games in my backlog and even more dropping in the coming months I can't redownload it with this bitter taste in my mouth. If you're having fun I'm legit happy for you, but I'm not visiting fo76 any time soon.
---
This needs 10,000,000,000 upvotes
---
I mean, if the level was lower people would be complaining that there is no reason to play the mode.
---
Its a lose lose situation for Bethesda.
---
Also you get XP just from playing, you don't need to be good but it will just take a bit longer
---
I spawn at Ft. Prickett and usually find a power armor chassis and a heavy gun (Gatling or .50 Cal)
---
Would be dope!
---
Bonus points if we can jump spam them up mountains.
---
What should I do though in the meantime, I need better weapons and armor to progress the story
---
The best part is the chance that they wake up and stagger around in a part of the map they should absolutely not be f'ing around in at their level.
---
I miss the working punchbowl so much... (Nightey Night!)
---
Okay I made one of those now wait?
---
It's ok, my partner uses rad x.
---
true, but look how long PvP has been in Beta...could be a while.
---
Significantly. One of the best value packages out there. If you get hooked, there's 100s of hours here.
---
Skyrim horse effect! Lol
---
It's interesting to play but a bit tedious when it disconects me from the server &amp; I'm stuck on the main screen repeatedly hitting play &amp; nothing happens
---
Why is nuclear winter more stable and less buggy than the normal game
---
I launch several a day until yesterday. Couldn’t find anybody higher than level 50 to help me out after hopping a few servers. I assume once the Nuclear Winter beta is over everything will go back to normal.
---
Hahahaha
---
Top secret friend, my crew did find a noce spot. 😁
---
In the meantime until my Gun-fu is returned to me I will slot in extra Sneak
---
Since nuclear winter is only here for a week it wouldnt be in beta when it releases
---
Nuka Dark wasn't really even Bethesda, that was Silver Screen Bottling that made and sold it. Yet Bethesda caught almost all the shit for it. I suppose it's like with most other boners: when a person gets a hate boner, all logic and reason leave the building.
---
For all the complaints about the packaging the stuff smells nice and tastes good. Not like rum at all, but if it were a regular product at a normal price I would likely buy and drink enough of it to warrant an intervention.
---
I think they are keeping it even by one skill card in a slot. Could be wrong.
---
I’m having fun, so I’d say true
---
Nice? :/
---
Watoga
---
Same, got a good place, and I'm not telling you.
---
Better get plenty of 'bufftats' ready
---
Okay now what ?
---
Different areas have different level enemies, which is why the areas around vault 76 where the player first is are lower level enemies. To reach enclave fastest just follow the quest
---
It is technically the main quest line. You can just start it at any time if you don't wish to finish the quest line.
---
The icons are in the atom shop.
---
Yes but I only use diluted stimpaks, and I only use PA For that fight.
---
Yeah, for example I got iron clad and lifegiver which are both solid perks so I just took out pickpocket, your allowed 7 perks in total not depending.
---
U would spawn on the ground below
---
The game is not locked at all even though there are a few places with recommended levels, and depending on your skill you can go anywhere at anytime: the Enclave can be joined very quickly if you know the way or are willing to Google the path, though as most of their missions look like they involve fighting things if you want to be an enclave footsoldier you should focus on learning how survive the local wildlife first
---
You can change your display name with an option from soooomewhere in account management on the website, I changed mine the other day, you can only do it once every 3 months
---
nerd rage is almost essential, radicool for melee. serendipity helps a ton when dealing with high level enemies. the rest of the cards can really just depend on what build you’re going for (melee, rifles, heavy guns etc).
---
You can still get stealth boys, i think they're only in high tier loot chests though, I've only seen two in the entirety of the mode.
---
You have to play adventure to level up your special. Then you come back to NW and can put higher tier or more perk cards on in a given special.
---
You right.  My bad.
---
Oh, thanks for the insight, but I’m gonna n console so I’m not sure how that works
---
I plan on using a variety of automatic rifles and heavy guns, sometimes a railway rifle but I can live without it if needed
---
I just almost solo'd it protecting 1 animal lol. Took down the level 100 by myself. The only time I go down there is on my own and leave if others join ha.
---
yeah the music in 4 is amazing
---
That fair. Can I ask what makes it special? Tactical? Loot? Not trying to take your spot. Just curious what people look for.
---
No I think they're all tier but they're just not that op anymore
---
There is no hellfire armor in FO4.
---
&gt;Just because it doesn't please you doesn't mean it's broken or not working well.
---
And just because it pleases you doesn't mean it does.
---
You're an extreme minority sitting in an echochamber here. The vast majority of people have long given up on this game over issues like I'm describing, and you'll be hard pressed to find a game that doesn't do things drastically differently. 
---
Every dying game has small group of angry true believers squatting on it, lashing out at anyone trying to administer CPR.
---
Ah yep I play on PC :/ 
---
What system are you playing on? Maybe someone who knows will come along
---
Same, I join as they are choosing where to spawn...disconnect
---
Tried hard to convince myself to use it but couldn’t lol
---
I shouldn't say
---
Play the damn game, nobody can tell if you're going to like it.
---
you need to remove the perk card manager.ba2 file  until it is updated.
---
You can't just FT away immediately - you have to hang around the newbs and teach them how to play "PICK UP THE F'ING BAG!"
---
Xbox, thanks anyway tho
---
There's a giant sign that says that in the middle of the room, which you can even click on to bring you to the atomic shop. IMO 2 mins was way more than enough to figure out this feature that is in no way impactful.
---
It's all good man, we're having short form conversations, it's hard not to misunderstand people on reddit at least occasionally.
---
The game is a little better, but still is a huge pile of crap. With friends like that, who needs friends?
---
So that’s how to do it! I also was clicking on anything and everything trying to find a place to change my clothes 😂
---
This would be a huge QOL improvement, I feel like 75% of my experience is in loading screens because I am t e r r i b l e at battle royale games. But I'm having a ton of fun.
---
I wish you could level up your special in NW also.  I have so many cool cards that I wish I could use but probably never will. I haven’t touched adventure since beta
---
I’m clearly too busy being punched by 51 others.
---
If you want them fixed, then yeah you need to list them all. And have you tried the known workarounds? The most basic fix: unequip and re equip the cards. Log off and back on. Ect.
---
You won't be able to kill the deathclaws to get the key, but if you want to try search for Abandoned waste dump and head there. You don't have to do any of the quests but you won't be much use to the enclave as a scrub
---
I didn't have my headset hooked up but the 120 did.
---
But you CAN
---
i think its more like
---
Beth:  “anything constructive to add to the discussion?”
---
you: “ this is not what i want from your games.”
---
Beth: “But a lot of people are playing and enjoying it, the lobbies are always full.”
---
you: “ its already decidedly terrible, its not where my company should go.”
---
Beth: “its our company, we’ll run it thanks.”
---
I would have liked to  have had the BOS in  the Wastelanders DLC as an option to side with.  As it is, it looks like our only options are siding with raiders or the minute men (yeah they don't actual say "minute men" but come on). 
---
I hate raiders and the only 'help' settlers need is eradicating abominations and making sure dangerous technology stays out of the wrong hands (the wrong hands being settlers' hands and the right hands being mine).
---
Also if you play with mods then wtf lol. Of course theres gonna be bugs.
---
Think I did it gave it my spare email .seems happy .thank u much for the help .hope to c u in game :D
---
Lockpick skill... research center. That's all I'm gonna say
---
itll still be good for a few quick levels now and again,lolz
---
This deserves an upvote!
---
That sounds like something a synth would ask.
---
I disagree, I don't think every part of the game should be so casual that you don't have to do anything for a reward. The people who were interested in the Royale will get it all naturally just by playing a part of the game they enjoy.
---
I don't nuke things so I don't get to use flux in my crafting, I'm not going to be upset that I don't have a decon arch because I know I don't play that specific content. But I can see them add more/lowering the requirements for the lore
---
Hell that would kinda kill the whole MMO "I'm flexing on you" feeling lol
---
The only thing going for survival at this point is legendary items. But it seems like far more people hate playing against them than enjoy playing with them, so yeah survival might be dead once the full NW launches
---
They're completely different modes.
---
There are patterns
---
Yup, the naming option really only applies to the save files locally. So if you have more than one character you can sort them easily. Many players have mule accounts, these are lvl 1 or 2 accounts that we use to store extra items we don't want to lose but can't really afford the added weight in our storage. So you team with a trusted friend, hand them your items to store, log out, change to the mule and log back in. Said friend then gives you the items back. Put in mule stash and log back in as your primary account. I have played since beta and have 3 live accts with a total of 12 mules all maxed out right now lol darn game is addictive.
---
Maybe I should amend the earlier post. The OP was talking about their sex life specifically so I didn’t think I needed to go into detail. 
---
“once you log (put a ring on it) in the whole map (body)is open to explore. later leveling (getting old) actually opens different game modes (sexy game time). but no matter how long you wait, some vaults like 94 may never open. “—- anal
---
You didnt make a point. You just whined that you didnt like the mode. I dont like the idea of survival mode. At all. Havent been in there once. I miss out on exclusive weapons but whatever. Some people like that mode, more power to them. I just stick to the parts of the game I do like.
---
Where are you in the main quest? What lvl are you?
---
This exactly, the idea that in a wasteland environment my pipboy may aim my guns for me just feels wrong. 
---
Bought the game because I like its wasteland survival theme (never played other FO before), so I try to rely on the basics.
---
Just about every game works that way though, even way back in COD you’d get an assist but only the final kill shot counts as a kill. It makes sense to me.
---
Bear Lamp &gt; Fish Lamp.
---
I think what Nuclear winter shows us is that legendary gear is the bane of balanced PvP. The allure of NW is that it's faster paced combat with everyone starting on equal footing.
---
Survival mode was almost screwed from the start when they let people come in with all their godmode gear.
---
Wow that loot list sucks ass
---
Because they are still tweaking the mechanics of it
---
I’m level 14 and I’m on the missing link
---
The only thing i am going to tell you: your friend is not actually your friend. Who the hell calls someone racist for not liking the same game as they do!?
---
This comment right here, Bethesda.
---
I think Survival Mode will probably keep getting worked on, and fill the role of the standard FO76 experience with higher stakes. I saw a decline in regulars last night, as it was mostly low levels in Survival Mode, but today I've seen lots of 250+ get back in there to kill one another.
---
I think NW will probably be the centre of attention for a while, but don't think it'll negatively impact Survival Mode long term. If anything, more people who steered clear of Survival might be encouraged to go check it out if they enjoy the PvP in NW :)
---
Theres generally 4 or so different kinds of loot but you gotta hustle because its on the edge of the map. Not fond kf that part.
---
it never ends well of console players in fps games though :/
---
Your both wrong..he means the two hole.
---
&gt; You're an extreme minority sitting in an echochamber here.
---
I'm really not, most of the people here echo your sentiments, so you can stop using reddit buzzwords to feel smart. I'm not making the argument for or against the system as it stands you can knock that shit off right now too. My point was that for your own views there are other peoples views who differ. For all the game could have been, this is what it is and you babbling about whatever on reddit isn't CPR. And by the way, take a look around the reddit and the games community, it's one of the chillest most fun group of people I've played multiplayer games with, no one is angry. This game isn't dying, it's just starting, take your extremist alarmist bullshit elsewhere, thanks.
---
Do you have PS+?
---
old bug, probably unrelated
---
Can confirm gun fu is borked, on level 1, 2 and 3 of the card.
---
I like to mix it up. Arktos is cool, as is the acrobatic place in the middle of the map, although I haven't made it to the top of the tower yet. I started in Helvetia once, which was ok. Near Vault 76 is good. I spawned near the edge by the mine once and had to run with my arse on fire because I spent too long trying to jump into a train with a crate in it. I won that time, so it was worth it.
---
I think you're looking for /missedconnections
---
Free trial until the 17th, go make your own decision.
---
I sa2 one my first game
---
Do you have things like radios or the jukebox in your CAMP?  What happens if you remove them and try again?
---

---
This 100%. Matchmaking and balancing of what server you get into on survival and adventure should match what's happening in Nuclear Winter. I'd be much more likely to play Survival more often if I had the feeling I could actually survive like in NW.
---
RifleGaming posted a video to his YouTube channel of him dropping one. Unfortunately he dropped it too close and killed his team.
---
Right! 
---
Just because I run around in blood soaked Imposter Sheepsquatch skins and have a Purple Mohawk don't assume I'm evil!!
---
*i just like fashion!*
---
I can't live without Marsupial Mutation, but NW is surprisingly fun for somebody who doesn't like BR games.
---
So, if you want to take a break from the main quest, until you lvl some more just explore, and get side quests and do events that pop up
---
A video of gameplay of this is: https://youtu.be/v45wg395umc
---
Yes, very little countdown, smallish circle. Saw it take out an entire team tho!
---
Any specific areas I should explore?
---
Head a round into nuclear winter mode and hold your hands near the ring of fire. Should do it.
---
Launching a nuke definitely isn't endgame unless doing so removed all of the quest-related Overseer's logs from your inventory: it seems more like a long tutorial to level you up to 50. The game's not even fully out of BETA yet; we should definitely hold off and see where it goes before announcing that we've gotten to the endgame content!
---
"Aw ye, I've got my X01 and my TSE weightless handmade! Just launched a nuke and killed the Queen! Endgame!!"  *sees two players walking around with NW-skinned X02 armour, using 4-star weapons, playing through the Wastelander update and following the continuing Overseer's storyline*
---
Yeah, it wiped out three squads, then the ones that dropped it killed my squad
---
Probably stay in the forest zone for now... and check you map often and fast travel to events that pop
---
Part of the fun is simply using what you come across. If you like a certain weapon, say a hunting rifle, _scrap_ every one you find (except the one you’re using). This is how your character learns the mods for it. 
---
At level 11, you can begin choosing the Gunsmith perks. They allow you to mod your rifle with mods you couldn’t use before: upgrading damage, range, and recoil. 
---
Eventually after scrapping tons of hunting rifles you’ll notice you’re not learning mods anymore. You will have all of them. Then you can sell the rest to vendors for caps.
---
Who cares what we or anyone else says about a game. It's free temporarily so download it and give it a whirl and see for yourself.
---
why do you have to make a new post for this?
---
Lets hope they don't fuck up the vault "raids".
---
I don't understand your question. As far as I can tell, the only change we get from being a high level character is that we can invest more perks in the same SPECIAL stat. Playing NW gives us normal XP (at the bottom of the score screen) as well as advancing our special NW Overseer level.
---
Hopefully I answered the question in there somewhere. If not, sorry.
---
Um, no... I clearly stated that this was an opinion, not a fact
---
So did u just ask Bethesda to unlink your gamer tag from your Bethesda acct. then link the new Bethesda Acct to your old gametag?
---
There’s no risk, use your main.
---
What platform? I played a few hours last night on PS4, everything felt normal. Super Duper worked more consistently than before.
---
Is this officially a meme yet?
---
Ah that’s awesome 😂 I’ll have to find the video lol
---
Small nuke area about the size of flatwoods. 15 second countdown.
---
What the hell does race have to do with it?
---
&gt;  and the ones without havn't complained.
---
how would you know? they dont have mics...?
---
Okay let me just say that I was one of those guys who heavily shat on this game at launch. I hated the beta. I won fo76 in a giveaway, tried again and still wasn’t impressed, still had more  negative things to say about it. After hearing the devs talk about their game, admitting to mistakes but thanking the fans for their help and feedback THEN seeing all they plan to add really made me see this game in a different light. I installed yesterday and couldn’t stop. I love it lol
---
Maybe find it cheap? It’s definitely worth it I’d say. The community is probably one of the best I’ve ever experienced, atleast on Xbox. Everyone is so helpful and nice, it’s almost eerie
---
I primarily play adventure mode and have found more bugs after the update in that mode than fixes.
---
Nuclear Winter mode seems to run fine and the gameplay is pretty well thought out but if I wanted to play a battle royale I wouldn't turn to a Fallout game expecting it to be like Apex.  Theres too much need to constantly loot for my tastes
---
I'd suggest checking out some info on the quests. Not enough to spoil the surprise but enough to get an idea of what you want to accomplish. Officer on deck is important as it changes some critical game interaction. It will take a bit of a level up to complete but it's worth it when it's finished. I don't do well teaming up in fallout personally but I'm not a real social person. If you can find a good team it makes a world of difference. Always remember that you need to tag any monster to get credit for the kill. Tag means shoot at least once. I sometimes help lower levels by letting them snipe the beast that attack me before I one hit them (I'm lvl 270 if I didn't mention) so scortched beast takes 5 hits everything else mostly is a single swipe. Check looking for group, I often see lvl 100 or so offering to help new players. Having a mic will greatly improved the game and your ability to play effectively. If you don't have one. Try to get one. And have fun!!!
---
[Grognak loved that.]
---
Not really digging it myself.  First match I run into a building and see a crate so I grab shotgun and ammo...soon as I walk out the door some guy is waiting for me and I take three shots to the face despite me ducking and weaving.  Lasted 2 minutes and died in seconds.  
---
How the hell is someone that good a shot?!
---
Psychotats for me, i like to live dangerously.
---
I gave it a shot. Battle royal type games aren’t typically my style of games however I was pleasantly surprised. Not a mode that I’d play too much in but definitely fun enough to try it every so often. I had concerns it would be like fortnite or pubg but they did a pretty good job not replicating them.
---
If you find a fix for the issue, let us know. Im out of ideas. I think its just badly optimised not much we can do about it.
---
DONT GIVE THAT SHIT OUT FOR FREE!??? Please don't do that to those who actually do it for a living.... Good idea....just for free quest writing kind of shits on folks who literally have to struggle to get those kinds of jobs \^\_\^ Demand your paycheck!!!!
---
Thats great! Gonna download it right now
---
When you say "slot" do you mean stat?
---
Because you can have as many cards in a single stat as you have SPECIAL points for that stat, there's just a max of 7 cards.
---
For example, I have 10 perception, and I have a 6 star card tank killer, 3 star rifleman and 1 star lockpick, all under perception.
---
the “sharpshooter” pose uses a pistol (if you have one equipped) and the “chic” pose should use a rifle (i dont own that so cant confirm). also the “ready” pose should use an unarmed weapon but i dont have that one either
---
Have you been able to speak to anyone in nuclear winter with the headset? It's not impossible it's a me issue but I've yet to get a single reply to my "hey got a mic" and I've grinded to lvl 10 already. That gives you an idea of my amount of gameplay in NW. Odd not to hear a single voice yet, if even a screatcher lol
---
ARK has been my most brutal survival experience.  Some parts of the map present PvE challenges that will rip up anybody but a seasoned player.  Other parts will kill you from exposure even with top-level winter gear.    Some creatures are fast and powerful while others will sneak up on unaware players and dose them with tranquilizers and knock them out before they get a chance to fight back.  Basically, every time you venture out from your base, especially on routes you're unfamiliar with and dungeon runs, you should fully expect to die and have a plan for such an event.
---
I give it to noobs with mics and tell them it is an escape potion of sorts
---
Exactly. Only time I get killed is once every blue moon when I have a workshop and I ain't even mad about that. Just part of the game. Lol. Definitely haven't had anyone following me around beating the shit of me trying to initiate pvp. Shit, I rarely even see someone on the map with a bounty. And when I do, it's usually 5 caps bc they picked a lock somewhere.
---
Fissure prime
---
Once you are in the vault, it will wait until there are 51 players. Once there are 51 players the current timer still has to count to 0. Once it reaces 0 it will start the 2 minute countdown timer.
---
If the vault reaches 51 players, the match should start. Or at least shorten the 2 minute countdown...
---
Used my main for hours, no issue!
---
Wouldn’t a new copy of the game be unplayable as well is your gamertag is banned?
---
Wdym?
---
If you ask the wasteland veterans then - yes.
---
If you ask the vault newcomers then - *everything turns blue, sight fade out... Welcome in Cranberry Bog.*
---
Think you have to favorite it at the atom shop.
---
Hopefully that’ll calm down soon. Seems Bethesda wasn’t ready for the amount of people interested in the free trial. Don’t give up on it yet!
---
more or less, but the areas scale differently. Wait with the savage divide until level 30 is my advice, by then you can handle it with some effort even if they are high level. You are only level 18, stay in the forest, toxic valley and ash heap for now
---
You have to go to the atomic shop and select it. I little nuclear bomb will show up in the top left corner to show its a favorite.
---
honestly I generally hate BR games I owned Fortnite save the world before Fortnite Battle royal came out and ever since then have been nervous when a developer started to talk about BR and yet..... I..... actually like fallout br..... and I won several times......
---
now if I can figure how the hell to wear a costume I'd be grand
---
There is, just get them to team up with you. We did that last night, our whole team survived and won, we teamed up and won 2 more rounds.
---
As soon as you get any armour in the NW it removes your cosmetic items so the small camouflage advantage is vastly outweighed buy the lack of any defences
---
Pro Tip:
---
If somebody gives you something called "Nukashine"......... drink it.  
---
Trust me.
---
a entire settlement sounds like a lot of lonely people actually no wait its normally like 3 people on a hill
---
In Adventure mode, go into settings and choose Passive. Then you can’t accidentally hurt others and they can’t hurt you. Unless you’re in the vicinity of a Workshop area or you engage in combat with them. Don’t engage.
---
"And if you don't like it, it means you are racist"
---
I assume its a joke :/
---
Of course it hasn't been *fixed*. It's been *improved*. It is much better than at launch. Some things have been fixed. If they had spent their whole workforce's time since (whatever year Skyrim released) working on nothing but fixing Skyrim it would still have bugs.
---
I don't know what could be causing it. Send a ticket to Bethesda's Support.
---
I would love to know the same thing, haha. WHERE ARE THE COSTUMES??
---
Power armour I find is very nicely balanced, one clip and a bit from a 10mm submachine gun killed two users (with a very nice flank from yours truely)
---
I think the real takeaway from NW is that people prefer a mode that's inconsequential with respect to Adventure.  As long as it's a side activity that exists in a bubble outside Adventure, they are willing to try it out.
---
The whole problem with Survival, although some would argue it's a benefit, is that it impacts Adventure mode.  If your Survival character had a separate inventory, a separate CAMP, etc., it would be more attractive.
---
I also think that NW presents a compelling argument for why Legendaries simply shouldn't exist in the PvP modes.  NW is actually fun because it's not "whoever shoots first wins."  You have decent levels of survivability.
---
Ive played it a load of months ago and it was a shit show
---
Blatantly pc using mods and blaming the game.
---
if the shoe fits...
---
Try to repair the installation
---
I agree it's a bit like my sex life too..somebody always ends up murdered or dismembered
---
Are you on pc with mods?
---
I think this mode will be tough for a lot of new people to get into and stick too.  I already feel like giving up.  Faster internet is an Iwin button and mine is slow.  Also i got severely, and unfunny, steam rolled in seconds.  I was hiding with a shot gun and dude still knew where I was and put three shots in my face and I only got one back was my worse match.
---
Wtf
---
We have the option for auto team as well on XB1, my concern was with throwing out a LFG on xbox live message boards and or running into people that you wanted to continue to play with. You have to add them as friends instead of just adding them to party. Which is just to much in my opinion. My friends list is going to get clogged up and I doubt I will remember everyone. I mainly put out a LFG just to make sure I have a group w/ headsets.
---
Did that but no luck, but i dont understand i only played for around 2-3hours, during then i was just exploring and questing didn't do anything out of the ordinary on the beta :/ Thanks for the help though
---
Hopefully theyll add in a game mode where you can lose everything, also no legendary effects would be good.
---
I do own (he got me it lol)
---
On top of being open on adventure/survival, it should also be a no pvp zone so people could maybe just hang out and screw around/explore the vault without the worry of getting ganked.
---
If you punch it lets you free,I found that worked for me
---
I play on PS4.
---
Your character will be deleted and your family will be executed publicly
---
I’m not great at running around and killing everyone but I get a lot of fun out of sneaking around, hiding in bushes, and generally trying not to get caught. (Only to be found by a scorchbeast or something). It’s definitely worth trying a few matches to see if it’s something you could be into. I don’t care much for fortnite or pubg, but was pleasantly surprised by the new mode.
---
That's awesome; good going man!
---
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  geez thank it was driving me crazy!
---
That’s odd, I guess you will have to reinstall.
---
gotcha, i do appreciate the help!
---
I read that as "ducking and waving", was thinking no wonder you died haha.
---
Killed a guy in power armor with a switchblade....I think he was as surprised as me
---
Would you mind sharing a picture with us of how does it look like  just wearing the helmet piece? Seems like a pretty good outfit nonetheless.
---
I’ll try but because of internet problems I won’t be able to try it again till tomorrow. Hopefully reinstalling works.
---
It's almost eerie indeed! Haha
---
thx for your insight.
---
The news calls it a "Pre-Beta Sneak Peek" so I'm guessing it will be coming down at the end of the trial for a while till we get into the "true" Nuclear Winter
---
So many people are conditioned to be packrats by previous Fallout games and carry so much aid and junk that the prospect of leaving it in a bag on the ground when HoNkEyDoNg6969 p'wns you with a God-roll is completely off-putting.
---
I bought mine on MMOGA for 15€
---
Will our overseer’s rank persist after this pre-beta or will there be a “wipe”?
---
This does not imply if that is desirable or objectionable. Others might pay extra for that service. 
---
On a less comical note, sometimes your PvP is chasing you and you don’t know it. Check your 6. Drop mines if your fleeing or lingering. You can always try to collect them later. And if you know your layout you can double back and be the aggressor.
---
No problem, stay safe
---
Heavy weapons, explosives weapons, and PA user here on PC with perk loadout mod.
---
Have none of those issues. My AGL does more damage now and my 50 cal still melts enemies prior to NucWin releasing. Ammo reduction weight perks work fine still as well.
---
My statement stands.
---
I'm spending 2/3 of the time playing loading sometimes even loading while enemies can get guns already. Still fun.
---
yeah you have to be in a certain proximity or in the system or something, I mostly just listened to the podcast outside of the game so I don't really remember now but they reference it all the time in the recording. the most fun part was that they did in universe commercials for the fake ship brands and stuff.
---
Yup. I noticed that I died every time (well one time, the stupid rifle scope wouldn't release from ADS! That got me killed in what I think otherwise might have been a stellar match) to someone in Marine armor. Then I got marine armor and won a match.
---
Good news is that the ban is account based only. Simply make a new bethesda account and join the free trial.
---
The Radium Rifle is where its at.  Especially as I can never find freaking rad away.  Definitely keeps things tense!
---
I love that part so much, got to rank 6 and had roughly 800ish caps and a level up from it, not to mention that lovely little stash box haha
---
Dodgy and serendipity are pretty key for surviving as a bloodied player, I also threw on evasive. I run 1 point in endurance, so anything that will help me survive is a big help.
---
Coincidentally, just picked up and instigating Dragon this AM from a player vender.  Should be fun to read the damage with the new numbers option.  Time for some huntin'
---
Idk. That would be a question for u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
A lot of new quests, hidden things to find, new stories to discover (not necessarily a quest but running across someone who’s dead and just figuring out how it happened before/during the blast), less bugs and the ones that do happen are typically hilarious, better combat, and when the fall hits it’s gonna finally give us npcs and a whole new main quest.
---
So I stumbled upon vault 51 before it was actually a thing. I thought it was just a cute reference to Area 51 with the aliens and whatnot, took aesthetic pictures for my loading screen and everything.... And I do not PVP. EVER. I will co-op play on occasion but i really do prefer my lowkey style of sneak and whap. I AM SO FRICKING SAD I CANT EXPLORE VAULT 51 WITHOUT FIGHTING OTHER PLAYERS TO THE DEATH (and wasting through a crap ton of supplies i can't afford, I'm only lev.30)
---
You mean cuz theres fire, dogs, ticks, knives, and corpses...? Same.
---
So, why do we allow it in PVP?  It's also not really funny if shoot a guy in a bathrobe that's basically unkillable because of the legendary armor he wears under it.
---
They should allow unmodded underarmour instead then. Just to look a bit different.
---
I did direct my attitude towards the developers as was stated.
---
HOLY CRAP that would be so awesome. so Hunger Games. All of us losers sitting in the same room watching the winners duke it out. YESSS I want it
---
And my point is that you're simply wrong if you think this game hasn't shed most of its potential audience by simply ignoring these glaring issues.
---
I'm not one of the people who just blindly hate this game, I've been here from day 1 pointing out actual problems in the design in the hopes that constructive feedback would get a constructive response. The response from the devs was basically to just ignore the problems until everyone who cared left, and then when they want to create a competitive mode they have to set it in a parallel game where none of the broken crap they happily ignored doesn't exist. 
---
Hey, maybe Wastelanders will actually address some of these problems and the game is going to do better in the future, but the current trend is down, because the devs have not even acknowledged that they are aware of the most fundamental issues that have driven away most of their core audience.
---
Go into adventure mode to level up, but you don't have to play it if you don't want to. You get adventure mode XP for playing NW, so you can probably make a few levels fairly quickly.
---
I already have the game but i think i got banned because i used some dupe glitches in the past.
---
But if they improved the game i could buy it again
---
Every sentence you used either began with the word "I" or was exclusively about you: to present a stronger argument you need to relate how these changes to the game effect other players and not just how they affect you
---
Yes, you either need to list what you want done or to establish a social structure with Bethesda wherin they can identify and react to your needs appropriately. Thougg as Bethesda is a game company with multiple offices across multiple countries and is not one single person you cannot develop an understanding and rapport with: it will be very difficult to establish this structure, and your complaints aren't unique
---
"...what we think." Oh, you're breaking out the Royal We! You almost seemed as if you were speaking for a couple thousand people there, assuming that they all agree with you! It's fun to pretend to be entitled but it's not helpful (or useful) in a public forum like this :-p
---
Good luck playing Fallout 3 again! I's a much more controlled and consistanf environment, definitely
---
My thing is that this is a sneak peek and I am sure they have a lot of things that aren’t implemented yet - we don’t know if we’re going to be able to use other outfits in the future - I’m just trying to give a solution for right now- i would like to wear in game clothes as well because the engineer outfit is my favorite so I’m with you - just not there yet
---
I 100% get your point of view I feel like there just trying to diversify the game so it’s not just for ppl who like MMO’s. Even WOW has PVP, but I think you’ll love the next dlc add on with the quest lines and actual ppl being added.
---
The thing about Bloodied is that you always have the option of sacrificing health for damage.  You don't have to run around with a dinky amount of HP all the time.  Like, when I do the SBQ battle, I typically go in with about 30% HP and Stim when it gets down to about 10%.  I'm not in Nerd Rage all the time like some are.
---
If you're just going to be ranged against the SBQ, you don't need too much because you'll be out of range of her most devastating attacks.  The trifecta of Serendipity, Dodgy, and Lone Wanderer will take care of most things.  Bloody Mess and Nerd Rage will boost your damage at low health too.  There's the typical Sentinel Armor (75% to reduce damage by 15% when standing still) and having either Padded or Dense on your armor will negate the sonar attack almost completely.
---
Is there any info as to when the “true” nuclear winter starts? I could see myself gettin pretty Hooked on this game mode, especially whenever I’m gettin a little bored of exploring
---
The community is really great, especially if you’re used to gta/red dead online players lol
---
that damn nukashine..
---
The problem with this is that normal mode is now a ghost town.  I think those who can't or don't want BR mode but want to be social are gonna leave.
---
Of course on the flip side....this might pull some fortunate people over.
---
I will keep giving BR a try but due to a slow internet I am not sure I stand a chance.  My character fighting another live person is like a 98 year old with Parkinson's vs an elite young military soldier.  It wont matter how much exp I have...my connection is too slow.
---
But there’s npcs coming later this year :( maybe you can dig it up and give that a try - might be really good you never know
---
There are a lot of things they could do to improve the itemization of the game and make it feel more worthwhile pursuing. 
---
The really big thing is itemization paths, but that requires meaningful character roles to work. Most games do this, where endgame itemization comes in multiple paths you can follow that support a specific role. Following a single path to its conclusion can be set up to be something a player can predictably and reasonably complete in a hundred hours or so. After that people can still choose to complete other paths and grow their capabilities in different directions, without strictly getting more powerful. You can also have some items that randomly pop up that help different paths than you're pursuing along, to facilitate trade or lay a foundation for people to try and pursue a second one when they have completed one set of gear. 
---
The problem is that none of that works in Fallout 76 because there are no distinct roles. You can't point to a team and say "That's the medic, that's the demolitionist, that's the sniper, that's the assassin, and that's the engineer" I mean hey, this game could be revolutionary in not needing a tank because anyone can be turned into a tank by busting out the power armor, but maybe you wouldn't be able to use trauma kits or toolkits as well without having your actual hands free. 
---
We just don't have anything like that in the game.
---
I respect that man. No downvotes from me.
---
I used to be dependant on vats when it slowed down time, but when it became real time I stopped using it out of annoyance. Since then I’ve become way more accurate with my shots, and only ever use vats when dealing with enemies like mole rats and roaches.
---
I did direct my attitude towards the developers.  I thanked everyone who worked on the game and everyone continuing to work on the game.
---
Id play survival again if they totally got rid of the whole "top 3 players highlighted on map"
---
I went in for the first time to get the unstoppable monster unique weapon, i didnt kill anyone, didnt even look for anyone to kill, I was just trying to get the unique gun reward, and all of a sudden I was #3 and highlighted on the map, and i hadnt even done anything!
---
people started stalking me so i just left the server
---
My exact thoughts.
---
Your character name is created in character creation, but nobody sees it but you. Your screen name depends on your platform.
---
Well, some scorched already know the T-pose and some ghouls know the slip-n-slide on-your-side.
---
It can be revived by applying the same PvP rules as in Nuclear Winter.
---
V-X
---
I’m getting old for this kind of mode, my settings are all set to the left, if you catch my drift.
---
By normal you mean adventure? Last night it was ok for me, but today might be a different story.
---
I honestly Love it when people compare D3 to Fallout. D3 is pretty much the only other online rpg i play, and i think there is a lot to be learned from it. There are people playing that game that have been playing it since launch, and playing it on multiple systems. The game was a huge mess at launch and the development team took the right steps to keep us playing it. The end game content is a simple idea that “just works”. The higher the difficulty the better your reward. Fallout needs to add that into the game. But as it is now, the harder the difficulty of the enemies, means nothing in terms of the reward. 
---
The account wide stash would be so great in Fallout,  and paragon points after level 50 would make leveling feel useful again. I am level 195 and have 40+ unused levels. (Mostly because i dont want more of the same perk cards cluttering my deck).
---
Yea they need to streamline the between match options so when you die you can watch your team, quit, or press a button and jump right back in the lobby ready to go again. Essentially there needs to be less loading screens between dying and starting a new match. I don't really want to watch if I die immediately, but I do want to jump right back in and not have to exit back to the game mode screen.
---
It's good if you only have 30 minutes to an hour or so to play. Just as long as there's no advantage to playing the mode 24/7 in terms of combat it's cool, and hopefully not repeating drop locations.
---
Hopefully they're matching levels and you don't end up level 2 going against 90
---
So many people said the same thing about 76 itself, and yet here we all are still playing and enjoying it.
---
I feel like as long as it's walled off from the main game except for the cosmetic carryovers, and it brings in new players to keep the game going, it's a good thing.
---
What if they make a mission around killing the robot controling the Vault in adventure/survival.. and what happens in NW has happend years before the vaults oppend.
---
Would be convenient to launch battle royal and join a match from inside adventure or survival also.
---
I'm on XB1. I've gotten the uninstall/reinstall advice, the "it's probably your connection even though you run 100 gig".
---
It's the servers. It has always been the servers.
---
It is booze that gives you a bonus to action points, run speed and melee.  Your screen changes colors and after 3 minutes you blackout and wake up somewhere else.
---
They are very useful for traveling while over-encumbered or as escape potions.
---
*NW is actually fun because it's not "whoever shoots first wins." You have decent levels of survivability.*
---
i agree!  Its a huge difference without VATS and OP armor, i think its better as you have to aim and cant rely on sentinel gear to save you
---
Thanks for the tip (giggity!).
---
My worst habit is focussing on one target and getting shafted by their buddies!
---
It is u can't put 3 bolts in now
---
I have already gone through this exact thing. I played Fortnite since the beginning, back when it was a PVE game. Ever since the BR came out, the main game was neglected and forgotten. Updates nowadays for it are just repetitive quests. I fear that if the BR rises in popularity, the PVE for this game will be neglected too. Updates will slowly start decreases in size and scope for PVE, while the BR keeps getting more.
---
The crossbow holds 3 bolts in battle royal
---
Same here!
---
it doesnt have that reload animation in NW as far as i know, at least when i tried using a crossbow i got kinda confused trying to figure out how it works since it clearly wasnt the same as in adventure. my guess is they changed it to make it more viable for the new mode
---
Ok buddy
---
Oh no my combat shotgun isn't a two shot explosive vampire, literally unusable.
---
That's what you sound like lol
---
I believe you must get the killing blow
---
There is a frowny face emote. I sometimes use it when I want to decline team invitations.
---
XB1. The whole community has been verifying crashes on all three platforms. It's not the platform, it's not the connection, it's not uninstall/reinstall. It's the servers, only for specified users, and the problem is, Bethesda never will address the community on this, so all you will have is the community arguing with each other when Bethesda can fully see the backend of all the servers.
---
no, not at all, I was level 80-90 when I completed Roses's questline, 100 when I started the quest after that
---
I've seen people lvl 40 being as far into the quest as I am at lvl 100 lol
---
They have 3 shots (semi auto) and a (IMO) a decent reload speed in this mode. You reload one and get three shots. (It's not a glitch) it has it as one of the tips on the loading screen about the crossbows.  I hope this helps!
---
Hell I must’ve done that at least once. Lol
---
Haha I thought so too but I haven’t unlocked it either
---
yeah I rushed the enclave early level just to unlock the vendors lol
---
not needed anymore with the global caps pool
---
The last statement should be true.
---
God no, the game is easy enough as it is. A perk for reduced weight on ammo, sure, but not completely weightless.
---
Finally a use for Toxic valley it always feels so empty and pointless
---
I'd prefer not to die
---
That’s a shame, because to me it honestly feels complete enough to stay in the game at this point. It’s solid fun and the adventure cap/DP bonuses without spending any of your mats makes it really worth it
---
Well, mystery solved. BUGGED! :)
---
On your last parenthetical point, if I read the releases correctly, your supplies for NW are all found within the round. Everyone starts out on equal footing. So no worries about wasting your adventure mode resources at least
---
So it isn't normal, good :)
---
It went live? Did it? What?
---
You don't use your own supplies in the BR mode btw.
---
Vendors are actually going well currently at least for me, though I try to set low prices like 15-30 caps for a good ar. Just make sure to have a little something for everyone
---
I went into adventure mode after NW and tried to find loot....
---
Yea havd been thinking about sentinel too for a while, but that wouldn't work with the weight of all the stuff I usually carry around, trying to find a good middleway there
---
And lootable stash boxes but turn the health of buildings WAY up, then the raiders would finally have something to raid :)
---
thank you
---
Things get busted and fixed a lot. I'm worried about gun fu being broken at the moment for my gunslinger/vats but I'm pretty sure it'll get fixed. Eventually. I wouldn't want to base a whole build around what's broken at the moment as what you do decide to do might break next month.
---
And I remember the VATS melee being fixed in the latest patch notes but I haven't tried.
---
Just take your time and enjoy the story and gameplay. Collect lots of junk. If you do go with pistols, save the one you get doing the Mistress of Mystery quest, as it can be made again at a higher level (there's a sword that's the same way  if you go 1H Melee)
---
I think it may just be on your end. I use all these perks regularly and have no problem.
---
“BeTh ShOuLd JuSt CuT loSseS aNd AnnOunce FaLLout 5”
---
Ill admit i was a hater but i had alot of fun. Im still worried about the player base splitting (i know its the first night but i went to adventure and there was about 90% less player camps) Im also worried if it takes off then they might neglect the base game development wise and just focus on BR.
---
What do you get for becoming Overseer?  And does playing Nuclear winter have any affect on your Adventure mode character?
---
Lol, yeah. I always spawn in at my camp and have my vending machine off before entering survival mode. Also, there is a secret spot I found where I can hang hout for 3+ hours and no one can kill me. That's how I made it to the top of the leaderboard that first week the Survival mode came out.
---
Pretty sure the levels and ranking in MW mode just unlock story and cosmetic stuff- no competitive advantage, other than the common sense tag it gives when you see somebody else's high level and think "This guy has played this a HELL of a lot more than i have."
---
I'm a notorious hoarder so I likely won't be throwing much out.  I know I am going to wind up pondering this all day and still not have a choice when I boot the PS4 up tonight.
---
What I'm hoping for is a solid setup, like layout, enemies, bosses, the works. I don't expect the difficulty to be up to par, considering how crazy powerful some players are. I feel like they're going to have to fine tune it, cause I expect the enemies to either be too overtuned or too weak at first. Then again, I've not really looked into the "raids", so I'm not really sure what to expect.
---
Shut up and enjoy your nocturnal pipewrench!
---
That's what you sound like.
---
Yup, you have until the 17th to try it out! Go get em, killer!
---
What is the reference?
---
Yes!
---
Just the Odd Scout's redneck cousin, js all.
---
Obviously didnt happen but hey, if it makes you happy
---
I felt like cheating when I kept killing new players cuz they don't know how the game works really and I'm over here using a stealthboy and sniping their entire team
---
lol I was actually surprised by the absence of new bugs. It was running stable and pop-ins didn’t cause lag like they used to do. Hot wheel worked fine too, I tried to break it by adding a bunch of variants of the same type of weapon to it, they stayed on after re-login👌
---
i only played a few games but had a blast playing, do you know if there's a way to tell people where you're going? or to let them know where an item is? (without using a mic)
---
Still better than a normal pipe wrench Nancy
---
I’m going to have to agree, cosmetics covering up armor in Adventure is one thing, but in an actually competitive environment like Nuclear Winter I would much prefer being able to see what my enemies are using over looking good myself.
---
I hope this turns out to be great like game should from the begining. But i lost all of my optimism already :-/
---
I can't help you, but maybe this thingy for planning builds can. I think that incisor includes punching attacks, but I am not certain.

PC to Console will never work because of MOD options in PC offering an advantage over Console.....Xbox + PS4 should not be too difficult, but has problems with Microsoft and Sony clashes
---
in short....it will be a long way off :(
---
I mean, he is literally an AI.
---
i was thinking about this earlier, theres not enough time in 2 minutes to get the full breadth of lore from the holotapes, so being able to explore it at your own pace would be incredibly useful, not to mention that the whole 'having to go back to the main menu -every single time- the game ends.... that gets intensely annoying. i would love it if we could enter that vault and queue up for NW from within adventure/survival mode. the flow of gameplay feels really disjointed when youre shunted back to the main menu every time. just my opinion i dunno what you lot think.
---
Yeah, after their version of "dungeons"... I'm not super hopeful, but who knows. SBQ is sorta like a server wide single boss raid. So at least we know they understand what a raid boss is.
---
You get more overseer exp and adventure exp and caps for playing,  the longer you last the higher the rewards. You unlock perk cards as you rank up and supposedly unlock different gear. I haven't gotten that far so I cannot confirm.
---
So is this mode only available for the week or what?
---
Fallout gun balancing makes everything feel like airsoft, so no, you need two mags to kill anything by default.
---
I’d love a queue system back out is so annoying with all the load screens
---
I'm garbage at PVP. Even if I was any good, my framerate issues would cripple me in PVP.
---
I still had a lot of fun in that mode. Most of my time in adventure mode is roaming around exploring and looting crap. Nuclear Winter has that but now there's an urgency/purpose to the looting. You need to check all the boxes and stuff to find ammo and weapons and armor because you can't just create your own or buy it from a vendor.
---
Has the CAMP feature as well. So if you wanted you could try and see how elaborate a base you could build before getting sniped.
---
I just had fun following my team around. Sneaky sneaking closer to the center of the map, finding a good defensible area to bunker down for the last stand. 
---
I think I did minimal damage to a couple of players across the 1-2 hours I played and still managed to hit Overseer level 5.
---
well Ive seen people be able to access the overseer part in v51, so thats somethin
---
I played D3 since launch too but stopped 3 years ago, got a little bit bored of it and most of my friends left the game by that time. And I totally agreedm, there are a lot of concepts that work pretty fine in d3 that could also be great additions to f76. Greater rifts (randomly generated dungeons with level scaled boss and mobs and with good rewards), kanai cube (the instrument to manipulate legendary affixes and other stuff like that for a well balanced price), paragon level points (that allow even low-level characters to jump-start with overall better stats and breeze through starter content asap and also make end-game builds stronger with every level) - all this stuff would be awesome to have in fallout tbh.
---
But playing NW doesn’t risk anything in your Adventure more char?
---
I wasn't one of the folks who has been threatening to leave over the new things Bethesda wants to try but I am also slightly frustrated they keep putting resources into more game modes when the core game mode still has a lot of flaws.
---
It seems almost like they are using 76 to try every type of game out there in the hopes of being everything to everyone which never works.  I do take solace in the belief that if the few jerk offs that still play the game are happy killing players in BR mode then they won't be messing with people in adventure mode.
---
Yeah they seemed to have fixed quite a bit. The real noticeable one for me is the scenery renders properly without turning into a technicolour acid trip.
---
Hoo boy, I found a scoped lever action rifle yesterday, and my western duster was pretty good camo hiding in some brown bushes.  They never knew what hit them.
---
Maybe this is an upcoming mod for the cross bow finally!
---
It's kind of "intermediate step" to dying. 
---
Doesn't kill you or even really hurt you.
---
Let's just say it will open up the map a little.
---
My big issue with fortnite was it felt like no matter what you picked up as a weapon someone could always 1 shot you and vice versa. And I never understood the building aspect. I enjoy more slower paced games as well. 
---
That being said, NW does a really good job of making it an equal chance to win. No one is able to just 1 shot you, what you pick up really does matter (a pipe pistol doesn’t have much chance to win if you come across someone in PA with a better gun. But it’s fun to try). You can pick up kits to build walls or turrets but so far I haven’t came across anyone really using them except randomly placing them for the hell of it. People aren’t just running Around but actually taking it like a fallout game using sneak and tactic. It’s not a mode I’d play every single day but it’s a nice change if you are looking for something to do and unsure what to do next in the game.
---
How would Travis be a DJ when he doesn't exist yet?
---
Yup, til the 17th. It's a trial.
---
If praise is not deserved when someone makes something right, then there is no path to redemption.  If criticism is not deserved when someone does something wrong then how would you believe they knew it was wrong?
---
Wolfs are up by a cave in Charleston and shovels are in white springs
---
Watch people play competitive shooters online sometime, it's mind boggling.
---
You can use emotes, like the come here.. that I'd if they listen. But a mic is highly recommended for decent teamwork.
---
The ping system is so good that it should become a standard for the industry. It opens up online gaming to people who can't communicate too - e.g. those with hearing difficulties/deafness, social anxiety about using mics, etc.
---
Feety if you are on PC I can give you a hand.   Building can be.. umm... finicky...  in this game at times.   I can think of another F word.    What is your ingame name I'll send a friend request if you'd like.
---
I wish I could listen in on the people who realize they are within the blast radius..."SHITSHITSHIT RUN!!!!"
---
Not a single button on my controller set me free from perpetual love palming.
---
I haven’t actually played adventure or survival mode since NucWin launched.. lol
---
There won't really be meta as far as perks go for a while. It's all RNG based which perk cards you get
---
Hi, you get a lot of XP and the XP you get actually counts toward your adventure character's XP gains, you can level up your adventure character by just playing NW!
---
I couldn’t  agree with you more! And i would say add seasons with unique rewards like extra stash space too. But you need to be able to level to 50 faster for that to work.
---
It's a recurring bug right now unfortunately.  Sometimes it nothing happens, it helps to exit the build menu and go back in.
---
No I doesn't. You dont bring any of your own gear to the match. Level doesn't fully matter but the more attribute points you have the higher level perk cards you can equip.
---
You don't waste your supplies. Every match is a blank slate - you start off with no ammo, weapons, armor, supplies. You only get what you find as the match progresses.
---
You can sneak and whap in there as well. That's all the random teams I was on did, haha. None of us were "charge in guns blazing". It was all sneaking around finding good cover and then taking folks out if the opportunity presented itself.
---
You also have 2 minutes before each match starts to just explore the vault. Not a *lot* of time, but over the course of several matches you could get a good idea of it.
---
But why? It doesn’t make sense to give people incentive to disregard their team and take time to finish other people’s kills.
---
Not much. Most legendary weapons and armor are only worth scrip, unless you get something really special.
---
Do these carry over match to match?
---
I went in a little more excited about it after seeing the BE3 presentation. Still wasn't sure though. I was one of the "This isn't what we asked for Bethesda" people. 
---
Well... I streamed Nuclear Winter for 6 hours last night. Had 40-60 people in chat the whole time, everyone seemed to be really enjoying watching, and I was certainly enjoying playing. I've never had more than 20 people watching me play Fallout 76. Other games, like Fallout 4, I've had 200-300, but never Fallout 76. I had to tear myself away at midnight because I had to be up at 6 this morning for work. Putting in for a vacation day now for Friday.
---
Except we're not talking about the quality of weapons, we're talking about the quality of itemization systems, and this one is shit tier no matter how much you think people who would like a better one are whiners.
---
Maybe the internet problems are THE problem? I think a fast, stable connection should be one of your first goals.
---
Weightless Sentinel is a possibility. 😉
---
I know what you mean though.  A Bloodied melee can wreck most things, but you'll always need a gun for something, so I took up the Gatling Gun and the first rank of each Heavy Gunner.  I wouldn't mind trying other ones, like the Gatling Laser or Plasma, but I look at their weight and just balk.  Realistically, there's only space for one heavy weapon in my life, and it's hard to argue with the 450 damage of my Bloodied Gatling Gun.
---
Was this recently? This is the sort of thing I do for very low-level players quite often, but haven't in the past week or so.
---
Good to know. I love it when I hear others have been playing as long as I have.
---
10GB for me - 5hrs...
---
You just sound entitled and a bit selfish. I this and me that. It’s not like they made this game just for you. They’re trying to have something for everyone. I don’t play much BR but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I don’t think it was a waste at all. In fact I’d say it was a great addition as a mini game.
---
The fact that your perks don’t work sucks, but currently, mine work fine. So it seems to be on your end.
---
Then finish it off by threatening to not play 76 and start up 3 again. Like, okay bye felicia. 👋
---
I carry 3 weapons and aiddupllies. That leaves me at about 250lbs and nearly maxed. Any suggestions
---
Yesterday
---
I won’t lie, it’s a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be.
---
I have noticed that if west tek has been cleared and you show up and force a spawn legendaries don't spawn. If you get there and there's bodoes/goo piles/meat piles there don't waste your time going inside.
---
This guy doesn't play mmo's lol, I'm backing out of this before I get worked up stupidly over Reddit comments
---
Oh god damnit I forgot about timeline.
---
The perks? You unlock them through playing NW. And yes the character you are using will maintain what you unlock.
---
Then I suppose I have a kindred spirit out there! :)
---
It's pretty obvious most of the new content was planned from the start. That's how game development works (for most developers). I can understand consumers not understanding this, but the news outlets reporting this is just shameful.
---
yeah that 2 min countdown is the real killer...every match someone is dead in less time.
---
Ah ok cool

Ive only played a few matches so i wasnt sure.

---
Survival mode could be viable if it required separate characters and no trading allowed whatsoever.  Agree with others showing the top 3 and the leaderboards is kind of silly too.  Allow legendaries - but without item trading/sharing and requiring new characters - its going to be much more of that true hardcore mode that some have been asking for.  I would also disable carry weight perks and mods, no PvP VATS, reduce stash size, and make world items much more scarce so resources should be a constant struggle.  Possibly limit some legendary effects from affecting PvP, only Assassin's effects on weapons and armor count for PvP.
---
Had same problem on PS4 last night, seemed to be resolved after a few hours. Could have been an issue with the PS network, nothing to do with FO76 servers.
---
actually i've mutated from rads often in NW. pretty sure you mutate from less radiation and there are more radioactive sources in the world.
---
Dont launch nukes. Have you not learned anything from Chernobyl?
---
&gt; I can understand consumers not understanding this, but the news outlets reporting this is just shameful.
---
What about Todd claiming that there were no NPCs and the role playing etc. only comes from interacting with other players and nothing else?
---
In fact, if someone is attacking you in Adventure Mode, you can troll them in the most passive way possible. Just stand there and give them "heart" emotes or whatever. As long as you don't fight back, they will never, ever be able to harm you in any way at all. Just standing there emoting at them, they'll doubtless get very frustrated and lose interest before long. 
---
Alternately, you can just quit back to the main menu and then join a new server where the douche in question can't find you.
---
I w as close enough to see some guy do the finger guns....
---
So the longer you wait to play NW, the less likely you are to succeed because you’ll be perkless and most likely everyone else will be perked up already?
---
i had multiple notifications on leveling up but my character’s still the same level after at least three or four notifications. not sure if it’s just bugged or if it’s intentional :(
---
Nuked WS is still and will always be fun and profitable. So is player vending. But do a lot of shop around before making big purchases. Many folks try to fish with worthless items, like a ‘you’ve been insulted’ note for 10k, toilet paper for 20k, dog hat 25k, etc. Don’t fall for it.
---
Same. We actually ended up with 5 cards but couldn't find a case
---
Same if anything I maybe a bit better, but I have yet to see what happens in BR, not a fan of PVP here mostly because I wish they fix all the adventure issues and balance the game, then ADD more modes...
---
Ooohhhh that explains why I had such a weird SPECIAL spread.
---
I also thought it'd be a completely fresh start. Where you have to earn SPECIAL points each match.
---
If it uses your pre-existing SPECIAL loadout, that would give higher level players and advantage, wouldn't it? More points to disperse more PERKs?
---
It has been suggested that the explosive nerf was reverted. Likely by mistake, but I like it.
---
I get around 2000 to 4000 xp per match. Not sure how long that would take to level up.
---
I’m on PS4 and I’ve had virtually no issues in the new mode. The only problem I’ve had on adventure was whenever taking something from my stash it lags really bad for a second
---
yeah ive found that my team always does better even if just two people are talking and everyone else is following.
---
Umm.. What?
---
It must be some messed up RNG to give you 6 in a row (of anything). I'm thinking that it may be choosing from a list of items that's held by the server. Whether or not this list applies to every loot drop on the server, or the Purveyor has a separate list, isn't clear. But if her list on that server included mainly bashing weapons then that explains why you got so many of them.
---
I got 10 kills from a nuke last night.  Including myself 🤦‍♂️
---
...ahhhh, Tuesdays!
---
It doesn't make it any harder. Just less tedious. I already have all the fusion cores I need, I just don't want to waste 30% of my playing time with inventory management
---
I also thought it would just be "pick 7" but it's "You can only use 7 PERKs but can only equip them based on your SPECIAL points".
---
I've got a level 3 PERK card I wanted to equip but I can't because my Perception only has 1 point on the lowbie char I'm using for NW. :(
---
Hmmm didnt know. 190 damage per hit for 3 shots and one reload for 3 is a bit much up close?
---
Literally just got it a few hours ago! Was quite surprised!
---
This is the issue with all BR games, if you get a competent team it's very enjoyable. Playing with randoms is hit or miss and can make the experience frustrating.
---
If you play a game with a decent team just ask if they want to team up next round, or maybe try looking for some people on the fallout 76 discord.
---
they only have the gas mask tho
---
Nice! I never got into the streaming stuff, but still, just goes to show you that more people seem to at least be interested in trying it and the overall majority actually like it. Now, if we could get people outside of this sub to calm themselves about it 😂😂

One of the worst cases of shitting on this game I’ve seen was by the Jimquisition. He brings up valid points on how the game didn’t meet expectations, then starts just ranting. Straight up. He says the game needed to be trashed and forgotten about, and also says that in spite of Bethesda actually trying to fix the damn game they should go fuck themselves for trying to do it after release. This video was released two days ago and it’s one of the most toxic videos I’ve seen bashing FO76
---
I was pleasantly surprised. I did a handful of them yesterday. I love the firestorm mechanic.
---
Yes they are. If all 3 of his cards are only 1 star, he'd be fine.
---
But if any of them are 2 or 3 stars, he's not going to be able to equip all 3.
---
You're limited to 7 cards total, but the ranks of each card/number equipped per stat are still restricted by the number of points you put into each stat.
---
Tons of MMOs have a lot better itemization systems than FO76. But sure, go ahead and act like there is no difference in quality between different systems or possibility of creating a better one.
---
This may sound like a silly question but when they say a sneak peak at nuclear winter, do we lose this game mode on the 17th or is it just the sneak peak for the people playing for free?
---
That reminds me of Bioshock 2's multiplayer. You were in your own room and if you wanted to play a game you would walk out a door.
---
I must say that DLC Was just fun.
---
Yeah.  I'm level 218 in 76. But I still feel like I'm level 50.

Oh yes glad you mentioned that, I haven’t seen the acid trip yet so it’s probably fixed too. Good job Beth!!

Look at a picture of the mole miner and look at a picture of the excavator armor.  All you can see is the head, but the mouthpiece and the hoses are the exact same.  The mole miners are wearing excavator power armor.  Explains why the have titanium on them so often.

ohh i like the map size...it feels tight enough that im never running around too long without seeing someone and spacious enough that i dont feel like there's no where to hide if i need to. i hope when the final mode is out that we get other areas to play in also. the different terrains should make for nice switch ups in play style.

Most people only want max level weapons. I doubt you will get an offer if you put it on the marketplace. It’s a neat weapon though.

It'll go away on the 17th for a bit, and Bethesda will fix whatever issues they've seen, then get released in either beta, or the full version when Nuclear Winter actually drops.
---
was actually tempted to buy it, but dont want some 2nd account to play it :(
---
Aww man I appreciate it! I’m on PS4 though... just a stupid mistake haha I’ll get them eventually
---
New Vegas is cash once you get past the bugs, the fanboys however can be a little shite
---
Yeah they desperately need to improve on that front. I just hope they don't fall into sampling the community by flying people out. That whole trip cost a shitton of atom bucks and I am not sure that is the best way to read the room
---
Did anyone even bring up the state of roleplaying tools in game while you were there? Did anyone bring up the lack of character names?
---
No problem! Good luck!
---
I hear you. I tend to fall back into marksman mode and that is not a desirable trait in game. I know I cannot hold my own in a face to face gun battle, so I will try to find a perch to camp out in and soften targets from afar. this is not a game where snipers do well, so I am actually a melee build. its good when you can get people back peddling.
---
Scrip is around 30 caps. Those effects in combination with each other aren't amazing so it's value is around 450 caps as scrip scrap. Although the influx of people underpricing items is making that figure more skewed.
---
Also on XB1 and the servers have been fine for me for quite some time now.
---
Stop teaching the lizards our ways, now they know how to get information from us.
---
I won’t be wearing it. Sticking the most requested outfit in a bundle to get people to buy atoms is cynical, and if successful you can expect a lot more of it.
---
Looking for the same info if I find it I'll let you know
---
on the main menu go to social -&gt; friends and invite whoever you wanna play with to a team. then press play like you normally would.
---
if you wanna play with just your friends, press R before joining so it turns off the team “filling”
---
Haha you’re right! Everyone else is out here playing Nuclear Winter and I’m running around trying to take a picture of a squirrel 😂
---
Have an UpVote for actually making me laugh out loud!  
---
(Which is something I rarely do sadly!)
---
Join a group before you join the world for nuclear winter
---
I was VERY apprehensive about it at first.  Mostly out of the sheer frustration that Battle Royale just seems like a cheap cash grab nowadays and not every game needs it.  However, I gave it a try last night and was pleasantly surprised at how much I ended up enjoying it!  Kudos to Bethesda on this one, took me by surprise!  Plus, I want all that sweet sweet loot so I'll be playing this mode more!
---
I just got my first win! It feels amazing! I'm not a huge fan of BRs but wow Bethesda did a really good job!
---
Permanent survival should see everyone start at lvl 1, and you can’t bring in or trade gear from other characters, or seasonal mode
---
It definitely has its place, and should not be scrapped, and tbh is more challenging than battle royale (esp if everyone started off brand new) 
---
You can keep the rules as Bethesda currently has them setup.
---
I have put a ton of hours into survival/my build, and with some tweaks by Bethesda it would be an even better mode.
---
Problem is currently are bases are indestructible, players can glitch Invincible (as well as other exploits) and the absolute glut of duped legendary items in the server (explosive lasers/stealthboys/quad telsas/vats handmades/armor)
---
Yep, same here, I was skeptical as F but damn... It's really fun! I thought this update kills F76 for me, stupid, idiotic BR craze BS. Nope, it's brilliant! 
---
GREAT job Bethesda team! You made someone who absolutely despises BR's love your iteration!
---
Cheers guys got it working now, was pretty simple actually
---
I'm going to assume that, if not during the beta maybe after the launch, you get matched with people with similar rank.
---
If that's not the case then yea the people playing the most will have the most access to various perk cards.
---
The Perk cards seem to be random so you could get some badass stuff early on as well.
---
I also believe your rank determines how many cards you can have equipped to a specified attribute.
---
I'm rank six and I can only have 1 card per attribute. But I have unlocked some decent ones already.
---
Everyone has to be at the main menu and the. Go to social and invite your squad.
---
Then you can select “play” or “play with team” to bring everyone into NW as a team (up to 4)
---
I think it is a great addition from Bethesda. Amazing that they can incorporate a BR mode into a classic genre of game. Definitely brings some new excitement of progression and pvp to the game. I am wondering how this will affect Survival mode pvp? Will it render it obsolete or will people still want to one shot people with their Legendary weapon? I am liking the the game modes and now if i get bored of the grind in adventure i can get some quick action and excitement in Nuclear Winter. Then when i get frustrated from not getting the kill or making a stupid mistake I can go cool off in adventure mode. Rinse &amp; Repeat.  I am just hoping they can keep this up and that they haven't bitten off more than they can chew. BR Fallout? What will they think of next....
---
1.  A quick run through the Burrows or West Tek will usually yield you three or so legendaries if you get there by yourself.  With the legendary vendor even lower level legendaries like Uranium Fever are still worth getting.  I don't see a lot of nukes on Whitesprings any more.  
---
2.  Not sure, sorry.  
---
3.  After the nerf they not game changing, but they are still passive income for whatever resources you're hunting.  They're nothing to go out of your way to take, if that's what you're asking.  
---
4.  Yes, extensively even!  They even just patched one of the huge issues with using them where you would fast travel to it and be at a random location instead of the shop itself.
---
5.  As for specific, overall improvements, I can't think of any huge ones, just little things here and there that have varied significance to different people.  And as far as I know, there haven't been any big scares pop up lately.
---
We already have an alien testing area lol
---
Colored changes based on the type of damage being inflicted already, if I'm not mistaken.
---
Only works if you're smart. Had people try and pull this on my group a few times yesterday. Guys in stealth were idiots shooting at you face to face. If they shot from back or side we would have all been dead.
---
It fits because it’s a video game and video games are supposed to be fun. Y’all reading way to much into it
---
congrats on getting your head out of your ass..
---
Ok so, in the menu of Fallout 76 you see the Vault open, so I'm pretty sure it will open later in time, they're just not doing that for the free trial because there's no point
---
PC? I’ll have it, thanks :) the RNGods hate me too.
---
sigh, i guess Ill take that off your hands...
---
Ahhhh they always drag me back in... You keep saying item systems like that's the magical end all be all, what do you mean ? Please explain ? Your just on your soapbox spewing bullshit. Your last sentence doesn't even make sense lol. 
---
Just say what you really mean "I'm a pissy boi who got bad rolls and I'm upset because I feel like I should get god tier items ever drop" 
---
Gtfo lol
---
Me last night while loading into my 18th consecutive game “I fucking hate battle royale! Ok just one more game...”
---
You can build the item of the plan you pick up, you may have to place your camp down first of course
---
For Example: The've never fixed the issue with nvidia cards and graphic settings in general, witch you can't modify for NW anyway so the game has fps drops and stutter, you can maybe get past them in adventure mode even if they make the game sooo frustrating, but definitely you can't forgive that in a competitive pvp setting, completely ruin the game for me
---
Legendary explosive effects weapons don't seem to be much better though...  but going from 60-100% for Demo Expert probably isn't going as much for them as for true explosive weapons.  Is the explosive nerf you mention in reference to the perk?  There's no way explosive legendary effects was reverted though, its easy to see that in the damage numbers display.
---
Stash space is 800 now instead of 400 and you can have more carry weight with the backpack now too. As far as selling ammo you can put it in your vending machine and sell it to other players.
---
Yeah, this scenario is obnoxious. They need to provide activities in the waiting area. Let us play pool. Make the stationary bike provide a minor AP boost, or the weight set provide a strength buff. Anything would be better than punching everyone.
---
Private server crossplay is perfectly fine.
---
If Xbox I’ll take it
---
How long is a nuclear winter match?
---
SCP-004 consists of an old wooden barn door (SCP-004-1) and a set of twelve rusted steel keys (SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13). The door itself is the entrance to an abandoned factory in [DATA EXPUNGED].
---
I’m 100% sure I delivered the death blow at least a couple of times, when there was literally nobody around, unless she died of a massive heart attack. So now I think maybe you’re required to kill her all by yourself. If anyone contributed a few shots you’ve failed the challenge 🤮
---
sure the game is free to play. but the PS+ isn't free.
---
I think it was a shader issue. Either the ground looked like snow or there were multicoloured squares all over the place. Not gamebreaking but annoying all the same.
---
I don't how the friends add work in this game, but PC yup and ismox is my...gamertag? character name? Well anyway try to add me with that.
---
All rewards from Nuclear Winter should be account based not just Overseer rank.
---
Thank you, and i have one more question. Is the briefcase just in a random lootable container like the codes are? Or is it an actual briefcase sitting out somewhere?
---
While I understand what you're saying, it kinda works against the whole point of that Vault. The story is a constant battle to the death of people vying for Overseer. If you could explore it, I think it would need to be like a workshop and be a PVP zone.
---
The PC gamers are always way more funny and cool. I'm jelly. Lol
---
sounds like every BR lobby ever to me...
---
I am not sure if you can let your team know where you are going. I know you can place custom markers on the map, I am not positive if your teammates can see them though. As for items the only way so far is to either communicate via mic. Or you can use the come here emote.
---
Sorry mate, PC, forgot to mention that
---
X-02 is based on Hellfire from Fallout 3, so it was already cannon. It’s just now it has a prototype designation.
---
Duped legendary gear is the issue not legendary gear in and of itself.
---
You have the majority of players running around with a set of Sent Ass armor, and either a handmade, or a quad faster fire rate telsa, and stealth-Boys (obtained through duping)
---
Yes for a level 0 it’s fine because you may be confused first time in the lobby if you can do damage or not. But after that you’re just a retard. Like you’re level 5 and you still Obsessively punch people nonstop for 2 minutes straight every round for no reason
---
Ok, not online right now, if you’re happy to wait? IGN (in game name) is the same as here :)
---
I don't like the fallout BR idea, but is very funny and I must say that I like very much this mode
---
How frustrating that it’s not clear and congrats on your wins!
---
i think it's only bc it's new (and only up for a limited time for now). I'm playing NW right now, but I'll go back to Adventure soon enough
---
Patch Notes.
---
Yea, it's different indeed.  I'm all about VATS, my close to 1,000 has been about 90% VATS build.  BUT, I am loving this new mode.  Even playing field (gear wise) to start is really making me appreciate the finer things (gear wise).  It's also a refreshing break from the meta that Survival has become.
---
Lmfao...gtfoh
---
I kind of envy people's experiences. My experiences haven't been so fun. So far, my experiences have been 'drop in, get shot by a team of two or three players with ARs against your dinky revolver'.
---
Agreed!  It is annoying having to go back to the menu just to get back in the queue
---
Yup, it's yours when you're ready
---
Thx!
---
Bye
---
No he said that, and that was what was intended.... For the first year. This is our wasteland to tame. All part of the plan.
---
This would be amazing. Also keep an eye out for the holotapes unlocked by your overseer level.
---
So many of the challenges are still bugged. Like discovering area with a region. They owe me SO many atoms.
---
Thanks for the heads up. Actually had no clue there was challenges geared towards NW.
---
Maybe it would be better if attachments spawned separately, that way you can put say maybe a scope on a weapon that otherwise wouldn't drop with a scope. It would give you way more options to mix and match and find your favorite build.
---
Aaah thanks.
---
I wasnt too interested in battle royale either but decided to give it a chance during the sneak peek and I am liking it so far. Hopefully they add new locations to keep it fresh but this could be something to play every so often until Wastelanders comes out in the fall.
---
No it isn't you get a 50% damage penalty for literally half of the game time.
---
They could have just outlasted you on the edge of the storm with a ton of stimpaks. I've had 6 supers on me at one point, it's possible
---
I’m level 9 now and still suck. Managed to kill maybe 5 players in total in the last 10 hours of playing. 
---
Still keep spamming Q by accident.
---
Enjoying it though, not gone back to adv or sur mode yet.
---
Yeah, realized how much I suck at aiming.  Had the drop on someone and couldn’t even hit them at point blank range. 😔
---
But you also do more damage for 50% of the game ;)
---
Well yeah, and the people buying sets on eBay and all that other bullshit. The damage was already done from them long ago, and every new duping method makes it harder.
---
So how would you salvage the situation for survival mode? New characters and or no legendaries
---
ive played many battle royale games , fallouts is the best
---
Well he probably means the main story questline
---
You created a post letting the fallout 76 reddit know that you won’t be playing battle royale? And you think people care what some random is or is not going to play?
---
I had no interest in Survival mode when it was added, and I still have no interest in it, but a Battle Royale ala PUBG in Fallout? No thank you, but I wish everyone that does participate has plenty of fun.   
---
At least this new Fallout, now being online, should now attract a wider audience than any previous Fallout ever did.  
---
Solo play is how I have always enjoyed Fallout, and I still do play Solo primarily, but with the three different modes now available, it just makes Fallout so much bigger and will touch the hearts of many more players. Well Done Bethesda Game Studios.
---
Someone, we just don't get lucky finds, friend. Last night, I went in a bunch of matches and either only found a scoped pistol, or a melee weapon and wood armor. Cause, you know, that's going to help a lot, haha. It really is the luck of the finds you get early on and then being able to weave your way through the map, sight unseen.
---
i think this topic should come out when the y release the human nova into fallout 76 due to it being a topic nova and i have not seen a why it should be now instead of later to see how it works out
---
Can't beat 'em, might as well join 'em!
---
I had a hilarious time there yesterday.
---
So, I'm wandering around and I notice there's this one player sitting on a bench flicking her flashlight on and off.  Bemused, I sit down next to her and start doing the same thing.  We eventually had two others join in on this spontaneous performance, got a bit of a crowd around us, and I was laughing the whole time at the absurdity of it.
---
Sure hope so. I have a quad cross bow it’s still a PITA when I have to load it four times to get the quad effect, it’s just wrong. All other quad legendaries only load once, why do they have to punish the crossbow which has no mods to begin with🤮
---
Just sitting somewhere. Found the briefcase one time before as my cards it was poking out from under table
---
If you want someone to explain something to you you shouldn't insult them. You should also work on your reading comprehension.
---
How do you know that they're kids?
---
i end up doing most pve in nw out on the edge near the storm.
---
I think that's why they disabled vats! Because they can't fix that teleporting!
---
Ugh, thanks for the response.
---
This needs to be fixed though, can imagine a lot of people would also be sad to experience this. Worst thing is the time and effort it required to farm those shells, which is now wasted.
---
Somebody probably already said it, but if enemies are double your level and you're playing solo you're jumping ahead. Explore, loot, scavenge, kill, do events in forest area to rank up and get supplies and plans. Then you can craft to upgrade armor and weapons, maybe find a couple legendaries along the way.   😁😁
---
I’m not even worrying about them, too busy trying not to get killed 30 seconds in!
---
Also gives you a reason to jump out, because you *know* that ‘bird’s going to crash, one way or another.
---
It would also be super cool if the game feed was up on the monitors. You can scope out the end of the game while chilling in the vault waiting to relaunch.
---
How is a 4 foot tall little dude wearing a full suit of power armor under that robe.
---
If you last the whole game, maybe about 15 minutes or so? Depends a lot on game flow, your play style, etc.
---
There are hitbox issues especially at distance. Could also be slight lag or stutters. I found that out after about 15 games. I wasn't registering headshots of people who were camping and not moving with a scoped rifle, but could get a headshot at a farther distance with a scoped revolver.
---
you don't have to be "skilled" with computers to play games on it. you have to know how to turn it on and how to click a mouse. And sorry if that hurts your feelings, but if you can't do that then you are in fact stupid.
---
Again, these days "you have to know what you're looking for" isn't an excuse. you have the internet and with that all the information you need. If you can't find out what to buy from that, then that's a you problem.
---
And PC parts don't become obsolete a week after buying. your PC doesn't magically get worse just because new Hardware gets released. I built mine 4 years ago and I'm still nowhere near needing an upgrade.
---
I typically despise PvP but actually enjoyed it. I even did fairly well on my first attempt. I can see myself playing a match or two when tired of adventuring.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Yeah, there are a lot of players that stick around just due to the gambling aspect-- it burrows into your brain that around the next corner might be that 3 star god tier weapon or armor. Or that outift you been looking for
---
Great stories!
---
I just. Don’t like where Bethesda took this online experience. They literally just hopped on the BR trend without shame
---
Yeah, but the last time the storm stopped progressing, the final circle was less than an acre of open field land, with no where to hide. We unloaded our grenade launchers everywhere and just ran around shooting... there was no where then to hide and we had a few minutes before it then shrunk down to nothing....
---
I don't think so. It's stated Excavator armor never entered full production and release.
---
Jesus
---
They are in mining suits, but not Excavator armor.
---
You can sort of liken them to the Ghost People in New Vegas, where they've been fused into their suits after so many years.
---
I doubt that this will be the only activity available to us.  At least it's the major one for the summer but I think there will be some more smaller stuff like Wild Appalachia had.
---
It has a matchmaking system.
---
This.....I have been really surprised just hoe long you can last in the fire with stimpaks.  but, I would put it rule out a bug in your game, it was day 1, I'm sure there will be bugs.
---
Don’t get me wrong, toodooles and all that, but I’m not a BR player, this is the first one I’ve played, and I’m actually enjoying it.
---
Give it chance. If you don’t like it we can always call you a Wambulance.
---
they are not crates, they are skins for your stash box in adventure/survival mode
---
I agree. Especially ttk
---
Most of the lore is level-locked to Overseer ranking. Pretty neat!
---
You can turn off motion blur I believe.
---
Adios!
---
Same here, never actually leveled up but was told I did
---
Yup, TTK is the main thing. It's working great so far in NW.
---
The meta is teamwork.
---
Yes sir, that seems to be the consensus even amongst the most bitter of us.
---
I love it because there's a real challenge to it. What I'm enjoying about NW is that it's a BR buuut also a 'stay alive for as long as you can'. So even if I can't land a shot, avoiding the shots satisfies me! And when I down someone, I feel accomplished. This is such a fun mode, I never expected to enjoy myself with so much player killing. And the amount of teamwork without the use of mics is amazing; I expected a free-for-all but nope, people actually care about their teammates \^\^
---
Does Unyielding benefit guns that much?  I've always looked at it from the Strength and Agility perspective.
---
The damage actually got substantially worse in the last month or so when several new dupe methods came out. 
---
The result was a obscene amount of god-tier armor, and explosive lasers/handmades enter survival mode.
---
I’d salvage it with new characters, and you can’t trade things in from old characters. 
---
There is zero need to remove legendaries from the mode. It took the guys who duped months and months to build those god-tier sets. So long as Bethesda continues to patch duping holes quick, or end it, shouldn’t be an issue imho.
---
If you want non-legendary play fallout battle royale.
---
To be honest, you can beat guys not running any special god-tier weapons or armor in survival, they aren’t needed, you just have to know how to build your character, and what to use.
---
stealthboy + Superstims
---
Played game, made post.. didn’t check game settings..
---
No they are not kids...
---
I bet you weren't 'Board' during THAT fight!
---
Everyone is going to use different keys, for example i always have rifles on 1, melee on 2. stimpaks on 6.
---
You should be able to assign keys to types of weapons, then once a slot is filled have a option of pick up/replace/switch etc.
---
So far this is my only issue with the fundamentals of nuclear winter, and it easily makes a difference from fun and competitive to frustrating.
---
I have no idea.
---
PvP in survival/adventure mode is super unbalanced, consistency for the sake of consistency is a bad idea.
---
As was said, go to the abandoned waste dump. I joined the Enclave at level 13 with my latest character. Don’t try to fight the deathclaws, just avoid them.
---
You can change your appearance. Not the character name though. Go to the menu when you load into a server with whatever character to change their appearance
---
Ok either way how do they work? I've got like 40
---
Not sure why you’re being treated as if your statement is wrong. The only real benefit of a survival mode without PVP is the extra XP and an easier time earning the weekly challenge weapon. I used to think there was more differences (I.e. harder enemies, less loot), but that assumption isn’t reality..
---
and whats wrong with that?  "It just works".  I hate Fortnite, but this is a completely different animal IMHO.
---
Thanks for the replies! I will keep my eyes open. Ive won overseer a few times now, but i really want to drop a nuke on the last remaining team. Lol. I will most likely die trying, but thats my new goal.
---
Cool.  Was kinda worried this would be God-player game only.  Not going to waste my time if I was just going to be one-shot every 5 minutes.  But it sounds like they may have leveled the playing field nicely.  Looking forward to this.  Frankly was starting to have impure thoughts about being... bored... with FO76. 😳
---
Na. Mostly just time spent in game is my major exp gain.
---
Not that I’ve seen. Can’t change the starting photo either. (My character since inception have changed so much, would be nice to change that too.)
---
Can place a suggestion to the Bethesda support site though.
---
24 players a server unless you invite friends then it’s 32 at max I think. You could just google this stuff.
---
I was skeptical, however after playing, I am extremely impressed. I genuinely had a lot of fun with this and can't wait to play more. Good job Bethesda, I have to give you an atta boy for this one.
---
I disagree, I don’t believe NPC were ever planned. They specifically said there would be no human players that were not actual people. The NPC thing is a response to bitching for a more standard single player like experience
---
Not sure what your seeing, I'm running a decent computer,and aren't getting any problems, my friends shitty computer with no problems
---
It's a world spawn plan, doesn't appear on vendors.
---
erm...no you haven't. They unlock based on your Overseer level and their is no way you are level 40+ and asking this question
---
Personally I dislike it, I find myself just putting myself in solo and going afk for 100 exp per run, I just don't like pvp but need the stuff from it plus it hurts no and ups other players chances at winning. Currently ran 19 runs and 2 serious runs which only gave little more then what I've been getting in exp.
---
I think the way it works now is really cool. I’m a bloodied build and I’d say a couple times a week I’ll find a max level bloodied weapon. Now they aren’t 2 or 3 star most of the time but that absolutely have the core requirement of dealing a lot of damage. My only gripe would be some builds aren’t very feasible if you want to hang with everyone else. I read all of your comments and I still can’t find where you offered a solution. I’d like to genuinely hear how you think things should work.
---
ahhhh so it IS a thing! thanks!
---
The "nobody asked for this" argument is fundamentally flawed and really bothers me. First off, it is a sweeping generalization meant to completely disregard other people's opinions. Secondly, the whole point of R&amp;D isn't to give people what they want, but instead give them something they didn't even know they wanted. Historically, the products that have become culturally important are things "we didn't ask for."
---
I really enjoyed the two matches I played. Even playing as shitty as I do in PvP, I got some decent rewards.
---
I actually haven’t explored through there just yet lol
---
How do you know it was only intended for the first year.  You have a source? Because I believe it was intended for the entirety of the game and they backtracked because of complaints
---
I’m just glad there’s no open chat in vault 51 hahaha!
---
I always find the marine wetsuit and helmet plan at the flooded train yard inside the box cars.
---
Games better than launch, still on the road to great. I’d say playable until you get bored now.
---
When Survival was released, everyone left Adventure and jumped to try the new mode out.
---
The playerbase will regulate itself, don't worry. But I haven't noticed much of a difference in Adventure, honestly. More new players, yes, but also high levels.
---
They are doing this a little already with the weekly challenges. The current one was the Unstoppable Monster. It as a 3 star Bloodied DC Gauntlet
---
How long can a stealthboy last?
---
I mean multiplayer is natural progression and I love exploring the waistlands with my friends. Battle Royale however is something completely diffrent, and the games server tick rate is way too low for competition.
---
Similar thing happened to me, person seemed to be perpetually invisible. There was only like 5 feet of space left with a scorch beast firing those sonic blasts on the last remaining area. I was armored up and popping stimpak. When it showed the winner he was naked, no armor at all. No way he should have survived the fire or scorch beast blasts.
---
If a good legendary can make a garbage weapon good, then a good legendary can make a great weapon unbearably strong. 
---
If there were a tiered system where better weapons got worse legendary effects so it all balanced out then fine, but all weapons have equal chances of getting the same legendary effects, meaning they just exacerbate balance issues, forcing even tiny differences in base weapon balance to the forefront.
---
Nice back out xD you won't explain because you can't
---
thats what me and my gf  said yest , we literally at one point said " we should go into PVE to take a break"
---
Thank you. I’ll keep searching.
---
you don't \_need\_ vats for melee.
---
I'm a melee build, L100, have fought and killed every critter (except SBQ), and have never used VATS.
---
wait... we do?! 
---
lvl 68 and haven't explored everywhere yet haha. Where is this testing area?
---
I would but I'm not wondering what the max population on a server is.  thanks though
---
Jesus is different?
---
roughly 20s per each one, and he could have had a few
---
Didn’t know that thanks!
---
I just got back into it and it's fine, stash size is up, thank God, vending machines help interactions since you visit others bases, there are new quest lines, it great.
---
I 100% believe NPC are only being added because people bitched. They specifically stated that they intended to keep humans in the game reserved for real players only
---
It’ll get better.
---
See above. It had to be planned. That's how game dev works. They had the road map out in Feb. They knew they wouldn't be in for launch. I firmly believe that.
---
Increase TTK, disable PvP VATS, for legendaries remove all legendary effects from affecting PvP other than Assassin's.  This way a 1\* Assassin's set is just as good as 3\* Assassin's sentinel, and players have to aim manually so some skills required.  Pretty simple changes but should go a very long way towards making PvP a whole lot more balanced and the increased TTK/no aimbots from NW transfers over too.
---
I know what you mean.  Now I can actually see what things are doing versus trying to deduce it from the health bar.
---
Yes, contrary to what I said before, Endangerol Syringer doesn't seem to work.  At least, it doesn't on Scorchbeasts.  So that's 6 WT back.  My Bloodied Mole Miner Gauntlet really is inferior to my Bloodied Power Fist, but it's probably due to the latter's armor penetration.  I've seen that get up to about 2,300.
---
Is Nuclear Winter now here for good or is this just a sneak peak?
---
I like how they fit it in to the lore so well, we are in one of those vault experiments(Vault 51) we read about in the other Fallouts
---
Exactly this. I’ll totally play it if there’s no ebay legendaries and aimbot vats, making it a true survival for the fittest game. Until then it’s just a match of duped gears.
---
VATS makes this a shooter game where your position means more than your shooting skills. Its completely different set of skills that other shooters require, but its actually  very skill dependent.
---
Okay, there are huge groups of people playing faction based characters that absolutely want more recognizable fallout gear.
---
We can can all this ridiculous looking gear in any of the current crop of games out there, fallout is visually distinct from them and this is going to hurt the brand if this is the only direction we are moving in.
---
You may not want it, but those factions are what make fallout fallout.
---
The NW is new, and its luster will eventually cool down.  I will still pretty much "live" in adventure mode - but will occasionally hop over to NW to get a quick fix of adrenaline.  :)
---
&gt; They specifically stated that they intended to keep humans in the game reserved for real players only
---
I know  they did, and I'm thinking that this was a lie.
---
See above what? For more speculation? There is nothing here but people assuming
---
Hey we all roleplay our own way....
---
And I’m thinking it’s not and they backtracked
---
I wonder if the character name is simply saved client side somewhere.
---
I bought the game sunday so we’re cool right
---
It does matter which character you pick because of their special layout.  I picked up a lucky break luck card for 6pts luck, so only a char with 6 luck or higher can use.  Now I’m not sure what use that is in this format, but it’s clearly restrictive.
---
So in other words if you are planning to play a melee in NW, don’t pick your 3 str sniper.
---
Oh, ok did not know that. I’ll try that.
---
Man this is what I want. Even if I have to go to the vault to do it.
---
Do you play on ps4?
---
gotcha, thanks for the heads up
---
Widgeontv makes really good lore videos on FO76! You should totally check him out!
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
im new started yesterday. is there a way you can clone your camp so everytime you move your camp all your stuff will be set at the camp? Also what stats are the best to focus on?
---
Ohhh ok. And i wasnt far off. I grinded it because I was sick all day yesterday so I'm level 34
---
I was on last night after work and had a level 3 walk up to me in adventure mode. He or she then proceeded to attack me with a machete (I'm 130) I just stood there for a bit then blew up the car right next to us. Then I got on my mic and warned him that if he tries it after level 5, he's a dead man.
---
You really need to learn about consent
---
I’m 30 and run around punching everyone.
---
good effort :)
---
Or a Lone Wander perk for NW. Playing without a team grants 40 DR/ER and 10% ap refresh. 6 charisma.
---
I dont know any normal builds that want 6 charisma so it forces players like me to try something different.
---
I had to unsubscribe from that place. Maybe it’s time...
---
oh, that is strange, i guess i havent actually gone back into adventure mode since, I just saw the notification like you did that i have gained a level, and to return to adventure mode to level up
---
Sarcasm dipweed
---
You unlocked a stash box skin for adventure mode
---
That’s kinda what your post means but yeah your group can be 1-4 but it’s not hard to play with many groups
---
thanks but i’m not asking if i should come back or not, i’m asking what’s NEW and what’s improved.
---
Going through that link it’s just a faq or who will like the game, who won’t, and what’s coming next. i want to know about improved systems or changed mechanics
---
What?
---
I'm 35 and went around punching everyone in the first few matches.
---
Novelty wore off fast and after that I explored, played instruments, occasionally punched someone playing the instrument I wanted to play, or spent the entire wait time in a fist fight with a single person.
---
yeah sorry we'll be back running the same 8 events and clearing the same 5 areas for legendaries soon enough.
---
The playing field is definitely leveled and mainly skill based. Kind of luck as well, and if you have a coordinated team you'll be rocking against the thrown together randos. 
---
The impure thoughts are there, they seem to be keeping up with entertaining us. There just isnt a whole bunch to do on adventure mode, I dont know how people push to level 300+ 
---
Really loving what they are doing and I will keep on playing.
---
Haha I only played PUBG a couple times when it was new, but holy shit joining that open voice chat was the worst. Everyone was screaming like monkeys, and it went from dead quiet to 1000 decibels all at once.
---
Thanks for the info, man.
---
Did he by chance give you a pipe rifle and ammo?
---
Also check out Oxhorn
---
u/Oxhorn
---
You are not wrong. The whole legendary system jacked this franchise up in the worst way. I cannot tell you how happy I am they didn't include them in Nuclear Winter.
---
So when does it launch? I was thinking of buying the game but, if it's not there yet, I might hold off.
---
All shooters require spatial/map awareness.  VATS is just wrong and totally not skills based, its just builds based.  I know you're heavily invested into VATS but I hate to say it - its a crutch and not player skills based.
---
Check the raider areas east of top of the world. There’s always a ton of plans beside the workbenches and stuff. I check it daily, it’s where I found mine.
---
i'm in adventure mode. mostly because i'm stuck there after making a free trial account to mule my old characters inventory to my new one. now my new chick can barely move. really wish we had more stash storage atm
---
Survival should be different than nk (battle royale), not similar.
---
There are many players, myself included, who spent alot of time tweaking builds, and trading for the right items to be competitive in survival mode.
---
It’s still in “beta” and imho when permanent survival servers come out everyone should start at lvl 1, and you can’t trade items in off your other characters. 
---
Camps should be destructible again, other than that all the other rules currently in survival are good as they are.
---
You don’t need top-tier gear to win or get top weekly placement in survival tbh. Even with all the duped weapons and armor it still is a game of skill.
---
It gives you alot of carry weight and many more benefits, like vats ect
---
I was more asking like is it a game like 7 Days to Die where the main objective is to build and survive zombies.  Or is it like Rust where the main objective is to build and survive other players.  So essentially, is it more pvp or more pve?
---
Not if you kill people or win.
---
I have never been banned from a Bethesda game. My first account was temporarily suspended. I still have access to all other titles on that account.
---
I get what you're saying, and I completely agree that the biggest change they could make to improve balance is to force new characters and lock them to the mode.
---
But the fact that new dupe methods continue to occur just shows me the issue will come back no matter what they do.
---
All I'm saying is survival mode has basically no draw to it with Nuclear Winter being out, aside from the weekly rewards. It needs something to set it apart from both adventure and nuclear winter to keep it populated. Some more significant balance and gameplay changes could do the trick.
---
Yeah, markers shouldn't show up for them unless you fail your stealth check vs their Perception stat.  Assuming that's not how it already works.
---
That's how I just survived, ish, on the map I just played. I hid most of the time. But in the end, the guy was a literal walking tank in plated armor, so I didn't do a lot of damage to him vs my scout armor. But it was nice not to die within 3 minutes.
---
I use third person for looking around and moving. But first person for shooting.
---
I'm sure it's all on the way. Chill out.
---
Because it is a death sentence. Although I did kill a man with a grognaks axe last night.
---
When I played last night, the server I was on had 2 people over level 100 and the rest were below 50.  It was cool seeing the new players wandering around in the Forest.
---
Just an FYI it looks like the key bindings all got reset including in adventure mode.  I'm left handed so I change a lot
---
That is literally how game development works. You spend 2-4 years planning and getting the approval of your investors (publishers) and spending another 2-4 years in development. They launched with the intention of live service, which has to require at least a year of planned content.
---
Lol it's been 1 day, chill the fuck out. Everyone tries the new thing when it's launched.
---
Not really sure of the need or seeing the armor of your opponent in this BR.  Someone explain it to me like I’m 5.  Are you going to not shoot at them if they are in higher level armor?  Seems like target=hail of bullets and the armor just makes for more of a hail.  Has anyone ever changed tactics because of their target’s armor type?
---
I like being a giant amongst the babies!
---
With a proper build and twink gear, it's possible. I was killing level 100+ in Survival at level 12.
---
Nuclear Winter is a DLC... If you don't like it, you don't have to play it. I'm not even a big BR fan but I rather enjoy that I get to do it in a universe I'm very fluent in. They've likly had a plan to make a BR mode since before launch.
---
Yeah wtf is up with that? Power armor might as well not be there.
---
yeah we totally want to write a FAQ for you.
---
Disapproving Vault Boy: randomly-dropped legendary weapons
---
Approving Vault Boy: quest-rewarded unique weapons
---
You’re right. I’m not. And as an uncompelling person I don’t want to lose my one and only friend. I’d prefer to spare him the awkwardness of having to tell me he doesn’t want to play with me when I show up unannounced at his camp. If I’m blocked I shouldn’t be able to find him
---
its true, the small crate is just a picture of a small crate you can use as a player icon.
---
The one time my team actually stuck together we won. None of us were amazing players we just stayed together, I think what made us last team standing was we always revived each other. I think all of us were downed at least twice, but we always picked each other back up and all of us survived to the end. Should’ve friend requested those three...
---
Thank you for solving that mystery. I was trying all the various menus and sub-menus and even switched over to Adventure mode to see if the crate I'd unlocked would spawn or something.
---
i have more fun solo in this game than i've ever had with friends. maybe at end game multiplayer is fine but leveling up solo is fine. theres no hand holding, no fighting over loot, no waiting around for your friends to all listen to or read quest holos and terminals and theres no pressure to speed up that process and miss out on story. the biggest appeal to this, and other fallout games, is roaming exploration. something thats not as easy or peaceful when you're with someone else.
---
They don't guarantee your mods will work though so there's always the peril of an update breaking mods.  Its painful once you're used to having mods.
---
there are the patch notes at the bottom which cover what changed each time :)
---
Yea I think so too, the texture was there but the rendering was way off.
---
Use adrenaline for the time being. Just as good.
---
This was the nerf to non legendary explosives way back.
---
Mkay.
---
also the hazmat suit if you can find one....you can last in the storm for awhile with it.
---
Seems to me that your play style is the issue. I was the same way, but you don’t need to hoard in this game. If you want to collect something then drop the shit items and keep what’s good. Just cause you find a minigun for the first time doesn’t mean you need to keep it. Especially if it’s not legendary and 90% reduced weight. 
---
Also there is perk cards for reducing weight of weapons, ammo, junk, and chems. 
---
If your level 50 and the weapon isn’t legendary it’s a waste. 
---
If your level 100 and the weapon isn’t 2 or 3 star it’s a waste
---
Junk can be found again and again. No need to hoard.
---
Magazines and treasure maps aren’t worth hoarding use or sell them and can also be found again and again.
---
With vending machines people buy up cheap ammo quick.
---
I tried this on the Xbox last night. Didn’t work just walking up to him. Tried quit the game,reload didn’t work. Then tried the way you did it,load it up from the personal terminal. What are you playing on?
---
I'm lvl 14 now and got some rewards
---
Look I may or may not have a serious furry problem and I may or may not from time to time find my self spun up and wandering the waste with someone guts around my neck. What what was I talking about?
---
Xbox, same as you.
---
This really turn me down because reading about the X-02 plans sent to Vault 51 got me excited (not about some fancy painting sent to Vault 51).
---
Heck yes. Anything good?
---
I only got to play a couple matches last night, so like level 3 or 4
---
he never asked about max population he asked if the game is fun for small groups or is it made for large groups. up your reading comprehension game
---
Oh the bonus damage. They get a bonus when they're low level and it evens out at 50. Let me guess a bloodied sniper rifle with perf mag using chems/bock?
---
Ah that's probably one I didn't keep track of - if so glad they reverted even if by accident.  No one wants a missile launcher/fat man so they were so much dead weight in game.
---
lol same, in one of the challenges I have all the items checkmarked yet it still says incomplete.
---
You can always mute your party
---
I am a mainly a PvP players in most games. They way I see it, Survival is just hide and seek - a campfest in which players stay behind a bush waiting for someone to VATS.
---
There's no skill involved at all.
---
When I was lvl 45 I was killing lvl &gt;100 players in a couple shots with my explosive rifle build and some chems
---
Seriously, they should just disable all legendary effects period in pvp. Especially in survival mode. This is just so much better than dealing with BS legendary meta.
---
Laaaaame! :)
---
Yep. I have friends who mock me for liking the game, and shit all over it... despite having never played it themselves.
---
Try thinking for yourself for a change! Just cuz it was written in some gaming article doesnt mean you have to blindly agree with it!
---
Aside from just making it super useless with melee I don't think there is fixing it. Even in previous titles there was vats teleporting.
---
2k-4k adventure exp? no way....
---
lol noone wants to share info i guess
---
i just choose a spot after most of my teammates do
---
Id also be interested in good places to spawn, but isnt all the loot random anyway&gt;
---
Yes, you are correct.. I was just saying that the Vendor machines..... became our fast travel mats.
---
yeah.. I miss being able to use every perk available too..
---
I think its better this way...
---
Are you sure he’s attacking you? Not just shooting at the ground nearby or trying to get your attention? 
---
Most high levels you meet when you’re new will come by and drop things in a bag for you. Then they’ll shoot at the bag to point to it. 
---
It seems that most Vault 76 residents, while largely friendly and helpful have lost their ability to speak. Now they communicate with a combination of shooting, hitting and grunting and various hand gestures. 
---
This guy could very well just be a griefing moron, but people dropping things and being helpful are far more common in this game. With the free trial there are a lot of players spending the week just gifting stuff to the newbies.
---
I don't think there's been an officiant release for it, but I could be wrong. I just haven't seen it. 
---
I'd say play the trial and if you like it, just get it while it's 1/2 off and save some money on the long run, instead of waiting to buy after the fact. Then, you'll at least have it and you can wait for it to fully release.
---
What exactly did you update in the custom ini?  
---
I tried that but this and other mods are not loading, specifically those using:
---
sResourceStartUpArchiveList     
---
sResourceArchiveMisc
---
It would make sense that they do this.....the Mire would be awesome too
---
Good thing I won't play 76 right now.
---
he had a basic laser rifle, He clearly had played before so I'm guessing it was someone who has other characters. It jsut floored my friend we have never seen anything like that(Then again level 15 doesn't usualy try to take us on lol)
---
I’m on PS4 also. A friend and I have tested this by blocking each other, making sure the console shows us as offline, etc.. but we were able to easily see each other in game. I feel like even just an icon to show that we’re not really feeling like company would help
---
Of course, how silly of me to think that using a perk loadout manager is any different from rape!
---
So you dont have a camp anymore? Or are you saying you deleted all turrets and then deleted all stored items and are still at max budget? That sounds to me like you ended up way over budget, to the point that maybe deleting those items didnt move the needle in your favor. Do you have neon lights, signs and/or billboards? Those got a significant increase in the amount of budget they take up. So while you would have previously been able to build all those items together, now they have put you hopelessly over budget and would themselves need to be deleted for you to free up space. That would be my best guess based on the patch notes and what I saw at my camp with the Nuka Quantum, Pickaxe Pilsner and Old Possum lights I have in place.
---
The only thing I could see is having a separate single player mode when they do full release
---
Agreed, some way of re-queuing needs to be added
---
It's pretty great.  The left side of the map is jumping, but they mostly haven't moved across the Savage Divide, yet.  Every time I log in I get the Mire and Bog to myself, but if I feel like being social I can jump over to the Forest and help with events, drop off care packages, etc.
---
If its burning like the fires in NW then you should see a doctor, some penicillin should clean that right up
---
I've been doing this too. I've set up camp on the rived just between the bridge by Overseer's camp, and plan on having free nukashine available (1 at a time lol)
---
I gave a new player some leather gear, a gun and a bottle of shine.
---
1/2 off on the PS Store is still more than actual physical game stores are selling it for.
---
I put mine in the bathroom in the back corner of my house, under the stairs. There's also a toilet in there.
---
I don't have a sink so please wash off in the decon shower after using the toilet, thanks.
---
oh, man.. I wish Bethesda would add that.. but Please, Stability fixes first as always.
---
&gt;That said, it's down at the moment :(
---
Just in NW or in adventure mode too?
---
It’s his build/perks/chems. Probably a bloodied build. Absolutely possible
---
It depends. 50 cal is a powerful weapon but it won't do much good if it spawned with an instigating prefix. Pipe bolt action on the other hand, it ain't that good of a weapon but an instigating pipe bolt action can be very useful and will finish off most enemies with a single shot. Every weapon has it's uses. You just have to know how to build your character around it to maximize efficiency
---
Agree with you.
---
Imho, duping, and Bethesda’s slow response to it has, and is, slowly killing the game. Duping removed the grind for the vast majority of the player-base.
---
The fact they seemingly can’t track items beyond stacks is archaic. Guys create multiple Xbox profiles, and mule accounts and just spread out their duped wares. FFS, put a couple humans on reddit, and the Facebook buy/sell/trade groups and you will see quickly what’s been copied or not.
---
Nothing is worse in adventure mode than doing Uranium fever, and a guy shows up with a bloodied explosive laser one hitting all the legendaries. 
---
Adventure mode is a complete joke, survival mode frankly is as well. Battle royale (nuclear winter) is fun, but I’m sure people will tire with it (I enjoy it) 
---
We will see what Bethesda has in store over the next few months.
---
Thanks for your report (and thank you for the video)! We're looking into this.
---
Did you read the hunger games? Everyone who lost died.
---
Ok thanks, I'll try it
---
You also get caps. Not a lot, but some.
---
Not quite 100% sure but probably not as there is no firm confirmation and the game already has something like it, the assaultron head.
---
Leeeeeeeroy A-Jenkiiiiiiiiiiins
---
yeah when i was exploring at lvl 5 i found a holotape that said i needed to be level 89 to use it... i was like..???
---
Hah. Hardly. Hell, My crew in OW is all in their 40s... we spend all our time in lobby squat-dancing and spamming "I need healing"... 
---
...and if there's only 5 of us? That poor rando...
---
This'd be my second choice, *especially* if it was nightime. Night in the Mire has such a cool vibe to it, and it'd add a good slice of variety if they didn't go the route of day/night versions of all the maps.
---
I like to blend in with the environment in most games that I play. Can't do that with a blue vault suit.
---
Would have been funnier if you were able to select any of your cosmetic items from adventure mode. Just show an armor bar above the health bar and there wouldn't be a problem.
---
Yea, just tested it.  You can use 7 STR cars if you want.  But only up to your special points limit.  Very good to know.  I was able to stack some cards nicely.
---
I really don't think there's much to be done - I've had great teammates as a group as if a moving army of one... then they leave the pack to do their own thing and we lose a teammate. If you want a solid team, best to create on if you ask me 🙂
---
yeah that’s not what i’m asking but sorry for showing an interest in the game.
---
you could just say “combat mechanics are improved and enemies have been rebalanced plus new dungeons” or something like that.
---
but thanks for your help
---
I love how fast it is, no 30 minutes without seeing anyone. Is loot and shoot.
---
Thanks it worked, those big mothman signs take up a lot of budget.
---
i’ll go through those thanks
---
Hasnt been for the whole year. Game's been pretty stable since january, in that aspect.
---
this is something that would be useful for every game mode, but the ability to choose what hotkey an item is equipped on, or even the ability to choose where certain types of items get set on your favorites bar when picked up, for example, stimpacks go on the 3 and 5 key, weapons go on the 1 and 2 key, etc. This feature would help to reduce time fumbling around in menus significantly.
---
My carry wait out of power armor is 450 to 500 lbs so depending on how low my health is so I’m not sure my solutions would be much help to you. Wear the excavator power armor with calibrated shocks.
---
good call!
---
Just sit in the wagon all day waiting with that line in your pocket
---
Yeah but you don't sell a book with only the first chapter completed. People were sold a whole book, not the first chapter with the rest coming sometime next year maybe.
---
Are you strictly buying digitally?
---
I love where we are too.. And I'm not sure there is ever an "end game" for me. I just love bouncing around. Doing challenges (when they are sane, and achievable, lately it's a good balance)
---
I have to disagree with you, you most definitely don’t have to camp waiting to vats someone, or camp train stations, much more fun to go and explore the map.
---
Imho there’s zero skill in this battle royale mode with your logic. Just run, and gun. You can hide in a bush and wait to kill someone, or just build a big ass camp in the safe zone and wait out till the end.
---
I hope they do, because a Battle Royale mode was literally the last thing I was wanting out of FO76.  I mean I felt like they gutted their NPC announcement by following it up with a BR mode.
---
I will literally never actively desire to play this mode.  I'm glad it's there for people who want it, but I really don't like this approach Bethesda's taking where they're sticking literally every kind of gametype into FO76 to see what sticks/try to claim this game can be everything to everyone.
---
WoW had those when I played. Very helpful
---
im BR on an alt for this reason.  My mains did not fit.  
---
Really sucks for people not like me who do not have three 50+ characters to mess around with already.
---
Blocking mods for people playing NW makes sense, but mods using the following aren't loading in Adventure mode either:
---
sResourceStartUpArchiveList      
---
I'm using a font icon mod, and a widescreen mod that adapts the HUD and UI to my unsupported monitor aspect ratio. Icons are just for quality of life but without the widescreen mod it's hard to play the game at all as the HUD, UI, and text are stretched and distorted, and map and quest markers don't align with the correct place on the screen.
---
Please block everything in NW to keep it fair, but at least let us load UI mods in Adventure, please!
---
About two months ago I made it my mission to create a low level PvP troll character.  Fully specced it for damage (Iron fist) or damage mitigation (serendipity) as best as I could and was running a lvl 12-13 bloodied build using a lvl5 bloodied meathook as the primary weapon. 
---
I had the relevant mutations like twisted muscles,  talons, adrenal reaction etc. and had teammates share higher level perk cards like incisor. 
---
I'd initiate by hitting people,  and usually they'd fight back probably assuming that a low level had no chance.  They were hilariously wrong more often than not, and even at that low of level I was killing non-PvP specced players in one or two hits.
---
Good times :)
---
You can find it at harper's ferry too in a display case. The train he's talking about is between watoga station and the nar repair yard.
---
Is there a way to set up NW perk cards besides during the lobby time?
---
Both.
---
Adventure Mode is 7 Days to Die.
---
Survival mode is Rust.
---
Nuclear Winter beta is Fortnite/PUBG.
---
Oversimplifying there, but gives an idea of scope. None of the modes are like Ark where you need a massive group of players.
---
You can team up with other groups, but your direct team can only be 1-4 players.
---
Exactly. This isn't Minecraft HG lmao
---
That's staying alive till the final or second final circle.
---
You can leave whenever you want with no penalty
---
Upvote for visibility 🙂
---
Hey if your structures are tied together (on the same foundation) it will automatically create a blueprint that you can set down when you place your camp again. Keep in mind terrain constraints and larger trees being issues when placing down large foundations.
---
That’s awesome to hear!!!
---
I found after I died I could not reconnect to a Nuclear Winter server until the match was over.   It would be awesome to just go back to the vault and wait. 
---
Having said that. It seems like a fight club in the vault with all the jumpsuits removed and fists flying.
---
I think they should just set the default option to solo que.. seems pretty obvious to me, that way there isn’t an excuse that they didn’t mean to or that they didn’t know it was an option
---
It's not *fast* but it's definitely quicker than Halo, if that helps.
---
&gt; In normal adventure mode people rarely use favorites 
---
Uh, in adventure I more or less only use favorites or switch between last weapon, the menu is too slow.
---
Is it this ?
---
[X01](https://imgur.com/gallery/uS5iFxr)
---
Well now that I've had a chance to try it, I will admit it's leaps and bounds better than the game's default pvp. (Since stuff is at least somewhat balanced without legendary traits.) I still don't find the gamemode fun, but I can see it being fun for someone who likes this sort of gameplay. There was definitely a LOT of development time spent on making this though, lots of mechanics, item placement, total weapon/gear/item rebalance/re-coding, perk system overhaul, etc. They could have added a LOT of fun pve gameplay with the time spent making this instead. But I'll admit, this will definitely give the pvp crowd what they wanted and we PVE guys get the next major patch so... yeah not the end of the world.
---
&gt;  after the November beta so switched to... Being a long time Fallout fan... ?
---
That’s probably how it will be in full release, you que up in there or explore it.
---
To be fair, I'm 25, and my brother and I had a tag team match with two randoms in the wrestling wring, and that involved nothing but punching and blocking, but I am a moron so that probably explains that :)
---
Added you!
---
i made my camp in the woods. Would it create a blueprint righht away?

&gt;Especially if it’s not legendary and 90% reduced weight.
---
Hnnng Daisycutter
---
Yeah but I mean Fallout 4 also the the assaultron head
---
I killed someone with a knife
---
I’ve been in Flatwoods for an hour passing out guns, ammo, and stims to welcome the new players. I’m having a blast!
---
happens.
---
lots of bad teammates out there..
---
like the people who loot every crate and then run off on their own.
---
Same, I do a quick scan of the surroundings and jump back to first person. I seem to jump back and forth between the two a bunch
---
feels good to me right now..
---
as it is often when I go for loot its already picked clean in most of the popular areas
---
also.. server performance...
---
THIS POST HAS BIG PEE PEE ENERGY
---
Changing your Beth name isn't impossible either, you just submit a ticket and ask
---
It might be an alternate way to level up new characters to 50 when creating baby alts.  I'd rather do it on my low BR characters for maximum benefit - its not like I need the levels on my 200+.
---
Because it’s a kill count, not a downed count. As said above they can still be revived.
---
Okay
---
It's only a matter of time before Papa Smurf and his gang find a wormhole into the dev room for this new game mode. Or how to glitch weapons and armor for it. LMFAO
---
ah man.. that sucks..
---
Epic story, bro. Thanks for sharing
---
There's loads of people in flatwoods. I feel like a major quest must happen there that I've forgotten about.
---
Sorry, I'll go shoot myself now.
---
Yeah I can't argue with that, it's sort of like a side minigame when your bored to crap of doing your 5 millionth run of westtek, and it's definitely am improvement on the game's hilariously bad default pvp gameplay, even if this isn't really for me.
---
That is a bad comparison and you know it, We aren't talking about a particular legendary here, but legendary effects in general.
---
And instigating is probably one of the least critical ones here. So if you want to use only one the prime candidate is bloodied.
---
And the weapons you are comparing are apples and tuna. Comparing guns in general is a poor example due to the fact there is less overlap, melee is a better comparison point.
---
A sledgehammer beats a golf club. Both are 2 handed melee. One is great and one is garbage.
---
A bloodied golf club is useful, good even, but a bloodied sledgehammer is so far and away better that you would be crazy to use anything else.
---
The already good weapon benefits many times more from a good legendary effect, so there is still no reason to use a golf club, it's just a garbage version of another weapon.
---
We still talking about fallout, right?
---
 Can’t be bought,  once you find it you can but the first two upgrades, but the last two are gonna take you about 30 runs of census violence to get.  You might be best off just buying a full one.
---
I have been itching to do the same, I didnt know it was an in world item. Thought I had to get it out of a container or terminal.
---
I wish you could at least rest your weapon in crouch like you can standing up too.
---
But yeah, need more weapon based poses.
---
Cool, thanks.
---
PICNIC
---
Do we know how many are on a map?
---
That’s a fatman but yea lol. It’s a decent weapon till you find some real stuff.
---
Just a warning, using any mods will make you unable to join nuclear winter
---
Hey man, I don’t know about you. But if we’re killing each other and we don’t even have a Fashion statement, we clearly are going back into Stone Ages.
---
Intermittently*
---
I revived 3 different people in PA yesterday in NW, but only once did I freeze which was the 2nd time.
---
Party up in the main menu, and party leader starts the match
---
Well you will be happy to know that the fatman got a stealh buff of +100% damage in the last patch, missile launcher too. I kid you not.
---
Rubble. Busted stuff. Dirt floors. 
---
More "rot".
---
Absolutely this. I’ve actually run into a few dupers, one level 2 was blatantly attempting to sell full set sent-ass armors to people stopped by his vending machine. Unfortunately I forgot to save the clip. Will do and report if I encounter another.
---
Yeah I used to play pubg alot a while back so I'm already pretty used to the whole switching between the two.
---
Awesome thanks!
---
a lovely side effect of this is that I am getting way more bobbles and mags than I used to..
---
I think instead of doing their regular loot/exp loops many people are grinding in winter..
---
So is the crossbow automatic now or was this guy cheating just played my first match started shooting a guy with a 10mm and shot me 5 times with a crossbow without ever reloading it
---
Did you manage to fix it?
---
Under your camp build menu you should have a section for Blueprints, which allows you to do exactly what you're saying.
---
As far as stats go, it's kind of a personal thing and depends on if you want a melee build, rifleman build, etc.  When I first started, I focused my SPECIAL points on QOL perks such as carrying more junk, finding more ammo and aid...basically just stuff to help keep my ass alive.  Once I wasn't constantly scrounging for ammo, water, food, and materials, I started switching my perk cards so they were more combat oriented.   After level 50, you get the ability to start switch perk points from one category to another, which really lets you refine your build.
---
Lmao at least he started off with his team
---
I can't say 'every', but most plans I've bought, I've found multiple times and given away for free. Just stock up on one and give to the other.
---
yeah i cant wait for this. watching play styles change in different areas as well...far fewer places to hide in the flats of the toxic valley
---
I think this is fairly doable, a lot of people may not even know that they’re joining teams.
---
Same...have you found a solution?
---
Three launches within 5 minutes on Fissure Prime last night by a friend of mine and her friends.
---
So yeah.
---
I got a kill with Grognak's Axe on someone wearing power armor last night, it was glorious!
---
I was 100% opposed to the thought of BR in Fallout 76… until I played it. I’ve never gotten into any of the big BR games, but I find myself having fun with this. I think what keeps me playing, though, is the promise of unlocking stuff I can use in Adventure mode. 🤓
---
Hmm good to know maybe I'll just run with it.  Plus it'll be fixed eventually if I ever did want to use it.
---
Nice, That is a gun a really want.
---
Your attitude so far has been to simply dismiss or ridicule anything you don't understand. You're aggressively ignorant and proud of it while demanding people explain complicated things to you. Do you think that comes off as being sincere and worthy of the time it would take?
---
Sorry I didn’t enjoy it on release?
---
Glad to see other are testing the damage legendary effects on weapons as well...
---
&gt;Thanks for the praise
---
Well deserved.
---
Ok, Like I said I know the field and devs generally are not the issue. They just want to keep their jobs as they enjoy what they are doing as their kool personalities show through. Additionally if they said, "ya, it's the guy standing over there that knew we had issues but said push the code anyway. ... They have to do what they are told.
---
You forgot to add *tips fedora* at the end of that bud lol
---
who the fuck knows what you consider fun. try it.
---
I don't think so.
---
Hellfire paint for all PA confirmed
---
less peer pressure.
---
I played a little NW but for some reason I forgot VATS existed and I couldn’t aim worth a shit
---
With an interesting environment, lots of water and tight packed tress, low visibility, sparse but large closed of dark buildings, a sense of doom, and lots long spaces, that'd be sick.
---
Ashheap, Savage divide, Mire, and CB would all have different good things about them. The wide open CB with it's trenches would be sick.
---
It actually disables a number of mods even in Adventure and Survival mode. Anything loading in the following keys is not working AT ALL:
---
UI mods for unsupported aspect ratios and Icon mods are broken completely, even for non-NW modes.
---
Ooooh your comment makes me want to check it out. I am always looking for my COD MW multiplayer fix
---
why don't you just go through their damn website and the update posts that itemize all of these things in a convenient format.
---
You know you can reequipp it in your inventory to replace the vault suit
---
Yup, shows just badly Bethesda screwed up the legendary system. I don't think the system itself is a horrible idea, but the power they give you is broken to a cosmic level. They should be toned down immensely and totally reworked to be more like +5% damage, +10% rate of fire, gain 10% movement speed. Simple practical bonuses that give you and edge, but are not comically overpowered giving you +150% damage.
---
That’s what /s is for
---
Yea
---
I tried pubg once. But i accidentally started this habit because it was way easier to keep moving forward while watching my surroundings. I have "getting used to it" to go
---
They should let players exchange unused perks for additional perk slots. Say if you have 40 unused perks, you can swap them for one extra slot. This will keep people grinding long and hard. Who doesn’t want a few more perk slots!
---
well i hope so, i got a win next game anyway. so it alright just wanted to ask.
---
Well, if you just down a player they're not dead... so technically that is not a kill.
---
I'm level 92 and this has happened to me once. I restarted the game, worked fine.
---
*Sixty Minute Man intensifies in the distance*
---
Thanks you info !
---
I do too especially for chems and regular use items but most seem to not use or barely use this feature for whatever reason.
---
&gt;  I don't mind waiting an extra week if it means the content is a bit more polished
---
So true, Bethesda we love your products (well not the bugs) and will support you if your late.. but please STABILITY man.. it HAS to be job #1
---
Don’t forget to donate your savings first.
---
Korean Jesus is.
---
What do you get for winning
---
Btw Im a level 35
---
Yeah that is the part i am nto cool with. I have decent parts to my cpu and  many of my load ins involve being stuck in place as the match fades in yet others are already opening boxes.  That is a problem when 12 people pick one town.
---
I give 100 caps to any newbies I come across
---
Yeah there's always going to be that element. I just like playing with my regular team which has a range of abilities and we have fun. If we win, that is also nice. I am laughing at the folk wanting VATS though. It would just turn into a case of whoever has most AP and happens to shoot first. Not fun.
---
You get a blue camo skin for the 44. At lvl 9. A shark war paint skin for the 10mm at lvl 13 I think too
---
Non-functional in adventure mode. The author is quite amazing and generally has it back up quite quickly each patch :)
---
who gives a shit. its just an extra mode for kicks.
---
If encountering a single bug is going to be that big of an issue for you, then this game isn’t for you. It will never be 100% bug free. 
---
Most bugs aren’t that drastic, but at least a little bit of patience is required.
---
Praise is not given when you fix a wrong, but for doing something very right in the first place. Reconciliation is given for fixing a wrong that you have done. I reccomend that you do not mix the two.
---
uhhh...Make all the weapons and armor edible. Yummy!
---
You're also unable to load UI mods in Adventure and Survival modes.
---
no, not at all, i should have added a caveat that there is indeed a dedicated boxing ring which is pretty cool
---
Yeah but what if you got a mutant's supersledge and a bloodied gold club? I'd definitely go for the golf club if that was the case. And what if you had to choose between a junkie's supersledge and a bloodied golf club? I'd go for the sledge obviously. You can't expect to come up with a god roll all the time. Sometimes you have to make a choice and learn to live with what you got and build your character around it. Same goes for yo life
---
Mine was like that yesterday too. Thought it was because I was in a team with someone who hadn't unlocked it yet, but it still didn't work after he logged off. Oh, and I did a server hop too.
---
why would you think anyone would give a damn
---
FWWIW, I've had to cycle through a few of his generic lines before I've gotten the daily to start. "Activate" him a few more times.
---
Agreed, since you need a custom SPECIAL layout JUST for this mode since perks wildly vary from the base game's point requirements. (+9 luck for bloody mess, almost noone has +9 luck on a pve build.)
---
I felt like Rick Grimes at the end of season three when he realized the Walkers aren’t the enemy, other humans are.   Ghouls and Super Mutants are just background noise compared to a meeting a squad in NW.
---
No, I'm just saying that for anyone reading it. The PS Store (and I think Xbox Store too?) have it half off here in the UK for £29.99 down from £59.99 but many stores are selling a physical copy for £25 or so.
---
Yeah that was getting my gears twisted last night. I couldn't even get to a single box and the the team split and I was left naked. Ended up being the last alive on my team from the sear force of hiding.
---
Adventure Mode? WTF Solo mode? XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Untick the autojoin party button (?)
---
You mad lad
---
Ammo becomes completely weightless if you have Bandoiler/Stack Reduced Ammo Weight armor though...
---
idk i died. but xp i think.
---
That's how they get you!! Hahaha! 
---
For real though. I love it. It's highly entertaining.
---
/r/madlads
---
It's completely free.
---
Skin for 44. At lvl 9 i think. Shark skin at 13 for 10mm, x0-1 skin at lvl 15.
---
Cool !
---
meh. I had a blast during beta and launch. I'd stay away just to spare us the whining.
---
How do you plan on splitting xp and caps between multiple characters? Just Overseer rank, not all rewards. If you wanted that you would either get so little xp from being split or the same amount to all of your characters. If it's the former, it's not worth playing for 5 xp per character. If it's the latter, it would be the only game mode to play seeing as how you'd essentially level characters 5x faster if you had 5 characters...
---
I've played pubg for over 2 years and i still punch people... Everyone once in a while the pack mentality kicks in and I can get like 30 people all trying to punch the same person, it's slightly amuses me.
---
I don't know but is the same in survival. PA is useless in pvp.
---
Yeah but nevertheless it's just a bummer if you read a terminal and whoosh - game starts.
---
TNT dome 2
---
As much as I hate to admit it, I kinda liked the BR. The new mode is balanced and very well executed. I won't be spending all of my time there, but it's something new to break things up.
---
Well, there it is, you don't actually want to learn something, which is exactly what I expected from you.
---
Also, to add to that, ZAX read through Stanlislaus Braun's writings and copied the way he wrote. Then used that to create the requisition for the X-02 Power Armor. Stanislaus Braun is also the Overseer from Vault 112 which was the VR vault from Fallout 3 that you enter.
---
Buy FO76 and play it as long as it exists.  There is no monthly fee for FO76 and all the DLC is free.  The only thing you spend cash on is Atoms for cosmetics and repair kits in the store, atoms are also earned free in the game.
---
Yup, having to bumper crowds instead of just unloading lol. My favorite perk is broken 😭
---
Hi! Thanks for the report. Quick question - Is this happening in Nuclear Winter, Adventure Mode, or both?
---
Funny, the only issue I have is with scorched and ghouls crawling around on their backs or knees
---
I'm i the only one that has a problem with automatic guns? It's straight up the only complain i have about this mode for now. They just don't fire properly and end up in some kind of weird bug.
---
Many thanks!
---
They're so cute! I like their rosy little cheeks.
---
Another awful one is when they hoard ammo they’ll never use, so then the corresponding guns from the box become useless
---
Own the game get it fo freeee.
---
With a vats Crit to the head, not even the most advanced power Armour the enclave had to offer can save you friend.
---
Wait, you can destroy your own camp resources?  I have been trying like hell to smash a wall in my camp because I like the look of holes in the brickwork better than doorways but can't do any damage to it at all.
---
All the DLC and play modes are free. The only cost is the base game. They have said future DLC will be free as well.
---
&gt; It reminds me of playing COD in the good ole days
---
Ya, COD got stupid in the end.. running on walls.. etc.. MW3 was the best..
---
Stay at your core, people will love you for it.
---
There are unlockable icons, and stash box(es) *I've only unlocked one, i believe an overseeker chair at lvl 9 and once lvl 10 you can go behind the laser grid 
---
(XBOX)
---
I figured that, I guess the free trial must be for new users
---
Unless they fixed it, get a full suit of weightless armor and the chameleon mutation. Can't be VATS'd
---
oh well, gotta love that!!!!
---
The game hasn’t crashed for me in forever it’s something with your computer
---
Exactly. This type of hysteria is a personality trait that transcends all aspects of life.
---
Everything is an over reaction intended to signal ones virtue, and moral calibre. In this case it's something which literally affects nobody in the game except for the people that do it, and everyone is wound up into a frenzy.
---
They would be the sort of people that would have sold their neighbours to the Gestapo to get a few social points lol.
---
So furious is amazing
---
You need to be somewhat patient with the game sometimes, but since you couldn't even simply restart the game, I don't recommend the game to you, or many other games for that matter.
---
And having region appropriate clothing, aka camo, would actually be useful.  The Western Duster for example is great camo in the forest.
---
[I thought it was this Zach](https://imgix.bustle.com/rehost/2016/9/13/0044db87-1b1c-4e1b-915b-7c1438cd6210.jpg?w=970&amp;h=546&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70)
---
Do you have to invite by social in main menu or by xbox live?
---
Please don't tell me that's an ongoing thing to this day. I spent 3-4 hours downloading it on PC and PS4 and if it's still in that state why bother?
---
Do you have heal salves in your inventory? They heal but have no animation. I have noticed they have priority over stimpacks too when I use the stimpack quick use button (but I am on xbox).
---
Gotcha. Just curious, cause I know games hardly ever go down in price digitally at all, except for sales like these.
---
Is it possible he waited next to a radiation barrel and got the chameleon mutation?
---
Would you say faster than apex? That’s probably the slowest TTK I’ve played.
---
Keep calm and farm Whitesprings
---
pass on the crossplay, but more tools to get people together is a nobrainer. I think once they start doing faction systems we will see more.
---
It happened for about 15 min last night, first time I’ve seen it with scorched.
---
Ghouls haven’t been getting off their backs on occasion for awhile
---
Fresh meat!
---
That is just ironic!!!
---
Up Voted.
---
Nuclear winter is garbage just another mindless battle royale boring ass experience
---
imo*
---
Thanks for the report! We're going to look into this.
---
It is useless in survival due to legendary effects. If there was no legendary effects in survival you would last quite a bit longer in PA than you do now. Bot sire what they did in NW but its almost like it isn't applying damage reduction at all.
---
Check out the lone train car just outside of watoga. Follow the tracks, inside there spawns a Tommy gun some 45 ammo and on the crates are the plans. You might have to server hop a few times but it should be there.
---
Survival is the mode no one wanted...
---
Thank you for your reports! We're going to investigate each of them.
---
Get rid of legendaries in survival. Problem solved
---
I can play Fallout 4 with 300 mods fine. The Sims 4 with 10,000 mods, no biggie. Fallout 76? I guess not. Explain that to me. The only game that I own that crashes on me this bad is Sonic Mania, and I bet that's because of Denuvo.
---
A host wouldn't work in BR because that host could die at any point of the match and disconnect everyone.
---
They really need to do something about stealth boys in PvP.  With silly VATS and crits being able to OHK from distance, it totally encourages camping.  Get seen, dead.  What's the fun in that?
---
Then we agree to disagree.
---
The fact that Nuclear Winter completely removes legendaries and ~~aimbot~~ VATS, makes it far more skill-based, in my opinion.
---
I mean, I've had my fun in Survival too, of course. But pretty much all of my fights end in less than 5 seconds. While in NW, they can last quite a bit, and you have to rely on good positioning, good aim, and flanking/ganking the enemy.
---
No problem, I'm happy my existential suffering from a video game can bring happiness to some
---
Level 2's in their cute vault suit and party hats smacking each other with machete's is something beautiful to behold.
---
I tried it for a couple hours, I was lucky enough to get on a couple teams that won.  I don't think I exactly pulled my weight other than not getting killed.  I think in total I actually got 3 kills the entire time.  I got up to Overseer level 5, and unlocked a new crate container for my CAMP.  I'd kind of like to know what all levels are necessary to unlock what, and am hoping someone builds a list of all the rewards.  Honestly it'll take forever to get to something like level 100 with my PVP skillset, I've always avoided it because the spastic hopping shit annoys the crap out of me.
---
I dunno man lmao all I know is that it’s not the game at least for most people lol
---
Nice to see a useful review! Especially one that doesn't absolutely slate Fallout 76.
---
I remember that being a thing months ago. It's still a thing? That's just sad.
---
Also, what's with the tip after leveling about returning to adventure mode to level up? Didn't see any menu overlap in adventure mode to level up nuclear winter stuff.
---
I'm talking about console. I tested on pc too and its not as bad.
---
I can see how a bloody build can help tho, max damage I’m getting out of it is another 130.. vs your 171
---
IMO, shotguns are best used with a reflex sight and long barrel for mid range. Just shoot from the hip of they are a few feet away from you
---
Yes. The game is free to play for a week for people who want to try it. For those who own it every dlc and update is completely free. I kinda love that... Buying all eso expansions even with eso+ does add up to a large sum of money for a game every year.
---
Battlefield does it best. If you do 80% or more of the damage and a teammate kills them you get assist counts as kill.
---
It went away for a little while awhile. I’ve been playing since launch... and just noticed it again recently at WS.
---
It’s gotta be the most recent patch
---
Close minded people
---
I don't think it's better, it's different. And I love both.
---
Hi, thank you for reporting this! 
---
For the issue where you're falling through the world, do you happen to have any mods installed and does completely uninstalling them help to resolve the issue?
---
For the black screen issue, we will investigate!
---
you in the matrix and just now realizing it... best of luck!
---
coooooool
---
Well, there's gotta be something going on here. I'm not gonna jump down my computer's throat when there's nothing wrong with her. I blame the game.
---
so go back to what you were doing and leave us alone
---
Buddy you very clearly already proved you don't even know what your talking about, said you didn't want to explain. Asking to learn something from you is the same as asking a fish about trees. You toss "big" words thinking your the smartest guy around, but the second anyone asks what you mean you have neck beard superiority complex akin to the same guys "who don't understand why girls don't like nice guys" lol it's because you act the way you do buddy. 
---
So why your coming on so hard with that white hat nice guy routine is very confusing especially when your just as rude as I am, but with the lovely frosting of I'm better than you. Hell your ignorant complex makes you worse lol. 
---
But please go read the dictionary for another 20 mins for ideas before your hands stop shaking to enough to reply, I'll be here for you lol
---
Weapons, armor, item displays. All junk displayable. Maybe I just havnt found it, but howabout some 1x1 grid stairs already!?
---
I think your point about reducing the value of scavenging is probably the most relevant for me. 
---
Once you realise you can't craft legendary items, and you've got a few level 45+ legendaries, crafting has no value. The game becomes entirely about chasing legendaries  for RNG based jumps in character performance. If they let you craft weaker versions of the affixes you want (say, 2/3 as strong as legendaries) it would mean crafting would always be relevant, and there would be an endgame benefit to scrounging materials.
---
a silly child trying to be funny
---
Thats a fair opinion.  Im honestly only playing to get the gear.  Im not the best at battle royale's.  I certainly dont have the time to play it 24/7 as most live streamers do.  But it is a nice change of pace
---
Sounds like they're doing a lot of backtracking in terms of development then. They're trying to bring new things, but the game is still busted. They should be focused on fixing it in my opinion.
---
eherm.... EA/Anthem...
---
So many aquantences gave me shit for liking FO76 (they never played it, just talked trash on it from waht others were saying) and all of them were pumped for Anthem... They gave me shit because when Anthem was ever brought up my response was "We'll see, I don't have a lot of faith in EA to not fudge up with MTX and BioWare to not deliver. It looks good but I'm waiting till release" Only to be met with, "you play FO76 and you think Anthem will be bad?!" 
---
Look whose laughing now... I bet Anthem players really liked their 2 minute plug @E3 this year...
---
I love the low levels, the ones that are hitting level 15-20 already have been buying my junk at a staggering rate.
---
I was going to say, why not both? Boom. During fights like SBQ if you pop off and clear adds every few seconds you can get your damage up crazyyyyyy high. Especially if bloodied. Forget about it.
---
Most likely to happen. I actually really like the way it's set up: ~20min matches on smaller maps compared to other BR games.
---
Check out Outer Worlds
---
It defaults to team on, its easy to forget, chill yourself
---
I’ve been dropping camp stuff to get the challenges met.
---
Survival mode is hot garbage with terrible PVP. WhO cAn HaVe ThE mOsT bRoKeN bUiLd?
---
But it does work as a filter for adventure mode
---
Yeah that's the thing. 2-3 minutes to get to the room you're needing, sit down to the terminal, and then you have maybe a minute, minute and a half to try to cram the lore. I'm not opposed to the idea of rewarding progression with further lore, but not if I can't take my time digesting it.
---
The Favorite Wheel still needs to be able to drag and swap.
---
List of all perk cards too.  Got a lucky break perk card that costs 6 luck to equip...  but haven’t noticed armor breaking all that fast.
---
Well with excavator my carty weight is nearly 500 as is yours. 
---
Point is I think i may just be inefficient or something, like carrying 2 sets of power armor sounds like I'm doing something wrong. And while the excavator armor *is* nice, I'd rather use the combat models for everything rather than be caught with my pants down in weaker armor, or needing to prep for a situation whereas running around with my x01 or t51 I'm good to go from the start
---
New Jersey
---
No it wasn't there when I went back the next two times think it's random
---
I didn’t play the beta
---
My 1\* lvl45 Bloodied Handmade gets a base damage of something like 320.
---
ive got that luck perk where you drop a grenade when downed. havent seen it be useful yet.
---
The missing is because of the bullet spread. VATS eliminates a lot of that but it can't eliminate all of it. I think it's a fair trade, and it helps you designate your 2 shot gun as your close-medium range and then you can have an AA or instigating as your long distance one.
---
or you could just dupe items in another game
---
The fear is shared by many.. but I believe that you are right.  The addition of the new stuff this fall to Adventure / Survival shows that they are dedicated to keeping this thing going.  As mentioned, the NW attracts a whole new crowd.
---
The more people that play the game = more money coming in.  More money coming in = more stuff being added to the game.
---
It'll be alright.  :)
---
Mine was working fine last night, haven’t checked todag
---
Mmm I see
---
Display cases, magazine and bobblehead displays are confirmed for a future update!
---
you most certainly can.  i just lost a last three team match and the team had a full tower setup in the last circle.  its way more than just the quick plans that get picked up.
---
I’ve gotten XP gains, but I haven’t received my medium and epic crates yet and I just got to level 7 overseer.
---
We knew we won't be paying for updates ever... There are other companies that do this and then you have to pay even more for updates and DLC... These fixes and additions are free and they always will be. I knew that going in. 
---
Erhm... Destiny...
---
Then it will  be “RIP Nuke Winter” when Wastelanders comes out.
---
It is essentially a reputation grind. Grinding reputation across an account is terrible.
---
Also your character isn't actually a vault 51 resident as far as I can tell.
---
\&gt; get all geared up 
---
Oh my, that's hard core!
---
The beginner responder quests are there.
---
Yup.  Couldn't hit shit, but no AI behaves like the spastic hopping shitheads in PVP.
---
what bullshit that there's "nothing to do"
---
I play only with shotguns and have no trouble. Use a medium or long barrel with a short stock and the skeet shooter perk and it gets a lot better.
---
Good luck doing that with plans available through vendors. 800h in the game, and I am yet to find plans such as Whitesprings trash or radiation emmiter.
---
I know I can do stuff to manage this situation. I feel rewarded after obtaining a plan I need, but I feel rewarded only once. Next time its just a chore. I'd really be enjoying camp building more if the vast library of plans my main digested would be accessible on my alts.
---
You have to learn the plan for the receiver. Then you can craft the ammo.
---
At least as it is
---
&gt; V.A.T.S.: Now closes immediately when one of your attacks kills the targeted enemy.
---
Hi! This change wasn't intended to affect Gun Fu, and we're currently working on a fix we plan to release with our next update.
---
Thanks for the reports!
---
The 30% stays until VATS is exited. The Gun Fu/Adrenaline/Grim Reaper combo is ridiculous, it's pretty much solely what makes pistol builds viable, and rifle builds godly.
---
Wonder if the rooms below the bridge burn in the fire?
---
I was thinking about that last night after catching a guy camping in there if the fire burned through those rooms or not.
---
It's a lot more balanced than tanks or other vehicles in some BR games, and the fact that everyone starts at the same level so you don't have people running round with lvl 200 chars loaded with decent perk cards makes it easier to get into. I was worried my crappy build would get slaughtered at first.
---
I'm beyond psyched for it. It's taking every ounce of willpower not to pre-order, but I'm gonna play it safe and see what the reviews say.
---
What if someone simply knows more about game design than you and has a larger vocabulary than you?
---
This is very true.
---
Also xbox here.  Didn't work for me either last night.
---
Gun Fu actually has an equal increase each time. Definitely worth all 3 points. If it wasn't broken because of the combat update 😭😭
---
Maybe a wasteland news?
---
Ah thank you, I was like wtf lol
---
This! It will just be quicker to level in adventure mode.
---
Nope.
---
Because you can change your gender, so now my alt is a female named Denzel Washington
---
Put yourself in pacifist mode and your death claw takes no player damage
---
I am hoping they take the no legendary gameplay from MW and drop it in survival personally
---
Exact same here. Also on PC, 100mb connection and high end system.
---
Stability PLUMMETED in 9.5 and time to fully join the weekend went up a lot. It would frequently take upwards of 1-2 minutes before I could see bases, interact with world objects or see any post release content... it's especially hilarious at the purveyor where the legendary scrip machine is absent and the door into the station is boarded up!
---
It seems better as of yesterday, but could be all the people trying out Fallnite.
---
Ahhhh..good ole abuse of the autoaim. I'm in the same boat my friend. I felt so embarrassed of myself the other day. Lol.
---
You got it for free didn't you? Jlif it's that shit then just delete it and move on, because you're hardly missing out are you with such a poorly made game? Lol. Stop acting so hard done by, it's really unnatractive.
---
Its a game of chess then - again like I said, PvP should be twitch based instead of builds based, gear dependent and playing chess.  I know we'll never agree but this is why I simply avoid PvP altogether in 76, but I might give NW a shot given its just not the same "lame to me" mechanics.
---
Totally this. It’s aimbot period. It’s ok to use it to fight AI mobs if aiming is difficult for you, but it shouldn’t be used when PVPing. Just like magic ‘stand still and never die’ armors, it’s a crutch and not a skill.
---
Its all just variable number right?  
---
The guns and armour just have a couple more variables.  
---
The issues results in the tracking of the number of items, each with its own value, from what I can tell.  
---
So you only have so much the computer can handle tracking, we'll call that X.    
---
If you think of X as max number of trackable items, its prorbably huge.  But then you throw in 25 people all randomly adding and subtracting values, and a game that keep generating items inside containers, you have to have a max on the players end, not the game end.     
---
If they allowed for unlimited everything, you either need to stop generating items once you have hit the systems max threshold, or you limit what players can hold, forcing items to despawn or be broken down into the simple values you're describing.  
---
When asking why it isnt near unlimited, I bet if you had nothing but junk, it'd be tough to cap out unless you just went the all steel route.  
---
I'm not a scientist, computer coder/programmer or games designer, this is just my impression from what I've picked up along the way.  Tell me I'm wrong if I am.
---
Nice. I’ll let you know if the RNGods drop me anything bloodied.
---
Why not all 3? Just stop carrying food and use cannibal so you can drop thru hiker 😂
---
If I was talking to a person like that I'd probably ask some questions, but I'm not so what's your point ? Lol
---
Do you have to find a camp first? Are workbenches scattered in the world useable? I wish I had teams that actually used voice, usually ended up split up and everyone left as soon as they died.
---
They've been "unofficial" about if for quite sometime.
---
[https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/44429/](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/)
---
Same here, made me paranoid
---
Also nuclear winter is loads of fun. Thought I’d hate it but it’s great
---
Lol. It's like that big red button that says do not press. YOU GOTTA PRESS IT! lol
---
Actually they've blocked UI mods in Adventure and Survival, too
---
I'm SO happy for you guys.. you deserved a great win..
---
If the made me pay a micro for a radio station I would seriously drop an actual suitcase nuke onto Rockville, Maryland for it.
---
Which one lol
---
Just what I said. Sure there are many quests, but the majority of it is very boring and similar to each other.
---
I have a Lvl 57 and a lvl 98 character now and I did nearly everything and now Im stuck in farming acid to craft ammo, farming legendarys to either use them or sell them and farming blueprints. Do you see the problem?
---
Has placing a CAMP in a new location in NW affected your CAMP in adventure/survival?
---
They should absolutely change survival to follow NWs no legendary footsteps. The gameplay is so much more fun because of it.
---
Bye Felicia
---
I read this in Robert California’s voice. thank you
---
Irrelevant. 
---
In mmo style games someone is going to get the god roll the first time, it's statistically inevitable. 
---
Do you want to use your bloodied golf club to take on the guy with a bloodied supersledge. 
---
If bloodied was exclusive to golf clubs that would give the golf club a place in the game, a niche, As it is it is just a garbage weapon that makes good weapons rarer, and that only serves to increase the power disparity. 
---
I am one of those people who has never been lucky enough to get a god tier set of weapons and armor, I have decent stuff, but I can not take on pvp, because the people who lurk there are the ones with great legendary effects on great guns, An I'm just a dude with great effects on mediocre guns, and mediocre effects on good guns.
---
No matter how god roll your rolling pin is, it will never be able to compete with a better weapon with the same god roll.
---
We're working to address this and are currently looking to release a fix with our next update.
---
Yes Indeed it is, I've seen a lot of discussion in the past as to how much it actually did, and most indicated it was either 6% or 10% per hit up to 40%-50%, I always suspected it to be faster stacking &amp; higher max, and this confirmed it. The best test was on a Vertibot (several Actually, I got 4 keycards last night), They are heavily Armored so damage was only 10 for the 1st shot, but went up in increments of 2 maxing out at 18. Mirelurk Queen started at 20 and went to 36 (Face Shots)
---
Exactly this. Nothing to add.
---
There are some issues with survival, but if you increase TTK, youre going to increase the level/gear-gap. I like being able to take on level 116 as a level 40. 
---
Vats and stealth are my main complaints.
---
stay low
---
keep firing
---
Upvoted
---
Big hugs
---
Then the firestorm will be our overseer.
---
I've been using mods since the better inventory mod came out. I was hesitant to try an ENV but now I will.
---
I was more frustrated tbh that I'd let myself get so poor at aiming after being fairly decent at cod many years ago.
---
i started a new character to play in nw.
---
Tried reviving someone and ended up exiting my PA instead?
---
Why do you find a need to shoehorn your political victim complex into a thread about duping?
---
My biggest gripe. Not being able to ping an enemy to alert my team
---
So what's the limit to be near unlimited?
---
People arent allowed to have opinions now?
---
At the time the game was fun, but the grindig was booring and full of bugs.
---
So... To answer to your rude comment, I can play how I please.
---
I'm not here to complain about a ban that I don't even know the exitence but to know the state of the game.
---
I tried. I sat for like 20 min going through generic lines and still got nothing. Yesterday i assumed okay maybe patch day ill check again later but same thing today
---
Like it, but it runs pretty jittery on console, at least. Server issues maybe? I understand there is limitations for 52 people in a small space though.
---
I was also surprised that it felt like a better game than the other BRs I have played.
---
There is one in the Wastelanders trailer, so possibly in the fall.
---
Agreed.  The first mods I added to Fallout 4 were radio mods and some were better than the in game default.
---
i actually really dont like it.
---
NPCs in open-world games are so repetitive in their voice-lines and limited in their (combat and movement) AI...
---
robots have a story justification for it (being of limited programming), but with humans it really pulls me out of the immersion to see and hear human NPCs behave robotically
---
Don't take pot shots. I can't tell you the amount of times I've had someone in my team give away our position because they start taking potshots at better equipped players.
---
Nope, not at all.
---
Good to know.  So can have 7 Strength cards enabled if you had the points in SPECIAL enough to cover?  Nice.  Good to know.
---
Up for grabs? How so, I do not know about this
---
I might try it.
---
First of all, they should just add it as a treat for their loyal players. No atoms.
---
Second, no dj is ever going to beat Mr. New Vegas, but the characters you mentioned would be fun. Third, add songs from NV: Big Iron, I’m Moving Out, Heartaches by the Numbers, etc. :)
---
It's only the same sort of feeling but not the same sort of game mechanics... this mode is clunky and the servers are unstable sometimes... but it's really exciting. I am in good health but my heart! I thought it was going to beat out of my chest! IT was WILD as hell
---
It really is and the devs should absolutely move to mimick this balance in the other modes.
---
For me ghouls are still crawling around on their backs, but last night I saw scorched running around in whatever pose they were in if they were standing like statues before engagement.
---
One scorched ended up under the map, he was visible enough to kill, but not by much...
---
So it’s just a limited time mode and won’t be coming back?
---
I already have adrenaline maxed out in there, I run 9 in agility, 5 normally goes into adrenaline, 3 for gun fu then I use covert op 1, for me it's not the damage bonus that I used this card for it was the switching between enemies with ease upon there death, plus with the damage counter I did want to see what I could get stacking these together, the team have acknowledged theres an issue and a fix is coming so that satisfies me to know that at some point again soon I'll be able to have fun racking that damage counter up
---
The free trial is meant as a way for us to give Bethesda feedback for Nuclear Winter. We're supposed to make suggestions and report bugs during this time period.
---
Yeah well we can still watch the match finish up even if we ARE Ghosts
---
Wait I won’t battle royale last night, is that what makes me an overseer? What do I get for that?
---
Exactly.
---
No I mean without power armor my carry weight is 450-500lbs. Going into power usually means I have to throw thing on the ground or into my stash. I have a 33 strength and I ave the high capacity backpack.
---
MAGA 2020
---
You come a tie for first I guess.
---
My problem is my memory, by the time I got to the final circle I had a turret, 2x quick walls and a stealth boy, all of which I forgot I had until after I was dead lol
---
That's why I switched over to borderlands for a day or two. I need to get my aim on. Believe it or not I kept trying to do VATS on that game. It's like using a calculator sooner or later you forget how to add. Lmao! Good luck to you my fellow wastelander!
---
Yea, it's almost like they're making it challenging for us end gamers.  What's up with that?
---
The perk cards you unlock  do not carry over  to adventure mode
---
Yeah, I know, I was downloading it for the memes. But I was just sharing my experience with it. Honestly it's quite sad that even after all this time there's still issues. I wasn't really "excited" to play it, to be quite fair. Now I'm just disappointed that my free game isn't working.
---
alright, here's the team, welcome aboard folks
---
Will be doing one tonight... mass and fluids make up about a third of my stash...  
---
flux this shit.
---
Twice I've tried to stim a downed teammate while wearing PA only to have the stim animation lead into the camera angle of exciting your armor then it freezes. 
---
Can't do anything from then on but everything around me is normal. 
---
Frustrating but twice across 10+ hours isn't too bad.
---
I like the legendary effects but i despise the random nature of getting them and vastly prefer the old system of having unique versions of weapons and armor that you can either find in the world, craft, or receive for quest rewards.
---
Also I don't consider this a big issue as I had 30 games and it only happened in those 3 games, I won 5 games throughout the day in other games, I expect nothing from this BR and am blown away at how fun it is
---
Unyielding is OP for everything. Just because it's what makes melee so ridiculous doesn't mean it doesn't do the same for everything that's not based off of endurance. Strength also increases carry weight, not just melee damage, Perception increases the distance you can detect enemies and VATS accuracy, Charisma affects which perks you can share and prices at vendors, Intelligence affects the durability of crafted items, Agility affects the amount of AP and AP regen you have, Luck affects what loot you get and it's durability. Unyielding is something that everyone sleeps on, but I run a full suit of Unyielding/ap refresh/sentinel armor, and I LOVE my commando build. I can one clip scorchbeasts in the sky without leaving VATS, it doesn't break me if I forget to switch in Hard Bargain, everything I find is at atleast 150% durability, letting me use new weapons (on the rare chance I actually find a good one) immediately, and sell them for more. I'm such a big fan of unyielding that I think there should be a high health version as well, just like the Bolstering/Vangaurd dichotomy.
---
Haven't played it I'm afraid. NW is comparable to Battlefield 1 iirc, been a while since I played it though.
---
Most games don't have bugs requiring you to force stop and restart them within the first 10 minutes of playing the game. Why should I waste my time playing a game infamous for bugs that breaks within 10 minutes when I can play games that don't?
---
I mean in NW
---
The biggest changes you’ll note from Adventure mode are that you start with nothing, no weapons or armor. You can still find these in standard containers but you are really keeping an eye out for small blue, long yellow and large red crates. They provide much better gear, while red are rarest I’ve had no issues finding yellow, and blue seem to be literally everywhere.  Creatures also drop loot, with harder creatures dropping better loot, of course any fight with them will draw attention to you. 
---
When you find a gun or armor it’s automatically equipped, and in the case of guns and chems, hotkeyed for you. Armor is now a full set rather than the more modular version you are used to. Like Fallout 3 or New Vegas rather than 4 or standard 76. 
---
VATS is best left at the door, it no longer works on players in this mode and the creatures aren’t really hard to target manually due to their predictable pathfinding.  This may sound like an issue but in my experience the small tweaks they made to the gunplay have made the game feel much more responsive and closer to the fluid way an FPS should feel, it’s not perfect but it’s good enough.
---
Legendaries are not a thing any more, if a player is hitting you hard or with explosives it’s either due to his perks or because he found explosives, no more bloodied two shot explosive atomizing Handmade rifles. 
---
Your carry weight is drastically reduced, 75 
---
pounds base I believe (sorry I’m not in a match so I can’t check) . This is due to the fact that SPECIAL has no passive bonus anymore, it only dictates how many perk points per stat you can use. 
---
Perk Cards are limited to a hand of seven (7) You can only have seven at a time.  However you can have as many in one special stat as your SPECIAL rank allows, so if you want all 7 in Strength and can afford it nothing is stopping you. Due to the hand selected nature of the cards and cards custom made for this mode, your progress toward them is separate from your standard progress. You’ll start out with seven freebies but unlock more as you play. 
---
The only things that cross between this mode and Adventure/Survival are standard XP earned, Caps Earned, your appearance and SPECIAL stats. You can’t bring that sweet shotgun with you when you leave, and most certainly can’t bring a few stimpacs when you come.
---
Use google dude this is easy
---
Tops blooby!
---
We can agree if we both go out of pur ways to try see the others perspective.
---
If you'd say "my expectations towards shooters are such that aiming must be the most important factor hence F76 survival doesn't satisfy me at all", and there is nothing I could disagree with in such sentence. Its simply truth.
---
But if you say chess players lack skill then, well, this can be proven false easily.
---
What do you think about such approach?
---
Look where you click to submit a new post, scroll down an inch or two. Just under the 76 icon.
---
It'll be back when the officially drop the Nuclear Winter dlc!
---
So we both agree that's how it is in MMOs and that's how it's been for the last two decades and you want to see things change in fallout 76 exclusively?
---
Holy crap, furious is actually really good and better than junkie's on fast weapons. Good find!
---
If I'm the problem, what did I do wrong? Open the pipboy?
---
I've been similar, I've never had mods and I've also suffered faults from crossing textures, sometimes staying as in the swim area until you reach another area of separate load in which to "get out of the water" although in that area you could jump through the stones Other times falling into the infinite void ... sometimes appearing then on the surface and sometimes, dead.  
---
It is as if some elements of the stage or parts of it in some cases lost their attribute of "solidity".
---
Oooh ok do you know when that will officially drop?
---
You last 47 seconds?  Lucky.
---
I would just like to inform you that "Imo" stands for "in my opinion".
---
 Seems you don't quite understand what it means since you believe that I believe my opinion meant the only opinion. 
---
 I would have led off with "Top" which would stand for "The only opinion" if I felt my opinion was the only opinion.
---
Get it now?
---
No zoom bro, you use it up close, hip fire a lot, spray and pray. It’s hugely fun.
---
Jokes on you, he actually had a serious thing for leather. You just narrowly avoided Butcher Pete by logging out when you did.
---
I would go unyielding and spec heavily into (and use) VATS. Gun Fu. Adrenaline. Grim Reaper Sprint. It's just amazing.
---
I dont use VATS much, so I cant comment. But stealth camo should be toned down. Id rather deal with ambushes than invincible high levels.
---
Yes I've been stuck the same way, tried restarting the launcher, nothing.
---
Agreed, Stability can kill anything even it it's the best game ever!
---
I'm glad Bethesda got the cheers of the people today, but please don't let this get damaged by pushing too early. Make sure your QA people are playing on accounts that are had by pre-order people. Take my account and rename it and use it on your QA system. Or copy it and rename, so you can play in prod. You will see all of the bugs and issues that SO many pre-order people have. Can't get Atom credit for discovered places as it thinks they are undiscovered.. to name one.
---
Uhhh okay.  Well I am talking about unlocking trophies/achievements on the ps4 version of the game. 
---
A free trial is on for the week and you are supposed to get an achievement/trophy called "reclamation day" when you leave the vault and start the game.
---
I never had the trophy pop or unlock while playing trial. So when I buy the full game am I going to have all my trophies pop that I would have got if I was playing the full game?
---
All of this is irrelevant for me now as I bought the full game and restarting my character.
---
I live in Europe so destroy your own country all you want
---
That’s double bagged!
---
?
---
Seeing as there is player collision, it would be a pushing fight to be in the dead center of the last circle and take damage last after everyone else does, even with Stims on last circle you die in seconds so that wouldn't matter either
---
go to the ATOM store and check out the icons, you will find that the crates are just icons, it confused me too at first
---
Yeah i absolutely despise how they blocked off parts of the vault until you level up. I want to learn more, but i have to get to level 56 to listen to a holotape? Come on, this isn't the story creating i knew and loved. I get the cosmetics, makes sense completely. But blocking story content to everyone? IDK, kinda fucked up.
---
So far we only have Summer 2019 per the roadmap.
---
Good to know... thanks
---
I've always hated Fortnite, I generally avoid PvP in 76 due to griefing, and I had the same first impression when I loaded the game last night to do some daily quests. Still, I found myself trying out Nuclear Winter last night out of curiosity, and was highly surprised by how fun and addicting it was. I'd highly recommend suspending your skepticism and trying it out just for kicks. You get benefits from it in adventure mode too.  
---
If anything, 76 lends itself to a much better battle royale type of experience than any other game like Fortnite, because it's already based on gritty survivalism (which is the tone of BR in the first place).
---
‘Still isn’t worth playing’ it’s working fine for the rest of us, ergo the issue must be on you’re end.
---
This post made me smile. Have a great day and see your group on the wasteland!
---
Oh ok so hopefully not too far. Thanks mate
---
probably your own instance for every player? everyone has their own vault 51? no idea.
---
Like mine too - no matter how hard I watch I always get it from behind.
---
I suspect this is the case, which means the Incisor Perk is not really needed.
---
I have put over 700 hours into the game. I have a main character that I did all the quests spent hours exploring various camp builds etc etc and then I have a pvp character that I rebuilt just for pvp and traded all my good rifles and sentinel gear too just so it would
---
Be a more viable build for pvp because let’s face it heavy weapons suck in pvp too slow not enough accuracy any vats with rifles is deadly matched with high perception. If we had more points to put into special stats it might be better but as of late sneak commando/rifleman builds are the best.  Yesterday when I finally got logged in and was able to meet up with my usual team and try it out. I played it for hours. I found it exciting it was a cool new mode to figure out. I liked having perk cards that you can change yr load out on. Power armor seems viable again especially if you can find a mini gun or 50 cal. Picking locks and hacking terminals is useful again. Picking the terrain is detrimental now. Don’t get caught on the low ground at one point the last circle Ended on a guard station and every one was below me  making it easy to see enemies. 
---
Obviously this is pre beta and because we’re playing with a lot of people who are just trying out the game being matched with people or being vs people who aren’t used to the mechanics you are going to have the advantage over them. Out of about 10-15 games. My team won twice only once did I make it till the end and I only saw 1 nuke launched. 
---
I tried to make use of building camps buuut here’s my opinion on camp tactics. There needs to be more taken out of the build menu I’m not sure why you can build fusion generators and water purifiers or a bed or really any of the decor. Pretty much walls and foundations are the really only valuable building options you need. And it’s a little slow. Having to open yr pip boy then go into build mode then find the object yr trying to build then trying to find placement for it takes way to long imo. I basically got to the point where I’m the final circle if I didn’t have enemies in sight I’d coordinate with the team have them cover me drop the camp and then go to recent and basically build a circle of the y’all defense walls and stairs around and then just keep building more cover from our strong point to try and have as much cover as possible. Also. Can we PLEASE have the turrets facing outward instead of towards you by default. You can’t pick the turrets back up to rotate them and if you drop them hastily they won’t pick up enemies in sight. 
---
I saw some one mention the scorch beasts. They aren’t op they actually die quickly. I killed one with 3 hits from a lever action and you can use vats on NPCs. They drop the high tier loot. 
---
For loot I found it soooo nice you get a full suit of armor  love that there is ammo with the weapons when u find them.  Picking locks is great you actually find items that are useful and not just full of prewar money hahaha.  I found that radium rifles are superior and handmades obviously. Ammo is precious tho so don’t go sprayin all over the place and also try to stay sneaking when not running from the fire. I for the most part just avoided AI npcs there’s no point in giving up your location. 
---
I can’t wait to level up more.  I did use my characters already made to try and see if there is a difference but you really need to level up your overseer rank before perks become useful with yr characters loadout. My last level up I unlocked rifleman and it gives you 40% more damage!!! But it’s a 3 point card so if yr special stats don’t have that many stat points in there it’s unusable. I’m hoping to level up my strength character as well because of I can get iron fists unlocked I’m going for the highly chosen spawn points and gonna be knockin people out.  
---
Things as far as general BR game mode that might use some help. The main menu and being able to pick your team and maybe a little instruction as how to do so. It’s not very obvious. You have to select the fill option and then go to your social menus and invite people to the team and they have to be in the main menu to do so you can’t invite them if they are in adventure or survival 
---
Overall I loved it. It made me excited and made me start to ask my self how the hell im gonna balance making my sales in adventure mode and doing in game challenges along with leveling up my overseer rank. I haven’t been up to vault 51 in adventure mode since BR went live but it would be cool if you could enter the mode by entering the vault with your team.
---
These are all great points! I definitely agree with the wait time in the lobby. If there was more stuff to do, maybe some holotapes or hologames or something of the sort to keep us busy besides beating the crap out of each other, then it wouldn't be so bad. And what are these loot boxes / rewards you're talking about? Maybe I got these and I didn't even know it?
---
I hope a lesson they take from NW for Survival is to disable the effects of legendary items. I think we should still get them, they just don’t actually do anything. That way you can still go to adventure mode and have them.
---
This way you’ll have a fighting chance.
---
It’s crazy to me that I’ve got a guy with max endurance, full max level power armor, and perks to help and I still get blasted in one hit from basically anything.
---
You know I just saw that in another post lol. Thanks though.
---
How do you get it?
---
legendary weapons, not being able to fully level up everything, being forced to sacrifice 1/3rd of your build on weight management (in a salvage game), all changes for the worse

Have you played blackout? It is really similar to it.
---
4 min wait times for games. Aiming feels bad, not to mention how bad the character animation is. Like running when standing still etc. Would rather play z1.
---
For a battle royale this mode is damn fun and im suprisingly good at it too
---
Sadly no requeue option but it is kind of beta atm so wh9 knows. There isn't really a best spawn other than where the rest of your team are.
---
Hi all, we're going to look into this. I've sent PMs to a few of you who reported greatly increased explosive weapon damage asking for a few more details.  
---
Thanks for the reports, all!
---
Atom bundle
---
Anytime!
---
This can’t be said enough.
---
You're a real good violin player, so you always have that.
---
We can certainly agree on that - but there's still far too much gear dependence as well in your chess game.  A real chess game is just that, both sides play with the same pieces.  In 76 its a whole lot less balanced than a simple chess game.
---
You can blame the game, that doesn’t fix the problem though
---
but I don't see the option to redeem code on the Bethesda Launcher
---
Thanks for the help ✌
---
Some people have figured out how to hide under the map? Me and my buddy discussed this last night. It would be pretty easy to hide throughout the whole session to at least get to the top 10. But we both agreed what's the point in hiding just to get a better ranking. I rather go there and fight and if I die I die if not it's okay I had fun. Of course not everyone thinks this way there there's a lot of scumbags out there they'll do anything to win.
---
I dont believe in VATS, fps elite
---
&gt;hilarious at the purveyor where the legendary scrip machine is absent and the door into the station is boarded up!
---
Yup, see from time to time too.. I have enough time to run around the building 2-3 times.. (maybe I was on wrong side???, nope)
---
I made a joke to illustrate the idea that just surviving, and the best way to do that is just stay hidden, isn't fun. No whining. I just stand by the idea that people who play the game for lore aren't always the people who play for PvP; and locking lore on a Vault, something a lot of Fallout players look forwards to discovering, behind a ludicrous amount of PvP (literally hundreds of hours is the current rate of xp is maintained, if you play hours every single night) is just a bad idea no matter how firmly your cross your arms and tut at me. Right now people are in the honeymoon phase of a new mode. That's going to wear off. And then people are going to notice how much time they just spent in NW and how little their xp bar went up. At that point the people who like PvP will stay because they like PvP. The people who are playing for lore and the setting are just going to have to read the Wikia, instead of the lore being accessable at the start or even after a *reasonable* goal.
---
Seriously, if you can look at the xp you get for surviving maybe ten minutes and killing a player or two, add up how many matches that is roughly per level, then remember there are level 100+ tapes and rooms, and tell me that is reasonably achievable by someone with only a passing/casual interest in PvP in anthing resembling a *reasonable timeframe* then I'll concede I'm just a hater. How many matches at three-to-six matches per level does Overseer 100+ come out at to you?
---
It's fun but it's definitely not better than PUBG
---
After leveling up a few times, you get the "loot boxes" from NW game world as stash boxes in your camp. Most people think they are actual loot boxes like most F2P games have.
---
Arcade games is a great suggestion!
---
This happened to me and I had to jump off the tower to my doom
---
I’m the wrong person to tell you you’re wrong or right haha. So going with this, why is Stash then limited on a “weight” value and not an “item count” value?
---
I have a gun that weighs 20lbs in my stash and a gun that weighs 1.8lbs. From a coding perspective they both take up the same amount of coding space, but the one gun takes up nearly 10x the Stash space.
---
Similarly for scrap there’s a unequal distribution of space/weight with regard to strain on the coding/server.
---
There’s a settlement that needs your help, here I’ll mark it on your map.
---
Yea, I have my FE Handmade modded to Full Auto with a Drum mag, but I will be switching it to the perforating mag tonight for further testing.
---
Not real time shooters? Huh? What’s your criteria for a real time shooter? VATS exists, but you certainly don’t have to use it.
---
It gets to be a little much fighting several remaining teams and a random scorchbeast that can essentially instagib a team with unlucky hits. The way the thing fixates it actually takes away challenge for the opposing team that just waits it out.
---
I live in Europe too and we can talk can we. Look at the state of Germany and France? Haha
---
It's in the patch notes: it says that multi-star wood armor would not revert to one-star armor any longer upon reloading the game. The notes didn't say anything about it being added to the loot table, though.
---
It's free this week. Try it for yourself and make a decision.
---
I'd like to see both ideally.
---
I think he means the sponsors and coaches who could send in packages and influence the game.
---
Every new player starts with the lifegiver perk card equipped which gives +45 health, so most people should have 145 health.
---
cant i share an opinion of your opinion?
---
The problem is the game though. I mean, everyone's experience is there own but it's no coincidence that this game, our of all the games I play, isn't working quite right. Maybe I'll make sure I have the latest drivers but it really does seem like there's something wrong with the game itself.
---
If it was my computer's problem, that's fine. I can accept defeat if it's my computer's problem. But problematic game having problematic issues? I'm not surprised.
---
Not trying to be precise and just going for a ballpark figure, and assuming levels don't require ***more*** xp as you go, you are looking at anywhere between 400 to 500 matches before you can step foot in the Overseer's office or know the full story. At at average of 10-15 minutes a match, not even counting wait times to start from the lobby, thats... mre that a *bit longer*.
---
Yes just bought it and noticed 
---
Bummer
---
I just respecced to automatic rifleman after the patch, using my auto tesla definitely breaks enemies.  I was using a qe railway on auto as well and that seemed ok, but the tesla is most likely the trigger.  What I also found odd, is once the bug starts happening, you can pop a mob a couple times in vats, and it kicks you out as if you killed them, but then they refill the HP... so vats is detecting it as a kill when they hit 0hp, but then they're back up to 100%.  Any bug that REQUIRES you to leave a server and rejoin is unacceptable...
---
this is why i want to rework the legendary enemies to instead just drop scrip of varying amounts that can be used when combined with certain other rare mats to craft legendary mods for any weapon with the cost going up based on how many are installed on the weapon already and how high the effects are on the tier list. 
---
then add in new unique weapons that are guaranteed spawns in certain hard to find locations and as rewards for quests. 
---
they already do half of that last part like the .44 you get after morgantown airport so just adding more of those kinds of things into the loot table for quests should not be very hard.
---
I honestly agree that it is a bit excessive and needs looked at. But all in all I think this is more a test run of it. We should give our feedback on it. Ive killed many people up close with it so far. Entire teams even!
---
Well you’re kinda right. As far as tracking data with scrap, the instance of scrap is always the instance in your stash whether it’s 1 or a million. But, in terms of data in the code, a one figure integer is still less overhead than a seven figure integer and when you’re talking about millions of players that adds up quickly. Think about most of your scrap. It weighs around .05 but damn do you get to 800 quick. When coding any application you try to save where you can.
---
Yeah sure you are bro, you're definitely not an american republican at all

---
So THATS what happened to that poor guy.
---
Came here to say this. I'm a filthy casual and Nuclear Winter is just hella fun. It makes other BR games look like the Looney Tunes. Great rewards, it's fun to open unique perk cards, like rediscovering the character system, the limit of 7 cards forces you to make cool decisions about what you want to be able to do in a single BR game.  
---
I'm going to get some of my buds involved so we can actually try to have a group tank, healer, and etc. (you can 100% do that by coordinating perk card picks, some of which are very powerful if you're working together). I've been surprised by some of the camaraderie I've felt during each game too, since you're matched up with 3 other team mates to try to survive with. It legit feels like the Walking Dead - end of the world, limited resources, time bomb is ticking, and for better or worse these are the geeks your life is going to depend on.
---
Crafting weaker versions from scavenged materials would still make people who enjoy the true core of Fallout games second class players.
---
Being able to build the exact gear you want should be a thing, the resources required should simply be rare, and the way you get them should include the ability to just explore and scavenge.
---
For example, they could set it up so that every time you pick up any resource there is a tiny chance to get a high quality pristine version of that resource, used for crafting item mods that confer legendary traits. Then in order to facilitate actual exploraiton and not just grinding the game would randomly assign every character a certain location on the map where your chance to get a pristine item is something like 50% until you've gathered 10 of them. You don't know what the location is, and it doesn't change until you've been there and depleted those items, so you just have to travel all over the place and keep looking. 
---
Systems like that that encourage people to be on a perpetual road trip across the wasteland should be all over the game. The most profitable way to do anything should be to play on the whole map and go to locations where you haven't been in a while. Leaving no stone unturned should be rewarded by the game, rather than just farming the same locations over and over.
---
Exactly. They can be revived so that’s why there are separate kill and down counters. But why does that means people who put no effort in should be rewarded?
---
I've done 2 nukes since the start yesterday,  but it ends up being when there's 1 team left and the nuke can hit the entire circle, so we end up shuffling to 1  corner and nuking the rest, it's been 100% kill potential so far, but it would be nice to see earlier during bigger circles. As for melee, I highly disagree with this. Melee is fantastic in buildings when you wait for them to come to you and suprise them, the only real issue I find is combat shotties, everyone else as long as your dodging like crazy have such a hard time aiming and everything else with such narrow hallways and the cameras angle going around them. They have a place in the game, it's just not in the spotlight
---
I thought so but in another thread someone said they found a static spawn. Idk!!!
---
They are, and people are allowed to disagree with that opinion also.
---
Theres a western revolver skin at level 11
---
In my experience with different BRs, usually armor is common in order to extend the playtime of each player
---
Started playing last night and in the first Responder's town you get to, some level 85 dude gave me a few freebies of ammo and meds. Then I stumbled upon a big ass player made base and was playing with the vending machines when lo and behold, it was that same dude's camp! He let me in and gave me a bunch of real good quality level 5 armor and a few good weapons, along with some more ammo and stuff. The gesture wheel came in handy and wow, player interaction in this game is way more fun and comfortable. I'll probably be buying this near the week's end.   
---
Thank god I waited this long lol.
---
You wouldn't be able to tell that you're talking to someone like that with your attitude.
---
Still, have to turn off 2 monitors to play FO76.. When are we going to get this? most every game released in the last 5 years support a 5760x1200 res. Nvida surround makes this look like one monitor.
---
They really should bring back Vault 76 now that we're going to have human NPCs, it would make a great hub.
---
Yeah I understand that. I’m saying that when the downed enemy is killed, the person who downed them should receive the kill. The down counter is a different thing.
---
No I do not. I was actually unaware the quick use would use a healing salve instead of a Stimpak. That’s good to know. 
---
But yeah I just have regular stimpaks and they seem to administer like I’m in power armor right now. Not that I’m complaining! Just hoping it stays that way lol.
---
The problems with the game were fixed a while ago there are still a few but crashing isn’t one of them at least for everyone I know but you could be right it could be your game you never know
---
Fo3 and FNV had legendary weapons they just weren't as intense as they are now
---
Why not try it whilst it's free?
---
i just solo queue in NW.  better than getting a team that doesn't use voice.  as far as the camp, i think it just has its own hotkey.  i've not played with it yet.
---
It really is quite fun...more people (myself included) need to use headsets...communication is critical - the best match I partook in so far had a few guys running point and communicating
---
You mean your pipboy? It's the thing wrapped around your character's left arm which acts as your inventory.
---
Have you tried again after restarting the game?
---
You can choose between solo and team.
---
I agree with you about being able to stay with the team, though. They will surely add it at some point.
---
You honestly believe that anyone but a hardcore PvPer is going to play up towards or even over ***500 matches***?
---
Yeah, it can be hard to remember those items.
---
It's also kind of hard to figure out when they're best used.  I feel like they should be used to gain tactical advantages, but honestly going into build mode in a firefight is...*risky*...to say the least.
---
I need that
---
Thanks for the reports, we'll investigate!
---
20 whole minutes for that banger huh ? You sure showed me lol, think after all that time you could throw a sentence that makes sense together
---
Lap up your state funded propaganda 'bro'. There won't be any ethnic Germans left in fifty years. Boo hop!
---
On one of the terminals it mentions "X-02 Power Armour" being delivered to vault 51
---
Can you drop caps? I would do this but can't seem to figure out how to select caps to give.
---
Yes, less hyperbole would make me happy.
---
Meh, but they might end up being interesting. At least they are going with the masses without changing the game negatively for others.
---
it saves under "Stored" or "blueprints" in the camp menu
---
Its an RPG-themed shootet, gear and build indeed is crucial, but learning the environmental conditions, researching the actual results of different combinations, and designing constructions that utilise this knowledge is something that scratches a certain itch for me - an itch that remained unscratched for all those years I stopped playing FOnline.
---
I hope they will implement 'Hardcore survival' mode, with a separate character slot that cannot be used outside of hardcore mode, with no legendary effects and with full loot drop. I'd be happy to play a game where your combat preparedness means that you have five crafted weapons of your choice and five armor sets stashed, so that if you died, you'd still have a way to rearm yourself. The only legendaries I could accept in such setting are the 'named' ones, quest rewards etc, they should feel, you know, fucking legendary, and they too should be dropped upon death. Would you play it? If yes, please, lets unite our voices and talk about this expectations with other people. Maybe we'll get that.
---
I don’t understand what’s wrong?
---
I think Bethesda is pretty solid on treating it like a minigame, where it belongs.
---
If u want to keep your camp, u have to blueprint it first in order to keep it as is when you move. Otherwise, it'll fragment into pieces that you have to set up again.
---
My very first 3 star was an instigating rapid fire protected reload lvl 45 gausse rifle. I play a sniper build. I was quite happy.
---
You can blueprint it. Some people prefer to set down one foundation square then attach a ladder and then from the top of that later place flooring and build their base from their. It makes it easier to blueprint and place in other locations. Blueprnting wasn't much easier in FO4 though.
---
This was why I bought the tac ops suit last night, only to find its not equippable in NW, expensive mistake at 700 atoms :(
---
Is that in the chill atom bundle?
---
Yeah we were talking about how so many people don't have mics which makes it difficult to run as a squad in the nuclear winter.
---
There’s no reason for them to feel any shame at all.
---
I'm not bad. But the audio makes it very difficult to hear where players are coming from, something I rely on in other BRs. 
---
Many a times I'm getting shot in my ass
---
VATS simply has to be removed completely from PvP in all game modes.
---
&gt;Also, what's with the tip after leveling about returning to adventure mode to level up? Didn't see any menu overlap in adventure mode to level up nuclear winter stuff.
---
You earn adventure mode xp for whichever character you're using in NW. The pop up is to alert you that you leveled up in adventure, and has nothing to do with NW.
---
Thanks for the reports! We're currently planning to release a fix for this with our next update.
---
It's cool they give us free dlc, that's why I have no problem buying a few atoms here n there to support the game
---
It's not poison. It's a buff. And a good one too.
---
Well it wouldn’t be the worst overseer we know of. Probably not even in the top 5.
---
Considering I hate PvP, yeah I do ! The adventure mode exp, caps and unique rewards you get at the end of the match are better than any method of cash/exp farming in PvE mode :)
---
Are you on PC? Do you use mods or have a Fallout76Custom.ini? If so, you must update it every time the game gets an update.
---
You have to redeem it from the Bethesda.net website.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/34274/~/how-do-i-redeem-a-code-for-the-bethesda.net-launcher?
---
Click the hamburger (three horizontal lines) at the top left after you sign in, and you'll see Redeem Code.  After you redeem, you might have to restart the Bethesda Launcher for FO76 to show up.
---
Again. Because you didn’t KILL them.
---
&gt; Right after the update, I did run into a lot more legendary enemies in Whitespring than usual. This was before a nuke got dropped as well. I think I got about 8-10 while clearing the entire resort.
---
Actually, that's within the normal range. Whitespring can have either almost no legendaries, just a handful, or up to 20 or 25 legendary enemies (most of them disguised as Diseased). You will hardly ever encounter more than one 3* enemy, however, except when it's freshly nuked.
---
I think the weight limits the complexities of those items.  So you have durability and loaded ammo etc.  More of these items add to the "value tracking" load the system can handle.  So make em heavy, limit the number of complicated items.
---
The only reason I think it must work on an asset tracking level, is that when duping was at its worst, the servers were incredibly unstable.  I would bet this came from people massively overloaded with guns, which is already a complicated item for them to track.
---
Again, all armchair suppositions over here.
---
This might also allow for Atomic Shop items to stay purely cosmetic (except for repair kits because they've already added)
---
One of my bros dropped one killed 7. Was epic
---
Same issue here.
---
It’s posts like this one that are why I am subscribed to this sub. I love hearing humorous adventures in the wastes. Thank you
---
Atom Bundle it costs 10 bucks. You get 1500 ATOMS and the Battlecoat.
---
That's why I say mics are not optional, communication is key to winning.
---
"Who needs all this .45 or .308 I'm carrying. "
---
"Two people entered building to the north"
---
"Oh shit, scorchbeast attacking the last team. Rush them"
---
I hope they add more sections of the map.
---
It appears like they are trying to provide an incentive for every kind of player to continue playing NW. For lore junkies, the story unlocks for you as you play more of the game. For camp decorators, there is the promise of new statues and such. For the most ruthless fighters, there is a large number of victories you can have under your belt to show off, such as in other BRs. 
---
Not a bad idea, I just wish there was more to the actual ingame location.
---
I think you missed the point
---
Why does it make it easier? I'm confused. I don't remember blueprinting being a thing at all in FO4 because there were fixed building spots.
---
About how long does a session last? I have limited time in the evening, so I may have to wait until the weekend.
---
Making blueprint is tedious, but if you save them in small portions instead of one large one, it will work out better. A massive blueprint usually has issues with the terrain when moving to a new location.
---
YES!
---
I didn’t know the circle got that small. Makes sense, there needs to be some forced conclusion to it.
---
I have, and it’s pretty funny, I love they include stuff like this.
---
So I have to manually tag each item to blueprint it? That's... tedious?
---
Yes, you're supposed to follow it
---
Drama queen alert
---
Someone will figure it out soon enough
---
nah, when you go to buy atoms there’s a special bundle, that gives you the outfit and extra 500 atoms.
---
I'm assuming that's what they're doing, all 3 games it happened it was me and 1 buddy alive, in the circle, combing every single inch of the last circle, until it completely closes, and we just lose, it's heartbreaking when it's your first win on the horizon too lol, we still count it though lol
---
Too many times trying to get the vendor bot to spawn out front of charleston station.
---
 Not Just on PC either, this happens to me all the time on PS4. I close the game fully and restart it and it always solves it
---
This is the sneak peak. I imagine exploration functionality will be available when the vault actually ships. I just don't like the overseer level locked terminals.
---
they're forcing you to play a completely different style game to get more for a story that should already be in the game. Its gross
---
So save parts into blueprints, e.g. sleeping quarters, and then place them down individually as/when needed?
---
I needed it aswell. Full BoS dude herr
---
They're pretty good at the beginning of the match but bringing a knife to a gun fight is never a good idea... unless you have a big knife.
---
No I’m ps4 but I fixed it
---
Looks like I have to buy some atoms today.
---
I've also mutated very often in NW. Though, it's usually crap like talons..
---
Nah, couldn’t get my sensitivity to work with it
---
OG fans who care about the game
---
Now I can compliment my Elder T60 with that Battlecoat.
---
Loo. They didnt have legendary weapons. They had uniques
---
Great, thanks.  I’ve been out of F76 for a while.  Can you still run/move while doing it that way?  Will try later.
---
Console as well. It happened to me last night, but there is a chance the player left mid revive.
---
If I move I just store and rebuild.
---
I'd play hardcore survival - but hardcore to me means NO VATS as well.  You can still experiment and use different combos without VATS.  A shooter simply should not have a built-in aimbot, RPG or otherwise.  If you want to call it a guns based modern RPG then fine, but it will never be a proper shooter with VATS.
---
Yes. Something as simple as a “DND” icon would be great
---
I can't imagine that they wouldn't be working on maps for the various regions that are in game.
---
Ohh. Lucky.
---
"No matter how subtle the wizard, a knife between his shoulder blades will seriously cramp his style."
---
Most of this sounds like a you problem. I haven't DC'ed in awhile. I find people to group with ingame often. Exploration and feeling lonely is very fallout. In conclusion, quit bitchin'.
---
My Unstoppable Monster got up to 2,232 last night, I thought that was insane!
---
I think thats where it shines as a BR. Its a minigame, not an hour long delve around a massive map. I still dont like it bc I dont like BRs, but its treated right.
---
I dont think it takes anything away from the main game's development, as long as bethesda continues to treat it like a minigame.
---
That’s an awesome idea.
---
It'll never last - don't worry they will all be back to their toxic whinging soon once something doesn't work 100% again.....
---
We are in the honeymoon period, and (before you downvote me to oblivion remember I'm posting here too, playing, and generally having fun, I'm just also being honest with my thoughts and feelings) this community is largely composed of players who feel attacked for liking the game in the first place, so while I wouldn't look to haters for an unbiased view I wouldn't look her either. For a start off after playing all evening I've noted the xp rewards, how much the bar moves per match, and it looks like you'll need 300-600 matches under your belt to access the later lore tapes and audio. That's ludicrous. No one but the hardcore PvPers are likely to ever hear them ingame, and most are PvPers. As a lore junkie that seems to be an odd choice I would criticize as there is no real reason to gate the lore at all. I'm also concerned that in time people will learn the map so well, be high enough to equip all the best perks, memorize all the most likely PA and box spawns, and steamroll newbies.
---
Just a few of my concerns. Any one could change at release.
---
The three W’s. Whitesprings, Westek, Watoga.
---
Thanks for the heads up im close to finishing that quest and i really want that clean flag
---
You need to get the Bethesda.net launcher from the same website. Once you sign-in or create an account, you should be able to see a message telling you that F76 is free to play for this week with a button that leads you to the game's page. You should be able to download it from there. You do not need the Bethesda.net launcher to actually play the game when it's already installed, but you will need it to update it.
---
Hoping you end up having fun playing it!
---
yup.

If they ever did I wouldn’t want too much of an increase. I think once the npcs are added it will feel more alive.

Disable it modifying the ini file

what does gun fu do in this mode?
---
Dame you Bethesda, is this borderline predatory.
---
Freaking amazing!
---
i killed 3 people with a pencil
---
I would love to have a map around the water park or watoga
---
no once you select blueprint in the menu if you select one part of a structure it will select the entire thing and you can save it all at once. 
---
for example my compound consists of my workshop and my house surrounded by turrets and i have all of them blueprinted individually.
---
No it was planned. Right on the road map. 
---
Vault dwellers from Vault 76 enter into a world that got hit with a crisis of the Scorch. All humans are dead or corrupted. 
---
Dwellers then tamed West Virginia, building camps, killing Scorch, killed the Scorchbeast Queen. 
---
Now that the first crisis is settled and lot less Scorch, people are moving to West Virginia, the Settlers and the Raiders. Fighting over rumored treasure.  Now the savors of West Virginia make a choice, side with the Settlers or side with the Raiders. 
---
This is how story development works. It’s how BGS decided to do their take. 
---
After the war with the Settlers and Raiders then it’s something else. 
---
It’s an MO, so it evolves.
---
I’m just curious what makes this so life changing for battle royales to warrant the amount of hyperbole and over the top statements being made here. People need to be able to back up these ridiculous ideas.
---
“I hate all gambling, but man oh man, I love playing Blackjack at the casino!”
---
Nonsense.
---
Well its not meant to be a Fallout game, its a sideshow, and its treated like one.
---
Our assumptions are based on logic and standard game development practices, and yours are based on salt and butthurt.
---
I'm having the same issue been at 14.56gb/14.56gb for hours now. the progress bar looks to be at 99+%. I tried restarting my PC and their launcher multiple times with no luck.
---
Listen to the people, again!
---
Yep, should save time. Again, doesn’t always work with terrain properly, though, so try to make sure the new location has a similar terrain style to the previous one.
---
I am a dev, and one thing you learn is that most every bit of code has 100 historical decisions and implementation restrictions on it, often from seemingly-unrelated code. Without seeing the code base and understanding some of those decisions you can’t make too many assumptions, but there are some relatively safe guesses that can be made. 
---
The limits on stash space are to keep down the number of items in the world, they’ve said that.   Every item in the game world - player inventories, containers, lying on the ground, etc - has to be tracked, and there are a lot of properties on each. Every object has weight, condition, quantity, stat effects, probably info about its position, etc, and who knows how many hidden properties we don’t see. Even the ones that don’t show all of those properties when you view them probably have most or all of them “under the hood”. That’s a lot to track, it’s not just “a number” as I saw someone else mention here.
---
I imagine that at some level their code doesn’t differentiate between a gun and a stack of lead - they’re both just objects with quantity and a bunch of other properties. Some people will have stashes with 400 separate items to track and some will only have 50 with really large quantities, and it all averages out in the wash as far as keeping world item count down.
---
Could they implement a system that switched scrap items into some other tracking source and allow the quantities to go really high? Probably. Is it high on their list of priorities with bug fixes, DLCs, etc? Probably not.
---
nice...how were you notified that you got something?
---
As a melee build I’m at a big disadvantage coming to NW. I have no points in perception, so I can’t add any damage perks to rifles. It’s given me 3* master rifle man twice and I can’t use them lol.
---
What? The rewards with br are the skins and shit earned from battle passes. Overwatch it’s rank and gold paint?
---
Part of my build too, hope this post gets high enough to get attention but with all BR posts Im not optimistic.
---
What do I have to be salty and butt hurt about?
---
Yeah, it'd be nice to have adventure mode benefit from the same love. The thing people are commenting on most about BR? That the lack of legendaries makes the game fun again. 
---
Remove legendary affixes from adventure mode. Return the fun to the game.
---
It’s not for everybody. I got used to the lack of nps,  I don’t even remember the point of the maim quest. I maybe get kicked off the serve every couple days. It has its bad points, but I generally enjoy it.   You either like it or you don’t.
---
Sometimes, you just can't help it.
---
  But then all the weight x number of items values have to be passed to the weight reduction tables, compared, filtered or modified by same, then passed back to the inventory screen table. 
---
And one or both of the guns may (or may not) be affected by 1 or more different weight perks and at least 2 different levels of said perk(s).
---
No they did it was just small legendary affects to each unique item it was just commonly stuff like, improved critical chance, or more critical damage. They're basically just the low tier legendaries that we have now.
---
I love being forced into pvp, never interested me that much in adventure mode but knowing everyones on a level playing field is really nice. Plus i really enjoy the combat, really suits my play style of actually using tactics instead of the fast gun play like apex.
---
I mean the base game is stil there for you to play. I would also give it a chance i hate BR's but this was randomly fun and quick. You also level up toons quickly.
---
it makes it easier because the ground is a tricky bitch and loves to tell you that you cant plop down your house due to intersecting with geometry, that problem is mitigated by only having one small piece of your base touching the ground.
---
Talk to your teammates and get them on your friends list. Tell them to add you in next match if they are the leader.
---
[X] Doubt
---
y'all stop disliking his post, that's just his opinion.
---
I really loved BioShock 2s mulitplayer, I really wish it had stuck around. It was actually decent back then
---
Lol brace for the influx of shitposting about F76. "I've had the FREE game for 24 hours and I'm as sick as you guys, fuck Todd amirite?"
---
check you setting
---
It will comeback better than ever
---
Yes sir, unfortunately  I've had 3 games where I've gotten to 3 people left, 2 of which are myself and my teammate, and the last person is hiding under the map or something, lost to the circle from that
---
Reduced to swearing and insults. Classy man.
---
Randomization is to push you to trade an interact with people
---
It's because they actually balanced it. They should do the same, to a lesser extent, in both adventure and survival and it would make pvp in those modes much more fun. Right now its not balanced at all.
---
Speed, smoothness and physics. I have invested a stack of effort trying to make Fallout be more RTS but the engine just doesn't run fast enough with physics tied to frame rate for movement, let alone projectile behaviors. 
---
If you are interested in comparatives have a read of my [Gun Games (One bullet one kill)](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38529) mod based on a Call of Duty game mode. For some facts on processing speed read my  [Script Lag latency detector](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35853) page.
---
Or we can just swap subjective opinions.
---
This happened to me when I first started playing at launch.  Had a level 200+ follow me around and kill me repeatedly once I turned level 5...I did hit the person back because I didn't understand about slap damage/pacifist mode.  Just ignore people if they do that to you.  Make sure you're on Pacifist Mode and just keep walking, they'll give up.  These types of players are far and few between, many more decent players versus douchenozzles.  Not sure which platform you play on, I'm on XBox, so look me up.  During the week I'm on around 8 PM EST.  My GT is the same as my name on here.  I'd be happy to help you out!

how do we get that sweet new power armor skin?

Aww did you go up the thread to try and get upvotes ? That's adorable lol
---
Recent interview states Bethesda limited stash box to make this game a survival game.
---
As long as this game has been live, there have always been people like you, howling at the moon. And yet, countless people (including me) have stuck with it, and are experiencing only minor performance hiccups, and the occasional crash (as aggravating as that is each time, have to agree).
---
Are you playing on PC or console? If on PC, there's just so many factors that can affect performance.
---
Quick question - Are playing on Xbox like OP, or a different platform?
---
No disconnects for me since January at least. Most people harp on about how terrible it’s been haven’t played since launch if at all.
---
What platform were you playing on when you ran into this?
---
"for actually making me laugh out loud"
---
"which is something i rarely do sadly"
---
They added a bunch new guns which is all I ask for. But they streamlined and polished menus and research system.  When I logged in I got a pisston of free stuff and by the time I accepted it all I had to leave.
---
It’s worth it. I got it in December and I wasn’t sure if I wanted to come play it in the state it was in. After a few months I decided to hop back on and I haven’t had this much fun in good while
---
It would be nice to have settings to set the favorites menu let that. It's very good when you never have to open up your pipboy.
---
I love looking at the Vault and seeing little level 1's &amp; 2's...BABIES!!  But every time I run over to try to help them they run away...even using the present emote :(  Skittish little things!
---

---
There needs to be a “do not disturb” option with an automatic reply for team invites from friends, like “xxxx is currently engaged in a deadly fight with a Deathclaw, please check again later”...
---
nope, just more xp.
---
It shows up as an atomic shop item in your inventory after you rank up and earn the reward. When you either win or lose a game , your overseer experience bar will go up, and at a certain point, you will unlock better items. Ranking up has slowed down significantly since starting at lvl 0, but the rewards seem to be getting better and better. So far I have 13 wins under my belt.
---
Bethesda is a different breed than Epic, and Fortnight is a different breed than the established Fallout franchise, you dont have much to worry about, mark my words
---
Not many disconnects but the framerate is just terrible at times
---
That’s awesome. I didn’t realize how excited I would be over this. Thanks for coming back to share.
---
has anyone see them in their inventory?  i got one but i don't see it.
---
lag, and loading order.. maybe eventually they will fix it
---
It's a brand new mode so people are wanting to check it out, people will get bored with BR if they're not into it and go back to Adventure Mode especially when Wastelanders comes out.
---
i havent seen the solo/team choice..ill have to look for that.
---
They need to balance the weapons more in adventure and survival. NW feels good cause every gun is balanced. For Adv and survival they should do the same but to a lesser extent. An AAE handmade should still be noticeably stronger than a 10mm pistol, but just not as big of a gap as now. Currently, pvp in those 2 modes is over way to fast and often after a single shot or 2.
---
Unpopular opinion: Every game has shitty parts no one wants to play but has to slog through. At least this one is interesting and sorta even fun. 
---
But yeah. It's a part of the game you play to get what you want. That's like complaining parts of your camp aren't available because you have to slog through and find plans.
---
I won my first round and I didn't even fight. The scorchbeast got them.
---
Not long.  This the longest I had was 12 minutes but I never won, so longer of course it youre in the top 5.
---
Little bit off there. The megasloth icon is 9, the blue camo for the .44 is 11, statue is 12, pistol skin is 13.
---
Lmaooooooo
---
Was in the Abandoned Bogtown and had not one...not two...but five muh fuggin’ Behemoths show up in that area where the Saboteur’s living quarters.  Was some nice loot and xp!
---
Games not bad, just not for you.
---
I thought they said they were going to add that at some point though. Am I mistaken?
---
Happens to me soo, sometimes I make a game out of it and see how far I can run before I rubber band back.
---
Even funnier when a texture fails to load and you can see through it or fall into it.
---
Oh really? Fallout New Vegas you go town to town interacting with people that has a long lasting effect on the game, environment, or other NCPs. The sense of loneliness comes from the lack of achievement for when you complete a quest. Instead it feels like a mind-numbing MMO grind. I guess you can't handle criticism.
---
Huh, I must be going after it has already been mostly cleared or just unlucky.  Good to know, thanks.
---
Wow! Best I can do is top 5. I must be really good free aimer. I'm on ps4 and it's really hard w/o VATS.
---
What I want to believe will happen, if they will eventually make the entire map compatible with NW, and it can randomly select the drop location. Would make for some interesting combat when the circle starts with parts in the Savage Divide and others into Toxic Valley, etc.
---
Spoken like a true member of the brotherhood. 
---
We shall take your VATS, for this technology is dangerous in the wrong hands.
---
Holy shit i was in the middle of writing up a bethesda support ticket and it started installing for me
---
It's the state of the internet nowadays if you are expressing a controversial opinion or just rejecting someones opinion. 
---
I was called "a pathetic mongrel" just the other day because after after someone linked Emilia Clarkes 2 life threatening aneurysms to the writing of Got I asked not to make jokes of this serious condition, because I nearly lost a friend that way. It was in a thread about how she thanked r/freefolk for the charity.
---
Today I failed at making a sarcastic but otherwise harmless joke and someone responded my comment "made him angry".
---
Thats it now. If you like Fallout 76 or any other Fallout thats not 2d turn-based combat you a not a true fan, have no clue about games in general, support a greedy bunch of capitalists who have no love for gaming and ruin the whole industry and are an overall bad person.
---
I noticed this too, I did not gain any XP in Adventure.
---
First BR game that I played too and I was surprised at how enjoyable it really is.
---
Did last night on Xbox - didn't flag up waste locations so I just had to go into pip-boy and track it to see where they were - activates but doesn't auto track.
---
In PS4, when you are about to select Nuclear Winter, you press Square button to select "Fill Team" on or off.
---
I would really like to know this as well.
---
One thing I was thinking of was there being a map for each region and they rotate every match or through a voting system though I think random rotation would work better.
---
That would take time to implement and they still have Wastelanders to finish up for the Fall so we will see. They keep adding to the game so I'm ok if Nuclear Winter sticks to just one or maybe two maps.
---
Oops my bad, kinda just listed off the top of my head.
---
I went into the pip boy and there were no locations marked.
---
Good another doing a lot of work to the game but it's nice to see the improvements are actually being made
---
I love those guys. “Bethesda should stop making new content and just FIX BUGS! The game won’t go stale and lose a large chunk of players without anything new being added, they’ll just appreciate the game running better and keep playing the same repeatable quests for an eternity!” It’s like they can not fathom that there’s enough people on the project to handle both, or that a lot of the newest bugs are either created by, or discovered because of the addition of new content, or just simply benign enough to ignore for a while. They probably also think tossing more people and a singularly difficult bug will somehow make fixing it faster like in some bad RTS game “What do you mean piling all my villagers on discovering the wheel doesn’t complete it faster and is just a waste of recourses?! I swore I could see the bar moving more!”
---
Save your turrets for the Scorchbeast and just build a little fort when there's only a couple people left and the circles small.
---
Turrets don't seem to wanna target players ime but they'll snap right to creatures.
---
I play that game too lol 😂
---
I wouldent say gross, I mean it's not ideal for some(I would like a bit more leeway in exploring it) but it does incentivfy playing as the vault 51 dwellers which tho I'm not sure may be trapped in a virtual reality much like the vault in fallout 3( I noticed some terminals referencing dr.braun, who was in charge of the virtual reality experiment.
---
It's on your end. I havent had a problem after 4 hours of playing. Ive only disconnected once
---
I will say that I currently have no idea what the crates reward you as you level up 🤔
---
That would be valid if the game had distinct character roles with clear itemization requirements that make all items valuable to somebody. That's now how the items work though. The weapons themselves have a clear hierarchy of power where the best mundane weapons are better than legendary versions of lower tier items, which instantly makes most legendaries worthless. The legendary traits are also a mixed bag to the point where even top tier items can roll traits that nobody really wants. The fact that items have multiple traits means the chances to have one with all the best traits is minuscule, and if you do somehow get a top tier weapon with multiple top tier traits it probably isn't the weapon you  enjoy using the most, and only then does the possibility of trading it for an equally powerful weapon you do want start to make sense.
---
Keep in mind, it's almost impossible to tell exactly what happens due to the way armor works in this game. Most effects, like furious, increase your weapon damage, not the total damage after calculation. That increased damage still goes through enemy armor and then produces the different outcome. Previous testing has already shown that it definitely does NOT give you 80% damage

In contrast to fallout 76 I get a stable 60 fps in Fallout 4 besides specific locations such as downtown by good neighbor but there are of course mods to fix what stuttering issues do come with fo4. ESO plays 60fps consistently, Skyrim no problems. This game appears to be preforming bad due to the engine.
---
I wouldnt mind a team deathmatch mode too cause my biggest complaint about this is how long you have to wait to get back in the action after you mess up lol
---
[*Enslave humanity, will ya?!*](https://youtu.be/zGEiK9StSfQ)
---
Computer Science Major and variables are rather small variable, if we had a stash box for junk unlimited and box for weapons they could easily limit the number of unique items aka weapons and armors. But real reason is they want this to be a survival game as listed in recent interview. Also fun fact a lot of players who used the exploit for storing passed stash limit have all of their stuff still and the list is long especially when they have legendaries and other weapons. Also if you want to test it store as many unique items in stash or on your character including notes and holotapes and see how long it takes to load when its empty to when you packed to the brim with unique items.
---
If you move your camp there will be the option to put the camp back down exactly as it was before the move. You can make a blueprint of a specific structure like the main building and change the rest of the outside. But if it won't go back down like it was before the move either pick a different spot or remodel. All the individual pieces are stored so you won't use materials putting the same walls down.
---
Are you already using radicool?

Infinity -1
---
Until you find yourself in a fucking 1v4 in the final circle and a scorched beast randomly spawns and attacks you... so you have to run out in the open and die
---
It is still the beta... It isn't gonna stay until it officially drops.
---
It was insanely underrated. I spent so much time playing that I still remember some of the big daddy spawn locations lol. Only gripe was when I bought the DLC maps and I never got to play them. Because the matchmaking didnt separate people who have the DLC and those who don't.
---
Even better:

At 15 you get an X-01 blue camo skin
---
Dude, me too! I felt like an infant with a machine gun! Hahahahahah
---
yep. can confirm... started a new character to play nw...went into adventure and had a bunch of lvls gained.
---
Prepare to get attacked if you even suggest this game is not perfect in every way 😉
---
I haven't heard anything but I think it may come out with wastelanders?
---
Too late for this question!
---
Yes, that's pretty much what I have been thinking.
---
When you look at all of the issues in adventure and survival mode it becomes obvious that this team has been focusing on Battle Royale for the last 7 months.
---
That's cool and all but you've gotta give credit where credit is due........the people who said Fallout 76 was still in Beta and that Bethesda was trying to copy Fortnite were insanely accurate in their predictions 6 months ago.
---
That's usually what I do too. Glad I'm not the only one.
---
Lag.  Your computer is sending positioning data to the server but it’s ignoring it until the area is fully loaded, then you get dumped back to your starting point.  I mostly see it when entering the White Springs bunker from the service entrance.  
---
I hardly ever see it when entering White Springs itself but I always enter from the lower door on the side that leads right into the vendor area,  instead of the main doors on the front.
---
F
---
Yeah, honestly I just want some nice skins and then I'll probably head back, especially when we get some more PvE updates.
---
I solo launch on average two a day.  Most of the time in a team of people that have been playing together since beta.
---
*hears screeching noises*
---
Icy what you did there.
---
Exploration is not the equivalent of intrinsic motivation. Please do not make glaringly obvious false equivalences. In Fallout New Vegas your actions, and every quest had an impact on the game.
---
Yeah they simply need their collision turned off.
---
got chameleon a few times which is really fun in this mode.
---
Oh yes. For the nukes. Sorry if I was unclear. I haven’t launched a nuke yet. I know the codes from the officers destroy themselves but I was just curious how long I could wait once I’ve got the code solution from the printer. 
---
Thanks for your response!
---
Two people living in a see - through shack eating nothing but mutfruit and corn. They tend a few plants all day err day and fall into bed exhausted and don't even bother to shut the door they're so tired
---
Oh wow, those screenshots hurt my eyes. It looks so cluttered. If they ever make this a game feature, I pray that it's optional
---
Yes,  but  being through together with new randoms every single match is hardly as useful as grouping up with someone you already know.
---
From 1 thru 9 what looks like loot crates is actually just player icons
---
Right?! 
---
I find the one shot kill protection makes it really hard. I've did my best to sneak upon a guy and landed a headshot with a scoped hunting rifle. A second later he was running and jumping and I've couldn't hit him faster than he could stimpack. Then he just shotgunned me twice and i'm dead.
---
Thank you!!
---
Groundhog Day lol, never seen that before but I could def entertain myself with that for a while lol
---
Have you seen how much xp you get for adventure mode. I could log into adventure mode craft some Mut Chops and get more XP than a single match in BR. Honestly the XP and caps is not what I'm talking about anyway. I'm talking about the CAMP skins and Outfits.
---
I'm well aware how toxic this sub is. I expect no less from a bunch of butt-hurt 76 fanboys who spent a little too much of mommy and daddys money on the game 😉
---
That’s not bad honestly! Keep at it, this is early release so you are already ahead of the game. I would say the most annoying thing for me is receiving duplicate perk cards 😤 I just want the frog legs perk card!!!
---
If you are testing in nuclear winter, they have stated everything is rebalance. Will not be the same values as adventure/survival.
---
Made 4 yesterday
---
Hope they decide to make scrap unlimited, real thing holding this game back to the hardcore hoarders like me, currently 28 alts holding various things with the required perks to lower weights and 2 with over the max storage so they can't walk anymore.
---
It's in Beta
---
My downs were counting as my kills when my teammate was finishing them off.
---
OH FUCK YES PLEASE. The Ash Heap is seriously my favorite part of the map and I feel like late game there's not much reason to go there. Please do this, or add some more Ash Heap content
---
I noticed this too! Looks strange without the fingerless gloves to go with it
---
Yea I do think they spent a good amount of time on this and just took for granted adventure mode. Like they would just port FO4 with some changes and it would be cool. They found out the hard way but now they can focus on making the rest of the game enjoyable
---
well you could blueprint your buildings within that spot and rebuild them in other spots. in 76 you have your own spot and you can move it where ever you want it to be, almost. Except for map locations and a few other exceptions. Youtubing fo76 camp building tips/guides will be your best/easiest/simplest way to learn a few tricks to get going.
---
Hide in outhouses to survive. 😛
---
Tacking on a BR mode while Adventure mode still has serious bugs is really tone-deaf. I hope they see that.
---
Just get the free trial they are doing and try it for yourself. I say yes but I see these posts on here daily, so just try it for yourself. Now is the best time since they have a free trial.
---
I mean, I wanna build my CAMP... but I want it to look "post apoc" ya know?
---
Crossplay between the console versions would be cool but i wouldn't want it with PC because of the different inputs, different settings and hackers and modders.
---
Cool ! Let's prepare some nukashine :)
---
MMhhhmmm. It's all fun and games until someone puts a plague doctor mask on. then it's all fun and games

Yes, you'll still have the carry weight.  It's all in the legs. Also, you can increase carry weight  by 100 on all PAs by installing calibrated shocks on both legs :)

It doesnt change the fact that what happened is unacceptable, and we shouldn't be allowing this just because someone else is giving us worse things.

My son and I gave it a go last night. as much as I thought I would hate playing another fortnite style game mode it turns out nothing like it since you have mobs and players to deal with. 
---
   LONG STORY SHORT WE HAD A BLAST PLAYING IT.
---
After reading all the positive commentary about Nuclear Winter, I think the development team have been focusing all their efforts on trying to get the Battle Royale element right.
---
I can't blame them - it's probably going to keep more people playing and even draw more new players than the announcement that I can \_finally\_ put a few bottles of Nuka Cola on my end table.
---
I'm still looking forward to doing that though, or at least getting a few more items and display options!
---
What happens, if anything, if you do follow it
---
Both fortnite and pubg give credit to the person who downed them.
---
I was a bit worried about this negative at first but it seems to work out pretty well.
---
This has to be a troll and a bad one at that.
---
Yes please! Just have the lobby area be in adv/surv mode so you can take time to explore the holotapes and take in the view and such.
---
If that cant be done, remove the lobby aspect and just place the interior + holos/terminals in there so people can enjoy it without the countdown for the matches and such! :)
---
the right squad makes this mode absolutely fun. ESPECIALLY if one of your squad sticks around after they die to spectate and tell you where the bad guy is ; )
---
Depends how long you last. I've read 20 mins max for a round but never survived that long. Lol
---
Add a fucking quit button when you're downed and can't be revived cause your team sucks at teaming. Tired of having to reload the game.
---
On this, can anyone explain where we access the crates/rewards. I can’t see them in my player inventory to open them etc. I actually think this needs to happen at the main menu under character or something as whatever is happening now is confusing the crap out of me.
---
Thanks! Do you know how to get it by any chance?
---
What "sucks" really depends on people.  I enjoy the game because I love exploring the map and collecting junk and doing random events, it doesn't really feel like I'm just walking to point A to B, I'm basically just living in the game world when I play.  But not like I don't understand whypeople can't get into it.  I mean, I usually take my time with open world games, and don't bother speeding through to main quest, and i usually find things to do on my own and come up with my own goals, even if its something small like collecting junk.  Many of the quests you actually have to explore to find, either from robots or by just encountering locations.  This part might not interest you if you're not into the lore/story but you can explore and read notes or listen to holotapes to learn the story behind the locations, which i find cool and never really did in previous games.  It's not the best falllout in the sereis but I can enjoy it.  There are aspects of the game hat sucks but overall i think it's in the "Ok" range.
---
Same boat, I'm struggling with the spastic movements of players. I avoid PVP in general but I want these skins/plans so will have to just do it the hard way I guess. :/
---
seen a comment it shows up in the pip-boy perks menu, but idk, haven't tried it
---
Nope.  
---
Though you never know. This game does hit a spot for some players. I'd say try the free trial, or check back once Wastelanders drops. That update/expansion should change up the game SIGNIFICANTLY.   
---
Until then, it's the same as it ever was, just a bit less buggy and most of the assholes have jumped ship and gone to other games. That's all.
---

The plans drop from the Free Range event. The plans are RNG so you may need to farm it a bit.
---
I've long planned to turn legendary items off if/when private servers go live, and allow for it.
---
You've missed my point completely, good job!
---
You shouldn’t. If that’s a deal breaker for you, so be it. But don’t come in to an active sub and shit talk a game THEY like and expect sympathy. 
---
It’s too bad you had a bad experience but we really don’t care if you leave.
---
I'd say with 52 people coming at you, it's probably just like your mom's sex life.

Thanks! I already have calibrated shocks on my excavator suit, but you have to wear a full set to get the basic carrying capacity bonus from that PA and I wanted to make sure that didn’t get messed up if I modified the helmet.

I just sit there for a few minutes with nothing but a call for help button. I'll start capturing video from now on instead of quitting.
---
They should keep us in the vault the whole time and not send us back to main menu. Make the vault the whole hub for nuclear winter and have a section where when we are ready for the BR we can hit play. I want more time to explore but less time between matches
---
Lol you're make an irrelevant conclusion. I said nothing against your claim NV exploration is bad because it's a desert. I said that exploration is not the same as intrinsic motivation. Go ahead and google that, I'm fairly certain you didn't even know what I meant.
---
My buddy and I agreed; we could die within 5 minutes of each match without a single kill and still have more fun than PUBG... I just get pissed at that game.
---
I don’t think this will go well. I see what you mean but legendaries are a big part of adventure. I mean I’m not OP and nuked whitesprings is very very tough without legendaries. They are meant to lengthen the game for higher levels. Also a good legendary can get you to respec your character and play even longer with a new build.
---
I don't think providing constant support for free is unacceptable
---
it would be nice if the surrounding area was a giant rad storm around the nuke zone. would be a bit more accurate to radiation fallout
---
He was about to get to his hackin and wackin
---
Idk......I feel like they stuck a fork in it.
---
Nuclear Winter has a long way to go to catch up to Fortnite. I'm sure they'll abandon adventure mode the same way Fortnite abandoned theirs.
---
Hopefully they announce Fallout 5 soon.
---
Maaan, you don't deserve downvotes. You aren't hating on anything, you say your opinion. I get your point, I don't like BR either, but I still haven't tried nuclear winter so I can't say if it's better in F76.
---
If they would ask me to choose between: Time spent on more human NPCs or Time spent on a Battle Royale mode. I would choose the first 100% of the times. But hey, if that's what then devs wanted to make, I'm with it.
---
I want a Capture The Flag mode...   
---
imagine being able to build a CAMP fortress around your flag and then having to defend it....
---
Most of the boxes are just player icons.
---
Could have been a bug with your update, people have been reporting various issues with certain aspects of their games that seem pretty individual. You could try reinstalling but no one wants to do that obviously.
---
I just checked it and it can be applied to all armor except ultracite..
---
This type of mods should come directly in the game, they are incredibly easy to implement by the developers and there is also a very low or almost null level of causing worrying bugs, as well as ordering consumables which are VERY necessary.
---
If I were a game developer ... I would even put these life facilities for atoms (50-300 atoms) and maybe part of the benefits obtained by these mods offered to the original devs.
---
Especially now that they are starting to restrict external addons ... although then apparently there are people with various hacks: /
---
*A ton of the same bugs are still here from the beta. *
---
Lists 1 bug...
---
PRAISE KEANU DEL BEIRUT
---
Sheepsquatch Club.
---
I have a flaming one.
---
I think its foolish and rude of Bethesda to push a game style that they aren't famous for. I like grinding quests and what not but this is ass.
---
I’m not at all getting those numbers from my furious minigun. Gains 1 point of damage after like 10 shots or so lol
---
Yeah but only after she died. She could only handle about 20 when she was alive.
---
As I said, it's not really a big deal, just an annoyance at times.
---
Glad I'm not the only one.
---
General incompetence with the design team for not including some form of surrender button.
---
Thank you!
---
repair kits are borderline p2w, so that one is a matter of principle
---
That’s true. I was listening to a holotape and was interrupted by the game starting.
---
I'm going to use this time to work on aiming manually I think and save vats for criticals on the more tanky mobs, as I realised last night over on NW I cant aim for toffee anymore!
---
Yeah, it won't affect it at all. You're golden
---
Your point was that a game mode has incentive for every type of player and that bad because BR and me no like br because br dumb.
---
If it goes deeper than that then you're gonna have to explain.
---
It's the same engine as Skyrim and FO4, though, but the added netcode and (especially) server lag are bottlenecks. I am playing on a base PS4, and things are ~~fine~~good enough.
---
I wonder if he was used duped as an adjective and not a verb and was actually trying to say "I'm sure we all possess duped items"
---
I was just wandering the wastes, I believe I was somewhere relatively close to outside Flatwoods, when I came across a wandering pair of a level 22 and level 18 voice chatting to eachother along with another newbie a level below me following them. They came up to me, asked me if I was alright since I just finished fighting some Ghouls, all that. We started talking, and we eventually bonded over our love for Fallout and also, strangely enough, Warframe. We got together into a party and we had an absolutely amazing time--they gave me some vanity apparels, some shotgun shells, nice stuff like that. Now I'm level 7 and have  a decently basic base up and running--but I'll never forget that amazing party experience. I have them added as friends and we plan on playing later!
---
Honestly, this community is a lot nicer than I expected. I've had an amazing time wandering the wastes, helping out people lower than me by letting them stay and cook/rest at my base, having nice chats with high leveled people, all that. Truly amazing--I'd so buy this game if I had the money right now.
---
Or a quit the match method like every other BR game I'm existence.
---
Yeah the game is okay, but the bugs and performance are the deal breaker for me lol. I actually refunded this game around launch because it was so bad, I thought it got better but it hasn't. There are still some of the same issues from launch, such as ghouls standing while dead, or terminals getting you stuck for a solid minute.
---
Just trying to do the quest for the top of the world. But keep getting killed by mobs. Just annoying
---
3 mins is way too long. There's really nothing to see. You unlock a holotape like every 10 levels. And by the time you hit level 5 your going to want to blow your own brains out. 3 minutes of people grunting and playing the mouth harp.
---
It is fun
---
Yea that would be dope. I can see them doing something like that. With CAMP integration
---
The crates are only icons, the other rewards are new NW perk cards
---
I'd assume yes as the only advantage overseer rank gives is the ability to taunt under 10's from behind the grids.
---
Ok. First, not everyone is interested in or in love with fortnite 76. Second, no, fuck no, hell fucking no.   
---
the \_only\_ good part of 76 for higher level players in my opinion is running around and grinding/min-maxing and collecting better and better legendary gear.
---
Yup was one of the first things I done. Running almost a full Agility set.
---
After I die, i watch ppl play, and some are so good they remind me of Fatal1ty from quake 3. i had a mouse and keyboard back then.  Loved those railgun fights on the space maps.
---
Thx blizz for the huge update outside of usual update day, and before i could get unstoppable monster. I just found out how good the weapon was &amp; was going to finish the 1 remaining requirement after work last night.
---
I'll do that today while I'm at work. Hopefully it'll be done copying by then.
---
I think you can
---
It’s one bug that was here since the beta. And it happened in the first 4 second of gameplay. If my character didn’t get deleted I would gladly go venture into the wasteland to go find plenty more.
---
I find it super annoying how we actually get to be inside two different vaults, but you’re in one for only a small part of the whole game, only to NEVER return, and the other you’re only in for a short period of time.
---
I like the NW be mode it's something different to get you out of the daily grind, plus I'm just curious at what the reward will be at higher lvls so I will grind it non stop se how far I get this week...
---
Some crates you see in the rewards are for crafting on adventure mode and some are player icons
---
Its rifle, so, rifle perks. There are automatic reciver for auto rifle perks.
---
Highest requirement I've seen so far for overseer level is 121, btw, forget where though.
---
Your answers made my day cause I falsely assumed you’d have to come 1st to get that vault boy statue, bring on lvl 12 whoop,whoop 🎉
---
Ohh so the medium AMD small crates are just perk cards?
---
My only complaint is load times, but honestly it's not too bad.
---
Yes, ranged auto is the way to go with a shotgun for close ups.
---
Yeah thought it intentional as well. 
---
I figured the Outfits for the lobby and the start of the game were fine.
---
What I would like to see though is the option to swap out the under armour for Atom Shop under armour.
---
Holy shit dude... I just spit my drink.
---
I've seen multiple people write that gun-fu is broken, but mine is working fine. I toggled the perk off and back on and I had to remap my VATS key. Working as intended.
---
The publisher and developer are both Bethesda. While these issues are the fault of devs, they're still Bethesda
---
Server drops are no longer a widespread issue. As with all online games they happen from time to time, but what you experienced was an anomaly. I’ve seen a lot of reports today and yesterday of disconnects inside the vault itself, which makes some sense with all the new trial players in character creation at the same time. 
---
As for feeling isolated and lonely....well...that’s the point isn’t it? It’s a huge world and everybody’s dead. I can see why that may not be appealing to some people, but clearly the game is accomplishing the vibe it was going for. You not liking it doesn’t make it objectively bad—good or bad are entirely subjective concepts. 
---
Long story short, if you can’t handle the occasional bug or disconnect, and you don’t enjoy the idea of self directed exploration of a dead world that’s full of lore, then 76 isn’t for you. That’s fine, but everybody has had enough of the dramatic declarations about this game.
---
I had one bug where my gun wouldn’t reload and bother where if I was in PA it said I was over encumbered but when I exited it I was fine. As for automatics I stick to close to mid range otherwise at long range I miss everything.
---
Aw that sucks. Yeah it's my first time playing. Or it would be my first time playing if the server didn't keep disconnecting every few seconds.
---
love the new game mode but dont want legendaries removed from adventure.... the chance of getting good legendary gear is the only thing that makes some fights worth fighting in adventure.
---
I.e. if you go to adventure mode your character will be able to craft a crate for your camp, or if you get in the atomic shop you can click on unlocked items to set as favorites and you can wear them in NW
---
Right?!?! It’s so odd
---
I haven’t paid that close attention... I’ve only been in there storm once and was panicking lol.  However, I have taken player damage while using a stim and it did stop
---
You can leave the circle briefly (taking 5 rad damage) to dodge nukes!
---
Thanks.
---
Nice I won once and it was all because we stayed together. Calling stuff out
---
Yeh, I played for like 4-5 hours today not one person even responded in voice when I talked :/
---
I assume computer terminals are where people are finding these gatling guns they tear assholes up with?
---
Or you could choose not to use your legendary one shot gear.
---
Some a little more advance tip would be USE your quems before engaging, if you see enemies look thru your quems and apply them the can are really useful specially stealth boys since you keep being invisible even after firing and they last 30 secs, I'm at LVL 20 and enjoying the BR mode...
---
I already have a vending machine and I mostly sell legendary weapons but I don’t ever make caps off it. any idea what sells well usually?
---
You have to buy the game. That is the only cost after the free trial.
---
Lets just for a second assume your idea isn't the worst I've heard in months. I mean, it is, but lets assume it isn't.
---
Your goal is to keep newer players while giving a giant finger to older players, what do we get out of this, beyond not having the gear we've devoted hundreds of hours grinding for?
---
The canvas bags!
---
I still find that to be the funniest thing of all time.
---
That's gonna be quite the delay, from when it was announced.
---
Ohhh so you don’t get a recipe it just adds stuff?
---
Well damn I guess its the wave of trial accounts
---
They're just jumping onto the BR train which is fine but they shouldn't put STORY MATERIAL behind mass levels of a TREND. This is what i think. Sorry you disagree
---
I've placed my camp over 25 times in NW in does not change the location of your camp in adventure.
---
Would u have said the same if the SB targeted them and u won?
---
Been like this from the start. Annoying but as others have done, turn it into a game. If I spawn at Whitesprings I play the game of 'can I grab a coat hanger before I'm pulled back' or if I'm going to Whitesprings from the bunker I play 'try to make it out the hidden wall door before pulled back' (I've won that one once).
---
I've played two matches. I can't even tell where to go to look at what I've unlocked. I saw the screen after, but it was so fast. Does leveling up my overseer level actually do anything?
---
Here is a pic of my first win.  I didn't get any nukes, elite kills or revives so it wasn't as much.
---
https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/mark-error-404/screenshot/12278136
---
Better a scorched beast then a sheepsquatch or deathclaw loll I don't mind it. You can just build and hide if you wanted. You can also use the SB to find the rest of the players. I mean by the end you should have stimpaks and marine armour so you should be fine.
---
Yes I most definitely need to step outside my comfort zone when it comes to using different weapons, I felt so out of sync using some weapons because they are ones I have never touched in adventure. One weapon I did take a liking too was the crossbow that loads up 3 shots it was very efficient!
---
LOL this guy get it, but really there is some cool skins and camp plans to earn as you level up...
---
Holy F*ck what how
---
Well, unless you are already a high level, I don’t think you’ll be getting that many cool skins.
---
I’m pretty sure you get 2 weapon skins, 1 power armor skin, 2 crates for your camp, and an overseers chair. That’s all up to rank 22. 
---
I get they don’t want to give you everything but I’d rather have a cool overseer vault 51 jacket or some crap instead of the weapons or 2 crates.
---
My finger was never cut off. I knew what I was purchasing. 
---
I hope that clears it up.
---
I was discussing this last night with the squad.  BR in the Bog would be flippin nutz! Lol. But, as stated above, I'm almost certain that it's being worked on .
---
The Todd just like to feed us lil baby bites lol. Helps keep the game alive.
---
make sure you have space..it will add the updates too.
---
actually, now that I think about it. when you move your camp it auto blueprints. you just have to go to the blueprints section
---
We take sexy time very seriously in this household.
---
Same here^
---
For me the locations of the toxic waste stopped tracking the day after the first time i did the quest. 
---
Just walk over to where they are and grab them. They spawn in the same spots usually. 
---
If the quest doesn't work at all then that sucks.
---
Urban Warfare at it's finest
---
The way I get caps is this: I see what I still need to be done (quests or challenges) while working on those if i see events on the map i go straight for them. While doing that if I come by a workshop, I'll claim it and hang at the workshop for a few minutes to trigger the defend event. I complete it and make resource gatherers before defending and selling what I dont need. 
---
After defending you'll get plans, if you dont need them I throw then into my vendor for a decent price not too high but not too low. I make sure to have at least a few items in each category to make it look like my camp has tons of stuff for sale to bring people into my camp, they'll be more likely to by something that I have when they hover over my camp and see every category with items in there.
---
Also I'll run the silos. You dont HAVE to launch a nuke but doing the silo quest you'll get 100 caps, including  stimpaks sometimes.
---
And doing this type of run through the game, will give you a great amount of xp and caps. Plus if you throw your well rested bonus on and eat some food that grants 5% extra xp. You'll be rolling in caps and xp. (I know you're looking for caps primarily but it all helps, imo)
---
Yeah my mom has had that affect on a lot of people.
---
So I’ve actually started reading that recently, but wasn’t really sure if it had been updated to include the contents of 76?
---
Annoying, but come on, you hit a single bug and ragequit out of the game. That's not to say that bug isn't bad, or that you don't have a right to, but to suggest that none of the beta bugs have been solved because you hit one... it's just not true.
---
What’s the point of playing if your just gonna surrender
---
I can see that but a solid confirmation either.
---
Due to limitations we aren't going to pursue junk decorating.
---
We are pushing back camp decorating in its current form until we can get it to work right, in the mean time we are also working on nuclear winter.
---
i want to get the game but afraid of the big download as i have limited bandwidth and 2 ps4s one of which doesn't have a lot of free space, how much is a fresh download on ps4? help a fellow vault dweller go outside the vault.
---
Overseer Levels give no competitive advantage. But level 5s and below should be paired with each other so they can still get used to the game.
---
It’s free, try the new mode or base game see if it’s for you.
---
Yeah it just doesn’t work at all for me.
---
Is there a way for me to see what I’ve unlocked without just going through each crafting option etc? Or rather do you know if*
---
Better a sb 2v3 vs a Sb 1v4
---
Pretended? Cute.
---
It was a giant buggy mess of spaghetti code, mismatched UI and broken game elements. It was at pre-beta level on release day.
---
Bethesda has gotten a pass for a LONG time due to the quality of their storytelling and world building as well as the incredibly hard work of a legion of wildly talented and devoted modders. Unfortunately that won't fly in what's basically an MMO.
---
I still love playing. But I shouldn't have to fight the game just to do so.
---
- Why does it still scrap items you want to save (I'm looking at you cooking oil and teddy bears) BEFORE bulk you have of that type? The game actively punishes you for bulking things to save space if you're trying to save anything that can be scrapped.
---
- Why is there NO meaningful way to manage perks outside of clumsily changing them one by one? If you're on PC and it's not a major patch (like NW), you're in luck with the amazing [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124). But there's no excuse to make perk management such a ridiculous struggle.
---
- Accidentally destroying or losing items is WAY WAY WAY too easy! Why not just have a "do not destroy flag" that functions like favorites?
---
- Why does junk count against stash size? Given how janky the connection is at times, I completely believe that the servers are very fragile and can't handle even a couple seriously players brimming with unique items. But junk is NOT unique, has no stats or condition to track and is basically item # and quantity. Don't let people carry tons because encumberance... that's RPG 101. But given the nature of a crafting and hopefully one day collecting game (teddy bears!) the way stash is handled is idiotic.
---
- Why are some builds so much insanely better across the board? Bloodied rules. And not by a small margin. Yes there is more risk and it does require some amount of luck and/or cost but that has gone WAY down with player vending. I see 1* unyielding items for nothing, and that's honestly enough for a stealth sniper. Nobody should be able to one-shot anything short of the SBQ or imposter sheepsquatch.
---
- Game sessions are still VERY buggy at times. Quests disappear and reappear at random (Biv), some items can't be placed in CAMP mode (erroneously floating), enemies can't be hurt (damage done is shown but the grey "server is validating your damage bar remains then damage is negated). I've started terming it "server desync"... it happens to one person on the team, not all. And relogging is the only solution.
---
- It shouldn't take MINUTES to finish joining the game world on login! Patch 9.5 was especially brutal. Log in, can't see camp or any post launch content (posters, scrip machine, etc) and can't interact with world lootables.  It's quite funny seeing people go into my camp and buy stuff at my vendor when I can't even see what they're standing on!
---
- Still WAY too many unnamed or misnamed plans and mods! Urban scout armor is a flat out nightmare to deal with modding... save your sanity. Other items are often comical... what does  a mod called nothing more than "Bladed" do? What about a plan for "44" or "rug 2" (yes 44 is obvious if you're even remotely familiar with guns but that's still quite idiotic naming). It took MONTHS to even get the named tag on plans so you knew that the randomly named plan that has no content about usage (like the multiple Whitespring plans that produce identical looking items but for wildly different prices).
---
- Scrapping items to learn plans and mods is great... except it isn't. How are you supposed to know that neat new item you found is craftable? Scrap it and hope you can find another? That works for a TINY handful of items and is a complete scrapshoot. Or weapon mods... there is no meaningful way to know if a weapon even has mods and is worth scrapping (black powder weapons have none that can be learned) or if you've learned all you can after breaking dozens. Armor is far worse since it takes 10x as many scraps to learn mods on average.
---
- Why are items so ephemeral? Yes everything is made up of pixels, I get it... but the game barfs, eats your one in a million item and there are zero options. Suck it up and keep moving is not a viable option in a modern MMO or GaaS... but that's all you'll hear from support.
---
- Some non-daily challenges are impossible... completed but not credited in beta, requirements don't exist like creatures tagged as "alien" (fixed in the past month maybe) or just not being recognized by the game (a fairly large swath of the tadpole ones). Most appear to be a misspelling or miscategorization. That's pretty damned embarrassing in a game this size.
---
- Dailies are not fun by and large. At least it's not "drink 20 böözes today" level bad anymore, but the alien ones are crap (only one in game and good ol Flatwoods monster is random and stupidly rare for the overwhelming majority of the player base). Yes it's free money, but 60¢ is hardly compensation to spend upwards of 2 hours to complete the sometimes idiotic requests. They SHOULD be encouraging events (but not with stupid conditions like diseased) or exploration, not forcing grouping for solo players or nearly impossible combinations for pennies.
---
- LEARN TO USE ALL OF THE WORDS! Somewhat related to challenges... they really need a copy editor for the ingame verbiage. "Take a picture of a player in cultist garb with X"... easy enough if you have the camera (ugh) and a friend. But what counts as cultist garb? I know because of Reddit, but that's an unacceptable crutch. Don't force people to search outside resources for BASIC game info.
---
- That demonic camera... forcing numerous server hops to find an item that is basically required for a lot of atom income (challenges) or even game content (tadpole) is unacceptable. It was the antithesis of fun. Whereas the posters and notes at train stations for new content is great and super engaging? The difference is staggering.
---
That's all I can think of off the top of my head. It's barely in a release state now. I'll damn well keep playing, but that neither excuses nor mitigates the state this game launched in. Nor the wealth of bugs that are still haunting it.
---
Why not just add a Legendary-less mode?
---
Yeah I pretty much never drop at one of the names sites, you can get just as much loot elsewhere and no enemies, on issues is nuclear briefcases if you’re going for that but honestly it’s a lot of work for little reward.
---
Yep, as much as I hated the idea of repair kits, there was basically no reason to cry over them like everyone was.
---
the loading time is what kills it for me
---
I'm not really sure, sadly.
---
You need better teammates.
---
&gt;Down/Reviving
---
Isn't it supposed to be bad? And there are tools for reviving. In one match a teammate build a wall kit before me and then revived me in cover. Also if your team is good they should harras the enemy so that he don't gets the kill shot on you.
---
I think the danger to get killed soon after you go down adds to the fast pace of a match.
---
I like it as i is right now.
---
&gt;Armor
---
I think thats a thing of balancing. I don't believe the work on that is done yet. 
---
&gt;Nukes
---
7 games played, 2 of them with a nuke. I agree, it should be frequent, as it is a great mechanic when everyone is rushing out of ground zero and runs into another. 
---
&gt;Rewards
---
What? How are they CAMP items? I don't get it, I just assumed they get implemented later when the game mode is live.
---
&gt;Melee
---
I really like the idea of a seperate melee mode.
---
I know, right?  Even when I start chasing them across the map, they still won't stop!
---
Mfw you dont even need camo to hide in bushes. 
---
I used to use the patriot suit and hide in bushes and people would run right by me.
---
Well, firstly, avoiding a fucking item wipe. The game has been plagued time and again with duping on a frankly massive scale. There was a group of people at the WS train yard last night *giving away* entire stacks of 3\* bloodied weapons. If you want the best OP gear in the game, all you have to do is know a guy, and you can get it for free. 
---
In the face of such crazy imbalance and a totally borked economy, what options does Beth have?
---
The gift or follow me emotes are my personal favourites.
---
You’re naive if you think you’ve never had a duped item in your possession lol. Unless you picked it up yourself then it could very well be a duped item. Especially early on.
---
You're triggered because I came off as an intellectual, but you want to disagree with me. So I guess that was just protection when you called me a troll then. Keep responding and these toxic fanboys will keep giving you a minuscule amount of karma.
---
You need to establish an additional baseline test case. 
---
Install a fresh copy of Windows 7 (on your spare hard drive), apply all Microsoft Updates, then try FO76 again.  
---
Your existing Windows 7 install may have malware/virus/dirty registry etc.  We don't know how long ago it was installed.
---
Interesting post though and I did read the whole thing.
---
I find gatling guns on my enemies.
---
I use the grenade launcher mostly. I just got the bigger radius a few matches ago and it's glorious. Early game it one hits on direct impact and 2 hits with splash damage.
---
I see my bad i consider stuff like those rewards trophies. Thought i could offer some insight but that situation seems above my pay grade.
---
around when Fo76 got released I got stuff from petrified corpses and just stop getting them a month later was wondering why
---
I notice drops from monsters kind of mirror what you have in your inventory. I have lots of assasin on my PvP guy and see a lot of it drop, and instigating on my PvE guy, and run into that a lot. A different time I got 3 Anti Armor weapons in a row, and use a lot of those on the same PvP guy. The day I got those bash damage weapons I was messing around with a Bloodied Railway rifle with bash damage on it a little earlier. It doesn't seem totally random.
---
... is that a serious question? The answers run from "Hey, my team is full of idiots who are running around punching walls while I'm down right bellow them and I don't want to waste my time" to "oh shit, my entire team is down, and I'm stuck in this STUPID FUCKING IDLE ANIMATION for the next minute, and I'd rather join a different match then watch some soulless sack of shit t-bag me".
---
My money makers are: cheap junk legendaries (once I hit my script cap for the day), serums, plans and junk. Definitely plans and junk. I sell ultracite armor plans for 200c each and cant keep them in stock. Leadniz a good junk item. When i dont have spare acid to smelt before I sell, ore sells just as well if not better. I think people might like the ore because you dont drop on death
---
A nuke like that would net so much flux
---
Crafting survival games as a service are a trend and you're literally inside of one.
---
I see your point though. My guess is that the story and lore is available to the people who grind it out now, but the full thing will be available to most people upon actual release.
---
And hey if not, you have the lifetime of this game to figure it out. And those events are gonna get old sometime.
---
Agreed, it is uber punishing even for a full team that is caught unaware or unprepared.
---
Oh best part for people who love fallout and preordered game is if we waited 1 week we would of gotten discounts, still kicking myself seeing the game go on discount so fast and I preordered the Tricentennial edition.
---
They're pay to lose. You can repair gear to 200% at workbenches.
---
Skipped to end. Noticed you popped all your meds. Only one chem is active at a time, it'll be the last one.
---
Forgot meds sell well too
---
I have plenty of space, I don't think it's that
---
If  you disagree it doesnt matter much im mostly just venting my disappointment
---
And here I was thinking being a minuteman made me cool.
---
I'd be fine with starting over fresh, myself, but I thought proposing yet another game mode would be even more unpopular. I clearly underestimated the love people have for their imaginary equipment.
---
I find gatling guns in crates, or on bodies. Never once have I hacked a terminal or lock picked anything. I could just have dumb luck though. Usually when I'm searching I almost always find an auto laser rifle, gatling gun, or lever action rifle.
---
it would be great to win, but im usually killed early or i last until about 5 left. ill keep getting better. getting lucky with ur spawn choice is a big factor.
---
the vault boy and girl are just paintjobs for power armor helmets. they should work if you paint an excavator helmet
---
Go play 007 for Nintendo 64 bruh
---
..AVOIDING an item wipe? You're calling for the biggest wipe possible without actually deleting all our characters and starting over. Actually no, I'd rather they do _that_ then follow your bone headed plan. 
---
As for "what options do they have" I'd say "throwing away the best part of the game" shouldn't be one of them, dude. I'm out, this plan is fucking stupid and I hope no one listens to you.
---
There is something toxic about downvoting people because you don't like their criticisms of the game. There is also something toxic about constantly bashing people who have negative opinions of the game, maybe stop and think for a second about whether it's actually the game, or if thousands of people just reach the same negative conclusions about the game because they're trolls.
---
I've seen a lot of subreddits with toxic fanboys, but this is by far the worst.
---
You can add in the terminal tip the option to get a nuclear key card, it seems to jump between key card and stimpack
---
Do you have to wear the head piece from the underlining or is it optional?
---
Thank you for actually adding something to the conversation. 
---
But I didn’t say that none of the bugs have been solved. I’m sure a lot have been fixed.
---
But I encountered a similar bug in the beta and to see the same thing within 4 seconds of gameplay, 8months later is very discouraging. Not really a rage quit, it just makes me want to go play a game that doesn’t have problems like this.
---
Yes, make 6 different maps (one for each region) and just randomize which one for which lobby. Would be amazing and would do wonders to ensure the longevity of the game tbh
---
There are like hundreds of vaults lore-wise, I'm really not that torn up if I miss the chance to see the lore of one of them (lore that's designed from the ground up to explain something as trite as Battle Royale). I don't doubt I've missed more than a couple of vaults over the last few games. If it bothers you that much you can always just go look up the lore once it's all posted on the wikis. 
---
As far as why they don't just *give* you what you want, I just find the whole attitude off-putting. 
---
&gt; And it's going to result in a tiny percentage of the playerbase ever seeing the story in-game
---
It's *one vault.* It's not like you can't finish any of the story mission until you reach #1 on the NW leaderboards. This just comes across as melodramatic and hyperbolic.
---
I like the SB spawning in the final circle. Adds a better dynamic to the game than ot being a camp fest.
---
Yeah I was trying to get my voice chat working to explain the reason I wasn't shooting people was because, despite having multiple guns, I had no ammo, but the best I could manage was the ghoul-stink emote. 
---
Also, to my team from last night, if you're reading this I'm really sorry I dced, my wifi cut out and didn't start up again for a good 10 minutes. I hope you guys won and I'm sorry I couldn't contribute more.
---
Its optional - 
---
I just wear it all the time. Its not part of the Outfit :P
---
I didn't see a conversation tho
---
Damn.  I was hoping that was the case.  Oh well.
---
1) Currently West Tek, the Burrows under Harper's Ferry, and the WS Golf House, is a good run for legendary farming. Uranium fever, Free Range, and One Violent Night should also yield at least 1 legendary upon finishing. Any low level legendaries you don't plan on using can be scrap for scrips, which can be spent at the legendary vendor.
---
2) Mainly "use at your own risk" still
---
3) Only time I take workshop is for the weekly challenge for atoms.  There are other methods to farm more of those materials. Workshops is more of a small passive boost for the material you're farming
---
4) Oh yes, I've sold plenty of legendaries for cheap. I've bought some good legendaries at reasonable caps. Same goes for aid items and materials that were far cheaper than npc vendors.
---
5) Nothing very game breaking I'm aware of right now. There's still bugs here and there but a lot have been squashed since launch.  Wild Appalachia added some sizable quest content to jump into.
---
Yep did that, it stated diseases deathclaw in my viewfinder. I'll try with a Scorchbeast when I'm next on. If it works then great, if not oh well I guessm
---
I mean the armor was supposedly invented by fallout 3s enclavein broken steel
---
Tip #3: YES!
---
Requested a weapon. Tesla rifle. Paired that with chameleon and easy win.
---
FREE WOOBIE
---
These are super weak to bullets. It takes 10 bullets max from any gun that's not a pipe weapon.
---
Not if you get knifed to death right at the start and your games only last 19 seconds T_T
---
Wouldn't it seem better iyo to continue the duration of the stim but not allow it to heal while taking damage? If it still has time left and the attacker starts missing then healing starts till the remaining time is out. 
---
It'd still need the technicality of dealing with storm damage differently, wouldn't feel like such a waste for the user, and the attacker could still have a fair shot at a kill as long as they keep hitting their target.
---
Not sure what nerve I hit with you; it's just a suggestion, like so many others here. But yeah, feel free to fuck right the hell off.
---
How do you make the letters big?
---
I killed a man with a trident
---
It’s locked in the binding menu. If you want to change FOV you use the bound key for it. There is no camera distance change (for now).
---
What platform are you on?
---
Money grabbing shit storm is a stretch when most of the player base is happy for now. And it hasn't lost anything, it just added to it. Plus it's just for this week as of now and it's free to play.
---
That being said, again people would call this game a "Minecraft trend rip off that's degrading the games RPG tendencies and turning it into the most bare bones money grabbing shit"
---
So. It's kinda always been that rhetoric.
---
A conversation occurs between two people. One who stated an experience they had. And another who uses their brain to formulate a worthwhile response to the first persons experience. Rather than just saying ok.
---
I tried to heal outside in the storm and it wouldn't  heal.
---
It pretty much is a kill in NW because you can't move when you are downed. All it does is create an environment for greedy fucks to shoot at a downed enemy instead of the 3 others that are alive and are an actual threat.
---
Oh I'd have no problem with them adding another game mode...I think some people would dig it.
---
I think about how terrifying it was simply crawling around Flatwoods when I was newly out of the Vault.  With no legendary anything.
---
They'd have to adjust mob health and stuff because I would have no desire to face a level 80 SB with some  current vanilla weaponry...
---
I know this will not be possible but the one thing I realized are the loot boxes. I think they should respawned randomly in different areas. I feel like a lot of the players who were playing it consistently learned where all the good/great loot boxes are and go for them. Knowing exactly where to go to grab all the great gears kinda leave the newbies or the not so pvp players sitting ducks. I played a little yesterday and didn’t know what to expect but dang not even 2 minutes into the game, someone already has a full set of PA. Kinda disappointed but it was still fun fighting for my life and getting my butt kicked! 😂😂😂
---
Dude's whole complaint is, "I cAn'T dO tHiS mAkE iT eAsIeR fOr Me!!"  Just ridiculous. They can read the wiki on it if they really must know the lore.
---
I'd vote dodgy.
---
i didn't think they could hurt u if u didn't shoot back  ?
---
but if it's really bad, just put yourself 'offline' (or have ur profile so only friends can see u online)
---
now that may not solve it completely, as this game has an in-game list too.. so i don't know *it shows my friends online when they're off.  all i got tho.
---
On xbox you can block them.
---
Question, why did Bethesda give the Canvas bags to influencers and youtubers but not the people who paid for them?
---
A fookin pencil?!
---
It keeps telling me I’ve levelled up and to go to adv mode but I haven’t..
---
I have a similar system and I'm having issues as well. I was fine in the vault at max settings, but outside its a slide show. Even after switching to low settings I was stuttering so bad I couldn't play. I don't think our old DDR3 systems and HDD drives can handle newer games, simple as that. I'm upgrading to a whole new setup built around the new Ryzen 3000 series CPU next month, I'll try the game again after that.
---
I did. I potentially saved a bunch of people from reading your whiny post. Nobody cares friend, go play another game and don't tell the whole world that you're doing so. Buh bye.
---
Qapla’!
---
Is that what you do irl?!!🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
---
oh nice i wonder how much the win boost is...
---
Get off the survival server.
---
You disagree. Fair enough? I stand by my posts. I'm not the only one thinking and saying it, or else OP would be me, wouldn't they?
---
Same. For a while I forgot about the base game. I was running around my CAMP in adventure like COME AND GET ME and then realized the server had like 3 people on it because everyone was in NW. What fun game mode. No thanks Fortnite or Blackout or PuBG. Playing this type of game mode in a world I'm familiar with on the character I spent time working on and earning rewards for the game outside of it is a blast.
---
Same as this one, people were crying before it came out.
---
Also - definitely confirmed that the +250 DR while reloading bug exists.  Instigating and Bloody weapons do NOT function normally if you reload, unless you are crouched.  To get back the legendary prefix, you have to swap weapons, and swap back. This started around April or so.
---
Also, damage on shotguns is interesting - as it is a flurry of shot, so numbers don't show for the total, but instead each "pellet" of shot.
---
In adventure everywhere except claimed workshops are no PvP zones.
---
I like talking about builds. Just because I think I know what I’m doing don’t mean this old dog can’t learn a new trick.
---
started at two....played a handful (5-7ish) games and when i went back to adventure i was at 6?
---
I dropped one not too long ago. It took me about 50 rounds but I did it!
---
Fallout 76 and Fallout New Vegas are 2 very different types of games.
---
remember that this is a Sneak Peak.. not even a beta just a sneak peak.
---
I'm sure they will adjust the Xp rewards when the mode fully launches
---
This looks very cool!!
---
The only one being toxic is you. Go watch some more JoJo.
---
And unfriend and block the level 5
---
I think we'll get more time and more to explore as things go along. Bethesda likes to release content just fast enough to keep your attention. If they drop it all at once people get overwhelmed and two weeks later they're bored.
---
I call that a rage quit lmao. Make a new character?
---
Double check passive mode to make sure it’s on. I found after the patch it was turned off on me. With passive mod on, there is no way players can kill you unless contesting a workshop or previously hostile (not having passive mode on and firing at someone). 
---
Slap damage is null now too if passive mode is on. 
---
For the lvl 5 friend, if they are piggy backing with that friend just unfriend him.
---
I think the reason the forest was the first area chosen is because there are not a lot of interiors and it would've been easier for bethesda to put the supply crates inside buildings which dont require you to load into.
---
from the looks of it, there was 1 more person alive. it showed 5 people alive and there were 4 people on your team.
---
I played a few rounds last night and I earnestly hope this isn't the finished product. I'm not a massive BR fan, but at this point, if i wanted a BR experience...I'd fire up something else.
---
I'm sad I payed full price lol...
---
None actually
---
It looks like both circles are set on the same point. I wonder if it was caused by firing two nukes on the same location. (Idk if that's possible, I've only fired a single nuke so far.)
---
I’m playing on Casual
---
Farm White Springs.  Take all the junk Legendary and sell for scrip.  Use scrip to buy 2 star weapons or 3 star armor.  Get a decent roll and sell for 3-6k.  Get a nice roll and sell for 25k.  
---
Now you got caps.
---
Yeah if the OP is on survival then passive mode means nothing.
---
This is why i don't get the hate.
---
Everyone should be super exited that a br mode was added to the game as that will surely bring a lot of new players.
---
Like do people not realize that like you said more money = better and more content 
---
Less money = cut content
---
Even if you don't like br you should be happy as that probably makes future content possible
---
THANK you for the answer. THANK YOU
---
The engine had major performance issues with FO4 on PS4 whenever there was a lot of smoke or mist in a given location, like inside the Corvega factory. It's not doing that anymore in FO76, even in hilariously misty places like the Mire, or when there are a ton of robobrains on screen with every one of them cloaking behind a cloud of smoke. Performance now suffers most when there are just too many enemies and/or players at the same location, and too many explosion / lightning effects to render simultaneously. Even then, it's not game-breakingly bad for me, but maybe I just have low expectations as a console player. ;-)
---
 Bro, you're bitching when you quit the BETA because of bugs? That's the whole fucking point of a BETA.
---
Poor soul, It must be Painful.Btw, if you experienced One bug, you don't have to quit It and complain on reddit
---
Lots and lots of duping...
---
That's who it's designed for. Read the lore on a wiki if it's gonna keep you up at night. They're not just gonna *give* you unlocks because you don't really like the gamemode and aren't gonna bother. Are you 12?
---
"People are entitled." FTFY.
---
Im sorry but I'm surprised this has positive karma because like someone else said, they're two different teams and also it literally just translates to "Why aren't they making MY content instead."
---
I’m not sure that you understand what the word « rage » means.
---
And maybe some other time, but I’m not wasting another 20min. To have a chance at a character that works.
---
Bro thats the one with 999 men in it
---
Go to the Atom shop and select from your purchases.
---
Yup, played a couple matches where 2 people weren't talking but it went really smooth because they were listening and communicated with emotes.
---
It really only requires one person to talk, if even one talks others can use emotes etc but if no one talks its a shitshow
---
Man was on last night and at one point I was the ONLY non level 1-3 on lol.
---
Same, but I do think it’s a nice variety for the normal mode, it works, it’s simple, not very long, and does a lot right, even if basic. Plus it still feels like fallout. Just needs some things like exit to lobby and more maps.
---
Go into the atomic shop and press A or X or whatever it is on PC and click on it.
---
It really is fantastic. I tend to hate BR modes, but this is fresh and exciting.
---
Also, this was a great read.
---
I am almost sure they work on XB1, not the lowest tier but the two stims that heal over time didn't seem to be affected. 
---
I will admit I wasn't paying enough attention to know if the fast healing worked correctly but they didn't just stop completely. 
---
Maybe only the fast healing aspect is negate upon hit? 
---
I'm gonna have to turn the box back on lol
---
I don’t know... I don’t play any Battle Royal. I think they want to differentiate themselves from PUBG and Fortnight but I’m sure all there will be updates and changes based on player feedback. Right now the only thing I’d like changed is the wait time between games.  I’m terrible at this so I’d prefer not to wait 4 minutes so I can die within 2 in the actual game. 
---
Great lobby though!
---
Thanks! The timing is good since I was going to buy atoms for the blackbird paints.
---
Heh, I made a quick and dirty x6 multiplier for incoming and outgoing damage instead. Feels great now, everyone can p.much oneshot everyone else and combat feels dangerous even with a shit tier .38 pistol.
---
I dont like the fact that it uses the SPECIAL for your survival mode character,makes me feel like if i want the best NW perks,i have to respec a bunch of points or make a new character and lvl them,just for NW
---
ive found too many levers...
---
This is what it was. Thank you! By the gods that was frustrating. Now they’re all just chilling around my house and throwing random shit on my floors. I also blocked the level 5 so he should no longer be able to follow me.
---
You can just deploy a camp anywhere on the map. It seems real easy. I just hope they don't make stupid things such as "take a picture of the final two teams in nuclear winter mode while all are naked" or something like that.
---
Isn’t that vault 68? If not, fml 😂😂😂
---
So fallout is not ment to be a fallout game? Lol.
---
The difference here is that fallout is a franchise, fortnite is not
---
Bethesda has a reason to continue the traditional stuff as there is a huge fanbase but epic had no reason to continue as it was just not something people played.
---
68 has the women. Bro.
---
I’ve seen the prime fissure take three nukes and the regular size circles overlap. Never seen anything like this.
---
I don't think I should trust this :D But I could be wrong
---
Not so neat if you aren't good at that style of game and end up getting bumped early every game...you don't end up with much experience so have to grind through the BR over and over again to just read the lore?
---
Now I haven't played it yet myself, I don't expect to do great as I'm not very good at that style of jumping around PVP deathmatch kind of gaming but I can imagine other players being in the same boat.
---
I'll agree with you on Survival, but after playing several different play styles and weapon specs on Adventure, I think Adventure is good where it is (though I haven't done pistols yet, but it's definitely calling me).
---
I've been saying no legendaries in Survival since day one.
---
Did you check if it actually is all nuke zone? If so that's pretty fkn rad. The nuke zone would disappear before you could clear it all
---
Which is only a small portion of the game. I stand by what I said! ;)
---
I love using beavy weapons in this event. Im not heavy in survival or regular mode
---
Yeah man have fun waiting in line
---
Same reason we allow mods in survival, because it ain't that serious and there is no "competition"
---
You cant lose in survival, but if you die in nw you lose
---
I'm on PC is it separate like Destiny 2 or are we all in together? I'm going to see about this pacifist mode thingy. Thank you
---
Casual? Do you mean adventure mode?
---
If you are, then something does not add up. In adventure mode no one can repeatedly attack you and kill you if you don't fight back. If you have pacifist on, your attacks don't do damage, and if you're being attacked, no one can damage you if you don't "accept: via attacking them.
---
So either you have pacifist turned off and one of two things happened, they baited you and you took the bait with pacifist off and are now getting attacked... or you did something to set them off, and they are after you.
---
Your story does not add up.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Link to said video below from Jim Sterling that was released yesturday
---
[https://youtu.be/ghdOSTAda1w](https://youtu.be/ghdOSTAda1w)
---
Yes.  Finally a use for all the pipboy games I’ve collected.
---
Ya same issue, I live in a rural area so my connection and it's speed suck, No BR for Me. Not too worried as I don't care for PVP but I agree that the desolate under populated world's I've been ending up in past couple days are pretty depressing feeling.
---
Covers at least 10 nukes worth
---
That's good to hear thx
---
Yea true. The statue is really cool. I’m hoping the other colors are soon. I can only see up to rank 22 and it looks like something nice will come soon after.
---
I never once said that I quit the BETA. I put a lot of time in during the beta and after launch but eventually got bored dealing with bugs so I stopped playing until now. Try not to make assumptions next time.
---
Thank you good sir
---
When you cheat you never really win
---
you're right im mostly happy too, they're just constantly pushing atoms and selling FO4 cosmetics for 3 dollars. Free only because it was fucked before and no one would pay 60 dollars for it after all they heard. Free because they want money, free because more players means more atoms bought for FO4 cosmetics.
---
I get it, they're a company, they have to make money. But how many things are in the atom store that should have just been in the game? Its just Bethesda jumping on every wagon they can. While i still love them, i feel like i need to bitch about the bad  stuff. I still have complete faith that they will not mess up their next single player RPGs, like Elder scrolls 6 and fallout 5
---
I want a match of like 12 people on the Whitesprings resort and all the doors are open. You have to extra careful not to shoot the staff.
---
Glad that solved it. Camp damage is also null unless you are hostile. It’s that or turrets can’t be destroyed unless owner is hostile not sure. 
---
All I know that only way to get into pvp now in Adventure mode is workshops and hope soon that will be removed too. Haven’t touched a workshop in a long time because I don’t want it to be stolen.
---
Yeah, I imagine we would have seen this before if it wasn't new, but maybe they added this as a new mechanic/bug. If it's a new mechanic, it's lack of appearance in the patch notes is... Interesting to say the least. OP, does the larger circle encompass a large nuke zone or is it only on the map?
---
Wow. Def reminds of that glitch/hack/cheat whatever you wanna call it. Is this on PC?
---
Yeah might just be you. I've been down and my last teammate got killed and I instantly died.
---
Yeah. I still can't believe the level jumps between some of the Lore stuff. One computer was level 11 and the next 86. Like damn Becky that better be a banging ass diary.
---
I had a few higher level players do friendly emotes at me. This guy was attacking me &amp; other people too
---
I think I might have been there - ran into Sutton to investigate a commotion, ran out of Sutton followed by gunfire and nuclear explosions
---
Yes. NVIDIA control panel fix mentioned above + fullscreen + mid settings and I have 144fps. 2080 Ti does not provide stable 144  on ultra in this technological masterpiece and gun play still sucks for pvp. Otherwise good concept for BR w perk cards.
---
I'm not an expert on graphics or chipset drivers, forgive me. If it was the Nvidia driver or chipset drivers, wouldn't the problem be more widespread? Or could it be restricted to just Fallout 76?
---
I'll have to boot back off the Windows 7 drive and check CPU-Z for the chipset drivers, but I believe I had the proper ones installed from ASUS.
---
The graphics driver was updated at least 3 times since installing FO76, with the "clean install" option selected, but I guess there could have been residual junk left over.
---
Yea I know. I got level 10 thinking I’ll get some dope backstory or lore. Holotape is level 95. Rip.
---
Hi! Thanks for the report. What's the actual error message you're receiving? Is it "Unknown Server" or something else?
---
Appreciate the info, it's nice to get the lie of the land so to speak :)
---
Find some plastic, rubber and glass and start crafting those Marine Tactical Helmets. They sel for around 30 caps a piece at the vendors.
---
I wish mobas was still the biggest thing, I'd love to somehow have a fallout moba Looll
---
PC yes
---
\^THIS
---
It takes a while to load the area.
---
In the context it made a ton of sense. People were saying there were other things that was a priority to them namely bug fixes. I'm glad they made BR but I'm also glad everyone has let Beth know we really want stability in the games foundation, no pun intended
---
Yeah I definitely agree the wait time is the worst part of the experience. It'd be nice to just immediately go back to a game queue after a match.
---
It's...really hard without perk load out manager.
---
That and I took UHD Map for the granted. Stock map is uggo.
---
At least we can be thankful that the Wounding effect doesn't roll at all, that's one that would rip even the hardest enemies to shreds in seconds.
---
But I do think the issue comes from not having legendaries, but rather having multiple legendary effects on a single weapon. If it was restricted to one, that could probably hold things in check a bit more.
---
Is it? I had 3 chems going at once today. They just don't last that long.
---
I'd put money on it he is/was shooting back. Don't shoot back, no problems.
---
Must be a bug. I'm gonna try to delete and reinstall while I'm at work tonight. Hopefully that fixes it. Still should be a quit button though.
---
Just block the level 5
---
Try to make your post clearer lol. Either way, you gave up without really trying. Your opinion isn't worth much.
---
Or Andromeda, NMS, etc. Just the latest in a long line of games released far too early.
---
The wildly over enthusiastic crowd are as bad as the "haters" they deride. Yes, they'll admit there were some minor issues but nothing worthy of the vitriol those bad people said about their friend who made this game!
---
That's what I honestly don't understand... loving specific work of a game company is one thing. But blindly loving everything they release no matter how broken is such a weird facet of fanboyism. This personal investment in not only the related IP(s) but the unwavering need to validated on their choice. "I was right all along! See it is a great game!"
---
I have mostly enjoyed my playtime... but that's in spite of the mountain of bugs. And I absolutely refuse to cheer for Bethesda making the game just playable. There's still an entire mountain range of issues that need attention, and that's ignoring the decades old engine it's running on top of.
---
I replied to another comment, my pacifist was turned off for some reason
---
I could have swore I read in one of the "Inside the Vault's" or similar posting that they said it was being pushed back to a later release time.
---
People like how it's altered pvp, not whole game. Imagine fighting SBQ without a single legendary item, almost impossible.
---
"intermediate step to dying" ROFL :D
---
I'm level 9 right now and for at least two or three levels I've had an actual stash box unlocked in Camp building mode. I think it came around level five
---
Word. Yeah idk but it kinda reminds me of some of the PC framerate exploits. Freakin' nuts. I'm still watching your vid; def something fishy goin' on with that guy. I hope Bethesda get a hold of this vid and fix that soon. Good thing NW's in "sneak peek" right now.
---
Fuck that.
---
Join the club man.  Still fun as hell though, no?
---
Haha you’re so angry! Don’t let a little Reddit comment rile you up. It’s ok buddy
---
It's pretty damn blatant he uses an aimbot and either the teleporting is a byproduct of it or a separate hack itself.
---
Submit a report + that video here: https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10/?prod=1129&amp;cat=28
---
Thanks god this isnt fortnite with building bullcrap XD
---
Oh I stand corrected. Haven't had any high level card yet, plus my stats are fairly balanced.
---
You're in the wrong sub then,  bud.
---
When the Purveyor came out, they said that it would be a few weeks until display cases that would allow you to decorate with junk would be implemented. It's been around 6 weeks now? This has gotten delayed 3 times now...
---
Thanks! I had a couple of other great games last night that were really immersive and/or hilarious.  I leveled up at least once in Adventure Mode and still didn't go back to it yet. 
---
Is it just me or does it feel incredibly polished for "Pre-Beta"?
---
You're right this game is perfect. They should've left all the bugs in this game. And no one should complain. Just play through it.
---
I'm sorry but that is no mindset to improve a game.
---
My goal now is specific builds. I like having weapons for white springs and westek so I get ghoul slayer and mutant slayer specifics.
---
Not all that much. Probably a few hundred.
---
It could possibly also be considering my level which is into the 100+ range.
---
I think it was the hypocrisy in your argument that hit nerves
---
I spawned in one round, couldn't find any weapon saw guy with a shotgun, flanked around and beat him to death before he even knew what was going on. Granted it was pure luck on my part because the guy was just not paying attention but still. Fist death!
---
I've never really engaged in trading and I mean...I never really looked into all those early. All my legendaries are from Murghmur currently
---
I have a buddy that that quit a few months ago because of the bugs and crashes. I convinced him to come back yesterday to try out the BR (because I suck at them and he’s good).  Within the first 5 minutes, his game froze and he had to restart. 
---
BUT! He logged back in and we played for 4 hours without another issue. And it was fun!  He stuck it out because of some positive reviews of the mode from some streamers he follows and ended up having a good time.
---
lol, it can be kind of fun :D
---
I was wearing the vault boy head last night (aka the look im right here hat) and was hiding in a bush, a whole team walked right past me somehow, I was totally dumbfounded
---
what weapon do you use
---
Good idea. Thank you.
---
On pc you should be using the number keys, just use the wheel to know what order the favorites are in.
---
What if they changed legendary effects so they are equipped like mods rather than a random Diablo like effect?
---
I'm gonna be honest.i think the Radium rifle is solid. I've had major success using it and Gatling gun
---
One thing that needs to be sorted out in NW is the return from scopes on hunting rifles, it still has that terrible delay that affects the outcome in PVP
---
On PC, I always lose my team each time after the match, and my team always has to reform to get me back in. I am not using any mods or .ini changes. I get tons of different errors. I get:
---
"Unknown error"
---
"Unable to find team"
---
"Unable to find character"
---
"We've lost your Friends list, if the problem persists..."
---
etc.
---
Unfortunately the game never saved a screenshot when I try to take one when this happens, so I can't give the errors more specifically.
---
Dude even better. Now we can play adventure in peace. The confrontational people have plenty of platforms.
---
Well, point out where I'm being hypocritical, and I will attempt to improve in the future. That's really all I can promise to do about it.
---
15 year vet... I can't see myself buying the next expansion. I'm done.
---
Same thing happened to me last night! The outer ring is completely fine, no nuke atmosphere or rads, and as far as I could tell the inner ring was the same (didn’t go in)
---
Thank you! 👍
---
Also I'm just spit balling here I've never even played a BR game until yesterday lol. If there's a mechanic close to what I'm thinking though I think 76 could stand to be a bit closer to them. Just no dancing plz.
---
One of the most overpowered weapons which is pretty easy to find is the Gatling gun. I am running a melee build but that thing shreds up to max range in only a few shots. That thing alone carried me to a victory way too many times.
---
Turn passive on, block all of them, because unless you are set to offline, they can join you even if they aren't friends, and once you've done all that, if they come back, and happen to be using explosive weapons, do what I like to call "the hug" I used to use this when slap was still a thing, and players would try to spam explosive shotties to push through it. Stay in their face the entire time. They will either A: Stop shooting, or B:Kill themselves on explosive damage while you sit unharmed in passive.
---
I'm a huge FO fan. 76 was the first one I didn't buy due to everything that was going on. However, I want to apologize for not standing by this awesome community. I tried it out for the first time this morning and boy was I wrong. The game is simply stunning on my 2070 and it's much more immersive than I was expecting since it doesn't have any NPCs. 
---
TLDR: I was wrong. The game is amazing :)
---
Even if I was trying to trick you or something, it doesn't really mean anything. The real advice is to not be afraid to die. You have nothing to lose if you do except some garbage you found lying around. Believe me, there are plenty more desk fans sitting around to loot.
---
I did a lot of testing with my FE Handmade last night, and results were the same across the board, enemy armor affects the damage, but not the stack up or max effect of Furious. I even unequipped Demolition Expert, Tank Killer, and Rifleman  to test on SuperMutants, and Ghouls to prevent killing them too quickly, and the results were still +20% per shot with a max of 80%
---
GT: ShiningAnimus
---
I'll be on tomorrow and the weekend nights. Plan on running BR for the sole purpose of adventure exp on my low level character.
---
I may play a few rounds tonight drop your GT and if I see ya I'll send you a message
---
In the early levels, one of them is an icon,  the other is a mini Vault Tec crate that you can build at your camp. I've put a few in mine &amp; they look awesome :) 
---
I'm going to assume that we'll be able to unlock the yellow and orange (medium &amp; large) crates as well.
---
Keyword: Game, do you honestly consider NW a full game, in and of itself? Then treat it like the minigame it is.
---
How'd they manage to hack so quickly? Game only came out yesterday.
---
The idea is to continuously encircle the target while using the Stealthboys, or attack from the left. At least on console, works like a charm.
---
Honestly i love fallout 76 its just the best, its just what i wanted i like the idea of just experiencing the world of fallout in this way 
---
I will always play fallout no matter what anyone says 
---
I will support Bethesda always ignoring the public opinion
---
They can ask, but if others don't speak a common language or have mic/voice volume on it won't help.
---
Next time try adding something to the conversation. Thank you.
---
The game came out late last year...much much earlier if you consider that the whole thing is based on FO4 code.  NW is just a trimmed down version of the game.
---
😊 Yes, still fun, very addictive.
---
Did you check the "chat" volume bar? "Voice" is for like holotapes and such, not other players. I have to turn my chat volume up every day.
---
You can actually flag trick pvp if someone has aoe mutations like e charged, PW, or unstable, and unless they fixed it, reactive plates on PA would do it as well regardless of passive.
---
I use the one violent night event to farm caps, meds, stimpacks, and legendaries. If you stop the music after the second wendigo scream, you have a 25 minute supply of ghouls, many with crowns that will drop tons of chems. I've had a single charred feral drop 6 stimpacks, others drop 2x of 3 different mixed chems. I just sell all the chems I dont need and make a healthy profit, as long as someone doesnt come and try to rush the event.
---
This would defeat the purpose of having multiple characters. People have fun starting over from nothing, which is why every online game ever made that has multiple characters works this way.
---
Hes clearly not testing in NW
---
There is one spot in the video you can see his bullets shooting sideways like he has an aim bot.  When he instant shoots at the guy on the roof before he can see him.
---
Yeah angry isn't the word. Confused why people feel the need to ask why I post an opinion as they are posting thiers. Hence the moron, I call them like I see them.
---
I just won't loot if I don't need it. But dropping stuff also works if they can see it. Language is a barrier in Europe, not so much in America.
---
Guy in my team said he seen this stuff in Survival mode before so my guess is they have been in the game.   It just was not a competitive mode like Battle Royal.
---
Think of it this way. OP was giving the game a second chance to finally prove itself. It took him literally 5 second of gameplay to get bugged enough to crash the game and delete the character he just made. If you can find that big of a bug in the first 5 seconds of playing, why would you give the rest of the game a chance now? I dont call that rage quit, i call that confirming you dont want to deal with the game and moving on.
---
Agreed, mostly they're just good for emergency repairs. Like if your Queen - killer explodes mid SBQ, that kind of thing.
---
A big screen in the atrium?
---
Dont judge me xd
---
yep they both are.
---
THANK YOU
---
It gives away my position all the time.
---
/u/UnbrokenCorvid
---
My team made it to almost the end on one last night, we got wiped by a team of 4, then 1 guy beat all 4 and the SB by himself. It was amazing to watch
---
A planned PR move to give people what should of been already in game that was already in every other Fallout game since day 1 NPCs.
---
That is a good practise, but if they don't see it, it won't help.
---
I think it's coincidental. I think in applying this patch or it's detection method they broke mods ability to work, not that they went screw em all we can break em again!
---
As far as I can tell all the mod others are working to get them up &amp; running &amp; I believe they will.
---
That may be it! I'll check once I get home. Thank you very much
---
First time playing a Bethesda game eh?
---
&gt;I haven't even played the new Nuclear Winter mode yet
---
Testing in Adventure mode.
---
No worries. I didn't think about it till I logged on today.
---
I totally agree with that. If no one "wants this" why were BR games such a hit?
---
Apex ttk really really depends. I've been completely melted in a second on that game.
---
Bruh, [spoilers](/spoilers).
---
I'll skip the wall of text thing and just say: love is a strong word.
---
Are we sure that's not just really bad lag?!?
---
Sorry I didn't mean the game, just NW. You'd think they'd have some anti cheat checks on there already.
---
I still own the game. Just debating whether to play it again or not.
---
I know this is going to sound nuts, but NW.
---
I got 3k yesterday.
---
Behind the Flatwoods R Rocket, I keep picking up nuke codes and briefcases on a pretty good basis from either the Lazy Mega Sloth, or around the shipwreck just a bit towards Charleston (southwest?)  8 games earlier this morning produced 2 cases and 4 codes. Plus, no one ever wants to spawn there so you can grab them early on.
---
on the other hand with the free week.. you can forget about easy pickins @ flatwoods.. lol
---
Are you talking about the article from The Onion on the front page? Because, uh, that's sarcasm and a faux-news source... so if you feel the title of that post is genuine I got some bad news for ya.
---
Yes, and most of people here saying that this game mode is glorious only made 5 games of it. I bet a majority will be bored to death at 20 at start rqing on killed at 30. Yet, i don't like this gamemode but i will probably ending doing at least 100 games of it just to be sure i dislike it.
---
Messaged my gt
---
Launch at whitesprings.. Rip half of the servers CAMP setups
---
Do you have pictures of the stuff you can get? I'm truly awful at BR games so I am curious to see what will never be obtainable for me haha
---
&gt; If they wanted to block mods in any way other mode 
---
I'm not following this...
---
In any case they stopped mods loading at startup, so many UI mods are broken. Following keys are no longer functional for loading mods:
---
sResourceArchiveMisc       
---
sResourceStartUpArchiveList
---
The map is waaaaayyyy too big for that unless they eliminate the AP cost for sprinting.
---
If it’s not like the rest of the game why did they release it? Last I looked I brought the game for more of the Fallout I love, not an ‘eh’ BR mode that isn’t even that enjoyable yet people are blindly wanking over
---
Do you usually need more than six bullets to kill someone or no?
---
Ehh kinda like how it is now, gives incentive to improve detective skills but it will change..
---
This is pre beta, before match making becomes solid and maluble
---
teammate did this last night. ended up the last one left alive.. and he was AFK.
---
FFS! even someone not playing does better than me at nuclear winter lol
---
Someone get the link.
---
Sadly not. I have all the memories of the same terminal bug in Fallout 4.
---
Google for me! At least you said please.
---
Watoga would be insane. All those buildings to hide in? A sniper’s dream.
---
Yes, let’s do this.
---
Whats left of the community is nothing but fan boys, check back when game was before with posts hitting 30k likes and now we lucky to hit 3k
---
Thanks for your replies guys, I’ve decided to give it a go!
---
From what I've read, it's the PVP they're enjoying, so shouldn't it be survival mode thay loses the legendaries, according to your train of thought?
---
Get use to this question for the next week haha. Then it will die down again
---
I like the Ghoul idea... that'd be fun and another way to play. You die and become a monster and get Scorched levels. :D
---
NW is new, but it's just a piece of the same old software.  If you can hack FO4, you can probably hack FO76 and NW.
---
There are probably a few things in to prevent cheating (they disallowed mods in that mode), but I suspect that the level of anti-cheating programming in here is fairly small.  It's not really a competitive game, so I doubt a whole lot of time was spent fortifying things.
---
Read the patch notes man... there’s a lot of stuff.  Or use the search bar.  Not trying to be salty but this gets asked about twice a day
---
People who cheat don't cheat to be rewarded. the ones who do it in video games do it for the lulz and to make people mad. That's how little satisfaction they get out of life, they have to take satisfaction from others
---
I don’t know how to go back to previous rewards but up to level 22.
---
From what I remember is
---
2 camp crates, the small and medium nuclear winter ones, blue power armor paint, overseer chair, pistol paint, rifle paint, icons, and a camera art. 
---
So nothing really missed.
---
I'm pretty sure that's just a free item they put with the update doesn't require you to play the new mode for it...
---
A minimap with a hide option for when I'd rather have the screen space. It'd help keep your bearings while in the safe zone and make you more deadly when you hack a terminal to show enemy positions. 
---
That last one may be why they don't add it though.
---
Hopefully soon!
---
This is currently a preview. Don’t know if there will Elbe a rank reset when it goes live but following how they didn’t do resets for BETA I doubt it.
---
I'll have to do that. I've been wanting to pick up a SSD for my wife, so when I get that I'll drop a quick Windows 7 install on it and test before I install it in her PC.
---
The Windows 7 install was from January of 2018, when I upgraded my motherboard and converted the OS Disk to a SSD. I have my Windows 7 Ultimate install DVD, so when I change hardware I like to format the drive and reinstall the OS. All the Windows Update KB's are archived on a separate disk so it makes it easy to patch it back up to SP1 and reconnect to the Windows Update servers for the rest.
---
Dirty registry is a possibility, but I can't fathom why it would be specific to FO76.
---
I've seen other posts here on Reddit and around the net of Win7 users experiencing similar issues. But as people have wandered away from the game I'm not seeing them much anymore.
---
Thanks for reading though! I'll update when I try the fresh Win7 install.
---
i had power armor, a bone club, some psychotats and even was lucky and got twisted muscles from a rad barrel..
---
the next fekker i found.. well.. i don't think he laughed asmuch as i did.
---
Yeah also the creatures in Fallout are more interesting and varied. I personally found the zombies in Fortnite kind of fun because it constantly gave you something to do, but it did get old quick.
---
Can you set what key to use somehow without the menu?
---
Im not much of a Battle Royal fan but I think it works in FO76 because its already a scrounge for supplies game to begin with. It fits the theme of the game and game play already. I have been surprised how fun it has been.
---
This game is really going in the right direction :)
---
You should try the BR if you haven’t already. It’s also very fun. You get a good amount of caps and a good amount of xp for your character on adventure mode.
---
You can play with multiple characters. 1 is for reaching that level with that character (you'll get that challenge with each new character)
---
The other is for reaching that level in NW for the first time.
---
Overseer rank is specific to each character you have, not account.
---
I haven't done any testing on my Shotgun yet, maybe tonight.
---
I have a primed TSE .50 Cal and a Primed Zealot's Explosive LMG that I use for SBQ battles, I know they are both very affective weapons, but I'm looking forward to seeing just how much damage they actually do, as well as testing the Anti-Armor Perks.
---
We were all wrong.
---
Ya I just stay on eastern side of mountains mostly, pretty clear and ripe for picking.
---
I agree. I don't have the reflexes anymore to keep up with my son in Fortnite (two attempts made me realize I needed to stick with non BR games), but NW is just different enough that I can survive a bit longer.
---
Deathmatches are something I have been pining for, there's a lot of areas in-game that'd be perfect like Wavy Willards, Palace of the Winding Path, Watoga and like you said Whitesprings. More diverse environments than most pure-shooters offer!
---
The larger circle is the same size as the play area in Nuclear Winter.
---
10 is brand new. Othdrs are modifided.
---
You can not bring NW cards to adventure.
---
Here is a video I just uploaded of someone cheating
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bze9xl/i_uploaded_a_video_of_someone_cheating_in_battle/
---
Don't snort acid. It will brainbomb you.
---
Look it up yourself.
---
I made a thread about suggesting varying size nukes at launch! It got downvoted by haters though lol. Would be neat to see bigger nukes though! The current ones are really small and easy to avoid. You would think if a nuke if off anywhere in the area it would impact a huge area. Even if the outer circle is just a radiation storm or something.
---
As an added tip: you can kill the creature then take a picture too.
---
Sometimes the Camera hs issues when you take pictures across cover and or tree-branches. had to take a full film of the transportbot in morgantown flying over the treetops. hint: the name of the critter you take a picture of has to show in the top right corner
---
Let me clarify as this was confusing to me as well at first.  1.  What you build SHOULD stay every time you log back in.  HOWEVER it can be bugged out or another player built at that location which might cause it to be destroyed.  2.  Building blueprints is done by hold R I think then you select everything you want to blueprint.  There is a limit on what each BP can store.  But you can make multiple to fit them all back together.
---
Despite you calling me a moron I’m going to explain to you why this post and all your comments are getting Downvoted and everyone telling you “bye” and “who cares” are getting upvoted. This is because I’m going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you’re a little slow.
---
&gt;I’m confused why people feel the need to ask why I post an opinion 
---
You didn’t post an opinion. You posted  complaining that BR isn’t what you thought it would be and you are not going to play anymore. That is not a personal opinion on the game or the way it’s structured, that is a salty little whine which amounts to nothing more than “I’m taking my ball and going home because I don’t like this game.”
---
I'm a mod author, and unless I can get the game to load my mod, it's not going to be up and running again.
---
The patch notes are all public but from Wild Appalachia, it doesn’t take too long to read the patches.
---
Mine looks kinda like that but there’s not a whole lot you can do in that aspect.
---
The mode is played like a team but each individual places themselves.
---
Yes, yes it is.
---
Now WTF are you on about anyway?  You're either assuming some advanced level of omnipotence in this sub, or your troll work needs a whole lot of work.
---
Whilst I think it's a cool idea they'd have to increase the player count to at least 100, if not more. Then the servers would start to tank...
---
I'm level 54 and they're sending me all be my lonesome to the Glass Cavern near the fissure sites in the bog. I'm thinking of just turning in my BoS ID card and heading over to the Enclave.
---
Go to recently met in fiends list?
---
I agree, though I do have some serious questions and possible concerns with Wastlelanders. Will the new content create a forced Faction Wars thing? A potentially unwanted PvPvE in Adventure Mode? Will it be a completely separate game mode for those who want to try something else?
---
Again, after all that, I agree! Fallout 76 is going in the direction I wanted from the start! I'm okay waiting for it.
---
After the sneak peak, when is Nuclear Winter supposed to go live? Having a blast with this mode which I didn’t think I would.
---
Just so you can edit the top at lvl 13 you get the shark skin for the 10mm pistol and at 14 you get a player icons that's a pocket watch
---
&gt; Don't like it? Don't play. 
---
You do realise that Bethesda would heartily disagree with that sentiment, right? The entire point of releasing a free trial along with a taster of Nuclear Winter, with promise of Wastelanders/Fallout 5-lite on the way if you buy, is that they are casting a wide net and trying to catch PvPers, casual gamers AND the lost Fallout core fanbase. If any one of those groups decides they don't like it and choose not to buy that is one less copy sold. Not to say you can please everyone. Not at all. It's just amusing to see consumers saying this while some marketing guy cringes somewhere.
---
Thanks - I just don't know where to find someone with that knowledge ha ha
---
You get cosmetic items like a Vault 51 suit from playing NW.
---
When is that suppose to come out? Im more excited for the single player to be fixed and add NPCs and quest than I am for the BR thing going on now.
---
It's not a mod, it's basically editing unseen settings within a config file, you're just changing the color of the UI, mods are more like the perk save mod that actually require you to drag files into the Fallout 76 folder in order for the mod to run, while this is just editing a text file that's already in the folder.
---
Usefull? Nothing. Cosmetics? A few.
---
Like Overseer Rank 6, stash skin.
---
That doesn’t really answer my question but interesting
---
You say most but you have to remember that most people that didn’t like the overall concept or bad execution of 76 isn’t even around to give a damn.
---
It’s a battle royale. The random new fans that are playing for free are having a good time. To blanket that as ‘most everyone’ seems a bit too pandering to me. Might as well also say ‘iF yOu dOnT lIKe it dOnT pLaY’ for some extra upvotes because god knows that’s a solid response.
---
Could be a double edged sword though. Any time you're in a menu screen you're risking someone getting the jump on you.
---
I mean not to sound rude or anything but that's quite a stupid reason to stop playing a game, I would just create  another character, and try to play the game again. The bug you ran into probably won't happen again I have never heard of it. You should give it another try man, I bet you would enjoy it, there are not any other bugs like it once you start playing and getting into the game.
---
This is when we grind! I’ve already got two runs at Whitespring in and one West Tek run. 
---
Thinking about launching a nuke tonight...
---
I’m also on PS4.  I agree with everything you said.  I really enjoyed my first experiences but these would be some nice tweaks.  
---
My buddy and I were also just talking about different maps.  Hopefully they bring that out when the full version is released.  The forest was a great place to start because of the diversity in terrain and cover options.  I think the more would lend itself well to this gameplay as well
---
If by camp items u mean structures, yes but u have to find these things called Kits. I’ve only found one: Quick Wall. Enemies like creatures do have red diamonds but other players don’t. This what I’ve noticed from my first 5 games
---
Where is this terminal at?? 😅
---
Posting that I do or don't like something is not an opinion apperently lol. You are a bright one, I posted legitimate criticism of the game as well, that many fans including ones I frequently talk to in game wanted npcs and I was confused why a second pvp mode was coming out. You clearly read the original post.
---
You still have a few days to decide if you like what you see so far :) you can also look at the roadmap and see if you would like the future content.
---
Yeah... my feeling is that "unlimiting" *anything* in this game makes it all pointless.
---
I mean it would be better if it was full map compatible but the same size circles just in random locations. 1 game in the mire, 1 game down in nightmare bog, 1 in the forest etc. I'm hoping its planned already and we just have the single central location for testing purposes.
---
Matches last 20 minutes tops due to the ring of fire. Add a couple minutes to queue into a lobby and pick a drop zone, and you're looking at 25 minutes max per round if you make it to the end.
---
In Survival? If you die it you lose a ton of aid. Not a bug.
---
I just started playing the new mode and I saw that you can pick up like plans to build so I guess the build mode is not the same and I saw enemies are red diamonds but it doesn't show where other players are
---
that's basically how they do it with the arena war DLC for GTA Online. If you get destroyed in certain game modes, you're stuck in a lobby where you can watch your team mates, socialize, or get drunk or what ever.
---
Truthfully that is my fear that these games focus to much on multiplayer. BRING BACK THE STORY DRIVEN FUN OF FO1, FO2, FO3, FONV
---
Oh, the really problem will be simply buying it outright without giving the trial the time allowed! I will happy throw money at a game I can play for over 200 hours!
---
Good review, I also largely do not care for Free for all/Battle Royale, but this one is compelling.
---
Uhh I've NEVER duped, thanks.
---
I can see that.
---
I'm currently stuck in the squad players gamemode. how do I play by myself?
---
5 comments and not 1 doing what I asked, guessing this games still shit then
---
Funny that Bethesda keeps flipping on what they said, recent real reason why stash limit is to make this a Survival Game, or no NPCs will be in Fallout 76 and next major update going to be with NPCs, I hope they flip on making this game a survival game and instead make it a fallout game.
---
I was very lucky this morning and had 3 teams that had mics and communicated. We stuck together the whole game and won each time. A fourth time no one used their mic and we died in under a min. It was still more fun than I thought I would have in a fallout battle royale.
---
Yea there really is too much, you would have to read up.
---
It's the exact same inventory but adds even more crap all around it
---
FIRESTORM by Earth Crisis comes on and you all die being forced to watch eco terrorist drivel.
---
I haven’t progressed very far as an overseer but I was wondering if a more evenly balanced SPECIAL character would be better for this.  My main runs with 1 strength, 1 endurance.  So far it hasn’t been an issue but as I unlock more perk cards I feel like a more balanced character will lend itself to this mode
---
Yep. Just yesterday, a group of friends were talking about this game and the new updates coming and one of them says, "yeah well the game still is terrible and it sucks."
---
I had to remind him (and the others) that he doesn't own it and has never played it.
---
Can you send a link or something
---
How is that shotgun?  I am a shotgun kinda guy myself so just curious, thanks.
---
This might be it, I only play survival for the weapons, didn't know this as have been killed a few times
---
It really does. Have they said when they’re going to remove it? I feel like they could just leave it in as is, and it would be fine.     
---
I don’t think I found a single bug the whole time, and I played for a good two hours.
---
Ah, like a tiny net.
---
Done, thanks!
---
Nuclear Winter shits all over Survival Mode PVP. I was so hyped for PVP in Survival Mode until I realized it was a bunch of one-shotting fools who spent a shitload of time grinding for those god weapons. Nuclear Winter shows how good Fallout PVP can be if none of those god tier weapons were around.
---
Did you have a question or something?
---
I believe you can only have upto 7 perks or, 7 points to use. Test a few different ones. See what works for you.
---
I'm not sure they're neccessarily "longer", it's just that a lot of the casual people here aren't super skilled at twitch shooters. The weapons seem reasonably balanced and kill at appropriate rates. Last night I downed someone with 2 headshots from a combat sniper rifle, and in another match I found a gatling gun that took someone out with a 3-5 second "spray and pray" that mostly connected with his body.
---
Seriously. Did the lessons from the 60's not reach you people?!
---
It's not even close to borderline, they provide a convenience that is insignificant in almost any situation. At best, it's a crutch for people who are horrendously unprepared for the game.
---
Legendary weapons should just be cool little buffs, not the be all end all of the game... builds shouldn't be completely dependent on legendary weapons, they should just be something cool to add on. It's sad to me that once you hit past level 50 all non legendary items are basically worthless. It's not a good economy that the rng items are the "fun" builds to strategize around. Obviously the fact that no one uses regular items should tell Bethesda that they need to be reworked... look at overwatch, Blizzard works their butts off to make sure every character is useful. Every weapon type or armor type should be useful and have its own good reasons for people to build around it, rather than just hoping for unyielding and bloodied to make an engaging and exciting build.
---
There was a reason and still is. There should be 0 items in the atomic shop that effect gameplay, no matter how little it is or how pointless every finds them
---
You say that now, until it becomes the shitshow of public headsetting that is any FPS. I stopped using it entirely unless playing with friends.
---
I randomly found one at the center of the map, just randomly guessed the password on my first try
---
In just hoping for maybe a lone wolf type of situation. I made it pretty far but without a team got slayedddd
---
You cant have a healthy pvp community which is something Bethesda wants by adding all the pvp modes, with horrible performance.  How many games do I need to lose cuz of frame drops till i just quit completely. Not too mention how many times I died cuz I had less than 10 fps at whitesprings trying to fight a ghoul army.
---
Agreed.  My biggest hangup with fortnite is you have to be an 8-d chessmaster to compete.  
---
Or maybe I'm just an old dude?
---
They are actually super weak. And have some very great weapons on them. I've only killed 2. The first time by my self in a panic because it cornered me. Second time my whole team unloaded on it. Both times it was dead in seconds.
---
So messed up they also walking back on making this game with no NPCs but thank god they adding them in because thats literally one of the core things that makes Fallout a Fallout game.
---
Once engaged players seem to get the red dot, but it'll go away if they hunker down it seems. Saw plenty of players with them over their head last night on PC
---
i tried building a wall once in my first match, after that i’ve never even touched the kits you find around the map. i think it’s a lot more fun that way, when you can just focus on combat
---
The rewards are camp items.
---
Yep, same here. I think it's live for a couple of weeks, or a month? Hopefully they don't charge for it or something and this is just a teaser...
---
This is why you dont have friends. Consider a new path and maybe you wont be so alone.
---
 Yes communication helps a ton!
---
Haha that's all I used survival mode for. Go sleep in a bed for that extra xp boost and head to the Burrows to kill all of the ghouls inside.
---
I gotta know though... if anyone out there that does this is willing to grow a set and tell me...
---
...what's the point? How is it fun to win when it has nothing to with your own skill? How is it fun at all?
---
Same here. Has to be a bug. :/
---
Have you tried it out yet? It's really refreshed my excitement about the game. I was getting back into it with the recent updates already and this just made it even better.
---
Reminds me of the good ole days when everyone wasn't lvl90+
---
I have actually run out of stuff to give to low levels! That hasn't happened in a long time!
---
I like West Tek and The Burrows.
---
#legend
---
Thanks that’s good to know:) I usually get shot so fast I don’t even notice😂
---
Stuck on several of these, also. If they never fix it, I guess I will eventually discover them again with an alt. Maybe it will count the second time.
---
Besides the map issue, there's a very similar issue with learning cooking recipes. I've learned tons, but the challenge only counted about 25 of them.
---
Nope. It has an Atom symbol next to it just like the overseers chair. It's earned only through NW
---
I understand not wanting to play a BR-only game, but as a game mode, there's nothing wrong with it being added to a game. People outside of 76, who hate anything that isn't F:NV, who think 76 has turned into a BR are being fucking stupid. It's just an extra game mode and it's fun. How terrible.
---
do you have any way of explaining this? I'd love to see your examples of them 'giving up'
---
I'll wait patiently for you to never reply again.
---
You sound like a Pistons fan. Stop.
---
Yes! Come back
---
Do you think we’ll keep our Overseer Rank?
---
Also, I’m only rank 3, at the moment, are there any unique rewards or anything really interesting for ranking up? Besides access to more of the Vault.
---
Remember this is a "beta" and I'm sure they will add more maps. So far the new mode was well received so I'm hoping they will put more effort into it
---
You can keep insulting me, it doesn’t bother me being insulted by someone like you. There is a difference between an opinion such as “This game sucks I’m quitting” and “these are the issues I see with BR mode, the changes I wish they would implement, and the issues currently keeping me from enjoying this mode” 
---
Despite you claiming you did, you actually gave 0 legitimate criticism of the BR mode. All you did in your post was complain that you don’t like it, and that you want the NPCS DLC now not later, but now. You sound like a child and You KNOW that you sound like a child because you yourself edited this post and removed the part where you were announcing to everyone that you’re leaving the game and not coming back until wastelanders drops.
---
Yeah because those of us that paid for an Adventure game seeing massive amounts of resources devoted to non-Adventure game crap aren't allowed to voice our displeasure about it.   I don't mind you or other people enjoying Battle Royale.  I despise Bethesda devoting so much energy into even making it when fundamental parts of the Adventure have been screwed up for 7 months.   When they have a decent handle on fixing issues in a timely manner THEN and only then should they be adding stuff to the game that was outside of the original broad scope of the game.   Remember, many of us bought and paid for it based on what they described up front.  At the VERY least that stuff ought to work well before they pivot away from that.
---
Nobodies don't what your asking because your to damn stupid to scroll through Reddit and read comments on posts that are asking the same damn thing you are only twenty minutes prior.
---
I was dropping bags with water, food, pipe pistol, ammo, stims and 1 nuka shine for noobs.
---
Left a couple at the vault door, in the overseers stash and handed some out personally. 
---
Random Acts of Kindness
---
&gt; Can you build your own camp items in game? If so, how do you enter build mode? My build mode button doesn't work. 
---
Same way you do in adventure mode.
---
&gt; How do you spot enemies?? I see enemies sometimes with red diamonds or triangles above them. Is this automatic or do you have to press a button to spot them? 
---
NPC enemies always have the red markers. Players will only have red markers if you reveal them using a computer terminal. Otherwise, you have to spot them by eye.
---
There’s two ways to build. 
---
1. From the quick wheel, you can select the various structure kits you find and just put them down. 
---
2. From the Pip Boy, you can choose to place your CAMP, then build as you normally would. There are no turrets or traps in the build menu, those are found kits only. 
---
If you’re going to place CAMPs in NW, the best thing to do is make a few small buildings in Adventure Mode and save the blueprints. Then you can just pop them right down and move quickly.
---
Is see it now thanks. You for now can build it in other people’s camps.
---
u/L3gacy77
---
Woah there..what you said has nothing to do with my point. My point was just that some of the best things ever created were originally "things nobody asked for." No one was clamoring for a Guardians of the Galaxy movie and look at that franchise now. 
---
I get the frustration about bugs. But it's not like they aren't in the process of fixing those too. If you want to argue that they should be allocating more resources to that then new game modes, thats a legitimate argument. Unfortunately though, Bethesda has done enough research to see that a new game mode (plus the free-to-play week) will bring in more new people than will leave if a few bugs last for an extra week or two. And as long as they keep adding new content for adventure mode, I'm personally ok with them creating a sandbox for the BR kids
---
For the record, I'm bad at BR games and don't have much interest in them (I'm a quadriplegic and FPS games are often difficult for me to play). This mode seems like a fun enough twist on it that I'll give it a try on occasion when a friend wants to play, but I'll mostly stay in adventure.
---
I came back yesterday and I admit I'm having a lot of fun.
---
The character you created for the battle royal is only for that game mode. If you're new you have to create one for PVP and PVE
---
Yes and no... some perks have a higher requirement.  They might all be maxed cards. For instance, I unlocked bodyguards and it’s a rank 3 perk.  If I only have 1 charisma I can’t equip it.
---
In pve it’s not an issue because I know I’m only going to use rifles.  In BR I might not see one for the match and have to rely on heavy guns.
---
Random FYI, you can equip multiple perk cards in the same special as long as your character has enough points to cover the cost. I currently have two perception perks on.
---
I wish it were just solo
---
You could say he got "boned" lol. Nice.
---
Im rank 12, and every reward so far has been icons
---
I think you misunderstand. I'm not talking use the whole map. I'm talking using the same amount of space as currently used, but having random circle spawn points.
---
We wear the vault 51 outfits. The 1st inhabitants are dead from what I have read. Now we are just fighting for overseer
---
Everyone is doing it, come on man.
---
SB dies in like 3 shots. It’s not the adventure mode enemy.
---
I’m smart enough to know that your grammar is literally terrible
---
You would need to play it to answer this for yourself.
---
Cool.
---
Lol I started at 2, played 1 and didn't level up. 
---
Played a bunch more and yeah now I leveled.
---
Nobody on this planet has to justify anything to anybody you or me or most others. And what may seem ridiculous to you may not be to them. 
---
It's cool to be curious about stuff but when you start saying things like "people need to be able to back up these ridiculous ideas" that's beyond curiosity. You're now demanding things. Telling people how they should be. That's not your place. That's not my place. And just to be frank with you, I really enjoy NW too despite not liking Fortnite and I don't know why. I just do. And that's good enough.
---
No, I'm not. It's clearly sarcastic and it's The Onion. I'm talking about the posts on the front page saying Nuclear Winter is fun and Fallout 76 isn't that bad.
---
Seems low for a win, since with adventure 1000exp is two whitesprings sentry bots and an assaultron, I would've expected more
---
Scattered around the world. Makes a beeping noise.
---
I redownloaded it yesterday and notice some definite improvements. I stopped playing a few weeks after release and plan on playing quite a bit now that it's been updated.
---
They already explained that you can't use mods in NW to make sure that no one has an advantage starting out
---
Some costumes give a competitive advantage. Better camo. 
---
Just because it’s “cosmetic” doesn’t mean it doesn’t give an advantage. I know I’m just nitpicking at the smallest thing, but my point still stands.
---
If people want to spend their shitty money on things that give them 5 extra hits on an enemy.
---
Is there a way to keep teams together once the game ends? I had one team that really clicked and we joined each others team but once the game ended we could still talk to each other but were put in separate lobbys.
---
Same here, but I only played one game. Went back and played 2 more and I leveled up. It takes a few games, or maybe not dying so fast.
---
👍 autocorrect dummy
---
You are forgiven, son.
---
&gt;5 comments and not 1 doing what I asked, guessing this games still shit then
---
Sorry massah, I'll get right on it massah!
---
It's not the subreddit's job or responsibility to spoon feed an entire 6 months of patches and updates to you because you're either too lazy or too stupid to go on bethesda's website and read through the roadmap, the patch notes, and the inside the vaults. Make a little god damned effort, it doesn't take much to find what you need.
---
Killed a team with a powerfist.
---
Thanks dad
---
Two squads of 12 starting at either end of the Burrows!
---
Don't feel bad. You used a tool provided to you to win. Good on you mate!
---
I just want my Fusion Core Generator skins already, tired of looking at that ugly thing.
---
I want the Utility Coveralls from FO4 that Sturges used to wear. Not that popular, right? I just hope they release them eventually
---
I would agree with you if every article, video or tiny piece of news outside of this subreddit(and even sometimes in here) didn't get flooded with people complaining about everything that's added that is different from standard Fallout. They apparently still give a damn enough to bitch about it whenever they can. There's plenty to criticize 76 for, but some people just don't want it to exist period and can't stop themselves from claiming it's the worst thing ever made at any opportunity.
---
Hiw dont you know 
---
Have you ever seen fortnite pubg or apex ledgends
---
&gt;tell me that is reasonably achievable by someone with only a passing/casual interest in PvP in anthing resembling a *reasonable timeframe* then I'll concede I'm just a hater. 
---
Not every thing in the game has to be for every player. If I'm playing final fantasy 14, and I don't enjoy playing crafting jobs, I don't get to experience those jobs' lore/story.
---
You're mad because there is story locked behind content that you don't like. Either do the content, and unlock the rewards (which includes the story), or don't, and just watch a YouTube video in a few months once other people have done it.
---
What I meant is...The stuff we get here are usable in Adventure mode. While in OW you're just...stuck.
---
It is two day old though. We are still in the honey moon period.
---
I really don't count the bullets when I'm firing them.
---
I would use the search for the sub and type "patch notes" that way you can look at the dates and start reading from when you stopped.
---
I just went into Adventure mode for the first time today and now it appears I received a large portion or all the XP i gained from NW.
---
You should probably go into hiding.
---
I’m just asking the important things in the title but then again, you probably can’t even read
---
This was my thought until i read his comment "5 comments and not 1 doing what i asked, guess the game's still shit then"
---
So i had to do it....
---
It’s my first bloodied build. I’m trying to figure out my perk cards beforehand so I don’t waste any points. So many good perks, so few points.
---
you are supposed to choose option 4)- hide until the other 2 players are forced to engage the SB then attack said players while they are distracted
---
I do however understand the SB can melt you pretty fast if it spawns on top of you
---
if you dont mind spoilers all the holotape and terminal transcripts are the the vault wiki
---
&gt; Stanislaus Braun
---
Ow, that nasty psychopath.
---
They took it, then followed me wherever I went and killed me until I left the server.
---
I got one from a hackable loot terminal inside the Red Rocket in Flatwoods.
---
Spawn a bit south of Red Rocket in Flatwoods, in the middle of that plain. Numerous crates, especially near the shipwreck. Use ranged weapon to take out the Mega Sloth living behind the community garden.  You should be good to go with plenty of loot!
---
That is the dead giveaway, the more subtle proof is the huuuuge difference in their incredible snap aiming movements and staying focused on the target while moving without deviating. Not saying god tier FPS players couldn't do this, but god tier FPS players would have consistent snapping mouse movements to scan their environment as well while navigating about the map in natural, smooth, mouse movements. This person doesn't do that at all for scanning, likely because they would be using an ESP (or wallhack) in addition to the aimbot.
---
It's been a long ass time since I've moderated FPS multiplayer games back when Day of Defeat was a thing, but aimbotting hasn't changed a bit since the early 2000s.
---
Well, my character (the one from vault 76) has as of right now zero connection to vault 51.
---
It appears as of right now to be totally disconnected from the actual adventure mode as it is.
---
Yes? No? What does our opinion matter? Go form your own opinion and try it out.
---
Alright I’ll try that out, Thanks btw
---
This is basically what I'm saying, but instead of forcing each game to be tied to a single zone, it's instead able to encompass multiple zones. Same size fight circle as we currently have though.
---
Na I'm 25 and got the same issue hahaha,
---
Is this like fresh out of the Vault hazing? I like it!
---
What is TTK?
---
Once again, you're a lazy ass who is apparently incapable of using google.
---
This. Are you over 50 in adventure mode by any chance?
---
Huh that's interesting! Had something completely different on my head...
---
Yea Fallout 76 is better then Fallout 4, mainly cuz things actually get fixed. Lever Action Rifle bug still in Fallout 4 and it was patched in 76 earlier this year.
---
Great, another addon that will be half baked, full of quest breaking bugs, and not only will there be all the left over issues from the main adventure game they've still failed to address after all this time, but there will now be all the new issues with the poorly built add-ons that should have been completed with a FULL development team, not half a development team on Adventure and half a team on this new Battle Royale B.S.    If they could actually deliver things that were well tested and worked well, then I would have no problem with them delivering these things in parallel.   However, when flora doesn't properly convert to radiated flux in nuke zones 7, STILL, 7 months after release... you can tell that the most basic and fundamental quality control simply isn't being done on this game.    You, me, and everyone else are the QCers for this game, we aren't being paid for it, and we are actively being ignored when we report issues unless you get hundreds of people reporting the same thing all at once.  This QC is being done by what ever issue is getting the most noise and there are things from day 1 of this game that are still broken.
---
So, just because a trailer promises you the world, doesn't mean for a second that I believe Bethesda will deliver.   The ONLY thing going in their favor right now is this small Scouts thing they added seems to work pretty well.  Of course even THAT has to have a caveat that it only works pretty well by comparison to some of the other MAJOR fumbles that Bugthesda has had over the months.  There are still challenges within the Scout Badges that cannot be completed weeks after it was originally added because nothing seems to count as an Alien...including the Alien corpse, Alien picture, or the f-ing Flatwoods Monster which IS an alien.
---
I was just interested to hear what people thought
---
Are the cosmetic unlocks account or character based?
---
Bushes, trees, rocks.
---
Yeah, 179 :)
---
Then use the search bar. This question is asked literally a thousand times a day in this sub (hence the cynicism)
---
I had the same problem yesterday, and a few months ago. So its not that new.   According to the FAQ if you totally log out of the game and then log back in it should fix itself.  it did that with mine.
---
You're probably right. I normally run fireproof. Really IMO it is the behavior that needs fixing. It fixates ob a single target or team way too hard.
---
thnx for the tip..but for some reason i cant play br..i get server disconnect 99% of the time as soon as i load in..out of about 20 times over a 14hr period i got in to play once...😢
---
Thanks I needed the laugh.
---
I didn’t mean to annoy you
---
Did just about the same thing. 
---
Guy gets to the crate before me while we’re both still invisible and pulls an auto assault rifle on me. I just started running circles around him to stay out of his line of fire, furiously trying to land as many punches as I can. 
---
We ended up downing each other at the same time though. It felt epic but probably looked pathetic 😂
---
Same. I avoid owning workshops for that same reason. I get that is pvp ground and all that but sometimes people do it just for the fun of it which I don't find fun at all. People have their sick builds and all suck in survival so they come back to adventure just to mess with people that want to enjoy the game
---
it sorts the items into categories so its easier to find what you need, like stimpacks at the top so youre not scrolling down to look for them
---
It's fun, I guess, but it's still lacking the polish of something like Apex Legends or the gimmicky draw of something like Fortnite. I don't think the Fallout branding is strong enough that its aesthetic will sell people on this, especially as its attached to a game that was universally panned at launch. The main problems are...
---
* There's no drop-in mechanic. You just load in. This means people with faster PCs or even internet connections load into the game and start looting before you.
---
* The UI needs some work. In particular, loading the map takes way too long and shouldn't obscure the entirety of your screen; there's no way of telling if someone is standing right next to you whilst looking at your map.
---
* There seems to be some minor framerate drops when looking at the nuclear storm on console. Nothing major, but it's still something which could be improved.
---
* Inventory management is diabolical. It's bad in regular adventure mode too, but batle royale is faster-paced so it's even more noticeable.
---
The internet isn’t as good as the minds of irl players but all of you kind of proved that theory wrong
---
Thanks for the report! After looking into this, it sounds like a visual issue that can happen when you join an Adventure mode world after playing Nuclear Winter. So, the nuke zone is still normal size, it just looks huge on the map! If you log out and return to Adventure mode nuke zones should appear normal on the map again.
---
We're looking into a fix for this with a future update.
---
You're missing the most essential mod ie. perk loadout manager and while I don't use it myself the game badly needs text chat as well.
---
I kept fondong myself saying "shit no vats!"
---
Haha don’t be sorry, that’s awesome! Right after I got killed during one of my matches yesterday, a delayed message appeared on the top left of the screen that said “you have mutated into a full chameleon” or something like that and I was like GD nooooo 😅
---
Nothing to feel bad about.
---
text chat and perk loadouts
---
What are legendaries? I am new to the game, here for the trial. And if they really make pvp boring, why are there no modes or servers without legendaries? Also, I just started playing, should I play on survival or normal mode? I like pvp in games like these, played Conan Exiles pvp a lot.
---
Legendaries in survival need to go
---
But then how will we leave doggy bags of spoiled waste in your C.A.M.P.?
---
Does this sub allow pictures?
---
Character based it appears.
---
&gt; It creates an entirely separate system for how to acquire items that actually matter...
---
I think this is well written, and you have a lot of good points. But it is important to point out that the game is balanced so that you really don’t need these perfect rolled weapons to do well. 
---
I’ve been using a 1* anti-armor shotgun I got super early on for my entire playthrough, and I haven’t just done ok... the game has been a cakewalk. Even a non legendary shotgun would be super strong, basically all due to the enforcer perk. I don’t think it’s necessarily fair to say those guns “don’t matter”. They’re great.
---
That being said, I’m nitpicking. Legendaries *are* the end game progression, even if getting a perfect roll isn’t strictly necessary. But it’s definitely important for players to realize that nobody *needs* a bloodied build.
---
My gun knows how hurt I am!
---
It now knows how high I am!
---
yeah... I am not a fan.
---
Hmmm maybe should have tried that too.
---
Good on ya'! Thats a risky play regardless.
---
You are right it is earned on NW but I'm not sure at what level, I might have to check my progression screenshots for actual info not just speculation...
---
My first/best guess is a routing problem at your ISP.  Maybe some port is being blocked and causing these issues.  If possible, if you have access to your router/switch/modem go into the settings and look for an option called DMZ.  Youre going to need to put your computers IP address (or MAC it should say) into the field.  This will put your computer outside of the firewall of the router/modem.  You can then test to see if that resolves the issue.  If not its an ISP level issue more than likely and will require a call.
---
Time to kill.
---
yes, you take it from the owner. As long as there is water left for me, i have no problem to share my water with strangers passing by.
---
No, my door is always unlocked. I locked some of my water purifiers.
---
I’m lazy lol, your the one sticking up for a video game. I looked through your other posts and it’s just fallout. I’m sorry but if I’m lazy you really have to step up your game big man
---
I'm also rank 3, so not sure. I've read that you get access to stuff in Adventure mode including recipes and plans, which is pretty awesome. I'm not sure if we'll keep the rank.
---
I definitely agree with you on this. Only issue is with the hub it will take time and power that they could be using to better the current stat of the game. I would like this too, but unfortunately people will just turn you over to adventure mode as that's the only other way to mess around and stuff.
---
I got ya, and I agree.  My only concern is the Toxic Valley.  That place is like 80% flatlands with random farm houses, it would be cool if they did an update on the terrain to make it less...geographically barren feeling.
---
IDK either, but I'd guess the result of any (damage/detection formula) that uses the value of that particular special is increased.
---
Thank you for the confirmation. And by the way, I’m absolutely loving nuclear winter! It’s the most fun I’ve had in any Battle Royale game. Tell the devs to keep doing what they’re doing!
---
Yes, you earn xp and caps that transfer to adventure mode.
---
There is advantages to playing the mode. Perk cards make huge differences. Last night I unlocked 40% more dmg and excellent accuracy with pistols. A higher nw player will have access to pretty sizable advantages
---
Yep. Made me laugh aswell
---
If anything it should give your base vats accuracy a little boost if it’s not already maxed.
---
While that is fun, I’ll take this. Or just automatically switch the size of the bag based on what’s in it. But seriously, I’d rather see it better.
---
https://m.imgur.com/zJpwJJn
---
Yep, I have an Furious Handmade that burns through scorchbeasts.
---
Yes, just have to use imgur to link.
---
First ever Reddit post so... I think so?
---
If you wanted accuracy, there wouldn't be a storm. Just radiation. But  then that's no different than just actually increasing the blast zone.
---
It's been rare that people don't respond for me. I think 1 game in like 20 so far has been no voice response at all. And it's honestly been really great talking to people, and I say that as a complete introvert that avoids people usually. Met some cool people, played some great matches, and have a lot of new friends on my list now.
---
Bethesda support told me months ago it was cause of ultracite ammo I got from a buddy of mine (like 90k... I never even had a use for that much😂)
---
The other thing was Nuka quantums, I picked up a bag someone left for me and they had “pranked” me so when I hit collect all I got a shitload of them.  Ended up dumping them in a river where I though no one could find them after a 15 minute walk at a snails pace.
---
Kinda really pissed I’m still banned months after they said it was all only temporary... I mean hell they don’t even have many items to remove from my account I got rid of them weeks before I was banned!
---
Nothing to be sorry about! You used something that was meant to be in the game and it helped you win, that's fine! If it makes you feel any better, my teammates and I killed a team yesterday who all either were using stealthboys or had that mutation and were just crouched in a corner near Flatwoods shooting at people who walked by 😂
---
It would be incredibly easy now that everything is in place simply drop the circle somewhere on the map add loot box spawns and boom brand new map
---
What 10k? You sure on that number as it feels like you rounding up since we barely can hit 3k likes on posts on this reddit compared to the 30k+ likes we had back during beta.
---
Another lonely MF
---
Took me like 7 min to actually start a game, only played one but was pretty fun
---
Debateable fallout geiser
---
Yeah, I'm not positive what level either. I wanna say level 5 though.. Lmk if you find it.
---
Not sure if you mean like changing the order itself, you do have to change that in the favorite menu, but it automatically sorts weapons depending on the order you pick them up.
---
Wastelanders is an update to the main mode - aka adventure mode - and I imagine those features will also translate into survival mode as that's just adventure mode but with added challenges.
---
Agreed. Not in to PVP.
---
It's a two barrel gun but range seems short so I traded it for scrip, I'm not a shotty fan and even sell all shotty ammo for free as I see it as a waste when people who need it can have it free of charge.  This does mean I go through a lot in free sales.  But you gotta help where ever you can.
---
Ok so for example, my strength is maxed out at 15. I have armor and perk cards to make that more, ex radicool or nerd rage. That will make the max go up, but only for the basic stats that it gives. Like max hp or durability on items. So when I'm at low health my strength goes from 15 to 23. Each special stat does different things. If u have 5 charisma and have an armor peice that's adds one, it'll show a plus next to that stat in your pip boy. With that one extra stat that will allow you to share lvl 2 perk cards. Idk if any if this makes sense but essentially that's what is going on.
---
Uh... IDK about that man. I think the exp is based on your kills, time alive, how much you loot, enemy monsters killed, etc. I had a 10 minute match that got me 2K exp.
---
Why it’s not like it’s a pay to win item. It’s basically an audio cosmetic. You don’t have to buy it if you don’t want to
---
True
---
Now I'm thinking we need MIRVs.
---
Completely agree. I think legendary items in regular mode would be ok. But survival should be no legendary items
---
Yeah it seems pretty flexible, would be cool if they gave the overseer some ways to shape the match in some way.
---
Everything is a feature
---
Commenting so i can track this thread. Id love to know where to get these plans too.
---
You’re not, I’m just saying honestly search for similar topics and read all those answers. There’s tons of examples within those thousands of posts. But you want a perspective from someone coming up on 1000hrs? Hell yes it’s worth getting into, and frankly if you’re not already playing and leveling up, you’ll be behind when it comes to new content being released. They’ve added so much since launch, fixed performance issues, etc. It’s still the same base game (adventure mode anyway), so if you were turned off from it initially, it may not be for you. But if you liked some aspects of it, check it out again and see what you think. 
---
The biggest downfall of 76 at launch was how easily people were swayed by another persons opinions. It took some time to really figure out what 76 was, time the early reviews weren’t given. It’s always been more than the sum of its parts and it’s up to the player to figure out what kind of roll they want to play. But to really get to the meat and potatoes of the game, individuals really have to put time into it themselves, not just be told it’s good or bad. That’s why this question annoys me personally. But yes, give it another go!
---
Making a reddit account to post to the fallout subreddit = lazy
---
Wow, TIL
---
I was also having a lot of trouble seeing the numbers in the grassy fields of the CB Bog, and other well lit areas, it would really help if they were a little larger &amp; Bolder
---
But for example, if I have four points assigned to strength. Then I equip a +1 strength item, I can’t add an extra perk card to strength…
---
Also, can anyone verify building a camp I'm br does not move your camp in adv?
---
Tesla, mini, auto g, best option.
---
Yep. It's still a buggy mess.   
---
On the upside, some of the more common bugs have been cleaned up and the servers a much more stable now.   
---
Nowhere NEAR what they should be for a game of this size, or by a studio this big, but...well...better then they were at launch.  
---
The main thing though is that the gameplay. Yeah, none of that has changed. Regardless of what the fanboys are claiming, it's the same game. The same issues are still there. Carry weight, storage limits, build limits, and the game design behind weapons/crafting/modding/collecting. They're all still there.   
---
So if it was the bugs that drove you off, I'd say give it a second shot. Especially if you already own it or want to try the free week. But if it was gameplay that drove you off then nothing's changed. I'd say wait for Wastelanders to come out and try again in that case. Maybe the update really will change everything. Fingers crossed.
---
Problem was in modified custom.ini, cause i changed camera settings, i just delete these lines and GGWP
---
I had that problem with one of the weekly challenges (take a picture of robots) it wasn't counting the last one take a pic of a Vertibot, I took like 20 pictures until it counted it
---
A teammate of mine was like a ghost dr.  We won off his invisiheals.
---
From what I remember from my Counter Strike days some wont play a game if they can not cheat in it.  Its the only way they enjoy it.
---
I get the same messages as RealRelight on PC, the mode is quite fun but playing with friends is a bit annoying at the moment with having to reform the party every single time, for my friends and I at least, we usually have to close the game and open again after each match because the party always bugs, not allowing us to stay on it after the match or even making a new one after we leave.
---
Grafton Steel has a spawn point around back in the lockers. It's a nightmare server hopping. I just bought em.
---
Yes, but it still increases the stuff strength would normally increase, like carry capacity. Just like in Fallout 4 it won’t let you unlock a higher level perk, but it will give all the other benefits of being at that rank.
---
You get xp, caps, and cosmetic items.
---
I invite them to a party and instruct them to sell me anything for 100 caps
---
I put a mine down next to a downed player earlier. It was glorious lol. 2 of his team mates ran to him and that split second when the realisation sets in after they hear the mine sound. They didn't make it far lol
---
Too soon to call. Check back in a month, two months, and see what the numbers are like. What I don't like about BR is how volatile their player base is, so many dedicated BR games fizzled over nothing, so it's incredibly risky for FO76, a non-dedicated BR game, to waste development time on BR.
---
And while some people are right in saying "nobody asked is a generalization", you have to look at sheer numbers. Vast majority of gamers are not PvPers. And a good portion of PvPers don't like BR, since BR tends to reset, and thus lacks progression. In other words, BR, by default, caters to a subset of a subset, in an already niche game. And BR, unlike PvE, requires a healthy population to work well. 
---
But hey, we'll see. It could take off.
---
One of my load screen tips said you are more likely to mutate in NW.
---
Oh, my bad. I for some reason thought you said you’re rank five, sorry for the confusion.
---
That is awesome, I hope people start to realize this isn’t like every other BR.
---
Lol NV is toxic as fuck
---
Even if it’s just static news reports that are on a repeat ever few hours that are stupidly funny and don’t really benefit the player I would be alright with
---
I haven’t payed attention to the actual time, but  it compresses every 2 minutes or so.
---
Okay what time are you usually on? I’ll probably be on most of the day tbh!
---
VATS is only important because of sentinels, without legendary effects I'm okay with it being removed
---
S - Increase carry capacity by 5 and melee damage.
---
P - Increase VATS accuracy and detection.
---
E - Increase health by 5 and resistance to diseases.
---
C - Better prices when bartering, share higher level perks with your team.
---
I - Craft better weapons, armor, food, etc (except building items). Get more stuff from scrapping.
---
A - Increase Action Points by 10, and the ability to sneak.
---
L - Find more durable gear and weapons, fill your critical meter faster
---
Copy and pasted from someone else’s post
---
I agree, it’s such a huge world, let’s use it all
---
You can only equip one card per stat anyways lol
---
I mean, 3.4k karma, this looks like your main account big man
---
Chems are important, drop them before battle
---
Yeah I took several pics of then and it didn't trigger, I gave up, I was sick of wasting film
---
Make a blood sacrifice to Zax to proof you got what it takes to shed the vault 51 uniform.
---
No, you don’t understand. It’s repeatable. When you get a duplicate perk card it gives you XP. This can be farmed very easily for Overseer XP.
---
Ahh got ya. That makes a lot of sense.
---
Will we be able to get Deathclaw hides again from Deathclaws in the next patch?  We haven't been able to since Patch 9.
---
I have been hunting this stuff down for 20 levels... I've found 2 pieces... NO PLANS, aside from mods.
---
I'd love to know where to find it... but the hunt makes it that much sweeter, I guess.
---
Kill him! KILL HIM!!!
---
Well making a post on reddit only makes it 10x more exploitable lol, so now more people will do it
---
Bruh you're an idiot trying to start drama. Get back to asking people to replace the background of your shitty selfies
---
Yeah and it’s great fun. This game was a train wreck at launch and for months after I’m more than allowed to be wary.
---
Xb1
---
Definitely ultricate ammo then since I can confirm vast amounts of Nuka Cola Quantum doesn't trigger ban since few of my buddies give me 400 a day if they on so I can sell and last I checked they had over 1mil from all the duping.
---
interesting.  So how much CAMP building and scavaging actually happen?  Seems you would be basically just constantly trying to find other players to kill..  
---
Or, to hide..
---
Thanks OP!!!  Will make sure to hop on NW ASAP
---
Looks pretty solid. I would take of glowing sight and take off hacking terminal cards. I only use the hacking cards when I need it so I'll take a card off, hack the terminal, then put it back on. Glowing sights in my opinion takes up points you could use somewhere else go better your build. Like making the slugger perk cards higher to increase damage. Just take a look at your build and decide what you might be using a lot and what you won't be.
---
Mods, can we not get a thread going for NW feedback? The constant new posts on them is getting kinda ridiculous. That said, some solid feedback here. For ghouls, it'd be cool if that became a means of resurrecting teammates; every other battle royale is introducing revives after Apex Legends. Let your teammates comeback but as ghouls with reduced stats or something.
---
Everyone agrees about inventory management, the general UI, and wait times for a match. I can't see how that won't make the developers' priority list.
---
Understood. I get the risk. It’s also the best place I know possibly to get the info to the devs ASAP
---
Guaranteed this will be fixed, reverted, and people that take advantage punished. Watch your back.
---
Haven't played yet, what's overall TTK like for naked players vs those in say PA?
---
No dev is gonna see it here asap, report to bethesda. Posting it only leads to people actually exploiting. Ita a daily, itll be gone soon once it times out.
---
I think they are gating the vault 51 story until it's out of "sneak peek" at least.
---
I just created a new character, and got the same exact bug. This game is seemingly unplayable for me.
---
Mr New Vegas was Wayne Newton and I’m sure just using his voice would be a pretty penny plus the whole lore thing. But as long as it wasn’t the voice actor for Travis Lonely Miles from FO4 or anyone as sickly boringly sad as him I’ll be happy.
---
I don't use it personally but have noticed a number of people saying its broken.
---
Unfortunately you can't play across different platforms, but I'm sure you'll come across some great people to play with :)
---
The last patch broke it, they’re apparently looking to fix it in the next.
---
They need to change the clothing system and make it so that armor would be always the top layer, so you will never have an advantage because player dont know what armor you have.
---
And could bring a "mod option" for cloth into adventure and survival.
---
If they didn't release a brand new game mode at the same time I'd be heavily testing what guns did what and how perks work. I'm huge into min/maxing. But we only get 1 week of NW and this is fun.
---
Platform ??
---
Matches are about 10-15 mins and i think they are timed cause i got a thing that said stalemate and both teams got 2nd place
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Atom shop custom bags?!
---
Bet, next time I get on I will add you
---
Personally not a fan of this BR mode, just hoping they sell me an option to buy all the content that drops from BR mode.
---
Did you buy off players or in game?
---
Haha I should've scrolled. What this guy/gal said.
---
Every video I see of this game is so laggy compared to when I play lol this looks fun though.
---
You clearly died in survival lmao, know the rules of it before jumping in
---
But neither did the person who finishes them. They don none of the work. They should none of the rewards.
---
Yes if you created a foundation and built a house on top it will save the entry as a blueprint so when you move your camp next time you'll have it in the stored tab as one entry.
---
It is. Bethesda has been alerted. They will look into it.
---
The skins you unlock are character based, so if you use an alt for NW your main character won't have access to them.
---
To be honnest I might have a few 100 extra on one of my alts.
---
But in the bright side, here is an easy 3 step process to get your acid fix in each day.
---
(Really depends on play time).
---
1. Take over hemlock holes workshop. Put 3 extractors up lock them down, and put 20 level 4 turrets around it.
---
2. I usually go hunt snallygasters/bears in the toxic vally,
---
3. Do your scout things and stings daily, and farm the acid,
---
Alternative is do the campfire tales event and pray you get the bug swarm at the end.
---
The people who will answer these posts are all people that play. You will always get a yes answer.
---
I found at lower levels if you get the perk that lets you search for extra chems in containers (can’t remember the name) it gets you loads of chems
---
They made vats kick off faster upon completing a killer because people complained it took to long so now it is automatically kicking people out of vats with gun fu equipped.
---
You must be joking?
---
Where?!
---
Yes! We need to be able to dance on the graves of your enemy.
---
Not abandoned but it was all hands on deck for Battle Royale mode, lets hope we get it soon since my camp feels empty.
---
I was worried it was going to be trash... I despise battle royal... now I’m addicted... possibly one of my favorite games right now...
---
Can you use the search function or something
---
Armor plans spawn in the building with voting machines (blue glowing hand things) nearest the fast-travel point in Harpers Ferry.  It's in one of the display cases.  I hopped maybe 5 times before I got the sturdy robot legs, last thing I needed for the roboticist badge.
---
Just in case you weren't aware, DON'T pick up armor plans you don't need because then it won't spawn again when you hop.
---
Actually, it isn't but believe what you want "big man"
---
Pharma pharma.
---
I have only found one! The from inside Vault 76! :(
---
i would gift you silver if i could.
---
Definitely messed up on PC
---
Morgantown airport and hospital on edge of Ash Heap and Forest (south) put on pharma farma luck perk card. Get chemist perk card and you dilute 1 stimpack for 4 diluted stimpaks.
---
I feel you, twitter is acting like the game is still in the state it was at launch and spreading false info that just makes it worse. This game community is great though, we're above that.
---
It's not a perfect game but it's our Fallout game till Fallout 5 and the improvements are making it worth the wait.
---
Didn't bother reading them so yep it cost a bunch
---
Not much building. I drop turrets to cover my rear or flank as I progress through the circle, and maybe some walls if I want to sit in a spot for a couple minutes. I scavenge until I’m in the top ten, or I have enough ammo and stims to kill everyone on the map lol.
---
Go to market and find healing factor serum
---
Thanks compadre I'll check it out!
---
Pharma Farmer or something like that in luck, get rank 3 and you'll end up with a ton. If give your platform I'm sure someone will drop you a few also.
---
Use the chem station to make Healing Salve.  All the ingriedients are found in Flatwood.  You should have learned this 'skill' doing the Responders missions.  It will easily get you by until you find Stimpacks.
---
Also dont steal all the ammo and guns if you dont need it. Had someone on my team keep rushing to crates in front of me and the only thing i got was an expired stimpak
---
Must be something wrong with what ever console or PC your using
---
Bought the game a week after release for 40 euros. Still playing. Game was very rough at the beginning but now most of the big bugs have been addressed. Servers are much more stable and the new stuff is amazing.
---
Punished for completing a daily?  LOL
---
GTFOH
---
i imagine, after the sneak peak, with full release, you'll get paired in groups with similarily ranked oversearers.
---
The counter was wrong is what the bug was. Theres no way the circle closes that far in and we don't see the last person.
---
Unless they actually changed the mechanics with this patch, TTK should be a bit quicker if you actually land all the shots. I wouldn't trust the numbers, as that's certainly not how multi-projectile weapons worked before the patch.
---
The answer is a resounding "No" but he can call you "big man" if you'd like.
---
I've had issues grabbing items once, i.e. open a crate and no menu appears. My friends were all looting fine. So I can say this is not true.
---
Yeah, see? I just don't get the reward... it's so... empty.
---
Wow we end up on common ground after all!  I have a limited legendary proposal that could work without too many other changes and help out PvP in survival/adventure mode become a lot better...  simply limit PvP legendary to Assassin's effect only and no other offensive/defensive armor or weapon effects would do anything for PvP (including sentinel).
---
It would actually provide a reason for Assassin's weapons to actually exist (since even a Mutant's gives a better damage bonus as it stands today and its against all things), and limit the amount of damage tanking gained from legendary effects.  Only need 1* items to be on parity with other players, the rest is entirely up to your skill.
---
Bamboozled!
---
The optimist in me thinks Wastelanders became the post-launch plan during development, and that they were originally supposed to launch with the game. However, due to various difficulties, they decided to scrap human NPCs, with the plan of adding them at a later date to give them more time to iron out the issues. 
---
The realist in me thinks that Bethesda had approached the game from the outset being 100% committed to the early access/live-service model, and had laid out a long-term plan for several years worth of planned additions, and that design for the main game was set accordingly.
---
Feel proud, your the only person on this whole subreddit with a brain
---
It’s not. It’s a terminal bug that’s been at the heart of this game since Fallout 4.
---
Don't know if it's just a placebo effect yet but adventure mode feels a bit smoother for me after the latest update  too. Mind you it could be just less server strain from majority of players being in NW,  who knows.
---
hes level 15....starched genes isn't till 30
---
&gt; almost noone has +9 luck on a pve build
---
Lots of people have 9 or more luck. Between stretched genes, class freak, bloody mess, and all the other QoL perks it's one of the most important stats.
---
Nope, I must be blind lol
---
Frog legs (marsupial jumps) takes a 9 agility (I think).  Got the card, then realized my char only had an 8. Ugh.
---
they also have a spawn in the cranberry bog in one of the traincarts by the flooded train station but getting them is a nightmare i had a cool guy helping me out i server hopped a lot for two weeks was gifted them by another player and found them again two days later
---
but be aware that spawnpoint can spawn different plans and once you take plans you find the spawn will be locked for you for an amount of time dont know how long though
---
Incapacitated is not dead, though, so it is still not a "kill".  Kill=dead.  
---
Let's say it *was* changed and the person who downed the player would end up getting the credit for the kill...where is the incentive for anyone, other than the one who downed the player, to actually finish them off? If no one executes the player, then they could be revived, be right back in the game, and become an actual threat again.
---
You get XP for downs &amp; kills.
---
Correct, you cannot. But you do get the passive +1 bonus to STR abilities - Carry Weight and Melee DMG will increase. And say for instance we're talking about charisma. Again if you have a +1 it's not going to be factored into your card allowance on special screen, it will however give you the passive +1 bonus to vendor prices.
---
Make sense now? This is a question I pondered at first as well. I thought I was getting jobbed out of the extra perk point slots, but that's not how it works.
---
Give this a read:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
Mine works fine. I'd try a hard reboot to clear your cache. If that doesn't work it's probably time to invest in a SSD.
---
First aid boxes, chem boxes, craft them, player vending machines, some players might even give them free, Pharma Farma perk.
---
Some I bought off reddit. Many where given to me. Scrapping every piece I picked up in game gave me the most  What are you looking for? Full set of robot? Or just the mods?
---
I should have given you some if you on PC
---
&gt;BR mode that isn’t even that enjoyable yet people are blindly wanking over
---
I mean dude that is just your opinion?  I really do enjoy it and when it comes to opinions here you are in the minority as everyone is loving the new mode.
---
And seriously get your act together, its an optional mode and nobody is holding a gun to your head forcing you to play it.
---
Or maybe.... a canvas bag?
---
There's a whole Discord thing about the BoS (Still new to Discord, not a member of the BoS one though).
---
Somebody's bound to post a link eventually, sorry I couldn't be more help.
---
So I hear, I guess Testing will have to wait, I will be jumping into NW tonight.
---
I would just avoid using what ever terminal your experiencing the glitch on.
---
Got to agree with both of you loving the game and yes NW needs some work but not really that much. And I know two people that are getting the game just because of NW not sure how many people will but it's gotten some people.
---
because they put out a shitty broken half assed game.....  
---
maybe you dont remember that since it looks like you spend all your time trying to be edgy on the internet
---
"BETHESDA WHERE ARE THE NPC:S REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"  
---
1 year later
---
"BETHESDA YOUR CONTENT THAT ISNT OUT FOR MONTHS SUCKS AND FUCK NPC:S REEEEEEEEEE"
---
You can go and rage to r/fallout  i really aint bothered to read 10 pages of complaining about something that is not even out yet.
---
Bugs exist yeah, but lets not pretend that the game would be unplayable because it is not.
---
Ps. They fixed the alien thingy already, flatwoods monster counts
---
I'm sorry, but I like Fallout and I like 76. I also like BR as game mode and like NW. Can't we just like things?
---
dont take advice from ppl who get paid to have an "opinion"
---
Consider it a life lesson.
---
To be fair some bugs really do break the enjoyment of dlcs, for example recent dungeon they added where you protect animals I ran to on day 1 of release and attempted it 16 times and each time was a crash for just entering the dungeon but I hear. In other words its not if it doesn't work 100% its if it only works 6.25% of the time.
---
Lever action rifle and gauss rifle
---
Last one d be nice
---
Its stuff like this that does lasting damage to the game, because Bethesda won't reset progress/do wipes.  This one IMO warrants immediate maintenance, they should just disable NW until they can patch it out!
---
Been playing since January.  Subject behavior did not happen to me until the last patch (PS4)
---
There’s stim packs a lot of time in the aid boxes on the walls at the lumber mill south of Vault 76. You can also look into purchasing them, but people tend to have them overpriced so you’ll just have to see. If someone has a stim pack plan I would definitely buy that and then you can make your own by farming ticks (also at the lumber mill).
---
Not broken for me on PC using rifles.
---
Unequipping and reequipping all your perk cards will fix it, until you server hop or logout. Not a solution, just a workaround until Bethesda can fix it.
---
Yes I forgot to mention this, good point.
---
If you have blood packs I can make you some, free of charge.
---
Heard of PubG but never seen it. Never heard of Apex Legends.
---
Nice! Thanks
---
Glad to hear that! I'll pass along the kind words, thank you. :)
---
Bog in general would be a lot of fun, all those damn ditches and tunnels.  Not sure people realize how far you can go below “eye level” in the bog.
---
On top of this, remember that you have to hit the ‘search’ button over containers. Otherwise you won’t get the extra chems. You have to manually search the container
---
And if you're teammates die no need to yell "You guys fucking suck, I actually wanted to play the game but whatever. I basically carried the entire team while you guys did jack shit"
---
Yeah i agree, if they feel like it's a good aproach okay. I am just really skeptic this will save game or give any good PR. Friends of mine been laughing they try to resurect a dead game by giving it "popular" gamemode which is already beaten to a VERY BONE ... 
---
I hope this works ... But as i said and you, i think spending resources elswhere would be better way. But again i agree. Whatever the devs feels like its right to do. And no worry about downvotes. I knew i will be. I just wanted to share my opinion and i did that and had a good arguments and some good conversations out of it. I see this as an absolute win.
---
Definitely got that impression too
---
Put on the harvest perk then walk the rivers and get all of the bloodleaf. Pick any blue flowers along your way and make healing salve.
---
People didn't exploit the dupe glitch accidently...
---
It's is MORE than feasible that people could complete the daily challenge multiple times without ever noticing...
---
If you don't find someone sooner I can help you get it after work. Ign is newt341.
---
Why what they saying? Are they complaining that Fallout 4s Lever Action Rifle reload still broken despite how many years old and Fallout 76 getting it fixed a months ago?
---
It would not defeat the purpose of having multiple characters. It would remove the bullshit, worthless, zero fun aspects of having multiple characters. This is F76, not 'every other online game'.
---
Is it even in this mode? Havnt seen that card yet
---
After all this shitstorm, you seriously think they are so stupid that they would pull the development of the rest of the game and focus entirely on the br mode?
---
They maybe a little slow sometimes but they ain't idiots.
---
It's the game mode we never knew we wanted. Until *now*
---
Stuck? You earn a gold skin that’s usable in casual and other dumb modes. Same with char skins? I fail to see any difference other than your bias
---
I just ran  into this same damn guy!
---
I feel sorry for the mutes and deaf
---
Can't even watch the game on twitch or mixer because it's nothing but people who have no idea what fallout is talking about how bad the game is while playing NW. Its dumb. if u dont like it just stop?
---
I wouldn't stir up that Shit pile, a lot of people are still butt hurt over those bags, LOL
---
I did know not to pick them up. Ty for this info
---
I was going through whitesprings a little over an hour ago and I thought it was working for me on PC..
---
Ill have to go back and check...
---
Thats the tsar bomba nuke... Part of patch 10
---
^...Holy ^Shit
---
I really know what you mean. It's exactly like me - never done pvp before and if i say i'm not good then it's the nicest form to name it lol
---
But i checked it out yesterday and i've had a blast!
---
Also even if your are not that good in pvp then just try to survive as long as possible and you get the rewards by time/heal/kill AI instead.
---
I'm pretty sure that's possible to match in adventure mode and let's remember most people will only get 1 or 2 kills in BR before being killed themselves. Only the fortunate few get 10+ kills in BR.
---
Yup, i always say that. “NE at 50!”
---
It only makes sense since the main form of picture taking is the camera now, and you can't edit the images while doing so
---
Well, tbh I already came into this expecting bugs...since its  abethesda game lol.  But wasnt really thinking about the fact i cant restart,use mod or console commands to fix lol.  Other than today, its been running fine though for the past months.  I also find those gltiches funny where like ghouls ar chasing you but they're stil lying on ground.  I don't mind these types as they really dont break my gameplay,, its the ones that prevent me fom playing that bothers me.
---
I appreciate the offer. have an estimated timeframe? I do have a few things I need to do later, so I just want to make sure things line up.
---
The Whitespring would be awesome too
---
thanks :)
---
Lol. Havent had this happen yet.
---
There is no cap to increasing affect of a SPECIAL attribute, the higher it is, the more the benefit. Eg you get +5 carry weight going from strength 1 -&gt; 2 and from going from strength 18 -&gt; 19. It’s been my experience that applies to all attributes.
---
Claim Poseidon or one of the other power plant workshops. Do the event to power it up or build a generator to power the fusion core generator. Keep it defended and gather cores as they’re produced.
---
You just have to read the computers around the base and discover the hidden secrets. I think a lot of it has to do with that robot that’s leading us around everywhere
---
So is Nuclear Winter here to stay or is this a beta period and it will come back later this summer?

In Twitter-Land you are not allowed an opinion, fun and happiness is met with soul-crushing cynicism, and past mistakes are branded on your face forever.
---
Fallout 76 launched horribly but is in a much better state with A LOT to look forward to. But social media never forgets or forgives...
---
They are doing the same to The Witcher 3 now which is confirmed to be coming to Nintendo Switch. It is obviously gonna be downgraded but because of that Twitter-Land has deemed it unacceptable to be excited and happy about taking The Witcher 3 on the go.
---
Ah, guess you got crispy XD
---
better inventory is already working.  read the comment section for a fix,  as for icons someone found a working method and is waiting on the mod author to update.

---
But really if you went into a bar and shouted you love alcohol... A bunch of people would cheer.
---
I think OP is saying something I love and haven't seen enough of. I'm still pretty bitter about being accused of being a corporate shill because I enjoy the game. I don't mind reading someone else saying they like it too.
---
But I want my bag to be very hard for others to find, sometimes there is important Junk in there, and I want it back.
---
I'll try a hard reboot when I get home, the game is installed on my external SSD though.
---
It's as simple as linking up 2 doors in the creation kit, as far as having 51 in adventure mode. They wouldn't even need to change all the props in the vault. They might run into problems with the rank tracking on both modes but I'm sure there is a way around that.
---
Same i can help out on PC around 6 pm est of later
---
How to i open them? or I mean i do not even know how to change equitment at vault 51 round lobby. let alone to what i can do once i level up. i'am at 5 now.
---
Happened to me last night. Ironic part is the guy was the first person to die on the team. Also "I downed two people, I carried the team"
---
Those downed people got back up.
---
cant use mods in BR.  game wipes your ini file when you click that mode.
---
I hate battle royale modes, too. But this felt far more strategic and interesting than I expected it to.
---
The only thing I wish is stimpacks were a bit easier to come by, or that we could regen health /slowly/.
---
I'm not enjoying it myself, but I'm gonna level up in NW for the sweet sweet adventure loot during the beta, and then probably just stick to adventure again.
---
Facebook comments have got a little better still very repetitive and clearly coming from people who haven’t played since beta.  Very frustrating.
---
Me as well. I think it was the trees.
---
That was my feeling about the scouts and Arktos so close together was a bit much, beside some other issues.
---
But if they take their time and don't rush it i wouldn't mind at all.
---
There are 20+ first aid and chem kitsch if you walk from vault 76, to the overseers camp, and thru flatwoods into the agricultural center. I run thru every day, with pharma farma on, and swim in stimpacks.
---
You can also find them with varying amounts of powers within power armor spawns and wherever you find fusion generator in the world, they may not always be there because other players can take them too.
---
if you're on PS4, I can give you a few.
---
Alcohol is pretty great! 😉
---
You shot 300 shots? 😋
---
Yes good idea. 
---
Most of the time i will take a picture in game and then take a screenshot (on Xbox) and after that i will use my Xbox app on my phone to find the picture and Edit it with Pixlr or something else.. 
---
That would be cool if you could do that easier..
---
Maby it would be a super nice thing to make a fo76 app where you can do stuff like Edit your pictures, chat and have a interactiv map plus upcomming news ...
---
Because... a lot of us WERE surprised, myself included.
---
Did you put them in your stash or vendor machine?
---
I fucking love this battle royale. Fun as fuck.
---
If they made significantly more money from it, yes I absolutely believe they would.
---
They obviously wouldn't announce that they had done that, but just like with Fortnite we would see the vast majority of content being created shift from one mode to the other.
---
Again I don't think that will be the case here, but its not outlandish to consider it as a possibility based on other games.
---
Man I think I meant to post that comment in another thread about the explosive weapon glitch coming back
---
The chem perk is a lifesaver! Ba dum tiss! Also keep an eye out for the stimpak plans and the chemist perk once you get them. Both are a huge help.
---
I have a theory that with the Nuclear Winter beta and how later ranked rewards are treated I’d take a guess that’ll it’ll come out between the Nuclear Winter official release and either a mini quest or NW expansion so maybe late July or early early August
---
There are a few ways. Pharma farms perk to "search" chem containers.
---
Events. They usually give you a hand full on completion. 
---
Crafting. You can craft them if you have the  recipe or you can just craft healing salve easily as you should have it's recipe already and it's ingredients are easy to find.
---
My mutations give me negative accuracy in vats, so I'm used to aiming old fashion way. 
---
Granted it was just that one squad lol... doesn't mean i faired that well against everyone.
---
Cool! Click bait!
---
As an experiment, I tried putting all the weapons with prefixes (eg. Zealots, Mutants Slayers) that I didn't want in my stash. I keep some of because it has explosive, and sell it through my vendor. But over the next 12 rolls of 2\* weapons, I was still getting those prefixes. It didn't make any difference.
---
It probably mirrors what's in your inventory because you have a little of everything, as that's what the game gives you. If it did work that way think how easy it would be to get AA/E weapons, by giving a few of them to another character who had no other weapons. Bethesda wouldn't want that, so I can't see it working that way.
---
They are everywhere. Ash Heap has the highest concentration. You can find 4 at the Nuka Cola plant and 3 more right down the road at the rollercoaster. There's an abundance of them. You just have to learn their locations and collect as you play. Check every fusion generator. Almost every mine has some.
---
Only use power patcher when repairing, power armour takes a long time to break without it and is cheap to repair so it’s unnecessary to always have it on. Without it, it still takes at least a week for me before I need to repair my power armour. Same goes for the melee durability and luck of the draw. 
---
Although melee weapons drain durability about the same as every other weapon, most melee weapons are stupidly cheap to repair so you can save yourself 8 perk points and all you have to do is spend 15 seconds at a weapon station every once in a while. (If you find it tedious then try like rank 2 or 3 of the melee durability perk)
---
I’m also assuming you are going to be going bloodied considering you have radicool and nerd rage so I would say max level adrenaline is also not necessary, get rank 1 or 2 and put perks in other areas, with bloodied melee you will be one shotting pretty much every normal/regular/most common enemy anyways (mutants/scorched/ghouls e.t.c)
---
Doing events you usually get some.
---
my point is he's preaching to the choir. haters arent on r/fo76 because it stopped being popular to hate the game months and months ago
---
I'm sure they'd avoid a lot of kidnappings if they'd just close the front door. I think the raiders are just trying to teach them a lesson about home safety.
---
I made a Radscorpion Venom Syringer for the Scout Challenges, not sure if any are better, but it's still a worthless dart gun.
---
Yea it really is a yikes game at the moment...I’m sure they will improve it in the future
---
A Radiation King Wall lol
---
I’m glad I saw this post. I went ahead and disabled it for now rather than have a bum perk equipped!
---
You have to be friends and then join as a team outside the lobby
---
Auto grenade launcher also
---
I claimed the steel factory to get a picture and there were not trees around and it work the first time to my friend. I tried for day to get a picture of a flying one but I never got the name so it didn't count and taking a workshop with a vertibot was my last option
---
Some people claimed that everyone could see emotes as well but haven't noticed any so far.
---
I'm an OG Fallout fan and I enjoy the online and BR.
---
The BR let's me live through a Vault Tec experiment instead of being a passive observer of history.
---
The online part let's my character truly live in a destroyed world where humanity failed. 
---
It's different but it's definitely fallout.
---
IconSortingTags was indeed the first victim of Battle Royale.
---
The devs disabled - or masked? - the ability to override the startup preload so any mods that require custom fonts to be loaded are currently toast.
---
There might be a solution but is going to require a .dll and as opposed to SFE this one could be interpreted as one trying to play the game the way one likes it rather than the way one is told to, which as we know is a punishable offence.
---
With every patch my yearning for private servers intensifies.
---
I've been saying this for a while--if it's scrapped or bulked, it should weigh nothing in stash.
---
That encourages players to not carry stuff they'll get angry about losing, when they inevitably crash at an inopportune time and lose their bag.  And it encourages them to put things into a place that is accessed less often, reducing the number of operations on a bunch of records.
---
Instead, you've got folks like me who keep more on them than in their stash, because weight reduction perks and armor make it impractical--no no no, *impossible* to store a reasonable amount of stuff.
---
In effect: the tiny stash weight isn't the stash weight, so the number makes no sense.  It makes things difficult and unpleasant for no purpose.  It doesn't help game play, game economy, game enjoyment, server load, or immersion.  It's just an asshole thing to be an asshole thing.
---
&gt;our stash or vendor machine?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;If you were dropping any other am
---
I have litteraly not dropped anything? I got all my bullets when I logged out
---
The point of BR's is to rotate the players though. The end would require some sort of re-queuing.
---
haha no I had all my bullets when I logged out a few hours ago..
---
I'm not sure exactly where you're talking about, a picture uploaded to imgur and edited into the body of your post will definitely help.
---
click bait is a title that doenst actually lead to its meaning this however does so no not really.
---
Ah ok thats what we did wrong. We joined a team mid game.
---
LoL so true!
---
Go to the Bethesda announcement
---
I'm glad to hear that because I unsubbed after I couldn't stand the down vote brigade every time someone said something positive
---
ive been getting alot of lag sadly
---
Got to love those people. They are usually the kind that run out shooting and get the whole team exposed.
---
I would love to be able to explore Vault 51 in adventure mode.  I would also like to see an adventure mode story line for Vault 51, it could be along the same lines as Nuclear Winter but maybe like kill some of the toughest creatures in Appalachia to become the Overseer instead of killing other players.
---
Had another quick look and have 2 more points.
---
You definitely want action boy/girl max rank because of your power attacks, and also (once again I’m assuming you are doing bloodied melee) you won’t need solar powered because the small damage boost at a specific time won’t be worth the 3 perk points.
---
Gun Fu is broken period. Doesn't matter which mode you are in.
---
You gotta level up
---
I always picture myself carving out a shape of the person around their entire body with the machine gun that i can barely carry that is kicking back too much for me to handle, like something out of western comedy.  Then I die from their one shot kill.
---
Are they literally in your stash?
---
I think from now on every fallout game should have a BR mode added on to it. I'd like to see popular locations from all the fallout games used as BR maps. They may have to be modified though.
---
So far I have only noticed that the player icons are unlocking for me. I am at a level 6 and see that I can use the 'Crates' icons as a player marker. Not sure if new outfits and stuff start to unlock down the road.
---
He can still use it just can't take radaway. And there are a handful ways about reducing rads without radaway.
---
But saying all that it's still not the best solution. 
---
They could farm for low level legendarys that give healing out of combat. Having a full set of them around his level made leveling my alt character so much easier. But that's even hard to do on your first character.
---
You and 51 other players are within a section of the Forest surrounded by a circle of fire.  The fire periodically shrinks the playable space, forcing players to engage each other to the death.
---
You loot and scavenge just as in the normal game.  Enemy NPCs are still around as well.
---
Yea there was a lot of rebalancing with items
---
Would be nice
---
I think a lot of regular players are experiencing pvp for the first time and really enjoying it.
---
You don't need to run power patcher all the time. Power armor lasts very long. Fix it good should keep things running a long time.
---
I run a 2h melee build and don't run luck of the draw. Weapons seem to last a while. Swap in weapon artisan like you do with fix it good.
---
Try and do without traveling pharmacy for more points in slugger. You don't need that many stimpaks, radaway and rad-x. Same with blocker. I always preferred offense to defense.
---
I bet that thing wrecks. Explosives got a huge buff.
---
If I shoot someone in the face, they should die, die. No Ghoul stuff.
---
nice!!! i cant for the life of me find a scoped lever rifle!
---
I bought another game when it first came out for the PvE and  building.
---
It was called Fortnite.
---
Yeeeeah, I'm on the wrong side of history with this I guess...
---
I wonder why they named it to "expired stimpack" instead of just keeping them as "diluted"
---
translation: "no, I can't."
---
That voice inside you that feels insecure and wonders why people dont like you? Listen to it. It knows.
---
no i just checked
---
😂 I can totally picture this!!
---
Are you sure it still shows up when they are crouched?
---
Don’t forget you mutations. Things like adrenal reaction is going to massively increase your damage output.
---
cant help ya then sorry
---
But how do you get them and when do you get your first cosmetic item?
---
I enjoy fallout games so I play it
---
I agree with almost every thing you said in this comment thread.
---
I understand that, neither have I. I’m asking if I have to create a new Bethesda Account and a new Xbox account in order to play until this temp suspension is lifted?  Or can I just create a new Bethesda account and link my current Xbox account to that one?
---
The market is an underrated aspect of the game. I spend as much time trading on market76 as I do playing the game.
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature!
---
            (of survival mode)
---
This is completely true!! They just tell you what they are paid to tell you or they just jump on the hype/trendy train... it gets old.
---
I'm on PC but thanks. I was just curious, every generator I've walked up to has been empty for the most part. I found a few, but not enough to stay in power armor.
---
Because I could, I tried staying in the outer burnt zone as long as possible at the end of a match with 8 players remaining. I had 4 extra stimpacks and 2 regular. I lasted about 30 seconds.
---
Oh I figured you just wanted views or else you would just post the location. My mistake!
---
If you press quit you can open NW again and join another server. Time consuming. Especially if you are like me and are one of the first to die
---
is there a way to steal ammo in survival?
---
Why isn't under armor from the outside the atom shop not an option? I really dig my Vault 76 suit.
---
Better Inventory never broke, it just edits the strings files.
---
Do you have a source for this method of loading custom fonts?
---
Maybe, but they need to remove collision mesh.  You could build an indestructible wall of duffel now...no good.
---
How do you open the crate rewards?
---
Claim Power Plant Yards and make fully charged cores
---
There is another terminal at the water treatment plant in the south east
---
Have you googled what a nuclear winter is... cause it's a real thing and it sort of morbidly makes sense...
---
Because
---
Bugs are a part of the game, no one is saying it’s perfect. Just that you quit WAY too soon my man. Take it from someone with 950+hrs in the game, it’s a fun experience. I get kicked about 2-4 times every night I play, but that’s ok. I restart the game and it runs fine again. It’s hard to see the joys of this game without actually putting some serious time into it. But if it’s not for you, it’s not for you. Luckily, these days there are tons of alternative choices and other great games out there
---
&gt; Does the player really down a bottle of wine or whiskey in one go? I doubt it. 
---
In a post-apocalyptic world? Absolutely.
---
The point is nobody wants a minigame, we want story expansion and lore
---
Not really a loot box. It's a loot box *icon* in the atom shop that you can set as your player icon. I understand that farther down the line there's also a stash box skin that becomes available for camp building.
---
It's a stash box you automatically get
---
none of this advice is new player friendly lol.    for a more seasoned player starting a new char sure.
---
And you have to make a new character right?
---
Fully agree, it's like the pitty f*** of gaming; sure you win, but did you really, or are you just more pathetic than b4?
---
The SB in NW is super easy to kill. Just go for it next time. I think he's used to make the game go faster by "spotting" the remaining players.
---
nu·cle·ar win·ter
---
noun
---
a period of abnormal cold and darkness predicted to follow a nuclear war, caused by a layer of smoke and dust in the atmosphere blocking the sun's rays.
---
Basically a nuclear winter is the exact opposite of a normal winter.
---
I’ve seen a lot of people asking this question. Once you learn it, the icon next to the challenge reward is pretty telling.
---
Vault Boy = Icon
---
Camp Tent = Camp Item
---
Perk Card = Perk Card (sorry)
---
It’s also pretty clear in the picture during the XP recap which ones are real items and which are icons.
---
I wish we could sync up a thing where we can get a group of people to clear each silo and launch at the same time to get a result like this lol
---
Yes, it needs a pinging system to mark things and enemies
---
I enjoy the exploring and wandering round and taking in the sites. Some of the events are fun and teaming up with randomers is great fun. All imo. 
---
Also I like naming weapons something stupid and leaving them all over the map.
---
I do grind whitespings a lot, but keep doing with different weapons so it doesn't get too samey.
---
You don't use raw fertilizer?
---
Hopefully, in this century, they can come up with id software to get their gunplay for decent br w perk cards.
---
In fall :/
---
Everything is sex
---
👍 Thanks. I understand now. The last time he surprised me and I panicked ha
---
How about play the game as presented?
---
If you kill the rest, the downed players will die by themselves. Not to mention you can easily use the downed players as bait.
---
If all you do is focus on bugs, and what you sont like, you're going to have a bad time. Focus on something about the game you enjoy. If that list is very small, well, move onto a different game?
---
He fun can wear off when you get tired of being bug beat. The worst thing is Bethesda refuses to acknowledge or fix some of the worst bugs in this game. Ones that existed for months. Then they cannot release a patch without breaking something. Quality is also important and it's lacking. And I play this game so it's not an opinion from a paid commentator. Have played every fallout and other video games since 1990. My first gaming PC was A 286.
---
I actually didn't enjoy it. It has a bit of a strange arc, and I also didnt have any explosives buffing perks. I ended up switching back to my 50 cal MG. I have a perk that allows +30% reload speed for heavy weapons and +40% non-explosive heavy weapon damage, so it shreds to the point its OP.
---
Thanks!  I will look there tonight.
---
This is quite the bummer.  Bought tac ops for this
---
Maybe I'm too late, but you can edit your appearance anytime. Even outside the vault. I remember doing this back in the beta. Just rush the vault, avoiding bugs (personally never stuck in a terminal... ), get your char saved (by stepping outside) and THEN do the "real" character creation
---
That would be insane cool. I always make my camp out in the Ash Heap because I think the fire and such makes it look cool, there's a bunch to do event wise, etc. A battle royale there (or in a mine, etc.)..that would be neat.
---
Best Battle Royale so far, tense, small maps, just the right amount of players, no legendaries etc
---
I have 800 hours in adventure mode and still find things i missed in places i have been dozens of times. The new game mode is great as well. Never played a battle royal game ever, but this one is so addictive. Literally played for 4 hours last night haha.
---
I know that some inventory management mods are ok
---
how is experience calculated? Only from wins, or from kills/surviving?
---
go away. we dont want you.
---
Lol are you over encumbered?
---
The .50 cal slaps.
---
But you do get more of them cosmetics while you level your overseer level, right? Thanks for your answer!
---
Those people are the people with too much pride. They're too stubborn and just can't let go. They've double downed and don't want to call it back.
---
I 100% agree with you. Scavenging and crafting was one of the best additions to FO4 and added so many more hours of play. My favorite weapons in that game were the ones I crafted myself. I was excited to see all the new crafting options in 76 but quickly realized that crafting is a low-level man’s game. 
---
I never thought about doing thousands of points of damage until another player gave me a level 40 bloodied grog axe. I completely changed my character’s build in order to effectively use this weapon. Is it easier to hunt/grind scorchbeasts when you can kill them in 3 hits? Sure. Is it fun? Meh.
---
Thanks for the feedback! The hacking cards are there to be swapped in and out, the way its displayed isn't entirely clear. As for the glowing sights, I feel like the 60% in nuke zone runs would be better than the 15% against regular enemies, especially when most regular enemies will die in one hit already. What would you suggest I swap glowing sights with ?
---
By no pvp zones I mean you can’t even initiate it or chip their health away at all. Kinda like how it is right now in the lobbies for nuclear winter.
---
Got a deathclaw gauntlet. A teammate got a minigun.
---
I never excepted gifts because wasn't sure how much stuff was duped or if it was some sort of exploit I wasn't hip to but I def came around and have learned it's a very nice community.
---
I guess will see, but you’re right when you say things change, my mp experience teaches me that the more you play the more you see the problems, at the same time they become increasingly irritating.
---
no, I edited that into the post.
---
I was skeptical as well but it really provides a ton of useful information. Their sorting of items is great. In weapons Mines and Grenades are at the top of the list no more having to scroll to the bottom to find your plasma or pulse grenades. In Aid, Healing and food are grouped together. For junk i can tell exactly what components are in an object simply by looking at it. Plans are all group together in Notes as well, and tagged so i can instantly tell if its a recipe, building plan, weapon, armor, or mod plan.
---
Fucking Raiders respect _nothing_.
---
True :)
---
So cosmetics usable in adventure mode too, right? Well, thanks, i guess i will try to farm it for a bit.
---
So I can't mess with UI elements, change a few textures around, or mess with improving performance and getting rid of an annoying stutter issue I'm having?
---
First cosmetic item is level 5 and is a stashbox. After that idk I havent progressed that far.
---
I do know based on a screenshot at level 24 you get the trophy/statuette item for your camp and level 25 is a laser rifle skin.
---
Nope. You can use an existing character; you just lose its inventory/perk cards/mutations while you're in nuclear winter mode. All you can bring are atom shop costumes. Probably a good idea to bring an existing character, since I've seen up to three star perk cards handed out in NW and a new character couldn't equip those. That or start a new character and bounce back and forth Adventure/Nuclear Winter to level up.
---
&gt;Does the player really down a bottle of whine or whisky in one go?
---
Don’t judge me, I’ve spent the last year alone on the wasteland, I live how I want.
---
To me, whether you like a BR game depends on the theme and style of the game. I like PUBG for its pure realism, but I really hate Fortnight because it's cartoonish and highly unrealistic. Fallout BR feels more like PUBG than some other BRs.
---
signed into a different account still getting this message :(
---
and that would be the early days.  Discord working, and 3 nukes within seconds.....
---
Until the server crashed.....  I'm hoping with some of the new folks we get more nukes dropped.  I need some flux...
---
It’s really fun and the new content has been excellent. They’ve been consistently fixing bugs (not all but many) and have been good about finding exploits. It’s a great game.
---
What mods would these be? I'd like to know. I'm looking in minor alterations, not over the top and gamebreaking stuff.
---
I mostly keep to myself on twitter, basically my own little corner to talk to myself about how I feel but people on there are way too judgmental with no forgiveness.
---
Ohhh nice!   
---
Out of town so haven't been able to play the released NW yet, hoping for this weekend.
---
I'm disappointed we can't sit on the toilets. What kind of world are we living in?
---
They're just like Atomic Shop items. You can even view them in the shop.
---
Now everyone will spawn there, pass.
---
lol, it was obvious to everyone.  they still wont be to the actual quality of a Fallout game until Wastelanders.  jerk off Bethesda all you want, even the people who've been playing 76 since day one, myself included, know that it was just a low effort cash grab.
---
yes, it *IS* good that they kept working on it and improving it instead of scrapping it when it wasnt a huge success.   but they should have taken their time and actually put out a good game to begin with. 
---
if "they tried to hock garbage on us, and then spent 6 months bringing it up to launch quality" is your threshold for praise, then you really need better standards
---
Maybe ?
---
Long long maaaaaaaaaan
---
Well, in fine with cosmetics, i was worried that you would only get xp and caps, but as long as there are cosmetics its nice. Thanks for your answer!
---
With a big enough discord server, you can get similar. What we did was launched one..then a few seconds later, one right next to it.....the a few seconds later one next to that.  Biggest nuke zone you can get!   
---
On a completley unrelated tangent, we also discovered that if you nuke the area around Hopewell Cave, there's a decent amount of crimson in there (not a huge amount, don't get excited.) Then, you've also nuked sons of Dane, and there's a fissure right there that just churns out scorched like it's a freaking factory.
---
Everything on the Nexus is safe to use without ban, I believe all uploaded mods have to be approved by Nexuw moderators to see if they deem them as something that can give you an edge in PVP and shit like that. Lockpick, glowing, and other QoL mods I've used for months without problem.
---
My ultra simple evaluation was based in what I read in Reddit subs, I didn’t account for people that don’t play the game or other complex metrics friend.
---
I'd love to see a preview of the cosmetic rewards for Overseer rank before I decide whether or not I want to do this battle Royale.
---
What? -_-
---
This is very intesting. Seems like a mod that regularly micro-teleports him into the direction of WASD; also he clearly knows how to play with it - see how he's strafing and landing the shots.  
---
I've met a guy in-game teleporting like that, back in december. He was moving at ridiculous speed, but couldn't hit a shit when pvping me; this one got his game running much tighter.
---
I disagree... I didnt want it then, dont want it now.  I really enjoy Fallout 76 and they have been adding a ton of stuff to make your daily log in worth while with plenty of stuff to do, I want this trend to continue.  But I feel this is a real watershed moment for the game, and I hope that future development does not focus on a dumb BR mode.
---
At least for now there is nothing you will miss out on if you skip this mode.  Hopefully it stays that way.
---
How the heck do you make nukashine? I've gotta give it to my sister to drink lol. Does it say what it does when you look at it in your inventory?
---
this bug happened to me as well, weirdest part was the real inner blast radius actually turned on and off radiation as if it were waves of rads coming and going. the sky changed colors and everything.
---
in the comment section,    someone posted screen shots, they are waiting for the mod author to reply back and hopefully we have an update sometime today.
---
do a run.  claim poseidon.  run the nuke cola.  run camden parks.  by the time you have done the run you should have 3 full fusion cores at poseidon.  if all else fails, use the following map:
---
[https://fo76map.com](https://fo76map.com)
---
Agreed. But the ability to flush is an improvement
---
LOL yeah they are I actually avoid them they are slow and noisy and don't actual give that much armor
---
Ok, currently the perk loadout mod does not work anymore. The mod author is working on an update. I will wait for this update. I don't want to play without this mod anymore.
---
Christ on a cracker, I haven't seen that scene since I was in elementary school!
---
Thank you SO much for the information! I'm glad to hear that! :D
---
The legends are true then. The super nuke lives!
---
Wall of text? I just have 3 small paragraphs..... :(
---
It really is!
---
Yeah, its pretty fun, probably my favorite Battle Royale to date, although I am not a fan of Battle Royale in general. Once you figure out which weapons are accurate and which aren't it gets a lot easier to kill people.
---
When I started, I appreciated the help. They can always refuse or not pick things up if they don’t want it...
---
They are on my list. Running a new character without mutations is a struggle.
---
Does that mean I have to buy the outfits so I can use them in the vault?
---
52 players start in fault 51, here you can learn some lore play with friends or choose your cosmetics. After a while a timer runs out, you have to choose a spawn locations. 
---
You'll spawn in, no weapons or gear. Blank state, only cosmetics. Time to get some loot, you can find blueprints for turrets and walls. You can hack or lockpick to get better weapons. Be quick because fire spreads, a circle is closing in. People are around you and it's kill or be killed, even animals try to kill you and they will succeed if your careless.
---
Kill everyone and you win. Get exp to level up your overseers rank and get perkpacks for NW and special skins that you can use in adventure. On top of that you get coins and exp for adventure every game of NW you play.
---
Yeah, its probably several hacks running at same time.
---
I have several perks not working. Travel agent, weapon artisan, Good doggy, all not giving bonus.
---
thats because its entirely separate from the actual game.
---
Same! It took too long to play!
---
Someone tried to do this to everyone in a game my friend and I were playing.  We ran out of the ring of fire and won when everyone else got bombed lol
---
Why no under armor in NW?
---
Because the base game is a PvE game with PvP bolted on as an afterthought and NW was built from the ground up for PvP.  
---
It's not rocket science, certain legendary effects alone are op for PvP, and others are op in concert with specific perks.  Removing all that nonsense for PvP makes the game about skill and not a test of who found the best legendary items over the past 6 months.
---
Thanks for the great response! You're right on the bloodied build, should have specified.
---
That's a lot of perk points you're saving me, what would you suggest I invest them into? By the time I was deciding on where the final points go, there weren't any perks really exciting me. It's been a while since I played and it wasn't with melee so I can't tell what here and there bonuses are going to be helpful.
---
I've unlocked Crates from leveling up, but don't know what they are or where to see them. What do they do?
---
was this a limited-time event?
---
Vending, team play, launching nukes, making serums, keeping my LMG fed.
---
We’re the ones that make Adventure trivial by using legendaries + perks, but that’s how RPGs work, you get stronger the more you play.
---
I've been dropping level 1 bladed rocket baseball bats for them whenever I see them. The hard part is making them understand that the gift is in the bag right in front of me, even with the gift emote lol
---
Guess who else hates Battle Royale games. Apex Legends players. And Blackout players.
---
People need to stop saying they don't like BR games.
---
thanks
---
we need to start compiling a list
---
I can’t remember the last time I found one in a fusion generator. It’s literally been at least a month and I play at least a few hours daily.
---
You just have to learn to ignore the negativity. When I'm not working or gaming, I ride a motorcycle that's universally regarded as one of the least dependable brands on the planet. Its subreddit is full of people just dropping by to tell us we're all morons for even thinking of being in the same room as them. Even so, the last line of your second paragraph sums up my experience perfectly: "Is it perfect? No. Will it ever be perfect? Probably not but it’s fun!!"
---
Don't let others tell you what you are allowed to enjoy. If it's fun for you and doesn't hurt anyone else, just go for it.
---
I agree with your problems except inventory management. I love it. The favorites system is very nice and it auto equips what you pick up if a slot is open. Makes it seamless early game to grab what you think is best of 3 guns you just scrambled for.  Fight then sort it out. 
---
But yeah lag and frames and what not will be worked on. This is a sneak peek. They're not even calling it beta. Gather info. Fix. Just like they did at release. 
---
But as far as gimmicky and polish like Apex? I want this nothing like Apex. Nothing like fortnite. This needs to be like fallout. It's a compressed fallout experience in a battle royale setting. And it's not necessarily to draw masses just for new fans and ultimate genre glory. It's for us Fallout fans. Its not pandering to anyone but us. Will it bring new people in?  Some. And I hope they go explore the fallout world after some battle royale.  
---
Basically if you're not a fan of fallout style then ya itsngonna be weird and lame. It's for us. Not them. 
---
Btw it's not fair to compare everything to fortnite. Compare it the genre and find its uniqueness.  Apex is good in it's own right for the genre. It's not fortnite or pubg.  Just like Cod isn't far cry or battlefield isn't arma.  Etc.
---
I don't have anything unlocked tho, either they are rewards on later levels or I just have to buy them in the first place.
---
So true. Might as well use the button binded to vats for it. Maybe they'll figure it out before it's fully released.
---
Legendaries are fine, but in survival (and adventure) they need a hard nerf when fighting other players.
---
I'm probably the only one here, but I was so caught up in the scout stuff that I never even saw the Arktos event, and to this day, still have never seen it or played it lol
---
Shit I’d take it! 
---
Ima level 4 running around with a machete
---
The bethesda forums have a thread for submitting suggestions for NW such as this one. Great idea, I agree with you.
---
It's not any different in survival/adventure though? Power armor by itself doesn't do much more than regular armor. People in PA are easy pickings in survival. Especially now that automatic weapons do so much more damage per hit in NW, the armor isn't going to provide much. Remember, the way armor works in this game is it's a ratio of their defense to your damage, and that turns into a decimal multiplier for the damage. Basically means that high damage numbers are extremely difficult to avoid and require ludicrous amounts of resistances to tank
---
Ok so the person who downs someone does get the ceedit, just checked
---
You can still get the other rewards so long as you progress high enough.
---
Then you haven’t been awarded anything. I’m only rank two overseer and all I’ve got it’s a player icon of vault 52. When in NW go to your pip boy and check your perks and you have have just earned new perk cards.
---
level 4 is loot box icon, level 5 is loot box skin
---
They’re hoping we forget , what about those possum challenges when can we fix that , or discovering Grafton dam
---
I'm on right now, for another 10 minutes. IGN Sertith.
---
LMAOOO I found the exact same guy! He was teleporting around in power armor and aimbotting everybody with a combat shotgun.
---
You cheated not only the game, but yourself
---
There's a lot of fine tuning needed, but its pretty smooth considering.
---
I'll admit, i was one of the people that said WTF when they showed it at E3, Especially after Wastelanders... but last night i had a blast with my buddy in it who had 0 BR experience. I played a lot of PubG before finally coming to 76 in January (I preordered it but it sat collecting virtual dust) and must say they did a decent job.
---
Only to answer your questions at the end, yes exp and caps are earned for your adventure mode character when playing NW. You also supposedly earn skins and such for use in adventure mode as you level up in NW.
---
I'm not a big battle royale player, but the new mode is fun so far, and I've gotten a level up for my main character while playing, which feels like a kind of bonus for trying out something new.
---
it's a free week, you're gonna have kiddies coming in to ruin people's fun because that's their fun
---
I started calling for a BR mode months ago. I'd be perfectly happy to buy a totally separate fallout BR game with an improved engine with working vehicles, and leave all you whiners behind. I think Fallout BR has a great future ahead.
---
I was very sceptical about it at first, but I decided to give it a chance (mostly because I wanted decos for camp) and tbh I was greatly pleased with it! I guess it'll do until factions and human npcs arrive :)
---
I had this happen i just assumed i was missing because i normally use vats in the overworld to hit with my melee.
---
so you are not alone i couldn't hit anything switched to guns
---
You can. Just use nexus mods. Don't do shit like remove grass or glowing stuff.... I could see that getting you a ban.
---
Better inventory and perk loadout are being looked at by the devs. In a way they can implement them in to the game cause eveyone knows its a console port that is frustrating to use a k+m.
---
This was already happening last night, like 8 hours after launch.
---
Craft them with super duper and use Power User. I can't be bothered farming them anymore...
---
Here are a few that I’ve seen being used 
---
Ultimists high detailed map- adds a legends that shows vendor locations, resources and etc
---
Perk load out manager- which means you can make multiple “classes” that you can switch easily in your perk card menu
---
Better inventory- pretty simple but helps with sorting your items.
---
you use power armor?
---
Lag doesn't let you infinitely move at 3x the sprinting speed and headshot everybody you come across
---
I think it's a universal issue. I have problems with melee hits not registering at all in adventure all the time.
---
Even double tapping the crouch button
---
Its in PRE beta.. anything that can manipulate a delicate new format is needing to be removed until they create something solid.. because it is not currently solid
---
I'm level 10 and don't see any outfits as rewards for the next level either. Might be just later on or maybe not
---
Lol roasted
---
Yes, we will most likely get npc companions in the game with this dlc, most likely to help people who play solo
---
No problem my man glad to help out
---
Yeah teams fuck me up once they've spotted me
---
Is the better inventory mod blocked? :(
---
Right but they're literally two different companies. One is a game studio with developers and the other one is a publisher that publishes games from 6 different studios. Yet for some reason no one is worried about Doom External and its special edition...
---
 Thanks for the recommendations!
---
Is there not enough food and other healing stuff to help you heal? Haven't tried the new mode yet, so I'm curious.
---
They work on non-player enemies though.
---
Of course we can just like things, this post literally has nothing opposing that viewpoint.
---
She just ran out of holotapes...
---
I dont see it to be fun 😞
---
She died
---
Maxons motherfucking Coat
---
Take my money, i dont want it
---
Repacking the 'official' ba2 files with the edited content is equally as controversial as using a .dll to re-enable this function.
---
Given that the devs specifically blocked this because they don't want mods in the BR mode both actions could be considered 'hostile'.
---
Personally I think is a douche move to block mods in any way on a franchise that it is where it is today because of moddind but that is a different conversation.
---
Arguably I am biased because before patch 10 I didn't really enjoy BR games but now I thoroughly despise them.
---
Just disable legendary effects or hard nerf them when fighting other players.
---
They don't care.  People like this are typically sociopaths with no concept of empathy.
---
Hopefully with the introduction of human npcs she will make a appearance.
---
Apparently theyre just player profile icons from the other replies
---
They are pretty bad problem in adventure mode pvp as well. And I disagree with the fine part. They would be fine in a fantasy setting, but feel very out of place in a sci-fi setting. They are essentially magic weapons.
---
Damn. Well at least the missile launcher 1 shots now. Explosives got a huge buff in adventure. My Fat Man is doing 1.5k damage now.
---
Which computers?
---
I don't like battle Royal, but if they ever make a mode removing legendary effects I would play that exclusivley.
---
Same here. I'm unbelievably bad at it, but even the cycle of die &gt; quit to menu &gt; rejoin ads up pretty quickly. Ended up getting 5 overseer levels, a couple atom shop items, a couple thousand adventure xp, and even a few caps in about 2 hours.
---
I’ve only built to set up ambushes. Make a visible bunker, squads will swoop in like moths to a light. Drop some mines in the area and sit back with a grenade launcher.
---
They are scattered all over the lobby. Most are locked behind levels
---
Oooh gurl yiss
---
She went to find people to bring back to WV, she is gonna be in Wastelanders, her voice is in the trailer.
---
Probably a bug that's about the size of the circle in the new battle Royale mode.
---
&gt; impossible to store a reasonable amount of stuff.
---
Do you fill the stash with rare junk?
---
What level is your Character?
---
Sounds like it must be later
---
Yea at atomic shop you can select your NW:skin. (need to own first the clothes)
---
That’s the one! I’ve only just stopped using this at like level 90 been awesome, although I didn’t realise I had to actually search actively until like level 50
---
This has been happening to me too them having the free version actually seems like a logical yet really dumb explanation, since this hasn’t happened to me before.
---
At level 8 now, I think when I hit level 7 I got the small blue loot box as a stash box in my camp.
---
Simply because it's a game and things don't have to make sense, it just has to sound cool in the marketing material...
---
Say what? I've never left Adventure Mode since the Beta. I think it's great PVPers get these new fun modes, but as a PVE player, I'm too busy looting and bulking and selling in the main game. ;)
---
Yeah I was excited that my bomber jacket and cowboy hat was actually working lol.
---
As the great Set once said... dirtnap.
---
so I started playing maybe a month and a half ago I have taken the shine 3 times and 3 freakin times I spawned with a schorched beast outside the shack it put me in, once there were 3. I riped off my clothes and ran towards it...embracing my destiny. :-)
---
That's what I hated about fortnite, someone would put all these walls and floors up the moment they got hit with a single bullet, then somehow appear above you and kill you even though they'd be piss easy to kill normally, happened too many times when I would've killed someone one on one if they didn't spam fucking walls.
---
It gives 76 a bit of something for all players. And if just want to take a break from the grind of the game, you can now just go out and kill for sport.
---
It’s easy to find out on YouTube or google
---
It better not. I live there.
---
Well judging by the speed at which she moves she's probably patrolling the Mojave wishing for a Nuclear Winter....
---
That's why you hard nerf them against other players. PVE is okay though.
---
Yea its ganked...
---
They went thru all the trouble of making it. They should allow us non PVP'ers explore it in adventure mode
---
Isn't that the truth. I'm pretty sure half the time I've died in NW is due to me wearing my Nuka Girl rocketsuit and Moonshine Mama mask.
---
Really? Well then that peaks my interest. I'm not very good at that stuff either. But I'll try the beta for free atom shop stuff
---
I know, which is why this needs to be added to the base game itself like OP says.
---
Maybe, I reckon the full list is available when it goes out in full. Not just the sneakpeak
---
Just saying I'm cautiously optimistic
---
Well vats doesn’t work on players but I can’t aim either xD
---
Definitely replace solar powered with rank 3 of fire proof to avoid the scorchbeast scream attacks.
---
You’re using power armour so I recommend rank 3 of “power user” that goes a long way. The other perks could be quality of life perks if you can’t find any damage perks.
---
If you’re a hoarder like me then get the food and drink reduced weights by 90% under agility and “batteries included” which reduces energy ammo weigh by 90% as well  (I like to have a decent amount of fusion cores).
---
Power armour bloodied melee doesn’t require a lot of perks to make it great so you have a lot of perks to work with here. Completely depends on how you play outside of combat. Also when it comes to regular enemies you will be 100% fine in damage but if you are gonna do endgame bosses like the imposter and the queen then you probably would want max rank adrenaline, maybe revenant e.t.c but for regular gameplay, traversing the lands and doing quests, everything I listed, and that you already have, will be perfectly fine.
---
Yes it's broken, and Bethesda is aware. Unequipping and reequipping all your perk cards will fix it, until you server hop or logout. Not a solution, just a workaround until Bethesda can fix it.
---
No I’m on Xbox
---
I think so, yes.
---
I can sell you some hundreds if you still are in need.
---
Considering that I'm one of those solo players who is always in adventure mode, woo hoo! ;)
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Yep, that’s why I use the most brown outfit in the game. I can hide standing up in the middle of a grassy area with a bunch of bushes and nobody will see me.
---
Now I see the blue vault suit easy peezy
---
I really dont get ya, nor do I care to
---
Ah ok
---
Thanks for the insight! I completely missed weapon artisan, definitely seems like a good perk. I remember there being bugs for both the 'repair to over 100%' style perks, did those get fixed? 
---
Last I played the stash was half this size and I wasn't running a strength build so going to have bad judgement on weight modifying perks.
---
You know how big cannon balls are, right?
---
I mean, im sure a dataminer will post it in the next day or two
---
Is so glad NW has got people talking about the shitty the legendary effects system is.
---
She turned into a molewoman and is secretly trading away their stockpile of really powerful weaponry to the vault dwellers in hopes that they will take revenge on them for mutating her.
---
Yeah but they also accept Reddit posts and I find Reddit far more Accessible. If Bethesda forums were as accessible. I would. 
---
I know Bethesda reads this sub :)
---
I doubt they'll walk around map with you. Game lags and crashes as is and doubling the people walking around would just make it worse.
---
I expect it to be camp companions or simply a word used to relay mission givers as you'll be working for/with them.
---
I honestly think its cause its simple.  Fortnite literally has "Who can build the most fastest and fuck with their bulid the best mid combat." I can't stand it.
---
The atom shop stuff hasn't been that great so far - a player icon and a stash box skin by level 5. There are supposed to be statues and power armor paint jobs for the higher levels. Basically though, you get enough adventure xp and novelty items you can't get elsewhere to make it worth your while. Plus hone your skills; learning to fight without VATS has been a new experience for me and I kinda like it.
---
I wish I had played more I only played some towards the end of the 360 gen. I really wish they brought it back in the collection like I feel like they just didn't know how good it must have been 😪
---
I wish they changed them to lunch boxes that we could customize.
---
She's literally the voice in the Wastelanders trailer. She left App and is returning.
---
Post-millenials don't like to lose. So they automatically will reject a new mode that encourages competition especially a mode where they are likely to lose a lot. No participation trophies in Nuclear Winter.
---
Cost is a valid point and it was brought up...   
---
But finding a way to filter the white noise from the constructive feedback is something companies often suffer from, and it's hard to get a good read without face to face interaction.  
---
Depends, which RP tolls are you referring too?  
---
Yes, the character names was done for simplicity of reporting, and it makes a certain amount of sense in light of how other games have struggled with Alts and secondary characters and reporting them
---
Loud minorities said they didn't want it.  I've been saying I want a BR (non sarcastically) since before fo76.
---
Dodgy.
---
Adamantium Skeleton is kind of an odd one.  I don't run it and, in practice, I rarely get limb cripples.  Supposedly it prevents staggers at a high rank, but this is an indirect result of your legs being immune to cripple - the Scorchbeast Queen smacking you with her wing will still cause you to stagger backward.
---
It's only fun because it's easy. Give it a while when proper players learn the ropes and those that mostly pve have little chance to win. Otherwise this is pretty much like every other br only it's much easier to win at. I just got this game a couple days ago, but I've played plenty br and can see why people think it's fun right now.
---
Then don’t play the BR mode and you can wear whatever you want. Complaining about a function of a game mode you don’t even like is the definition of a waste of time.
---
Hey all, 
---
We're aware of this one and we're currently looking into a fix for our next update so you can get your Gun Fu on!
---
Anyone know if you build a workbench you could mod weapons?
---
Personally I think Xp should be dependant on damage dealt.
---
Vending, and ideal gear acquisition are what's been keeping me playing. Lvl ~215 or so, w/ approx. 650 hours played since beta. I'm feeling a break coming soon for me, but I still find it relaxing/entertaining to hop on and play most nights. I still find it rather unbelievable that after all of this time, I still find new things I've never seen after playing for soooo long. Whether it be an unmarked locale, random event or just subtle nuance that I'd never noticed. Say what you want, half baked, buggy, no npc's etc. . . But if you actually pay attention you can tell a lot of time, effort and love went into this game. Just my .02 though.
---
The BR should have just been a seperate F2P like Fortnite did.
---
Is there a specific design decision for how it is currently?
---
\^This. Also XP dependant on damage done. Don't kill them put you put a shot on? You get that amount of xp.
---
I think it's well done. Would love to see more weapons added. Flames buzz blades etc
---
Yeah and someone in a bathing suit carrying 5 miniguns totally makes sense. It's not about logic it's about balancing. If it was 10 steel it'd be fine but lead is really not that easy to get.
---
agreed
---
This 
---
Even now at high levels I run out of stuff all the time, so like sure it’s charity, but in the wasteland regardless of level, every *thing* and every cap is valuable
---
I want a little robot companion to be honest, not a massive help but it makes the wasteland less lonely, and It can carry items
---
:D
---
They don't notify for sales anymore?
---
Community Manager has replied to an earlier post about this, seems to be one of the top-most requested things.
---
I think that what you meant to say is that most hate broken PvP but enjoy it when PvP is done right.
---
I'm thinking that a lot of players tried PvP or had PvP forced on them Pre Nuclear Winter and hated how broken and one-sided it is.  
---
Nuclear Winter fixes this by having everyone start out the same at the same level, the way PvP is meant to be played.  What they are surprised by is that the Devs finally got it right...
---
Now if they would just add a Capture the Flag mode...
---
yeah but loading it up is a pain. we need a lobby for friends and also more guns.
---
I did notice a full rack of magazines in Vault 51. So.. Fingers crossed it's soon?
---
If you don't find anyone, I'll help later one (it'll be a few hours)
---
That information should still be there. There was, and presumably still is, a bug where that part of the UI just stops showing up for the rest of that session.  Restarting the game should fix it.
---
He’s only talking about Nuclear Winter
---
Just an fyi bud, other people can't see what you've named weapons. I believe it reverts to default for others.
---
They didn't sell a book with only a chapter done, they sold us a book we wish was longer but wasn't...   
---
They gave us a game with a map larger than FO4, a comparable number of quests (if I remember correctly) and so much more environmental story, and right or wrong we wanted more.   
---
Hell IM one of the people who wanted more end game content (because the queen was lackluster) hitting level 300 about eight weeks in, and we've slowly gotten more of it, which is good.
---
I'd be fine with it if we could salvage ammunition for the base components and craft what we need.
---
Nothing makes getting to the bottom of a can of dog food as enjoyable as a fifth of bourbon.
---
nope - you just get the sold sound and a caps notification of the sales amount, but no info on what was sold.
---
For the last few weeks I've only found 25% cores in the armor spawns, and checking those spawn points is 75% of my play time
---
What do you mean
---
Do you always base your opinion after trying something one time? 🤷
---
Everyone who has a mostly positive opinion seem to have played it multiple times, I suggest you do the same before you give feedback.
---
I’ve been a non-online player the whole time I’ve had my Xbox because of social issues. First time I’ve ever wanted to talk to people is this game. Plugged in a headset I got for Christmas a few years back and it doesn’t work. From what I’ve gathered on google, sounds like my controller is the issue. Sucks.
---
It would need to be different in adventure / survival too. Otherwise what's the point of leveling up in fire storm. I'd imagine it's all wrecked in adventure survival while it's new and prestine in fire storm. I'm pretty sure lore wise fs takes place before 76 even opens.
---
A smaller melee focused map would be good too.
---
Bashing each others brains in for the chance to be Overseer
---
If you limit the stash by number of items, everyone will always use that upper limit. Limiting it by weight forces people to make decisions, which in the long run will average out to a lower number.  My buddy saves mostly weapons which weigh a lot, so his stash contains a small number of objects. I store mostly junk and aid items that are light so I have a lot. Between the two of us, they average out to a number of items that is somewhere in between, and therefore lower than if we both had a count restriction (unless they made that limit so low that I couldn’t keep everything I have now, which would just set off complaints form the community again). There will be cases where that average gets pushed one way or another depending on the hoarding habits of the people on that server at the moment, but overall it’ll average out.
---
They could have achieved the same goal by limiting the stash to a set number of entries like you say, but that wouldn’t fit into the game world very well and would frustrate people for other reasons. A weight limit both makes the game feel more survival’y and still lets them manage server resources.
---
I was at 146 and wen 147
---
I don't like the new mode, but am happy that others are enjoying it, and more free PvE stuff is coming. 
---
Just wish the atom store had cooler skins for me to actually spend money on to show my support.
---
Honestly though, that stuff is insane
---
I was getting notified about what items sold after the update.
---
That's my only issue atm as well. Your average alive time shouldn't be longer than the wait to get in the game. Cut the lobby and load times down OR make the map bigger and the matches longer.

I'm pretty sure thatll happen when it fully releases, from my times in the lobby, I haven't heard the AI saw any of his lines from the trailer.
---
Well, you have to be level 100 to get through the door inside the overseers office so we've all got a few ranks ahead of us to find out yet lol.
---
See, you didn't understand a single thing about what I just asked. Like you either willfully disregarded or or genuinely don't understand what I was asking. 
---
Both of those things are extremely important to fostering an actual RP community. Fallout is first and foremost an RPG franchise and yet we don't have tools that you need to effectively pursue those activities online.
---
But you just validated Bethesdas stance in regards to their decision.
---
This is exactly why one voice (or in this case a few) should not be the deciding slice of feedback that makes it to the devs.
---
I am guessing by your reply that my assumption that those questions were not asked is correct.
---
Well put. I agree 100%
---
Also on my PvE guy I find way more bolstering armor, which I wear. It could be coincidental, but it's something I, and other people I talk to, have noticed. Not a guarantee to get anything. Just possibly a bit more likely. I speculate the legendary vendor gets "stuck" on a prefix when you buy an item or something. No evidence. Just what something I noticed.
---
Huh - I've been in for 5 sessions since the update and all I'm getting is caps notifications, but no details of the sale, every time in every session.
---
Before patch 10 I didn't like BR games. Tried them, not really my cup of tea, but that's it. They existed, they were out there, people enjoyed them, happy days.
---
Now we have a FO flavoured BR, which is basically the same formula which has been now been done to death with a sprinkle of FO dust on top.
---
Again, this by itself would be no big deal as long as it was kept isolated and wouldn't spill to other parts of the game.
---
Alas spilled it has. And even though for many this may look like minutiae it kind of isn't for me. A franchise that is where it is today because of mods is actively blocking the ability to load mods. Douche move does come to mind.
---
The fact that I have lost a staple QoL mod irks me but the fact that the method of loading it has been deliberately blocked makes me very, very sad. Moreover I now despise BR games and begrudge the devs for the move.
---
Bring on private servers please.
---
My primary character is level 375, and I've only done 2 quests... The enclave and the Raider quest line...   
---
I've not been to the first overseer camp (I'm serious) and  enjoyed the hell out of the game, exploring and loving the environment...   
---
Hell I don't even do the challenges intentionally...  
---
So yes I enjoy the game, but glad to see it improving and glad more, deeper content is coming.
---
Breaking down excess ammunition that you aren't using into lead/gun powder/steel and use that to craft what you do need.
---
As one of those "Free" players I have developed a very close relationship with that paper bag today. I have visited it many many times today. :D
---
If you spent a fraction of the time googling your question that you spend asking people to photoshop you to look like black panther, you'd have found your answer easily.
---
Most of my good/bad luck has revolved around SBs.  
---
I've had as many as 4 in a row (is that bad?) but they did wait for me to loot one I just killed  before the next showed up, so I guess thats good. :)
---
Bad, of sorts: Had been a long session, and was ready to log off.  Had just script'ed a bunch of legendaries @ WS Station when I was attacked by a L80 SB.  
---
I knew I could take it, but wasn't up for an extended fight.
---
I ran across to the WS gate so the bots could help.
---
Good: SB aggro'd the bots, so they started shooting at it.
---
When it landed, I started banging away with a 50 cal
---
Bad: hit a WS Protectron.
---
Worse: Was then attacked by 2 assaultrons, 2 protectrons, a sentrybot, and 4 Mr Handys.  
---
And the SB.
---
Luck: killed them all.
---
Same here. Guess I won't be able to try the game.
---
This 100%! You can treat it much more like a more involved event quest. You're also paired with 3 other people on a team - so even if you're not the greatest, you can get perks to help heal, or tank, or you can hide in the back and snipe, or find great loot and call your teammates over to grab it.  
---
I played last night a few hours and had a few people that clearly weren't grade-A PvP material. It didn't matter. They were still my team, and they still contributed. Hell, I've been playing PvP style games since Team Fortress Classic circa 1999, and I still got my ass handed to me more than a few times last night.  
---
The cool thing about this mode of PvP is that intelligence is rewarded just as much as your fighting skill - if not more so. You can literally just be sneaky and hide in smart places until the end of the game... especially if you have teammates that are better at shooting, and you're better at navigating the map.
---
Yeah, I can see that. Makes sense I suppose.
---
Ehh, haters have been around the last couple of days because of E3.
---
I think damage in nuclear winter is near perfect
---
I wouldn't mind if the broadsider was actually a decent weapon.
---
Well that kills my hypothesis. I absolutely did not level up :(
---
Im offended that people like being lied to? Lmao okay this place is whats left of the fallout76 debacle. Ill go buy some kneed pads for you. Yours must be worn out, lmao. Thanks for the laugh. Im glad im not you. Thanks for making my day better, brightened it right up.
---
Ah yes that'd be great
---
Oh no I don’t want super hardcore gameplay, I just really fucking suck at high TTK games because my aim is horrid
---
okay - this might just be me - I might need to shut the console down and restart it from scratch, because I'm not seeing what you guys are seeing
---
Lol! I did the same lots of fun
---
Killing the scorch queen for good? eh? I dunno.
---
Same here man, it has been a bitter pill to swallow this whole time.
---
Yea, but saying that you don't need it is just a further point as to why it's crap that that's the endgame. A system with enough granularity to provide you with a nice power curve near the end can actually accommodate content that is difficult or even impossible to do without first building up the appropriate gear, allowing for progression to be a lot more rewarding.
---
If the legendary weapons were iterative improvements you collect as you go through harder and harder content it would be a lot more motivating.
---
Yeah, I have this unwritten rule that if the other player doesn't acknowledge my wave, or runs away/pretends I'm not there, they don't get a gift and I don't press it.
---
Dude the questions been answered big man, why you still talking to me
---
damn, just like division 2 it will eat up my bandwidth for sure.
---
If a player has renamed the weapon he wants to sell from his vendor, does the customer see that name change? I haven't seen one yet, so I'm curious about that. Maybe renaming causes problems on the customers side.
---
Glad you found your new weapon though, I once bought a Quad Assaultron Head from someone's vendor just as their Camp disappeared, I was lucky to get it before they left.
---
This is why I wouldn't mind it going ftp
---
Damn heretics and their love of putting spikes on everything!
---
I tried Survival for the first time after really enjoying NW. I died a few times to crazy jumping marsupial player with deathclaw gauntlets. It was pretty lame cause I could do a thing and I died in like two hits.
---
Welcome to the wasteland, booze is to the right, chems to left
---
I've been having a blast since day 1! Had to put up with the bugs but I've definatly got my moneys worth so far.
---
That would be *amazing*.
---
Welcome to Appalachia friend.
---
Dude let me tell you. I have a Two shot broadsider. At 50% health and demo expert 3 it deals over 1k dmg. I haven't tried it out but if i get down to 20% health with nerd rage and demo expert 5 it'll probably go over 2k
---
r/fallout actually sucks so bad, one of the most toxic subs ive seen
---
r/johnwick
---
Still a bummer though.  I do miss my FO4 hoard. :)
---
Even in PVE there are other problems, like totally invalidating player crafting at endgame.
---
They are more tolerable from a player standpoint but they really wreck a ton of interaction we would be having in the player economy otherwise.
---
Someone refused my gifts and it made me a little sad so I just went and gave it to someone else
---
Pyschobuff all the way
---
There's been a story and NPC's since day one. Just because it's mainly delivered in the form of notes and holotapes rather than being forcefed to you doesn't make it less of story. Ditto on NPCs. There are dozens of NPCs, there just aren't any "human" ones that you can actually interact with.
---
As for mods, you're playing the wrong game if you expect to have tons of mods available. They're never going to allow anything that alters game mechanics until they release private servers. If you want to play in a sandbox where the deathclaws have been replaced by Thomas the Tank Engine, go back to F04.
---
So many newbs to revive, just need them to die in a pool of water...
---
That is a WAY better idea. I may have played for longer than one round were that the case. That's the one thing I've hated about single death elimination style gaming. It's really not fun to spectate.
---
Do you use a broadsider. Can you keep up with the ammo consumption?
---
The reviews are mostly people who don't even play anymore and think its stupid that anyone does. Welcome to the Wasteland friend, grab a gun and have fun.
---
That is a good alternative too.
---
I don't mind the hate because it will dissuade Bethesda and other companies from the shoddy practice of launching games in an unacceptable state with the notion of "We'll just fix it later".  
---
But I also feel like Bethesda deserves credit for turning the ship around.  
---
For me it's not a zero sum game: they deserve the criticism but they also deserve praise for the direction they are taking the game.
---
Just a reminder that not everyone likes it.
---
Then again I've already seen people over level 25 so maybe it won't take so long after all
---
oh my god........
---
u/BethesdaGameStudios_  is this intentional?
---
Yeah but I’m saying that kills only go to people to finish a downed player.
---
The Welshman goes looking for wildlife to....befriend. The German calculates the most efficient way to quarter the map and locate the enemy, then the minimum number of bullets required. The Englishmen have a quiet cup of tea, then invade the local town and advise the natives they didn't deserve to own it all along.
---
(Irishman here, don't mind me, I'm pissed as expected).
---
All the rooftops in Watoga!
---
Looks like a lag switch to me
---
Use the ammosmith and super duper perk card when you craft ammo
---
The NPC did state “We will fight for you”. I take it would be similar to hiring a swordsman in TES
---
Remember to wear helemts. It might save your life, especially from pistols.
---
As others have said...  
---
1. Claim a power plant and power up the fusion core generator (do the plant power-up event or use a fusion generator).   
---
2. Get the fusion core recipe, farm flux, and make fusion cores.
---
I tend to claim power plants because I also get the rewards from the defend/re-take events and I sell the plans in my store.  But, I use the fusion generator to power the fusion core generator to avoid having to do the power-up event.  It's not that hard, it just takes time that I would rather use doing other things...
---
Zero food, there are also different types of stimpaks in this mode. I remember standard, "expired", and some version of the super stimpak that healed different amounts. If you take damage while the stimpak is healing, it actually stops healing you.
---
Overall made it more difficult to heal, but this makes any healing-related perks much more valuable to have on a team. It also lowers camping - if you could regen, even slowly, people are more likely to just duck out of battle to regen which is boring.
---
Vats with ai enemies tho
---
Can someone point to the particular moments or timestamps showing the cheat or exploit and what it is?  This is one of the reasons I avoid PVP because of the rampant cheating that occurs.
---
Yeah i know but i feel like it's still too low. I think it's just that nobody cares about the broadsider that's why it didn't get that buff like the flamer and the cryo
---
Oh. I didn't follow it. I killed it and then I killed the rats.
---
I def feel that. I had a freakin' nuts match yesterday with a team mate. Good communication even though we had no mics and used all emotes. Didn't win but our team placed 2nd and it was a blast. Would've loved to keep playing with that player but after that never saw em again and was so intense didn't get a chance to send a friend request, lol.
---
Best BR out there in my honest opinions!
---
Cranberry Bog would be nice too, imagine fighting in Watoga
---
All like ALL?
---
Vault 51 will open once NW is out of beta
---
You dont.  They are avatars. It's confusing.
---
I'm glad you're enjoying it and gave it a chance despite what others and reviews have tried to make it out to be! :)
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure they will release other arenas. For now I think they limited it to one spot so that they can track bugs and issue with more efficiency.
---
I'd kill for a minimap in every mode
---
Dogfood
---
Nuka colas
---
Plans
---
Stims
---
Ammo
---
Iknowright. It's like Looney Tunes + Legos meets World of Warcraft with guns. Honestly I think the dance emotes are what made it so popular, and perhaps just the air-drop portion where it feels like the (small) world is your oyster for a minute.
---
I try to sell cheap ammo and junk to free up my stash and make quick cap after emptying the vendors.
---
I'm always on a lookout for a cheap legendary that I can sell for scrip when I'm too busy farming legendaries myself.
---
&gt; How many people even play now?
---
I don't know about the other platforms, but it's consistently in the top 25 most played games on XBL.
---
What gets me is the people who use the Nuka Dark to hate on 76 specifically. Like, it's a third party product, licensed by the game's *publisher*, yet somehow the quality of the packaging is still like Jeff Gardiner's fault, because he's the 76 project lead.
---
Future seeing redditor will I ever get married?
---
There shouldn't be unlimited scrap in stash but say free space for 150 or 200 pieces of each type of normal scrap would be cool, 30 to 50 of the stable fluxes would also be fair.  Having enough space for repairs and some crafting would be a great addition.
---
Perhaps.
---
&gt; I agree with your problems except inventory management.
---
The inventory system has a ton of quirks - e.g. why are there data and radio tabs in the Pip Boy when there's no use for them in Nuclear Winter? It's just something there for you to misclick during a gunfight. Fallout 76 was already slated for its inventory management; putting it into the fast-paced environment of a battle royale game simply does not work.
---
&gt; The favorites system is very nice
---
Maybe it's because I'm new, but it really doesn't make much sense to me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling that way.
---
&gt; I want this nothing like Apex.
---
Apex Legends is one of the most polished shooters to have launched in the last year. Aside from blatant fanboyism, there's no reason to argue against Fallout 76 learning something from it. The ping system alone is ingenious; it opens the game up so much more - to being able to play with pubbies who don't use mic, to those who have hearing problems, etc. 
---
&gt; This needs to be like fallout. 
---
Adding quality-of-life changes like a ping system or better inventory management will not make it any less Fallout. That comes from its aesthetic and gameplay - e.g. the radiation mechanic, the Americana artstyle, etc.
---
&gt; And it's not necessarily to draw masses just for new fans and ultimate genre glory.
---
It is, and it should be. This battle royale mode only exists in the first place because it's the flavour of the month. If they're going to jump on the bandwagon, then they might as well use it to attract as many people to the game as possible. More players is better for all of us, as it incentivises and funds the devs to keep adding new content not just to Nuclear Winter but to the game as a whole.
---
Definitely. I'm in your boat; I played one match of Fortnite way back in the day (to see what the hype was about) and hated it. Never been a BR guy, tho. But I'm looooving NW. Only thing is it really winds me up lol adrenaline gets pumping like crazy and I usually gotta take a break and simmer down afterwards! XD I'm chalking that one up to being new to BR type stuff tho...
---
That's not true. Every character is created in Adventure mode and you can then bring it to Survival or NW.
---
Yeah, the stated damage on my Bloodied Power Fist tends to be around 900-1,200, so I was surprised it was hitting well above that, likely because of the implicit power attack that comes from attacking while sprinting.
---
I've been saying it since last year's E3. The place is basically No Mutants Allowed 2.
---
I was able to click on the newblets swarming out of Vault 76 earlier (PC). Didn't crash. Hope this helps deductions.
---
Look at them [grouping up in Morgantown](https://i.imgur.com/weq2tag.png)!
---
There's much better single shot weapons and you can put out more dps with any other weapon. My Automatic IE Railway 1 shots all common infantry and takes out a third of the sheepsquatch health almost instantly with 10 shots. My IE Dragon takes 2/3 health off of a lv80 scorched beast. My instigating or quad broadsider don't even compare. They are pretty much a waste of space atm.
---
A lot of players play solo but from previous games we know how squishy the companions are.
---
So I have the idea that they’ll either provide a stat boost, making them invulnerable and incapable of dealing damage or that they will be pets/robots.
---
Considering the 100 days roadmap shows a badge that depicts a Protectron torso on Sentry treads that Automatron style companions might be the way they go about it, allowing different mods and cosmetics depending if you side with settlers or raiders
---
Thanks a lot for your advice! I started looking at different builds to get a better grasp of how to choose my perks and equipment. I will try my hand at PVP in the nuclear winter update in the meantime :)
---
What is your name in game?
---
I think because they can be modified to gain an additional defense boost.
---
Yep, like every card.
---
I tested myself yesterday, just doing it for Gun Fu didn't work, but doing it for every card did work.
---
Yeah, with access based on your Overseer level.  I tried to go to Vault 51 thinking it was open for us, but it's still sealed up.  Maybe when it's officially open for Nuclear Winter and this is still just a sneak peak?
---
Because some are natural born losers. Online game is the only place they can remotely feel like a winner, via dumb and blatant cheating of course.
---
When 76 came out it just became a shit on 76 beyond what even it deserved. Just got tired of it.
---
I hadn't really even questioned it, since it's been around since FO4. Thought it was pretty cool at first, but when researching "How to Survive in PvP" and seeing the redundant rabbit hole that is the legendary meta, I got a head-ache and kinda gave up. I have a half-bloody build now and it's highly unsatisfying... not worth it just to keep up with griefers.
---
This would definitely keep me coming back to the mode. With other battle royal games I always find myself getting tired of the map quickly.
---
For real! Usually feels like a gamble opening the map for me. At least with the Pip-Boy you can do that transparent overlay so you can get in your inventory but still see if anyone's coming at ya. A mini-map for NW would be dope.
---
No.  You can pull in your normal character.  Unlike Survival, it's inconsequential both ways. You don't bring your armor and weapons from Adventure, and you don't lose anything if you die.
---
Yeah, it really is, but instead of jerking fallout 1 and 2 they jerk NV
---
I don't about that, literally everyone I met in the game pretty much said the same thing. Personally never been a fan of the game type. I prefer either competitive team death matches respawn such as Halo or solo play such as traditional Fallout.
---
My guess is it’ll turn up in the 20s
---
Ahh nice post. I hope this make it to the top. Would be nice non-weapons fill the spots counter-clockwise too. So weapons would be on the right and chems on the left.
---
disease cure/antibiotic, because of the stupid fucking disease situation
---
plasma cartridges, because I use them
---
acid.  always, always need acid.
---
cheap full fusion cores
---
nuke key cards
---
high voltage hefe
---
You guys are delusional..
---
Great stuff! Thankyou for jumping on this one quick, it's great to see your continued efforts to interact with us in the community, and try your best to keep us all happy and I look forward to the fix, although the super mutants at west tek may not be so pleased!
---
&gt; However each time I finish a game, and made a few new friends over voice....
---
What platform are you playing on that people are using a headset? That's the real question here.
---
No, I've just not had my coffee this morning and a bit exhausted from a couple hectic weeks, no need to get nasty.  
---
But I can't answer every question, because I don't k ow everything, and I legitimately need you to expand the "Roll playing tools" because that is vague enough I have no clue what you are specifically referencing
---
Sterling is a idiot who only got famous because some other idiot sued him his opinion is garbage he hates all triple A companies because they want money and because EA exist hating everything doesn't make you better it just makes you hateful
---
Amazing! Thanks for the help. Going to aim for some quality of life perks mixed in and morph them out or keep them when I hit 50.
---
I realize it's a typo, but a fiends list needs to be a thing...
---
you should be fine. There's plenty of shotguns and automatics that just need to be pointed in the general direction of an enemy.
---
Also, there's a ton of foliage and other hiding spots compared to most other BR games that I've played, and stealth boys seem plentiful, so sneaky sniper play is very, very doable. 
---
Last night my fiancee (who rarely plays) took second place in her first match. Killed someone with a silenced pipe bolt action about 1/2 way through and picked off a couple other people with that before she got consumed by the storm and died.
---
To be fair, most of the reviewers were right; even Bethesda has acknowledged so because the Wastelanders update is basically addressing that.
---
I actually experienced bugs with it - like being unable to exit it at all. A power armor skin I don’t own appearing on it and taking over my whole screen etc
---
she got tired of all the unfixed bugs in the game and quit
---
FUN!!! I'm loving it
---
Don’t worry, I suck too. The best I’ve done is when I hide the entire time. 
---
As for the level-lock, all the lore will be out there very soon. The only difficulty is certain parts of the vault are also level-locked similar to the Enclave questline progression. 
---
My advice is to try to join up with a good team, mic up, and hide like a mofo. 
---
I’m a melee build and we are at a severe disadvantage without our mutations, but such is life.
---
Weird.  Don't know what to tell you. :/
---
: (
---
I played 8-ish games last night, and of all those times only once did I spawn close enough to enemies that I died in the first couple of minutes. If you want to last longer, pick a more obscure location on the map to spawn - it's up to you. Most people will pick one of the small towns where they can get assured loot, but there is loot scattered all over the map, even in some wilderness areas.
---
Oh dammit ☹️😂🤣
---
Her comment is at 111 points right now. I wish we could lock it there
---
I move the same speed with both when this happens, so I don't think it has to do with the power armor.
---
You get weapon skins and furniture later on. Overseer's chair is at level 10.
---
Got the game yesterday after trying trial its great. I didmt go to any vendors but a lvl 200 gave me a beer recipe. Just another example of a great community helping the new people
---
Yeah. "Stimpack Extra" whatever that means.
---
And knocking someone is 30 and killing them is 80. I got 3400 for a win with 3-5 kills. Exp and caps from this mode is negligible and useless for a char over 200.
---
You check is in the mail Bethesda thsnks you if you want a bonus please push the Atom's a little more ((this us a joke i love fallout 76))
---
I saw the same thing last night, didnt know what to make of it. But there was one brave madlad in the center so musta been ok.
---
Deathmates are definitely something I reckon might be in the pipeline or at least on the drawing boards. I hope they can offer a few different modes as well like something balanced to the level of NW but also one where you can use your adventure mode perks/gear/mutations
---
I hate when devs add unneccessary waiting to a game. It's horrible game design and kills both fun and immersion. I agree this game mode has too much waiting. I hope the drvs optimize it.
---
You can use the shower too
---
+karma for trying though, lol.
---
I did the same thing, relocated last night and set up shop near the bridge that's close to The Overseer's Camp. At the moment, I have Deep Pocketed Leather Armor, a Fire Axe or two, and basic supplies cheap or free. Most armor pieces are 5-10 caps, pans are also very cheap, unless its something more advanced.
---
People often throw items in the overseer's stash at the camp. I used to put some extra ammo and chems on the dead body near the vault exit.
---
For some reason the two shot broadsider is the best version of it and deal i think double the dmg.  I used to own a IE Dragon. At low health it's dmg goes a little above 1k. With the instigating effect it deals maybe idk 2.5 dmg per shot if you don't use vats. Also the reload speed is very very slow, so definitely not more dps. The broadsider on the other hand deals that amount of dmg with every shot, has a larger magazine and reloads much faster. This baby rocks.
---
All you gotta do is pander to everyone with NPCs and battle royale and the game is suddenly alright.
---
So... Tues right?
---
Same here. That’s what prompted my post.
---
The person who finishes them did kill them.  The player who just got finished is now dead.  D...E...A...D.  Cannot be revived.  Put out of their misery.  Gone into the light.  And the person who finished them KILLED them.  They didn't mortally wound them.  They KILLED them.
---
This is like saying that in adventure mode I'm going through a silo, helping a noob launch a nuke, and am killing most of the robots etc.  He puts in the launch code and launches the nuke.  Should I get the "credit" toward launching a nuke simply because I did all the work?  No, because I didn't LAUNCH THE NUKE.  Much like the player who incapacitates another player DID NOT KILL him.
---
Everything is negligible for a char over 200 though. It's a huge amount for a level 1-50.
---
serendipity doesn't work in PA
---
Watoga would be awesome but I’d hate the bog itself. I have a jet pack finally and that was just because of all those holes and paths in the bog.
---
Agreed. It def was not without its faults and shortcomings but it was far from the disaster some people were making out to be. I know that wasn't everyones experience but it was far from a disaster for me and my friends. Been loving the hell out of this game since beta day 1, lol.
---
I sell a ton of acid, other bulk like gears etc, and treasure maps.  I have other things listed but those seem to sell the most.  As far as what i buy, plans mostly and other odd legendaries that I'll probably use once and stick back just to say I have it (looks at the two-shot fatman taking up about 18lbs of space in his stash)
---
It’s definitely more fun when you are in a team with others who are actually communicating and helping each other.
---
I think you would like headshot death better.
---
Yeah...Stuck in the same repeating modes. There's no survival RPG attached to OW. While here, the rewards I get in Nuclear Winter works in Adventure mode. It feels worthwhile.
---
Not possible for a low level without power leveling. For my level 385? Pfft. Nah, adventure wins by a mile. I can clear every ghoul in WS in 10 minutes. That's easily 130+ exp per kill * 30-40.
---
Nope you can't get a full set of sent_ass armor even in thirty weeks of grinding. Those aren't kids grinding hard those are adults bought their duped stuff off ebay and pretend to be badass, which they will never be. Kind of pathetic really.
---
No, you just dont know what bloom means
---
I just got the game a few days ago and tried to decorate my camp with junk i was finding and I was grabbing certain things with the idea of "ah this will look nice in my eventual camp". I was so disappointed when i realized you couldn't place stuff. I'm just glad to hear that it is a thing that will be implemented eventually.
---
Wow I feel really dumb now.  I thought it was just 1 card per special...
---
Should be treated like atomic shop content
---
I hope they wil also have outposts and can show up as random encounters.
---
Thank you for communicating with your fans and listening to our feedback.
---
This is a much needed change for those of us that are altoholics.
---
Totally agree. I hate being in a tight spot and fiddling around the wheel to find a stim
---
This is true, I’m new to this style of gameplay but I like it. This mode is super fun, I just wish the conversion wasn’t so harsh on melee builds. The inability to close distance through VATS, etc etc.
---
yeah an auto rejoin new lobby would be great so you don’t have quit and reload each time
---
They can bind it to the emote key for all i care. Mostly useless in NW anyway since enemies can see it.
---
Wrong, it should work like atomic shop items.
---
Been thinking about doing this as well - usually just go to 76 when I see a level 2 and dump some stuff in a bag
---
Gave some newb 10,000 rounds of 10mm hahaha
---
I'm sure that bogged him down but he was jumping and emoting like nuts 
---
Think today I'll craft some level 5 armor/weapons and Santa Claus some newbies
---
They were, the game was rough at the start.  It's gotten a lot better though so I wish some of the reviewers would take a second look.  Still has its hiccups , but least its on the right track.
---
Ok so I too am a melee user of two handed but I'm bloodied. As of right now my perception is 1 base, i have nerd rage on and in nuke zones my damage is nuts cos i dont clear out my rads as fast. I double up with the radicool perk card to enhance that by a lot. So i would have a hard time answer what to put in there as i nor.ally just have lockpick on and like i said i only have 1 point in there. If anything I'd put a rifle one in there or something so you can use a rifle in case of long range attacks, like shooting a scorch beat or something. That way you can shoot, do some damage and at least have a shit in, in case of an early demise of the enemy your fighting.
---
Na totally fun to put in 100 hours on a character then rinse and repeat for my other 4.
---
PC. I think roughly 2 people in each pick up group have mics
---
They could be shutting down the Austin team and using the money on better projects. Yes it does work that way if they were inclined.
---
If they are using a 16 bit unsigned integer (small int), it would be the same amount of database storage from 0 to 65,535.
---
A SQL bigint would take it up to over 4 billion.
---
I don't know the specifics of how much data they are working with, but I'll bet it wouldn't make that much of a difference to allow more scrap.
---
I think the limitation is way more important on individual items.
---
Limiting scrap and other stacking items is probably more about making the game challenging and a tiny bit realistic.
---
I wish they'd increase the stash space though. I'm sure I'll just fill it up and be in the same boat, but these weapons they are giving in the weekly survival challenges are heavy. I've got some stuff I will never use but also dont want to part with because I'm apparently an in-game hoarder.
---
In Fallout 4 / Skyrim I had a different container for each item category, and separate boxes for specific getups, like if I want to mix it up and play as the Silver Shroud for a while I'd have all that stuff in one box.
---
Ah, was never an issue for me. I've had the Marisupial mutation since the beta
---
Yeah but only the people that didnt even buy the PA edition are angry about them
---
That would be really nice also. I didn't think of that, great idea!
---
The Tesla rifle is just pure cancer. They need to make it arc only when it hits target.
---
hey mein freund , ich kann leider nicht mein camp bei dir platzieren.. kannst du versuchen mir zu joinen? ich komme dann zu deinem camp , danke!
---
It is a week-long preview.  I would hope in the final version, we see one for each biome.
---
Except you're proposing that this is a Fallout game for people who don't like Fallout, which I don't think is true as plenty of people like both. I just don't like the "either or" bullshit that gets around so much, so it's not entirely directed to you.
---
Screws. I can never find anyone with screws.
---
Yes, I am constantly wandering and hopping servers trying to get "the right picture". I tell my friend I'm hopping to check out vendors on other servers so they don't try an intervention lol
---
I wish the game would have told me that I couldn't use atom shop me underarmor because I bought the black tactical suit just for BR, and cant equip it. :(
---
No gats are the most common heavy weapon that spawns
---
Just to comment on one thing you said:
---
I just started playing yesterday for the first time on PS4 Pro and it runs flawlessly not "poorly on console" as you stated.  Maybe this is something that was fixed recently?
---
It runs silky smooth and looks beautiful on the Pro.  Much better looking than FO 4 w/ HD texture pack
---
I was surprised at the quality of it and the reaction from other people.
---
Restrictions from the game is 4:8:2000 idk what the 7 is
---
Personally, I would keep 3 points in PER and (eventually) pick up glow sights. Pick up some solid QoL perks like concentrated fire, green thumb, and lock picking first, and then unlock glow sight. You can swap it in when you're running nuke zones, and go back to the QoL perks when you're doing normal stuff.
---
I might move back there tonight and offer services. Bring me junk and I will build something out of it. Offer something in return and maybe I’ll make it better. &lt;Wink&gt;
---
I have to clear out my junk holotapes and stash anyways. So I need to buy booze on the way home from work. 
---
Xbone gt: Gr8dne42
---
grats, i guess
---
Wish it was real! Extra large nuke zones would be amazing
---
Cranberry bog would be awesome, all the little trenches over the area would make some decent challenges spotting the enemy
---
I suck at PvP and won two matches last night; one as a team and one solo.  If you go in with the idea of surviving rather than death match you can easily make it to the top 5/10 each match.  The xp rewards are SUBSTANTIALLY higher for top 10/5/1.
---
Just survive.
---
The only OP thing that I think needs adjusted is that stealth boys last 30 seconds, when you get towards the end of the match and the final fire line is closing in, that is pretty much being invisible for the rest of the game.
---
I could be wrong but given everything Bethesda has been through this year I really doubt they'd include the phrase companion in their trailer if it wasn't gonna mean what think/hope it means. I'm hopeful that it's probably still crazy under development and not ready to show off.   
---
Besides, doesn't ESO have companions or pets or whatever? I'm not super familiar with that. Diff game, diff studio--I know--but I think it's def possible for us to get actual companions. Maybe not Fallout 4 level companions, maybe a guns/merc-for-hire type situation. Who knows. But I'm hyped either way. :)
---
You just become a big, easy to hit target. The extra dr doesn’t help at all from my experience. I’ve survived longer when I have marine armor rather than a set of PA.
---
Sure
---
&gt; A power armor skin I don’t own appearing on it
---
I had that one too.
---
Lmao nice strawman
---
I literally got one-shot earlier (admittedly by like a gatling gun or something) because I thought they'd be tougher. Haha.
---
Mixer in thr middle i suggest nukashine and psycho for a wonderful evening of red just pure red and screams who's screams who knows
---
Yeah Travis sucked.
---
Dead in a ditch i hope.
---
To be fair it's squishy as fuck and doesn't take more than two clips of an smg to kill
---
Reviewing it as an RPG, it is pretty... lacklustre.
---
&gt;  most melee weapons are stupidly cheap to repair so you can save yourself 8 perk points and all you have to do is spend 15 seconds at a weapon station every once in a while. 
---
Many melee weapons are also light enough that you can afford to carry a couple back ups, especially if you have martial artist.
---
I will say that I do enjoy how dumb people sound when they say Bethesda's E3 showcase was just full of employees or corporate shills cheering over every little thing...
---
Not like people that attended are more than likely really big BGS fans and are genuinely excited about upcoming games, etc.
---
\[removed\] ????
---
I have. I approach a fight against wood armor very different from a fight against power armor. With wood, you can count on your damage being higher, so my position and movement can be more aggressive than I might be with someone who will take longer to kill
---
I feel the same about it. Whenever I use a PA it get killed quickly. Without i feel more in control. I guess I'll stop using it
---
Really? I'm having not too bad performance. The occassional stutter, yes, but nothing gamebreaking.
---
Took me a few moments to understand what your comment says.
---
A little formatting goes a long way but I appreciate your comment
---
There are non-scoped versions. You just have to find them
---
Had this happen with a renamed and favorited Furious Faster Fire Rate Gatling Gun. It went in accidentally, and the machine refused to let it back out. Expensive lesson learned. Go. Slow. When. Scrapping. Legendaries. Worst part is, I probably would have caught it before scrapping, but the gm decided to randomly un-favorite my stuff. Which I've been noticing happening occasionally recently after the Project Paradise update.
---
Ah fucking mobile. I totally hit return and had those all on new lines when I posted it...
---
Decently priced fusion cores and ammo. Acid, lead, adhesive, plastic, ballistic fiber and screws for junk. Flux sells well if the price is reasonable. Damage buff consumables and stimpaks. Weight and damage reduction armor move well. If you are close to a train station legendaries for script can sell well if cheap enough.
---
You can sell it as bulked only. Maybe list it in your shop for 5-7 caps per bulk or vendor it for 9
---
I have had no issues since the beta on PS4, so idk how it's affecting yours
---
you get some when you complete the lying lowe quest
---
Haha that's how I experienced the PA. I felt super strong and powerful, which ended in me being 3 shot killed. The suit just feels so weak.
---
You should be able to. Or are under armors not allowed like the outfits?
---
&gt; I wish some of the reviewers would take a second look
---
To their credit, some do review games operating as a 'live service' a year or six months later. Maybe some will. There are reviews for No Man's Sky that factor in all the new updates. Hopefully Fallout 76 can be the next No Man's Sky.
---
I wish survival would be that way or a extra hardcore open pvp mode
---
Gunsmith is one for ranged
---
I prefer to not be given anything in a survival game as a noobie. I want to experience the game and being given things feels like cheating to me / isn't fun for me. I could see some people appreciating it though so I can always refuse. Funnily enough when I first started playing like 3 days ago someone was trying to give me stuff and I was like "nah I think I'm good", but they insisted and thought it was weird that I didn't want anything so I just took it, thanked them, and then threw it all out later.
---
Word, I can feel that. Hopefully Wastelanders is a step in the right direction for that, what with speech checks and stuff coming back.
---
what kind of weapon
---
welcome to fallout 76! its a roller coaster ride for sure
---
There a specific crate they spawn in?  I haven't seen anything other than shotguns, lever actions, and laser pistols...
---
It's okay. I think it needs a LOT more polish though and it's still just a battle royale mode, which is to say it's awful for anyone playing without friends.
---
This or at least lower the level lock on some of the lore. I found a holo tape that was locked at rank 101 and some that were even higher. I don't have the time to dedicate myself to both modes.
---
Maybe at the very least they can add the vault to adventure and keep the locks but translate them to adventure levels?
---
Hm, its even buggy. I'll fully stop using it.
---
I'll craft low level armor/weapons and leave them in random containers I come across around the starting area just to add more stuff for new people to pick up. Tend to play Santa with low level legendaries I get also. "Huh got a level 15 legendary handmade, better check the map for someone who can use it"
---
I usually play solo in fallout games, single player ones included. I find factoring in companions into my strategies irritating. With that said, I loved the nuka world system where you could meet a squad at a target destination and storm it with them.
---
Having craftable mods would help.
---
What do you mean?
---
On Xbox, i sell for 1c per and I sell about 10k per week.
---
In the current state it's in it really doesn't warrant wearing it at all.
---
I take all 3 power plants and set up the fusion core producer at each.  I don't usually power up the power plant.  I just build a generator for each. 
---
Just bounce around the map doing the defend missions and take the cores
---
They are atomatic and attached to your atom shop stuff.
---
I made some tower blueprints in adventure mode than I throw down when I know my squad is going to be stationary for a while in NW. It's really handy that they let you use blueprints
---
If you are on PS4, check the power transmission tower just S of Monongah.
---
My camp is there - mine has the bronze lion at the top of the stairs - 
---
 I sell acid in one of my machines.
---
  Have several fusion cores of varying charge at 1c / percent of charge.  I think the lowest I have in there now is 60%.  I don't recall if I have plasma cores in there or not.  
---
I know I have a few in inventory - if I'm in camp, ask me.
---
I know There's another player with a camp there as well; it would not surprise me if that player also sells acid.
---
Games that deserve to be criticised should be. Some people sadly take it too far and think that it becomes 'cool' to hate on the creators personally - getting abusive on Twitter or all that shit. But criticism is important; it drives creators of any media form to do better.
---
Read his post. He said his friends aren't in to Fallout, but NW got them to play.
---
I’m hoping they were holding back on wastelanders.  I want more than 2 factions, and a complex system of karma/reputation for each group.  Can always hope!
---
Gunsmith and Makeshift Warrior depending on what type of weapons we're talking about.
---
My biggest timesink in the mode is the moment after looting a ton of stuff re-favoriting everything
---
Haha thanks! I didn't even know reddit had these little award things lol
---
Happened with a bloodied explosive shotgun! Its name was Blood Clot! You are missed Blood Clot
---
I'm guessing power armor is to hold more stuff, other than that , theyre useless.. They probably make more noise too... Lol
---
The whole point of you having to start from 0 is to even the playing field in battle royal. You can use your normal character for both PVP and PVE but not in battle royal. You have to create one in order to play battle royal. you can bring him to the other modes but he only gains XP in BR mode.
---
I thought I'd be able to charge people and I legit just got slaughtered.
---
Idk man when I submitted an inquiry ticket they informed me it was both...  and that despite they’re y’all of it being temp, they had no timeline for when I could play again.  I’ve missed a metric fuck ton of stuff cause of this BS
---
I mean thats fine really explosive weapons were pretty bad and could really use it
---
... you had to mention the two shot fatman didn't you.... guess its time to pull mine out of my stash and blow some junk up lol
---
Thank you. That’s gonna make things a lot better
---
It has really good defense, so it's not useless. It's very loud, and makes you a target, because people know that it's not OP and you stick out like sore thumb. But it seems to excel in certain situations. It's not flat out over powered for everyone all the time, which is good.
---
Power Armor is good if your perks support heavy weapons. I'm not sure if the [Stabilized perk](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Stabilized) is in Nuclear Winter, but if it is, the armor penetration and accuracy with heavy weapons while wearing Power Armor would be super good. 
---
It also has really high radiation resistance, along with its damage/energy resistance. The hazmat suit has higher radiation resistance, but literally zero damage or energy resistance. PA is the best option for surviving a nuke zone.
---
You cant take off the scope at a work bench? There are weapons benches around the BR game mode.
---
In vats it was showing one damage number, but for one pellet only. I was kind of scratching my head because it was killing enemies with 350hp with one dmg number that said 95.
---
No way.  Everyone would just sit there and punch you. You wouldn’t be able to watch lol. Although the TVs in the game should definitely play NW matches

You're doing the lord's work
---
Nothing. Im done. Played quite a bit but in the end there was nothing to do after you found some decent legendary items. This isnt a fallout game where you get to be creative with a character and take on a challenge. Its a instagram, fortnight mashup with reused FO4 assets.
---
Are you playing on base console? My experience with the game so far has been shocking. I did not expect it to run this bad.
---
You can get plans for many different mounted heads.  I have several on the walls in my workshop in my camp.
---
Thanks, I’m glad to know they are out there.
---
All my TSE rifles are the same...😭
---
Yeah one of the community managers commented on my post and said they’re forwarding it on rn
---
That's suppose to be the added challenge.
---
Hope you like it!
---
Because it’s different it doesn’t feel like the same thing as the other ones it still feels like fallout somehow and fallout emulates survival really well
---
Right. I’m certainly not trying to defend the end game in 76... there’s hardly even enough of one to critique.
---
But it could be worse. Imagine if the only people who could viably kill the Queen or the Imposter Sheepsquatch etc were the people with bloodied builds. At least it’s not that bad.
---
That’s very true, if he’s going bloodied however he would definitely wants to get a good bloodied two hander instead of 2 regular melees  because of that insane damage boost without even thinking about ss/pa.
---
I personally feel like it has a lot more to do with no VATS than anything, but I do agree.
---
I was watching a streamer last night and their team managed to win without firing a bullet. It was pretty hilarious. They were holed up in Fort McClintock, which just happened to be right in the middle of the fire ring. While they were waiting for people get bumped off, the managed to get everything they needed for a nuke and dropped it on last little bit of the map that was exposed while leaving themselves a tiny sliver of space. Nuke dropped and killed off the last remaining enemy players.
---
If you download the Xbox app onto a mobile device you can take a photomode or camera pic, go to gallery in the game menu enlarge the shot and hide UI, then take an Xbox screenshot and save to your device from the Xbox app, from there you can post your pics on social media. Each week on Twitter Fallout has a theme and asks for your photos and pop them in a weekly article called around Appalachia or something like that. Photomode is fantastic fun.
---
My first win was me going kamehameha against two guys and we were all down but I had more timer so I literally won while being 3 secs away from death lmao
---
Meh, once I started leveling up they dont punch me AS MUCH
---
Fair enough.  It’s the lens through which one sees things I guess.  As in, I couldn’t say you are right, but I couldn’t say I am right either.  One has to form some opinion about things in order to navigate through life efficiently, I guess I just see people really form such strongly held opinions that can become antagonistic.  If I could not admit my mind could be changed about something, then I have no chance of changing others’ minds.  This is an aside, but illustrates somewhat of a glaring deficiency I see in how we presume, as a culture, the motivations of others: A lot of these YouTubing game channels felt they were unfairly attacked recently.  They felt like there was a “hit piece” to declare their sole motivation is the evil aspiration of using as much outrage as possible to get views regardless of who it hurts.  They pretty much defend themselves noting they are their for consumer advocacy.  (Is that means what? They can’t be wrong? They are to be trusted? They are actually advocating for consumers?). The obvious cynic would say Bethesda only wants money, and that these youtubers compete to complain the loudest for clicks.  It can be that only one of those is true or both of them or possibly even neither of them.  But a definite bias exists when you feel like your representatives (consumer advocacy youtubers for instance since we are consumers), can behave the same way as the industry yet they always do it “for the right reasons.”  (And I don’t mean you as in specifically you...I am simply proposing behavior has the be checked both ways and given the benefit of the doubt both ways.). If you watch the people mentioned on YouTube, and really look at their content on the outside it may seem like angry rants, (even titled as such), but most of them reveal thoughtful content and analysis.  I can click on their video to see everything and form that opinion.  Similarly, a gaming company like Bethesda may seem from the outside like their actions are solely for the purpose of getting our money.  I can’t click on something to hear them explain themselves as often...but listening to them at E3 is the closest I will get with regards to their motivation.  In either case it comes down to who you trust.  And I am someone from whom trust can be lost, but also be redeemed.
---
You earn Adventure Mode XP and caps in Nuclear Winter.
---
Your Adventure Mode SPECIAL stats carry over to Nuclear Winter (not the cards, but the points).
---
It's the same character and you can bounce between all three modes with it.
---
Lol thanks. I’ve gotten to Overseer rank 19 already. Thought about starting a list of the rewards so that others can see where to get the items that they want but now it’s too late and I don’t remember and no one is even sure if we’ll keep this stuff (I think we will)
---
And it's neither for people that don't like PvP! What now!?
---
I got up to lvl 3, then when I rejoined last night I was lvl 1 again. Which I'm fine with since I just want cosmetics, but meh
---
Awesome!
---
FFS
---
Don’t be so cynical ;)
---
People are actually praising NW? I was so disappointed when it was announced. It already feels like the Royale genre is losing traction and Bethesda adding it seems like a move in desperation.
---
Because remember kids! A shitty decision made by the people who handled the marketing is totally related to the people who developed the game!
---
That's genius and a really great element to add to a BR match.
---
If you would stop switching servers or  idling in the main menu we could actually join you
---
Seriously?? It’s been a day!!!!!
---
I was pleasantly surprised. My expectations were pretty low after playing PubG for a while but I found the mode pretty fun. Only complaint I have is those damn scorchbeasts love to aggro me just like in adventure mode. Kept giving away my position even when players were right beneath it.
---
I mean, just look at this subreddit. People absolutely LOVE it.
---
I've never had any major stutters or lag, just the usual hitches that happen with any game
---
Tonight’s the night to rack up an impressively disproportionate D/K ratio.
---
The info screen specifically says: "*NEW* players will need to create a new character".
---
The character I brought into Nuclear Winter mode last night was a level 3 character I created way back when the game first launched.
---
I then brought her back into Adventure mode and did stuff.
---
Everything you're saying is wrong and I have no idea where you're getting your information from.
---
I am currently working on making the text tags more... amenable to my taste.
---
Is not going to be great but is better than an alphabetical list.
---
Gonna be a long road though because the 'misc' section alone is a fucking mess, not in the mod per-se but in the completely cavalier attitude of the devs toward naming scheme or lack thereof.
---
Either way I hope it will make me feel better, doing something constructive about my grievances that is.
---
They had us in the first half, not going to lie
---
There are multiple dev teams that work on different aspects of FO76.  Your assumption that the development of NW took resources away from improving the underlying game is flawed.
---
What is Jim Sterling's deal anyways?  What's with the puppets and the noises and voices and costumes?  What are the man's credentials?
---
I'm surprised how much I liked it, and how I could just play for 2 hours with a bud. It's a breath of fresh air from constant scavenging, and hyper focused builds that let you two or three shot players
---
Totally agree. I, unexpectedly, love this mode, but the load, load, wait, load aspect is a minor annoyance. I would love to just requeue.
---
Im hoping the new players learn how/where to nuke.  On sunday I had someone nuke garrisons mining co and another who centered the bomb on the Golf Club so most of the potential cobalt flux never became cobalt flux.
---
Also what extra you get when you become overseer?
---
I just got it and got a 12 kill game. It's so broken OP if you have frog legs. It does 100 damage per shot and has a huge blast radius. Got a nuke in the game as well.
---
The keybind issue, yes....I have had that too, and it's annoying as fuck.
---
The weight one.....pff....can't seem to replicate this one.
---
It kinda ruins the experience imo, giving out plans, stimpacks, ammo, and junk isnt all that bad, reduces the grinding for them a bit but getting free high tier weapons and armor right off the bat just makes things too easy in the beginning. (Ik some people dont mind that but ones like me like the challenge, more entertaining)
---
I'm sorry to hear that. :/ How's your internet? I feel like a lot of performance issues ppl have come from their internet. I'm playing on an old base PS4 from like 2015 that I have going straight into ethernet. My brother plays on a slightly newer base PS4. We've got 2 of these PS4's on the same router and don't have any performance issues. I usually only notice terrible performance if I'm on wifi. Sometimes following a new patch performance gets pretty jank regardless but they usually iron it back out.
---
I wasn't spesifically wanting such, but when I heard the rumours, I thought it could well be okay.
---
Did you forget about wastelanders
---
What about vault 63 tho, it’s on the map but u can’t enter it :/
---
Somewhat ironically, I only use vats for unarmed, especially when fighting a mob.
---
please upload it to the nexus when you complete your work.  as is  the current text tag mod is horrible
---
Thats the difference between a 15 minute game, and multi-hundreds going into a well thought out character that does pve
---
Shoot less
---
Not as fast paced as other games in the genre but more thoughtful. I was actually quite annoyed when I heard about the br game mode but was surprised to find it really enjoyable.
---
There are a few things that feel as if they need to be fine tuned but I’m sure it’ll get there.
---
Theyre used to it.
---
Team stack with your friends and join them. No sympathy for the pity party lol
---
I believe this will be the case. Cranberry bog will he a nightmare with no marsupial or jetpacks lol.
---
I liked having a NP companion - mainly to offload some of what I was carrying, 
---
but still have near immediate access to same when needed.
---
Might come as updates to NW mode not instantly on release. Makes sense to take your time and test inside which parts of the map feel the best.
---
It's more to do with needing to have skill to get headshots at medium range rather than seeing VATS above 50% and unloading until your AP is out. Melee teleporting can only happen when your close enough to hit the target anyway.  Sure VATS makes hitting the target automatic with melee but anyone competent with melee should be landing most hits at the distance needed for VATS teleporting to work.
---
Oh god, that'd be dope but I'd be a goner in the Bog! The amount of times I fall in those damn trenches and scramble to climb out... fish in a barrel, lol!
---
I mentioned Wastelanders in the post.
---
Lol what a fool. Almost all the new content we are getting is. PvE...
---
I don’t really think so. It’s a nice break. I’m not wild about it or anything but I’m mainly sticking to adventure.
---
yup busted af..
---
"dick dog.."
---
All you had to do was not bitch about CAMP damage. PVE players played themselves. PVP will always be where the money and long-term popularity will be.
---
Your short term demands resulted in long term consequences :)
---
Hopefully PvE will continue to be supported! :)
---
Sounds like a fix for a previous dupe exploit might be causing this issue.
---
Hoping Bethesda can fix it as i'd hate to accidentally sell any of my armour accidentally
---
Wow.  Thank you for the info!
---
Yep same old issues with heavy weapons and anything that spools up to shoot.
---
That's good to know! Thank you! I would've hate to found out the hard way. :o
---
Yeah. I started playing the game less than 2 weeks ago. It was rare to see a &lt;10 level back then. The first other players I saw in the Forest were level 50 to 100+. Way different in Flatwoods now. I used to have that town almost all to myself.
---
for pipe weapons you need a specific perk dont know how its called in english though
---
Flashbacks to all those hot drops at school in pubg. Good way to combat the jitters I got when I first started. I was always on edge in combat and new to M&amp;K PC shooters. The times when you make it out of the bloodbath alive feel great too.
---
They can easily add new maps for PvP. The main focus of the game will always be adventure mode.
---
Can you actually use the workbenches tho? I feel like I tried one time and didn't have the option available. Didn't spend too much time on that though.
---
it's there - just go to the 76 portion of the website and scroll down the articles until you see it.
---
Yeah.  I could see the Ash Heap being a pain too, since there's so little cover.
---
I *really* wish people would stop speculating this. Empirical data shows it’s not true, and honestly, if more people buy the game for that mode then there’s going to be more income for other DLCs and other game architecture.
---
I have no idea, I just suggested it because I remember seeing a few of them. I will try it out next time I see one.
---
Yeah my legendary explosive guns are the same, but normal explosives like missle launchers and fatmans had a buff
---
I don’t use the downvote button on Reddit, I think it’s dumb and not properly used, so have an upvote friend.
---
Like I said, I’m not in love too, but I’m glad others are, regarding what you said, and it’s true, please note that’s true for most games.
---
People play them then move one to the next thing, Fallout 76 BR won’t be immune to this behavior.
---
we really need something like that since opening the map can take 5 sec to a whole minute if your unlucky 
---
(im sure i have died more that 20 time because of a slow loading map)
---
yeah it's a fun break from the grid of farming legendaries in adventure that many players have been stuck in for months.
---
Never played PUBG or Fortnite but played 2 rounds of black ops battle royal and disliked it so much I vowed never to touch another BR again. That was until Fallout Nuclear Winter, I thought I’d give it a try and I’m loving it, my only gripe is how much time it takes to get into a game and all the grunting from everyone in vault 51 mindlessly punching each other while waiting for deployment but apart from that I’m having a blast
---
And no one plays...... xD
---
Just kidding! But it’s somewhat true, isn’t it?
---
I'm installing F76 for the free week and for some reason my download is stuck at 25.56/25.56 GB. Any fixes?
---
I'm rank 12 and just checked you get stash boxes icons and you get a the actual small blue stash box from BR for adventure mode for your camp
---
. You also get a .44 skin
---
And don’t forget they wanted solo play.. now they have a map to themselves for a while. People always trying to cry about something
---
When I get home I'm dropping my health, getting Adrenaline up for 60% more DMG and popping some drugs to see if it's DMG gets over 4000 - 5000
---
Probably, but I'm not trying it. Not worth poking the bear.
---
Same! This shit gets my heart pumping. Super tense!
---
Yeah, that’s how I found out. I was in an intense fight fight in Sutton, final 3 ppl. Wen to reviver my teammate, the boom, dead
---
Good points. I just feel battle royale has evolved to a full genre, not just the trend.  It can be anywhere. No need to "compare" but I see your point. Pull good things from others. Way of world. 
---
And ping system is not unique to Apex. I've been using those in battlefield for years. And I would love it in NW.  Along with plenty of other QoL like frames and load times and spawn start. Give it 5 seconds before everyone can move. There we fixed the potential "headstart".  We're also day 2 of a sneak peak.  So I'm confident they'll listen to us and make changes. Ping button can be VATs button is best recommendation ever and everyone agrees.  I expect to see it. 
---
I see your point on inventory. Lots of wasted tabs. But it feels right if you play the shit out of 76 like me lol.  One thing I've made a habit out of early in 76, is NEVER go into pipboy mid fight. Pipboy is to plan your next move, but if you see a fight coming and you need your pip, you're not ready.  Prepare ahead for your on the fly switches with hot wheel swap weapon button. 
---
Your last counter point. Yes goal is to get more people. Not necessarily to "win" battle royale genre. The goal is to get more people using an awesome new mainstream feature and game mode. For sure. But long game is get people into fallout universe in general, I feel.  Not just win this battle of the battle royales youtubers and gaming sites like to talk about for clicks. See my angle?  
---
And I'm totally biased to fallout favorite game series ever. But I pride myself on seeing flaws and the reality of situations.  😁😁
---
I seen two low levels at 76 so I decided to pop in give a wave and some items but I got there they were trading to each other and a high level next to them. So I stood there for a moment and got laggy then disconnected. Sooo not noobs but duper’s me thinks. I thought Bethesda cracked down on that? Anyways yeah it’s nice seeing a high influx of new people especially the ones that hated on the game but thanks to the trial find out they love it ❤️
---
I agree with this. A little mad that my lvl220 character with 8 agility and 8 luk cant use some of these must have perks "frog legs and bloody mess each require 9." now i have to level up my character whos already 220 just to make my build better.....
---
may as well start a new character again just for BR. 15P 15A 15L gonna be required i think.
---
Every mode is what we need!
---
I agree completely and I am hoping they learn form this experience and don’t do it in the future. At least they are still working on making it a better game.
---
I’m glad it’s not just me! 😂
---
Yeah I only carried a missle launcher because it was Instigating. Literally needed double DMG to be viable. Not anymore!
---
PvEvP, base building (actual base building), build templates, nukes, story, interesting locale, rpg elements, humor (that isn't cringy and childish), spawn anywhere, damage numbers, base game mechanics like mutations and chems. Probably more I can't think of.
---
you have to remove the file from the data folder "perkcardmanager.ba2"
---
Nah
---
Based on limited info...maybe? I've gotten a "natural" mutation during gameplay and found a serum in a chest. I doubt they suspended normal gameplay mechanics of a 30 minute cooldown between natural mutations, but that would still allow for natural plus a serum. I don't *think* they carry over between rounds; got my natural chameleon in the final seconds of my last match last night so it didn't even occur to me to check if it's still there. The serum mutation was unstable isotope and I don't think I got close enough to anyone to take any melee damage.
---
A lot of the performance drops are when there's a lot of players and stuff going on. I'm thinking it's more server side than console issues.
---
Honestly though haha
---
That’s not what I’m proposing at all. I know plenty of people like both, I’m not contesting that at all. But some people that didn’t like the game before, now do. Directly because of this new game mode.
---
I love the little snarky text when you die. Really captures how I feel.
---
Of course you are, that's all this reddit been saying since launch .
---
 wheel bug +1
---
If I think is worthy I will. I am still looking at the 'make this coherent and inuntrusive' stage.
---
Given that I have never run a text-tag sorting mod I am currently a bit... lost.
---
Its new, people are trying it. Chill out
---
Your argument is nonsense. It’s a logical fallacy called false equivalency.
---
Using your line of “thinking”, anyone who loves BBQ chips should automatically love every single other flavor, because they’re all potato chips, so they’re all the “same”. Wrong.
---
I have despised or been bored to tears with every BR game I’ve been forced to try before. Turns out I like NW. Someone finally developed a flavor I like.
---
I will buy as many nuka colas as I can afford at &lt;10c a piece for my grenadier.
---
Was really looking forward to the free trial.   Naturally figured if i liked it i'd pick up the game.   Problem is for the last hour game keeps crashing on PS4.   I literally can't get out of character creation without a crash.   Guess i'll try again in a few hours.
---
i send you a message im eating now sorry bro.. give me 5minutes and i will try to join you!
---
I love the new mode!!! Let’s me quench my bloodthirst without the risk of wasting my own armor/weps/ammo/junk.
---
LUK and INT.
---
Railway and Lever.
---
Played my first game , ended up against two guys that were clearly a team, one was in PA tanking me while the other sneaks up and shotgun's my \*ss! Not how i expected my first SOLO match too go. -\_-
---
God forbid we enjoy this new mode while we wait for more content
---
It's ok man, me and my brother understand you. I still love survival and adventure better than NW. I hope they will focus on all the modes equally.
---
It isn’t the way Fallout is supposed to go.  Exit Vault.  Figure out what has changed.  Struggle against elements on your own.  Establish yourself.  Survive.
---
It’s now Exit Vault.  Welcome to Disneyland/Hawaii/Fantastic Resort, where all your wishes come true, and all your needs are catered to.  Please don’t hate us.  Be happy.
---
Not sure how I feel about that.
---
Yea it'd be much more entertaining to stand around like fucking mooks...waiting for that dumb timer to tick down
---
Sorry my confusion but are those automatic?
---
I never like shooting bang bang ur dead games, since it came out im playing with couple long time pubg players that are my queen crew, watching them is a joy &amp; there teaching this oldfart new trick.
---
I pray the broadsider was included
---
1 cap.
---
Lol so running around punching people like a moron is entertaining to you?
---
&gt;I thought I'd be able to charge people and I legit just got slaughtered.
---
omg. I just stopped using it. Almost won the last game without a suit.
---
I hear cursing and drinking in the distance it must Europe trying to invade America again
---
Last night in a lobby - there was a billy goat so the entire lobby punched him repeatedly until he gave in! It made me feel really successful.
---
They needed a buff honestly. I used to have several fatmans and always found them lackluster. Used an instigating fatman on a level 40 player that had bounty and taking workshops from lower level players an it took 3 shots at over 1000 damage to down him. First shot was a direct hit with double damage and only took 2/3 of his health.
---
I literally just had this exact same thought, it wouod make way more sense if we could have vault 51 open in normal mode and be able to register for matches inside via a terminal or something.
---
&gt;along with its damage/energy resistance. The hazmat suit has higher radiation resistance, but literally zero damage or energy resistance. PA is the best option for surviving a nuke zone.
---
The radiation benefits are pretty nice. For me personally it's not enough to start using it. I feel much more confident now that i stopped using it.
---
Apologies if I came off as nasty, that wasn't the intent at all.
---
You did answer why you think the character name decision is acceptable. I don't think you understand why it is not or why that decision injures roleplayers or roleplay in general. My question was if anyone asked during this whole pow-wow, and I don't think it was.
---
Roleplaying tools are features in the game that help facilitate roleplay itself. This honestly starts with the character name. Without a viable way to display a character name we are essentially shoehorned into a single character, or multiple characters with the same name.
---
This becomes a problem when you have two characters that are drastically different. I have a friend that has like 5 different characters, all with their own unique backstory and name but I can't for the life of me ever tell which character is which because I only see his account name. This may not make a ton of sense to someone who doesn't roleplayer, but it is ultimately frustrating to not have this knowledge because it changes the way you interact. 
---
We also have no way to differentiate between in character and out of character chat. 
---
Communication is essential to roleplay. We need to know things like who is playing in character and who isn't. We need a way to communicate out of character that doesn't break immersion during an RP session. We don't have anything like that now.
---
We need a more robust emote system that doesn't involve spamming silly animations over our head so we don't just stand there like a stick while trying to RP.
---
We need tools for custom (usually text) emotes so we can show others how and what our characters are doing as part of the story that is being played out.
---
We need tools  like in game mail so we can coordinate and send each other in character letters.
---
There are so many other things I can keep listing that I could go on all day, but I am hoping the point is being made here.
---
I don't think there was a representative there that could or did speak to this playstyle, and why I am upset that this particular method of community engagement was made. I am sure they sincerely listened to you, but I am pretty confident that the things that some of us are actually clamoring for weren't addressed at all.
---
Those icons are ugly and mostly nonsensical. Why someone would need them is beyond me.
---
Hey, thanks! :)
---
Are you seriously salty about this?
---
And without gasmasks.
---
Yea it is...it's entertaining...jesus, it's a few fucking minutes...
---
One of them is me.:D  I'm a 'free' player
---
I agree. I hate BR games but i tried this and love it
---
Yea I even see a lot of babies in survival. I try not to kill the really low ones and kill the maybe lvl20+.
---
They are if you're really fast at... Um... Levering.
---
Not fall damage, no rads, use to block doors/warp, melee... Playing devil's advocate here...
---
Here's my load out when I'm going into nuke zones or SBQ fights. It's not a "pure" melee build, but I feel it's much more versatile.
---
Key differences:
---
* STR: Ditching traveling pharmacy and shifting a couple points into shotgun related perks gives you the ability to knock cancer bats out of the sky rather than standing around waiting for them to land. It was also helpful for taking out other small flying creatures during the time when melee VATS was broken against them, but that seems to have been fixed.
---
* PER: sacrificing 1 point in glow sight is worth it to have the ability to VATS lock on SB wings. 
---
* END: 2 points in fireproof is enough to mitigate 90% or more of the scream attacks, as well as protecting you from randomly exploding cars are Whitesprings.
---
* CHR: Pretty much the same, but I have 7 points so I can leave Travel Agent equipped full time. I don't really need it, but I can't think of any compelling reasons to move that point anywhere else, so it's there for now. 
---
*INT: I run with 8 points vs your 11. PA is ridculously durable already, so Power Patcher isn't worth it IMO. The only other difference is that I run 3 makeshift and 2 gunsmith to keep my shotgun from breaking too quickly.
---
* AGL: most things die in 1-2 swings anyway, so I opted to put a point into enforcer at the expense of adrenaline or action boy. Again, the extra cripple chance helps tremendously with taking SBs out of the sky, and it's also handy for things like crippling the acid spitters on mirelurk queens.
---
* LCK: This is the same as yours. I swap out luck of the draw for serendipity when I'm not in my PA.
---

---
I would also like to know. That helmet is badass
---
I can understand and be disappointed by decor being locked behind the BR content (I hope it's BR themed and not all-around themed...like a BR statue for example) but locking story behind multiple hours upon hours of BR grinding is gross.
---
The first thought I had when I read this was coming was: this is gonna be pointless for shotguns and high ROF weapons...*unless you''re recording!* So, that's how I'm going to use this tool.  At least once I'm done with finals today!
---
Ok, no problem will wait
---
I’m not salty about it.
---
Just swapping the Rifleman for Commando perks?  Auto handmade is pretty good.  I prefer it to combat and assault.
---
Shhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Then do it. Why do you care what others do, man?
---
Chems. Pretty sure most players don't use them, for some reason.
---
I have played the major BR games out there (Fortnight, Apex, Blackout, PubG) but out of all the BR games I’ve tried Firestorm and this one seem to click with me. honestly the only complaint I have so far is that I wish the XP was a little bit more and I wish that the play area was just a tiny bit bigger, right now when you play with a team it just feels like one or two guys get all the loot and everyone else is screwed
---
This is what you get when you find the bunker with the TSE nuke.. 1st hit direct damage and the 2nd huge area damage 🙃
---
The bog would be insane. Long, open fields with incredible amounts of mobs.
---
Both have to be in main menu go to social invite to team leader join game
---
I'm liking it and I don't usually like this kind of thing so yeah Bethesda did good with this new mode.
---
One gripe tho we should get points for assisting kills, I whittled down one player and another from my team killed him but I didn't get any points for helping out
---
PC. I kinda wonder what's the highest rank on each system who've never launched.
---
I logged in to see that and thought the same thing so I quick travelled nearby.  It did not appear to be nuked.
---
Its nothing anyone asked for, yeah. But have you seen the sub today? There's plenty of people defending it.
---
I dont like BRs all together, I wont be playing it. Im just pointing that its more well recieved than you give credit.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6lu7jIlXd5clSzKJ23Inza/atomic-shop-patch-10-items-and-sales
---
It isn’t anything that hasn’t been done in other games.  You set fixed values for damage and armor in PvP then scale the players to the relative level 50 values.
---
 Basically, when you enter PvP, the game ignores your overall stats and treats you as a level 50 using the level 50 weapon and armor values from NW.
---
thats funny, me and my friend talked about this yesterday while playing, he said he wanted the mire, but because it was so flat it wouldn't be fun, and i told him the ash heap because it added another map with a level of eleveation
---
yesssss!!! This would make it sooo much easier to see.   imagine if we could get skins for them to!   help atom shop $$
---
I don’t care lol
---
They do not carry over.
---
I made a post earlier as it happens, it said “there a 2 types of dwellers in vault 51, those that read terminals, adjust their perks etc doing something constructive and those that mindlessly punch each other” the sound of all that grunting is too much and I take my headset off during lobby’s now. Reddit is exactly where I am during lobbies along with a little twitter too lol 😂
---
It's just you.
---
Play adventure mode?
---
it could be nice but at the same time people would have even less chance to retrieve they dropped junk
---
Yea I'm talking about changing the order. I want my close range weapon to always be number 1 on the keyboard. It is at the moment difficult to do that.
---
Oh there still is Stealthboy spam. Pack a grenade launcher just in case.
---
I'm confused... then why did you make this post?
---
Yes. I had to take off all my mods to play.
---
I’ve tried it for a couple of days. Back on adventure. It was kinda fun but still not my thing.
---
yeah, t60 and hellfire are definitely coming to Nuclear Winter. but no word on the rest unfortunately
---
Don’t forget the 50 cal
---
I either sit at the bar or play the slot machine right behind the bar while everyone else runs around punching each other like idiots
---
Yeah of course not... It sure looked like it though.
---
We might in the trailer it showed the before armour so I'm not too sure how one obtains it though
---
A nuke is completely different. So based on your stance, I’m assuming you’re are someone who doesn’t help the team because they are so focused on finishing kills they can’t contribute anything. If a player bleeds out should they get the kill because they are the reason they died? Your logic is absurd.
---
Furious Radium.
---
Because you guys crack me up and act like 10 year olds
---
Just like cars vs horses :)
---
Dude go to lucky hole mine with excavator armor. I use handmade rifle so I do know what you mean. 12 lead gets me 36 bullets, enough to kill like a handful of enemies only so I was always running out, went to lucky hole mine and ended up with 1000+lead scrap and I've only been there once when I was under lvl 50, I'm over lvl 70 now and have 73 bulk lead. I've crafted thousands of bullets since and still just never run out of lead since I just pick up all the lead I come across and have stockpiles to rely on from my one trip to lucky hole. Next time I'm going is just to farm lead for sale cuz at the pace lead sells here idk why noobs don't just farm caps from the mine basically
---
Ok, those are benefits indeed. Thanks for the list! I'm not sure if it's enough for a BR mode.
---
I just sleep on the beds. Then some... kind... dweler come in and start punching me....
---
Crazy world.
---
Some players told me that you can use Vats to teleport to your target in melee, even through walls? sounds really strange but I imagine it could be handy at times.
---
Use the Nukes and Dragons char builder. Select the perks you want, this will determin the stats you need.
---
The calc then gives you an idea which perk to take at which level.
---
Think whatever you want
---
 ***Furious stacks at a rate of +20% each hit to a max of +80%***, Confirmed this on 3 separate Weapons. 
---
Damn. I need a new weapon apparently. This is better than bloodied max damage yeah?
---
Nah, i leave anyone under 30 alone unless they need help or attack.
---
That is a great system too.
---
I’ll keep you company in adventure mode, that’s the only mode I play too!
---
I’m sure more will be added. Perhaps armor slotting between the three regular ones and maybe power armors slotting above the current one. 
---
Right now I guess it’s just a test phase for balancing and whatever else.
---
Is this confirmed anywhere?
---
once we are higher level, i think there are things in the rooms that you'll want time to interact with. I know there are instruments somewhere, and getting "well tuned" is tricky if there isn't time.  (unless you don't actually get the perk, then who cares).
---
You can't fix stupid
---
I bet they're spending most of their time reading Reddit and laughing at us. /sarcasm 
---
FYI they have been busy af... Be patient and stop whining. They can only do so much.
---
I mean enjoy the game if you want but it is absolutely a good thing that Bethesda is getting all this hate. They deserve it, fuck them for thinking they could get away with all the garbage the tried to pull. Hopefully they learn their lesson and actually give some semblance of a shit next time
---
How do you have your screen set up. Something to try see below.
---
Windowless Border mode will cause FPS issues unless you manually go into the .ini file and change iPresentInterval to 0. (This really shouldn't still be an issue it was reported since beta).
---
Fun!
---
TBH I go to survival and farm players for aid and their junk. I'm a terrible person.
---
It is pretty amazing.  Everyone is running to the safe zone, then the warning erupts and the countdown starts and you book it back towards the collapsing fireline.  Chaos at its best.  Pray you have the stimpacks and radaway to outlast the others.
---
For me the main reason I'm playing it now is cause its a one week limited pre-beta opportunity. Artificial scarcity. When the eventual beta and final versiona release my percentage of NW vs Adventure Mode will adjust significantly in favor of Adventure mode.
---
Ha! When have the Minuetmen ever come across as anything resembling cool?
---
Agreed, I was quite disappointed to find I could not explore it.  Perhaps add a terminal option to jump into Nuclear Winter mode, but add some lore and stuff about.
---
Yes, me and a freind saw them and I was laughing for ages
---
Gather up some bloodleafs and soot flowers (the blue ones)
---
Soot flowers are found a lot around the starting area
---
Bloodleafs are found along bodies of water like rivers and ponds
---
Get some boiled water and make some healing powder
---
im at your camp. wheres the acid in the machines?:p cant find it..
---
Most of the people who hate the game, have never played it.
---
Don't you need acid to melt it down or something
---
what is better?
---
Exactly!!! I just wanna explore and learn on my own, like the fallout I love! I dont want to need to play Fortnite to get that.
---
I did pick a fairly popular spot it seems.  I was also a little miffed about that dude's accuracy.  I know there is no VATS.  So how the hell did he find me so easy and how did he pop pop pop me three times in the face as I was panicking and running for cover.  I guess some people just play ALOT!
---
I agree. Only the pre-game thing (the waiting room or whatever it's called) takes too long for me. All about 5 min.
---
Played it. Hated it.  Suffers from the same negatives as other BR games. Hopefully it will further section off the asshole PvP population, which can be a good thing.
---
Good! Makes them worthy of using finally.
---
Adventure. Survival mode is mostly cancer. I’m a level 80 and i get owned every time.
---
You cannot use them
---
Man for real. I try to find a quiet, isolated spot in the vault to avoid all the idiots running around making so much fucking noise. 
---
I like the zen garden area a lot. I’ve taken some pretty nice pictures around the vault too. Like come on, surely these people are more creative in finding ways to entertain themselves besides spamming a button literally doing nothing but annoying headphone wearers.
---
Pretty sure you receive some adventure mode XP and caps after each round ?
---
I play adventure as survival makes me a swirling mass of anxiousness..
---
I reckon 30s
---
The .44 pistol wrecks shit if you're a good shot
---
I am all for this. Loving NW and don't really want to keep switching modes just to do the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. thing.
---
I really hope they do make maps that feel fun and enjoyable much like the forest one we have now, it plays well, keeps games fairly fun and interesting and never disappoints
---
I think when the “preview” is over, it will be accessible in A/S modes.
---
&gt; they're two different teams
---
While that seem logical on how to handle development, is there any souce/statement from bethesda that this is actually true?
---
Adventure, by far.  Outside of workshops, if you're in Pacifist Mode, no other player can hurt you.  In Survival, it's basically a free-for-all, and with Legendary weapoms/armor, it tends to come down to whoever shoots first.
---
I tried that yesterday over and over. Let’s say I crapped out quick. Then I quit. Then I would try to join up to a server but it would say found server.... vault boy would rigorously give multiple thumbs up for a minute. Then say disconnected.  Have to keep trying. It seemed like when the other match was over that’s when it would allow me back into 51. I dunno if it was just me or a bug.  Going to try more tonight. 
---
On a positive note. This battle rials isn’t as bad of a shitshow as I thought it would be!  I have had multiple matches and a lot of fun doing it!
---
I got a gatling laser from a locked crate, and a briefcase from a terminal.
---
I found radiation suit too.
---
I picked this game up on Saturday and was playing and someone put one of these down and neither of us had voice so i had no idea what the bag was. I would agree it would make more sense that It would be a larger bag like a duffle bag or something more easily visible.
---
Exactly and that’s what I’m doing. Messing with cards and looking around the vault and then I look to my left and there’s like 20 gorillas mindlessly punching each other in a big crowd. It’s just stunning. People don’t even act like that in the Fortnite lobbies lmao
---
Do you know when the full version comes out?
---
It’s actually really good. I hate 99% of BRs but I’m actually loving this one.
---
been watching people stream it all day. Until I get home
---
to soon? nah
---
I legit have no idea what your talking about 
---
Open launcher/pick 76/ play
---
Options to turn off contorler.
---
Crosshair needs to be on target for hit to register. Even if the weapon appears to hit, the crosshair is the hitbox.
---
I'm sinful I kill everything that moves on matter what it is
---
I just need a fucking team. Playing solo doesn’t work. You’d have to be a tank. 4v1 is never going to go your way in most cases. They need a solo only version and a team version.
---
yeah, i believe it’s the best thing that’s been added to the game
---
Adventure. Survival is fun sometimes and you gain xp faster but I’m all about adventure
---
I mean, the game's been out for 7 months and they've been spending their time doing content updates... It's not like they haven't had the time to address this.
---
What’s entertaining about it, dead honest question
---
On the consumer side, I'd imagine a few of the bashers want to rail against some practices they view as detrimental that they want developers to view as shitstorm fodder so it doesn't become a common industry practice.  These would be the people I understand most.
---
Then there are the Youtubers, both creators and the viewers who feed them, who crave controversy, and therefore viewership.  There seems to be a whole subset of review videos where the reviewers focus predominantly on products they characterize as poorly made and a waste of your money.  I would guess that the larger "video game news" sources have pretty much the same idea and the most egregious offenders have been proving for years that they don't give half a shit about the games themselves or the accuracy of their own content.
---
Then fuck off pal
---
I play more adventure. Well... I ONLY play adventure.
---
Stealth boys are crazy powerful, especially if you can use them to flank an enemy that thinks they've got your team pinned.
---
I have been playing other games since December. I want to get back on my main character and play how I have been. I've even tried a new character to relive what I enjoyed at launch. But I'm still having issues sinking hours like I have with previous fallout games.
---
Thank you for that perspective, I am mostly angry at the bugs/performance.
---
*nearby*
---
Honestly op sounds a bit immature
---
as you said...i can't wait to do a queen and see what actually outputs the most damage...  prime tse 50cal.... prime aae gatling plasma..... or prime aae minigun! #forscience
---
Honestly I thought I’d never play it, I don’t play other BR games and I don’t play survival but gave Nuclear Winter a try today and I’ve been playing it for hours. Even managed to win twice. Racking up shit tons of adventure xp too which I didn’t expect, I’ve levelled up a few times through it and the gameplay is getting my heart pumping.
---
I’m really glad it’s all a (mostly) level playing field, it’s a weird feeling being in the lobby seeing so many other vault dwellers.
---
Adding on this, we should be able to permanently talk to our teammates. It's so weird to go back to main menu and have complete silence when were teamed up 👍
---
Honestly it is what survival mode should’ve been, minus the storm and permadeath
---
The codes are not for today? I need a code for Alpha, 11th June
---
You have to put your crosshair on the targets hitbox and they have to be in range when you swing.
---
licensed plumber
---
Adventure mode. That's the only one I play.
---
Just new here, and I think that is the only event I have done so far.
---
But this one a handful of times by now...
---
I haven’t had any major stutter problems except for a quick one when you quick switch to a build item.
---
Good points.
---
I LOVED running into players and trying to talk to them. And "living" at workshops... until the server crashed and I lost it all..
---
Tesla rifle is fun in full auto. As is the railway rifle with the right receiver.
---
I have a handmade (big enemies), combat rifle (usual stuff) and pipe rifle (weak stuff) while sneaking. When I feel like going loud, I put on my T-60 PA and use my tesla or railway rifles.
---
Quad tesla and railway rifles are great for sustained fire. Vampire ones for survivability.
---
Mostly adventure, survival for the weekly weapon rewards
---
But yeah survival is 90% the same as adventure but it's a PvP free for all, when you die you lose all your junk and a random amount of aid items
---
it was mostly a joke lol
---
That's the plan either way!
---
So much this. 
---
We're essentially at the pat on the back phase. 
---
Bethesda: "hey look guys I cleaned up the mess I made!"
---
Customers: "aww. Good job buddy. Its not fully clean and some things aren't in the right place but good start! Just don't do it again"
---
Bethesda: "Oh don't worry I won't. I know it still doesn't look the best but here I made a list of how I'm gonna finish cleaning! Also I had time to draw you a cool picture!"
---
Customers "Thanks for the picture bud. The list looks good please stick to it and finish cleaning. Also don't make another mess"
---
I give them credit fot what they've acheived so far but I'll never forget the initial product.
---
I actually don't punch in lobbys, I just really don't like ur attitude
---
when i press tab it doesnt do anything the news tab wont dissapear thats the problem
---
All heavy mashineguns are OP. Then there is middle clas of weak rifles and some laser shits, in the end is fucking everything scoped, because those are fucking trash
---
It's the lowpocalypse.
---
Yeah no guarantee that you will end up where you want to but it has worked in the past
---
😂😂
---
You should be able to invite them to a team in the main menu. I had a problem where I couldn’t invite or join teams so I went to dashboard and relaunched the game and that seemed to fix it
---
Press b on the controller... nothing happens for you?
---
It has better DPS than the gatling, it's MUCH more accurate at long range than the gatling, and I think it even weighs less than the gatling
---
Getting this thing is an easy win, especially now that I have the heavy gunner perk
---
Are u running in fulscreen? Windowed mode has always been fucked
---
In the main menu hold the button to bring up your friends menu in game and invite to team from the main menu before you go into NW
---
Lol there are currently two gorillas punching people onstage trying to play the instruments too
---
I mean. It still is fallout.. I'm sure I could get back on and just explore.. it's just, I recall so many places being lackluster.
---
Agree agree agree. Try telling *them* that though.
---
Oops lol I read it wrong. I thought it said non-automatic. Still though, an automatic railway is a top tier weapon. Lever is semiauto. I have a QE Railway that demolished any bullet sponge enemies and an IE Railway that 1-shots all common infantry..
---
The loot balance is very static and the game mechanics are not build for battle royal. But this is an amazing model for what we could see later this fall. I hope they take these next few months to make it into a competitive and challenging battle royal.
---
I guess nuclear winter by my friend list
---
Just downvote and move on
---
yeah when i do that nothing happens thats the problem
---
Push whatever tab is on a controller then.
---
Tbh id just unplug and then throw away that controller. Then restart the program.
---
Lol. Hey a chance to get close to a stash is all I ask :-)
---
This is the internet in a nutshell.
---
Instant bitching.
---
When you come across that item in the game, you'll have that skin applied to it.
---
Same is true of outfits you favorite, at least until you find armor.
---
I was not interested at all.
---
Until I started playing it.
---
Right. You guys keep crying on Reddit about how someone punched your digital avatar in a videogame.
---
As for the br mode... I'll have to try it. Fallout 76 didn't have the best combat.
---
Take a guess...
---
A lot who I’ve seen said “no we don’t want or need a br” have been saying “wow this is fun”
---
What comes after everything has burned and turned to ash? Nuclear Winter
---
We knows lol. I wish it would drop forest though
---
I think the idea of a dedicated NW character is very visble. If only your cards carried over between accounts
---
I think for me what makes it enjoyable is that there's no pressure. Some other game, that's all there is to it. You suck? Too bad. You suck at the entire game. This one if you suck, you go back to playing adventure for awhile, regain your confidence, practice taking on ghouls without VATS, then come back when you're bored to get your ass handed to you again in 30 seconds.
---
That’s cool
---
In reality that time is there so players can adjust their perk card layout and to talk strategy with their team. I do agree if I'm not doing any of that then yeah, it seems like an eternity to wait.
---
I thin it's because they do different amounts of healing / have different stats in NW vs. adventure mode. Might be easier for devs to name them that IDK.
---
exactly!
---
Better chance at you winning then lol
---
It I how you change your appearance in the battle royale mode. You can only use atomic shop items.
---
yeah when i unplug the controller and use keyboard it still says press B (tab on keyboard) and when i restart it still says press b and when i reinstall the game it still says press b
---
I will put any spare accid in the vending machines from now on. So in case you are in need again and happen to be on the same server just hop by. And everything in the acid generator machine is for free of course. I don't lock anythinmg, so help yourself.
---
No you are you not.
---
You know you had to say something stupid if you're getting downvoted on a post like this.
---
Yeah, this whole week is going to be... interesting.   Most servers, a good 3/4 of the population is under Lv. 10.
---
I don't know why but anytime I fire an automatic at someone it just stops firing after hitting them once even though I'm holding down the trigger
---
This is not true
---
I hate it. 
---
It would be nice to see all the bugs fixed in the game before other game modes. It's like they detracted from fixing their fucked up adventure mode to appease the easily entertained.
---
NW is fucking fortnite. Fallout Fornite.
---
Well one of the hubs is in toxic Valley so we might get more stuff there.
---
What bothers you about it?  dead honest
---
What bothers you about what people do for 2 minutes prior to a match?  They can't damage you, they literally can't interfere with ANYTHING else you want to do...
---
So what bothers you about it?  againb...dead honest question...
---
Also playing on the old "fat" PS4, and it's mostly fine.
---
I mean, it's not a fast paced FPS, but I guess it never was and never will...
---
Slower pace. You have more room to breath, plan and strategise. More balanced. No one shot nonsense. And probably the most realistic in terms of atmosphere and gear.
---
Yea.  My brother is like this, he has to cheat at everything in life.
---
You get 2 - 3k exp a game, will level up fairly quickly to then go use your special points in adventure mode
---
You may have enjoyed it, but TLJ had no respect for the established canon and abused the everloving shit out of subverting the audience's expectations.
---
Fight me.
---
So far I only like the firestorm BR modes because they were added to games I already liked (NW and Firestorm in BFV)
---
I feel like Schwarzenegger in Kindergarten Cop 😱😱😱
---
Vault suit, eyeglasses and party hat's galore. 
---
There is at least five of them around 76 on every server I've been on. Really nice to see actually.
---
You're right. I've just been out of the loop and craving more fallout. But ive played so much 3, NV and 4. 76 feels like my best option to get my fix.
---
I only hear a low beeping or pulsing noise. Thats without any related perk cards equipped.
---
I played 5 matches and after, a random team member sent me a message to “Quick fucking playing this game you faggot”. It felt right at home to the experience.
---
7 wins lvl 15: Keep your teamates alive at all cost, unless your some kind of god your not gonna solo two attacking squads. Hazmat suits are great in the event of a nuke drop. Communication is key
---
OP must be fun IRL
---
Assuming he has a RL
---
Why not?
---
Survival mode is absolutely amazing if you ain't a noob in PvP and/or maths, but its extremely complicated, requires dozens if not hundreds of hours of learning, tip top build, cooperating team, and an organisation within which the loot is shared to effectively gear up the whole team.
---
This makes it a terrible abomination for people who expect to play it like a regular old shooter, which it simply ain't. They place a good headshot from their garbage builds and complain it doesn't work, or they go melee in a fight thats happening on 200 meters distance and die like NPCs they seem to roleplay, I don't know who comes with a knife to a gunfight and expects victory, but they won't be good judges of reality around them.
---
As a result, I suppose Survival has less than one percent of Adventures playerbase. To me Survival is true, real and uncensored version of this game, by which Adventure feels bland and boring, but if you are here for afterwork relax or social interactions, its a better choice to go Adventure.
---
You can switch modes at any time with all your stuff and characters.
---
Legendaries are effects added to weapons and armor pieces (you can mix and match different armor in adventure and survival) that drop when you kill Legendary enemies or some bosses. Unless you get them through a quest, the drops are always random and different for each player. 
---
They can be subtle like a *1 star level 30 Mutant Slayer’s Pipe Pistol* that basically just does 15% more damage to super mutants or they can be god weapons like a *3 star level 50 Bloodied, Two-shot, Explosive .50 cal Machine Gun* that would do more damage the less health you have and fire two explosive rounds every shot. Most god weapons do hundreds of damage points per hit but, depending on your perks, you can easily do over 1k per hit. 
---
A lot of players like that they’re not included in NW because one-shot kills kind of ruined Survival Mode. Personally, I love Survival! It’s more challenging than Adventure Mode and dying has more real consequences among other things.
---
Your keyboard and controller is broke. Super broke. If you cant input a command idk what to tell ya
---
That's excellent. I didn't even attempt to since I assumed they straight up removed it.
---
Seems....unlikely.
---
Wonder if it was mine lol. I made like 7 friends yestersay with mics and we won 3 games
---
Brand new character.....every BR match
---
Or the cranberry bog so you can fall in trenches and take rads every 3 seconds
---
Compared to the "flawless" handling the rest of the game has had since launch.....
---
It is just another strike against the systemic failures of the parent company in general.   This game was created to be a complete cash-grab for investors, developing as little as possible to see what they could get away with.  And if the fanboys in this sub had their way, the could have stopped any sort of efforts on launch day.
---
Come back in Fall, when the new expansion releases with human npc's with stat check dialogues, it might just ignite that fallout spark again for you.
---
Give the nuclear qunter mode a try, its surprisingly very fun. (Bad teammates are everywhere, but that's online gaming for you!)
---
Why don't you play it and find out
---
I’m going to nuke Whitesprings and have the whole place to myself lol!
---
Everything I believe....Wins, time survived, kill players, kill creatures, everything.
---
Is there any good way to tell if my headset is functioning right/anyone can hear me?
---
Adventure by a lot.  I'd say there are very few pure survival players so adventure winds up being the entire PvE-only crowd as well as people who play both modes.  Adventure is the "original" game mode and the one most casual players are most familiar with.
---
If you're brand new to the game I'd highly recommend against Survival.  There have been many duplication exploits, particularly shortly after the game came out, and powerful gear that is supposed to be exceedingly rare was very easily obtained in December/January.  As a result survival mode for those without the powerful gear is dying in under a second while dealing practically no damage if you happen to get the first shot off.
---
with other games my keyboard and controller work fine its onlu fallout 76 what is acting up strange. so i think the problem is not my keyboard or controller
---
Sometimes, not always, the game you really want is the one you never asked for.
---
Thanks. I stopped playing around the time they added the ability to remove rocks and trees from your camp. I've seen the updates download on my PS4 but never really opened the game to look 
---
I feel I missed so much even just atom shop items. 
---
Didn't they have a limited time event?
---
Sounds like v-sync is on.
---
So true. 600+ hours, still don't have full ass/sent set. I do finally have amazing PvE gear though.
---
Voice chat has been really buggy lately. I've had times where I can't hear anyone and other times they can't here me. I'd wait a bit before buying a new controller.
---
noontime to be precise
---
AH OK, I have to completely deactivate the perkcardmod to be able to use perk cards again. What a pity. I will then wait until this mod will work again.
---
I wish I would have ended up in your shoes. I was excited to be the highest level in the server for weeks and wanted to be an avid player. Something just really pushed me and my team away.
---
Glitched into Wooby's room and caught a permaban
---
Go get em slugger. PUNCH  PUNCH PUNCH. Drool drool drool
---
I understand that people want to see more of this vault but you gotta remember, when this update is complete and sent out well be looking at vault raids. So it might be in the full update but if not people can get their fill with other vaults.
---
I didn't create a topic crying about something that doesn't affect me in the slightest...
---
Bloody is 80% as well without the stack requirement.
---
Ahhh I see it now! I was looking and some people it just says add or join. Finally found one that said invite to team :) thanks! I thought I was crazy haha
---
Should be off work in about 2 hours.
---
yeah i searched the hole internet but nobody had the same issue thanks for the help but i think im just going to contact bethesda support. thank you for you're time
---
Oh yeah I definitely agree with that, would be nice to just press which number you want in the pip boy or something like that.
---
Don't complain about it lol.
---
Yay another retcon...
---
After playing NW I’m actually tempted to try survival.
---
Buddy, they let fully geared adventure mode toons into Survival.
---
How in the wide wide world of sport is this worse?
---
Do they recoil in horror when they first see you? “Please, don’t hurt me!”
---
I assumed wrong...
---
Love gifting the vault babies with modded out low-level weapons, food, and water. Someone did it for me early on so now I like to pay it forward.
---
It's not too bad on mine. There are lag spikes at white springs, but it's pretty much OK everywhere else.
---
Not only this, but the way people talk about it. I hear people talking shit about the game a bunch and always ask "Well have you played it recently?" and most of the time they didn't even try it to begin with.
---
No such problem on my slim.  Try replacing the drive with a SSD. Makes a massive difference to fast travel, door transitions etc.
---
Ma Duce is Queen Bitch.
---
At this point you’re easily distinguished from low-level mules.
---
My wife (who was my main team member) feels the same way. When I tell her about how I want to get back into it. She reminds me that it doesn't stack up to any of the singleplayer games.
---
Not Necessarily, from what I hear (I'm not a Bloodied Build) but Bloodied is still the most damage of anything, as long as you don't mind getting killed by Ants &amp; Ticks all the time.
---
Your team mate needs to at least hit the monster once
---
Yah, I come jumping in there all 330 levels of me and they are like roaches with the lights on. But after some gift emojis and much ammo wasted shooting my paper bag they get it.
---
Why would I put ssd in ps4. It doesnt even support sata3.
---
Because it's a huge download for me right now
---
That's unfortunate??
---
He has to get at least one shot in on the enemy to share the xp with you.
---
I think your friend has to at least slap one enemy?
---
It was added to the Creation Club a bit ago.
---
Just know it's very imbalanced and meta heavy. You will get one shot and do little dmg without a good build.
---
I play and have always wanted BR, I've talked to other people who have wanted BR , but it's a big internet out there though.
---
Some xp gets shared when your team mate completes tasks like lockpicking, but both players must dmg the enemy to get Xp for the kill.
---
You get xp as long as you tag an enemy before it dies but it's best to get a few hits as hit registration has been buggy lately. Only exception is usually large creatures at events and such.
---
It's their mtx honey pot.
---
Why can't fruit be compared?
---
I tried PUBG and did not enjoy it. I've been playing the shit out of this
---
Nope. Gotta attack it to get xp. They do get items for free without hitting it if they are close enough to the team mate that killed it when it happened.
---
Welcome to fallout 76. Nice of you to join us
---
Look you can think I’m crying or mad or whatever. The only salty and mad one here is you. You literally can’t help but reply to every single comment I made even if it’s to someone else in this thread. Seems I offended your PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH lifestyle.
---
I don’t care to be compelled to go in nw to grab a perk or something for adventure that is only available by playing nw. I prefer the separation
---
Explosive rounds I trust :)
---
Ooo unlucky lol, I was a bit nervous about my camp appearing on the map due to my vending machines so I’ve put them on a separate power circuit now with a switch so I can temporarily turn them off if a good weapon comes up in survival lol
---
I made a few lvl 1 BOS sniper rifles and deep pocketed leather chest pieces (chest also counts for atoms when making leather armor mods overall).   
---
Dropped a bunch of water to individual players as well!   
---
Hope they all pay it forward and make the game awesome!
---
Only once by accident when there was a PA chassis dupe big, and I deleted the spare because I didn’t need it and stash space was only 400.
---
I can't wait for it to release! They chose the one week out of the whole year I won't be at my PC, so I won't get to play it :(
---
Any other way to go? Lol 😂
---
Yeah for sure. Id also be fine with once there's 52 players they just start the game. I'm all for exploring vault 52 but just put that in adventure mode because even for the two minutes that it's there it isnt really enough to get into the lore.
---
Really? I use the ps4 pro but with a 4k TV. Last time I played, (over a month ago) the framerate and textures were not that great.
---
I think I'll get on just to see how it runs. Thank you.
---
If you had taken as much time to do a few internet searches or redit topic searches as you did typing all this and reading the replies you'd know the game is way more stable than it was 7 months ago and alongside the content updates we have been getting a very steady stream of bug fixes and performance updates.  The game has come a really, really long way.  It still isnt perfect and may never be but the improvements are night and day.
---
Ah OK, no need to trade in my baby then. Anyone done testing with Junkies? Curious if my J25 UGL was a worthwhile purchase.
---
PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH drool drool drool
---
You both have to get shots in
---
I had a jetpack and someone stole it from me during a trade recently :(
---
The balance is great. Sure some guns/armor will give you a slight advantage, but you always have a chance to win depending on tactics and the fact that the time to kill isn’t insanely long but also no one shots like you said. 
---
There’s a lot of opportunities to experiment with how you approach conflicts from positioning, guns, camping. You won’t get rushed down as often like Apex, making positioning practically useless. And you won’t die in 1-3 shots like PUBG, giving you a chance to retaliate. 
---
The terrain is probably my favorite aspect. It feels like an actual fight for survival in a realistic setting. Really forces the player to be aware of their surroundings as anyone can sneak up on you through the bushes or snipe at you from the hills. 
---
In a sense, the mode is easier than other BR’s while at the same time requiring actual skill and smart actions to survive and win. 
---
Just kinda emphasizing all the points you’ve made. I agree completely.
---
Lol nope
---
How’s that radium rifle? I never used it
---
Adventure because open-world PvP is daunting to a lot of people. The game even recommends it as the 'classic Fallout 76 gamemode'.
---
I may regret selling my FE Gatling before this is over.
---
&gt; First thing to understand is that FO76 survival is NOT like FO4 survival. 
---
Fallout 76 adventure is actually like FO4 survival.
---
Tried that, but some high level assholes just swoop in and buy up the entire inventory to scalp to newbies.
---
thats what I was just thinking, I feel like that would be a great change.
---
Everything in the outer ring isnt simply obliterated, but IS swamped with radiation.
---
its felt weird since day one that theres like a single step between clear sunny day and "everything is fucked"
---
My husband and I both carry .50 Cal! Omg! The damage is ridiculously good! 😂😂😂
---
Yeah. What's with all the punching....
---
If you like the game after playing it once, it's literally on sale at Amazon on all platforms for $17. ($30 for regular and $40 for Tricentennial via Microsoft store as well)
---
That doesn't work. I've tried it three times.
---
Play the game and figure it out.
---
I tried to make a defensw tower but it never lets me place it
---
I was wondering this too.  My guess is it will change every week or so, but more importantly will the location be random or chosen beforehand?
---
The video from when I was young and neede the money that Todd has a copy of.
---
I've actually had an increase in performance since launch.
---
Well, you can VATS the animals.
---
All gamemodes are on one character.
---
They should make it more foggy/smoggy, it is the Ash Heap after all. Barely being able to see as laser blast are firing through the thick clouded air.
---
You act like I didn't take time trying to adjust my settings in the game. It's still running extremely poorly as it did in the beta. I personally haven't seen any improvement.
---
As a pve person who loathes pvp...I'm having a blast in this new update. I'm terrible at it but still enjoying myself.
---
It's my favourite weapon probably, i usually use that and have a laser rifle or shotgun as the other quick swap slot
---
The person who downs should get the kill only if the player is eliminated, and the person who eliminates them should get an assist credit.
---
I've definitely run into that loot problem. It'd be nice if loot in the new containers were instanced between members of a team (so each team member could get their own loot, but once a team looted it it'd be empty to other teams), but that'd probably mess up the balance too much.
---
That's because most of us higher levels are having a blast in NW. Even those of us who hate BR games.
---
What happens if you follow?  I just laughed and went about my business. It would disappear and show up again after a few minutes.
---
I mean, I hate PVP too and I actually really enjoyed it. If you haven't tried it out, I would at least give it a shot. You get a lot of adventure xp just for surviving, and if you get matched with a good squad you can be bad at PVP like me and still come at least second place.
---
What happens if every dies at once? Who wins? Lol.
---
Is it just your fav in NW or you play with it in adventure mode too?
---
It works the same as the power armor detector....you gotta be within 50m ish
---
i think the difference would be 1. *less* radiation, maybe just a rad storm instead of a cloud of it.  and 2. it wouldnt destroy everything in the circle, just bathe it in rads
---
No worries dude I'm happy where on the same page
---
Her body is somewhere, so she died.
---
Mod support is going to happen.
---
I’m a big ol’ friendly boi, so Adventure all the way, it’s extremely rare (in my experience) to run into griefers, other players are usually pretty rad/fun/generous.   Nuclear Winter has also been fun for a quick, less story-driven play, which is great when you don’t have a substantial amount of time to commit, I’d definitely play a few matches of that during the sneak peek as well.
---
bloodied is plenty viable if you prioritize damage mitigation. below 20% health i become a walking tank in my power armor.
---
Any mods or altercations detected and you're booted back to the main menu.
---
It has anti cheat/anti mod detection.
---
It is mostly just this sub.  You could slap the fallout label on a bag of shit, and they would line up to suck Todd Howard off for a chance to buy it.
---
This is why you dont have more friends.
---
I like this idea :)
---
Is that a thing? Do you need to take those quick kits first into inventory or can you just build out of blueprint whenever, wherever..?
---
That makes more sense.
---
I think it’s happening when you try to shoot when looking down the sights.
---
Spoiler Alert, you don't hate Battle Royales
---
Does killing players that are downed register separately from just downed players? I've been curious about that.
---
wish the wouldn't be so much time between games, pretty fun
---
I was vocal that I didn't want it. Then I gave it a shot. 
---
Most people said they didn't want it. Majority of posts actually compared to those who said otherwise.
---
We discovered it's actually pretty fun.
---
Now all the posts are about how they said they'd quit and now have to eat their words because they love it.
---
THIS is what survival  mode should have been instead of allowing god weapons and armor players taking all their equipment over from adventure. IF survival was the same it would have been better.   
---
Overall it's been sounding like a hit especially here on Reddit... Sure a few not liking it but the majority do.
---
I never suggested going into NW for any sort of perk my suggestion was players being able to level up as they would in survival or adventure mode in NW so they could put points into their S.P.E.C.I.A.L. Instead of having to server hop to level up.
---
Seen noticable hackers twice since launch.
---
Worked for me, sorry it doesn't work for you.
---
&gt; Hopefully they're matching levels and you don't end up level 2 going against 90
---
There's no difference
---
Still had nothing
---
No one is crying here. It’s like you can’t imagine someone wouldn’t want to go on and make fun of this behavior. Everyone always has to be salty and crying to you. There’s nothing here to be salty about. I just wanted to make fun of people like you that look forward to they 2 minutes of PUNCH and drool
---
Personally I enjoy the 800 limit. From where it was its a big improvement and managing it is just another aspect of the game.
---
I get what you're saying, but at the same time if more people are playing NW then that's the mode they are going to focus on.
---
I honestly have no idea... I actually liked survival when I saw people and the first reaction was to say what's up or do an event together. Not being able to fast travel everywhere was a great excuse to explore a lot more. But it's just like when you're trying to do an event and someone kills you, fine... You killed me. You got my stuff and some caps. I'm cool with that. It is survival mode after all. Do you really need to kill me 10 more times though? I'm just trying to do the event.
---
Ants? Heh, even SBQ just tickles with my build. I get:
---
Power armor base DR
---
Emergency Protocols (50% Damage Reduction)
---
Dodgy (30% Damage Reduction)
---
Empath (31% Damage Reduction with my alt account using Strange In Numbers)
---
I stand in her face and shove my bloodied 25% fire rate prime .50 cal down her throat. At 19% HP, she hits me for maybe 2-3% of my HP per swing at most. Using a diluted stimpack while I'm reloading the .50 cal is plenty to keep me up, and she goes down in about 2-3 minutes.
---
Or player icons
---
Nuclear winter now.
---
Tried to get my son to play FO76 for the last six months and it was like pulling teeth. Told him nuclear winter is like PUB76 and he and I played three games last night and is looking forward to more tomorrow. Was even more surprised after that his adventure mode dude was getting exp and caps.
---
Damn, I dropped the game awhile ago because of the small glitches like that, some things never change I guess
---
But it still revives them right?
---
Ma and pa store
---
Depends on the legendary effects - some effects are considered junk/scrip effects that no one wants like nocturnal and then some secondary effects could make things worth more like swing speed on melee weapons will almost always increase the value
---
Yeah there were some limited time events like the Faussnacht stuff that you may have missed, but that doesn't mean they will never come back, could be a yearly event. 
---
And yes, the new dlc extends the main story, how Bethesda's put it was "year 1 was the vault dwellers rebuilding the wasteland, and year 2 will be people coming back to west Virginia to help/raid.
---
Who is complaining...?
---
Is this the plan now? We hand out pitchforks and watch the newbies stab and burn each other for our amusement? Is this what our founding fathers would have wanted us to become? Savages? -Sighs- 20 caps on the little guy.
---
Adventure but the NW mode is pretty fun and a more even playing field! After the horror stories coming from Survival mode... no thanks, I figured ti was going to have issues when they announced you could move your character, armor and weapons back in forth between modes... not exactly survival if you have a place to call a safe space...
---
Holy crap, I think thats the idea ive been missing.
---
my best idea for fixing the weight management problems would be to be able to assign permanent perk cards to the stash.  but just making junk weightless (while in the stash) would legit solve everything, at least in my eyes
---
True. In previous fallout games I loved to just roam around.
---
My hype for 76 was just to be a wandering trader with actual people, I wanted my team and I to be a random encounter for players... never quite worked out though.
---
I would love to have a new mode with the br ballance where you have to hold specific points to gain a currency that you can exchange for specific skins, furniture or xp, caps for the other modes.
---
It's a sad day when The Onion completely misses the point and unironically parrots what more compromised news sources are stating.
---
They need to get use to that or farming material to make more! lol
---
What's funny about this is that I bought the PA version and forgot about the bag. When I saw it in the package i was like, "this bag looks crappy," but didn't think much of it since I had forgotten everything in the PA edition. If not for reddit, I would've never known to make a ticket to get a good bag. I still haven't received said bag though.
---
You're just claiming you like something and that everyone else is wrong without actually providing an argument for WHY it's good. Sweet fanboying bro.
---
0.01 seconds after leaving the vault I had a random person run up to me in a singleplayer multiplayer RPG. I exited out because lolnothx. Not playing a singleplayer game with random 5 year olds numlocking behind me.
---
So far my experience with the BR after 5 games is 'HERE'S YOUR PISTOLS AND SCOPED WEAPONS ENJOYS LOSING FUCKER.' Also super unenjoyable gunplay.
---
Why? Just wait until you're ready to go back to adventure mode and level up then. Rack up that xp as long as you can without leaving.
---
Nuclear winter is the BR dlc. Wastelanders is the other dlc
---
When I was new, I did appreciate when someone gave me a little something now and then to help me along, either directly or by leaving them somewhere like the suitcase outside Charleston Station. A nice gun, some ammo, some armor, a few of the consumables. A little help is good. I wouldn't have appreciated being fitted out with legendaries head to toe, enough ammo to solo the SBQ, and enough food/drink for the whole vault. At some point you might as well enable their console commands and enter 'tgm' for them.
---
Same here. Got a flaming pitchfork when I started too and now I make fully kitted baseball bats for everyone :)
---
Oh, no not seen one yet
---
It's not just that, it's a week long sneak peek and then it gets taken away. Everyone is trying to rank as high as they can to get the best rewards they can before it goes on hiatus.
---
I would think that altercations are commonplace in a BR game :P
---
I mean that could work but I feel it would cause more problems than solutions. I know a lot of people who I hear snatch up all the loot because the low level Nw players are “noobs who don’t know what they are doing” the only other criticism I have right now is make a single person one
---
Yup, back before patch 9.5
---
Nope they aren't allowed. I also wasted 700 atoms  on this
---
I guess you could use the user flair that’s already available called “reclamation day” as the new players are just having their reclamation days for the first time this week?
---
There was a guy on the market trying to sell 300 like a week ago. Sadly he dropped them all before I could buy some. Said he killed a player who had 3,000 lead and didn’t know cannonballs would be so heavy lol 
---
I might hit up lucky hole mine later to craft up a bunch. I’ll let you know if I do
---
Lol maybe try the vault dweller flair
---
It gives you a down count and a kill count. Lets not start forgetting what words mean. Did you kill them? No, you downed them.
---
I beg to differ, I feel like a goddamn tank in that bitch, I was the guy to bum rush other squads and my team lay down some cover fire for me
---
You probably have to craft it at an armour workbench
---
&gt;The problem with this is that normal mode is now a ghost town.
---
Really? On my friendlist about 30-40% players at max, are playing it. My friendlist is mainly players I've traded with, which might not be perfect example of general playerbase.
---
Compere to the usual 1-2 max. playing survival. (Out of ~20 of online on good time). 
---
BR seems to have decent appeal as main PvP mode. Most importantly it should keep pulling PvE players too since there is really nothing to lose. On survival people got tired of getting farmed and requiring to win 4 fights to compensate for one death. So it became empty. BR nothing to lose but time.
---
yes. server hop toxic larrys meat and go. there are 3 snally gasters there each time. that gives minimum 15 acid but up to 24 for each hop. it is 1 acid to 2 lead ore to create 5 scrap. put on super duper and you'll be fine. it literally takes me an hour at most to craft 30000 5mm ammo. which in my Bloody gatling takes me a week and a half to go through
---
Which is exactly what it means to kill someone.
---
There is hinted display cases in a future patch as well.
---
They just look so damn cool.  Now they look like an angry mob out on a witch hunt.
---
&gt; At least for now there is nothing you will miss out on if you skip this mode.
---
Save for some pretty cool camp items and cosmetics which is the main reason people are playing it.
---
It was
---
You need to spec for that so it sounds like you wanted it to happen.
---
Yeah I missed several and I only took 3-4 weeks off. Makes me want to log in at least weekly and see what the shop has. Hate to miss anything. It really is solid. Has some issues but it’s very fun.
---
Agreed, really want to see just how much my b25 .50 cal is actually doing on queen. I mean i SEE her health bar melting, but what's the actual number, ya know? Also just got a J25 UGL I'd like to test out, though I know that will be garbage until we get armor pen on energy weapons. Same for my B25 gatling plasma.
---
Yeah id say you have to craft it in the workbench
---
Just because it technically is right, doesn’t mean it works.
---
Atom store outfits usually have to be crafted at the armor work bench.  Did you check there?
---
obviously i dont know as much about this as you do, but do you think there would be performance issues if they did something like: make junk in the stash weigh zero, then give a hard limit of say 50,000 of each item?
---
Exactly, I want my bags to have Grass Pattern Camo, everyone else can have bright orange, if they want to lose all their Junk.
---
I don't really get upset when someone takes my bag, I figure you shouldn't take anything with you into an Event that you aren't ready to lose, and I don't loot anything until the fighting is done.
---
All of my friends with the exception of one who talked shit have been in it since it launched yesterday. I was the o my one excited and I have no one to play with because they al teamed up with out me lol
---
Another would be at lvl 12 you get the BRONZE statue it's not gold alsoat lvl 16 you get the medium crate camp plan ( yellow crate) and at lvl 18 you get the bad hair female player icon...
---
You get all excited that it’s finally going to happen and next thing you know someone beat you to “the kill?”
---
Yeah, pretty much everyone that I did play with has moved on. And I'm fine with that. I can enjoy it with friends, or alone. Most times I actually prefer alone, but there is fun to be had with others as well. Even my 14 yo son quit playing once he hit lvl 50, and makes fun of me for still playing, lol. Oh well, I enjoy it usually and I see no reason to apologize for that.
---
You're right, but you gotta let'em be kids for a little while.
---
Yeah it would, quite a bit. Personally I think mobs should drop legendary parts that players would then have to craft into player made weapons as well if were going to have legendaries at all.
---
Except that's directly stated in your headline. Some people liking the game now is not the same as saying this game is for people who don't like Fallout. That doesn't make any sense. I get what you were trying to say with the headline, that people who may not like Fallout can enjoy this new mode, but it just comes off as a weird statement of "It's a Fallout game for people who don't like Fallout." Which makes no sense to me. This is all I'm saying.
---
Yeah, that's odd. I've submitted 3 tickets and all were answered before the end of the next day.
---
I read his fucking post. Saying "My friends don't like Fallout" is fine. But why fucking say the game is "Fallout for people who don't like Fallout". That does equate to saying "my friends don't like Fallout" in any way.
---
Showers would be amazing. Would be great to get a -30% chance of disease buff for like 1 hour after using it !
---
Craft it at the armor station.
---
It's a beta/sneek peak. Not everything is going to be in right now.
---
Because it is better!
---
(imo)
---
If I remember correctly, Bethesda did say display cases were not being launched until somewhere after Wild Appalachia. Wanted to make sure they didn't cause technical issuesI suppose and i'm assuming its been moved further back with Nuclear Winter being tested out now.
---
There are certain attributes that are more highly sought after than others (bloodied, furious, explosive, two shot, instigating etc.) and those, especially for two or three started variants, fetch a more premium price. Everything else is usually sold pretty low for scrip. So like I sell my "trash" legendaries for incredibly cheap...like maybe 500 caps at the most. My 1* variants of good attribute legendaries I usually sell for between 1k and 2k depending on the weapon itself. 2** and 3*** can go anywhere from 2k on up
---
How is that a strawman? Calling out a group of people and calling them idiots is not a strawman argument.
---
I'll be starting tonight on PS4 and playing for 5-6 hours.  If you're on PS4 I will join ya.
---
I believe there's another one near the relay tower by Flatwoods. I think there's a 3rd but I'm not sure where it is.
---
I handed one out to a level two yesterday at the moonshiners camp. Hope he enjoyed.
---
Ahh... High level vault raids are also listed in the Nuclear Winter dlc road map.
---
Yeah, I walked up on a player with full power armor durability and literally took them down with 2 shots of my double barrel. I kinda like the idea of not taking any or very little damage while in PA with a low durability bar that breaks off when broken. Even a perk card that allows the fusion core to blow when ejected like in F4 would be nice.
---
Even without actual damage numbers, I can tell you that just from watching the HP bar of enemies, B25 .50 cal is one of the absolute best weapons. I've tried TSE .50 cal. It's extremely underwhelming. AAE gatling plas is pointless until they make AA work with energy weapons, and I can also tell you from experience that a B25 .50 cal smokes the B25 Gatling Plas due to armor penetration.
---
So if I jump off a cliff and die I get the kill because I killed myself? If my teammate doesn’t Rez me do they get the kill because they let me die? Does a feral ghoul get the kill if I die to them? Just because the person who finishes someone technically is killing them, doesn’t mean they deserve rewards.
---
Go to armor work bench, listed under outfits.  I got to tell you, it's my new favorite.
---
This is the real question.
---
You mean aside from the 4-5 minutes it takes to actually spawn into a match?
---
Nope. I like Fallout, battlefield and callofduty and dislike pubg and others.. I give a try the new mode for a hour and no, I do not like this either.. I will stick with RPG mode.
---
It should appear in your armour workbench under outfits, you’ll need to craft it in adventure or survival mode as all outfits in the atomic shop or offered as bundles are the plan for the outfit and need to be crafted before they can be equipped. If it’s NW you don’t need to craft it just go to outfits in the atomic shop and hit NW favourite on it to equip it in NW mode.
---
Thing is, when you die, you drop a bag too. If it is easy to see, another player can more easily take your stuff. There are some savages our there during end game boss or that other "Imposter" event. If a buddy dies I stand over their bag so no one else can take it.
---
Fortunately, in Adventure mode, you only lose junk. In Survival Mode you lose some Aid and all junk.
---
Oh i didnt know that sorry
---
Fun! /s
---
I'm probably just going to buy it despite not even trying it yet, but what do you get for Tricentennial version?&gt;
---
...unless of course the player is revived......then you’d have to take away the kill you rewarded. Wait no, that’s stupid. Never mind.
---
Happened to me tonight but I didn’t recall being in power armor prior to the big.
---
Ive seen the code it goes like this
---
for each (item in ironScraps)
---
 ironScraps.push(new IronScrap())
---
totally should be duffel bag when dropped, paper sack when downed with your junk
---
__Terry Crews is a national treasure.__
---
If they're perk cards, they'll appear the next time you're in the queue area and go to adjust your perks.  If they're craftable items like the Vault 51 jumpsuit, they'll just be available in Adventure or Survival when you enter the crafting menu.
---
🙄
---
As someone who has spent the past two weeks shit talking the non-existent FalloutBR
---
Boy do I really love me some FalloutBR. It just doesn't feel/play like the other ones I've tried.
---
This is just an additional game mode.
---
Did they stop focusing on adventure when survival hit or work on both?
---
They've also listed several huge dlcs coming to adventure mode.
---
Your post makes absolutely no sense and just sounds like attention seeking childish banter.
---
Have a good day.
---
I know. My point is many people don't know that.
---
You need to go on the road with this. Every single BR has players you can argue with!
---
You're crying about a post on Reddit.
---
If you need a helping hand or someone to team with just let me know! Always glad to help new players. :)
---
Nah, PVE players are always salty and demanding every moment they aren't catered to. I don't expect them to upvote a post calling them out.
---
You can win skins and cosmetics for the base game
---
I think the cheeseyness drives people away from using bloodied for everything. My melee char is bloodied, but none of my others, it's just so meh to use.
---
Wierd as fuck imo.
---
It's like "u".
---
It takes longer to think of the abbreviation than to just type the original word.
---
But hey, you do you.
---
I think it's in a good place it's fair for other players but if you play the right way your a death machine in it. Power armour plus 50 call is a winning combination
---
Not sure how your struggling with this. If you down someone, you get XP for downing someone. If you kill someone, you get XP for killing someone. Once someone is down there healthy bar isn't a sliver, there is a considerable bit of effort that goes into finishing someone off as well. 
---
This game isn't about kill count either, its about being the last survivor. Who cares if your team mate gets the kill. If he KILLED him he should. 
---
You like 15 years old or something?
---
It's really a duplicate of the white springs bunker from what I've seen. I dont think there is anything uniquely  different about it . Unless of course I'm wrong lol
---
New to you, so it's all good.
---
At least $15k
---
think you mean clothes. under armor is the vault suit
---
👍🏻 I’m on PC, you?
---
That is very common item drop.
---
It's known yes, but thanks for being helpful.
---
or build in the nuke resistant factories rather then a shed on a hill
---
Who dat?
---
That reminds me of the Starcraft joke: I like my women like my zerglings: cheap and in pairs.
---
&gt;this is not a game where snipers do well
---
 Disagree 100%
---
I had this happen to me once but it didn't happen after that.
---
Yes but not much and apparently setting up camp near hemlock holes is one of your best bets to having an infinite supply of acid. I kill yao guais, snallygasters, and wendigos for acid but honestly just never had a problem with not having enough acid to smelt. In fact I'm sitting on 300+ acid right now which is enough for a run through lucky hole mine. Use component view in your pip boy to find out what items drop lead and acid then just go to town on them. Makeshift battery is a good one right off the bat and abraxo cleaner and turpentine for acid which are both common. Hit up pools for bags of chlorine
---
&gt; those, especially for two or three started variants, fetch a more premium pric
---
What about 50% armour negated
---
40% extra damage from power attack
---
\+1 strength
---
This is a walking cane of level
---
How much is it worth?
---
I didn't find the 3rd - just Overseer 51's body with a list
---
It's coming. They stated the sneak peak would only take place in the forest. Others will be available when it's fully released.
---
Don’t forget to take into account the level of the item also. You could get a great legendary effect but the weapon is only a level 10 or something.
---
Yeah, but once you do you’ll go out of your power armor. Not all the time, but a large amount of them
---
1. No that’s a suicide. Some games dock a kill for that. Fuckin goob. 
---
2. No. They get one less team mate (and silence since you’ll be crying about them finishing off enemies for you, hayuck). Fuckin goob. 
---
3. Feral ghouls are computer controlled enemies. Computers don’t care if they win or lose. They are computers. Fuckin goob. 
---
4. Be the change you want to see, man. Get your signs ready and take to the capital. Wear your fuckin goob outfit to gain more attention.
---
The press conference made no mention of the dozens of upcoming new features and content drops. The BR is a fraction of the stuff coming.
---
found it out actually you go to atom ship and favorite one then you auto get it in the game once you join
---
Some one give him gold
---
Go troll the teenager sub more your fucking creeper
---
Updated, thanks again!
---
The NW update includes more than just the BR.
---
This is like the 13th post in this issue. Wish people would use the search function. JS.
---
Yeah I thought the icons were for a loot box type of thing
---
Hm alright thanks
---
the bog without Marsupial is fucking MISERABLE
---
The minutemen have always been cool... right?
---
At overseers lvl 5 you will get an actual container, that can be built in your camp, but the other 3 containers, that you will get as rewards are just player icons, that can be claimed in the atomic shop. They are called small, medium and epic crate and the icons look like the actual crates, so its kinda confusing. I am only at overseers lvl 7, so I dont know how it works after that, but this is how the rewards look for the first 7 levels.
---
Someone's extra salty their topic got removed
---
Whoops
---
I never said it didnt but the main feature is the BR most likely
---
Yep. Been posted.
---
Oh, thanks, maybe I’m confusing the body with a third crate. I only read about them and it was a few weeks ago at this stage.
---
Personally I was pleasantly surprised with the game coming into the free weekend. I downloaded it for BR mode and ended up trying out survival mode for special points and kind of ended up forgetting about the BR. The game honestly holds up on its own in my opinion.
---
It kind of went from something to waste a couple hours on to realizing not everything I'd hear about the game is completely true, I'll 100% end up buying it when I'm better off financially. This free weekend is honestly probably the best thing that could of happened to the game along with the BR mode.
---
PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH drool  drool drool
---
Same. It's all grouped up and the numbers stack if you have a tight grouping (you can kind of see what looks like a blurred outline).  When I started indiscriminately firing into a group without VATS, it was clearer that I was firing a grouping of pellets.
---
Can you substantiate that?
---
Very interesting!
---
Hah, I thought you meant in game.
---
Look, your headline was kinda bullshit to me and I commented. Why do people get so fucking defensive all the time. We're all just killing time till we can play some more anyway. None of it fucking matters.
---
Punch punch punch drool drool drool
---
You can wear it in the normal game. In NW it would give an unfair advantage.
---
Insulting someone does not help you win an argument. If you want to have a genuine discussion about the topic, you have to be more passive.
---
Same here. I think quite a few people thought so. The rewards are kinda confusing.
---
It didn't even have a "Horrible" launch, just not good. Anthem had a horrible launch. FFXIV had a horrible launch.
---
Nothing tells people you don't care about their opinion more than a rage post where you tell them you don't care about their opinion and that your opinion is correct.
---
Yeah thanks let me know
---
We also have no solo info on when vault raids are supposed to drop
---
At level 248 on my main and a total of 20 characters, I fully understand the benefits of the bloodied build, but with my Vanguard's (3), Chameleon (1), &amp; Life Saving (1) Armor, I'm a Stealth Tank that rarely dies, I only wear PA inside Blast Zones, and I'll take my Sneak damage multipliers on every shot over the Adrenal any day.
---
How do you access the stuff you unlock I am level 5 and have got crates as rewards. I won a game also.
---
Use original character
---
The thing that annoys me is that vermin get inside the house, and theyu don't seem to want to go out - just wander about - you can leave the door open and they STILL don't easily go.
---
I want these so-and-sos out of my house.
---
Any suggestions?
---
There is also lots of steel and plastic of you have access to the Brotherhood areas.
---
Icons, camp stash boxes and NW perk cards.
---
Only rewards in NW right now.
---
Small stash box is lvl 5, long yellow box is 7 I think. Not sure on the orange box.
---
Icons are between 1-4.
---
I think adding the ability to find and explore Vault 51 would be a really great addition.
---
If you want to prevent people farming junk and food from inside, maybe make the vault door tied to Overseer Rank and you can open it in adventure/survival mode once every X hours based on your rank. This could trigger a world notification that Vault 51 has been opened for a limited time (like the effects a nuke has), and people could flock there to grab some minor loot/junk and learn more about the vault.
---
This is true most people i know just hate the game for not being a lonely game filled with pointless npcs that can die
---
What level
---
They last all week
---
My mic used to work fine, but today it suddenly stopped working in game. Not sure what is going on. Hopefully someone has a solution.
---
I’m talking about the XP. We have a limited time to gain it for the preview. I want to see as much of Vault 51 with the limited time I have.
---
Yeah same, i didnt even notice the bad was different until a crazy bald guy made a screaming video about it and the internet shat its pants, but hey ho, i get a free second bag and 500 atoms
---
That's pretty nice
---
I find way too many. I say "scoped lever on me if ya want it" way more than I would like
---
Yesss! There’s also a vet one that has a couple of cats. And I also if you follow it I think a line of cats appear after it after a minute lol. That or both these events spawned back to back for me 😂
---
I like to tease them by giving them level 5 weapons and armor. 
---
"Here buddy, you can have this tasty morsel, but you gotta put in a little work first."
---
and the one thing I DO want to come in, a black cat, won't, probably in part because it smells the other vermin and rodents who wander into the house.
---
This, by the way, is a reason to put a lock on your door.
---
This is just a sneak peek. The full mode is yet to be released.
---
Eh....walking cane probably wouldn't get you anything special. I mean, you could throw it in your vending machine for like 1000-1500 caps but I don't think a walking cane would sell real well. I'd be surprised if it sold at all. If it was me, I'd probably scrap it for scrip
---
45
---
And I wish I hadn't spent my atoms right away :(
---
How much damage does it do.
---
Let me know when you test armor pen
---
I can respond to a loveless nobody all day long
---
I dropped them nuke codes and pointed them to.site alpha
---
They've stated any altercations to game files or installed mods will boot you to main menu.
---
Official files only in NW by their statements.
---
Imagine getting so salty over “punch punch punch drool drool drool ” that you actually go into the persons post history to try and insult them lmao. I’ve never seen someone get so mad. You can’t help but to reply 
---
PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH drool drool drool.
---
I died at like 1:15 on my first attempt. Then was shy of 15 minutes by a few seconds then, i think, i averaged 5 minute lives. I am not very good either.
---
They did a decent job on the BR mode...  Its not horrible but that does not invalidate a thing.  Everyone is so the ends justifies the means mentality anymore its nuts.  Its like peoples mind can only handle one outcome or scenario at a time.  Both can exist.  
---
If they had put this much effort into the game it would have been even more well received.  The game needed to cook more.  They pushed it out too soon with bugs and flaws.  That is clear.
---
I never use it in adventure, so just in NW.
---
It was a pun. Well, wanted to be anyway.
---
Look up 'altercations'.
---
Then look up 'alterations'.
---
Yup on PC survival has maybe 6 players and they're all low level. I dont see any of the sweaty player names around anymore, pretty boring actually lol
---
Pretty sure downing players counts for little, and doesn't count for a kill (since someone could come along and revive them).  Since a person can really only be killed once in a game, it could only count the final blow.
---
79 has no NPCs
---
The game shouldn’t be running poorly for you, it’s either your hardware or a settings issue. I’ve never had any issues at all running with my Alienware. It’s two years old and it doesn’t have any problem.
---
I'm not at home to check. Can the BOS rifle be modded with the .50 cal receiver? I've thought about crafting them, but .308 is a bitch to craft at low levels, and not many enemies in the forest drop it, so I've opted for making them maxed out pipe revolver rifles instead.
---
Who hurt you today? Tell me about it, I’ll get em’ for you. It’ll all be ok.
---
Up to 20 mins but usually less. 15 mins pretty common.
---
Hmm, mine seems fine outside of Fo76. The game is just refusing to recognize it. Dunno what’s happening either way.
---
Honestly I don't have any perk cards to up it's damage and none of the other NW perk cards I have effect it in any way or my build
---
Nuclear Winter, went live yesterday.
---
More of a QOL thing, not difficulty.
---
Nuclear winter aka the new battle royale mode. Some people use BR instead.
---
Oops, didn't even notice Google autocorrected to the wrong word. You are right.
---
Nuclear Winter the name of the new game mode they added yesterday battle royale
---
Slow your roll, camper. You don’t get camp junk until they fix sliding ghouls and give us perk card decks finally. The guy in line behind me wants ammo scrapping, and the dude behind him wants ammo bulking.
---
No one is crying
---
Yea, sometimes it works. I have to pull trigger, wait to see if the gun will start to shoot after spinning to max speed and if not, let go and pull the trigger again... Extremely annoying!
---
Rip. Nuked the Queen the other night and the server did they same thing with about 10 people gathered at the event.
---
They rlly are. I was hoping it was a lootbox system to unlock various Nuclear winter themed camp items or cosmetic rewards
---
You do gain xp and caps that go to adventure mode.
---
My personal pet hate about these game modes is have a bad streak and you spend more time in menus and waiting than actually playing.
---
Speed it up is my feedback, back to the vault not the menu and get us back into another match ASAP
---
Big oof.
---
Lol at least it isn't lvl 20 or higher.
---
Lol didnt realise thanks!
---
That's the spirit! You are a big boy now.
---
Didnt realise thanks!
---
I'd say around $750 plus a monitor, if you're building it yourself. [PCPartPicker.com](https://PCPartPicker.com) is your salvation. I play on my laptop and ten minutes into FO76 the base gets hot enough to have rendered me sterile by now. I wouldn't recommend it.
---
Could be... I kinda remember it's happening when I'm aiming down sights. But that's the only way when trying to hit anything with any gatling weapon!
---
It isn't something else is going on with your system. The game has had significant increases in performance since launch.
---
My setup is very similar to yours and I almost never suffer any of what you are describing.
---
GT DaLastDiablo come see my vending and you can see a range of crap to God roll and see pricing options 😉
---
I get it's early days but I think Bethesda needs to step in and clarify thing like rewards &amp; the face that the battle royale game mode isn't all of the Nuclear Winter Dlc to come.
---
Power armor and .50 cal makes me feel like the heavy from tf2. I'm just holding down my mouse button and everything dies
---
Well the reward for reaching lvl 5 was a camp item and it seems that there are more then 70 overseer levels. So chances are good, that there will be more camp items.
---
Ballistic Fiber too!
---
Thank you!! Hopefully more will give it a chance like you.
---
How different is a Fallout or ES game on PC? I'm wondering if Halo infinite will be on PC.
---
Get the Butcher’s Bounty perk in Perception. Hunt ticks. Moonshiner’s cabin outside Vault 76 and sometimes around Point Pleasant.  Don’t forget to click “Search” on the corpses. Use the tick blood and blood sacks to make antiseptic and blood packs. Use blood packs and steel to make stimpaks. Use purified water to dilute them unless you need faster healing. 
---
Chemist perk later on doubles the yield of blood packs and stimpaks. Super Duper increases output another 60% or so.
---
Thanks!  They did change the address.  \^.\^
---
Takes me 5 minutes to load, then i usually die so i can't tell you :(
---
right ? like i'm absolutely loving it, don't get me wrong, but the entire reward system seems to have been left unexplained ?
---
You keep talking to me and you’re never gonna get back to your punching lifestyle. Hurry up and queue for NW so you can get another 2 minutes of punching in
---
At least 17
---
Oh, if it's asus you can get the drivers for the mb off support. There's others to install too like the lan and audio driver.
---
I know they are different things. That’s why I think what I think. If people can be revived, you will gain a down but not a kill. That’s why they are different. Not for others to get distracted from fighting to finish an enemy for extra XP.
---
I am with you OP. The fact that NW exists at all is kind of proof that they have been neglecting to put their resources into adventure mode to start.
---
The lag is a problem though. The view your opponent has is different from yours. On multiple occasions I sniped a stationary target only to miss &amp; have them teleport a few feet away.
---
People are willing to pay 10 000 ?!
---
This is the only way I give items. Drop in a bag. Never had an issue. Never had em drop through camp. Dropped hundreds of bags without a problem.
---
Trading is too clunky and takes too long.
---
For me about 3 minutes.
---
Not at all.  Wasn't sure if is Nuclear Winter or free trial that is the root cause.
---
You're probably right. I think I'll have more fun playing games that the developers actually care about.
---
The person who downed them did all the work. For some one to just kill the downed guy and get the “kill” points is trash. Just like any other BR game you dingus.
---
No i saw someone had a sweet pa camo they got from some lvl. Not sure which lvl tho
---
Oh lawd, I’ve been underselling. If I knew I could get more than a couple hundred caps, I wouldn’t have sacrificed so many for the scrip.
---
I want to say keep the grind per character it gives alternatives to level alt characters.
---
&gt;I want to see as much of Vault 51 with the limited time I have.
---
Right because after this week vault 51 is going away forever and you'll never be able to increase you're overseer level /s
---
Me: Having fun in NW
---
Other People: OMG THEY JUST RUINED THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE GAME.
---
This isn't Fortnite in which a lot of updates went more towards BR than their story. The focus will always be on adventure and survival. Adventure will do fine and you don't have to worry about PVP in it
---
Past 2 games of BR this happened to me, so infuriating lol
---
Ill sell you AA and Bloodied three stars for 2k if your getting that much for 1*
---
I have indeed tried it, but I'm not the best loser. Nor do I have any people to play with other than randoms and it's just...meh. I'll pass. PvP just really isn't my thing.
---
Ooh goodies! Can’t wait to grind that out bc decorating my camp is (not joking) what I live for in this game!
---
Yes in the closed vaults
---
Okay.
---
You can drop a bullet in a different spot if this happens. It will move all items into the new bag.
---
My assumption is we are about to be bombarded with clothes for the atomic shop for this mode and modes like it.
---
Actually WoW and previous iterations of MMOs used to have no balance adjustments for PvP. That was added after a couple years had passed and had damning effects to the entire genre. Every single MMO that came out was a WoW clone and one of the things they loved to copy was 'resilience' - the PvP stat. A stat that would condemn PvE to having no purpose besides getting gear off the boss to kill the same boss again more easily since that gear had no resilience and at the same time make new characters in PvP garbage compared to characters who had PvP'd a lot and had high resilience.
---
Thus it was removed after **many** years when someone finally got a clue and replaced with *actual* balancing of abilities, which the WoW devs took pride in **not** balancing prior to this because their playerbase was too stupid to understand that their fireball did less damage in PvP than it did in PvE so they had to keep the game as simple as possible for them by creating a generic all-encompassing PvP stat.
---
Not that I know jack about this game's PvE balance. IIRC from playing Fallout 3/4 the game becomes piss easy after a few hours of play when you level up talents. Never spent any time playing this game's PvE.
---
Sorry for not responding I should have mentioned I'm on Pc
---
43, jut checked now. It'll probably sell for less than 1000
---
No, still dont like to use mics.
---
He means under armor.  There are under armor suits in the Atomic shop I could definately see someone wanting to wear chiefly that black tactical one.
---
No, I am totally a team player.  I just feel that a down is not a kill, no matter how much you may have taken the health down.  You did not kill them.  There is no way you can be considered to have killed them if they are not dead and can be revived.
---
The absurd logic here is "I did not actually kill this player but I should get credit for killing him anyway".
---
If it's easier to see, that does mean everyone can see it easier. So people watching for someone dying so they can grab their stuff will love it.
---
Let's say you're fighting the Scorchbeast queen and a Yao Guai spawns behind you and one hits you, even though you're at full health. People love to wait while you call for help, and take your stuff instead of hitting you with a revive. This just makes it easier to find your bag.
---
According to the doc below, there are only 33 different types of scrap. I don't think that would make a big difference performance-wise.
---

---
I'm no expert, and I really don't have any insight into how Bethesda is storing this data or what kind of processing happens on each one.
---
As a programmer (who has also served as an "accidental DBA" on multiple occasions), I think it would really depend on their table structures, and what indexes they have in place, more than the actual number of items.
---
I didn't see that on the server I was on, where queen and WS got nuked.
---
Same issue with Arctis 7.
---
No Worries.
---
Well if you're interested, I got a flat tire and I responded to your poorly written headline while waiting for it to get repaired. Didn't know that you couldn't handle even the most minor criticism.
---
Data mined info here on this sub Reddit, also past mentions by BGS (inside the vault). I believe Juicehead has videos on YouTube for datamined info collection.
---
I was kinda hoping to never have another "No Man's Sky." I want a good game on launch. I hate buying a game Day 1 and not able to play cuz I have to download a day 1 patch and then the game is still buggy. Why do they ship broken as a standard now? (I know deadlines = money, but when you order a cheeseburger, you expect it all to be on the plate, not someone showing up 10 minutes later saying, 'here's the cheese you wanted on that.'")
---
For me that's a bit of an investment right now. Maybe I could buy a piece at a time.
---
I've never had a lost bag issue I'm always dropping stuff i dont need for lower level players usually right in front of them or if its excess ammo or food i leave it in whitesprings by the workstations. Or by my vending machine. Your post is the 1st I'm hearing of this issue.
---
awesome!
---
Check and make sure it is not switching to a different input. My headset was working but people could just barely hear me, no matter what I did. Drove me nuts. Ended up it had switched input to my vr headset. It has also switched to my controller mic before too.
---
i know what i meant
---
No there are mods specifically for ultracite laser weapons, I found this out after getting a quad ultracite laser pistol and not being able to use any of my mods for it. I think the watoga vendor sells ultracite mods
---
Yea. I’m a heavy energy guns main and trying to play this game is infuriating because the gun are bugged every other patch.
---
Change "rarely" to "never unless I'm afk" and you'd have my bloodied build. And add the "kills SBQ while carrying 8 afk noobs in under 3 minutes" part.
---
well to be honest I was expecting maybe some survival carry overs? like since we have bear arms maybe rifles like the lever action and handmade weight 25% less or some thing?
---
Really? Wow that’s a lot. Hey at least they’ll respond to it
---
In fairness I do the same but it did happen me once before so I know what he’s talking about, luckily enough I was just dropping about 10 purified water for a new player, but when I dropped it on the floor of the camp it never appeared.
---
Why have NPCs when you can have PCs. Met some wacky people playing this game. One tried to torture me in his prison camp.
---
Yeah it took me a while to figure this out. Only thing I dont like so far. Doesn't it mean a new player is at a huge disadvantage since they have base starting stats? Maybe not at first but after everyone has enough cards to focus builds down, its gonna get rough for new players.
---
"Ha just another Battle Royale"
---
Yeah looked into that in properties, it is till the default mic. Its like it totally disables it but it doesnt show that anywhere
---
Haha, yeah same
---
Fighting in the trenches and tunnels in the Cranberry Bog would be wicked
---
Lol same
---
Pc
---
You got the game on Xbox?
---
That sounds like the flatwoods monster to me.
---
Yes sir
---
Flatwoods Monster. It's a Zeta Alien actually.
---
what you probably saw was the flatwoods monster my dude
---
For certain weapons yes.
---
Sorry I forgot to mention I'm on Pc
---
Nothing, honestly pointless
---
no :) I've edited it to make it clear now :D
---
If they did this, I would drop duffel bags with a few bullets in them in the middle of the road and wait for people to go loot them while hiding in a bush with a sniper rifle.
---
I'm kinda old but is this where I say: "Bye Felicia"?
---
I could be wrong but it seems like grenades were unfortunately untouched, not complaining though. I'm absolutely loving the buff to explosive weapons
---
Obviously the 5 hours that you played are indicative that the entirety of the game is good.
---
I played Fortnite once, me and my friends were all cry laughing because people were building these skyscrapers and destroying us we were so confused.
---
You have to craft and scrap.  As a bonus tip I just discovered the science perks help with material cost on crafting.  Finally got a nice ultracite laser from the purveyor and am working on making it nice.
---
I think you referring to a small portion of players who probably dont much understand the game if they are putting themselves at risk to snag XP from a kill. 
---
Give it time, once you are with more experienced players it wont be an issue. Your suggestion for downing a player to count as getting the kill is not the solution.
---
Pot calling the kettle black much. All I did was clarify what I meant to you and you responded by getting so bent out of shape it was laughable. You are literally the only person on this entire thread that is getting defensive, so much so that you are starting a new thread to do it again. I am all for criticism. Where did this flat tire occur, who do I need to contact to make your day better?
---
I no understand :)
---
I mean on this point, people want BR games, but not necessarily in everything or in genre's that don't really support it.  FO76 is an online survival RPG game, which does not seem like a great fit for BR.
---
Fallout by Bethesda has never been a "shooter" per say and the mechanics are not as smooth as most shooters.  Call of Duty and Battlefield it makes much more sense to have a BR mode than FO76.
---
With that said, it's not a mode for me, I'll stick to Apex, PUBG, or whatever for my BR fix.  With that said, if people enjoy the mode, I'm not going to drag them through the mud either.
---
It seems like they might be doing that. They said we would be getting a unique power armor skin for free each day (I still only see the t51b, not sure if that's an issue on my end or if they didn't push another one), and since you can only find t51b in nuclear winter right now, I thought maybe that means the power armor you find there will be rotating. There's quite some potential in other parts of the map for a mode like this, too
---
https://imgur.com/a/PUutWar
---
FYI, it auto fills you on a team of 4 unless you turn that option off, and I highly recommend not doing that. There is no "solo" queue right now that forces everyone into solo play.
---
Are you me?
---
This is why I just run solo. I don’t really do well in a team of strangers so rather than hinder a group I just go alone.  I’ll play in a team when I have a team of people I know together.
---
Me too im addicted now
---
The thing is Battle Royale games are created to be addictive. Drop, loot, kill. Luck can bring unskilled players really great loot and give them a taste of the best weapons without grinding. Skill can have the best player make good work of lower skilled players with worse loot. It's this whole dichotomy between luck and skill.
---
But all that matters is that at the end of the day, both quick and long games can be fun especially with friends.
---
I know what you mean that BR's are a "subset of a subset" when it comes to genres but that doesn't matter to people. It's the reason why ultimately the trifecta of PUBG, Fortnite, and even recently-released Apex Legends all rake in just as much, if not more than other triple A games.
---
Stemming from DayZ years ago, BRs are just an addicting concept. People denying Battle Royales can be fun are the same people who knock down FPS games. Not a subset of a subset, but FPS games still are a growing genre with a volatile catalog of lesser-known games as well that fall flat.
---
Why not place a well-received, globally-recognized genre into an already fleshed out game? The thing is FO76 has the typical progression and such of RPG's but there is no harm done in adding a mode that mitigates (most of) that progression and allows for a quick amount of playtime rather than needing hours of commitment to play.
---
Where did you get the plans for a ultracite laser
---
The text from your post has been \[removed\]
---
Some people have things going on in their lives.
---
Maybe just a toy....their are alien faces in the wateland but upon closer inspection they appear to be man made.
---
You. Are. Awesome! Thank you! 
---
Only two hours in and level 3. So much to see, learn, find, do, etc!
---
Why the heck is my comment beeing downvoted... Just said that I appreciate the information.
---
You’re lucky. I’ve been hunting that damn thing. Have to one shot it or it teleports
---
Nobody asked for antibiotics, but we like those. Lol
---
Someone got a statue too
---
I would assume the plan would be to have each region available.
---
What would really put it over the top would be the winning team from each region then battles it out in the vault etc. double XP bonus rewards etc. Would be an interesting change to go from battling in open areas to suddenly be confined. Or just have white springs be the end game location for NW.
---
I checked, and the mic is still set as default.
---
Nice.. I can almost always get to 2 with bums, but haven't beat the last team solo. Closest was a team of 3 and downed one and got caught by the others. Least the game has been teaming me up with higher levels. I killed a really high level guy last game and the computer said, Surprising! He was so promising and was killed by the likes of you. It usually says he was weak. It was surprise buttsecks in some bushes he ran into.
---
Are you using pistols? I heard they are still working. I've replaced it for now with evasive, but I really miss it. Really made combat fun for me lol.
---
Pretty similar, right up until you start modding. There's absolute insanity for mods available for these games on PC that just aren't possible on console.
---
&gt; I get it's early days but I think Bethesda needs to step in and clarify thing like rewards
---
You level up and get rewards
---
&gt;&amp; the fact that the battle royale game mode isn't all of the Nuclear Winter Dlc to come.
---
I mean, all they gotta do is look at the roadmap.
---
It's in the Bethesda post about nuclear Winter.
---
You might also notice the xp carried over too.
---
I haven't tried it yet because I'm really not a fan of the hectic BR style games.
---
Personally though, a team based game settlers vs. mutants or raiders would have been more of a draw to me. Something with more team work from players, more strategy than trying to pick off loners (would seem to be the ideal strategy for BR yes?).
---
A team based game with 26 vs. 26 would definitely have gotten more interest from me than this style.
---
You think too technically. I suppose you are right, but I don’t like what this system promotes.
---
Like what? Lol
---
Syringer is used in challenges
---
#CAN'T.STOP.PLAYING.
---
I was going to give it a week &amp;  get it at greenmangaming if I liked it. But their sale on it ends in 19hours. (I'm on PC  &amp; in the UK)
---
Syringe is for pioneer scout quest and Rose gives you one. Other than that, no idea.
---
Well, damn! Level 46 and never even seen it before! Wish I had gotten closer. I could have found a new alien lifeform... and fucked it. And people'd be like, "There he goes. Homeboy fucked a Martian once."
---
I followed the instructions, and that is not the top selection. I even searched. I’m still just seeing fallout 76 for the ps plus price of 29.99. I have ps plus
---
the dream of not having to waste all my perks on weight management is alive then lol
---
You most likely didn't update your Fallout76Custom.ini
---
Goes better with the vault suit?
---
Where is that body?
---
A rare drop from cranberry bog events, specifically Census Violence, hard to get it (at least for me it was)
---
Hi, Bethesda! Fallout 76 is not available as free in PS Store. You know?  but it must be free for week. You should to threaten SONY. Thanks.
---
Might need it in wastelanders to summon allies, similar to the FO4 and the minutemen. Just a guess 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Hunger games style lol; you get 10 seconds of Pacifist mode to run and gear up and then it is on
---
Think nothing of it, I've had my zeal come acrossed as aggression myself more than once.   
---
It was brought up, they explained it was intentional as I understand it not likely to change.   
---
As I understand it They however did compromise and recently gave an easy option for renaming.     
---
But not for displaying individual character names.  
---
Their logic behind it is sound, especially considering the known toxic environment consoles foster, and stream lining the system **is a very small price to pay** for easy and effective player reporting.   
---
The majority of the people I've seen and interacted with RollPlaying wise have adapted by using the armor and outfits as a tool to clearly distinguish different characters, it means at times sacrificing the "Best" gear for a step down but it is very very effective.   
---
For example people never need to see my name to know who I am, in 7+ Months I'm still the only player wearing and using the combo of gear I do, as a result from a distance people recognize and interact.   
---
If and when I create and alt, it's going to throw people for a loop.   
---
As for chat, I think until we get text chat or someone creates a voice changing App I think LARP'ing rules are going to have to work,'modified of course.    
---
Additionally the majority of the MMO's I've played didn't have an In and out of character chat option, can you point out a few? Curious at this point.   
---
Mail was and is frequently brought up.   
---
The are looking into it, but no promises were made.   
---
Emotes were brought up, and is always brought up, and It's also something they are looking into. 
---
Text emotes are unlikely until we have text based chat.
---
Speaking of the text issue, people ha demanded that but they've made, in almost every single case the largest mistake possible, in framing it as a desire, a want, and something expected. (Pardon the hubris).   
---
I framed the question was differently, **in how they are Leaving money on the table and how they are discriminating again part of the player base.**    
---
By mentioning (2) very simple examples and it made them immediately stop and listen.  
---
-I have several ExPat friends who are non-native English speakers who can't get friend to play the game, because they don't speak English well enough to be comfortable but fluently read English.   
---
If other MMO's can show us anything it's that there are tens if not hundreds of thousands of thousands of potential players who fall into this category.    
---
-I have a few disabled internet friends who wanted to play the  game but can't or don't feel comfortable talking in game... For many even a slight stutter will keep them from jumping into '76.  
---
-Women, in 2019, make a growing portion of the player base. And without speaking out of turn **MANY** still don't want to speak in online games for fear of discrimination or harassment.   
---
Many people I've traded with in game (I'm a medium to large scale Merchant) only after months of trades turned on their mic's and spoke to me for the first time, because of issues they've had in other MMO's.  
---
**All of these represent lost revenue, one of them as discrimination/lack of a combination and the last can be seen as not providing as safe environment**. 
---
I think by framing it this way, the text chat was looked at a little differently, no clue if it means we will get one, but I can say I did my best.  
---
I'd strongly suggest not rushing to judgement, because I personally brought up several of your points, as did others.   
---
Additionally I'd caution you to have patience and understanding, as awesome as RP'ing can be in game, it, as it has been for most MMO's/Online games, it's rarely a priority, over functionality, core features (yes I get it you feel these are) and the current most popular demands.  
---
I apologize if anything here was clipped, brisk, or seemed condescending, tired and just crossed town to stand in line for a few hours and am hot and  tired, so it was unintentional.
---
Hahahaha that was a response I wasn't expecting 😂🤣🤣😂
---
It'd be funny though because you'd see 10 people off themselves right away so they could go back to the vault to explore.
---
My fight was luckily a 1v1 :D there was 2 people but the other  jumped of a hill and died, then his friend were looking at his corpse from the hill and I took my chance
---
fov is tied to fps in this game
---
Mele, ranged, decent stats like SS FFR RW.
---
I would believe you, but with every other BR I’ve played people will always go out of their way to finish someone even if they don’t down them or if there is no incentive.
---
That's cool too, man. BR's not for everyone and I feel like once I reach level 10 and unlock the full vault I wont play it ever again lol
---
I regularly nuke near Garahan, more specifically on Vault 63, as the surrounding area is awesome when I need a Cobalt/Crimson mix.
---
I think it’s just how it is now because it’s the “sneak peek” of nuclear winter, I think when they actually release the whole thing it’s going to be opened to everyone in adventure/survival
---
I'll most likely make a mod on PC for that soon.
---
I picked it up from my close personal friend Phoenix.  Will be at bottom of his list and I don’t believe he carries it 100% of the time.  Soulless watoga bot or their whitespring counterparts may have it too.
---
Keep being salty!
---
Oh I was talking about the the laser rifle/pistol but that’s good to know too
---
People have mule characters that carry all the crap that their main character can’t hold due to the weight restriction.  Just saying that the low level new players would be easily distinguished from those types since people with mules don’t ask questions, know where they’re going, don’t exhibit newb behaviorisms.
---
Sure, whatever makes you feel better, salty boy!
---
signaling location of things, basically useless
---
From what I've experienced it's 1-2 minutes waiting on the lobby to fill, 2 mins to start and another minute to drop and load in the game.
---
Why was it awkward for you?
---
it's pretty dope. I have been thinking about that more than hunting for Legendaries while finishing up at work today.
---
One particular time when I was about LVL 3, I stumbled upon a cave entrance from the top of a mountain ridge. I was eager to explore this cave. So I jumped on in and actually landed on a ledge before the ground of the cave and noticed something large lurking in the shadows. 
---
I was petrified.
---
Ofcourse, it was an ALPHA DeathClaw nest and I just happened to be balancing between life and death. I had two options; stay safely on this nice ledge and starve to death. Or jump down (it was pretty high up)try to run away from this beast of a creature. Either way, it didn’t look good. 
---
But then I thought... wait .. there are other REAL people around me. So, like the smart guy I was, I called upon a LVL 120 that was nearby and told him of my dire situation. After some negotiations he finally decided to meet me at the cave and then proceeded to slay the beast with no problem. I was ever so grateful for my safe and successful rescue. As a gift for his hard work, I gave him a bottle of bourbon and a love emote. 
---
After that we both went upon our business.
---
Thanks again my friend for saving my low level ass from that deathclaw. You are a true hero.
---
Depends on what you are trying to take out.
---
I used an Executioners combat rifle for a long time.  
---
Took down my first 7 or so (L50) SBs with it.   
---
When I went after the first L65 SB...barely scratched it.
---
Resolute Veteran and AA 308 LMG worked on L65 and L80 SBs, but I think both of those are considered heavy.
---
Not died persay. At least not in the books.
---
Is this your first time playing a BR game?
---
Damn, good luck!
---
They need to join the enclave
---
It's a standard mechanic, it's time for people to get to know their squad mates, plan their route, etc. Right now there's always a full lobby because the game mode is new and it's a free week, but you might need that two minutes for enough people to join later in the mode's life cycle. Also, as of right now this is the only way to explore the terminals, holotapes, etc in vault 51. I assume it will be an area explorable in adventure/survival mode once the full version releases. Makes sense that they wouldn't release it as an area in the game and then remove it, I can see a lot of things going wrong with that
---
You look under demos?
---
Well,  I’m doing it wrong.  will you teach me? I ran a marksman rifle up until I found a gauss. I can pop scorched all day long, but anything else I can only tenderize the meat before I have to run in to beat it down.
---
I was not gifted with enough rifle perks to buff damage or a legendary rifle. How do you pull it off?
---
Much of it is, yes. The roadmap mentions raids and "new features" for NW. We do not know for certain what the "new features" will be. It's also fair to assume they will continue time based events during this portion of the roadmap.
---
I could seriously see Bethesda adding paper bag skins to the atom shop, if it were possible.
---
Yay! Maths!
---
Well played, you’re too intelligent to play this game, my friend...
---
I love it, but i sadly do play on an HDD so i don't really get to load in until it is too late at which i still lag for a while.
---
Nope you’ve just had not so great luck so far!
---
Lol sounds about right
---
... And yet here we are, where people are asking how to claim/open their crate rewards &amp; they'll skip NW for Wastelanders not realising all the other content for NW to come that isn't the battle royale game mode.
---
First BR for me but I don’t see how it’s awkward. Just stand there.  Check your phone. Take a leak. Grab a frosty beverage. Then go kick some ass.
---
Yes really!
---
Those are some of my best sellers. But sadly, I’m on pc.
---
I mean a flair for this subreddit
---
Is it Fornite? That shit always stuck me as a forgiving game for the kiddos. 
---
Don’t even have to make the tactical decision to finish your freaking targets. Just show up and get your ribbons!
---
Ah...
---
Where ?
---
It’s on sale this week too
---
Oh yes, give me more of your tears!
---
Yep, tried it with a TS 10mm, and AAE Combat Shotgun both. Really makes scrounging in low level areas tedious without it.
---
Gives you something to do while you’re waiting for the other players, gives everyone a chance to chose their perk load out.
---
Chill. I’m super introverted in real life, but still manage to have fun while waiting for the match to start. 
---
There’s quite a bit of lore hidden around in Vault 51, look around and read.
---
lol :D
---
Das wird daran liegen, dass ich aus Deutschland komme. Sorry, hatte ich nicht gerafft ;)
---
Check r/fo76bazaar to see what it’s selling for (not selling for) on your platform.
---
gives you something to do while the 52nd player loads in - which is certainly more entertaining that watching clock hands spin.
---
It's just that one damn plate, I know the devs put it there just for the LOLs
---
Its every two days lol
---
As if when I drop junk I want them to see it
---
Oh I looked at your creepy history well before the juvenile punch drool bullshit, don't flatter yourself.
---
Imagine being such a social pariah IRL that you need to troll reddit to get some semblance of attention.
---
I'm the same way man, played an hour yesterday and a couple hours this morning. Ordered it a few hours ago. I'm glad I waited for this game and I think a lot of people are going to get into this game now with the trial going on. I just hope people give it a chance.
---
Had winning matches with 18 to 23 minutes on timer at the end. Add 3-4 min preparation/loading to that. But unlucky match can be ended in less than a minute.
---
Yeah.
---
Just bought the game a week ago and had only one server disconnect, until last night...then 3 in about 2 hours of playtime.
---
The match is often times filling up during this period and people can also change their PERK cards before that match starts.
---
Hell yeah im going to fk up everyon...i died after 22 seconds!
---
This post is garbage and you should feel bad for making it.
---
PUNCH PUNCH PUNCH drool drool
---
Drool
---
You can't chip their health away anymore afaik when they patched out slap damage it totally removed it. Now you have to have pacifist off to return the attack to initiate pvp.
---
Or just randomize one of 6 maps (for each map region in game) and picking one of the six before the game starts.
---
Whatever they are they are coming for you.....hide!
---
Yup my blood is boiling that your topic got removed
---
I can go all day, creeper.
---
Keep it up
---
Signalling teammates without using a microphone. Poison attacks apparently lower damage resistance (bleedout, radscorpion), and some players make good use of spawning swarms of bloatflies - the syringer is a kind of weird support weapon
---
I get kicked out even if i don't have files for 76. This is bs.
---
Das sehe ich erst jetzt ;). Falls du mal wieder was brauchst, meldest dich halt einfach! Ressourcen habe ich normalerweise immer ein wenig was übrig.
---
Honestly the easiest thing to do is check the Fallout 76 trade subreddits.  That will give you a baseline as to what is popular and what is scrip fodder.  The popular items change from time to time but that is your best bet.
---
We’re are all my holo games?
---
No you get a Chair for your survival camp at rank ten
---
Fallout’s mechanics in terms of shooting aren’t as smooth as a FPS. Just in terms of fluidity. But, Fallout in a way has things none of those games have in a PVE sense. I’m talking like FO4 on legendary and you’re a level 12 carrying around a pipe Revolver. You’re playing a shooter in a survival situation where you have to weigh all your resources to survive. Your enemies are hard to kill but if something breaths on you, you die. I think Fallout is absolutely a great format for a more serious shooter game. But, that’s not what BR is. BR is a Battle Royale but it’s also a very casual thing. It’s nowhere near as precise as a COD or Halo game. I think they could make a serious game in the future where you adventure like any other Fallout game but the mechanics of guns could be taken more seriously. I think they could take it really far. But, as of right now if I want to play multiplayer I'll pop in H5.
---
The bull barrel? God i hope so
---
I've had a bloodied FFR + AGI Submachine gun that's been sitting around a AA SS +AGI golf club and AA lead pipe with SS and str. They can all be yours. Hey if your valuing one stars (any 1 star) at 2k these should be a steal at 3k
---
Pretty obvious when shots are landing...
---
You discovered the Liberators Bivuac...
---
Let’s see how pathetic you can get. I’m going to see how many times o can get you to reply just by saying
---
Vault 51 isn't a reference to the fact that there's 52 players... It's a reference to the fact that there's 51 bodies
---
I'm not saying I wanted another No Man's Sky, but I'd rather a game be fixed than never fixed if it does arrive broken.
---
yes, you need to make blueprints.
---
Yeah that one i miss it
---
Well, 52 players, one survives, 51 dead.
---
Yes I’m crying...over what I’m not sure of, but I’m crying because you say so
---
Pretty much there already.  
---
Playing for 1 min Bc it’s a heavy spawn zone. And waiting 5+ min to reload in is getting old. 
---
The map is way too small for this many people.
---
Because you are surrounded by moronic children.
---
Lol. I just went through that yesterday and many other times of coursebut it was green no matter how much i inched it and it wouldnt place. Stay red and ill know it going green gives me hope.
---
I had a guy visit my vending machines last night while I was tinkering inside. I heard him go "oh thank god someone with good stuff to sell. Nice lots of good plans" .  followed by the chaching chaching sounds as he did a bit of shopping.  I guess with all the new folks the stuff people are after is way more spread out across server instances. might be time to just mule those caps until next week.
---
With that amount of brain power you should be studying rocket science not playing fallout.
---
The silver version of the statue is at level 24. So maybe the last one is 36? Or maybe that’s saved for rank 100
---
ps4 has the same problem.
---
I was having this problem till I realised the game rebound my push to talk key to capslock for some reason
---
Sorry. *Then go get your ass kicked. 
---
Lolol jk I’ve never made it very far but it’s a fun rush.
---
Run you fool.
---
Except there aren't 51 bodies because most winners have some of their team at the end.
---
There is a quest (other than the 2 named)  that uses the Syringer.
---
Your the real MVP.
---
Five months later and numerous patches... crickets
---
I don't know of any battle royales where you can reconnect in the middle of a match
---
Hah, facepalm, i get my fallout)))
---
do and caps. The real reward are at the end of each level up
---
Lol you playing Who Framed Roger Rabbit over there?
---
The title got me. Not gonna lie.
---
It’s still only a preview I imagine the full game mode will have much more exploration
---
I stand corrected. Thought those were locked off for this week. Dang it. Gotta find some more now.
---
No, you're breathtaking!
---
They're everywhere, they're everywhere....
---
Imagine there couldn't have been more than one overseer in the lore
---
This is correct. There are inherently other much bigger problems, such as server instability, crashing to the main screen, issues with events they keep releasing without proper testing (Arktos, sheepsquatch, the vending machines, etc). 
---
But sure let's release more garbage to the public rather than fix the issues we already have.
---
Firing flares?
---
hah!
---
"here... you're gonna carry this, and take up precious inventory space for at LEAST 10-15 levels, before you figure out you're gonna find something better, and finally drop it... you're welcome"
---
If you spawn with 2 or 3 squads in the same area it could be over in 20 seconds.

I took out 3 players in no time at all with it.

Knowing Beth you can bet Rank 10 is a drill and a plan you already know.

Literally my last handful of deaths have come at the hands of a Gatling gun
---
I've had a 3* executioner's plasma gat for ages that I love so much, and never seem to see mods for it, only gattling laser mods. I would love to know where I can find mods for it as well aside from building a bunch and scrapping as it's kinda expensive on materials
---
Do you get a notification that your camp cannot be placed? Are you near a restricted area that does not allow camps to be placed? Also the "It needs support" issue has been there since day one. Without a sufficiently large flat are, the only way to really avoid it with blueprints is to build a one foundation block structure where there's only one foundation on the ground and everything else would float above it.
---
I basically had to stop watching a couple of my favorite streamers for E3, simply because they never touched Fo76 but spent an hour acting like the game is still as bad as it was as launch.
---
Fo76 has been pretty decent for months, and its only getting better.
---
I don't get that last bit. "So the person who gets luckiest and finds a 3* assault rifle wins?" Thought there wasn't any legendary effects
---
Too laugh at you idiots of course.
---
Not even worth 500
---
Ah! The FIRST reasonable suggestion! Thank You kind sir!  All the other responses were immature, ridiculous, mocking and... well.... ok, funny. I laughed. But still...!
---
I’m saying there’s no legendaries, so that you can’t just be lucky to win, you have to actually have some skill.
---
Destroys anyone who aren't wearing rad protection.
---
I got all the time in the world, bro
---
I always wonder just how pathetic someone's kids/SO would think their Daddy is if they could see their online history
---
How about you show em and get back to me?
---
You get Overseer rank exp, your character exp, caps and if you ranked up, the rank reward.
---
I know from how quickly it kills everything that my primed Zealot's, Explosive, FR LMG is an absolute Beast, it can melt a level 80 SB in under 3 seconds, but it also empties a 75 round Mag that quickly too, and the ammo requires a lot of grinding for materials.
---
I'm not really sure if being Primed really does that much for it, but will find out soon.
---
Mire is too soggy to burn.
---
Oh my god, thank you. That’s the issue.
---
Yes. My team's was the second nuke, and it took out 2 players!
---
Unfortunately most of the reviews are from rage posts during release. Had the game released in the state it is in now it would be a different story. Great time to start playing!
---
PUBG has it if I recall, but I think not letting people reconnect due to crashes is kind of unnecessary
---
I don’t get it, it’s June 11th today and the alpha code was wrong???
---
Neither, just XP and caps. Though you do get a plan for a swanky overseer's chair. I have 5 wins under my belt and every game has the same rewards, minus the bonuses that show up on the level up preview screen.
---
Yes they do
---
yeah mine didnt even work without push to talk so unfortunately not my fix
---
My reflexes are long gone too... so I sprinted center of map as soon as I got a gun and hid in a shed and shot anyone who came through the door. This was good for a few top 10 finishes. I don't think that's how you're supposed to play BR games but hey.
---
Was one of my main gripes as well,   Performance being number #2.    
---
When the game launched in Borderless Windowed mode I got 90+ FPS, now I'm lucky if I break 30 FPS
---
You actually retyped this instead of copy and paste?
---
Hahahahahahahhahaha
---
I, not o
---
If only the two-shot weapons changed then it's probably just a pip-boy readout fix. It wasn't counting the second projectile before.
---
I base my initial opinion off my initial attempt...yes. And initially I did not dig it.
---
 Ever try a food and realize you don't like it?  Might think yuck but tastes better with sauce.  I also rolled down a hill in a barrel once when I was young...does not mean I need to try it again just to see if I also vomit the second time ☺
---
I plan to try it again.  My internet is slow, I work 50 hours a week and then 10 more on my farm that same week, I am not young...trying again is not going to make me better then that person who executed me.  I fully understand I am a free kill.
---
So initially I did not dig it..based on all this info.  I will try since it does seem people do like it.  I also know I will always be carried by my team which is hard for me since I am usually a team lead in life.
---
I already got some good advice.  If you have any to help I would appreciate it
---
Oh, okay I got you. To be honest there is a little luck with perk cards. I'm lvl 7 and five of mine have been duplicates. I still feel good with a build but everyone plays slightly differently with that design
---
Only if it’s aesthetic
---
I’ve tried updating them and sending new ones but still the same.
---
The crates are icons...
---
Yupppp.
---
Keep moving around and trying from different angles.  If theres one thing I've learned in camp building it's that if its green its green, you just may not be placing it down right.  That's not sarcasm either.  Sometimes crouching and point the crosshairs at the sky while its green actually does the trick or going around to the other side or placing it from the roof etc.  Again not kidding.
---
Also try picking up whatever it attaches to or is adjacent to and putting them down in a different order.  Ie place c before a before b or bac or ABC.  Again, no sarcasm, being 100% with you.
---
Yes, I know, it shouldn't be like that etc etc etc.
---
There ya go... Copy Paste that one...
---
Good job!
---
The flares actually work better than in fallout 4 but the draw distance is garbage. For anyone to be able to see the flare in the air, they'd have to be pretty much right where the shooter is.
---
Does that xp level up adventure character cause it said i leveled up in adventure but i didnt and cant see any difference in total xp?
---
I punched the first dude I saw to death in the first game I played. He had a 10mm. It was funny.
---
Yeah, and they don’t always give up a mod every time you scrap. Now I’m out of copper and aluminum, with no beam focuser to show for it. :(
---
Same here.  This whole week is going to be a bit odd.
---
I've played it recently and I call it trash still, attempted to enter akros lab dungeon 16 times and crashed on each of those attempts. When I bought Tricentennial edition I expected a game like ESO.
---
These prices always baffle me lol. Nice bit of kit though.
---
have some silver
---
Nah, toxic water + spoiled veggies.
---
Same here, and I historically don't like battle royale games.
---
Same here, but without super builds and legendaries it's super duper fun.
---
yeah, i want a no-legendary mode. I think they ruin the game but i have to use them to be able to keep up.
---
TBF the main quest line can put you into confusing situations from a scaling perspective. You can advance it by stumbling onto quests ahead of time and can almost bypass certain things by accident. I made the mistake myself of just pushing ahead with the story and made too much progress too quickly. I found within a very short time that the game took a sharp jump in difficulty from where it had started by the time I left the ash heap. This is a great game but it isn’t like other fallout games where you can sort of skirt by without really planning your build out that much. I spent my first 60+ levels really not doing much damage until I took the time to really plan out what playstyle I wanted and how to make the best build to support that. If you’re having trouble as a solo player there is a lot to be said for investing in stealth and sneak attack perks, if you pick the right ones and shore that up with your weapons perks you will find that most instances like Blackwater mine become much much easier very quickly.
---
Yup but still better than nothing
---
Yup and at this point only low levels populate the other 2 modes so I stick to BR. Almost level 20, been grinding this shit having fun, so far my most kills in one game is 21, my team died right at the start somehow so I hunted down as many people as I could. Spamming the grenade launchers over hills and mountains actually works pretty well at dispersing people and getting random kills lmao
---
True, but I still think the truly malicious a holes will continue to haunt us
---
There I no “crates” to open they are just player icons
---
You have to find it in the world
---
&gt;The Ninja Perk does work on Unarmed,
---
I thought it was obvious melee compromises all. On my melee alt I use "unarmed" weapons, swords and clubs all together as I have only generic melee perks.
---
&gt;My Instigating +Swing Speed + STR, Death Claw Gauntlet has me a bit Confused, it's definitely affected by the Ninja Perk, but there is also significant (and confusing) differences between Normal (not crouched) (1232 1st hit, 1105 subsequent hits), Hidden (2272 1st Hit, never got to try subsequent), and Caution (randomly 1668 or 2272 1st hit)
---
That's odd, that instigating would not work? 
---
When you hit an enemy when you are in caution, if you've recenty hit it already, it won't do sneak damage. If that particular enemy is not looking at you right that very moment, you can get sneak damage. It's fairly consistent to me, particularly with guns as you can shoot several enemies, all for sneak damage.
---
I am sure you will for a week then when its dead and no one plays it i am sure you will have fun finding no one to play with.
---
I salute you
---
If the coding is anything like FO4 then they are not counted as one stack but many different stacks in that bunch. One major issue FO4 had with memory was from your stash. I would have to go around to my towns and pull out all my scrap and drop it. Each resource would be like 20 different piles for a stack of a few hundred. But when you pick them up and drop them again it will only be one stack. This drastically would reduce my stuttering.
---
You know how people always doodle houses or penises? I cant' draw so i doodle lists. Isn't it funny how the Penises are always circumcised and the houses are always colonials Jim?
---
Same here, I've made a few but it might be time to spend an evening farming and building guns lol
---
Mics are good and all, until you get a group of 10 year old squeakers who start yelling into their mics all at once.
---
Constructive criticism sure
---
whats your problem bud?
---
Yeah that is the most annoying thing that people don’t even know what they are talking about. Hopefully with the game being free for a week people will try it out and enjoy the game.
---
legendaries are too important in adventure to scrap. But maybe if they rebalanced everything to actually be usable it would make the game more fun.
---
Currently everyone just wants the same legendary handmade rifles or something.
---
This would also work well. I am mainly curious how they would work with areas that have load-in buildings, would they avoid the areas or just not allow players entrance into them?
---
I require no payment for my endeavors but do greatly appreciate it.
---
... Yes?
---
This behavior IS the fix for the rename dupe exploit.
---
&gt;I don't think that this BR mode will really bring in new players. If I wanted to play BR I would certainly not look for Fallout 76 with its wonky game engine and all related flaws. There are technically way better games available for BR.
---
thats just great dude keep going!
---
"Over by that tree"
---
Man, my plasma has like 15 accuracy,  its awful.  Definitely need mods to up the accuracy
---
Controller in pve, mouse and keyboard pvp
---
PUBG isn't a good shooter and it's arguably the most popular BR game. 
---
Hell, BR gained popularity through mods for ARMA. No reasonable individual would, after spending 5 minutes playing it, call ARMA "smooth".
---
They just dont allow you to go in, the vault tec agricultural centre proved this already
---
No interest. I'd rather they spend the development time fixing bugs and adding content.
---
I think so, I'm pretty sure it takes the same mods as hunting rifle
---
I think they're keeping it up in the air so they can change it with BETA and full release if it doesn't work how they have it currently.
---
I set up camp at a copper node. Probably be there all day smelting. Then it’s off to an aluminum node. Maybe a workshop but the server keeps dumping me. Lol. Sigh.
---
Huh?
---
You mean Bob Kazamakis?
---
I just meant as a business selling a product, you want feedback, regardless of positive / negative.
---
I recognize people like content that I don't care for a visca versca.
---
Why not make it so that the duffel shows up for your stuff and the paper bag shows up for other people's stuff in adv mode?
---
Best of both worlds. Easier to tell which bag is yours also.
---
explosive mainly gets on my nerves. hate killing myself because I can’t find a better handmade
---
You can blame it on the MinMaxers if you wish but even if they was to stop it would still be dead its a PVE game with forced PVP. If you removed the OP builds or just balanced them it would change nothing only a tiny part of the playerbase would care to play the mode.
---
I think I like it, I am just a bit lost on what to do exactly. I am used to more linear games so it definitely is something I need to get used to :)
---
There us one at the gorge workshop (the one between Vauly 76 and Morgantown).
---
Yeah absolutely.
---
Keep in mind they also locked away a bunch of new content behind the mode so some people will play it just for the new stuff or lore. I personally find battle royal modes quite boring, but I have been enjoying every other aspect of the update.
---
I believe this will be very helpful for new players.
---
You have a good resource on how often things respawn? And any good routes for nuclear material?
---
Separate question: does anybody know if they plan on still fully releasing NW before the end of June? Cause if I remember correctly, they said that NW goes live in June. curious if after the trial week they’re gonna take it off and still put it back up before the end of the month
---
I didnt lose anything, dont worry. im on PC and i have like  100,000+ caps worth of gear on me.  including a bloodied swing speed STR super sledge and a traveling leather coat.
---
nothing disappeared
---
Glad I’m not the only one 😃
---
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Talking negatively about Bethesda isn't a good idea here on this sub if you value your karma. You either kneel or you get downvoted. Also I'm betting we keep most of the bugs once game is "complete" like how Fallout 4 has plenty of them like Lever Action Rifle reload not working properly despite they fixed it in Fallout 76 a few months ago.
---
I don’t believe this is correct. From my FO4 experience every time you pick up something it has a unique code but it can be manipulated by picking up a lot of different stacks(of the same resource) in a row to combine them.
---
Remember this is just a trial period, and there are likely to be significant changes before it's done.
---
You’re right, completely forgot Ag-centre was there
---
https://i.imgur.com/N63kydF.gifv
---
But if you were outside of the nuke zone, why did you die? Did dude shoot you in the back?
---
The whole endgame gameplay loop revolves around hunting legendaries. Remove those and what do you do? PVP? Just do NW then.
---
People only using handmades is a perception problem, not a balance problem. Two rifles in particular, the Combat and Radium, are superior to the Handmade for Vats builds.
---
GOD YES
---
no, some of them are item skins
---
Many many of them.
---
Welch is a great place for instance.
---
Just press the button that say "favorite on NW" thats how it works for me.

I know we haven't been seeing eye to eye on this topic, but thank you for keeping the debate civil and not devolving it into insults and name calling.  Props to you for that, my man.
---
What's the difference between a vein and deposit?
---
Yeah so I have been at work, not editing my reddit posts, if you are going to just make stuff up about me changing my arguments to feel better then go right ahead but I didn't edit a thing lol. As for my criticism you really did not read my post, I am not mad at the inclusion of a battle royale mode, just confused what the priorities of this game are. 
---
Yeah I will probably leave it because after months of trying to get some use out of it, and being the last of my close friend group to keep playing the 2 biggest updates to the game have both been pvp, sorry for expressing my opinion that I would like some single player content, how dare I!
---
As for being a child and throwing insults I am not the only one in this conversation who threw one, you called me slow in an earlier post but if you say it then its classy I guess.
---
While I completely agree about buying and selling being down (I’m a seller and this is killing profits) I have found some remarkable deals at the camps that are there
---
I was having that happen a lot last night, probably from the massive amount of new players right now, I was pretty salty after powering up thunder mountain and setting up the fusion core factory only to get disconnected 10 minutes later. A lot of work for 2 cores
---
Oh thank you very much i was struggeling to get the 30 ores
---
I like randomly shooting off into the distance with the gatling gun, super far from where you were pointing.
---
Its not going to be making a lot of money since its not going to draw in people to buy the game and use the Atom shop. The whole royal thing is kind of starting to die off so many clones that all play the same with a slightly changed look about them. If they was to focus more on the PVE i would expect that would bring in more money long term more PVE content the longer people will play higher odds of them using the Atom shop. I could be wrong and this could make a lot of money but i doubt many royal players will go OMG FO76 has a royal mode i better go buy it.
---
Yep exactly. And legendaries are necessary to use against SBQ fights as well
---
It’s in the title of the post
---
Welp, time for a rewatch!
---
Pretty sure I was inside the nuke. I loved it tho
---
Yeah mines mostly for killing scorchbeasts and other large enemys, or just spamming into a crowd of enemy's and hoping for the best
---
Yes I did. Even reloging. Nothing helps.
---
Well, people did, but if you posted it here you'd have gotten a lot of downvotes.

Lucky. My gf and I play exclusively together and hanging out in camp where we will transfer stuff to one another, it happens about 10% of the time. If it’s important, I deal with trading (which yes, is annoying)
---
I have so much junk and .38 ammo that I usually throw together a bunch of modified pipe guns and .38 ammo.    Then I just ask ‘pistol or rifle?’ Then ‘full auto or single fire?’  Give them a sack of ammo to go nuts with.

Acceptance is the first step, you are doing great.
---
Now tell me where the bad digital avatar touched you.

If you have Excavator PA use it. You get I think 3x the yield per vein?
---
You will get 30 in about a minute. They are all over Welch.
---
There was one with three dogs, too. I was making my way down a cliff and stopped to snap a picture because... well, why not?
---
Yeah, it's a very odd omission not allowing the choice of solo, duo, and squad options.
---
I'd rather just play solo q. I know I can still do this technically but I would still be going against full squads with mics.
---
You can place a miner if you take Gorge Junkyard.
---
Say that( **I love this game after trying it free** ) when you pay full price for this game. Turns out paying a triple A game price doesn't result in matching quality. Also don't judge the game by BR, try regular game near end game and expect the crashes, nothing like losing all the work you put in to kill scorch beast queen because of crash or worse lose you legendary weapons due to a server crash after you spent months to get them.
---
That's even more fun with lasers! You see a ghoul charging you, you aim in its general direction but the game decides to shoot somewhere up in the air instead... 🙄
---
Oh, I LIKE this idea!!!!
---
Its new and as such every one and there dog will play it in a month it will be dead just like survival mode apart form people going for the weekly weapon.
---
One you click on to pick up a few, the other you can put a harvester on.  I think.
---
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
---
A vein are those small ore things where u can get 4 ores out of if u wear the excavator armor and deposits are those things where u can put miners on them
---
No probs! Thanks for listening!
---
They're all Atomic Shop items. They're skins, icons c.a.m.p. items, they sort of thing. Once you unlock them they're usable on your entire account.
---
Fill?  No.  But capacity is eaten by stable fluxes and some of their constituents while farming the rest.
---
Ex. last week I got tons of glowing and hardened mass in the nuke zones, but little high radiation fluids.  SO...I sold some, scrapped some hardened for ultracite, and saved what I thought I could use in a single NZ harvest.  (usually no more than a couple hundred of a particular kinda of flora--usually much less, so like 20 GM and HM)  Then I hit the HRF jackpot next NZ, but little flora I needed.  So I used what I could, but then had a not of HRF.  Not giving THAT up, so...yeah, it's not the biggest thing in my stash at the moment, but it hurts.
---
I know that HRF, HM, and GM don't drop on death.  But it's risky to keep them on you, since you can accidentally consume HRF and GM, and HM can accidentally be scrapped.  Especially with the goddamned jumpy menus of late!
---
So then, I decide I wanna stockpile some ultracite .308, because I got a nice legendary LMG.  I've gotta farm lead and steel AND florescent flux.  I can do all of that in one sitting, but not at one time.  So one is going to have to live in my stash or (more likely) I'm going to be carrying around stupid amounts of mats, including stable flux, if it doesn't fit in my stash.  Which is risky...for what immersion benefit?  Sorry, no immersion benefit is worth making hours of my time farming mats a waste.
---
So I put the stable flux in my stash, so I don't risk losing it.  Then I can't fit absurdly overweight items like the otherwise awesome handmade and hunting rifles I just found.  I get why they're heavy on my character--they're pretty awesome, and they want to balance things out.  But in stash?  Item limits make sense for some things more than weight.
---
I shouldn't have to stash stuff in an alt (or alts) because the game is designed wrong.
---
What I’m getting at is at the most granular level, storing the number 10 as data in a system requires less bytes than the number 100.

Nice thank u very much

Aromatically? :) When I put my Glade 18 9mm on full aro...  All those odors better watch out!
---
No offense, just a pun.
---
That one's an armor \*mod\* plan spawn. You want armor plan spawns for this, preferably in the Savage Divide or Mire. Ash Heap and Cranberry Bog should also have a chance, but lower.
---
Any idea what rank?
---
Everyone failing to understand why it’s a problem needs to realize this, if a kill nets you more exp, and a down nets you less, teammates will be more likely to let you 1v1, wait for you to win and have to take cover and reload/heal, and finish off the person you downed. They’ll have more meds, less damaged gear, and more ammo. And all you’ll get is less exp and probably won’t even be able to hit the loot in time. It pushes for toxic play styles and that isn’t okay. We should be working together to wipe squads, not be sitting around waiting for that one guy that’s actually his ass off to get 3 downs and be pushing the last squad member solo so that a bunch of unskilled cowards can net more exp and ride the better players coattails. It’s pathetic.
---
Actually great to see the positive feedback.  It's the I'm quitting but need attention threads that were as annoying as hell.
---
You made an announcement that you’re leaving fallout until the Wastelanders DLC and then you took that part of your post out. The proof is the 6 other people saying things like “bye” and “adios” and all those other sayings. What are they referring to if you never said anything like that. Also you know everytime you make an edit, the message reappears in my inbox. That’s how I know. Because the messages kept reappearing. If you were at work and couldn’t make edits then how were you responding to me in the first place. If you can respond you can edit

thank you for this - that actually makes sense !!!!

People are sick of giving games second chances. Publishers need to release full, competent games at launch otherwise they don't deserve our patience.
---
Bethesda _knew_ how fucked the game was before release but they went ahead anyway. It was arrogant and took the piss, Todd even said it doesn't matter what state a game releases in. Fuck that.
---
I'm trying the game out for free this week and enjoying it and I really hope the game goes on to be fun and do well but we shouldn't forgive or forget Bethesda for the past and we need to keep judging them very harshly to stop this sort of shit from happening again.

I’m glad to see people love the new mode but the posts are becoming extremely redundant. I don’t think everyone needs to post how shockingly surprised they are at how much they enjoy the new mode.

It really kills the ability to play as a team, when one person has to go off and farm mats, because you couldn't store enough of that one thing, and everybody has a little different build/play style.

you can find it on the webpage here :  [https://store.playstation.com](https://store.playstation.com/)  search fallout76 and click try demo, if you're on the actual ps4 store on the console just go to the storepage and press down on the analog stick or dpad a couple times and ull find it.

Honestly I think it might've been in your best interest to preface your post with:

 "I will not answer any private messages regarding this matter, as anything I can talk about, I *have* talked about. If further clarification is needed then a comment is best, as others may have the same question and this will provide everyone the ability to see it."

Then again, that's assuming the notifications are from PMs... As there *are* 326 replies currently to this thread.

I get the same thing with low level legendaries. I used to put low levels in there for newbies at like 50 caps and cheats stims etc but every time I check my camp when I get a sale notification it’s a high level taking them for scrip or cause it’s cheap meds so now I just put a couple modded out level 5-10 weapons and armor for cheap usually high levels don’t take those. When I see a notification and see it’s a low level I’ll travel back to camp and give out a free legendary that I save in my stash now.

Anyone know how long that bundle will last? Gotta wait till my next paycheck to get it. Hopefully at least till this Friday

Fuck the LMG man. I did a dps simulation on it. .50 cal pulls ahead on sustained fire fights due to excessive reload. You literally end up spending as much time reloading a B25 LMG as you do firing it heh. It does have incredible burst though.

store junk, play until you die, have full health again, go back for your bag. Just don’t be afraid to pop into a train station frequently or move your camp.

It'll produce the ore. It actually provides more than walking up, and clicking on it as well, because it just passively mines it as long as you have the junkyard, instead of you mining it, and waiting for the cooldown.

Main advice I would give based on what you said.. try to stay positive. Mix up what you do, change where you go, once you've got a weapon maybe wait a few extra seconds to make sure you're not going to be ambushed. 
---
Main suggestion, don't approach it so competitively, aim to have fun.. someone takes you out quickly, imagine it's a friend and just say "good game, well played" and try to learn from it somehow.
---
Based on what I've read, there's plenty if not most of the player base is pretty casual, I think that's what makes it fun.. it isn't full of the people who normally play battle Royal. Keep that in mind.

Hope you have more fun next time you get to give it a shot! Have a good one!

Hmm...you might be on to something there.

So we can count you out when Wastelanders is released?

Yup they gave us a big wasteland map with a pile of game breaking bugs and no end game or reasonable progression. It seems like its now finally worth the 20 bucks it now costs, not the 80 dollar we paid for being extended beta testers. I only regret buying this game before it was really finished. I'll come back to it next year when its done.

This is great feedback, thank you!

I find PA to be a bad thing. It makes you a much larger target that's easier to hit. I have a hard time hitting regular players (in a hotel on my old laptop so it isn't the best compared to my computer) but when I see a guy in PA I can consistently land headshots so IMO it makes you a much bigger Target and it's not worth it to be honest.

An additional head's up on # 7 (Workshops).  Please be aware that if you claim a workshop, that workshop becomes a PvP area.  Other players may try to take the workshop from you by defeating you in PvP.
---
That being said, I still find taking workshops to be a good way of acquiring resources and XP.  After claiming a workshop, you will have to periodically defend it against waves of enemies (the first defense occurring a minute or so after claiming usually).  Each time you successfully defend it, you get rewards which often include plans for your camp, stimpacks, and purified water, etc.

u/Ladydevann are under armors not intended to be worn in Nuclear Winter? Or is this an oversight? Could we have this changed? Or is it an intended design decision?

That's a workshop.  workshops are no longer under your control when you log out.  When you log in and are connected to a new server you have to re-claim the workshop.

Defending it turns into a daily quest... many do.

Now those I can see being sold around 1k-2k because the dmg wouldn't be fantastic (people are hard for the  gauntlets, pwr fists, handmades, shotguns etc). I have seen some Submachine guns go for decent caps but they're usually TSE, BE or some other explosive variant.

This will prevent you from ever being killed by a player. All they are doing is wasting ammo at that point.

There's actually more posts like this than the one's trashing the game. I'm tired of both. Other people's opinions aren't going to affect if I play the game.

Yeah you're definitely not getting defensive, editing in new comments and continuing to bitch about it. It's ok buddy. You made a thread with a nonsensical title. I'm sorry that you can't get over it and admit that you've made a mistake. But maybe you'll be ok later when you realize that none of this fucking matters. They're just anonymous words on the internet. Don't let them get to you.
---
Especially if they're paid based on clicks.
---
It's not meant to be a "true Bethesda rpg." Never was. Who told you that? Was it Steve perchance? Steve...
---
It's a bug. It's been around since launch.
---
Click install, it will go through the door otions, see the game is installed, and then be done. The button will now appropriately say Play.
---
The rof on the rifles is thier strong point. Put on the recoil attachments and you have a decent substitute for the combat rifle.
---
Still could use some AA love tho.
---
Unless things have changed, might also want to add that "Workshops" are PVP, meaning if you take ownership you are open to PVP. Being in a Party with someone who has a workshop also opens you to PVP. Be aware the "Monster Mash" event (although later) is also PVP.
---
So far my best cards have been:bullet sponge (+60 while firing heavy gun) Master heavy Gunner, Ironclad and Bodyguards. Taking out a 3-man team was the highlight of the build so far
---
tried this
---
I do this too. In the appropriate hunter's longcoat and old fishing hat I hope?
---
I have a short list of junk  items I want to decorate with. Top item, the entire tiny robot model chess set, in the sorority house.maybe a lawn gnome room.
---
How is running to a Drone and shooting it for 20 Minutes a good desgin? Bethesda would have never had that as a must do quest in any other of their games.
---
Oh okay! Thanks! 
---
Is there a way to check the bats cost? I think I might have missed that information. 
---
I really like the handmade as well. 
---
I have one (non-legendary) afghan-inspired in my stash. No stock, drum mag, compensator. Looks awesome
---
I’m no game dev but when I was 14 i /gave 1200000 dirt blocks to my mate in minecraft and crashed our server
---
I had to unsubscribe again post E3 because everyone started their unnecessary bitching again but I'm glad they're changing their tune after finally playing it. Of course there's still a lot who are sticking their nose up to the free trial and it's a shame. It's like give the damn game a chance or shut up. Please.
---
Place traps on floor and cover with roofs. Check Jug's camp builds on YT
---
I thought it only happens when you are on a high place
---
I'm quite sure they gonna do it the first thing.
---
Because they apparently found themselves in a situation where they had a limited supply, so they gave them to those whom they felt would maximize their exposure.  (Of course that’s only if they knew there was a limited amount beforehand). There are a lot of possibilities, and of course I don’t know the reason for sure...I just feel like that makes the most sense because it’s logical.
---
I use an aae laser rifle shit is beast hits way harder than aae handmade with beam splitter it just breaks so fast.
---
*Where was your first time*
---
Sick fuck
---
The fact it holds three is crazy useful
---
No I mean I literally cant sprint, just walk. And in BR itself i can barely walk, it's like walking while both legs are broken. Bug randomly started happening after about 16 overseer levels
---
I just wouldn't want someone on discord watching and calling out our position to someone's buddy..   
---
Or maybe have those who died help spawn more monsters into the area. They had terminals where we waited.. have people after they die log into them and pick what spawns next and watch from the monster cam?
---
You're right! Super weird coincidence now that I mentioned the simulation theory...
---
Watoga wotoga
---
Just figured this out for myself.
---
You can't join him if he's not online...
---
But you can start playing on your own and join him when he comes online, or he can join you. Either way.
---
Progress isn't server-specific - you always join a different server when you log in. Next time he is on just form a party :)
---
I played for about 5 hours last night and am only level 8 haha I must have been doing something wrong
---
A terrible, terrible person... but a great raider!!!
---
I am astounded at how fickle the small sample of the player base that dwells in this sub is...
---
When the TSE debacle was raging there were many, myself included, that said that balancing a game with both PvP and PvE maintaining hocus-pocus magical effects was impossible. 
---
The 'legendary' mechanic was debatable in FO4 with a single prefix and single-player PvE only and inane in this game with three prefixes and room for five in the future and PvP and PVE, single player and coop, all thrown into the mix.
---
We got ripped to shreds for being philistines in pure reddit style. No upholding the opinions, just 'you're wrong and this is the next best thing since sliced bread because I say it is and you are wrong'.
---
Fast forward to now and no legendaries is fantastic, can we please have moar of this please?
---
It has taken a game mode that has been beaten within an inch of its life with a sprinkle of Fallout icing on top, which fits in Fallout like the proverbial square peg, to suddenly make people turn on a dime.
---
And if the endless stream of repetitive posts that dwarves the 'is now a good time to come back' lark is anything to go by is like the devs have reinvented the wheel... into an anti-gravity, self-sustaining field.
---
where is all the fun? hand me one!! . Im a newbie playing on my own and is turning to be difficult. if you gonna be dumb you gotta be tough...
---
I have a furious gat, furious lmg, and furious gat plas, and all of them are getting the same number on all hits.  i've relogged, tried all different perk setups, i sooooooooo don't understand this.  my dissappoint level is through the world :(
---
also my 1* aa gat is getting DOUBLE the numbers of my furious gat.  I don't understand :(  I am do disappoint.
---
There’s a first time for everything lol
---
Wish I could.  Cant figure out how to make my mic work.  My computer either uses my headphones as headphones or headphones as mic no clue how to get it to use them as both
---
Wow and I thought I was jaded! ;)   
---
The bug report thing, I can assure you there is a bit of a "Hate/Hate/Love" situation there, otherwise I would have received comments from Community Managers from the start, vs complete radio silence until you (Reddit) forced their hand.   
---
Even after the first Community Manager assigned to me wasn't passing my information up "in a timely manner" (in my opinion), it was quite a while before they really started to focus, publicly, and acknowledge the issues.   
---
He'll have the reason I did this was because their "known issues" section was comically insufficient, with at most 15 or 20 issues listed of the thousands at launch. 
---
Now in your defense (you say you're joking BR it's a solid point)someone high up in BGS might have had the exact same thought and that could be why some of the obstacles were removed and communication started happening quickly, wanting me to do a good amount of the heavy lifting for them.  
---
It's very possible, but for my own sanity I'm, at this time,'going to choose to ignore it as a possibility.   
---
As for the notifications, I might in the future, but largely the point was to remain available, especially since I'm enjoying a mini-vacation @ E3 and have spent a good amount of time sleeping or in my AirBnB... (Aka have time to kill).  
---
It was forgone there would be questions, gripes and praise and vitriol aired and making people feel heard is part of the Bug Roundup pages.  
---
(Crap it does sound like I'm doing bug hunting and PR for them...). 
---
Thanks again, we will see what happens after E3
---
Rly i thought it would give me the scrap
---
I learned it by scraping. Took a lot of guns though... Tesla rifles drop rarely to begin with. Sometimes the BOS or watoga bots sell it.
---
You might want to ask in f76marketplave to pay for someone else to mod for for you. Will probably cost a few hundred caps, but it's one time, so yea...
---
Do you have an empty ap bar
---
Install the ore glow mod and goto the outerskirts of mount blair
---
I did think of that but you still can see the enemy team that took you down first before your team mates. 🤷‍♂️
---
Oh well. I only asked cause I wanted to see more action. If you get a player or team that only hunkers down at a spot.
---
Wow, someone doubting someone online, what a shocker.
---
Lol im on Xbox
---
Social menu on the title screen, invite to a team, then you can start as a team.
---
Cool. Works similar to GTA Online or Red Dead Online then? How does that work if I start a base and then move to his session later, does it start my stuff over?
---
I'm not that much in to either survival or BR modes and to be honest, if I had to pick one perminantlry it would be survival. 
---
I tried br but I have such a bad taste about it being free for now but costing money after the 17. 
---
I thought it was forever dlc included with purchase. 
---
I don't really give a sh!t about the company's need to make money, since it was bassed off delivering a full game.
---
To be honest, I am a die-hard fallout fan And I've enjoyed 76 alot more then most others I think, or by comments made for sure. 
---
With that said, and with all the issues, bugs, and problems it's like if I, a electrician were to do a job, and get paid by the customer. Then the work I did was subpar or unfinished and I keep chipping away at it. Now, it's been finished for 7 full months and (where I keep coming back with patch or hot fixes to make that light turn on) 
---
So the scene is, were sitting at the customers table, and my green light (adventure) my yellow light (survival) are working. Mostly. 
---
I ask my customer, hey, you know what would go great in this yellow traffic light? The one that you paid for a full traffic light but it's been 7 months, were going to have to start charging you more for that red light on top, because fuck you that's ehy.. even after telling you free content for life, and that I am also going to make you pay for repair kits for the switch, while you could fix it, you will pay for the parts and do it your self. Not an advantage, but still there. 
---
So I say nay, we are but men.
---
This is only a tribute.
---
Oh yeah I see. I’m positive they are as well sadly... 
---
but I must admit. The mg42 LMG is really pulling me in the heavy direction because you still hold it normally even without PA, which I’m not using. 
---
Plus, it’s just a damn neat weapon in general in all ways
---
This. Just create a valid bag with some junk. Then transfer things of value into it.
---
True it does take a long but the PvP itself is fun too, so together these things makes the game mode much more fun, because I feel rewarded for it. I both get skins and furniture in Adventure mode and lore from terminals and such. While in say...Fortnite, I get skins for...the same game mode. Nuclear Winter is a sidegame to 76, with rewards to the main game.
---
They need to just rescale the damage against players it wouldn’t be hard. Import the same damage scale from NW but keep the monster damage the same from the legendaries. (Keep in mind I say it’s easy but I actually have no fucking clue)
---
Only the strong survive.
---
In the social menu, invite your friend as a team and then you can queue up. 
---
I don’t know if you can still matchmake to fill the other team slots or not (haven’t tried it).
---
Nope, happens in Vault 51 and carries over to when I spawn, no AP drain, full bar, nothing on me but its like I transformed into a slug. I saw someone else report the same problem
---
You can pick a SPECIAL stat and then an unrelated perk under another SPECIAL, sure this isn't what happened?
---
I lasted long enough to see the scorched beast once. I was stuck between another player, two Mirelurks, and then the damn scorchbeast swept overhead.
---
Didn’t survive.
---
Just bugs me that they would retcon their own lore...
---
It would be such a good idea for them to make it so that when you die you go back to the vault and can explore or ready up for another game, rather than having to reload into the next game
---
Yes, just started for me in the past 15 minutes, twice in a row. Trying again.
---
Does your computer have a mic input as well as a headphone input?  If so you need to buy a splitter
---
Yes but they’re adding human NPC’s with another full length campaign, and dialogue. That’s what I’m talking about
---
Regardless of whether or not the Deathclaw Gauntlet itself has innate armor piercing, when you get to the 1k+ damage range, a lot of enemies simply don't have high enough armor to negate much of the damage at all.
---
Armor only works when it's reducing damage by more than ~1%, which requires an armor value of about 15% of the weapon's damage output. If you're using an armor-piercing effect, then they'll need a proportionally-higher armor value to defend against it, for example up to about 60% of the damage if you're using Incisor 3. Most enemies won't have enough armor to effectively deal with two-handed melee weapons or Deathclaw Gauntlets.
---
This would be awesome.
---
Make up your mind. Nuclear Winter or No Worries?
---
How do the nukes work in nw
---
It has two inputs.  Both work with my headphones.  As you can tell I'm very new to pc
---
Yeah okay I might test my luck a few times since I’ve just collected loads of junk. 
---
But yeah I didn’t think of going to the marketplace. Thanks for noticing m8
---
You've got allot of anger, I respect that,  but I don't think this is productive for either of us.    
---
I'm cautiously, Guardedly, optimistic...  
---
Guarded because of the missteps and lies at launch, the lack of promised transparency etc..   
---
You are bitter and ATM unforgiving of the mistakes and missteps and what you see as an incomplete game.  
---
I see you, I hear you, I respect your voice.   
---
True test is if Bethesda hears you, and if they respect your voice, even if they don't agree with it.   
---
That is my summary and take away, I hope I've understood you, half the reason I do the Bug pages is to give people a voice, make us all heard, so I'm trying the same here
---
Less shocking than someone coming up with a bullshit story about being an innocent victim of circumstance.
---
But this will only work with a table in your environment.
---
Maybe...didn't  know that was possible. This is my 3rd character and i dodnt know that was possible
---
Some times a launcher refresh (fully close the launcher and reload it) can help as well.
---
nothings stopping you from making a weak build but you.
---
Now What?
---
It's never been stated outright, but the howling on the air, excess charisma, and raspy voice have lead me to believe that Three Dog is a reference to a very famous radio DJ that used a radio station on the Mexican border that was powerful enough to reach most of the continental United States at night. His name was *Wolfman Jack* and he ran a very successful show for a long time throughout the 60s and 70s.
---

---
Which is why they want feedback :)
---
Just practice with another person that knows how to do it. I did my first one at level 110 I believe. I’ve been keeping track and I launched my 150th nuke last week. 
---
I blast through the silo with a TSE Troubleshooter’s .50 cal and use around 5000 rounds.
---
I've played all the Fallout games, and they have all been a bit buggy upon release, I expected the same if not worse from this one so I waited a bit to buy and was pleasantly surprised with a 30% savings. The game definitely had some issues (still does), but the worst of them was caused by other players exploiting the game mechanics to ruin the experience of others, that has fortunately been all but eliminated at this point.
---
I admit I walked away several times out of frustration with the Crashes &amp; Disconnects, and even bitched &amp; vented a few times over disappearing items, but I kept on playing because it's fun and entertaining.
---
If I stopped playing today (and I'm not about to quit, this game is like Crack, and I'm a total addict), I feel I've gotten my moneys worth, and I know it will only get better.
---
I don't know man, all my junk sells pretty quickly and my legendary items are either sold for caps or scrip. I just gave stable flux to someone so that they do a full harvest at Billings Homestead for me and bring back the wheat and corn to make whisky. Until now I don't have any *big* issue with stash. 
---
Regarding your point about making ammo, can you not just buy the steel? People will gladly sell that and save you time.
---
There is so much potential to bring back beloved outfits from previous titles in the atom shop. Where are they??
---
Online survival rpgs kinda created the whole battle royal genre no?
---
Honestly most the hate was pretty launch.
---
In situations like this I have found that server hopping will reset the quest to the last successful checkpoint.
---
Then you can repeat the correct steps and move forward.
---
The Mire being added to NW during the Halloween season would be perfect since it’s eerie and creepy as hell at night
---
It's not Caps Lock, is it?
---
FuckingFuckingFuckingFuckingFucking
---
Nice, point out a technicality and me so smart start patronizing the guy? Even if that's true, downing a player take's far more damage than actually killing them I would assume? So, OP should get more XP for downing them and teammates should only get some for actually killing the guy. For sake of continuity it should be just like adventure and everyone get's same XP regardless. Ops justified in his frustration and this is the perfect place to give Beth feedback.
---
hahah i can agree. 
---
I need this on radio 24/7 
---
[asd ](https://youtu.be/n3Mn6V1IzHw)
---
Your base will still be there but on the new server. (As long as the spot is not taken by a different camp, in that case the game will ask you if you want to stay on that server and move your camp for free or if you want to find a new server where your spot hasnt been taken)
---
We need the Nuclear Protection pods from Fallout 4! Haha
---
Welcome to the community.
---
You are a responder!
---
I played it today for the first time ever because I heard about the free week in media coverage on E3. It's been a shit show since release, but I thought what the hell, I give it a go. And I have to say, so far, I kind of like it. It something like Fallout 4, but then again it's not. It's different, emptier. I feel like an explorer in a new world. Personally, I like exploring, killing a few ghouls with my modded hunting rifle from afar, looting and being on the go again. The atmosphere is really nice, the graphics feel dated but functional (to be clear, Fallout 4 also looked dated when it came out). No way of telling whether I will enjoy this game in a few days still, but it doesn't look half as bad as they all say.
---
Yeah. But I'm sure he was asking about the crate icons specifically. When I saw them I also they were crates you can open for something.
---
Been playing al evening, level 6 atm and I’m having a blast. It’s really a ‘sneak peek’ and much room for improvement. Do you know how to open the reward stashes?
---
They hit way too soft for the ROF to even matter and I'm not sure how much AA would even help honestly. Enemies with low resistances like Ghouls are still bullet sponges.
---
Amazing? I'd say breath taking!
---
I bet his leg did.
---
It’s Tuesday I am pretty sure they reset
---
Ya, I picked a very popular town to which my first advice was dont... unless you like pain.
---
Thanks for other tips...
---
Going to pick a smelly dark crevasse next attempt.  I will speak out and use my fungus covered stick of whoopass to take out anyone foolish enough to investigate that crack.
---
I'm on your side here but I don't agree with the last part. Should be rewarded for finishing a downed player. But the act of Downing them should be worth as much if not more.
---
Hear you, just wasted an hour of my life chatting with someone about '76 on a post to find out he's not even played '76 and everything he was arguing was second hand.  
---
Almost had a stroke...
---
You need to team up in main menu. Then team leader joins NW
---
Nothing Wrong
---
I sent you an invite
---
Can it come in raw ore form? I'm not gonna lie, I only got enough to make an excavator set for the quest.
---
Would you be able to answer some questions from someone who's never played yet?
---
Spectators could affect matches by pointing out enemies to the players
---
Plus it's fantastic for anti-bloodied in pvp.
---
Pistols are by far the hardest to make work. I have done  each type of basic weapon except for fully automatic rifle at least up to lvl50. Melee too easy. Hvy wep. too easy once at like lvl 35 or so. I feel like rifles have most variablity, so depending on your weapon and your perk loadout they could be very easy or a little difficult. Energy is rough with no armor penetration. Pistols with every possible perk still relies on Vats for any real damage. This means, when you're in your power armor, you eat fusion cores for breakfast lunch and dinner. And of course there are no really great pistols in the game the best probably being the black powder which you have to go pirate on and carry multiple so you get enough shots off, so you are heavily reliant on finding the right type of legendaries. I guess if I bloodied my pistol build it would be powerful enough, but  ehh...more bloodied.
---
Wait so I literally just need a nuclear keycard to complete I am become death?
---
Never forget the mistakes, but we have to give them credit for cleaning up the mess, otherwise what incentive will they have to do it next time?   
---
(And yes, to error is human and there will be a next time)
---
This wasnt my first comment with him so get off my balls.
---
My opinion is just as valid as his given this is the perfect place for our feedback.
---
And all along, nobody wanted it.
---
Sure that’s fine. It’s just the people who just hate for no reason.
---
i don't have the best internet so i won't be able to play it on ps4 for free but after the E3 showcase i bought it and now waiting to go out and explore the wasteland. my main gripe was the no npcs but with that being added I'm all in
---
This guy gets it =D
---
Yeah especially since people keep stealing kills out from under me
---
They reset at 5pm PST on Monday.
---
I dont mind making new alts but yea def need way to fully respec.  The current way I think should stat so for like if respec becomes bit expensive.
---
Yo can us cultists get a pardon too?
---
“That didn’t go according to plan. Was there a plan?” No, no there was not. Can’t strategize against chaos
---
Eh, why the hell not? PARDONED
---
Fuck yeah, mothman flys again!
---
No, but hear him out. Maybe the sky is falling this time.
---
Oh I agree. I'd love to be able to toggle the other players as well.
---
don't worry, the game's hit registration errors will ensure skill is never a factor
---
As another said. It’s wise to turn on Passive mode. Slap damage is nulled. 
---
Look to do the main quest line or play some NW (real fun!).
---
Nope it's off. In survival I couldnt sprint so I reset my controls and it worked again. But, now I cant sprint in BR and only walk. Lmao idk what to do at this point
---
haha, damn that autocorrect :D I'll better correct it.
---
Serendipity doesn't work in power armor.
---
Man I can't wait to get home and do some testing using the damage counters...     
---
**Speaking of....**  
---
Anyone tested if "Faster Swing Speed" effects the "hit rate" of continuos damage weapons?  
---
Aka Ripper, Buzz blade, etc
---
The medium or large crates, and some environmental enemies (pve).
---
The game runs like shit still keeps crashing and causing bsod.
---
That's the fucking spirit!
---
He doesn’t mean the whole map, he means the play area can appear anywhere in the map.
---
Did not know it was a three-shot I'm going to pick that up if it's an early weapon now.
---
Good for you. The best thing to grow this game is to help new players out. I got griefed by higher level players and just quit because it wasn’t any fun anymore to keep running from these guys who kept killing me even though I never shot back. Kept talking over mic chat like killing a new player made them really cool and how ‘pro’ they were.
---
They have lied about stuff but they have also tried to do better. I hope they learn from their mistakes and future games benefit from it.
---
Just to let you know some on made a similar post on Reddit and a Bethesda dev passed it on to the team.
---
Because of its radiation damage?
---
I’m only curious since I haven’t looked much into bloodied builds and pvp in general actually. But it’s always nice with the knowledge
---
Yeah I saw it after I posted :/
---
I thought someone had went to my c.a.m.p and bought my weapons etc. Turns out I was wrong 😔
---
I would also like to know this
---
I once killed a gopher with a stick!
---
Nothing Wright.
---
The down votes only show how foolish and cowardly others can be. I am not afraid. It costs me nothing to tell the truth.
---
That's really Interesting because the game files showed 5% per hit and no cap, might show we have more stuff to decode in the engine
---
Just curried some molerat, I may require a lot of pardoning 😂
---
Good of you to post it still if it hasn't already been ! Letting you know it's probably coming
---
Yeah if you choose to level up STR you can then tab over &amp; chose say green thumb under perception
---
The disappearing pencil trick
---
Weird comparison but I agree
---
And we thought the Taunton smelled bad
---
This post isn't about myself. I just observed that players tend to follow the meta. Like I said I see from time to time roleplayers but they are very few.
---
Unless they were shooting at you it's also possible they were chasing you around trying to give you water. The number of lowbies who have run from me...
---
The crates are stashes for adventure mode
---
check the trees. Blight and glowing resin turn to crimson and cobalt respectively.

I think they said when they take it out of beta and start seasons that you would have to make a fresh character don’t quote me though
---
People will start complaining that the "witches" caused them to mutate into a newt.
---
this one is Not Working
---
From what I can tell a downed players health begins at 100 again but with a slow drain.
---
the teaser video was AFTER the preorders were confirmed
---
the crates are new stash boxes
---
Yh they can come in raw form too
---
"It seems the mode no one wanted is now ~~loved~~ ***considered less bad than expected*** by ~~most~~ **some people on reddit**".
---
Fixed.
---
And they shouldn't be. A bare handed guy shouldn't have as much dps as a heavy guns user. 
---
Imo making everh equal would be an awful approach.
---
Thank you!! I feel the exact same. It will be interesting to see how the game continues to evolve!
---
Make the file read only?
---
I see there is a backupcfg folder in there now &amp; I'm pretty sure I didn't make it (SNB Torpedo is a pretty strong beer however, who knows).
---
Lol, and you’re doing it a 3rd time. Take your own advice. Remember you are loved.
---
Nobody. I was just discussing the main difference between multiplayer and singleplayer open worlds.
---
The only other thing that comes to mind is that sometimes, if I'm using a weapon that puts me in a non-standard walk cycle - like a heavy weapon or a melee weapon - I'll get stuck in a state where I'm either walking or running-but-going-nowhere-fast until I swap to a weapon that changes the walk cycle (i.e. a rifle), then I swap back.

Awesome!! I’m so glad you gave it a chance and had an open mind!!

I know. It was just a discussion about how a multiplayer enviroment influences people's choices.
---
You've made assumptions about the nature of this game that are just untrue. It's a multiplayer game in the Fallout universe, not a Fallout game proper.

Huh? 🙃...

I'm just quoting OP. I haven't tested it personally.
---
I think solution would be Downs and Kills are two different stats both offering XP. You should only get XP for downing if the enemy is killed, aka an assist.
---
But, then again I don't understand OP's rush. Sure, this is going away for a while but it’s going back. It’s not a freaking race.
---
Who cares its there better enjoy it, and make the best of it.
---
Iirc it's estimated to be a +30-50% dmg bonus not 80%
---
I'm hoping we get more than just each biome. There's a big difference between a Watoga fight and a fight in the rest of the Bog.
---
Not just that, I don't really think the VATS concept fits in a multiplayer game with PVP. It's fine for single player and PVE, but it is essentially a built-in aimbot mechanism.
---
Makes me very, I suppose nervous? You can only use purchased outfits in NW, yet my favorites are from adventure &amp; rewarded for finding/playing.
---
If I see an engineers outfit pop up for hundreds of atoms, not sure how I'll feel about that. I love the mode but this has a weird potential in my eyes.
---
Wow, I had no idea. But then again I hardly use PA. Good to know though.
---
Noooo gun fu wtf!
---
Probably just bad RNG, my favorite to farm is one violent night, let the wendigo scream twice then stop the music and run the timer out, gives you 25ish minutes of ghouls with a pretty good chance of 3* legendaries. Another good one is horde events, kill everything but the boss and more enemies will keep spawning. I have the best luck with super mutant hordes. It seems even with 3* enemies 3* drops aren't super common
---
Btw can you give me examples where they are spottet i cant find the veins
---
If you are on PC, the game gets a lot better with a few mods, like 10000% better. (Mostly QOL features).
---
+12 damage resist per teammate still alive for 36. If I am firing a heavy gun while not wearing PA and with all 3 teammates up then I get 196 damage resist
---
Well, that's.. don't know if I like that.
---
I think they are about to actually start shipping them out, make sure you submitted your ticket!!
---
Do you have the plan for the pitchfork? If you do, where did you find it?
---
Downs and Kills are two different stats and they both offer xp. Have you played it yet? If you haven't I suggest you do. I've never enjoyed battle royal but this was great.
---
Right, because finding people duping is so unlikely. Then jacking their stuff they left on the ground must be nigh impossible.
---
Thank you for the info!
---
I would focus on one type. Shotguns, semi-auto, automatic weapons, melee, unarmed, heavy guns, pistols. I go semi-auto and have a solid sniper build but also keep a handmade rifle for close combat. I have a couple of pistols that are kick ads and sometimes I’ll switch my perks around to use them to change the pace up. Bloody mess and tank killer are musts. Some say don’t worry but I like weight reduction like thruhiker and traveling pharmacy and bandolier. I’m a junk hoarder so I need to reduce weight of other stuff.
---
The other day a lvl 40 something asked me if i could tell him where fort defiance was so i teamed up with him, showed him where it was and helped him get through the government id part of the quest. It was all worth it to hear his response to post-apocalyptic DMV, "titty fucking christ i HATE the DMV!"
---
I’ve literally never been interested in this type of game and I’m still pretty sure I haven’t actually killed anyone in it so far, but I can’t stop playing it and have a blast every single time.
---
I try to do the same. I craft them pocketed leather armor and then whatever weapons I have parts to craft. 
---
I throw in some purified water and cooked food and stimpacks. Then run around with the for a little bit.
---
Its only 3 to 5 shots to down or kill someone depending on your weapon.
---
I still cant find a way to turn it off. The light bleed makes everything so ugly.
---
.....what drugs you got?
---
No problems here. I am sure it's due to high server traffic, but try router reset and console hard restart.
---
I still don’t like it. Never cared for BR. I dislike this more because I fear Bethesda will focus more of their attention now towards it, than the base game.
---
Thirdly, it's also a double standard. If you personally liked it yourself, you praise it. But if you didn't like it, "we didn't ask for it." I don't think anybody asked for Keanu Reeves in Cyberpunk, yet you don't here anybody on the internet going "Oh, **nobody** asked for him to be in it" or "I wish they spent those resources on the game rather than getting famous celebrities."
---
Having trouble connecting after a match.
---
Played two games. The first I made it to the top ten by myself. I only got 3 kills. It seemed to take so long to kill someone but I was always at a range where I couldn't see them well. They were behind a fence, or tall grass and even then I couldn't tell when they actually died. I don't have any experience with BR. Fortnite looks silly and COD was just COD.
---
If im aggressive, it's instant death!  Joystick aiming with a PS4 controller is not a reliable system. Tried it again today, had a bit more fun sneaking carefully. I don't really camp, but i definitely creep about.... making sure not to become an early target, bcuz others don't seem to have the aiming issues i do.
---
Shotgun + Melee STR/AGL heavy is most new player friendly, in my opinion.
---
Did you not see? We get player hubs with new content!!! The space station is a town!!!
---
In the 'main street' for instance, where the assaultron and sentry remains are, there are a buch of them.
---
Talking from memory here, when I go mining to Welch I ignore the Black Titanium, I go there for Coal.
---
Within line of sight of the Train Station there is a house which has a couple of ladders on the back to get to the roof where usually two Mole Miners spawn. In that are I seem to remember there are a few veins too.
---
Yeah, but I cant remember.  I found it somewhere, but that was over 100 levels ago.  Might be able to buy it at a vendor.
---
Pretty sure I have literally everything
---
This might almost be better than giving them Nukashine.
---
Been pkaying sonce the beginning.  There never was any crazy problems, people just like to bitch about something.
---
This is seen by the multiplayer mode as modified files though right? So you cant play nuclear winter with it? 
---
I wasn't able to get the enhanced UI working in multiplayer kept kicking me out for modified files.
---
I feel r/fo76 and r/fallout are pretty similar. Though they disagree on things.
---
Did the console hard restart still nothing. Was strange because I was on for about an hour and just finished uranium fever event and just started with the constant crashes and can’t see any Xbox love party invite notifications either and when I reloaded the game said had to sync data
---
I'm definitely having issues but I'm losing connection randomly while finding a game in NW.
---
Server hopping location with many ghouls. I prefer the Burrows
---
Thank u very very much
---
Well, if it was a duffel bag upon death and a paper bag when we drop something willingly it would be easier for people to know if it is something we don't want or something we are coming back for.
---
The problems at the beginning was the servers going to shit all the time
---
How do three grown vault residents not have 2000 caps between them?
---
Really? I didn't. I was thrilled to see the huge difference when i built a new one.
---
I think I have learned my lesson of preordering a game but when it’s Fallout it’s hard not too! I have played since Fallout 3 but even that was the GOTY edition. It took me a while to figure out how to play Fallout 76 but once I did I really started to enjoy it.
---
Don’t get me wrong, the game is much, much better now than it was at launch, but most of the complaints were blown way out of proportion from the beginning.
---
....psn: Raider-Slothman . Come to me.
---
Thanks for clarification I'll have to give it a go. I'm glad everyones on a level playing field
---
I dunno, bought it for 30ish something on launch, played the msq with my friend and most of it sucked. Had some upsides to it, some quests were kinda interesting if it weren't for servers going down, unannounced maintenence, not being able to party up with my friend, vanishing legendaries... My gf booted it up for the free trial today on ps4 complained about bugs and said its still not good, don't know what this whole subreddit sees in the game but I'm happy for y'all.
---
I always keep my in 1rd person. Good to know!!
---
I’ve been noticing it this afternoon. I’m guessing the influx of new players is a factor.
---
Also been playing since BETA day 1. There were more disconnects in the beginning but overall I don't think it was ever as bad as a lot of people made it out to be. It has it's issues, but they are minor in comparison to the negative publicity it received.
---
Things were *way* worse at launch.
---
Yeah that's what I did, I did alpha
---
So... one 5 minute run to Lucky Hole Mine while wearing excavator armor will yield 200 cannon balls? Nice, maybe I will get a cannon after all.
---
They’ll get better!
---
Not really, this subs much more optimistic
---
Imagine the flaming hell that would be, it would be great
---
Cheers! I think I'm still on some Overseer quests, I finished a Morgantown overseer quest if that helps, and I didn't know pacifist mode existed, thanks!
---
Peirson v. Post, Ghen v. Rich, Keeble v. Hickeringill
---
A lot reviews were about no NPCs and being a mmo.
---
Oh good to know. I usually just hit the install button. It does its thing for a few seconds. And then hit play.
---
I usually find a nice bed to sleep in.
---
I had a great time helping out the newbies... and hunting down the two wanted PKers...
---
What about the repair kits? Did we all just collectively forget about 'cosmetics only'?
---
At first I gave them a hello emote, then they started shooting at me and following me, then randomly stopped shooting and just stood there, and begun, I lured them to ghouls and just ran away. I try my best to communicate with randomers, whenever I see anyone I straight up just wave hello.
---
I'm not at home at the moment but I'll definitely hit you up when I get off work
---
There is one difference, people are not waiting for fortnite 2..
---
But they are waiting for fallout 5, you think people would by fallout 5 if it was a battle royale?
---
I saw everything at launch that was pointed out, it’s good that it isn’t happening as much anymore
---
format's meta will hit a breaking point soon
---
Berserker is damage based on damagr resistance right?
---
Lol, never do Nuke runs the day after reset (aka today)
---
Be grateful the sub is full of positive shit nowadays at least...
---
so the items in the atomic shop are not in the game world ? like lootable from corpses ? or spread throughout the world ?
---
I think it was more like there was no trust to do it well, and I’m pretty sure it’s done well.
---
Well pubg was extremely wonky when it came out and fo76 br plays A LOT better then what pubg did when it came out
---
Thanks for your positive feedback and giving the game a chance regardless of what some people are saying. Hopefully you continue to enjoy it and keep on exploring! Yes the graphics are not the best but it’s a Fallout game, it has its own style.
---
Hell most of the time people haven't played it at all but somehow seem to be experts on how bad it is.
---
Haven't played it, don't plan on playing it, but i am glad to see that nuclear winter is being widely enjoyed by the community.
---
Not true most bad review were about no npcs and a mmo that allows griefing. Iv read a ton of amazon reviews and 1 outta 5 were about the glitches if that.
---
"Burn burn burn. The ring of fire!!"
---
Who gives a shit
---
I was watching a stramer and he showed several terminals that required certain level in NW to access it.
---
Let the losers control some animals or something! Lol.
---
It makes a huge difference when the team can communicate properly to disclose enemy locations. Otherwise every one is basically playing blind.
---
How long? I’m on BST.
---
I had an automatic combat rifle with the 40% additional damage perk card on my second game and it seemed to take forever.
---
This. Please fast track this into an update!
---
its just a skin.  doesn't change anything.
---
Dense mod and fireproof. Explosive weapons don't take a build like bloody but it does take a little mitigation
---
Yeah, ideally there would be no legendary weapons, no levels, no damage affecting perks, and any perks are more for granting convenient benefit but don't inherently make you more powerful than a new player. Weapon damage would be consistent for the same weapon used by different characters.
---
You just pick all your character stats at character creation and effectively all players are equal. Other than a higher Endurance character having slightly higher HP, and other stats affecting other factors.
---
Seek times and fragmentation.  It's not all about throughput, in fact, it's mostly not about throughput.
---
I got a message from a teammate yesterday that said “Quit playing the game you faggot”
---
Things were worse and then people refused to believe they could get better. They got better.
---
Pipe pistol
---
If I may add something, enjoy being lost and clueless. You are new only once!
---
Because you can only have 7 perk cards in NW, are there some cards that are worth 15 points??
---
The picture doesn't give you enough?
---
I kinda thought so lol but figured I'd post the codes just in case of the people in the other comment saying they reset
---
As weird as this may be. The less talking their is on my team, the better we do.
---
I always use my mic and encourage other people to plug them in just by talking which is nice. 
---
But whenever the entire team plugs in their mic I never get a win, like ever.
---
We it’s just me talking, about a 75% of winning.
---
I am rank 20 right now and the more I play, the worse the rewards get btw.
---
The flare gun shoots a flare.
---
The flair gun makes whomever is shot with it absolutely fabulous.
---
Well, yes. With BR being fully functional and being chosen to be released first over Wastelanders. Yes, comparatively BR got more effort and attention in spades.
---
And that trailer was meaningless it was a for display only, photoshopped dialog menu hooked up to currently non-existent skills, some new static objects placed around the space station area, and things running around in slow motion. Don't fall victim to Bethesda PR's misinterpretation game again, Wastelanders will work nothing like how this trailer is falsely leading you it will.
---
*Pipe revolver
---
Just when playing with a gun what provides enough free sight like a shotgun for example.
---
But a laser weapon, even if it's nearly as small as a pumpgun in 3th person, will cover a lot of sight space in 1st person (bad weapon scaling over copied from FO4).
---
That's when  I switch to 3th person.
---
I straight up went and bought a new controller yesterday just so I could use my mic… but no one uses them! Frustrating!
---
Oh man that’s the worst! It’s crazy people are so adamant about something they have never tried....
---
Hmmm I have been leaving survival with an LMG equipped so it may be causing some goofy error with BR somehow, next time I hop on I'll see if I can figure something out
---
I still didn’t my e3 bonus for the 1000 atom purchase.
---
No. I really enjoyed TLJ and put it way over TFA, but I understand why others didn't, and I'm sorry it wasn't something we could both enjoy. Hopefully Episode 9 is good for us both, but if it's the same style that I disliked in TFA, it's not the end of the world - there's enough Star Wars that I do like that nothing they do in the next one is going to make me stop being a fan of the saga.
---
Agreed. I’m glad to see people getting to enjoy the game as much as I do now
---
Yep but that was the damage with all my armor on. Without my armor it was only 100 points more, 1118 in a hazmat suit.
---
They should change to canvas bags.... Hehe
---
You're English isn't bad at all, so great job! :). 
---
I'm a lvl 187 and I've never had something like this happen to me. I've heard of it happening and it aggravates me because it's a shitty thing to do. PvP is cool if you're on the survival server or if both people are willing to participate in adventure mode (i.e. taking a workshop or just plain ol' duking it out)...but to lure people in like that under the pretense of a trade deal is shitty. Period. That's not PvP that's just shitty human behavior.
---
Not currently because I’m too generous with them, but will look this thread up if it comes into my possession again.
---
Still don’t show it for me.
---
Oh I'm EST, I'm scheduled another 2 and a half hours
---
BR/NW S.P.E.C.I.A.L. &amp; EXP ASAP BGS!!!!!! I AM CEREAL
---
they will never fix the interface. think about that.
---
Thomas the Tank Engine? Really???...
---
I'll have you know, my deathclaws are Macho Man Randy Savage.
---
Thomas the tank engine... HA
---
how do u access them tho? do you go into the atomic shop and open them or do you have to enter adventure mode?
---
Did you mess with Demo expert or have any mutations active?
---
How about solo and team specific games?
---
I have one spawn near my base every so often
---
Yes, the lower the DR the higher the damage.
---
And is being 'coded' in a really unforgiving manner.
---
Something as irrelevant as 2DR has already taken a substantial chunk off the buff, hence cosmetics suddenly having 1DR in the previous patch being an issue.
---
Hahaha good point. Halo was originally gonna be an RPG. Fallout was previously only a RPG. I'm sure there are plenty of others.
---
Makes sense to me!
---
Remember back when our stash box could only hold 3 or 400?
---
That was painful
---
honestly, i think it would still make sense to only change the baddies and the flora in the actual nuke zone.  and just have a harsh environment, but no real extra rewards in the outer ring
---
Same, having issues.  Gotta get rid of this wanted bounty!
---
I can try my best, what is your question?
---
It just gets to a point and I’m just thinking why? Why do these people have to hate so hard... at the end of the day I don’t give 2 shits, I will still be playing the game enjoying myself.
---
what a legend
---
Hey, I’ll give you 1,750 caps for that Berserker’s Dragon if it’s max level and if you don’t want it
---
You need Overseer ranks to see shit though.  
---
Would be pretty pointless. If you want to explore, play the mode.
---
I have my mic on most games, but my voice is a problem for some people, so in some games I keep it off
---
Even in the beginning I had fun the game had some errors around itself and some features weren't there yet but the bugs weren't that bad, then it went worse and then a lot better and then even more better.... and we came out stronger
---
Where’s your camp if you don’t mind me asking?
---
Or when bobby pins weighed so much...
---
Toats agree. Make it so you have to opt out to leave the cycle.
---
GTA does this and it helps keep the population high
---
Yes I was very confused the first time I played. Me and another guy were talking over the headset not knowing what to do after the team died. The other two players were gone. We didn't know if quit is really what we wanted. We didn't want to quit the game. Just start another round. We were very confused.
---
You're not a terrible person, after all, its called survival for a reason
---
Well, to be fair, up until 76, there was no PvP.
---
Be 1am for me. Might be shit out of luck for tonight. Add me anyway when you get in, then when our paths cross, I’ll trade that jacket for a shit load of drugs.
---
what platform do you play on? i just bought it on sale and haven’t started yet and i could use a guide!
---
Problem with mmo is even if they have a team of 200 testing it  it doesn't prepare them for the thousand of player's and glitches after launch. Hot fixing and patches seem fairly common on online only games.
---
Perks and legendary stats
---
It really depends on the weapon and the legendary effect(s). For second tier weapons with less desirable effects, its only worth what someone is willing to spend in order to exchange it for script. 
---
Most desirable effects (no particular order) are bloodied, explosive, anti-armor, two-shot, junkies, swing speed, instigating. 
---
If it doesn't have one or more of those, you aren't going to get too much for it. Also things like a grognaks axe or deathclaw gauntlet will get more than a combat knife or walking cane.
---
Best way to get some idea of demand is to look through one of the marketplace subs.
---
Do the damage values on the on the other weapons revert to 'normal' when you equip them?
---
Do you use Adrenaline? Sometimes the buff text/values does not clear from the UI but this is just a UI glitch.
---
Yeah without dupers the game and legendary drops are quite balanced, nobody can easily dominate any component of the game if he/she plays honestly.
---
I'm surprised that every person you ran in to wanted to kill you. And I say that because...well...most people on adventure mode are kind and usually want to help lower lvl folks.
---
Sorry to hear your experience hasn't been the greatest.
---
Wow thanks for the silver!!
---
Do they resets every Monday
---
&gt; why can't we have it so whoever has the better equipment and more experience wins like every other game
---
Umm that's exactly how it works and why you lost.
---
Doesn't matter if you're wearing PA if enemy has anti-armor weapon and perks, they just slice right through you like a hot knife through butter.
---
idk man paper bag is a staple for fo76. i will never see a paper bag the same way again
---
Never use mutations and never had demo expert
---
What's fallout?
---
Same here. Im trying it and im definitely going to be buying it on payday. Also buying my girlfriend a copy too her brother is also purchasing it Friday.   Were all 3 very pleased with what weve experienced.
---
It's not fair lol. Survival is incredibly unbalanced.
---
It's a cool idea but I honestly don't think the game could handle it
---
Wrong reddit
---
yes - never had the nerve to try that one. LOL
---
 Yes, if you were banned they won't respond.
---
In fairness I’ve only ran into a few equally low level characters, yet to actually run into a higher level character, my mind is still wide open for the game at the moment though
---
Don’t feel bad, the one time I encountered one I was VERY low heath, overweight, and without P/A. needless to say, after a whopping 5 minutes of combat it tore me a new one and i’ve never seen one since.
---
Seeing Power armor is like seeing a metal pinata. In this version it is only useful for rad protection. So far. There are no legendary power armors.  Get a good set of real armor.
---
Lever action or hunting rifle with .50 reciver
---
PS4, I'm currently offline right now but we will be back up in about 6 hours. If you're on PS4 feel free to add me @ Gunman40610
---
Maybe. Granted I don’t know how this is coded in games but I’m thinking of it in terms of other things I’ve built. To me I think of this as, ok, iron scrap. This is an object asset in the game. It gets an ID in the database that references it’s properties and assets that get exported to the client side and all of it is static. Then there’s the variable of quantity and that is controlled or rather generated on the client side and fed to the database for that users saved data package. That users quantity of iron scrap is expressed as an integer value. Each multiple of 10 essentially adds an additional numbers place. The data weight of 5 versus 7 is the same. The data weight of 7 versus 12 is different because you’re now tracking two number places. The weight increase is minuscule but adds up across all users data packages. 
---
I mean, now that I think about it, the most likely reason for the cap isn’t storage but probably that they don’t want you to be set for life with resources. By limiting your stash they’re creating artificially low supply to increase demand and keep you scavenging and engaged with game in they way they want people to engage with it.
---
Legendary items that don't appear useful I start off selling for 20 caps per scrip, which I'll reduce to 15 per when my stash starts to get full. If I need space I tend to discount heavier items first.
---
At heart. We are al raiders now.
---
why hell yeah! into the wasteland, brother!
---
Heyo! New nuke dropper here! Where on Whitesprings should I be dropping it?
---
Eh... honestly, I was dominating PvE pretty easily with a 1 star bloodied .50 cal, and I've found 8 of those legitimately. Takes a little longer to kill SBQ with that than my B2525 .50 cal, but still very good.
---
PvP is a different story though.
---
Molotov cocktails. Took out a full squad while they were looting in a shed near Flatwoods with one throw.
---
Did you choose the new nuclear winter mode or Survival Mode?
---
People will be trying to kill you in those modes, less so in Adventure.
---
I've never dealt with serious issues with the game. I got the occasional freezing or quitting of the game. People love to find things to complain about. And since fallout 76 was a new spin in fallout, everyone wanted to poop on it. I've seen so many people complain about the game but then continue on and give it a chance then play it all the time.
---
for sure.
---
Most of the people in my tour level up so quick because I go over the VATS system and critical hits. This requires a good bit of fighting so the experience come mainly from that.
---
Nopepidy nopedity, noope!
---
Advantage is with teams. Just hope for a good one.
---
Shooting the 3 animals with the syringer several times didn’t check off the list for me.  And the plasma grenade plan appears to be the most rare plan in the entire game because no one has it.
---
super fun dealing damage that doesnt actually do anything to my opponent's health
---
super fun fumbling over this spastic hotwheel that they have no intention of fixing
---
super fucking fun that the entire drop sequence is just a map menu
---
what's most fun is how bethesda keeps pushing competition in a game that doesnt exceed 25 fps
---
does anyone even know what the server tick rate is
---
I think the Vault hadn’t opened yet in Adventure mode, Nuclear Winter is basically the aftermath of Fallout 76’s story.
---
Lever action or handmade for sure. Probably some of the more popular and sought after guns in the game
---
West of the Gilman Lumber company. There's a telephone pole on the north side of the street. Follow it straight up. Body is in branches beneath a big tree. YouTube: https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=vault+51+overseer+body&amp;view=detail&amp;mid=C97976D13392E0F5AEC8C97976D13392E0F5AEC8&amp;FORM=VIRE
---
Oof that's a nice card card I want it now LOL
---
When people do something like this…it disappoints me. Someone makes a long spill and some very good points and you just HAVE to find something in there to disagree with. It’s never I concede on that, this we can disagree on, but this here’s my opposing view. It’s never a discussion it’s always this bull. If said team wasn’t making NW, They’d be making more mat for Adventure or doing bug fixes wouldn’t they. You think they had a team on standby all this time who only specialize in BR development?
---
 They are prioritizing things to make themselves A. Popular B. Money. Fine, you’re a company, get it. But, it becomes disappointing when the bugs aren’t fixed and it’s new content after content and day 1 issues are still there staring you in the face. Not, just little shit. Like game-breaking stuff. The chief criticism of the game by the majority.
---
I mean the percentage of people asking for NPCs versus the amount of people not wanting them is much higher and also adding NPCs just makes for more interest tbh, it’s a new quest line that takes  place in the future and what better way to convey that progression than adding something significant like NPCs?
---
Fortnite and PUBG both award kills based on who actually gets the kill, not who downs the person. That was why I could never complete certain challenges.
---
Nope not yet
---
Thats my problem with every BR ever.
---
They were not careful with their caps, all was lost with the addiction to Wine and Chemicals
---
I'm somewhat positive I ran into one of your trainees last night. He had the armor and weapons that you mentioned you gave out. I proceeded to help him with CAMPs, work shops, and got him some action at Grafton Steel. He was really excited to have such high levels helping him out and wants to play with me regularly now haha
---
Sadly there is no cross platform, and no word if they plan to add it down the road. I’m guessing they won’t.
---
I am online if you still need to do the challenge.
---
I love your name... I floop the pig
---
Sorry I meant it as a response to the person you replied to.
---
Yeah, I wonder why they don't go to survival, and why they are so scared that even call some friends to come join them in case the victim would be able to fight back.
---
they are such a non issue that no one cares anymore.
---
Care to enlighten me?
---
It’s been data mined so it’s coming.. but it will be an atomic shop skin and it’s not out yet
---
In Fallout 4 I use a mod, what changes the PA's behavior into more realistic.
---
all PA parts have a higher durability (except chest piece, it has a bit less) and you will not take any dmg, radiation as well as from NPCs, as far as pieces are intact.
---
As soon as 1 piece brakes, for example right leg, you will take general radiation dmg and dmg from NPCs at this body part.
---
Would love to see this feature in FO76 because it would give new views on how to play the game.
---
You couldn't wear your PA 24/7 and need to watch out about your PA's parts. Repair packs for PA's could reach a important role.
---
Nah bro, taking it slow is a great way to enjoy the game. I took my sweet time doing stuff and now I'm still enjoying it with 300+ hours played.
---
Keep playing man. I personally love this game, despite its faults. I've been playing since day 1 BETA and even though it can be grindy I've met a lot of good people on this game and have had a ton of fun with it.
---
You would be right :D
---
There is this mod I love in FO4:
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/35061?tab=images
---
Is pure gold but my rig, which is pretty decent, at times buckles under the pressure and this in single player offline.
---
I shudder to think what it would do to FO76.
---
If one doesn't exist we can start one. I'm 15 now but I've seen one or two 25+ folks that could help us out.
---
Here's what I can remember getting...
---
-12 is a .44 skin
---
-13 is a 10mm pistol skin
---
-14 is a stash box skin
---
-15 is the blue x-01 skin
---
So the barrel would be a skin?
---
I hate Fortnite, PUBG, Apex Legends, Blackout, H1Z1, and every other BR game out there because BR games suck.
---
Nuclear Winter I like, however, and Nuclear Winter alone.
---
If you need more clarification than that, then oh well.
---
Ah. That makes sense. I was curious if they downed count would count each or the point would be move to kills instead.
---
Here's the thing, survival is a test of who has managed to secure a great combination of  armor pieces, high damage weapons, perk selection, and advantageous mutations. Throw in armor piercing, high explosive ammo and it's a completely different game from adventure mode. Power armor is more useful with scorchbeasts and higher level animals/mutants. There are armor combinations that almost completely negate your opponent's damage, so never expect to stay on top in Survival, some bugger is out there just waiting..
---
I mean im still going to play the battle royale whether or not it gives good rewards
---
Its just plain fun
---
The mode everyone wanted is being meme'd to fuck on Twitch TV, it's going to be up there for the free week and instantly drop back down to nonexistence.
---
From the pictures I saw I would say yes a skin
---
It’s a team death match. If you don’t select the option to auto fill or join team on menu. You play solo
---
Walked right into that Mirelurk queen nest. Same as us, and that robot over there.
---
I don't think abandoned, or at least I hope not. Pretty sure i heard it got pushed back?   I'll be excited for it. I hoarded a lot of Nuka Colas to put up on a shelf and such. :(  
---
My one hope for this update is that the items are not lootable/steal-able by other players. I worry people would use that to force themselves to be wanted and try to force PVP. Could be wrong, but I'm a little paranoid I guess.
---
Yeah, there would definately be some caveats to making it work. But one can dream =)
---
Depends on what they are but they all just function like any othe Atomic Shop item. Camp stuff is in the build menu, skins are applied through workbenches, icons selected in the shop.
---
Yes thats true... but its fundament they build this game on the idea of no NPCs and now after a year they want to boost some figures they just throw it in anyway... its just principals....
---
NW is not solo. You *can* queue solo.
---
So selecting auto fill off still puts you again groups of 4? No true solo mode??
---
I am on PC as well. ign is newt341 if you want to join up for a silo run.
---
Oh yes I was talking about those who one-shot all the ghouls others have spawned with their duped eBay guns. The bosses such as SBQ and ISS are still good challenges even with massive amount of duped weapons out there.
---
They revert back when I equip them instead, yes. Never used Adrenaline.
---
I think this is what they're going to end up doing too. 
---
Though I could them doing set maps just to avoid some areas that aren't traversable. For example, the mountains on the west of Top of the World, and the cliffside to the west of the temple. It would suck to get caught on the wrong side of those.
---
Yeah same, in Europe the time is 18:00 (6pm) when new items go in sale.
---
The fact it only benefits my adventure character is fantastic. I love the IP, and spent my fair share of time on fortnite and pubg. BR on a fallout mode is great.
---
I wish there were more AI creatures.
---
I love the SB at the end.
---
One other silenced weapon would be sweet. Really a few more weapon configs would be nice really.
---
I’m on PC, if you know any players that are willing to help out then let me know!
---
Beware the Samsquanch.
---
I’m not new by any means but Im still low level. I always appreciate the other folks helping me out! I hope to one day do the Same.
---
It happens, they're not very bright ;)
---
Yep learnt the hard way after spending hours looking for a set of t60 and being shot in back by my lvl 15 friend for my bounty. I just try to stick to marine armour unless I need the excavators carry weight.
---
It happens sometimes, not sure why.
---
So no true solo 52 against everyone solo??
---
Wasn't this patched before?
---
I’ve been on a team every time... didnt know the people but just stuck with basic team stuff. Stay close everyone watching everywhere etc. I can’t find how to go solo but don’t want to
---
I haven't experienced that. ( Though true it could be) I mostly just post here as "Casual" playtype and supportive of Bethesda/fo76. But I get a lot of downvotes for saying things like "I'd like a BR" or "This is nice for people who just enjoy playing the game"  I think maybe I attract more hardcore 76's or the group think downvoters. But that also happens to me in r/fallout so going back to my first comment, I feel they are pretty similar.
---
I just bought (with free atoms) the survivalist outfit for this very reason and I can't even wear it with the armour you find in NW. 800 atoms spaffed up the wall haha
---
I’ve been playing since the game came out and I’m level 14 😭 I’m serious I pre ordered it.
---
Just search twitch for Nuclear Winter, plenty of streamers playing it.
---
North of sunnytop station. There is a lead node where my base is at. And I have had him spawn 4 times so far. He will be barely south of the lead node.
---
Sure makes the event easier!
---
It's possible, but yeah go ahead and send me one, I'd be down to play later. Looks like I may already have a tour in queue as well so it's going to be a busy night.
---
No solo mode that just means you want to play in a 1 man squad
---
You haven't unlocked anything. They're a skin that changes the appearance of your camp stash in the adventure mode of the game, completely cosmetic. They have nothing in them, they're not loot crates.
---
People like that enjoy being assholes. It's got nothing to do with the game and everything to do with their personality. Chances are they are equally shitty people outside of FO76
---
Wow ok I’ll delete this no actual solo mode where everyone against everyone that’s dumb as hell
---
It makes me think you're wearing a baby yao guai skull due to the site comparison, you monster!
---
Im glad im not the only one not wanting NPC's. Ive grown accustomed to the isolation, and creating my own story. Im not outright against NPC's though. Ill be fine with it ad long as its implemented well. I just dont want another Preston Garvey i have to avoid like the plague. Fuck that guy.
---
Awesome man! What console do you play on?
---
So you need a splitter, it's a female that splits to two males.  That way you can plug both of the males into the headphone and mic input and you can talk and hear
---
Thanks!! I know the lead node you speak of. I’ll check it out from time to time
---
oh i should’ve thought of that, i don’t use twitch very often
---
That's almost definitely happening. I think it's only because it's an early look we don't have more.
---
I mean i played it. It's cool but I won't be playing it often, I'll pass on BR.
---
Does the search function here work, though?
---
If I'm not mistaken it updated yesterday shortly after the Nuclear Winter update, didn't it? I grabbed their new atoms purchase bundle ($10 package gets you 1500 atoms, Elder Maxson's coat from FO4, and some repair kits).   They also added some new posters, Mr. Pebbles decorations, brought back the Nuka Girl costume, and added a lot of new other stuff.
---
Currently my shop shows all of the above, and the only timers are for some generator skins (18 hours) and the Vault Tec bundles (4 days).  So maybe something new (or at least a new sale) in approx. 18 hours.
---
No prob!
---
Yeah that would be perfect because it makes it a valuable item and force to be reckoned with and not just make you punching bag
---
With the weapon weight gear and armored backpack,  I now have more carry weight out of armor than in.
---
Don’t worry, it was a “stunted” one!
---
I agree the wait time is far too long in lobbies for BR
---
This. I'm just shy of 800 hours in and I'm still exploring, find new plans, and building camps. Take it slow and read everything!
---
Yeah, let's just let the way countries were founded continue to be and keep all slavery. It's just principals.
---
I get that this is a game but it's the same logic.
---
What timing, I just got home.
---
23 is a little low to be in the Mire area, especially if there were higher levels there recently. Maybe grind out some levels in Savage Divide and come back? Lots of enemy camps near Top of the World.
---
Clown hat, bathrobe, and a shotgun blast to the face generally does the trick.
---
I jumped the gun and hated it immediately. Played it once and love it. Shame on me. I’ve been reeled back into this game now and I’m so glad.
---
Oh no, I can solo the silo, that's nothin much. It's the actual queen and her ridiculous high HP I need help with to comfortably take down.
---
That's not the games fault. You're lower lvl and stingwings aren't exactly the easiest enemies at such low levels. Give it time lol
---
Sadly no. It’s only team death match.
---
I can see where the no NPC crowd is coming from, and I admit I was a little confused because of how adamant they were about "no NPCs in 76" and all that. But, I do think it's kind of cool in how adding them now is sort of progressing the story of the world itself, and that survivors are coming back and all that.
---
"I just don't get why everyone is unhappy with me blowing dudes to make fat stacks of short term cash. Why can't the haters just be happy I'm trading my identity and self-respect for making rent?"
---
If it's a choice of the *Fallout Franchise* becoming the new home of BR for the next six or seven years or pulling the plug and pooling 76's resources back into Star Field and Elder Scrolls so they can actually meet expectations as *the* next generation open-world RPG and not be a joke as well?   I'd pick the latter ten times out of ten.
---
Sometimes they're not in a generator but close by.
---
Right you are sir, I deployed right at the outermost sothern part of the map and got an automatic handmade
---
&gt; Not true most bad reviews were about no npcs and a mmo that allows griefing.
---
Which is being addressed, like I said.
---
I want to love this game, but the technical issues are as bad as they are made out to be. This game crashes and has server disconnects more often than Fallout 4 ever did. Yesterday I teamed up with some random people I met and we played for 10 hours and got to level 10 together, even tried Nuclear Winter for a few rounds before I called it quits at 2am. It was fun, we did the Overseer's Quests to Grafton, helping eachother out with ammo, aid, and crafting.  
---
Today I'm level 12 and spent the last 2 hours taking over the Grafton Steel Mill #TWICE and both times I've taken it over from the super mutants, built up crafting station, defenses, and walls, then I've had to defend it from waves. The first time I got through the first defense fine, just feral ghouls. Second defense was 4 waves of mirelurks, on the second wave my fps suddenly tanked from 60 to 20, and after I repaired my hunting rifle real quick I spontaneously combusted from a molotave I did not press the key for and died. Travel back to the mill; infinite load screen, Takes 4 seconds on my SSD normally, waited 10 before I had to force-close the game. Lost all my work. Thankfully I had stashed everthing.  
---
Try again after restarting the game. First wave as soon as I take over is Anglers. Take them out with a bit of difficulty, only one death, and respawn just fine. Repair everything; lose connection to server. Fuck this Bethesda. A year later and you still expect people to pay for the game in this state???
---
Thank you for offering to assist. Sorry I missed your post.
---
Yea that’s dumb as hell lol. Oh well guess rolling with auto fill on now
---
Correct.
---
I’m just pissed off cause I got all the other insect parts.
---
A lemming Easter egg? :P
---
Ah okay. Yeah, understandable. Wait until this nuclear winter trial is over and it should be all back to normal. I’ve just been working on completing other events and earning atoms.
---
r/fallout tends to be NV criclejerkers and those who hate Bethesda, while this sub is nice
---
If junk was weightless, since launch, then every single player would have a few hundred thousand bulk. Then one day someone would decide that it was needless having SO much stuff and would drop a paper bag easily tripling the number of things on the server ( as when it left your stash it would now need to be tracked by the server) so you could instantly crash any server you were on.
---
i do think the stash should see incremental increases so that as new outfits, items etc from DLC are found and stored a player does not feel limited by the stash limit. However one of the things bethesda clearly did not put enough thought into was,
---
"ok so we have trained, for years, every single person that is likely to pick this game up to stockpile EVERYTHING! and to love to display the interesting junk they find in the world...so we will restrict or remove that ability, i am sure they will be fine with that"
---
Junk displays will come, stash increases will come but in game design, choices are made some for gameplay reasons and some for practical reasons. Judging by a lot of the comments i have seen on game related message boards the vast majority of people never take one second to step back and think "why did they do it this way" instead of "it should be this way". I have read many very good suggestions, it is annoying to read the same suggestions over and over when there is a perfectly obvious, reason why something is the way it is.
---
Some people want to watch the world burn
---
They should make it easier/clearer to see what you've earned.
---
Take everything off - crikey that reads creepy - and equip the weapon.
---
Does the damage on your other weapons change?
---
I always have so much .38 ammo and nothing to do with it so I give hundreds of it to noobs
---
Well you can also get them other places where they might spawn at lower levels. Beckwith Farm (just NE of the Whitespring) can spawn stingwings, and probably just a little lower level than Treetops.
---
They built this game on the idea of a story. If you play the main quest it should be obvious that the arrival of NPCs is part of that story. That was Act 1, Wastelanders is Act 2. 
---
They were planned from the start, they are not just bending to the players' requests. So they are following the principles on which the game was founded.
---
How is someone already Overseer Rank 86?
---
The game should make it clearer for new players, but if you take a workshop, you are opting-in to PvP against any and all comers. You could equally well ask why a level 8 player would post a "come at me bro" flag to the whole server.  In any case, deaths hardly mater.
---
LEAVE WASTELAND SCUM
---
Yeah but I was expecting people my level at least. And also he didn’t even claim it. it’s still mine he legit came in, contested it destroyed my generators then left.
---
Na, not at the games actual way.
---
You will still die in seconds.
---
With all that armor piercing and op dmg your PA parts will be broken in moments.
---
The difference would be just a few seconds and also, you would need to repair it before using again.
---
This sort of PA, wouldn't be for PvP.
---
Not what I was asking.  When you buy under armor in the atom shop, you can't use it in NW which is silly since outer apparel does work.
---
Yes like I said I feel betrayed.... but I am excited
---
Except Bloodied feels like the right damage profile for killing and being killed, the game should just play at the equivalent of 30-40% by default. (with no legendary equipment)
---
You've just met some cowards that are too scared to join a survival server.
---
I was never under the impression that there would be no human NPC’s ever. Really, the world has to evolve, the idea that everybody is dead and no one ever passes through was only going to last so long.
---
You're taking it too seriously. If you don't like it then stop playing when the update comes out.
---
This was the plan all along.
---
We are the first to emerge from the vaults. 
---
No npcs.
---
We kill the SBQ, stop the super mutant factory, kill scorched, mole miners and deathclaws.
---
We made the wasteland livable again.
---
Now, communities across america/Virginia have seen that we are defending our home and are moving in.
---
Communities and towns will be built.
---
To me, that was the plan. It just looks too developed to have been a player concession and just throwing it in to make people happy.
---
We've met the faction leaders, worked with the scouts, cleaned up the wasteland... It wouldn't make sense for no one in the country or other vaults to come someplace safe/safer/safe-ish.
---
Either they reworked a LOT of combat mechanics with this patch, or the visual damage is bugged to fuck. A lot of this was tested before between players to get real HP value numbers, and in some cases supported by dataminers. I and another person both independently tested Furious effects months ago and came up a max damage value of 60-70% more true HP damage at around 10 shots in. This roughly lines up with a ~50% weapon damage increase due to the armor piercing effect of doing more damage, and data miners supported this.
---
If these numbers you now see are true, then they reworked a ton of combat mechanics behind the scenes. This needs some real testing in controlled PVP to see if the shown numbers actually line up with the HP damage.
---
Just the plans to craft the basic pieces for the possum badge.
---
There's DLC. Go to a train station and read all three posters to get them started. There's also two new game modes to try.
---
Yes we all knew that..  but this game was created, based on no npcs... so I feel like they shouldn't have done it... will be fun though
---
As soon as you take a workshop, you open yourself up to PVP, unfortunately that's just how the game works. I'd definitely suggest levelling up before taking a high profile workshop like the power station though 👍🏻
---
That was no normal machete. 'Twas a blade sent from the gods, forged in blood-magma with the express purpose of slaughtering your foes!
---
Agrees.
---
Oh for sure, bugs were always going to happen as they do in every game and especially as its a Bethesda game, people expected them. But the state this game released in was so far beyond any of that, they stripped Fallout of almost everything that made it Fallout. Like I said, I hope it gets better.
---
I thought it’d be people my level with crappy pipe weapons and leather armour. Not players in XO1 power armour and one shot weapons.
---
Heck yeah, I lived in the ash heap for my first 2 months on the game.
---
That's what can happen when you take a workshop.
---
It's like a laser shotgun?
---
Do NW
---
War...war never changes
---
What are some rewards you got from Overseer Ranks 10-20?
---
I noticed the stuff added yesterday, but I would of assumed they would have the next PA skin out today noticing it’s 1 per day. Gonna guess they’re just gonna take Monday’s update as being a Tuesday update instead lol.
---
Apparently so
---
Oh c'mon man
---
For me limiting things makes a lot pointless. "Oh there's some wood, no need to get it because I have no where to put it, oh there's some steel, no need to get that either, oh there's some material I actually want but I have about 100 of it and stash is full."
---
Out of shotguns, semi, and auto which of these 3 are good to start as and can go all the way to the toughest enemies. Essentially a smooth start to finish
---
Yay!  I only hope BSG has booked more servers for the increased population they've gotten.
---
Yeah I didn’t really think it was high profile more just people my level.
---
I keep giving them Nukashine. They love the blackouts it gives them. 
---
Managed to Nuka 1 guy to Fissure Site Prime he run like fuck.
---
I’ve seen the crit/gunfu/adrenaline auto builds do really well, but the build seems inefficient. Fun, but not worth it point by point. It’s also a play style I’m not really fond of. Also, you eat 10mm like my fat ass eats pie.
---
Yes I can one shot a max level ghoul with many of the weapons I use. But before the TSE nerf you can one-shot an entire crowd of ghouls with a single shot from an explosive shotgun. If the powerful legendaries are as rare as they should be, it's not a big deal. When everyone gets a duped one, Bethesda had to come out and nerf them.
---
I disagree with the fact that you said they build the game on this cause they didn't todd literally said... "this game will have no NPCs" I just feel betrayed is all
---
Assume he has 3 buddies first, and act accordingly.
---
I haven’t seen any bugs in game as of yet and I’m not sure this is a Bethesda issue, but my husband downloaded the update on PS4 last night and played the game for a couple hours. He booted up the game this afternoon to find that he has to download and install the entire patch all over again. He tried canceling the update and starting the game, but it didn’t register that it had been updated. I did not have this issue on my own PS4. I installed yesterday and was able to hop right in this afternoon.
---
4,294,967,295
---
Largest value for an "all positive" unsigned integer and like hell anyone will hit that value.
---
It’s really hard to read terminals and listen to Holo tapes while some rando is punching you nonstop.
---
Imagine they see this comment and change it to nylon west tec bags
---
UPVOTE THIS MAN
---
Thanks! I was unsure whether or not there was because all of the posts saying there wasn't were from a year ago.
---
I feel like I found a lot of shotguns and hunting rifle (non-auto) early on. And you can use those all the way. With new guns of course because you’ll want higher level weapons. This is just my experience.
---
Most PVP attackers are level 50+, and after level 50 gear maters more than levels.
---
But Todd said "this game will have no npcs" I just feel betrayed.... I am excited however
---
You mean the slot machine looking thing? Yeha it's only supposed to buy your legendarys in exchange for scrip
---
I believe the bronze little vault boy statue was rank 12. If I’m not mistaken I have the small stash and the medium stash, both somewhere between 10-20. The rest has been player icons and gun skins. The skins are the “atomic shop” datamined skins like the hot rod paint and the blue camo paints.
---
I'm doing this on PS4! Have a lot of good low level melee weapons. Great for leveling, no ammo needed! Come on down to the corn fields of Wixon Homestead.
---
IGN: OddFraud
---
Just suppress legendary effects and mutations in survival. It would make it a true survival mode in which there are no crazy effects that let you OHK everything as an example.
---
I don't feel the need to get punished for playing for a longer time than newer players.
---
There's only one legendary vendor. She's at Berkeley station and all the items are listed under the inventory tab and not the others.
---
Much of it was related to performance issues all across the game including crafting menus, shooting automatic weapons, high dense areas.  Broken/wonky quest lines from time to time and you could feel the server chugging after hours in which caused its own set of issues.  Overall it was still really fun with friends (but frustrating) and now its much more stable. 
---
Overall I think most of us that stuck with it were just so happy to finally be able to play a bethesda game (bugs and all) with family/friends.
---
There's only one legendary vendor..
---
Lol I got downvoted. Pfft wth?
---
Yeah. That was the most pathetic excuse for trolling I've ever heard. They had no idea how to from the sound of it. You handled it perfectly. 
---
Closest I had recently was I did the weekly challenge to take the Poseidon workshop. I knew it was going to be bait taking a specific one so I wasn't going to even stick around for the 1st defend event. Sure enough after I left, I checked the map and there was 2 players waiting in the hills. The fact that one was a low level and the other a high level was proof enough to me that they were going to try and grief.
---
Not much in the way of anger, except for possibly at myself for falling for Bethesda's new normal. I was happy I waited to buy fallout 4 for the game of the year edition. The game was great as a finished product. After years of being let down by incomplete single player bethesda games, this one would have to be different since its multiplayer. It wasn't. Now I am back to being a reluctant fan of their games, but hating how they market them.
---
I get you. Yeah, I had assumed thats what they were doing since so much got changed around yesterday.
---
One of us, one of us...
---
Seriously though, it's quite fun.
---
I assume your talking about the machines those are only for turning in legendary items. To buy them you need to go to the train station by harpers ferry to talk to the mole miner to purchase using script.
---
So far, that is my favorite part!
---
Indeed.
---
This is super generous of you! I’m also giving this free trial weekend a try, almost finished downloading (darn internet), and I can’t wait to explore the wasteland!
---
&gt; Its all just variable number right? 
---
It SHOULD be, but it's probably not because Bethesda seems to like to do things weird and often wrong. Like "staple" items (say broken down junk and ammo and such) should be just a table of item - count. That's like 2 values, a lookup number for the item (like say wood is, steel 2, aluminum 3, etc), and an amount number.
---
Probably because this is a "only positive posts, no criticism" subreddit and anyone who goes against that is down voted into oblivion.
---
Like they did about the battle Royale mode everyone hates?
---
My husband is having this issue on PS4 except it’s not resolving itself. The game doesn’t register it was updated at all. He played after the update  yesterday without any issue. I was able to hop right in the game today on my PS4 without any issue.
---
But then again it is bethesda and in Fo4 after 200+ years things still haven't really gotten along ( tech wise) so again I just feel betrayed... its a logic step for them to progress the story I get that
---
You're very welcome :)
---
It's the only thing I'm still a bit salty about.
---
I’ve already done the other scouting mission you get btw.
---
I’m wondering where the updated atom store post is that’s usually updated each week to show the new items and sales. Don’t think it’s out yet.
---
Loved reading this, just a heads up you can press ‘X’ from the “Join Queue” window to turn off team based matchmaking on Xbox and Square on PS4.
---
Not sure what it is on PC
---
Is the broadsider usable now? I've scriped quite a few just yesterday 😭
---
Sharing and sharing :)
---
Impulse.
---
Hate to break it to you but there's a terminal locked to overseer level 105, haha.
---
Not everyone sticks around for the match to be over. The majority are long gone before it’s done. I’m assuming part of the fun is being able to join games fast and get them going fast.
---
No I’ve seen that with a lot of people not just here some on the other Reddit too have been saying the same.
---
&gt; Then one day someone would decide that it was needless having SO much stuff and would drop a paper bag easily tripling the number of things on the server ( as when it left your stash it would now need to be tracked by the server) so you could instantly crash any server you were on.
---
Only if it was handled exceptionally poorly, so probably yeah it would.
---
It's a popular one for sure! Depending on the server you can keep it for hours without anyone batting an eyelid, collecting all of those lovely Fusion Cores, and other days there will be half a dozen players battling it out for the same little bit of Appalachia!
---
Hope you have some luck next time you go for it!
---
Gimme a pardon. I want to have a fresh start,
---
which probably ends up in killing others again.
---
Welp I got downvoted so never mind
---
You have too many friends (in a multiplayer game). That's your fault! /s
---
This happens to me too
---
Was down to last 4 last night ... me and a team of 3 ... SB comes out, hits me with the green cheerios and boom now everyone knows where I am.
---
Curious if you can hide from them in wood armor...
---
First you wait thru interminable loading to wait in a waiting area while random idiots pointlessly punch you, then more load screens then you finally deploy, grab a weapon then disconnect from the server.
---
Interesting thanks I'll grab one! For now my team needs to deal with my silence haha
---
Pardoned! Use it wisely, fella!

Weirdly enough it still does but in the opposite direction if I’m completely naked the damage goes up to 1118 on the dragon. I’m just going to assume that the damage I was doing before was a glitch and that the gun is working as intended. Just a weird UI bug when it comes to the other weapons.
---
I haven't seen it either. It's one of the ones I always look forward to, didn't need it this week since I was on after maint for once.
---
Ahhhhh lol okay. Yeah the actual machines. Those are for you to turn your legendaries into what's called legendary scrip. You use this currency to purchase items from the actual NPC vendor at Berkeley station
---
this is their chance to implement the canvas bags that they never delivered to the people who paid 300 bucks for the collectors editions
---
Thank you so much for helping me with that.
---
What are you saying? 308 is the easiest to find
---
Nah. Bags are better.
---
&gt;I'm not talking about deleting legendaries
---
did you read the post?
---
Yeah, they like 1,2 and nv...3 seems to go over there okay. 4 is fine unless you talk about the story line, settlements, or mostly anything not mod related.   But here I've encountered people using the word "community" when they mean their own niche oppinion, ie :Would work great for a level 200 melee build. Also people that attack because they think you are going to badmouth 76.  Then there are a lot of the people posting here trolling and badmouthing fallout 76 which is worse.  On 76 opinion pieces don't go over very well, but game play humour certainly gains traction easily.
---
The cool thing about it is that it's an optional mode, like Survival, so if it's not your thing it won't bother you while others who enjoy it can have a good time.  
---
The only thing that'd be nice would be if we were able to stay in the vault without the time limit. It's so detailed I want to wander around. We barely got to see functional vaults and it's interesting.  
---
Also, I SUCK at PvP, but I had a great time with Nuclear Winter, maybe it's because I'm procrastinating during the exams, but I had fun!
---
Not just damage buff they need to be way more durable, maybe last 10x longer, so that people will actually use them and buy the new skins.
---
As soon as I scrap a few more weapons tonight for a challenge (still haven’t scrapped 76 lasers) I’ll have enough atom saved for that vault boy PA head. Gonna put some red headlights on it and rock it with the blackbird X-01 and a flaming pitchfork.
---
Going to run around giving out cultist blades and glowing meat
---
No problem man. Always amusing doing that challenge.
---
To me, that was just to keep us unaware of future content.
---
Wastelanders has been on the roadmap we received back in February. They just didn't give info about it util now.
---
On the roadmap, it says "new features" which is what this would be. The image is also of a vault dweller and a non vault dweller (the non isn't wearing a vault jumpsuit.) Also shows a vault dweller standing next to a 3 legged robot.
---
Seems to me they've had hints right in front of our faces for months and no one caught on.
---
Start sticking points into strength and luck.
---
That might be it, anyway good luck with your new setup! :D
---
I happened to have the bommber jacket and helmet by accidental atom shop buy. I figured dark brown is better than dark blue until I can get some armor on makes me a little less conspicuous.
---
Do the event reach and clear - you will make easy 20-30 black titanium ore from that
---
I totally agree! I guess I didn't give my post a good Reddit title:
---

Heard
---
Nice
---
I really want them to do watoga. Constantly respawning bots giving your position away. Sentry bots mowing down mini camps. Building to building warfare
---
Nope, if you claim a workshop bored high level pvpers will kill you for lolz. That's what the warning before you claim them is for.
---
For me it's frustrating that it equips things randomly. I usually have melee in slot 1. Short range in 2. Sniper in 3.
---
I don't have time to organise it, so I'm just randomly changing weapons.
---
You should team up with the story teller
---
That would be another great thing
---
Lol I just wanna see whats inside the locked doors after that im good
---
I'm not sure what you mean by 'initial' special stats. Start with what you want, knowing that the final special stats are what you will want end up with. For example, you will want 15 strength. You could roll with shotguns or melee for a while. Even some weight reduction perks would be handy so you can carry the massive amount of loot you'll collect to sell/scrap--they will be useful for a long time, so it's not a poor investment. I wouldn't max out all of those perks (unless you want that as a secondary). Heavy weapons are a challenge to make viable early on, so an alternative would be helpful--even in a final build. Bloodied heavy weapons are a little hard to come by and most that you will want to buy will be max level, so you have a while to gather the appropriate perks. Bloodied melee weapons are much easier to obtain in comparison.
---
My perk path for a new character usually consists of damage then QoL, then damage again, then end build perks.
---
Screw the down voters. This is a good idea.
---
Down in Berkeley at the train station is the only one. She doesn’t sell anything. There is one menu where you can choose how many stars and what type of equipment you want to trade for. Then You get a random item based on your previous chosen criteria. ( ex. You want “2 star”  “armor” ) 
---
The machines at train stations take unwanted legendaries and give you the scrip to trade to her.
---
Yeah I’m a full melee build character in Adventure mode and the perks in NW are a joke for me tbh. Loving it none the less.
---
Todd said this on E3 last year so that was long before feb, I get your point but. Fundaments on which the game has been build are being changed...  but the truth is game was rigged from the start
---
I’m seriously considering moving camp close to flatwoods and filling my vending machines with low level armor and weapons for like 10-25 caps each
---
Yeah. If you could have a preset location for certain weapons and items, that would be cool too, as youd spend less time trying to worry about being spotted while organizing the favorite wheel
---
Who downvotes this??? People that WANT to wait??
---
FYI, tagging people in a text post doesn't do anything. You have to tag them in a comment (like /u/valseek, /u/ladydevann, etc) for them to get notified. And even then, you can't tag more than 3 in one comment, or none of them will get the notification.
---
give them .50 hunting rifles.  100 rounds per pop without any perks is plenty for such a low rof gun :)
---
&gt; I can see where the no NPC crowd is coming from
---
That crowd is infinitely smaller than the crowd asking for them though. The majority of Fallout fans wanted, and still want, Fallout 76 to be a proper Fallout RPG - not a Rust clone.
---
Dupers have destroyed the fun of FO76 in Adventure and Survival Beta. FO76 is pay to win (or grief) not because of BSG, but the Chinese legendary farms selling duped items for real $$ online or on ebay.  More than half the player base is running duped gear in Adventure and Survival which broke the game for honest players.  With this new mode, dupers are cut out and fun is restored to the game.
---
I really like legendary items in adventure mode though :P
---
Download the launcher, then click on Fallout 76. You'll see the free option.
---
There's a raider camp on the road between Charleston and the Whitespring that has low level stingwings.
---
Todd can say whatever he wants, but that's just not how things work. Developing stuff takes time and we know that Wastelander was a thing  ever since the roadmap got released, early this year.
---
They wouldn't have greenlit the announcement of A DLC as massive as Wastelanders without being sure that it'd work well, especially not after the disastorus start they got. The main questline is literally about solving the problem that caused the absolute absence of people, so how on planet earth can you logically conclude that one day Todd woke up and invented NPCs just to piss people off.
---
As I said, they messed up the marketing strategy, but the game is proceeding as planned. Wastelanders was going to include NPCs ever since before the game even got announced, I'm sure. This is not something you can just put together in a few months.
---
I'm sorry you drank Todd's sweet lies, but that's just how it is.
---
to be fair I made an alt character to play with a friend
---
It's Berkeley Springs, not Harpers Ferry fyi
---
signed
---
I would love nothing more than being able to use voice chat.. but no matter how I tweak the settings It just doesnt work..
---
I just try to stay close to my team and be alert.. its the best I can do rn
---
Good once you level up and make friends and get new weapons it’s so much fun
---
Have you downloaded the launcher? Do that, then install the game.
---
Lol, I would pay max caps for a legendary flair gun.
---
That already happens? I never noticed that lol
---
I love that it gives you caps for adventure mode. So good. Play Royale daily for about 10 matches. Love it. It can only get better.
---
And then NPCs etc in adventure mode. Gosh I hope they've got even juicier stuff after the next Adventure dlc.
---
Honestly, while I feel Apex Legends did lose popularity, its communication system was on point. They should implement a similar system.
---
It's even better when the physics goes wonky and they bounce all the way back up. Seen this once and was crying laughing.
---
Thanks! I don’t usually go to the mire cause I’m not even lvl 30 yet but basically I found a scout quest that tells you to go to 2 places and one was there so I just gave it a try.
---
Will probably just do one of my other quests - just done the Nukashine quest earlier, possibly one of my favourite quests so far in the game!
---
Not remotely the same logic. OP is saying that the creative vision for this game was to have every other person be an actual humanbeing. Adding NPCs, in his opinion, is a betrayal of that. Someone betraying their creative vision for sales is not comparable to slavery. Haha.
---
I use the Stalker outfit and I love it lol
---
You won’t find me moving from my place, I put way too much effort in to my current home build (even glitching the decontamination shower onto my second floor) to change it much now.
---
Oh I understand how not to get matched with people. I was asking for a “solo only” mode, essentially.
---
Sorry for the confusion.
---
Oh I'm not saying they would stop developing single player Fallout games, not at all, I'm talking about the future of 76.
---
If Nuclear Winter becomes the most popular thing about 76 then 76 will become all about Nuclear Winter the same way Fortnite Save The World is now an afterthought compared to Fortnite BR.
---
That's all I meant.
---
I agree. People, including myself lol, are raving about NW-rightfully so...it's been very well executed so far-but I agree they need to have separate teams to work on each mode so that one doesn't get neglected over the other.
---
I did never say todd created it you did... I just said that todd (ep of bethesda game studios) said it. He literally said it, and I just said I feel betrayed HOWEVER I am excited about this next fase... so I think you just misunderstanded me....
---
ahh ok, ive only played adventure mode so thats kinda cool
---
By what means is reconciliation given if not with words of praise for reconciling?
---
Oh yeah, for sure. I was personally pretty indifferent I think. But now that I think on it, I think the NPCs were some of my favorite things in 4 and probably NV now that I'm starting it. Suddenly, I miss Maccready...
---
Same goes for my wife. She’s dreadful with guns, but she plays and has a ton of fun anyway!
---
“it’s pop for people who don’t like pop, it’s rap for people who don’t like rap,”
---
You might want to let peiple know which platform you on
---
I understand what you're saying. The developers' creative vision was for every person you meet to be an actual humanbeing and backtracking on that simply to attract more sales is kinda ewwy. But you need to realise that games aren't like other forms of art; they're made specifically for consumption and for a playerbase to enjoy. Adding NPCs is part of that.
---
That’s my same issue
---
I have a WD Blue WD20EZRZ 2TB 5400RPM SATA 6Gb/s  
---
So yeah that might be it but this would be the first that has problems reading data not fast enough.
---
we’ll get npcs, new stories and tons of other stuff with the wastelanders dlc, and as far as i know that’s all for adventure. 
---
i do hope they dont spend *all* of their time on the new mode as well but some performance/stability improvements and new gear etc wouldnt hurt, it’s pretty fun once you’ve done everything there is to do in adventure
---
nothing.  grind caps, buy overpriced garbage, grind scrip for garbage, boggle at bugs, rinse and repeat.
---
Thanks, just edited the post.
---
I'm one the few that did not want BR and nor do I have any desire to even try it. But I'm not gonna talk shit about the game or the BR because.. I actually really enjoy fo76. Its not something I would have ever decided to add to the game. But, if it brings in new players so be it.
---
Shhhh.  Let them wear what they want... Bright high contrast colors are just fine. ;)  
---
\#donttaptheglass
---
I see where you’re coming from but I honestly believe that nuclear winter will be updated every other season or something like that. There isn’t much they can do for the game mode and if they wanted to add new weapons or armors that would also have to be implemented into adventure.
---
Yeah well they should take it out of survival mode
---
I had a 1\* Instigating Handmade outdamage my 3\* AAE Handmade after the third kill everytime with Adrenaline. AAE with 9/9 rifle perks and tank killer, covert ops 3/3 and it did about 300-400 dmg. My instigating handmade did 750 dmg a shot to the torso of Super Mutants instantly killing them. Real eye opener.
---
Lmfao
---
Give me the Cranberry Bog or give me death. Maybe each new season = new area of the map?
---
Yeah, great idea !
---
Helpful hint - when you're building in Workshop mode (not C.A.M.P), the materials in green are free. The ones in white are from your inventory.
---
Melee should always be included in your build. There is just no way around it, whether it's ghouls sprinting at you or rad scorpions popping up from the ground, combat is going to get close. 
---
But you don't have to focus on it. Shotgun, heavy weapons and melee perks are generally in strength, so if you want 2 or all 3 of them you'll need a lot of it. Rifles are in perception as well as automatic rifles, pistols are in agility. Now all these skills have regular, expert and master cards, collect all 3 cards before deciding to upgrade the cards, 3 cards at 1 point each gives you better stats than 1 card with 3 points in it.
---
I'd love to but I've never been able to hear anyone else.
---
Different headsets, different controllers, changed every possible setting multiple times. It is really a bummer that I can't get it to work. :(
---
I do that event everytime it pops up on the map but how do u get the keys to open the upper cages ?
---
It used to actually be viable before they nerfed the damage bonus to melee weapons from over repairing them with Weapon Artisian.  Had a double bar flamer that did 47/17 at a very rapid pace on only a level 20.
---
I would think chainsaws would be a heavy weapon though.  You hold it like one in the animations anyway.
---
Ripper needs some love too please.
---
the rewards are account based so it makes sense for the level to be account based too
---
And that is what I am saying they only threw it in because they need to boost some margins..... and because of that I am dissapointed.. and we haven't even started about the battle royale haha
---
im philis401 on pc and can hand some stuff depending...that is if I can fix my ctd/disconnect issues :u
---
They break crazy fast. I tested it a while back and even after the "buff", the laser rifle breaks more than twice as fast as a regular combat rifle.
---
Don't listen to other people,  especially on the internet
---
The new meta is blooded explosive _______.
---
One of my least fave things about battle royales is the same map shite... i really hope 76 does different and selects different zones for added fun
---
Rigged. Read planned.
---
the skins you unlock are considered atom shop items so you have them on all characters.
---
I had the battle royale stash box on my new character after unlocking on my main
---
I've been going around handing out ammo and lowbie shotguns/10mm pistols/hunting rifles too =D 
---
It's great fun. I don't use voice chat, so there's a lot of jumping and emote spam. xD
---
Hmm ill have to look into this when I get on later
---
I love NW but Bethesda wouldn’t abandon the story mode for NW. Its not like what Epic did with Fortnite.
---
I did! It was great fun!
---
I've never participated in anything streaming before. It was great. I've watched several of your recordings since then.
---
I get pretty annoyed when in the disc servers I frequent moan about it, when they haven't even played. Like.. give it a chance, or shut the hell up. Right?
---
Yeah I hope so = /
---
alrighty then, thanks!
---
Patience, my child... Patience.
---
nah im the kinda if dood that wants to stick out like a sore thumb. I was gonna run nw naked but if that makes it hard for peeps to see then ima have to change that.
---
Yea I think they last maybe 1/5 of a regular rifle. The 'buff' was probably for other energy weapons. My tesla rifle is very durable now, but laser is still made of cardboards.
---
As far as I see I don't see EVERYONE hating it. I see some love coming from it. I didn't want the battle royale, personally. But it's what every big name is doing and Bethesda is just late to the game. But they listened about the NPCs, and that's really what I care about. Yeah it wasn't a complete game at start, but it's turning into a good one. Like ESO did.
---
Literally the same as the full power armor skins in the atomic shop.
---
 No difference. No benefits. It's just cosmetic.
---
So "good" only means "do you like what it LOOKS like?"
---
I think it’s just because spray-and-pray works a bit better when everyone is used to vats. 
---
I can’t hit a damn thing with low fire rate weapons.
---
Long story extremely short, server stability.
---
Thought it was supposed to update a new free power armour paint job every day ?
---
I've seen this sentiment a lot since NW dropped. Hopefully the devs are taking notice and consider similar changes to survival as it's still in beta.
---
In general? No thanks. In fallout? It’s a blast.
---
Jesus.that means the hellfire skins are really far into the mode.
---
So there is a plus for my solo, anti-social behavior.
---
Hopefully if it gets traction they don't go nuts pouring all of their time into Nuclear Winter MTX. I'm just trying to think like these big companies think. I always get this picture in my head of executives around the table that are like, "Get them in this fun mode and make it really accessible to start, then over time we add more and more MTX  and money gates $$$ muhuhuhahaha".
---
Love it.
---
I have never played one in my life and it’s a blast. Short rounds great to mix it up then jump back into the story. I hope they add more mini games like capture the flag and stuff. It’s only on beta right now so I’m sure they will tweak stuff for the official release. I’m interested in the special perks and stuff and how those will pan out.
---
I enjoy it. I was not at all liking the idea of it before but after actually playing it I really enjoy it.
---
I've seen scorched vault dwellers around the map. Skin is all scorched and bald but wearing vault jumpsuits. All dead. Some were in roses room at the top of the world.
---
I'll buy treasure maps for anything less than 100 caps, but rarely see them for sale. I'd pay 125 for violet flux, but never see if for sale. I used up all my adhesive making armor for new players, and I'd pay 40 or so for it in bulk. I saw a torn mothman wing for 2000 caps, I passed at the time, but now I'd buy it.  I would pay 2500 for a deathclaw hide.
---
I'll buy any legendaries for less than 15 caps per scrip.
---
I sell stuff too. I heard that folks would buy ammo, so I've tried stocking it; fusion and plasma cores both move pretty well. I had a lot of 2mm, (at 1).45, and .5 mm, and it didn't move at all. I sell .556 and shotgun shells (at 1), and they move, but I just naturally collect it faster than I can sell it. 
---
I've priced super and regular stimpacks at less than I could sell them to a vendor, and they still didn't sell.
---
I've tried selling bulk, but to move it, I have to price it at about the vendor buy price. At the first sign of my stash filling up, this the first stuff to go to a vendor.
---
I thought I'd make a ton selling serums. I like selling them, because they're a lot of value for their weight, they sell kind of sluggishly (at 400).
---
I've made an excavator calibrated shocks, and a t51 jet pack (not the plan, the actual armor). I sold the leg for 800 and jet pack for 500, but only after a week of steadily reducing the price.
---
Absolutely. This is what I was expecting from he E3 preview.
---
Yea I think it’s kind of human nature, the more power the merrier. Good thing is they completely removed slap damage so you can pretty much play isolated and enjoy your own style.
---
I absolutely love it.
---
I really hope that's not it. I would gladly pay for a brand new story expansion  filled with NPCs if it was as long as a mainline fallout game, or heck if it was half as long as it and is 15-20 hours id take that.  
---
I feel like what we are getting is going to be great. But lets be real, its probably going to be only 3 hours of content.
---
Sorry must have dropped this: /s
---
Yeah we kept it for an obscene amount of time and I still have it, the guy never claimed it, but I’m not willing to place another 20 medium generators.
---
Lmfao I fucking knew they'd break it in exactly this way. I knew it. The second I read that "fix" I was like, "oh there goes vats"
---
I’m think the 30s. Maybe the first style is around 30 and then every interval of 30ish up to 100?
---
Purely speculation!
---
Yeah, most bloodies do carry rad meds, but unless they are paranoid, they probably won't have it on all the time, so rad damage, or executioners weapons are amazing antimeta.
---
Enjoy the game. Giving the game a fair shot is all we ever ask for. People may like the game, other people may not like the game. But they should decide for themselves, instead of spreading how bad the game is without actually trying it.
---
Toggle Teamfill to off
---
Oh damn thanks that’s really helpful. So when you take an area it just gives you free stuff for that area to build things?
---
And of course gunfu is level 50 card so it's difficult one to to level. 10 mm aren't as cheap as they should be either.
---
Pretty sure he doesn't want to play with a level 2. That wouldn't be enjoyable at all for either of you, I'm sure.
---
He was just being nice.
---
I've been playing since the very first minute of the very first beta and I am only level 55. Seeing level 300s out in the wild bewilders me.
---
I hope this is a nuke
---
I like that analogy but I also sometimes like when that happens. 
---
There's a place in town where I order a "black and blue" burger (blue cheese sauce plus a few other things) and maybe about a fifth of the time they forget the blue cheese sauce. I ask about it and they bring - if I had to take a guess - 4 times as much as what would have been on the burger. It's so much more delicious that way.
---
Always upper left am I right?
---
So actually winning gives you no special rewards? Also any advice? I suck at the battle royal type of game. Any advice is much appreciated
---
I personally don't enjoy it because I'm a filthy casual but I've played it and it works well :)
---
All the bits you need for the scout quest you can get in lower level areas, you don't have to follow the quest markers. Ticks are just south of Vault 76, bloodbugs and bloatflies at Aaronholt up north and radroaches are everywhere. You can do the whole backpack quest early but it's intended for higher levels so some of it will prove tricky.
---
Levels 1-5 if that helps
---
1 - Vault 51 Suit
---
2 - Vault 51 Player Icon
---
3 - Vault 51 Photo Frame
---
4 - Small Crate Player Icon
---
5 - Small Stash Box
---
Well yeah, but that only makes me solo. I don't wanna go up against 13 full teams as a measly one man. I spend most of my time building, not pvp'ing, so that's not the best choice.
---
Same happened to me
---
I'm lvl 100 and people still try to grief me, but I never take it off pacifist, so they waste their ammo and I laugh at them.
---
How do u make level 2 weapons and armor for lower levels I gave away what I had but I couldn't make a level 2 armor. I felt bad
---
Yah what's up with the boxing match in the lobby in vault 51, let play soccer. Lol. I kick the  soccer ball around! You should try it. See you all in hell, I  mean the ring of fire. I wish everyone the best!
---
My Gatling plasma seems to randomly create almost empty cores. Does that happen to Gatling lasers too?
---
Have you tried it?
---
Same.
---
I don’t know how to fix anything when it comes to this game, if there’s a verify game cache option, I’d try it.
---
You have to complete the side quest The Motherlode at the Hornwright HQ building
---
You can go it alone and get the executive ID card, if you prefer here is a link to the walkthrough for 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Motherlode
---
Loaded it back up for the update. I stored a generator and went to put it somewhere else and it just wouldn't work, thing was grteen but just wouldn't play anywhere. I'll give it another few months i guess. such a frustrating game
---
i would love to see watoga as a battleground
---
Stability in the game , I gues they are still working on it and maybe even in the future actually include it... who knows
---
Right? Im a die hard Bethesda fan myself but i admit i was slightly turned off by all the issues. I stuck it out and its paid off but i almost gave up on Fo76 MANY times for good lol
---
I added you though.
---
Those are avatars for your icon
---
Yay, I’m one of a “small number of players”!
---
I've had it where I was still on the loading screen and could hear my teammates on chat clearly in game and moving and reacting to other players.  They said my pip showed up but I couldn't be seen.  Then after loading it was impossibly laggy.
---
I would take that over silence
---
Im pretty sure western has higher base damage. And i didnt start finding it till around lvl25 or so.
---
They both have a bunch of mods and that AA one you get from the responders quest will be your go to for a bunch of lvls.
---
Got my first kills with the Somerset in survival so even tho its lvl 5 and im a rifleman... It stays in the chest.
---
Oh thank u very much
---
&gt;Once you obtain plans for a tinker workbench, the components can be bulk packed with plastic and stored. This further brings down the weight. 
---
This only decreases weight on certain junk components, lead and aluminum I believe are the only ones affected.
---
Of course they were! Fallout is famous for some wacky characters.
---
I have the exact same issue.  The game runs extremely well on my rig but the stuttering is really difficult to accept.  I can't really find much info on it, im guessing because there are not many players?  I play multiple games currently on my 9700k and 2070 gtx.  All of them run fantastic including the division 2, rage 2, metro exodus.  Fallout 76 looks the worst by far and is the only game that stutters.  The crazy part is if you hold W and just run in a very small circle the stuttering occurs.  ANY forward movement will cause it to stutter.  If you stand still and just spin 360 degrees, the stuttering stops.  It has something to do with whatever assets are loading or streaming when moving forward.  Nobody has a fix and it is only effecting some people apparently.  It feels like they really have no incentive look into this let alone fix it.  I'm trying to give the game a chance but it's not worth the frustration.  I spent alot of money on this rig so I would not have to worry about this stuff and i don't think the game is really worth the hassle of reddit posts and reading bethesda forums etc.
---
You do realize 76 is not that much more demanding than apex so my computer shouldn't be almost impossible to play on one but just fine on the other right?
---
I am a fan of the Quad Explosive Western Revolver.  While not as much damage as a Bloodied Western, the small magazine limitation can be frustrating.  
---
I have a high level character that has the maxed gun gunslinger perk cards and have tried all the weapons that benefit from them including the pipe rifles.  I would say the Western Revolver is the best overall. 
---
I can get higher dps from my Bloodied 10mm and Bloodied Plasma Pistol.  The trade off is more ammo use with the 10mm and more more durability loss with the plasma.  This is why I found the Western to be the best mix of damage,  ammo efficiency, and VATS usage.
---
Okay cool i figured out you had to favorite atom shop items to be wearing stuff or have gun skins
---
Yeah instigating is the way to go with pve. My 1* instigating combat shotgun clears West Tek faster then you can say " No green stuff here"
---
But instigating explosive is broken since the last time I tested ( pre NW ) from what another redditor told me explosive hits before instigating does.
---
Really? Where's it say that? The shop's updated as the clean small generator is now on sale.
---
Thanks, very heplfull. 
---
1-Can anyone tell me what the endgame is? Hunting Legendries? 
---
2- Do i need Powerarmor for endgame?(i want to choose my build righ at begin, relocation special point is not so easy...i read you can relocat 1 point per level over 50, there is not skill reset :S )
---
Error Code 4:7:2000
---
This happens to me all the time on PC as well. It happens in the middle of playing all game modes as well where it causes me to have to go to the main menu or occasionally restart the game.
---
It seems like it’s losing my login authentication in the middle of playing the game but not booting me from the game so I can’t team, make friend requests, or accept friend requests. If I’m on a team I have to quit to desktop before I can log in and team again or else it leaves me in a team that doesn’t exist.
---
It's not easy in the beginning man. Trust me, I cannot tell you how many trees I climbed, buildings I climbed places I hid just so I could kill higher lvl enemies in the beginning. It is hard but there's no real consequence to dying as long as you always store your junk. It gets easier I promise.
---
People are typically cool in the game.  If you’d like to play with someone either at a new player level or a higher level I’m up for playing with a new person.  I have been meaning to start a second character.  I also have social anxiety depending on the day (energy level, etc).
---
The weapon/armor balance is still completely broken, and if you avoid getting sniped long enough you'll end up in the top 3 and have a big fucking target painted on your back. 
---
I'm good enough at avoiding people and managed to take a fresh character from 1-60 something entirely in survival, but ending up on the leader board always seems to happen at the worst time. I was on the "protect the chiefs" stage of a silo run when I showed up on the map, and someone managed to notice, run through the silo, killed me, and stole my nuke.
---
Try sticking to your level zone. Refer to map below. Also you need to be more strategic, you can't just run into a mob of enemies. Pick them off one by one at a distance. As for stims, check every container. Check if you've learned how to make healing salves. Easiest to craft and as useful as stims at that level.

---
I spent $99.95 AUD at release, absolutely no regrets
---
I use the KISS method, and oversimplify here.
---
Everything I’m about to write does NOT apply to certain 3 start modifiers (bloodied, anti armor, TSE, sentinel, unyielding, etc)
---
When it comes to the majority of legendaries, they are junk, and I’m not much of a gambler, so I’m not a fan of scripping. Feels like a waste of time after multiple turn ins now.
---
I sell all the legendaries I can fit in my stash by these rules in my vending:
---
1 star for 75 caps
---
2 star for 150 caps
---
3 star for 250 caps
---
If I fill my stash and play for 3 hours, I’ve never logged off without selling all of my legendaries. The real key might be that my CAMP is right next to a train station too.
---
If it is a good or great legendary, I’ll usually put them in my vending at 750-1200 caps or just sell them here or on the PS4 community pages.
---
I actually think I commented on that post! Was it about a instigating explosive hunting rifle? I might have been the one to state that to you. Lol
---
Guaranteed that's it. 5400 RPM drives are great for static file storage. Not great for rapid access performance. Switch to a 500 GB or 1 TB SSD for under $150 (Samsung EVO are decent), or if M.2/NVMe is an option, you're looking at $150-250. Your performance boost will be substantial.
---
There's a fairly short teleport distance with VATS, maybe 5-8 feet. I haven't heard of the going through walls thing, and I'm sure it's not intended behavior, but it also wouldn't surprise me.
---
Max agility and luck.
---
Lots of crits and gunslinger perks with stealth as well.
---
Maybe 4 charisma for lone wander/5 intelligence for gunsmith
---
And the rest in perception for vats.
---
The most important card will be good doggy tho.☺
---
Even then there's a huge element of luck/RNG involved. Speccing into bonus heavy weapon bonus and demo expert doesn't do shit unless you're lucky enough to to find an explosive heavy weapon.
---
"But it's not like they aren't in the process of fixing those too."  --  For f\*cks sake, how long does it take to fix the nuked plants around White Springs... a place in the top 3 or 4 places to be nuked.   It has been 7 months and during a nuke event there are plants that cannot be picked up, ever...I could show them in person which ones if needed.   There are other plants that NEVER get irradiated even though they are in a nuke zone...I could show them those, too.    This is just one example of the bugs that have been around for 7 months that would have been trivial to fix if they cared about Quality Control at all.
---
How do you know that Bethesda has done enough research?  Because you see some buzz in the short term about this new game mode?    That's an awfully big assumption to be giving them the benefit of the doubt given their past performance.  They sent out one poll and some people indicated that it would be a good idea?  Hmm.    Still questionable in my mind.   Especially when they let the main part of the game suffer slow updates and slowly added content for months because of the resources they had to pull in order to pull this new mode off.
---
I can agree with you on the free-to-play week being a good idea.  They should have done that months ago if the game had actually been fixed properly early on.   They should do the free to play periodically to allow people to get in and get hooked on what ever part of the game works for them.  As a person that bought a game up front that was advertised as X,Y,Z....I would like them to deliver on X,Y,Z first before they continue to add crap that I didn't pay money for.  I also would like them to quit breaking some of the most popular mods and start working WITH mod developers because there is obviously a large demand for some of what the modders are fixing / messing with.
---
I have to get it installed/updated etc. I probably should've said I play on PS4.
---
I'm dusting of my Furious MG-42 that didn't really seem to be all that good when I used it over a month ago. Now I can see what the real damage is...
---
I see constructive criticism get upvoted all the time. The only stuff I see that gets downvoted is autistic screeching about canvas bags, plastic rum bottles, and other nonsense that has no bearing on the actual game.
---
A lil creativity and a lil madness. Maybe a pinch of WWE
---
It would be a special stash you got in the atom shop probably!
---
You can 3 tap a power armor user no problem.
---
The 76 vitriol is, and has always been, at least 90% meme. I don't see that aspect changing for a while, but there has definitely been a surge in positive opinions and people who actually play the game. The first few months were rough, to say the least, and I am not saying that Bethesda did nothing wrong, but the last few months have definitely given me hope that this game has a bright future ahead.
---
What are you even complaining about
---
That's hardly possible now.they changed the way half wall works and that trick is almost impossible
---
It gets better give it time.
---
Still a shit show though. It's the people that don't even play so I don't know why they're putting in effort to comment on a game they don't touch. The ignorance too, I kept seeing comments along the lines of "battle royale? I don't want that! I want to explore" and other stuff to imply that it was only BR now.
---
I can play without interactions for the most part. And there's a "no" emote you can use as well. Even in group events, you just have to figure how to help - no need to be social.
---
Yes! That was you. Was some of the most legit info I ever got. Made everything click.
---
I’ve explored almost the entire map except for the last two on the right, is there not a way to play the game at less of a huge handicap like the other fallouts, I just want to explore and finish the story
---
Well we all know that millions of duped junk did make the servers crash so it must affect server performance.
---
It’s not that bad
---
Thanks a bunch :)
---
I’ve been playing for 3 hours and gained one level, and died 5 times, I can’t advance the story and I can’t explore more of the map how do I just give it time?
---
Is it possible to have a mutual base between friends or does everyone have to have their own camps in separate places even if you're on the same team?
---
But again, like I was trying to explain, video games are different to other forms of art/media. Even if you don't necessarily enjoy them, movies and paintings and other forms of art can be appreciated artistically. They can even go so far as to purposefully make you uncomfortable or provoke feelings of anger and disgust. Video games are different because they're often a long-form media; things like Fallout 76 want you immersed in this world for hundreds and thousands of hours. For that reason, it needs to be more reactive and giving of what people want more than other media forms. You can't hold people's attention-span without doing that. It's not compromising on your artistic vision, or whatever you want to call it, because surely the core artistic vision for a game like Fallout is for its fans to enjoy it. Surely things like having people immersed in the world and such a bigger goal.
---
You won't be able to use it in Nuclear Winter
---
Only thing that worked for me going in was my super bright flashlight
---
Had a teammate yell f this game couple rounds ago. We had the guy pinned in a bus and I was sniping- took out his buddy who was pretty good, sniping wars going on. He was really hurt in the bus and teammate went in to finish him off and something happened but the guy took him from 100 to nothing xD I dunno maybe lag or something or maybe my teammate had a muscle spasm who knows he roid raged. It seems to hit for me, a bit delayed but as long as when I pull the trigger and the hit box is there it registers. The heavy guns like gatlin seem to miss a lot but I haven't found a stabilized card. 
---
Watched grimmmz last night and he made it look like a joke- so latency free on his end took out 10 guys by himself right at the beginning with shit weapons. Reminds me of landing at school in pubg. All I know for me, it hits lever, combat rifle, scoped no scope, shotguns all hit. The autos recoil is a thing but there's no bullet drop that I see sniping.
---
No fix for the Gatling Plasma Core bug. *cries*
---
You're trying to reduce my argument to absurd terms.  That is not a fair argument tactic and you're also using false equivalency to do it.   You see something on the internet you disagree with and you are using the weakest of argument tactics to try and "come back with something", but your shot went across the bow, hit a bunch of wide open air and sunk into the ocean with no lasting effect other than the water level raising an imperceptible amount higher because of what you too have thrown into it.   
---
So, you may disagree with me, you might even call into question things I have said, but instead you chose the argumentative equivalent of pissing into the wind.   
---
My point that the game was promised to be something up front that has not been properly fixed / repaired over the last 7 months still stands.  This has nothing to do with how I play the game, but with what they offered for sale, but now they are focusing on adding a whole bunch of other crap that I never would have bought into, but they already have my money.  All I'm left with is the ability to voice my displeasure at how they've chosen to change the direction of the game WITHOUT fixing issues that are 7 months old.
---
This
---
You can only really communicate with other players in game, by using a microphone. Hardly anyone seems to be using microphones though.
---
I've played the game for 3 months, and i prefer playing solo, I meet players on and off, usually around camps, and it's usually just throwing a few emotes, like waving or heart and then we go on our seperate way.
---
Guess i have to team up.💩
---
Unlikely
---
Make healing salves at a chem station, all the ingredients are found in Flatwoods.  This will get you by until you find more stimpacks.  
---
Perhaps start a new character since it’s been a while...you may have forgotten a lot.  
---
If enemies seem too hard you might try switching servers, see if they spawn in closer to your level.  Otherwise you are just in a difficult area...go back to easy areas to replenish your supplies (chems, ammo, etc)
---
New player here. Fallout 76 was only Betheda game that i don´t want to play, but with free week i give a try : Its much better then i expected. Veterans are very Helpfull so far, i had lots of randoms come to help me.
---
Maybe i will buy F76 after this week and stay there. I know thats not a stroy thats you asking for but i want to tell my feelings about this game \^\^
---
I enjoy giving them nukashine then seeing their reaction when they blackout and spawn in a high level area.
---
The weapons are tweaked in NW though
---
Or lead pipe
---
From what I’ve seen, folks are generally pretty friendly. You can use the emotes to communicate, and don’t actually have to speak to anyone. 9/10 times emotes get the point across. If I had a cap for every time I saw someone help out a newbie, I’d have..a lot of caps.
---
I didnt want it at all but I love it.
---
Developers like Battle Royale because it’s easy and cheap—at least relative to the rest of a game like FO76. It also draws in players who buy cosmetics. They won’t need a lot of resources to keep NW interesting, so I’m not worried about it. 
---
The BR players can come in and subsidize the rest of the game all they like.
---
0 wins level 8.  8 tips for 8 levels!  
---
1. Start shooting a second later after the enemy starts firing in close combat automatic weapon encounters to die first.
---
2. Use an automatic weapon with a slightly lower damage output than your opponent to die first.
---
3. Panic when someone gets the jump on you.
---
4. Try to reload your gun as someone charges you with melee
---
5. Spawn in slower than others with no invisibility or invinciblity (this takes some practice) and appear in front of someone with an automatic weapon.
---
6. Make sure your weapon leaves enemies with 1/10th health when you die.
---
7. Get nuke codes and drop a tactical nuke in close quarters combat, make sure you are near the center of the circle for best results.
---
8. Play with with a loud ass AC unit behind you so you cannot hear footsteps or other movement noises.
---
Easily my most favorite quest to date. "Initiating coffee break"
---
Man, I am sooo damn careful scrapping legendaries, I don't think I cohld go any slower! LOL!
---
I must be the unlucky as hell. I NEVER get anything good.
---
to be honest i would rather see deathmatch gamemode
---
Oh yes, it's worth it. Scrapping the ones I made finally gave it up.
---
Took out a whole team deck in power armor by tossing a plasma mine through a window in their sky CAMP
---
100% it’s still terrible but I’ve seen more good comments lately. It’s a pure example of how entitled people are. Who cares about the opinion of someone that doesn’t use/play a product????? These people think we do!!
---
Shows different sets of armour with the brown vtec paint so far only one armour type
---
Honestly the problem is there are so many high levels in the game and these high levels spawn high enemies even in low level areas which sucks for new players. Pretty much the only thing you can do to avoid this is stay in the forest, toxic valley, or ash heap to avoid high level enemies. Until you’re lvl 50. I’m a high level and feel bad for spawning level 68 super mutants at top of the world.
---
Exactly one wrong move and there goes your entire build lol
---
This is only the 200th post saying the exact same thing. Great job, OP
---
It's pretty obvious from square one that Vault 51 is basically hunger gamesy, so the terminals and such are a way of slowly unravel the story as you follow in their fate.
---
Considering Sony are being a bunch of babies about cross play, I highly doubt it.
---
As a Sony loyalist, it pisses me off.
---
&gt; You can only really communicate with other players in game, by using a microphone. 
---
Not true for XBox btw.  You can click on someone on the map and send a text or voice message to them.
---
I just spent time traveling doing some quests but mostly traveling killing getting killed a lot. Learning the game and dying and going into place where I died 5 or 6 times trying to get away. Your lvl will go up and so will the rewards. If you don’t have the patience then perhaps the game isn’t for you. I’ve cussed this game many times but stuck with it. Still die but I’m getting stronger smarter
---
I don't know I have over 350+ friends on my main account (nuke launcher/broadcaster of launches). I don't get that stutter that your posting about.
---
I do play on PC with a solid high speed net connection, and a good speced PC. Not sure, others have said it's an issue, haven't seen it myself.
---
Also I don't use mods
---
Then what do you want? The regular game mode is solo. This is literally called battle royale... 
---
I’m a solo player myself but I don’t understand everyone complaining all the time about needing “more solo”. Chill out and just enjoy the game. If you can’t communicate with your team, oh well, not like it changes much if you solo anyway.
---
It would be cool if they added jumpsuits for all the various factions. Then you could all look like a team.
---
You can use a single camp, but it will be marked as owned by the builder. Realistically you wont spend much time at camps though.
---
Yes please!! This. Especially with Nuclear Winter, people who don't voice chat needs a way to communicate with their team.
---
That's not what I said, but way to completely mischaracterize my argument so that you can provide your own snarky response.    Also, where did I say "Where are the NPCs"?    Where did I say "FUCK NPCs"?   I didn't .  I have specific issues with how much time and attention they are devoting to PvP / Battle Royale crap.   PvP was not supposed to be a major part of the game.  People hated it in the Adventure mode so they split it off...and now they are making it a major part of the game BEFORE they are showing any real progress at fixing a number of open issues that have been reported to them for MANY MONTHS at this point.   Yeah, I'm skeptical about their priorities.
---
I am talking about bugs that have been present for 7 months that are some of the simplest things to fix.   It's not unreasonable to use them as an example of something that really should have been dealt with long before now.
---
Regarding the alien thing:  That's great.  I didn't catch that.  I'll give that a try again.... considering I've seen that flatwoods monster twice in 400 hours of playing.   It'll only be another 150 hours and maybe I'll see him again.  (1 of those times was during the week where they increased the spawn rate for him....I only saw him once during that week.  That was several months ago.)
---
I always mic up.  Just had a great game with a Russian guy.  Joking around and killing people.  We ended up winning the Battle.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcOK5F1TdDI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2
---
Here is the last five minutes.
---
Dont forget to take some defensive perks too.  The difference between having say Lone Wanderer or Blocker can be night and day.
---
Also it's worth noting you gain xp form killing any level of creature.  Even at 216 I still get xp for level 1 creatures.  It's small but it's there.  You can always go do some events in Morgantown or the forest to help you level up before adventuring into a new zone that's currently above your level.
---
oh my bad, playing on PC
---
Not to be rude or anything but damn man, if you have to wait till your next paycheck for a 15$ purchase for a video game cosmetic, I'd recommend not buying that and saving your money.
---
It goes in tiers. Pipe guns start at 1 and go to 5, 10, and so on. Some weapons cant be used until level 20 or 25
---
It’s a bug
---
We are all breathtaking!
---
I use the reveal enemies but I found it last like 30 seconds
---
It's rare to get enough nuke codes and a case so best option is probably a free stimpak
---
Their is no difficulty setting. Best you can do is refer to the map i provided. If you're only doing the main story, you'll either need way better gear, friends to protect you along the way, or simply play more strategically. 
---
Their is tons to explore and tons of side quests. Go back to the easier areas and explore some more. Doing side quests and world events, even discovering new locations will help you level up so you can proceed with main story.
---
Armor and weapons have level benchmarks. Leather, for example, has levels 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. A level 2 person is going to be sporting level 1 armor until they hit level 5.
---
In my experience, just to pull some rough estimates out of my butt:
---
70% of players ignore you like you don't exist
---
15% of players want to trade
---
14% of players send you a random team invite
---
1% of players want to cause you grief
---
Battle 👏 Royale 👏 Doesn't 👏 Mean 👏 It 👏 Has 👏 To 👏 Be 👏 TEAMS 👏 .  I want to play the battle royale mode, but when I can't even talk to the people around me and everyone's doing their own thing it gets fucking annoying.
---
Updated, thanks!
---
Yes, I know. I just hope there is a system to put you in a Battle with similar overseer level.
---
Not an MMO by any definition.
---
You should try NW it’s a blast
---
"I Live all the way in..."
---
This game really does make you feel that feel, doesn't it?
---
Thank you.   That does sound mildly interesting and I certainly have no issue with you enjoying what they are offering.  I have problems with their priorities as a customer who paid up front for their game when they had a clear description of what it was going to be. I feel like they have not delivered on that promise because of all the crap that is still broken 7 months later... and even 3 months later from things they have introduced into the game (intentional and unintentional as the case may be).
---
I'm sincerely glad you are finding some things to like about the new mode, but wish they would have done it later.... AFTER they fixed another 50 - 100 issues that have needed fixing for a long time.
---
I never asked for it but it's probably my favorite BR.
---
But what is the difference if you weren’t on that team then? If it makes no difference to you then there is no difference. Just think you happen to use a few lookouts that can take a few billets for you before you get hit. It’s just a beta, chill tf out man
---
Sometimes a first impression is all you get
---
Hi, the error is:
---
An unknown error has occurred.
---
[4:7:2000]
---
It happens when I am in the game for over 10 minutes and try going to the main menu.
---
Thank you in advance for following this up.
---
That would have been pretty cool especially if they monetized it even a 1/4 as well as Fortnite has monetized their F2P.
---
It is pretty good.. You can even snipe with it. Big numbers with the heavy weapons perk, sometimes 90 at quite a distance.
---
My friend gave me a barbed flaming pitchfork when I was new (level 5 or 10).... At level 25 I still have it and it's my favourite thing. Spread the pitchfork love :)
---
Another suggestion, I think that the NW mode would greatly benefit if the emotes were bound to the numpad keys, so that we could use them with a single press. "come here" "follow me" "stay put" especially.
---
Haha, right?! God damn. I hover on each screen for like 10 seconds confirming all is well!
---
I had a guy start poking me with a switchblade when I was getting scrip the other day, spamming all the emotes and just being annoying. Like dude I'm trying to make sure I dont trade my AAE .50 rifle leave me alone with your giant owl mask!
---
Remove any mods, remove custom.in, rename preference.ini, restart launcher, verify files,
---
Are the basic steps
---
Also would help to know specs on your machine.
---
The enemies have gotten some buffs or become more of a bullet sponge. The forest region is always low level so grind events there for easy exp. Also be aware of who is in that area. If you are in the same area as a high level, the enemies will spawn based on that persons level. The forest region is the only exception to that.
---
I mean.. You could just read ingame.
---
Not just twitter. Any Bethesda video has terrible comments. Any gaming news channel, even one of those sticking to actual news (instead of just outrage farming) attracts people who comment in negatives about EVERYTHING. And don't even try to look under Bethesda Facebook posts... 
---
And now replace Bethesda with CDPR and Fallout with Cyberpunk... and the situation gets reversed. Only possitivity is allowed. Anyone sharing any worries about the game or doesn't consider it worth the hype gets shouted down to oblivion. Or take a look at comments about E3. People shouting at Cyberpunk tease: "OMG, these people are so excited". People shouted abd Bethesda conference: "OMG, these people are paid actors".
---
I wear a dress
---
Stay in the Forest area until around level 20 or so.  Do events, quests that keep you in the Forest.  Stick around the Overseer's CAMP or Flatwoods, high level players like to visit and gift low levels with stuff.
---
Yes it's broken, and Bethesda is aware. Unequipping and reequipping **all** my perk cards fixes it for me, until I server hop or logout. Not a solution, just a workaround until Bethesda can fix it.
---
Thanks for the info. I'd like to be helpful/engage etc. but also want to kinda play it like a classic Fallout.
---
Only teams of four no matter if you queue solo
---
You on PS4? Can you mod mine? :)
---
Dude! You don't understand! I want to play solo on Nuclear Winter, not fuck around with people I barely know and just HOPE we're on the same wavelength! I'm solo main for a reason, I can barely interact with people even if I DID have a mic
---
I went to the place On the Summerville Lake location, and did NOT locate the airplane at all.
---
Poor Anne.
---
They just need to add in a timer in adventure mode. Lock the bag for 90 seconds to make it unlootable, so you at least have a chance to recover your gear. I've died during SBQ fights, and not even five seconds later I see the "another player has taken your loot" warning. Like, really? My body probably hasn't even hit the ground yet due to lag and my shit's looted.
---
Atom shop
---
Hey Bethesda. FIX your BROKEN respawns. It keeps happening to me. I'll die and my controls will become unresponsive. The button to respawn won't work and all my buttons won't do anything. I'm constantly just getting stuck watching the camera spin around my dead body. Then I have to close and reopen the application, losing all my junk.
---
Not holding my breath
---
Your in the hardest part. 20-30 is a weird time after that you will start filling out your build and become more powerful. Better guns start dropping soon also. 
---
Make sure you sleep for a bit and eat a canned stew for a 10% combined xp buff. Survival has a 20% xp buff also so if you want to go grinding out quests thats the place to lvl up fast.
---
try accepting or denying all pending friends list requests in your social menu.  
---
Also, lower fov to see if that's it: in weird cases this can get maxed out which causes problems even for a beastly system like yours.  
---
Lastly try the "scan and repair" option from the launcher.  If none of the above helps, I got nothing.
---
I've been in teams of 3 in a full 52 person lobby 7 times and a team of 2 in a full lobby 3 times. So.... There's a way it it's bugged or something.
---
I'm thinking about my estimates and I should probably reduce that "15% want to trade" number.  Player vending has really reduced the amount of people I get requesting trades.  They just go to my machines instead.  I guess that's still interaction of some sort though - with my machines, not me :-)
---
That is your assertion.  Are you saying you have some first hand knowledge of this being true?  I'm not trying to pry / put you in an awkward position if you do.  If you don't know this to be true, then you're just guessing.
---
Also, can you guarantee that the creation of NW didn't pull people away from other teams?   Design teams (software / hardware / anything) are usually fluid and they grow and shrink based on the other project demands.  When a new project comes in (like an entire new game mode in a software project) then they get pulled from existing teams and perhaps some new hires.   You'd have to have some pretty compelling first hand knowledge to be able to say that the Adventure team hasn't suffered for the added development efforts.
---
You get a mixed bag, solos, friends in twos or threes, and full squads.
---
Yeah just bugged it’s supposed to be teams of four, I’ve gotten that a couple times too.
---
I really used to like Jim Sterling. I never missed a Jimquisition. Now... he has really jumped on the hate bandwagon. 
---
I now actively ignore any videos on Youtube that "discuss" games. I've learned to not give a crap about other peoples opinions.
---
Define cheap. Amazon has it for $17

Jim Stirling has fallen from his original self. He was a true consumer advocate with some weird manners. I respected him for giving Fallout 4 the score of 9.5/10. And since then? He replaced consumer advocacy with hating on AAA companies. He switched from considering the whole picture of any situation to presenting only the bads and strawmanning the rest. Ever since his "year of the lootbox" and "Overwatch is at fault for lootboxes" strawmans, I stopped following him.
---
I’ll say it again - Remove PvP in adventure mode cause all it enables is senseless trolling.
---
You should use your atoms for things you really want. As you play longer, fewer are awarded. Repair kits are a one use item whereas skins and stuff are account-wide, stay forever, and are often only available for a limited time.
---
I much prefer survival and BR over death match. Personally never really liked games where you die and spawn quickly back in to the fight. I mostly just want to see a proper good survival mode.
---
I hate TS, discord, voidchat...what ever. I always mute voice chat at first in this kind games. I used in the past lots of TS for Wow, there was some ppl they talked withouth pause, even much more then my ex wife XD Or ppl eating without push to talk or yelling angry kids etc. I heard lots of stuff...nope i´m to old for this shit. no Voice chat with randoms and even not with some ppl that i know in real

That's funny to hear from you again. I have a few handmades I want to test to see the best damage TSE, and AAE, BE, and in different modes semi and auto. I also have a 2 legacy laser rifles I want to come back and try but I think the durability on them is still bad.  Going to be interesting to see the damage on them all.
---
pretty sure it's pending friends requests as opposed to accepted friends, if that makes sense.  OP can correct me if I'm wrong though,
---
How many games did you win to reach the level of the laser rifle skins? 
---
Also,since they're skins open to everyone,can you test if you can paint the rifle of a friend?
---
The optimization in this game isn’t amazing but your graphics card also isn’t brilliant so that may be why.
---
Glad to help!
---
I mean I see the need for it being a wasteland and all. But for stupid high level players with power armour to be able to destroy super low level players with pipe weapons is a bit much.
---
You play in your area of the map - you can explore later when you’re high enough to actually do so. If the enemies are too high that’s normally because a higher level player has been nearby. Sometimes server hopping can fix this
---
The other thing I do have is 16Gb of ram, no virtual drive. So from initial loading any textures etc are sitting in ram which is just as fast as any SSD. My SSD is purely for operating system and launchers.
---
Invite in main menu
---
They released game right before ada complience became manditory. Not implying it was on purpose, but is convient for them to not have to add it if they dont want. 
---
On ps4 i will psn message ppl if we nees to communicate and no mic.
---
Does it reveal enemies to everyone or just you and your team
---
It's fucking awesome, honestly.
---
I dont think anyone expects this game mode to replace other BRs..
---
most people know the game is way to janky to have a serious competitive PVP
---
I've played several different battle royale games and haven't liked any of them. Nuclear winter is enough Fallout that I enjoy it.
---
Uh that’s not correct at all.
---
A tiny part? A large part of the community is loving Nuclear Winter because of the balance and removal of certain things.
---
Survival could’ve been everything anybody could’ve wanted out of this game but now it actually acts as a filter. Think about that. A large part of Fallout’s community is so toxic that a mode was created to act as a filter to keep them out of Adventure and Nuclear Winter. A shithead catching filter.
---
Survival is like the open server for Diablo 2 if any of you remember. That’s where you could find all the frauds.
---
Yeah. I was really hoping for this too. I bought the tinfoil outfit specially for NW. Hopefully, they let us change it just like the outfits soon.
---
Having been playing it, the camp building is severely limited, and automated defenses are rare items you can find. No lag issues I have seen so far, although I have had a CTD at one point, before I entered the lobby.
---
Yup you got that right, nothing special from wins at the moment, except a small XP bonus for the win. As far as advice goes, if you see a bag containing your ammo of choice, pick up the whole bag rapidly. Looting through slowly puts you at high risk for being sniped from far away. Always keep 3 or more stimpaks on you unless your teammates are in need, and try to take combat and health boosting meds (fury, medx, psycho, etc) if your teammates call an enemy in the distance that doesn't yet pose an active threat. As far as gameplay is concerned, focus on your cover. Foliage in this game acts as great camouflage, helping you sneak around the enemy for flanks and to reposition out of danger if you need to med. If you're in a firefight in a building, don't rush the threat unless you have enough backup to outnumber them. If you're outside on the other hand, try to quickly move from tree to tree or rock to rock to confuse enemies and shake them off your location. A lot of this advice is pertinent for having set teams of people you can talk to in a group chat. 
---
If you're playing with random squads, always cover your 6 and keep more meds than you think you need. Use randoms as a bullet sponge to flank the enemy. It can mean the difference between getting sprayed down with your blind 70 year old squadmates or flanking and catching multiple enemies off guard when they're distracted. This is obviously all situational advice. Best bet is to find a good group of relaxed players and do a few dozen matches with them until you get comfortable. Being quiet and keeping your head low will lower your chances of being the first person spotted and increase your situational awareness. If you're struggling, be a support player for your teammates, as they will need strong backup as opposed to teammates who they have to worry about saving. 
---
I've played around 250 hours of Apex Legends which has really helped me avoid getting myself trapped in bad situations, but not everybody has that experience so the learning curve for BR games can be difficult. Best of luck and feel free to message me if you need any help.
---
But I’ve explored my entire “area for my level” and the one above it what do I do? Just run around the same buildings killing the same mobs not completing any new quests?
---
Yes! I liked the game from the start and since patch 7 its became lovable
---
Few issues.
---
1.set you radion card to primary and disable your build in one
---
2. Running 8gb ram isn't really enough, ithere will say differently, but 16gb is the industry standard for game requirements ( to run smoothly).
---
3. Not sure anore on the Xeon line but should handle most play on low.
---
Your main issue is that your trying to run the game off the build in graphic card not the radion. Try the above fix. Without the ram and post results please
---
It honestly wasn’t even that bad on launch, I’ve played since there was a pre-beta thing on Xbox. Only issue I’ve ever encountered was a quest that I couldn’t finish, but I restarted my game and it was fixed. There are and have been some frame rate issues but nothing comparable to what the internet has been complaining about.
---
What he said. Invite to team from the main menu before joining.
---
Haha no prob. Your name keeps making me lol when I read it btw.
---
The Gatling gun is insane
---
That could make sense with the funky net code. And that issue I don't have since I dump pendings each day before I start playing
---
I think the entire map should useable but the section that starts off as fire free is random each game. So some games you’ll start with the circle towards the south east and sometimes the circle will be towards the north west
---
The silver shroud costume goes over armor and also counts as formal wear for challenges.
---
Thanks, hopefully they fix it soon!
---
How the hell does "No NPC's" equal to greed? How the hell is 76 barely a game? Come to think of it, why the hell am I even reply to this? It's a mystery. Shhh.
---
What's funny to me is the people cursing Bethesda and fo76 in the comments are still making demands even though they don't even play the game
---
Force new characters in survival mode with no gear, remove legendaries and I shall play a lot.
---
I'm hoping they just made a mistake increasing the budget on on the mothman neon billboards. There was a difference in the budget costs on the mothman billboard and the WV billboard pre-patch (wv was more expensive.) They might have tried to make them match and screwed up when doing so. 
---
At least I hope that's what happened because I don't have any budget now as well thanks to the recent changes.
---
"I once worked with a guy for 3 years, never knew his name. Best friend i ever had. We still dont talk sometimes."
---
How? Just how??? In just a couple of days? Just take my upvote.
---
Is melee even viable at all in this?  Seems like guns pretty much are the only option which might make it difficult for my melee built-character to work in this mode.
---
You can wear whatever clothes you’ve bought off the atomic shop in the lobby by going to the atomic shop &gt; going to that cosmetic &gt; and clicking ‘ NW favourite ‘
---
As far as I know ,  cursor acceleration is being removed and you'll be able to modify it.
---
Currently there's only four maps: Flatwoods, Charleston, Morgantown and Harpers Ferry.
---
buying clothes won't save your life! I've honestly found better clothes in the wasteland. But sure great suggestion.
---
Correct, fallout's BR should focus on entertainment. However it aint gonna help if streamers are now dumpstering on it once again.
---
No to mention casual players who want to play with familiar settings, not having comfortable settings can drive people away from both NW and adventure.
---
But! But! Gamers are supposed to be toxic!
---
God Bless You.
---
Oh man I need this plan so bad so I can pimp out my Bloodied 25 Ultracite Gatling Laser I got from the Purveyor.
---
Ya, not to be an ass but there have been 100+ posts asking the same thing! Over the last 48 hours. 
---
Give them a read and you’ll get all the answers!
---
Thanks!!
---
The more you know! Thanks for enlightening me
---
&gt; but this game was created, based on no npcs
---
Fallout 76 was created based upon a LOT of things. First and foremost, it's supposed to be a Fallout game. Fallout as a series is synonymous with RPGs. Fallout 76 does not have enough RPG mechanics, e.g. a meaningful questline. They could have made this game without NPCs, yes, but to do that they needed way stronger environmental storytelling - not just audio tapes that always make you feel like you're one step behind the action. They also needed more players on a server and to give those players the proper mechanics for them to subtitute the NPCs. That means a proper store mechanic, the ability to create quests for other players, to open taverns or do other things. None of that is really in the game, so the world feels too empty.
---
That is exactly why I posted, to get peeps thoughts! 👍
---
There really isn’t - adventure mode should have been coop PvE all along.  Never seen one bit of good come out of adventure mode PvP ever and I’ve been playing since day 1 of beta last year.
---
I am having the same issue. I have already reinstalled the launcher and redownloaded the game + verified game files.
---
In addition, I am also running the launcher as admin.
---
&gt;All this battle royale shit (and yes I call it shit) is stuff that wasn't advertised / promised up front but it IS taking away from the development of the Adventure game.
---
Simply untrue. They were developed by entirely different studios.
---
The second one, however you can build fairly close to one another given a big enough area. Also, since you'll be on a team you can see their camp on your map plus with player vending you can also see their camps on the map  and it's a great way to meet and group up with people.
---
The DOF slider seems to be useless, at least for me. I had to edit some ini settings to remove it completely.
---
True, it could be worse, but the system of how you get better items and what they do is still bad and should be improved.
---
Two things, 
---
You have to be smart with your encounters and not be afraid to run away when you are outclassed or even not engage at all. You cannot just bull your way through every encounter unless you are over leveled with top level equipment.
---
You also need to have the levels and equipment to venture into high level areas which you acquire by doing side quests and spending time exploring in detail the lower level areas.  If you try to punch ahead on the main quest while ignoring the rest of the world you will hit a wall.  
---
If you can't do those things then this is not the game for you.  There is no difficulty setting you can change.  Good hunting.
---
I’m in TX and usually jump on around 9:30-10pm.
---
Exactly!!
---
Woah shit dude you must be a lawyer or something! Oh, just some idiot on reddit? Woops my bad.
---
The absurd thing is that any of you people think that judging game companies or even being vocal about it is going to have any effect. 
---
Because for every one of you, there is 4846 other people who will buy it anyway. Game subs seem to think they are the player base or consumer base when they're not even close.
---
Game companies will continue to release games in iffy states. Because it's the new norm. 
---
Why would they delay a release or take more time developing when they can release and make a bunch of money..... Then apologize and patch it somewhat. There's literally no incentive for them. 
---
Because a notable boycott or even backlash won't do shit, because the public forgets as soon as there's a new release of a notable IP. 
---
Sad. But true.
---
So why the hell do we need a BR? I would rather a harsh nuclear winter that the players need to create things to battle the elements
---
Yep. Youtubers and similar "journalist" work with a volatile crowd. I even dare to say entitled crowd. Gamers. Gamers can basically overnight decide that game X is the Holy Grail and game Y is satan's turd. It becomes their dogma and nothing is able to change that. And a youtuber faces a big decision. To be fair, be labeled as Bethesda shill and generally go against the dogma? Or just nudge the truth in the direction of negativity so that the crowd gets appeaced by daily dose of outrage?
---
I follow a youtuber called Bellular. He's quite a nice guy. Also an indie developer who is quite objective. He even puts out arguments that can support even EA or Epic. Or at least show their perspective. But when it comes to Bethesda/Fallout and Bioware/Anthem, he loses all objectivity. He constructs fantasy scenarios like "Bethesda nerfed armor durability and 4 months later they released repair kits. How terrible of them" and doesn't allow any positive news around the game to dilute the narrative... I guess a knowledgable person like him must do this on purpose to not lose viewers. Especially given that he already confirmed that he uses clickbait titles because "that's how the game is played now"...
---
I agree with you
---
&gt;but there will now be all the new issues with the poorly built add-ons that should have been completed with a FULL development team, not half a development team on Adventure and half a team on this new Battle Royale B.S.
---
Once again, the fundamental premise of your argument is completely wrong. Nuclear Winter was developed by the Dallas team. Adventure mode was developed by the Maryland and Austin teams.
---
Not really.
---
Just you, not even your team.
---
I’m pretty sure there’s two different rewards, icons of the boxes early on and stash boxes later
---
Awesome! That's the spirit! 😂
---
I like your build, and think it probably works pretty well. You can probably go pretty long stretches without repairing anything. 
---
Strength - I'd think about cutting way back on the aid/chems, etc., and trade traveling pharmacy for more damage.
---
Perception - I went with three for a while, but eventually upped to 4, so I could equip glow sight, and green thumb, for nuke zone flux collecting.
---
Endurance - I like photosynthetic and sunkissed here. Do you really spend enough time being cooked to warrant radicool?
---
Charisma - I also swap hard bargain x 3 in sometimes
---
Intelligence - I think I'd cut this down to four or five points, and save makeshift warrior and power patcher for camp. 
---
Agility - more action boy; I've had born survivor for about 500 levels, now I've just come to rely on it.
---
Luck - I'd think about swapping serendipity for luck of the draw.
---
I play on PC, so I am not sure how big the download is on PS4.  Anyone?
---
Didn’t think they intended for you to keep them , not sure .
---
Sorry, xbox. If anyone us on Xbox and wants me to add beam focuser, message me. GT ProfShade2
---
Like someone else said, turn off the Team Fill, and just go in solo. You pick where you want to spawn on the map, and then go do your own thing. I played more solo than I did with a team, and had more fun as a solo player.
---
1- Yes to an extent, I spend a lot of time hunting legendaries but there are lots of things to do like repeatable daily quests and events. There are some end game bosses. As far as I know Bethesda is planning end game raids in the future as well. I find that there is a near infinite amount of things to do with the constant content drops.
---
2- Not really, power armor is useful in nuke zones for the radiation resistance but regular armor with the right legendary effects tends to be just as good if not better than power armor. It's mostly preference but I keep a couple of power armor sets only for nuke zones or maybe the bosses.
---
I still don't think this game is worth $60 so get it when it's on sale.
---
Welcome to the wastelands bro... I'm in the savage divide, hollaaaa
---
I know. I just wasn't sure if you meant that the revive is bugged or if it's just that you get out after the revive.
---
if you have a Fallout76Custom.ini file it needs to be updated. try moving it to a new/different folder and running the game. if you do not have a Fallout76Custom.ini I have no idea, try a scan and repair.
---
Underarmor is, you know, armor. They've only allowed cosmetic items.
---
If you played for a few hours, that seems early to be doing the same stuff over-and-over. Go explore. The forest is large enough that it should take awhile.
---
Get rid of the AP bar if we don't have Vats we don't need it.
---
I think it's OK if people get slightly more powerful as they advance through the game, but it's better when progression systems are built around making your character more able to fill a specific role than about simply making your character more powerful. 
---
Something along the lines of Outward would be nice.
---
It is a common RPG acronym
---
I’ve won either 9 or 10 games. Unsure of how many I have played. More about just placing consistently, kills or not. Again, they were unlocked somewhere between 10-20.
---
I will test the rifle skins in just a moment, friend. I WILL SAY, that you can place the NW cache stash boxes in friend/teammate camps. They show up with the Atomic Shop symbol in the Camp building interface, but they can be placed in others’ camps. Probably a bug as it doesn’t seem intended.
---
This is the info i was hoping for. Thanks.
---
I would totally do that, but you have to agree that 1 man vs 4 other people is a generic bad idea, and I'd much rather just go in solo with everyone else.
---
The building mechanics are a bit rough still... I managed to build a pretty sweet place but it took a little patience. There is still a piece of the roof that is green but is says that it can not be placed because it would be floating... there are 3 walls for it to attach to!!
---
Yes.   
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/byrgfc/bethesda\_hears\_us\_i\_know\_because\_being\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/byrgfc/bethesda_hears_us_i_know_because_being_an/)  \-- Dallas team made NW, in case it wasn't clear.   
---
We already knew that Adventure Mode was being developed by the Maryland and Austin offices.
---
I never paid attention that emotes were a thing. Thought that voice chat was the standard.
---
Lol youre joking right they fixed that this patch. Had 1% budget left and could place a billboard plus more.
---
Clothes aren't allowed either if you wear armor since they would cover the armor, but I don't know why under armor isn't allowed. It literally goes under the armour.
---
Was thinking of buying that just for nuclear winter.
---
So you're saying my vault tech suit that I wear under armour is also armour.
---
Do the quests that you can and then hold off for some and yes try to level by unlocking all the locations in the forest - read the posters at a train station and start the backpack quest which is in the toxic valley which shouldn’t be too high leveled. Try to do all of the events that are in the forest as they’re good ways to earn xp
---
No worries! Hopefully soon it will be added!
---
Imagine if they did this with Survival.  Start from scratch, NO LEGENDARY ANYTHING only base weapons and mods, mutations, and perks. That's it.  PVP would be balanced again.
---
it doesn't have gloves though and i'm sick of looking at my poorly digitized hands.
---
You better speak them facts boii
---
LOL.
---
This is Fallout 76. The game is a a mess and was released 6 months ago.
---
Keep doing events and make sure you’ve done all the quests in your area.
---
You’re in a funky level zone where it’s a little difficult. Keep an eye out for raider power armor and also t45 PA so once you hit 25 you can equip it and it makes it a bit easier from there.
---
there you go that would anecdotally confirm the "pending is the problem" theory :)
---
And don't forget arcade gannon
---
Best way to put it.
---
HMU @MoonlightCowboy
---
r/unexpectedoffice
---
Yeah me too I deleted nearly all my signs and got a bit of my budget back... but I see no point in placing them again. I hope so too but it got mentioned in the patchnotes so theres that...
---
Epic. You are epic. These ppl will never ever forget how you helped them. Can’t wait to get home and do the same !
---
&gt;Yeah because those of us that paid for an Adventure game seeing massive amounts of resources devoted to non-Adventure game crap aren't allowed to voice our displeasure about it. 
---
You never paid for "an Adventure game." You paid for Fallout 76.  And once again, nobody gives a fuck about your poorly informed displeasure about \*AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TEAM IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT CITY FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STUDIO\* devoting their resources to BR mode, which has \*ZERO\* effect on Adventure mode.
---
i wish they would unlock the hand slot so i could wear gloves with all these outfits that don't have them. i am the glove guy
---
Keanu?
---
Just make the map not take 3+ seconds to load
---
That's just anecdotal -- my servers have been completely full since BR came out, except when I was playing after midnight.
---
Hopefully they have delayed them. Wastelanders looks rad. And vaults opening should be big events, not something to just push out the door for some quick content drops. I have a feeling that vaults were supposed to be just simple raids, but with NPCs being added maybe they’ve gone back to the drawing board with them.
---
Also, if you add armor that has fall damage resistance X2, you are able to jump from anywhere. It's fun jumping from cliffs and buildings without PA!
---
The really scary part, imo, is how the menu will sometimes spontaneously close without hitting Tab.  I don't know what causes it, but that seems like it could lead to many tears.
---
You need to build up your healing supplies. Start at vault 76. Go from there to the overseer's camp grabbing wood and every blue flower you see on the way. From the camp follow the river to Flatwoods grabbing bloodleafs on the water's edge. Take a radx if you have one and scoop up 100 dirty water. Try and milk brahmin to get rid of the excess rads. Then cook. First boil all the water. Then go into healing and make as many healing salves as you can. They heal 20%. (Same as diluted stimpaks) then, look up the quest line "miner miracles." I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna get ugly getting in there to get the plans for the suit. But once you've built it, the whole world opens up.
---
Some fun new events and quests have been added, Imposter sheepsquatch, real sheepsquatch, burrows, Arktos basement events, weekly survival weapons, player vending, including fast travel to vendors. 
---
Bloodied is the new meta.
---
I love how Lirik played for hours and kept saying “one more” but then when asked what he thought of it, he couldn’t say anything other than something along the lines of “it’s not as shitty as I expected”
---
Nothing new, at least nothing major. PvP is for those who like being spawn camped by someone 200 levels above them. A few small quests and events got added but not a huge amount.   
---
The game's less buggy now and the servers don't crash as often. But it's still a buggy mess that makes you look back fondly at New Vegas.   
---
Still no NPCs, still no real story, still nothing to do after you kill the scorchqueen but grind, and still no fix for the loot tables so killing a damn dragon bat will earn you some 10mm ammo and a legendary leather armor left leg.  
---
Same ole 76.   
---
Want something new, wait for the Wastelanders expansion to add NPCs, story and a real main quest.
---
Just tried my Furious MG-42. Each consecutive bullet does not increase damage.  For example I plug a super mutant the first bullet does 21 pts damage, the next bullet does 21 pts damage, 3rd bullet 21 pts damage, etc.  NO INCREASE even though it's a consecutive hit. MG-42 furious effect broken? or just not working like I thought?
---
Eh... no I’m not. What’s the point in having them when they take way more budget then a turret? As i said, if these things are so hard to render, fine, I get it, but then don’t sell them in the atom store.
---
I figured they've done a different bag so that you can't be tricked into thinking someone died there and ambushed.
---
I named my items specially so they don't get mixed up. It helps.
---
Repair kits have zero impact; there was never a good reason to bitch about them and the fact that the game is absolutely no worse off for having them proves the point.
---
Yes, please!!
---
you're post is very vague on wether you actually want to find other players to play with, or if you want to play solo...
---
That's my fear, but I think the key difference is that Save the World wasn't very well known before the free battle royale hit.  It wasn't even an existing well known franchise.
---
Who knows, might draw more people into Adventure just to earn free Atoms for their cosmetics in NW.
---
Wait til everyone get to showcase their collection of power armors and legendary collections...
---
There's 2 other game modes where it is not only useable but upgradeable. Why should they need a disclaimer for a 1 day old trial game mode? It's only a waste if you're only playing battle royale, at which I'd say you've wasted your money on the game in the first place.
---
How do you "win", after using a repair kit? Please tell us, we'll wait.   
---
Try playing the game even once before you blindly regurgitate shit you heard on Youtube.
---
So that counts as Formal and Unstoppables costume? Hmm, might need that one just for the daily/weekly challenges.
---
I got a good rifle fully upgraded for 1 cap from vendor machine. I’m new, thanks to the trial period. I do love Fallout serie but because of negative comments, I didn’t want to buy 76 on day one (and because it’s not on steam).
---
PS. Thanks to a guy wearing Power Armour I forgot his name who took me to the first camp from halfway and supplied me some purified water.
---
Play it solo, I never felt overwhelmed by a team of 4 people, on a team though I was miffed that I wasn't getting the best gear that I could get as a solo player. As a solo player, I mostly finished in the top 10 out of matches I was in - so much for being on a team.
---
Toxic Valley and Ash Heap have upper caps as well.  It's the Savage Divide and eastward that don't.
---
I'm just taking the bait they are using as incentive, once I have what I want I'm never touching this game mode again unless they add something new I want.
---
Agree but for some reason I can't control the vertical at max...
---
Get/learn about mutations and learn what perks you need for them. It will make it a bit easier. Like with marsupial you can jump on roofs so you have the higher ground and not get hurt. Players sell them for cheap usually.
---
Also, make playing with friends easier.
---
I got a 9 point charisma card, no way I'll ever get to use it.
---
its just shiny and new , people will be over it in a month lol .... what i think it really is , all the casuals that have never tried a real BR game are finally getting a taste of it... but like all BR games most people get sick of the repetition after about a month or so....
---
I get where you're coming from, though, but I might give solo another change I guess.
---
At least they wont need to worry about losing an arm
---
Greetings, Responder!
---
I was taking pictures for weekly challenge!! :C
---
What's going on with bloodied?
---
no cutstom.ini and scan n repair didnt work, F.
---
Not necessarily. You get xp for adventure via NW as well. If you play long enough, you'll probably level up the character whether you decide to play adventure or not. You will probably still need to load into adventure from time to time to apply the points though.
---
As for amount of perk cards. You can only have a total of 7 equipped at all times. Doesn't have to be 1 per special stat. You can remove 1 from luck for example and then stack 2 cards on strength. The cards however still have to equal however many points you have assigned to that stat.
---
Not if stuff you drop combines into the same bag like it does now.
---
Works for the scorch beasts too, a team took one down and it landed on me I got the loot and killed them with it from inside.
---
I'm noticing lag in the perk menu and stash menus. I can't tell if it's tied to my CAMP budget. Which is maxed. It's near Watoga and Watoga is having a hard time loading in.
---
I’d like to see a way to get the lore of Vault 51 without doing NW. Don’t get me wrong, it’s fun, but not fun enough to rank up dozens of time just to see a terminal entry. At least not for me. 
---
I’m cool with the new mode, I’ll play it from time to time and maybe even eventually not completely suck at it—but I don’t like story content being locked behind it.
---
Yeah, I agree.  I know a lot of gamers today will choose to server hop, but there's no shame in *running away* from things you simply can't deal with in this game.
---
Trust me, the Agility perks for that will always be useful. ;)
---
I hope to be able to reach those skins before the trial ends. Not so confident tho.
---
I was never a pvp guy anyway but if I didnt miss any exclusive stuff then that's cool
---
I don't like Battle Royale games both because I'm no good at pvp and because I find them pointless. I like my games with lore and quests, and I like my enemies dumb like a brain-rotten feral ghoul, otherwise I'm not going to be able to kill it before it kills me (pretty pathetic I know lol). In fact, in other fallout games I always make myself a nice OP (usually a OHKO) gun with the CK, turn on several console commands and just enjoy the story without worrying about dying and surviving. Having to repeat pieces of the story annoys me to no end, so it's not random that my other favourite series is the Bioshock one. I still like shooting things so mods like Endless Warfare are a must for me, but in a "safe environment" when I'm a little tired of running around doing fetch quests for people.
---
Still, I'm having a lot of fun in Nuclear Winter, despite most of the time dying in the first 30 seconds of my encounter with hostiles. I like having to rely on luck to get the good loot. And I like cooperating with people. The only thing I don't like is the long having to wait a lot of time before starting the round. Especially when I die so quickly in the game.
---
All in all, I find it as a good way to break between exploration sessions.
---
This, precisely.
---
Ballgargler69 is a perfectly reasonable name for 50 year old. 
---
I think Ballgargler is a traditional Dutch surname.
---
Dumb me didn’t check my balance. Did the calculation carefully, put together a selection of one two and three star garbage legendary to make exactly 150 scrip, right when I hit the ok button I noticed my balance was already 1000. But it was too late, 150 scrips down the drain for nothing lol 🤮
---
It happens for me all the time, when in adventure ok, cause it keep me logged for hours, but in nuclear winter, every end of game is the same error.
---
Everywhere...
---
lol PVE servers been a ghost town last couple days so yeh it does kinda effect PVE , not to mention all the power armors and weapon skins etc tied to it...
---
I think if they go through with their plan of having fresh characters and "seasons" for survival (similar to Diablo 3 seasonal characters), survival could be very fun in it's own right.
---
No knife skins till I receive a handmade skin
---
Well get ready because it looks like this upcoming wastelanders dlc is going to be heavy on the pvp, having the players choose between two factions and go at each other.
---
The most powerful builds now are low health, adrenal reaction/bloodied/nerd rage builds. Guys get crazy damage bonuses.
---
Thats kinda what I mean like the current respec system is garbage, and again requires more adventure mode grinding, which is completely against just playing BR mode.  If you end up wanting to change up your spec with different cards you should beable to move points around freely.
---
Currently this is pretty dumb imo
---
Where is it documented? Link please.
---
We are all NPCs
---
Their main incentive is to not lose their player base. Releasing products in the state they did damages their public image making customers lose faith in the company. Take a look at EA, their stock has plummeted do to stunts like this. If this was not a fallout game and the price dropped drastically I would have wrote it off and probably never picked it up.
---
Yes they will probably pull this stunt again. But how much leeway do we give them? 
---
This wasn't human error this was straight corporate greed. They were testing the waters to see how minimal resources they could allocate to such a big project and watch the public's response. 
---
Again I do give credit to the team that is fixing the game but I'm not gonna praise the company for forcing them to work this way.
---
same for me
---
The sub machine gun is easily the best weapon it melts a full PA user before the clips even out.
---
I have gotten a few 5-7 kill games with it ammo also seems to be everywhere
---
And im sure you know this because your uncled friends cats dad works at bethesda.
---
If you hate them this much, why are you even here?
---
I'm seeing this, too. I can't tell if it's related to the free week or my CAMP's budget, which is maxed.
---
I've been gifting level 5 barbed All Star bats, 20 purified water, 10 disease cures, and a Nukashine. I've had the same issue too though lol I found it helps if you shoot them with the alien blaster or explosive gun and then shoot the bag so they know what's going on.
---
It’s to your benefit to have camps of teammates on different parts of the map because fast traveling among camps of teammates is free.
---
I think this is my favorite idea. The total map size is always the same, but randomly grabs a different chunk of map each time. Then each new "map" shrinks like normal.
---
I did the math on it, there is 99% chance you'll get loot after 60 drops, that means however there is 1% chance you get nothing after 60 tries.   
---
 Welcome to the elite 1%!
---
It’s already on sale rn 50% off
---
Battle Royale was a different team
---
A cheeseburger doesn't take four years to make, cost millions of dollars to create, cost under $0.01 per serving, and crash the burger joint the first time it's not delivered on time. Would you rather day 1 patches or the majority of non-EA game companies simply vanish, and/or prices to skyrocket because they have to fun all the way to completion without income?
---
The gaming industry is not the same as most luxury industries. It is risk heavy and progressively more costly to produce without meaningful increase in prices.
---
Yippee -_-
---
Combat knife yes.
---
Anything else no
---
Do it. The storm probably burns up entire teams when it starts moving if they're not paying attention anyway.
---
That since yesterday they dont. Do yourself a favor and read the notes it was fixed yesterday, and I just told you I had 1% budget left and that was not enough for a turret but for a billboard.
---
Copy paste from yesterdays notes.
---
C.A.M.P., CRAFTING, AND WORKSHOPS
---
Billboards: The amount of C.A.M.P. and Workshop budget consumed by various neon billboards has been made more consistent.
---
Not comparable to slavery no, the concept is the same.
---
Nuclear Winter was the Dallas team, different studio entirely.

Everyone is dead

what is a Streamers? is that the name of the rainbow clowns in the gay pride parade? I'm just a little ~~bi~~  bit curious. anyways WTH do they care if there is Mouse acceleration I have played this game over 1100 hours didn't even know it was a thing now it's life changing.
---
meh.. screw those flavor of the week guys anyway...
---
Have you ever played Oregon Trail? They're on the way, but they keep dying.
---
Praise the lord and pass the ammunition

Haven't made it to Virginia yet.
---
Name a single bug in Nuclear Winter. I'll wait.
---
Some heavy weapons received great buffs as well. Energy based weapons as well. My LMG hits like a tank, bloodied it’s spitting 250 damage per at like 3 bullets a second. Just sucks keeping it fed with ammo.
---
They have to walk, and they’re far away, so they won’t get here til sometime this fall.
---
This ain't CS:GO
---
There aren't any human NPCs.  They will be part of the Wastelanders update.
---
Contrary to what Polygon wrote, Wastelanders is not out yet (smh).
---
I got the free trial yesterday some guy did this for me...im comin from rdr2 so as soon as i see this guy i start having getting roped up flash backs. This guy emotes something then hands me a bag full of stuff....i bought the game right after... Thanx for the help.
---
I feel you, I don't get why people can't just leave us alone. Paid actors? You really think people who attend Bethesda's E3 are gonna pay to get in there to boo at them? There's people who genuinely like Fallout 76 and people need to get over their constant berating, it's old and it's tiring.
---
I get criticism, in fact the game deserved it at launch and still does when it comes to certain aspects but they're just being assholes.
---
Still seems like a clunky system, and again doesn't really support it being a PvP game.
---
Should beable to more easily change your points around and spec
---
I’m sure you can! What rank are you now? You’ve still got all week plus the weekend. Plenty of time if you just consistently work at it.
---
Thank you! I, evidently, have been confused.
---
squeakers can be an enthusiastic and exciting bunch if you can figure out how to wrangle em all lol
---
You make me want to download the game again. I never got a chance to play because the game broke and I couldn’t connect to online servers but I’ll download it again to see if it works and hopefully meet people like you!
---
It is a great game and highly enjoyable...Glad you like it!!
---
Go in with a team established. I haven’t had any issues on ps4
---
On this blessed day
---
Just rank up. That's really it.
---
It also shows stamina when sprinting, jumping, gun bash, heavy attack w/ melee. Also it can be used  on the NPC enemies, just not on players. E.g:mutant hound, mongrels, ghouls, etc.
---
Very well put. I feel the same way. The criticism is warranted but so is the praise.
---
Frog legs is NW only and you don’t get anti-falldamage armor
---
Too much money in it, dupers are still around. I've traded with a good amount of level 2s with like 20 of the same god tier weapons. They just keep quiet now and I think they mostly sell them for real cash to avoid being reported. Still see posts sometimes in LFG about people wanting to dupe stuff for people for caps though.
---
As the dozens of other posts have answered already:
---
Go to main menu
---
Invite to team
---
Leader starts the NW match
---
Done
---
They are still in the Capital Wasteland trying to get project purity working they'll be here in a few months
---
Yeah, a Caravan/Convoy event would be cool.
---
You’re Adventure build has no bearing on Nuclear Winter other than how many points you have in each Special. 
---
The real question is : Which end of this gun do I hit people with?
---
Lol spoke too soon, some big streamers started playing it and people are calling it garbage over every little thing.
---
You're about two hundred years off there.
---
Yeah because that’s the thing to do.
---
I’ll be the first to admit I said it sounded bad now I’m pumped for my update to finish cause I’ve only heard great things
---
They were killed on the way here.
---
Proof?

That's because it's not a PvP game. At it's core, it's PvE and it's slowly branching out into multiplayer and PvP. 
---
It's either intentionally made so you play the core game or a simple oversight. Again, this is essentially them branching out, their are bound to be mistakes. If the latter, you'll just have to give it time for them to sort things out a bit.
---
" Good job Bethesda. But under no circumstances should this be a focus for Bethesda. "  
---
Holy shit bro you could not possibly get more entitled than this.
---
I thought so but I guess I should start with the pipe weapons. my dumb ass was giving out combat rifles sheesh ... ok I'll look at it again when i get bk on. thank you both so much. I think what I'll do Is keep a few of those on hand and the armor once I spring clean the stash
---
cheapest around i guess :P, lowest ive seen is like $30 in australia not paying that much, max like $20 i already dropped $60 on the game before, dont wanna drop alot on it again
---
Thank you for the heads up

Good generalization of the builds.

I love the tour idea, you should show them the wendigo cave.

Do this on Xbox also please!!
---
There are allot of issues I've been chalking up to a Dev team being given a framework they were told was "production" so didn't check the code, why would they? Hence why so many old FO4 bugs made it in.   
---
It's inexcusable on Bethesda's part,'understandable from the new studio, and less of a deliberate attempt to screw us and more about poor communication and management.    
---
We still suffer as fans and more importantly consumers, but I don't see it as an elaborate plan to screw us..    
---
Either way they need to do better...  
---
EA is different, they've been pulling bait and switches, publishing half finished games (we can debate about Bethesda until the sun grows cold) and charging people for what should have been in the base game...
---
I don’t go that far, but I will give them a fee weapon from my store if they stop by, it’s in Flatwoods btw
---
I just watched xQc get killed and his entire chat spammed OMFG BUGGY GAME
---
Center it on the hotel not the golf club.  If the Eastern edge is just outside of the train station you are doing it right.  If there’s a camp just to the ease of the trainstation then toss the station in the mix.  Most of the cobalt flux is on the east side.
---
pricerunner ?
---
This. Use bushes, structures, sentry bots to your advantage. Enemy AI is pretty good but it’s not human after all. Whitespring ghouls for instance will gather around you if you jump on top of something like a shrub or planter, when you shoot them they will hide, if you jump back down they will come back. It takes a few back and forths to kill them all but it’s very doable. Don’t just try to outrun them on flat ground, you can’t. Use terrain and observe what they do. 
---
From level 5-15 are the hardest imo. After 25 it becomes easier. When level up my 2nd character last week I got to level 50 but was still using level 30 weapons to fight level 60 ghouls.
---
You might not, but I definitely do
---
you can equip what your stats will bear.. you can only have 7 tota in winterl.. 
---
you can put them all in perception if you have enough pts and cards unlocked to do so...
---
I want all that too, but it had a set announced date, that came and went. those others (at least to my knowledge) did not.
---
Ok then that’s the case for the signs, but not for the billboards. And i read the patchnotes, but don’t read every single follow up they’re posting. Then I could edit my initial post and just mention the billboards, because my little mothman sign alone had the camp budget of approximately 2 turrets.
---
What do you mean? I have seen nothing in the BR that is building bases during fights
---
My favorite gamertag I have seen is CummyDiarrhea. Don't know how he (she?) gets away with it lol. Worst part... I only saw it because that person sent a friend request to my wife!
---
It's been months since I was low enough level that I was scrounging for ammo in the forest, but I seem to recall most of the low level scorched dropping .45, 10mm, shotgun shells, and occasionally .308. 
---
Also, you can craft much higher quantities of 50cal for the same amount of mats vs .308, and the damage is higher than a hardened receiver, so all in all it seemed like a good upgrade.
---
That actually sounds pretty cool.
---
You can't.  It's in the exclusion zone. 
---
Morgantown and Charleston are fair game, however.
---
Same boat. I bought a mic just for this game. Guess what? I kinda like it. It is still VERY anonymous.  On PC, only saw 1 "jerk" in 760+hours. Everyone in the local area teamed up and chased him off the server. 
---
Most of the time, if you cross paths in the wild, almost everyone will give the "wave" emote and keep it moving. 
---
There is also a huge single player component. Most of the playtime for me has been solo, building up equipment and ammo for those reckless wastes of ammo called events. A queen run easily east up a days gathering in 15 minutes.
---
Hope it helps!
---
i think it already is running on the  Radeon, is it not?

I placed the clean billboards, so I guess the mothman ones are still bugged. West Virginia ones too?
---
&gt; or discovering Grafton dam
---
Yes 100000000X this
---
Actually, they should make outfits work like in regular game modes, so they go over armor. But your suggestion is also would be a good addition to customization. My friend wasted 700 atoms for this purpose and was disappointed.
---
I watched Grimmmz last night and his chat was loving it
---
*Grin*
---
Just make sure all team members are on the main menu when u invite
---
Go into controls and find "toggle always run" for pc it's" /" they changed the controls for br mode
---
I wouldn't mind playing with others. Not actively searching for others to play with. More than likely going to start off solo and go from there. Sorry, i had a long and rough day so I probably didn't word everything exactly how I wanted to word it.
---
It's definitely affecting PC users too.
---
mine doesn't feel empty, just incomplete.
---
Hey I cant download it for free on ps4?
---
I’m on PS4 as well.
---
You on ps4
---
Dead or evacuated*
---
Uh... you might want to recheck. I easily had 1/8th of my camp budget free before the patch. But I logged in today and my budget is maxed. So I scrapped about 5 things in my camp and my budget did not move one bit. Confused on how I could still be maxed after scrapping 5 objects, I did some research and found out that the billboards, signs and neon lights had their budget quota increased. 
---
If you already had Billboards, neon lights and signs in your camp, and were close to max budget, then your budget will be maxed
---
Trench warfare my dude.make those shottys useful
---
If you look past all the DOGSHIT bugs and TERRIBLE balancing, its great!
---
Ron Perlman was wrong. War does change and it has just begun. Dark times are upon us. The desperate battle royale cash grab attack is here. Fallout may never be the same ever again. The battle royale kids and/or nerds are flooding in like World War Z. 
---
We can only pray that Elder Scrolls and Star Field won't go down with it. 
---
Into exile, I must go. Failed, I have.
---
Ugh noooooo!  I rolled a new character to use my Bloodied 25 Ultracite Gatling Laser I got from the Purveyor and am this close to leveling up to 45 to start using it.  Hope these issues get addressed else this is gonna be super annoying to deal with.

I got that, and was immediately buggered by a literal hacker (doing one of those "Jump X feet per second" BS moves, watched the rest of the match and at one point they magically went up what I know is an impossible straight line incline by the big bridge). Kinda PO'ed, sniping is my thing.
---
I gave away my 9 mutton pie plans to everyone since I couldn’t sell them for 10 caps
---
For me I want to place a bunch of monster parts like Scorchbeast bits/ Neurotoxic Dust, and Teddy Bears!
---
My favorite part of Fallout 76 is that Bethesda is actually addressing problems and fixing them, and is actively trying to improve the game and isn’t leaving it to the mod community to fix stuff like people said they would
---
I think mics are set to default off when joining NW. I use mine in adventure and the same keybind doesnt work when i switch over to NW..  ill see if changing it during NW mode works
---
Question for you, does the Stabilized perk work for Gatling Lasers?
---
You played on others?? I've only been in the forest area surrounding Flatwoods
---
I read somewhere on this sub that it's confirmed broken by the latest patch. Really sucks as I'm pretty sure a number of people saw this coming with the latest patch notes and changes to VATS. I know I saw people asking if this would be effected, sure enough it just doesn't work now.
---
More original than most, and thanks for dutch history tidbit!
---
Is this Pete's or Todd's alt?
---
Thanks didnt know they had dates. Thought it was like Easter
---
Not sure. It's not what's connected to the monitor or TV it's what windows is useing as the primary card. That's why I said to disable the onboard one
---
r/gaming was making fun of bethesda for all the stuff their fixing... so much hate
---
I think that Camp Lewis *is* the Pioneer Scout Camp.  It confused me as well.
---
Yes, forgot to mention the west virginia ones but those 2 (or 4 with the small ones) still taking massive budget place. Atleast the signs are good now, tested it too! I hope they fix the billboards in another patch/hotfix again.
---
I agree, it's ironic; and I'm "enjoying" the hell out of debating it only to find out they've not tried it... Or '76
---
That’s it, it’s been renamed but when you go there, there are signs to say camp Lewis
---
Camp lewis is another name for the pioneer scout camp
---
Why was this disliked xD
---
it’s the same place
---
No. What are you gunna do about it?
---
Also helps its a team-win game instead of a "last one standing" game. That said, I have noticed a definite decline in team member quality each night around 5pm EST. Sudden upswing in rambos without mics doing the traditional "reeeeeeeee" charge against, at one point, EIGHT people. I mean, really, mate? Really?
---
 I noticed in your screenshots you have a medium loot box stash skin, where do you find that? I have all three skins unlocked but I can only find the small loot box skin
---
Its faster to kill aim vats again then gun fu ever was. But ya its known issue right now
---
It is something that they are aware of the issue and plan on addressing it in an upcoming patch.
---
Excellent work OP, first thing these players are seeing is other community members go above and beyond for complete strangers. 
---
Basically, you're providing everyone with a great first experience - kudos!
---
Ironically many of the people who damnit it are now playing it, because it's fun..
---
That should happen if you nuke the same area from multiple silos
---
Yes. Weird that the new one takes so little budget, its nice for you guys to know if you like having billboards and maximizing budget. Plaster it with Mothman Posters.
---
Honestly, i thought it was going to suck. I stand corrected, it's turned out to be amazing.
---
Technically you don't have to play adventure mode. You just have to allocate your special there. You get adventure mode xp in NW.

Nerf one of the best weapons in the game because your squad didn’t know how to fight it. Bethesda better pay attention.
---
same for me.  all my furious heavies, same number (lmg, gat, gat plasma)
---
I did warn you about taking the red pill.
---
Despite not really caring for BR, I do enjoy seeing more people. Especially on PS4. I’ve helped out a few.
---
I think they should've made a new vault suit for this occasion, Fallout 4's in black. Call it the Vault 51 Stealth Suit.
---
Wait till you meet the insult bot.
---
Glad to know I'm not the only one that was effected by this.
---
I'll have to search out the subreddits you referred to for more info, I did a cursory search, but appear to have failed as I wouldn't have kicked up a new post if I saw something.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I didn't want it either, but I wasn't against the desicion. I just wasn't interested. Now I'm actually really glad they decided to go for it, cause it's a great PvP experience in a game that needed one. 
---
Also, leaving a game because you didn't want them to add an optional mode is silly. Hope the success of Nuclear Winter gets people to calm their circlejerking for a while. Criticism and opinions are fine, but raging about it for months on end has gotten so old.
---
I know. Dude had a .50 mg and marine armor. Could you leave me some sort of weapon, bro? Me and another teammate basically went kamakazi with our fists when we got cornered. I almost downed my target before their buddy pegged me one. They and their buddy retreat to heal up, and mr .50... just walks by me. Away from the wounded targets.
---
fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
---
Like I've said to the other guy who made this post PSA: nobody wants to fucking talk to you
---
We're gonna lose cause there's no coordination.
---
Bloodbug.
---
You are probably mistaken. Early on the rank up rewards show icons for the stash caches. They are just that, player icons for decorating your profile. The actual Camp items come later on in the higher ranks and you can definitely tell the difference in the reward picture.
---
Yes I'm not surprised - Todd seems to have a hard on for PvP.  They'll alienate their  core audience in exchange for newbies who'll get bored and move on to something else over time.
---
So long as it doesn't take over Fallout. Also, I'm going to wait until they make updates to it.
---
Doesn't turning auto fill off allow you to do both of those things ? i've not tried the solo thing, but If you team on the menu then join, thats who you go in with, if you turn auto fill off you can then do that with a team of 3 or w/e and not get a random. It's also persistant, so if you all Z out, you can join a new game as a team without having to re-team.
---
Or better yet, make them recoverable, or a damaged cannon ball, because they would be!
---
I am having the same problem. Though there is a small thread on this on the official forums where all of us are brainstorming trying to fix this.
---
Weird had the exact oposite experience logged in after the patch with free budget. And if you did some research the most recent info is that they fixed the neon billboards were fixed just yesterday. 
---
OP replied and as I tested a clean billboard and he tested the mothman and WV billboards the ones he tested are still bugged and take up more budget than a turret and the new billboard that I tested does not. Lets just hope they fix the old ones.
---
I think this is only a beta. It’s not the full release of nuclear winter and vault 51
---
Well having binged 400 comics over the past evening/morning/afternoon, Alpha/Peabody must be protected at all costs.

Suck my unit
---
I've enjoyed it but the extra load screens and the wait kinda suck. 
---
Like the fact that you don't have to play as part of a team, 'cause, frankly, I am the albatross around their neck. So it goes.
---
Most low level scorched are using pipe pistols (308)/bolt actions (308)/revolvers (45), hunting rifles (308), shotguns (shells) and occasionally 10mm pistols (10mm) which are 308s, 45s, shells and 10mm
---
EA isn't always to blame, for example Anthem.. Bethesda had a good solid plan for fixing the game, improved communication, patch notes, road map.. within 3 months they had all that and started with new content shortly after.
---
Anthem on the other hand, published an unfinished game, worsened communication, took down the road map maybe for good, and spent pretty much the entire third month the game was out with total radio silence. It has not improved since, other than a public test server for future content that's underwhelming and no one wants the way it is.
---
And EA isn't to blame for any of that, that's all Bioware. Don't get me wrong, EA sucks..
---
But Anthem made me feel a hell of a lot better about Bethesda and what they've been actively trying to do. And the community (here) really reflects that difference in a huge way. A much more positive way.
---
Where did u see the rewards for each level posted... I’ve been looking for a while
---
You should be able to find it again same thing happened to me.
---
It's a glitch that BGS have been made aware of. To be fair they normally break a lot more so it's progress in a way.

Frown and pout

Then ply solo

It also weighs a staggering 1.1LB, which could be replaced instead with a stimpack.
---
Nope. Not gonna talk or listen to people I don't want to. Especially demanding ones 
---
Play with your friends or get used to quiet time.
---
Well you can wear atomic shop outfits with the exception of the black ops underarmour. My guess is they took into account that black outfits would be harder to spot and removed the ability to wear them. Kinda sucks since I own that outfit.

Yep, that's cost me a few deaths... Oh shit is the Grognak's axe in 3 or 6?? Boom....
---
This new BR is nothing more than a fancy event.  They could easily have added it in the same way they did arkos or sheepsquatch. Doing it this way just makes it instantly available to new players. I grumbled about "fornite 76" myself. Would you complain if the same exact thing was added with a yellow hex instead of a yellow rectangle?
---
Yeah it happened to me the first time I got in a team with my brother. But just that once. I had to exit the game as well.
---
Bigger streamers tend to be way more toxic and have toxic chats
---
I really hope it’s a bug, I really liked having my Mothman neons but they aren’t feasible anymore. 
---
They really need to put something in the atom store that shows the percentage of the budget the item takes up for future purchases
---
No? Get over yourself
---
Thank you FO76 reddit community for the blazingly fast replies!
---
I tend to solo this game due to being a dad that can only play once the kids go to bed with the mic. on mute, so getting a community response so quickly makes me like this game, and the folks who play it even more!
---
Much appreciated!
---
Rank 20 is a “boiler/water” room with one-way windows looking out at the boxing ring.
---
Rank 30 goes to a balcony that overlooks the stage/theater.
---
Seems odd, isn't the point to *not* see people?
---
Unless the two minuts of waiting are greatly cut down, I think just seeing them flying around would be enough.
---
Did you get it working? I'm on X Box and mine also stopped displaying interaction prompts when I was next to a player, just started happening this week.
---
Yes, I like it.
---
I’ve only found one person who had a mic turned on during NW. And they were watching some fucking top 10 video for GTA through his headset. No more communication with my time
---
It’s not a bug it’s so you can tell how much armor someone has no one is downvoting you because FaNbOYs MAd so just chill
---
You'll still be placed in a team.
---
yeah im pretty sure it is
---

---
Maybe try having some friends lmfao
---
Played a few matches, but then ran into this issue and  currently on restart #4...
---
I paid $80 for it, I paid for the right to bitch about it as much as I want to.
---
I tried logging in after the E3 announcement and it crashed, just like every session before that.
---
It’s not a bug get your head out of your ass
---
You are correct about how the game views objects, it's all the same to it. This allows some weird things like a bug where an enemy attack would put that attacks special effect (the actual special effect graphic that plays) into your inventory, like how arrows can end up in your inventory.
---
Going to take you a lot of matches
---
Hmmmmm yep i'll accept that one.
---
You get banned? Lol
---
Actually I dont wanna lose with someone who can't even use the emotes to tell me if they have a mic.
---
I think the reason the server seems pretty stable is because of all the loading screens preventing several different matches to happen at once, that can cause instability especially if something’s in beta
---
You cannot join while they are playin , everybody need to be in main menu and create a team
---
is that a Confirm or not Sure response ?
---
Generally new codes are out within a day for at least one silo
---
It's was planned from the start.
---
Can't you only team up in game though? Not at the menu?
---
I played like 10 rounds with varying levels of success, finally got placed onto a good team for once and we made it very far. When there were 8 people left, all 4 people on my team were alive still. We finally got to the point where the remaining area was really small, 4 people were left alive including me and two other people on my team. We were about to finish off the last opponent when the server disconnected.
---
Not gonna lie, it is kinda fun. That left me with a bad taste though. I will keep playing for now and see how I feel after I have won a few times.
---
Are you talking about the stealth boy cool off period when you spawn in?  Or the countdown before you exit the vault to the match?  I think it would be cool if after you load into the match from the vault, there are vertibirds in the sky flying to outside the ring of fire, just to suggest you got dropped off and they are exiting the battle area.
---
My only fight with a Flatwoods Monster was when it was being controlled by a Mothman, never teleported away. Guess that’s extremely rare
---
Sire but moat of the reviews did not exactly give a shit about facts.  Bashing the game got you views so thats what they did.
---
I think that would look better, but I'm pretty sure the bag looking the way it has have saved its contents a few times
---
Go to social in the main menu and then you should see your friends list invite your friend to your team wait for them to accept then click on nuclear winter and your set
---
Had a team member like this. He was downed and I waited for him to die and the rest of the team divided up his loot. He was a jerk.
---
Think of the BR as the game at launch. Hate on it before they get to try it and then they like it
---
I've been testing it as well and it only takes a few max size blueprints to start lagging the servers. I felt the need to test my hypothesis myself and was able to actually crash the servers twice by using max sized blueprints.
---
They need more skins in general, not just knife skins and skins that you can actually find in game, not just shit on the atomic shop.
---
I agree. Development will be taken away from the base game. PVP will become the focus if they can make money from it.
---
No, you can't.
---
Lol uuuhh what is it then?
---
Maybe one was me, I really enjoy this game thus far. The core of what I like from Fo4 is there (exploration, crafting, etc. ). I’m a bit of a loner so I generally avoid people right now.
---
What? Your post? Wasn't me but probably because this has been asked dozens of times in dozens of posts today alone and every single one of them has been answered with the answer I left.
---
Search is fantastic and helps to prevent down votes.
---
I dunno then consider me a hater then lol.
---
Most of the bugs I truly didn't mind but there were those I did.
---
The server resets. The changes made that affected how you've set things up to that point that now ruin everything you've worked towards. I mean you can't just easily choose new perk cards after you've run it in a certain direction and Bethesda changes the one thing that you valued that took you there.
---
I mean I'm fucked up cause I'll have to now play double the hours to change the perk cards to a different mode of playing? Maybe I refuse to mindlessly grind that out simply because Bethesda didn't give me the option it should've when they fucked my mode of playing over.
---
I lost most of my will to play this game BECAUSE of those changes they made that nullified my play style. I'm in like a useless purgatory until I can change enough cards out. Many others are in the same boat.
---
I mean they banned players using loopholes instead of fixing the loopholes lol. That's after millions left due to the crashing and bugs.
---
If you're over the hate good but this game was a monumental fuck up and I'll never buy a Bethesda game again until I have seen a go by where the reviews and publisher goodwill are known.
---
The wait-in-the-Vault wait time. Seeing them around after spawning in the world is cool, but if that Vault wait time is cut down then we could get the typical get-on-board-and-jump-when-you-are-ready thing.
---
Bellular is really awful at the clickbaity titles.
---
There was one thumbnailed "Insane Conditions/Bethesda Plagiarism" with a Pic of Todd Howard titled "The Sad Reality of AAA hell, Bethesda tax Fallout 76 players and caught plagarizing!"
---
It was 5 minutes about Bethesda: One of their European studios plagarized something for a marketing item and already apologized and were taking care of it.  He then explained taxes were a normal thing in most online games to cut down inflation.
---
The AAA hell part was about Mortal Kombat developers getting PTSD from research to make the fatalities realistic.  Most of the video was about this rather serious issue, and not one bit of thumbnail or title mentioned Mortal Kombat!  How can I take this person seriously ever again? 
---
There have been other videos where he puts out something really clickbaity and then quite can't bring himself to outright lie.
---
I know, im just tring to throw out some ideas to make the full release better. Not that its bad, just some ideas i had.
---
I had a thought thia morning. FO76 may become a one-stop game; by that, I mean it could be possible to play any game in a single game. Got a CTF itch? Gotta hop in a BR? Maybe TDM, or a gun game. Hell, they could really open the floodgates and do tower defense, payloads, and so much more. Really, the only thing I can think of that's not possible at the moment is racing.
---
Switch between the 2. 
---
3rd for information 
---
1st for Fighting
---
Ya there's already 3 combat knife skins, two of which are just retextures of the oldest release so please enough with the knives.
---
How have people not figured out shooting at you does nothing anymore? Are they hoping you accidentally shoot them back? I actually don't get it 😂
---
That's a frustrating quest as it is. 
---
Sorry about your bad luck. 
---
Generally it takes a couple of days after a big update before a patch is available that helps with the server drops.
---
Uh... Every game is packed for me.
---
I think the servers broke because I’m stuck loading too
---
Ya, I found it funny those threatening to leave.
---
I just commented I had no interest in it and would never play it.
---
We are all eating our words now, lol.
---
If I had friends I wouldn’t be sitting at home playing Fallout. You insensitive asshat. 😭
---
It's a video game and I don't want to talk to you. You obviously suck. Give me one good reason why on earth I would want to talk to you
---
thank you.
---
for real? i have been playing non stop with no wait time, also im kinda shocked about the stability. no crashes or freezes as of yet. what do you play on? maybe try restarting?
---
The "fix" yesterday you speak of is what is causing the bug. I did do research and the patch notes don't say anything about DECREASING the budget of the neon billboards and instead states that the budget for the neon billboards has been made more consistent. That could mean they increased the budget.
---
Now as a former video game tester, I can say its clear the budget of the neon billboards were tweaked with patch 10... That tweaking is what has caused the budget increase. Im willing to bet my savings on it. Not sure if the increase was intentional, but the fact remains.
---
The patch notes does not state anything was "fixed" when regarding the budget of neon billboards... Only that they have been adjusted... Which is the origin of the over budget bug.
---
It might be broken for you- I haven’t had to wait at all :( try to close the game entirely and rejoin
---
Its a pretty small portion of the map and it kinda verifies they they have to identify problems before they can fix them. Were at patch 10 and they games running petty smooth!
---
It's bugged. A bunch of us on the forums are trying to figure out why this is happening.
---
I’m playing right now with fill off and have not been placed on a team https://imgur.com/gallery/L9U0NVm
---
No NPCs because they were hoping they could do the goddamn *bare minimum* and people would build the game for them, essentially, by being each other's NPCs when, quite frankly, most people aren't... Going to do that??? They stripped away pretty much anything to do but shoot things, and especially what people play Fallout for.
---
I played it and won my first game, was awesome!
---
But even a game like ESO didn't launch like ESO. It had a rough launch too.
---
So did GTA Online, that one Final Fantasy game, Diablo 3, WoW... Seems like online launches are rough.
---
You get xp in Nuclear Winter too. You just have to go into Adventure to do the level up.
---
Same. I’ve never really had good experiences with *really* high level players, they’re usually just dicks.
---
I'm in your boat when it comes to Adventure mode. I personally hate getting sidelined by, in my opinion, stupid shit like BR modes. I've personally always despised the BR genre, but I won't impede on what other people want to play. As long as most of the skins make their way to the Atomic Shop at some point...
---
Obligatory mobile  post notification
---
Thanks, I’ll try
---
Fetchez la vache!
---
Good counter points, I'm still going to hold EA accountable because it's not the first time they've had major issues or similar scandals. ;).  
---
Anthem is a good counter example, had the inverse of '76, nearly all positive hype, ironically pre-full release they were directly compared..   
---
Post launch.. Well
---
There is no Season Pass for this game.  All dlc is free.  All future dlc will be free too, if Bethesda keeps to their word.
---
Me and a friend have needed some help when it comes to making a camp and having a steady source of materials/ammo, is there anyone on PC that can help us?
---
My username is Warcraftdad1972
---
There is no season pass all dlc is free
---
Oooo that would be cool too.  Show your character (and team?) jumping into a vertibird and strapping in, then you are displayed the map to choose where you want to spawn.  They don't even have to build a transition from flying vertibird to jumping out to parachuting down, just put the pieces into place to build the scene.  Vault &gt; get on Vertibird &gt; spawn location, with Vertibirds flying around leaving the drop zone.  I think all of that could be accomplished without any drastic changes to the existing game systems.
---
But I like taping the glass, the shark only broke it once.
---
I had this same idea But every I encountered didn't want one, I'm glad you stand up and help everyone like this tho, you're a great person Man
---
Yeah we figured it out together lol. Yesterday I checked reddit and some posts mentioned all neon related objects taking away more budget, then I scrapped some signs first and didn’t go down, just with the mothman sign. So I thought I was on 130% or something before I scrapped the mothman sign, glad that this isn’t the case I can at least hang some signs on my walls again.
---
Woah Woah Woah Woah Woah you says and i quote you **'free to play event going'** 
---
there is currently a free to play event right now or whatt ? if yes to Question how long is this free to play event ?
---
You only drop your junk in adventure mode, just don't carry so much junk friend.
---
Which one is interloper? Don't recall seeing it. I tend to collect the tales holotapes so I would have bought it anyways lol
---
Google it,
---
Yea I'd be fine with delays if the content comes out in tip-top shape. They kind of seem more suited to Wastelanders as well, though I think it might not be too healthy if they avoid any major PVE content over the entire summer. 
---
Perhaps they could counterbalance by adding more events like Fasnacht.
---
Another filthy raider. Preston Garvey would be disappointed. ;)
---
Hell yeah! It worked lol
---
Nope just there, it's not great but it is beta I guess so...
---
I just checked out his stream and he seems to be enjoying it, I guess. Hard to tell though because holy fucking shit I think I got cancer just sitting in his stream for 10 minutes. I imagine his demo is mainly preteens or something because I just don't get how people can stand it.
---
Lol, I used that splitter til I broke down and bought my wireless set
---
Oh nice! I one more question... E3 said they are adding human NPCs what does that mean?
---
okay thanks for some clarification... yeah its my first BR.  just something strange about it, coming from months of sophisticated game play to be stuck in a vault with no armor or weapons, punching each other for almost no damage.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Interloper
---
Unless you’re fighting an angry shark it’s pretty much useless as a weapon
---
Considering how happy I was when Automatron landed for Fallout 4, adding a Robot Workbench in Fallout 76 would be mindblowing.
---
Those perks are just for that mode, next time your in that mode you can then open it before your placed on the map
---
You can't actually play them after your membership ends - you need to have am active membership to play any plus monthly games
---
That happened to me because I hit the 1k scrip max
---
If you're talking about the tricentennial edition it's just a few extra skins. maybe some free atoms to buy skins too. Either version will get you the full game with all the DLCs.
---
Yo this is amazing!!
---
i do wish i had more time to explore the vault.  Its hard to do that in 2min!
---
It has mounts and pets, but I seem to recall that they didn't do anything in combat when I played ESO. I could be wrong about that, as it's been awhile since I've played it.
---
No, everyone has the same hitbox regardless of size
---
Bethesda will be selecting 300 people at random in the United States and trapping their souls in an alien artifact discovered on Mars.  They will then upload their souls onto the main servers.  They will be available for the playerbase to torment as we see fit, damned to live out the rest of their days as part of a post-apocalyptic simulation.
---
Cool ty
---
I would but all I make are random fart noises when I hit something.
---
he's enjoying it because it's so bad, is what he said.
---
Which I think basically just means he is somewhat having fun but can't say he's having fun because people will make fun of him
---
Sadly it's not all of them i just goes to rank 18(can't find the post), and some guy rank 20 talked about rewards and other things 
---
And there are datamined items that seem like rewards that people haven't seen yet plus the player icons and the photo frames,oh boy that a lot of ranks we gotta earn
---
If you go into the atomic shop and go to the skins section, you will find it if you scroll down until you see one that says 'Owned.' If you want to use it ingame, you have to favourite it. Once you favourite a skin, whenever you pick up any corresponding weapon (or etc.) it will convert to that skin.
---
Yeah! Amazing job, man. This IS feeding the noobs- but if you don't eat, you'll starve. Feed the noobs, friends, and teach them how to war.
---
you are probably sharing inspirational level 3 which is a decent boost for a low level (just a guess, but if now why?!)
---
it seems to be a total of both, lots of pending requests cause lag/stuttering. having a big FL does it aswell
---
Same, now it's like crack. I must find out the secret of vault 51, why is there only 1 survivor, why is it going on, why were half the population locked DOWNSTAIRS I NEED ANSWERS GOD DAMN IT
---
As of right now the only humans you encounter in the game are other players but by the fall they will add NPCs or Non player characters to be exact
---
Farming legendarys is easy tho. There is that leader of the pack event. And there are a fair few low level legendary locations in the forest.
---
&gt;Hey Settler, Preston Garvey Here.  I have a favor to ask.  "*A month ago, there were twenty of us. Yesterday there were eight. Now, we're five.*" Would you mind navigating around the Nuclear Winter to find the missing settlers?
---
Yo dawg, we heard you like nuke zones so we put a nuke zone in your nuke zone!
---
I want to play a game of NW but I’m busy setting my shop up because I chose NOW to do this
---
Happy hunting. 
---
I've seen him near the mole miners and right near the forest edge but it's always south of the node
---
Go to nukacrypt website.
---
They post them every week. 😎
---
Dont tell people that God damn it
---
Is the blue camo skin at level 15 different to the Winter wasteland they put in the shop for 1200 atoms ?
---
Props to you for putting yourself out and soliciting honest feedback. I’ve been playing since day one, and have had nothing but overwhelmingly positive experiences dealing with other players. In all my hundreds of hours of playing, only one bad egg ever. Even this was in the very early days.
---
I prefer playing solo, playing with strangers is simply not my thing. I’ve had a handful of voice conversations with others, and everyone has been pleasant and positive. Most of them have been about complimenting each other on our camps or joking around during events.
---
Most of my interactions with others has been through emails, mostly waving as we pass each other by. So bottom line, my experience is it’s entirely up to you how much you choose to engage or not engage with other players. You can certainly start out keeping to yourself and dip your toes in whenever you feel ready. Hopefully you’ll have as positive an experience as I have.
---
I’m on PC, otherwise I’d love to join you for a game and help show you around. Good luck in your adventures!
---
As soon as your in the world you have to ring loot crates, they have the weapons &amp; armor
---
I usually play lagfree aside from the FL induced one at ultra :) My rig is good and so is my connection!
---
As i mentioned in the OP the issue only happens on my main account with the big friendlist and the other one with a small one is 100% lagfree. It has something to do with the social tab, i have a few mates who had similar issues so its pointing towards the scale of it being the cause.
---
Do you experience any lag when opening your FL at all, and when was your account created? most of us having the issue have played since the B.E.T.A on PC.
---
Search for containers and loot them. You will find ammo, weapons, armor and chems there.
---
Then just... try to survive!
---
I do the same. I’ll make a 10mm pistol, drop 50 rounds of 10mm, 1 stim, 1 radx, 1 radaway, 5 purified water, 5 nuka quantum. I wave like crazy til they take the goodies, give them the thumbs up, and fast travel so they can begin their journey!!!    🤠
---
Bye bye mire.
---
You can safely just leave the game, no need to move the camp
---
And Adventure Mode is a ghost town. It's like an actual apocalypse in there.
---
Relax, bro.  Take a breath.
---
No not at all. Your camp will log off with you and be in the same place next time you log into a new server.
---
did you know the guy who challenges danarys champion in GOT is shouting "your mother is a hamster" and all the rest in valeryian?
---
Yeah. Watch the area in 3rd person. Can hide completely inside one. Unless someone points at you, youre golden
---
I am glad!
---
Thank you that worked.
---
You can just log out. It will be there when you log back in.
---
If only they had a single player fallout...
---
Careful with those emotes - I've been able to track down a few people thanks to seeing them emote
---
Each one is a different tier and has a different look, higher tier has more defense and more weight to it. The BoS combat armor has the best stats.
---
Also have them locked if dropped on death, anyone who isn't the owner gets a bounty for trying to loot it!
---
I seem to remember ESO having its own issues at launch.....
---
Really? That's... disappointing.
---
You craft it in a armor workbench
---
If you mean in NW you can’t. If you mean in the regular game you can craft it in the armor menu.
---
Ah yes, the old landmine-under-the-wounded trick that the Legion loves to use.
---
From the 10th to the 17th I think.
---
This is fantastic ♥️ I have been trying for about 2 hours to give new people free stuff and not ONE of them has either understood me or taken up on the trade offer. A little frustrating lol but next time maybe I'll turn on voice. I want to help but also want to avoid pestering those "hard mode" lone wolf players too!
---
Check ALL containers including dressers, cabinets, etc. you’ll find better gear in the crates that are shown in the vault but you can still find something serviceable elsewhere. 
---
Stick close to your team if possible, strength in numbers.
---
Your post. The post I responded to was -2 karma lol.
---
&gt;You’re Adventure build has no bearing on Nuclear Winter other than how many points you have in each Special.
---
Yeah that's my concern because I have 12 points in Strength and I imagine gameplay currently favors guns which is largely Perception based.
---
It’s atom shop items not NW in game rewards. The boys are stash skins
---
It’s an *m*mo, a mediumly multiplayer game, not an mmo! ;)
---
ill have you know my ass is dummy thicc and alerts other players
---
Murdering noobs at workshops has become pretty fun again.
---
Bless u
---
It’s always funny when people that are used to aim assist don’t have it anymore and complain.
---
Why would you want to be alone vs multiple teams though?
---
Surely it's better to have a silent random team compared to no team at all
---
Robot Workbenches are already in the game courtesy of Wild Appalachia’s Lying Lowe questline so I have a bit of money on Robot companions being the most likely
---
True. I didn’t even hear any confirmation about my list ever happening
---
Don't know then. Babies who didn't realize it was that easy and mad they didn't know this?
---
Yeah not true for me either. cleared the vendor and got my script the three severs I went on were packed. What system are you on? (Xb1)
---
How would it work in the Savage Divide though?
---
A lot of people are going to be playing the mode that just came out. It's not really evidence of anything.
---
👍👍
---
Ehh, then come to the fight. Bring it on. Dang it I died.
---
wholly ***** :D'
---
so this free event progress carry over if i decide to buy or whatt ?
---
Thank you! I guess I forgot that you start off with 1 in every stat and not with a build like fallout 4. Like I said it's been awhile. I appreciate your help!
---
I just want to be able to choose to stay with my previous squad.
---
Found one by random that we all kicked ass together, but wasn’t able to choose to continue with them afterwards.
---
Yes actually I did some testing on it, swig speed on rippers and buzz blades only effects the ‘swing speed’ aka the speed at which you power attack or you put down the weapon, not the ‘attack speed’ which for those weapons you hold down the attack button to attack.
---
War never changes
---
Thank you. I know 99% of people are great people but my brain only wants to focus on that negative 1% interaction that Ive experienced. I'm planning on buying it for steam as well afterwards just for different experiences. Getting it updated tonight hopefully and jumping in. Cheers!
---
Yes. Everything carries over if you buy, and if you decide to, it's half off too, I believe.
---
Then it's bugged. I've left mine off and still placed I'm a team. Ranging from 2-4.
---
Shadowed leather armor with no under armor on and the leather hat?  You look like a proper leather daddy.  
---
It was my go to attire for Fasnacht parades.
---
I've read that it should be pretty dope tho.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/QuSj617.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QuSj617.jpg) NO BLOOM, compare
---
Don't forget.
---
Don't hoard ammo for mini nukes and missiles. They weigh a ton.
---
So I can run like a store and people come up to me etc? Is not that kinda boring not moving
---
So tired of gaming hipsters getting triggered by a game mode so this is a refreshing change.
---
Melee is beast in NW. I run incisor and the attack speed one and run 20% faster with melee out. I two hit people it’s great.
---
I did the same thing earlier on Xbox. I was looking on the map trying to figure out where I wanted to go and I saw a mass of level 2’s at the vault door. I fast traveled there with my x-01 on and everyone was just staring at me and giving me the thumbs up emote and then I flipped on my mic and said welcome to Appalachia follow me. All but one person followed me. I gave them all a set of pocketed leather armor, a pipe rifle with a lot of ammo and then gave them food and water. In escorted them to The overseers camp for them to get started and then to Flatwoods where they could start the responders stuff. After they were done with that I took them to various places around the forest to help them get levels and then helped each one set up a their camp. It was fun. Hopefully some of the new players will buy the game. I missed seeing the Vault with new people flowing out of it.
---
I really hope you get to connect because it's actually really awesome
---
Well that's my first, thanks for the gold!
---
Dope or not, if there's no one in AU/NZ playing, then the ones who do want to play in that region are boned either way.
---
Ahhh. Good looking out. Its blue camo for the 44.
---
First time I’ve ever given one, you’re welcome!
---
Well, no, I know this because I have eyes ... and like I have a memory longer than a goldfish. This is the same unhealthy thing they pulled at Fallout 76's unveiling at E3 2018. 'Real-time' footage of basically a staged, meaningless machinima video of players running in neat-o 'action' shots, then a photoshopped vague target. And then, most importantly, strategically lying by omission. 'Cause you can't be taken to court for the expectation and hype fans filled in at the exact spots you implied them to.  
---
[Oh wow! Look at all these ambiguous features!](https://youtu.be/_N2ekYBda_Y) These will all go amazing with the whole goddamn Fallout 4 level of polished roleplaying game underneath that you're implying exists right? I mean, if that wasn't the case you wouldn't do something as crazy as to leave that out, right? Because you understand the definition of lying by omission is and how it would leave lots and lots of fans angry right? Right Bethesda? Right!?

And yeah, ooh yeah I hate this game so much like a bile in my gut. I hate it so much? That's why I took Todd's plea to come back to the game this E3 earnestly to heart, re-installed it after a six-month hiatus, and played it this weekend as a wholehearted attempt to get over my biases and see if the game 'got good'.

No, it is not hate. It's regret and disappointment. Disapointmentment that I let myself get tricked for like the sixth time with this game, and regret that my two hours of playtime are now going to be used in Todd's bullshit player count numbers in his E3 2020 conference.
