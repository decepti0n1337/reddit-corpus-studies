The recent patch made ash piles buggy.  Before the patch, I used to run Uranium Fever or Line in the Sand and there'd be piles everywhere with no dips in FPS.  Now, ash piles are creating some strange pixellated graphics glitch that kills FPS.  This is most visible in Uranium Fever.  Trust me, go into Uranium Fever and kill things with a tesla to see what i'm talking about.  Others have posted about it too.

Agree that the game is way too easy in the end-game right now, but I never said anything about making the game easier? It's more for the lore/company/experience!

Hi there, this Bethesda, if you give us your credit card information, we will see what we can do for you! We can't make any promises üòâ but we will charge your credit card periodically from time to time. 
---

---
This is a very good üëç request but unfortunately üòï we are a company that values your money üí∞ more than your request. 
---
I apologize for being a  smart ü§ì ass, I honestly do  care ‚ù§ about  what you are asking for, but at this point they are  more interested in Mico transactions than what any of of us in this community wants from this broken üíî down golf ‚õ≥ cart üöó. 
---
I feel your pain, I have been soaked for $450 CAD at this point because I fell üôè to there Golden ü•ï corporate tactics. 
---
And in my opinion, you deserve at least this one request because you have earned it. 
---
I do wish you all the best üëç I truly do ü§ç
---
And who knows maybe me being sarcastic about there business tactics üôÑ may make them re think ü§î things over and make your request a possibility. 
---
Because that is usually how it works. 
---
And I wasn't being sarcastic about wishing you the very best, because I know what you are asking should have been implemented from the beginning. I am just tired of this company's way of doing things. That all. 
---
Once again, I apologize for being sarcastic.
---
Yes.
---
Lol I'm just trying to offload this 5mm bro chill
---
Imagine the scrapbox. But for ammo.
---
I make spiral staircases out of suitcases for my levels.
---
I call them Stuitcases.
---
Hey this might help.

Rolling SS is pointless.  Very few players have managed get their perfect 3\* for all five pieces.  So many 1\* and 2\* besides the worthless 3\*.
---
So true! I wait to initially herd the Brahmins to give people a chance to get there and help out but they only seem to arrive when it‚Äôs time to kill the boss... some might say it‚Äôs quite suspicious! üòÇ
---
Exactly. For all it‚Äôs hate, Fortnite is a good battle royale, hence its popularity. Nuclear Winter is not. I like Fallout way more than Fortnite - it‚Äôs just a more enjoyable genre to me. But trying to stick a battle royale into Fallout just doesn‚Äôt work, and if I feel like battle royale I‚Äôd go play something like fortnite.
---
The reason the others are more popular is the Legendary run and need for experience gain to progress. 
---
If the other team types are to be used more, they need to have their benefits changed in a way that will boost exp gain.
---
Flux doesn't drop in your bag after the queen. It vanishes into infinite.
---
Have you also been doing the NW ones?  Just curious.  I've been doing all dailies and weeklies except for NW and still more than 10 away from completing this thing.
---
Ultracite laser rifles have alas been like this since launch...
---
Jokes on both of you, the flux just gets deleted if you die right after that event ends. It's supposed to be so people can't steal your flux, but it seems like overkill to me...
---
This has been patched
---
Fr they look nasty
---
Lol. Okay guy
---
I don‚Äôt really understand your comment about survival mode. Survival was the same exact map as adventure mode.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Tin_can_(Fallout_76)
---
I started with can chimes. Scroll down that page and it'll tell you the locations and how many chimes are there. Prison being the best spot, do a run then world hop and do it again. Tin cans scrap for 1 lead and 2 steal and a can chime has 9 tin cans
---
My run was just prison, Camden park, then Hawks refugee. Be careful in hawks refugee there is usually a glowing one or a wendigo but they arent the worst to kill
---
Exactly, if you want to fine tune your build and gear for the imposter or the queen you can do that in the comfort of your home own camp.
---
I want to get through the score and I missed the first 3 weeks so I wanted to get as much done as I can. Doing all the dqily level ups probably made up for days I missed
---
I've not seen a legendary there in over a year now....
---
I think you cant get in until hitting general with Enclave, so this one might not be an option either way lol
---
I fast traveled to a gulped horde in the bog.  Landed right in a fissure.  Shoulda drop my scrap first.....o well more scrap to find tonight.
---
That didn't work out well
---
WHAT?!
---
#*YOU. BASTARDS!!*
---
Here lately, for the last six levels, I am buying every other level.  I'm ready for the grind to be over for this but am interested in getting some of the final, better rewards.
---
Same. Even got on late last night and did everything accept that. Got on this morning, new character, levelled up and turned off the ps4 again
---
Keep quite about the sunny tops.....even on double xp nobody goes up there or the dam.
---
I would love to kill him. I am genuinely hoping they do that now.
---
Lol we all did the same stuff here
---
Same issue here on PS4
---
Yea I might return it, thought it would
---
I can't see this via a browser on PC - any tips?
---
Oh - never mind found it in the panel at the top right on the drop-down for "Community options"
---
My gun reloads at half mag in vats, very frustrating when i‚Äôm doing great damage on the queen and i have to reload and she‚Äôs back in the air by then
---
Im on an iphone sry
---
Okay thanks just watched his video. I guess that explains it. A bit disappointing since I enjoy the explosive effect on weapons but whatever I will just stick with the other one for now
---
Occam's razor says they fudged it, though.
---
Thanks for the detailed review.  I'm not far into the game but I can already sense what you're talking about.
---
I use a 3 star instigating 25% fire rate pump action shotgun that 1 shots everything in vats
---
What would their coallective name be tho?
---
Only way, and it's been awhile that I've had this happen, is to switch the card your sharing. But sometimes its only temporary.
---
Charleston Fire Station  
---
I built my crappy camp right outside so everytime I spawn back I check for lead weights.  
---
If I am in a bind it might take a couple re-loads but you can get hundreds of lead units (more with perks) on scrapping them.  
---
And there is an overseers box there to farm canned dog food and water
---
They're invincible it's so frustrating
---
Most people I know choose Morgantown because it has better loot and more high ground advantages.
---
The wooks probably choose it because there's a lot more good hiding spots.
---
I already have 3 unyielding, herd mentality, inspirational, kindred spirit and canned meat stew and enlightenment when I can
---
Yeah that event death glitch has been in since the beginning of the game, the only solution is to hard reset the game to get back in!
---
I'm ps4 though.
---
Because excavator was never manufactured in large quantities.
---
Whitespring or West Tek? Both? I see legendaries at both locations, with higher frequency at WS outside of club house. Clubhouse seems to have less legendaries spawn than the rest of the residences around the grounds
---
Edit: went to go verify at clubhouse just a few seconds ago and first ghoul is 3* lol 
---
Edit 2: went afk to report the first 3* and there was a 1* also in the upstairs area. Both were the sleeping variant that wakes up when u enter
---
Edit 3: one more 1* (though just a lv 42 one) downstairs by the wendigo/glowing one. 
---
Was trying to prove that WS clubhouse isn't great, but that WS proper was decent. Found 3 in clubhouse on same trip -.-
---
A whole 6 months? Maybe. I‚Äôd rather give them 1 month, maybe 2.
---
You think anyone would craft and scrap 250 pipe weapons just to get cork for one donation? I know this community is pretty insane, but not that insane...
---
IT JUST WORKS!
---
I dunno, I donated 4500 so it's possible
---
Whitesprings, seen a few in Westek in the last couple of weeks.
---
Ahhhhh......i wish we could clean up appalachia again and send all these squatters back cross the mountains.
---
In the settings menu there is an option to see the names of the players, perhaps you have disabled it.
---
Settings&gt;display 
---
Same thing happened to me and the setting had somehow been turned on??? On its own??
---
I went to two different places where I knew that one spawned, and found one in the second spot I checked.
---
 Just remember where you find them at, and then go back to those places. We just had this challenge a week or so ago - where'd you find one last time?
---
Also yes
---
That would actually be cool.  I‚Äôm not even a melee player, but I would actually think about switching over with this
---
I've used a ssd since before NW was released. It used to only give me a 1 or 2 second advantage but after the Wastelanders update it's 20+ seconds.
---
The loading screen that says "waiting for all players" no longer waits for all players... It's 100% a screw up on Bethesa's end.
---
I meant adventure mode my bad, it's got the whole Hunger mechanic like "survival" games do, and I forgot that there actually was a survival mode a while back
---
My bad
---
Prolly bit the place for thus but idk where to ask... can anything be help me launch my first nuke?
---
Just play fallout 3 or 4
---
This.  I mined there a few times a couple months ago.  Still haven‚Äôt ran out
---
Honestly the game needs something like a roomba that just sucks up all the meat/metal/ash/goo piles and their loot and just dumps them all into one big dumpster for you to loot at your disposal later on. It takes care of the issue of having to manually find and loot all the corpses at the end of an event, and takes care of the piles causing major FPS drops. Hell, maybe even make it some NPC you can talk to at the Rusty Pick that you can hire to do it for your for a couple thousand caps or a scrip or two.
---
Bitch at your internet provider
---
It hasn't alas.
---
OG BE Gatling - the sound it makes gets me all tingly inside!  Everything gets rekt!
---
I'd like a 1x1 set of stairs that slots into a corner.  The precedent exists in a lot of the generic houses in the world.
---
The stair situation is kind of a mess.  The standard staircase basically requires a 1x3 stretch of space.  The 2x1 option is rather ugly and very fiddly when it comes to the things you are allowed to put under it (always snapping them to the top floor if they are above a certain height).
---
I've been saying exactly that since I started playing. Too many much needed fixes. When my friends and I start playing, there's always something buggy in the first 5-10 minutes. We always just say, "Well, add that to today's list!"
---
Why? I spawn in way before everyone else... I get the feeling that you do as well and you don't want your advantage taken away.
---
Hunting should be extra % to finding legendaries.
---
I was trying the other day to get mine to set inside of the dumpster stashbox along with some campfires, but it wouldn't cooperate.
---
I have a weapon weight 20% chest. So it is possible.
---
Make some prefab structures to blueprint in Adventure mode, use them to gain a higher elevation, then move your camp when you're ontop of a Morgan Town roof so there is no evidence of your scaffolding climb! All the time in the world to snipe and practise your aim!
---
The lobbies already struggle to fill at certain hours. Adding in another mode would completely kill both game modes.
---
If you are on Xbox I sell it cheap in bulk
---
Definitely go with a group. It's not something you can fumble your way through successfully. That 'sheepsquatch' can take me out in a couple hits. And he isn't the only thing you're fighting.
---
I have yet to get a bloodied anything to roll besides 1 star melee weapons
---
A: I didn't 'literally' complain about how little time I often have for the game. Nor did I complain about the game punishing me for such a thing. I \*clearly\* stated that I do not play as long as I'd like to because the motivation to do so is not there under the current reward system - I never once mentioned not having enough time to play.  I suggest you read my post again - and this time, take your time and comprehend what I have said. 
---
B: Hypocrisy is saying or doing one thing and then turning around and saying or doing the opposite. How the hell you got anything like that out of my post is anyone's guess.
---
Your reply shows me that you once again, completely missed the point - and indeed don't even understand what I wrote. Anyway, this thread is deleted now so I'm not even sure why I'm bothering to reply. Have a good one.
---
Let‚Äôs be careful with Bethesda and bags...
---
Vault Tec sees what wondrous and helpful things you are doing. We applaud you. We will be sending... representatives... to your camp. Not only will they be there to... help... but to also... protect... your future transactions within the community. üòè
---
It was a atomic shop item
---
I've not even gotten Unyielding to drop for it...
---
I‚Äôve had good luck here too.
---
Aiming.pro 
---
Thank me later
---
Yeah I have only missed one or two of the NW ones and just finished earlier today.
---
They were an atom shop item I believe
---
Just to add to what everyone‚Äôs been saying (i think it‚Äôs 180 although others have said 250) but if you loot everything in the areas starting with what you want to loot (lead), then by the time you finish looting everything and server hop, the lead should be there. 
---
Example: I go to Charleston Fire House and pick up the lead first, then pick EVERYTHING up, server hop, should be good to go. 
---
Also quick tip, I stopped going to those spots after I discovered the excavator PA and Lucky Hole Mine. Get a shit ton of acid and the Super Duper perk, easy 500+ lead in 1 go
---
A lot of other things they need to fix before this, this ain‚Äôt really a high priority compared to the soooooo many other game breaking bugs
---
Im on PS4, besides im currently broke because i bought a bunch of lead (before i got the idea to fight a ‚òÜLegendary LVL 50 Sheepaquatch)
---
Still thanks
---
It's the exclusive item in the Fasnacht Mask Bundle.
---
Thanks for this :)
---
Like I mentioned in a previous post. I bet Bethesda isn't giving the true numbers and are making look like the community is donating their material. 
---
I, for one, haven't donated nor visited the camp to donate. This "community event" is nothing but a smoke show to make it look like Bethesda cares. 
---
I don't see any 1 player would donate more than 1000 of any material. I only feel like they put such an absurd amount to donate because of those that have Fallout 1st.
---
Liberty prime has entered the chat
---
I could honestly have skipped all of the NW ones and still finished way early if I think about it tho. Now another double score weekend coming up as well.
---
I feel like i noticed that the remaining ammo was then just forgotten and lost
---
Yeah I have a left arm that is WWR a right leg that is food chems a left leg with ammo and my right arm is also WWR torso I just keep getting two star unyielding but I do have a bolstering with WWR. That is out of 60ish rolls total.
---
So this week a person here mentioned Old World Radio Boston on YouTube and I‚Äôm not gonna lie it will be what I listen to while I play from here on.
---
Its not a fun battle royale. Its not fun to die in 2 seconds to a player with a radium rifle 20 feet in the air.
---
They don't care about duping, so I doubt they'll care about this.
---
Every time I join that event now it's with the group spawn.
---
I think I‚Äôd rather have completely new weapons rather than skins, the screaming eagle skin could‚Äôve been a totally different weapon with different damage/range/fire rate/sound or even ammo type used
---
None. take 5 of whatever you want to be addicted to in quick succession. profit.
---
If you want to buy a legacy god roll like bloodied explosive faster reload gatling plasma even the max 150k isn't enough. Caps are so easy to obtain I don't understand why people are surprised some items are expensive. If I were to try it would probably take like 2 days to get 15k caps.
---
Why does it bother you, it's been in the game since launch, nobody's getting banned over it, it's gotta be known to Bethesda by this point 
---
Might as well use it til it's patched out, if they do ever decide to do so
---
This essentially breaks the Legendary Run, and any future Season Passes that come to the game. Surely that's priority?
---
I‚Äôm imagining dual wielding TSE or FE auto 10mm with the mags glitched and I‚Äôm getting really happy lol
---
Yea that's normal unless you skip a day then you can do both in one day, or at least that's been my experience
---
With all the other problems in the game I see this as something minor and not much to worry about, it's not like getting xp any faster does anything for you after you've passed lvl 50.  I don't see them worrying about it right now, they got bigger things to worry about right now..
---
3rd person spray with gauss shotgun, that‚Äôs all you need
---
I think that‚Äôs normal for the raider ones.
---
They do care about duping, they have been clamping down on it. Same with NW hackers, but I'd still like to see some anti-cheat software added to the game.
---
Then the seller clearly doesn‚Äôt know that caps are worthless after the d*pe a few months ago. Nobody who knows what theyre doing is selling je, be, bffr, etc. at cheap prices, and most people won‚Äôt even accept caps at all
---
Idk about useless. Took me 1:42 seconds to die from rads at +10 a sec. With the barrel 0:41 to die. 
---
Not including taking off armor, because I also run aquaboy and even without aquaboy I'd have to take it off my armor anyway because its only +1 a second. 
---
Could it be improved, yes with a more "spamable" button and the ability to ignore the players rad resistance.
---
[deleted]
---
I haven't checked yet but that does suck. 
---
For your neon sign question btw, if it is the atomic shop, things there often return and most of the time on offer too. Often 20-40%.
---
I've never done one personally because I though it would be alot more work than bloodied but apparently it's not much more maintenance than a bloodied biuld
---
Probably with the ultracite mod, deals more damage to SBQ
---
Hold steady my fellow Legionnaires, we will kill this degenerate when the time is right
---
I can't remember the name at the moment, but the Chinese base under Mama Dolce's has one spawn in the office area on the lowest floor. Most people scoot in to steal the fusion core, but the bobblehead seems to be left alone. Plus it's an easy place to get some robot kills if that comes up again.
---
What was yet list? Bruh if Nick valentine wasn't on that list I'll dm you a pic of a diseased big dick. (No I won't)
---
Only need to get addicted one time to 5 different chems &amp; then nil upkeep. If you've finished wastelanders I'd recommend solar armor. Always 3* when you make it &amp; it has awesome health regen. Just need vault steel though
---
I quit playing at level 25 because of the tedium. I was totally enslaved to chores and couldn‚Äôt progress in the story. While spending all my time trying to repair weapons and armor. Time spent collecting materials broke more weapons and armor at a rate i couldn‚Äôt keep up with.  I finally moved my camp to a strategic  location near material farming and my camp wouldn‚Äôt reassemble as saved.  Locking all my stash limit with it.  I couldn‚Äôt collect anything and i couldn‚Äôt purge. Made a ticket with bethesda and heard nothing. Was so excited about this game I was playing on day one. I quit 10 months later.  To be clear I only get about an hour or two after workrto game.
---
I speak to people who are doing it, and they ***know*** it's an exploit but because it's not been patched, they feel it's fine to do. If we got clarification from Beth even stating that it's not punishable because it's their screw up, at least we'd know where we stand, ya know?
---
The durability is indeed pathetic.
---
Even if you max out your Rifleman perks, there just isn't much to justify the current state of Laser/Ultracite Laser Rifles.  You can apply the Beam Splitter mod and get a sort of "magic" effect in VATS, like shotguns, where each pellet counts for full damage.  But it's very inconsistent and, as mentioned, you have to repair it constantly.
---
Worse, we *still* have the Ash Pile bug where enemies that are burned to death with laser weapons fail to respawn correctly - this is why you get the headless, invulnerable abominations that spawn in their place.  So that's even more incentive not to run with these - you screw it up for the next person who passes through.
---
There is so many other ways the legendary run has been broken for this season already, god mode glitch and even now with the repeatable score glitch u can do but i maxed out the legendary run 2 weeks ago just by grinding XP when it was double XP and then using lunchboxes and stuff to get nearly 400% XP so i shot threw the run in just a few hours
---
there is zero maintenance. take 5 of whatever you want to be addicted to quickly, that's it. Stay away from addictol and omelettes.
---
I also factor in location. 
---
Right by Vault 76 or the Wayward? Sure.
---
But if you're of in endgame areas with vendors full of crap?  Screw you.
---
How did they clamp down, ban everyone for a week &amp; then let them keep the items. How tough can they get :)
---
Well, it's an unintended way to farm XP. That's not how Bethesda wanted the Legendary Run to play out. They want player retention, not this nonsense.
---
The real problem is the people who put the tent in the wrong place.
---
there's only two scout masks. Urban and forest
---
Unfortunately there isn‚Äôt. If you want it to fire faster, it would have to drop with FFR...or be explosive which inherently increases its fire rate. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
There are weight plates in the prison yard - where the prison break event happens. Unfortunately it may be gone due to the number of people who go for the event.
---
Charleston fire dept weight room is an excellent low level spot many people know. 
---
Also pick up tin cans, rat poison and paint cans (not empty paint cans thought). Cans usually have lead and there are tons of them around, plus paint and rat poison have 4-5 lead each. 
---
The monorail elevator, take the lift on the southern end (the one further from the cliff). Go to the top and walk around. It leads to a monorail train hung up there. Just before you get on there are weights everywhere
---
It bothers me because I stream the game. I refuse to showcase exploits and on top of that, I really don't want to gain from illegitimate methods.
---
I think the problem is that so many people have no idea how much to sell their legendary items for. There's so many inconsistencies in prices of items that most people refuse to sell them. I mean me personally I just scrip all the shit 1 star legendary items I know I won't use. 
---
That and the fact that there is a cap limit remember. If you can sell a bunch of cheap shit and only lose out on a few caps because you've already hit the limit, then that's much better than potentially selling a legendary for 3000+ caps and losing those caps because you've hit the limit is a kick in the ass.
---
Even if they removed the ability to place tents nearby, as long as you stand in a certain spot, you can force all the spawns into a different location and it's actually easier.  It's a bigger issue related to how the spawns rules are set.
---
Yep, the excavator power armor multiplies the lead you mine.
---
Sure, more weapons would be cool and intersting. I am happy that more will come with the BoS. But that would require extensive design and balancing work. Otherwise we would be left with garbage or OP weapons. On the other hand, a skin just makes the current weapons we all have right now look better and different. It adds spice and variety with less work.
---
He's likely still hanging out with Mad Max.
---
You can make the explosive one bugged too you just have to wear the armor with blocker, so no PA. I have a BE one and it does magic dps just fine.
---
There are easier and more legit ways to get faster xp... Line in the Sand is just lazy xp.
---
You dont get anymore xp from this event when they are piled up vs when they spawn normal , u just have to hunt them down,  but it doesnt just magically give you more xp
---
Post is about weapons, not PA. I used those skins as an example only.
---
Would be amazing if they had a Fat Man Launcher skin that was just you yeeting the fat man with your hands like Liberty Prime.
---
Agreed.
---
Junkies high maintenance, not as much as bloodied in theory but more people sell unyielding than vanguards. 
---
I'd actually recommend keeping your super god roll and just half ass the build. Instead of having 20-25% health, have as much as you want. Even the smallest amount of health lose will increase your damage. My main is a jack of all trades and bloodied still makes him powerful, regardless of my health.
---
The Thunderpipe skin is probably the best weapon skin currently in game, yet they can‚Äôt fix the animation so the crank looks glued to the back of user‚Äôs fist. They probably have only one intern in the art department developing those models.
---
It‚Äôs a battle royale. 90% of the time you play the game you‚Äôre not doing anything but inventory management. 
---
Its also rather infuriating when you have the skill to win a gunfight against nearly everyone else, but you either get headshotted from a mile off, or you die in the last minute or so because everyone just uses grenade launchers and frog legs.
---
It‚Äôs not skill based, it‚Äôs almost entirely luck based so, a vast majority of the time, EVEN IF you do everything right, someone got more lucky than you, so you lose again, same as usual, another HOUR of your life down the drain, with fuck all to show for it but 50 caps and 1/10 the xp required to level up.
---
Once you get excavator you can head into lucky hole mine and get over 1000 lead or (300 lead ore ) use super duper when making it. I‚Äôve almost gotten 2000 lead doing this run
---
I understand where you're coming from. That makes sense.   
---
Would it kill them to make a statement on it? There needs to be communication from the Dev to the community. Let us know where we stand on things like this, even if it is a bug, give us a dialogue that gives us transparency on it.  
---
Remember back to the issue with the Strangler Armor? It took them 6 months to acknowledge there was an issue and talk to us about it.
---
Well shucks.  You just saved me 5000 caps, though!
---
It's a spawn mechanic. One person can stand in a certain place at line in the sand and make enemies spawn in the middle. You can also do it with other quests. 
---
While you're snitching like a snitching grass do you wanna tell them about guided mediation not spawning enemies if you stay in a certain place cos that's getting quests rewards  illegitimately!1111!!!!1!
---
Hmmm, why is everyone crowning the bloodied build as the end all be all then if it‚Äôs such a pain to make sure enemies don‚Äôt get too close for obvious melee reasons and to not die to my own bullet explosions. Unless the high rolled SS armors really makes that big a difference?
---
‚ÄúSpoken like a communist with an agenda.‚Äù Responds Mr Gutsy.
---
They sell what they want to sell. You can't fault them for that. 
---
Get mad at Bethesda for not distinguishing legendary from normal when you hover over a camp on your map.
---
If they can remove a laser musket and replace it with a rifle on a photo frame, at the very least, they could provide us with more information about the camps we look at.
---
1 thing I really want them to do is remake the gauss rifle or make an updated auto gauss rifle like the new Gauss guns with wastlanders, would be so cool because it gets boring using handmades and fixers all the time
---
Oh no I'm terrible badjuju247 if you ever see me on server
---
Believe me I wish there was such a mod. Lol. I‚Äôm glad I could help! üò¨üò¨üò¨
---
Err, why would you need to use Vats with a shotgun?
---
You just pull the trigger....again and again....
---
Only time I VATs is when a weekly forces me to.
---
Also, pistols?  Uhh, no....only good for scrapping.
---
Watch captainoobs YouTube clip on it. Bloodied sneak commando will be the best build for it.
---
I agree
---
It's hard to get but the Bear Arm looks so fucking nice in first person, especially after you killed some things with it and it gets covered in blood.
---
I think the game knows you are actively looking for things and doesn't spawn. In the same vein, when I'm not even trying, Ohh there is a bobblehead, or there is a magazine. I probably have found more bobbleheads than magazines, but I stopped trying way back then the tadpole challenge was a thing.
---
The issue will obviously take to remedy, I understand that.  
---
But a statement to tell us that 'until it's fixed, don't worry about spawn trapping' or 'please do not use the exploit' would be really appreciated because then we would know how best to proceed in this situation. It's dividing streaming communities, that's for sure.
---
I don't mind it at all.. it's something to do
---
junkies caps at +50% damage, whereas bloodied at 19% health is +80% damage, not including need rage.
---
This is a good question. Watching the devs play last week was pretty informative. I'm trying to fit in some cards I rarely use for anything else including Glowsight, Dodgy, Blocker, and Mysterious Savior. I may find a piece or two of Lifesaving armor to use. Given the small area of the cavern Medic's weapons may finally have a use. And at first I'll be bumping my health up to give a little extra damage padding.
---
It's really not that hard to not die as bloodied, plus bloodied does 30% more damage than junkies
---
I have finished wastelanders but haven‚Äôt done much with the bullion yet. Is solar armor good for bloodied or junkies...or both?
---
Nah. I'm just reporting a guy who did it in a workshop that had my name on it. Pretty specific situation. But people aren't here to read the post, they're just here to downvote because they're scared of losing their glitch. I get it.
---
It‚Äôs easy... maybe if you FO1st people played on public servers a bit more you could actually do the bobble head daily
---
Already learned that lesson. The dude that triggered it for me to write this was all the way up in Toxic Valley. NO EXCUSES lol
---
If the game is fun there will be a lot more players, simple as that. Right now a lot of players only play it to get the score then head back to Adventure within seconds if the task is easy.
---
... it is a game tho. I cant even comprehend why you think of it as a business first and a game second. The priority of any good business is product quality first, profit second. Otherwise the business loses its customers to competitors then goes under. Imagine if you could get a burger from McDonalds but it tasted like literally sewerage. They could make it dirt cheap but would anyone actually go there? No/bad produce = business losses. It's that simple.
---
Stealth, serendipity and a good set of unyielding should negate those deaths. Own bullet explosion deaths also negated by fireproof, but legacy energy explosives will still kill you if you shoot too close, even if you are a full hp build.
---
I also wait and if I'm on a team I call them over to participate.  Hardly anyone does... but at the end... I'm stuck herding they're busy killing.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs so much fun!! It‚Äôs my main weapon for my bloodied heavy weapons build!
---
I'm asking for feedback on the status of the event. But, you do you.
---
I see like 25% building, 45% events and the rest are usually exploration or legendary hunting. But that‚Äôs probably because I‚Äôm on Xbox and a lot of the new gamepass players don‚Äôt know how it works/which specials do what
---
I always get a stutter when entering White Springs (PS4)
---
But everywhere else I am fine
---
Nice idea, count me in
---
That would be way too hard to implement and would require an entire new way the legendary enemy system works.
---
And adrenal reaction too! Its much more than just flat 80% bonus vs 50% bonus. Much more.
---
Most people don't realize but the Line in the Sand group spawning is the single best place to collect steel in the game. Collecting all available weapons after the event and scrapping them with the Scrapper perk enabled can net between 1000 and 2500 steel very quickly. Crafting .50 cal ammo uses a huge amount of steel so this behavior is a welcome relief from having to grind steel collection.
---
[removed]
---
This was in a workshop on a public team. I thought the same but I guess it can be used wherever.
---
Okay I will look for one, thanks
---
Yeah, I find I accidentally kill myself more than anything lol, by dying to the bullet explosions.
---
It would be hard to kill 99% of them without this method, so arguably it does, but not much.
---
I understand that. Only refering to the fact that cosmos is ugly so if the weapon skins were like that, it would also be ugly. Although if they were like liberty prime, which is cool, they wouldn't be. Feel like I explained it pretty thoroughly.
---
I enjoy bring in abusive relationships so that‚Äôs why I renewed for another month
---
Until Bethesda makes a statement on it, I don't think it can be confirmed as legitimate or not 
---
I don't see the harm in using the farming strat for now, and then later of Bethesda ever makes a statement on it, you can explain that you will no longer be doing it to your stream due to this new information 
---
But it's your stream dude
---
I don't see how.  I have an explosive minigun and I don't die to it at all, I use pa and only 1 rank of fireproof
---
We can see examples of business SELLING AT LOSSES ensuring quality over profit so they can secure a market base to cut out/bankrupt competition so they can form a monopoly I cant even begin to explain how ridiculous your comment is
---
Silos and white springs for me
---
Every god dam time (XB1)
---
Everything you just said was prefaced with probably, imagine, or assume. I donated 4000 Cork, but even with that we should be nowhere near 60 something million.
---
Other possible ideas:
---
Exploration: gain bonus loot (caps, rare plans and rare junk) from steamer trunks.
---
Role play: faction uniforms provide bonus health, AP and AP regen.
---
Hunting: increased chance for legendary enemies to drop legendary items equal to their star rating.
---
Building: bonus XP is good.
---
Event: completing events now rewards a number of ammo crafting packages (initially introduced when vault 96 went live) equal to your bonded player number and increases the chances of events dropping their rarest loot.
---

---
Most people would frown at this, but if you have an unyielding set, then you can quiet easily run either, but you don't get the health regeneration at less than 60% health &amp; that's when unyielding starts to kick in. Its what I'm trying anyway. So you only get one of the benefits at a time. What I was thinking is run junkies with solar healing for the colossus &amp; unyielding the rest of the time. Not sure though as it looks like s bullet sponge &amp; junkies just doesn't do enough damage  compared to bloodied.
---
One, I'm on PC so hackers galore. Two, my friends don't play, so soloing NW just isn't that appealing, particularly because of one and the ever popular bush wookies.
---
Yikes, I guess I didn‚Äôt give it enough credit, 30% is a lot...however they both seem to be a stupid amount of damage anyway and either way I‚Äôm one shotting most things and I don‚Äôt want to be a dick and try to melt SBQ so maybe I‚Äôll give it up anyway in favor of junkies.
---
Why would that affect my framerate?
---
I have an anti-armor MG42 light machine gun and that thing could drop anything in a couple seconds. The first time I tried it out I accidentally walked into a cave with a lvl 91 death claw. I knew I was a dead man, but pulled the trigger anyway. The rate of fire was insane and the death claws health melted like butter and died - it never reached me. You have to have the big mag on it because the rate of fire is about the highest in the game. It also eats ammo like no tomorrow (. 308, too, which sucks).
---
Problem is, the moment people discover what anyone wants to buy, they squeeze as much as they can out of it. And patching music out can be deeply disconcerting (I was activly pissed at GTA V when the Classic Rock station became the Classic Shit Nobody Liked station. I get WHY, I understand, but its still vexing
---
I believe he is referring to the actual quest that is suppose to lead to the event. They mention it in one of the ITV articles or QuakeCon promos I believe. They said the quest would start with a new NPC added in foundation.
---
I remember the days of the Dead Money DLC back in New Vegas when I finally made it into the Sierra Madre Casino. I killed the ghost people in the entrance area and my health was super low I was rummaging around for stimpacks but no luck, I made my way to the bathrooms and my cross hair slipped passed the urinal and caught a glimpse of the HP I would receive if I would drink from it. I never bothered to drink from a urinal or a toilet in New Vegas but hot damn that HP I needed was a life saver!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Yeah I can‚Äôt tell you how much I‚Äôve rolled on solar (I wasn‚Äôt a fan of thorns) to get even a semi-respectable set.  It‚Äôs easily 100 rolls.
---
I did finally just finish this, it took multiple tries of logging out and back in, going to the terminal first and hitting analyze.  The only difference I noted is the scorched that is usually in the Terminal room was not present
---
I only sell legendaries.
---
I know what you mean, but I just can't bring myself to do that. :/
---
The gauss rifle looked so cool in fallout 3 and NV. I dont know why they changed its look so drasticly.
---
I don't hate it, but :
---
1.As a battle royale it is bad
---
2.Neverending cheaters
---
3.Poor netcode
---
4.Visibility issues
---
5.Small player base
---
To succeed in BR genre it has to be somewhat polished.
---
I joined one where that happened, it was pretty funny.  They just spawned like normal.
---
I think some are very low level players. I suggest this because the other day I was helping out a lv 10. He had a camp on the front steps of cranberry bog, around the asylum.
---
I made him a few things, including a vendor, which he promptly filled with what most high lvs would consider junk.
---
I asked him: why camp here? He says, he looked up good camp locations online and fast traveled here via someone else's camp.
---
Net result was one vendor in a high lv area selling stuff collected in his first 10 lvs of the game.
---
Lol I'm just kidding around
---
Oh, that‚Äôs a really good point, lol. I auto assumed I had to min/max the thing...it never occurred to me I don‚Äôt have to sit at 20% or less health to get value.
---
I've been thinking of doing it deliberately to piss off the 'your vendor should contain what I say' type of people
---
How long would it take a collectron to find 30 knuckles?
---
This post has been applicable since October 2018.
---
I don‚Äôt like fortnite either. Battle royale is just not my thing. But objectively speaking, when you look at battle royales, fortnite is one of the better ones. Nuclear winter sucks - always has, always will. Battle royale just doesn‚Äôt work with Fallout.
---
Honestly, considering the whole alternate history thing and all, I am shocked they don't just commission more music at this point. Might be a hell of a lot easier and cheaper in the long run to have a pile of music they own and can keep using in Fallout games than to pay rights for everything. Keep using certain setpeices for ad campaigns and the like (hope they got the Country Roads cover in perpetuity) and make their own music (well, hire folks to make music for them)
---
Building could also be something like double scrap and/or half building costs. Although I do like my extra INT.
---
Go pick up cap stashes at the black water mine then in private servers or on the roof above the Enclave entrance with skeleton.
---
I've had my game blue screen twice today, it's frozen up a handful of times for a couple of seconds, had "server not responding, controls temporarily disabled" three times, and a straight up freeze bag enough once that I had to restart my console.
---
Lmao if you enjoy NW good for you but it is objectively shit.
---
Yes please! Reloading animation for dual single actions would be interesting, though..
---
.45-70 would be nice too, especially in a lever action.
---
1st-ers are the big thing. There is no reason not to cram every last bit of scrap into the scrap box if you have it. And cork \*can\* add up, depending on where and what you loot.
---
feedback is it's not harming you or anyone. It makes the event quicker so you can go do other things. It's the mechanic of the game that they spawn there. They'd have to change the way enemies spawn and i think they have way more important things to do
---
Keep complaining to customer support, they'll just lock your ticket and ignore you but we have to keep up the pressure!
---
I despise players like that!
---
We don't get score from this, THAT'S THE PROBLEM!
---
Just use the bobble head perk card. I equipped it and as soon as I came out of the pip boy it started going off. You can just do other challenges and you‚Äôll probably come across it naturally
---
Toxic Valley is endgame? Gee i always figured that was lower middle range
---
That defeats the point of 76
---
Well, I‚Äôm probably over selling it. But sometimes like a radiation rumble where there are a bunch of ghouls, etc. around I end up VATS‚Äôing an enemy or two like two feet from me and because I‚Äôm siting at 20% health the AOE gets me and the Chinese Armor doesn‚Äôt protect as much as I was hoping for.
---
Also, didn‚Äôt have fireproof perks on so I‚Äôm sure that helps significantly.
---
Considering I've managed to run West Tek with just my Instigating 38 pipe pistol I'm in.
---
Ultracite is lower damage but it‚Äôs rate of fire is higher than the non ultra lasers. As for it breaking so fast.. that‚Äôs just the way it is. Best thing you can do is put a forceful stock on it like someone already suggested
---
I'd be fine with that, if it came from Bethesda.
---
Hunters long coat
---
You're assuming that the event will actually be available to play one  day outside of test servers?
---
Niantic (makers of Pokemon Go) did something similar when the first GO Fest was a live event disaster with broken number counters, and they just "adjusted it" in real time :D
---
Is this legit? I tried it once, and she said there were no rooms available, and I just left after going through the usual corners there, I didn't see anything odd. But I did get this set up twice (its the same basic setup, different locations) guys tied to a refrigerator of some other junk, low-level raider/cultist shoots at them so you have to help, then some way-higher NPC's come from nowhere and ambush.
---
If pc and you want the plan I have it. IGN artinla66
---
Didn‚Äôt have the fireproof, just learned about that a few minutes ago. I guess I should‚Äôve researched the build before just trying to adapt my current one.
---
Sorry, I just realized you might have been talking about gliched weapons, and I was talking about legacy weapons
---
No there's your problem.  You can't be sniping things from 2 feet away with no good armor.  I don't have a problem with it because I use power armor.
---
They should bring the creation club into f76. If indipendent creators worked on the skins, we could get them more frequently and most likely with the same or greater quality.
---
Given the nature of the other 'challenges' it is mildly sadistic on the part of Beth.
---
Upon further reflection it's perfectly in keeping with the entire Legendary Run concept. A multi-week grind for frankly pathetic rewards... this game is circling the drain with great rapidity.
---
Great thanks!
---
.. Why not just nudge the requirement down instead of the number up? First rule of getting shit past the radar, do it consistently.
---
Cork is easy to get if you know where to look, and it's rarely used, so Fallout 1st members were probably swimming in it. Now that they dumped it in, I suspect numbers won't raise so high. 
---
Did we actually complete/"complete" the concrete challenge?
---
Plenty of the Ink Spots catalogue are in the public domain &amp; they‚Äôre after the 1923 cut off, Such as ‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù etc, There is a lot of music post 1923 that are in the public domain because copyrights were never renewed, It comes down more to a discovery &amp; digitalising issue especially since Universal never took the steps needed to protect thousands upon thousands of artists works &amp; a fire destroyed said work. There are so many inaccuracies being posted in these comments.
---
Dope thanks man. Wouldn't happen to have one on you? And what mask? Surgical or bandana?
---
In terms of levels, [Toxic Valley is only the next stop up from The Forest](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-map-level-zones-5076). It's far, *far* from endgame.
---
Nope no one i play with in my group has donated anything. Its a waste of material for re-skinned xmas gifts that we all still have.
---
if you read the zenimax tos then it is officially exploitative and banable. will you get banned for it? doubt it.
---
I tried it with my non-PA heavy gunner. It's very good if you get a roll that's suitable for your specific build, but it didn't do anything better than the great weapons I already have.
---
It's hard for me to kill \*any\* of them when people are exploiting the spawn mechanic, because they're obliterated before they hit the ground.
---
Wth do they need cork for anyway? Hopefully making us all some tasty cranberry wine!!
---
same
---
They're fairly abundant in the world, so there's not much need if you just want one. They're also unique in terms of their behavior when you drop them: unlike everything else (which results in a paper bag), a power armor frame is unique and has things like collision enabled. So I imagine Bethesda wanted to avoid the risk of people figuring out how to use crafting and dropping lots of power armor to crash the server.
---
Thx for the tips.
---
When are the synths going to pop out and say hello?
---
Zero maintenance unless you clear your addictions
---
Apparently high fire rate weapons with certain modifiers like 50%limb dmg can stack ridiculous amounts of damage. Basically the dps is faster than the server can register. Eventually the server catches up and the enemy melts. You see this with SBQ where she dies in seconds, usually after she lands, and magic weapons are being used.
---
I climbed to the very top a couple weeks ago. It was really cool, took me about an hour.
---
So change can't happen because it might require some work? JFC....Also why would it be too hard to implement? 
---
Luck already increases the chance for better items, all they would have to do is use the system in place that's already there and give us increased luck benefits. It would just be manipulating the system that's already there and just throwing legendaries onto that list.
---
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.
---
Fo1st color is the 3rd color I think? Good on you man I‚Äôm jealous that you 3 masks
---
Why of course my account number is 69690420 and my pin is 1169 ü§£
---
Lol was very amusing to read thanks haha 
---
Disclaimer: obviously that's not my actual information to anyone else reading incase anyone takes that seriously
---
Maintenance is minimal, pretty much set and forget and reap the benefits of +50% damage
---
- Source your chems for 5 addictions, generally 5 or 6 of each will get the job done if taken in quick succession
---
- No need to get more than 5 addictions as the damage caps at 50% (10% per addiction)
---
- Go about your merry way
---
Addictions have negative side effects when not suppressed by consuming the thing you're addicted to, so choose your vices wisely:
---
- Alcohol: Charisma -1, Agility -1
---
- Buffout: Strength -1, Endurance -1
---
- Calmex: Perception -2, Agility -2
---
- Daddy-O: Perception -1, Intelligence -1
---
- Day Tripper: Charisma -1, Luck -1
---
- Fury: Strength -1, Perception -1
---
- Formula P: Charisma -2, Luck -2
---
- Med-X: Agility -1, DR -10
---
- Mentats: Charisma -1
---
- Overdrive: Strength -1, Agility -1
---
- Psycho: Strength -1, DR -10
---
- X-cell: Strength -1, Perception -1, Endurance -1, Charisma -1, Intelligence -1, Agility -1, Luck -1
---
You did too. I tried to put a camp down but it wouldn't let me.
---
The cap thing would just remove swapping characters all the time so wouldn't necessarily ruin the economy but I understand the concern
---
bethesda made the game. bethesda programmed the spawn mechanics. bethesda have done nothing about the spawn mechanics in 2 years because there's nothing wrong with the spawn mechanics. This line in the sand spawn trick has been popular for several months now. There's been more than enough chance for them to "fix" it. 
---
but if you don't want to partake in the xp gathering then that's fine. you do you.
---
Hope it helps.  Good luck!
---
Do u know where I can find the stream of the devs playing it I looked and couldn‚Äôt find it?
---
I have loaded in anyway and found no camp there and had my camp load in anyway.  Finally moved.
---
No no I‚Äôm planning ahead. Need something to do when I retire
---
That does seem pretty nice it's a win win then but also seems tough to do with game code
---
It should be a type of receiver with low penetration and the real Enforcer/staggering effect.
---
Theyre kind of the same thing really, depending on the gun (stuff i said would apply to a legacy legit explosive laser), but obv hacked weapons are just stronger versions of those, that still havent been removed bcs who knows
---
Solar didn‚Äôt seem like it was going to do much if you have Healing Factor. Or am I wrong about it?
---
Also, that‚Äôs not ideal news, lol
---
Yeah I like the baseline utility of the Building bonus: if you‚Äôre playing a session with no particular goal in mind it‚Äôs the go-to group.
---
I have one,  I just dont put it on very often
---
The composition might be public domain, but the recorded performance likely isn‚Äôt. Symphony No. 5 was composed over 200 years ago but modern performances are copyright protected.
---
Other characters would still be played though to level them other than that just bank ALTs just sit there for the purpose of stash or caps etc. But deffo would be nice for plans to be shared in some way.
---
Maybe players should be rewarded with multiple buffs based on the activities they do, you can still have different labels for parties, just that none of them give specific benefits, you can just get all the buffs by doing different activities and then it takes longer to max. Also maybe all the different activities give a straight exp bonus so doing different stuff will just stack another 10% exp bonus that effects everything.
---
Maaaaaaybe......
---
Are you serious? It is called Explorer because of a reason... Maybe you want a group called Tourist or something.
---
Make sure it is a floater grenade or no deal!
---
Okay, but view it from the pure gameplay view. What does this add that you cannot get elsewhere? What does this add that could not come from another, already in-game source?
---
No spread, higher single shot damage, better range? That's called a rifle. And I assure you, with the right (or wrong) mods, damage falloff is already shocking for those.
---
Maybe a short range, higher damage weapon without the pellet system, for close range VATS? Sounds like a great thing to do with the red headed stepchild of the Fallout 76 lineup, pistols. At least that way pistols would have a purpose again.
---
Far be it for me to try to intrude upon firearm fanwank, to each their own, but I see nothing in this suggestion that makes it worth the effort, again purely from a gameplay perspective. Yes, yes, real world big boolet big damage, but again, not talking real world comparison, talking mechanics.
---
Personally, I'd much rather they brought in the old 5.56 pistol and give wannabe cowboys something to sling.
---
I think public teams having rewards completely ruined the whole point of adding them, nobody actually uses them for their original purpose.
---
I showed this comment to my wife and now she refuses to speak to me. Can anyone send someone with the guts to help?

All I get from searching is some guy who ate someone in a hotel.
---
So probably og.
---
It's right in the name, in caves, damp locations. Try the Wendigo Cave.
---
Which is grand and all, but has nothing to do with this discussion, and is presented as if you can buy it with atoms as opposed to the actual problem, which is that it is not available.

Hunters long coat is a bitch to get.
---
You have to find the random spawn responder bot.
---
Intelligence gives more exp bonus overall since every point gives us 2% experience bonus,(Hard cap is at 40 intelligence if they didn't nerf it) So building parties are popular since it gives an experience bonus that effects all of your activities instead of just legendary kills or bonus exp for events.
---
Lots of places. When I need a quick &amp; easy supply, I go to the dumpsters by the Whitespring Service Entrance.
---
Right? I‚Äôve just never seen it before.
---
I thought it would be great to add at LEAST dogs and eye-bot companions to customize. The dog could have perks to hold people like players in place for a few seconds if attacked, the eye-bot could have sensors and upgradable weapons and such. I feel like a system with that would work out. And future add one for them could be plenty
---
How I have I never seen this before?!
---
Have any vault dweller bend over for you. Plenty of fungus in our caverns to share with you.
---
I get more crashes and respawn glitches than other type of issue.
---
Awesome tips, thx.
---
Who knows what will break if it‚Äôs done
---
that too.
---
My camp is on the first power transmission tower S of the plant.  If I lose patience and go to camp, tHey‚Äôll follow me there, pop up and start working over my plants and the acid extractor
---
Isn't it kind of redundant when you can craft or give any low level legendary to your alt anyway though? For new players I craft them full sets of modded armor and hit them up with some low level legendaries to give them a boost if they want it to help them out. I get have a Gauss shotty but you would have to waste legendary modules on it and also craft all the ammo so it would only be for long time players who has done this already
---
All I‚Äôm finding there is Brain Fungus...
---
Exactly, while grouped. Notice it says nothing about other players being in that group. Even if you are in a public team all by yourself you get the benefits. So, like they said before, there is literally no downside for most builds.
---
[Here's the Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/703168322?t=02h40m25s).
---
Not often enough to be able to answer this question.
---
Google, "Bobbleheads Fallout 76", there is so much information on where to find them.   I only had to visit one place where there were apparently 3 spawn locations, found one in the second place I looked.
---
fo76 is purposely bottlenecked. Bethesda's much smaller [Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Game_Studios_Austin?wprov=sfla1) team manages fo76. its all about Return on Investment. if Zeni/Bethy doesnt put a lot of effort and resources into fo76, the quicker profits start ticking, and shareholders love that. and keep in mind, fo76 is truly a bunch of assets from fo4 (it was intended to be a feature of fo4 afterall), further bringing down costs. Zeni sells the game, has microtransactions, and a "game as a service" plan even furtherrereer bringing in cash. imma make it simple: if people keep paying for fo76, theyre going to keep getting fo76. there is no consequence as far as Zeni is concerned. they are fully aware people are complaining, that this subreddit exists, but we keep spending, so why change? did we all not see them release 588454cs695 different Skyrim ports and various packages? the players think fo76 is broken, but Zeni thinks its exaxctly where it needs to be.

If you would like to share with a heavy gun guy, I wouldnt mind trying to kill everything in my path finding something to trade for.
---
I got a cleaver from the Blood Eagle place near Lewisburg not too long ago. Is that a different item? I didn't try to use it, just knew I'd never seen one before and Stashed it.
---
You mean like this post?
---
You can‚Äôt trade these weapons. They are account bound
---
This. And not many players bought the bundle, and those that did don't seem to use the frog mask. I've never seen it anywhere except once or twice during the event.
---
Plus, Fasnacht masks are out of fashion for the time being, as we are not required to wear one while leveling up every third day or so for that challenge any longer.
---
I did not know that. Guess I learn something new everyday.
---
Who decides what's fun? It's a matter of perspective. The majority of adventure mode players don't think any form of PvP is fun. Nuclear Winter should be marketed individually. As long as it exists as a game mode inside of a game, the percentage of people that consider it fun will be abysmal.
---
I only use it for trades, and to see what the daily challenges are while I'm at work
---
Irony makes the clothes flat.

I am almost sure he will end up making a cameo. Maybe he has been hanging around with the BoS.

---
I completely agree with this. I love the CAMP building aspect and really don't want to redo my main character's camp
---
I miss when SBQ actually could swoop down and pick players up 
---
I dunno why they got rid of that :(
---
Just because I enjoy the game doesn't mean there isn't stuff worth criticizing. If you want to go so far as to suggest we uninstall the game, why don't you just stop using this subreddit?
---
That, fellow redditor, was delicious to read.
---
Snark, well served!
---
I've got 2x TSE 10mm ready for that day.
---
We do try to be helpful and let Bethesda know about the issues we see in game and then that's it it's nerve fixed
---
I never go to west tek, as they seem to spawn sparingly at best. I go there for plastic and steel though. White springs, especially after a nuke, always find them doing the standard run, and 3 minimum throughout.
---
Definitely just bitching to bitch at this point , the meat shack has two. Could have had it done in like 2 server hops that would take about 4 minutes total
---
Not anymore!
---
40% is about where I sit most of the time. More than suffices with a BE Fixer.
---
Trade you for the nocturnal 1* pipe wrench I got from the sbq yesterday.
---
Absolutely, i could have fixed the crappy gold hm skin as well as the blood eagle hm skin for them for free.
---
She's not completely resistant to explosives--as in blocked, like crippling--but her damage resistance and damage negation make explosives practically useless.
---
From the FO76 wiki...

Cave Fungus¬†Location
---
Commonly found inside random caves
---
I can't recall if I've ever actually made that soup though. Brain fungus soup yeah, Cave fungus soup, really don't even remember seeing it in my list of foods.
---
Idk, high chance to stagger, say 30%? And with ‚ÄúSlug Jockey‚Äù it increases to 45% provided with a 15% bonus while also providing a 9% chance to stun an enemy, causing them to ragdoll on the floor, and with a critical shot rises the chance to 27% chance to stun? I don‚Äôt know but I will say it would be cool to see the 5.56 pistol, I‚Äôm not sure about lore though.
---
Had some one offer 150 of each flux for one of mine and a ws jumpsuit
---
What is your build? Curious due to the swarming issue.
---
Only way I‚Äôve seen others say they got it was via commie protectron
---
Wish we had some half foundations and half vertical walls too.
---
I have a 2* ultracite gatling laser. It's just furious with limb damage and primed. I only use it against her, usually use only one or two ultracite fusion cores and I definitely compete. I'm not melting her or anything but I always get loot at the end and feel like I'm contributing in the fight. And as far as I know yes explosive damage is completely useless against her so I wouldn't worry about getting a legacy just try to find a god roll. Been looking for a 3* with better rolls but no luck.
---
BRING IN THE AUTOAXE
---
Well it‚Äôs a type of post I have never actually seen  in this group....addressing all the bitter players of fallout 76
---
Did you know dogs don‚Äôt lay eggs?
---
Exploration I feel should be the main team for low levels and give extra XP for new locations found
---
See using it for something useful!!!!!! Fuck yeah!
---
No it wouldn‚Äôt. The majority of players can‚Äôt transfer caps or don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs a hassle. This means most people are limited to purchases with 30k at a time. If you give people more caps, people will want to stay at max caps and this will drive up prices. It‚Äôs just shifting the problem instead of solving it
---
It‚Äôs almost as if the game having a lot of problems and the mood of the community are somehow connected.
---
Right.......
---
I had thought that omelette tasted funny....
---
I‚Äôm guessing frame drops don‚Äôt have often enough either? I have stable frames but sometimes I‚Äôll experience a small frame drop in specific areas
---
Yes explosive damage is negated, if you throw a mini nuke it will do 1 damage. 
---
I was exactly in the same situation as you I run rifle build and within SBQ was a real nightmare, trying all kind of weapons but specially heavy ones for the DPS, but some of the times it wasn't enough.
---
So I decided to enforce my build, and get a non explosive lever for the sbq, now I can do 500+ damage in one critical with some buffs, mine is not the best lever is a 3*furious. If you can find a better one. If you can find a better one you can do more damage, now really I lose my lot for sbq. So my recommendation is if you run rifle use rifle, there are other good ones to, like fixer or railway.
---
I also have a special weapon for this battle, I usually run a TSE lever. This one does nothing to sbq but kill most all the moon's in one shot, the furious also have prime receiver and does nothing to the mobs.
---
Sorry for my English an happy hunting!
---
Most weapons have horrifying hip accuracy until you equip the perks that reduce it. If you‚Äôre going for automatic weapons then the auto combat rifle is a fantastic piece of kit to train with: incredibly tight spread, low recoil, fantastic to fire on the move. When engaging players, line up your shot and track it by strafing, and not by turning. This way you stay mobile, and it‚Äôs usually easier to do. Fire in short bursts, don‚Äôt panic and spray. It‚Äôll be good practice against Frogs Legs.
---
I've been using it recently and I love it. Its definitely suits a VATS alternative heavy gunner build
---
Luck doesn‚Äôt increase the chance for better items. And yes, it is way too much work to change the ENTIRE legendary system because of 1/6 of the public teams feature.
---
It currently works as there are legendary enemies in each server, let‚Äôs say there‚Äôs 3 at west tek. Even if I kill them and they respawn they will ALWAYS be legendaries in that specific server, no matter what. The only things that change are the number of stars, it‚Äôs random each time they respawn
---
Hunting should be changed to extra XP for enemy kills. This way it would have a similar total outcome to building and events teams.
---
I mean... I really want those items
---
Allies yes, quest no, they will be troubled like when you finish an Allie story
---
That's one reason I was already pissed.......online fallout...good idea..poorly executed...im not hating on the game....but just coming from the other fallouts ...its just so.....empty? I applaud the effort and not giving up on the game but it just don't really feel like fallout to me. But hey what does one mans opinion matter. cheers buddy
---
Well pvp game is essentially a competitive sport and if there‚Äôs no fairness there no fun. The pvp in FO76 survival mode and adventure is toxic because it‚Äôs essentially shitty individuals using duped bs to gain advantage over honest players, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs unplayable to most people. People don‚Äôt hate pvp, people don‚Äôt like being taken advantage of by scummy players. Give everyone a handmade/similar weapons and equal equipment and perks in NW, tons more people will play it.
---
Yeah I brought up how maybe it could have a 30% chance to stagger and with the perk I mentioned a above it get a 45% chance to stagger and a 9% chance to stun an enemy (causing them to ragdoll on the floor for a bit) which increases to 27% when using a VATS critical shot in another comment.
---
Because this sub could be full of positivity instead of people constantly bitching........seriously how many posts were there about the double wall thing......
---
The one you shut to slow down the ghouls long enough for a reload! Damn, I knew something was missing from my 76 experience, and you nailed it on the head!
---
I am not spending screws to make cork. It's like scripping a bloodied Tesla to get some scrip and roll for a nocturnal Bowie knife.
---
Add some rockabilly lol

Abandoned bog town

This is the one I found for 76: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/57LsyX2aSg5n8v9LMRYYnC?si=TxpUTZiZQKaYgbR4CfYTxQ
---
And this is the one I made: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4kn0snvxQ4gerZr5rlrtU8?si=bP4y973TTyGAMX7Enbs93Q
---
The 76 playlist is very long, mine is about 5 hours. It sounds more like a cross between 3, 4, and New Vegas.
---
Yeah, legendaries are too uncommon and give too little xp for it to be worthwhile at all. But the increase would have to be low, maybe 5-10%extra xp per kill, per bond
---
Try the small axe.
---
My camp budget is maxed out. I get no enjoyment at all out of tearing down and rebuilding the same fucking camp over and over and over. So no,  I don't care about new camp items, not unless they increase the camp budget which doesn't appear to be happening anything soon. And yes, I know about the upcoming instanced camps.  At this point it's irrelevant because it exists only as an idea which doesn't help anyone's current situation.
---
I honestly use it to get rid of my missles and grenade launcher ammo since I don‚Äôt use it, and no one is buying that crap. The points don‚Äôt expire, and I can use them EVENTUALLY to get some quick bullets... maybe.
---
Doing it on a private server is essentially the WORST way to do it.
---
You're far better off picking a few spawns to check and then server hopping.  Both times this challenge has popped up it took me two server hops and I didn't even leave Landview Lighthouse.
---
Oh I know lol, I wanna buy one from someone
---
Oh I figured that but it just personally pisses me off I get really involved in games fallout especially. So now I'll go back to 4 3 and NV and let this bastard collect digital dust for awhile again till I become unpissed.
---
Fuck Molerats.
---
By 2103 I'd say it's probably 12th wave lol.
---
I really like the stalker idea. It would be real nice if that was how stalker worked from the get go. Probably lower the dmaged boost to 10% per second and cap it at 50%.
---
Because bethesda acts like the want to listen to the community, and when they do, they always fuck up whatever it is
---
Oh shit, thank you for the heads up. I was about to move camp and build a Fletcher's emporium.
---
Damn......
---
Why another post bitching about other people bitching?
---
I was wondering when he would show up....
---
Ahahah nailed it.
---
Nah not even close. 
---
Well worth a buy.  Solid game.
---
thats the internet in general
---
You can 100% email Bethesda and let them know about the issues that you find....instead of 100+ people complaining about the same thing I‚Äôm sure Bethesda has people who keep up on forums and subs but how much of that get back to them who knows. They can‚Äôt just instantly snap a finger and fix stuff at will.
---
Pretty sure you‚Äôre thinking of the wrong location
---
You serious, Clark?
---
I was mistaken, my apologies. 
---
The only place I know of that generates *Cave* Fungus is from the Communist Collectron.
---
I don't know which route would be cheaper. They may also be trying to ground the game more in reality with real world music.
---
Wow I love stalkers and mutants. Berserkers is waaaaaaaaaaaay to overpowered. That one needs some work. Maybe 50% dmg resist like emergency protocols in PA. AA is already popular enough tbh. 
---
Those are my two cents fwiw
---
That‚Äôs what my own research yielded. It‚Äôs a shame, really.
---
I would piss off the book depository in the sink so much....
---
Wooooosh
---
Mean talk makes me nervous too.
---
Tnx mate, appreciate it!
---
Maybe they were trying to stop people from cheating.
---
Because they are there to make money and move on they will do just enough to keep people playing and that‚Äôs it. Fallout 76 will never be like ESO or anything like it...I mean look at Destiny that game was and still is fucked from the get go....they only care enough to to get your money.
---
Riddle me this batman, if they're fully willing to fudge the numbers by just automatically pumping the count up then why did they have to go and lower the goal for concrete?
---
Bullshit conspiracy theories like this fall apart pretty quickly when you put more than five seconds of thought into them.
---
I believe they did say something about they are working on some sort of mod system
---
I was just at Hornwright estate today and there‚Äôs a weight room on top floor with a lot of weights. Lot of robots but wasn‚Äôt too tough aside from the assaultron...
---
Ew a Caesar's legion edgelord.
---
My favorite is Dane compound. Three spawn points and so many people go there that they spawn frequently (for bobbleheads)
---
Another comment bitching about people bitching‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Show me on the doll where the bush wookie touched you.
---
Happened to me on xbox the other day. Just waited a couple minutes and I could respawn.
---
Be honest. What is there to do in this game right now other than grind for bullion and buy new gear with it?   There's not much else  to do, so why not just grind for the bullion and buy the damn plans  and see if you like the weapon or not?
---
Nah, the BOS loves kiss ass wanna-be's like Russell.  He will fit right in until he talks back or doesn't open the door for somebody... then we will find his corpse in a ditch.
---
[https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Luck](https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Luck)
---
" Luck has always been a useful stat and, even though its only directly affected statistic is **critical hits**, it has other functions as well. **It affects the value of loot** when **opening chests** or **looting corpses** so it greatly affects the quality of items and capability in earning money. "
---
There isn't a complicated legendary system, i don't really understand why it would be hard to add a % chance for a second one dropping off every legendary creature. They already added legendaries to every event, it wouldn't even break the system considered you get showered in them anyways and you have limited scrip.
---
Wouldn't be complicated or hard to add a % chance for a second one having a chance at dropping nor would it break balance since you get more than you can sell anyways. Most legendaries are vendor fodder.
---
I‚Äôll help i‚Äôm 83 just failed it when i tried to solo üòì
---
Between two possibilities of "people are just doing the event" and "massive conspiracy by bethesda to rig an event for no specific reason" you think THAT is the simplest explanation?
---
Then find a new game bud....ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I agree except 1 I play video games to escape from life and 2 IRL my eyes don't freeze while I'm inspecting a robot that someone I know is going into
---
From what I know there are some mods u can use just not very big ones
---
Man, now I gotta go wash my mind's eye.
---
I've used lever action against her and I find the damage wanting. I mean it does the job, but most of the time SBQ is flying and I don't want to be trying to vats it the whole time. 
---
What works best for me as junkies non auto rifle is a prime junkies laser rifle with split beam and prime junkies gauss. But i like the feeling of holding the trigger down of a heavy weapon more for sbq.
---
Great job Bethesda. Since the goal will be reached anyway, I'm not goona donate any materials from now on.
---
Sleeping dogs and stuff...
---
I was doing the old bush wookie thing on xbox and what do I see????
---
A guy flying through the air like superman only he's moving like he's swimming through water.
---
He kills me as I'm trying to get to a new bush and I then watch him play as he Flys all around swimming through the air.
---
So cheating going on  on xbox
---
You sound like the shittiest supervillain ever
---
But wait, hear him out. He might give us a new hat or something. 
---
All we need to give him is 15 million ballistic fiber.
---
There‚Äôs a 76 section on Nexus for mods. They aren‚Äôt much; mostly texture changes, sound changes, and then useful stuff like Perk Loadout Manager.
---
Found none while questing and doing events while checking the usual spawns, travelling to locations with multiple spawns bunched together, then even spent almost an hour server hopping at a spot with 2 spawns in close proximity. Still 0 bobbleheads. It should be a weekly objective at the very least.
---
Yea. 100%. Screen went bonkers for me
---
Hacked weapons are a whole different beast, and they really piss me off.
---
A legacy will hit for 1-2k, glitched hit for 50k full auto.
---
I‚Äôm a Lone Wanderer.
---
I think this suggestion has merit, but I'd do it slightly differently; don't have it be connected to your main stash, and instead have it be a separate weight capacity for each type of item.  For example, an ammo box that can store 100lbs of ammo separate from your 800lb stash capacity, but you need to go to your camp to get it, so keep any you want easily accessible in your main stash.  Maybe for weapons it's not by weight at all, but each camp weapon display can hold 1 weapon and not have that weapon counted against your stash weight limit.  Etc.
---
The idea being that it's the equivalent of a stash increase, but things like ammo, for which there are only a few different types and all the game needs to store is the quantity, you can hold quite a bit more, and things that are less specific and more data intensive like weapons, you only get a few due to camp limitations.
---
Bruh we've been vocal about things since day one and still haven't been addressed. Their latest patch hear outright lies about what's actually fixed. Either that or their so incompetent as devs they don't even know
---
I hear you on this. 
---
What I was wondering was observations on whether a stock gatling laser out perform an explosive gatling laser that does not have a damage buffing first star effect? 
---
I ask this because on my explosive laser rifle, I find I do significantly less compared to non explosive vs queen. It nerfs damage numbers to very low. But i find that explosive laser rifles show low numbers versus regular scorchbeasts but can kill them reliably, even better than non explosive, though with a little more shots that I'd like.
---
The other problem is that there are not really any good cards that work with most other weapon pre fixes. A lot of perks and mutations stack with bloodied so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so good
---
Here's a tip for people.  Rule 7 exists.  Trying to spread a conspiracy theory that Bethesda rigged the entire event just for the sake of it is about as unverified a rumor as you can possibly get.
---
If they wanted to "fudge" the numbers they've already proven that they're willing to lower unrealistic goals so challenges can actually be completed.  
---
Just because you're still salty over double sided walls or whatever else is pissing you off doesn't mean the rest of the playerbase gives a shit about your little boycott and isn't just turning in cork for the sake of the reward.
---
Nowhere. He just stared at me
---
This game ain't real life tho lol
---
Exactly if I didn't like this game I wouldn't even bother complaining about things I'd delete it and move on but I actually care
---
The berserkers with maybe 2 seconds of no damage taken would be good
---
Whatever direction they decide to go, I really do hope that their arrival is not at all how Russell expected it to be.  Darker would be a good change of pace.
---
Destiny has so many functions I wish 76 had
---
How did you get a fixer from outside the purveyor 2 weeks ago
---
There are no workbenches within miles of the Monorail elevator.  If you have FO1, you can drop a tent and scrap them, but if not.. get ready for a very long and boring walk overencumbered.
---
I'd go for the lucky hole mine with excavator armor.  You can net 800-1000 lead from one pass if you are thorough.
---
Create a new character.  Run to Flatwoods.  Do the quest for learning to boil water.  Level up.  Log in the next day.  Do the quest for cooking a steak.  Level up.  Repeat.
---
I dont find it tedious. I‚Äôm level 601 with about 2800 hours played and I level 1-2 times a day just in the course of playing. Between events and just roaming around killing stuff it‚Äôs pretty easy. I think it depends on how you play the game. I have friends that I usually play with that find it a grind to level every day but they mostly just hang around and chat and mess with their camp and stuff.  So I can see how some people feel that way. I think that if they wanted to eliminate that feeling for the people that casually play then make the level challenge a weekly only. 3 times a week isn‚Äôt hard even if you‚Äôre just casual.
---
Next time don't be so ugly.
---
What do you make with cork anyways?
---
I have a feeling the BoS, with their lack of trust of the world as a whole, will, at least initially, be a very dark and destructive force
---
That deserves 1000 karma.
---
Cool thanks def going to look out for that armor effect
---
Aha! There's a tool for this. [Akarnokd's damage calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) should help. Damage numbers shown on the screen are pretty weird sometimes. I find that some numbers easily kill an enemy while at other times under similar circumstances it takes three times as many hits.
---
If anything that makes it more accurate. Bethesda had let the numbers sit at probably accurate amounts the first few days of the concrete event. Upon seeing there was no way in hell they could bs people into believing that people dropped off 135 Million concrete in one day, they lowered the goal.
---
You can see they learned their lesson. Now, with another nearly impossible goal they decided to bs it from the beginning. If they increase it by a similar amount each day they can pretend like its accurate, accomplish the goal and praise themselves via their community. All without being blatantly obvious with their number fudging.
---
I had nearly 1k concrete but less than 500 cork, they aren't getting more than half my stockpile.
---
The Ghoul. ‚ÄúThriller dance‚Äù.
---
If you're going to immediately drop them then why pick them up in the first place?  You're not saving yourself any time just spamming to pick up everything in sight if you're just going to have to go  through your inventory and dump the shit you don't want afterwards.
---
That‚Äôs just how reddit is
---
They should do that for the next Halloween event
---
I just meant in terms of mechanics, they work the same way. Obv wildly different damage numbers tho (hacked 50cals can pretty easily get 3000 per shot (and 600 from the explosion, or around 900 with explosive perk), giving it 6000 or so damage per shot, and with 200 fire rate and magic effects thatll instakill anything in the game.)
---
But they function in the same general way, being that theyre explosive and have a beam splitter. 
---
I think hacked weapons make cool display items, and if youre using them on a private server i dont care but if you bring them to public servers, especially pvp, youre a dick.
---
Also my math is probably wrong but idk exactly how they work, thats just from how i understand it
---
I'm so flattered !
---
Yes
---
My headset has a mute switch makes things pretty easy!
---
It also doesn't show it in absolutely any of the other images that actually show the outfit being used in game though.
---
Just shoot it with bullets.
---
All weapons are degrading faster. I am sure of it because I am spending waaay too many repair kits on them.
---
I didn't read the other comments. But, why don't you make an alt charac. Go to the ash heap and get it again. Hand it off to a friend and he gives to your main. At least that's how I would do it. Isn't it just up on the roof tops down in the Berkeley area?
---
Yeah, that's probably too much immunity. But remember, this build would become much less valuable in a situation without any adds. And it would LOSE value in a group setting, since the group may end up killing off any adds during a boss fight much more quickly, leaving you high and dry. Not that there's really that much endgame content that would apply to this right now.
---
I‚Äôd love to watch more videos on hidden or glitched places
---
I do level my other characters, my other characters are not ‚Äújust‚Äù bank alts.  All your suggestion really accomplishes is reward players for only using one character because you get around all the restrictions.
---
Dual Wielding Power Fists and Gauntlets....
---
Purveyor has it in the bathroom and basement mine tunnels also.  Neon green mushrooms.
---
The ammo from ace is amazing. I use to not really have the one pick up stuff but then I got the commie one and it was awesome because it picked up so many blood packs and with chemist and super duper I never had to find tick blood to craft stims or buy then again. Then I picked up ace and glad I did the amount of ammo and scrap guns I get is awesome.
---
So this ‚Äúghoul dance‚Äù. Would it be laying down/standing in place, followed by stumbling and shambling, with a final jumping lurch in the air?
---
Idk it might be legit, I‚Äôve donated almost 2,000 at this point just from repeatedly running Whitesprings, Hemlock Holes, Collision course, Grafton, Grafton Dam, Grafton Steel, and Eastern Regional Penitentiary these past weeks to collect cork. (Not to mention setting up workshops that have junk piles and putting out collectrons)
---
If this is accurate it would suggest explosive variants do more damage against sbq despite what damage numbers show on screen. Hm.
---
I've started at least two or three new characters, getting to level 10-16. Leveling up is easier with event, legendary enemies, and workshop goals in one day.
---
At least weekly challenges get you 1,500 SCORE.
---
I am aware of that.
---
My rifleman is suffering from it and he never has adrenaline nor gun-fu on.
---
The bug is there, and there is no pattern, no way to prevent it.
---
Yeah, I hit 100 about 3 days ago because of the huge grind during the double xp weekend and let me tell it really takes the wind out of your sails not having SCORE mean anything. I can't get any more atoms or anything from the dailies or weeklies so now I have significantly less to do than before the legendary run AND these double score/more challenges incentives literally mean nothing to me.
---
Go to Camden Park, disarm all the can chimes. They'll give you 9 cans each, which can be scrapped to steel and lead. Also be sure to pick up all the toys and wooden letter blocks while you're there. They also have lead.
---
I personally am not a huge fan of the idea of the cap limit being made bigger, it would only make inflation a much bigger problem. But this is just me, I like to only play on one character.
---
I agree with the plans to a certain extent, no weapon or armor ones but 100% C.A.M.P ones as they do not add an advantage.
---
Same here. 
---
I just threw that shit in my scrap box with all of the other stuff that isn‚Äôt lead and steel.
---
Because of hackers and cheap "tactics" (frog legs, explosives, tesla rifles).
---
Try boiling water three times and the game gets stuck for several seconds. Do an event with a mob of enemies as a bloodied character and you're dead before you know what hit you. Try to jump and shoot over a wall and your gun shoots after you land. It's been awful lately. Add all the crashing and it's amazing people can still play for hours on end. I know it's made me give up quite a few nights when I had planned a long play session. At this point I'm not sure I care so much to be honest.
---
Hammock...only if it comes with a pirate themed camp and outfit!
---
Nope, it‚Äôs glowing fungus. Checked it by collecting and hovering over
---
They'll prevent it by removing the repeatable
---
Without it, NO ONE is done at this ooint
---
Read a few lines further. It literally states that all it does is effect the durability of items you loot. It has nothing to do with legendaries or the types of items you find
---
This is what you can look forward to...

A single Wendigo drops 5-7 screws and there are certain spawns where you're almost guaranteed to find 1-2 a server hop.
---
Me and my enclave buddies joke he's gonna get gunned down by the brootherhood of shit and hes gonna be like "wahhhh no you're the good guys."
---
Do those drop in world or do you always have to craft them?
---
Apologies, they used the same visual I believe.
---
They do, to my knowledge.
---
i was on the same quest a few days ago.  Yeo you need to get a FFR one.
---
Enjoy then, I know lever is not the best option, but I haven't find a good alternative yet and I don't enjoy heavies as much as you I prefer big damage hearts.
---
Anyone ever run into a colossus that wouldn‚Äôt agro with you? Ran into one with a friend a few weeks back. Shoot it punch it.. didn‚Äôt matter it just followed us around so we brought it to the train station and let some lvl 20‚Äôs get some hits on before we dispatched it
---
its all meat piles right now not just ash and goo.
---
None whatsoever, its the easiest build!
---
I still haven‚Äôt found one yet and I‚Äôve launched at least 3-4 nukes, idk why but SBQ also didn‚Äôt spawn. Could be I‚Äôm not dropping the nuke in the right area but I didn‚Äôt want to drop it on Prime.
---
Entire servers will swarm to Encrypted. Start the event but wait on the initial timer to actually START the event.
---
I really do think this should be a focus on the future update. I mean PvP is pretty non-existent. Let us have a dog or a robot to follow us around. Just have them return to camp whenever you enter an event area. I like the idea of different breeds/names too. I would even be fine with having a Mr Handy follow me around for the C-3PO type banter.
---
I play the exact same way, if something damaged me enough to proc my bloodied perks and gear, then I operate as a bloodied build for that situation.

I rock full health the rest of the time, and am still able to take on most things on the map. I chuckle everytime I see a bloodied build die to something insignificant. Trying to maintain a low health bar seems intuitive for the build, but it will more often hinder fight performance rather than help.
---
I don't understand why they cannot compare the camp item placement to the world before it loads you in.  You cannot be within the large circle it a certain distance to other camps for placement anyway.  This should be a simple toggle like team fill in NW.
---
Plus, it saves the 15,000 other things times 25 times if you don't make me click find another world 25 times.
---
Your title is ‚ÄúMake allies like fallout 4 companions‚Äù
---
Companions in fallout 4 were able to: attack, act as a bullet shield, help you carry more equipment. The only reason to not use a companion in FO4 is because of Lone Wanderer.   
---
My point was, as a solo character in the game it‚Äôs already easy enough.  If the companion does anything during combat it‚Äôs going to make the game easier.  
---
Also, as stated by someone else, that defeats the purpose of 76 (which has already been defeated since wastelanders) in that other players are supposed to be your companion.
---
This is like a sinking boat. Everyone rides the sinking boat until the next boat sinking arrives and forgot about the previous sinking boat they were on.
---
I don‚Äôt know...if someone bothered to use the sorry emote I‚Äôd give them the benefit of the doubt. The last guy I saw get a lot of angry emotes at Uranium Fever responded with the ‚Äúpew pew‚Äù firing emote.
---
For over a year I used a bloodied Prime Gatling gun with faster crit meter and 33% vats hit chance.  This was one baddass gun for me.  Why?  It hit like a freight train and conserved ammo while sniping enemies from 200 feet away with 90% accuracy most times.  I recently retired it to my stash and now I run with a BE Gatling.

I bought the bundle I can‚Äôt remember if this came with it. But I did build the little area that comes with it and the statues which is bad ass. Hook it up to a generator it has flames coming out of it. Def one of the best bundles I‚Äôve bought camp item wise. I‚Äôll check in a little see if it came with the spike barricade

I‚Äôll send a request when I can! I‚Äôm not entirely new (lvl 54), but I‚Äôm definitely behind on the story quests cause procrastination and a severe case of ‚Äúoh! What‚Äôs that over there!‚Äù.

Gamertag will be Ghostshark8!
---
Yes!  For scrapping in the field.
---
Why does it matter if people like it or hate on it? Personally I'll never be interested in it, but I recognize there are players who love it. Fine. Go play it. Don't worry about my opinions on a mode that simply is not my cup of tea. If pressed I could name several negative aspects of NW, to me, but who cares what I think if I'm not even playing NW? And why would I wasted my time dumping on something I'm purposely ignoring when I could spend that energy on something I actually like?
---
The barricades are nice, they don‚Äôt actually do anything, but they are a nice wall.  Nothing has attacked them yet for me to say how durable they are yet Though.
---
Check camps and workshops for unlocked lead collectors.
---
Not terribly durable. Just tested it and it took 7 hits from a level 15 Black Diamond (58 damage per strike).
---
It works well for what it is, just a fence basically. It doesn't do anything other than look cool, as it doesn't deal damage like a punji board.
---
Battle royal doesn't belong in fallout. I play NW and it's worse than fortnite. Just going to point out nothing you said makes it true just cuz you said it. Everyones opinions are different.
---
I love stalkers so much dude. Sniping needs something exactly like that

We need more cap sinks, not more ways to avoid paying caps for things.

Question about junkies. If I take the drug I‚Äôm currently addicted to does that take away from the junkies damage? Say I‚Äôm addicted to mentats and take a mentats will I put out less damage
---
Human npc's are also in the game now you can even have one in your camp and choose their clothing.
---
Oh taming animals but you probably knew that one as it was there since the beginning ^^
---
Brotherhood of steel is being built right now!
---
Yeah, this seems far more reasonable. I was trying to get maximum value all the time by operating at 20% and coming out of stealth like the predator and yelling ‚Äúit‚Äôs go time, bitches!‚Äù before I frantically mash Vats....accidentally target a super mutant next to me....and proceed to blow his and my head off.
---
It was posted about a ton yesterday
---
It's due to every1 grabbing them, I was on at the dailey change over and quickly went to one that I knew of and completed it real fast
---
I was on vacation sorry
---
Finally, someone had the courage to say something
---
So how does it work when you finish? Do you still have dailies but you don‚Äôt get awarded anything except caps, scrip and treasury notes if applicable

Winning NW gives more exp, which in turns leads to gaining levels, unlocking cosmetics for adventure mode, completing score challenges, etc. I don‚Äôt care about winning for the sake of it, but I do like unlocking level ups.
---
They reset 24 hours after you do them.
---
Sorry I was being sarcastic, I think they need to stay away from radio hosts if they're not going to have an integral part of the storyline or at least a good side quest.
---
I really would have preferred they do something with raider rose instead of bringing this new girl on for a radio dj.
---
I like the zealot‚Äôs/ghoul idea. Those are niche weapons for sure that I always dump in the machines.
---
I played for 4 hours today and even with server hopping I never found one. I just thought it was glitched today. Oh well. Hope all challenges tomorrow go well!
---
Maybe even make it smaller like a gumball machine. With less vending slots maybe 20 instead of 30.
---
No they do not.  They reset at 8pm EST.
---
Your ally daily is on a 24 hour timer.
---
You only get 1 raider daily per day.  When you first do them they give you both.  After that it is 1 per day.
---
dunno, but theres free Nuka Coala
---
I use a AA Fancy Shotgun from the claim tickets. I also carry a instigating fixer and zealot minigun.
---
It took me a minute to figure out why you wanted electric McNuggets.
---
Explosive shotguns and they way they interact with the Enforcer perk, got changed in the most recent patch. It's an undocumented change, so we have no idea if it's intentional or not.
---
Before, the explosive damage itself also counted towards the crippling effect of Enforcer. So you could just shoot at the ground, and the mini explosions would cripple the legs of all the enemies stood there.  
---
This doesn't work anymore. Now, the shotgun pellets themselves have to actually hit the limbs you want to cripple. Shooting the ground for the AOE explosions and damage no longer causes the crippling effect.
---
Fallout 1st still gets unlimited Junk, but non 1st members get the scrap box and weight limit is shared with normal stash, then scrapboxes are linked account wide. or hell make everyone get unlimited scrap, idk.
---
We have 12 more New Republics, but that's not that point. It's the principle.
---
solved it. had to connect an hdmi to another monitor i had and it would show on both screens, then i just disconnected the hdmi and played on laptop. after a couple times launching it didnt have to even use the laptop anymore. no idea how this works but hey, problem solved.
---
Even if it just opened the corresponding tab to the universal stash I‚Äôd be ok with. Wardrobe opens right to apparel, ammo can right to ammo, etc
---
Oooof

No, it'd start with a T-pose then you lay on the ground and slide around and back to a T-pose

Love the idea of different play styles for different prefixes, here‚Äôs a few of my own:
---
Mutant: the radiation resistance of targets bit by this weapon is reduced by 20% for each mutation you currently have for 7 seconds.
---
Stalker: on a successful hit in VATS, deal additional damage proportional to the % hit chance (the higher chance, the more damage you deal).
---
[INSERT COOL NAME HERE]: replaces Nocturnal. During the day, deal additions energy damage that adds a burning effect. During the night, deal additional energy damage that adds a cryo effect.
---
All enemy specific prefixes: in addition to the +30% extra damage, you slow their movement by 50%.
---
Extra endurance would be the most popular one if it weren't for the get xp repeatable. Extra hp is always good.
---
That‚Äôs so yesterday
---
I‚Äôm too damn old and my signing voice sounds like an owlet caught in an electric blender.
---
I respectfully disagree with you. For me at least the game works adequately and by far my #1 complaint with the game is the lack of stuff to do. After Wastelanders it eventually becomes a boring and mindless grind. Plus I know Bethesda is good at story writing based on Wastelanders, Far Harbor, and F3 so I love story content. Plus I‚Äôd love some new events and Expeditions (even though we know very little about them) couldn‚Äôt come soon enough imo
---
The Electric Nugget
---
I was lucky enough to buy one from somebody a long time ago (it cost me nearly 20000 caps but it was worth it!)
---
I don‚Äôt even bother when I see that
---
all laser rifles have really bad durability, and for some reason ultracite lasers are really impotent. it really is too bad because i have a decent B25 id like to use, but every time i pull it out, im reminded why it stays in the box.
---
Something they did in 21 has borked all the "pile" models. Using the survival tent glitch at LitS that already risks client and server crashes on top of it, is like gasoline into an oil fire.
---
That‚Äôs completely normal for the raiders. When you first meet the raiders you can do both of their daily quests, however every day afterwards it‚Äôs going to be one or the other unless you skip one day. If you skip one day both dailies should be available for you to do.
---
I have a Junkies LMG and have been having fun with it, but didn't notice anything crazy about it. Is this a gun with a lot of end game appeal?
---
If they‚Äôre never actually gonna give us pets, just give us a Dogmeat Collectron skin. Make the Collectron station a doghouse, the actual collection hatch the dog bowl, and the Collectron is replaced by Dogmeat wandering around your camp, sniffing and grabbing junk/food/dog toys.
---
I'm sorry but that isn't what happened to Anthem at all. They poured tons of money into the development of that game. It had an absolutely massive development team and 6 years to develop it. 
---
  
---
It failed because of leadership couldn't decide on what game it wanted to make. There is a very very in-depth article on this [How BioWare's Anthem Went Wrong](https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964). 
---
&gt;I‚Äôm extremely curious what games you think creates an online structure with the dozens of extra upkeep costs required to operate and then lets it die.   
---
Clearly games like Anthem and Artifact were left to die. Anthem has not received any major updates or overhauls [BioWare says Anthem‚Äôs overhaul will be a long process](https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/15/21260427/anthem-next-rework-update) so I'm not sure what you mean when you said " has been updated to unrecognizable levels to turn a profit". That just isn't an accurate statement.
---
FO76 is doing fine. You're right. So I don't know why you think it also "needs to release updates to stay afloat" as if its in some dire straits situation.
---
20k?!?!. That's not even close to worth it. It's only worth 700 caps and can be farmed if ya know where to look, why sell it for that freaking much? Now you're just robbing people
---
Pretty sure I remember reading somewhere that you only get 90% of sales.
---
Not sure why tho...
---
You made my day thanks
---
Zero
---
No one sells it for 700 caps
---
So, you complete the legendary run then nothing.   Right now you still get the listed dailies and weeklies, but no reward at all.  Let‚Äôs give us some extra motivation for playing.   I have five characters and already have everything plan wise from the foundation and raiders.    No need for more bullion
---
Legendary run is complete 
---
Now what.    I am just lucky I can play four hours a day at work usually as well as a bit at home.   Now, no motivation to keep playing.    Rewards are non existent.  We need som of the percentage of dailies put into atoms as well
---
In all fairness I was at max caps so I didn‚Äôt have a problem with buying it for that much, plus I had no idea that you could even farm it I figured it was just a really lucky find.
---
Check out the word doc posted in this thread a while back. It explains all the loot and container respawn rules and a ton of places to farm junk.
---

---
Mine were not available until well after 7pm central. I've been playing all night, and they didn't pop until over an hour after that supposed reset.
---
That's the way it's always been. You get 90% of the caps for stuff you sell in vending machines. Also, who is paying 500 caps for s'mores recipes?
---
I got to 89 today, guess I‚Äôll slow down
---
Weird I am on CST and when I logged in at 710pm they were ready to go as I traveled to each area to get tbem.
---
There is no 'community'.
---
Apart from a few people at a time on one thread in this sub and a few people in a team or on a server in one session there really isn't a community. The word is over used by players and Bethesda alike, it alludes to something that doesn't exist.
---
You are alone voice crying in the wilderness my dude.
---
I wasn't thinking about it...and now I can't stop thinking about it. Well played sir.
---
Yeah, great weapon! Loving my Vampires Gauss Shotgun at the moment too!
---
there was mods available during beta, those guys work fast. get yourself on Nexus mods and there's a heap of improvements to be had. mainly perk load out manager, it's a literal game changer.
---
I think they should all have their own XP bonuses plus an additional SPECIAL bonus. That would make them more worth it as a feature, but rebalanced to make all of them situationally useful. Building and Event would probably still be the most useful though
---
Unlikely, most probably all ages groups, it is the internet.

To attempt to remove caps from the game, in a glitch free game they would have value, in this, just give the 100 percent

Meanwhile, regular armors haven't received any skins with new meshes, except for the ghillie skins from the pass.

How about mutants increases mutation by 10 percent? Jump higher with marsupial,  more damage resistants for scaly skin?
---
Just toss em. I mean do you absolutely have to hit something with em? Just throw them around.
---
I want a cryo legendary attribute edit: and a new perk line to make it better, what about legendary attributes that come with a negative modifier that can fixed with perks?
---
Around 8-10k
---
Those crickets absolutely hate baby owls. Why the hell is an owl in a cave like that anyway?
---
Except it's already in the files, unused, at least for now, and it's a standalone weapon.
---
Or have a low level 10mm to switch to just for cases like this. It just takes a minimal effort to have a non-spec'd side arm to tag things with.
---
Since we can‚Äôt craft them with Legendary Modules like with Gauss weapons what good is the plan? I legit want to know, not being sarcastic
---
Atom shop purchase
---
Try The Deep. Its a location uncovered in the Settlers quest line. Im not sure if you can enter it before doing it though.  Ive seen cave Fungus in game somewhere and I think it was there.
---
I have two that I really love and they‚Äôre actually by the same person: Survivor Story: Colonel. His first version is so heart wrenching, he‚Äôs experienced the end of the world and regrets the things he‚Äôs done...all he wants is his dad to come home, it was the first holotape I actually decided to listen to besides the Overseers and it drove me to tears. I didn‚Äôt know he had a second one for months, this was back when the game first dropped, but one day I was just going through flatwoods getting junk when I came across the second one, I was so happy to hear that he changed. He grew up and he joined the responders and he was happy. Of course you know that he‚Äôs obviously dead so it‚Äôs tragic but also it gives you hope.
---
Be nice to get a small amount of atoms for dailies again after completing the leg run
---
Yes üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª

And two days into this the sub would be full of posts demanding more content.

i price them at 5k

Well their clearly still worth something seeing as I was screwed out of one just two days ago. Freaking hate scammers.

It could work, just name your camp "Shady Sands"
---
You‚Äôll get side comments from the unnamed NPCs if you keep the gold from one side or the other, Meg and Paige will have dialogue for you if you gave them the gold or if you gave it to the others. I haven‚Äôt done a shared play through yet so I don‚Äôt know what they say if you agree to share.
---
Ah, that's good to know. Interesting that they have wendiglow skin but not the ActorTypeGlowing keyword.
---
People have talked about this for forever. Yet Bethesda hasn‚Äôt listened.
---
I usually just go there and plop open a public group and start the event and feed the machine. I usually get a couple of people joining in. But yeah it seems unpopular, radiation rumble as well.
---
Beth has always taken 10% off the top.
---
I always try to share the Travel Agent perk whenever I‚Äôm on a team, but I agree that there should be some form of price reduction.
---
All the effort to design a huge outdoor area + player instance, and that is just sitting there, slowly getting outdated.
---
Pro Tip to all the players who don‚Äôt have all the time in the world to play:
---
1. Create a new Character
---
2. Keep joining public teams upon exiting the vault until someone has a camp or themselves near Watoga (if no team has this, leave and join a new server)
---
3. Fast travel as close to Watoga as possible and discover all locations by running around the city
---
4. Fast travel to another player or camp and discover 2-3 locations and you will level up to level 3
---
5. Collect your 250 Score
---
This way you rank up without ever firing a bullet. Depending on finding a player or camp to travel to, you can have the level up challenge done in 5-15 mins
---
Some people just hate pvp on principal and get upset when enticed to play pvp modes.    
---
Im not into pvp much myself but I'm not gonna be rediculous about it.  I suck at NW but it's still fun.
---
Honestly? No. Gauss minigun? Yes.
---
Speaking of borderlands....I‚Äôd love a feature to mark my guns/armor as trash, please. Save me hours of scrolling through stuff I‚Äôve already decided I don‚Äôt want but don‚Äôt remember the name of.
---
I bought one for 7777k last week finally. They are hard to find in shops üôÅ
---
theyre probably never gonna make it free
---
maybe like 80-90%?
---
They're not sitting around in the lumber mill.  I butchered them all.
---
I just buy the bulk ammo scrap when athena comes to visit me.
---
Never been low on screws since.
---
I know, but even then, you can farm it even if it is rare, anything past like 3k caps is robbery
---
It's the only way to get fixers to drop from purveyor or legendary enemies. Without it your at the mercy of others when your trying to get one.
---
&gt; I've seen more than enough of Sofia in her undies by now.
---
I just can't shake these nightmares.
---
I could really care less about visiting places in previous Fallout games with the EXCEPTION of perhaps Fallout 1 or 2. Imagine and expedition with intelligent deathclaws? Expeditions should be to places that would not be a full setting for a future Fallout release. I think Northern Ohio could be interesting with Lake Erie, Rock and Roll/Pro Football HOF and whatnot. Virginia has some history as well and there is always Virginia Beach.
---
I thought they did give rose a radio station?

but fast travel means you are not exploring, just revisiting.

Because the makers of the game you play are spending time and resources on a mode you don't play
---
Idk why someone downvoted you, but I got you back to 1
---
Apparently we didn't nuke hard enough, member.
---
I mean, you still get caps, item rewards and treasure notes from the dailies that are from Davenport, Ward in Foundation, and the two at Crater, as well events, but we want more !!
---
Agreed, I also feel like Wastelanders is a sort of prequel for things to come. Especially with all the new lone wandering NPCs spread throughout the wasteland. For example..
---
Gnash questline where he starts a new Raider group or joins the Blood Eagles and becomes their new leader
---
Mariam Ayari questline where she becomes the new Mayor/Warlord of Watoga and possible rival of the Brotherhood of Steel
---
A lot of these new NPCs could easily be turned into mini side questlines
---
Only value for them is having the less than 1% chance to get a drop from purveyor and events.
---
must just be bugged out for you in that instance. she's been going down faster and faster every time I go to the event. lately she's been dropping health so fast she doesn't heal at all. average kill time is about 1-2 minutes, 30 seconds of she lands.
---
Only if I‚Äôm paid in treasury notes and can donate my reward for a little more rep.

There's also conduits

I‚Äôve gotten over 30+ pieces with ammo weighs less. Weapons weigh less. 90% reduced weight. Which are all useless to me because they won‚Äôt give me u yielding.
---
He should be a boss that roams the wasteland. Searching for a one on one PvP. A player chooses to fight. Should the player lose. The player loses 20 atoms. If the player wins it gets the 25 percent of the pot of atoms "The Todd" has collected from his win streak. Make him really hard to defeat. Whatever game mechanic. But the enticing carrot is that prize of atoms that keeps rising and rising from the many defeats. A staff in one hand make it so he cracks the ground while shouting it just works. Other hand holding a golden bag of atoms held up in the air.
---
&gt;  I bought the plans and crafted one
---
I‚Äôve had all kinds of unyielding and bolstering and all that good stuff, but not a reduced weight of any kind
---
I did 5 SQB fights this evening an we put her down in a decent amount of time.  Don't panic.
---
No
---
I always chime in on pistol posts, but I do have some differences of opinion here.
---
We only need one of Crack Shot / Modern Renegade to move to Perception / out of Agility. 
---
We do need more pistol options, including one more suppressor option. 
---
44 and SAR are basically pointless.
---
We need another use for .44 ammo - we need a receiver upgrade for the pipe pistol maybe (so an auto 44 / carbine like).
---
Sword skins...the revolutionary sword looks disgusting. Gauntlet skins for unarmed combat.
---
I get that it differs based on your build. But who wants rads other than a bloodied? I'm not taking of my armor and reapplying it for my desired hp level. I'll go stand in the river. I'm not holding down x repeatedly to get my rads back if I can go stand in my van... Down by the river!!

Eastridge Lookout tower is where I tamed all of my wasteland buddies. Just SE of vault 94 on the map. Handy thing about this location is if you server hop, you‚Äôll spawn right there at the lookout tower and you only have to walk a few steps for the random event to activate
---
That‚Äôs where I got my scorched Deathclaw and mirelurk kings
---
I read some other comments. Todd should be riding in the shopping cart strapped behind the giant super mutant behemoth. Just like in mad max thunder drone. "Who run barter town!?"

I really wanted legendary perks to hell buff things like this or just rework a bunch of the regular perks to have synergy with some of the existing effects. 
---
I like what you are theory crafting here!!
---
With speed demon, the queen isn't a problem.
---
With a high power 3 star plasma Gatling gun, she really isn't a problem.
---
Really I have more trouble with the kings.  Their attacks are too OP.
---
Also, if I'm making cranberry relish for many people, I tend to hit 3 or 4 places for them.  I usually don't have enough gourds at my camp, so I go raid theirs when I'm making them.  :)
---
dog meat exploit in fallout 4 please no
---
Sounds like your camp is in a desirable location, not that your new location has lag
---
Cap sink, caps need to be removed from the world to reduce inflation.  It does not fully work, but maybe helps?
---
How much time did it take to get to lvl 538 and what build do you use? If it's not bloodied and you're not stacking int/xp bonuses in your gear and with food buffs, then it's totally understandable that getting levels is quite a chore. But still, there's literally no problem in getting a level fast (I mean in less than half an hour) even at 600+ if you do it right.
---
I've been keeping track of them, since I'm trying to finish off my Settler rep. Several days ago I did Vital Equipment at 7:30, and the next day it did not activate until after 7:30. I definitely checked between 7:00 and 7:30 for it.

Only practical use was a gnasher grenade on a cave cricket.
---
Weird comment to downvote, honestly. No controversy.
---
It's trash. You have to hold down interaction with it and you get ten rads (wearing armor). I can go to west tek and stack up my goo at 60 rads each if I want rads. The barrel is just a useless cosmetic
---
Lol sounds like it, and I'm glad theres a few events that gather folks like that. But I guess this boils down to wishing for more endgame content
---
I have a bunch of each and usually rock my handmade. It looks better and I have tons of ammo. Like you said the condition bar is about twice the size as well.
---
I enjoy it just sucks being the only 1 there, both my characters can handle it alone, but to be able to get all 3 creatures to survive would be nice
---
Rad Rest with Glowing Blood Packs. sell em use em drop em
---
your choice
---
In my experience there's not much demand for them. I've had two of these plans for sale at 9k each for a few weeks now. I really need the caps for my next serum recipe purchase :(
---
Now I feel like im obliged to start a competing caesar's legion camp on the other side of the dam
---
Encrypitid is way too hard for randoms to do and it's super unoptimized on the Xbox so it's like 4 fps. And honestly I just don't do paradise because it takes too long
---
Damn
---
I definitely agree that it‚Äôs odd. I thought that glow sights worked on them too until I watched Angry Turtles videos on a Colossal Problem, which I highly recommend to anyone trying to prepare to fight Ol‚Äô Earle
---
I wish the weekly challenges had more content and I didn't finish them in a day or two.
---
I sell them for 25 caps like every other plan
---
Thanks i had a 100 saved up
---
Ty. I thought the same but what i could'nt put the finger on, was that my two shot shotgun got nerfed as well.
---
I think that now :the shot only count as one round.
---
Witch match the description of the perck.
---
Now the calcul is as below:
---
1 shot= 1 round = 30% criple
---
But before it was counting all the bullet fired by the shotgun (8 in total)
---
So the calcul was like this:
---
1 shot = 8 round ~ 70% criple
---
Funny enought, with a tw shotgun it was almost guaranted criple.
---
It's sad but it make sens that thing are like this. I still want to ask to bethesda to make it the same as before thought. 
---
I miss the time when i could tbag with teamate on living ghouls corps before beating them to death with barhands.
---
Yeah, the other prefixes need some love.
---
Now you mention it.. my camp has 2 big trees and a sizeable hammock would be a great addition
---
I don‚Äôt run HF at all anymore since it seems to contribute to fast travel bug, but I only run it then on bloodied characters if things ever normalize.
---
Solar appears to be nonstop low level regen, and as I run sun kissed (rads go away in daytime) I tend to be always caped health.  I also eventually have rolled 3 respectable vanguard solar pieces so it‚Äôs a pretty nice combo once things start coming together.
---
The bonus from thorns is, to me, not worth giving up the good pieces I have.  Slight extra damage , slight stealth boost... I dunno just not up my alley but if you get a solid setup let me know how it works out for you!
---
Wallpapers not working.

You don't even have serendipity there. Did you link me the right one? Or you messing with me?
---
How cool would it be to make toilet moonshineü•≥
---
Thsts been the fixers flaw since we got it, perfect in vats but very unforgiving if you ADS. It doesn't seem to matter how you mod it either, it's just raw.
---
I'm a big fan of the combat rifle, outside of vats it will out-dps the fixer any day of the week unless you're at point blank range!
---
Odd a rifleman would have issues with swarms. I used to do rifleman and minimal stealth, had a quad combat rifle and hunting rifle that I would switch between. Actually I still have them, but i respecd to PA heavy guns, mostly gatling gun and 50 cal vamps.
---
You need to be refreshing your item counter to help ensure rare things spawn. Constantly pickup everything while you hunt for loot like this.
---
It‚Äôs lonesome and coldüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
The easiest fix for this seems to be if they path towards the "workshop claim point." Right now they will stop and attack a toilet, because it is considered a tangible asset in the workshop.
---
It bkoz, most have the rewards from there and people don't want to put in all their time and effort to be let down. As you have to rely on others. You need a good solid team to get the top rewards. So find a few people who like to farm events in a team.
---
Tax
---
At the very least, a workbench so I can scrap my excess garbage stuff.
---
Fuck that‚Äôs a lot of phases üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨

Also, you didn't even reply to my argument on having to be full health.

It‚Äôs really sadüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
---
I recommend marking a few places on a map for this My go to bobblehead locale is Relay Tower HG-B7-09 over there in the ash heap right on the top of the bunker at the base of the antenna is where you'll find it
---
Pro tip: don't do them.
---
Wait until the workshop has been overrun and then go and take it back so you only have to kill 1 wave.
---
No unfortunately. You'd need to level a new Master Heavy Gunner card to rank 2.
---
And fyi as far as I know it is the same for all weapons, rank 1 of basic/expert/master are each +10% and +5% after that.
---
Quite possible
---
I got tired of doing it, after 5 times in a row  of it failing because nobody worked together or understood  what to do.  I felt like I can handle a couple areas, but I cant' do all the work, while people just run around shooting things and not knowing how to complete.  Much like Rad Rumble, which these days is just XP runs instead of completing the event. Every so often, I'm in the event with others that know what to do and finish. Those times make me happy :)  
---
That being said, if I see at least 4 others in the event, I will join it.  Just burned on too many one off xp hunters.
---
The one at the groves family cabins solved my challenge. thanks!
---
Yes! A stomp and a shuffle lol
---
Ah yes thanks ü§ôüèº
---
There's one line in the brotherhood radio transmission that sticks out to me.
---
"This is... (pause for static) ...a negotiation." 
---
The only thing that makes sense in that pause is 'not', and given what Maxson is supposed to be like, and the fact that this group is likely a rogue element of his western brotherhood, it seems likely that they, like the eastern brotherhood of Fallout 4, see themselves as having rightful claim to the wasteland. They might still commend Dorsey for his initiative, but I certainly believe they aren't here to become Appalachia's knights in shining armor.
---
NCR AND PROUD
---
Craft them. They are very cheap though and are basically upgraded frag grenades.
---
google fo76map: Hide all: select bobblehead. 
---
Half the battle is knowing the EXACT random spawn points. And just using your already existing routine to look in the "Known" spots nearby. This map/website will help you out.
---
Honestly though it's still a free buff whatever way you decide to use it. You see less teams because most low levels are already so overwhelmed with content. The only reason I run building team is because INT is my 2nd lowest SPECIAL, and I wanted it evened out. I'd prefer Beth keeps their eyes on more pressing issues. I can promise they won't even bat an eye at this, but I get the idea behind it.
---
I mean some already exist on the Nexus and they‚Äôre extremely helpful
---
As a bloodied build, I drink them to increase rads/lower my health just a bit when needed.
---
You need at least one person to be a tank in power armor with stims and first aid perks to regen health from being a conduit.  Takes too long to regen health with the injection animation.
---
Thriller would be so rad
---
They've already got a fix, but it deletes the spacesuit.
---
eh? no thanks, i love doing something different, also bobbleheads are really easy to find
---
Thank you!
---
Given their proximity to Point Pleasant, we could see some conflict between Free Radicals and Mothman Cultists.
---
I do agree that there is often a slew of repetitious complaints whenever a new patch fucks something up, but you can always just close reddit for a bit and do something else. Asking an entire community to change their posting habits just because you don't like seeing what they post is rather narcissistic.
---
I have plenty of folks I play with that are lower levels. Me: "Hey, I invited you to the team again did you get it?" Every friend: "Oh shit, I'm sorry. I'd be right happy to!"
---
You don't need to double spawn, just give % chance to spawn double legendary rewards. 25/50/75/100
---
Hunting feels more rewarding if you feel like you're actually getting a haul. 
---
Otherwise the building int bonus ends up being better for xp grind.
---
The starlet sniper skin is for the lever action rifle. I don't think it's in the store right now, but keep an eye out for it
---
The issue with Project Paradise is that it‚Äôs not player-initiates like Encrypted or Scorched Earth. More people would play it that way knowing that it will consistently show up. People always show up to the SBQ because it‚Äôs player-initiated and we have the three minutes or whatever to get down there.
---
It's a PVP event.  When it was popular I would get murdered by explosive tesla rifles- being a low level with no good gear or teammates I had no counter.
---
I Can‚Äôt comment on a bug causing me to lose my collectible baseball but man I do miss that thing lol.
---
Thanks, I shall!
---
alright thank you, I'll use my caps to buy me a nice treat instead
---
There has been couple in atomshop. Two or three atleast that i remember. They return to the shop quite frequently.
---
I‚Äôve seen someone try to sell 20 bulk cork for 250 caps.
---
You are quite welcome- Love this "tool" this map comes in handy for all sorts of things- I found it originally when looking for a new camp location that had a LEAD resource node I could use.
---
Now that I think about it, there's also a pioneer scout skin and a fancy inlay skin. My advice remains the same, if they aren't in the store right now you'll just have to check in every Tuesday
---
To me exploration should add to carry weight instead of endurance or travel costs. 
---
What's the point of roaming unless you're looting or resource collecting, so extra on character weight would make this highly desirable for anyone not do grinding.
---
There's some really nice Pioneer Scout paint for it that of course is never in the shop...
---
They're all locked up in blueprints. You can try and place the blueprints (if it will let you) or you can delete the blueprints and the individual items will be in your stored tab.
---
Summerville docks has 2 possible bobbleheads, Torrance house has 2 horn Wright summer villa has 1, and overlook cabin has 3. All in the same area and there are like 8 possible spots for magazines in the same locations. The spot most ppl miss is the outer edge of the maze at Torrance house. Get on top and walk the perimeter.
---
I used to have a bloodied one but it was still lame because they set a limit to how much damage you can do in one shot.
---
Honestly I think the all of the fallout songs should be in 76 like all the songs from new Vegas, 4, 3 etc
---
a paragraph of nonsense from someone who doesnt read OP
---
The guns great but get the long barrel mod to get fantastic range bolts.
---
the only negative is the gun takes cartridges and not cores .
---
its not a scorchbeast queen shredder as the mag is standard.
---
What's the per shot limit?
---
With no DJ.

Kinda like how the community ‚Äúasks‚Äù Bethesda to change their update and bug fix habits.....you know you can just turn off your game to rightü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è plus I never said people should change their posting habitsü§î though that would be ideal then I wouldn‚Äôt have to scroll past the same salty posts all the timeüòå
---
Why does the green hood make you bald?
---
War pig power armor skin because it blends well in NW.
---
I just want a skin for every weapon so I can make them not show up at script machine or vendors
---
Sunshine Oil. It's shelf stable, easy to craft if you set up camp in the Ash Heap, and it's one of the best AP restoration items available.
---
What does psa mean,... Sorry I'm new to reddit
---
Actually, did they change the NW one? We haven't had the level up for a while and I'm a ball hair away from 29
---
^ Ding ding.
---
Imagine thinking beating someone in a video game make you tough.
---
Pretty sure the improved repairs to 150% where the regular only repairs to 100%
---
Might be laggy servers. I had a bunch of annoying encounters today while playing. Didn't do SBQ though, so dunno.
---
Plot twist: He's an agent of other tendrils of the Enclave and we're helping prepare them for their reclamation of the White springs. (Why do you think he wanted that much concrete?)
---
I stopped listening to the radio because of her. Thankfully the default ambient music is pretty good.
---
K thx
---
That was such a great expansion - it is honestly is my favorite fallout DLC out of all FO3, FONV, and FO4 DLCs.
---
Well, duh Einstein.  
---
People don't learn in games if you can just reload an earlier save.
---
Thanks for not mentioning where I get mine.
---
I've seen it in vendors before from others selling food and it still spoils over time
---
You can just ask people. I have spoiled meat in my inventory every few hours I just drop.
---
I'd rather go in and learn/live with the mistakes so that my play of game is unique to me. Why copy or find a walkthrough and just puppet my way through it?
---
I haven't played at all since I finished the run.
---
They look like they no longer grow feathers, so they're likely flightless now. Also, burrowing owls are a thing.
---
Ah, I see. That actually sounds kinda fun. 
---
As for me, I‚Äôve decided that I‚Äôm finally going to try out being Bloody but since I play melee, I thought the Thorn armor would be fun. Plus, it‚Äôs a set you just don‚Äôt see enough of imo.
---
Would something like this get you playing at all?
---
No, you wouldn't.
---
Dude I don‚Äôt know why you have to be The one dude shutting the idea down, he didn‚Äôt say it was gonna happen and seeing how lazy Bethesda is it probably won‚Äôt but your comment is unnecessary and unneeded
---
Public Service Announcement
---
Use a shotgun. It counts each pellet for the crit so you end up getting like 8-10 crits with one bar. Really should be a daily.
---
DROP!?!?! all that fertilizer....gone.....
---
Ah thanks
---
I didn‚Äôt know it still gave you challenges after you finished. Bonus caps, atoms, hell even some scrip maybe would be nice!
---
Yeah, I don't hate the new music, but I greatly preferred that music.
---
I have the chicken coop now. I never need fertilizer.
---
Why pistol?
---
Exactly!!!
---
Public teams need to be rethought in general, all you really need is builder and events. What they SHOULD do is invest in a guild system and more options for socialising personally.
---
I recommend any vaults or military installations
---
You should probably look up all the problems this game has before you pull out the "good programmers" card.
---
I already play a rifle and heavy character and don‚Äôt want to convert either to a bloodied build
---
Courier is that you?
---
I use the app MicMute, you can setup the key to toggle, that way I have PUSH TO TALK off and unmute when i want.
---
Idk I‚Äòve seen it in vending machines for thousands so I figured it was rare.
---
Well... It will last the owner maybe 40 levels, so, it would be a good investment.
---
My Instigating pump shotgun lvl 5 was a keeper until I hit level 45. That was before Beth started ruining shotguns.
---
A new camp item! For my camp with the maxed out budget and zero room for new items! Yay!!!  Thanks Todd!
---
The SCORE challenges are worth doing because they are simple. Most will occur while simply playing the game and you don't have to go too far out of your way to do them.  
---
Wanting them to make them harder makes no sense.
---
Imgur is down, sadly.
---
Lol, and they're saying they don't know whether it's gonna be fixed in two more weeks or not after they already tried to address that with the previous patch. I mean, how hard is it to make the plans for the armor work correctly? That level of incompetence...
---
Was heavy gunner in PA but recently moved towards bloodied sneak commando,  so basically a hybrid of the two because I still use alot of heavy guns.
---
Nothing better than retreating to the man cave after a long day of mauling humanoids.
---
Its with the Fasnacht one under floor decor if you'd like to see it.
---
Yup
---
right so instead you make this whiny bitchy post for no other reason than to bitch and moan. real fuckin helpful you are.
---
Quad flechette harpoon gun. You never need to scrounge or craft ammo for it. Counts as a heavy weapon, plays like a shotgun.
---
Being a Chem vendor, I have Ace collect Chem and Alcohol (duh). I‚Äôm also a raider, so he fits in great. I also own the regular collectron, so I can send him out for scrap when I need it. Those were my first 2 Atom shop purchases, and I‚Äôd say they are both worth it if you‚Äôve got the atoms to spare.
---
And Camden park has 4.  I dont think op looked very hard lol
---
Sure don't :(
---
Harpers ferry.  Go to the vendor bot and through the open door near him, there is an open food thing on the wall a few yards in.. right underneath on the ground is 2 moldy food plates.
---
I recently got adopted by a high lvl guy and he helped me with my best gear I have now. He recently gifted me my second bloodied handmade but the second one was explo, with 25k 5.56 ammo. He is truly a great guy.
---
A studio that was gearing up to make free to play mtx games, btw.  And they didn't purchase a failed studio, Battlecry was actually formed as a subsidiary of Zenimax.
---
Do... those count for his challenge?
---
Yes your the one that‚Äôs getting madüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ time for your parents to tuck you in...,maybe you will wake up with a better attitude tomorrow ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
You should have taken your time. 
---
As far as most players and Bethesda‚Äôs setup is concerned. Your done, it‚Äôs over, period. 
---
Keep logging in to play and check weeklies or take a break.
---
Just as unneeded as this post is after OP and I chatted and agreed.
---
Huh, lesson learned. Now, I take this back lol
---
Thank you, I'll look into this.
---
Wait nobody wants to support the Beggarhood of Steel(and other miscellaneous supplies)?
---
The atrocities you commit by not surrendering all your explosive flamers and explosive plasma gats.
---
I loved this dlc as well and honestly the ghost people freaked me out back then, they still do today
---
Edit:Spelling
---
It would for me. 
---
This new system has hinestly burnt me out. I enjoy building most and dailies kept me logging in and playing eniugh to build atoms and get camp items to keep building. 
---
With the dramatic reduction in atoms, and the camp "fixes" they made that destroyed build techniques, i have no motivation to play anymore. Nor do a lot of us builders.
---
Where? I‚Äôd like to see that
---
Thanks! I was dumb not to check the blueprints.
---
I had 3 crashes 4 frezzes and 1 complete game exit
---
I have also have had lag to but mostly in C.A.M.P building
---
Is that new? I've not tried taming in forever. I think a 21 is just going to die...
---
You are ripping yourself off, friend.
---
The 10k price range is about right, for PC at least.
---
Yes yes yes yes. 
---
This game had the potential to be something absolutely awesome. Theyve made every screw up possible along the way.
---
Cork makes everything weigh less (Bethesda physics) so when they're not in their T-60b power armor, they can relax in their lightweight combat armor and play golf or baseball. Or fly around in their lightweight vertibirds.
---
My solution is to be on a team for the fight (public teams help) if you cant respawn, close then reopen game and it let's you join your team (rejoining the server). Not the best solution but allows you to get loot from imposter and your dropped junk
---
mad? no. you're clearly the one with the problem with this bitchfest of a post. the irony is palpable
---
It's a game mode inside of a game and it's not marketed at all. It's pretty much pushed onto players who prefer PvE. The vast majority of the people who bought 76 didn't buy it for PvP.
---
It's for all the whine bottles, that'll be full by the end of this event, when the Beggarhood of Steel arrives and steals all the nuclear keycards.
---
If plans became accountwide, they'd rarely ever sell and it's one of the most vended items probably just under ammo. 
---
As for the gold, caps and scrip - the vast majority of players will never hit max and never need a mule or an alt. So outside of hoarders or market sellers, not sure how many people really would need this. 
---
I understand the inventory grind, been around since BETA, eventually you learn to let go or adjust your build and most of this is less relevant.
---
No money in that
---
I‚Äôll be on in roughly a half hour!
---
He didn‚Äôt agree the post was unneeded you fuckwit, he said it was a pipe dream, most of the comments agree it‚Äôs a really cool idea and you have to come in like a little bitch and shit on it
---
I know some people have posted picture of pets over 21 but I've tamed dozens of things and not a single one has been a higher level when it reached my camp. All my deathclaws have lived for weeks but right now I've got a level 5 rad toad.
---
I'm wondering if it's going to be similar draught in the weeks between score runs.
---
Came across a trap camp with bearskin rug spiral staircases.  Pretty cool looking, like vertebrae.
---
Lately, when I go to Westek, and someone's already been through, there's skilled meat where the unlooted mutant hound bodies were. There's also random dead cows in the forest.
---
Hell, make it something you can collect/trade!
---
I recall running into a Blood Eagle camp right in the middle of a road. It was overrun with bloodbugs and everyone stationed there was dead. What I found interesting, however, is that they were collecting people's home videos... watching them.
---
It would be quite easy and lore-friendly to add/re-purpose an NPC who collects holotapes/records with songs on them. It could be Julie, the Appalachia Radio DJ, for all I care. As you collect these songs, you would turn them in to her and she'd add them to her playlist... naturally expanding the song catalog and adding an interesting new system to the game.
---
EDIT: I like this idea so much, I officially submitted it as a suggestion.
---
Sorry man, that‚Äôs the point I was making. It‚Äôs more fitting of a weekly, since that spreads out the RNG. Hitting known spots and not finding them for hours is not any idea of fun.
---
Teslas aren't an issue at all.
---
The main issues on console is the lag and explosives. A lot of my friends quit because of those two reasons.
---
This
---
Nice! Sounds like it‚Äôd be right up my alley!
---
this right here is peak whiny bitch post, OP is just so enamored with the taste of boot that he doesnt realize it.
---
that, or OP is just a kid and this is D tier troll bait.
---
either way, this post will get nuked, as it should be.
---
Were playing tic tac toe while this person is playing 3 dimensional chess.
---
Have you tried swapping servers or is it happening every time?
---
If you're on PC the known workaround is a replacement mod, I use "Pile Replacements - Toxic Mutagenic Waste and Glowing Variants" from Nexus.
---
Thought I'd actually share the link
---

---
How dare you question them or their methods. Gather that hi tech cork and hope you are spared the fury of our mighty metal gods.
---
Do you even Camden park daily? There are 3 chances at 20% (IIRC) a piece. I almost always get one. If you do a bit of research to find the spawn locations you'll find every location has at least one spawn chance. 
---
I picked up 4 or 5 in a 90 min play session. They are all over the place....
---
Or at least let us earn more lunch boxes for confetti explosion and to help friends that arnt done yet
---
Thank you. Now join the noble cause. We must get a hammock.
---
What are you taking about?
---
You can kill a Wanted player and don‚Äôt need their ‚Äòconsent‚Äô. They already gave consent when they gained the Wanted status.
---
Turn Pacifist **off** so you can do damage.
---
Does Weapon Artisan work with them?
---
I do it ocasionally, but I get so many legendaries for just playing the game, I don't care for the alpha predator at all.
---
I like the setting and it being a bit challenging, but this is what I dislike about it:
---
1) Underwhelming rewards for pretty substantial effort. 
---
Formula P - flavored Mentats are way better. 
---
Lab coat - pretty sure it's a common drop you get within 3 tries or so, slap an emblem on a lab coat is nothing to be excited about.
---
Backpack skin is probably the most desired one, but I've seen it being used by a person or two in my entire 500 hours played. Not something I would use, either.
---
2) There's a bit of unpleasant randomness to it and weird AI pathing.
---
3) It's not a long event, but it feels like it drags on forever.
---
4) Assaultrons.
---
Fat man's only do 1 damage sadly to sbq.
---
I dont think the server could handle everyone using a fatman.
---
You can kill a wanted player so long as YOUR not in pacifist mode.
---
If I could work from home for at least 20 an hour doing debug testing, I'd sign the fuck up.
---
I hate being an essential worker right now.
---
Does this update fix the NoRegionPing bug on the Xbox Game Pass PC version where the game would not let you load a world if the game files were not installed on the C: drive?
---
Ugh !!
---
Peak whiny bitch eh I think the rest of you cunts can beat me out of that position go back to licking Bethesda‚Äôs sack.
---
It doesn't really, neither does tryna bully a girl on reddit but here we are. You seem to be a salty little bitch based on what you were saying up above. You gonna be okay bro, it can be kinda hard when you have such strong opinions and no way to back them up.
---
Do the math between logins, for many people it doesn't give notice or shows wrong visually but actual numbers were correct. 
---
Kinda like when you first login and it might show 0/9 completed until you've been on for 5-10 minutes and it updates.
---
Wouldn't be the first time I've seen someone complain for them just to figure out they were in pacifist mode. It's always a good chuckle.
---
Good for selling to bot vendors.
---
There's some where Stings and Things tells you to find a bloatfly gland.
---
I think I actually came across this once and totally forgot about it.
---
I agree.  Collectron is the most useful.  I think I have every version except the for default type.   Alcohol/Chems or Weapons/Ammo settings are my preference these days.
---
Refrigerators would have been useful if they did a better job (say, 90% slowed decay vs. 50%).  As-is I only rarely use a camp fridge and even then, half the time I forget about it and the food spoils anyways.
---
I wish the atom shop had more in the way of structural building content.  The modern house pack was a step in the right direction as the porch foundations gave us something truly new to work with.  Some of the prefabs are OK but I don't love the foundations attached to them.  Having versions with and without (like the greenhouse) would be better.  Would also like to see prefabs that can be snapped to regular building grids (imagine something like the blood eagle nest but cut down and set up in a way where it could be snapped to the ends of 2nd story floors).
---
Wow wonder how many times I've seen this on this subreddit nowüôÑüôÑ
---
Yep! Got a left leg with WWR. Still weighting for the fall damage pieces to drop though..

I agree! I haven‚Äôt used the fixer much tbh even when it came out and am only just now getting into it since switching my secondary character‚Äôs build from 2handed melee to commando lol (and didn‚Äôt want her using the same ammo/gun as my primary, which is the handmade). Much prefer the combat rifle over the fixer just because I don‚Äôt totally rely on VATS and like the longer condition bar (and being able to apply skins lol). The insane recoil, no matter the mods, drives me up the wall
---
Are you kidding......I‚Äôm sure there were well over 100 plus posts about the stupid double wall......I was making a point that the sub should not be filled with constant complaining you don‚Äôt like it there is the door. Stop playing the game and move on with your life.....
---
Ladders imho
---
Gota soundproof the walls so they can get right back to ignoring all the helpless wastlanders banging on the front door.
---
Lol
---
Sounds like you are just ass at this easy game
---
#1: Collectron.  Nothing like free screws (giggidy).
---
#2: Arktos refrigerator.  As a Carnivore, this extends the life of my scorchbeast leavin's without occupying carry weight or perk cards.
---
#3: the gravestone loot bag.  Easier to find, and I feel it has a bigger hitbox?
---
I SAID BRING IN THE AUTOAXE
---
I sold one from my vendor for 15k the other day. They didn't even message me a lower offer, just bought it.
---
Yes and no
---
I would run any event in the Savage Divide for that sweet 0,15% scout mask drop. 
---
Riding Shotgun is my favorite, but it has its own drop pool sadly, so no mask from it. 
---
Guilded meditation and Line in the sand for exp grinds.
---
Horde events for a quick "Kill Legendary enemies" challenge.
---
There was a gilded skin, but I think it's no longer availible.
---
I've never seen anyone really do anything with these tricks that didn't look better than the conduits used well.
---
I love CAMP building, and haven't needed to go beyond conduit set to have good wire arrangement.
---
Event members, yeah (I think they also need to be on auto) but not random people who are nearby.  So if you're just chilling at a camp and some rando asks a question or gives you a compliment they're usually gone by the time you get done dicking with menus.
---
I just missed it is all and I failed in searching for previous threads.
---
In what instance is a Fatman useful? Bueller? Bueller? Anybody? Lol
---
They are useful for crowd control, I have a two shot fatman with +50% crit that unleashes 10k damage per shot. Explosive weapon perk damage buff and radius buff are crucial though. Also glow sights + adrenaline can add in another 10k per shot on the second salvo.
---
Haha!  Piper, Nick Valentine, Kate and Dogmeat, my 5th vote was Ellie from The Last of Us. Phew! No diseased big dick for me!
---
I tried for a while but couldn't find anything on google
---
I did some research, but it seems that a program to retrieve coordinates is on github.
---
https://github.com/dan-parker/fo76edit-scripts
---
I think merging is not so difficult.
---
Well, since the program used to draw the map is different (Other programs use [leaflets](https://leafletjs.com/), but this one uses [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/).), so you can map displayed by right-clicking can be copied as an image including markers.
---
From the beginning, it is designed to work as a standalone application using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). 
---
I think it has enough originality because it is made in.
---
I think you have to get to a certain level with the settlers, and you don't have to complete the story to get there you just have to grind rep with them. No they cannot be traded from another player.
---
300 of any ammo honestly isn‚Äôt that much for a player that high of a level. I think he was holding out on you. Also, he gave you a Gatling Laser but no fusion cores?
---
I can confirm this is still a bug.  I wish I had known about it before spending hours on a c.a.m.p. .  The only fix seems to be deactivating the skin and starting a new c.a.m.p. build.  It makes zero sense that something like a skin can be bugged.
---
I keep seeing other loot bags like Halloween bowl or pot of gold. I wish those would return.
---
Oh, how do I get that thing next to your name? I'm still kinda new to Reddit
---
It seems that all Limited time Events and Seasons will have a Stein going forward. After the Fasnacht and Jangles Steins, this will be the third.
---
This, I run a black pip boy, shrouded wood or shrouded combat armor, usually with a marine wetsuit or SS under armor. All black. Plus I appreciate minimalism.
---
Siding one way or another affects nothing but reputation. Do yourself a favor and keep all the gold. Also, siding with settlers can (CAN POSSIBLY, it is failable/missable) get you stealth armor for free, as opposed to paying over 4K gold after grinding reputation to buy the plans later on.
---
Edit: forgot to clarify, plans bought with gold cannot be dropped or traded. The resulting items are also locked from drop or trade.
---
Thank you for this recommendation.
---
They're found in random junk places. They're used to make a working camera if you've not done that yet. Otherwise, just drop them.
---
did you read what you wrote? clearly not. what you posted was most annoying useless whiny shit you could post. litteraly doing the exact thing that you hate so much.
---
if you are so hurt by what people are posting, when why event make this post. its bullshit, and you are just trying to start circlejerk by being a cunt.
---
Minimalistic and black for stealth build. But to each their own.
---
Cool... see my edit. Maybe apply for mod Captain SpendsLifeOnReddit
---
Indeed
---
What is the point of 76? As far as I know it's a multiplayer role playing game where you can either choose to play alone, or with friends?
---
So should I take my Fatman to line in the sand? I think it would annoy folks at radiation rumble or uranium fever.
---
I‚Äôve played it for longer when it was worse. I‚Äôm a masochist.
---
I'm with yah, buddy. I jump on for 45 min tops to complete dailies and bounce. ‚úåÔ∏èüòí
---
Yeah its fun to use but it guzzles ammo &amp; is wildly inaccurate at anything more than a few paces. Have it on display right now but pull it down for funsies.

Are you on Xbox? What‚Äôs your Gamertag?

Dual wielding is too OP unless it had say a 4x reload speed penalty, especially with combining vampire and bloodied weapons as stated here.  Imagine a VE 15 auto 10 mm pistol with a B Crit 15 Gauss pistol sharing a critical meter.
---
It happens every time
---
It's a pistol, built to fire a 5.56 round. You could go get one made right now (cant promise it would be legal or particularly wise to use, but it could be done). But never mind that. 
---
So, you want a shotgun that can Stagger (30% Base), Stun (27%), Ragdoll, do more damage, have a better range? You realize that would make the gun more broken than anything else in the game, yeah? One good shotgun could stunlock an army.
---
The biggest problem with Fallout 76 (and Fallout 4) is the lack of niches for weapons. In good game design, different weapons are for different uses. Shotguns are short ranged but very powerful in that short range, rifles are long range and powerful, pistols are cheap/have lots of ammo, heavy weapons are expensive but very powerful, and so on.
---
This is not true in Fallout 4/76. Here, rifles are kings because they do everything. High damage, high fire rate, low cost, high range, if you want it, a rifle does it. 76 makes it that much worse, because it's a multiplayer game and has to maintain some semblance of balance. The end result is mini-nukes that are laughable, useless grenades, useless pistols, King Rifle, and shotguns, which outside of a specific glitch are not really performing well due to how the game handles damage.
---
Unfortunately, fixing this would probably piss more folks off than it would make happy, so it's not going anywhere. The best thing they can do is add weapons that fulfill those niches and do it well, or barring that, are good enough to be close. A 5.56 pistol that does damage like a 5.56 (or better) rifle at shorter ranges would probably be enough to make the gun viable for those who want it (or introduce dual wielding for a midrange between spray and pray autoweapons and accurate but slower single shots). Shotguns that do more per pellet (rewarding you for getting into the target's face with more damage, as opposed to the Gauss Shotgun, which punishes you for using it like a FPS shotgun). Heavy weapons that do more damage than anything else indiscriminately in exchange for the high price of crafting (and it is relatively high). The end result would be one weapon per class that did the best you could ever want, which would suck and make things cookie cutter but solve the overall design issue enough to allow future additions to give more variety.
---
(Coincidentally, laser weapons have the same issue. In theory, they reward using them against targets with high armor/physical resist in exchange for lower base damage. In practice, everything with high armor also has high energy resist, so the end result is that lasers are often less effective in their niche).
---
Spotify and fallout work well. I put on soundtracks from previous Fallouts.
---
ok kid whatever you say.
---
A Fallout 3 Gauss rifle skin would be pretty cool
---
From what I understand, all collectrons can collect the same items, but the different models specialize in (collect more of) specific items; ie Ace collects more (better?) ammo; Fasnacht collects food/edibles; etc. Is that an accurate assessment?
---
would love stairs with some nice wood handrails and balusters. Make it feel more like an actual home.
---
I'm a strength/intelligence build and it's all I use for enemies that don't have gigantic hp pools (SBQ, mirelurk queens)
---
Prime capacitor will make it the most ammo-to-damage-per-shot efficient ultracite weapon, in my opinion. You craft ultracite plasma cartriges in droves of 200+ per craft.
---
Its AP cost is 30-35 or something like that, and its accuracy in VATS is pretty good.
---
I wouldn't use it if I didn't use VATS, because of its low rate of fire.
---
I would literally sell myself for a New Vegas remaster.
---
There's one or two static dead brahmin in Flatwoods.  Pretty sure those will have spoiled meat along with hide on them.
---
Thanks! feel like a bone head!
---
Well known bug that has been around since launch that affects all weapons and reload speed effects (like speed demon mutation). Switching weapons also fixes the bug until you leave/enter PA again.
---
Yeah i did this earler
---
The fact that it's shown in the top image indicates it's supposed to be part of the outfit, just like all of their other mannequins that advertise their outfits in the Atom Shop. There's a technical term for this, 'false advertising'. Bethesda has already gotten in trouble for this in Australia with their [Canvas Bag debacle](https://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-76-players-finally-got-their-canvas-bags-from-bethesda/) where they had to refund people who bought one of the advance copies of the game where a canvas bag was pictured but people received a nylon bag instead.
---
Depends on if you‚Äôre soloing LitS, if the scorched get dropped on the sonic amplifier then yeah go to town that‚Äôs the perfect scenario to use it. However if there are 9 other players there and the scorch are spawning at the fence line then you‚Äôre more likely to just mess with the frame rate for everyone and only hit a handful of  the spawns.
---
In FO4 the camps had spawn boxes that allowed you to spawn enemies. Created a basic arena and even some mini instances with this. This allowed me to test all aspects of a weapon including my ability to use it under intense "fire"
---
Yes and it‚Äôs vocallaser7201
---
You can‚Äôt scrap them
---
Why the downvotes?! I thought it was funny mate :p
---
They should just give a pointer to each enemy, always. Currently it only shows the quest pointers after they're down to some 5 enemies last or something like that
---
What's a magic Lmg
---
And I dig it, but lets be honest, how many folks really knew The Ink Spots outside of the Fallout game series at this point? Especially in their younger demographic? At this point, you could make up music, and as long as it isn't blatantly obvious (like mentioning Nuka Cola), most players would have zero idea.
---
Farmable dirt tiles can be purchased at a certain reputation level with the Settlers. Siding with the raiders at the end of the Wastelanders quest line provides a large bump to *Raiders* rep, and a (smallish I think) hit to *Foundation* rep.
---
However, post-quest, you are still able to increase your Foundation rep, and get it to the point where you can purchase the dirt tiles. 
---
So yes, if you side with the raiders you can still get the dirt tiles from Foundation, once you have the appropriate rep level.
---
Yeah it's tailored for even casual players, and to have stuff after would also widen the divide between people who play 18hrs a day and pee in a bottle to those with lives etc. I dont believe anything other than maybe caps would be tacked on at the end. 
---
Also, having some form of spammable/repeatable reward would make the dupe-stackers hit absolute pay dirt- you know, the guys in the black bubble PA during Season week ONE.
---
Really ?  Lol
---
Yeah, that would add a lot of replayability value! 
---
After you spend \*hundreds\* of hours grinding what is the point of creating a new character? Just so instead of making pew pew with rifles you make pew pew with big guns? We've grinded too much to just start from scratch everytime we create an char.
---
You rarely see Teslas in NW and they weigh a ton anyway.  Between that and Marine Armor, you're basically overencombered.
---
The one with giant sac balls!
---
I believe mine is a anti armor 33 vats and  something (not on atm) .  Melts if you can keep it on the same hit box.  Sucks that's its 75 rounds.  It was a struggle the first 5 clips, the last 3 after the HP refill... It just melted.
---
I carry it, for special occasions.
---
I've put my CAMP by their house just to piss them off. Been there ever since.
---
How about you go do more shit on your own time and the people that enjoy not doing chores in a video game continue to happily wrap that crap up quickly.
---
Means a lot to low level players while being a waste of storage space at high level so it‚Äôs nice to see a bit of sharing :)
---
Nobody cares. You know what people *would* care about though?
---
* Recipes for different kinds of flavored meat jerkies that don't expire.  
---
* A meat freezer camp object that keeps meats from spoiling.  
---
* Grahm's cousin Grohm as a camp ally.  
---
* "Blood Drenched", "Covered in Giblets", and "Kiss the Chef" skins for Secret Service armor.  
---
Or we could get a lazy rehash of a previous event, I guess that's cool too.

Sometimes moldy food spawns in the fridge at the frat house

I 100% get your point. It just wasn't my point. My point was not to make the game easier by adding companions, but more to add to the role playing aspect of the game and potentially re-live some of the amazing moments I had with companions in Fallout 4. 
---
Regarding how easy the game is as is; I find that you can quite easily make it harder with a little self balancing. IE: It's your choice whether you go in with meta gear, or not (I had a completely naked character for a few months and it was a blast!), or carry a lot of gear (stimpaks, food, water, etc), or not. I assume that if they did add companions, the companions could be fairly useless, requiring food, water and stimpaks when they go down, or if they were just as powerful as you were their kills wouldn't count as XP. 
---
But hey. I didn't make this post on the assumption that everyone on here was going to agree with me! So all good. I can definitely see where you're coming from in regards to the game being too easy as it is already. Maybe I just have to wait it out for a Fallout 5.
---
All weapons spawns are random (with some minor exceptions). Best bet would be to find the plan and crafting one. Or finding someone to craft it for you.
---
If you go to lucky hole mine there‚Äôs usually a cultist in the end with one, the praying room with a waterfall and little pond. It might be a tough fight for a level 31 though
---
I just want scorchbeast to land, not be glitched as friendly, have better hit boxes for none autos and stop flying away to restore health! I did not waste all that time and ammo for your buggy ai to retreat to another zone faster then ap can be regenerated, catch up and have you be at full health!
---
33 vats is magical?
---
You forgot about the 9000 other bugs they've ignored since they were discovered.
---
I have a ts25033 Lmg never used it
---
It's a qualifier. The lmg also has over 200 fire rate.
---
I do my dailies and finish up maybe one weekly then just explore (I know all the locations anyways) or do some ‚Äúfun‚Äù events. Only if I feel like it or if I have time.
---
That could be a temporary fix, but it would be better if they took out the flawed ai code and use the working code they already have.
---
Thanks
---
Their marketing strategies are to maximize purchases of atoms. They fuxked their player base with the legendary run/ season system by reducing gameplay atoms by 70%.  If they would have lost countless players due to it then I feel like they would have done something about it.  It‚Äôs meant to push players to either purchase atoms or subscribe to fallout 1st since it‚Äôs more cost effective for atoms /value. I find it highly unlikely they will add anything to it. I‚Äôm nearly done the legendary run , going to kill robots for some atoms  when I‚Äôm bored .
---
Ah, damn. I was hoping there'd be one somewhere that spawns on the floor or whatever that isn't quite randomized.
---
Not sure. Ace does a good enough job with Fasnacht treats though.
---
Worth anything? I'm trying to get rid of it.
---
Ai improvements are a subtle way to make a very big change in the fun factor of this game.
---
I can understand that when you first start the game using resources like this just seeming like "cheating" because I like to explore and find on my own, but for end game, camp locations etc it is an invaluable tool that I now use frequently.
---
Hm. I've done stupider fights for less, so I might give it a try later.
---
I beg to differ friend I learned a great deal by being able to go back and do things as many times as I wished. Being able to reload a save allows you to go down every path see every angle get to know every character from every angle from a loving view or a hatful stand point  without having to redo another 10 20 30 40 50 hour playthrough. Take Fallout New Vegas for example if I had to replay the whole damn game to see every ending Id never see em simply don't have the time or desire to see the same things over and over again.  I get what you're saying but I don't think permanent choices belong in fallout. It's far too constrictive for my taste.
---
Meh. Ill be pretty happy to not have a reason to play
---
yea i knew something was up doing Rumble yesterday. normally on a solid 60+ FPS, dipped down to 8-12 at the end. completely unplayable.
---
Got it! I use take the auto grenade launcher but will take my junkies Fatman next time too
---
I might need to do this.  Made me smile!
---
There's at least 3 bobble spawns in very close proximity by the command center in Camp Venture. One on a roof, one behind some crates, one near the weapon bench behind the level 3 lock. They'll all trigger the perception perk at the same time, so just run in there and server hop if you don't hear it.
---
A non-angry response: Two things, design goals and hacks.
---
NW is not designed to be a FutNut clone. It rewards careful and thoughtful gameplay, with survival taking priority over murder. This is not what people who want BR games are looking for... and it's not what traditionally single player, non-pvp players that tend to play Fallout want either. The non-gameplay elements (perks, load times, ect) are not suitable for the game they are trying to get people to play, and people who enjoy the setup enjoy not playing NW as well.
---
Second is hacks. On PC at least, there was a point where hackers were omnipresent. Damn near every game some mook would be flying at the top of the map one-shotting you with a gatling gun beyond max draw distance. It drove people away. It's not really so bad now (again, on PC), but the memory sticks.
---
If 76 was a BR game, it would already be dead. Thankfully, it is not, so instead it's a side playground for impromptu hide and seek, between bush wookies trying to get cosmetics and the folks who play it because they enjoy it (and the occasional asshole hacker). I highly suspect that if there is any real work being done on the mode for something like a new map, it's being done by one person, during slow time (which is sodding rare for them, I am sure), and mostly because of their personal interest.
---
EDIT: Oh, yeah, And balance issues. Frog legs hopping grenade launchers or gauss shotguns are basically win buttons, and have been for some time. End result: If you are not doing that, or don't loot the appropriate items, you're kinda buggered unless you've got a serious numbers or experience advantage, and sometimes even that does not help.
---
I‚Äôm not 100% sure if they drop it, but usually boss enemies like that with unique weapons drop it. I know for sure they‚Äôre always their wielding one and they drop the ammo, so I‚Äôm assuming they drop it and I kinda remember them dropping it before but I‚Äôm not completely sure
---
In all honesty it's something I have never checked. Might be worth investigating.
---
Can‚Äôt you just buy the plan from a vendor bot?
---
Teensy bit expensive for me at the moment
---
But then how would they make money? You realise that's the only thing they care about, right?
---
I haven‚Äôt looked in a while...how much is it?
---
Lazy and bad management on them.   I mean, they are sure to keep people playing right now due to Covid 19, but when that has lifted a bit ..... well, that is a different story untold as of yet.   In the meantime, Bethesda should come up with an alternative fir atom building.   I only wanted three things from the run itself and not looking for much else with the little atoms I have left now in the Atomic Shop.    It will be a stagnant period for a lot of people, who by all rights, now have an excuse to get a better hobby lol
---
I think somewhere around 3.4-3.8k caps if i'm remembering correctly.
---
Could use a midnight snack *rubs distended belly*
---
Ye,I‚Äôm mildly specked into melee as well,which isn‚Äôt really helpin my damage output wit rifles,that‚Äôs why I saved them lvls...
---
Kinda gotta have one thing your good at in this game,I was so used to FO4,it takes some gettin used to.
---
The Fatman is... not good. I don't think this gun knows what it wants to be. Is it a high-damage pocket nuke? No, certainly not. Is it long-range nuclear artillery? Not quite that either, no. Is it for crowd control? Not really, because you're too likely to blow yourself up to be useful in 90% of crowd control situations. 
---
I get why they tuned it this way, because if it did the damage it should, it would trivialize some fights if everyone just unloaded with their Fatmen on the SBQ for example and killed everyone's framerate in the process.
---
I think a better design would have been a weapon that does insane overkill damage but that can be fired exactly once before it needs to be repaired (twice if you have level 3 Weapon Artisan), and make repairs cost raw flux and a lot of screws. Basically, you'd want people to really think twice about when to pull out the Fatman, but when players use it, it should feel AWESOME.
---
The nuka and red rocket are serviceable stairs... Some dedicated ones might be nicer though.
---
It doesn't even really need to be that good healing for it to be plenty strong to be honest and if not vamp it would probably be medic's as that synergizes well with the entire playstyle in the first palce
---
The recommended course is to do ***both*** side's preparatory quests, until the "Siding with Settlers/Raiders" quest is given.
---
The Siding with quest is the lockout. Once you pick which leader to talk to, you auto fail the other side's quests. But if you do everything for both sides up till that point, you already got most of the rewards like the stealthsuit for free.
---
Interesting theory. I'd like to know if someone could test this. Certain perks don't work inside power armor even though they don't state it in the description such as serendipity. I wonder if dodgy falls into the same cetegory.
---
What's the fire rate? I'm on Ps4.
---
If it's magical I wouldn't get rid of it.  Best way to check is spawn or fast travel to where the giant super mutant spawns (I forget the location, it's by white springs Station, SE of there, the pond. Fast travel there and turn around and run down the trail and it will be there unless somebody has killed him in the last 20 minutes).  Shoot it, and if you melt him (you'll know) it's a keeper.

Also, angry turtle on YouTube, he has several magical weapon vids.

It's another unwanted tacked on forced pvp multiplayer on a series that should have stayed singleplayer.

Many people have no idea how to use conduits. It ain't easy, I get it, but conduits are the best way to nearly hide all wires. Create a blueprint and you can even place an entire "house" wiring in foundations with connectors/radiators EXACTLY where you need them.

Owlet Nuggets is easy enough.  Need a helper; one clear everything in the Deep, have the other enter and wait for respawn.  Kill Owlet, touch it's meat, recipe learned.  WTH is Floater Flambe?

I will admit, on challenge days, I strip to my skivvies and see how long it takes for someone to notice and decide I am not a trap. The one pair waited four minutes before they capped me.

Half wall height stairs makes good sense. Then you can wrap them around corners and such like a real house does. We can only hope.
---
Use the keypad interface to type numbers.
---
Fallout 76‚Äôs story is much more realistic, morally. The settlers are not exactly heroes, and the raiders aren‚Äôt just psychopaths - they look out for each other. The BoS is not a heroic force; they are a military. A military MIGHT fight for the good of the people it is supposed to protect, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they are doing good deeds. They will CERTAINLY be darker.

I like your observation. I believe that broadcast is to all the major factions, but Dorsey misunderstood it, and will be killed because of it.

Spawn a wendigo colossus on a stealth character and farm the infinite spawning wendigo spawns, or make friends with a duper

You need to go do encrypted... NOW
---
I like games with both options.  
---
Being able to go back and change or being stuck with my choices.  
---
Detroit: Become Human for instance is a great example of permanent choice. Until Dawn is another one but after finishing it and Detroit you can go back and change how the story goes.
---
Aw, that‚Äôs a super kind offer of you, though!
---
I'd enjoy that. Even if it's all the same stash, having the appropriate containers open into the appropriate tabs would be kinda neat, and give a reason to have all those fancy container variants.
---
I wasn't referring to the people who programmed this game.  I was just pointing out that a well written caching system would address your concerns.
---
As for poorly written ones - those are likely behind at least some of the dupes.
---
I know there's some caching going on in the game.  Craft some ammo then open the weapon selection wheel - the ammo you just crafted will not show up.  And it won't show up until you either reload or go specifically to the Ammo section of inventory. So there's a cache being used there and it isn't being updated.

I think the current interface for vendors and such like for caps/scrip/bullion would work just fine.  Just do it the exact same way you trade in legendary items for scrip or treasury notes for bullion.  The terminal would have "Buy" and "Sell" selects, go to the terminal, select "Sell", the vendor interface will pop up and you chuck all your unwanted ammo in just like you would with legendary items or treasury notes, you get your points, back out of it, select "Buy", the vendor interface will pop up and it will list all the types of ammo in the same way the Purveyor does with the different legendary options or like any vendor for that matter, you select 5.56mm, you pick amount, click "Ok/Confirm" and big bada boom you're done.

The above is just a lengthy way of saying make the Ammo Exchanger a vendor and the Terminal acts as a dual select NPC for a "Buy vendor" or a "Sell vendor" exactly like the Scrip machines and the Purveyor.  The reason for the dual types instead of one is so you can keep track of what you sold like with the scrip machines, although I think their maybe a coding issue because of how the Devs chose to do the whole scrip and bullion system.
---
Because, it's a bunch of entitled babies here.
---
Aren't there a few brahmin corpses in Flatwoods?
---
Dont remember sorry
---
there is a skin for the pumpshitgun and lever action that was recently datamined. other than than there was the starlet sniper and the gold inlay skin, and a scout skin.
---
Jesus Christ, the way you describe it I'm glad I completely ignored the Legendary Run, because that sounds awful. I don't think I'd be cheering for "yay, more behavior modification please!" 
---
I just log in and do my own thing, I never get hardcore into the seasonal crap. 76 is my "sit back and roleplay a nuclear survivor" game, and I've always found their implementation of Chase to be kind of crass and amateurish.

Thank you Ward.

Checking reddit once a week is spending my life on Reddit?

Fuk yo edit boi. Smartass muthafuka.

The supermutant stomp where you shrug your sholders and look side to side like franklin from charlie brown

got to love people that have no clue what they have lmao.

That was a nod to andale from fallout 3

Hopefully it's addressed at the end of the season for the next. There is no way you should not receive anything for the daily and weekly after score.
---
 I hate seeing it, but sometimes it takes a lot of angry posts from the community for something to happen in a timely manner.
---
Inspired by this post I went off seeking the fabled owlet again and FINALLY found one of the damn thing. West entrance of The Deep and the only reason it was alive is because the crickets inside were already dead.
---
I don't think FT should cost anything but I do think there needs to be limits.    
---
You can't be in combat or suffering from constant damage or over-encumbered of course.    
---
I'm sure all the hopping around would be an issue but you would have to have visited a place and opened it on your map to travel to it.
---
However then AFK'ers become a thing. I don't think you'll ever stop selfishness one way or another.
---
Fasnacht gave me the shits in the end when you can see the CSA morons hiding in the houses while me and two guys actually DID the event.
---
They are a good leveling weapon if you go commando and have the ammo.
---
More types of crops and less cost to plant them at C.A.M.P. would be wonderful. Would love to grow some ash rose or some other flowering plants in smaller greenhouse-style planters.
---
I would like to hear back on how that went.
---
I know what they are worth but caps are useless to me, they're cheap to help ppl out who need them
---
Well...at least there is a ‚Äúsorry‚Äù emote now.
---
Marsupial mutation. Heck with stairs.
---
he offered me 1700 or 1500 but I didn't want to take to much :)
---
I definitely tried taking one off my display case, putting it on the floor and picking it up again, just to try it... sad times.
---
&gt; It's pretty obvious that FO76 was never deemed to be as important as ESO
---
It was deemed a risky gamble right from the start, Todd all but said as much. An experiment to see what it'd be like. 
---
I still think we're just a test bed for 5.
---
Nope. They don‚Äôt really work well together. Kinetic Dynamo seems to recharge ~10 AP a hit so with dodgy you still lose about 20 AP. 1 Hit brought me from 100% to ~80% then another brought me from that to ~60%. (In PA so I can look at the numbered percent on the AP gauge). My HP moved a bit less until I took off dodgy so I think it works in PA)
---
Im familiar with this type of observation..... "Cats always land on thier feet and buttered toast always lands butter side down"..... infinate dodge, nice
---
I have several explosive legacies I can say first hand they get the job done but there is better weapons to use against Karen that you can obtain quicker than a legacy
---
Anything natural should be able to be cultivated in a CAMP. Shit like pumpkins, Cranberry, Starlight, bloodleaf etc. It sucks trying to make certain chems going to find this crap.
---
The BoS is keeping track they will be punished
---
Sadly no infinite dodge. Kinetic Dynamo only recharges ~10 AP a hit so you‚Äôd still lose 20 AP.
---
Why tf wouldn‚Äôt it go back to how it was before the season started? I‚Äôm almost finished. Do we seriously get nothing until the next season?
---
People don‚Äôt always listen, I had one fail the other day because people kept staggering her landing, got on the mic to tell them to stop shooting her in the air, did they listen ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I like it how you pop a super mutants in the head for 3k and it doesn't move the health bar but you shoot him in the foot for 900 damage and it's an insta kill
---
Okay mate, try this with kinetic servos on the legs. This will increase ap refresh rate while moving if I remember correctly. Being well hydrated helps ap rate as well.
---
Why can‚Äôt we get extended mags for the lmg? That would be great since 75 bullets aren‚Äôt enough for that heavy gun. I think in Far Cry 4 you had atleast a 200 bullet capacity on the Mg 42
---
Honestly, I just want the vendor interface and maybe an option to ‚Äúbulk‚Äù ammo (no material cost) and then sell it into the machine with a vendor ui
---
Yeah, I know. 
---
Thing is that a cached list isn‚Äôt really helping as it might be outdated the moment you arrive. Granted that‚Äôs always a risk but the work put into that seems to not be worse it if all it did was leading people to whine all over the internet that the preview system, or however you want to call it, is broken because it lists things not in the machines. And you know that there will be whining. :)
---
I mean, you gotta remember The Brotherhood isn‚Äôt the one asking for cork. Russel Dorsey is. The brotherhood has no idea Russel even exists, much less what he‚Äôs gathering. I guess Russell just thinks the brotherhood need cork?
---
We don‚Äôt touch, we watch from the bushes...
---
Their pricing for magical guns is way off.
---
Not sure until then run is completed by the other piece moving around the board.   Roughly two weeks left
---
I personally don‚Äôt see the outer worlds similar to fallout but I really enjoyed the outer worlds
---
I keep wondering if it‚Äôs worth it to:
---
a) find a working ps3
---
b) pay for the stupid PSNow bullshit just to have a terrible version of it.
---
c) die waiting till they finally release a remaster
---
Ive seen people post instructions on nearby "Queen Killin" camps.. could always go that route.
---
why give a gun with ammo that don't go together?
---
I won a match when a guy nuked the final circle, I took off into the fire as an ‚Äúfu , you aren‚Äôt getting Xp for my death ‚Äú then he died in the fire before I did lol
---
I have one of these on top of my camp. So funny to launch Ole Bessie for no other reason besides you can.
---
Especially when bloodied
---
In my test I had well hydrated and Action Boy as well as Lone Wanderer (there was still a ~1.5 sec pause between getting hit and it starting to refresh and against multiple enemies or an enemy with a high fire rate weapon it‚Äôll go to zero nigh instantly) and while the servos would help I believe it‚Äôd help after the fact. Since there is a slight pause between it costing 30 AP and normally recharging.
---
Edit: Bought Kinetic Servos and tested it. I just moved in a circle. It helped but I‚Äôd say it went from ~1.5 sec pause to like ~.7-1 sec pause. It‚Äôd help mitigate some damage while you get to cover but it won‚Äôt make you a 30% damage ignoring (while moving) tank. 
---
I went to Sunnytop ski lodge and had the mutant on the sign shoot me then I killed everyone but the boss (usually has a Minigun) and had him shoot me that‚Äôs how I tested high fire rate weapons.
---
Yep
---
I just got a junkie one today with faster fire rate, but still seems slow. I also have a junkie ultracite laser gatling with no faster fire rate and it seems much faster. Am I doing something wrong?
---
EDIT: I put an aligned mod on I think screwed up the fire rate
---
Not just pacifist, it could also be God mode, seen that more than a few times
---
Nobody else is going to show up because it doesn‚Äôt mark it on the map, it‚Äôs just a random spawn
---
Either that, or make mini nukes an INCREDIBLY rare item and remove the ability to craft/convert them. As things are, they're a 6lb nuisance
---
no thats not what happens, people just buy then and flip them. they make thousands off of them. you really wont help someone by pricing them that low, just help line the pockets of a lvl 500 lol.
---
That‚Äôs fair enough if you‚Äôre doing queens constantly, I don‚Äôt so I wouldn‚Äôt move my camp for that
---
I would say MAYBE free is a little too much but I love this idea or maybe something like carry weight
---
Hm. I have a set of stairs about half-wall height leading into my house from the selling/workbench area. Took some finagling to get right but the concrete stairs could apparently be forced through the concrete foundations. Not sure if it works with other kinds, I kind of doubt it.
---
I‚Äôm not sure about max providing free. Maybe 90%, mostly because I doubt Bethesda would let that happen, but it‚Äôs better than plus endurance.
---
me and my friend thought if you have 2 of the same weapons, you can mod it to be duel wielded, and if they are both legendary weapons, both effects are applied
---
There are three possible spawn spots at tyler county fair alone. Another 2 at wavy willards... but im rank 100 so i havent even logged into 76 today... lifes good!
---
YES, this!
---
I needed .308 and he dropped a gatling laser :)
---
I‚Äôm sure he wouldn‚Äôt have minded considering he was offering it to you.
---
Wasn‚Äôt it vault 94?
---
These seem like decent ideas, though.
---
Yes, bet when I wave to my other 3 public teammates, and a nuke has been dropped in a heavy cobalt area... Players should poke their heads in.   That's why I did.
---
well I've seen plenty of high levels scrolling through my camp and buy nothing. not all ppl that play this game are rip off cunts.
---
They may have had everything muted and didn't here you
---
Hop a few times at Argo-tech or just travel around with the bobble-detector you'll be fine
---
Bootlicker
---
You mean how are you going to get items worth trading a B2525 Fixer for?
---
Grind the hell out of legendary drops and hope you'll get a bundle of something good enough some trader wants, that's how I got mine.
---
Also branch out from Reddit trading subs, the prices for some items are ungodly and you basically have to own an item worth the same as a B2525 Fixer like a legacy, a Red Asylum Dress, or a J2525Fixer (and even with the last one you might need to bundle)
---
The QOL improvement from these mods I consider essential.
---
1. Perk Manager
---
2. SFE + Text Chat
---
3. Better Inventory
---
4. Save Everything
---
5. Ore Glow
---
There‚Äôs no obligation unless they feel like doing it, people don‚Äôt always understand emotes because they don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre just waving to someone nearby, and a lot of people don‚Äôt know the spawn points, they just probably didn‚Äôt know
---
It's almost really weird when lower-level players jump into my building team and then follow me around. I had one the other day so I showed them where a bunch of recipes/bobbleheads/plans/magazines spawn in Pleasant Valley, even though I was just doing the run for the shotgun ammo from the Scorched, then patted the other player on the head and sent them on their way, ha!
---
True story
---
Honestly
---
that's why you always nuke the deposited and Avery other place there is to stand on and fight her over near the grove
---
And would 5% more camp space kill them
---
I'd like to point out 2 things.
---
1. Explosives in general(not explosive bullets on legendary weapons) kinda suck right now. The damage isn't all that great and the blast can be incredibly inconsistent on whether it hits something or not(for example, I've shot multiple MIRV's inside the whitesprings golfclub. I've survived one or two of them, sometimes they didn't even scratch the ghouls). Even using dense/fireproof is inconsistent and it seems that you deal significantly more damage to yourself than others. 
---
2. Scorchbeasts in general also have a high explosive resistance so even if you hit them with a mini-nuke or homing rockets, it's not going to really even scratch them.
---
(If you want to use a fatman, I recommend getting a 2-shot and sticking on a MIRV)
---
It's actually easier with a 4man team and sharing alot of XP and perk cards
---
Furious Gatling plasmas shred her , doesn‚Äôt need to be legacy or anything just furious
---
I think someone mentioned in a different thread, but the scrapping to learn mods might be partially broken on gatling.
---
I just want the gun itself.
---
I was shocked to see a Roleplaying team request pop up the other night. I didn't recall seeing the option when I looked at them. 
---
Offered a bonus to Charisma and I just happened to be walking into a train station for some selling so I went ahead and joined.
---
Soon as I did I heard 'radio' chatter. One of them was saying how it was great that they got these old walkies working as now we could stay in contact across distances. 
---
I just grinned while listening and selling. They were totally in character, talking about growing up in the vault together and how strange it what seeing unfamiliar faces now. 
---
I finished selling and decided to play along, fast traveling to the Abandoned Bog and purposely getting in 'over my head'.
---
I 'frantically' radioed for assistance, that I was being overrun by mutants and gave my location. They responded like a legit military unit, issuing commands and directing the team for 'LoS fire' or 'flank them'.
---
The 'leader' was a munitions expert, skillfully tossing grenades and then shooting them as they sailed past the target to great effect. 
---
In short order I was safe and they were congratulating each other on a "job well done" while cracking open some Nuka. Though one guy had a preference for Old Possum and made sure everyone knew by asking us all to keep an eye out for it constantly. 
---
I just knew I could have a really fun time with that team, hopping from event to event, sitting around a campfire sharing stories of the Appalachia wastes, or cryptids we'd heard rumors about.
---
Sadly I was blue screened shortly into it and unable to return to that server as I hadn't friended any of them yet. 
---
But now I keep an eye out for that Roleplay team request. ;p
---
I ran that setup for awhile... It does make a noticeable difference, but under heavy fire the damage will eventually outpace the AP regen. The emergency protocols are still your best bet, even for high health builds.
---
I used hats and helmets as a measurement tool. Those three Thanksgiving displays didn't use more but the same budget space of 5 regular displays.
---
There's some sort of max damage cap or something.  It's something along the lines of games calculation causing problems with damage "rubberbanding."
---
SB's in general have a high explosive resistance so fatmans to rockets, mines to grenades, they're all useless sadly.
---
Nobody likes it because it‚Äôs a shit show , the defending critters part is always f‚Äôed so most of us think it‚Äôs pointless
---
Maybe, but I have talked to more people since they were introduced than I did from launch until they arrived.
---
Yeah I tested it. You can take 3-4 more hits depending on your AP. But if you don‚Äôt pay attention you can be stuck without a way to escape.
---
Totally.
---
And it's a waste of ammo, every single time.  The ball sac is a good reward though.
---
Didn't they say this was coming in a Q&amp;A during QuakeCon?
---
North of Gorge Junkyard there‚Äôs a garage, and on the house behind it, in the cellar, you can find a dead mole rat with a knife thrusted into its eye which should have spoiled meat.
---
I just wish they'd fix the fucking audio. Goes from barely hearing it to blowing out my fucking speakers
---
Right on man. There are a couple of few good combinations that are good for a power armor build, unfortunately I have too many guns to effectively use power armor. I am very overweight and ap drain is insane when I enter power armor.
---
The 27% chance is only if you use a critical shot which takes multiple shots in VATS. If you think it‚Äôs too much what about 15%? Maybe lower the bar or whatever. Then the damage can be a little less then a buckshot prime receiver, but the damage is more consistent than a buckshot, with the added benefit of having a chance at staggering starting at 15% (since you say it‚Äôs too high at 30%). And the whole stun lock thing is improbable since a majority of the time you won‚Äôt get the ‚Äústun‚Äù effect unless your build is based around crtis, and even then you have the odds going against you.
---
Pc 10k , PS4 5k 
---
Whoever decided that everything on every platform costs the same is a moron
---
Neat.
---
What playstyle do you like more, sneaking around and shooting things, or stand there and unload?
---
I have both a heavy gun character and a stealth sniper.
---
I prefer the sniper style of gameplay, even though my heavy gun has better toys.
---
I had those as well. I setup insane defense lines and sit back and watch. Hell on the frame rate lol
---
Yes they did sometime in the near future we are getting power armor and i think clothes displays. I know they talked about power armor displays and im 98% sure they mentioned clothes as well.
---
there's usually one sitting in a room in the back of West tek
---
Yeah. I wanted to do a rifle PA but sadly there are no perks that reduce rifle weight and PA negates all legendary armor effects so no weapon weight reduction effects. Maybe when I get a full set of weapon weight reduction SS armor. Hahaha.
---
Good hunch
---
One guy did but he gave up after about 5m of trying to get their attention
---
It would sound good but I can‚Äôt help but think that this would be abused, using cheats and glitches to finish the run very quickly to just get back to earning atoms, and then there‚Äôs the problem of autocomplete so all players wouldn‚Äôt be given a fair opportunity to earn those atoms
---
Neat
---
Should at least give you 150 atom for each level gained once you finish the board. That way you could keep playing and earn points to use for next season.
---
I‚Äôm gonna get to 85 tomorrow if I play so thankfully I‚Äôm not done yet. But it would suck if there‚Äôs no incentive to keep doing dailies.
---
Check your cards , probably cooked up some stims with super duper and forgot to put your rifle card back on
---
I was in 3 nukes in a row today, idk if it was a single person or a team but killed the queen in less than a minute, the 3 times, leaving a lot of people without the chance of doing enough damage, me included, lots of angry emotes lol
---
LOL @ massive conspiracy üòÅ
---
Bethesda wants to give us free stuff to promote the expansion, if possible without losing face - what's the difference between deflating the goal and inflating the donations?
---
Your right these items would be much cooler! We'll never get anything close to them lol
---
I like being able to stand and unload but I never find any good heavy weapons, stealth seems like a better option in my case
---
I'm keeping a TSE 10 mml for this. Shhh!
---
Worst part about the dailies. I could do everything else in about 30 minutes most of the time but leveling up takes a while because I don‚Äôt know the spots or have the best set up. And I‚Äôm only level 215 so imagine how annoying it is for those over 300,400, etc.
---
was going to suggest this one as well
---
Emergency protocols on your PA will be a huge asset.  That along with  dodgy and ricochet would be my 2 cents.
---
I loved that video. Ska truly is the perfect fallout music.
---
I would love to see a buff to Berserkers and I like your idea about a brief immunity on a kill, especially with Gun Fu
---
Found it first try with nothing more than a simple google search.
---
Knowing bethesda they'd want to ban dupers instead of adding good content
---
It‚Äôll be a lot better once the colossal problem is out! Guarantee people will show up then!
---
the damage per shot cap is only for pvp and it is 110
---
Can you wear diffrent headpieces and not equip that? Or are they both 1 thing?
---
Just throw them
---
nuking squirrels during Fasnacht
---
You can wear different head pieces but i prefer the head piece because it looks cool
---
I'd say your hat is waiting inside the frat house in Morgantown.
---
West Tek Research? I found a Minigun in there earlier, and I seem to recall finding a Gatling Gun there on Xbox once.
---
How would this expose dupers though?
---
Rubberbanding is one of the worst glitches in the game.  I doubt they'll ever get around to fixing all the game's problems, but you would think they would prioritize the battle ones - they are the most disruptive of the game, not the silly visual oddness and duping.  You can't ignore game breaking problems that occur in the middle of a fight.
---
And to install Raider Punk in his CAMP for some like minded conversation...
---
I only fast traveled there to kill the Yao Guai that spawn by there for the spring so I was super surprised when there were people inside actually running the place, doubly surprised when I found out they were being held by cannibals.
---
Thank you so much for answering this! No it's definitely wicked cool. but for me I wanted to use my sniper hat, plague dr mask and this outfit to make a full plague dr look.
---
most people dont even glance at plans that they already know. unless they actual scroll though the plans then they wont see it.
---
and at 25 caps, they arent being "rip off cunts" either.
---
Or perhaps a shield. Sword and board
---
It looks good with the plague mask. I use that on my junkie alt
---
Maybe browse around here to see what others have put up. Some might be a little out of date.
---

---
Just lead her away.
---
I have the communist one and I can only get it to collect food or commie items.
---
It's still a ragdoll effect on top of a stagger. Vrit or no crit, layering that sort of CC effect is bad desihn, and that's ignoring the rest of my opinion.
---
Yeah easily done, just saying i see it all the time, bethesda says theyre gonna do something, and right up till the day of release people are making request posts about that thing
---
Some things to note.
---
Ash Piles and Goo Piles seem to lag alot of people.
---
Not sure if meat piles do as well.
---
So some lag, might not be you, but the game's engine.
---
I don't do project paradise and radiation rumble, they are complicated for me, the hostiles are pretty strong and there's a lot of them. and the other players get REALLY mad if we fail it, so yeah I avoid it badly
---
Go look through peoples vending machines. Its been clear as day who duped or benefitted from the dupe.
---
" **PSA: The Bow isn‚Äôt trash!** " yes you are right, it's not trash. It's complete shit.
---
Yess
---
I forgot to add, r/PKOA this really applies to all of you guys.
---
I'm on level 82 now and I can see the grind and slower progress ahead of me for the last levels.... I'm already exhausted justing thinking about it.   I'll finish this season then take a long break.  No way I'll do this again.  You would have thought I had learned my lesson playing the first 100 level season of Destiny 2....
---
Stealth instigating rifleman is the best all around build , instigating is completely underrated
---
Well yeah, if that‚Äôs the case then why even bother putting new guns in at all if Rifles do it all the same. What would you put as an advantage to using slugs then? You have to be more precise with your shot as a drawback, so what else can you think of?
---
You can say that yes, but your not a AAA games company that is now advertising on their website these are going to happen, for them to not happen now would be false advertising since, correct me if im wrong and missed it, i dont see any disclaimers on there saying these events might not happen
---
I am fairly sure I found the plans at some point so would be willing to make one/mod one for you. May have a legendary variant in my stash that you could have (would have to check tomorrow though).
---
&gt; Killing an enemy makes you immune to all damage for 20 seconds.
---
What the fu-
---
So punish everyone for your personal choice?
---
You are using it wrong.
---
Naw man, still no place for those commies!
---
Yes but only in free aim.
---
It just works
---
Awesome. That‚Äôs RNG for ya. I used a google search and the perk for 3 hours and didn‚Äôt get one. And update: came back later tonight and found one in the first spot I checked!
---
I'd be happy if fast travel actually worked.
---
Im bout 5 ranks from finishing the Season. Prolly just going to take a break from playimg after this tbh
---
Work her uniform? Did I miss some kind of adult patch?
---
How many new bugs would they create after 6 months of ''fixing''?
---
I think it‚Äôd be cool to have a ‚Äòquests‚Äô team option, like for lower level players who need backup or when going to a new area where you aren‚Äôt familiar with the enemy spawns yet
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt type these out it‚Äôs supposed to say worker
---
All you can you is go out wide, get first shot and try to get her to land, once she does ppl panic swarm like dung beetle. Also if you can get the first shots as she spawns you usually draw the agro.
---
This is looking back to the fences, everyone had to shoot her up the bum.

I have a friend who quit playing a few weeks before Wastelanders dropped. He's disabled and plays on his computer more than half the hours of the day to distract himself from the physical duress he's always under. 
---
This dude is the most stringent fellow I've ever met in terms of doing *everything* in game on his own, and will never any form of charity, nor would he ever take advantage of any exploits in game. 
---
He never ran bloodied, and was permanently encumbered (hoarder) so he walked everywhere he needed to go after only a couple hours of playtime. 
---
He reached somewhere around level 600-ish running a low int chameleon build, rarely in a team (so no inspirational or HM/SIN boosts), all while getting somewhere near 4000 hours. 
---
Factions didn't bring him back. Legendary run didn't either. BoS won't do the trick. But he admitted just yesterday to being open to playing the game again if... We can get Dogmeat as a companion. 
---
I want Dogmeat more, dammit, if not for me, then for my friend. Dogmeat 2020!
---
Just want to say that Im wearing the same exacr outfit with the jangles backpack lol
---
Meat piles don‚Äòt.
---
I think there should be a scavenging one where either we get extra strength points 
---
Bonus materials from breaking down junk or weapons and armor 
---
Or a set -X% on all junk in inventory
---
Like public teams are fun but I agree that they should do more than just increased stat or XP. Maybe exploration could provide less fall damage or bonus XP for discovering new locations
---
Exactly what it is. After the fallout first cashgrab/ban wave lawsuit threats they are letting blow over they will be banning everyone and just cancelling their first payments the way they should have the first time , ammo machine extractor blueprint morons are gonna be screaming when they realize they are on the list too
---
I'd prefer if they actually did something other than hover around and occasionally take a pot shot at something off in the distance. ;p
---
My comrade collection is borderline p2w with herbivore. Now more than ever since they boosted the the benefits. Literally never worry about rads, water, or food.
---
The amount of food and drink buffs I get are to many to list.
---
On top of the Watoga Civic Center, there is a Scorchbeast Nest across from the parked Vertibird. (There are 4 Super Mutants and two Hounds as well.)
---
There is both a dead Brahmin and a dead Yao Guai in the nest that give spoiled meat.
---
&gt;Save
---
Maybe casual could have an idiot savant sort of thing where randomly will get bonus for doing certain actions.
---
Could also try the blood eagle camp up the hill from west tek. Its called ripper alley. Might have an easier time since theirs only six or seven blood eagles. One of them wears power armor and is allmost allways carrying a heavy weapon.
---
What about more bugs? U didn't even touch on that haha
---
Medic pumps and Gatling plasmas.
---
Well, at least casual team is a thing though, too all the XP grinding team, whoever will join or open this seems casualer or chills for a bit
---
What are you even going to use screws for?  I've tossed thousands away at this point.
---
K, bye!
---
I wanna 'work her uniform' :(
---
Dupers*
---
Thank you! Aaronholt did it for me
---
And a few more in the gym in the vault underneath the university....
---
Gatling plasmas are what you want , furious shreds her.
---
Once you have a camera yourself you don't need them, you can't scrap them or fix and sell/give away. Just drop them they aren't any good unless you need a new camera yourself.
---
I've always wondered why they don't just put time limits on the events, ie you have to have been in the event for 5 minutes or longer in order to get the rewards and or loot from all enemies
---
Every now and then I'll sneak off to a friend's camp and build a spiral staircase out of the bearskin rugs that just leads to nowhere but goes as high as the build limit will allow. We call them the bearway to heaven.
---
Nothing's funnier than hearing someone loudly yell in frustration "Goddamnit did you build a fucking bearway in my camp?"
---
It's the game basically.   Ini tweaks help a lot.
---
 If your computer meets min specs then not necessarily the problem.
---
The meat shack , it has two and people avoid the three snallys for some reason I‚Äôll never understand.
---
tried these exact steps just now and still nothing. also tried reading all the terminal entries first which others claimed fixed the problem, also put the fuse in first, nothing. how do they even break the main quest line like this, and so early in the game? I just got this game 3 days ago and I‚Äôm ready to toss it
---
I have yet to have any auto complete... But I cant gain SCORE in my Power armor, I have to exit after completing challenges.
---
Or maybe a PVP team where all members on that PVP team are able to fight other PVP teams without the pathetic initial poke damage we normally have when challenging other players.
---
By now this bug is a feature. Fix will probably never happen.
---
I'd like to have a lynx as a companion - with a battle suit and maybe a head laser.
---
I've given up on taking Tyler race track because one inevitably spawns under the concrete stands.
---
I thought 2-4 caps, I know glowing meat is 4, but it also depends on perks/consumables
---
Yeah, they are going to be reverting the change but the current way is with half walls. Put 2 half walls down, use a flamethrower trap to destroy them, build 2 half walls on the other side, go to camp and repair all structures. If you look up a YouTuber named final render he posted a vid the other day with it. Title was camp glitches that even devs didn't know or something like that.
---
It's really weird. I can walk from Watoga station to Glass Cavern and make a circle above ground. In 10 minutes I usually get to see 50+ mobs and about 5 to 8 Scorchbeasts. Killing 1 Scorchbeast gives me more XP than most quests would reward me. I find it baffling that killing random mobs yields me faster xp than doing a quest. Sure some (daily) quests are really easy, but still they take up my time.
---
Events are a bit the same. The ones that spawn large amount of high level mobs really boost my level gain. Normally I want to do those the most efficient way, but now I just farm mobs and wait with the objective till the last moment. (Radiation Rumble is a good example) Hopefully One Wasteland will up the level and xp of some of the events with low level mobs like Enlightment and Jail Break.
---
I think this is a problem unique to private servers, similar to how Power Armor frames are extremely difficult to find on private as well. The actual challenge is pretty quick to complete in Adventure if you know a couple spots and server hop (my go-to's are usually Appalachian Antiques or Middle Mt. Cabins, both have 2 spawns).
---
&gt;hange but the current way is with half walls. Put 2 half walls down, use a flamethrower trap to destroy them, build 2 half walls on the other side, go to camp and repair all structures.

Thank you so much, I'll look him up in the morning and start workin on my camp again.  
---
You are the best!
---
Melee until lv50 , everything before 50 is the tutorial
---
In VATS enemies health doesn‚Äôt rubber band, for me.
---
Np my man. Keep on surviving
---
Caps aren't that valuable for traveling.  Ammo costs eat much more of my caps.  Junk and plans are much better.  Even more chems too.
---
Those square lights on the roof - where do you get those?
---
Thanks, nice setup.
---
I think that is just a visual bug, not a cheat.
---
minimum of 8gb? i played through the entire game with 90+ fps max settings and i only had 8gb total ram
---
Toxic valley is like lvl 20 &amp; close to a lot of daily quests.
---
Instigating lever action with quick vats buffs , mine one shots basically everything in the game but the SB‚Äôs and Queen
---
Casual should have increased disease resistance, decreased thirst/hunger, less item degradation, more carry weight.  Good QOL perks that take out survival elements and more fun.
---
I'm trying to stock up on ammo this week for a nuke run so I've been using my super sledge exclusively. 
---
Took Dolly for the lead node and wouldn't you know it, the first defend event is a level 50 legendary Scorchbeast that flat out refused to land. 
---
I just went back to camp and hit up Lucky Hole. Came back after and she hadn't even bothered to take it from me so no need for a retake.
---
I have a lvl 40/50 furious explosive Gatling gun if you want it
---
Maybe 5k????  It might actually be rarer than the Red after the dupe glitch.  Blue is normally semi-rare, like 5th on the the list.
---
They recently added guaranteed legendary drops to a lot of events ;) however, they are usually 1-2 star drops.
---
Good tip, but personally I won't use the bow much. Too niche and there's better guns.
---
I sell blue ones for 6-7k when I have an extra and they sell.
---
Under the lights tab.
---
Fanning the hammer could be implemented into Vats. Perhaps a perk could change your revolvers to fan the hammer on crits (with maybe a damage or accuracy reduction to avoid becoming op)
---
Another passive (or perk) idea I had for pistols is to change the speed you draw them. They're small, you should be able to pull a pistol out of your pocket quicker than you can pull a mini gun out. This would empower pistol builds to allow them to swap to other pistols quickly, being prepared for a variety of situations. Or alternatively it would allow pistols to be good side arms.
---
Oh shit really? How many caps you want for it?
---
I feel that it is server related.
---
And are they level 45 cause I always only get level 45 from them even tho I'm level 98
---
I have a feeling the BOS is going to roll up, see someone getting busy on their spot, and kill the poor bastard.
---
Its ass. The only thing worse is cuisine royale
---
Furious Gatling plasmas get the job done real quick and you don‚Äôt need to be 90% dead to do it....
---
That will never happen sadly Bethesda to salty towards the community
---
Lvl45/50 is the highest level for weapons (depending on the type).
---
How many do you have?
---
I know but shouldn't they be level 50 since I'm above level 50?
---
Adrenaline, gun fu, reaper. Get you a instigating lever action and you will one shot everything like a beast in Chinese stealth armor
---
Another easy way is to destroy the wall with a flamethrower trap and then run the wire, then repair the wall
---
Yeah they changed the quest in an update and it bugged it out. They know about it and hopefully they'll fix it soon.
---
Rename to "SCRIP"
---
So there's nothing I can do besides wait?
---
Fuck I knew I forgot something
---
I remember the powerplant one is since the began of the game, they didn't expanded the event range, or add the stuck detection, the enemies marks on the map is random, workshop defense really is one of the painest stuff to do
---
What they should at least do is to expand the event range, and enable the mark all the time, they should not have any hide and seek elements on the combat mssion
---
How about changing it to using Bobbleheads? I‚Äôm all for using them up to drive some interest and take some out of the market. Make people choose whether they need a full display or those SCORE points.
---
Yeah, they didn't even file the proper paperwork with the county office.
---
Nope, it depends on specific weapon you're looking e. g for a handmade rifle it's lvl45 but for hunting rifle lvl50(don't quote me on numbers for these specific weapons, just making an example)
---
2063. If that‚Äôs not enough, I can see about scraping up some more (I‚Äôve been buying some cheap plans for house stuff so I can make a cozy camp)
---
Ah okay thanks
---
I will take 100 also you can have all of my ammo for it for free
---
That‚Äôs magic weapons for ya.
---
Serendipity is also god tier
---
Oh shit, alrighty!
---
Of your on ps4 add me im hayzedayze-
---
It's been working on private servers
---
they also prevent me from looting my meat piles since for some reason they have a larger hit box. So I see a bunch of meat piles and a bunch of ash piles, but I am unable to loot any of them, as everywhere I look it only shows the empty ash pile inventory.
---
Ign: Duffydidley
---
    I will be on in about half an hour
---
Loved Detroit an amazing game. And I think we're on the same wave length just transmitting at differnt frequencies lol. Just in this instance it wasn't my choice my game froze and chose for me instead of letting me weigh all options available. That's what enraged me so much
---
You cant hack on console
---
Check is out at r/papa you may like the change of pace am environment we set up there
---
you can't clear ash piles though as they show up even if they weren't your kill, so if somebody else uses a tesla rifle there goes your fps.
---
Try r/pkoa
---
I think they thought it would be a distraction for people that are tiring of the score grind
---
Only fought him for the first time today but my advice Bring plenty of ammo plus extra and just keep your distance. I use a non bloodied stealth commando and was able to fight him just find. 
---
I had the chinese stealth armor when i fought him in the nuke zone and only have 1 point in endurance. So I wasn‚Äôt as tanky as normal and did allright. 
---
Tips Watch for his poison spit thats what does the most damage and don‚Äôt let him get close. Even if you need to break stealth to keep some distance. His wendigo minions can catch you off guard. 
---
Bring plenty of health restoration items. he is 100% worse then the queen. The queen is just fly, crop dust, scream , swoop and slap. Old man wendigo will use fear one minute and spit poison the next. 
---
If you run scorched earth  and want some practice on wendigo colossus. After fighting the queen stroll over to that forest near by. It has a chance that the colossus will spawn.
---
Yep, I forgot to mention it. Arrows need as a second way to change number, the first one is just writing. Thank you
---
I'm honestly confused and irritated by the fact that the Foundation can grow Silt Bean, and I can't.
---
They really need to half the challenges and double the points for the next season. It takes too much time each day and so many things aren't what you would usually do. 
---
I don't have a ton of time to game so I log in and do my dailies for reputation and score, then maybe one other thing before I log off. Really depressing to not actually get to play the game.
---
The thing I am most excited about is that we actually have a *slight* chance at extinguishing the dumpster fire now that they are looking at mod support. If they finally just offload the heavy lifting to people who know what they are doing so the paid staff can concentrate on what is *really* important (pumping out the funny hats etc for the Atom Store) maybe we can finally get some bugs fixed and have a fun and stable game that doesn't feel like we are paying Bethesda for the privilege of beta testing their game for them. 
---
Honestly, the possibility of mod support is **amazing** news. There are so many possibilities of QOL changes and implementations like the ones you mentioned
---
I think that's being a d!ck lol
---
I actually thought Uranium Fever was created in-house. lol
---
Here‚Äôs the thing - I do think they need something more, but how could they have more? Some players murdered them, other conned/intimidated them and other joined. Most of those really prevent you from working with them in any meaningful way.
---
How this bulk option could be added to current interface, where you should choose amount of ammo from the list. They need to remove this sub-menu in this case
---
Bow is most fun weapon for use for me
---
YES! And I will need to get a good one just to call it YCS 186
---
It's not music oriented, just her rambling non stop about raiders.
---
"Invincible dogs"...does that mean you tried to shoot good boi? :(
---
If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what are your computer specs? Right now I‚Äôve been using a nitro acer gaming laptop, so for me I‚Äôm not getting the most out of this game. Do you use a laptop or a desktop PC?
---
Giving your employees the power to delete items at will opens the door to a whole new level of potential abuse (and lawsuits). One crooked GM could do more damage to the company than a hundred cheating players. You can blame the code monkeys, but their authority to implement fixes is also limited. They may have the skill to bang out a solution in a day, but they're not the ones who decide what gets worked on and when. The fact that it's a lingering issue is really a PHB problem.
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs a random heavy weapon. The cultist always has a Gatling gun no matter what
---
i‚Äôd love to be able to tell you but i played it on my old system, all i remember is that i had 8gb ram and 290x graphics card and the game ran perfectly fine for me
---
Yeah, mini "tower defense" game...i had so much fun with the toys in that game. Might have to reinstall it.
---
ammo reduction on the chest chest piece after 3 tries, i got lucky.
---
Does Beserkers not seem insanely OP to you there?
---
Well that's private and I ain't looking to buy their service unless you want to but if there isn't a fix them I'll wait
---
Building is where it‚Äôs at üëç
---
I just wish I could add stairs that didn't leave such a wide open hole in my ceiling. All I want is a 2 story house with roof access. 
---
I can make them out of suitcases and it looks decent enough but the lack of a proper landing means I always have a huge gap.
---
And with the plague doctor mask ü§î
---
The new C.A.M.P skin unlocked in the legendary run can cause this.
---
Good point ! And also, other new public teams with strength, damage or defence bonuses. Bonuses to charisma or inteligence are good, but not that good.
---
alex jones is not crazy.
---
Why did they lvl limit drops?
---
I finished the run 2 weeks ago. Knowing that no extra dailies are there after the run, I lost the incentive to play. I just login on Tuesday for the atom shop update.
---
&gt; I think the game knows you are actively looking for things and doesn't spawn.
---
This certainly seems to be the case. I first noticed it while trying to "Kill a Wendigo while wearing a clown costume." Once I had the clown costume in my inventory, no Wendigos would spawn anywhere on the map. And I do mean anyway, even supposed 'guaranteed' spawn locations.
---
Can't find bubblegum either whenever that's a daily challenge, but at least I can hoard that stuff at other times until I need it.
---
This is a common myth. Scorchbeasts have no special resistance to explosive damage. The SBQ has a perk that reduces ALL damage by 70%, but that's it. You can verify that SBs take explosive damage because every Automated Surface-to-Air Missile Battery used for SB-related events fire the same missiles that can be found in a standard missile launcher. They indeed cause damage. Source: a Fallout 76 Dataminer (me). :)
---
Thanks ahahaha, if you like it feel free to use it ;-)
---
Rule 10. Go check out the market sub
---
Yeah unless you can find someone with it and join their server. I'm on PS4 so I can't help ya with that :( It's a pretty stupid bug really
---
That has to be it...I switched today. Thanks!!

---
And there's my bloodied vats crit stealth commando
---
I have put a lot of time in with both builds and they are very solid, I prefer the heavy char for the variety it offers in game play. But they are both very strong and it depends on your play style what kind of build you'll want
---
Yeah, this really needs changing. Everyone at an event should be able to loot all the enemies involved with the event.
---
Lots of people have been doomsaying and claiming that players would get lazy and afk, but I don't buy that excuse. I'd much rather have that than what we have now, which is infinitely more frustrating.
---
The SBQ's resistances and damage mitigation never changes. She has not been buffed. The SS armor has not been nerfed. Source: Fallout 76 Dataminer (me).
---
I'm so jealous! That sounded like a ton of fun!
---
Stop doing it if you're not having fun.
---
Akimbo perk. Duel wield with slower reload speed on guns and unable to ads. Rank it up for faster reload speed or higher ranks for higher hip fire accuracy.
---
Idk about catching anyone but they definitely want to purge our junk
---
nop. I have the skeleton perk on me, staggering like crazy once he shot me. It made no sense
---
Thanks for the help
---
They're always inside one of the towers for me but I can't go in cause I'm melee and there's steam -_-
---
It doesn‚Äôt, unless the bush Wookiee or afker is on your team. NW is team-based, and with every teammate lost it becomes much more likely you‚Äôll lose. I‚Äôm fine with people going bush Wookiee provided they turn fill team off. I wish fill team defaulted to off.
---
I did, the robots did die however the imposter sheepsquatch didnt
---
Radiation Rumble is unplayable if people use teslas or lasers.
---
Hoping on now if your ready
---
I made it to level 100 recently. Had 4 wins. 4 of which I didn't kill a soul. 1 win with 2 kills, somehow had a 50cal machine gun so I figured I might as well go down swinging and take down 1 of the 2 remaining people while they were looking at the sb. Somehow managed to get them both haha
---
Paige (Jet) is sittin pretty with those beans and we‚Äôre left in absolute poverty
---
Events team + Leader bobble head + canned stew (feed the people) + Inspirational 3...
---
Oh and then there‚Äôs the fact that those asshole farmers from the Wayward line seem to have absolutely no problem growing pumpkins
---
Fun fact if you kill the SBQ at 0:01, it will count as a failed event. 
---
It takes like 25 whole seconds to register the SBQ‚Äôs death before it can determine if the event is complete or not.
---
I think that was my first failed scorched earth after my friend‚Äôs first nuke was on the fissure site prime. We killed it, but everyone was ‚Äú???‚Äù emoting after we failed and killed the SBQ
---
The implementation would require too much work from Bethesda. And it seems that this game is only made to make money, not work...
---
I just want the crops to take much much less CAMP space, i have so many ideas for farm designs, but just thinking that the crops can take up to 50% of my camp is ridiculous. Looking forward to the update that changes this. If it's in the world, we should be able to grow it in our camps.
---
IGN: I play in the mornings add me if you need some help with other shit no charge just like helping.
---
Gotta love this community
---
It's 20 hours after you buy or sell something to them
---
Huh, that's pretty interesting. It's been a while since I've tested things out but last I recall, even using homing rockets and such would only do 1 or 2 damage even on regular SB's. I need to test the stuff out again sometime.
---
Really wish there was just a sticky thread or general page of known bugs, issues, and things acknowledged by the devs. Would make it easier than digging through retired threads to see if the topic is posted. Had another guy in here get bitter about it but thank you both for staying cordial and letting me know it was brought to their attention.
---
I already have it in steam... had a sale and couldn't resist.
---
The easiest way to level up on a new character is to go through the vault, grab the perk cards and get inspirational, make a public Team, and head to the fairgrounds and find jangles the moon monkey. I suggest discovering the farm on the way there and kill everything you see while walking. Only takes 5-10 mins
---
Pumpkins, Cranberries, Siltbeans and every other crop that has been cultivated by Wastelanders before or after the scorched plague should be able to be cultivated. I could see why we cant have firecaps, glowing fungus or blood leaf, but there is no good reason why we cant plant the same crops that NPCs can.
---
I think a good replacement for ‚Äúlow levels who don‚Äôt know any better‚Äù is ‚Äúnew players who haven‚Äôt been snagged by the tangle vines that are this games weird ass meta‚Äù
---
Hard no to 1, I need my perception for the rifle dmg perks as I'm a pipe pistol/rifle build.
---
Also the Eastern Regional Penitentiary Prison Yard has many weights.
---
5%, since +1INT gives +2%.
---
Yep they ruined the game even more just to get people to buy atoms.
---
Depends if they're wanting the unyielding bonuses or not - at the moment theres a lot of grinding for XP, so would rather risk dying to something silly than not have the extra +15 INT
---
Looks like the Institute invented time travel as well...

Best workshop imo, has ammunition machine, lead, oil, junk, and a couple others.

Thank you very much!
---
Btw how do I initiate trade with ya?
---
I have a better idea, remove all the songs and only let Take me home, Country roads playing forever
---
(jk i would love to see a ton of new songs)
---
I saw this thread before I logged on.  Immediately went to the giant nuka cola bottle at Tyler County fairgrounds and immediately found one. 
---
Then I found 5 more just going about my business. Dunno why so many people have problems with this. RNGeesus must love me.
---
At least 3 times a week i do this, but because i have other games to play. Right now im juggling Ghost of Tsushima and Fall Guys also the Avengers BETA when it got activated on the weekend and this upcoming weekend as well.
---
September is going to be even heavier with the full release of Avengers, WWE Battlegrounds, Mafia 1 Remake. Hopefully, 1 Appalachia brings me in full time, im expecting that to be a game-changer for me like "Public Teams" was.
---
My current SCORE RANK is 82.
---
I enjoyed running around in all the gold bullion at vault 79, the purveyor is a good shout
---
Yeah it was an arbitrary number.  I could see how doing a higher number would make more sense for a legendary perk. 
---
Either way, it‚Äôs something that people could get excited about as they could do a lot more in the wasteland and spend less time in camp
---
Pc
---
Score coins, sounds like a mobile free to play game.
---
They hold stuff back so they can sell them as cut content later on.
---
The three people who I tried to hunt down in the last 2 weeks or so, always end up being God mode and Magic Weapon. Every time I say, let me give it another try, it always ends up being the same predicament.
---
That's literally why I got the bow skin I wanted to display it.
---
Not getting a reward for working towards the goal is worse than someone getting a reward while not contributing. In an artificially scarce economy freeloading is a relatively small issue.
---
Ha! Don‚Äôt know what to tell ya man.  I‚Äôm playing Dark Souls 3 now and loving it. There is a difference between a hard game and a broken game design. I appreciate your understanding tho.
---
Fast travel tokens could be a cool thing.  
---
They could be in the nexts seasons or even a reward for some events.
---
I do exactly this lol
---
Edit: Most of the time I have to solo either Paradise or Radiation Rumble. Not difficult to do, but meh. Its much more fun doing it with others
---
I have that vendor but it seemed to share the same caps unless it was fallout being glitchy
---
Thanks for asking the question, i was wondering the same thing. I have over 100 repair kits from just normal play and i never use them, until recently and its actually pretty darn useful. No need to immediately drop everything when in the middle of an event or far away from camp exploring. The past week I've been using repair kits exclusively and i love it, never going to buy them, but the ones i get will definitely get used.
---
Yeah, lately I find that I just do my C.H.O.R.E and then I'll play fallout 4 and do whatever the hell I want over in the Commonwealth or I'll play Sims 4 and go on a building binge. I prefer relaxing games that don't try to shove fomo cash grab tactics in my face like some sort of free mobile game.
---
Also also yes
---
Even have them go up part way to a landing and then turn and go up the rest of the way.
---
Not meaning to sound like a douche but unless you were majorly downscaling your graphics and settings, i highly doubt you were getting even close to that fps score.
---
There are people running 16gb and more and also running TI GPUs that aren't even able to get the game to run perfectly even after ini tweaks, i myself have 16gb of ram and run an RTX 2080 Super and unless i managed to scale everything down i wouldn't even be able to get remotely close to 90fps with things maxed.
---
Not calling you a liar good sir, just questioning the legitimacy of your comment.
---
Same I keep trying to go back to it but it's so clunky and the graphics are just too outdated for me to get used to. I loved NV so much but I just can't get back into it now.
---
Me too. I enjoy playing the game with friends, bugs etc notwithstanding. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôll get bored eventually and go play another game.
---
It‚Äôs fair enough if you think the mode isn‚Äôt much fun, but how is hiding in a bush any fun? It makes it less fun for other people, and at the same time tells the devs people are happy to hide in a bush to get cosmetics.
---
Omg I forgot about that raider radio and the guitar guy.  Thanks for reminding me, I'm gonna have to YouTube it for a laugh XD
---
Yeah...now I'm wanting one pretty bad
---
Not when they advertise online
---
These sound more legendary than the legendary perks.
---
Have to say I'm a bit taken aback, don't really know how else to respond to this as disagreeing with people on Reddit rarely ever tends to be a fruitful endeavor.
---
Thank you for not just reducing the conversation into mudslinging because we didn't see eye-to-eye.
---
Hopefully you find enjoyment with the game, despite your frustrations with it.
---
play public.
---
no issues finding bobbleheads. even without the perk. But I do explore lots when gathering resources.
---
Just because someone beat you In pvp and you couldn‚Äôt kill doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre hacking
---
Now this would be a proper legendary perk.
---
I ran into the same bug the other night :( the fix for me was install fuse - ping terminal - insert blood - ping it again when i got the no sample loaded quit to main menu load a new game try again and if still not working keep jumping servers till it worked ( it worked for me on the 6th or 7th server i tried) 
---
I know it sucks and its frustrating by keep trying and it'll work eventually
---
This!!! Ad Victoriam o7
---
I have finished the run now and have never felt so relieved.  I can now hop on the game and choose what I want to do.  It's so freeing.  
---
The should scrap dailies and have weeklies such as week one, two, three.  Then leave them in the game.  That way if somebody joins the run half way through. They have the opportunity to grind it out.
---
So what? That has nothing to do with my enjoyment of adventure mode. From what I hear they hardly show any attention to NW. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I check the Styles tab daily, and I am disappointed daily. I would sink so much money into that damn tab, if more things were added..
---
That was such a good video
---
Interior stairs would be great https://imgur.com/a/lmryDET
---
I use the ramp foundations a lot for that similar half wall height youre asking for. Interior stairs would be way easier to work around though.

You‚Äôre on PS4, so it‚Äôs not a hacker. He was most likely spamming Nuka Cola Quantums‚Äîlikely duped, there‚Äôs millions of them. That boosts healing so high you‚Äôre basically invincible for a while. An automatic Tesla rifle isn‚Äôt actually one shotting, but it‚Äôs fast enough that it feels that way. 
---
Not a hacker, but definitely cheesy as hell, nothing to do but walk away. Always remember, it‚Äôs highly unlikely that someone provoking you isn‚Äôt confident they‚Äôll win. Don‚Äôt hit back unless you‚Äôre ok with getting killed and looted.

My guy. Fucking listen for a second. He one shotted me with a normal Tesla rifle. I was in power armor. My friend was in power armor. I had and explosive weapon. My friend had an explosive weapon. We are both a higher level than the guy. We did NO damage. You wanna try and tell me that he beat us fair and square? You honestly believe there was no fuckery going on?
---
Dumb point.  About as dumb as a Dev incentivizing non-Br players to participate in a Br for score points.
---
Bush Wookies aren‚Äôt detrimental to your experience unless you let them be.  It sounds like sour grapes to me.
---
People would rush to complete.  Just give bonus XP after each challenge.  Simple.
---
Me being a pretty good shotgun build that can pretty much one shot most enemies with my gauss shotty, I always carry around a tesla rifle. It does enough damage to tag the legendary.
---
Crafting berry mentats is such a pain!
---
No it‚Äôs on console it‚Äôs hard to hack on that it‚Äôll be more believable if you‚Äôre on pc and the guy who wanted to pvp might have a clue on what he‚Äôs doing and just want to fight people like you
---
Edit:Levels don‚Äôt matter in pvp too
---
GREAT. ME TOOOO!
---
UPVOTE UPVOTE UPVOTE
---
I just want a dog to roam around with he doesn't even have to do much at all. Maybe for some extra carry weight like in fallout 4
---
They asked for feedback on the score system, pretty sure no one wants score challenged tied to nw. 
---
These posts just show that everyone is happy to afk in a battle royal. 
---
And you give Wookies a bad name, they live in bushes but they‚Äôre not pussies, more like bush babies
---
It‚Äôs just embarrassing that I‚Äôm 15 levels higher than him and my friend is 60 LEVELS higher and we both got melted.
---
That's because intelligence = more experience, it's not that people don't know any better.   
---
I'd rather see exploration decrease junk weight, decrease travel cost, and give a bonus to bartering.
---
Had this happen to me too, at a Workshop. The one at CAMP works fine.
---
Each team needs a *few* perks rather than just one bonus. My ideas would be (per team member):
---
Events: +25% Boosted XP from events and +5% increased legendary enemy spawn chance in events
---
Building: +1 INT and -10% material cost to building in workshops or CAMPs
---
Exploration: +1 END, -15% fast travel cost (maxed out that would be -60%, then you could stack Travel Agent for -90%. I think that balances well) and -25% food/drink weight (to a limit of -90%)
---
Roleplaying: +1 shared perk card (so maxed out, each member can share 4 perks plus their base number) and -1 to skill checks (including locks and hacking)
---
Hunting: increased XP from legendary kills, +5% chance of 3* enemies, and higher chance to get 3* gear from a 3* enemy (excludes queen maybe?)
---
They should add a few new ones too
---
Scavenging: increased caps on enemy bodies, increased material gain from scrapping (each team member would   be the equivalent of one level in Scrapper), -25% junk weight (limit to -90%), more junk found in containers
---
Brawling: this is a weird one but it would be essentially in-team PVP. Joining this team opens up PVP with the other team members or with other Brawling teams
---
Samaritans: all team members gain XP for any member‚Äôs quest completion. This could encourage high level players to help out those on the lower end and help lower levels get up quicker
---
Past level 50 everyone has access to the same amount of perk cards and weapons. It‚Äôs all about builds
---
i think i just got lucky because the friend i played with had a better system than me and he had tonnes of issues where as it worked almost flawlessly for me, i did have a few settings at the lowest like particles and draw distance and stuff like that but textures and everything else were at max and i always ran at 90+ fps , admittedly getting 120 was rare but it definitely did reach that. i also never had any glitching or crashing of any sort but i know for sure my experience of the game is definitely in the minority compared to the amount of people that had many issues
---
Ah yes I love getting 6 power Armor skins that I‚Äôll never use, meanwhile the handmade skin they released is the base skin with a few splotches of red paint..seriously?
---
With the double daily points coming up, you can probably get close to finishing it next week
---
Yes indeed, we need "not magnetic" stairs
---
Is it the same actor that voiced Jett Black? Gla d it's not just me that had that impression!
---
Oh my god I was gonna say this one!! It was hilarious but also sad to me lmao
---
The radio upgrades would be cool. I would like to customize my radio songs. There are some I do not like at all on Appalachian radio and I like all of them on classical but would like sing along sometimes. I want to combine the two stations
---
Yeah neither of them will give me quests. I've scrapped them, put them back, moved my camp, everything. Had raider at my camp for like a month before I gave up on him. Currently have had Gramps here for the past month or so now and still can't get a quest out of him either.
---
Oh and more haircuts, tattoos, scars face-lift not just makeup
---
im staying too, and i re upped my sub
---
huzzah
---
Face paint* not face-lift autocorrect....
---
I usually find them on blood eagle camps
---
Yep do my dailies as fast as possible then jump on The Witcher 3.
---
I think to the right there actually is a thread like that but ots not easy to find, at least im sure there used to be
---
Remember to tell everyone when you do lololol
---
I too, will be staying.
---
L A D D E R S
---
Well I can't really do that because the blood sample is stuck in the analyzer thing and reloading wouldn't change anything
---
But I apricate you trying to help, cheers!
---
Throwing another one on the pile. Actually stop playing about a year ago because I was going through about how everything was so fucking broken. Came back got super burned out trying to get all the masks at fasnacht (and didn't by the way since I never got a raven mask after like dozens and dozens of times). Then shortly after they introduced this garbage. Maybe instead they could come up with a few different daily Quest so that there's some variation because literally this entire game is just grinding grinding grinding no matter what you do. Want to get an ammo Factory or a plantable tile? Do these two Quest over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over. Like come on. Great at world-building but who wants to play a game that feels like work?
---
Take this award
---
I don‚Äôt see the point since apparently everyone wants food &amp; water requirements removed from the game.
---
They should let you pick out which song it can play and what ones it doesn‚Äôt
---
Brave man! It‚Äôs a great game! I know I‚Äôm staying too lol
---
Fight sounds legit. Just another "I lost my cool, tagged back, got beat, other player must be hacking" post haha
---
PC only but a huge problem regardless. I've experienced it myself too.
---
You probably would like and should get the Thanksgiving display case in the shop as well. Huge upgrade visually, functionally, and saves budget wise. Not mention it‚Äôs nicely discounted rn.
---
Because I play the game? I just know it's one of the worst made games of all time and barely runs
---
I too will be staying, and I know it‚Äôs a brave stance to take at the moment.
---
Agree it was pretty basic. I mean you're going to different planets and systems and running into like the same 4 creatures over and over. Not really a lot of excitement.  definitely not long enough to warrant your standard $60 price. Most certainly nowhere in the quality or enjoyment range of Fallout 3 or 4 and probably not New Vegas either.
---
Yeah they should add some more as I‚Äôve barely seen any good ones like raider paints clown faces or death claw face paint.
---
32gb, 6700k, and some getting old 1070s in SLI (for funsies really) I still can get dips down to the 40s : /
---
Buddies got me to play WWZ recently and while not really a comparison to an open world like 76 I was surprised to see so many zombies on screen at once and such high performance on my aging hardware. The system slays COD:MW '19 as well. Easily can exceed the 140Hz of my main monitor on both with the higher settings. 
---
Just makes me wish 76 was more polished on that front. That said it'll still run two clients simultaneously so I guess there is that /shrug
---
We met on the battle field but as he approached I noticed the glint in its eyes. Time stood still for a moment. His hair wisp flicked back and it was love at first sight. That was my experience anyways.
---
I'm with you brother! Gonna loot all the bullions of the Appalacchia
---
Hard to beat the collectron...
---
Trap base owners might find the smoke machines more useful, but the collectron over time may bring in more junk than a good trap base.
---
That‚Äôs so true, and let me tell you, they get real pissy when you show up to their front door. Although pistol Pete Hines was very very happy to be going into work in his Tesla. To be quite honest, all I wanted was to take some pics with the life size Mr. Handy, and maybe plead the case for a buddy of mine to be reinstated or unbanned btw myself or any of my friends on FO76 have ever duplicated anything, we did however start attacking dupers when they would roll back whole servers. So we ‚ÄúRobin-Hooded‚Äù those people until they changed the pvp rules. Also note worthy, lol I‚Äôve had 6k bounties, and those get more attention than dropping a nuke lololol. My point here, until people start boycotting the atom shop and fallout first they won‚Äôt change a thing, nor will they fully listen to us. These guys, and I‚Äôm talking about Todd ‚Äúit just works‚Äù Howard don‚Äôt really care about this game, all that really matters is the bottom line. If they did they would made a way for the survival servers to still be in the game, or maybe they wouldn‚Äôt have changed the original pvp rules. Whom ever pays more is the direction they go, I hate saying all of this but this is what they‚Äôve shown all of us who have been around since beta. They will always pander to the squeaking wheel first, which have mainly been preteens who haven‚Äôt ever played a fallout game before. Look at the battle royal mode for proof on this point and how they are trying to ultimately tie both modes of the game together with the daily challenges. Those kids are whiny as hell regardless and that‚Äôs who we want driving the direction of the game?
---
Nope, pukey orange also..
---
The emote works wonders for workshop pvp or trap base shenanigans
---
To*
---
What do the Star effects do? Hard to judge.
---
Completely so much of it is just junk it's ridiculous. Splitting the Ghillie armor rewards into each armor type was just a real dick move instead of coming up with things people actually want. I hate bullshit like that.
---
Same. I tried for three hours last night. I woke up early today to keep searching for a single stupid bobblehead.
---
Wait this sounds amazing I should really join more role play teams
---
I would tell him to get bent TBH
---
Be more specific, list the perks of the weapons so we can help you out.
---
Me too. Been playing since the game released. I enjoy the game.
---
Tried to leave, went back two days later...
---
Just do the repeatable xp instead a couple more times, quicker :-)
---
Ayari taking over Watoga gives me Mechanist/Automatron vibes - it's a great idea! She would be a natural nemesis for the BoS and could practically be a mini-faction in her own right, even making the Watoga Underground her base.
---
Me, I would love to see the Raiders and Settlers working together (with the players) at Tanagra Town to take down a new raid boss like the Interloper. Isn't that why it's called Tanagra anyway, the whole Darmok and Jalad thing?
---
Probably is
---
I should be available in the Atom Shop for free later today. The beret is still available though.
---
Hmm, I don‚Äôt know if I agree personally. I googled and found one in about 10 mins. Yes there was a bit of looking about but like 10 mins and done?
---
I hate this grind there is some cool stuff but damn its clear they really want you to give up and get atoms at some point
---
Sounds like he was freeing up some... You might think Im being nice by giving you 50 stimpacks.... really thats just eating away at my carry weight.
---
Doesn't add up to me. If that were the case wouldn't they dangle better rewards &amp; not just give them to all active players (ie give them only to those who contribute or break a certain amount)? Very little they are offering are even inticing to me &amp; I don't think I'm alone on this from what I've seen in this sub.
---
Not to mention wouldn't dupers be potentially aiming to earn more exclusive items which they could dupe for trade and/or profit? I haven't tried but unless BGS bodged it Atom Shop items aren't inherently tradeable, no?
---
Just seems like there wouldn't be appeal to them to make this succeed. Not even on a "shame Bethesda" level. Plus that last ban wave was less than inspiring.
---
Only time will tell, I suppose.
---
Apparently everyone in the 76 community hates grinding because I've seen nothing but constant threads from everyone on the subreddit about how every aspect of grinding is boring.
---
That's the entire point of grinding.  Monotony.
---
You don't have to do the Legendary Run.  You don't need anything from the Legendary Run.
---
If you WANT the rewards, do the challenges.
---
But if you're doing the challenges and immediately getting off the game, it's not the Legendary Run that's the problem.
---
It's the fact that you don't enjoy playing the game anymore for whatever reason.
---
Those reasons probably aren't going to be fixed overnight.
---
Play something different and check back later during updates.
---
How about a floater grenade?
---
Someone on my team found the colossus. The scorched event had just ended and I was almost out  of bullets so I headed to my camp to craft some more. I noticed someone on the team using the follow me emote at first I thought maybe it was to someone nearby them, but they kept doing it. I fast traveled to them followed them into the forest and there it was the wendigo colossus. It was just us two ...I had practically no ammo and some gernades. Idk how we did it, but we did it. I was honestly so shocked I wanted to give my teammate the biggest heart emote ever. It was really the last thing I ever expected.
---
Who's down voting this man??? Upvotes please
---
Oh thanks :)  .... but when did they say that it would be later today?
---
Yup this has happened to me and a few friends, especially over workshops. 
---
Sounds like what tshk80 just said. That person is a douche,  certainly   but not a hacker. With a build like that, unless you can sneak up on them and grenade the fuck oyr of them, theres no point trying.
---
The whole idea of defending a workshop from animals is strange.  Why, exactly,is a pack of dogs/rats/anglers attacking inanimate objects?  They should have stuck with humans, scorched, and super mutants attacking the workshops.  Raiders seem far more likely to want to take over a workshop, and would provide a more interesting battle since they get a wide range of weapons.  Now that they've introduced factions, the "defend" mechanism could impact their attitude towards you.
---
God bless!! Take this upvote!
---
Bloodied builds usually include unyielding armour.
---
This is what you end up with;
---
The bloodied weapon gives +80% damage.
---
Adrenal reaction goes off of low HP, so gives more damage.
---
Nerd rage procs at under 20% HP, which gives DR, AP regen, and boosts damage by a further 20%.
---
A full set of unyielding when at low health gives +15 to all stats except END. This means you have huge XP gains (INT), best prices/dialogue options (CHR), huge carry weight (STR) etc etc. So even if you had only put one pt into strength, with a full set of unyielding you would have 16.
---
Obviously for Melee builds, this unyielding STR bonus = more damage.
---
To keep your health low, bloodied players get heavily irradiated. If you use the Radicool perk, this gives +5 STR, which is more carry weight, more melee damage.
---
To avoid dying like a chump;
---
Serendipity (LCK) gives a 45% chance to simply avoid taking damage. So almost half of attacks simply do no damage at all. This works when at low health.
---
If you dont use AP (i.e. not vats or melee) then Dodgy reduces damage by 30% at the cost of 30AP per hit.
---
One level of fireproof, or using the dense mod on chest armour will remove your own explosive damage.
---
A full set of cavalier/sentinel (secondary armour ability, so it can be both unyielding and sentinel) will give a 75% chance to reduce damage by 75% when sprinting/standing still.
---
If you're particularly worried about melee damage, blocker (STR) reduces this by 45%
---
Since you have comparitively little health to heal when you get damaged, you dont need full stimpacks - dilute them and you'll have hundreds. With perks/backpack their weight is reduced by 90% and you have tons of carry weight anyway. If you start taking too much damage you just spam the quick heal button (H on pc)
---
The Sons of Dane compound (slightly north east) on the map has a chance of spawning 3 bobble heads..
---
Inside main building on a barrel on the stage.
---
Out the back in between some glass bottles.
---
In the house to the right downstairs.
---
Hope this helps üëçüèº
---
It‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm saving up my atoms. Cuz I know I can‚Äôt complete the run in time. It made me come back to game, but now I‚Äôm not sure I wanna keep going.
---
I followed a playlist on Spotify that's called something like "Songs that should be in Fallout, but aren't", or something like that.  I put it on when I get tired of the in-game songs, but still want something that would fit the game.
---
This! I like this except some events are short so it would have to be a by event basis
---
"I got one shotted and reported him for hacking"
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
How rare would this icon be?
---
Mint would be nice, and other herbs. Oooh, and maybe some foxglove and other poisonous plants so we could make poison ripped bullets and arrows.
---
There is not But ok.....
---
But it's a subliminal message that tricks you into purchasing more. XD
---
&gt; expecting others to care
---
Just wait and see the travelling you have to do to make formula P !
---
They've ignored it since it started happening...the day the game went into beta :-)
---
It could be nice. Would work because of the instanced buildings
---
I remember I read a comment today with a link that someone from Bethesda officially said so. Sorry, don‚Äôt remember but anyways I am pretty sure it‚Äôs later today considering the beret came out later similarly.
---
Hopefully will if the challenge comes around again
---
I would prefer if they removed all normal variants and added them to the government supply drops. 
---
You can only carry one and it's only got one shot but DAMN make it powerful again!
---
They seriously fucked up something with the last patch, the game has never been this laggy for me. I can‚Äôt imagine another boss being on a map with the way things are right now.
---
I hardly bother with groups. New to the game, only being playing for 2 weeks and being in the UK I only get to play in the evening between 7pm -11pm. 
---
When I have joined and got into trouble or whatever I'm still alone as most people tend to be doing g ther own stuff anyway
---
yes I saw it. I am completing an 80 atom challenge today then will def get it.
---
No they dont fucked up anything, i think its the Atlas Event, im 99% sure about it.
---
I feel you. Finished yesterday. Final score needed now is 3475 why not round it to 3500 fix it at that and make it repeatable for say a lunchbox or other reward.
---
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve started listening to classical radio. There‚Äôs actually some decent songs on there
---
I can usually do the majority of them in 30 minutes, some of the more involved ones like leveling up take longer. But you throw in nuclear winter and Jesus Christ it takes like twenty minutes to just find and start a game half the time.
---
The SBQ. You just run around in circles flapping your arms. 
---
*Bethesda I would open my wallet so fast to see groups of players doing this*
---
I got my own playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7xiuW3bS7yxWzPdlM7xCy0?si=ej1zKZlaQTa-W-xsZtG7Jw
---
thanks heaps, I really want this &amp; I've searched like five times. :)
---
I also found my first colossus in the same forest. It was a night to remember. &lt;3
---
Me too. It‚Äôs a corking good time.
---
I keep reading about lags and framedrops, i do play on PC and i haven't experienced anything different performance wise. Are these problems related to console versions? Genuinely asking.
---
Outer Worlds seemed more like a knock off Mass Effect than Fallout to me. It's an ok game, not worthy of the hype.
---
This made me laugh so hard when I read the title :D
---
Its code for "I want to do dirty stuff to you".. "butt stuff"
---
Can't you shut down the assaultrons?
---
Unless you refund the game there's really no point in these types of posts, staying or leaving. I log into 76 when I want to waste some time, then switch to another game I'd prefer to invest more effort in. Then the cycle continues, bingo bongo. I toss out legendary equipment without scriping, looting for resources is low priority, and I haven't bothered much with the season pass unlocks.
---
Always used tesla recently didn‚Äôt have influence on my game
---
LOL that's paying $150 for everything if you don't learn any score. That's not a bypass. And they've essentially canceled you earning any atoms for anything.
---
They are nice ideas but the scripts needed to implement them sound WAY too advanced for whoever they having coding the game right now. Can you imagine the endless bugs and glitches that would come from any one of these? They can't even get basic vats aiming right atm.
---
Nothing worth coming back for.
---
Only Han can Solo the Scorchbeast Queen
---
Judging how busy the servers are I'd say a lot of people are staying, it's a good thing.
---
Should just have a repeating score challenge at the end - 4000 score = 100 atoms or something
---
Or just revert back to the atoms challenges we used to have - would give me a reason to wear my clown suit again
---
Equip the perk to find them and go about your day. They are not as rare as you first think but some are in stupid spots no one would think about looking (huntersville and whitesprings golf club)
---
I‚Äôm to the point where short of sbq or encryptid I don‚Äôt have a problem killing anything but i hate working for my cranberry. Aaronholt is the place i recommend for lower lvl players cuz its a low lvl area. I‚Äôd love to find a place to farm gourds cuz i give relish away/sell it cheap in my vendors but i only farm 4 gourds/8 with green thumb
---
It's just a really obnoxious way to remove choice and enslave you. Because I want a secret fireplace door I must spend my life learning a bunch of other dumb stuff I'll never even look at.
---
They should bring him back as a CAMP Scavenging Collectron station substitute that allows you to pick up the loot from his doghouse.
---
Ngl this was sadly my first ever Fallout and find myself coming back to farm legendary scripts to one day get lucky at a 3 star 2 handed melee
---
You can only do 3 nukes per server anyway (in a short time, they reset after awhile)
---
That sounds super fun.
---
I'm on xbox and have no new issues. Even using an explosive gattling plasma, and another guy doing the same, at a glitched line in the sand.
---
I generally make s public team for whatever I'm doing.  My husband will join and within 10 minutes we have a full team.  I change it for big events or to charisma for selling.  I agree though there are generally 3-4 event groups and 1 building.
---
I just renewed my sub. Super excited for BoS content even though I‚Äôm only lvl 45. Still learning a lot every time I play. I wish I had started earlier to have a shot at getting all of the LR unlocks but I‚Äôm only at 33.
---
I honestly just stay for NW currently.
---
Refrigerator is nothing compared to 90% slower food spoilage perk though :)
---
Like others have said. The other 2 effects are very important for pricing. There is a huge difference between faster fire rate and bash damage
---
I got my sledge out and hid in the bathroom waiting for them. 
---
They debate back and forth for a while and eventually one of them says he's hungry so lets get this over with and they rush in, making a beeline for the bed.
---
Which allowed me to easily walk up behind them and whack them over the head with my rocket propelled beauty. 
---
A 3rd guy was still in the hall and I caught a .308 to the back shoulder, but one bullrush later I was wiping the blood off 'Wham Bam' and wondering to myself if I should off the lady and her husband for setting me up. 
---
My perception was rather high, so I had a hunch something was up from the start but decided not to press the issue as my curiosity had me eager for a confrontation. 
---
I rush downstairs and straight to her face, she's shaking and obviously distressed, but seems genuinely pleased that I'm still alive. I decide to spare her as I believe she is telling the truth, that her and her husband had been forced to do this. 
---
Her husband Herbert is a pathetic shell of a man at this point, just shaking back and forth mumbling that he thought they would kill him. 
---
I shake my head in disgust and place a snub nosed revolver I'd picked off one of the dead cannibals bodies on the counter.
---
As I turn to leave I tell him to learn to use it, or use it on himself, whichever was easiest.
---
I like using the exploration team when doing pvp. Maybe we could get a pvp team that gives the endurance buff and give exploration the cheaper fast travel cost like you're asking for. I'd be all for that
---
If you need legendary kills do the wolf pack event at the top left side of The Forest. You get four guaranteed legendary creatures in total (three wolf pack leaders, then another leader from the horde event that follows up). Hardly anyone touches it so its easy pick'ins.
---
It's just you. So Sorry.
---
Did you side with the raider dudes in hunter for hire quest. Would be really cool if they are rude because of that. Would have to check how they treat me.
---
I‚Äôm fallout 1st and had to jump to a private server to find one cuz everywhere i went where i thought one was i found dead bodies everywhere.
---
Yes and I don't use PA although melee is my main. I don't do optimal damage esp w my heavy guns but they're enough for queen so it doesn't bother me. I do the best damage with melee but heavy guns are better for me for queen. Her spawn- axe. Her- Gatling plasma. It's a good system for me.
---
lol it isn't one or the other, they need to fix it all. fuck out of here.
---
Ah. Then that was an oversight on Bethesda's part. Perfect opportunity to introduce two Radio stations.
---
My understanding is that the Wendigo event is instanced, so I am not sure it would put any additional load on the server with the nuke. I could be wrong, however.
---
Compared to the lmg or 50cal the gattling gun has a plethora of mods. They should get some tender lovin first
---
Aw thanks a lot for your reply! You rock.
---
I just fucking love that just as expected this sub went from at the start of the season screaming about how the entire thing was impossible to finish and designed to force people to endlessly grind and still ultimately be forced to buy ranks... to now with something like a month still remaining and so many people whining that they've already unlocked everything and deserve more.
---
The game definitely has problems but it's not enough to quit over. I spent 100.00 on a year of 1st, and I don't regret it. Beth just needs a Swift kick in the ass sometimes. These quitters don't event register on the game lol
---
Well, they did have the lounge singer in 4, so it's not unheard of for them to do something like that. Some of the songs had references to caps and such, but they were post war songs.
---
Semi related question....
---
Anyone else doing scorched earth and not getting a drop from the queen or other enemies?  I know I'm doing damage I have the number thing enabled.  I also am usually the only one with a cryolator at the event.  My husband is having the same issue too.  One time we found bones and wings under her corpse but even fast traveling go the station for her to drop in again doesn't work.  Waiting 10-30 minutes doesn't work.  No meat piles after 30 minutes either.  It's incredibly frustrating. No one else at the events got drops on our server because several people inboxed us from the event area.  Anyone know what's going on with that?
---
Alpine River Cabins (I think it's called) can spawn 2, in the first cabin after fast travel, on the top of a double bed, then in the L shaped cabin to the left of the first, under a bed IIRC. 
---
Found one there on my first try, although last time there was a bobblehead challenge I had to server hop quite a bit.
---
I recommend checking out Alpine River Cabins which has 2 bobblehead and 2 magazine spawns.
---
Bobbleheads;
---
1) South east cabin with safe, on top of leftmost bunk bed at the back.
---
2) South cabin, on floor under right side bunk, left corner hiding just behind a leg next to radiator.
---
Magazines;
---
1) South west cabin, laying on bottom bunk bed.
---
2) Treehouse just a bit up the hill, inside on table next to sleeping bag.
---
Cabins are fairly close to lighthouse too which also has 2 bobblehead spawns (one in the house top floor desk, second on a window halfway up the tower) so a good 4 possible relatively close to v76.
---
As a camp builder I appreciate the new camp items
---
I usually take 2-3 on each server.  Ammo, hemlock holes and the food place.  We generally get 1 legendary during 3+ wave defends.  I have noticed it more lately I thought it was an error.
---
PS4 has gotten noticably worse, my connection is fine and the drive on my PS4 pro has plenty of free space.
---
Even with my character inventory very low (less than 100lb) and stash size as low as possible (500ish) it's still the worst I can remember it ever being - inventories lag, crafting menus lag, building in camps is extremely laggy and sbq fights drop frame rate below 10fps.
---
Similar to has AWOL event always has a guaranteed max level legendary at the end of three waves of robots? Would certainly make me spend a lot more time on my private server if this were the case.
---
Definitely using this idea for my raider camp!
---
I got randomly lucky doing the mirelurk Mest turn in.  I had server hopped 7 times going through vault teach at center, the mining place and a few other areas.  Private servers rarely have any drops for us either.
---
I smell furry
---
Play skyrim?
---
Def worth it.  The glass displays are not great.
---
Max respect ‚úä
---
If it can be sarcastic, then it'll be used sarcastically.  That's the internet way.
---
They should let us plant starlight berries and cranberries IMO (I own a bakery with the fallout fed so I know how annoying it is to find them)
---
How can an event where you simply deposit items in a box cause lag?
---
Whatever the problem is it came in with the patch.
---
You'll get better results running 3 AP Refresh armor parts and full unyielding. PA just can't offer the massive AP pool that Unyielding provides.
---
Bethesda needs to overhaul the whole ammo crafting system and make it more like New Vegas, even if it's just a streamlined version that still uses gunpowder, lead, and steel.
---
There needs to be additional ammunition load types that players can make with additional resources that give different benefits.  AP ammo for inherent armor piercing capabilities for example.  I miss being able to switch ammo on the fly.
---
any crop that we can pick up should be plantable. its so stupid how we cant plant cranberries but we can plant blackberries
---
Yeah but I have 600 normal fusion cores and 460 Ultracite fusion cores. Might as well use them, hahahahaha. And I like PA. I like feeling like a walking tank or like a Juggernaut.
---
I recommend that you play FO3/4/NV too some time, to get more context \^\^
---
Though time-line wise it makes sense to start with FO76
---
Only put a beam splitter if it has explosive, it is a magic weapon, or if you have a reduced damage from blocking armor piece equipped. Any attacks that hit more times will do higher durability drain instead of the more intuitive condition drain every time you press the trigger, e.g. shotguns, splittters, two shot, explosives, etc. Beam Focuser is better otherwise.
---
The laser guns still have pretty low base durability, so you need to put a forceful or precise stock on it to gain some condition bar back.
---
Otherwise, the durability isn't the worst by any means.
---
And, yes, the UC laser gun does 2/3 the damage of the normal laser gun, but in commando rifle setup doesn't have any benefits such as increased fire rate.
---
All the energy weapons need to be improved substantially; even a laser gun with the same damage as a Handmade does so much less damage because energy damage vs energy resist calculation is wrong.
---
Idk why exactly, maybe because higher levels spawn in there, but the Converted Ammunition Factory usually spawns in at least one legendary every couple defenses for me.
---
This game is really fun. It‚Äôs all I play n me and my best friend have a lot of fun playing it. I got to level 53 today n I started playing like 2 or so weeks ago. There‚Äôs plenty of really annoying bugs and shitty features but overall is worth your time if you‚Äôve played fallout before
---
Two shot effectively doubles the fire rate. It's based on hits per second, rather than the fire rate Stat itself.
---
Yea, sry, i forgot, yes but still, this is a relative big event with much scripted triggers that spawns enemies, mechanism to evade etc. this needs some more Server capacities than Uranium Fever or Project Paradise as example, i think.
---
yes, the one shot players are BIG douchebags when they alone kill a legendary.
---
None of the rewards will be instantaneous. They all have a delay of a few days at least before they will be available
---
Someone drops 10 million of each item?
---
That‚Äôs too much work Bethesda is willing to put it.
---
You'll be a lot tankier using Emergency Protocols. It reduces more damage and doesn't require perks. üòâ
---
Well the event itself is instanced. So it won't be causing any server strain outside of the normal blast zone. Neither pp or uranium fever are instanced
---
I think the wayward could get rotating daily quests for both raiders and settlers that are given by "visitor NPCs" maybe add some side quests too, like a place you'd recruit a mercenary, makes sense for a post-apocalyptic bar in my opinion, maybe have some bigger jobs be done with the crew again
---
Just source your own old timey bangers
---
I can see how a lot of solo players wouldn't like this, in fact. They try to quietly take workshops and hold them without any challenges from PvP. 
---
If you guaranteed a legendary at the end of the event you'll definitely stir more interest from other players and thus increase the chance your workshop might be taken.
---
I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing ..
---
It has nothing to do with not wanting to play. It‚Äôs developers being mindful of players time.
---
The current iteration of battle pass requires you play nearly every single day for at least two hours in order to finish the Season comfortably.
---
Now, imagine knowing they‚Äôll be doing this every 10~ weeks... it‚Äôs just not a fun outlook. They need to lower the level requirements, I don‚Äôt think anything incredibly drastic like 50%, but I truly believe they need to cut it by at least 30% and introduce other ways to earn Season exp while playing the game.
---
You telling people to not earn the rewards if they can‚Äôt stand playing is exactly the reason why people are annoyed by this. They want to earn the rewards, they‚Äôre the carrot. The problem is all of the above reasons make it a horrific annoyance.
---
is there a bug in this event? all enemies were spawning at sonic generator? so we were just standing around and shooting them with explosive weapons. at the end there were probably around 100 piles...
---
I have done this dozens of times.  Someone's camp was lifted and they still got up there.  I resorted to throwing molotovs and grenades up to the camp with minimal luck.  But I've also had people tell me that being on something like a bunker, fence, or tent doesn't effect her landing.  üôÑ The second they hop down, boom she lands.
---
Like the worst thing about this is that some locations can cultivate them just fine, also goes for the regional flowers, especially in the forest there are planters of them at the wayward, I want planters like that
---
I wouldn't even mind them making planters or something mandatory for more "picky" flowers/crops
---
I'm now accepting donations for the Enclave! Donate now and together we can rebuild America! *eye roll*
---
Well. I done season tonight, so i dont care if daily score autocomplete, so i dont need to stay late and login much after resrt, so i now can enjoy game at my pace!
---
Were you on Xbox?  Pretty sure I was playing with you.  We did 2\3 and got nothing.  I know I was doing my normal amount of damage.
---
No problem. The edge of the image is stretched and there are some ui oddities but it's still playable at 32:9. the game frequently resets the resolution so I have the ini file open in notepad++ so I can easily change it back when needed
---
Man I wish all legendary effects were like that. Explosive or incendiary  rounds  with special receiver mods to accommodate them, instead of magical... I meant legendary exploding effects. Instead of another bullet appearing out of nowhere we could overcharge ammo like in FNV or full metal jackets, . Bloodied could inject you with more drugs the lower your health. And so on. I haven't thought of an answer for all the legendary effects, I'm not the creative type nor is it my job.
---
thx
---
Only issue I see there is with legendary weapon effects, it would allow two primarys so it might be crazy strong for some things and I doubt bethesda will be able to separate the effects if both are used at once example medics/vampire + bloodied/junkies
---
But if they can make it work or have a restriction to only have same the same primaries I'd love this, both for melee and pistols, would be nice to include unarmed too as they are technically one-handed as well but that would be crazy op as unarmed is really strong as is already
---
Okay but did you see the Cow grilll?  I'm so excited.
---
how DARE you not jerk the circle!!!!!
---
AGREE!  It gives me migraines.
---
It does but not whole lore wise. Tho f3 NW f4 are not that specific on lore, so it doesnt matter that much.
---
I would say f1 and f2 are better at lore and immersion etc, but they can get very boring in this age.
---
I've seen some as high as 8k and up. I was lucky to find one for 150 caps. No complaints here üòÑ
---
Came across a Legendary Scorchbeast pummeling on a Legendary Mirelurk Queen once
---
I love claiming the red rocket for the fast travel and easy cola runs and to be honest there are already some events that have a great chance of legendarys and generally give great loot, for example I had 4 waves of glowing wolfs (or mongrels not sure) recently and ended up with loads of meat to sell it easily nettet me 1k caps and with ghoul events especially I also see legendarys every once in a while.
---
The only annoying thing is the "attackers" being really passive or getting stuck inside of thigns so you need to leave the area and return to get them, I'd be fine if they just fixed that and made them more aggressive, maybe remove some boring ones like 1 wave liberators too
---
Editing it  thank you.
---
Ladders don't function in Fallout.
---
Will never happen.
---
No, I'm on ps4, but yeah same thing happened. I couldn't make enough damage tho, they didn't gave us the time for it
---
you flaired this as news. its ironic circlejerk, not news.
---
Ok that got me thank you for that
---
Yeah I know that's why I said "time line" as a general term as they are only loosely connected, was probably a bit misleading, I played FO4 first myself
---
The 'secret' room at the top of the highest building in the Abandoned Bog Town. Just go right to the top, into the elevator shaft and you'll drop 1 level into a secret office. There are some typewriters, desk fans and globes to pick up and scrap. I usually get 12/13 screws from this one room.
---
In my opinion it‚Äôs a great game, you would think the community is mean or whatever but they are super nice. There are bugs but overall it‚Äôs good. 8/10
---
How about a circular Dutch rudder?
---
No the daily that needs to go is the freaking level up one. Seriously every damn day? We don't need this. I made a new character for the stupid SCORE thing and...she's already level 65. I made her so I didn't have to grind out levels on my main character who is level 170 something...
---
And pvp I don‚Äôt like it as much but it‚Äôs like a battle royale could be better tho
---
Im my opinion, the pve is brilliant, the pvp in nuclear winter (like a battle royale type gamemode) is brilliant, the pve against bosses is thrilling, it is an overall good game:)
---
Ps the pvp isnt balanced in the pve mode because people are higher levels than others.
---
Pumpkins. That's all I freaking want.
---
might want to put more effort into your karmawhoring.
---
We always have a full group for RR.  I've never seen more than 2 at PP.
---
What‚Äôs that
---
I'm very close to the finish...I'll be so damn happy when it's over. I'll be able to take a much needed break.
---
IT DOESNT FUCKING MATTER, GIVE ME UPVOTES NOW!!!!!!!! I MADE A POST!!!! ITS IMPORTANT!!!!!!!
---
I'm stuck here, floating in Appalachia forever...
---
I have been desperately looking for royal jelly.  No one ever has it.  üò≠
---
Hey.. So I have been playing the standard open world game for about a year and despite some bad press initially and a few glitch moments, I still enjoy it. I haven't had to pay for anything else other than the game itself and my Sony PS subs. The game is now only "Wastelanders" but there are private worlds (additional cost) and a pvp game (nuclear winter).
---
I don't think you have much to lose by trying it out (which was a free to try recently).
---
Always a choice üëç
---
This is like no other Fallout game before. Online only content means no significant mods,  which means no unofficial patches by community members. Which also  means a lot of bugs will never get fixed. BGS never spent much time fixing bugs after release, they just had a dedicated player base willing to provide free labor and expertise to keep the game running.
---
Whenever I'm cooking multiples.
---
I don't get the unplayable lag often, but it's usually Radiation Rumble that takes it.
---
I did have it on Back On Beat once.
---
Tbh in a battle between the "IM UNINSTALLING" and the "EVERYONES A HATER" circlejerks, this is what this sub actually needs. A meme to save us all.
---
I've seen ones there, and broken ones in other places, but none with pa frames on it. So the mesh exists.
---
UPVOTES TO THE LEFT, NOW!!
---
They can barely get stairs to work properly and you want ladders?
---
The way I do it now is leave the vault, talk to everyone outside, go to the wayward and discover the 2 or 3 places on the way. One of which is the farm with level 1 scorched that you can kill with the machete you get from the girls at the start. Discover the overseers camp, walk into wayward and skip the dialogue and you finish the first part of that quest and level up
---
I already do that as well as extra int from 3 unyielding pieces and kindred spirit and 2 int from herd mentality
---
I mean, if you want to splash the cash on atoms, you could unlock them all today, or just grind away and then pay for unlocks on the last day.
---
Xbox One X runs with annoying stutters occasionally, but not noticed any extra FPS issues at the Queen area.
---
Yea and I said what instigating weapon?
---
The camp device spawn point effects me, not others.
---
Cheese with your w(h)ine sir?
---
I've finished and now have the freedom. To play the game how I want.  
---
I do think however that OP should have taken their time.  Between the auto complete score reductions and general grind. You can't fault players for gathering as much score as they can.
---
I 'settled' on a 3 star instigating/swing speed/+1 STR Ski Sword.
---
So long 2 star Anti Armor/swing speed baseball bat
---
I made a new character to just do the stupid SCORE run...I was planning on deleting the character afterwards but...it's kinda fun doing the raider quests lol.
---
At any rate, she's level 65 so it's not as easy to level her up these days...
---
I find scorchbeasts tedious too because I'm a bloodied stealth melee. Not easy to get them to land. The explosuve bait rarely works either.
---
I do occasionally sneak into a fissure site where they spawn and stay at ground level hovering and waiting then I can usually kill them with a hit but if they're in the air then it's not worth the time. I was fighting 2, 1 legendary, and I tried the bait a few times while they were angry and none landed. Gave up and left the area
---
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion on things! Don‚Äôt know why people care if some random isn‚Äôt playing this anymore.
---
And it does benefit me I run 14 mutations and all of them get a good boost from strange in numbers but that only work if ur teammates are mutated
---
&gt;expecting others to care about you not caring
---
I just recently started playing 76 and loving it so far
---
Add a piece of blocking armour too and / or FFR
---
See Angry Turtle vids on YouTube
---
I definitely miss the people I met. The laughs about the bugs and glitches. The annoyance of bugs and glitches. We still enjoyed the game, but of course eventually they moved on and playing other games now. All I have is memories but damm... I cherish them. Even as I wonder the wasteland alone, I‚Äôm still fighting the bugs and glitches and BS Bethesda throws at me. I love this game.
---
I hope that event gets better rewards than I got today. I saw my first wendigo colossus today and solo'd it in the cranberry forest near the prime fissure and got a 2 star leather arm...
---
If the grind was fun and easy it wouldn't be a grind
---
This seems like a Kahn trick...
---
But not everyone can play everyday and a lot of the time i get on just to do the dailys because I don't have a lot of time so spending one half of my time doing the first 8 challenges then the rest either farming or making a new character is a bit long. When i have more time to play and fqrm and level yo no problem, just annoying that they make you do it everyday. There's 10 weeks of this so that would be 70 levels by the end and who really needs that other than low levels. If it was every other day that would be fine because 2 or 3 days if just the dailys get almost half a bar of xp so you can naturally level up that often too. And they know that because there's a weekly for 3 level ups
---
Just seen that it's been 6 days since commenting on this and today is the day I can complete the final S.C.O.R.E. to get the chicken coop.  
---
I've completed every score challenge daily and weekly except for 3 NW challenges that weren't passive mode, and on those days I completed the 10k repeatable's 3x each...  
---
Thats 9 levels in 6 days!.............  I didnt realise it was that slow.
---
I would like "Mutant's" behave like Bloodied/Junkies.
---
"Damage increases for 3% (maybe 5%? per Mutation you have." Capping at the usual 50%.  
---
This would mean people have to get most of the mutations and live with its potential drawbacks (or of course using Class Freak).
---
karmawhoring is what you are doing.
---
First playthrough, in the vault where you get the GECK, getting shat on by super mutants, hiding and crying in the toilets, drinking toilet water to get my health back up. Loved that game.
---
I dont hate magical weapons, i hate magicians. Scorchbeast queen spawned, ppl started shooting and before it even triggered the legendary mitation, it's dead. Nobody gets the loot unless they were teamed up with the magician.
---
Mine was when I was the last one with one other player...so it was a 1v1 with people watching...I had grabbed guns, armor and aid over the whole match...and brought out my best gun, hunted the other guy down and we had ourselves a good shoot out. I barely managed to keep alive but yeah I killed him lol. It was such a fucking rush.
---
I‚Äôve slogged through all the bugs and drama too long to give it up now. Now that my favorite faction is making an appearance I too will be walking the Appalachian hills for a while longer.
---
Well that's not entirely true as the event is spawned in instances.  Meaning they are separate to the world.  
---
If anything it's because these 8 player instances need a better matchmaking system.  As some people reported loading into an instance would place with players that were not on their team.
---
Even angry turtle couldn't 1 hit the scorchbeast queen dealing about 10,000 damage without adrenaline perk it took 4 hits with a bloodied power fist
---
its the 76 subreddit, its going to tell you every reason why you should get the game.
---
yeah get it if you can a deal on it. its playable and fun, but has a litany of serious issues.
---
The more mods, the better!
---
Now I can understand that.
---
You obviously haven't played the for a long time i only got drills from 3*s
---
Nah,I have done the queen loads, just had 2 1* in a row and its just like like what's the point in using all that ammo
---
Woah, woah woah, when did this happen? I've been waiting for the Thanksgiving display case for months. Didn't see it in Tuesdays refresh.. what category is it under, and when does it expire?
---
And thats the point thats why they made the even rewards a set 2*
---
Man calm down, he might've just forgot to switch weapon for lower damage or didn't know how much damage he actually did if he isn't experienced
---
Yep same here... I'll be playing until the day the servers get nuked..
---
You have to do a minimum of 1k damage to her, right after you load in, if the event has already started, hit vats, you should have the AP glitch where you never run out of Ap. Even with a 1* handmade, just keep firing, that‚Äôs the only resent time I got something
---
that would still do so much damage that probably not everyone can get a hit in though tbh.
---
Like this idea. Exploration should encourage ... EXPLORATION!  
---
I would add on top of 25% lower caps -&gt; 5% Faster movement per bond. Of course for the end game players with Speed Demon this doesn't do anything but Explorer would me more suited for beginners/midgame players anyway. With that they can fast travel freely and move faster to discover the map a lot quicker. AND if they land in the Cranberry Bog Area... Rip newbies :)
---
Using **Guns &amp; Bullets 5** will give more scrap from weapons. I haven't tried it with these pistols but I have walked out from *Line in the Sand* close to 5k steel after scrapping.
---
I'm stuck here for the long-run. At least Fallout 76 actually runs/has things to do unlike some games (Red Dead Redemption 2 (Online) for example is completely ruined now since the last update/patch - like literally unplayable)
---
I've sticked around Fallout 76 for about 2 years, definitely not quitting.
---
And you expect me to care about you staying?...
---
I'm sad that they sold the Nuka Girl costume, but not her hairstyle, because i'd be rocking that shit all day. It's just such a wasted opportunity to see that tab... empty
---
Kinda, yes. But with public teams you can fast travel to a camp of an ally and from there you can start exploring. After you have a nearly full inventory of junk, fast travel to your camp, deposit the junk and fast travel, free, back to the point you where.
---
Stopped playin for a year (idk why) came back and wow sooo much fun idk
---
Neat, to each their own.
---
If you don't like the bugs in the game, may I suggest equiping the Exterminator perk? :D
---
Reminds me of when people said battlefield hardline was trash but it was actually one of the best installments in the franchise if you look at the overall picture. Everyone says this games trash and it‚Äôs dead ..I‚Äôm just like, more for me to enjoy I guess
---
#metoo
---
I'm not a hardcore endgame player and 2 specific events seem to be designated as 'level 100 or above' as far as the players are concerned. 
---
Encryptid.
---
Project Paradise. 
---
These are the two that get you the most hate when you don't know *exactly* what to do every second that ticks down. These are the events that instead of getting to enjoy, you spend getting emoted at and wondering what the problem is. 
---
Other events have a more casual feel to them, if they fail oh well, everyone goes about their business without fanfare. 
---
Encryptid and Paradise though? You show up to one of those and even if you do a good job you are just as likely to get hounded and stalked by some moron that assumes you were the reason they didn't get 'X' drop from 'Y' mob. 
---
Uranium Fever used to be the same way.
---
I think this stems largely from the (50+) warning that you get on the elevator. Remove that 'warning' and you'd end up getting more newbies showing up, and thus getting familiar enough with the mechanics to not fail the next time.
---
People are complaining that they have to log in to do dailies and then go to play another game...
---
How's that support what you're saying?
---
Also, how does it take you two hours to eat bubblegum or buy 3 pieces of ammo out of a player's vend?
---
I've been playing for around 2-2.5 weeks and I'm almost 2/3 of the way through the Legendary Run and you're saying it lasts 10 weeks.
---
So by my estimations, I should finish around 3 and a half to 5 weeks.  That's 5 extra weeks of breathing room?
---
How is anyone having problems with this?
---
I don't even do the NW challenges and sometimes I don't finish all the dailies.
---
LOL, I remember making sure Jericho was always  had a cigarette  in Fallout. He would even smoke with a power armor helmet on
---
Why can‚Äôt they use a shit weapon if they want to play too
---
yes its playable, and enjoyable. but there are alot of problems with the game too. and it often takes a very long time for issues to get fixed. you like mmos, but unfortunately, this game is missing alot of core features that those type of games have, and that this game should too.
---
PvE is fun, but there is a learning curve in some respects. you will have alot of agency in how much challenge you want as you get into endgame.
---
PvP has been busted and broken since day one, and its pretty much dead.
---
nuclear winter is fun if you like a janky BR, its doesnt take itself too seriously.
---
i recommend getting the game at a discount if you are new to fallout.
---
Scrap the junk you collect,bulk it if possible and then store it.That way you minimize the space your crafting materials are taking up.
---
Ammo probably sells the best,5.56 is probably your best bet.
---
Your camp limit doesn‚Äôt change,everyone has the same limit regardless of level.
---
Yup. I had several copies of that issue during the steel collection and did the same
---
On a gauntlet I got a bss+1s on the 3rd roll, but on another character it took a whole month to get my first unyielding ss piece of armor &amp; it was a crappy 2* piece. So you win some, you lose some.
---
Games are not airports, you don‚Äôt need to announce your departure.
---
I'm staying cause I enjoy the game overall but I'm not doing any of that material shot for atlas
---
What's bull about this is that they will chase you to the edge of the map extremely beyond watoga unless you fast travel and they kept giving chase and never giving up. I like wasted 20 stimpacks while my power armor is perfectly undamaged it won't protect me from there beams. I only retaliate when I am attacked first that's just how it goes.
---
But my mission was to do brotherhood of steel and they decided to pick a fight for no reason. They need to extremely tone down npcs from moving super mega far from where they spawn or where they started at. A NPC Enemy should not be chasing you non stop until the edge of the map that's just broken.
---
2nd or 3rd try SS chest unyielding 50%reduced fall damage +1Str
---
Stupidly easy if you get her in the glade. Wee bit easier if shes in the open. 
---
Hopefully Earl Williams will be more of a challenge than what we have now.
---
If FO76 was his first FO then it's likely he's young. Both FO3 and FO NV look dated as fuck, so it could be hard for him to get through them. FO4 may not be the best of the series, but it hasn't dated so much yet, and may be easier to get into for someone not used to games having less polygons than 2B's ass
---
My Fancy shotgun can one shot miners and ghouls.
---
I did forget to switch that time for the legendary.
---
Usually I use the shottie on regular miners.
---
Not really.
---
But whatever.
---
I‚Äôm staying as a casual complaint loser, play everyday for 2 hours.
---
I've got to score 42 (I think), and have basically stopped played. The gameplay is now grind for settler/raider rep, grind for SCORE and grind for Bullion.
---
I'm no longer playing the game, I'm grinding the game. 
---
Gaining Rep and SCORE should be the result of playing normally (exploring, questing, encounters), having to go out the way to do extra repeative tasks is not good game design. Sure, have some daily tasks, but don't make that basically the only way to gain points.
---
In all aspects the amount of rep/score/currency you gain is pitiful. TBH, nothing since the wastelanders update has been engaging.
---
I usually do them even if I'm alone. Not saying that I successfully complete them but when I see Project P. I instantly go there for the alpha, xp and acid. Radiation rumble is even better cause if you are on a full building team you're almost guaranteed a level-up. Also it gives decent junk
---
Or there‚Äôs just a smaller amount of servers.
---
Omg he actually did. Thats what makes this post actual circlejerk.
---
Lol, you guys need to learn what PSA means.
---
Or make it so the boss at the event is a higher scaled enemy. A lot tougher. 
---
Then just have the legendary reward pop up at the end of the event
---
That's the dream right there
---
I've gone through more than 100 modules to get a full set of unyielding that's worth wearing. I've since given up trying.
---
Would love to win at some point lol
---
first they must play own game to see how bad balanced it is. 
---
Joke aside. Agree, this game need balance update but they should hire someone competent.
---
Yeah but i didnt get a second unyielding + reduced fall damage for any of the limbs
---
That's the point I'm getting to. Took 25 attempts for the RA and it was (surprise surprise) 1star
---
This is obvious karmafarming.
---
Happened to me yesterday on the same event.
---
Same
---
They sort are, there are more desirable but their still nice spots.
---
Also again, still haven't experienced the lag other people have and with the pattern of being kicked from the server when someone else joining has their camp/tent there would only increase the frequency.
---
Eh either way am happy playing and because of the S.C.O.R.E challenges there are a lot more people joining the public events it's good to play along side so many that enjoy the game as I do.
---
Ah see, i chop and change between crafting and getting 3* from the purveyor, gotta crap from crafting, all the 3* were troubleshooters and exterminators, along with 1 and 2* ( probably about 8 in all). Got a medicore 3* chest and left leg from the friendly moleminer and nothing since :/
---
Edited. Sorry total noob on selling
---
Yeah that's kinda how I feel. It would inspire me to make more characters the idea of having to get plans again holds me back
---
Edited. Noob mistake in my behalf
---
They would still sell to the people collecting those items cause there will always be a new player hunting and collecting the plan. The Plan Collectors discord is full of such players
---
Cap limit wouldn't be bigger it would just be the shared cap pool you already have. So you have the ability right now to store 150k to all ya characters just make all them accessible for any character your on

Limb Damage. It‚Äôs a bugged effect that causes a damage-overflow, resulting in obscene amounts of damage on rapid firing weapons. When using VATS, all pellets hit simultaneously and count as separate ‚Äúbullets‚Äù, which is basically rapid fire in an instant, resulting in the bug. 
---
The same effect can be observed on flechette harpoon guns (VATS only), high-speed miniguns, and usually two-shot automatic weapons with around 100 fire rate.
---
1 cap per chjarge is the usual price as others have said but I tend to sell them a bit cheaper. It is likely your camp location that is the problem since they sell okay for me at 75 caps for full charge. I advise you to place your camp at/near more traveled locations or by Vault 76 so they do not have to pay extra to travel to your camp. The ideal locations that I know of are near the purveyor, near SBQ spawn (if you got the balls), near the raider/settler bases, and/or near gold vendors.
---
People leave that preposterous and they should all be flogged ü§£, in all seriousness I have had friends that have left and been burnt out or its not engaging for them anymore, so have gone off playing different games, I have the perfect solution, I divide my playing time between fallout 76 and a something different, last week I got the platinum on Spiderman and finished it on ultimate this week I'm playing ghost of Tsushima while still hitting level 91 on the score.
---
Definitely
---
No you cant do that.
---
This is pretty much what I wanted to say but every time I say you shouldn't only have low health for everything with a bloodied build, I get down voted enough to get my comment hidden xD
---
you do realise that the only way Bethesda "balances" weapons is to nerf the shit out of them. if they did anything they wouldn't raise the damage of others but nerf bloodied to match. plus it's the unyielding armour that makes the build. being able to run all stats above 30 points and perception, agility and luck above 40 is why it's so damaging.
---
Yeah mainly wish for plans to be shared would be neat if they could do that ü§£

probably a magic shotgun

---
The limb damage effect is bugged. It makes the shotguns do excessive damage. The same happens with shotguns with 33% vats hot and bashing damage. Only works in vats. Check out a video about this by a youtuber called Angry Turtle
---
Yeah, I dont understand why mutants isn't done similar to junkies. Big time missing the boat with mutant prefix
---
I played since wastelanders and I'm about to launch my first nuke at lvl 90! This game is awesome. It has it flaws but what game in this era doesn't? I love pimping my camp and I love exploring on my own tempo.
---
Ah I see your point there in that regards
---
I've been trying to fit out 3 characters in ss armor. A bit over the Dr appt rolls. I did the vault raids a few times &amp; had the solar plans. Best full health armor. Second roll unyielding AP refresh wwr, so now I think ill just run a set of that &amp; I've got another AP refresh piece since. Guaranteed 3 star role &amp; would be perfect for a bloodied junky - when needed low health, when not high health with awesome health regeneration.
---
well if you want a full set you're in for a hell of a grind
---
Ugh, you and me both, fellow traveler. I just love having to go to work knowing all of the front office, salaried people get to 'work' from home.
---
I don‚Äôt think bloodied builds require too hard of a nerf, particularly because it‚Äôs a very high-risk, high-reward effect. Even with unyielding and perk cards you die quite quickly. Over-nerfing bloodied builds would just risk bricking the play-style which I don‚Äôt think is needed.
---
Would be a realy great emote to! Chilling lol
---
OK, what you have there is a "magic shotgun" - it's the limb dmg effect that makes this happen. 
---
In a nutshell - some legendary effects cause odd behaviour in the game, primarily ridiculously high damage, particularly amongst shotguns and high rate of fire weapons.
---
For shotguns, it seems that these make the vat shots do the guns dmg per pellet, so you're essentially doing x7 dmg.
---
If you have a look at angry turtle on YouTube he goes much more in depth.
---
Cool, thank you
---
I didn't say it was needed, but that Bethesda only balances things by nerfing what's good, regardless of game, that's how they balance.
---
You can make up to 10 of them in your camp, too. This means you can categorise your food, to an extent. I tend to just have three though, divided into combat buffs/int or exp buffs/ingredients. This is great cos I don't really care about food to the extent of allocating three perk points to it nor enough to use the Grocer's backpack mod over the Chemist's.
---
I would love to play it more, but load times preclude me from doing so.
---
Cranberries, brain fungus and snap tail is all I need ;)
---
Apparently, you could scrap it and learn it‚Äôs recipe so that you can build another one at a higher lvl. But then Bethesda has a great idea (sarcasm) and they changed it so that you cannot craft the helmet anymore. So essentially, if you still have the helmet it‚Äôll stay at lvl 15 and you won‚Äôt learn it‚Äôs recipe if you scrap it. You can‚Äôt trade, can‚Äôt display it, it and it weighs ~10lbs. 
---
If you scrapped it before and learned it (like I think op described), then it‚Äôs gone forever and you cannot craft another one.

The lowest level flamer is 30. And it doesn't appear to have a lot of static spawn points: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flamer_(Fallout_76)

I price all my stuff at 10% or lower of their value, some can be sold to the vendor bots for slightly more, but I'd rather a player gets some use of it rather than being lost into oblivion.

Uranium fever needs tweaking. Nobody is going to get the ore and risk missing out on legendaries and enemy XP. I did it once and the rewards were not worth the missing XP and missing legendaries.
---
Its like a rubbish version of project paradise where the collecting and enemy spawning is too disconnected.
---
Ahh I see what you‚Äôre saying. Yes I do notice that trend. I think they need a much bigger team to work on this game if they‚Äôre in it for the long-run, with a sub-team exclusively for balancing purposes.
---
Wind up is too slow, and i miss headshots w/ vats at 95% even tho I  wind  it up  first then vats and shoot asap

Is the same true for vampire?

I would just like to inform you all that I am returning.

That is all.
---
Let's be honest, not only did FO3 and FO4 NOT age well, the gameplay also blows. I never really finished FO3 because the gunplay was so frustrating and FO NV is just as bad.
---
Sure, the story and RPG is "better" but in between those gems you are walking around and screaming WHY WILL YOU NOT DIE WITHOUT VATS.

I won a Nuclear Winter the other day!

Kinda the joke dude! I don't expect people to give two shits what I do (just like NOBODY CARES who's leaving).

I've got a full set after approx 120 modules... 2 if those are 1* that I'm still trying to reroll everyday. At this point I think I would have been better if using my old armor set and picking up the strangler heart power armor rather than wasting so many modules

I use my x-01 helm with the t-65 armor only way around this stupid issue Iv messages then Iv logged it with support ticket and they never reply ticket just vanishes

Taking breaks is always good . Lets you get a fresh perspective on a game and have more fun. I'm back from a break too. Gonna try out a build with those "gun" thingies people keep talking about. I dunno I'm just used to punching stuff.

But if you don't announce that you leave, Bethseda won't take notice and make all the changes you demand of them. Don't you get it, they have so much leverage over Bethseda and other game companies it would be stupid not to try to use that as ransom.
---
I don't hate nuclear winter, I'm just not a fan of battle royal games in general. That's why I bought a MMO slash RPG slash survival game and not an BR game. Now they try and force me to play NW, now that I strongly dislike.
---
I felt it was news.
---
Like the clowns announcing they're leaving....
---
It could be a dream come true for me, but man the gameplay and graphics are so bad and unpolished that I can't stand it. For God's sake, this game supposed to be a game for 2019 until maybe 225 or something. Or maybe more. This quality is not acceptable.
---
You can leave anytime ;)

YES.

THIS TOO IS NEWS.

What platform are you on? I think I have a Vampire's Grognak's Axe in my vendor right now. I think it's at least 2 star, could be 3. I'm on PS4 and you can have it if you want.
---
Oh shid ur right. 
---
The people NEED to know this.
---
There are only 2 or 3 material types that weigh less when bulked.  Lead and then aluminum (I think it's aluminum anyways).  There might be one other.  Bulking anything else is just wasting time and plastic unless you plan on selling it to a robot vendor.
---
I played this event yesterday and the day before and players all gun bashed it and used the Follow emote to get everyone to come over. Level 200s were there too!
---
It would be great synergy if that worked on mutants armour pieces as well!
---
Well,if op is staying,I‚Äôm staying
---
I'd stay but i cant play for it constantly crashing to desktop since the update
---
There is a BoS event going on. Basically some scavenger was salvaging BoS equipment and heard a broken transmission of a BoS Expedition from California on its way to WV. He decides to take over the position the BoS is going to inhabit and starts construction on a base for the BoS before they get there. So we are now donating supplies to help build the base.
---
For the anger, well I read that a lot of old bugs came back and they decided to fix a few CAMP exploits that caused no harm to anyone and allowed for some really fun looking bases.
---
I drift back in when theres something i wanna do, i cant grind this game like i do Destiny there isnt an activity structure its Fallout lol and all the Legendaries are in one massive pool
---
But i love this game and nothing is gonna get me to leave permanently. Especially if i wont be seeing a new solo Fallout game for a while (still holding onto the dream of a Fo3 or FNV remaster)
---
They haven‚Äôt made their first synth yet, let alone their Gen 3s...
---
That's exactly my point.
---
All those high levels going to events where low levels congregate for legendaries, to take it from said low levels.
---
The amount of High Level cocky shits at the fasnacht event.. I feel bad for low players.
---
I love how i recommended angry turtle yesterday, for someone with encryptid problems. And today i see you recommending him, both for the same reasons, he is detailed and goes in depth. The best fo76 content creator atm imo
---
First 2 ranks of each damage card and tank 3 tank killer pts and 90% damage . 90% damage with a pipe revolver is the same as 60% with the western, but you have the advantage of of a supressor. That frees up room in agility for sneak covert operative and 5pts In adrenaline to make up the damage loss. You would probably end up doing more damage actually.
---
Oh damn really I loved building different bases and crap like that so I can see the anger
---
It wouldn't surprise me
---
Some weapons start at level 1 and others at level 5. Weapons that start at level 1 can go all the way up to 50, weapons that start at level 5 only go up to 45 and they dont go beyond that because if it continued up to 95-100 pretty much every weapon would OHK, and Bethesda doesn't want that
---
Yes the lag is horrid.
---
I'm almost certain there is a memory leak in one of the updates. The lag is computer side and progressively gets worse over time. A computer restart seems to clear up the lag quite a bit. So highly recommend a restart right before you start your play session every day.
---
That's what I don't get about this game or me. I've had it since release and been so wound up by everything that's happen and still happens but still play the damn game most days! üòÇüòÇ
---
Agreed. I think they need more armor to boost stats other than DR/ER. Same with nocturnal. I also think they should add some prefixes that boost 2 special stats by 4 so you could outclass unyielding whith a full set for specific builds while keeping unyielding worthwhile option to boost everything.
---
I've been caught out with a few trap bases in my earlier levels, I found it funny and then went back to try work out how they did what they did. I admire the creativity on some of them, one I'm wary of is the confetti on the floor as I've fallen into a pit of punjani boards before.
---
From that point forward, I never go shopping with junk on me. Some trap base owners give your stuff back, but most don't. Be careful out there!
---
trap bases break up the monotony. its too bad that people get so salty about them. stash your junk lol.
---
Then u ahould be leveling up just fine if you do a couple of queens and cryptids...
---
So tedious farming
---
Yeah, It's apparently something dealing with a door? I never used it for I only use my camp as a giant farm resource and for a mid map quick travel station. So i never knew about it.
---
Everyone? Punish? no. I play and try to be as nice as i can be. I am however PLAYING which means I am not going to be very careful ever. The fact that we are all waiting on mobs to attack and trying to get every single one is Bethesda's game design.
---
After thousands and thousands of scrip, I have 2 bolstering sentinel legs, bolstering 50% fall dmg arm, and a less than ideal unyielding chest and arm, still trying for a third uny
---
I use the perk manager and better inventory, haven't bothered with the others there are some borderline cheaty mods that i'd rather avoid. like the one that shows you where the weak spot is for lock picking.
---
the problem with the mod support is that, you have to manually update the custom.ini every single time the game updates. there is a list of files that load with the game, your mods are in this list but the list also changes when the game updates if they add new texture files and other files. the custom.ini doesn't get updated and has to be done manually.
---
I don't think we'll get mod support unless they can figure out a way of updating your custom.ini without ofc stopping your mods from loading. that would require a script of some sort that can read your custom.ini, find the name of your mod files and add them into the updated ini automatically.
---
I find it frustrating that there are zero skins for pipe weapons. I would like to have a chrome/ cherry wood skin for my pipe weapons
---
Exactly! Untarnished or something that boosts special at high health. Similar to the bolstering/vanguard effects! I don't think this would lessen the benefits of bloodied builds at all as the extra damage from adrenal, nerd rage and bloodied weapons will never be beaten. It would just provide an opportunity for a high powered tank style character to also have great special stats.
---
Then you're our people!
---
Ill spend large amounts of caps on so many things, but ill look at 17 caps for a fast travel and think about it
---
I got some u can have add vic1ous-kr3ep on PSN
---
I have zero reason to think it, but I've wondered if support is so haphazard because they're preparing a V.2 for next-gen consoles. Just an idle, unsupported thought.
---
Otherwise, I agree with the OP. I'd happily screw around with the old content while they concentrated in getting their act together.
---
Also for farming I recommend taging junk objects in your inventories for looting your probly passing things you want and don't even know it i know i was on my first two carechters now that I tag for search what I need (screws) i have 500 both my other characters have maybe 20
---
Limited time rewards (a bloodied chef outfit, a banner and a giant hammer iircc) and I'm pretty sure "event grahm" is also a vendor like "normal grahm" so you don't need to search for him on rng encounters to get the exclusive stuff he have. 
---
This will my first meat week all of that is info a just found about the event.
---
Um no, what you all seem to forget get is that those level 300's were the little guy once and had the exact same thing done to them now stop moaning pay your dues and get better at shooting the legendaries I mean come on you want something just for turning up how fucking lazy
---
Aww, I hope they're donating them for atlas. I always scrap and stash all my junk because they are so heavy.
---
It sucks we cant exchange SS with other players. I got 2 x unyielding pieces, a 3* and a 2* and all I could do was scrip them because Im not bloodied.
---
Never genuinely understood it as well.  
---
I've been in all the meatweeks, got the rewards and the weapons, but beside that, i don't see anything special with it.  
---
Yeah ok weapons are ok-ish so the vanity items, but the sheer of frustration given by the people who don't know what to do, resulting in a complete failure of the event, is unbelievable.
---
To a starving person, everything is delicious.
---
Also Graham is a sweetie.
---
It's an event that breaks the monotony of the usual events and it has some unique rewards. Essentially that's it I think. It doesn't do anything for me personally but on the other hand, I'm hanging for Halloween.
---
I made one.
---
It's not so much expecting others to care, it's more letting Bethesda know they're losing at least *some* of their player base by not caring about the franchise.
---
I realise it hasn't worked in any meaningful way, which genuinely makes me sad.  Micro-transactions, pay to win, not taking the time to deliver on their promises, and straight out lying...  It's a pretty bitter pill to swallow, especially when you genuinely care about the games.
---
For me, the pay to win/subscription thing was the final straw.
---
I really loved Fallout 3, New Vegas and 4.  But Bethesda then isn't Bethesda now, and I doubt it ever will be again.  Which is ok, I suppose, games as a service with subscription etc. is the way games will go as long as gamers want it.
---
no, i dont feel the need to post whether i am playing this game or not.
---
either type of post is annoying and unnecessary unless they have well though out insight. this post doesnt have that im afraid, just like the uninstalljerk posts.
---
Didn't buy anything at someone's camp yesterday cause he was having a strobe party at the vendors, all I could think was if I had even a single % of epilepsy I would b a goner now.

Mutants could use a buff, but in no way should.be as strong as Junkies.

Heh, that did make me lol

I got a 3,2 and a 1 star legendary yesterday when defending a workshop I was surprised, is this a new thing?
---
I would have said to put a cork in it but you'd probably wine about it later.
---
Radiation rumble*
---
&gt; the sheer of frustration given by the people who don't know what to do, resulting in a complete failure of the event, is unbelievable.
---
Here's your problem. Your aren't interested in the rewards but are perturbed when you don't get them. 
---
For those of us that actually don't give a damn about the rewards, the atmosphere is electric! It's one big party (literally) and we're all invited. I got so many snapshots of crazy antics, people playing drums with the Tenderizer, people hobnobbing and goofing off with Chally and Grahm. Great times! 
---
But yea, if I was only doing them for the cash and prizes... I'd get rather miffed myself.
---
meat
---
That's the same with me, I got a few decent Vanguard pieces (I think one had 50% less fall damage too) and just scripped it because I can't do anything with it
---
They didn't. There just isn't a level cap on your character to allow you to get perks etc.
---
This is an early trick I learned. It does increase sales. However I have found much better psychological triggers over time. I've noticed The traffic signal works best with the slocum Joe robots. I take a lot of workshops for build testing so I keep selling the same plans over and over. Also putting your generators or any noise making machines near enough seems to give the psychological need to buy.
---
Why? They would just ruin it like the outdoor lounger. (You sit on the edge of it)
---
It never fails. Every day but bobble head days I will find them a lot randomly. But on bobble head day it‚Äôs a huge undertaking!
---
This was actually changed a while ago so the required game files are hardcoded to be loaded, so you only need to list your mods in the custom.ini (and oh boy was that nice).
---
so you do the EXACT same thing same them?
---
thats just makes  YOU the next clown. and no this is NOT news, thats clickbait
---
Stunning and brave.
---
[Take a look at this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1sg7L4P7UT4mycr7JF-aXvf5gjFtsyAfUH3qjeiV03y8/htmlview). It gives recommended levels of each type of scrap. You may end up tweaking it but it's a place to start.
---
Was it me with the nuka lamps? Cause I love them
---
Oh, so is that the reason I sometimes don't get any loot from the SBQ? I am always annoyed when that happens, cause I invested lots of ammo... besides my time ;)
---

---
Litteral right up the river. The Ohio River starts in Pittsburgh and runs along the West Virginia borders
---
you have never played Uranium Fever have you? there are several possible spawns for legendaries, and you have no way of being at all of them at once. There is a high chance that the legendary will be wiped before you even see it.   
---
Killing the legendaries instantly without letting others tag them is plain being an asshole. There is a big part of the community that understands that and makes sure everyone gets to tag the legendary before it dies. If you're lvl 300 and think it's okay to just instakill that 3 star legendary then you're just a dickhead, simple as that.
---
oh thats cool, It has been a while since I played last and I updated the game yesterday to jump in and do some wandering, I thought the list looked a little smaller. but this is cool to know, before you could break the game pretty badly if you didn't update the custom ini, there would be invisible walls and missing textures alsorts of crazy stuff.
---
Yeah its a waste. i gave up trying for vanguards. never got a single piece. I just cherry picked the best out of a bunch of random pieces and called it a day. One day ill try and improve on some of them but itll do for now
---
I am staying as well! I like the way it hurts.
---
Prime meat cook cook
---
Yup, the guide should have told him this..
---
It's not even using shit weapon, if you're in PA or any high level armor you can simply melee the legendary once and just stand there. Most its gonna cost you is one stimpak, but even that rarely happens. The molerats deal shit damage, so high lvl chars can easily tank them for a reasonable amount of time.
---
I've beaten both games multiple times, and I could see where you are coming from with the lack of iron sights in FO3, but it's really not as bad as you make it sound haha
---
Now I want a facelift but wasteland style.
---
seen people sell them for no more than 1k. only use is for distant thunder i believe. 
---
i scrapped mine by accident which is fine as i'd rather murder all the scorched myself
---
Not much seeing as everyone can get them
---
It's hard to say, since the game isnt 100% accurate, geographically.
---
Its safe to say that's it's just a bit north up the river.
---
But at the same time, in real life grafton is a good bit south of Morgantown, not north as the game portrays.
---
Yeah, I remember a couple times getting something shiny new from the atom shop only for the assets to not actually be there cause I hadn't checked to update the ini, lol.
---
Sounds like you actually missed the second meat week also lol. 
---
And it‚Äôs very much an overhyped event IMO. It can be fun but the events are too frequent IMO and it gets kind of boring. I prefer mischief night.
---
I still love fol4, didnt finish main,
---
But power armors love at first sight(i think that how they always should be, and not apparel like f3 NW) 
---
I would say, f3 was my real playing. But i played fol 2 cheated(all special high), and had fun(tho i was dumb teen back then)
---
Best Fo76 side out there!
---
That's strange, because we're helping two new people in the clan and both completed the main storyline (year 1) without issues.  
---
Afaik theres one quest of year 2 "Ounce of prevention" that can break if you put the blood sample before the T breaker. That's the only one i know that block you to go further.  
---
But related to year 1, the overseer journey, nothing to report, they completed it succesfully in the past 2 weeks.
---
Ooh, flechettes! I've been a fan of them since I first saw them at a gun show years back. I'd love to have a flechette load for a shotgun or even a pistol.
---
In the atom store. In the end tab with the free stuff and offers at the bottom. Flag added today apparently
---
nothing, they are pointless.

You can enter before doing it.  I found it on my own before I even got to Foundation.
---
I've been here since giant spaghetti dogs and invincible enemies that can still kill you, I've 2500 hours and have pretty much every god roll (except legacy lasers...meh). 
---
I'll probably play this game for as long as it's supported, I may have a week off here or there but I can always think of something to do and enjoy the game play.
---
The bugs don't bother me at all, sometimes reading posts on here it's like we're playing 2 different games.
---
Everyone gets a set when they do the Imposter Sheepsquatch quest line but players scrap them accidently or gt rid of them and then regret it later. I wouldnt price them super high but at a reasonable price youd probably sell them for someone with scrappers regret
---
yeah the map is weird, its like most of the state warped into a small square.
---
yaint walking from Grafton to Charleston in an hour lmao.
---
It's treason then.
---
Yeah nah. That boils down to your personal opinion really, imo FO4 was good. I had plenty of fun with it. Gameplay in Fallout series isn't that bad. In FO4 you can easily roll without using VATS even once. FO3 and FONV didnt age well mainly graphically. Other than that gameplay and story holds up.  Gunplay in earlier games from the series is what fallouts gunplay is. It's not supposed to be a call of duty, it's not about sprinting around jumping and dumping bullets around. It's supposed to be something that isn't based around reflexes, but rather levels, damage and armor, which is how rpgs are supposed to work.
---
Had to unload a full clip of a primed explosive LMG with full demo just to kill one ant in tea time. Not amused.
---
Too frequent? I see that as a plus.
---
I only found the cave entrance for The Deep last night for the first time. i didnt go all the way in though. I wish I could remember where i saw the Cave Fungus. Theres another kind of fungus that grows in The Burrows too I think. It had some other name though but it looked like the glowing fungus I think
---
I‚Äôm assuming your using a lever. That buikd will one shot everything outside of events. Scorchbeasts and sheepys. In events it‚Äôs very brittle. Even at 100% you‚Äôll die fast if touched by melee.

Make the kahns great again

Did we complete the concrete challenge then? I'm not sure how to check the progress

If they add this they need to add lung cancer as a possible side effect. If Appalachia didn't get you smoking will.
---
BTW I'm not one of those anti smoking peeps, ex smoker just thought the joke was too good.
---
I'm just hyped to see Grahm.  Levels 10-50 I used to see him all the time.  Now haven't seen him in months.
---
Lol I'd love just being able to smoke for immersion
---
Of course I've played uranium fever as a low level and a high level So I  can see both points of view and of course I have had people one shot enemies so I couldn't get the loot is it frustrating yeah but on the flip side you gotta realize you can't compete with those guys, the answer is get to that level yourself and stop  whining and complaining and expecting stuff for just walking in the door I'm not the dickhead  you entitled little wanker
---
I got a 3* unyeilding USSS left arm and 3* unyielding chest piece within the first 10 legendary modules I ever spent on crafting the armours. And now I'm up to 181 legendary modules spent on the other  3 pieces and haven't seen another unyielding piece. I'm one piece away from a full set of Troubleshooters though :/
---
Me too bro. I can take the minor bugs and meh prises all day. It's no prob.
---
I‚Äôve recently started a new character and have done all the main story line. Where have you got up too? Are you over level 20 as you can‚Äôt complete the overseers quest until you are.
---
Yeah in two days we got 4.2 million of 150 million. Then we added 8 million to that on day 3 miraculously and they dropped it to 15 million. And didn‚Äôt show as conpleted but the flag is added to atom shop today.
---
There really are people who will still blindly support this game hmmm ü§î it's interesting cause if you ask someone to fix something, they are going to ask why, if you say it's broken, they will ask
---
"If it's broken, why are you still using it?"
---
Basically meaning, you're sending Bethesda the wrong message. If you blindly support the game that's like telling Bethesda they are doing a good job, keep it up! We like the way things are.
---
Which is not true.
---
I like the idea of reduced fast travel costs as it would actually make people explore but once you have loads of caps you dont care about fast travel costs. (or at least I dont). I think more carry weight would be more useful to both low level and high level characters where as reduced fast travel costs I think suit lower levels more because of previously stated point.
---
I just want some more non atom shop camp items :/. I love the raider/junk theme but it's all so expensive.
---
Works well so far. I don't know why your saying that when it's literally what I have been doing.
---
And cork. Which is harder to get that concrete we got 65 million plus in a day üòÇüòÇ I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre failing any of them
---
I think they‚Äôve said this is coming. Like it‚Äôs some big, impressive feature rather than a QOL adjustment everyone expected long before now.
---
But then someone is gonna demand vapes and we'll have a bunch of hipsters running around.
---
This is the right way to get rid of them! lol
---
 ...i vape
---
Hm for me and most of the People ''Ounce of Prevention'' is currently broken. The Original Quest asks for 3 Blood samples and A T fuse replacement if I'm not mistaken. The Current Quest only ask for a Feral Ghoul Blood sample and A T fuse after u replaced the Fuse with the new one and with the Blood sample it still says there is no Blood there to ''check'' it
---
It‚Äôs every 15 minutes. I want to do other stuff!
---
Saying you spend 100 a year and then saying Bethesda needs a kick in the ass is an oxymoron. Are you gonna kick them with money? ü§£
---
Yes I was already lvl 20 and had the Quest ''Ounce of Prevention'' before the Overseer gave it to me. I started after the Patch of the 4th August.
---
Search on YouTube for bobble head runs, there‚Äôs loads of spawns all over the map
---
I have 3 Unyielding (all 1star), 1 Bolstering (3star with fall damage) and a normal unyielding because I still haven't bought the final leg piece
---
I have a sent ap vanguards chest I‚Äôll never use and I can‚Äôt bring myself to scrip it
---
I like pairing the outfit with Inspectors top hat.
---
groovy.
---
ba dum tss
---
Found one at the second place I looked on a public server.
---
The headquarters all went to work from home in March.  In May, they sent out a thank you image.  No hazard pay, no temporary pay increase, no additional paid leave, just a thank you collage from these tone deaf assholes who are still working from home while we have to open our offices to the public even though Virginia's numbers are rising.
---
The members were not updated for two days for concrete. That 12 million was after 3 days FYI.
---
They touched laser guns once, it had an unintended interaction with a perk card, and it‚Äôs like they‚Äôve been terrified to try again ever since. On anything. Oh yeah, anti-armor now works on them, sort of. That‚Äôs the best we got. I honestly think they‚Äôre afraid of creating yet more bugs that they very obviously don‚Äôt have the time/resources to properly fix. So when it comes to weapon balance, all we get is convenient deafness from the devs.
---
By kick I mean raise hell when they fuck up.
---
I'm only level 42, but the fact that I keep coming back and enjoying this game even with the immense amount of bugs speaks volumes to how fun it is.
---
It's really gotten its hooks in me this time around.
---
Just like everyone that got down voted for saying. Lmao!
---
Me too! IM STAYING AND THERES NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO ABOU..
---
Oh I did it before the patch then, I‚Äôm about 3 weeks in on my new toon. How annoying. Can you not do any of the wastelanders quest where you go to her house and then the vault?
---
Why would any one wear it, it's pretty meh.
---
I'll be heading back in for the story here soon, so I'll keep an eye out.
---
I did the clown wendigo things once,  and got my kill, but now the event is constantly on my list, but no wendigos are at that location anymore.
---
Used for tagging enemies at distant thunder. you can complete it without firing a shot.
---
Thats what I did still took forever to find a place where a bobblehead had spawned
---
They are working on outfit and PA displays
---
Buffs yes, nerfs no. Why? Well Some people may spent all their caps they save up for a month to get their amazing weapon, and then, some random on reddit comes and says "hey that's too good, nerf it!!".
---
Hmm now I'm in doubt with everybody telling me this. I'm pretty much a hermit player so it never takes that much my attention, I'll have to check again next time.
---
Ooooo, is there any info online about this I can read into?
---
are you on xbox of playstation?
---
I saw it in an online video interview someone linked. Sorry I don‚Äôt have the link.
---
I liked the first 50 levels, after that the progression is simply too slow to enjoy it. But its end game content so I wont bitch about it.
---
No worries thanks my dude!
---
Casual players dont have to loggin everyday to reach 100, this is not for casuals... is for hardocre players.... but its "easy" for hardcore players.
---
Im just getting started, and it's a lot of fun. But the ammo grinding for my .50 is killing me.
---
New to 76, so please pardon the ignorance. I have the option to add wallpaper(s) to WALL and WALL-DOORWAY but not to SHUTTERS. Is this a new bug exclusive to 21? In your experience, how long does it take for an issue like this to be fixed?
---
The winds of change are blowing.
---
Yeah my bad apparently they fixed it because it was 'unintended'
---
Great tips and resource, thank you! :)
---
It could be that if you kill the first 3 waves in a short time(something challenging) a legendary boss enemy comes up. 1 star in the forest,3 stars in the bog and mire. 
---
It would indeed spice up workshops for everyone.  Legendary woukd still be an enemy on the map so taggable by anyone,no need for pvp(but still..)
---
Ash piles now drive my game into slide show mode, since last patch.
---
Oh damn, I found one on my usual run of the generals steakhouse straight away
---
Players hot lazy and afkd for fasnacht. They knew they would get a mask and a legendary and do didn‚Äôt have to worry about tagging the Sloth.
---
I would say yeah but then many of us would then just be running around with thousands of tokens a month or two later that we can never use.
---
I'm kind or just tired of the pointless walls when it comes to grinding, it's the reason why I don't fuck with MMO's, it's either rhe grind is too damn long and tedious, or theirs some kind of wall that limits how much you can grind a day/week/month.
---
Just the same loot pool as the sbq afaik, so rewards will be consistently meh.
---
Why Lieutenant Dan! You got magic guns!
---
This has been a problem since wastelanders It feels like, but when it comes to bugs like this it seems like it takes forever for them to get around to it. To be fair though, its cause they're working on more egregious bugs.
---
Yes, how did you think Insult bot finds you
---
Ash and goo piles happen way too often and they should tweak the effect so it happens only one tenth of time of what it is now.
---
If ash/goo pile is on top of meat pile, you can't loot the meat pile.
---
Interesting. 
---
Yeah as I became a buyer I appreciated lower prices so I started that way but it's a good bit of data you gave me...
---
Yeah don't care if it's whatever just want the caps to shop player's stores and fast travel lol. 
---
Cheers for the help. :)
---
It's more of a BoS RP thing.
---
Bingo bango bongo you refuse to go, you say?
---
üòÇ
---
I love this and with my quad handmade, not bloodied but really pumps out damage.
---
Interesting...time saver for sure lol.
---
Thanks.
---
They said two weeks after patch 21.
---
&gt;makes the events completely useless
---
You still get rewarded for completing the event.... but oh yeah sure "completely worthless" because you didn't get everything you wanted
---
me and my friend just got the game together and he told me that he's going for a melee-tank build so I think we will complement eachother a lot, idk about playing solo though, I might switch something out for more endurance, any tips?
---
I sound mad? You sir need to increase your social perception. ü§£
---
or use any recon scope...
---
also completing the event that way is missing out on a bunch of XP. and sometimes ledgendaries.
---
Jangles Stein?
---
Overwhelming upvotes because it's true for so many of us. I can't help cringe every time I read another, "Bethesda I would pay money for x!" post where x is a totally useless cosmetic item the player will get bored of in two days or when their Gamepass runs out.
---
can i have your stuff? ....oh wait , its not that kind of post
---
And please make it so they don‚Äôt instantly get destroyed by mobs, I‚Äôm all for them attacking walls/decorations and my other building bits but ffs everytime I TP home the wolves have killed all my tatos
---
New to 76, so please pardon the ignorance. I have the option to add wallpaper(s) to WALL and WALL-DOORWAY but not to SHUTTERS. Is this a new bug exclusive to 21? This seems like a menial fix. In your experience, how long does it take for an issue like this to be fixed?
---
Probably tues.
---
Janky ü§£ emotes are a dead giveaway to salt haha but mmmmkay lol
---
also doors for basements.
---
Agreed
---
Wasteland and Sentinel Worlds were two of the first computer games I ever bought.
---
&gt;Not getting a reward
---
You do get a reward for being in the event and completing the event.
---
Sucks about the camp budget but that means by some camps I've seen I either build like crap or you guys got some creative building designs or work arounds lol.
---
Yeah people using the follow emote to show where the legendary is are heroes
---
There are folk who RP as BOS
---
i dont RP myself i just like aligning with the faction kus they are pretty cool
---
A couple of foundation people are from there, mention it by name.
---
Me too, got quests to do and my post apocalyptic farm won't take care of itself. 
---
Also I don't get people who are like "There's nothing to do after I played all the main quests sidequests, events, min/maxed 3 characters and collected every single legendary this game sucks", it's the same energy of those steam reviews of people that say a game is repetitive but they played it for 1500 hours.
---
I still want to know why my character randomly grunts, I get blood splatters on screen and health point hits when he's at full health with no diseases...
---
There's a lot more new locations and rebranded locations.
---
I'm not allowed to use emotes to express how I feel? Interesting ü§î you sound like you're projecting something. Why would I care if you play the game or not?
---
Nothing awesome but I got like a bloodied 2 star grognak axe if you‚Äôre on PC
---
So just like a few new or a bunch new?
---
I saw a bug earlier. Thats it. I'm cancelling my pre-order and telling everybody all about it.
---
You got downvoted but not because what you say isn't true.
---
Why waste your time commenting if you don't care? Lol. 
---
I'm not mad! I'm so not mad I have to tell you how not mad I am! 
---
Ok lol. I'm moving on now. Take care bud.
---
This is why i'd love to see the creativity that would go into it if functioning Welcome Mats were added. But tbh I think the reason is less about trap bases and more-so about you loading into an area before the camp itself is loaded. Anything beyond basic skins and cosmetics kinda falls in the "too hard" category for FO76 devs, unfortunately.
---
I always find one in the crocodiles mouth in the water park. Beware of the traps.
---
Bugfixes.
---
I can't answer comments either? You're not the comment police bro. ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Didn't they say that's where Lucky Lou was exposed, too?
---
I don't remember.  But it is brought up a lot in Wastelanders content.
---
I can think of 5 off the top of my head but I know there were more. A number of places now have instanced interiors so basically are new locations. And then a lot of places have been taken over by cultists and blood eagles and changed a bit.
---
Red rocket mega stop usually has atleast one in each machine and sometimes a machine filled with quantum but like Shufgar said tyler county fairgrounds has a hidden stash of nuka cola and nuka cherry in the middle of the park next to a podium, other than that check Fraternity Row and the nuka cola plant, the plant has a lot of quantum and nuka cola in general but it‚Äôs never all stashed together each bottle is in a different hiding spot.
---
Todd says, "Thanks Mum! x"
---
I got it for 9k a few weeks ago
---
A legendary I killed last night  during an event didn't have anything on it. And it didn't count as "kill a legendary enemy.," either. And I was the only one doing the event, so...
---
I was doing Vault 79 and had the 3-Star Sentry Bot poof out of existence as soon as I approached it.
---
We would, definitely!  And I'd much prefer having 1000 weightless tokens in my currency tab than endlessly manage dozens of total shit items in my inventory every day.  I never said it was ideal, but it's a system that Bethesda might actually consider.
---
This only happens to me when the body becomes a pile of goo or ash etc for some reason after the animation of the body disappearing nothing is left no goo pile or anything
---
It is slow, but it does at least seem doable.
---
I've got to level 52 and all but given up. I'll put some effort in on the double weekends, but other than that I'm done with it.
---
Of course !!
---
[there is a pretty good list here. more than I could remember off the top of my head haha](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders)
---
did you play division 2? the game is not that impressive but the map is a 1;1 scale of downtown washington. that‚Äôs very cool!
---
I‚Äôve hit that wall too, I log on now just to do the 3 treasury notes dailies and if any event is on then I might do that.
---

Here is a helpful spreadsheet that shows how much of each material to keep on hand in most cases to keep your stash under control.  Works most of the time as long as you aren't doing a lot of crafting.
---
Also if you didn't know already, the stash limit was originally 400!!
---
Yes so much!
---
Do you know the groknaks throne with that awesome Animation ? How about a nice chair with an Animation to pull out a cigar and smoke it ? Mmhh that be nice
---
Yeah feel free to visit my camp, molerats love eating all my crops haha
---
Same I finished Monday I havent even been back on
---
I need this.
---
The think the intention is to get enough Reddit traffic for the devs to listen and they won't have to leave. They're hoping for that one post from the dev saying "We heard you, we're fixing it!" ... It will never happen. 
---
If you're enjoying the game in its current state, good on ya!  I came back for Wastelanders, and really enjoyed the 2 weeks' worth of content. But I found the game very stale after that and kept getting frustrated with my thoughts of what the game could have been. 
---
Enjoy the game!
---
If it has some fruit, I will cook some irl squirrel stew.   
---
.
---
.  
---
(nope...kidding, pork, or chicken, not until everyone get nuked, then, it will be actual squirrel)
---
Buy it if you can get a deal on it. Probably not worth it at full price owing to the bugs!
---
Gg You got me there
---
Will try there when my current dies   .. thanks
---
Now you get to play the game rather than silly challenges
---
IRL 18000 graphic card....only available irl

The NCR was founded in 2186.

Yup! Always been a thing

Well, the thought was that the funds would have to be the same.

I launched my first nuke today thanks to Nukacrypt.

Hello, are you on PC? if so can you craft it for me, happy to pay. Fallout username: baumgi
---
Thank you
---
Oh, ok! Cool to know
---
If you're on PS4 I have a bunch in my stash. All different kinds. Just don't have bloodied or junkies. All have SS too
---
On xbox sorry. If you go to the market sub I'm sure you can find someone to do it for you
---
That must have been my camp.
---
nah, i dont like 3rd person shooters that much.
---
Anyone here able to craft me the Ultracite Emergency Protocols mod? Happy to pay.
---
I'm on PC, account name: baumgi
---
Haha
---
Of my camps, 2 get some serious hostile attention. I've got a pet at one and its lasted a day so far. Hostile there are regular minor spawns... ghouls, wolves, mutant hounds ...  plus occasional scorchbeast or high level deathclaw.
---
The other is on an assault spawn so it gets 2 or 4 groups constantly.  I suspect nothing will live there long.
---
True. Just had it today with two workshops, that I had to run across the whole place and search for the enemies. Inside the buildings and outside. And often those yellow markers don't show up if you are not right next to them. So you often don't have a direction where to look either...
---
&gt;squirrel stew
---
wait...I search on internet, it is exotic meat like rabbit, that normal in some area ! ? !  
---
There are recipe and vid on Youtube as well.
---
...it not normal where I live, they are too cute.
---
Once the event has started the moo moos will walk them selves it just takes longer, so you can set your self up to get  a shot in at least
---
What is the price?
---
Price is how much a buyer might be willing to spend.
---
If you have an item and put it into vendor, the amount of buyers looking for that item that you'll encounter will be probably fairly low compared to exposure you would have if you actively looked for people with given demands.
---
FED prices were not optimised for regular vendoring operations. Instead, they were organized based on how much one could extract from a dedicated buyer looking for given item - with auctions and biddings taking precedence over passive sales. Reading the feedback, I see a need for stating that better, maybe displaying separate "vendor prices" (literally at most 50% of what you can get if you put effort into sales) for items under 30k?
---
We built the tool hoping to serve as guidance on what goes well with what, so people would learn these intricacies themselves. We kinda grew into a role of price arbiter, which we don't really want. Upcoming changes to website will change the way it operates and allow users store their own pricing feedback, which will be then processed into a "community price". The logic to do that is finished, I'm currently working on securing it so it couldn't be used to troll our users. The logic for separate console prices is finished too, but we're only knowledgeable about PC markets and we'll need help with consoles calibration before we'll release that publicly. It's online already tho if you access it properly, if anyone wants to help calibrating the console edition contact me.
---
I agree.
---
a bit, but it is fun.
---
Step 1) Map76.com / step 2) search 'bobble' / step 3) hop around those locations.
---
Or search fallout 76 bobblehead on youtube. That shows the exact shelves or whatever.
---
Iv had a two shot 25% fire rate for the longest time I gotta try it out more
---
I would say about 25 new locations.
---
thanks
---
Oh they know exactly what they're doing.
---
It took me at least 80 modules, maybe up to 100 modules to get a full set of unyielding SS armor. Only one leg is a 2 star and the rest of the set is 3 star.
---
that makes sense, I still do think he should give them a try if he can bear the graphics as the storys that are told are great
---
Ski sword users sound off !!!!
---
Gt aussiex01
---
Definitely fun every once in a while
---
I might have one, let me check
---
Eork from home offers more opportunities to play!
---
I do Wolf pack daily. Easy kills and easy xp.
---
I think I have an instigating faster swing speed damaged resistance during power attack you can have on PC.
---
I did finish fallout 4 with all possible routes, I really liked the game, always went back to it when I didn't have anything to do. I find your FO2 story amusing and I can relate to that on a spiritual level from the time back when I was a dumb teen
---
Only lag I get is when I‚Äôm next to Tesla users.
---
Yeah I thought it may've been something like that, I have a level 20 something sword which I am not specced to for tagging, I have yet to forget to switch but I can definitely see how it can happen in the rush
---
I‚Äôve got one and you can have it free of charge. Not gonna be in my vendor. GnarKole is GT
---
Tomato with roast pork shoulder stew man I‚Äôd kill for some!
---
The game has drastically improved since wastelanders. In some ways it feels more of a fallout game than fallout 4.
---
[https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/events)
---
I feel you. I've finished race at Tuesday and since then I logged few times to scrip daily and buy more bullion I don't really need anymore... Yeah, I'll probably make myself a break until they'll unlock Collossal Problem.
---
Says you‚Äôre offline man
---
That sounds better than most people.
---
Some events are like the campfire tales, while you are following the quest targets, the other will just enjoy their new chance to get the legendary
---
Yeah, some people will just wait for the over to over while the others doing it for them, but if they are people like that they can easily tag the legendary any moments anyway, since, they have a lot of times to not literally nothing right, can't say the currently system protected anything from those guys, in fact might be opposite
---
are you using chill. it will dump your settings if it thinks you have gone to idle. as I found out with my rx570 8gb which dropped to 300mhz at idle and sometimes during normal play. wired thing with mine is I cranked the graphics and now get better fps and less stutter and still don't break 55 degrees.
---
I‚Äôm on now sorry
---
My only suggestion is drop fireproof for radical for the plus 5 strength
---
I want to finish the Wastelanders stuff but my game is bugged. I can't get past where I fall in the water, in the cave. Weasel won't do anything. I can't progress at all.
---
That's been happening since way before the last update.
---
I believe that's around the level I launched my first nuke.  It's definitely very satisfying to launch them.  I haven't farmed it like others but I've probably launched 5-6 so far.
---
I don't grind very hard anymore but it's a good satisfying 30-60 minute playtime nowadays for me.
---
It has been like that with sentry bots for a while, not just since the latest patch. Your best bet is to loot them **before** they explode, because the explosion sometimes makes them clip under the map. So, loot and JUMP. ;-)
---
Just googled and found your answer. That's what I did. Thank you sir!
---
Sweet joining now üëçüèª you sure you don‚Äôt want any caps?
---
k
---
Really kind :) thx
---
The glitches make me laugh! The bugs make me chuckle!
---
A simple question: Why can‚Äôt I apply the wallpaper I purchased in the Atom Shop to the Shutters I built in the camp workshop? Is not having this basic functionality an early indication for more fundamental flaws I‚Äôve yet to discover?
---
Nah man, it‚Äôs cool
---
Are you getting it because of the solo public team benefits?
---
Yeah man
---
Do you want empath as well
---
Personally out of all of them nw was sooooo cool i loved that game still do but 76 even lore wise pre wastelnaders lore I liked it more than any other fallout
---
Someone get this person a beer
---
If you don‚Äôt mind that‚Äôs be awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Honestly, I‚Äôm certain due to engine limitations, fallout 76 can never be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù, this game will always have severe bug issues for the rest of its life span due to the 20 year old creation engine. This isn‚Äôt saying people can‚Äôt enjoy the game, but I just don‚Äôt expect the game will ever reach a stable state
---
Reading this made my brain bleed.
---
Yeah, don't understand that either - dull, crappy rewards, my least favorite seasonal event. I'll probably play few times to get that new beer stain plan but that's it.
---
Let me get this straight. You have 5 characters and have maxed out your reputation for every faction. 
---
So you‚Äôve basically played the game 5 times, and grinded out each faction multiple times. All of this in less than 2 years and you‚Äôre complaining that the game has ‚Äúno motivation for playing‚Äù. No dude, you‚Äôve just played the shit out of it and you‚Äôre bored now. Take a break, you‚Äôve literally beaten the game multiple times. Come back when fresh content come out
---
Of course it did, you struggled so hard to come up with anything so you hemorrhaged. Good try though.
---
It's been in the Atom Store for a few days now. I've worn it against my will when I did my NW daily after claiming it. Auto-favouriting for NW has to stop, lol.
---
But then i'd have to carry a gun with a recon scope. Some people cannot be bothered with the hassle. Even though shooting them takes less than a minute. 
---
Buttttt i have never seen a single legendary at distant thunder. It's nearly always level 23 scorched and every now and then they're level 68.
---
Someone sid a similar post awhile back, the mods took down the post and bannwd that persons account from posting in this sub reddit. These mods here are wishie washie
---
Thanks very much dude! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

It was fine and sitting there after exploding and then just popped out of existence.
---
It didn't do the thing where they launch themselves in a random direction, even if that means underground.
---
If that's what you meant, then oh.  I haven't seen it until this last patch, and a Legendary Ghoul also did it so I thought it was relevant?
---
Go to any SBQ event  and you'll get some flux as a reward. Other than that you can try and hit any vendor up on the map that has junk for sale, or, try one of the trading subs, flux is a pretty regularly traded and asked for item.
---
This gun Is pretty fun üî•
---
They could use the ramp style ones from in the world...slanted ladder that basically counts as a ramp allowing you to go up and down.
---
You can buy it from vendors for around 250 caps a piece, or go into nuke zones to farm the 1 hardened mass, 1 radiation fluid, and 10 of the specific type of raw flux to make one stable flux

it just started for me, though, so it feels like it's patch related.
---
Lol, me neither at lvl 223. I might have to soon... people stopped nuking Whitesprings for me and I am running out of stable flux.  Have to find a good site...
---
Some clownshoes try and sell it for like 450 caps in game. That's easily double (almost triple) what it goes for.
---
Gotta go to nuke zones and pick up unstable flux from irradiated plants. Then you need to stabilize it using some materials off of enemies in those nuke zones.
---
Think it'd be pretty difficult for a level 36 to get the 1k damage needed for rewards on the SBQ
---
Does empath help you on teams? Thought you'd still be taking the extra damage?
---
I'd rather just visit super mutant camps. All the pipe weapons you could ever need.
---
I don‚Äôt know exactly how to explain it but I read a post that did. The damage taken and damage reductions cancel each other out because you are your own teammate. You wind up on the winning end
---
I don‚Äôt remember the exact numbers
---
It seems he is drunk one too many already.
---
You will be served hopping a fuckton too.....good luck.
---
Gotcha. I'll have to grab one when I get a chance haha
---
Always glad to be of service!
---
Pretty sure the people who say it‚Äôs a ploy to expose duper‚Äôs are not 
---
&gt;	so quick to jump to Bethesda‚Äôs side
---
I just take breaks from the game and come back to it
---
It's happened to me as well. That's why those events I go to FO1st. Got tired of ppl one shot Legendary and showing up at last minute just to do that kill.
---
How is it a dumb point?  Score shouldn‚Äôt be tied to Nw, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. But the bushwookies are basically saying they‚Äôre ok with it and will just afk to get rewards.
---
And they are detrimental to the experience, if 40% of the lobby are hiding without wanting to fight then it means less action for everyone else.
---
I agree there needs to be more punk like hairstyles and much brighter fluorescent colors. This is always something I see when I imagine a post apocalyptic world. Many movies have also imagined this look and is prominently displayed in another Bethesda title...rage 2.
---
We need everything from your generic mohawk, liberty spikes. And Mohawk spikes.
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I think I have one more if you want it. I still have a hard time remembering to create a public team with myself right when I login. Definitely important to do that for the bonuses. LOL
---
They removed the requirement to get wolf or mole rat blood. 
---
That said, apparently the event is bugged.
---
todd howard thanks you for the free mon- i mean fallout 1st
---
Sorted me this comprehensive list cheers
---
Same. At the end of the day, in spite of everything, I‚Äôm still having fun. I don‚Äôt get to play as much as I used to but when I do, it‚Äôs a nice, familiar vacation from the real world.
---
I just did it a couple days ago with an alt and I only needed goul blood and it bugged out at the terminal but it worked when I jumped on a private server. I'm on PS4 too so I can get you on a private server if you don't have fo1st and wanna try it?
---
K
---
Go home Todd, I was talking to actual developers :x
---
You can solo meat week even if everyone is just messing around.
---
Turn up prepared with spare wood, and chally feed already cooked up.
---
When the event starts, immediately collect all challey greens. These are 1 time spawns, so make sure you collect them instead of someone who might not turn them in.
---
Then just run loops harvesting critters, picking up plates, putting out fires, clearing poop. When available put wood on the fire and feed chally.
---
To make things easier I would always announce at the start via mic "If you dont know what to do, play the drums or turn the spits"
---
I agree with you with the mutants but it should be 5 % for each mutation with no cap or similar to junkie's with 10 % for each addiction capped at 50 %.  I think junkie's should be 5% per addiction with no cap as well.  I saw a great idea from a different post discussing the same thing which was getting rid of nocturnal but rolling it into vampires, I think the person wanted to keep vampires as is but add the nocturnal buff to it at night. I also think the other prefixes like mutant slayer should be 50 % not 30 %.  IDK
---
I was just describing one way they might disappear. I've seen them evaporate like you reported as well, but it has been like that for a while. Even Horde event bosses regularly do disappear, I'm afraid (sometimes the bodies are teleported back to that enemy's spawn point, but not always). 
---
I don't like this engine behaviour to be clear, just like anyone else, but it didn't start with patch #21.
---
I am actually, and that would be great if you wouldn't mind! That's the first thing I do is join a team haha. I'd be over weight otherwise
---
no chance, this would mean less fallout 1st subscriptions and this is beth we are talking about
---
Ok my psn is KillerGurkha
---
I think there this no correlation between  subscription numbers and bugs. Bethesda is famous for having buggy games. Hell there are mods for Fallout 3 to fix bugs.
---
I also think this post is the stupidest thing I‚Äôve read all week, and I looked at responses to a Donald Trump tweet, so that says a lot.
---
Might be more code. Or subliminal.
---
Anyway I've got an urge to play Skyrim for some reason.
---
I can give you some, maybe 10 of each, if you want.
---
Likely fewer. What do you think my 1st subscription pays for? We quit paying them and they can't afford to pay what programmers they have.
---
There were also cleavers (throwing weapons) - rubbish but fun, along with plans to make them yourself. There was a firework mine (I only ever got 1).
---
Event Grahm you can indeed shop from, it gave scrip (from turning in prime cuts), and Grahm had lots of lines he doesnt use normally
---
This makes zero sense. Giving them less resources does not mean they will have the ability to fix more bugs, in fact we would see the opposite.
---
Wow really?? Assuming you've seen that I'm on xbox? I don't wanna get my hopes up haha
---
Yessss I love me some Dolly Sods!! Always legendary stuff. Also still kinda low level and didn't know the scorchbeasts ever landed... I've killed like 4 or 5 haha
---
Hoping for some new rewards, but that might be stretching it
---
Think that's the same as the one above in the other comment but thanks all the same. :)  
---
And 400? Good god that had to kinda suck a lot sooner...
---
I did it a long time ago and was simply so frustrated at so many things.    
---
I finally deleted my first char which was really messed up. I asked for help in leveling it alot to fix it and get good gear (not free) and no one offered to help. I'm sure most assumed I was being lazy but no one bothered to ask.    
---
Playing through the main quest twice now was good. I'm not going to repeat it again and I've done Wastelanders once. IMO, BGS should let you start a new character at 50 after you make a character hit 100 which I did a few days ago. After 100 you have the option of creating a level 1 or level 50 character. WoW did it with one expansion and the inclusion of Death Knights. That way we could experience a character who had a lot of abilities, and even low leveled colored gear. IMO that was a really smart choice. It's all data anyway.    
---
Having to go back through so much when most (not sorry) people are unwilling to help someone power level and alt. I've had more fun by myself. I wish I could find a decent pool of players I could group with consistently.    
---
I will say this sub is fairly good at giving info in that regard.
---
I‚Äôm rocking the Wooden Inlay Paint on my lever action.
---
Same here now at level 377, I just jump around the map looking for yellow blinking dots to participate in.  At this point I have bought just about everything, have maxed gold bullion and 300 script saved.  I drop six nukes a week, 3 back to back on Saturday and 3 on Sunday.  Bring on the BoS.
---
Ever considered that the people complaining that they won‚Äôt be able to finish aren‚Äôt the same as the ones that have done it already?
---
Hey man, I can't join you for some reason. Sent you a msg on xbox. GT Zachy Chan13
---
Doubt they will ever let us earn atoms after completing the run.  If after the initial 2 weeks I buy my way to the end the next 8 weeks I would be able to farm atoms again I'd have to do the math but it might be close to what I spent on completing the legendary event or even come out a bit ahead with what I could earn and what was included in the run.
---
I just came across this problem not more than five minutes ago! My issue was I would load in the sample to the centrifuge, but the terminal would not allow me to analyze.  I quit the game through the menu and loaded it back in. The T-fuse was in my inventory on spawn. I loaded in the sample to the centrifuge, and  I was able to run the sample. After, I noticed I still had the T-fuse in my inventory, and I put that back in place too.
---
I would love to know average consumer spend on this game post initial purchase.
---
They wanted to do that months ago, to give legendary rewards even if people don't manage to hit the legendary bosses. I think last I heard about it was around Christmas 2019. I haven't heard any updates on this topic though. It has been a long time, maybe it's not on their "priority list" right now.
---
Grade A dad joke right there.
---
Serendipity and blocker are two perks u want to max. With a rifle build I woukdnt worry so much about your crit meter filling so I‚Äôd take the points from grim reapers and four leaf. Also consider a lot youll be on world teams, or u should be, or teamed with yiur friend. So wasteland wanderer won‚Äôt do anything. Better off with strange in numbers and Inspirational
---
last night I did the queen run 2 times, she had no loot for me even though I pumped a crap ton of bullets into here.  I completed the event and the first time got no flux or repair kits but I was rewarded a wonderful 1\* trouble shooters armor piece. The second time I did get all the rewards and she had a wonderful 2\* trouble shooters armor piece on her and I got a freaking 1\* trouble shooters pipe pistol.  It gets worse... completed weapon case daily and got another trouble shooters armor piece...1\*.  needless to say I did not try my luck with mumbles last night.
---
Yes, that's how RNG works.
---
I think Challenges shouldn't be based on chance. The lego spawns get a pass because you have guaranteed spawns in specific places and events AND lego hunting is part of the core gameplay. Bobblehead hunting is barely playing game because you would just server hop until you get lucky enough to get to spawn one.
---
Then Cyberpunk in Oct.
---
Let me clarify. I didn't mean any reward, I meant the reward the player is in the event for. For example, the event rewards you get from Uranium Fever are most likely not what anyone is there for. It's the legendaries and those can be denied by the but-my-gun-one-shots-everything-what-do-you-want-me-to-do inconsiderates.
---
There are 2 spots in the toxic valley that do that everytime I fast travel near them. I use them almost daily. Unlimited power!
---
so by your logic more money means more testers and not more money for todd howard and cohorts?
---
Yeah i love Ace, especially his lines
---
sry what Wastelander quests? I can do some other Main Story Quests like ''Top of the World'' etc. The only quest that I cannot do atm is the one with the Overseer. Her quest says that I need to finish ''Ounce of Prevention'' first
---
Okay... now go running off into the Mojave screaming as you get mauled by rad scorpions.
---
Donate cork to get high score challenges weekend! Nah I‚Äôm kidding. I finished last night too.
---
will bethesda go out of business without your fallout 1st subscription?
---
is this an indie dev we're talking about here
---
Exploring should give agility so I could run longer. And partial reduction to fast travel costs. But never free. Max like 50% reduction.
---
Finding extra items in chests would be nicer. Something like these perks from Luck. More players=higher chance to find additional items in every chest
---
I am. Actually getting online for scripping right now.
---
GT: LawrenceAndHenr
---
I know. And when concrete was updated on Sunday it showed 4.2 million. On day 3. It‚Äôs was 12,8 and the target reduced to 15. Then when cork started Tuesday there was no total for concrete and the flag stayed as locked. The thing is. They‚Äôve already released the score weekend and half price sale as happening. And 68 million cork in a day?  Come on. We‚Äôre succeeding on every stage wether we do anything or not lol
---
racist man good
---
Vault tec small generators. Silent and stackable.
---
I'm personally getting burnt out by daily chores, as I have done for the past decade and more in other games with daily chores (daily chores shouldn't exist in games, no content should be available on a daily basis), and the toxicity of people complaining about Fallout 76, Bethesda and Todd does my head in - not that there aren't things to give feedback about, but the constant asinine hyperbole and baseless, gleeful vitriol makes me think I'm not even a member of the same species as some of these people - but I'll still keep playing, I'll still keep buying Atoms and creating cool camps with the help of those Atomic Shop cosmetics, and I'll still keep paying for 1st, because all of that still gives me way more enjoyment than what it's worth, unlike some games that cost 60 euros and give you 15 hours of non-repeatable non-moddable content.
---
And quite honestly, me knowing that if I give Bethesda my time and money, it makes some of these aforementioned people angry gives me enough enjoyment and joy to keep doing it.
---
So I'm staying as well. Hundreds of hours in now, thousands total in Bethesda games, more to come.
---
I have magic shot guns and love them.  Don't even need the perks!
---
If a game makes money they will be willing to put more moneys towards it. If a game makes no money they will cut funding for it
---
Nobody cares about this either
---
I came across a camp [that used cabinets](https://i.imgur.com/MaOM6WA.jpg). They look very stylish - stairs with storage capacity!
---
And the bouncing to blinking lights is definitely still satisfying.  There's a few dud events but most are at least enjoyable.  I'm almost done the game board (probably once I complete next week's weeklies) so I agree on bring on the BoS!
---
&gt; If a game makes money they will be willing to put more moneys towards it.
---
not necessarily
---
Dual wielding bloodied meat hooks! I‚Äôm in!
---
Ah shite, I'm working from home atm, but would love to set up a time!
---
Birddog Industries.    
---
Cheep cheep ruff ruff
---
Sure, just let me know. I‚Äôm pretty flexible.
---
Because 76 is basically made so we can play something while waiting for fo5, because that will take a while to drop.
---
I love the game, but it's pretty clear it was made with assets from fo4, maybe upgraded them a little bit, but that's it. Most of the beauty comes from lighting and shadow. That's why the game only looks super amazing in 4k.
---
Two shot are hilarious because of the tangents the grenades fly off at. Just point it in a rough direction but don't bother trying to aim. I also have a TS Fatman witha MIRV mod which is huge fun to use.
---
Yes necessarily. They have a whole portfolio of IP. There are better places to invest your resources than something that loses money.
---
My original Xbox 1 sounds like a fusion generator when the frame rates start to drop lol
---
How many times now have they bugged out a light placement. That should have made the list of test conditions by now.
---
I woke up this morning, and I wondered. I wondered about you specifically, if you would be happy in this exact scenario. My day has been made knowing you would, in fact, be happy. Thank you for this post, now I can rest easy knowing the answer to this question I asked myself to the point of insanity. Jk I don‚Äôt care what you want.
---
Hahaha, i've seen a few. and have it myself, don't know why.
---
What's a nukacrypt?
---
I can‚Äôt wait for the brotherhood to show up.... and then get nuked by an enclave supporter
---
Yeah cool will do! Thanks a lot!
---
I can only imagine. Loads of well known games have changed engine to fix gameplay issues that border the issues 76 has.
---
Seeing the overseer is the start of the Wastelanders quests, not the follow the overseers journey. I wasn‚Äôt sure if that‚Äôs what you was doing. You‚Äôre pretty stuffed if you can‚Äôt see the overseer as she leads you onto the main wastelanders story. Sorry I couldn‚Äôt be more help.
---
Do you think this is a free game?
---
That would be amazing, other than I'd have like 45 tasks that start with NW: and then whatever dailies are for today (other than the couple I didn't have time for).
---
&gt; But you would accept it while being totally aware that it was counterfeit?
---
Of course I wouldn't.
---
&gt; Since you are so against it, then you should alert bethesda that you are in possession of a weapon that has 500+ copies and insist the item is removed from your inventory as you wouldn't dare benefit from such a horrid act.
---
This is my whole point.  Why do you assume every single player has duped items?  To be clear - none of my weapons, or armor - has ever been bought from another player.
---
Your timeline is a bit off there. But yes Monday it was updated to 12.8 and the target was reduced to 15. We didn‚Äôt see the final numbers but if contributions contributed at the same packs we would be over 15. If you go to the event page now, you will see it says unlocked. They update that one manually. When it said locked there, they said on another Bethesda page that it was unlocked. They didn‚Äôt update the pages at the same time. 
---
And I am a little surprised by cork. Seems to be off by a decimal point.
---
I was playing nuclear winter, I‚Äôm about to go into adventure mode
---
&gt; See, I end up with a constant surplus of stimpacks,
---
That's the thing... I do now also (to the tune of 100ish a solid day of playing).  But... early in the game, I didn't.  So instead they became a resource to stockpile for certain activities.  I missed the pivot point at first, and they started over flowing my stash.
---
Glad I was able to add some laughter :)
---
I think it's a game I've sank 1.2k hours into. That's a lot of return on a 30 dollar purchase
---
Of course not. But where do you think they get the money to work on FO76? They're not a charity, if the game isn't making money they're not going to keep working on it out of the kindness of their heart. While Atom sales are nice 1st subscriptions are more reliable and give them a better idea of future earnings.
---
Oh from 12.8-15 I‚Äôm not doubting. From 4.2 in two days at the target still being 150 million to add another 8 million in a day is very suspicious
---
This is the way.
---
no, not using chill, have tried setting on and off and no change.
---
and yeah, I too get better performance when I use higher settings and resolutions.
---
That‚Äôs why I said your timeline is off. That 8 million was over two days. Not one.
---
I usually wait to lose the workshop and retake it with 1 wave and every enemy marked.
---
Depending on their set-up, and their aptitude with mods, there are ways to improve the look of FO3 and FO:NV.
---
There also the remake mods being done in FO4, with FO3 being the closest to completion. While the overall project may still take a year(s) to complete I believe they'll have a standalone download available for the "Point Lookout" DLC available by the close of 2020.
---
Website the lists the nuke launch codes for the week. Super helpful site.
---
Having it revert to atoms for the dailies would work.
---
I am level 91, and have most of the weeklies left to go, simply so I don't have nothing to do later.
---
I gotta say. If the only thing that made you play was doing this, yeah your going to be bored after. 
---
I just included the daily and weekly challenges as past of what I‚Äôm doing in game. 
---
Works out.
---
Barley runs...  maybe on ur toaster.
---
Especially pumpkins. They're barely useful, but they add so much flavor to the game.
---
I'm staying too.
---
There is no way anyone knows what‚Äôs coming next unless BES tells us.
---
I use their sight every time! Consistent and accurate!
---
Atom shop updates at the same time as the daily challenges. Noon eastern standard time.
---
Yup.  And people troll events with Tesla‚Äôs now.
---
Yeah the game is beautiful if you stand still lol
---
Why on Earth do you think they'd fix more bugs if less people had FO1st?
---
I
---
Bombs away
---
what are people crying about this time?
---
Do you have a screenshot? I've been contemplating that outfit
---
cuz it uses one core to do everything, if they just optimized it to be multi-threaded things would be a lot smoother
---
LOL!!
---
interesting, i wonder then how companies like epic survive because fortnite is free and require no subscription. I wonder.
---
because they wouldn't be getting free monthly money for doing nothing?
---
TBH, isometric gameplay was dated at the time of Fallout 1's development, with it in particular having some fairly outdated (for the time) mechanics.
---
The story was the only thing that saved the game, but even then it was a hard sell for many gamers.
---
If one must start on the classics they should go for Fallout 2 first, as it addressed many of the mechanical failings of the first game, though some say that 1 had the better story it is still a fun and engaging game.
---
I got lucky: SS Left leg Chameleon with junk reduced 20% and +1 PER, right leg Vanguard with guns reduced 20% and +1 AGI.
---
Me too. Like 76. Even with the bad it is a great game
---
Also, camera mode effects makes the screenshots prettier than the game actually is.
---
Happened to me last night on 1 out of 13 Encryptids we ran. I was walking up to the Sheepsquatch and it disappeared. Gone, nowhere to be found. I walked around with a camera for a bit, but never found it.
---
Thumbs up for high end dad joke.
---
How about prime receiver Plans for 10 caps each?
---
Microtransactions. Of which they sell a shit ton. Far more than Fallout. And it's been around longer.
---
Nice job!
---
You seem to have no understanding of how business works.
---
Yeah except that's not a reasonable line of logic to pursue. You'd likely see an end to regular updates without all the extra money going to them considering how much of a sh\*tshow FO76 has been.
---
Seen it two days ago
---
Thank you so much! Plan on making more themed builds and camps in the future
---
Add me, freenadd on ps4.
---
Lets clear out that side quest list.
---
Also check out the Legendary Run, in case you missed that too.
---
I haven't even bothered to pay attention to it and just play the game.
---
I'm almost 2/3 of the way through the board and I haven't even been trying. If I don't get everything on the board, I don't care. 
---
I find what ends up turning people off from games is when they focus too much on grinding and trying to get every single achievement, every item, every little tiny hidden thing in the game..... You burn yourself out. Whatever fun that used to be there in a game, ends up turning into a chore.
---
I mean, people can play and do whatever they want, you do you.... But I personally never bothered to grind anything or seek out every single achievement in a game.
---
It's all just filler that, while is a nice bonus of things here and there, but when you focus too much on it all, it leaves a taste of sh*t in the back of your mouth.
---
well considering it still is a shitshow and it's been out for nearly 2 years, perhaps the logic that more money means more bugfixes is even more outrageous? don't you think?
---
even with fo3 and nv are dated. It's just because of the models being low poly compared to newer games, and  i doubt anyone took the time to redo whole models
---
devs have been able to fix bugs since the dawn of time. without the need for monthly subscriptions. did you know this?
---
I want to see someone nuke Flatwoods, just for fun.
---
&gt; this sub went from at the start of the season screaming about how the entire thing was impossible to finish and designed to force people to endlessly grind and still ultimately be forced to buy ranks..
---
This was before Bethesda listened to people‚Äôs feedback and made the 9 dailies a **permanent thing**.
---
you mean atoms? :)
---
It is by far my favorite event. Can't tell you why but.... MMMEEEEEEEAATTT WEEEEEEEEKKK!!!
---
Flatwoods is actually my third favorite
---
Yup. What could be easier then this?   Lol.
---
Ah are u saying the 4.2 that was declared on Sunday was only saturdays total? And the 12
---
On Monday was Sunday and mondays?
---
I haven‚Äôt chosen this skin yet to use, but as I understand it the only fix for this is to use the standard skin, or either of the ones purchased with the Wastelanders expansion pack (raider or settler skin), and move your camp and rebuild.
---
Happy cake day!
---
I think you fail to follow the same line of thinking as most of the people here. No worries. You asked for opinions and clearly yours is of the minority.
---
That's all there is to it.
---
i know people with 3k hours into single player games like Skyrim.
---
What's your point exactly?
---
Two nights ago I goto heart of the swamp. A 3 star ghoul shows up on a wave I vats hit it plus the other guy did also. Spend ten minutes finding the body being it‚Äôs in water. I finally find it and no loot whatsoever. I know I hit it but no loot for me. Makes me mad being I always think to myself that one prob would‚Äôve been a god tier weapon lol
---
216 and neither have I. I've been down there once helping a teammate and that's it. I've got my build dialed in now so I think I'll give it a try soon.
---
Love me a good virtue signaling. I will give you my upvote, treat youself.
---
They absolutely do. Some marsupial wanker with a fizzy gun or a power-armored numpty with a constantly drawn mini-gun smashing every legendary with one shot while I spam the frowning emote at them. Bastards.
---
well obviously the majority of people on a reddit about a game is going to lean way more into the apologetic camp
---
That spending 30 dollars to get 1.2k hours of entertainment is a good deal? That's what a movie and snacks cost for maybe 2 hours. Just saying it's a good return on money spent
---
LOL, Funny how the map is all ready there with bunch of interesting places. That you would think were easy to implement. But let's see, they are either going to kill this mode or improve. I hear they are going to focus on something in regards with after all this BOS content coming.
---
I dunno made. You do sound like abit of a prick to be honest
---
I love my two shot auto grenade launcher^^ with the right perks it absolutly devestating against any group of enemys
---
I still don't have a clue how you should know the code for the nukes. My main quest would forever be incomplete without Nukacrypt.
---
I think that‚Äôs what I am saying? But pretty sure the 4.2 update was on Saturday (unless you are in AU then your days if the week are different than mine)
---
Universe brain thinking in this thread
---
Without seeing actual numbers from the companies I'd be willing to bet that Atom sales aren't that high. Definitely nowhere near as high as Fortnite microtransactions nor high enough to continually finance ongoing development on this game.
---
I already met the Overseer but to continue with her Main Story Quests I need to finish ''Ounce of Prevention''
---
Yeah but if you look at people who played minecraft 10k hours for 10 bucks makes fallout 76 look like a cash grab.
---
I had a good fun 20 hours of enjoyment on a game I didn't pay a dollar for, I wouldn't recommend anyone pay for it but it's definitely worth a play. The Wastelanders update really changed everything, but man oh man that gameplay loop gets dull after a bit. Hopefully I can find the drive to keep playing, maybe next update I'll give her another go.
---
Me too, at least 25 so we can finish the event.
---
Someone else has just posted the same problem and someone replied saying they completed it by doing it in private.
---
Does bug fixing fall under development?
---
Us too. It‚Äôs actually a big part of mine and fianc√©s relationship. If anything Bethesda based disappointment and frustration is our pre-marriage counseling.
---
well I have noone on PC that has Fallout 1st
---
This looks great mate! Keep it up!
---
And if you look at people who go out and buy a steak vs those who cook their own at home restaurants are a rip off.
---
What you're saying doesn't matter. It's a good deal either way. And you clear have no clue how businesses work
---
Make a post asking someone will let you go in their private. I‚Äôm ps4 so I can‚Äôt help but would of offered.
---
Of course it does. Why wouldn't it?
---
Oh, they did. Google the remake mods.
---
WOAH. I was playing New Vegas on Ps3 a few months back it didnt look to bad. Wanna talk about polygons, Laura Croft from tomb raider ps1 release. ..first console was a SNES, these damn kids today are blessed with their damn 4k gaming...on a more serious note, yesterday was the first time in my life my hands hurt from holding a controller, I'm not even 30 yet, I'm scared.
---
Rhe flux reward is an event reward. You Don't need the 1k dmg for that, no?
---
This world (world) is coming like a ghost world
---
All the clubs have been closed down
---
Bands won't play no more
---
Too much fighting in the waste land
---
okay gonna do that thank you :)
---
So, if it's so obvious why did you feel the need to make the post in the first place?
---
Since, you know, you knew the outcome already?
---
I started playing at launch, but got bored fairly fast. Started playing again since Wastelanders and it's honestly a lot more fun and dynamic!
---
It doesn't feel very "multiplayer" to me though. I get why they decided against text chat, because voice chat is a lot more immersive, but barely anyone ever does. Wish we could probably communicate, because now everyone pretty much ignores eachother.
---
I wish we could activate a horde mode. Like the machine in line in the sand. Build it in you camp, build your fort, tower defence, bunker and activate the beacon. Or build it at a workshop, make our own public event, build up the workshop fortress with friends or randoms, activate the beacon and see how long you can survive.
---
It's an event where you log in o'clock and server hop after you end it to check if you catch another event ending and then you wait another hour to log in again and loop. Like Fascfuhsjhsjhdnatch.
---
3 so far. Yesterday I made 50 legs, all scrip.
---
I may agree if I ever got to play it. It's been ages since it was voted to play on. Was hesitant to even include it in the list to be honest.
---
It‚Äôs supposed to be material for rebuilding Atlas. I guess Atlas will have some really nice cork floors...
---
Good luck üòâ
---
I want to say when I've joined the event late and only got a couple shots off, I dont think I got anything. Could be wrong thoigh
---
I sold mine for 250 not realizing I wouldn't find another pair on this character. If you're on Xbox I will buy them off you.
---
I can't imagine how many fewer nukes would be dropped without them.
---
Techstep and neurofunk match the vibe well
---
You can also eat grass like Chally :D
---
Oddly I haven't crashed to desktop since wastelanders update. It used to kick me regularly.
---
Ah I see. I saw it Sunday evening in the uk. Obviously didn‚Äôt update it From Saturday.
---
I‚Äôd rather have everyone AFK and still get rewarded while I do the event rather than everyone do the event and only 1 person get the 3 legendaries that everyone participates for.
---
I got Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 both used for a grand total of 10 dollars, I think that will cover atleast a thousand hours of entertainment. Shit cost me 5 times less then going to see a movie, bout the same with my subscription fees for streaming. Go back and finish that main questlinr man.
---
so you're saying that you want them to work for nothing. 1st isn't "free money" for them, it funds their paychecks so they have the ability to keep working on the game. same as purchased atoms. how would you feel if someone came to your job and said "so the company isnt making any money, we decided to stop paying you in hopes you do better." no, fuck that, you're gonna quit that job and get a different job so you can get paid and pay your bills.
---
Ok you should've said that from the get go
---
because you do get rewarded for doing UF.. lets try to say we don't

The atmosphere of FO3 still holds up phenomenally well tho, the biggest problem will probably be the computer crashing
---
Swoosh swoosh
---
"since the dawn of time"? really? i didnt know donky kong arcade machines put out new content on a constant basis and were connected to the internet to allow instant patching and updates.
---
how old ARE you?
---
Do you use two handed or unarmed
---
took me 2 minutes to find. easy to complete, sucks you had a hard time
---
The 1k damage is require for the loot in the SBQ corpse for sure. I get stable flux as part of the quest reward (you can see the screen listing the rewards).
---
Be sure not to die before depositing the flux after SBQ dies or you'll lose the flux (disappears completely as if you never had it)
---
found a ski sword plan earlier, right after I hopped from my newly created melee to my main to make her level 15 raider power armor. I'm elated.
---
So you use no perks to buff heavy weapon damage
---
Me, $0.00. But a lot of hours. I only buy with atoms I earned from achievements and the old daily and weekly quests.
---
actually my comment was just to point out that their map is scaled 1:1 :)
---
Corner stairs, to make taller, tighter builds
---
Grahms portion is lightweight/low stress, entertaining, and has some unique rewards.  Runs on the hour.  Hopefully, it is like last time and in the same location (outside vault 76, so it cannot be nuked).
---
The prime cuts portion is random locations around the map, and is (arguably) more entertaining for high level players that can FT, as you will be hunting high level critters.
---
Yeah that last part is too true. I try to people but they always ignore me lol. Public teams also mostly do their own thing wich is not that bad since you still get the buffs for being in one.
---
I played the beta for a day but was really dissapointed.
---
Then after wastelanders I gave it one more try and I'm here to stay.
---
As much grilled ragstag as I eat this would be a freaking dream come true.
---
I will run a build like this. Besides Nerd Rage, what other perks do you use?
---
Lol "I just got a legendary 2* vape purple smoke and smoke circles" vape mods.
---
I'm not going to be walking through Hitesprings for a LONG while
---
Can you tell me these spots good sir
---
Hand stretches, and glucosamine supplements. Im in my 40s ;)
---
what a drag...
---
Good to see theres hope XD. Maybe the end isnt as close as I thought.
---
I upvoted you for some karma ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
LOL, I appreciate it. When I posted +karma, I thought I was in the market sub and was giving trade karma. LOL
---
I think it would be awesome to have NW inside a vault. Or a larger indoor map somewhere.
---
Don't forget if you can do the obstacle course south of overseers camp/wayward. Or have a jump pack to fly up there. Always one there just difficult to get to.
---
Didn't work first time, I will keep trying though.....it's so annoying üò°
---
I just cant get behind the brotherhood man...religious extremists who originated from war deserters, theyve always bothered me with the no one can have high tech stuff except us.
---
Try being out of a group. When getting to the computer, the first thing you do is analyse the sample, then you put the fuse back.
---
if that was the case I think they would make us turn in more sought after junk. who the hell duped 200 million cork, or 150 million concrete, the steel was the only mass duped junk so far, if they wanted duped junk out of inventories I think they would make us turn in aluminum and lead and things like that
---
To add insult to injury, they‚Äôre building Starfield on the same old crusty engine.
---
At least there are 8-9 challenges to choose from, so finding a bobblehead isn't mandatory to get the 5/5  bonus.
---
that aside, I server hopped several locations before I found one.
---
Fo76 uses the same engine that oblivion used, and fo3, fonv, fo4. And its the same engine that fo5 will use.
---
Bethesda has been using spit, rigging tape and prayers to keep this piece of shit engine running for 20 years now. There is a reason their name is quite literally synonymous with buggy game releases. They are too cheap to switch to a proper engine like unreal, unity, foxfire, etc. Because then they would have to pay licensing fees to someone else. Unfortunately, they lack the coding competency to write their own from scratch. They barely seem to know how to work with the one that they have now and they've been trying for literally two decades.
---
As to the OP, "the graphics engine" isnt something that one can just change out for something better. It is integrated into the core code of the game at every level. They can at best make minor tweaks of certain parameters.  They cant just wipe it and suddenly make it sleek, lean, and modern.  That requires either a full rewrite, which they cant and wont do, or the purchase of a new engine, and the migration of the entire game over to it, which is a monumental task and something that they cant, wont, and wouldnt be able to figure out anyways even if they wanted to. The reasons this games performance is so poorly optimized is because at its core, this engine was released in 1996 as a pure single player offline engine for first person RPGs.
---
One thing bethesda has always specialized in is bugs and glitches, just not fixing them.
---
From the legendary run
---
my best drop ever was off of a ghoul at the scary little Halloween store at the top of the map, a junkies explosive faster reload handmade when i was level 60
---
They could always add a minimum requirement depending on level of the player and other players.
---
Yesterday I was lv38 (just hit 40 today), and I went to uranium fever, I killed my share of ghouls, managed to get some damage into ONE of the legendary's that ran straight past me like I was a radroach on the wall to tackle the 5 level 300+ players (at least 2 had bloodied 50cals) that were the obvious threat.
---
I may not have got the damage on the other legendary's to receive the loot, but damn, I still shed some ammo and stim stimpacks to kill the wranglers that were attacking the uranium pumps (idk what they're called).
---
I feel like if theres 3 legendary's that appear, there should be 3 tiers of requirements to loot said bodys. At least that way us peasants can still get rewarded for our efforts accordingly.
---
I've been here for probably a week, already clocked over 80 hours, and started a second character + signed up for Fallout First. Yall are stuck with me.
---
Wade airport and Harper's ferry would be great spots.
---
Got the game a while back by a friend trying to get rid of it. I've been off and on the game but it's really fun
---
Loool ur a legend man
---
Emotes are a huge no no to reddit purist. Careful good sir, your karma will regret it.
---
Yeah, industry is massively changing compared to what it was back in the day
---
From what I gather this problem is user-made and happens when the game is installed on a drive different than the system drive. Beth has a help-stub where the solution is explained, and iirc someone here posted it also.
---
I have completed all the daily challenges except the battle royal ones from day 1 for the battle pass. I don't think its possible to get though it without paying or a extreme amount of grinding, so I'm trying to get as far as I can before its over.
---
I would be fine with my crops getting destroyed IF repairing them didn't require an instance of the crop. It's frustratingly annoying bullshit. Why do we want to plant crops in our CAMPs? Convenient access to plants we use to craft/cook, yes? But when my crops get destroyed, half the time they get all of a certain crop. So I can't repair it unless I go find that crop in the wild to pick. It completely negates the very reason I have a little farm. Yes, you can scrap the plant instead of repairing, which you can then replant, making it a free way to "repair", but the issue there is most of my crops took a long time to get planted perfectly to maximize efficient use of the space. I don't want to have to endlessly spin and finesse my corn or tato plants again and again to get them to fit where I need them to fit. I would gladly spend 10 fertilizer to repair a crop if it meant that was ALL I needed. Or make it fertilizer and a purified water to repair. Whatever, as long as I don't have to use the crop that's destroyed in the repair.
---
I've been a gamer for about 30 years now.   "I quit" posts are mostly just a cry for attention...hoping people beg you not to leave.  Or gamers looking for someone to validate their decision to quit.  
---
If you are tired of a game for whatever reason just uninstall and go.  No one will miss you and no one cares.  It's a game...not a personal relationship.
---
Let those fuckers know.
---
I just finished it and im honestly praying they see how much we hated it and NEVER DO IT AGAIN. They tried, they failed. Let them learn from there mistakes.
---
this is good advice. I know that emergency protocols for ultracite is pretty tough to come by whats it‚Äôs trade value
---
I did an event with an IRL friend yesterday, and only after me complaining I hadn't seen a legendary, he said he'd killed 2. Pretty sure your logic makes my friend a villain, and I've always wanted to best a villains ass lmao
---
Suppose I should have. The "reward" you get barely counts as one though. Anyway, I assume the point OP is trying to make is that every participant should get to loot the legendaries (or at least the "boss" one). Semantics aside, do you agree to that?
---
Totally agree. Especially when we see that some crops like silt beans and such have been cultivated. 
---
So why can‚Äôt we? We area smarts! They told Us we are in Vault School.
---
To those whi wants to leave :
---
This isnt an airport, no need to announce your d√©parture
---
VATS and respawn related ones being fixed could make me so happy i'd barely care about all minor bugs in game, - i died from something Todd can't even explain ? fine i don't care i can actually RESPAWN now.
---
I'd sure enjoy the point of view of a few modders about how this game engine can be tricky to work around ( or not ... ) those guys shall be hired for a few hours, we'd finally see changes by players for players.
---
Still loving the game after 1.8k hours thanks to my in game friends, idk how much time i'll accept VATS and respawn bugs but trying to stay strong.
---
When is meat week?
---
Yeah. NPC get to smoke! Why can‚Äôt we!
---
Me too! Literally within my first 3 matches, went 0 kills, 4 kills, Winner, me and team had killed more then half the players I wish I recorded it.
---
Id honestly have no idea how to even get the codes with nukakrypt....thanks dudes &lt;3
---
We're** Staying.

Here you go! reccomend subscribing to him, he halways has the best news on Fo76  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1KXzwFqDw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fo1KXzwFqDw)
---
As much as I like these suggestions I'm kinda scared of what would happen if they actually tried to implement them given their track record of fucking things up every time something is changed/updated.
---
Maybe when 32:9 becomes mainstream?
---
I just love these, it Bethesda‚Äôs fault posts. They brain washed me!
---
I ran into it the very first time I went to a nuke zone. I didn't go to another nuke zone for a bit as I thought that was the norm.
---
Problem is I was level 30 the first time and I  now 127 and only ever found it that one time. It was fun.
---
&gt;This game is awesome. It has it flaws but what game in this era doesn't?
---
You think that because you've only been playing since Wasterlanders
---
lol ......
---
LOL had one then other day where the enemy ran so far it told me I was leaving the event.
---
Bethesda doesn't know how to do that. They have all the money, but not the know-how...
---
How about people stop reading other people‚Äôs posts and representing it as new.
---
You got 100+ rewards for it in less than 100 days. Don‚Äôt be greedy.
---
I LOVE meat week! It's an annual event like Fasnacht. Just something different to do. Also my favorite people are there Grahm and Chally the moo moo.
---
Xbox?
---
I was waiting to see if it would work ü§£
---
Give your PC some radaway. Then radx diluted before you restart game. NOT RadX...it will drop your fps
---
Looks like we‚Äôre staying then
---
Nope!
---
u/Aeohil message me please I know a few spots that are generally 100% because there constantly spawned in by new players doing events who generally arnt looking for bobbles, one of the locations I've never seen in a single video. I got you.
---
ugh that sucks. i hope they fix this
---
That‚Äôs only to get the primal meat. The actual event is once an hour
---
Sure...but it's going to be a LOT less sold than currently. Especially rare plans.
---
If you think people complain a lot about quest rewards and things like holiday gifts or atlas provisions loot pools now, if it was account wide the problem would be even worse. 
---
I dunno, I just think most the point of starting an alt is getting that new character experience and if I was coming out of the vault with everything already unlocked it would be pretty boring tbh. Maybe that's just me though.
---
player.additem downloadmoreRAM 1000
---
I'm still making progress even though I'm mostly ignoring it now
---
I disagree with any form of level requirement to get legendary enemy loot, but I wholeheartedly agree that a good fix would be some kind of event participation check (where killing a certain number of enemies or doing event steps would qualify you). This would stop simply afking at the event for a free reward while encouraging active participation.
---
There would be none because the game wouldnt have lasted 6 months before the servers were shuttered.
---
All they need to do is introduce the short stairs they had in FO4 that clip to the quarter floor pieces and we could make our own. I dont understand why they never made them clip to the left or right rather than center anyway. Wastes so much space
---
I started to play it because of NW dailies. I enjoy it at times. It's fun. Especially if you group up with a fun group. I have a question can a new low level player level5 play NW?
---
I have a feeling you and me go to the same place...havent ever seen it mentioned, and every time I go it's there lmao
---
I have all of them if you still need them placed at your Camp! I'll be online later tonight.
---
I would like to see a timer added onto the Stalkers perk so you can see what multiplier you actually have
---
Is there life after launching your first nuke? It seems that all levels of players only do this from lvl90 and up.
---
I forget the ratio but you have to do a certain amount of damage to the sbq to get loot. Which sucks because I like to use my zealots cryolater on her so she flies in slow - mo, giving more people a chance to hit her, even the lower levels. But I rarely get any loot off her. Not that I need it but still
---
They do not care. Some will be like "Hey hey! You got the gold!"
---
Hey I showered yesterday
---
That's all I meant, i didn't mean you have to be a certain level to take part, but the lower your level the less is expected of you if you're in an event with people 300 levels higher than you lol
---
Watoga would be an awsome map for nw
---
I think a lot of old timers prefer Flatwoods, I still do.
---
The biggest complaints I've heard from newer players, is that it's unforgiving to people not running frog legs, and has much less loot than Morgantown. 
---
I like less loot, Morgantown has too many grenade launchers and terminals.
---
I ignored that entirely kus its pointless :)
---
There's a weird sense of entitlement among a vocal group of players on this subreddit that having PvP in FO76 is somehow sacrilegious because Fallout "has always been PvE." Terrible argument considering Fallout has always been single player, not to mention any argument based on the idea "well it's always been this way so changing it isn't allowed" is pretty much trash too.
---
I guess it just boils down to the classic "stop liking what I don't like." NW clearly isn't taking any focus away from development of the main game since it's still listed as being in beta over a year after release and other than some balance changes and adding the Morgantown map nothing has really been done there.
---
I'm level 444 and I only use my tesla on the mole miner legendaries. I tag em and move on to the next one.
---
I'm also always repairing the machines, which no one else ever does lol
---
If you want to see a game that switched engines mid way through, look at Anthem.
---
I never saw it anywhere honestly
---
Similar case for me. Finished the run 2 weeks ago. Only logged in on tuesdays to check atom shop update.
---
Always have mine at hand. With demolition expert it can blow anything in seconds with nice touch of flying bodyparts. Only problem is how fast it losses condition.
---
If all you need is a few to make your jetpack I can give you some
---
When you complete the Whiterun bunker questline to gain access to the nuke arsenals, you will be granted access to the bunkers command center. In the back room of this center is a workshop with the bunkers armory vendors, plans for the x-01 power armor etc. Scattered around this room are printouts, one for every type of flux, that will tell you what type of plants need to be nuked for that specific color of flux. Knowing what plants you need to nuke will allow you to intelligently choose where to drop your missile. It will also allow you to be able to look at the map and decide if a nuke zone is worth investigating for flux because you should know what type of plants are found in the area.
---
In the meantime, you can google it.
---
Oh man I love radiation rumble. I run ore always. It's nerve wracking and fun. I'm always glowing green lol
---
See I think frog legs should of been a mutation and not a perk.
---
I remember when frog legs used to not affect your AP.
---
ign scott723
---
Don't bash my marsupial mutation, I loooove it lol
---
What platform are you on? I 'm on PC, and I want to eventually get every event done at least once...
---
Thanks to one of the comments, I can't unsee the T-Posing ghoul, really gets me every time now! As for where they came from, all I know is I was walking down from Blackwater Mine when I noticed them bouncing up and down in the road. Thinking nothing of it as "Oh, Bethesda!" I proceeded to want to enter the Whitesprings station when I got sucked in, and then I guess I became one with the ghoul posse.
---
You get trap bases and you get trap bases. The first 1 I saw had an obvious trap in the open. So I set it off and moved out of the way, but that trap triggered another one and another one and so on. it was a Rube Goldberg machine, beautiful chaos unfolded in front of my eyes. You deserve my junk Sir and I'll fcking do it again. 
---
Then you get the guy that build blueprinted spike boards around you to trap you. Fck you, you lazy unoriginal ars.
---
I had this problem I had to use the medium preset then crank up texture quality to high or ultra but leave the sliders alone and I get anywhere from 70-100fps now in adventure mode, but for some reason nuclear winter runs like ass for me
---
I'd like them to remove the map voting. Just make it random, which map you load into.
---
Anywhere that you'll find 3\* enemies
---
Thatd be one hell of a list
---
Yeah I've been playing other games in the meantime waiting for broken steel. I really think some people get bad burn out because they only play this game. I still hope on and do a couple dailies every once in a while but it definitely isn't a job.
---
Thanks for saying this. Seems so many players who don't like NW or PvP in general seem to think the game should be tailored specifically to them. And you're right; NW gets pretty much no attention whatsoever.
---
Such as?
---
The only way to farm 3-stars with success is Purveyor. Any other legendary is a dice roll on number of stars and weapon vs armor. Cough up the Scrip and buy 3-star Armor from Mama Purveyor and hope RNG is in your favour.
---
I was about to unsub because I couldn‚Äôt handle all the hate posts being the only things on my feed. It was starting to feel like WoW forums.
---
I had a ton of atoms saved up that I didn‚Äôt plan on using anytime soon, so I just bought 23 levels putting me at spot 96/100. Let me tell you, I felt immediate relief mentally like I could play the game the way I wanted to again, not just to grind score or do dailies/weeklies... maybe I was just getting burnt out by the repetitiveness of the same events and the same challenges every week? Not sure but I definitely feel like the game is more enjoyable now.
---
Hey, I've sent you a friend request, thanks :)
---
S.T.A.Y.
---
whats your ign
---
Well that sucks, I've been running the Queen over and over as someone told me it's guaranteed there at 2*+ but that hasn't been the case. Thanks!
---
I don't think F76 is the best build to put a BR game onto. It just doesn't really work.
---
I think if they were desperate for a big PVP battle mode they could have done a more traditional faction based mode with objectives and respawns etc. But their attempt at a BR is pretty poorly thought out and implemented I think.
---
It truly boggles my mind that they let players do server hopping, it has to be a strain on the servers and just shows how the game has major design flaws.
---
I went through a 100 modules to get a 1 3star unyielding SS torso, with crap tertiary stats. 80 since then without another one.
---
63 modules for a 3star SS Uny left arm. 27 since with no luck.
---
38 for a 3star SS Uny left leg. Have another 40+ I'm probably going to try for better.
---
Me too. I'm appreciative of the ghillie stuff and the ufo.
---
anywhere you'll find max level enemies. you're better off trying to buy it
---
You're gaining SCORE even in PA, you're just not getting the pop up. I noticed this as well (my main is almost always in PA). If you look at your SCORE on the map screen or pull up the legendary run you can see your actual SCORE and that it will be ahead of whatever those pop-ups you get after exiting PA says.
---
It's a lot of ammo and time for 1 or 2 legendaries from her. Look up Sheepsquatch/Event Spawns in high level areas and circulate those. Also, I believe we've got a Purveyor Supersale on the horizon. Keep your Scrip hovering 900-1000 and DON'T CASH IN any Scrip rewards from the Legendary Run. That way you can spend your 1000, earn your 150, spend it, cash in your LR rewards, spend them. And hope you finally get some decent gear.
---
Interesting indeed. That does explain a lot. ü§î However, I feel that emotes are pretty ubiquitous by now. Trying to start an argument or immediately seeing someone as "mad" just because they put a simple emote is indicative of deeper personal issues. I hope that guy is ok ü§£ must be hard living like that.
---
I made a mule/melee character and went through it. The only difference I noticed is that I only had to kill one enemy and get one sample to  load in. It worked fine otherwise.
---
Some how this this feels like a shamwow pitch...
---
Never done PP every time  I look no one  is there and I don't want to go it alone. I have done RR starts with 4-5 but usually double that by the end.
---
I wouldn't count on it at all - 21:9 is not fully supported (it's not work as should, modders done better job in that manner than Bethesda).
---
The lounge singer in fo4 is Lynda Carter, a/k/a tvs' original **Wonder Woman**.
---
Thanks for the advice :)
---
Try 6.
---
Drink more
---
Have you tried having a bad childhood or breaking up with a significant other? I hear that helps.
---
It took me 3 tries with each leg (only have the leg plans ATM) to get what works for my build: Chameleon +1PER 20% junk weight reduction  and Vanguard +1AGI 20% weapon weight reduction. May Tzeentch continue to favour me...
---
Lol not just FO4, the Scorchbeasts are models ripped from the dragons in Skyrim. This whole game(although I love it) was just a way for Bethesda to appease Zenimax when they had nothing coming out that holiday season.
---
I'm a filthy Commie and I would never say that &gt;&lt;

You admitted to knowing the exact reason...

I always fine alternating between two drugs seems to work the best so something like pyscho, alcohol, psycho, alcholol.

Are there communists in the deep? I have the quest 'explore the deep' of the but have been ignoring it

Yeah, the culture on here can be pretty bizarre.

Yeah, because I haven't thought of that and asked on the marketplace üôÑ

I can see you'll be of little help. Ask for a place, get vague vs answers.

I just started about 3 weeks ago and am loving it so far and won't quit in the near future (not so much love for the stash limit but i'll somehow get used to it ;) )

Pick 2+ addictions you want, circulate between them: Booze&gt;Chem1&gt;Chem2&gt;Booze&gt;Chem1&gt;Chem2

And don't spam consume. Either use the favourites wheel or open your Pip-boy, consume, exit, open, repeat.

That also sucks!

I do the full bush wookie bit when I have to play and have had a surprising number of top 5 finishes. I really don't enjoy the mode but apparently I'm good at being a sneaky-b\*\*tard.
---
That's now how MMOs work and 76 has most of the core elements of one.    
---
MMOs are designed to be a time sink. A lot of time wasted for very small return. It'll never change.

your added fast travel to me
---
Did the exact same thing yesterday, I feel like a weight lifted off my shoulders lol
---
Theres a guaranteed drop off one of the rooftop guards in Monthman town (w/e its called.) It will drop at L20, but you can scrap it to learn the crafting recipe and make one your level.
---
Approach town the the north ideally, enter through the gate, stick west nearby the river, enter the town proper under the overpass. There ill be a workshop with a couple benched and a PA stand in it. Climb on top of this building and one of the guards will be shooting at you with the gatling. Take it from him. Scrap. Craft.

I'd like to see watoga. Sort of. It would suck to be sniped off by people with frog legs up in the towers...
---
OMG I love the Specials. I met Neville in Arizona when I was a bouncer at a bar they played in Flagstaff. Gooood times
---
Ok thx
---
I just wish the 2x1 allowed different floor skins.
---
You just described the Cassidy family weakness.
---
Psycho for the Dad, Alcohol for the daughter.
---
Have another round 
---
Or five
---
Its something to do in the game. No one says you have to complete it. Just do what you want.
---
I've been wondering too. I heard loads of positivity about fasnacht but it did not live up to the hype in the slightest. Kinda apprehensive that meat week will follow that trend.
---
Capitalist scum bootlicker
---
Not so easy to do quickly to catch that random shot.
---
I‚Äôm conflicted now about upvoting or being supportive of your opinion!
---
Just kidding. Some people like myself are not too bothered about the issues since the game has cost me nothing but my time, and so far I‚Äôve enjoyed it. I haven‚Äôt really spent much time in this community though so I can‚Äôt really comment there.
---
Yeah, running it on High, and at most places I get between 70-150 FPS, while some like these the GPU clocks down and gives me low FPS for some reason :S  
---
If you go to the same location where I am in the pictures, what FPS do you get?  
---
It's Watoga Highschool, on the roof of the right bus (think there are 4 buses parked in a row)
---
I'm there and I'm a Commie. Fight me
---
Cheers mate, hopefully it works ü§û
---
Public teams are sadly almost entirely useless. No one uses them to find a group to play with and instead just uses them for the bonus. And yeah they are really unbalanced. Full INT team + rank 3 inspirational + decent level INT + even a few pieces of UNY armor make leveling too easy
---
It's a marketing tactic like anything else.    
---
BGS not doing what you suggest picks at a person's patience and willingness to pay real money for something they'll never own. It's why the rewards regarding Seasons so far are so bland.
---
Heh, Encryptid's a cake walk for you with those...
---
Thanks :)
---
NW is a shit show at best it's a good thing it's fun.
---
Just tried today for the SCORE daily and it‚Äôs not tracking any of the bobble heads I pick up.
---
I've collected so many golf shirts because I jump servers to farm golf balls and legendary mobs at Whitespring.
---
I have been trying to get addicted to alcohol for 30 years, and even though I drink at least 12 beers every day, I just can't seem to do it.
---
You're welcome :)
---
I get like 2-3 a day from Ace. But I prep it and keep it as it does not spoil
---
230 bullets in your handmade
---
It work! Thank you so much, really appreciate it :)
---
Lots and lots of coasters for the new Hooters they plan on opening.
---
I am fairly new to playing online games, but it seems like all of them have people who complain about the same stuff: not enough content, gitches/bugs, or don't like an aspect of a story line. I understand these concerns, but if you feel that these issues are a problem it is likely more effective to complain to the company than on Reddit. 
---
I started playing about a month ago, just reached lvl 28 yesterday. Unfortunately, I am stuck on the analysing blood mission due to a bug, but am still having a great time wandering around Appalachia and finding other events to do while they fix the issue.
---
There isn't any place you can specifically farm 3* heavy combat armor. Your only options are to kill 3* legendary enemies and hope you get a 3* heavy combat armor and to buy 3* armor pieces from the Purveyor. 
---
The latter would be the better option considering you're at least guaranteeing 1) you get a 3* and 2) it's armor.
---
SERIOUSLY I WOULD DROP SO MANY ATOMS FOR NEW HAIRSTYLES AND GOOD TATTOOS AND PIERCINGS
---
Ever since Wastelanders released, the Settlers have done nothing but hit me up for supplies, steal my favorite CAMP spots and guilt trip me over not giving them all the gold. The raiders have cooked me dinner, shared comics with me and praised my adventures out in the Wasteland. As far as I'm concerned, the Settlers can kick rocks. Haha.
---
Why don't we start a you tube radio station like old world radio but with different songs? If I had technical support I volunteer to be the first dj https://youtu.be/iZZ-y_z6zLQ
---
you can't really. save your T-Bills/Bullion until you can afford secret service armor?
---
Feel free to do as you please, the point here is that you can't improve if you think everything is fine. So if people dismiss the on-going issues, how can we expect the game to ever become better?
---
yeah, I try to repair turrets for people if I notice they are down ...
---
point taken.  
---
I think I made 74 last night - at almost 3k score per level, the extra couple hundred score for each challenge does make a difference.
---
I'm fairly new to the whole bullion system. Do pieces of ss that I craft have legendary traits?
---
put a disclaimer in your post:
---
'Exaggerated for effect'
---
Viswt Flatwoods, there is a dead Brahmin that should have some. Or the dead brahmin in the shed at the workshop near the vault-tec farm near flatwords.
---
That sucks. Purveyor it is! Thanks
---
Care to explain why? You don't want more viable builds in this game?
---
If you are in power armor, exit you PA.  
---
Score will be credited as soon as you do so.
---
And ceilings.
---
Posting to say Go Bucs!
---
I would not add slugs at all. That's just trying to one up rifles. I'd much rather retool what exists so everything has its niche, so that people have a reason to use shotguns or pistols or rifles or heavy weapons depending on the circumstances.
---
No worries. Depending on the price discount you should be able buy a lot of armor during the sale. If you're getting good pieces that aren't good for you, look into joining a reputable trade sub and swap some pieces you're getting for pieces you want.
---
If your character is L80+ you can expect a guaranteed L91 glowing deathclaw to be present at the thunder mountain substation in cranberry. Theres usually a L70 ish one in Hopewell cave in Savage Divide. Again, if your char level is high enough.
---
No rep required just need to finish the vault 79 portion then you can use them at crater or foundation
---
Yeah it's really lame. I wish they'd at least implement the ability to use legendary modules to craft legendary versions of all weapons/armor, like how it currently works for bullion armor/weapons. Even if they were untradeable like the bullion stuff is, at least it'd give you the ability to pick exactly what weapon/armor piece you want to roll.
---
Jokes on whoever takes my junk I have at least 200 lbs of junk on me at all times
---
I would say steam isn't the best to look at for that though. The game launched much later on steam, so people who actually love FO would have already bought it some other way.  And the people who love FO want the game fixed more than they want more daily grinds to do...
---
...once you complete the Vault Raid you turn in Treasury Notes at all machines regardless of rep. It's basically like vending machine/workbench.
---
Lol @ the people who don't understand a joke
---
Also need 1 glowing mass to stabilize.
---
Most say it's 1000 damage but I have read 1500. 
---
Do what I do: use my main gun to ensure I get the minimum amount to count and then switch to the cryolator. Turning on the damage numbers display helps me estimate when I have done enough.
---
Those are terrible, IMO. Make the queen fights take twice as long as a regular run.
---
After the 4th August patch?
---
IMO this Challenge is worse than the daily Level Up
---
No mate, if you have finished wastelanders you can hand them in, rep doesn't matter.
---
Right.... but primal cuts is kinda key to the whole thing. How can you have a meat cook without any meat?
---
Even Ward is disappointed in them
---
HA. Okay. Am i supposed to know your reddit history? 
---
Like. I couldn't have been kept it any simpler. Find where high level enemies spawn. Look for 3* enemies. 
---
Want me to list every single location a high level enemy could spawn? Want me to come to your house and do it for you?
---
You don‚Äôt have to turn in any primal meat to complete it. There‚Äôs enough critters around to collect and turn in meat.
---
When did that pop up?    
---
I got the new Raider outfit, mask, and spiked walls but didn't see that.
---
Well gee, not sure why it didn't work last night.  Maybe  the old "exit / reload" will clear any glitchiness.   Thanks, we'll try again tonight!
---
Sad thing is, I didn't go hardcore.  I have had furlough and this is the main game I'm playing right now.  I did all the score challenges, except NW ones, and I was lucky enough to suffer no auto completes.  I didn't buy any levels with atoms either.  I started looking forward to Tuesday resets for the weekly challenges even.
---
I completely understand I'm not the normal case here.  I'm just thinking, if they are going to copy other looter shooters, might as well round the "season" out a bit more.  We can benefit from the polish other companies already applied.
---
I agree with you about the current implementation being amateurish.  It's like they tried to develop this from scratch instead if looking at their completion and going "where did they screw up so we can avoid that".  I say that because this is no different than what destiny 2 or division 2 are doing already.  Just like NW, the chase was late to the party and barely half baked...
---
I hate that this is exactly what I think almost anytime I read someone's cool idea for this game.
---
How much is enough though?
---
"It just works"
---
Honestly, whenever something in these games doesn't work like I feel it's supposed to I assume it's a bug and try later or reset.
---
(In Preston Voice)
---
I got word of a faction that needs our help. I‚Äôll mark them on your map.
---
1400 shared yes.
---
BUT when you BUY it will increase the pool if it is below 1400, to 1400 again. Not 1 for 1 but you will see it increase if you buy items.
---
so buy something you may need before selling.
---
That's why atoms doesn't have to be an option even.  Other end have currencies could be listed. Or, weekly caps on all the selections.  There are a lot of ways to skin this.
---
lol
---
I really wish they would release the harpers ferry map. It easily would make it to top 3 NW maps if they ever release it.
---
Junkies effects are bugged currently on high rate of fire weapons. Adding FFR on it increases frequency of bug damage. It won‚Äôt one shot normal enemies, but it‚Äôll two shot them. For SBQ fights, a 1 Star junkies gat laser will out dps any other 1 Star variation of gat laser. Check out angry turtle for info. However, I ran heavy builds before and I used a gat laser A TON. I would recommend using a .50 cal or Gatling gun. You can use vats much easier with the two and imo it‚Äôs worth it, makes the entire build run much smoother. If you‚Äôre on PC, I have a few bugged gat lasers you can try/have.
---
Pretty simple process really. But you'd have to actually have been interested in helping though, instead of just pulling my leg. Whatever though, I got real answers from people who weren't being bellends, so bye :)
---
Quick question about the fridge. Can other players steal from it?
---
I‚Äôm aware of how the event works
---
You're absolutely right. It's crazy how many posts around here are the same mindless praise about the game being 'surprisingly fun' or high level players helping out newbies. Serious discussion is often seen as 'criticism' and once people are critical, there's a nasty wave of toxicity coming from seemingly blind defenders.
---
Yes. It will always be legendary with a random number of stars and random effects.
---
its actually P2W item, that ultra big ass magazine u can buy from atom shop only for 999atoms, its rotating every 3weeks like all items, because theyre out of content
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I don't think the game should artificially push you along. If you're bored with the game, why not try something else?
---
They made the game , so yeah if the game is shit its there fault .
---
Everyone uses at least 5 mutations, there would be no reason to use junkies then. It should be slightly worse imo (maybe 10% per mutation up to 40% or something). 
---
Berserkers should do at least the same damage as bloodied, maybe not tonnes more though since you can use broken armor to still get legendary effects.
---
Nocturnal should imo do between 0% bonus to 300% bonus depending on the time, especially since they made nights shorter.
---
Mutant slayers, and the other similar ones should be 50%, so same as junkies but without the downside of having addictions.
---
Two shot is probably fine
---
Bloodied is probably fine if you buff the rest
---
Stalkers should have a complete rework or be removed like double was. Make it give the gun perfect vats accuracy on every shot or something. If its not increasing damage it needs to drastically improve the gun
---
Quad is fine, but a bit specific. Good on double barrels, gammas, and not much else that i can think of.
---
Vampires is good
---
Junkies is fine
---
Instigating is fine
---
Anti armor is probably fine
---
Assassins sucks, needs to become 50% and work on human npcs, like mutant slayers and the like.
---
Furious is fine
---
Thats just my opinion tho, but yea idk
---
I don‚Äôt know why a static spawn is. I just know I picked one up off a desk in Morgantown airport and got it. 
---
My bigger issue was I killed the legendary scorched at the end too quickly and didn‚Äôt get credit for killing a legendary enemy. Fortunately leader of the pack dropped right after.
---
Maybe Dorsey does know and he‚Äôs illiterate and they really wanted üåΩ
---
Ya im definitely going to get all the utility cards that you listed. In fact I started a purified water farm and got aquaboy so I didn't die constantly from being in water lol.
---
if only you could...its in a safe zone so you can't. Probably cuz we wouldnt want a low level player's experience ruined by getting the first town nuked and they don't have any protection against rads.
---
Does no one ask politely for things anymore?
---
Some of the bugs have been truly bizarre. Many day 1 bugs are still in the game. Bethesda's entire handling of Fallout 76 has been confusing.
---
Uyielding either needs to completely go to the trash bin or we need something else, like a vanguard-type set, that does the same shit.
---
Because right now it is addictive. I WANT to play with a stealth suit, but i'll lose so much luck/agility that I don't want to.
---
I think they messed up with that attribute. Removing it entirely or reshaping it would be better, drugs would be more effective (what is a +3 INT when I am at 36 already) and other builds would be more tempting.
---
yes, you must have legendary modules (from the purveyor) to craft.  the upside is you craft a given piece (say a left leg) so you know you will get a secret service left leg.  the legendary part is 1-3 stars and still just RNG, but it is better odds than anything else in the game.
---
in the meantime join a trading area and wait for someone to have what you want.  typically only unyielding armor sells for a crazy price and other primary effects are much more reasonable.
---
You sir, made a wonderful post. Cheapau, good work and i totally agree.
---
By quests do you mean the two or 3 main missions? Or finish the reps before doing raid?
---
No reason to miss out on a free legendary for the scrip machine or the tiny chance to get the rare ultracite plans.
---
It's not about deserving more.  It's obvious they have no idea what they're player base does for playing.  They have had to move manage challenges the entire time, and we're being shown the same thing with moving the goal posts for the Boss event.
---
This is more me trying to finish paving the road they created with stuff from the games they are already copying.  The chase created a lot of conversation, but they are losing that momentum.  This is the once where the full time players and streamers take a break.  Those are the people they need.  Gotta keep that engagement up.  This is just an option to do that.
---
I'm a fan of 7.
---
And it's not people's fault for allowing them to keep delivering "shit" updates? For ignoring all the issues? For pretending the game is in a great condition?
---
As am I. Good on you for opening up this conversation!
---
It's been bland for awhile now for me.    
---
I'm rank 88 and got that PA skin yesterday. If I can get to 92 I'll be done. That Raider gas mask looks pretty cool. A lot of the challenges are too time and junk consuming.
---
And in the same sense, do you expect others to care that you‚Äôre staying?
---
You mean you don't wanna play 20 in a row on Morgantown and everyone has memorized the map?!?   
---
/s
---
Since P21, i have been gettign considerable freezes on occasion when a zone tries to load. This is on an ssd mind. I have also been seeing a lot of DCs. The patch has been very aggravating.
---
&gt; Lots of people have been doomsaying and claiming that players would get lazy and afk, but I don't buy that excuse. I'd much rather have that than what we have now, which is infinitely more frustrating.
---
People already do this today just to get treasury notes.
---
Kellys monument sometimes has what I call a Stag Party. I go there and there's like soooo many stags just roamimg.
---
Lol you dumb
---
SBQ and the Encryptid event are really kind of it for "end game" minus bullion farming.  I haven't seen a Wendigo Colossus so I'm not even sure it actually exists at this rate:   [https://screenrant.com/fallout-76-defeat-wendigo-colossus/](https://screenrant.com/fallout-76-defeat-wendigo-colossus/)  reads like it's a real crap shoot to actually get one to spawn.
---
Otherwise, it's farming for gear, exploring, building, and finishing any outstanding story lines.  If you care about the season event, there's that and BoS is coming eventually so there's some carrots to dangle.
---
Those utility ones come in handy in earlier levels as well, IMO.  
---
I don't use Rad-X anymore and have a lot of Radaway. The swimming badge is much easier with that one.
---
Man, I'd have to go through and re-do the entire list then! Leaves more content for future list-based click-baity article's and yt vids though, so yeah
---
The main missions for each faction - you can do them all, just short of the Vault 79 raid.
---
You can't tame fixed spawns unless that has changed
---
Thanks for the help! :) Been farming for a UY Heavy Cokbat with the blocker effect and no luck, ss it is!
---
Now that I didn't know.
---
That was never the case. There was a bug that allowed people to make it before the event even went live. It was still level locked though.  And their fix to it was to 'disable it" so when you actually got the item, you'd see the crafting ability for it but unable to actually do it. Then they turned around said it was never intended to be crafted and took it away completely.
---
I‚Äôve never managed to reconcile the mentality of those who rush to defend an online multiplayer live service - which depends on a large enough player base to survive - by telling people if they don‚Äôt like it then don‚Äôt play it, whilst simultaneously maintaining the illusion of one the ‚Äòfriendliest‚Äô communities out there. Because telling people not to play a multiplayer game that needs players to survive is a great way to make it survive, right?
---
Me too! See ya in the game.
---
I only did the inoculation quest for the settlers and they say that still
---
&gt; I played this event yesterday and the day before and players all gun bashed it and used the Follow emote to get everyone to come over. Level 200s were there too!
---
I don';t play much on public servers, but I've found this happens more often then not.
---
It's been rare I don't get to tag 2 of the 3 legendaries in uranium fever.
---
(yes, of course you may miss one.  But heck - accidentally killing happens as well when you one shot stuff)
---
By replying me "lol you dumb" it shows your level of argumentation and intellect. It's okay, I understand.
---
Radroaches will do that man. They get me all the time. I go and open a door and a radroach just jumps out at you.
---
I'm not sure but I read somewhere from a fallout 4 modder that the sliders are set to an insane about by default and to just use the medium preset and then change texture quality and shadows to your liking ect but do not adjust the graphic sliders below them it seemed to help my fps drops in adventure mode a lot try it out and let me know, hope it helps
---
Yeah man, i know, it's not my first rodeo. Been playin meat week since it's first appearance.
---
That said, you can't deny that people don't want to learn how to enjoy the event to have a good time, even if i tell them. It's sad, or maybe it's lack of instructions, who knows. Bethesda too needs to make things clearer.
---
How is it pulling your leg?  
---
There is absolutely ZERO ways to farm a specific enemy for 3* heavy combat armour (with specific perks). None. Zero. Nada. Nil. 
---
You can either gamble with mumbles, buy from a player OR.. ORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.... or find high level 3* enemies and kill them and pray that RNGesus blesses you but the chances of you looting a 3* enemy and finding a specific item is ridiculously low. 
---
That's why i said you were better off buying it. And instead of you simply being a normal functioning human being and say 'yeah i have tried that but alas i was unlucky in my endeavours' you had to be a clownshoe and act like a gonk.
---
I hope RNGesus is looking the other way every time you loot an enemy.
---
fallout 1 and 2 generally cover most of the main story from the enclave / brotherhood / super mutants / death claws / I mean its a massive core of the lore
---
Barley? No on my xbox and it's not because of your rig it's because the game is basically a thrown together chaotic amalgamation of mods and untested shit on an outdated engine that has been fiddled with so many times that bethesda doesn't even know the ins and outs of how it works and was never designed for anything even remotely like this. Also shove whatever PC you're using straight up your butthole.
---
Can I not have your stuff?
---
All i care about is that they let me murder the piece of shit who camps at the Welch train station and cops an attitude when im using the workbench or the vendor. I dont give a fuck what his sad backstory may be. I want to nail him to a wall and peel him like an onion.
---
Right or wrong - I think a lot of us see the events as a way to get treasury notes &amp; exp.  The rest is just a side gain.  
---
Yes, I kill the legendaries of course.  I'm not going to pass one up.  But I also have about 3400lbs of weight in legendaries on a mule account to turn into scrip.
---
I'd argue:
---
Nightstalker one - Yes.  (the making noise one).  That *is* the boss.
---
Uranium Fever - they aren't bosses.  You just get 3 legendary spawns.  Not really the same thing.
---
I mean I take breaks from the game I get disappointed and sometimes I crash so much I don't play rest of the day or a few days
---
but  I also had 70-85% mostly good times and have never thought about leaving - its a mmo they change and evolve I like some content I don't like others its just the evolution of a mmo
---
I'm enjoying it.  I dont understand you guys.  You blast through it, like you are some sort of addict.  Then you come out into public, and complain.
---
Asked for a PLACE. You gave, and are still giving, vague shitty answers; that's how it's pulling my leg. 
---
Could have said sheepsquatch event like somebody else, could have said ss armour like another person, what about the Purveyor? All infinitely more helpful answers than your deliberately bullshit "anywhere with 3*s" like that helps AT ALL. 
---
Get fucked with your asshattery.
---
Love it. Me too. I legitimately love the game and storylines. I also enjoy have a few drinks and playing nuclear winter on the weekends with a few of the same people. 
---
It probably helps that I haven‚Äôt put in 1500+ hours into this game like I see some of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm quitting!‚Äù posters say. I think I that also helps keep me from getting to frustrated with some of the things I see people here complain about.
---
Whats it called exactly?
---
Yeah I recently moved on to Path of Exile instead, I tried for a long time to work with Bethesda to fix the shiny textures/glossiness and overtly bright lighting after Wastelanders came out, I went through everything, support, modders, .ini's even ended up getting a new computer (although I expected to upgrade for Cyberpunk anyway). 
---
The community response with me trying to raise the issue was weird, people would downvote my posts all to hell, they'd argue it was my (top line gaming rig?) computer that was the issue despite others having the exact same thing going on, or tell me that if the "graphics upgrade" wasnt to my liking I could go elsewhere (Bethesda downgraded lighting and textures as well as LOD and view distance with wastelanders, it was proven back then by someone digging in the game files, he also got downvoted).
---
All the while I was basically just trying to get some light shed on the issue so I could go on enjoying the game like everyone else, it was bizarre.
---
okay, how exactly are we meant to disallow shit updates?
---
Use a 3rd party server?
---
Play offline?
---
Not update?
---
What *exactly* are you saying we have power to do?
---
It‚Äôs not my job to fix crucial day 1 bugs. With that Attitude my company would be bankrupt already with no reason to complain about that, since we did not deliver what we promised/sold.
---
He found me last night. My feels still have not recovered.
---
I love the fallout franchise. I started playing with fallout 3. Its so weird because when I originally picked fallout 3 it was an accisental purchase and i meant to get another game that i no longer recall the name of. I remember booting up the GOTY edition of fallout 3 for the first time going this isnt what I wanted. Wtf is this? I was like well lets see what this is. Cant be that bad if it became goty. One of the best decisions i made. Then played backwards in the series then progressed forward to current. I love 76 a lot and i hope they continue to build upon and bring the game to its full potential and with their recent announcements of expeditions and return of vault raids i think they just might do that.
---
Bullshit
---
Or a blank response that says "see response" in the ticket line. They're really fond of that one lately.
---
Bugs online for days (literally), poorly added NPC's after the fact, no real graphics upgrade from FO4, NO MODS.
---
The list goes on compared to FO4's Preston Garvey bothering you about settlements every 5 minutes which is nothing compared to the issues in FO76.
---
I am more curious as to what can compel a person to stay in desolate Appalachia...
---
Since the raiders are busy rebuilding communications, while the settlers have you murder people trying to save their dying kids to get back equipment they're not even using its not exactly clear cut who the bad guys are.
---
Fuck Ward.
---
I see plenty of posts delivering legitimate criticism of the game - for example, I was extremely disappointed in this last patch. Of all of the patches we've seen, this one ranks in the top 3 worst (with an argument to be made that it may be THE WORST of the bunch).
---
On the flip side, I also like reading about (and doing myself) higher level players reaching out and helping lower levels where possible. I also enjoy most of my own experiences with the game &amp; have found ways to have fun, even when confronted with bugs which have existed for quite some time (including all the way back to BETA).
---
And I also disagree with your assessment that this community is "overly positive," - Fallout players, in general, are mostly single player (and a slightly older demographic), which means they tend to be a bit more mature.
---
Personally, I have two kids, been married for 22 years &amp; don't really have the motivation to get into internet pissing contests - I do want the game to get better &amp; have offered plenty of constructive feedback, but what some people consider "constructive" is not. At least not in the traditional sense.
---
Reading through this post was a rollercoaster of agreements and disagreements.  You have some valid points but I feel like you are way off on some others.
---
Cry all you want.  Game runs just fine for me.
---
You do realize that hearing people complain is annoying?  No one is trying to stifle your speech.  Its just that the whining and complaining is annoying.  I've played a lot of on-line games in my life, including dozens of MMOs.  This one aint all that bad.
---
its called "fixing the game while lying in patch notes"
---
Liking a lot of these ideas. But I say retire Nocturnal altogether. Get it out of the RNG loot tables so I have a chance at something useful day and night.
---
Happened to me last night with a Sheepsquatch in the Ash Heap.  I was fighting it with a team member, and after we took it down it immediately disappeared.  What's weird though is that my team mate could still see it and pointed out where the body was.
---
That is why I keep a low-level alt to do the level-up daily or weekly.  
---
Using the alt I get out of the vault.  I then use my main and FO1st to transfer enough 0.38 ammo, a decent pipe gun, and some leather armor to that alt.  There is risk in losing that if the FO1st server crashes, but at most I would lose cheap ammo and leather armor. 
---
Then I use the alt to head to Tyler County Dirt Track.  Once there I set up a simple CAMP.  I then take-over the workshop for easy XP and leveling. I repeat the taking of the workshop by changing public servers as often as I need to do all the level-up challenges.
---
Once the character's level gets too high I spend any accumulated caps at a vendor.  Then I use FO1st to transfer all my alt's stuff back to my main, delete the character,  and repeat.
---
Ok 4Head
---
I don‚Äôt think your suppose to fast travel while exploring. But I like your idea of the gathering aspect, indeed I always snatch on the go.
---
I love playing the simulator. /s Taking off my armor and weapons? I still have 150+ pounds? okayyy check for missiles and mini nuked..... none.  where's this 150 coming from?!
---
Cursing isn't inherently negative. "That's fucking awesome!" is a positive statement. 
---
I agree with everythign else you said, but as this is Reddit so it's always "Your either with me 100% or against me 100%.". You can like the game and still be able to point out the numerious bugs in it.
---
I have a Black Prospector's Hat that might look good...
---
I think I'm going to bite the bullet and get the outfit. I already got the mask.
---
Hello staying, I'm too
---
Good suggestions, I am almost 80 and have and have had more than a few repetitive motion injuries from heavy computer use and gaming over the last 30 years. Plus I have a great massage therapist that has fixed a lot of issues for me.
---
If you are not exercising and regularly stretching, I would suggest that you start immediately. I have been cycling, gym weight training, and/or running since the early 1970s. I expect to keep on gaming for the next 20 years.
---
This game is on its last leg. I only log to finish the SCORE challenges and do my rep grinds then I get off to play New Vegas and enjoy myself. 
---
I'm sick of the same boring events, dailies, etc. I've explored the whole world so there's nothing left to do on that front.
---
The endgame content or lack thereof will be the death of the game.
---
TS AGL here FTW!
---
It's not crying to point out that the games a mess and that's why 90% of people of some kind of issues, the desperate defenders of this game blow my mind. Theres such a weird sub-section of players like you that seem incapable of admitting theres a problem with this game
---
It's a glitch / bug / exploit.
---
I personally find 3/3 Luck of the draw to be a mandatory perk for any auto weapon. Its amazing on my commando, its amazing on my heavy gunner. I dont see why it wouldnt also work for Laser rifles, unless there is some particular bug specific to ultracite guns.
---
Downvote for weebtitle. Nice Screenshot though.
---
I still remember the map76 controversy. He got banned for letting Beth know of a major security issue.
---
I‚Äôm with you OP, release the junk walls by themselves
---
All bobbleheads and magazines have their own fixed spawn points (static spawns) around the map.  However, when playing the game each spawn point is not guaranteed to have the bobblehead or magazine.  That is RNG-based.  Also, it is possible for someone on the map to take the bobblehead or magazine before you got there.
---
I was on the fence about staying. Now I've decided I'm staying, too.
---
I was hoping it was some event. Do we know how it's done?
---
Well i run a bloodird buuld so I keep tons of rads on me. Only use the diluted ones to take a small amount off so I don't die. But I also learned the rad shower plan but haven't built it yet. Also I have waste barrels at my camp to give myself rads when needed.
---
I'm staying. I enjoy my broken, glitchy game, despite itself.
---
Seems like an exploit/glitch since the only thing that can be placed down are resource extractors the ammo producer is unique to the ammo factory like the fusion cores are to the power plants
---
Because Junkies has the down side of addictions and Mutations already reward the player.  A bump to 20-30% would be fine, but putting it online with Junkies just makes it and everyother build not Bloodied kind of pointless.

Got hooked on FO3 when my grandson started playing it, however many years ago. Have been playing the series ever since. I grew up in the 40s and 50s reading a lot of Sci-Fi. These games have brought that to life, not to mention the retro music.
---
I ain't going anywhere, I'm here to stay.
---
No one cares.
---
Vanguard‚Äôs and Autostim go well with the innate healing ability.
---
Which is annoying, because i would probably buy that off of you if it were possible  :(
---
People are still entertained by 76? 
---
I gave up back after Wastelanders came out; or maybe it was after rebuilding my C.A.M.P. for the 30th time
---
are you sure you haven't already completed it?
---
It's a double-edged sword - Fallout players (in general) tend to grind content. I started a new character &amp; was able to get through everything in-game in about two weeks...no matter how much content BGS puts in the game, a lot of players will be able to get through it pretty quick.
---
I also agree that the end-game needs to be addressed - I've done hundreds of Encryptid events, lord knows how many Queens, and have gotten used to the crappy rewards...and now that Building is all messed up, I don't even feel motivated to make camp changes.
---
I was looking forward to the Colossal Problem - but if they keep delaying it, it's going to be awfully hard for me to stay interested at all.
---
There's nothing left to do in the game except the score
---
I uninstalled the game today.  I don't care at all about making a big deal about it. Personally it was the battlepass  that killed the game for me. I used to log in and just do random shit and explore but the pass gave me chores. The bugs are also a travesty but whatever.
---
I don't think I've had launched a single one if it wasn't for them.
---
(I've launched a total of 4, I think - admittedly, not very much).
---
They rock
---
What do you mean buggy? The two bat corpses that followed me around cranberry bog for 30 minutes last night by teleporting to every map waypoint wasnt actually an intended feature?
---
It's commonly-known enough that a Google search would tell you. I'd tell you here but for rule 8 and all.
---
Again, Bethesda REALLY messed up by not creating a Fallout 76 for each individual player.
---
The BOS fatigues that used to be underarmor looks pretty cool.
---
Fixer paint
---
I'm pretty sure fo4 looks better than fo76 it definitely runs smoother
---
its a clitch from the update.  If someone did it recently on the server you wont be able to progress.  you need a friend with a private server to complete it.  or server hop and get lucky
---
i want banana
---
The game has some issues. The community has a shitload. Neither caused the other.
---
I would like one as well
---
Rather than old stuff coming back, why not a bunch of faction-relation new stuff (and no more Raider stuff please):
---
1. Faction Vendor Skins - i.e. MODUS Terminal skin for vendors
---
2. Weapon skins for the rest of the weapons we have (Fixer, Plasma Rifles, etc)
---
Not 100% sure why a level 300 would care about a level 40 mole miner in the first place, I have 2 level 240s and i usually just smack the legendary if it's close to me and do the come here emote
---
Cork. Cork never changes
---
Lol, like Bethesda is going to spend anymore money on this game, especially for music
---
Cool.
---
If you wanna do something that I think is fun, try to collect 1k of an item other than scrap or ammo.
---
Soon I'll be the Salisbury King.
---
Hit a camp that had a keypad leading to a small room with vending machines. My inner Admiral Akbar warned it could be a trap. Sure enough, the door slams behind me locking me in. No flames, rads or spikes, so I do a little shopping. Prices are pretty reasonable. Then it was out the window, plunging to the bottom of a very high cliff. This is why you always pack your PA, kids.
---
I hear you, but I find it hard to believe Fallout players enjoy grinding. Fallout 76 is the first grinder Fallout in the series. Fans of the series are fans because of the RPG elements first and foremost. This Fallout is an MMO. That being said, I see constant posts from fans taking breaks because the grinds are not enjoyable. 
---
One can only do so many queens before realizing how pointless it is two years in. Idk
---
I don't agree. Looking back, each time Bethesda did something people didn't like there was a ton of criticism. The TSE Nerf, the announcement of Fallout 1st, the inventory theft debacle. Each time they were scraping shit off the walls for weeks.
---
New hairstyles and tattoos are desperately needed!!
---
Multiple Chars /accounts
---
Your naivety is astounding.
---
Makes sense, given Fallout 4 felt like a test bed for Fallout 76,
---
Multiple characters. You can set up 4 ‚Äúalts‚Äù to carry extra stuff including caps.
---
Conformity got us this mess of a game in the first place.
---
Picket fences.
---
No one is defending the game here.  I‚Äôm just pointing game runs just fine for me.

I get all the bugs like everyone else.  But my game runs smooth.

Installing a game on a drive other than the system drive does not qualify as a user made error.  It's inexcusably shitty coding if this is the actual problem.  Many people use smaller SSDs for a system drive with their programs installed elsewhere, there is allot of reasons to do this and its fairly common practice.
---
Takes 5 minutes to make a new character who can then hold 30k and you can have 5 characters.
---
There's toxic positivity, and there's toxic negativity - and this group bounces between the two extremes with little talk of balanced reviews. 
---
Yes the game has many issues - I make a mental note in the first hour of play, if I don't see at least 3 problems it's a good day. Most are just intermittent annoyances, but a small number are indeed potential game breaking - and Bethesda must stand up and take responsibility. No ifs no buts - fix bugs and glitches, or keep the community informed as to progress if its taking time (silence is the worst enemy!). 
---
But posters must also suck it up and realise SHOUTING and Fucking Swearing at every single tiny little point is counter productive, and just make some people look like idiots. I had a job where there was a philosophy that anyone could make a comment, complaint or suggestion to their superiors regardless of how minor, silly or even plain wrong it was, but the moment they swore or because abusive they became just a wall of noise to be ignored. Do people really think the Devs will take notice if posts that are little short of personal abuse? I wouldn't. 
---
Etc etc...could add more but life had to be lived.
---
smaller indie games support it, a "triple AYY" title does not. Why.
---
Reddit threads are so predictable I can't tell if it's some wacky human nature thing or if they do it because they see it thousands of times on other subs.
---
Before I tapped out I was collecting legendary golf clubs.  I was going to wear the golf outfit and go around smacking things.  The thing that would have made that perfect was a golf club bag that I could use like a backpack.
---
I normally play on a private server. In my experience, once everyone has fully looted the ash pile it will disappear and the meat pile is accessible. This is more difficult in a public server to get everyone to fully loot the ash piles. But I think I've also experienced them clearing on their own after a little while if participants have left the area, but I need to verify this.
---
I'm not certain if the goo piles work the same.
---
Ah fair, no then there hasn't been a patch. I was only wondering as my system drive doesn't have the space. Oh well.
---
Yeeeeah be really careful if you build your base on the billboard in CB outside Watoga. My wife did and I was sniping ghouls at the antique shop and out in the field when her base started getting blown to hell.  Eventually it stopped we repaired it and went about our biz. Went back to sniping. Same thing happened. She was freaking out and about to scrap her whole base when I researched it and realized my Recon scope was setting off the Distant Thunder quest. Now we only use long scopes there and it‚Äôs fine. It was bizarre but funny as hell once we figured it out.
---
Well, "grind" can have multiple definitions. "Grinding" content is different than the time-gated grind of getting gold or scrip.
---
Many Fallout players will go through multiple play-through of the old games, to try every single choice, every single outcome, etc - that's the kind of grind the player base in used to - and its why we find the lack of content updates to be frustrating - which leads to players pushing through new content as fast as they can, because they are hungry for it.
---
I've had to start writing my own Fallout 76 novel to really keep myself interested - my game time is dedicated to building out lore, locations, and characters I need to write.
---
It's what I do to keep myself occupied.
---
That's literally where I am. Missed a weekend or three. But can't play everyday. Thankful for the extra challenges
---
Maybe because the audience for indie games is more polite or they need the revenue from player with niche hardware?
---
If no one told you yet, fed76.info is very useful for price checking on pc.
---
I wasn't on reddit when the game launched. I was told that in the benning people would post "unconfirmed" bugs just to jump on the hate bandwagon, making F76 bad post without even playing the game and so on. So the people enjoying the game fought back. I'm sure you can see where this is going.
---
totally!  I still have like 1900 atoms.
---
Playtime power armor paint.
---
They should just release the waiting area as a map with no weapons. Just fisticuffs until the last man is standing
---
Right, so I don‚Äôt understand the difference between a random spawn and static spawn for bobble heads like OP said
---
You get my updoot for the effort, lots of links and was well thought out. However, I'll tell you that it did come off as negative (to me) and I'm not one of those who cant handle "reality in a plate". Its not like there aren't any upsides to the game, and this community is by a long shot one of the best and most positive I have personally dealt with vs. all the other community's I've encountered (minus ghost of Tsushima, theres like 0 negativity there) I also disagree about the whole "cheating" thing,  I dont like holyer-than-thous. I dont personally dupe, but I do however enjoy a good Tanagra town/glass cavern ultracite glitch, and I'm not one to turn away a nice stack of presents (we dont ask where they came from) No, it's not a symptom of society's downfall, if my shady cousin comes by with a nice 60" flatscreen and says I can have it for $100, morality can go kick rocks. Anyone who thinks that that kind of mindset is a new thing is just plain wrong.  Really. 
---
At the end of the day, we gotta exist inside our own heads and, honestly,  I cant let what other folks do take up head space. BGS will either fix it or it wont, roll the dice and may the lag be in your favor.
---
Maybe tell that to MicroSoft? Beth has no say in this error.
---
I did the event for the first time last night because i just happened to be nearby when it procced and figured id try it. Having never done it before i parked my character (a babby L25 stealth commando) on top of the walkway bridge in the middle of the palace area so i could most efficiently cover the southernmost hub and the central hub. The ghouls spawned is a mass near the southern hub and just stayed there milling about.
---
I could plink one of them to draw small grounds toward me and kill them at my leisure. The other hubs were never even threatened.
---
&gt;And it's not people's fault for allowing them to keep delivering "shit" updates? 
---
From my understanding, the 76 community spent a LARGE amount of time sending in tickets and submitting bugs to Bethesda only for nothing to ever come of it.
---
They never gave two-cents from the beginning; remember the whole issue with the "canvas bag" they promised on their pre-order that became a HUGE problem. 
---
It's easy to think the the culture here is to blame (and some people do just fuckin suck) but ultimately I thinks it's up to developers to listen to the people who purchase the game and support their products.
---
Take No Man's Sky for example, that game FLOPPED hard initially, but they remapped and came out stronger than ever!
---
TL; DR: Bethesda screwed the pooch from the begging of this game.
---
The Xbox One X seems to not be affected by the graphic glitching but the S sure is.
---
Oh ok and how do I transfer stuff/caps to these accounts? (I never had 2 account so idk)
---
There is a way, it involves you either linking a file or something else. Just hunt for the post here on reddit. It'll work.
---
Oh man i am so sorry. I should have known that i could have recommended SS armour when you specifically asked for heavy combat armour. WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT! I am such a silly goose! Why don't you try heavy robot armour? Am i doing it right?
---
So. Someone recommends you look up "Sheepsquatch/Event Spawns in high level areas". Would you say that those places would be where high level enemies spawn? A simple yes or no answer will suffice. No need to damage any more of my brain cells today.
---
In fact i'll save you the trouble. The answer is Yes. Yes, high level enemies spawn there.
---
Is that how they are spawning on the transmitter?!  I'd seen camps there but I didn't know that was what was causing it.
---
What are you talking about?  No one would play Xbox during work hours, that would be irresponsible! 
---
*shhhhh*
---
For him to collect junk and scrap you will have to own the normal collectron . Same thing for every other collectron also
---
You only get one camp with a ridiculously minuscule budget. The only way to be a "camp builder" in this game is to keep tearing down, relocating and rebuilding the same goddamn camp over and over and over and over.  No thanks.
---
Ah, thank you. I wasn't aware of that. Because I use shotguns it might happen that I sometimes don't hit her often enough because of the height.
---
So I might chase her more and be at her when she lands.
---
lol. I'm dropping legendaries at low level's camps all the time. I have no use for scrip
---
You probably saw empty bottles, or maybe you were looking at the communist one? It only gives weapons/ammo or chems/alcohol
---
I don't any have issues installing game pass games to drives other than my system drive.
---
While the other person‚Äôs response was abrasive, hidden underneath is a good point: so what do we do?  
---
While this may be the ‚Äùofficial‚Äù subreddit, it‚Äôs still just reddit.  We are only a small portion of the overall player base, many of which never even go online except to hunt down an answer to something.  
---
We see people calling for a boycott of depositing materials to the BOS - is that really going to do anything?  Is Bethesda going to suddenly learn their lesson and put more staff on the game and invest more money to fix the problems?  No.  
---
Do we all go to the extreme and all cancel our 1st subscriptions, all stop playing, and just send ticket after ticket?  Is this subreddit even big enough to make a dent?  Would that even have any effect?  
---
Since beta there have been issues plaguing this game, some still exist since day one.  No amount of yelling, screaming, submitting tickets Has made any changes.  We constantly are asking for more content and they can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt deliver.  What do **YOU** want us to do?  What do **YOU** think is going to fix this? 
---
For some people it‚Äôs not that we are pretending that the game is an great condition, rather that we have reached the point of negativity that we just don‚Äôt see the game getting any better, Some of us have played previous games from bethesda that had bugs since day one that were never fixed and only unofficial patches resolved the issue. There are perks from FO4 that just don‚Äôt work without the patch, period.  We still have at least some fun with it, so we stick around.  
---
I‚Äôm bored with this game.  I collect piles of junk in this game and for no purpose.  My camp is pretty much set.  All the good stuff I want to use is legendary anyways.  I‚Äôm sitting on stockpiles of improved repair kits.  The only reason I‚Äôm logging in is because with COVID I can‚Äôt get together with my buddy in person so we log onto 76 to chat and just screw around.
---
I only have 70 cork....
---
You can scrap the crop itself to replant it. Sure it's a bit more convenient to repair it, but scrapping the broken crop yields the crop itself - then you can just replant it.
---
Its not a heat shield its a cheese grater and no i dont believe there are any without it but the fancy shotgun has a long barrel and no heat shield
---
I still don't have that much trouble with the level ups, but everywhere I look for Bobbleheads is picked clean. I'd rather grind some XP than server hop a dozen times.
---
people trade goods for stuff over 30k usually. or use ammo. 
---
Like for instance someone could have 1 each of the serum recipes which they might value at 7-10k each. So someone could buy something worth 70K+ with say 10 of them. Ya feel me?
---
You can use a friend to transfer stuff between characters
---
contemporary house kit
---
Is this Innov Survivalist off YouTube? I like your news videos, subscribe and watch them regularly. Really not sure I agree with this post though.
---
I want additional adhesive recipes, as well as more crops.
---
I guess the men can wear the mob suit with the white wolf fedora...and a Tommygun (submachine gun). I think I will do that!
---
That‚Äôs not an issue. Xp for those who do
---
Protip - we havent.
---
I love this post. I also feel the same.
---
Happy day of cake
---
Bethesda is padding the numbers.
---
I've also had this bug happen on PC. Thankfully that's not a rare plan at least, you can buy it from a robot vendor I'm pretty sure.
---
I‚Äôd be curious if a data miner could bring some info for this. 
---
I‚Äôve always found it weird that you can‚Äôt really have a ‚Äútank‚Äù in this RPG. You can have healers, and dps and ‚ÄúTanky‚Äù people but no way for them to get the Agro consistently.
---
What about this idea?
---
For the level up one where it awards 100 Score we get 20 atoms on top of that. For the 250 ones, 40 and for the 1k score we get 80 atoms. Would be nice.
---
Neato I'll look into that. Good to know I got SCORE even if i forgot to hop outta my armor before logging one day cause ive had this issue almost the whole Run/Season.
---
At this point I'm convinced they know they set the wrong numbers for the wrong mats and are just bumping it up so we'll pass it anyways.
---
Also, why is this guy not asking for Food/Water for BoS?
---
Will do man, cheers! :)
---
For auto rifle builds, Ground pounder greatly improves your hip fire accuracy, and reduces reticle size. You can also use longshot on auto rifles to inprove range and dmg droppoff.
---
If you like shotguns, skeet shooter is an awesome perk to run. You can ADS and hit at sniper range with a combat/pump.
---
Strafing is your best friend in gunfights, even more so than frog legs. Usually you can strafe faster than stationary people can turn/aim. Just practice at it, never finish a gunfight in the same place you started. Zig-zag, use cover, dodge behind trees until you see them reload, strafe, use elevation for headshots.
---
Yeah people love to complain and say ‚Äú76 bad‚Äù to get free karma
---
Or other people would assist the players to fight together, or just one shot your legendary while sitting on high watching search for that one stuck ghoul.
---
I get it, thanks
---
I would play that map. Best thing is everyone would vote for new maps to get variety anyways :)
---
The fireworks are supposed to be used at the event. It boosts the meter by a decent amount.
---
PC to play with mods
---
Awesome post. I'm staying too.
---
There is no "random spawn point" for bobbleheads or magazines.  They are all fixed.  The only thing random is whether or not the bobblehead is there or not when you load the map.  
---
OP may be confused by the terminology.
---
Tattered dress for sure
---
Its part of a 5-tape series&gt;! that begins in the Mire and progresses as she follows the scorched back to GC to take revenge for the death of her sons.!&lt;
---
then why F76 at E3 had 32:9 support.
---
Be me, a level 550 player. Stand in corner and watch other people do the event. Fall sleep while event goes on. Suddenly, detecting terminated management personel. Wake the fuck up.  Sprint to room. One shot it with 3* legendary bloodied magic gauss shotgun. Go back to center of the room and sleep again.
---
I think the northern part of the map where Toxic Valley and Savage Divide meet would be cool.  Include the civil war area, the graveyard, the statue on the hill, Crater, Grafton if it's close enough.  There would be water hazards, lots of opportunity to go running out in the open for a high risk-high reward scenario.
---
It‚Äôs to remove duped materials
---
hm everytime I server hop I get the T fuse back but no blood samples
---
Carved pumpkin may be your best bet
---
Believe it or not Anthem is going through this right now. They aren't making new content every other week. Its practically radio silence. Its painful but I do feel like Anthem will be much greater for it. And if EA wont just kill it then theres no way Zenimax does lol
---
I‚Äôm not even looking forward to Colossal Problem, it doesn‚Äôt accomplish anything.  It‚Äôll be interesting till I get the one or two things interesting out of the event, then I‚Äôm done. 
---
I need a reason to collect junk.  I don‚Äôt even care about the legendary gear that drops, or my scrip limits, or cap limits.  I go to a location, kill the things, pick up the ‚Äúloot‚Äù which is primarily weapons, armor, and junk.. take it back to my camp and then... have no use for any of it.  
---
Sure, occasionally I pick up something that increases my DPS by 5% or my DR by 10%...but I honestly don‚Äôt even need that, even on my non-meta builds.  
---
It‚Äôs like the whole cycle of Kill --&gt; Loot ‚Äî&gt; improve is missing a key element of ‚Äúimprove‚Äù once you have your build pretty much set.  At this point I‚Äôm just earning caps to complete collections of plans I‚Äôll never use.
---
It's an exploit involving blueprinting workshop equipment and then placing it elsewhere.
---
Its easy to do, and can produce a good quantity of ammo. They also eat your Camp budget and scrapping/relocation won't give it back. And of course opens you up to punitive punishments. 
---
Most respectable players wouldn't touch it, very much buyer beware. And FYI private team members can build them in your Camp without your permission so be careful of accepting accept random 'friends'
---
They cannot.  You don't even get the prompt to be able to interact with it if it isn't yours.
---
Wak
---
Mods are thing though
---
Excellent. Thank you!
---
You will have to re collect the sample then. That happens with some main quest when you log out set you back a little bit.
---
That is so true, you have the casual gamer and then also people who play it like a full time job and grind through content in a week and complain there is not enough to do.
---
Sucks with the bug man, i was lucky enough to get it done right. Are you on ps4? I have a bunch of plans i'd love to donate since theyre catching dust in the stashbox.
---
I‚Äôd say the tattered dress and a skull scrap item. If not one of the jarred Scorched heads.
---
Hey Bethesda, I think I want a hamburger for lunch!
---
I've been trying to farm supermutants and scorched for their guns. Still not getting nearly enough cork.
---
Maybe to get away from people like you?
---
Like the other guy said I am on PS4 so I can't help. Just post on here you need someone with PC private server to let you log in and add as a friend
---
&gt; They really need to half the challenges and double the points for the next season. It takes too much time each day and so many things aren't what you would usually do.
---
I understand this won't be popular - but I disagree.  What you guys seem to want - is a game you only need to log in a few minutes to play, to experience the reward.
---
What I don't get:  if you are only logging in to do the legendary run, why are you logging in?
---
I log in most days - to play.  As part of that play, I look at the dailies, and guide my play style after it.  But even then, I don't necessarily get every daily done.
---
And... with more than a month to go, I'm at level 82 on the run?
---
Cranberries might be the exception that actually makes sense: they grow in a bog, not in regular soil. But agree on everything else.
---
Always happy to help! Though Pure runs NukaCrypt. I run MODUS with Pure's help :)
---
I have a Cork to steel ratio of 69:1, and I've donated 420,000 cork.
---
I genuinely don't think that a weapon balance patch will be small because every aspect of combat - weapons, armour, how DR and special weapon effects work, balancing/bug fixing of legendary effects, consumable buffs and balancing overall, ALL of it needs to be addressed. That's no small feat.
---
I launched my first nuke last night at level 40, had to do it solo because my friend hadn't started the enclave questline. Went in with full T-51 and used 5 plasma cores, had to craft 3 more on a tinkers workbench inside to stay alive lmao
---
 Won't lie, this game is still buggy as hell yet it's better after wastelanders imo. Would've been a drastically different experience for me without friendly npcs lmao

That's a really good question. Be nice to know so we can, possibly, steal SBQ's attention and pull her away from all of the tents and buildings.
---
Yeah that's what I do sometimes if I care enough about the loot... use the cryolater on her when she lands, freeze her good then melee the crap out of her lol
---
I still laugh every time he says "Sometimes I think about burning this camp down."
---
You‚Äôll need a trusted friend to hold the caps while you log out and back in with your alt character. 
---
You can also hire couriers from trusted market subs to perform the job.
---
I wasnt sure if their rarity - so since I only ever got one I figured I'd keep it
---
I think I'll take one too, ill pick up the tab
---
While I agree that the other Public Parties could use a buff, I don't think a fast travel discount should be applied to the explorer team.  
---
Fast travel points are previously discovered POIs, so even if you had 100% discount, you can only travel to locations you know and that's not exploring imho.
---
You on Xbox? Try out grounded.
---
FO76 isn't a single player game.
---
Happened to me a few days ago as well. Ended up throwing a bunch of grenades and leveled up instantly.
---
The same thing happened when I did the hunting daily. The one Yao Guai I had to hunt fought against a horde of Radstacks.
---
Scorched head in a jar you can find in one of the hangers at Morgantown airport comes to mind for me
---
Where would find a jarred Scorch head?
---
Any recommendations for a third item to go in?
---
Same here. I found out after the event. I think I still have it on my alt.
---
running @ != support
---
What other games you got in mind ? Right now I‚Äôm hopping between rdr2 online and fo76
---
LOL
---
Nice
---
We‚Äôre do you find this fancy shotgun?
---
Yeah, I knew there was a simple answer to my stupid quesiton lol. Thanks :P
---
Please Mr pebbles backpack
---
People just love to stand by and defend their smelly piece of shit...
---
Most of the posts on this sub are: "this game doesn't suck right? haha I know, right!! so does not suck, at all. (screaming internally)"
---
Oh no... i have enough on my plate with Elite dangerous, modern warfare, destiny 2, and GTA online. But i do plan on checking it out at some point
---
Alright dude this isn't debate club, it's really weird to insinuate that people posting a funny screenshot from a game they like is making the game worse, talk about loss of touch with reality
---
&gt;It's not about deserving more. It's obvious they have no idea what they're player base does for playing.
---
this. Remember how surprised they were too when they realized not everyone in the game is into pvp? That a majority of the players just want to have fun and help each other out? Yes. they were surprised that we arent all kdr tryhards. They kept feeding us pvp incentives (like a bounty if you come across a gov supply drop) and we didn't bite. Heck I don't even think Hunter/Hunted is widely used. That being said I really wish the civil war reenactments event could come back.
---
Bethesda needs to change the reward structure for events so that people are only rewarded upon successful completion of the event. 
---
Maybe even go so far as enemies linked to the event don't give xp, loot or legendaries (at least directly). Only reward what you might have gotten at the end. Otherwise it'd be just like it is now where people focus on killing enemies and chasing legendaries because even if the event fails, you're still rewarded.
---
I am still caring for the loot because I just started to optimize my build, looking for a better shotgun and still lacking enough flux or any components to stabilize the raw flux... I am saving up on a nice pair of jetpack :D
---
Just updated my comment and I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs candles but lighting it with the tabletop lanterns would give you the same sort of effect...
---
Love it man!
---
See... this is a rad idea that Bethesda will immediately ignore. 
---
*sighs in 76*

Its a unique weapon from the pleasant valley tickets https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PPORFfLOL5A

&gt;I've had to start writing my own Fallout 76 novel to really keep myself interested - my game time is dedicated to building out lore, locations, and characters I need to write.
---
I had to do something similar, I was traveling from location to location, and keeping track of the averages of scrap I got from the static junk there, how many ammo containers, trash cans, med kits (so you can use Perks to get extra stuff), ho many plants and of what type.    
---
It was different than some of the other guides out there.    
---
Unfortunatly, that also made me realize how useless 99% of what is out in the world is.  Great, here‚Äôs where I can walk away with 15 bloodleaf and 30 carrot flowers.  Who cares?
---
Well don't let the doors bang on your balls on your way in.
---
Us Fallout 1st members can hold unlimited caps. As well as scrip, bullion, and something else I'm forgetting. 
---
Lol, can you imagine the outrage if they actually did that?
---
Not thought of that, can't say I've seen anyone myself doing that, good point though.
---
Oh okay, thank you for the heads up.
---
Only grinding on MW currently so I‚Äôve been able to play for a bit. I was quite surprised. Definitely did not think I‚Äôd be into as much as I am.
---
yea asked already but noone replied yet soo. I might need to buy the subscription then or do we know when the next patch is gonna be?
---
No. I was looking at a Raider one who had actually Junk in it.
---
People gave this post money, lol.
---
If it‚Äôs throwable it should be the same
---
I had tried for a long time to get to it before mobs killed it and never had any luck. Every time I just arrived to a lifeless corpse. So sad
---
It's been almost a year since we had that handful of NW maps datamined. Why do we still only have one new one?
---
Yeah... total garbage, please give them to me, especially if they are junkies or bloodied. :D
---
I'd have thought RP as BOS would be pretty lonely so far, they will come into their own then when BOS dlc drops.
---
Why not go for ap? We are getting poison resist legendary perk (when ever they manage to come out)
---
I'd rather they spend the money on more devs.
---
I'm balancing my real job with jobs 2 and 3, (destiny 2 and elite dangerous) while playing with friends in GTA online and modern warfare
---
That‚Äôs why I jump around like a madman out in the open. 50% of the time it seems she‚Äôll target me. And then when she lands, 50% of the time she takes right back off...
---
so, you're saying that programmers at bethesda cant code their game? since modders did make workarounds for 21:9, before bethesda stole the mod?
---
Lol unlimited currency would be insane
---
No, getting another mutation wont replace an existing one. WITH the exception of carnivore/herbivore, of which only the first sticks. I have 13-15  mutations, I cant remember.
---
yeah. it overrides the other
---
You can't swap. Until you get rid of carnivore, you won't be able to have herbivore.
---
Oh yes it‚Äôs legit my friend. 
---
My first encounter there was the same as yours. 
---
But someone said they have had the pleasure to. Talk to the women. 
---
So I started going back every once in a while. And suddenly it activated the encounter
---
Miria was always my favorite companion from Fallout 2, not because she was any good, but because I was a dumb teen. I always cheated to make her better.
---
There are candles, believe they are unlocked with the same plan as the oil lantern
---
Maybe a long shot, but did you already turn in notes at the foundation?
---
I‚Äôm almost 40 but have never played fo3 or fo NV. I tried to go back and play them awile back and couldn‚Äôt get through them. Once you go forward it‚Äôs hard to go back to shit graphics
---
I think I have my top two flipped, but otherwise I agree with your whole list!
---
That gets me everytime, love it!
---
Ah, I see where you're coming from.  I started my current character from scratch after doing some reading and understanding how to build a specific type of character.  I now run a stealthy sniper build.
---
Before that, I ran with a lvl 110 character that is  a jack of all trades, so he really isn't super strong in any area or particularly weak either.  I spread all the points out evenly thinking it's better to have a spread of points than to be weak in any SPECIAL stat.  That thinking, for me, was a bad approach.  It's also before I knew about the benefits of mutations!  I avoided radiation as much as possible.  :)
---
So there is give and take for sure.  My sniper can carry 260 in weight.  That's with the Chinese armour and a large backpack modded with the grocer add on and strategic perk cards to lower ammo, junk and chem weights.  I have gotten used to that limit and find it's more than manageable.  A rib eye steak will add 20 extra in a pinch.
---
When I picked a "build" I realized early on that at lvl 40 or so, my new character would kick the living crap out of the lvl 110 character I was running before.  I get a lot more out of the game this way.  The sniper isn't great for battles with the SBQ unless you have a team of big guns who join (which is 95% of the time) but I can easily rack up the 1K in damage need to get the drop and pick up a ton of XP picking off the pests she drops.  It's fun and helps the big guns focus on the main goal.
---
Anyway, rather long winded, but that was my reason for asking about your character build.
---
I've been a melee tank-build the entire time I've played and if I'm the only one meleeing a mob and everyone else is at range then in my experience I'm the one the mob is going to prioritize. I don't believe you can "pull" a mob off of someone with damage, I'd say they pick the closest engaged player they have a path to and stick to them until another engaged target becomes easier to hit. Making yourself the easiest target to hit is how you get "aggro".
---
No sorry the one you take will be wasted, you need to remove carnivore or herbivore depending on your circumstance before taking the new one.
---
You will gain the 1 hour benefit of zero negative effects though from the serum.
---
Something like that they will hot hotfix. I know on the Raiders questline you weren't able to get into the mine. But they fixed that a few days after. So they're definitely working on this if you have a little patience. I'd say within a week it should be fixed.  But it's Bethesda so you know  just keep posting every time you're going to play about it a private.
---
I've already got the candles set up! Will try both a Skull and try and get a Jarred Head to see how they each look.
---
You have someone hold the caps or items from char 1 and give them to char 2
---
PSA: Still not worth giving away your resources.
---
I think my choice of 'word salad' in the search engine was to robust. lol
---
I feel that except i only have 1 job . I try to play before I go into work and I try to play on my 2 days off
---
Its definetly a lot of fun, way more fun to play with friends than it is solo XD
---
Aye, jarred Scorched parts in the Laboratory hanger.
---
But almost every performance problem with this game is down to the games software not player rigs. Latency specifically is a big one, the game holds together like wet diarrhoea.
---
You can only get 200 bullion (20 treasury Notes) per reset.
---
So check the bottom right of the window to see if there are any bullion left.
---
So your logic is because it happened to you it allows you to do it to other people? That's an asshole move . And I hit my shots on legendaries most of the time the problem is not even being able to reach the legendary before some high level dude instantly one shots it
---
to be fair even though the graphics may have been dated when Fallout 2 came out, I had no money, so I was only able to borrow my older brother's games. My choices were Fallout 2 or Final Fantasy 7. I played a ton of both of those.
---
Wow! You are an asshole.
---
My guess is either dupers or Bethesda padding the numbers.
---
Whatever the actual reason, we're safe. You could put in zero effort and I would be VERY surprised if we don't make the target.
---
yes or scorched. they are everywhere at Morgantown
---
Shop hasn't updated yet.
---
I stay away from glitch exploits. I had several games over the years that I had to restart after investigating 100s of hours because of complications with updates or game expansions. Thanks for the info.
---
I‚Äôm throwing in the towel on cork. Took the course of several days playing to collect enough for a single donation. Using what I had in stash, visiting place after place that had been picked clean, resorting to buying some at a train station and still not having enough that I had to scrounge some more ... I suck at this. And I swear the mutants are deliberately dropping assault and hunting rifles just to mess with me. Any other week, I‚Äôd be flush with mutants coming at me with pipe guns.
---
give this man an autoaxe.
---
Okay thanks! I'm new to reddit how to you get the cool tags next to your name?
---
It's such a strange creature and placed in such a horrible location for actually finding one alive. The only plus is that I got thousands of acid from killing so many crickets, since they respawn 99% of the time when you change servers.
---
I saw someone get bent out of shape and rant how they were leaving and never coming back.
---
Someone posted "This isn't the airport, you don't have to announce your departure, just go."
---
I'm still chuckling about that response. It was a beautiful thing.
---
I don‚Äôt get these posts
---
Oh yeah and as Hopalongtom said...craft, destroy, craft, destroy....that's how I got the silencers for all my weapons.  Took a little while, but remaining invisible/undetected is critical for success for the way I play it.  It's pretty fun to sneak through a huge mob of lvl 60+ enemies, literally  within touching distance, with them none the wiser.
---
Context helps
---
but yes. Cameras don't weight anything.
---
I don't consider replaying a single player game a grind. Grind is a term used in MMOs to get better gear or items by repeating the same repetitive tasks over and over again. 
---
This issue with 76 is that there are not unique weapons or armors to actually grind for, and the grind is worse because legendary effects are too random.
---
Plus the tasks we do have to grind are lacking in depth
---
It‚Äôs on sale rt now for only 20. I‚Äôm liking it so far, bout 15 hours in.
---
Sounds just as trustworthy as the NCR, sure I could use some rum
---
No, no treasury notes have been turned in.
---
YOU get a stein! AND YOU get a stein! We all get Steins!
---
Send me 100 dollars.
---
"There are no men like me. Only me."
---
But I sure do appreciate your attempt to try to offend me.
---
Then I do not know.. welcome to fallout.. did any of the other presses work?
---
They wont read this post or care if they did, I don't see the point?
---
This may be a mind shattering point for many players here, but... don‚Äôt buy atoms. I have been boycotting spending anymore money on this game since it came out until it reaches a state I feel is worth rewarding financially. Though it has improved tremendously since launch I still consider it to be poorly optimized and poorly handled.
---
If you're so concerned about having too many caps, you could buy stuff from players and drop it again
---
Thats a similar routine to mine. I think I confused you in my wording. I only have one real job, but "destiny 2" and "elite dangerous" are *like* a second job, in how progress is lost by taking a break, sorry for the confusion.
---
You could say it was 
---
well done.
---
Loony Tunes is weeb?
---
I posted that I quit a few days ago to clearly leave the reason why I'm quitting -&gt; bugs. I couldn't care less if other people care about me leaving or not but I do care about Bethesda knowing why I'm leaving in some desperate attempt for them to listen to their community for once.
---
Ok well I have the raider one and it doesn‚Äôt produce junk besides glass lol
---
I like it, personally.  It gives me something to do other than join server/launch three nukes on SBQ/server hop/repeat.  I‚Äôm really trying to pace myself on the Legendary Run, doing daily quests and not farming xp too hard, but I only have eight ranks left.  Hopefully Colossal Problem will go live soon.
---
Never seen it broken
---
I'll do it for $10
---
I'll do it for $75
---
Hit the 3 dots in the top right corner on the sub's front page and it gives you the option to change user flair. On phone anyway, not sure about on a normal browser.
---
That‚Äôs not my experience in the 2 years I‚Äôve been playing.    Bugs yes.  Latency/lag never. Well not until this tesla bug now.
---
On top of that, are you really exploring if you're fast traveling? My favorite way to ay is walking everywhere as I always find something new.... to explore.
---
Yea, neither do I, but it gives like minded people a place to gather and discuss amongst themselves
---
Cheap whore!!
---
Before the last patch, it was always broken to the point where we didnt go there anymore unless we had a kill mole miner challenge,  after the last patch, we tried it once, the containers had stuff.. dont know if we got lucky though..  might have to try a few more times
---
Saw that people like to randomly say they're staying in F76 expecting others to care and give karma
---
Here's a staying karma whore post
---
Thanks!
---
Hi! Welcome to Appalachia! If you are friends with someone, you can join their world. If not, you can become teammates with players in the world you spawn in. Feel free to add me as a friend (phinfan007). I am level 170 but am a very casual player. I'm willing to help out with whatever I can!
---
going from Fallout 76 to Fallout 4 I found that they run about the same, but there was a few QoL tweaks made for Fallout 76 that make Fallout 4 difficult. 
---
The first was not being able to scrap junk. You basically have to carry all the junk to a settlement and then drop it on the ground and then scrap it. 
---
The second is not being able to pick up and carry power armor. you had to wear it to move it. 
---
The third was the lack of a hunger/thirst system. Like I have all this food with no purpose at all. They added survival mode, but it is a pain in the neck where there is no gradual reduction, but instead 1 second you are fine, the next second all your stats are reduced and you are going to die. A lot of people hate on Fallout 76 hunger and thirst sytem, but I really enjoy it compared to Fallout 4 or Skyrim's survival sytem.
---
There's a cooldown on the containers
---
Typically, you have to wait for the next weekly Atom Shop update for the reward to show up.
---
Well since you're on XBox, you can use XBox Live's "Looking For Group" function and make a post that you want some teammates to play with.
---
Also, you can join a Public Team from the Game's Social menu, though be warned that a lot of people are just doing this for the bonus and not actively looking to run around and play as a team. Some are though!
---
My recommendation: From your map, open the Social menu and create your own Public Team. People will be able to see your level and some may or may not join. Then post in "Looking for Group" - "Low level looking to play with a few people" and let them know your mic usage preferences.
---
You can always play with any friends in a private or public team as long as they have the game and join your server.
---
I have, before the last patch the only thing that would spawn in the containers was a meteoric sword.. highly sporadically... the vast majority of them were simply empty.. doesnt matter public or private server
---
Here's the one I hate:  I spend 2K on a card and start Encryptid.  I take 2 or 3 pylons, spamming super stims like crazy to stay alive.  Then some asshat with a hacked weapon kills the imposter sheepsquatch before I can get a shot off.
---
I just read in another thread that it helps if you wait a few minutes- if you jump out and right back in, you're more likely to return to the same server.
---
I'm thinking it might be based on who dealt the most damage (possibly in a given time frame).
---
I did a couple SBQ events at V9, where everyone was on the bunker or rear fences. I stood East of the bunker, outside of the fenceline, closer to Prime, and got the first shot in with a Gauss minigun and just kept it on her. Everyone else started unloading as she approached.
---
She landed right on me and everyone swarmed. Everyone basically left the bunker and was now in the open. She switched targets several times and never took off. Event was over in about 2-3mins after she landed.
---
I would love to have an aggroing perk. Basically something that increases the aggro rate or something. 
---
Could imagine a party of 4
---
1. Tank
---
2. Healer (if they ever fixed the flamer)
---
3. DPS
---
4. DPS
---
Could open up things they could do new content. But also could create LF Tank
---
What‚Äôs the cool down? Because I did it 24 hours ago (yesterday morning), just did the event 5 minutes ago and there was nothing in it.
---
The issue with there being too many caps is global.  This is an issue that has affected every other online game with any type of economy that has a currency that doesn‚Äôt have sufficient ways to remove that currency from the game. 
---
Right now the only barrier we have to inflation is our cap ceiling, people can‚Äôt sell items for more than 30K caps so instead they use alternate currencies such as ammo or straight up trading. 
---
If we continue to remove the existing cap sinks, and since everyone bitches about the 30K caps max...how much do you think items would go for?  a B/25/25 Fixer would keep going up and up in price because there is nothing taking that caps out of the economy, Which is already screwed up as it is.
---
I think the highest I‚Äôve seen for caps cost to fast travel was mid-60‚Äôs.  You‚Äôll earn that back from completing quests, and if your on a team, you‚Äôll get free caps out of no where while your team mates complete quests too. It doesn‚Äôt even cost caps to fast travel to public events that give you rewards.
---
We don‚Äôt need to make fast travel any cheaper.
---
I mean once Cyberpunk 2077 hits, I am definitely leaving.  Even if all the bugs and crap Bethe does is fixed by November, nothing is going to change that.
---
Well most major factions have deep flaws. I don‚Äôt know, in fallout 3 and in 76 they tried to act like good guys. The enclave is the worst as are raiders. If they made responders an real faction, that would be cool. Oh well, they‚Äôre still my favorite.
---
I only saw that type of texting from weebs. Might be wrong to accuse you, tough :)
---
(Also I didn‚Äôt actually downvote)
---
Well if they just make newer/better legendary effects and weapons then they won‚Äôt have to worry about rebalancing. I would assume this is Bethesda‚Äôs way of thinking
---
Why ? There dar better games put than 76
---
Should have done it Deadspin-style :) :
---
1. Morgantown
---
2. ...
---
3. Hitting hit by a bus
---
4. Flatwoods
---
this game is full of bugs and there's not much to do since I've done all the missions, but I can't stop playing. so yeah, I'm staying.
---
If you don‚Äôt want an alt, you could always store it as ammo or flux. May take a bit longer to liquify it but they hold their value.
---
You could also..  you know.. not join the group that gives free fast travel if you're so set on spending
---
Been playing with the same group for about a year.  From what I have observed, mobs tend  go after the highest level player first, any player attacking them second, and proximity 3rd.
---
The team is currently 228, 220, 215, and 110.  The 228 and the 215 are melee's, but depending on the area, may have ballistic weapons equipped.  
---
The 220 and 110 are gunners.  By and large, the 228 gets attacked first; the mob will will run past the lower levels to get to the 228.  If one of the other players attacks first, that individual critter will stick with whomever attacked.  If we are spread out (ex: out of rad sponge range), seems like they go to the closest player.
---
Bad luck. Check the Tyler county fairgrounds, there are three potential spawns for them
---
Smokeable cigars is one of my favorite mods for Fallout 4.  Would love the ability to craft cigarettes and cigars to sit there and take a drag instead of idling around waiting for team or event to happen.
---
Farm low level Scorched for their pipe weapons and scrap with Scrapper Perk.
---
Yup without the prerun challenges and the run done some of my air has been let out. Even gold grind has got to items I don't care much about without them putting in the rest of the SS limb mods.
---
You can't have your cake and sell it, too.
---
If only we could harvest baseball bats from 1980's major league baseball players...
---
I don‚Äôt think they are missing, the spawn locations are just a chance of spawning AFAIK.  I had trouble finding one last night, as did a couple of friends.  Best bet is to find a few locations and server hop while crossing fingers.
---
Morgantown airport, vault tec agricultural center are both good spots. If you have the perk that alerts you when they are nearby it helps
---
A chew stick of grass would be cool too.
---
somebody also mentioned Watoga with the cranberry bog. Running through the trenches.
---
I believe it follows the same rules as all containers... You need to loot "x" amount before previously looted containers respawn loot.
---
To add, two legendary weapons with the same base weapon and legendary effects are exactly the same, so once you have what you feel is perfect for your character, you have nothing more to look for. 
---
I picked up the unstoppable monster for my unarmed bloodied build.  What exactly am I looking for now for a better weapon?
---
Then why not compose the post in that way?
---
Fair enough. Like you said, you play most days. Not everyone can. Those who can't, would prefer things be more accessible to them. I don't know the demographics of FO76 but in most MMOs the majority of players only play a couple times a week. 
---
I liked how FFXIV did their tomes for gear. You had a weekly cap, the first time you did certain things each day you got a bonus, but you could keep doing the same things to reach cap. So it could be do two events and the first time you get 500 and each two completed after gives 250. The cap keeps people coming back as you can only advance so far each week but you can do it all in a day if you want. 
---
The same should be done for other limited currencies in my opinion. The more accessible the game, the more people play, the more content etc comes. This way you have to put in the same amount of time but can choose to play 7 days a week a bit or all day one day. As is, if you miss a day in FO76 you are permanently behind.
---
You can play with specific people/friends, yes.
---
I believe containers are in a count of 60 (not sure if it's 60 containers or 60 things from containers) similar to how open world stuff is on a 180 item counter
---
I had trouble finding it too but then ƒ± found one at wv lumber co
---
Everyone is gobbling them up
---
This is exactly what I did. I got 15 points in perception for my commando build but the last 3 I don't use so put on all 3 of the sound cards for magazines, bobble heads, and cap stashs. I find them all the time while doing my other challenges and events.
---
They are only for pa
---
The big pool at wavy willards or whatever, go to the locker room area in the corner and on one of the shelves in the lockers stands one.
---
I do agree with many of your points this community overall is sickeningly positive‚Äî towards Bethesda. They will not hesitate to bite your head off if you dare offer up constructive criticism. Though we have improved dramatically since most of the toxic diehard ‚Äútrue fans‚Äù have jumped ship. 
---
I feel the worst sentiment in the community has to be people asserting that this game will die if we don‚Äôt all buy atoms constantly. A relatively small amount of the player base keeps looking at $15 cosmetic bundles and a half assed premium service and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll buy this to keep the game alive, you all need to help.‚Äù What we should be doing is organizing to make it known what we are unhappy with and to boycott the atomic shop until they give in to our demands. There are still bugs in the game from launch, I still won‚Äôt play for the first few days of an update until I stop seeing posts of accounts being lost, end game content is still very lacking, they hardly ever listen to the community, and there are many many QOL updates we have been politely asking for. They have lost so much of my goodwill that I may never buy another Bethesda game again. 
---
Despite all my gripes I still feel this game has massive potential, and the in-game players I have met are some of the nicest people I have ever met.
---
You are an inspiration and a leader
---
I was thinking last night they should make a perk card that allows you to grow more plants. Maybe make it several so that you have to have all of them to be able to grow rhe more rare plants
---
If you have multiple collectrons unlocked, you can can set them to collect other collectron‚Äôs items.
---
Damn thats dissapointing, but thanks for the info
---
Its ok I fixed it. I had to server hop for like 20min .rush to the Medical bay and analyze it if it didnt work then I just server hopped again
---
somewhere like The Deep.
---
Thank you for this! You're the only person I've seen suggest this and it worked. I started a new character to try out a different build and I was so ticked by this bug.
---
&gt; you're saying that programmers at bethesda cant code their game
---
Have you looked at the hot mess? I don't have to say that, the game speaks for itself.
---
&gt;since modders did make workarounds for 21:9, before bethesda stole the mod?
---
You can run the game at any resolution you set it to, that does not mean the resolution is supported, and that brings in the modder who have gone an "fixed" somethings for the res that are not supported by the game.
---
Why are you so aggressive?
---
Did you even bother reading, and understanding, what I said?  
---
Or are you so dead set on saving 60 caps that you don‚Äôt care about the long term effects on the economy (which already need fixing)
---
Mutations don't have negative effects? And your whole argument is that buffing a build would render another build useless. So you still haven't really answered.
---
You on PC?
---
...where?
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt even know I could buy more than one, thanks!
---
thx I wasn't sure if it was on the same schedule as the other stuff or even if it needed to be unlocked there first or not :)
---
yw glad it worked
---
I do the ore run piece because I want the treasury notes for a successful event, but you DO miss a ton of XP and potential legendary weapons when you're the mule.
---
It‚Äôs frustrating that their doesn‚Äôt seem to be a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù mechanic like other RPG‚Äôs.
---
**Its fixed guys thanks for the help. The only way to fix this is to find a server where noone finished the Quest on the current server and then you can analyze the blood and replace the T-Fuse**
---
I have found that using the ‚Äúcome here‚Äù emote works. Whenever I see it pop up by a teammate‚Äôs name, I look at the map to see where they are and jump to them if it looks like they are alone. Same thing if I need help. Someone usually responds.
---
As a side note, roleplaying is also great for groups completing quests, Since higher CHA gives everyone on the team better cap rewards.  If 4 people do quests and everyone gets the caps, it more than offsets any fast travel costs.
---
Magazine display paint. Didn't pick it up before in the atom shop and have regretted it ever since.

It's from an old 50's cartoon.

---
Lol it has some pretty stiff mechanics though.
---
Try to analyze anyway. I didnt get my sample back, only the t fuse, but it did let me analyze. You might get lucky too.
---
Oh ok . That‚Äôs fine
---
Should be a +5 all SPECIAL meal
---
The containers are empty because they follow the spawn-rules and your containers haven't refreshed.
---
Bug or feature? I don't know and honestly don't care because the amount of ore from that event is so minuscule for the time spent.
---
If this is still an issue for you I'll be on in about 4 hours. You're welcome to do it in my private world.
---
And it will always be the last to heal in my experience, the RNG gods don't look favourably on me üò¢
---
This is a good point that I didnt really consider but I think it could still be done, since the leaders of the Free Radicals hang out in their own separate interior cell they could give out the Daily quests. That way only people who joined them can do those dailies or something
---
Let's just agree to disagree eh? Because I do in fact not care about the economy of a game, it's not wallstreet it is a game
---
I'm honestly happy for you if you're enjoying your time. I'm not gonna say I did not enjoy my time on FO76 because that would be a lie. You just have to understand why some people are quitting. I like this game but I've reach a point where the troubles the bugs are giving me are outshadowing the fun I'm having. I simply can't keep spending money on a game that is not even trying to fix theses things and is actually getting worst after each patch.
---
If things gets better, and I freaking hope they will, I'll come back and even re sub but as of now, that's a big no.
---
It's dumb when you think about it because there's many things in the games that aren't that enjoyable like all the dailies but I didn't mind because I wasn't forced to do any of these. The bugs, however, are forcing themself in each and every game session I had lately. I'm done with that.
---
They need to reduce the build size around the plants as well. I was planting crops just before and I can only fit 1 melon plant per tile but there is clearly room for 2 melon plants.

Sounds like the community is bi-polar. Super highs and extreme lows.

Throw on Percepti-bobble until you have found what you're looking for.

---
**Guys I fixed it all good :)**
---
How did I know if I checked your post history I would find a series of posts that are literally ideas that have already been submitted dozens of times before and questions you can find answers to either by searching this subreddit or the wiki or any number of resources about the game? How does that fit into this puzzle? Somehow you feel justified trolling the people doing the same thing you are? 
---
Fucking Reddit man.
---
I'm not leaving as I've cultivated a group of cool people to play with, bugs be damned. But I am definitely canceling 1st and taking breaks to play other games. I'll be damned if I'm gonna grind just so I can hand my loot over to a BOS groupie who's trying to suck a roadie's dick so that he can get back stage.
---
Dropped one last night thank u
---
Uh... yeah. Sorry for the spoiler!
---
Hello its ok I just fixed it like 5 mins ago thank you for trying to help :)
---
Hey, they brought the GnR plaza to Fallout 4, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs impossible for them to have a Pitt style add on in the future. No matter how far that future may be. Would be cool to see
---
That Mid Century wood paneling wallpaper
---
It would be great if MODUS sold specific Mutation Cures for like 3000C
---
i want the vault tec stairs to come back. Actually i just want wide stairs in general.
---
&gt;until they give in to our demands
---
Part of the problem is that for some of those demands, we can‚Äôt all come to a consensus on what they are.  yes bugs need to be fixed, and yes we need more content, but we have people coming on here and sometimes asking for the dumbest of things to be added to the game and they get upvoted.  These are people who think they have a great idea but no one looks at the bigger picture or has an understanding or even tries to understand how that change might impact the game as a whole.
---
Used their help last night when I launched a nuke to help me level up for SCORE. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have ever launched a nuke in the game if it weren‚Äôt for them.
---
No idea how you launch it the other way.
---
What's it called specifically?
---
Try lost home
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here\_is\_why\_lost\_home\_is\_the\_bomb\_yo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/)
---
This is one of my top five favorite events and I have never found it to be broken. Does it follow the rules of needing to loot X amount of other containers in between participating in it again? Probably.
---
I find it to be a very similar event to the Lode Baring one. (My favorite event.) There, you can mine ore while helping keep the miner bots in good repair. The ore is always visible every time you do the event, but if you‚Äôve mined that particular ore spot recently, clicking will do nothing.
---
And while speaking on Lode Baring: It only has happened rarely, but sometimes I‚Äôll start the event, go into the mine, and find the rubble within is blocking the path. So you can‚Äôt do the event. I‚Äôve seen others in that small space with me, so it appears in those cases, it‚Äôs broken for everyone. (Fast traveling away and then back again doesn‚Äôt fix the problem.)
---
You can make nuka-cola grenades which do a lot of damage.
---
&gt;I saw a post where Bethesda basically said The Fixer is a skin for the Combat Rifle, so prob wont get any other skins for that one
---
Yep, my camp is right at Grafton Dam so I can walk out my front door and kill low level Scorched at the high school, then run over to the airport, then over to the seafood restaurant, then to the train yard. Probably 2-3 dozen Scorched, half wielding pipe weapons.
---
I agree with the level thing. 330 something here and the SBQ targets me mostly when I'm the highest level there.
---
I would like a collectron that doesn't talk. Theres only so many "Eureka! I hit solid mold." lines i can take. Thats why i removed him from my camp.
---
While many of the reactions on this subreddit are warranted too many come across as very immature and toxic. 
---
Take some of the recent drama over the latest patch. While I do agree with the base sentiment, I did find the reactions themselves to be toxic, entitled, and emotionally irrational. Ironically, very "Karen-like" tantrums where someone regresses to the behavior of a screaming toddler.
---
Then, once the dust begins to settle, the same crowd is easily manipulated with "virtual pacifiers" in the form of Atom Shop items or lip-service from Bethesda. Suddenly the toddler is placated until the next tantrum when the cycle continues.
---
yeah I am sure there are a lot of people that would use an armor that only buffed strength and endurance, perception and agility, etc if it only buffed those more than unyielding buffs everything.
---
Yeah, those dupers with their illicit

---
I have never seen an animation from tenderizer
---
you know a game is bad when it causes stockholm syndrome. but really, people like me, whom declare they are leaving, arent doing it to spite you or other players, but Bethesda. we're basically saying that Bethesda shipped a terrible product and we arent going to keep supporting that display of minimum effort. they sell the game, has microtransactions and there is a monthly service. for a game where cant even get interior walls. they gave us a half-baked game but want full blown money. i bought the game and even had fo1st for a month, just to give a fair shake. keep in mind, fo76 is made from fo4 assets (seriously, going back to play fo4 was some straight deja vu), so its not even like a whole new game, because was going to be a feature *of* fo4. so were all paying full game price for what shouldve been dlc at most. and its so obvious how indifferent Zeni/Bethy is about fo76. we "leave" because if you dont make a stand, were going to keep getting games like fo76. as long as we keep *paying*, Zenimax has no reason to change. but you know, "fun". *its only game, why you [heff](https://youtu.be/xzpndHtdl9A) to be mad?*
---
Ironic that you expect people to care that you‚Äôre staying
---
Weaponized nuka-cola ammo. Its a brown bottle with duct tape saying boom. It's ammo for a gun in fallout 4
---
Yeah it‚Äôs been closed for business since patch 20. Not intentionally. Hopefully it‚Äôs opened up again patch 21.
---
Grain silo and the other farm stuff.
---
Instigating riflemen still one hit everything in the game but queens , not sure why people are so focused on ‚Äúbest‚Äù so much when other options are completely viable and don‚Äôt require intensive maintenance or being 90% dead 100% of the time
---
Oh, that‚Äôs nice since vats exits for me to reload, I used an AA/25 and the normal shots hit for 10, but I kept getting crits for 50 so I easy got my damage in
---
While i was doing the challenge I shared the perk in the public team as well.
---
Ive only got one so probably just going to display it but cheers for an answer
---
I place mine on the roof of my camp and it causes him to teleport to the ground where he somehow gets stuck under a tree by a nearby cliff, well out of earshot.
---
Imagine dual Deathclaw Gauntlets. One Junkies Faster Swingspeed and Bloodied on the other. One fist of iron the other of steel! if the left one dont getcha then the right one will!
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Weaponized_Nuka-Cola_ammo it's that
---
Abandoned bog town, go to the roof and fall through the  elevator shaft, typewriters and desk fans for days.
---
Because when people post how-tos on YouTube for the exploits, some even explain how they believe it works. They're basically giving Bethesda a "here's specifically what's broken" video.
---
As well, an exploit can ruin the experience for everyone playing, even those not use using it and affects the way the game is meant to be enjoyed. A bug or glitch could only affect a smaller group, or be a less substantial affect on the gameplay.
---
You also need the learn the plans to make them into grenades. 
---
Also when you do the main quest for Wastelanders, you‚Äôll learn to make them into a vaccination. 
---
Tip: choose it‚Äôs got my blood in it
---
Its pretty awesome, instead of the low green glow from my pip-boy it acts as if I am wearing a miner helmet or power armor with bright light mod
---
It doesn't have an animation...
---
It deals more damage when you start hitting something, as the perk text says.
---
Yeah, I'm gonna have to disagree with ya here.
---
I'm very casual, but I have been loggin in every day for a couple hours to do dailies. I manage to get roughly 1.5 to 2 lvls a day, and I will probably finish in the next 9 days(still have 18 lvls to go).
---
If I had been hit with the autocomplete bug I probably wouldn't have a chance to finish without buying lvls. I also don't believe I could finish if I hadn't made a point of getting on every day.
---
tldr...casuals absolutely have to login every day to reach 100 based off my experiences.
---
Anything that will cost them potential money will always be a priority. Also a lot of bugs are just probably going to be there due to the limitations of the engine.
---
I‚Äôm staying. This is my staying comment.
---
But of course - there's always whining, even if it works correctly.
---
You do. It‚Äôs called make a new one.
---
Oh that. It isn't in FO76 so I was confused.
---
I've done all those missions, I'm level 180 bit can't find anything about this thing in fallout 76 only fallout 4. The only other page I can find on it thinks it's a dev room item.
---
From regular runs there for steel, etc., I've noticed that the legendary spawn rates for WT seem to have been reduced after the BP dropped.
---
So the answer to the question is, yes, you care more about saving 60 caps than the long term effect on the game. 
---
You don‚Äôt care that the overflow of caps in this game with no sinks is the reason that good gear is priced so out of range of poorer players, which is the only reason you need to save the 60 caps for anyways.
---
You don‚Äôt care that you reach a point in the game where there is literally nothing to spend your caps on, because everything you want is either flat out trade or purchased with scrip or gold.
---
You don‚Äôt care about the longevity of the game, you just care about the here and now.
---
You just want your 60 caps.
---
I'm so sick of that noise in Uranium Fever I just sit up top on the map at the mine and get the auto complete. Those level 30 weapons are not worth my ears anymore. Plus I got that full package of clothing/masks twice now doing that.
---
It‚Äôs a MK19, kinda totally pisses me off they didn‚Äôt just call it what it is.
---
But you can only have 1 built in your camp.
---
Dude, you are not casual at all....
---
I've got a bottle of it.... In fallout 76
---
Q:  Do you have FO1st?  Have you cancelled it over these issues?  If you don't stop paying, Bethesda doesn't get the message
---
I would love it if legendary creatures were given a different set of defensive stats similar to the SBQ, where they are all much tankier and hit alot harder.
---
Will have less whining about people 1 shotting them then, and make for more interesting bursts of excitement when one shows up turning the tide of the fight.
---
Must be mistaken another animation for it then thanks
---
Xbox :( but thank you for the offer!! I fucking love the FO community. Everytime I turn around someone is helping me, or I see high level people hanging with below level 10 helping them. A lot of other games have so many toxic players, I love seeing how many people just get together to enjoy this game as a community.
---
 I have been lucky, and have had a number of people give me a ton of misc plans, maps etc. I am doing my best to pay it back by catching new players as they come out of the vault.
---
Because exploits are something that affect everyone's games, whereas bugs are significantly more isolated. I have never encountered about 90% of the bugs mentioned on this subreddit.
---
It's easier to rewrite code that affects 100% of the uses.
---
We need a HUD that shows all active effects with countdown.
---
Sound good to me would help a lot.
---
Likely hacked or gltiched from the dev room
---
It makes sense though, as casual players are unlikely to spend the time scrolling through this subreddit. The people who post are most likely veteran players or players who simply dislike the game.
---
Magic shotgun - the +50% limb dmg is broken right now in Vats. You‚Äôll do insane dmg.
---
I agree the camp budget should be higher but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs tiny. I‚Äôve made a whole town with budget to spare
---
Xbox player?
---
I have lots of great 2H melee for trade/sale
---
They put out a hotfix on Monday to fix the Smiley's Gold glitch....yet they can't enable the SS Mods which are already in the code &amp; just need to be turned on?
---
Yeah, explain that one.
---
You speak the truth
---
I get your point, but they've done this for the vast amount of weapons in the game. Handmade Rifle, assault rifle, .50 cal machine gun, lever action rifle, etc.
---
They aren‚Äôt quick to fix exploits, they are quick to fix exploits that are quick to fix.  
---
How long has the munitions factory been blue printable and placable in camps? How long did it take for them to get rid of the god mode bug?  Why hasn‚Äôt the explosive bait exploit been fixed yet?
---
Do people usually carry that amount of weapons? I normally carry just my Fixer, a shotgun and some grenades. I'm a lvl 73.
---
This! The raiders and other NPCs have hairstyles that we can't use! They are in the game, just release them to us.
---
Community involvement. It's fun to see so many people come together and complete event.
---
[Charisma 12+] Your excellent arguing skills has suddenly made me care, thank you kind stranger for opening my eyes to the inevitable doom of our beloved game economy.
---
I treat Building as a standard go to, events teams need to be trolling events all the time to be worthwhile, grinding xp for levels and score challenges kinda excludes the other stat increase ones which i'm sure are fun and useful for other players just not for me.  
---
Building means I can get on with my daily grind without having to rush round doing grind to keep doing more grind (for ammo/repairs) to do the grind I need to do to earn the xp, whilst still having to do all the grind for score, that the grind i'm doing is preventing me from grind-ing for.   
---
Building is a win win lol....
---
Tinder?
---
But seriously, the LFG on Xbox is decent, though beware, there are a number of scammer and griefer groups on there as well.
---
I¬¥m taking a break atm, but coming back again. Thats for sure!
---
Happy days. I love rare items haha
---
Yep, especially people in high enemy spawn areas.
---
This. Would have gotten it when it was available if I had known the contemporary house set was going to be a thing.
---
It's likely a copyright issue
---
I think I probably carry more than most, but I enjoy the variety. I'm level 160ish, not sure if that changes things much
---
I really wasn‚Äôt trying to offend you. I was just trying answer your question.
---
Took me 2 and a half hrs using private and public servers to find one last night (also using guides). Bethesda, get rid of the bobblehead daily.....it‚Äôs ridiculous.  If anything make it a weekly.
---
The build has alot to do with it. So many ways to stack damage between perks and gear. I dont have the best gear in game by far but my stealth bloodied sniper can 1 shot most enemies even legendaries pretty easy.
---
They would have to license the name from General Dynamics. Same reason an M16 is called a service rifle in New Vegas.
---
This is not true for magazines, definitely not.  The bobbles at Sons of Dane are not always they same two an one or both or  either could spawn at all. 
---
There's a fixed set of spawn points,  but whether it's a magazine or a bobble is the only fixed thing about the location. if a magazine (bobble) does spawn, it's type does not change, but is chosen from a list of all mags/bobs.
---
I've been so busy with school work and working full time that I haven't had a chance to play like I used to. Then I had internet issues and life generally sucked for a while. I found comfort in building up my camp to look like my dream home. Then I would go and do some events and kill some ghouls and super mutants and just generally, BE. I love this game. With all its glitches and horrible quests and monsters, I enjoy the time i spend playing because it takes me outside of myself for a while. 
---
I don't expect anyone to love the game or tell me why its sucks because trust me, I know it does. But I'm gonna enjoy it while I can. ‚ù§
---
I've had the opposite happen to me: I join and event, don't get a single hit on the legendary, roll up to it and nab a nocturnal pipe pistol.
---
True but it requires low hp and while it reduces 50% damage
---
Dev room.
---
If you weren‚Äôt even going to be willing to listen to opposing thoughts, why did you reply to my post in the first place?  Did you just want to hear yourself talk and hopefully get some upvotes for ‚Äúputting me in my place?‚Äù
---
My wife and I hunted the Wendigo Colossus for over a week. Nuked the areas that websites said had the best chance of spawning it, no luck. Probably launched twenty nukes trying to get that darned thing to spawn.
---
Encountered it in the cranberry forest just west of the SBQ event. We had just left Scorched Earth and were not looking for it, we were just farming flux that evening. Scared the ever living daylights out of us when it charged from behind an orange cloud of radioactive pollen.
---
Good times.
---
7,777 caps.
---
Just north of Tyler County Fairgrounds there are two barns, a wood pile resource node, and a small fenced in garden you can build at.  Great location!  If you see the big water tower nearby you are at the right place.  Its right along the road leading to the lumber mill.
---
Is it basically just the Furious prefix in perk card form then? Sounds powerful if so...
---
That will go into my trading pile then haha, hopefully worth a few caps
---
On a side note, the free states jet pack can be applied to most (all?) PA whether you know the plan for the jet pack or not. I was able to put it on my T65 without buying the jetpack plan for bullion.
---
No luck yet, I did find out that the prefab only needs to be planted at the staircase of the nest..I was able to get it anchored in a small piece of dirt on top of the red rocket mega stop. I think the only possible option then is maybe the campfire anchoring at that one specific point, though this might have been patched, the other possible option is trying to use a rug but making sure it is at this anchor point. Maybe all prefabs have an anchor point?
---
While I have not made a post about leaving, I gotta say I'm bored. During the last double XP weekend, I made a new character, and he already has gone through all the story content and can one-shot almost anything now. I find myself just logging in to do the dailies for Score, but after I hit 100, I think I'm going to be taking a break for a while. I hope to one day return and have some enjoyable content to play that is more than continuously grinding one event for a 0.03% chance to get a drop of something that I will put in my stash that doesn't even have room for it.
---
I couldn't either. Sadly, I had to just skip that part and go straight to Meg instead. Ugh.
---
That's why you nuke Morgantown instead. Early missions take players there a lot, and it's just outside the safe zone.
---
The scorched like to leave legos hidden in the grass, when you hear the grunt and see the blood splatter, your character has found one. But in the spirit of not being too realistic and ruining your gaming experience, it doesn't kill you on the spot.
---
I think the last patch even helped you get rid of Munitions Factories that were in your CAMP and destroyed.
---
No shit ! Finally an explanation ! Thank you
---
No problem. I am actually LOOKING for other commies
---
And for mod reasons, this is a joke.
---
Fallout 76 has bugs. Some of them worse than others. But I don‚Äôt think anyone who has played the entire time can call it a ‚Äòshitshow‚Äô if they‚Äôre being honest.

Of course it is...because no self-respecting Member would be using anything other than MODUS-sanctioned plasma weapons.
---
Dev room item, not saying you could get a ban but you might want to consider dropping it. There are some people that purposely give away dev room items to others, it's difficult to say if they're just being nice or if they want to get others banned. No tinfoil hat there, just a possibility...
---
The raiders rep has an armco ammo factory when max rep. It is slower than this one, Can only build 1 and im gonna assume only at your camp
---
i'm not quitting im just taking a break. burnt out on the legendary run grind
---
Not really. You deal 5-7% more damage for 5-10 seconds after you start attacking the enemy. Furious is adding more damage the more you hit them..
---
Thank you for your post. I want to play Vanguard Rifleman but it is nothing to the Bloody Unyielding Any weapon builds. Nothing. BadCompanySarge on Youtube recently offered sound solutions to shift the Meta. AngryTurtle on livestream said "I've tried to run full health builds but they make no sense when Bloody is this powerful." There's Adrenal Reaction, Nerd Rage, Serendipity plus too much Special boosts with Uny making you a virtual god. And the downside? Maybe dying. Maybe losing Junk. Rarely. And more importantly, Meh. So yes even the Devs at Quakecon were running Bloody. I love Fallout 76 but I want to love it more. It'd be nice if it loved me too.
---
Do not think I forgot about legacy Gatling plasmas
---
100%. It's ludicrous to me that crops use any CAMP budget at all.
---
Not to worry, there will be about a 100 posts on here when it does finally show up.
---
Huh. I just recently went to a shop the other day and bought a ton of Nuka Cola. As a terribly reckless grenader, I love my Nuka Grenades.
---
They do. If you looked at the quakecon colossal event panel, literally all the devs were using bloodied lol. And it carried them through, they barely managed to beat the event. I guarantee you they would have failed it with any other build
---
Before this, I absolutely was. 
---
Before the run started, I might play for 4 hours a week, but met some chill dudes on the first week of the run to play with and it has encouraged me to try and see how far I could get while enjoying some derping around time with my teammates.
---
If you are saying I haven't been casual for the last 3 weeks, then I guess I would agree but it goes against my normal mode of play.
---
The Legendary Crafting System should allow us to build legendary versions of existing weapons - for example:
---
Take a Level 45 regular handmade &amp; modify it with 1, 2 or 3 legendary modules (for a 1, 2 or 3 star weapon) - the results would still be random, based on the currently available primary, &amp; secondary &amp; tertiary attributes, but it would give us a lot more flexibility in what we could try to get.
---
Ok cheers, misread your post slightly.
---
Welcome to the im grouped with people but basically still solo game. Ive been trying to find people to play with for weeks on pc and cant. Ive tried multiple discords. In game hardly no one chats that I've found. No text chat. I even got the mod on pc for text chat, ask for groups no one answers. Oh well.
---
I listened, but I still disagree. Seems to me like you're the one trying to put me in my place, so set on the way you're thinking is the only right option. You couldn't agree to disagree, so here we are at a forever stalemate. Take care wastelander hope you can make it rain someday.
---
Because junkie's is already basically free. The negative effects are completely nothing compared to something like berserker's or XXXXX slayer. The only time junkie's is anything other than a minor inconvenience is if you are running a melee build. Mutant's is even easier than junkie's, you have very little reason NOT to run mutations because the benefits greatly outweigh the downsides. If anything, an anti-mutation effect that rewards you for not having any mutations should be up in that tier
---
That's cool! Will have to keep an eye out for it, cheers.

Unless they build in whitesprings I let them suffer. Mostly because I stumbled on what seemed like a perfect area at level 23 this well preserved golf course and friendly bots all around that took out the one enemy that was there. 2 hours after finishing my build the bots are all dead and a snallygaster is decimating my place and me. Too many bad memories. I think I need psychological counselling and lots of fun pharmecuticals.
---
The only downside is that it is in the far Northwest portion of the map.  It gets kinda spendy fast traveling. But if caps are no issue for you its a primo spot!  Good luck!
---
Yup, it should be free.  You're already sacrificing the build space in the CAMP bubble, so why should it also eat budget?
---
Always something to do and new content, who want to continuing playing other fallout game when you know everything ? Except for modding if you can and like that.
---
No problem. I use one rank of it, it's a good boost in damage for one point of perk.
---
4 hours a week is casual, 2 hours per Day each Day without missing is not casual. Good luck reaching 100 with 4 hours week
---
I think there some jarred scorched body parts in Morgantown airport.
---
The goul officers with beeping radios on their backs drop fragments of codes so i think we have to kill several per nuke.
---
Yes...The meat piles seem to be shifting nearly 10/15 feet away from where I killed them. I soloed one violent night and he fell about 3 feet before the juke, but his meatpile was outside still 2 feet away on the exact opposite side of the juke.
---
like i said, just have them pop up here and there.  not talking a full army.  just have them be like glowing ones.
---
Give us step by step instructions on how NOT to cancel Fallout 1st.
---
You didn‚Äôt give an opposition thought. You didn‚Äôt give any reasons to say that fast travel should be free. You didn‚Äôt give any explanation on how it would benefit the the game.  
---
You jumped into a discussion trying to say a couple of things witty by putting the issue on me and when I pushed back you backed off with a cowardly ‚Äúagree to disagree‚Äù.  You didn‚Äôt give a side of the argument for me to agree to disagree with.  
---
You should go back to playing single player games.
---
When comparing both at max settings I'd say FO76 has some nice improvements visually if you don't take mods into consideration, because if you do FO4 looks way better and has loaaads more options
---
I bet this changes their mind.
---
i gathered that, is it JUST that clothing item, or are all clothing items affected?
---
Might help if you put which PA you want it for, what system you're on, and put this in trade subreddit.
---
I know it won't but still, one can hope if enough people say something. Unlikely, but one can hope.
---
have you looked at how big the mole miner gauntlet looks on a normal fleshy person?  the damn thing is already scaled for power armor.
---
I got up to about 50 and just bought the remaining levels.  The dailies need more variety to the challenges.  buy or sell X amount from player vendors should not be on the dailies every single day.  The gain one level should be a repeatable weekly like the gain 10000 XP weekly
---
It deals more damage per kill.
---
I tried using third person and it mostly fixed it, thanks  a lot!
---
Just the one. There was a way to get more screws back if super duper kicked in. So they fixed that clothing piece.
---
There's a Facebook group dedicated to Nuclear Winter, with over 1,000 members! You might have some luck here:

---
Do you happen to have the jack o lantern rack?
---
I was you, about to turn it off, had enough grinding repetition, like Pavlov‚Äôs Dog earning a treat.
---
Then I bumped into a user, he annoyed me, shakey head at me through an event. I was in a bad mood, I jumped to his camp ready to blow shit up, I was done with the game anyway. 
---
Then I saw his camp. Wow, it was amazing, so I messaged him. He jumped straight to his camp and proceeded to show me his secrets (his companion showed me her dragon, but that‚Äôs another story). I was inspired. He travelled to my camp &amp; gave me great advice on where my Camp budget was going. The next day (it was past my bedtime by then) I flattened my camp &amp; started fresh, haven‚Äôt put the game down all week.
---
Sometimes inspiration comes from unlikely sources.
---
Cheers, I use a two shot auto grenade launcher as well.  I always tag the queen in vats a couple times on her bombing runs.
---
WOW. Who pissed in your Cornflakes this morning? Go on admit it you got fooked over by RNG and got one-star legendary Rolling pin and got all pissy about it because the game crashed just after your end game god roll üòù
---
That's very thoughtful, good idea.
---
I took about a year off and this post is first time I've heard about possibility of new maps, which were uncovered?
---
I mean my characters pretty much always wear BoS stuff anyway, so I'm down.
---
I play the game with a very heavy RP slant.
---
My character is a stealth range build.
---
If I find a large group of mobs or a legendary I can‚Äôt take on my own I slink away.
---
If I get ammo I don‚Äôt have a gun for, I will try to sell it, or throw it away.
---
If my inventory/stash gets full I manage it and usually try not to hang onto anything that is ‚Äúunnecessary.‚Äù
---
Not that my way is better or worse than anyone else‚Äôs, but I‚Äôve found that I don‚Äôt have the same frustrations as I see on this forum.  I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen the fast travel bug, but only because I rarely use that function.
---
I really enjoy immersing myself in the environment and exploration of the game.
---
I‚Äôm not going away any time soon.
---
Everyone already has those mutations though.  Look at it this way.  I have a character with junkies weapons and mutations.  Now suddenly mutants does exactly what my junkies weapons do BUT i can also lose all my junkies negatives and just have my mutation negatives.  No one would use junkies again.
---
Honestly, the best way to handle mutants is to give 5% for each mutation up to a cap of 25% while also buffing the armor stack more by giving 15 dr/er per Mutants piece instead of 10.  Good middle ground between vanguards and bolstering imo.
---
I'm pretty sure most weightless armor types will weigh 0 with the ultralight mod added. It might be just the light versions though. I started collecting weightless armor with +special stats right before wastlelanders dropped. I'd just pop on whatever I needed to pass a conversation check.
---
Appreciate! But i don't use Facebook üò∞.
---
No i think i am going to stay in my black cowboy hat and swat outfit f4om fo1st
---
I've already been doing this ever since I got the BOS bomber jacket and BOS T-60 paints.
---
I use two frames to block doors in feed the people. Players can pass through them but ghouls can't.
---
&gt; When you leave vault everything is shiny and crisp. 300 hours later it's all jumpy and blocky and server runs like shit during sbq. Sort it out Bethesda.
---
This isn't entirely false. The real issue is that the game is horribly, almost criminally inefficient. It can't handle large amounts of anything. Usually it can more or less hold itself together, but sometimes a bug intensifies it and makes some things more or less unusable. 
---
Look at the current bug with corpses/meat piles, having too many nearby tanks your frames on even the strongest PC. This is only slightly worse than it normally is. Look at your stash or vendor when you have many unique items (like a collection of outfits) - it's barely possible to use. I myself collect interesting legendary rolls and have somewhere around 80 weapons on me. When using a weapon workbench, my game drops to 6 fps. That's not an exaggeration, I use the steam overlay to display it. 110 fps running around my camp, sit down at a weapons workbench, drops down to 6.
---
It's the reason why we aren't getting more stash space, or more camp budget, or more character slots, or more players on servers, or anything else. The game literally can't handle it. They can make things a *little* more efficient, and they've been optimizing it from update to update, but too many of the core issues lie with how clunky the engine is.
---
So yes, the game does run smoother on a new character. When your inventory is empty, when your stash is empty, when you don't have too many players/enemies loaded into your nearby area, the game runs much better. And it only goes downhill from there
---
I don't ever make much of an effort for the wendigo. the xp and loot from the ghouls/event is more beneficial.
---
I cant even go near the place.. I get like 3fps in that event...
---
&gt; If anything, an anti-mutation effect that rewards you for not having any mutations should be up in that tier
---
And that's exactly what they should change stalkers to.  25 to 35% damage buff while under no addictions, mutations, or diseases.
---
The main market sub won't let you trade it. Fyi.
---
Level 40-100 is the peak FO76 experience. Funnest and most addicted I‚Äôve been to any game.
---
did they smash that new "sorry" emote?  /s
---
Because apparently, parroting "fortnite clone" is still funny after all these years
---
I wanted to stay so badly, but the 800 Lb inventory cap made going from FO4 to 76 just too much for me. That, and the abysmal support for 32:9 monitors. A ton of other AAA games I've played work great on such a monitor, but FO76 refuses to cooperate with such. I've tried mods, messing with the config files, and running at different resolutions, but it still didn't work. I was so hype to get a really nice FO experience, but I personally was dissapointed. 
---
This isn't to say that I think the game is bad, just different than other FO games. If you like it, that's all the better! It just didn't fit my use case and that's okay! :)
---
Now if FO6 or whatever is released and fixes my two downsides, then I'm all for it! I personally can't wait to see what the big 'ol B has in store for us next!
---
Ave, True to Caesar... we are watching you...
---
Thank you.
---
If you are in close vicinity when your teammate kills a legendary or any enemy...you also get the loot. üòä
---
No thanks I only play one character.
---
its a build and gear thing
---
Yeah team members share the loot
---
Wasn't it November, now? :(
---
They rushed the event playing an instrument as well as the jukebox, not many ghouls being only the two of us.
---
If you are on their team and you are close enough to them you can loot the enemies they kill.
---
Bloodied is generally the answer to other peoples damage being so high.
---
Fixer, Bear Arm, Bow, Compound Bow, Sheepsquatch Staff, and any Plan you buy with Gold Bullion.
---
Yeah you must know the plans first
---
Yes, team members share kill loot. Another reason why I love the team feature.
---
Which is why I am conflicted. I'm interested in Starfield but the old shitty bugfest of an engine is such a huge turn off. I might get it a year or so down the road when the usual has happened: modders fixing Beths crap.
---
Nope just fast travelled away they had achieved their goal.
---
Frame rate go bye bye
---
I'm sure I have all of them except the empty rack. I also have the glowing pumpkins along with the normal ones! You can come check my camp for a wee look if you want!
---
Bloodied plus sneak damage and the adrenaline perk.
---
Yeah this is annoying but just be careful.  A few days ago, I was at the event with a few others on the server.  Someone one-shot the wendigo and I did not get a hit.   No big deal to me I did not need anything from it even though the loot would've been nice.
---
Well 3 people at the event assumed it was me that one shot it and started doing angry emotes at me and sending me xbox messages, a couple of them quite hateful.  I explained to them that it wasn't me and they should clip the fight if they don't believe me and eventually got them to back down but I was the victim of an angry mob attack just because I happened to be there and they decided I was the perpetrator.  Eventually I was able to convince them that it was not me but it was still not a pleasant experience.
---
While it sucks to lose out on loot, it's better to just develop a mentality of "meh" and move on from it when this happens.  You can't control the behavior of others and it'll make your game experience a lot better if you don't let it affect you as much.  Just do your part to play nice with others.  That's all you can do.  Until they change the loot system at events for legendary enemies this will always be an issue.
---
I guess it's a good thing I've kept my dress.
---
there are companies that actually give you something in return for your monthly subscription you know. Even ESO rewards players with a massive amount of content. FO76 does nothing compared to ESO or any other game. Idk how two departments owned by the same people have such a huge disconnect but it‚Äôs sad
---
It's my way to store unlimited 3\* armor pieces.
---
Imagine wanting a video **game** to be fun...
---
Then how about a rice paddy type of foundation (dirt foundation with a inch or two of water) so you can plant cranberries and other plants that need water or boggy conditions?
---
Red shag carpeting. It's in the store even more rarely than the Whitespring flooring.
---
That Place Is always full of radstags fighting other creatures
---
I can't find the original post, but I found [the album](https://imgur.com/a/bmTY01f). This was first posted long before the morgantown map came out, and that's the only one that came out since then
---
Pumpkins and gourds!  Why the hell is it so hard to find a gourd?
---
I agree it‚Äôs definitely stagnant . I enjoyed farming atoms more then the lengendary run.  I like the concept but after you complete it there‚Äôs a big ss lull
---
3. Being hit by a bus
---
4. Being passive on a team rape
---
5. Flatwoods
---
IMO, the game needs a rebalancing patch. No looter shooter, having such little content routinely added, goes this long without a meta change. NPCs need buffs, Queen needs a wipe mechanic, Bloodied needs a nerf, AND targeted loot needs to be introduced to the game to combat this God awful RNG, giving players a viable method to explore new builds. A stale sandbox is worse than the lackluster content drops. Small content drops are sufficient if you are always chasing new ways to play the game. But having bad RNG, combined with a stale sandbox, and drip feed content makes a game boring AF to play after a point.
---
THIS IS MY FIGHT SONG! TAKE BACK MY LIFE SONG!
---
Here's how I think the public team bonuses should have been laid out.¬†
---
Hunting - Bonus scrip each time you kill a legendary. This would ultimately give you more legendaries for killing legendaries, which is exactly the reward people who are hunting legendaries would want.¬†
---
Roleplay - Everyone around you receives a buff when you use an emote. This would encourage them to be social with each other and other players they meet. (I honestly couldn't think of any other way to reward/encourage roleplaying)¬†
---
Events - Keep it as is, it encourages people to chase events, as its name suggests.
---
Exploration - Junk weight decrease and a chance to receive bonus loot from containers. Gives people bonuses that would help with generic exploration.¬†
---
Building - Decreased building costs, bonus exp for claiming workshops. I mean intelligence has nothing to do with building, this is much more straight to the point.¬†
---
Casual - An idiot savant like bonus, giving you more exp randomly. Yes I know this would make it the new "best" option, but it makes sense to join the casual group when you don't specifically want to do any of the others. Casual SHOULD be the most common group, because let's face it most people use the public groups fairly casually as is.¬†
---
Yes. This ^ ^
---
The new reduced time limit makes this event far less worth it these days anyway. That wendigo has always given me the worst drops of any legendary event, by far.
---
I think the problem is that the wendigo in this event is pretty weak. Some friend of mine will one-shot it , no matter if its full life or not.
---
He cant do anything against it but wait until others tagged it. By that time the wendigo is already dead most of the times.
---
Shared loot for all people who contribute to the event or much more hp for the legendarys is the way to adress this problem imo.
---
The players are not (always) the problem.
---
did you try to invite them to group, they may have just wanted the event to end to get the rewards from it.
---
Yep. Took me forever myself. Congrats!
---
*Though I must ask, have you dined in Power Armor?*
---
Bloodied weapons for one. Adrenal mutation is the big one, if you keep your health low. then add on perks like Nerd Rage in Intelligence, all the perk ranks of whatever weapon type you are using, and Bloody Mess.
---
Use Chems like Psycho or Overdrive, Bobbleheads, Alcohol(ballistic bock, or high voltage hefe) to boost your damage even more for a short time.
---
It happens when switching guns.  This has happened to me with BP rifle before.
---
Build, gear, mutations, buffs
---
Nice, appreciate ya diggin that up
---
Same here, not sure whats that about. I dont know what the dailies are nor what the weeklies are, I just play the game in a way I find fun and I'm sitting at rank 78-79, not sure. I dont care about any of the rewards in particular, its always a pleasant surprise when I get 150 atoms from it though.
---
I‚Äôll add you! my ign is shoooops
---
Buff bows
---
I have NEVER gotten drops off of the imposter sheepsquatch after 10 or 12 Encryptids. I've only actually seen the thing alive once.
---
I gave up on it, the fact that it was released before any actual content put a sour taste in my mouth
---
This post makes me happy. Hearing "ConGrats bEthesDA, yoU juSt lost aNOTher FO1st subscription" has gotten beyond annoying
---
There was recently a bug where Smiley would sell unlimited gold bullion, that was fixed in a day.
---
If you don't use screws much it can feel like your swimming in them. 
---
But if you happen to use a weapon that breaks a lot and requires screws for the upkeep, screws are suddenly nowhere to be found.
---
Got a half decent super sledge. Double damage if full health, 50% something maybe reflect damage, and something about power attack I think. Xbox, message if interested
---
I‚Äôve been having lots of problems the last few days. It‚Äôs currently taken around 10 mins just trying to fast travel to a location lol
---
I once had a magical SBQ fight where 20 rounds loaded like this without needing a reload. Every time I hit zero, 20 more would load without the reload animation. I got a little. . .overzealous and fired semi-automatic without paying attention to the condition of the weapon and I lost the magic ability when it broke.
---
Oh my god that would be awesome! Let me know when you are on!
---
Everybody is picking them up, same with the scrap 3 power armor pieces every location was looted in every server I joined.
---
Remember when Bethesda said there would be multiple factions with actual choices? Pepperidge farm remembers
---
That's why they built them at workshops. It hardly puts a dent in workshop budgets. The southern  (I forget it's name) airport is the place I see it done the most. I've seen 75+ of them running at one time. I almost think they haven't fixed this to ruin ammo being used as currency.
---
I use an instigating lever action myself. It will sneak one shot almost every enemy in the game, aside from large enemies. Ghouls, mutants, npcs, most animals. A high level deathclaw is only a few shots.
---
‚ÄúJust can‚Äôt shake these nightmares... floating around in space forever...‚Äù
---
the respawn time needs to be better
---
I hear ya. Every time I do this one, I stand inside the building and shoot the floor to give others chance to hit. There's always that 1 guy, who stands outside the barn, on the roof, because he wants to one shot everything. This person cannot be  bothered enough to wait inside for mobs to run to the jukebox and tag them, along with everyone else. 
---
This person is the elite, of the elite, he has no time for your shenanigans, and he wants you to know it.
---
Hopefully the patch for One Wasteland resolves this issue. Right now, very few events drop max level legendary items, and it's a shame when those get one shot. The best thing i can advise you to do, is get a quick fire weapon with explosive, just for tagging at events.
---
No, PS4.
---
I doubt it. Bethesda probably already forgot about the free radicals
---
I enjoy the world, the ambiance, the lore. It doesn't matter that I've played since launch and am only level 30 on 1 character (started over with Wastelanders and Steam launch) and haven't seen half the map. I haven't killed SBQ. I've never been in power armor yet. I have a few hours to play a week if that anymore (dad life).
---
Fallout is my favorite IP of all time. I'm staying indefinitely.
---
There is no targeted loot.  Ur best bet is to browse player vendors or 3rd party market
---
it could be the misc tab, if you keep picking up gunpowder or ores after a while it starts to stack up. I think in the early days like release week I kept picking up gunpowder and I got to the same point 'what the hell is weighing me down' at this point i'm constantly carrying over 150LT of chems/aid. the better inventory mod on pc simply adds in brackets the weight of that entire tab so it does make finding the tab that has grown in weight substantially, easier.
---
Will add later today !
---
I have carpal tunnel from work and probably a lifetime of gaming. I‚Äôm 34. Worth every damn bit of it too.
---
It might've been caused by my tesla rifle I got for clearing low level enemys then
---
Yup, that's all
---
Do you mean on the black powder rifle? because if so. that's insane
---
I assumed it was named after Tanagra, a popular local band in IRL Morgantown.  https://www.facebook.com/tanagramusic/
---
i stopped checking daily challenges. much more fun just playing it doing whatever the fuck i want. turn in scrip, only try for ranged weapons. turn in treasury notes only when i think about it or am close to foundation.
---
The downvotes we receive without explanation further prove their naivety.
---
Maybe you‚Äôd be happier switching to fortnite, seems like more your speed
---
As i have experienced this, it is the private teams, not the public teams to share loot
---
Heavy armor can never be truly weightless. All mod/legendary effect changes that affect base stats are flat changes, not percentages. Weightless subtracts 90% of base weight, ultra-light subtracts 80% of base weight, and the heavy "mod" on an armor (light is always considered the base value) is always 80% heavier than light. So heavy armor with the weightless effect and the ultra-light mod will weigh the same as light armor with the weightless effect and no mods. Light and sturdy armor can weigh 0 even with some upgrades, since sturdy is only 40% above base weight
---
Ya kinda weird its a catch 22. Need plan before you can get the drop. Im in the same boat. I think the only place to get fixer plan is encrypted event.
---
Gonna stay with my raider outfit
---
When I was doing a bloodied build, you‚Äôd always accidentally one hit any legendary in these events. Even just trying to hit the torso once would one hit kill most enemies. So it‚Äôs going to happen sometimes when people don‚Äôt mean to one hit kill. But then there are selfish people out there too who don‚Äôt give two shits.
---
I find this event barely pops up though. I just do it for the xp if it does show up. But if there‚Äôs a group of people, I usually don‚Äôt bother as there won‚Äôt be much xp to be had.
---
Scaling loot for One Wasteland? I hope events like leader of the pack scale enemies/loot now. Nice and easy 3 top level legendaries.
---
Daily ops sounds good. I hope people can post images from the PTS on what the rewards will be for season two - I'm intrigued.
---
honestly though all you have to do is make a new character and exit the vault, you have 1 lvl up right there. make it to the wayward and find a few locations on the way and you have another lvl. 
---
then delete the character and do it again next time.....
---
Could you tell I haven‚Äôt done this before
---
the video game **is** fun.
---
But people make it not fun by grinding. you don't have to grind. Either do it and get on with it or don't and get on with it. Just don't bitch about the grind being a grind when that's the whole point of a grind.
---
Personally i don't find it to be a grind. There's not one challenge yet where i've been like 'OH MAN THIS SUCKS!' because i have played games with actual grind that would reduce some of these complainers to tears.
---
Cheers. Harper's ferry I can imagine might be withheld because of the horrendous frame drops there, but they somehow made do with morgantown so idk. Charleston seems like it would be a mini-map, which should be capable of running well and is also a pretty popular request
---
Yeah, they got a weird schedule to keep people playing. Noon est for daily challenges and atom shop, 8pm est for daily faction quests, 24 hours for daily ally quest, 20 hours for pretty much everything else (scrip, caps, gold bullion etc).
---
So, naked?
---
god forbid fans get burned out on constant negativity and try to talk about how much they love a game on the official subreddit.
---
Gotta learn sometime.
---
I come and go. Thinking I'll be back soon.
---
i prefer the 1 and the 4!
---
I am just glad we are actually able to test them now. because the broken ghillie armor and ammo converter would have benefited from some testing. Though I wish they just gave you all the ranks instead of having to regrind season 2 (at a faster pace)
---
So easy to tell when someone is from the US, because on here they're generally very anti capitalistic. Fun fact: if you make over 16k dollars a year, you acrewed more wealth than 95% of people in the world. Most of those 5% are from Capitalists countries where the free market spurred innovation and new discoveries which drove the prices of once high ticket items down. Even people on welfare or in low income areas can afford microwaves, tv and basic cable. With the stride of Capitalism, QoL in those nations has gone up
---
Got my Raider Waster Outfit finally. Shoot all BOS on sight...(okay, maybe I‚Äôll do the quest line once to see the far fetched story they give for this BOS that shouldn‚Äôt even exist in the fallout timeline)
---
Lol, I know right? Takes up so much of my screen I wish I held it a little lower tbh. But yeah it'd be easier just to weld that thing to the top your PA gauntlet.
---
Well that sucks
---
Elder battlecoat!
---
You use the [wall with the silos](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dulfy.net/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-enclave-faction-quests-guide-55.jpg) in the Enclave military wing as a keyword to complete a keyword cypher, and collect 8 code pieces from the ghoul officers to decode! It's kind fulfilling to do it yourself once or twice, but then you go back to nukacrypt and never look back.

Definitely, no problem at all! Gimme a message on Xbox and I'll reply once online. Prob be around 5 hours from now, as working. GT JaggersLips13
---
yeah I was about to say, you could technically pick one up from quarry x3 at level 2, but I guess lowest level it would be would be 30 so you'd have to wait a while to use it.
---
Ill either be as the Free states ranger or a responder police man.
---
You have valid points, I'm already over it but still at the time it always sucks, you don't know what other players will do until they unload on the boss and vanish.
---
que?
---
I don't think the challenge starts counting your levels until you hit lvl 5, at least it didn't appear to when I made the last character. It does work that way in NW however with the Overseer rank.
---
Ok sweet! Mine is Reeses0702.
---
I feel ya.  Hang in there
---
Thank you, finally found one after 8 server hops.
---
still pushing mobile-esque time gates. can't say I'm surprised, really. but it's still disappointing.
---
You can't sell it, only trade it in for scrip.
---
&gt;With the arrival of ‚ÄúA Colossal Problem‚Äù on Tuesday, we are moving Meat Week‚Äôs start date by two days so that everyone has a chance to visit Monongah Mine for the new event.
---
Who are you kidding Bethesda. Please don't patronise your player base by pretending that you're doing us a favour by missing the deadline for Meat Week. 
---
We can do both in the same play session without breaking a sweat. We don't need a 2 day break between the launch of events.
---
üëç
---
You can scrip it or destroy it, but it is not tradable in any capacity. Can‚Äôt sell to vendors, can‚Äôt sell to players.
---
Exploits by definition are more severe
---
as a rule of thumb, bonuses are multiplicative, not additive. the queen also has a flat damage reduction effect I believe.
---
Mmm, meeeaaaat...
---
How? Doing it w/o a group?
---
If nocturnal only did base damage during the day, and solid bonus damage between 6pm and 6am, it'd be a lot more viable, especially with sneak builds, because there's no downside, just a situational upside, like all of the Slayers weapons. They don't do *less* damage against other enemies.

I was thinking the same thing, they fixed smiley real fast
---
Sorted!
---
They finally gave me the raider waster outfit, so the forums will be happy with less propaganda from me...
---
Concentrated fire to the head for them EZ crits helps freeze her
---
I have 3-10 higher.  Morgantown and Flatwoods are far far far too big and turn what should be a shooter into a snoozer.
---
The only people who can trade it are exploiters who should be banned, some may have already been banned
---
&gt; This time, we‚Äôre doubling the amount of Perk Coins you receive from scrapping normal Perk Cards so that you can upgrade your Legendary Perks twice as fast.
---
This is still slower than just getting 5x from animated cards lol
---
More specifically, a higher level player will get 18 perk coins from 5 levels now. Before, you would get 8 perks and then an animated card. Since they removed the single-level animated cards ages ago, you got a minimum of 2 levels and a maximum of 5, with most perks being at 3. So your average roll would be a 3-rank animated card, with 2 of your perk cards used to rank it up, giving you a total of 15+6=21 coins. And people complained that THAT system was too slow, and rightfully so. We started at an average of 21 coins per 5 levels, they downgraded it to a flat 9, and are now bringing it up to 18
---
Hope that the Meat Week stuff will still be in the Atom Shop Tuesday. Really hoping for that blue brahmin grill.
---
Daily Ops sound fun, all I hope that they don't expect us to swap our build totally around. And that with 'stealth' they just mean being a little sneaky, and not full on invisible shadow.
---
Save that salt for the cookout dude
---
After crafting 10 - 20 pieces of armor &amp; having it all be crap, I drop / destroy it. Because that's all I can do.
---
I think the score was a way for them not to hand out so many atoms so your more tempted to spend some bones in the shop
---
Maybe it's the jerk in me, but I don't find they are very efficient with fixing major exploits. Can you imagine if for example players on a game like FFXIV or WoW were to spawn in the very best items in the game, and duplicate them like crazy so they could sell on the auction house or trade to others... what would they do? They (being the company) would most likely shut down servers immediately for emergency maintenance, and not bring them back up, until the issue is resolved, the cheaters are banned, and probably a server roll back would happen, to undo the damage to the in game economy. 
---
Fo76 has so many duped items in, it's not even funny. Everyone probably has a piece of armor or weapon that is duped and they don't know it. 
---
As for game breaking bug fixes, they have proven already, that they can apply quick fixes, but lately choose not to, for some reason, they only release them in the major content update patches, months after they are found.
---
No. Say if you're running stabilzed there for ignoring 45% or armour. Then run an aa gun, that gun will then ignore a further 50% or the remaining 55% armour
---
ign same as Reddit
---
Many times, but I'm not quite sure how the food gets past the helmet. :P
---
It‚Äôs actually called Armor Ace and not Arms Race? I thought Jeff was just memeing with us. Lmao wild.
---
Edit:dumb autocorrect
---
Ill add you as well my ing is katie2332
---
This is why I use carnivore.
---
&gt; You just have to understand why some people are quitting.
---
No, I actually don't. It's none of my business why people play the game, or why they quit playing it. I'm also under no obligation to try and figure their mindsets and reasoning out. And, I also don't need to care, at all, about why someone would quit playing it, or continue playing it. And that applies to absolutely everyone here, you included. You also don't need to understand anyone else's reasons, or care about them.
---
I'm also not telling anyone to keep playing the game. Quit if you feel like it. What *does* bother me personally, as I said, is the hyperbole and vitriol. The typical comments about how "developers don't care" and Bethesda is "greedy" and then all the stuff that's a million times worse. Posting comments like that is just behavior that is absolutely juvenile and without class.
---
And, just to be clear, even though this thread was a "staying post" -thread, where people who will continue to support this game and this company were posting why they're staying, and even though whenever there's a "quit post", people don't jump in it to post reasons why they're staying instead, I'm not saying you're not allowed to post your reasons to quit here too. Feel absolutely free. I just personally don't care, at all, nor will I ever attempt to understand why you're doing what you're doing, and I'm simply mentioning that I don't care, because you decided to respond to my comment, instead of at the root of the thread.
---
&gt; I simply can't keep spending money on a game that is not even trying to fix theses things and is actually getting worst after each patch.
---
That hyperbole I mentioned, here's a good example of it. Even with a specific bug, that hasn't been fixed since the game launched, unless you worked with the developers who develop the game, and knew exactly what they've been doing for the past 1.5 years, it would be hyperbole to say that they're "not even *trying* to fix" that bug. However, you make sure that your comment *is* absolutely hyperbole by just simply applying to it to a *range* of bugs, and now suddenly the developers, supposedly, are "not even trying to fix these things", and it's a throwaway comment you just post flippantly.
---
That's the kind of asinine hyperbole I mentioned before. That's the kind of toxic vitriol I was talking about, making the developers out as people who don't care enough to "even *try* and fix" the bugs in the game. Simply because that's how you feel things must be.
---
Correlation does not imply causation. Even if a bug not getting fixed correlates with uncaring developers, that doesn't mean that is the cause of it.
---
I‚Äôm in a active BoS discord on PC we always have people on from all over the world playing
---
Where is it on the map!?
---
What's the point to lock up meat week in community goals if it happens anyway?
---
Just play a different build. It's not like the game is particularly hard and you *need* the absolute best stuff. I run a stealth pistol build and still one shot most enemies, so if it was even easier, I'd probably just get bored.
---
That's so bad hahah
---
The SCORE grind was never supposed to be the main activity to play every day for but with nothing but constant delays to actual content makes this the content
---
More specifically, a higher level player will get 18 perk coins from 5 levels now. Before, you would get 8 perks and then an animated card. Since they removed the single-level animated cards ages ago, you got a minimum of 2 levels and a maximum of 5, with most perks being at 3. So your average roll would be a 3-rank animated card, with 2 of your perk cards used to rank it up, giving you a total of 15+6=21 coins. And people complained that THAT system was too slow, and rightfully so. We started at an average of 21 coins per 5 levels, they downgraded it to a flat 9, and are now bringing it up to 18. Not only are we getting less coins for leveling, but there are also more perks to choose from/rank up now
---
&gt;You won‚Äôt be able to claim Season rewards in the PTS
---
Well, yeah, we'd gladly test em, but...
---
I‚Äôm personally happy they put it two days forward. I always take a ton of time to drop nukes so I‚Äôm glad I won‚Äôt miss primal cuts or the cookout. At least for the first 2 days.
---
No no, I mean **eat a suit of power armor.**
---
Go to Fort Defiance, eat one of the rotten ones out front. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
---
I think rifles need a rebalance because the only difference is damage. Overall accuracy, hipfire, condition and recoil all seem to be the same.
---
Only bloodied and unyielding needs a rebalance. I propose bloodied maxes out at %60 dmg bonus and unyielding maxes at +2 special.
---
Bloodied 85% hp +10% dmg,  70% hp +20% dmg, 55% hp 30% dmg, 40% hp 40% dmg, 35% hp 50% dmg, 20% hp 60% dmg
---
Unyielding +2 special if less than 25% hp, +1 special if less than 50% hp, no effect for greater than 50% hp.
---
Which discord is that? Sounds like a winner.
---
'You won‚Äôt be able to claim Season rewards in the PTS.' 
---
Another load of buggy additions for season 2, then. When will they learn?
---
I'm shocked they never put Fallout on the Switch. I'd take either NV or 3. 4 would play like garbage.
---
How many videos have you made about 76 players being angry or upset based on this sub‚Äôs outrage of the day?
---
But now because your latest bug report threads didn‚Äôt get as much traction as someone‚Äôs meme, this sub is suffering for ‚Äútoxic positivity‚Äù? lol
---
&gt; I will most likely make a video on this topic in the near future
---
 Of course. 76 youtubers exploiting any little thing that happens in this sub for content is a cancer and has hurt this game way more than people who choose not to go full Karen for anything and everything.
---
Sweet will add when I get home.
---
Sounds good will add.
---
I hope the new season items look tacticool instead of some goofy outfits
---
The community goal is for a SECOND week of Meat Week. The first one was always gonna happen.
---
the community goal is to extend it
---
ELEVATORS
---
There are some absolutely toxic enablers in this community. People who make absurd claims to prop up the game such as "I get 144 FPS all the time at max settings with my rig... it's obviously your fault" or "I've never seen that bug, so it doesn't exist" are never helping the post in question. Are they confused about the veracity of their claims, insanely out of touch or just trying to sow discord?
---
Worse, some have been doing it for the entire run of the game. I recognize a couple names that keep popping up that angrily deny most issues. What about this honestly bad game has managed to trap these people in an abusive relationship when there are so many other games out there?
---
I'm heading back to WoW. The bad expansion is over and Shadowlands is looking rather promising. Plus I can login in well under a minute, not be stuck without vital resources (CAMP) and the game is bug free enough that I won't be angrily logging out after doing my "chores".  Sure the devs are tone deaf much of the time (no please, I want MORE RNG on gear!) it's moving in a positive direction.
---
Man I can't wait to scrap all the duplicates and triplicates and fourlicates of perk cards I have.
---
Im not sure thats a very good idea, would probably be pretty annoying to suddenly get overencumbered because someone left the team.
---
Oh yeah, I've eaten plenty of those BOS guys. My teeth are well honed by now.
---
Looks like some cool stuff ahead.  Am I reading this right that colossal problem and meat week will be running simultaneously except for 2 days?
---
No as in it was never approved for manufacturing.  So only 1 or 2 should exist before the 76 dwellers started making their own
---
I'm with ya, dude. I can understand people getting upset with some of the flaws in the game, but, they don't bother me enough to quit it.
---
Plus, I FINALLY finished my Black Lodge-themed CAMP; I can't quit now XD
---
Yeah, it sadly doesn't resolve the grindiness issue. It was overbearing at it was with the original set up of 5x bonus.
---
Oh. Thx for clarification
---
The one that was free way back when?
---
Yeah just the bed and rug, why they didn't put it under the fallout 1st section is anyone's guess, at first I thought it was nice that they gave us some extra stuff this time, but nope.
---
I get some players don't care about balance that much but it doesn't hurt to have one especially in an mmo game where main content is farming for better stuff
---
No you need to find a lobby/server where noone finished the quest in that lobby. So that means u server hop and if it doesnt work then someone finished that quest in that lobby
---
I actually had that happen by accident when running that one. I had a panic moment and VATS locked the wendigo; I killed him before I knew what happened. Got to use the sorry emote, and dropped all my (unequipped) legendaries for the other guy. I'm honestly only there for the treasury notes at this point.
---
wow,  this seemed like one of the more informative Inside the vaults we have gotten lately.   Some pretty good info there.
---
Maybe instead of typing up a salty rant, you could consider that they accidentally one-shot it because the wendigo is flimsy. Or that they made a mistake and thought you already got in a hit. Or they just didn't care because it's level 40 scrip and the only good guaranteed reward is the treasury notes, which you still got. With the amount of daily posts complaining about having too many weapons to scrip every day, you'd think people wouldn't get this upset over missing a few more scrip
---
I also one shot stuff, so got myself a weak, explosive weapon, just for tagging at events like this, shoot the floor, and get a tag. It's a nuisance, sure, but it lets newer players get a tag, and hopefully get some nice loot.
---
Are you on PS4? I'm on XB1 and do this process almost daily. Even if I select "private world" from the homescreen I'm put straight back into the same server.
---
"The system rewards surviving way more than kills, which can make for a somewhat boring experience (bush wookies)"
---
This is one of the hilarious parts to me.  I've been doing NW for the SCORE when it isn't something that requires me to actually engage with NW.  I just find a bush and park, and find another bush if I have to.
---
I have never killed another player.  I've looted maybe a half dozen boxes.  I've never fired a weapon at a player.  I've put on armor once.
---
If the goal isn't something where I can exit within the first minute, I routinely finish in the top 10, and hit the top 3 with some regularity.  I know NOTHING about the game mode, my only skill is choosing an outfit that blends well (tip - look at the colors of those bushes and look at your outfits) and finding a bush.
---
That should not get me into the top 3.
---
Bethesda sent a team of raider thugs to 'invite' you to come back, right? They probably even encouraged a 1 year pre payment of Fallout 1st was the way to make up for hurting Bethesda's feelings.
---
I think they should add enclave atomic stuff a few months before the announcement of a enclave dlc(whenever that will be) to tease the idea of the enclave I guess.
---
Why not cut the cost in half for upgrading cards? Or is the 2 coins only a PTS thing? Getting two coins is just funky? All having 6 slots is also funky? Why 6? Why not 7, as with SPECIAL and NW? Or 5 to be a "round" number? Why 6?
---
The gun is affected by heavy weapon perk cards so use all of them you can it helps a lot
---
The Enclave only has a "field dress" uniform - completely not suitable for use out in the field. We need an "operative" field BDU.
---
Exactly! Either that, or you should have to "charge up" frog legs by sprinting for a bit to do a big jump.
---
Damn straight - the Enclave has gotten the shaft in cosmetics since Day 1.
---
I think the servers are having issues. The wife and I play side-by-side, and when we get dropped, it happens to both of us simultaneously, with no discernible connectivity problems on our end.
---
Harpers Ferry would be a great map! I don't like the idea of Watoga at all, but that one sounds good.
---
we do we need coins in the first place? why not just unlock an upgrade token ever so many levels. so when you do get to level 300, you can upgrade multiple cards fully. it was supposed to be a reward for veteran players, not another grind
---
Yes. It's a bloodied black powder rifle. It's happened a few times where multiple rounds loaded, but every time I hit zero, the reload animation would happen again. That day it just kept loading rounds until the weapon broke.
---
It isn't the pushing it forward that's the issue, it about the obvious lie as to why they did. The whole doing it for the sake of the community is an obvious lie. Especially given Bethesda couldn't land a deadline if their life depended on it.
---
Can‚Äôt remove as part of the structure would be inaccessible? üòâ
---
You guys rock, thanks for all the work you do
---
They eat cork. That‚Äôs why they need so much.
---
I did. And once SCORE is finished (stupid fireplace FOMO) I'm out for a while.
---
The problem is that like many people I have lots of other gaming options, such as a sizeable Steam backlog and old games I'd love to revisit (Mass Effect baby!) I'm just one schmuck that Bethesda doesn't give a shit about, but it will take a lot to drag me back in... not half baked promises of a couple hours of new content followed by months of the worst grind I've seen.
---
That said, I am pretty sure that I'm symptomatic of a large number of people here who are just burnt out and it would take a seismic policy shift at BGS to convince me to return.
---
In the meantime, the manically positive fanboys can sit here wondering why content is slowing to a crawl, all while cheering even louder.
---
&gt; Those who can't, would prefer things be more accessible to them. I don't know the demographics of FO76 but in most MMOs the majority of players only play a couple times a week.
---
I've never played FFIV, and maybe things have changed the past few years.  But as someone who has played MMOs since 1997 - that is always the case.  You can't provide sufficient content for a dedicated player base - and still let casual players finish "all of it".  Or at least - in the case of WoW, you can't finish it until the end of the expansion cycle.  
---
But, it does seem like games keep adapting more to the casual gamer (as there are more of them) so maybe that trend is changing.  
---
That said.... 100% agree with your limited currencies.  It's basically - WoW rested EXP for currencies.  I've suggested the same with script &amp; treasury notes.  2 steps.
---
1 - Change to weekly limit.  
---
2 - Once limit is hit, reduce values by 50%.  So turning in more treasury notes after the weekly limit, you get 50%.  Legendaries salvage for half the scrip.  Etc.
---
500? you talking about ores? I normally get 1300 - 1500 lead per run after diluting the cores
---
Tokesone9 above is correct. It happens when switching between weapons rapidly during the reload animation. I can't manage to intentionally duplicate it, but I've had it happen 3-4 times and it was always when I interrupt the long reload animation to switch weapons.
---
If not, at least perception and agility since it's an owl.
---
I never leave home without my fat-man. (pulls out fat man) For deer huntin.

That's what I was thinking. I wasn't entirely sure though. Thanks for the info! üëç
---
Mine is bloodied too but I don't think the effect would matter and man that's unfortunate
---
I'm having a blast with it.  If I leave it for a couple/few weeks I find it a little tough to get my bearings when I drop back in.  But it's really good and people might be happier if they stopped whining about every damned bug they encounter.
---
It actually has a BOS insignia on it

God I still grind away hours in 4.  I love it to death.

Wait, what? This mask effectively functions as a bright headlamp, for real? Because bug or not, I may get it if so. I‚Äôm so tired of switching from my mining and SS helmets instead of my other favorites just because I hate the standard Pipboy light.
---
So no forms to sign or anything?
---
Blasphemy, I say! /s (same)
---
It was my first, too, and I‚Äôm definitely not sad about it! I love this game.
---
They should just put blood leaf inside arktos.
---
I live in Kentucky. Appalachia is here, regardless of what i do with the game.
---
nope.
---
&gt; As part of next week‚Äôs update, we‚Äôre aiming to include fixes for replacing walls with doorways in build mode, add pocketed and deep pocketed mods for Secret Service Armor limbs, and address an issue blocking ‚ÄúAn Ounce of Prevention‚Äù quest progress, among others.
---
NICE
---
This is my backup armour. There‚Äôs a full set of leather and scout armour in case anything breaks, presumably floating somewhere above my rucksack. It‚Äôs a useful effect if you like heavy weapons too. Weightless legendary and Bear Arms means you have more points free for ammo.
---
Nothing at the moment. I got both items. Nuka cola pack with secret door! Also, thanksgiving display (that I did not know about because I was not playing at the time it cam,e out). Anywho thanks!
---
Yep, hate the coins with a passion but they seem to jam it through anyway..
---
Colossal Problem is a permanent addition to the game. Meat Week is a limited time community event.
---
\*fears my easy "kill X legendary enemies" challenge event becoming popular\*
---
Cool thanks I had a feeling that was the case I just wanted to be sure just in case I missed something.
---
Nice, throw cheap insults and ignore the discussion. Sounds like your the child here, you would fit in with the other fortnite kids if only you had the balls to compete.
---
I'll be damned, [it is](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0082507/).
---
Daily ops seems like it might be one of the more important things coming to the PTS, cant wait to hear more about it.
---
ah okay so its permanent not just for the season.  thought it was gonna be like rotating bosses.  thanks!
---
Can we fucking not with 'rape' gags?
---
Does anyone have more information regarding the One Wasteland? Someone once compared it to it sounding like something already in ESO but I do not play that game. I'm Lvl250 and my wife is Lvl150 so I understand the leveling of the enemies but like when attacking them, will it just be a bullet sponge for me or are they mostly doing this FOR the level rewards, etc?
---
Also, seems like they haven't addressed other serious issues like perk card loss (due to having all levels of specific cards) or difference in coin quantities available to different players who spent different amounts of level ups to switch points and such.
---
Wut
---
Also, let me buy 5 more character slots.
---
I was VERY angry at the CAMP change. And I still am. It was the only part of the game I truly enjoyed, and that one stupid and unnecessary change broke it. I don't make double sided walls, but used the wall -&gt; door -&gt; wall trick for lots of fun things such as hidden wiring and exterior walls that cover foundation blocks.
---
Their excuse of fixing an exploit that had already been fixed rang hollow and it all feels like the prelude to 1500 Atom bundles for interior walls with no other way to obtain. Which dovetails nicely with greatly reduced Atom income.
---
So I'm putting my money where my mouth is, canceled 1st (and am honestly ashamed that I did my own very small part to enable this shit) and will not return until something truly drastic changes at BGS.
---
So you ate a mutated deformed owls balls?
---
How was it?
---
My suggestion is to look up unmarked locations and choose one with something interesting at it. I built my camp by the alien guide stones.
---
Doesn't revolutionary mode make them get weapons and ammo?
---
59 still playing
---
I suggest this. First, there are several rewards of 150 atoms for completion, which would pay for the next level right there.
---
I'm behind too and at the point where all the dailies together barely get me a single level, though the weekly missions give a good boost.
---
I suggest you grind some achievements after you finish your daily quests. Doing enough missions in various regions, claiming all the workshops, killing scorched with each weapon type, etc, all get you bonus atoms that you can buy levels with. It can be tedious but incorporating several at once or mixing them with the different scout badges can make it more interesting and get more overall progress in the game. Also, get out of your comfort areas and explore and hunt in a different region. It can be worth it.
---
i'm gonna wear swimsuit to lure them
---
wait wait, what new weapons we getting?
---
I'm always loading into areas before the camp is loaded, usually able to run through the non existent walls before they appear. That can't be the problem.
---
I'm either in my Chinese stealth suit or power armor. Now, if they came out with csa skins or let us wear outfits over them, I'd be down. Isn't there an enclave power armor paint?
---
I don't take orders from you üñï
---
This is kinda stupid and defeats the purpose of test server, why bother including all this seasonal stuff if we won't be able to test the (definitely bugged to the core) rewards?..
---
I‚Äôve been on a hiatus from the game to play Dark Souls, and this just brought back unpleasant memories.
---
We‚Äôre ALLEGEDLY getting new weapons with the BoS updates.
---
Ace does have some pretty catchy sayings.
---
It made me feel more intelligent for some reason.
---
There needs to be more, weirder, and deadlier options for camp traps! Let people spawn monsters (that don't drop loot!) Instant death pits that are designed to be so! Ceilings and walls that move and can crush you! Giant Indiana Jones boulders! I want all of it because I want to see the wild stuff people make.
---
They even have the same bug where their corpse will follow you around when you fast travel!
---
Wanting stuff for free? Sounds like communism. *comrade*
---
This game does have a sense of humor :)
---
I don‚Äôt think bloodied weapons should be nerfed or touched on that much. It in itself is a very risky play style and nerfing it would brick the effect.
---
Does this count for SBQ also? Or do they need to get the 1000 hits minimum to count?
---
Yeah exactly but now I am been really picky what I use my spare atoms for, it's too bad they became cheap. I mean they hardly gave us atoms before, 10 atoms for a difficult challenge. Oh well, they still won't get me spending real money, but others will but not sure how many who weren't might be tempted.
---
I see.
---
btw, it's server, not lobby. Lobby you only have withing NW, adventure has just servers. A lobby is just where you stay before you team up and start the game.
---
I also prefer Flatwoods. Morgantown has too much city. Even when I'm not bushwookie-ing, my playstyle is slow with taking a lot of cower and using nature to my advantage. In the streets of Morgantown I feel naked and exposed...
---
I hope the new season items actually fit the damn theme of the season this time and not like ghillie suits for a space theme
---
Man, even before I loaded the video I thought, "This is gonna be good" and it sure was
---
Do I have to download the vanilla version first? Or is it a separate application?
---
Mine is not far from the main vault entrance it has basically no enemy traffic plus a pool of water I can put the water convertors into to get daily purified water plus if you want to have a garden for crops there is dirt there üëç
---
I actually just came back to the game after a few months break, and have found the game on a large content dump and I love it.
---
I‚Äôve put up with it till now - nothing can push me out I feel.
---
Because they're testing the challenges themselves?
---
Yes. It counts for that Crazy She-Bat too. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Edit: One of your teammates has to get the 1K or so min damage to the SBQ, and while you‚Äôre simultaneously within the vicinity. I‚Äôm not quite sure on the radius on how close you have to be though. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
i'll be damned
---
Bloodied builds can theoretically never take damage from serendipity
---
I would also like to know this, I use that flooring quite a lot...
---
I‚Äôm surprised that no one has said it yet, but never gonna happen. A lot of countries has really strict regulations/laws about how smoking can be depicted in video games, and usually allowing the player to use smoking products is against said rules. Would be nice, people asked for it in previous games as well.
---
I have no idea what you are referring to.
---
Shop updates at noon EST.
---
I didn't even know there was alien guide stones man I love this game been playing it since it came out and am always learning something new cool üòé
---
Ward still not fixed for me. Granted I have to click a couple more times (since the latest patch) but i still never need to retrieve the item, since it is still in my misc items so it never gets junked.
---
&gt;it was supposed to be a reward for veteran players, not another grind
---
Well, I guess Beth thinks just the opposite way, they want people to grind = being online every day. This is it. They never put much thought into the reward system of almost all aspects of this game.
---
I am already dressed in the sacred articles of my people. I am building  a church to his visage as we speak.
---
At the end of the day you‚Äôre a Dweller so there‚Äôs your faction.
---
Must be a localized and age thing, I haven't seen or heard anything about such a meme.
---
Yeah, I'm much the same. If FO76 was more challenging then sure, I might consider Bloodied. As things stand, running that build just feels cheesy most of the time.
---
I used to think like you until I got my bloodied/explosive lever action. Then I spec‚Äôd into a bloodied build and things were never the same.
---
They'd help if you crashed your spaceship on Daggobah
---
iirc how it would work is if you are level 300 and your friend is level 3, you can go to the savage divide and the enemies will scale up to you so instead of 30 it would be 40-50+ and your friend would get level 5-10. it is to prevent the area from being filled with level 50 enemies after a high-level player goes through it. I hope it doesn't make enemies scale higher for no reason. I do like to go through the forest area and just one shot everything from time to time
---
Total RNG, I Just server hopping at the light house and Camden park until they popped, 2 at the lighthouse and 4 at Camden. When there is a challenge, people are server hopping, so harder to find, so pick a location less likely to be farmed.

It‚Äôs no longer private. Every single beth net launcher player has access to the **public** test server.
---
I'd so much rather have Healthcare than a fucking microwave
---
separate application in the Bethesda launcher
---
You have to own the game on PC, then install PTS via the launcher.
---
Calling them Ghille suits is an overstatement. They‚Äôre more like Soda bottle label suits
---
The devs were running bloodied largely because Colossal Problem is so poorly balanced that it's near impossible with any other build. That's been directly stated by people on the PTS.
---
a quad cryolator would be good for freezing the queen
---
So no steel dawn on pts?
---
Fair point, but that's not my flair.
---
People with lots of str and the weight reduction perks carry a silly amount. For the weight of my Fixer on my stealth character I can carry a minigun, a plasma gatling, a prime explosive gatling, an instigating LMG, a plasma caster, a prime gatling laser, and a M79 on my power armor/heavy weapons guy. In addition, the ammo for all of it weighs almost nothing, I can carry 6-8k for each weapon with bandolier. Only the grenade launcher takes up anything with its ammo, which I carry specifically for goofs like blasting a crowd of ghouls into the sky.
---
It says enemies scale to your level. I assume that means everywhere.
---
a central location is always nice. you have your free travel to 76 so somewhere around site alpha would be good. 
---
just south of pleasant valley station is where i am. It has some water. It's very tranquil. You get the odd level 10 robot coming to fight you.
---
It said private in the new ITV
---
I wouldnt be surprised if it was upper management that wanted it to be another grind instead of a reward. upper management looks at games by the number of players and not why people like to actually play or what they enjoy.

Oh yeah, I love it too. I'm just a salty little biscuit.

And I oop
---
Well, we have yet another round of testing where we need to be as vocal as possible with our concerns about the coin system. At least we can once again drive them back to the drawing board so that abomination of "long term progression" system will never see the light in its current form.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted your comment gave me a good laugh.
---
This, exactly.
---
I go into these events with a low powered weapon equipped, only to have 1 shot douchers ruin it, and sending messages is useless because douchebaggery.
---
Yea I just saw that. Hmm. I wonder if it‚Äôs a typo?
---
well, people will be able to find out tomorrow when the PTS goes live.
---
I have the game purchased but I don't see the icon.  I see doom eternal,  wolfenstein,  fallout 76, rage...etc
---
Is it just the fallout 76 app?
---
Edt: found it . Nevermind thanks for the help
---
First time these rewards made 1 percent sense.  Thank you.

Meh nature of this sub sometimes. Lack of humour

I like this idea! I'll definitely be doing it when I hop on
---
I'm the only person in the world who like Flatwoods. AMA
---
good location meaning what?
---
All I know is that internet historian on Youtube used it for a joke. Might be where it started. Watch his video "the fall of 76". Its a very entertaining video.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for August 18th now
---
Yup. Then they keep coming out with big bundles so even if your fo1st, you still might wanna drop an extra 20 for atoms every month for all that apparel/camp goldenness. I do miss grinding challenges for atoms, im almost out of the ones that aren't bugged to death
---
Indeed. This is why we have absolutely not bugged challenges system that never fails. /s
---
I‚Äôve seen the video but that was over a year ago. Most likely then it‚Äôs probably a reference to that video
---
I thought it was prime meat and not guys? Guess the tenderizer made my head fuzzy. Lol
---
Weird. Maybe people complaining it was 400 atoms? Honestly I have no idea. People complain about anything it seems.
---
Right. Every 50 levels you can either unlock a new per or rank up an existing perk. Why fuck around with coins and such?? Just complicating things for no reason imo.
---
"Creature levels throughout Appalachia will now adjust up or down on the fly to more closely match your own level as you come across them."
---
We'll see how it works, but it sure sounds pretty clear cut.
---
Sounds like One Wasteland will nerf taking your level 1 with an exploding weapon to Line in the Sand and coming out level 30.  LOL
---
&gt; And quite honestly, me knowing that if I give Bethesda my time and money, it makes some of these aforementioned people angry, gives me enough enjoyment and joy to keep doing it.
---
&gt; No, I actually don't. It's none of my business why people play the game, or why they quit playing it. I'm also under no obligation to try and figure their mindsets and reasoning out. And, I also don't need to care, at all, about why someone would quit playing it, or continue playing it. And that applies to absolutely everyone here, you included. You also don't need to understand anyone else's reasons, or care about them.
---
I'm getting mixed signals, here. So you're enjoying that people does not like you to keep supporting Bethesda's behavior but you don't care that they're leaving the game *because* of Bethesda's behavior? It doesn't matter to you that a lot of people are quitting FOR A GOOD REASON? Not just because "leeel game sucks I uninstalled forknife is better!"
---
Anyway, have fun!
---
Edit : BTW, as much as you said that you don't have to care about why people are leaving, I don't have to care about why bugs has been around for so long. I'm a costumer, it's not my work to try and figure out why things are so bad ... I can only base my opinion on facts and the facts are clearly not in Bethesda's side when it's about FO76. There might also be less people quitting if they would just point out on their game store page "WARNING : GAME IN OPEN BETA! THINGS MAY NOT WORK (AND IF THEY DO, COOL!)!". Could have saved me 30 bucks. Also, most of the things that get posted on their steam forum is about bugs so I hope your camp is the fanciest there is in the game because I have a feeling that visitors will be scarce in the near future if nothing is done to fix things up.
---
Like good for supplies, like scrap/ammo, yet easy on the eyes
---
it does not.
---
Most definitely so.
---
Someone said it might be a reference to The Fall Of 76 video which seems to make sense with what other people said when I asked before
---
Except it's hard for people to give out quests after they have all been turned into a fine red mist by an angry, power armored man with an explosive minigun.
---
I hope we don‚Äôt see the same skin 6 times again. We got the power armor paint and the ghille suit. So here‚Äôs to hoping they learned from this and season 2 will show what they really are made of
---
Yeah I am a stealth build so my strength is pretty low.
---
i'm having an issue not being able to place my armco in my garage, even though it shows up green, and getting an error message that i cant place this item in water üôÉ
---
Now that‚Äôs epic
---
If it benefits the average player, then they'll try and fix it. If it isn't easy to fix they will patch and and break it again.
---
When the PTS is active you go to fo76 and then under game options you "select Version/Beta" and install the pts version.
---
I'm quite bored DOING the legendary race.
---
At the start I would play for hours and hours and hours.  Now I just log in to do the 9 tasks and log out again. :(
---
Bethesda need to buff them up and gives us the Deliverer!!
---
Yup this.
---
If I had to choose a new location for my camp there's a stonehenge made out of cars northeast of the munitions factory workshop that I'd have a hard time passing up.

Pointless

Yup, bad system built on top of a bad system.

Maybe you will get an opportunity to be shitty to them.

I don‚Äôt even think I know what a meme is
---
Definitely should say "public" sorry about any confusion there. We'll fix up the article now.
---
&gt;Regardless if I show proof or not, the majority of players don't CARE about issues or emerging bugs, until they encounter the bug themselves
---
So many great points in this thread, but I am  highlighting this one because it's the one I have encountered the most.  The most infuriating  part is your thread gets down voted into oblivion and then, months later someone else is posting ***the exact same thread*** and getting  a bunch of up votes.  There's a problem of people who report problems first being shat on.  Shooting the messenger is common.
---
I'm not looking forward to if everything is level 50+ now. I also enjoy a nice relaxing adventure through the forest not having to worry about burning through 556 ammo. And having my camp not get destroyed by level 50+ critters wherever I place it.
---
They don't have the rewards yet to test.  I assume they're still trying to fix the stupid auto-complete bug.
---
Where does it spawn? Ive never seen one.

Lots of decent info here!! Disaappointed in the perk sytem still but daily ops sound interesting.
---
****ed, we get ****ed...
---
Seriously though, it looks like we get discounts on some items, and access to buy the standalone Slocum Joe vendor. Check the fallout.com main pace, and it shows the fo1st discounts for the atom store.
---
I once had a lady walk up to me on the street and tell me she sees a boy that looks just like me burning in hell. 
---
That was odd.
---
Thank u ill half to check it out
---
if your username is in regard to a certain football team, I understand holding on to the bitter end. I too always end up staying and logging in every day despite playing other things.
---
I'll be doing that as soon as I get off work today good sir üëç
---
The Thrill of the Grill daily always has the optional "hunt the radstag herd" task, so those huge groups of radstags are on purpose.
---
Idk but maybe it is for the ss one
---
Oh thanks I just thought it‚Äôs weird that a lot of players looked like that
---
As long as they buff other stuff instead of nerfing the current viable options it sounds good to me
---
they should just turn the perk scrapping into what they have for NW, where you can scrap duplicates and get another card of your choice or level up. I have banked over 150 levels atm. also, the coins hurt everyone who wanted to respec their character and really hurts veterans that got duplicate 1* cards, even though this system is for veteran players. 
---
imo the perk coins make XP exploits more appealing so you can get to a higher level and get more perk points to max out the legendary perks. also doesn't help if they add more cards down the line and you cant delevel the perk. so you would have to grind for another 500+ perk points to max out the 1 new card.
---
I'm a stealth rifleman and using an instigating lever gun I normal do about 1400 per headshot
---
Carhenge is a classic and a definite place to check out
---
Gonna try it
---
I have questions too, regular barrel or crystalizing barrel?  I've got a Bloodied Cryolater and a couple hundred rounds that I want to use to help out on SBQ events.
---
Daily ops sound great (in theory)
---
Way too soon for that
---
&gt;  I‚Äôve made a whole town with budget to spare
---
The only people I have seen who build whole towns do it by integrating already existing structures on the map into their own camp.  In which case they ARE NOT building a whole town. They are using a work around.  The fact that a work around is even necessary is a sign of the game being broken.
---
Or drop and destroy it.
---
Pretty much shit
---
If you have just bought it, and then gone to modify your existing jetpack, I would suggest closing FO76 completely, then restarting. Possibly a minor issue of the permissions of ownership of the paintjob not being updated completely until you restart the game.  Other than that, you might need to contact Bethesda support, good luck
---
How can you honestly browse this sub and think it portrays the game too positively, like 90% of the posts are criticisms, feedback and suggestions to fix broken or bad systems.
---
daily ops sounds interesting, so im expecting to be crushingly disappointed
---
If I join it on a public server, I'll play it - unless there are a bunch of people.  I don't need to run around to fight over an 80exp mob.  Then I'll just afk to finish it off and get the treasury notes.
---
My town takes up the whole camp radius, isn‚Äôt near pre-existing structures and is surrounded by walls
---
Edit: it has 6 buildings in it and a farm
---
The Battlecoat itself was not unique to the BoS because it was a pre-war item. 
---
This one does have a BoS insignia on it. Doesn‚Äôt change the validity of anything I said. 
---
But thanks for digging!
---
The benefit of it being a random chance mutilation instead of a 9 cost perk would be broken. You luckily grab the serum and your advantage over EVERYONE Huge.
---
Do you have the plan for the xo1 jet pack?
---
yeah, I am worried about that as well. I have a quad double-barrel shotgun that is level 15. it is only usable in the divide and lower. it is a fuck around gun. but if they level up past level 30, then fuck, my fun gun is no more.
---
&gt; I do the ore run piece because I want the treasury notes for a successful event, but you DO miss a ton of XP and potential legendary weapons when you're the mule.
---
So run / get the ore in the first 90 seconds or so - to make sure you complete the event.  And then play it as normal.
---
(that's roughly what I do when I'm doing it solo)
---
I will claim it, but never use it.
---
Yeah for sure. Yeah's it's too bad they got greedy or at least more greedy than they used to be. I always compare it to GTA and how Rockstar and can support their online environment based on shark cards but because of Bethesda's bad design around atoms and their yanking stuff out of the store, isn't a good strategy. Rockstar runs sales but always leaves the items at a higher price in the store, they literally printing cash because of it.
---
I simply won't buy atoms but I am not the customer they focused on .. total game ruining in my opinion. I bet if they left items in the store all the time, people would still buy them when they needed them but who knows I could be wrong or maybe they don't have enough room in the store for everything.
---
I agree on some, disagree on others. But the major point I agree is that it's this partially community's fault for the state of the game. Usually the subreddit is divided on many issues with many ideas for the correct way to develop the game. But occasionally we suddenly explode in circlejerk agreement on a single thing and nothing else is suddenly important. For example the fixes on CAMP exploits. They suck and they affect the building community. But the hardcore building community is not that large. There are issues that plague the game for the majority of the player base - fast travel bug or SBQ immunity to crippling. But those were suddenly ignored, because everyone jumped on the hatetrain caused by CAMP fixes. And I use the word hate literally, because I saw sooo much hate. Much more hate for fixing low-priority glitches than for not fixing important issues. We called the developers all kinds of names, without refusing to listen to facts that even game developers have areas of experience and cannot just randomly start fixing SBQ when their expertise is CAMP system.
---
So what does this send as a message to Bethesda? That CAMP building is super-critical issue and other gameplay issues are of much less importance. Hell, the last patch introduced annoying performance drop when looking at tesla ash piles. It can make some event unplayable. But sure, let's make the biggest outrage since Fasnacht, just because we cannot glitch two walls together.
---
Here I will state again that the changes were careless on their part. I myself have a double doorway in my CAMP. But the severity of this change is tiny compared to other issues in the game.
---
Finally, I have to say that the tired argument that "the devs don't play their game" is getting really annoying. It ignores the realities of software development in any larger company. At this point it's the reddit version of youtube clickbait and I'll downvote any such comment, because they are not discussing in good faith. And I suspect that if any developers ever look here, they are also skipping any insulting comments.
---
It can spawn at either entrance inside of The Deep but has a 99.999999999999999999% chance to be slaughtered by angry cave crickets before you can reach it.
---
&gt;Scaling loot for One Wasteland? I hope events like leader of the pack scale enemies/loot now. Nice and easy 3 top level legendaries.
---
One Wasteland will affect all creatures you face, so those wolves should scale up and drop more appropriately leveled loot for your character level.
---
Pics or it didn't happen.  Where is this?
---
I hope it isnt RNG burrows 2.0. I literally forgot about the burrows until typing this message. talk about a wasted opportunity
---
I'd love to know as well. I do SBQ fights multiple times a day and she will land on me even when I haven't been shooting her for a while. My dps is usually pretty high but I usually switch to mobs after getting a few thousand damage.
---
Normal mobs seem to be whoever shot them last and isn't hidden.

 &gt; Yep! Meat Week was always on the books. The reward for the community challenges will add a second round of Meat Week in late September.
---
I don‚Äôt, I did read somewhere that I might need it but it‚Äôs a pricey plan so I wanted to be a little more confident that that would solve the problem before dropping the caps on it.
---
I mean anyone running herd mentality or strange with numbers is already dealing with that and if you're someone constantly pushing to the edge of your weight capacity you're likely used to needing to pop the random whiskey or buffout to hold you over for a minute til you get to the next workbench.
---
You're late. I'm already halfway drunk
---
You do need it to apply the skin
---
You need to know the plan to craft jetpack to use the skin. If you cant add a regular jetpack to the xo1 you cant craft the skin version.
---
The plan is sold by the¬†MODUS production terminal in the whitesprings bunker.
---
Also if you have multiple skins for jetpacks for power armor and want to change the skin you have to pay to craft it and lose the old one which sucks. We should just be able to craft a jetpack and change the skin as we please.
---
Backpacks were that way it was you used to have to craft a new backpack anytime you wanted to change the skin and they fixed it hopefully they do same for jetpacks.
---
Seems like that would be skipping ahead quite a bit in the roadmap
---
Right? Just when I grind enough atoms for something in the shop, its a goner and I'm stuck waiting till whenever it comes back or end up spending them on something else entirely
---
Adrenal reaction mutation combined with bloodied weapons and Nerd Rage and bloody mess perks can crank out sky high damage. If you have a weapon with the explosive legendary quality, you can add demolitions perk for even more damage. I also like to stack psychotats and ballistic bock as well when I'm fighting a big critter, like the scorchbeast queen or wendigo colossus.
---
so that would mean no more level one enemies to one shot in the forest area for high level players. :(
---
No, it‚Äôs not. Because then only one person would have to get the plans and then start churning out pieces for everyone else. 
---
It‚Äôs the same reason Atom Shop items cannot be shared.
---
These are supposed to be supplies for rebuilding Atlas afaik, not just for the BOS... still, cork?
---
PC with mods makes a huge difference.  Can't do much for how "smooth" it feels as far as controls and aiming/moving, but it does make it look pretty damn beautiful for the graphics engine it runs on.
---
Prickett's Fort would be great, especially as it was originally going to be home to a [PvP event](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Battle_that_Never_Was_(Versus)).
---
I would have preferred 3x instead of 2x for scrapping perk coins, but animated cards being more valuable was *always* a bad idea. It added inconsistency in how many perk coins you'd collect, since perks with more ranks would be worth more. 
---
IMO a good system would be two perk coins awarded for each level-up, and scrapping perk cards for one coin per rank. Triple the current rate of collecting perk coins, and take some of the pain away from players who lost value by spending levels to reallocate SPECIAL instead of acquire perks.
---
never really tried a cryo much,  are crits a benefit to getting the freeze?
---
I always just assumed the crits were for damage, never considered they would affect the "freeze".
---
Only within a certain distance. Seems affected by perception or so too. On one character I can only get team mate loot within 60 or so distance wise. On my other I can loot at about 100. So it seems build can affect this too.
---
That's insane amount of work. I guess without the nukacrypt nukes would be much more rare. And jetpacks would be alot rarer since getting flux would be that much harder.
---
Add new crops for all existing plants but make them specific to certain regions so that if you want to grow a specific plant you have to have your camp in one of the specified regions of the map.
---
I always enjoyed your commentary but lately you have gotten to be excessively negative and you wonder why you get down voted here.  Being informative is more important and this is why we follow you.  So, no you are not toxic, you have an opinion and that is fine, we all have  one of those.  This is a game, made by humans who I believe share their ability to be creative and of course there is capitalism, making money.  It only becomes a problem when one is more important than the other.  Maybe this is what is wrong?  With thousands of gamers playing F/O76 there will never be an exact consensus of the current state of game play.  This game is played worldwide and it brings many different personalities and styles of play and yes, cheaters.  What do you expect?  Can we all just be good little gamers?  I am not giving the developers a pass on the problems in the game but in the current world pandemic environment I will give them a little leeway.  Fellow vault dwellers be positive, there is enough negativity in the world.  Keep the funny pictures and incredible stories coming, real or fake, its all entertaining.
---
I haven't faced a lot of the bugs either.  I have faced (from what I can remember at the moment) the travel bug a bit, had things in my camp that I can't delete because it says it'll make something inaccessible, the re-healing bug.
---
Yet they can't fix the power armor glitch through wall bug (which is useful), the workshop bug/exploit, the unlimited rep exploit for both factions and a few other bugs/exploits I'm not mentioning because of how useful they are.
---
Those I mentioned and didn't have Youtube videos showing how to do it but Bethesda doesn't want to fix it.  Even though it's right in their face.  A majority of the issues can be replicated by 100% of the users.
---
Hahahahahahaha üòÇ
---
Excellent, I was running low on toilet paper.
---
Oh yeah I'm sorta in the same boat, but playing with different pistols. Because they are just about useless in high level areas.
---
Narrator: it was
---
Jetpack "skins" are not actually skins.
---
You need to know the jetpack plan for the type of power armor and when you want to use a jetpack "skin" you have to pay the full crafting price.
---
Backpacks used to be this way until they made them skin now instead of making a new backpack you can just change the skins. Hopefully they will change the jetpack so its skins and not have to craft a new jetpack everytime you want to change the look.
---
Look on the bright side: max level legendaries from the Mole Miners in Uranium Fever, and waaay more places and events to grind XP!
---
its very useful to turn the damage numbers on.  This tells you if you are even hitting her for 1-2 damage, or just wasting ammo
---
May Todd have mercy on your soul.
---
The cryolator shouldn't exist yet
---
I figured, but you never know. Also, that a pretty good deal
---
But monsters can go above lvl 50 right?
---
Viable for the first 10-20 levels. Horrible after that unless you use a double dipping pipe pistol/rifle. That path extends pistol viability til around lvl 40-50.
---
Yet not all of these exploits are fixed.  Why?  Because they can't figure it out.  Except the easy ones that set to 1 specific NPC or setting.
---
I have a quad 25%ffr single action revolver. it is the stupidest, longest reloading, worst gun in the game, but I keep it just because of shits and grins. now that gun will never be useful. and I have a ghoul slaying gamma gun.
---
How are you going to use a scope with a mini gun?
---
&gt; I've always wondered why they don't just put time limits on the events, ie you have to have been in the event for 5 minutes or longer in order to get the rewards and or loot from all enemies
---
Imagine the frustration on the other hand.  You see a map icon up for an event.  You join it.  You get over.  But there is only 4 minutes left.
---
So... should you just go, ah, shucks, up and leave?
---
Only problame i had with FO3 and Vegas was that my games always blocked if i was too high level. Huge problem when you like to explore and level up.
---
Sadly ss one dont have any skins
---
I had some fun with my guerilla build, but it sort of hits a brick wall.  You can‚Äôt expand on it.  A bloodied 10mm auto pistol with suppressor and I was done.

At first there is the novelty of taking down a scorch beast with a 10mm pistol.  But then it just gets old. I really wanted it to be fun.  And it was...for a short while.

I believe he is trying to say maybe a base item like this would be cool. I dunno. Maybe? Perhaps?
---
Thats what I hate are the months we have to wait for a fix on something.  It's like they only do this because they get more money for it?  I don't know.
---
As stated by many users, we know how much they care about the game by looking at the ammo converter and how its interface is stupid and should instead be a interface like a vendor.
---
so there is light at the end of the tunnel. still cant wait to get a 1* wood left leg from a 3* mole miner. at least it would be maxed level now
---
Well depends on your thoughts of using magic guns.  
---
&gt;!If you are cool with using magic guns look no further than a ultracite laser pistol with sniper barrel and beam splitter. Personally my gunslinger runs a bloodied 3315 and it is a beast. !&lt;  
---
Without magic it is meh.

Harpers Ferry map is in the game files. So is Charleston

ngl, I use a build with MODUS plasma weapons and a gauss rifle as well as a regular scout armor(also bought from them). It works surprisingly well actually and the Gauss can reach above 600dmg with adrenaline fully stacked

That's what I probably should have said before.  This probably explains it all.

It worked. Thanks!

Kind of crazy they still haven't just given us full video options in-game.

I started with Fallout 4 and I adored it, explored every location, did every quest. I was a day one 76er but I bailed when I discovered the state of the game. I came back in March and now I love this game, even if it is broken. I tried playing both 3 and NV and I could not play either. They were so different, I didn‚Äôt like the way they looked or felt compared to what I was used to. A large part of what made me love 4 was building massive settlements and CAMPS in 76 so without that there was nothing there for me... Not hating on 3 or NV but I would NOT recommend to anyone who started with 4 or 76. Let the downvoting begin... :(
---
You share character progress just not atoms.
---
38 and have had carpel tunnel surgery on both hands ... that's what ya got to look forward too üòÜüòÜ
---
Game runs fine after I took the advice in a constructive comment. The post was asking for PC help, not console griping.
---
300% dmg reduction plus armor.
---
I‚Äôm not certain of that. They said enemies scale up, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they scale beyond max level, unless you‚Äôre expecting level 50 radroaches as well
---
Problem is, for some of us at a higher-level, the filler is all there is. Certainly lesson learnt on it, though, as barring a re-think of mechanics I won't be participating in the next legendary run season.
---
What system do you play on
---
Enemies will still have a maximum overall level, so you being 250 and your wife being 150, you should see the same levels on enemies you face in-game today.
---
It will have a much larger effect on situations like: Let's say you have a lower level character you want to use, but your wife still wants to play as her level 150. With One Wasteland, you two will still be able go anywhere in Appalachia together, but now you'll have a larger impact on the creatures you two face since they'll simultaneously appear to you as closer to your level, and appear higher level for your wife.
---
Because some exploits are easier to fix than others...
---
Ahh okay, what about atoms shop purchases?
---
I'd love to donate, but I'm still waiting on my check from that Nigerian Prince I helped out.  Should be here any day now... be happy to contribute then!
---
Ps4, luckily not pc as I've seen that it is 10x more cancerous with BE beam splitter 50.cals with ballistic damage and energy
---
Probably not unless you‚Äôre also expecting level 50 radroaches. They will scale up, but will still stop at their max level available
---
It was a setting change on my PC actually.
---
I should have clarified... in an event, team members share loot
---
What is your location so i can have Kovac-Muldoon drop a care package ~~on you~~ *for* you?
---
There's your problem, you need to already have a jetpack made to apply a skin to it.
---
Fine with me.
---
Regular hits work too but will require more hits, ig find a nice non-explosive quad cryolator will do just fine.
---
I'm telling Maria Chav-I mean Modus if you don't delete these false statements
---
Pic please lol
---
I'm not gonna be able to get a refund so I dont have anything to lose hanging around
---
Radiation Rumble needs three runners, you‚Äôre correct.  
---
I don‚Äôt like repairing the turret at Line in the Sand.  I have no use for it.  Others will disagree.  
---
How to keep the friendly animals alive at PP?  Good question. All I can figure out is try to stay close to them...if course good luck on that.  Friendly Fire never works fast enough for me.
---
Uranium Fever.  I think you repair the extractors so the event will keep going.  I never do it for the event reward, so don‚Äôt know.  There might be a rare plan reward for all extractors working, but I can‚Äôt confirm that.
---
I've heard others mention the icebox dissappear.
---
Also seen posts where icebox remains but things in it vanish.
---
I'd use the infinite weight luggage at train stations. I use the pleasant valley train station one never had an issue. Its the one leaning against the platform near the tracks.
---
It works...buts needs lots of variables. Legendary weapons, heavy vats, critical hits. I have a gunslinger build. Fun as hell, when vats work. Too much work around to be viable for end game. Still my must daily entertaining build. Compared to tank Melee,  my non power armor heavy weapon, or my ghoul build.
---
youre right, most login every day and get less rewards - precisely as intended
---
You monster.
---
It's all just empty dialogue.
---
None of the choices have any lasting consequences, whatsoever.
---
Yep! Meat Week was always on the books. The reward for the community challenges will add a second round of Meat Week in late September.
---
But people play proactively. No one pushes or makes plays so I don't see that really happening. Just Bush wookies
---
I feel like people who started with fo3 or fonv dislike fo4 because it plays differently and focuses on different things. The same way people who started with FO4, have difficulty getting into fo3 or fonv for exactly the same reason. Im more in the FO4 camp despite playing through fonv but im just more of a sandbox guy than a full blown rpg hence my preference :P
---
Edit: shouldve added, people who started and liked the games they started with
---
They can spam stims in PA too.
---
I agree with some points, but disagree with just as many. I was working on a more lengthy response to the points I disagree with, but I'll narrow it to two things.
---
I will allow that I'm very potentially in the wrong here, but I think that expecting empathy and for people to legitimately care about a total stranger experiencing bugs on a videogame (especially from a company notorious for having buggy games) is also self centered.
---
I also would hesitate to say that enjoying the game is a break from reality. Granted you didn't explicitly say this, but I feel that is the overall tone of your second topic. If they have a positive outlook, what is the issue? That they'll potentially disappointed? So what? Let them play the game and enjoy their time. Should no one enjoy the game because I can't fast travel about half the time I try? Should I not enjoy the game because of this? Should we all just stop playing because legendary bodies sometimes fall through the map?
---
im bout to be in the same boat, really doesnt matter if its challenge based, just need some semi interesting endgame repeatable content
---
No matter what really, everyone will be hunky dory when it's all done. There's some static NPC dialogue from the group you sided with if you screwed them over their share or not, but that's it.
---
Certain areas like the bog have minimum levels though, correct?
---
People have been saying they're leaving over the camp limitations. I'm guessing those are people who built those immersion-destroying bases floating in the air or clipping into the ground. 
---
On the one hand, with constant unavoidable PvP being scrapped so early on, I can see why they'd be saying it shouldn't matter. On the other hand, I have a pretty elaborate base blending into the countryside and still have plenty of budget for more stuff so these things had to have been pretty intense for people to no longer be able to do them. 
---
If people leaving means I don't have to see an impossible base held up in the air by a single stairwell, great.
---
Honestly if they got rid of nuka cola spamming most of the people that use it would have to learn how to actually fight. I really don't see the fun in using them. If there is no risk of me dying then what is the point of PvP. There is nothing enjoyable about jumping around shooting each other until someone runs out of nuka colas. At this point I enjoy Nuclear Winter more even with the hackers. At least there aren't any hacked 50cals and quantums there.
---
Whenever I spam stims I still get melted, i don't know if it's the perk that helps them or timing
---
They could make it so if you dont join a event in the beginning you just cant join. Thats still not fixing the issue though of legendary enemies being designed poorly.
---
Don‚Äôt forget that sweet tenderizer damage. It‚Äôs special in that it gets added last so it‚Äôs truly 7% bump on ALL damage unlike other perks that are base weapon damage only.
---
Yep, thats one of the things i prefer in fo4. You can fuck around even after the story is over without worrying about anything else.
---
I only discovered them a couple weeks ago. I actually have COVID &amp; now rhanks to Nukacrypt and a Chinese Stealth Suit, I sneak my way through the silos &amp; launch as often as I can &amp; have a lot of fun doing so. Because of this I finally got enough violet flux to upgrade my excavator PA &amp; I'm lvl 121. So yeah, COVID and Nukacrypt had my back!
---
Edit: PLEASE wear a mask people &amp; respect social distancing. COVID is not fun, it just needs victims. Don't let it get you.
---
U fookin wot mate?
---
Serious lack of armor piercing options, and most relevant perks are crammed into Agility, so no gun-fu or adrenaline.
---
It wouldn't even matter as any competent build can solo pretty much every event except maybe Encrytid and Paradise
---
??????
---
Where those pocketed limb plans at though still ain‚Äôt seeing them in the shop
---
You finished weeks early.  You could have taken it slower, you didn't, that's on you.  There was nothing to feel relieved about but the things in your own head.
---
Yeah I was tempted to just keep at him but I didn't want to give him the joy of killing me over and over plus he probably has other duped items that he will trade for even more
---
You can plant gourds.
---
God yes, there needs to be some benefit to running no mutations, or way more drawbacks to running mutations. I haven‚Äôt met many folks out there that don‚Äôt run mutations because there is almost no repercussions for doing so.
---
I would have to think this is a recently introduced bug.  For my playthrough, I kept everyone alive and I received dialogue from the relevant characters that matched the decisions I went with such as the mother with the stealth suit being alive, etc.
---
Yeah no doubt lol .. I am saving my atoms from the score challenges, I am not planning on wasting them to reach level 100 as they want you to do. I will carefully pick and choose what I want and save them for something really cool. it does mean I won't get most of the bundles but that's ok ..
---
I'd like to avoid VATS bonuses unless we have their perks equiped.
---
I'm happy to try different types of legendary effects but I feel like a player will generally want to use VATS or not.
---
None of your choices mattered in the long run outside your vault raid, but the dialog is a bug, they broke it in one of the last couple updates
---
Name checks out
---
&gt; Enemies will still have a maximum overall level, so you being 250 and your wife being 150, you should see the same levels on enemies you face in-game today.
---
Does the level scaling stop at 50, then ?
---
What I'm getting at is - in theory, a level 250 is no more powerful than a level 50.  
---
I've grinded from 100 to 250 using the same weapon and could have been using the same set of power armor the entire time.  Would mobs start getting more difficult?
---
I've been busting my ass for Ward daily, and he still tells me that he's keeping his eye on me.
---
Yeah ok or maybe rotating would be cool, I understand why people would want this, I‚Äôm nearly finished myself, just a shame that it has to be thought of that people would abuse the system
---
Gaining SCORE is the result of playing normally.  People level, buy things, do events, craft etc.
---
Gaining rep is an annoying time gate, but it is also the most lucrative quests in the game and why I still do them long after having capped out.
---
I'm sorry you hate the game, but the excuses you're using are idiotic.
---
Yeah, well I don't carry on as I know there's no point, the funny thing is he died to himself before I hit back lol, just looking at them i can't tell if it's gonna be a legit fair fight or is he just gonna spam those quantums/stims
---
I like living at white springs, there‚Äôs the resort and the bunker and you can find wendigos and other high lvl things around. The only downside is the occasional nuke but it‚Äôs only happened once for me
---
I have a jetpack, I just don‚Äôt have the plan for the jetpack. I bought it as a mod a long time ago.
---
Nope. Beckett is just right: He sees you as what you ARE: a seven-sixer, born and raised in the safety of an underground vault, pretending to be a raider...
---
Me: "Just get in the power armor."
---
Settler Wanderer: "But I won't be able to play guitar with those giant fingers."
---
Me: "Yes, I know...."
---
this game is very casual, its just how it turned out. i played the game on ps4 for a long time but just couldnt bring myself to do anything besides walk around my camp and gawk at how cool i looked lol 
---
most players probably just play this like a MMO version of stardew valley, which is a great game lol idk this game is deff in a weird state but cant blame Bethesda when most players are probably good with what they got.
---
That would work and make mutants have value.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
That is exactly what im talking about :P tried to get through some older games and i may not be the oldest out there, but still its just that we get used to the stuff we see right now i think.
---
I was really hoping the ammo converter would just be disassembling the ammo using the powder and lead to make the ammo you wanted and not the convoluted bulshit it is right now
---
How the fuck do u disable Hold X to equip/eat &amp; drink/wear etc is litteraly annoying
---
Yep, I've opened many perk packs and got dozens upon dozens of butcher's bounty. Probably a good 20+ coins wasted even when I have a full set of animated ones already. They really need to give some initial level bonus for current/veteran players, even if it only applies after a certain level
---
They are pretty lackluster. I ran one for quite a while but the low ammo capacity, lack of penetration perks and the damage perks being in the agility tree make it underwhelming.
---
I think it's them trying to send a message to Bethesda. I kinda get it
---
how is this helpful?
---
You can finish now by logging in and doing a couple quick things that take less than 2 minutes a day.
---
That isn't grinding, that's just whining that you don't want to play the game but want all the stuff given to you for free.  You are so stunning and brave.
---
Second time this happens to me now
---
This happened to me as well.  Jen's mom was alive and well when I returned to the instanced part of Foundation, though!
---
Legendary perks still way to grindy. Need to be easier if they expect people to actually give a shit about them
---
I am committed as well. Mostly because I am the head of a robobrain with my conciousness tied to their servers.
---
Childish, but not wrong.
---
There are many ways of doing it well. They have been moving in the right direction, except for removing that bonus initially, but it's baby steps and there's a long way to go if they want it to be a good system by the time it's released. Especially considering that legendary perks are almost a year delayed from their initial intended release already
---
Ah. Im pretty sure it came around whenever the "canvas" bags turned out to be pylon. They gave players 500 atoms to make up for that. So, instead of getting the actual fucking bag, we got LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE
---
Its definitely a reference to the Fall of 76 video. I believe it was part of the nylon bag thing where bethesda gave them like 150 atoms to make up for it, and the guy says something like "yeah screw the bag, lightwood laminate, lightwood laminate, lightwood laminate!"
---
I'd been walking around for a good while inside the nuke zone until I found it
---
Chameleon armor makes you invisible while crouched and not moving. PA has the stealthboy mod for the torso that works the same way.
---
i want nuggies.
---
I like to come up with a backstory and let that inform the guns and gear.  I started off as a naive Vault Dweller, trying to be the best Pioneer Scout and eventually made my way become an Enclave Forest Scout.
---
I'm sorry you feel this way.
---
at the current rate to get them, it just makes xp boosting and exploiting more attractive.
---
If you play, you're participating.  Anyone that plays an hour or more a day will pretty much auto-complete the "challenge" as it isn't remotely a challenge.  Anyone calling this a grind is a moron.
---
guess your a big fan of... canned food :)
---
If you want an example of what I am talking about look at league of legends vs dota and PUBG vs fortnite or even fortnite vs black ops 4. LoL has been active for over 10 years and they've done so being F2P whilst completely setting the standard for MOBAs. This is because of their constant quality updates they were able to overthrow dota and become the biggest MOBA ever creating a dynasty. PUBG lost the crown they had on the genre to fortnite and while black ops 4 could have stolen that they weren't doing enough consistent content updates. Even with some adults not enjoying the art style fortnite still has more average viewers on twitch despite being an older game. 
---
It's not naivety its basic business. Especially in a hyper competitive market.
---
Because of fo76 beth should be expecting losses when it comes to all their new releases and that's just a fact. They cant expect their fanbase to bail them out when they aren't releasing quality products.
---
Poor quality products have long term effects to businesses.
---
Good those guys deserve it
---
and no info on what they are? ah well, if the [50.cal](https://50.cal) machine gun gets some new mods im cool
---
This!! Plus more hairstyles...
---
With power armored heavy weapons build and stabilized? Oh yes, definitely. Bloodied prime plasma caster will kill most scorchbeasts in 3-5 shots. Hell, it will kill most everything else in 1 shot if you sneak attack them, maybe 3 tops without sneak attack. I use my bloodied prime plasma caster for swatting deathclaws, yao guai, and other big game. Instigating Gauss shotgun for trash enemies, and Bloodied Gauss Minigun for SBQ, or when everything in the area absolutely needs to die right now. Also, if you are using the prime plasma caster, you can craft ammo in bulk for quite cheap; 5 flux will get you maybe 1500 rounds with the ammo crafting perk and super duper.
---
Interesting, will check that out!
---
Happens all the time I gave up on the gauss pistol and shotgun until it‚Äôs fixed
---
Oh hey, look! I'm more interested in this then I'm in those who leave. ü§£
---
My second character is a BoS character
---
Yea but hard to find out in the world.
---
aye. i just holster it and get on with it
---
I'm with you ..... don't care what the others say.
---
Son of a bi\*ch..... I'm in.
---
I don't like gear and builds which require me to be debuffed in order for the gear to be effective.
---
Suggesting you play a battle royale that is supposedly well executed where people play the way you want isn‚Äôt a cheap insult. Not sure why this post is so upsetting to you, just thought it was a funny experience in one of the very few NW matches I‚Äôve actually played
---
Dude this sounds awesome.  I've been wanting to make a camp that looks like Packanack but haven't got around to it(mainly cause I can't bring myself to destroy my current camp).
---
You already got some good advice so I don't have anything to add, but love to see pics when you're done.
---
If your a fo1st player you literally lose nothing while gaining access to something. If you're a regular player you gain access to something you've never had but lots of players wanted to be available.
---
Ok so it‚Äôs a pretty well known bug? I was afraid Bethesda was unaware and wouldn‚Äôt be attempting to fix it
---
Prime meat is only for the extra scrip if you want to go through the headache of micromanaging spoilage rate with the hourly event. In the actual meat week event, you need to collect large amounts of animal guts and put them in a cooler
---
Just you to pry my bloodied explosive flechette harpoon gun from the display in my camp üòΩ
---
Posting this is just rude, like your trying to prove a point. Well guess what, I don't care that your leaving.
---
(By the way I'm not one of the ppl that left, I'm close to being Ally's with the raiders but my internet is shit)
---
PURVEYOR SALE!?? ..... Do I need to spend all my scrip before you guys launch that?
---
Theyre viable, just need to be done right. I have mained one for about 750 hours. Also have a commando/rifleman that ive got about 150 hours in, so have a good feel of how they compare.  Think of them as the same niche as a commando/rifleman but with 2/3 the damage, and a little less sneaky if not bloodied. 
---
Junkies 10mm will double tap most enemies with sneaky vats headshots. Jukies prime auto 10mm hits the queen for 45 damage a hit and like 85 on crit. 
---
On the bright side you can carry a bunch more gun, ammo is dirt cheap, as is trading for the guns.
---
If you need help setting one up or pointers, hit me up.
---
Possibly some speech or 'alignment' options when the BoS arrives. If you sided with the Raiders the BoS might ned your help accessing weaponry or hire them as mercenaries. Settlers might be used as a source of food support network or a laborer system. I'm going to assume the faction you chose to help first will be your primary alignment if you've managed to ally to both sides
---

I mean most people say they leaving prob won‚Äôt.  We all love to Hate it!

What's the downside to repairing the launcher?
---
When I walk by him, he says something along the lines of at least the weather is nice.
---
He said this to me once during a rad storm.
---
Ha. It's BGS. It's going to be swarms of stealthed assaultrons.
---
 Your daily op will be 8 minutes of non stop, unavoidable eye laser one shots.
---
I thought One Wasteland also included a large balance update. Is that not the case anymore?
---
I'll be reppin' the Tattered Dress and Veil of Secrets!
---
Yeah but they haven‚Äôt mentioned it on anything if they plan on fixing it or not
---
Very new player here: I‚Äôve killed like 12 of these Ghouls... do I even need the codes or can I just use the website?
---
Fall Guys is topping Twitch right now.  It's crazy.
---
same with me, level 50 bloodied unarmed. wbu?
---
I keep very strict discipline on my work time and play time.
---
It's not like I'd stop working to play at lunch. At 10:30 in the morning. For six hours.
---
That would be irresponsible.
---
Because it just steals kills.  It's not like the number of scorched is overwhelming and you get a minute to repair the generator if it breaks so why repair something that does dmg but is just going to take XP from other players?    
---
Also on a personal note I just find it annoying.  The explosions are too loud and obtrusive.
---
Everyones forgetting about mods. Graphics not good enough theres a mod for that,  it'll look better than 76. There's a mod for literally everything, so many years of talented modders working their craft its very impressive.
---
PTS gets lots of new stuff Friday.
---
Colossal Problem and Meat Week both start next week.
---
Exactly.  I have a bunch of cards I picked at various ranks so I could tweak my builds here and there.
---
I seriously don't get why we need to scrap them. If anything just have a hide option to declutter a bit.
---
Trap camps are fine. Nuking other camps is fine. It‚Äôs all fair game IMO.
---
As I say near the end, I apologise to all the people who use them normally I guessüòÇ but it's a shame that such beautiful weapons can be abused by dupers then for some untalented scum to come and wipe all his spazmoidness all over a work of art
---
Why weren't you on a team? Rejoining a server is one of the great things about teams.
---
It depends on the trap. An actual trap camp would be ingenious and would happen automatically. If their ‚Äútrap‚Äù is waiting for you to be standing on a floor and then deleting the floor from under you, then that‚Äôs not a trap. That‚Äôs just being an asshole. 
---
Actual trap camps are perfectly fine, and I appreciate the thought that goes into them. The other ones....sure, use a nuke if you want.
---
It was a joke referring to the weaboo-stigma of the Katana..
---
It's there.  I don't know the layout will enough to describe where, but there's at least one.  If like to know if there's any Ash Rose down there as well.
---
I thought we didn‚Äôt complete the concrete one. But we can still get it?
---
But it is made out of concrete and metal...
---
ouchie.
---
How much maintenance do you think having a severe drug addiction would entail? That much. Though I would mention that while you will have a health advantage over a bloody build, it has less potential power, since bloodied can synergize with the adrenal reaction mutation and nerd rage.
---
&gt;The current iteration of battle pass requires you play nearly every single day for at least two hours in order to finish the Season comfortably.
---
Absolute bullshit.  I'm 99 now... SEVERAL WEEKS early and I play less than 2 hours a day most days.
---
Calling Legendary Run a grind is complete and total bullshit.
---
Nukacrypt and Modus! yesssss!!! &lt;3
---
Yes, but some things just date. Clunkiness of steering, design choices etc.
---
As for the graphics, trust me i know. I've spent more time in mod organizer and downloading mods than i have actually played either of the games. Besides, i feel like fallout 4 even in default looks better than fo76. Not sure why
---
Ahem....1911?
---
This is the balance update. They said they were approaching it through scaling, not adjusting weapons
---
Ok.
---
In that case, download it and good luck.
---
So if it's a regular camp with traps, I have no problem with them. I really enjoy them sometimes and the creativity of the builders. BUT.... When you are shopping and the owner just  put stacked punji boards around you and you will die instand this is a reason to nuke it for sure.
---
This has nothing to do with a trap camp. Just griefing.
---
I did it yesterday because of them lol level 90 shotgunner
---
Sitting there for 15 minutes is too hard?
---
Oh right.
---
I just like the looks of the said sword or sword type?
---
Most people fight SBQ outside the nuke zone. If you fight inside the nuke zone the lower enemies spawn in the zone and then drop the components for stable flux. I.e. masses and high rad fluid.
---
I suppose under Watoga, everyone nukes that area.
---
Just afk somewhere
---
I am also staying, it's a fun game
---
Common sense answer is downvoted.
---
Welcome to reddit, home of communism, intolerance, idiocy, TDS, grifters, entitlement and purple hair.
---
Yes! Please introduce cannabis as a new crop!
---
Give it the same effect as the pipe when you consume it.
---
It doesn't have to be all in one game, right?  You could survive only 1 minute fifteen times, sounds pretty easy.
---
My first console was the NES, my first games were top gun and a double feature cartridge that had Super Mario Bros. and Duckhunt on it.
---
We didn't have polys back then, we had bits. Lol
---
I had leveled up and picked one of the 1* hacker perks, and then the next level I get a perk card that has the 1* hacker perks. and then I got that same card 5 levels later. I know I am not the only one that this has happened to. and there should be an option to hide cards you don't want to see. you might want them later, so you don't want to scrap them, but they get in the way of trying to switch out blood mess to super duper.
---
I was just about to say, I hopped in the other day to survive 10 minutes and it was a cake walk
---
Yup.  Post after post "I finished 3 weeks early, this is too hard!"
---
Just how stupid is that?
---
Not sure as I didn't try to decyper them yet.
---
They time out so at some point they'll start to disappear from your inventory. I think we have to progress with the storeis to get access to bunkers first though.
---
Perfect timing.
---
It is fun and easy and it isn't a grind.  People finishing 3 weeks early calling it hard are idiots.
---
I only Grind seasson nothing more
---
That's either a troll headline, or a hilarious mistake
---
I can't see any of those posts currently in hot or new, can you link to them?
---
I have seen some of those posts in the past, but they usually give reasons. 
---
Here you're not countering anything, but being dismissive to a general concept.
---
Aye.  Would be nice indeed.  I don't think I've ever encountered a game that focused on making the game bug free instead of adding more content and more bugs with it.  That would be the stuff of legends.  We could probably cure Crane of his scorched disease faster than getting this type od thing going.  But, if you have a petition put down LazarusRevives from Xbox, because you got my vote for this idea!
---
Depends on what type of flux you're looking for
---
That would be make the game funner so not gonna happen
---
Yeah, it's cumulative.
---
Yup, just streamline it a bit
---
what is this frame rate you speak of
---
The way of getting perk coins has got to be one of the dumbest things in this game. You're literally not letting us change our build if we want to max out legendary perks, which just makes no sense whatsoever to me.
---
May be to one of your points, this post:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i8uxv3/im_staying_this_is_my_staying_post/
---
Which has a bunch of upvotes despite providing nothing but a dismissal of other posts, even though I can't see any 'leaving' posts currently in either hot or new, and those ones that were actually posted in the past usually at least gave reasons.
---
I would have no issue with that post if they gave examples of those posts and counters to their points (or pointed out which posts themselves had no substance like that post), but without that it just looks either like a karma grab or blind fanboyism.
---
A god among gamers. I'll be happy to see you again I  another 20 years, but I'll be expecting some war stories. Lol

It's truly been a rollercoaster. The "ban" wave was probably the best recent example of this. People are fed up with dupers, hacked weapons, NW aimbots, etc for many months. There's finally a ban wave. Cheating discords are going crazy. Massive damage control. People are happy that something is finally being done. A week later, basically all that progress is reverted and most of the cheaters get their accounts back with no penalty. Such a good example of taking steps forward and backward at the same time
---
Sounds easy to me, if not tedious
---
One of that Manor's greenhouse always has one.
---
L260 Bloodied Pipe Gunslinger.
---
People who are quick to rubbish pistol builds generally haven't even attempted to take them past the first few levels let alone 50+.
---
My go-to is a Hunters Pipe Revolver, with a Stalkers Pipe Bolt Action backup. I also have a Bloodied 10mm SMG for fun days out, and a Stalkers Gauss Pistol for its AoE explosive effect (also an AA/E Handmade with pistol grip for when people tent glitch Line in the Sand). 
---
I can take on anything - West Tek Super Mutants, Behemoths, 3* SBs, Sheepsquatchs, and achieving award level damage on SBQ is no problem. And all while having far more fun than my PA Heavy or Melee builds.
---
I've hit 4k+ with my current pipes, and 3k+ with an Instigating 38 pipe pistol - and that's even before I've gotten any good Bloodied pistols.
---
I'm at white springs. If you set up south near the snake on the map your usually outside of nuke zone and there is a pond for water.  Mirelurks spawn there but my turrets take them out easily.  Nice and open for building and I get tons of people that visit me daily
---
Lots of ash rose in the green houses on the roofs in Lewisburg.
---
Well maybe a bit of both lol, thought it fit well with the situation occurring
---
I think the game thinks you're charging it, cause it shakes like you are charging it.
---
I can also shoot a round off and see if that fixes it, sometimes it does, other times it does not fix it. I would then need to use the favorite wheel to swap weapons to clear the bug.
---
Mr Pebbles backpack and the white door with the flowers/leaves on it!
---
Patch 22 "We added teleporting corpses to every player to enhance gameplay"
---
Their whole camp system needs to be rebuilt from the ground up. So many bs errors, terrible snap points, or basic snap points that they didn‚Äôt even think to add. Complete lack of a free placement option. It‚Äôs an absolute mess.
---
Yeah I don't get this either. Not the first time, either.
---
I guess addicts have a hard time admitting that they have a problem.
---
70%  300 would make it impossible to kill her.
---
Unlocked, Unused.
---
I can go bloody whenever I want with my cards armor set and weapons in storage, I just choose not to. Way more fun for me personally to not be running around like a demigod
---
I use the crystallizing barrel.  Seems to help not blow through the ammo as fast.
---
Where on the map is this??
---
Find a bush, play on my phone, collect score.
---
No way to resolve it. All you can do is hope for a better tomorrow
---
no
---
Yeah, that's where I source it.  It'd be nice to have a one-stop for making P, though.
---
I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs true for some, but it wouldn‚Äôt have been for me if I hadn‚Äôt focussed on the challenges. Claim a workshop? Never seen the point. Complete events? Found them tedious, never did them. Stopped modding weapons and armor a good while ago. Often find little of interest to buy from other players (yes, I know about the buy three bullets cheese.) I could go on, but hopefully you see the point. 
---
I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve got a quarter, maybe nudging halfway through the board just by doing daily stuff, but auto-completing it? There‚Äôs no way I would want to specifically repeat content I‚Äôve already done x amount of times without doing so intentionally. So yeah, it‚Äôs a moderate challenge in that regard. 
---
Not sure I‚Äôd call it a grind though, don‚Äôt want to be labelled a moron and all.
---
I feel like that would make an already stressed game chug pretty hard. A functioning video screen, constantly playing, while simultaneously floating around the landscape would demand resources this engine can ill afford.   
---
Maybe you could fake it. Instead of actual video have the screen rotate through a series of static splash screens, with audio backing. Still not sure it's worth doing, what with all the other compromises made for performance already, but it's interesting to contemplate.
---
I can one shot a lv91 death claw wearing my Chinese stealth armor. Endurance and charisma are at 1s for me tho because I don‚Äôt use quality of life cards
---
crimson flux
---
rip Pistols forever and non-god tear shotgun builds. it would have been nice to have a weapon balance pass. because I can't recall the last time I saw someone use an energy weapon that wasn't a Gatling, Guass, or a duped legacy explosive. take the Radium rifle as an example, it does ballistics and radiation damage, but it is so far inferior to the fixer or handmade (good luck trying to learn all the plans for a weapon that drops less than the handmade) that even a BE radium rifle is worth more as scrip than caps. there are so many weapons that are just so lackluster or have way superior options that most weapon categories come down to 1-3 weapons out of a pool of 6+
---
It is, when you need to do the challenge in couple different NW's matches and you can get the 250 score by farming xp in adventure mode twice as fast.
---
Right?  The other day when it was pick two locks, I couldn't find any, but I survived until 9th without killing anyone and for quite a while.
---
THIS,  SOOO. THIS.
---
seems like it should be such an easy thing to add.  
---
I'd be happy if it was atom shop, and came with every current floor skin as an option.
---
They upped it from 10? That's a bummer. But not a huge deal
---
Several ways to achieve 'invisibility', some more effective than others and each with its own advantages. 
---
Chinese Stealth Suit, Chameleon armour piece, Chameleon mutation +weightless armour, PA + Torso Stealth Boy mod.
---
Morgantown has a lot of cobalt flux you can gather, the whitesprings has a lot of florescent and yellow, Fissure site prime has a lot of red. I do not know a good place for violet flux personally. I would say look for nuked flora maps, they usually put a dot for each type of flux you can gather.
---
We need enclave pa paint.
---
Or on an alt with "good with salt"
---
Though, while you're logged out, nothing goes down.
---
Finally, someone with the guts to stay
---
it's still very handy. Nothing better than free ammo!!
---
Then don't do it. You can complete the run without doing a single NW daily. Stop being a whiny bitch.
---
and punishing players who have changed their special stats or long time veterans who got multiple duplicated 1* perk cards from perk packs
---
Laughs in power armor.
---
perk load outs should have been in the works and released before the legendary system. imo
---
They would have to remove some of the CAMP restrictions first in order to make this work. There have been times when I decided to move my CAMP (which automatically blue printed it). However, when I went to set it down, I got the 'this item needs support' bug eventhough it was held using concrete foundations. So, Unfortunately, the bigger your camp, the harder it is to actually set it down (even when blue printed).
---
Your idea would be terrific if they would just remove the restrictions like the 'this item needs support' one.
---
The primal cut events were by far my favourite part of meet week. Specially down in the bog
---
why would you need to spend all your scrip before the sale?
---
BETHESDA!
---
Please Buff
---
* Assault rifle
---
* Give the 10mm smg a red dot sight mod
---
In the circle? I tried that a few times but even while wearing my chinese armor radiation was so high that I dropped dead in a few seconds... What am I doing wrong?
---
Are lvl 50 wolves hard to kill?
---
Also hard with all the atom shop camp stuff. But I do agree it would be really cool
---
No need to downvote me you prick
---
But coal is a good thing! It burns much better for barbecues than those crappy wooden toys!
---
South of R&amp;G Station.
---
its all about teh Primal Cuts.. cookout is just easy xp and a place to be social and show off your cosmetics..
---
takes more bullets to kill. so instead of one shotting them, it might take 2-5. which will stack over time and drain ammo a lot faster.
---
Soon ummm you guys think they fixed that glitch with the bee's?
---
It's down to one of the items inside your blueprint.
---
For example a little blue generator with a power connector on top inside a small building which is blue printed will stop 5he blueprint from being placed.
---
Make blueprints basic like the building and crafting stations are ok to blueprint anything with floor or wall decoration will not allow you to place it every time  even if it goes green. It's not a bug it's how the build engine has been built.
---
And for more info go watch fallout 76 builders like finalrender and norespawns and many more on YouTube who can show you how the engine works.
---
I‚Äôm staying, I‚Äôm finishing my coffee.
---
Exactly!  I'll rarely ever reach the 800 lb limit because its usually made of 3 star legionaries I put up for sale for others. Each day I use them to make 150 scrip and the number comes down. I sell it all .... bulked junk, drugs, food and drink, ammo .... everything. When all is said and done I'm usually between 23000 and 30000 caps and 600 - 650 lbs. No frustration, no issues. 
---
I'm stealthy bloodied.... and other than using the Excavator when I'm overloaded to get back home I rarely use PA, though I have them all. I'll wear my cool gear when I'm playing online with family. Alone on a Fallout 1st server I don't have to listen to some dirtbag swearing in front of my kids or worry about being shot.
---
I love the game.
---
Sometimes when it freezes don‚Äôt do anything and it would eventually come back and if they killed the sbq, you get event reward and get to loot the corpse too, worked for me several times (PS4). The wait could range from 30 sec to 10 minutes.
---
it used to be 30
---
I'll never leave but I won't always stay.
---
It's always my luck... I blow all my scrip cuz I am maxed out and then they announce a sudden Purveyor sale.. then I don't have enough... :(
---
One Wasteland. :(
---
Screen shot, raise a ticket immediately, pray, wait...wait...wait...

I never bought from another player until it was mandated, i did not care for workshops until it was mandated, i did not care if i leveled up every day until it was mandated, i tossed bubblegum until it got mandated.

I just like sneaking around and building camps, please, do elaborate how I'm playing normally, I'm sure an idiot like me needs further explanation...

There is a two story white building at the SW end of Morgantown trainyard with a locked chest. It's my go-to for that challenge.

Hi! We're working on a fix for the blood sample issue during An Ounce of Prevention and looking to include that in our hotfix on Tuesday.

Only the site. Or if someone launched a nuke from a silo and you wait 2 hours you don't even have to enter the code in that silo. Just insert a card
---
too much maths.. my brain hurts.
---
yea you made 2 different comments instead of editing one with a set up like this you dont need super high hp since you will take so little damage plus you will still have over 100 hp with this build and nothing minus an assaultron will be able to kill you with it and yea i just missed serendipity put that on and with that setup you will be basically unkillable and that doesnt even have the drugs and food buffs you could use as well ive tanked 3 pillars at once with this setup if you put on the extra stimpack usage perk

Well that blows, I was hoping plasma rifles would finally be useful.
---
It is not hard, just hide. And you do not have to do it, if you find it too hard for your abilities, then just skip it.
---
Oh well
---
I always get at least 60 stable flux during a nuke.
---
Absolutely. I was at least 100 levels lower than I am now, and I loved showing up alongside the heavy hitters and watching them melt the baddies.
---
You can use the site only if need be. I enjoy hunting the officers and getting the codes myself.
---
Next time
---
76er!
---
Running the gunslinger build you posted a while ago. He's my only high level character yet level 100 I suppose I really dont have any point of reference as it's the only build I've played but i haven't run into anything i cant tackle yet since i was able to get a junkies explosive western revolver off a generous community member.
---
The thing is that though, I was building this building in a wider space instead of a mountain slope space, and I was able to replace onto the same spot no problem. but not onto a mountain slope, even there is just one single floor base attached to the ground....
---
So I am pretty sure its not item specific I guess?
---
Just spawn around The middle of the map, find a Bush and sit there while you do something else around The house. No dought one of the easiest challenges to get done
---
I didn‚Äôt vote you up or down. Chill out, and remain civil.
---
I‚Äôll bite. Whyyyyy?
---
...I literally never thought of throwing the Ultra-Light mods on legendaries I'm keeping stored for trading as a way of keeping STASH weight down.  Goddamn, that's genius.
---
&gt;Every time you complete the Daily Ops objectives, you will receive some loot. Once per day, you will be able to claim even better rewards by finishing a Daily Op within certain time limits
---
Does this mean we can only do Daily Ops once per day, or does it mean we can do them multiple times but can only attempt the time-limited version once per day?
---
I think Armor Ace is gonna be the Hubris Comics version of Iron Man
---
I see
---
Fissure Prime has a lot of crimson
---
Exactly. I fall into both categories lmao
---
Yeah it‚Äôs really annoying and I shouldn‚Äôt have to do it.
---
the other guys comment had a lot more hope then this one...his showed a life where hes still gaming with some little stuff that helps, then you come along with "boom double hand Carpeo Tunnel. lmao
---
That‚Äôs imprinted in my brain
---
only used with the plans you buy from the settlers or raiders or regs
---
I deleted after Wastelanders and am glad I didn't get sucked into SCORE.  My overall conclusion on post-storyline gameplay was "there's no 'there' there"
---
This is more or less what I've tried to tell people in individual replies for a while here, but as you can see from your own post, telling somebody that what they are doing is wrong does not tend to go well here. The biggest telltale signs for me come from checking the front page of this sub. When we are in the middle of game-breaking issues like FPS drops, getting locked in PA frames, constant server crashes, or that inventory stealing hack last winter, you still see front page posts asking for atom shop emotes or more insignificant shit like that. I think that touches on what you mentioned as dislocation from reality, especially when mixed with the mostly fake stories. 
---
Probably my biggest issue with it is the massive rise in support of cheating these last few months. It used to be unheard of in the first year and a half of the game, but somewhere in the time right before wastelanders dropped, it apparently became perfectly acceptable to tell new players to try to find dupers' stashes of plans and legendaries. Even plenty of posts asking for/offering thousands of duped handmade gifts to players or thanking people for dropping hundreds/thousands of obviously cheated gifts at their camp. I get that the grind in this game can feel like a chore, but that's literally what a game like this is made for. It's not like there is a real end-game here, it's just grinding the same old things over and over, and even that gets ruined by people who want their shiny toys here and now.
---
Not sure what the point of this is, it's sort of just rephrasing what you already said in your post. Maybe it will help, maybe not. I know I've contributed to some of the toxicity going on here, but I would still like to think that I've at least done my best to lead people away from these kinds of issues that kill off the game and playerbase in a more insidious manner
---
You use them to craft certain legendary weapons or armor. Gauss Weapons and Secret Service armor, once you've purchased those plans from those Gold Bullion vendors.
---
Those fast travels are already free? You can select your teammate and fast travel back to them for free.
---
I have the same problem
---
You use Legendary Modules to craft certain weapons and armor; specifically the ones from the old Vault Raids and now the ones you can buy with Gold Bullion, like the Gauss Shotgun or the Secret Service Armor.
---
You can craft Fixers, just not legendary versions.  And that doesn‚Äôt use any modules.
---
They're used to craft the secret service armor and the new guns. Basically all the stuff you buy for gold bullion. You can't craft legendary fixers, they can only come from the purveyor.
---
Ah, my Arktos lab coat :)
---
Okay that makes sense. Really glad that I didnt buy 6 modules already. lmao.. Thank you!
---
Heavy gunner pa with an actually good weapon is so much better.  You can't mow down a horde of enemies with a sniper rifle.
---
It's still a large amount of micromanagement that in my opinion is not worth it. I'm a high level player, at the scrip cap most of the time because I can't be bothered to server hop dozens of times to get my vault steel, so I just come pick some up every time I log on and I usually end up getting more scrip from the daily playing than I spent. Already got some double digit number of legendary modules taking up space too, and I've long ago gotten all the legendaries I'd ever want to roll for. This is only really useful to new players or people trying to start a new build
---
The SBQ would be undoable without this resource, fo real
---
tl:dr it was a low number and people complained, now it's an even lower number
---
Part of the ship. Part of the crew
---
I ain't using nukes too much in general but if I do use it on some griefer or anybody else that pissed me off enough to deserve it. It isnt even such a big threat imo, because you can just look at the map and if you see someone's nuking you, you have 2 minutes to quit the server so it's easy to avoid imo. I have also put away the vendor in my camp so if griefers or somebody who wants revenge on me for whatever reason don't see it so it doesn't happen in the first place because I don't wanna leave the server if I don't have to.
---
Fuck.
---
Alright for PP there are 2 things you can do, you can deactivate the AI running the experiment by going into the basement behind the locked door. the code to this door is 970930, at the very bottom floor of this space is a room with a computer bank terminal that, as soon as food collection has started, has a shutdown code in it. Take this code to the terminal where you begin PP and you can shut down the AI. This will switch who is running the experiment and administer Formula Q instead of P, Formula Q heals the animals after every wave.   
---
Secondly, there is a charisma perk that causes fire weapons to heal allies, use a shishkebab to attack the friendly animals and top of their health. IMPORTANT NOTE! This works with the Brahmin in Free Range and on the miners in Radiation Rumble. (It also worked on the robots in Fastnacht and most escort style missions, so if you are running support keep it in mind.)
---
They need to remove item levels now too. If enemies are scaling automatically, weapons should too. Sure, keep a minimum required level for use on some, but we shouldn't have to find or craft a new version of the same gun every 5 or 10 levels
---
Told them, been ignored. I die a lot because while it's in its zoomed in state you can't swap a weapon, reload, use a stimpack or sprint. Sure its an easy fix to holster it and bring out again but somethings I'm not happy just ignoring and finding a workaround for something not working as intended.
---
Still... Its an awesome gun right?
---
Jokes on you im fictional.
---
ah, good to know! thanks!
---
Lowered it from 30, if we're being technical.
---
Glad to hear that!
---
I actually laughed out loud. Thank you for this lmao
---
That‚Äôs literally one of the easiest things to do though, after taking a picture and setting your camp down.
---
I've had 3 weightless axes that were 3 stars I still have the one
---
I made one of the fated ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving posts‚Äù a few weeks ago and of course I came back because I love the game so much and there‚Äôs still a lot I haven‚Äôt done. I deleted my post and kinda regret it lmao
---
hi felicia
---
Reads like multiple Ops per day, with one premium, timed Op each day.
---
There was some bugged foliage on the ground but I didn't think too much of it and stepped right in the trap and fell to my death, but at the time I wasn't even aware of people who using a trap camp to farm scrap.
---
Ultra-lite Weightless Scout Armour however... Is truly weightless
---
No way! While I think it would be beneficial, you got to think about all of the people who would give a bad rating bc of pvp situations. Lower level folks would never get off the ground. We already have to deal with people judging us in every aspect of our lives. I don‚Äôt want it in my video games!
---
Can they not spawn in concrete üòÇ ?
---
Ya know, recently I had been thinking of making some serious changes to diet, exercise, and a few bad habits that persisted past 25. The thoughts were coming from other health issues that I will say were self inflicted, and also after watching my mom fight with COPD up until May. I really have to say this comment really just may have drilled it home for me. Thank You.
---
No it's not, even they don't do that much damage, might have been melee though
---
It seems like Flatwoods is never chosen anymore. I‚Äôve only played it 3-4 times throughout every NW challenge I‚Äôve done for the season, and every single time it only won because our votes were tied and zax picked it
---
Or if you could outright sell your camp all together. Atom shop items would be the big problem with both of these ideas though.
---
Same here bud, gotta be picky with this now i suppose
---
And you didn‚Äôt inform me, someone you certainly don‚Äôt know and have never met, before everyone else?! I‚Äôm insulted.
---
Doesn't Formula Q make the animals aggressive instead of timid?
---
It seems weird to be bummed at the prospect of not being able to pick on level 10 wolves with a high level character.  
---
I‚Äôd much rather have an entire map that‚Äôs worth farming.  With max level enemies, I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôll spend a LOT more time in Grafton and Lewisburg and care about events like Jail Break and Tea Time.
---
I wish she had more to say. I really liked her quests and storyline
---
Scout armor is treated as sturdy, it has no heavy variant
---
It‚Äôs not about people playing the way I want, being stealthy/making it to the later rounds before engaging is a valid tactic.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have to play nw just to unlock stuff, keep it separate and everyone is happy, pve players don‚Äôt have to afk, and pvp players get lobby‚Äôs without people hiding with no intention of combat. 
---
If the devs see posts like these then it‚Äôs just tellling them it‚Äôs ok to keep it as is, do you want to spend your time afk ? You could be enjoying the main game
---
NPCs corpse gets replaced by bags when the corpse disappear.
---
I did too. This is great.
---
Idea, fissure site prime as a map. Its Surrounding locations are divided between a couple of forts and underground passages, so players will be forced to go in the tunnels to scavenge or occupy the small BOS forts that are left out. Lastly, whoever nukes the fissure site prime, will summon the scorchbeast queen, which will be an immortal threat that will be very annoying and spawns loads of enemies constantly throughout the map. This would be great for kill x creatures in NW.
---
Human NPCs like Mothman Cultists or Blood Eagles leave paper bags instead of meat piles when their corpses despawn.
---
Will add thanks. Yeah I'm starting to get into the end game ish. I have full set of unyielding,  bloodied rifle, and full set of power armor. Nothing amazing like secret service yet but I can hold my own  on most things.
---
Reference to The Fall of 76 and how overpriced things were (and are) in the atom shop. It had to do with the Canvas bag from the Power Armor edition, it was instead a nylon bag and Bethesda's response was giving players 500 of atoms (worth 5 dollars, over 200 dollars from the PA edition), and the cheapest item during that time was the Light Wood Laminate which was 400 atoms.
---
I actually have a copy of that double feature cartridge within reach at the moment, and duck hunt was amazing when I was 6 and 7 (late 90s so not that long ago) but I can assume that it was pretty revolutionary for it's time when it was released
---
Our healthcare is FUBAR because of government overreach and unnecessary regulations. FEE (Foundation for Economic Education) did a wonderful video on the reasons and decent solutions to solving the problem. 
---
Also I was merely stating the fact that in most free market societies, the drive to produce a more cost effective and better product allowed for such innovations that in the 80's two tvs or a microwave or even a VHS player were high priced luxuries. Nowadays, because of entrepreneurial drive, they're cheaper than ever
---
If you want a food view you should take a look along the cliffs overlooking the cranberry bog as you come through the Savage divide, this can provide a wonderful view of Watoga and future nukes.
---
i own several legacy guns
---
and for this reason i want them wiped from the game
---
i carry a level 50 combat shotgun for events (unless its SBQ) - everyone deserves a hit on enemies.
---
I'm the guy who uses the follow me emote when i see a legendary.
---
I'm placing bets on another double XP by the time the season is over. Maybe the last weekend of the season.
---
Its a tough choice, but Flatwoods is gonna have to be my no.1
---
Bold choice
---
Thank you for the clarification! I appreciate it.
---
I would actually enjoy that.  Been a while since I‚Äôve battled a mothman in the wild let alone a legendary one...
---
Little comedy to get us through Beth Drama, very welcome!

I really expected this to be something that advanced horticulture or agriculture badges on tadpoles quest line would have unlocked. 
---
If I can learn how to build a fusion reactor, I should be able to figure out the basic process of replanting a flower. 
---
I definitely think it should require a lot of effort to unlock because easy farming of certain plants can get OP easy, but it would be nice if it was at least possible for people willing to put in that grind.
---
I think some type of buff based off negative mutation effects would be balanced. Means using class freak decreases damage as well as mutations negative effects
---
I love these posts.
---
I like the idea of having weapons and armor auto scale to your level. In theory, you get start the game out with the first weapon you picked up and finish the game with that same weapon.
---
It's certainly not for everyone
---
This does not change much in my opinion, and the healing is invaluable if you have more than one active animal friend and no other healers. Formula Q gives like 1/4 of a health bar refill at the end of each wave. I have been in rounds with and without Q and most animals get flattened by the Alpha just as quickly.
---
I like playing the drums, while people kill squirrels!
---
Same man. I've played every NW challenge so far (haven't passed em all), and have only gotten Flatwoods a handful of times. I even vote for it every time to try and break up the monotony!
---
Yea, I noticed the same thing with the queen...and her minions, too.
---
Over the year I cited, the 3 of us over 200 have leapfrogged who is the highest level in the group.  Regardless of who that is, the mob always seemed to go after that player first.
---
Oh ok, guess we‚Äôll discount the over 300 topics since Seasons launch on June 30th because u/LKDlk said it wasn‚Äôt a grind.

I would rather they broke out a few more things in the CAMP vendor summary.  For example, breakout Outfits and Serums into their own categories.

Someone else suggested the following a while back.  it still doesn't address the Serum issue (should never be under Misc, I'd rather them be under Meds) but it's not bad:

I agree...The Institute takes the cake for me on flawed logic, Brotherhood was close second. Tbh I never did much with the rest of the groups but I'm making a return trip to the older fallouts over the next couple days so we'll see where I stand.
---
I got one if you still need it

It sounds like enemies will scale within their usual range, so I would guess most will cap around 68 like before. And the same applies to the lower end of the range, meaning no deathclaws below level 21. Or at least that is my impression from how the system has been described so far.
---
Post starts with "Look." 
---
No one tells me what to do!
---
*leaves post*
---
what platform ?
---
I'm really tired of the insane pogo legs bug that make the entire screen bounce up and down when you stop running. Can you at least just fix that, for God's sake?
---
And when you nuke the event you get irradiated giant moth man who has a chance to drop ultra rare plans/materials for mothman armor
---
Alright but I was quite sure it was a lot of junk if I remember but anyway , thanks for the answer

Seeker¬†Rachel West¬†caught up with Olivia's plan. Backed into a corner, Olivia fought back. As the greatest of the Order's assassins, she slaughtered her way through the ranks of the Order - killing even her father,¬†Frederick Rivers¬†- before finally leaving her mother a parting message, inviting her to one last meeting in the¬†Savage Divide, in their special place.

Fish lamp and cat backpack
---
No it is complete trash.
---
Damn, lol
---
How you be telling us this without showing it?
---
Other than taking a cool picture, I recently discovered there's another bonus at the end.
---
You can "commune" with the wise mothman, which gives you +5% XP for an hour.
---
If it does the same thing tomoz I‚Äôll raise a ticket
---
Same. I also like that maxed perk cards will have animations.
---
on PC

Fallout 76 is like a box full of random puzzle pieces and Bethesda is the angry kid trying to mash the pieces together even though they don't work.
---
Yes! PSN?
---
More like a overall rating, like visuals, placement, aesthetics, not only trading. That's what I have in mind.
---
I'd rather have the XP bonus for communing with the wise one. :)  Worth more in the long run, methinks.
---
I have a vats centered crit build that uses western revolvers. It‚Äôs not a god-tier build or anything but I can kill deathclaws and scorchbeasts with no problem at all. Can‚Äôt do anything against invisible assaultrons though...
---
That‚Äôs a neat idea. Like a battle shop instead of workshop. Still could be used for resources but with the chance of a higher payout bonus.
---
If it is the same system as ESO then yeah...you have to use your top weapons/armour all the time really. No more encountering pesky low level creatures or scorched...everything will be scaled up to be a fight all the time.
---
I don't mind it for ESO since you essentially have unlimited ammo...use a sword/bow/magic it's not so bad. But in F76 where you have ammo issues I think it could be a real pain.
---
Have you considered using Bear Stairs in your camp?

Well then, it sucks in seeing this 5 days later but everytime I use this comment I will be correcting my statement to, "I've been playing since Morrowind but I know a guy who started on Elder Scrolls: Arena back in 94 when I was 3, theyve been specializing in bugs since then, just not fixing them" lmao
---
Thats every Bethesda game since they started tho.
---
This is a pretty damn good idea.üëç
---
Every time I look at 76 in my game archive I say to myself ‚Äútoday?  No, next month‚Äù.
---
Someday I‚Äôll return to the wastes and enjoy my role playing ass off.  But not today.
---
The tree bug seems to happen with a lot of things.
---
still at 800/800 cant figure it out. I have the damn fallout first scrap box and everything.
---
I either don‚Äôt vote because I‚Äôm lazy or I forget, or I vote for Morgantown because it‚Äôs better
---
And.. where is the problem? You can continue playing normally, you can't?
---
Well I'm down to help you out! Do you have discord, too?
---
I'd love to have some Legacy type maps, some stuff from 3, 4, NV. Make it a computer simulation or some such to make it make sense in lore if you have to I don't care, would just be fun.
---
Didnt nukacrypt take over enclavedb.net ?
---
Congrats!
---
But I have to ask if you know about cave fungus soup?
---
It's a creepy looking thing, that's for sure!  I haven't really went out of my way to find it but reading that article didn't enthuse me to do so either.   I can only imagine finding it in the cranberry forest as when your farming it's just pollen all over the place seriously restricting vision, I'd of flung a keyboard, controller, chair and up to two cats at the screen.
---
I'm not saying I believe in Love, or Fate...
---
&gt; cave fungus soup
---
Doesn't the commie collectron gather that?
---
wow...good find.
---
now don't make the mistake I did, and start making tons of Fixers thinking you can scrap them for mods..
---
I ended up buying a second account for an easier, more reliable way to bank items. Mostly because, as you said, it's a lot of hassle.
---
Totally worth buying a second account over spending money on 1st. Provided it's on sale
---
Ah I need cobalt. Morgantown it is.  Thanks!
---
The legendary run is entering to final days and people begins to cry. If you don't like it is simply, continue playing as before it.. I don't understand where is the problem..
---
That's cool! I make lots of Fixers. They sell well.
---
Yup, I don‚Äôt even play NW.

Still on track, nothing has changed.

I finally decided to get the game around 2 weeks ago after being a giant fallout fan since 3. I got my friends to get it as well. I am having a blast I have been playing a lot. I'm lvl 83 and love the game so far, and don't plan on leaving.     So yes I'm also staying!!!
---
depends on which flora you want/need, and how much HRF (and the other required mats)  you already have.
---
Watoga and toxic valley have huge amounts of violet, but are short on the others.
---
Depending on where you hit, toxic valley may not have many critters for the other mats.  But is also has a different set of enemies than most of the other places.
---
Whitespings and Morgantown both have lots of cobalt, but very little violet.  WS has more ghouls from which to extract the other mats.
---
WS also has large amount of Crimson, yellowcake, and flourescent.
---
What flora you pick and don't stabilize turns inert, but inert flux is drinkable - and it weighs less than purified water.
---
Oh just chill out and stop telling people how to post or feel.  You are 100% right I am tired of playing right now.  Burnt out with this race.  But that doesn't excuse you from being a complete doucenozzle.
---
Something something fudging numbers dupers everything sucks
---
Oh, that makes sense! Overall good idea from you! Love the concept!
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/
---
Enjoy!
---
Right behind ya.
---
You go into them knowing that you're going to be gimping yourself to some degree, but that's what makes them fun.
---
Being Bloodied, and especially having stealth, can make up for the lack of damage (and armor penetration) compared to other builds.  But it also makes Agility a very crowded stat.  You simply won't be able to afford all the Gunslinger perks, but you can take the first rank of each.  And it will be sufficient to 1 or 2-shot most things and get credit for the SBQ.
---
I find lots of violet flux around Fissure Prime. They're the ferns under each copse of trees.
---
My biggest concern with one wasteland is that no longer can a higher level character go along with a low level one and just kind of help them a bit here and there. Currently a friend went to Deathclaw island on the mission for the first time...I came along because he was level 15 (I was 105), just in case he got into trouble. Sure enough a level 21 DC popped up and started on him, he was in trouble instantly and I was able to jump in and kill it quick to help keep him alive. He got some hits in for the xp, learned how dangerous they can be, finished the mission. What happens next time...if I jump in to help I'm now fighting a max level Deathclaw that's going to be a major fight, will I be able to help him in time or will it turn into a brawl where he's doing as much damage relative to his level so he keeps agro and gets slaughtered.
---
The other issue is ammo. For gun characters they could explore the lower level areas with lesser weapons and not have to worry about always needing their biggest guns all the time...now every enemy is a bigger threat that will need your top weapons wherever you go. This is going to mean a lot of players will have to start using a lot more ammo wherever they happen to go.
---
thought they were ready to use. When should we expect them?
---
Ima turd floating in this toilet called appalachia!  For life!
---
You can spam stims at full hp. You can start spamming quantums before you even get out of cover and be healing as you start taking damage.
---
I thought the PVP meta was Gamma Gun, cause you can't do anything for the rads.
---
This.
---
I believe it's short combat rifles that scrap for mods.
---
Wavy Willard Scorched drop them.
---
yes two username in game
---
(go to social tab, sometimes it's bugged you have to add us too)
---
edit: good i see you
---
Agreed, the spammy missles aren't helpful, they obstruct my view rather than help.
---
Yeah, a lot of people miss that one.
---
I found one once in the cranberry bog(?) after the SBQ fight in the pink forest by that creepy-ass house. Me and like one other dude had to shoot it in the face for quite some time because it was luckily either glitched in the trees or bad AI. Either way, it didn't drop anything spectacular for the ammo it cost. Was still awesome to see a new enemy though.
---
I just got level 300 and levelling up everyday is starting to become more and more problematic.
---
And the bobblehead one yesterday I just didn't bother with. I dont find it fun loading in different areas for 5 seconds hoping a bobblehead had spawned.
---
Hopefully they keep adding new boss fights
---
90% of the people that use them in PvP are terrible enough that I can still kill them before they kill me. If someone actually has a decent build you just get staggered to death while you armor gets destroyed. It's a real blast.
---
I‚Äôm on ps4, that axe sounds tight but I have a bloodied rocketed (i think) sledgehammer it‚Äôs only a 2 star though
---
Nah. Not even going to claim it.
---
There‚Äôs many legendary effects that no one wants, but to the developers they serve to keep the pool diluted and stretch out the grind.
---
Still being tested, no release date announced yet.
---
wow,  250?   I have been looking for that plan for ages, and the cheapest i have ever seen was 12,000 caps.    no way id pay that for it.  
---
Is it crazy high on XBOX or am i just really unlucky?
---
I sell mine for 300, and they always sell, the amount of effort that goes into crafting them is worth alot more then 100 caps each.
---
It really allows stealth combat tactics/sneaking. I don't bush camp, but I will try to kill 2 players at once vs myself and this is a map that makes it possible.
---
Morgan town is so out in the open, playing solo is super difficult to do.
---
God it‚Äôs was always the roofs for no other reason then to ruin an hour or two long build
---
Can you hang anything else on the banner pole in front of the BoS sign? Maybe an American flag or some such?
---
Doesn‚Äôt the Enclave have the officer outfit, the X-01 armour, and the scout armours?
---
My diet consists of Corn Soup, Brain Fungus Soup and Cranberry Relish. Yummy XP.
---
I wear excavator. I look like Big Bird because I dress like Big Bird and I feel like Big Bird. Stay calm and dress like Big Bird.
---
I use a power armored bloody heavy weapons build at about 19% health, and I'm VERY hard to kill if I'm not careless. The SBQ can hit me in the face and I take like 2 damage, explosions and fire tickle, and I can melt everything that dares stand against me. Once legendary perks come out, its going to be even more powerful. Here is what I run:
---
T-65 Power Armor with Emergency Protocols, Targeting HUD, Calibrated Shocks
---
Mutations: Adrenal Reaction, Eagle Eyes, Bird Bones, Marsupial, Egg Head, Scaly Skin, Speed Demon, Herd Mentality
---
Strength Perks: Blocker 3, Heavy Gunner 3, EXHeavy Gunner 3, MHeavy Gunner 3, Bear Arms 3
---
Endurance Perks: Fireproof 3, Radicool
---
Charisma Perks: Strange in numbers 1, Tenderizer 1, Magnetic Personality 2
---
Intelligence Perks: Nerd Rage 3, Stabilized 3, Demolitions 5, Batteries Included 3, Scrapper
---
Agility Perks: Dodgy 3, Action Boy 3, Thru Hiker 1
---
Luck Perks: Bloody Mess 3, Class Freak 3, Starched Genes 2
---
The events comes out on the 18. No perks yet
---
Okay, that‚Äôs fair. I also like it because of the bridge. It adds really fun tactics and opportunities.
---
Most people leave their commie tron unlocked (as they should) so I've been able to get a bunch of stuff from them when hungry/thirsty.

---
I‚Äôd keep the BSS +1S if I were you
---
Okay, that‚Äôs super fair. I like it because it adds different elements to game play.
---
No camp items, Enclave plasma rifles and pistols can‚Äôt be legendary, no Enclave skins for the X-01 or other PAs, no field BDUs, no flag, etc.
---
Compared to all the other factions, we got next to nothing.
---
Theyre more capable than Bethesda
---
I second this. Many trap camps are actually quite ingenious...however if the "trap" is simply deleting the floor, that's not a clever design. The bigger question IMHO is whether the trap camp owner allows you to reclaim your junk? If yes, the camp owner was showcasing his build. If no, the camp owner was being a douche.
---
Lvl 50 mole rat horde
---
Yeah me too
---
get pharma farma in luck. and you'll be swimming in meds. morgantown airport has quite a few med containers to search.
---
I second that!
---
Seems to be crazy high. I've bought the plans twice - once for 12k and the other for 9k - they seem to hold that value on Xbox. Of course then after I bought the second plan for my alt, someone dropped me the plan for free cuz they thought I was a noob so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Why not both?  They‚Äôll stack.

Staying with you

I don‚Äôt care about a leaving post I would like to see others trying to get everyone else off though
---
I have no idea what you are asking
---
Get the perk that gives you a chance to get extra med supplies when looting first aid boxes then just run around the map looting first aid boxes
---
Dumbest justification you could've come up with
---
Hell 1000 is good. I paid 15k for my first fixer plan...ages ago
---
i was there at 15 getting the rewards. lots of crits to the face with a crafted handmade.
---
The Cryolator works like the Vampire effect where every hit commits a fixed amount of "freeze," regardless of how damaging the hit was.  Therefore, Quad is the best prefix for this.
---
I paid 15 about four or five months ago
---
I had heard they were ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù but the community said they were underwhelming so they went back and are reworking them.
---
Fire + meat = cooked meat, no need to be on the camp for that.
---
I‚Äôm having the same problem for whatever reason.
---
However, it‚Äôs gotten ever so slightly better recently, and it‚Äôs continuing to do so.
---
Yeah, the last fight I had the guy just sat in the open spraying at me with a laser. His aim was terrible. After spamming some nuka colas and jumping in circles around him I just let him kill me and was done with it. I've fought a few people that used nuka cola builds that actually knew how to fight and aim, and still had fun. Too many people think spray and prey quantum spamming makes them good. I fought a guy that used a bloodied fixer semi auto and he was a good challenge. His aim was on point and he killed me several times. It was the best fight I have had in a while.
---
I prefer my owl nuggets with a side of kitty jerky
---
I kind of suspected it's loot table wouldn't be anything mind blowing.  Bethesda hasn't really created a true tiered end game loot system like a MMO would use.  Obviously the newer patches have better stuff but once you unlock it, it just adds it to drop table for the bad guy rather than replaces some of the original legendary loot.
---
I think it'd be fun to at least see and fight once.  It's kind of like seeing some of the other rare beasties like an aggressive mothman, flatwoods monster, and some of the others.
---
Your first fallout game?? Terrible luck to have to worst one as your first.
---
Try FO4/FO3/FONV and then come back to thank me.
---
Vanilla FO3 is enough to make you never go back to Appalachia.
---
hey, if you want some help.
---

just ask. (not vocal, most of time no sound)
---
Holy shit, someone said it and isn't in the negatives.
---
I'll never forget the one time someone other than me said they didn't hadn't experienced the 76 community being as nice as they claim and naturally they were hounded by comments blaming them.
---
Ie, we downvoted you and called you names because we're the nice ones so we don't deserve to be told we're less good than we say
---
As many times as I've gone to valley galleria looking for vacuum tubes, I kind of think they should do a smaller scale Team Deathmatch type mode in some of these interior spaces. Watoga underground would be great too
---
Here is the Flux map.  The best nuke location for Crimson seems to be near Sparse Sundew Grove or Superior Sunset Farm.  They should yield more raw Crimson flux per run.  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/rD71jgz.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/rD71jgz.jpeg)
---
Remember to use Green Thumb.  You will need 10x raw flux and 1x of each Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass, and High-Radiation Fluids to make 1x stable flux.
---
That being said, there is almost as much Crimson Flux as Violet flux in the nuke area for the queen and it's easy to server hop and get several runs in.  So, in terms of efficiency, server hopping the Queen area would be a good option.
---
Another option would be to use multiple characters to get several runs in.  On a private world, you just leave and rejoin with each character.  To do this in a public world, do your flux run, join a public team, then press the PS button and close application, do not leave the world first.  Then re-launch Fallout.  You will get the option to "Join Team" and on the same screen you can switch characters.  This way you can use more than one character to farm the same Nuke zone on the same public world.
---
I never made it past the first stage lol
---
added you :)
---
Look around Mama Dolce, there are a bunch of cobalt plants there.
---
Cultists are pretty generous when it comes to stims. Lucky Hole mine works for me.
---
Main problem for me is that the internet in general and gamers for damn sure rage about everything, EVERYTHING! Good examples would be the release of Alatreon in Monster Hunter World and every single change to Fallout 76. The minute these updates go live everyone runs to their favorite comments section to rage about how horrible everything is and how broken it all is and how the update ruined the game. 
---
Monster Hunter was review bombed on stream because of Alatreon. For those unaware; Alatreon is one of the legendary black dragons, THE most powerful entities in the game world. Black dragons are the be all end all, endgame, master hunter fights. They're brutally hard, punishing as hell and a badge of honor when beaten and the game was review bombed the weekend it released because it was hard and people had to adjust their builds and approach to the fight to win. People couldn't go in with their generic meta builds and beat it day one so they had a fucking tantrum!
---
It is incredibly tiresome to sift through all of the entitled whining asshats that come out of the woodwork after an update. It has gotten to the point where there is so much rage and so much backlash that it loses all meaning. It's no longer "players are mad, we must have screwed up" and has become "here they go whining again." I will take pretty pictures and cute stories over the childish, spoiled bratty b.s. that inevitably follows any change to a game.
---
C O L L E C T E D
---
Yes. Which is strange, because Bethesda never listens to our feedback /s
---
Oh yeah, you forget when you do not have to do that flux gathering weekly.
---
In addition to the suggestions to use Pharma Farma, once you know the Stimpak Recipe you can make your own from Tick Blood and other components. 
---
The event ‚ÄòTea Time‚Äô has a lot of ticks that show up, so I do that event whenever I can. 
---
Even with keeping my vendors stocked with about 50 Stimpaks for sale, I still have over 250 on me at any given time. 
---
The Chemist and Super Duper perks are very helpful when crafting Stims &amp; Chems.
---
Have you ever encountered the random raider NPC who's gutting a radstag and offers you some meat? If you ask for something other than radstag she gives you a cat steak lol.
---
Bulk and sell
---
Works now so it‚Äôs fixed üëå
---
Days. If it were even one week, the build community posts would comprise the front page
---
The Enclave gets Hellfire armour too. And I‚Äôm pretty sure the standard X-01 *is* the Enclave skin.
---
But considering that the Enclave is kinda a secret, you probably don‚Äôt want to advertise that all over your CAMP or body. It makes sense to not have a lot of cosmetics associated with the Enclave.
---
Check, check, and done!
---
Almost done with my megabase, figured this out while building. Ill post when its all finished :)
---
*Any* content gated behind NW is TRASH.
---
You can cook just about anywhere. Outdoor spits and fires are everywhere.
---
Also you can sort your Aid inventory tab by spoilage.
---
I wouldn't downvote you...but was someone mean to you?
---
Show us on the teddy-fear where the bad scorched touched you.
---
Many players look for the best in what we have. Yes it's a glitchy game but it is giving players a chance to have a bit of a fallout community. Some high level players spend all their time sneaking around looking for unsuspecting low level players to bump off at workshops but others spend their time helping others out.
---
Ultimately if we are nothing but harsh and negative ALL the time then not only does nothing get fixed (like they'll be listening) but then you also become a serious downer on the community and very quickly burn out. 
---
Positive players aren't necessarily pretending everything is fine...they're just not being overly negative and support the parts that Beth may have gotten right. All negativity all the time would get really old fast don't you think?
---
Great bargain, I sell them for 10k and they don't sit in my vendor long
---
I hate this is the only content to do really it would be better as the sidr objective imo
---
I was 1000% against bloodied before I got a B25FFR90WR Handmade thats max level.
---
I gave it a try and im kinda liking it now. Only main thing that sucks is im used to being a tank but on this character I cant do that.
---
there is no such thing as extra junk :)
---
Ayyyye! We did get the concrete after all!
---
Current average price is around 10k, so you definitely found it for a great deal. 
---
Hell, for 1000 I‚Äôd probably buy them just to give away to new players.
---
The fist is already quite light with Martial Artist, so STR one.
---
I craft stuff to sell or learn weapon mods. Radium rifles are a good junk sink for learning mods. I craft ammo, serums and shielded underarmor to sell then buy plans I don't know. If you are feeling charitable you can always craft gear for new players. The recon rifle is a pretty nice starter weapon for that.
---
I wish the event went differently every time, sometimes you'd get the wise mothman, sometimes a hostile mothman or even a horde of mothman cultists attempt to take the lighthouse and you have to defend against waves. Anything to change up the monotony lol
---
I mean its obviously not optimal but my level 100 gunslinger does just fine certainly viable
---
And it isn't a good one, but killing everything off before people can get their tags in is still detrimental to other players
---
Apparently we did complete it.
---
lol did not know this
---
I hate it when ive just claimed a workshop and now I have to defend it against 4 waves of dogs.
---
Not looking forward to to the air bot that has the nuclear launch codes to get buffed.  That thing is already a pain in the ass (with my build)
---
Right, but after that?  Or anything else to do with it that‚Äôs at least entertaining.  I can get all my caps daily from vendors just from selling excess chems, purified water, and yes some bulk scrap to vendors. I even put some on to sell to players but usually only stuff needed to make ammo really moves - I have never seen people buy things like cork, waste oil, bone, etc.  
---
So then what, more comes in a day than I can sell.  Short of just dropping it all on the ground, I‚Äôm trying to find any reasonable suggestions.  
---
I know Im not in a unique boat that once I‚Äôve done my main things to do I‚Äôm pretty much done for the day, but just grasping at straws I guess here
---
1-9 should be Morgantown, because people almost never play flatwoods even though I prefer it.
---
Much like in real life, the best move is to be a carnivore...
---
I know people hate nerfs, and I do think certain playstyles like pistols need to be buffed, but there comes a point where you have to accept that one specific build is dominating the meta by a wide margin, and "buff everything else up to its level!" is just suggesting more work to make the game even *less* balanced. 
---
You could delete Unyielding from the game and low-health builds would still have the highest DPS in the game; I don't think they need to go *that* far, but Unyielding is what needs to be hit IMO. All that SPECIAL gives massive gains for melee, stealth, and VATS builds, and the XP boost from having so much INT is becoming more and more valuable now that there's SCORE and the upcoming legendary perks.
---
To be fair I did play this game everyday for about 2 weeks when it came out eventhough id get kicked off of it with a blue screen everytime so it wasn‚Äôt SO bad it kept me entertained for a few weeks
---
you can get 1000's of free caps, 100's of legendary scrip, 100's of gold bullion, plus dozens of unique camp items, outfits, and weapon skins, all for just playing the game like you would  normally, i wouldn't say its pointless
---
Fair enough
---
No lol, I'd never turn down stag meat, so glad you told me
---
It seems to be pretty good on Shotguns these days
---
The BSS +Str is perfect for the powerfist. BSS90 is better for the deathclaw gauntlet and mole miner gauntlet since the are so heavy.
---
Flex tape can't fix that
---
Been running that but wanna try something new after 2k ingame hours üòÅ
---
Needs more weapon variety. Last time I tried a pistol build I gave up around level 60 due to getting bored of using like 3 different .44s and a western revolver.
---
Thank u , got to study that üëç
---
Which is a bit ironic because most of the other DLC guns from Fallout 4 tend to be the best-in-class at what they do (at least, until the Wastelanders Bullion stuff was added).
---
I guess in 4, it was balanced by the tediousness of not having their ammo readily available in the Commonwealth.
---
I log in every day only for whatching my legacy camp, then i play a little.
---
Desert ghillie varieties. Lol
---
As much as I would love to see factions and faction warfare the pvp system needs to be burned to the ground and reconstructed from the ground up before that can happen. If it isn't whatever they do is doomed to fail.
---
I mean, there was a system that was very similar in terms of challenges but gave more atoms not long ago...
---
The game isn't in a great spot, people want to point out that the game isn't in a great spot. Other people, want to disagree with them.
---
I believe the people who disagree just haven't played the game long enough and are enjoying it in the current state. The people who dislike the game have played for a while and were expecting much more at this stage in its life. 
---
If you dislike the game, stop playing it, move on to something you will enjoy.
---
If you like the game, keep playing it, and you will soon see why the other's moved on.  
---
I've personally moved on awhile ago, I am keeping an eye on the Reddit page just in case they do something awesome to bring me back though! From what I can see, that will probably never happen.
---
I see. I‚Äôve spent my last two days playing trying to not get the building to bug out at my camp, when I log on today I wonder if all the codes I‚Äôve collected will be gone? I was originally under the impression they stayed until you launch a nuke using them, thanks for the help
---
slap it in the vendor. i see junk in a vendor i am there. and unless it's REALLY overpriced i buy it.
---
I think there max level is 40. Imma look it up tho
---
Knowing the HRF are hard to acquire, I often hit up nuke zones just to collect/hoard the mats I need for stabilizing flux. I make the raw flux runs a separate trip.
---
Obviously, I'm not rolling in stable flux, but it eases the headache and the hustle of each run.
---
That's the impression I get as well.
---
Although it's a bit disappointing as this would suggest the game itself won't get more difficult for high-levels, it would theoretically mean more of the map is "relevant" to us... like going to Toxic Valley and having Lv. 68 Super Mutants.
---
You can hop events, run pharma farma and loot containers or farm ticks and craft them with chemist and super duper.
---
If I spend time on something I would not have spent on, in some form of routine that is a grind.
---
Grind is not hard, grind is repetitive. I think you're using a different definition than those people

I‚Äôve killed queens in less than 6 seconds with a magic minigun multiple times. She doesn‚Äôt even get to mutate to regen health it‚Äôs so fast.
---
.....which has happened many, many times, leading to " We have already had 100 posts about this" threads.
---
Me either.
---
A flag isnt worth it compared to an extra double score weekend.
---
But somehow he's over here crying about killing people for chems when I'm out there killing people for 5 bullets and then eating them?
---
Agreed, I‚Äôm 48, playing games since pong. Don‚Äôt get the whole vintage game movement. I‚Äôm like ‚Äú that shit sucked when it was new‚Äù üòÇ#graphicjunkie
---
Oh there is, especially if you have 1st.  I‚Äôm sitting on hundreds, sometimes thousands, of some scrap because it just happened to come along with stuff I actually wanted.  
---
I mean, I have 536 bone shards, 350 springs, 252 screws, 1336 plastic, 1577 cloth, 430 antisceptic, and this is on an alt I have only got to level 100 recently. 
---
I can‚Äôt bulk it up and sell it faster than I end up gathering it. I‚Äôm just trying to find a reason to be ‚Äùexcited‚Äù to find scrap.  
---
This BOS event was the first time I actually was a bit hyped even if the rewards weren‚Äôt the great, simply because it was a place to dump stuff
---
Nope.
---
Sadly this visual bug still out there, no fix in 3 months, thanks bethesda.
---
If you're collecting more junk than you can sell in a day, then caps and junk are worthless to you, and you can just drop the shit you don't need.
---
You get given characters. You can't use your steam ones.
---
I was a little late to each console, I think I was like 4 to 6 when we got that console, gifted from my uncle when they got the SNES. So that was about the middle of the 90's. Lol
---
No trophies with mods though ü§¶üèª
---
If she lands I could see that.  It just tends to be that she doesn't land soon enough for me to kill her that quickly, but if I'm point blank headshotting her, than yes.
---
I'm staying for the simple fact even though it's a broken game with 101 flaws, I enjoy it
---
First and only time I ran into one was a vending trap. The guy warned me for some reason by using the no emote.
---
Went back and clicked on his vending machine in time and bought a nuka cola machine plan.
---
Im the ghost and watcher of the joint. Stay as long as you want.

"While it is incredibly unlikely that my thoughts will have any meaningful effect on the development of 76"
---
Are you saying there's a chance they could?
---
I can't get it to work that way.  I'm going to try again.
---
Ign: bigsiege will be on in a bit if you still need some help
---
Thanks for not contributing to the discussion!
---
Of course not they are cackling in the evil lair.
---
Its fallen into your world when a player clips through the world on the public servers üòÇ
---
Their prices are all over the place honestly.
---
The only thing that players do that effects tangible change at large is quit playing.
---
Bethesda, please add light and ultra-light options for the secret service armor with next weeks patch too.
---
I've been crafting stuff with legendary modules.
---
Previously was crafting weapons and scrapping them to learn mods.
---
So how does our camp defenses scale up?
---
As they are now you need 2 turrets to kill lvl 10 enemy. How will they fare when all enemies are lvl 58+?
---
It‚Äôs used to craft a unique armour. You get the plans from a vault.
---
I just love when I decide to be generous and play music the entire time so everyone else can get the kills and loot...but no one bothers to protect me so I just die over and over. I'm trying to do y'all a favor so maybe...idk, help keep me alive?
---
Used for solar/thorn armour or strangler heart pa
---
I guess I can do that, crafting the weapons to learn the mods. I suppose that‚Äôs as good a use of my scrap as any.  Though I‚Äôll need something to do once I‚Äôve learned all the learnable mods.  
---
I can also try making the weapons, not that I see a ton of newbies on PS4 (I hope it becomes a PS+ game soon, that would bring in some fresh faces)
---
Yeah. There's just no way that over 100 million cork has been donated when concrete was an absolute failure
---
To make it a truley unique fallout battle royal, they should build a massive vault for nw
---
***Cannot remove Fallout 76 as part of your life would be inaccessible***

Hot take
---
[Shitposting 100]
---
Happens all the freaking time...
---
Beth pls fixerinos.
---
The Hellfire is locked behind Level 100 in NW, so not really an option. 
---
As a monetization asset, the faction is a gold mine. Plenty of players out there would shell out atoms for real faction-wear. 
---
It's a huge missed opportunity.
---
I guess, I‚Äôm not really hurting for caps, but I guess I‚Äôll just have to try selling more of it.  Some things just never move, I had some things in my vendor for months and it never sold.
---
The only way I managed to reconcile him with my RP is by putting a slave collar on him and pretending he's my slave and I force him to do chems sometimes and say these stupid things to me because I think its ironically funny.
---
I highly doubt that any thoughts, ideas, or criticisms I post here will gain any attention from the development team. That being said, the Fallout player community does influence development to some degree, so I decided to just share my thoughts. I don‚Äôt expect anything to come from it, but I figured it was better than just being silent.
---
I changed to herbivore for the 20% XP from cranberry relish. Carnivore only provided 10%, as herbivore doubled the amount of XP from 10% to 20%.
---
I can help you get to grips later if you want
---
 GT DrUnknownShot.
---
I can help you make a VATS rifle build. At level 15 you couldn't of messed up your build. You don't really have the means too.
---
Edit, there's a bug that stopping you from completing that quest. Should be fix at some point.
---
Mind if I ask what level you are?
---
Hope the Legendary Perk Updates include more perks relevant to Power Armor
---
Does putting fences around them help? I just started so I don't know how practical it is to replace a walled off farming spot. What about raised farming plots?
---
Follow high levels around giving heart emotes and waving. You follow them long enough they'll drop 3 star weapons as incentive for you to leave. Then you take those weapons kill everything at white springs and that batta bang batta boom your gaining levels super fast.
---
I think the faction thing is easily solvable. 
---
Bethesda needs to create public factions just like the team system.  Just give different boosts and buffs for each one.
---
Basically join a lobby and either join or create a Responder/Raider/Enclave/Etc group.
---
Add in a few bases and such and maybe some community events like our current one for each faction.
---
Build up Flatwoods or Crater.
---
That's the point though. There is a massive uproar that disappears almost instantaneously. To paraphrase op, if you want something changed then you can't just move on when no action has been taken
---
For the sake of the Wise and benevolent Mothman, I shackle myself to Appalachia. After all, someone needs to preach his good word while destroying the heretical Cultists and the False Idol Mothmen.
---
While I would much rather have Bethesda fix the in-game bugs, I must admit, I do wish the Scorched got a rework. Early game they're difficult but once you get better gear and a somewhat decent build they're nothing more than a nuisance. Maybe make them like the Marked Men from New Vegas, have them start using armor, heavy weapons, power armor.  Heck have them coordinate with scorched creatures, imagine having to face scorched with .50 cals backed by a scorched deathclaw.
---
Yes but I have no budget haha, once I get the garden foundation I‚Äôm going to put them on my roof hopefully
---
I'd love a toxic Valley map, a reason to wear my white new years tux as camouflage.
---
Dayum. I don't, mostly because I struggle to get high rad fluids. I tend to nuke Morgantown if someone nukes SBQ. That way, Collision Course, Feed The People and Back On The Beat will often start &amp; somehow those robots in Mama Dolces carry high rad fluids &amp; hardened mass. LOL. Morgantow is a great place to nuke for the flux components. üëç
---
I'd be happy if we just had a cigar to chew on...think the sarge in Aliens. 
---
Doesn't need to be lit...just need it for the effect.
---
Start farming areas with blood eagles. They tend to always drop at least one per kill.
---
Tasty squirell stew is the carnivore equivalent. I also like mirelurk jerky for 70 DR, and smoked mirelurk filets for 60 carry weight. Although I'm sure those both have vegetarian equivalents.
---
ask if you want something
---
people are saying that because they think the game needs fixing. i'm actually staying away from the first season pass until it's fixed to casual levels. i can't spend every waking hour grinding some season pass. RDO released a season pass 2 weeks ago, and with all the disconnects and bugs, i have completed it already. a friend also did it with me, and he's also doing f76 season pass and he's not even close to half, and that guy is a grinder. anyway, i'm sorry that you are content with what you have, and giving bethesda all the more reason to keep the game shite, cause they'll think, look at these people still playing, so we just keep what we do, instead of, look all of these online player numbers, they are dwindling, we need to do something about it.
---
Margin town airport there's a lot of medkits there.
---
You can only do it with Bethesda launcher. It uses a snap shot of a character you already have so it doesn't count toward your alpha gaming character.
---
Did you know that revenant procs off life saving armor?
---
Pharmacist perk to boost radaway and your chinese armor should be enough. I use excavator power armor for carry weight boost. You should be able to hangout in the nuke zone. The Chinese armor is 1000 rad resist right?
---
I hope to do that to save time, just one big tower to plop anywhere.
---
No and nope. Soon though.
---
ive got a quad reduced weight gauss shotgun and its been my fav roll yet for that weapon since you can just spam the trigger in third person and have that huge clip so you dont run out of ammo
---
You aint using enough of it.
---
Yesterday, Raider punk gave me a quest to kill a mothman.
---
When I shot it, it fell over on it's side. Guessing I triggered a stagger or knockdown on it with a combat rifle shot.
---
You're welcome!
---
They are hit and miss.  There was so much negativity at launch that they are still digging out.  I just picked the game up thanks to GamePass (tried) and QuakeCon (bought on sale) and I‚Äôm really enjoying it even if it is a buggy mess at times.
---
Something similar happens with bows and 95% vats still miss so i would probably switch to the lead pipe since it's the only thing that works 100%
---
Ya .. there are many that entertain themselves qirg hating this game. It's not perfect,  but it is fun.
---
Most people want most legendary effects removed. Just take joy knowing bash dam is a magic effect so it makes your stuff more powerful.
---
That would certainly be terrifying.
---
I was just looking at a resource that was posted below. I wasn't aware of all the different types of XP bonuses, outside of cranberry relish and cobbler. Now I know.
---
PC sadly but I can upload some photos via chat if you'd like. It's a bunch of junk walls, cement tires, the trees from the legendary run, mothman totems and the new one, whose name I already forgot. Plus it had a bunch of the neon GO AWAY signs on it with the vault boy shooting targets around. Then a shitty little metal shack where the crafting tools are. Plus it's covered in punji boards, not to be a dick or kill people because well...I mean it's a raider camp.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
Either dupers, or false numbers.
---
But I don't see a reason why dupers would waste their time and materials on the rewards that are not worth it.
---
Well the fire engine and dump truck from whitespring are gone
---
All I‚Äôm saying is that the Enclave is secretive. Maybe it‚Äôs a missed opportunity for money‚Äôs sake, but it doesn‚Äôt make sense to advertise that you‚Äôre a part of the faction.
---
Cooking stations are readily found throughout Appalachia. Super Mutants, in particular, tend to have cooking spits at their fixed spawn locations.
---
I'm going to check this out.  I love watching nukes drop
---
At a certain point, you don‚Äôt even need to be bundling junk to sell to vendors. There are a lot of ways to get your 1400 daily caps.
---
For example, after I got the Treasure Hunter plans, I can craft the hat and it sells for 29 caps. It takes 3 Cloth and 1 Oil. 
---
I only need 48 hats to get 1392 caps. And using Super Duper 3, I can usually get there from 37 craftings.  So for 111 Cloth and 37 Oil, I‚Äôve cleared out a vendor‚Äôs caps. 
---
That‚Äôs if I don‚Äôt have a couple hundred purified waters to sell. 
---
Point being, you can get to where you don‚Äôt really need to sell raw or bulked junk to vendors anymore.
---
With FO1st, I might not need 25k Steel, but it‚Äôs quite comforting to have that just in case.
---
It's like they tried to kill two birds with one stone - cleaning up excess, unwanted perk cards while also having a system to benefit from them - but they didn't really think it through.
---
Like Venom, I have a lot of levels banked on my characters.  I like this because if I wanted to change direction on them or immediately rank up a card I want, I can.  But because the Legendary Perk system relies on cashing those out, I'm essentially being told I can't do this now.
---
As none of the Legendary Perks seem that worthwhile, the end result is that I'm not going to engage with this system.
---
It depends - the Appalachian Enclave has the opportunity to be different. In fact, I believe they could be the best hope for building a stable society in the region...also given that MODUS has the only operable production facilities as well is a huge plus.
---
New main quest. New locations. New currency.
---
I thought this was a PC-only feature... I will check that tonight.
---
The TSE rant was incessant and the subsequent "I'm leaving" posts dragged on and on. The pay to win arguments continued until 1st was released. The inventory theft posts continued weeks even months after Beth patched it.
---
So they atleast mentioned the (deep) pocketed mods for the SS armor...but what about the rest of the mods that are still in the files and remain to be added to Regs too?
---
I have same problem.  Fancy shotgun looks fine, Revolver looks plain.
---
Really worth it though? My fusion generator gives me so much power.
---
There's not much on there. A flooded basement, and a holotape. Shame I didn't know it was a quest.
---
New currency?
---
I love it also.  Bugs aside I still have fun every time I log on
---
If there was a little pond you could place to grow cranberries, I would be so happy.
---
The ounce of prevention fix coming soon?
---
Holy shit, it worked exactly as you said! Thanks a ton!
---
As soon as score dropped uninstall was the only meaningful option.
---
Also a two shot auto grenade launcher user here. And I add: my grenade launcher got bugged a month ago, and now it holds 500 rounds of ammo. So, endless Scorched Earth explosions. No pause.
---
Fast Travel to the last place you'd explored, then explore further, inevitably having to go back to your camp and want to explore further. Rinse Repeat.
---
Is there a consistent spawn location for squirrel, like there is for cranberry (Aaronholt homesteadt)?
---
I, for one, have appreciated the capsink of buying cork to donate.  Since I there‚Äôs little left for me to buy other than the recipe for stimpak diffusers, which nobody ever has, I‚Äôve been buying bulk cork and stuff to scrap it from when I‚Äôm approaching max.
---
I was 262 when I ate those nuggets.
---
Yes, that's me. Well, the problem I'm pointing out is about the community in general. Reddit is just a part of it.
---
Oddly, pumpkins are pretty bland.
---
Going to reiterate the graphics mods. Totally worth it even if you're returning to replay, but especially if it gets you through it the first time. The storylines are so much darker than what 76 feeds the gentle public, and it really sets the tone for what you do get to see. The side stories in the old fallout games are the kinds of things that force you to grow as a person simply having experienced them. 10/10 recommend, the mods make them beautiful again.
---
I was just trying to see if there was anything I hadn‚Äôt thought of as a way to use the junk.  It didn‚Äôt have to be for a profit, just something to do with it.  It‚Äôs basically a similar situation many have to scrip or gold bullion I guess.  
---
I do thank you for the input though.
---
Odds are a new dupe is running around if you are seeing server disconnects or the message in the lower right.   
---
I know I saw a cluster of 4 people 1 high 3 lows huddling at a camp doors locked up tight and the server kept glitching with 1-2 of them leaving then coming back.  When I went to a different server it was smooth no issues.
---
I wish I could remember the exact wording, but she's not too pleased about someone turning down radstag and low key insults you when you take the cat steak haha.
---
What you don‚Äôt want to hear a story with a morale?
---
To me, One Wasteland sounds like Bethesda is making the game more of a grind, i.e., worse. Whenever I start new characters, I deliberately seek out higher level enemies to power level. I go to events like Line in the Sand, tag enemies, and let higher levels kill them. If I want to face low level enemies, I can do so by sticking to the forest and the northwest end of the map. With One Wasteland, it sounds like I will have to face low level enemies no matter what, so I have less freedom to play the game the way I want to.
---
Not the roof.  The stairs...
---
We need a Mire Melee Massacre. Middle of the night in the swamp, no guns and only Bowie knives, and everyone has a Ghillie suit on.
---
Didn‚Äôt MODUS kill all of the members of the Appalachian Enclave before the 76ers showed up?
---
I have a feeling MODUS prefers secrecy.
---
Service entrance for the whitespring bunker. 1 squirrel on the hill and 2 on the other side of the parking lot.
---
Even worse
---
I mean, they are, but they are absolutely a crop that is grown in and around WV. Selfishly, I am basing a character on a friend who's family owns a pumpkin farm and he wanted to build a craft brewery there.
---
Is something important about those two?
---
Settlers medic backpack skin
---
Not at all
---
MODUS reacted in self-defense when Col. Santiago's men tried to blow him up. Anyone would have done the same thing.
---
It's a missed opportunity - that's why I'm writing a novel about a reborn Appalachian Enclave.
---
That stuff must be salty as hell
---
In regards to perk cards...it should be level based. I.e. you get coins per level with a small bonus every milestone level. You could still scrap perks but keep them a low amount so it gives you a way to get rid of duplicates as well as a small boost towards your next legend.
---
They changed the requirements 2 days in after we only collected about 6 million, so instead of collecting 150mil we only had to collect 15mil
---
\^\^ HotRun39 understands hoarding \^\^
---
Thanks to FO1st, I don't worry about having too much junk since it all goes in the scrap box. I do make a point to collect a lot of steel, lead, and acid since I craft a lot of ammo to sell in my vendors.
---
isildur.jpg
---
You are best off just killing stuff and selling their weapons. Blackwater mine is a great place to do that
---
Yes. I am pretty sure that I have that perk. Taking Rad-X or Radaway is something I normaly do only in a quiet moment ;) I hate that wheel, I always choose something different than I wanted. That's why I make strange emotes all the time, too. :D
---
But I will give it a try next time.
---
Maybe that's the joke.
---
Ya thats the part I never understood. I took my time and didnt even really meta at all but by level 75 I could murder anything in the game with sub optimal loadouts with no challenge what-so-ever. There was literally no REASON for me to grind anything. I'm a person who lives in the grind usually.  
---
Like back in my FF14 days I would run the coil raids over and over all day long and never got tired of it and was always progressing in some way because of it.
---
I just got healed from the "Herd mentality" mutation. It wasn't displayed anywhere that I had this mutation... u/Afb3212
---
I could never complete a bog one. The prime behemoth wrecked me every time. Maybe now with the public event system, teams, and my better gear I‚Äôll have a fighting chance!
---
So many in house jokes üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Bold of you to assume I give a fuck what games you play or don‚Äôt play.
---
But I get it, this is you giving Todd your loyalty oath.  Ironic that he doesn‚Äôt actually give a fuck either.
---
An owlet?  Come again?
---
Especially if they're down because I accidentally on purpose dragged a train of mobs over looking for some fire support...
---
You can‚Äôt craft legendary weapons apart from the gauss weapons I‚Äôm talking about stuff like Gatling guns, gauntlets etc
---
Watoga would be nuts.
---
Ill add you as well.  Also in CST zone and play at the same time as you.  In game i'm **redzone04**
---
I agree with you completely on that, eliminating requirements for adventure mode players to participate in NW for challenges or unlocks definitely makes more sense
---
Keep it all. I have a inventory logistics system that would make Amazon blush. I have alts spread across two accts with weapons ammo caps scrip junk and chems stored. The junk i keep it all. The way it works as we are with BoS event is eventually Bethesda wants to pull scrap from the economy. They will make an event that uses this stuff. I read in the comments what would you do with bone. Right now nothing. For the most part Bethesda doesn't know what to do with half this stuff... But imagine a cultist event where you need to make some leather and bone bags to open for rare plans. Imagine it cost 20 bone per. Suddenly bone is a hot commodity.
---
If you can store stuff without weight penalty just hold it. You will eventually use it. Maybe not now or 6 months from now. But you will.
---
I look dumb as a hoarder 90% of the time. But 10% of the time I'm a damn genius.
---
I actually considered it during the quakecon sale. But I'm sticking to the same rationalization as I did for 1st, I simply don't feel like the game is in a good enough state or heading far enough in the right direction to justify supporting it with money and sending them the message that I'm satisfied with what they are doing right now
---
protip: edit button lets you fix typos
---
People weren't just wrecking it for you? I could never get one to myself haha
---
Have someone look in that container. Sometimes it won't show for you. I use the ice machine outside the rusty pic, and couldn't see the stuff but wife could. Happen maybe 3 diffrent  times
---
Ah yes balls in my mouth (int+2)
---
No you cannot cook ANYWHERE in 2062 , and the inventory sorting is not permanent it reset himself.
---
Sweet!  Something new to do since I couldn't get the cannibal storyline to trigger at the B&amp;B.
---
Civil War dress and fasnacht witch mask. Got it.
---
That's odd I've never lost stuff dropping them off in a suitcase near a vendor and then logging in with the second character.
---
Infact yesterday i logged to a public server accidently then promptly logged out and back into the private server and it was the same server.
---
Look I didn't want to bring this up, I have a cork bundle for sell. It's a low low price 30,000. Just in case you guys need an extra 10 cork.
---
Most of the time last year people were just doing the savage divide one. Having other people down at the bog was a rarity.
---
Trade could be expanded greatly. I can see terminals being used as sort of a wasteland internet where you can put your items on there for sale or trade for either the entire playerbase to see or just that server at a time. Even player to player trade needs to happen.
---
All of these dreams are moonshot dreams and will likely come *if* Bethesda allows for open and truly private servers.
---
I switched back to the character i left em with . They were still there , only happened once though
---
I think Bethesda seriously underestimates just how popular the Enclave is.
---
Yhea but my english is also damm whorse than thisü§£
---
It would be cool if all the different plants could be planted, but they would die after a time if they were planted in a region they wouldn't naturally grow well. So you might make a decision on camp placement based on the crops you wanted.
---
I feel like I haven‚Äôt ‚Äúplayed‚Äù this game in weeks
---
Emit mountain kill the scavengers I‚Äôm like 70% sure they drop ston packs and you only ever farro the one you harm
---
You can cook any where there's a cooking appliance. I'm really not sure what you're trying to get at here?
---
If you're saying you can make a fire and cook anywhere, yeah you can. If you put your camp down so you can build a fire. Or if you have first throw your tent down that has a cooking station.
---
That is one thing, I really do wish the BOS event, or something like it, would stay, and would have some worthwhile rewards.  I would love to just spend my afternoons hunting junk down for some random plans.  I was able to unload some of it, but not enough. Looking forward to cloth though lol :D
---
Slap that on a poster of a baby feral ghoul and you've got gold!
---
I'll always liken them to the plastic they use on cheerleader pom-poms.
---
Bulking doesn't really save weight, but it is the only way to sell some items to the vendor. It also consumes plastic. I typically only bulk and sell junk when I need to clear stash space, but you can use this as a method to get caps. Just figure out which items you don't really need (up until the Fortifying Atlas event, concrete and cork got sold off for me, so I had not a lot to donate) and set limits for how much you keep of certain things.
---
I have found that silver and gold have decent value and not much use, at least for me. I also dump asbestos and rubber fairly regularly. Unless you have a scrapbox full, you are not going to be clearing out the vendor caps, but purified water farming can be good for that.
---
Edit: replied to wrong post.
---
I use the bag in the cart next to vault 76 and the girls down on steps and just transferred the guns I had stolen from me Saturday from a person that is now blacklisted
---
Fair comment, I only follow the game on Reddit and not part of any discords etc. What I see on here is Bethesda constantly being held to account and uproar at everything they do. Guess I'll look forward to your video discussing your thoughts!
---
Little surprised people call you toxic, negative and pessimistic because I've always found your news pretty factual, to the point and quite upbeat compared to other content creators I've viewed, probably what led me to subscribing.
---
As a final thought though, I do think a great majority of people who play this game just play it for fun, casually and will naturally let alot of things off because they're just happy to play the game. I don't particularly see that as such a problem.
---
Aahh yeah they were probably out farming bees lol. Well if you're on xbox and see a similar GT to my username down there you can bet your but it's getting finished (you might even struggle to get a hit in lol)
---
Yep that‚Äôs the container i use as well. Interesting - thx for the info!
---
There's a bone totem camp item with a skull on top you could destroy the round wooden table and repair it over the totem to have a skull popping up. Put candles on the table and then place the daisy rug on top to resemble the dress?
---
West-Tek to Huntersville to Behemoth usually does it. Charging laser rifles and assault rifles give like 30-40 caps each. With mutants giving caps and screws and lots of XP, it‚Äôs honestly the best for your time
---
I have charisma at a 4 for Lone Wanderer. Can't recall what endurance is at right now. Are you full health?  I'm curious what your perk cards are if you are.
---
My inner admiral akbarü§£ü§£ü§£
---
West tek is hard for weapon selling since it is so far away from a vendor, you can get over weight super fast with all those guns
---
I disagree, I use 10 every single day.
---
I sell quite a bit of junk this way. It helps keep the stash lean and mean. Once you figure out the mats you need least, you can set a safety threshold and sell the excess. Typically, 50 or less of infrequently used materials is plenty to keep in stash. High enough volume can easily clean a train station out in one trip.
---
You should be able to melt everything quick then, you run under 20% health with adrenaline and serendipity right?
---
Good to know the rejoin timer hasn‚Äôt changed obviously. Thx!
---
Permeant just like sbq. Hopefully one day we have big bosses all over the map.
---
Can‚Äôt believe people actually paid to award this, in this sub for this game lol yikes
---
Will try that next time then if it happens again
---
I think it's worth mentioning that Sweetwater's special blend us effected by herbivore and even more so with party boy/girl. It's amazingly good stuff for builds that use vats but have low perception. My plasma caster guy has 3 perception, mostly for lock picking, but almost never misses with that stuff.
---
Dude, totally forgot about that. For the time being just one piece with poison resistance is enough, just one. You're right tho. Man, I'm so happy with the set, I got all the good stuff, all kinds os weight reduction, + int, +agi, environmental. The one thing missing is poison res man.
---
my companion is rocking the brotherhood jumpsuit, bos hood, and plague mask right now, it looks great
---
Never had an issue dropping a bag at 76 entrance on a private server. I prestage my characters involved in the trade so it‚Äôs faster. 
---
Server stays active for 5 minutes if you log out.
---
I finally got a bloodied powerfist to drop from a 3 star ghoul but of course it was only a 1 star. God it annoys me to kill so many 3 stars to get 1 stars. I‚Äôm still keeping that bad boy until I upgrade. But I would keep the strength one being that‚Äôs always the best for mellow weapons
---
I don't actually, like i said i mostly like camp building, i frequently spent hours doing just that, but i also play other games, now that i have to go around doing all this busywork i don't care for i mostly log out seconds after hitting the last checkbox because i can stomage any more of it, the fact this is a daily occurance just makes the whole thing a drag, but what can i say, i want that secret door, because again, i mostly play for camp building.
---
Hey, I'd like to help out and play for a bit. I often overflow with ammo. IGN is Gatorador.
---
Yeah its worth a shot üëç
---
Here‚Äôs a pro tip. Get near an enemy, and you‚Äôll get a 15 second timer. Drop all your weapons, FT, then pick them all up before it runs out. Other than that, HiCap backpack, or excavator with calibrated shocks
---
It‚Äôs possible for this to be a visual bug. Like you contracted it from being too irradiated but it wasn‚Äôt displayed in your pipboy. It‚Äôll often show that I have a disease but won‚Äôt display what the disease is. If you have that mutation and aren‚Äôt on a team all your special stats drop by 1. I don‚Äôt know otherwise. Other than the typical sarcastic ‚Äúwelcome to any Bethesda game where all the glitches are considered a feature... unless you actually benefit from the glitch; then we gotta patch it.‚Äù Or the ever popular god howard quote ‚Äúit just works.‚Äù
---
Side note: Personally it‚Äôs a mutation worth having. With the public teams system you‚Äôll benefit from herd mentality regardless of how many people are on your team. Even solo as long as your team is public. 
---
Sorry I can‚Äôt be a better help!
---
Hi. I was wondering if the Eagle in front of the bundle is supposed to be a icon or is it just image art for the bundle. I purchased the bundle and couldn‚Äôt find the icon. Was just curious if you had any information about this.
---
Cold,  cold, slightly warmer, warm, warmer, hot, hot, scorching
---
Closer you are, the louder it gets. Often hidden next to things, under things.
---
They are literally giving you the date of the sell
---
Oh I completely agree but I also wanted to pay for a quality of life improvement and nothing in the atom shop offers that and a second account offers way more than 1st.
---
I don't need it personally haha, I run a full wwr set so all I need to do is jump out of my pa.
---
But that is a good trick to know!
---
Nice did you send me the invite
---
Oh it actually speaks ?
---
Yeah I gather them around the rusty pick and only use the ice machine since it‚Äôs a safer way instead of dropping a bag.
---
But never had it happen to find a container empty after rejoin.
---
Still waiting for those interior walls...
---
That‚Äôs some in-depth change.
---
I would build camps for people. It's not exactly the same but I would totally like playing camp contractor. The only real hurdle is atomic shop items.
---
Golf balls equal cork , and Baseball...gonna go to Tyler County Fair later and finish that up!!!
---
And I bet their response will be "well... You could avoid that if you subscribe to fallout 1st and play on a private world"
---
Aye. last time i swapped stuff i lost a LOT of ammo and legendaries and aid. 
---
it was a new world for some odd reasons even though i logged straight back in
---
I have two plans that I got from the event after I paid 5k caps for. I can trade you one if you want. I love my bloodied fixer that I got from purveyor. I also have a mutants and zealot that I got before the bloodied one. All I need now is a bloodied explosive fixer or the fixer 2525
---
Yea that‚Äôs my point, you shouldn‚Äôt have to play it to get the stuff, and if they do lock anything behind it it should be about meaningful challenges like wins/kills, not rewarding people for being afk.
---
People hiding and not attacking hurts the experience all round because there is less action in that match
---
Pro-tip. Don't claim any of your LR scrip rewards till the sale. Allows you to "bank" them.
---
I ain‚Äôt handling farmers for you ever again.
---
Can I get an enclave banner yet?
---
This has probably been asked already but: when One Wasteland drops, will enemies level up beyond their current maximums? Can I expect to see super mutants scaled beyond L60ish up to my L360, with appropriate stats?
---
Anyone feel free to add me as well ign alphawolf12
---
Oooft, that's a tight sphincter moment right there!
---
IM STAYING TOO GUYS. BUT IM ALSO PLAYING GROUNDED AND FALLOUT 4 AND FALLOUT 4 NEW VEGAS REMAKE MOD AND FALLOUT 4 MULTI MOD WHEN IT COMES OUT. And outer worlds. And iron harvest. And oblivion. And skyrim vr. And Skywind mod. And the LONG dark. Plague inc. Anddd
---
I just hoard it all in the scrapbox - I don't even need junk and I still find myself going out of my way looting everything lol
---
Probably not. Melee and rifles use very different special set ups. And trying to use 2 weapon types as well as qol perks is just not gunnu end up well for  you
---
Unless you aren't going to make it, don't. You are just throwing away atoms. Keep in mind there's no way to earn them for the next few weeks if you've already completed the run.
---
You're far enough ahead of the game that you won't need to log in everyday to complete it.
---
yeah it screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here come get me if you can bitch!‚Äù
---
I built a trap camp but it just has pits you can't get out of and you have to fast travel away. If you get to the end it has prizes. (Free low level stuff in the vendor because that character is only like level 11)
---
Same, i have 10 water purifiers at my camp, and with pharma farma I pick up so much chems between the chems and the water I usually hit 1400
---
I guess I can start just trying to make stuff to give away, or maybe just try to be excited about hitting big numbers.  I guess I just wanted something ‚Äúfun‚Äù to use it on.  Like if instead of spending caps for encrypted I had to craft the items.  Let‚Äôs see what the upcoming patch brings I guess. 
---
In the mean time I‚Äôll keep stock piling.
---
i am staying i like the music.
---
It's a valid question in a way, why are some items only 20/35/45
---
Not what they were asking, apparently..
---
Oh, honey, no...
---
Please remember to donate your cork at the Atlas observatory, for the good of Appalachia!  
---
**AD VICTORIAM, BROTHER!**
---
Goat legs would finally be useful!
---
I tend to agree but the synergy between unyielding a bloodied needs to be addressed. Alone unyielding and bloodied are meh. Together they are too OP. Only more OP is the prenerf synergy of TSE weapons. Two shot or explosive alone is meh, together it was way too OP.
---
All builds are viable. You can get through all *current* content with any build. Sure you won‚Äôt be solo‚Äôing the sbq with it but who cares. 
---
You‚Äôre build specifically will suffer a bit when it comes to rifles. Most semi auto rifle builds go heavy in perception and agility, where as melee builds go heavy in strength. It‚Äôs not particularly useful to max those three as you suffer from losing good QoL perks in things like Intelligence (for crafting/repairing) and luck. You‚Äôre best bet is to go full into melee and make that your default with 6-9 points in perception so you can swap in some rifle perks when needed. With that and a decent rifle you are totally capable of one-shotting most mobs at a distance while still being able to run up to bosses with your stick o‚Äô choice and get the best dps you can. This leaves you with plenty of room for your 5 intelligence and whatever other points you want in he others for QoL stuff
---
I agree. All of these items should have a sort of life cycle. If it sits in a box somewhere it shows how useless these items are. Scrip for example completed a sort of life cycle for legendary stuff. I think the scrip system is 'good.' Bullets have now entered that world with a bullet converter machine from the legendary board game. Scrap and caps needs to sort of move now too.
---
It almost sounds like paper flipping for magazines, and a bobbly-wobbly sound for bobbleheads.
---
Caravan stylin‚Äô all the way
---
Oh absolutely. I have no problems soloing Encryptid and I rather enjoy it. I run bloodied, but just down a couple radaway, replace nerd rage with rank 3 first aid and serendipity with ricochet, and I'm good to go. Gives me a chance to thin out my massive pile of stimpacks.
---
I didn‚Äôt know there was a thing for opening the door before they were ready. I wish I did
---
I hate to derail my own thread here, but does Vampires work for all hits, or just crits?  I was thinking it was just crits? 
---
I have a Vampires Cryo I may use until i can dig up something better, so curious how that might work out.
---
Ouch. 
---
Just thought as it was my 2nd transfer to that char it has something to do with the cooldown timer for world container.
---
I did it, no regrets!
---
What discussion is there to be had?  Affixes need a balance, weapons in general need an overhaul frankly, and this has been the case (excluding the explosive and double shot nerf) since essentially launch.    If they don't already know this, a reddit post isn't going to inform them, because we have been complaining about it all for over a year.
---
Did they make any alterations before adding in the last round of new weapons?  Nope.  Will they have a balance pass before the next round?  I'm putting my money on no.
---
You're just mad because someone presented a completely logical reason to push it back. üòã
---
Anyone who participated in Meat Week before realizes it's kind of this constant thing, every hour on the hour with Prime Cuts roughly every 15 minutes in between. It has a palpable effect on running silos and participating in nuke events.
---
This is just another bandaid fix to another bad system. Just like "fixing" the ammo converter interface - instead of implemented better UI they just made the terminal interface less bad. And this is the same case. Scrapping perk cards for Perk Coins is bad idea and any modifier for Perk Coins earned is another bandaid. 
---
Why not give perk coins for every level after 50? We earn perk cards at a consistent rate when levelling, meaning the we would earn Perk Coins also at the same rate (multiplied by some modifier). So let's skip the step of scrapping and give us the coins immediatelly. 10 per level maybe?
---
I've got a B/25/250 in my stash that I was very close to scripping at first. Damn thing would've been a god roll if it had been a weapon people actually use. I've held onto it hoping maybe one day I can find an explosives enthusiast that might be interested in it.
---
I am really hoping that the scaling is aimed at enemies that already have variable strengths, and keeps them within existing ranges. (Areas that come to mind are VTU, etc. where the level of the ghouls depends on the level of the person who is showing up.)
---
I will be disappointed if this makes the lower level areas (and low level events) suddenly much more difficult for high level players. As it is, I know where to go for difficult fights, and I know where the fights will be easy, and I really appreciate the balance between the two.
---
I've always been too scared to try that method, just because I don't trust the server to not switch on me. I have used public teams, though, to ensure that I am able to rejoin the server. I just find a container that is WAY off the beaten path and use it. Actually, the last time I did it, I just dropped a bag on the roof of one of my teammate's camps and came back to it. I wouldn't recommend that method though unless you're sure they'll be on for the next few minutes, at the very least.
---
I think that's because The Thrill of the Grill daily spawns radstag herds in those two places, but if people don't utilize them when they trigger the daily it just spawns more and more radstags... so you end up with quite an impressive stag party over time.
---
I know I came off as bitter but it‚Äôs just baffling game design on beths part, combined with false feedback from players, Beth can‚Äôt be blamed if it appears the player base is happy to play by not playing.
---
It‚Äôs another missed opportunity for fun, no shame in dying early in a Br but afking is shameful to me
---
Do you have clean or irradiated Sugar Bombs?
---
Corn soup, carrot soup, blight soup, brain fungus soup, and cranberry relish are my staples.
---
Get fancy with brain bombs.
---
Here, here! Excellent job you do, we know. I always click on your ads if is relevant or not. THANK YOU!
---
Oh yeah man, they are awesome.
---
Not sure how raiders in this game who talk about accepting people with differences is even immersive in the first place
---
I did not know that, thank you!
---
Lol yeah i was like ohhhh shiiiiii.. üò±
---
Each hit from a Vamp weapon heals, I believe 20HP(10HP/sec for 2 seconds).
---
Yea there's videos online explaining the story front to back. I watch those when I start a game and haven't played the previous ones.
---
Oh I agree, when I say ‚Äútoo much junk‚Äù I‚Äôm not saying that I can‚Äôt store it... I‚Äôm saying that I have amassed so much that I simply have no use for it. I can‚Äôt bulk it fast enough to sell it to vendors.  I‚Äôm earning scrap faster than I can bulk sell it, sell it to players, use for repairs, etc. 
---
I was actually thinking that I could use the scrap to build up workshops.  It‚Äôs temporary, so it would be lost, but then I‚Äôm having a good use for it, and if someone takes a workshop from me/after I leave they can have a neat little fort I designed.
---
Gold bullion to buy plans for new Gauss weapons, T65 power armor and secret service armor at the end of the Wastelanders dlc and some other items throughout that quest line.
---
r/Wolfrevo_gaming
---
Im staying. Im fallout loyal.
---
That‚Äôs actually a great idea. A bit like campfire tales as either the wendigo or the horde spawns
---
I'd be the same! Sheeeeeeeeeet. HeHe
---
err, I didn't say I hate the game. I'm a fan of Fallout since Fallout 1.
---
Playing the game is questing &amp; exploration. I've done all that. I'm not here to do the same old dailies &amp; events for either cosmetics, or for better gear that has no use. There's no challenge out there that needs this better gear.  
---
Once the BoS quests are here, I'll be playing again, then stopping again when the grind starts up.
---
I'm fine with the daily limits on the bullion and caps... I'm even fine with the scrip allotment... But I really wish it would be weekly resets instead of daily.
---
No, the enemy level caps will still be there, otherwise, your weapons would have to level up past 50 as well. so a level 52 gutsy will always be a level 52 gutsy, you will just run into them in low-level areas instead of a level 5 gutsy
---
They are from food processor plant
---
I prefer using the "unlimited weight" suitcases at train stations. There should be at least one at each station. Never had a problem making a transfer - even of large amounts of junk items.
---
This is key.  The ones that give rads are needed.
---
I do too... and then when the BOS event came I figured I‚Äôd dump some of it... and then I saw just how much I had (for a while, I was claiming workshops on my private server and had all the extractors up, plus collectrons, trying to farm the plans for camps from events) and I was trying to come up with a way to use it
---
gold bullion
---
Thanks for the laugh, needed it.
---
You do realize you didn't *have* to do the battlepass and could've just kept 'doing random shit and exploring' instead?
---
lmao are you serious? people buying extra bullion from smiley affects my game way less than bugs which affect everyone
---
This game is so full of bugs, I can't even leave.
---
Try roof of the red rocket in flatwoods I think there are usually a few irradiated ones there.
---
Yup. Then they whine and moan about being done and not getting anything in return. Like whatever. LoL
---
Obviously by our down votes we must have hit a nerve. Guess some people really can‚Äôt handle he truth LMAO
---
Thanks everyone
---
Craft up some orbital strike beacons
---
Both patched. Rip fun
---
I feel you! I was actually very nervous about this one being multiplayer, but the community is so wonderful (for the most part), that I realize I had nothing to worry about. The bugs are there and still annoying, but there are less, and the new content really fleshes it out a lot. I'm just bitter still that there's no Order of Mysteries stuff available other than the story quest. I want decorations, and I want to revive the Order and recruit new members. It's criminal that they give us such a great group and story, and then you finish that little bit and that's it. You can't even find posters with just the Mistress! It's always her with the rest of the gang, while the Shroud gets several variants. Ugh! Mini rant over.
---
Between getting stuck and either bashing or holstering it to fix it and getting instakilled when hitting enemies up close with it despite rank 3 fireproof, I just put it in the stash to collect dust until the day comes when it's less deadly to me than the enemies.
---
You can also place your own head inside the SBQ's mouth by placing a chair underneath the mount
---
No because that's how it used to be and people would sit around doing fuck all while 2 or 3 players actually did the work.
---
That‚Äôs the issue. You need the irradiated ones. The ones from the factory processor are new and clean.
---
Automatic rifles have a higher DPS than semi autos.
---
I rolled as a stealth sniper, some battles were drew out, now with my automatic build, my hmr melts all
---
I was speaking from a technological standpoint. Thought that was obvious.
---
Makes a distinct ‚Äúbong, chick a chick chick‚Äù sound on PC. Gets louder, as you close in. Lots of mags in the mansions near Summersville Lake
---
You can be right on top of one, and it still be hard to find. Under things, tucked in, on top of cabinets, in a container under junk or food.
---
I've had Ward say 'Finally, someone with the guts to help...I've got my eye on you'.
---
Kinda puts a dampener on my desire to help to be honest
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted for a question, but as someone who has been here since launch you are half correct. There were definitely a number of hoaxes/unproven issues, the most notable of which is the famous 'trade-steal' exploit, which was never actually proven to exist (note: this is not the same as the hacker who was stealing people's inventories, which did happen). A number of high level players even offered their legendary inventories for people to try and steal, with no results. And I think it is still true even now that a small number of people on this subreddit never played the game and only come out when there is a new controversy to get 'angry' about. 
---
However, there have been issues the community has been 'outraged' about that were worth addressing. I think an error that this post makes, as with many posts that address large online communities, is lumping people together into sides. Liking a funny meme post does not automatically mean you are blind to the issues the game has, just as being angry about a problem does not instantly mean that you hate the game.
---
The problem with FO76 is it is the only title within the series where the bugs overpower the game quality.
---
The previous titles you can get over it because of the story, gameplay, mods, character developments, etc. FO76 doesn't provide anything memorable for any of those aspects. Constant story-telling through terminals and poorly added NPCs? Just awful.
---
No, I am.
---
Ah ok.  It doesnt say irradiated are needed.  Just says sugar bombs.  Guess I'll go looking for the rad ones.
---
If a Fallout 1st tent is placed near the gate the spawns all get directed to the generator area.
---
That doesn't make it a good game
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Found mine last night in the kill box. Only one of the two spawned in. I had already spent almost 2 hours traveling to known locations. What a pain.
---
Can you buy them from people or pick up drops? Because normally i would be happy to give them away as i already have a full set
---
When?
---
I know right. While proud American pastimes such as dropping nukes are practically the centrepiece of the game. Makes you think.
---
you cant have 4 nukes at a time, when you launch a nuke there is a cooldown for the silo that is longer than the nuke effect, and there are only 3 silos
---
We'll keep asking for more OOM!
---
Bobbleheads go Bong...wiggle wiggle that's what I call the card :-)
---
That‚Äôs cool.  My childhood friend‚Äôs father was into growing giant pumpkins.  He had cameras watching his patch, all types of monitors and sensors....it was wild.
---
This is going to sound stupid but I don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of auto rifles that much. Some of them are alright, who doesn‚Äôt like ripping into something with an LMG or Gatling gun, but most just feel kinda meh to me. Maybe it‚Äôs just that my monkey brain likes the big number in the ‚Äúdamage‚Äù stat more than total DPS which is hard to find out without add ons.
---
It is about time to add more maps if they want the mode to have anyone like me play regularly again.  I literally only play now to grab the 250 points towards the game board a day.  Most times I can earn those points in one match.   I have played the two maps to death already.
---
Only if they have more Enclave stuff.
---
I would love a barter option where you can trade item for item. Not need for middleman or trust not to be robbed.
---
It's sort of frustrating. I built my camp right next to an in game location that has a small farm, which has several pumpkin plants, that you can pick.. but you can't plant them. So the assets are already in game.
---
I haven‚Äôt had issues myself since patch but there are reports for sure.
---
 Would just say to be deliberate about it, and use a world container.  Want to move a good item, do only that and get it done.  I‚Äôm much more casual when it‚Äôs just ammo and scripmovement or little things like that, but a good weapons or armor or outfit, I do only that and hold my breath.
---
Never ever use paper bags or dropped on floor containers to move stuff.  Always use a world container
---
No pvp opportunity outside of workshops. Very boring
---
Absolutely satisfying to decode it yourself. 
---
But oh boy, the pressure when you can feel the breath of the lvl 300+ guy in your neck at the console in the silo.
---
Was an intense first time for me.
---
Yes, how much power do you use? How much conduit is running in your camp?(Or , God forbid, how many wires are ruining your camp?) Other then a full blown water farm, fusion is crazy overkill. They are seemingly the number 1 target of mobs at your camp, and relatively expensive to fix. When it's blown you lose All power. 
---
I put one of the, good-looking, non smoking little beauties wherever I need power. Also easy to hide because they stack, so you can put them on top of stuff out of veiw. Also kinda simple rectangular shape, easy to stuff them into other things w/ flamer trap, to hide them completely. Need more power? Blueprint a stack. Love these things.
---
I have some that I do switch out but I always forget or am too lazy to do it! I'd have to go on and look at what I have to be able to tell ya what I got. My two shot gat w/out buffs will do enough damage for the queen for me to get loot- except for the time I modded it and it stopped doing damage all together. Now that sucked. Took me forever to figure out it was that mod that somehow broke it
---
This junk?
---
Up in my trunk?
---
...I'll just see myself out.
---
I wish I understood this post better, but to answer the part that I can understand, I would suggest sorting aid items by spoilage. It helps a lot in making sure you eat the older stuff first before it goes bad and just becomes fertilizer fodder. Hope it helps!
---
I love the look of the Slocum's vendors but they are the single most annoying and LOUD thing i have ever had in my camp. Please please put a silence option on things like that

Well, I meant like handmade rifle and combat rifles.
---
I had a lever action I used alot, and see the damage bubble up for 800 was nice, but most things over 60, it didn't one hit.
---
And in a swarm I sank stims.
---
It's on its last leg because you're bored with it? It seems its far from on its last leg, bud.
---
If ya have the atoms or the money to buy more I'd say go for it.
---
Dodgy definitely works in power armor.
---
I gave away most of my steel (~3000?) and got mostly-alcohol plus a plan for boxing gloves which I already knew. I'm not going to bother with the others.
---
Yeah, plans were a great cap sink, but I have most of the important ones, and I‚Äôm just buying the rest to complete the collection.  I do agree caps needs an good sink so that I have something to put them into (the gifts were a great idea... till they started getting duped)
---
and same with scrap.  Just something to feed them into So I can keep going out and picking stuff up and getting a nice little rewards.
---
Had at lest 5-6 auto completes, sent in tickets each time and they said they could do anything, bethesda support are useless and only resolve things when it's in their interests and not the players interests

Do the server a favor and nuke ATLAS. Teach those simps what happens when you donate to the Brotherhood of Steel

Looks like they plan on going forward with making legendary perks into just another grind.  If they had come out with the perk loadouts first, something that modders came up with right off the bat to make up for poor design choices that consoles still suffer through, this card scrapping BS wouldn't even be necessary.  Instead, it just penalizes older players that got all those duplicate cards over time and are sitting on stacks of 1-star cards they never ranked up due to it being faster to scroll past them all every time you have to change cards before every little thing.  Just give people perk coins per level and get to work on loadouts, something that should have been in the base game, instead of more convoluted shit like this that nobody asked for.

What do you mean in 2062, though? But inventory sorting does have to be reset for each new session, yes, but it's just a quick adjustment when you open your Pip Boy and it should stay as set until you log out, unless you're hitting the sort button again without meaning to or something?
---
I had to ditch a whole CAMP build area cause the stairs fused with a roof and wall right where I wanted to expand. Fuck stairs.
---
I think how players and game makers interact go deeper than just our personal rhetoric. We are encouraged always to take a side. You're either right or left wing. Pro or anti abortion. Love or hate Bethesda. Up or down vote. Heart or no heart. Were asked to take a side always instead of having deeper intellectual discussions on the grey matter in-between. All for a bit of internet currency. My most popular posts and comments were a few words. A deeper talk like this ends up with an upvote or two and forgotten to time.
---
And I'm guilty of it too. TL;DR shows we don't have tons of time to sift through all the noise. So we look for snappier quicker satisfaction.
---
Half the time were trying to reprogram a psychology that exists by design. Most of us just leave the communities or drop interaction as the type of energy these communities promote aren't what most of us want.

I hate it also.

What a fantastic game, my wife bought it for us and I‚Äôm a big overwatch player and decided I needed a small break from FPS. I have about 85hrs into this game and it‚Äôs only been about a month. We try to play together 2-3 times a week and we have a blast. I‚Äôm

I believe they said (was there even a clarification from them in this post?) that it would be all across the map...so pretty much right up to the vault. 
---
I agree, it's nice to know that if I just want to go easy I can hit up a certain area of the map. I wouldn't mind if they expanded this concept to cover the bog, mire, even the divide, maybe the wastes in the north but left the forest area and a bit around it at the lower level. I appreciate opening it for new players, but it's nice to know that if I'm low on ammo I can scrounge in an easier area for a bit to rebuild resources if I feel like it.
---
That's right. I just finished 100% plan learning yesterday. I also have any weapon I could want. Im missing two rare outfits. I have almost no sink at all now!

Until they make everything on par with Unyielding, NOTHING will beat a low health build. Unyielding is super OP, minimum 15 of each special besides endurance just from your ARMOR, not counting your actual specials stats you already had.

I don‚Äôt know why some plants were intentionally left off the plantable crop list.  They added blackberries, which didn‚Äôt exist in Fo4, but left out things like silt beans, pumpkins, etc.  
---
My only guess is they‚Äôre useful for some kind of cooked meal that offers a buff that the devs felt was too strong to be able to make in large quantities?  Pumpkin pie offers an HP buff, but so does razorgrain soup.  I dunno.
---
It's always been the unwritten rule, whenever you have vendors always put a stash box next to them :-)
---
Hmmm, I like that idea
---
Much easier ways to get legendaries.
---
It‚Äôs all rng so some people could potentially get them pretty quick and others could take months. I‚Äôve been rolling SS armor for about 2 or 3 months and I have 2 good unyielding pieces and one god roll with ap refresh. I‚Äôve used hundreds of legendary modules and still only have one unyielding piece that I‚Äôd say is perfect, the others I‚Äôll probably try to get a better tool later on
---
Same here. I collected up all the codes and solo'd the silo and got all the way up to scanning the nuke key card before I realized I had to decrypt the codes. I was under the impression that just having collected them up was enough. luckily nukacrypt appeared in my google search and saved the day.
---
There's a mod for that, too.
---
I have never launched my own Nuke. It‚Äôs always been a nukacrypt launch
---
Interesting.  Thanks for the info.
---
They're testing them in the PTS so they don't fail. Not sure what kind of high horse you're on
---
familiar story :)
---
You can make healing salve if you have the recipe. Forrest healing salve is the easiest to make and its considered a stim so you can spam your right arrow. I used to make 200-300 and save up my stims to sell or give but then I hit 500 stims and just have been using stims because of weight issues.
---
Again,  nothing is mandatory. They‚Äôre catering to those who have the time and/or money to get to the upper ends.
---
This, like many things, isn‚Äôt about a single person. It‚Äôs to make an overall experience for any playstyle.

you need 8 code pieces for each nuke you launch.

You will sometimes find them in player vendors around 10k caps

You need to buy Atoms first before you can log in

Or just run the burrows a few times and you'll get like 20...

That'S a great idea actually, I'd definitely like that and freedom wise it's not like it would be too hard to repair considering you can farm at least some before they break

I'm off the ground with a 2 story house built inside a power transmission tower just S of Monongah power plant.

Oh yay.. enemies that are VATS proof. :(
---
For cryolators the best two prefixes are TS and Quad and the freezing effect is not affected by any perks (eg, bloody mess or heavy gunner.) In my experience a TS one shot definitely freezes her faster than a single shot.
---
As a primary weapon the damage output is not going to kill the queen, but it will slow her down enough so the melee players can do their thing.
---
I've been in hundreds of queen battles, and have never seen one that failed where two cryolators were used.
---
a good community means a lot for an online game. 76 is better than some "good games" i've played.

I can't even lauch the game, so thats not the proplem.

Dude same, I hate myself that I waste so much time just enjoying being organized and shedding weight. I recently saved up 600 scrip and spent it yesterday got 2 god rolls lmao junkies explosive faster reload lmg &amp; quad vats 50 crit faster reload double barrel

Chinese soldiers are not particularly well known for listening to American protest songs... Why not have leftovers of the actual people fighting against corporations all over the map? They've put other leftovers from before the war in other places as well... Like have the radio station centered somewhere in the Ash Heap or in the Toxic Valley?
---
The PTS needs to be added to consoles to fully vet it.

Red rocket mega stop usually has at least 3 or 4 laying around

They should just put an option in the terminal to mute them.

Damn. 18 spots vs 20 isn't too bad, but I was hoping it was a little better than that.
---
Right? Super satisfying to come back to your camp after exploring and seeing all the junk get scrapped from your inventory lmao &amp; nice I keep getting nocturnal knives lmao
---
You need a tinkers workbench, walk up to it click E to Craft
---
Then click Ammo 
---
click on the type of ammo you would like to craft.
---
If you have the ammosmith perk 
---
And super duper perk turn those on before crafting. 
---
You‚Äôll need lead, steel and gunpowder in your inventory or stash to create ammo. 
---
I hope this helps some.
---
You use them to craft legendary mods onto your weapons
---
U should have replied "maybe killing you is why." Lol
---
If you are collecting magazines, you have the option to check world challenges.  The ones you have/need are listed there.

Tis what I do when I find one in the wild.  Usually faster than scrolling through stash inventory list.
---
By cancelling Fallout 1st and sending the Custom Support dick pics
---
Like a laser pistol that is viable? Like a new receiver that has low fire rate but high damage?
---
Take all your junk out and scrap it individually. I don't use the scrap all button anymore because I find it doesn't scrap everything like it supposed too. It takes an extra minute but it works and I like to see what components the junk has so I know what to look for in the world.
---
Think it's mainly you saving him from the Blood Eagles, who aren't really sided with the normal raiders. They literally were kicked out because they get too crazy with how much drugs they constantly do. At least that's what I know from in game lore.

wdym weekly resets? Like 1400 caps per week?

Ya, it's like if you make a screw up in your build you are forced to keep grinding and now you have to re-pick a card and use a level up to switch a special point.  It feels like an attempt to keep you grinding more and more.........I'm already level 335 I should have to spend points to pick up level 1 commando I got 300 levels ago.

Just annoys me the same way the ammo converter.  It's becoming clear the majority of decisions are aimed at logging in and putting the atom shop in your face.  Why cant we just have cool features without the bullshit tactics ya know?

I too am staying ad I am addicted to F76, even with its bugs.

Oof..sorry..i did not understand context...thought rando was being weird...sorry..again
---
This link shows you the sound, i had the same problem as you
---
I don‚Äôt think they can fix it. It‚Äôs mostly lag. 
---
Try this: On the map screen, click once on the location you want to travel to. Wait ten full seconds for the lag to clear, then click to commit to travel. This works for me 9/10 times.
---
lol, Jesus Christ dude switch to decaf.
---
Yeah, I really think people should focus on the events to complete the event themselves and get whatever the reward is. If you can get a hit on the legendary, great.  Not worth getting bent out of shape if you can‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm at 0 scrip for all of my characters everyday with leftover legendaries. Missing out on one isn‚Äôt a big deal.

Also the bridge, it adds really fun tactics and opportunities.

You have to buy ingame currency before you can even play the game?

That's what I always wonder too. Feels like Adventure mode is Beta as well at times.

Naw it‚Äôs cool. I didn‚Äôt put anything like that I my post so how would you know?
---
Most of the time I have absolutely no junk on me unless I buy it at the camp and have not had a chance to deposit it yet. I must admit trap bases tend to urk me a bit. Some of them are really clever and well built. However, it is the post apocalypse so I understand that there would be thieves and raiders. My main complaint is that if your trap base attacks or kills me we should automatically be in combat and I should be able to attack you and your base. It seems that most of these badass raiders tend to be on pacifist for some reason...LOL
---
I may or may not have screamed at a higher pitch than my wife when we saw it.

That's what I would like, add some team based PVP interior modes to the lineup. So many good locations available

Majority of this sub is complaining about the game, are you smoking crack?

I look forward to the mass amount of bitching and "I'm cancelling my fo1st" posts if they nerf bloodied

it will be a glorious amount of salt

Good enough, thanks for the advice! :)
---
I've got a B/25/25, and have been hoping the same thing.
---
They're not completely patched, you just have to throw it so it's not actually touching their base but near enough their base to do damage otherwise it won't explode but will sit dormant
---
Events. I throw at least 10 a day away and super stims and diluted. Take up weight and don‚Äôt need more than 2 or 3 unless doing imposter. And even then running at high health for that event u don‚Äôt die much
---
yes, in this very thread it was covered a long time ago...
---
Well can't please everyone I suppose, but still, like 80% correct!
---
I started with FO4 and loved it. Tried getting into 3 and NV but struggled liking both. While waiting for 76 to release I gave 3 another shot and fell in love. Went back to Vegas as well and, my god, it was so fun. The choices were mind blowing.
---
3 and NV are now my favorites and I have done complete runs thru on both since 76 dropped. I forsee playing both once a year.
---
I don't mind the clunky mechanics or graphics as they remind of a time I didn't have wrinkles.
---
So since he rushed the board to actually enjoy the game in the playstyle he wants, you're criticizing him? He's right, this first season was a BIG grind. Someone posted the math on release and found out you were still over 5k xp short if you did EVERY single daily and weekly until the event ends. Next season either needs to be less of a daily grind, or no timegates to let people level it in their own time.
---
Can confirm just happened to me...  üò≠
---
  I would think so, but IDK for sure.  When I visit, I'm usually on foot, heading ESE from blackwater to the road fronting where RR happens, follow the road to the roadblock, kill the NPCs there, then cut back west overland to Foundation. NE and billygoat down to the BB on the return trip.
---
I know there are a few along the road S from blackwater towards the B &amp; B, and one near where the RR track cuts uphill and east, passing by the PO'ed Yogi's.  
---
Not sure after that.

We're not all level 10 like you, chief

Same I have a really low level vampires explosive 10mm pistol, I painted it with the Halloween skin so I don‚Äôt delete or scrip it on accident lol empty a whole clip in a lvl40 mole miners head he‚Äôs still charging me lol

On ps4?!? Please say yes and name of mod if you know it üôèüôèüôèüò¨

This is bad for low levels trying to level up fast. But ig it‚Äôs not how fast you get to the end; but how much you enjoy each part of the journey along the way
---
I hate seeing this everyday...
---
her poop run is not an attack it is a failed target acquisition 99% of the time its cause someone is standing on a fence or a tent.
---
I‚Äôve seen some builds that use most of their budget just going up. I‚Äôm pretty sure the build area is like a cone. A big circle that goes straight up.
---
Everything works till it doesn‚Äôt...
---
I vaguely recall someone here saying the build zone is actually a sphere....4 stories/floors   
---
 above and 4 below the camp device, but I could be wrong.
---
Yes. Your CAMP is surrounded by a sphere. You cannot go outside the sphere.
---
Is there an elevator style thing in the game
---
I have a stairwell snapped to a foundation that are apparently relying each other to stay accessible. Haha. They just live on the corner of my property alone and unused together. Can‚Äôt get rid of them
---
I could be wrong in this but I thought I remember seeing it was three stories in each direction.  If you happen to build on the side of a cliff.  You can go three stair cases up and three stair cases down.
---
I think you did the right thing, if they treat you like game content then you should have the right to treat them like game content.
---
Read my edits and comments, it won't even lauch.
---
Closest thing to that is marsupial or jet pack.
---
Right, I don't get why they keep wanting to use this 'scrap your perks to get coins' concept. Same with the respec system, we should never have to effectively 'go back a level' to respec or to get these perk coins. They either have no clue about game design or they just don't care and want us to grind hundreds if not thousands of levels. Really don't get why they can't look at ESO and pull more concepts from there. Instead they keep trying to reinvent the wheel and they keep making square wheels that just don't roll
---
Student budget says no, unfortunately. I do want one, as I got into gaming on a PC, buuuut it won't be for a while
---
I actually actively played and somewhat enjoyed NW when it came out, but I became frustrated with the wait times for matches. Waiting 4-5 min to start a match and getting killed quickly only to have to wait another 5 min to be placed in another match is irritating and takes forever to level up. I also think there should be a greater exp incentive to actually get kills, since you can level up way faster by just hiding and lasting longer instead of actually killing other players
---
We‚Äôll see how this goes. Not everything is permanent . They will listen to the outrage just as they did with all the recent dislikes; they‚Äôre just slow.
---
I played a couple short events last night. I had fun. I will play more as soon as i catch up on sleep. Also revisited dying light due to pandemic that was a fun and timely game to revisit.
---
If you equip rank 3 fireproof and a dense chest piece you should be good!
---
Keep in mind the score system rewards perk packs, which is a total of 8 perk coins if you scrapped all of them. I think one of the final perk pack rewards gave like 4 or 5 perk packs which is pretty decent. But again alot of people might not blast through the score system  like hard core players.
---
The Slocum's Joe vendor is pretty funny in a terrible way.  Here, because you pay us every month, you can buy this thing.  At full price.  What a deal!
---
I feel like granting one coin per level up (retroactively giving a number of coins equal to your level) would have been the best way to balance the system and not punish those of us who felt the need to respec and move points around multiple times.
---
Other then wastlanders DLC.  Everything is the same.
---
Middle of a corn field in ohio, good luck. (Hint not many cats around)

any true Enclave member would just pull themselves up by their bootstraps and get their own Laser Weapons.

There is an American flag however I don‚Äôt know if it can be used on the pole

How would I know if it is a magic weapon or not, as it does seem to be quite strong.

Second this.  I‚Äôm selling far more stimpaks than I use.  Events seem to have me over flowing with them.
---
SS-1S is the god roll.
---
ƒ∞gn : ayes23 feel free to add i love playin with a group
---
Not that I disagree with the math, or the assessment that being level 850 minimum is unreasonable for maxing out 6 perk cards, on the flip side, doing something like getting 6 stats all a +5 (which can all have their own perk cards) is very powerful itself.
---
Could the intended design be then that they don‚Äôt want us to max out 6 perks?  Sure, we can...and they gave us a horrible path to get there... but maybe the path was shitty by design because they don‚Äôt want that to happen?
---
Edit: and to be clear, I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs something to work towards‚Äù, I‚Äôm saying ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt want us to work towards it‚Äù
---
"But again alot of people might not blast through the score system  like hard core players."
---
And some players might not even have played during the Season. I specifically didn't factor in bonus Card Packs like those from The Legendary Run because there's no guarantee that everyone has access to them.
---
Yeah, the Responders were the last - they were finally overrun at the Morgantown Airport, where they made their final stand.
---
I preordered tricentennial as well mate. At first I totally regretted it at launch. After coming back to the game after 2 years I‚Äôm really enjoying it.
---
The Dailies reset every day... have you not been doing them on weekends?
---
And to answer your questions, the point of Double Score weekend is to give us 2X Score for 4 days.
---
I have done it a few times since the last patch with no issue and I always use the same case.  I fast travel my main to the drop spot, then I go to a private world on alt and put the stuff in, then I exit the private world, switch back to my main in the menu, enter private world and loot the case.
---
More like a cylinder, 4 stories up or 4 stories down from where you placed your camp originally.
---
LOL Home on the Range, where someone shows up at the very end after doing nothing to get the brahmins to their pen, instant kills the sheepsquatch with their overpowered weapon, doesn't bother to turn it on the things attacking the brahmin and GTFOs.
---
8-10k is going rate.  12k ain‚Äôt bad if u want it.
---
Yeah I was thinking one of the American flags.
---
Those at work may not have time to do all the weeklys between Tues evening and Fri... 
---
so yea, double score is quite helpful, especially at the upper end of the board, when the levels are 3000+ score points apart.
---
&gt;For example, **e**very time  I post a bug on Reddit, people downvote me or dismiss the issue.  Regardless if I show proof or not, the majority of players don't CARE  about issues or emerging bugs, until they encounter the bug themselves  or have proximity with the issue (a friend, a mate, or a content creator  they watch was affected by it). That's one of the main traits of  selfishness, the lack of empathy until it happens to you.   
---
You're probably getting downvoted because unless the bug you're posting is something that is vital for the community to know about in order to avoid it then this is not the place to post it.
---
This is reddit.  Not Bethesda's official forums or their tech support.  Posting bugs to reddit is great for upvotes but it's terrible for actually getting those bugs fixed unless your post just happens to take off, but even then hundreds of upvotes on reddit is no guarantee of a community rep actually seeing it and reporting it to anyone.
---
I honestly wish the mods would remove the bug tag as the majority of the time it gets used people honestly seem to think it counts as a bug report and don't bother actually reporting it where it actually matters, and more often than not take offense when you ask if they actually bothered submitting a report.
---
Please release Colossus on time; that‚Äôs on my cake-day :)
---
This was more about you wanting your own version of FO76, and less about the ITV. I feel lied to.
---
Whats your story? Level 300, played 10 hours a day grinding levels and events server hopping with the meta bloodied build with no challenge whatsoever? And you're mad that your bored. Hilarious.
---
Rating system? by what metric would such a system use?  I don't see much use in seeing owner level myself.  I have seen high level people sell junk with minimal camps designs while I have seen low levels sell some gem items with creative camps.  With people using mules to hold and sell things you can't judge a shop by the owner's level really.
---
I would like to see more info on what they are selling but that is a wish and not a need, and in truth I might have missed seeing some interesting camps if I knew before hand that they weren't selling the items I was looking for.
---
I do this all the time, if I'm carrying a bunch of junk and scrap, which is basically all the time.
---
First of all, thank you for taking the time to write this. It's nice to come across well thought out messages from other Fallout fans.
---
As I read this, especially the first paragraph, I was very exuberant for your thoughts. You seem to echo many of my sentiments when reading through /fo76/ on a daily basis. Points 1,2 &amp; 3 solidified it *even* more for me...
---
But then came #4, and I realized I am one of the "toxic positives" you are addressing in your post. It made me think about not only *my* message, but *how* it is conveyed, to fellow fans. However, I also think you have a skewed view from what I have experienced with FO76. Skewed by your *platform*, just listen for a second.
---
There seems to be a distinct dividing line relating to the platform versus the level of positivism. My feelings, as a PS4 player, are going to be way more positive versus that of a PC player. Why? Lack of hacking and stability in general are far superior on the console platforms, versus PC players. This, I would imagine, would ring true for most modern video games. I think that is something you need to consider when you look at the FO76 community as a whole.
---
FO76 is a unique animal, one that checks a lot of boxes for me, the biggest is the RPG part. There is non of that any longer, it's BPG, **B**loodied **P**laying **G**ame, so many players just completely miss the point of all these cool abilities and great story telling. It's just "nuke, queen, nuke queen, bullion, scrip", repeat ad nauseum. I am level 153 and still have not launched a nuke. I have never been "hacked", never felt cheated by another player. I may have been grief'd by a few now and again, but what online multiplayer game does not have that? Sure it would be nice to see item previews again, but that does not detract from my enjoyment to just go wander off some direction for an hour. Again, on PS4, versus the PC free-for-all. Does that speak about the FO76 community or the PC community in general?
---
Another thing I want to mention is misinformation, or propagation of bad information, mostly the intent is not to misinform. I don't comment much on Reddit, but when I do it is to address the disparity between reality and one's *perceived* reality. You touched on this above, way better than I could. A recent post of mine was to address a complaint that this "Fallout MMO", as it was perceived, needed to be more like other "MMOs". When, in fact FO76 has never been nor will it ever be an MMO, in the normal sense. If a player goes out and buys it, expecting WoW in a post-apocalyptic setting, they are going to be disappointed for sure. And, will likely comment about it publicly. That may strike a chord with other players, whom were also *expecting* an "MMO like" game. Then the original claim seems justified and the movement snowballs into something that only exists because of a deep-rooted misunderstanding of what was originally intended with said game.
---
Let me hearken back to another, scandal laden game to show my views on modern video gaming. **No Man's Sky**. Not going to talk about it's storied history, just some insight. When I saw the trailers I was floored, just really cool, IMHO. The idea that you can be waking around, hop in your ship, fly away, warp to another planet, land and get out. All seamlessly...no loading screens.......BOOM! Mind blown. That alone was enough for me to enjoy the title for many, many hours. And no mater what, through all the bad press and Internet hatred, that mechanic persisted and was enough to keep me hooked. Well worth the $50 I paid.
---
FO76, *and it's basic mechanics*, have satisfied me for many more hours than the $50 I paid for it. I'm a Fallout super fan, so yes $100/year for 1st is also a no-brainer, for me. How much did I spend on beer last year, or eating out, or phone charging cords? Don't even want to know, but I bet it was ***WAY*** more than my FO76 investment.
---
And lastly, just one more point, **GREED**! That word does a lot of bad things to people. I think it's caused a lot of harm to the FO76 community as well. No, not corporate greed, but *player greed*. As soon as someone is able to make money off of in game assets, it's going to harm the community. The exercise is no longer about fun and making friends, it's about putting food on the table. Completely changes the motive and outcomes. Allowing private sales of game assets is the biggest mistake they made, IMHO. Should be bannable.
---
If you are not getting what you expect out of anything in life, let alone a video game, maybe look at your initial expectations. Were they realistic or just what you were hoping for?
---
Responders, free states, raiders, brotherhood then. Thanks!
---
Good to know, thank you.  Maybe I will give it a try.
---
its really strange because i've been playing on pc since day 1 and sure there are bugs, but massive game breaking bugs? I see visual bugs occasionally, npcs stuck in the floor, npcs t-posing, npcs lagged out and taking no damage, ammo counter bug, there was a bug with the excavator power armor for a while where the weight bonus was applied twice on login so if you logged out encumbered you'd log in with an extra 100 weight until you got out the armor.
---
there was one side quest that was bugged out entirely on launch day that you couldn't complete, couldn't interact with the object giving the quest. that was fixed in like the first patch.
---
I haven't played solid since launch day (I took a massive break during that period where ppl where getting their inventories wiped by cheaters for example, still kinda weary of other ppl) I mostly only play solo and i'm still only lvl 109 because I don't try to power game it, I run a mixed build because I play with no one so i have to do my own crafting which means my int is like 13, minus 4 from marsupial most of my special stats are just balanced, I don't do massive damage at all and I mostly just randomly explore. I've only launched 1 nuke myself but i've farmed enough stable flux to get the best mod for the vault suit (shielded) my weapons still suck and I mostly just farm now for script to play the lotto until I end up with a weapon that will be difficult to replace. trying to just enjoy the game at a certain pace while not specifically trying to rush to become OP. doing collection tasks like finding all the bobbleheads or magazines.
---
but i haven't had any massive bugs, stuck in power armor, nope didn't get that, lost any items, nope haven't lost any items, CTD's nope haven't had any of those either. new vegas was more bugged than this game was even on day 1. new vegas still to this day crashes on a whim.
---
I like fallout 76 even as a solo player its extremely chill. it definitely has elements that break immersion (make it feel gamey), but I just can't say that I find it to be a completely bugged out shit show because i'm just not getting any show stoppers. I play with mods aswell which have the potential to cause issues as they aren't exactly supported. at this stage I think according to the game i've played for nearly 300hrs.
---
when nv released some ppl couldn't even get past character creation. all in all I was quite suprised at how well the game does run considering the track record for this frankenstein game engine isn't exactly perfect. I would never have thought they'd get the physics to play well in multiplayer but here we are. for the most part i'm happy that we got this game engine rather than the first fallout mmo being a wow clone tab target thing. and its just essentially a multiplayer fallout 4. I like that it went this way rather than the other way. I feel like the easy way would have been to make it like other mmos.
---
Same, I'm a stealth build too. I carry around a Handmade, Fixer, and a Nailer. Dropped alot of weight reduction perks for damage perks a few weeks ago, I'm almost maxing on weight if I carry one heavy gun with my normal ones.
---
Not worth the atoms
---
Oh man I really tried to stay but performance on my PC is awful even after trying to fix it for days. Seeing the community complain all the time (can't blame them at all), especially after last weeks patch is pretty demoralizing too.
---
Ended up buying Fo4 and learnt how to intall mods... Having tons of fun and a better experience overall. Hope this game gets better in the future and can come back to it soon.
---
I'm on PC so maybe it's different here.
---
You're goddamn right.
---
I got it for free from game pass.... I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd pay 80$ for it but on sale I‚Äôd give it a shot
---
They said PC. There are no mods for 3, NV or 76 on consoles.
---
Unless we're talking fallout 4, which I know there's a mod to enable achievements on PC but no idea about consoles.
---
***Please pay $17.99 to remove Fallout 76 from your fleshy hard drive grafted into your skull***
---
Also the church steeple in flatwoods can spawn three.
---
Still have a FO1st sub so im here for the long haul.
---
Anything is toilet paper if you're brave enough
---
I think they need to streamline the taming process.  Finding a tameable in a random encounter is a very tedious process.  Tamed my last pet like 3 weeks ago.  Been attempting to find one for my alt and after hours of hopping, to no avail.  
---
But I agree, would like to have some more options. Emotes would be a nice way to interact with them
---
Ash heap. Its lonely down here
---
Not just the nukes! They tend to upload the scripts for effects too, which is very helpful since the wiki isn't always
---
Thank you for the information!
---
I did, but I was just asking this person if you had to pay to play.
---
I shouldn't have phrased it like that. I meant to start the game from the ingame menu. I didn't mean it as in launching from your desktop screen. My bad.
---
from center it is +5 down and + 5 up so  in all direction it is 11 across.   
---
There are caveats when placed on the ground you could be already +1-1.5 and I found that has to do with stacked terrain messing with the cylinder (think of you camp like a soda can in shape.  
---
If you use a telephone pole for example in the bog you will have 6 usable floors. If you place on the ground you will have 4.5 useable floors.   
---
The only way to reach max 11 is careful placement on the side of a cliff and even then you may end up with only 9.5.  Right now I am working on a 6 story shopping plaza using the 2x1 tower method. My 6th story has to be open air though as no matter where I put the camp on a pole it seems to cockblock me just that tiny bit like I can put a full wall up and put a cat head near the top. However I have the max 11 x 11 lower with the exception of a telephone pole blocking 1 foundation.   
---
Hope this info helps if you have further questions I will try and answer.
---
Query, how do you learn this in game?
---
That's so ridiculous.  So somehow no one doing the event got enough damage on her?  Wild.
---
Also documents alot of the scripts in-game
---
I bought it just for the underarmor, so no not really
---
Can't you force mines to detonate though by placing more than 4?
---
It is centered around your C.A.M.P device, I ran in to a height issue when I was trying to build in a high power electrical tower and had to move it up in to the tower and start all over. :-/
---
Double SCORE only affects the daily challenges, and they reset each day. Weekly challenges don‚Äôt double their SCORE.
---
I wouldn't out it past these Devs to design a system they don't actually want completed.
---
*BUT I'D LIKE TO HOPE THEY'RE NOT THAT BACKASSWARDS*.
---
I harvest a lot of golf balls. They not only give me plastic, but cork as well. I bulk and sell that stuff, cause lord knows I don‚Äôt need cork.
---
Couldn't tell you to be honest
---
As someone who is only there for SCORE and couldn't care less about the actual gameplay of it, I find the downtime ridiculous.  It takes too long to find a match, and the lobby is absurdly long.  I shouldn't have to wait 3 minutes after finding a match to even get to the (also, way too long) load screen for the match itself.
---
Nice glossy wooden stairs that match my nice glossy wooden floor would be nice.
---
And then we eat it!
---
Looks like I'm going to actually use my PTS access for once. This looks interesting.
---
Disagree. You are an excellent neighbor.
---
Mr House is in the Mojave, not in WV
---
Build area is a sphere roughly 8 stories in diameter but 7 is about the best you can get out of it because of the nature of a sphere.  So base floor plus 3 up or 3 down.
---
However, you can get use of all 7 stories by placing your C.A.M.P. in a tree or on top of an existing piece of topography or structure so that the bottom of the sphere is just under the ground.  You have to remember though that because it's a sphere when you do this your base platform will not be able to be very big, again because of the nature of a sphere, but as you build up you can then build out.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm a little confused on what you‚Äôre asking. 
---
You want to know the ‚Äúbest‚Äù ally?
---
If so there aren‚Äôt really one. 
---
Go for those with a questline. They‚Äôll give you a mission from time to time. There‚Äôs a chance to roll a legendary when completed.
---
Really worth imo, PA skins are usually 1k atoms if they are different from the usual (re-paints, base PA, etc), and in this case it's quite a good looking skin (thought i would've prefered another color scheme). Weapon skins aren't exactly expensive but that 50 cal skin is beautiful if you are a heavy gunner build. The other goodies are amazing too (If you like roleplaying as a raider), so to me, it's worth more than what you pay for. If you just want one thing from the bundle, i won't recommend you buying it.
---
I am talking about 4 but like you said, no idea
---
I'll let you know the exact stats when I play again this weekend and you can let me know if you want it.
---
I knew it, I knew Bethesda would throw their favorite factions banner onto the atomic shop if we didn't reach the donation amount.
---
If I remember right though the Challenges don‚Äôt mark off from buying them in a vendor, only from world spawns. I have way more magazines than what‚Äôs marked complete in my challenges
---
Lay off the Nukashine mate....
---
Same, I'm staying for sure. Solidarity OP
---
Moreso a problem with the way the game is designed, this wouldn't be much of a problem most of the time. You get showered with legendaries from every event.
---
I had a idea in another thread where you if you upgrade your workshop nodes that you get stronger and stronger waves, that eventually it will make it hard enough to the point where you need a group or be really badass yourself. IF you don't upgrade nodes too much then you would have nothing to worry about.
---
Another way would be to "Force defenses" at workshops  and allow you to choose between group and single player options.
---
No, sadly no. It‚Äôs either one of them
---
Op does sound mighty seditious
---
That was a whole lot of rambling for nothing to do with the ITV. I‚Äôve been playing this since beta. I‚Äôve been enjoying it. Fallout is my thing, TES isn‚Äôt. And just saying that Fallout is my thing doesn‚Äôt mean *every* Fallout is. I like 76. I don‚Äôt care for 1 or 2. Because of the play style. The top-down turn-based stuff. It just isn‚Äôt for me, but I know the lore from those games. When Project Arroyo finally gets released, I‚Äôll play the hell out of that. 
---
Basically if people like the game, they‚Äôll play it. Simple as that. Maybe 76 just isn‚Äôt their style.
---
The thing is, from Bethesda's perspective, they may be look at this more like the Mr. Fuzzy Tokens.  Most people didn't make some concerted effort to grind those, but if they did the events consistently, they eventually made it to the end.  There's no time limit, like in the Legendary Run, that says it *has* to be done by a certain point.  But they've primed their player base to always think along those lines.
---
For me, Legendary Perks are going to be something where if I get it, I get it.  But I'm not going to go throwing all my points into Intelligence and running Night Person all the time to grind as quickly as I can.  That's not *fun* to me.
---
Taking it to the next level üëç
---
IMO toxic positivity just means fanboyism and shilling.
---
It's only worth it if you value the look of the cosmetics and they're to your own personal taste, if you don't like the look of the items included then it's not worth it.
---
If you mean the magic effect to work, you need to use vats
---
Melee, heavy guns, auto rifles, stealth rifles. Those are your ‚Äòmeta‚Äô choices. They all play a bit differently with auto rifles &amp; heavy guns being the most similar. Builds are varied for each but individual searches will show you what perks are the minimum requirements for each and then you have what‚Äôs left over to choose QoL perks to make your play time more enjoyable
---
Thanks for stayin Chief
---
FO3 remains my favorite, and I've played all of the modern ones several times over. It just captured my imagination so hard, and by modding it on PC it's remained fresh with new content every playthrough. 3's ambiance and environs are unmatched, by far the most desolate - feeling fallout in my opinion.
---
Ngl as bad the bugs are I still had fun getting chased by glowing deathclaws when I was lv20
---
Yh this post gives me a headache
---
‚ÄúThe philosophy of hypocrisy‚Äù yet the post is full of contradiction. 
---
People defend the game because they enjoy it and want it to be good, some people probably go further in defending because they feel it‚Äôs fallout being attacked rather than the management of the product. 
---
People also don‚Äôt want to hate on devs/ cms who are trying to make a game, no one who works on this game cares about the money it makes or how many bundles it sells.
---
The problem is the money people and it always will be, the ones who make a fortune but have never seen a ghoul. 
---
Yet they fail to realise if they backed the game properly then it would be more profitable, and there wouldn‚Äôt be any controversy over atom shop prices or memberships. 
---
100 % can‚Äôt blame a positive community or a small dev team, it‚Äôs just we‚Äôre all powerless because we can‚Äôt reach the higher ups.
---
Can't launch the game is very vague.  What does it do exactly?  Locks up, crashes, double click and nothing?  There are a million ways to interpret can't launch the game.
---
They're all annoying.
---
Watoga would likely be HORRIBLE as a map.  The city itself seems like it would be great because of it's verticality, but in reality while it has very tall locations it actually has very few of them overall.  Even if they're not as high up you get far more out of just the monorail tracks, rooftops, parking garages, overpasses and fire escapes in Morgantown.  
---
You also have to take size into account, Nuclear Winter maps are actually quite large and a "Watoga" NW map would actually cover almost the entirety of the bog.  Watgoa itself is relatively small and the vast majority of the map would just be wide, flat and relatively barren bog with the few scattered locations providing any substantial cover.  If there were more trees or if the trenches were more expansive or better designed it would be one thing, but as it is now it would be a real stretch.
---
Order of Mysteries it is.
---
BoS? PoS.
---
I think it would be cool if they actually hired a radio DJ to do a fallout radio station for 6 hours a day and then looped it four times. I bet they could even find a rotation of college students studying broadcast who would do it for exposure alone.
---
They could use music from the prior games as well as the massive amount of public domain music from that era to fill up the playlist.
---
exactly
---
I disagree.
---
There's always been this leveling dead zone somewhere between Lv. 20-50 where you can't reliably deal with stuff to the East if it spawns at max level, but the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap don't produce the XP you need to make meaningful progress.  If the enemies are leveling with you, and their XP increases accordingly, that shouldn't be a problem anymore.
---
You are correct, but I'd rather play a modded game that has tons upon tons more content, and much better visuals than play it vanilla just for trophies.  I mean, I get it though, I hunted achievements on the original GoW on my Xbox 360, but gave up on striving for achievements well before I got my XB one, PS4, and built my latest gaming rig.  It's far more enjoyable for me to just play the game, trophy/achievement hunting just feels like a chore and takes the enjoyment out of the game.
---
But, if someone truly is interested in it, there's nothing wrong with playing through the game on vanilla to get your trophies, and then modding the crap out of it and replaying it.  I won't even bother playing fallout without mods now unless it's 76, mainly because 76 doesn't support mods yet, and I'm not holding my breathe for mod support based on the developers track record.  I played through all of them except FO1 &amp; 2 and got some achievements, now I just mod them until they break, fix it, then play.   Last time I looked at my FO4 install I was over 100GB on PC, all due to mods.
---
Added an image.  Its tricky to place, but doable. Be below the mounted head for an easier time.
---
So if I was say level 250, and I kept half of my cards because I use them, and swapped the other half for these coins. How many coins would I likely have, and how many perks/perk levels could I get for that? Anybody able to do some 'back of the napkin' maths here?
---

There's actually already a Harper's Ferry map in the game files, it was data mined alongside the Morgantown map before Morgantown was even released.

Wade Airport/Charleston is also in there as well but it's a MUCH smaller map so not sure what they might have had planned at some point.
---
Amazing photo opportunity!
---
&gt; rip Pistols forever and non-god tear shotgun builds. it would have been nice to have a weapon balance pass. because I can't recall the last time I saw someone use an energy weapon that wasn't a Gatling, Guass, or a duped legacy explosive.
---
I use the plasma caster &amp; tesla rifle. Also the flamethrower though that has been changed to flame damage now.
---
I know it's not in your list but technically the enclave never died out as MODUS is still alive and kicking.  Think it gets a star though next to its name as MODUS was never alive to begin with lol
---
I was investigating this just two hours ago! Found this post, basically, if you can perch your CAMP on a ledge then you increase your potential build height in the build-bubble.

Keep out of the mire, only the most resilient vault dwellers venture there... welp not anymore. Anyone can defeat any enemy at any level now? Not having lvl scaling was the best time gating feature they had. Part of what kept me in this game was knowing once I get stronger I'm gonna come back to an area and get my revenge. Now we are all gods I guess.
---
We get it. You vape.
---
Like I didn‚Äôt already have enough personal restrictions when searching for a new building site!
---
how does this affect camp pets you can tame?
---
because my lv21 deathclaw would get slaughtered by anything that attacks my camp if it doesnt scale also
---
There is, but it varies depending on where you are, and unfortunately, you can't really visualize it until you reach it.
---
So excited!  Make sure to equip **Good with Salt** Perk!
---
Yes I can melt stuff but it doesn't make silos any less scary. I have only launched one myself (with a team) and ran maybe three with other people. Guess all Im saying is Im still a noob
---
Twos shot 50% limb dmg is a crippling machine in vats. If both detonate within the radius of your target, you can cripple and kill most mobs. Use it with grenadier 2 and its great for crowd control. It can one shot most humanoid enemies lvl 62 and under. I have the single shot m79 version.
---
Appreciate the math vault dweller!!
---
I just posted this but honest question incoming.....
---
Why do we have to fuck around with points and all that crap??
---
Give us a choice every 50 levels to either choose a new legendary perk or rank up an existing legendary perk. Simple. It would give you a long term goal, and if they introduce 3 or 4 new perks every few months you could create new builds with the 6 slots to keep things fresh.
---
As far as duplicates go, I want them. Just give me a hide option to keep them from cluttering my menu.
---
Currently level 335 so I should be able to pick 6 perks or max out 2 cards fully. Or any combination I want. 
---
Level 700 players should be able to select and rank up all kinds of things. Being that high of level earned them the Legendary status imo.
---
The girl who's always playing the same guitar riff is the worst of all...
---
I click and it doesen't start, almost like it tried to start, but stop after like 1 second. I havealso tried dubble clicking. I am currently reinstalling the game, and have deleted more programs that I won't use and can disrupt the lauching of the game, I am going to restart the computer after I have redownloaded the game. I am also again updating some system thingys in the armour crate app.
---
You can just delete it. Don‚Äôt need to destroy it with a trap lol
---
Play FO1 and FO2 as well.  Dated but fun.  I played when they first came out.  Just a note when companions die it's permanent. Choices matter and have lasting impact on quests.
---
In Fallout 4 if your companion had them in their inventory they'd occasionally light up. That wasn't that long ago. But I can't see an emote for it. If nothing official, maybe a mod for it a little later down the road.
---
Nope. I washed him clean of his past. So he roams with a bathrobe in my camp now.
---
Sneak vats automatic commando is hands down the best
---
not a problem, Yeah, I thought it seemed wierd too, but it woulden't suprise me either. But I'd like to give the game a try, espesially when it's on sale.
---
One can only hope fellow member.  I do fear that our time won't come till after fractured steel.   Time will tell.

Settler wanderer: guitar solo 24/7

Red asylum is still rare.   
---
Responder fireman is rarish (had a small degree of duping)   
---
Pirate is still rare (if not the rarest)  
---
Long coat is rare  
---
Pretty much everything else is uncommon or common now. I am sure I missed 3-4 like the jumpsuits, but I get offers on those 4 often when people see me wearing or see in my inventory.
---
My biggest problem is it feels like this game hasn‚Äôt had any growth since wastelanders. People are bored.
---
Ya agree fully!
---
You can only build at teammates bases in private teams. It would be to easy to mess with random people's bases with public teams.
---
It doesn‚Äôt bother me
---
Wait what pirate outfit

Your property value haute went up lol.

I have despatched said items via Appalachian Mail, a Mr Messenger should arrive within the next 276 years. Unless it loses a navigation sensor module.

As long as I get my treasury notes it's OK, hard though not to get annoyed.

Vault 96
---
I noticed that smoking isn't a thing in fallout. There is no addiction or buff/debuff for smoking. Yet there are smokable items everywhere.
---
It wouldn't surprise me, with Bethesda being in charge, that you'll have to pay real money for bullets.
---
Hope you can get it to work, it does look pretty fun.
---
little patch rebalancing weapons. ask the folks in bf5 subreddit what they think about it...
---
Damnit you jinxed us! Just watch there be a BoS paint be fore every single armor spread out across the board as a reward!
---
you might get 1 rank up for a legendary card. it was originally calculated that you would need over 1330+ levels, zero perk cards, no duplicates, and no special changes to level up 6 legendary cards. and if you kept 100 cards, it would taker you over 1500 levels to max out only 6 cards
---
Resist and stay strong, double score points is coming soon..
---
I feel like this is a point a lot of people are missing. Think about what happens to your build when you can apply up to 24 additional SPECIAL points and perk cards (I think it's 24 at most right? 6 slots with 4 levels per card?)
---
I personally I tend to equip one rank of the lockpick card (as it was last spoiled) and then try to rank up 5 SPECIAL perks. 
---
As it stands since my main only has 3 points in endurance, I can theoretically move 1 of those points somewhere else as well, since a max ranked endurance perk card should give me enough to now run both fireproof and adamantium skeleton together, instead of one at a time. That essentially nets me 5 points for another special column. 
---
Hopefully I am interpreting the data correctly.
---
I‚Äôm going to be optimistic for a second.  
---
People are excited about many of the re-designed legendary perks (I‚Äôm super excited about the +3 lockpicking/+3 hacking just at rank 1).  These add a lot of power To characters, especially ones that add a +5 to all status with perk points.  With 6, maxed, it would be like wearing a permanent (but better) piece of unyielding gear. 
---
In current state, we don‚Äôt have a lot of challenges, sure they announced some from ITV today, so we‚Äôll see with the PTS how tough they actually are.  
---
But maybe (and here‚Äôs where I get positive) the plan is to have other ways to earn coins besides just the packs.  We already know they have started adding perk packs to the SCORE, so maybe some of the operations will (if you can complete in a set time frame) give us coins?  Thus speeding up the grind.
---
It‚Äôs still a grind, just a slightly faster one?
---
Is that a bad problem though?
---
In the older fallout games there were simply places you *did not go* till you were a higher level because if you did you would be destroyed by certain enemies there that didn't scale down to your low level.
---
Having a high level escort you there and play god sort of ruins that whole aspect of the game. Some enemies should be an impossible challenge for low level players and a serious challenge for high level players. Enough of a challenge that it should make you want to tell your lesser equipped friends to avoid the fight for their own safety (and if they tag along, stay out of sight or reach).
---
It seems like it adds more realism, but I guess we'll have to see how it actually is in-game.
---
Why are you also so salty, let me have my little rant, it doesn't actually make any difference does it.
---
Thanks, but looking for the official list. I had one at one point, but not anymore.
---
The one from halloween, it was super rare to get. I only got 1 outfit and 6 pirate hats. I've had insane offers for it but since I have everything there is never anything I need.
---
I do agree and i have said on multiple occasions that they should change score and remove dailies, and just do weekly and seasonal quests(Kill SQB 30 tmes, complete encrypted 5 times), and more weekly quests unlock throughout the week stopping with friday. 
---
Dailies should be replaced with 5 -6 repeatables (Kill 25 legendaries, get 10k exp, breakdown 250 items,etc) They just can just make it so there is more score needed per level to balance this.
---
IF the score quests could just be banged out all on one weekend instead of FORCING you to login every day this system would be a lot more tolerable. Weekly reset would be so much less burnout then being forced to play everyday, i barely have the will to do my dailies on certain days because i have other things in my life going on and i am sure everyone else does too.
---
 It doesn't feel fair to get left behind when you want to take a small break. I shouldn't have to spend even more money on the game then i already have just to get a few rewards on the run that i want.
---
I think a weekly reset would be perfect for this system.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sure I did. I‚Äôm sure a Bethesda employee read my comment and was like ‚Äú Hey look guys they really enjoyed the ghille skins, let‚Äôs do it again.‚Äù Lol
---
While they likely threw the ghillie suits in there because they had them lying around, you stand a better chance of alienating players by going 100% in on a theme than if you mix things up by tossing in off-theme rewards as well.  Not everyone is always going to be on board with a space theme for example, so it helped to throw in stuff like the sink, chicken coop, fireplace door etc to provide goals anyone might enjoy.
---
Modus would be most pleased
---
Its been almost 2 years but they're finally implementing a level scaling system. Thank God. No more running into level 76 Floaters or level 68 Charred Feral Ghouls as my level 22. Should have been in day 1, but I'm glad non the less
---
Yeah, and I love lore, so I have been watching lore videos for month now. I also saw that people said the game was better after the new DLC's, so I gave it a chance, but I hope I can get it to lauch, because if I don't it was a complete waste of money.
---
It turns out instead of having more employees working on the game, a majority of them are assigned to monitoring reddit accounts on r/fo76.
---
It took a bit of finagling but he's right, and it looks amazing.

Wish there was a way to shut off all the quest givers dialogues after the first time you heard it.  I hear Sweetwater and Ward in my sleep now, I swear.  If Beth would just let me click on them and get the quest or hand it in I'd be so happy right now.
---
You're one of the "toxic enablers" mentioned in the comments here. I see you in *every* post even remotely critical. "Game is fine, you're the problem, I didn't really say that, if I did I meant something else and it wasn't so bad."
---
I want the Welcome Home sign
---
Yeah and what happens when they final add more legendary perks I I dont wamt to use the maxed perk anymore?
---
Amen.  The system should simply reward perk coins (or whatever card level up is used, but I guess we‚Äôre stuck with coins...) on XP gained across characters, similar to the paragon system in diablo 3.  It doesn‚Äôt punish people that play 1 character all the time, it doesn‚Äôt punish alt-a-holics.  Yes, you may hear a few people that deleted characters complain, but frankly a system has to be created going forward that makes sense, and reaching backwards doing the best it can.  Make the stupid coins from perk cards a bonus to the system, where you can scrap duplicate cards for a flat XP, put it out there and be done with it.
---
I don‚Äôt get why THIS is the hard part.  The hard part of this system should be having to pick only 5 (or is it 6) cards from a plethora of cool choices.  So far much more work needs to be done on the cards than the system.  The system ought to be freaking easy.  For sure, we‚Äôve got better cards than we started with, but there are tons of ideas for more and/or better ones out there.
---
Wow, that‚Äôs profound. *eyeroll
---
There is no official list.... there is what people are willing to trade and that is it.   
---
There is this list but it is outdated since both western outfits are common and now the scav vendors sell certain rare clothes making it easier to find.

---
Even thought there are two, it's really like there is only one. Flatwoods hardly gets voted through. I've been wanting one at Watoga for awhile; new maps are long overdue
---
Ahh I missed the Halloween event only thing I didnt do hoping its back this year.
---
It‚Äôs just so hard to only choose 10. They are all amazing in more ways than one
---
Nuka world would make a nice BR map. Wish they would try something interesting like that.
---
The worst time I had on one violent night: 
---
the event was on but nobody went there and it was active for 8min. So I put on my ghoul armor and fast traveled. Only about 7min left and I jumped on a banjo and the position was perfect as 7 ghouls attacked me but only one could push his way through at a time. The whole 7 min right down to 10sec left I was in the red but just doing it. I was thrilled I was clutching this event!
---
Made the windigo spawn and I was going to die getting off the banjo. GEUSS who shows up? A guy one shots the windigo as I respawn. I wasn‚Äôt that pissed but I had to say something. Put on my mike ‚Äúyour fuckinh welcome, I just revived and clutched this event and then you stole the windigo. Congratulations.‚Äù He did look ackwardly sorry and just left it at that. Continued  the game as normal as this didn‚Äôt set me back in the least. I just clothed the event solo. I had fun.
---
So as I understand it everywhere sugar bombs spawn there is a chance for them to be irradiated?  Wish I could irradiate the normal ones.  Been looking and yet to find any irradiated
---
The raider punk won me over the first time he said, ‚ÄúGo get ‚Äòem, tiger.‚Äù He will now always be my fave. I need that energy in my life.
---
Mayne OP was referIng to keeping her but without playing the guitar.
---
Of course not lol. I mean 9800 caps at the vendor and 1050 scrip in the machine that resets once a week.
---
ah, yes, flextape.... turning an annoying NO! NOO!! NOOO!!! into a senusal MMMMMH! MMMMMMMMMH! MMMM! :D
---
This is what I get for trying to help.
---
Edit: you're the guy that yelled at me about tattoos the other day. That clears things up a bit.
---
O ok, i hear ya. Thanks for that list. Im ap out of the loop on apparel. Power armor user so apperal is useless too me
---
Those Enclave folks are dead....the new Enclave is different. We are built from patriotic Vault 76'ers who are willing to do whatever it takes to rebuild America....if we sometimes break some eggs, that's the cost of doing good.
---
Yes you can trust me
---
You pick a new Perk and work towards it? 50 Levels and you'd be able to max it at 5 coins per perk.
---
I think the worst is in nuclear winter. One card every level. 4 out of 5 will be duplicates and it costs way too many points to buy the cards you want.  
---
Also it's tied to your adventure mode level which is really stupid as a build in one may not be the same build you'd want in the other. So back to the grind on a fresh adventure character to get special points to be able to have the build you want in NW. Oops, now you've leveled up you overseer rank to 25+ and you are still missing the cards you want.
---
I strangely like NW and I normally hate these type of game modes. But it needs work.
---
Of course not! I have pledged allegience to every US president and especially supported FDR!
---
Nah I understand, the silo run is pretty intense, that doesn't make you a noob imo
---
If I really loved raider aesthetics, I would probably get it. Since I do not, I did not. But it seems comparable to most other packs they sell.
---
Yeah, me too. I hope you can get to launch as well.
---
I couldn't tell you what the problem is, because I don't have a PC. I looked up a tutorial on it, not that you havent already. I only found stuff from a few years ago.
---
This event is really making it obvious to me just how many people dislike the BOS. It's really surprising, I always thought nearly everyone loved them and I was in a small minority with how much I hate them.
---
Yeah, I'll never max all of the cards. Been playing since B.E.T.A. and am only about 215. I don't have the time to grind out those kinds of levels. And I'm already getting to the point where I'm wanting to play some of my other games so I'm taking a break when I finish the legendary run.
---
Someone else already asked, but if enemies are going to scale with us, will our camp defenses finally scale too?  Turrets are already mostly for decoration as is, they're only going to be more useless if everything everywhere scales to us.
---
There are the 2 main allies, which are named that have a questline and after finishing they will start giving you daily quests. And there are 3 unnamed allies which will give you just daily quests. All of them have a chance to drop legendaries once completing their dailies.
---
List goes as follow:
---
-Sofia (Astronaut)
---
-Becket (Dude that wants to set up a bar)
---
-Settler Wanderer (Guitar player)
---
-Raider Punk (Raider?)
---
-Settler Forager (Old dude with dad jokes)
---
Here's more info:

---
I finished monday without buying ranks or exploiting.  Totally regret finishing so soon.  I know I may be in the minority here but I actually really enjoyed logging in and seeing new challenges to tackle and grind out.  Something to work towards that I could clearly see progress every time I logged in/out. Season 2 cant come soon enough.
---
Yes, and cranberries turn to crimson flux. Lots of that too.
---
How does the PTS work exactly?  You're using your regular account but just separate characters that are just for the PTS or something?  Season rewards are account wide and tied to the atom shop, so it could be likely that allowing you to unlock them on the PTS is more complicated and could carry over to the main game and cause issues.
---
Yeah, I got my friend who is basicly a computer wizard to help me, but we coulden't figure it out, so we are trying everything we can think of.
---
Her headaches turned into nightmares.
---
i'm still one shoot lv 80 like nothing with just a regular shotgun so I'm ready! prob lv.50 is the top there.
---
Gotta remember there's alot of people who like them but won't actually be talking about it. Your more often to speak about something you hate rather than like.
---
Oo interesting
---
Does your character, even remotely, have all that much insight into the bos?  All i see is a faction that valiantly fought to the last man trying to eradicate the scorched. 
---
Ther techno hoarding aspect is not emphasized in any of the holo tapes except one where maxon mentions preserving technology to prevent another apocalypse but that's it.
---
You are allowing your own personal meta game knowledge from past games to taint how tor character in 76 "should" react.
---
These days have been my first time playing 76 and it's lonely, all I see are people giving me free stuff and it's cool but I want to communicate with people.
---
How long is it up on the store for?
---
Being grindy is supposed to be the point.  This isn't supposed to be a system everyone can max out easily, it's supposed to be something that you're working toward for the lifetime of the game.  It's not like they can just come out with Legendary Perks 2.0 in a year.
---
Fallout 3 and Elder Lyons was peak BoS for me. Elder Maxson and Fallout 4 was the reason I sides with the Minutemen.
---
Enjoy your stay
---
COAL HECTORS
---
Exactly same here, I also had the issue that Penny didn't waited for my response and ran away
---
The first thing I completed the quest is to check if they are in the foundation(didn't missed the player vendors in the middle btw). Can't say I don't have fears that it might overwriten my options before and kinda affects the future events or quests, like game will render them in the base, but just like how the OP, game just decided I can only reports to Peige or something
---
(I completed the quest just last week btw)
---
The other reply mentioned Peige being harsh on the talks, lol, maybe I should pay a visit to the Penny and Jens tomorrow to check then
---
Yeah, I can't even imagine.  I'd never do that.
---
I was making refeance to how made the current implied system is and how much wasted time and point it would be
---
I don't really mean play god with a low level in certain areas that are WAY out of level. I mean helping them their first time against something near their level that they may be unprepared for...just a life line. For example my friend can play through the game just fine, but he was totally unprepared for the deathclaw on the island so I came along just to help him out if he needed it, and it worked great. He had the terror of that first deathclaw encounter and getting shredded (it was just slightly over his level, but he's at lvl 15 so totally lacking the perks to carry the encounter), so after he fought it a bit and needed it I just helped out. That won't happen anymore, this time it's a fight just as tough on me no matter where I go.
---
I DO agree that low level characters shouldn't be joining high level characters going into places like the bog...it's too tough, and should be too tough. 
---
I personally like that as  you level up you can start to explore more into tougher areas and eventually the whole map. The ability to curb stomp low level monsters gives you a sense of gaining experience and getting tougher...still having to worry about fighting those same monsters you worried about 50 levels ago can take away from that.
---
Totally. Mistress of Mystery was easily my fav quest in the vanilla storyline. It would be much cooler to expand upon one of those IMO
---
It works for all hits.
---
Something like a Vampire Mr. Handy Buzz Blade, which procs several times a second, can basically heal you like a Stimpak.
---
But the point is, it's always a fixed amount.  The amount of healing doesn't correspond to the damage you do.
---
I'm sure there will be 3, maybe four levels for an enemy. A minimum, a maximum, and 1 or two in between.
---
I never started it..  
---
But I cant accept the pain of knowing Todd Howard is somewhere laughing at the fact that he sold half a game to his fanbase and continues to release the other parts of the game for a price... 
---
The fact P.A skins cost just about half of what youd pay for a expansion pack(DLC) is ridiculous bot to mention that 76 was a solid wack in the teeth to the fanbase of the fallout franchise with a sch40 steel pipe rolled in epoxy then covered in wood screws and filled with concrete
---
I just assumed that they may do something akin to a damage cap, like maybe a single hit could only do up to &lt;insert random number&gt;% damage.
---
Can you not get a big jump at all? There is a cooldown. You only get 1 big hop, a medium and then a cooldown. 
---
I disagree that frog legs is necessary to play NW though.
---
LoL I'm more of a unsalted cracker
---
I think "hate" is a relative term. Given the freedom of story that Fallout 76 gives us (a new region with new factions), bringing back the BOS break lore and just seems like lazy writing by BGS.
---
I mean, you could have an awesome story written around old Responders returning - maybe those who might have escaped across the Ohio or Free Staters, perhaps. Then you have MODUS, who's already in region &amp; a potential spoiler / villain you could write a really cool story around.
---
And don't even get my started on the lost opportunity to "Kill Zax" and do a whole DLC on Vault 51.
---
Seriously?  These "time gates" you people are always whining about predate mobile gaming by decades.  I was being "time gated" by mmo's almost twenty years ago.
---
All I could find is stuff about putting you computer in optimized running mode. I hope you guys can figure it out.
---
Me either
---
Honestly we need something like a legendary system for power armor. With different effects of course because being able to get WWR and sentinel on power armor would be OP and broken, but some additional effects for each set would be nice. Better if they were craftable with legendary modules
---
Until august 20.
---
They did mention that some areas might not scale at all - like the Cranberry Bog, which would be almost exclusively a high-level area.
---
Am I the only one who can't see the items. Either the banner or the beret. They are invisible to me :0
---
Oh ok. It sounded like you said it wa only up for today.
---
I have no doubt more people like or don't mind them rather than hate them, but even knowing that I'm still just surprised the amount of backlash I see towards the BOS. I really thought I was one of the few since all my friends just gush over them.
---
The Burrows was a victim of community hype.  it was never supposed to be anything more than a new dungeon with some added story and the community took the "dungeon" part and ran with the idea that it was going to be the new instanced, endgame, god gear farming activity.
---
Yeah, I think that's what we are bascly doing right now, like turning off the antivirus programme and the VPN.
---
Aaxxo never returned to vegas, he became half mineral, half animal and floated forever through Appalachia. And though he wished for death, he was unable to die. So eventually, he stopped thinking.
---
The LMG needs some mods too, it has... Zero.
---
Yep, that's basically what I saw.
---
Edit: looks like if you don't have directX installed, that could be the issue.
---
This is where we are now. Reminding Beth to do her chores and get things ready for events
---
The New Deal was at least godless socialism! Fetch the heavy incinerator!
---
Just because you start as one doesn't mean you have to define yourself as one though or else there'd be two factions in the entire series, Vault Dweller and Wastelander, and that would be a very boring wasteland.
---
they did advertise it as being difficult and recommended a group of 4 50+ characters.
---
harpers ferry might come, some day.
---
also a little map of Charleston was datamined ages ago.
---
Hey you forgot about... no wait you've got Morgantown on there. Good list.
---
Maybe season 3 can be arms race
---
I really wish there was a way to make her stop saying anything, her dialogue is so limited I am tired of hearing her.
---
I can't complete Wastelanders. Weasel won't blow up the last wall, I just run around the stupid cave but nothing happens
---
Yea I get that, not to mention the other issues, like not even spawning in at the same time (wtf? How is that a thing), or the hackers and even worse the lack of permabanning said hackers, or lack of different game types within the Br, like shotty/sniper or explosive/energy weps.
---
But what can we do really? There should be a semi separate team working on nw and pvp, but the devs clearly aren‚Äôt supported enough by the company and it‚Äôs just frustrating honestly.
---
Been playing on PC since Beta and I can tell you that I have seen all the bugs. I have a LOT of video too
---
if shits like the ammo converter or any future machine are good, it would be unfair for new people that didn't played S1.
---
it's better if they are trash, wonky and not worth other than sitting there and look good like another cosmetic for the camp lol
---
FO3 is great and I think NV is my favorite for forcing a clear cut moral decision on the Legion.
---
I understand its a valuable plan, I just can't see paying that much for it.  My commando build has some other decent guns, guess I would be more in the 4 to 5k range.  Guess I will just keep looking, maybe some day i will  luck onto a cheap one.
---
Just add accessory slots to each piece so we can plug enhancement modules in. If they're absolutely insistent on everything being an rng grindfest then have the modules be the grindy part.
---
What's your favorite ipa? Mines' arrogant bastard
---
&gt;  Power armor user so apperal is useless too me
---
Even full time power armor wearers need to look good when using a crafting station.
---
Ah, that may be why. Bummer :(
---
Atomic Shop content is essentially disabled on the PTS.  You login with your account, but you are given duplicates of your characters to mess with, which have no impact on the live version of the game.
---
Insurgent at the moment
---
&gt; No one pushes or makes plays...
---
Oh sweet summer child
---
Wow, that's a really cool idea.
---
That's great. I know it's hard to take advice from an old guy sometimes. Just keep the goal of good health in mind when making life decisions and keep on pedaling.
---
That's right!
---
Only In the lobby is it big. In the match it is small like I'd say smaller than a regular jump. I can't even hop over the fence at the dam.
---
I tried the vats crit with the two shot fatman on it too, the two dots just track like missile, they even turned 60 degrees once in the midair
---
Haha true, but im kind of a minimalist. Dont want things i hardly use in my stash. I like my Chinese stealth suit and some bos outfits. Everything else has got too go!
---
What exactly does it take to level up these legendary perks? I know people thought the requirement to max out even one was far too high but can't find the exact information online.
---
One legendary perk I would like to see is one to gain a wild card slot "!" that would let you run an additional perk (or multiple up to the limit) that doesn't fit into your build without raising the stat with capacity equal to the rank (so 1 to 4 points worth). This is functionally similar to the current SPECIAL Legenday Perks but world serve as a balance between the want to use more than 15 points in a SPECIAL without raising the stat above 15.
---
We need some non Canon fan service areas. The Strip from NV including the area around it. 
---
Boston from 4. 
---
Some part of DC from 3. Must have subway tunnel somewhere. 
---
Didn't play the games prior to 3 yet but something from them too would be great. 
---
Even have map specific loot. Guns and armor from the game the map is from maybe? Like NV uniques could show up or something. Might be cool.
---
They just auto close tickets about this issue to reduce numbers. It‚Äôs a terrible customer service practice that tainted me towards their entire company. I submitted and resubmitted for a week before they just stopped auto closing them and even then I‚Äôve been in limbo for about 3 weeks now.
---
I just haven't had anything thats stopped me from progressing, visual bugs, there are plenty, game breakers? perhaps i'm just a lucky bastard but i've been around the entire map and I haven't had a bug that has screwed me completely. there are definitely issues with the game I don't want to say that there aren't any issues. but I have been able to play this game solid without getting a crash at all for hours and hours, according to steam I sunk about the same amount of time into new vegas, but then I remembered that you if you ran new vegas with the modded exe, it ran outside of steam so I probably wracked up wayyy more than 300 hours in that game, for me it used to just randomly unhandled exception multiple times per day. I haven't had 76 crash to desktop once or maybe I did get a ctd in the first week but since then, not one. for me this fallout has been way more stable. which when you factor in the multiplayer aspect, it still surprises me that it run as well as it does.
---
I like my shotguns.  Get a decent instigating one and you'll one shot just about everything in vats
---
I won‚Äôt stop playing, but I am disappointed in patch 21...
---
Like
---
Swap damage range of bloodied and berserkers effects.
---
(Eg bloody -50% to +50%, ber 0% to 95%)
---
Bloody would still be the highest dmg (adrenal@50%+bloody@50%+nerdrage@20% = 120% 
---
vs ber @95%
---
Junkies @50%)
---
Berserkers becomes viable, bloody isnt just the auto-go-to
---
Floating in space forever...
---
Me, I enjoy it. I casually play. Run a quest or two. Accidentally make it to a spot too many levels above me and run for my life. It's fun.
---
Yep for real I‚Äôve gotten better customer support from activision.
---
I don't yell at people over the internet, but okay. Every. Thread.
---
This is ridiculous.
---
Being 90% dead 100% of the time isn't as bad as it sounds. 10 percent dead is enough for you to survive being hit by most enemies when you have the various buffs associated with a bloodied build. In fact, I'm pretty sure the high END from bolstering increases your health pool anyway, though I'm not sure if bloodied works on a percent of your health or a flat number.
---
 Like, people go on about how hypothetically easy it is for a bloodied to die, but I just *rarely* see it happen. When push comes to shove, your obligatory marsupial mutation can get you out of the way of melee enemies, and ranged enemies tend to be weak enough to melt in literal milliseconds with a bloodied build. In interiors where you can't just meme away from those darn ghouls... they die before they can get to you, because all you have to do is sit in a hallway with commando weapon and fire away.
---
The problem is bloodied has so much synergy it's insane. MAYBE the only other prefix with any synergy is junkie if you use chem-enhancing perks. And even that is really weak. I think other prefixes that have a "downside" like berserker or junkie absolutely need buffed. I don't know so much about stuff like mutant, since you can really minimize the downsides of most mutations. Probably take it up to 15 or 20 percent instead of 10, 10 percent is negligible for a lot of weapons.
---
Sir are you trying to falsely incriminate a US president? I don't think they are bringing that incinerator for me if that is the case!
---
I really wish there was more tie-ins between the MoM &amp; the other factions. You don't hear about the Responders talking about "Mysterious Women Warriors" or anything....
---
The fire totem is dope
---
&gt; Settler forager: dad jokes
---
How could anyone NOT want this guy in their camp? Dumb jokes and a constantly upbeat personality without lines that get annoying when repeated. I genuinely like Gramps.
---
So it looks like I need to keep my out for a 2 shot or quad cryo, and throw the crystalizing barrel on it.
---
I noticed someone mentioned 2 cryos in the group being a good option.  I don't really see very many people using them on Xbox will I be able to bring a positive to the fight if i am the only one?
---
I really don't care to be a support guy in this scenario, but I don't want to be wasting my time either.
---
In case you haven‚Äôt listened to these holotapes, here are links to BoS holotapes with Roger Maxson's thoughts on what he thinks the Brotherhood of Steel‚Äôs goals and procedures
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/About_the_Brotherhood
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Preservation_of_technology
---
This last one, this is my favorite BoS note:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Anonymous_diary_page
---
BTW, the above doesn't take into account the notes and tapes from the other factions all bitching about how the BoS would order everyone around, rather than negotiating.
---
So yeah, they can burn as far as my vault dweller is concerned.
---
I mean you're not wrong, but their point is about their frustrations with the game. Which is also not wrong to put that out there, in the grand scheme of things no one cares for either side of the coin. Points being made are just peoples point to make, like I don't even care about my own point I'm making here. The only thing that can take from this whole post/discussion is how stoked I am to see some awesome games titles coming out in the near future. I personally love dipping my toes in new open world games so I'm kind of impartial to all this.
---
Ha! Stoop kids afraid to leave his stoop!
---
Add to that bloodied and unyielding armorsets, and you have alot more strength for all your scrounging carryweight.
---
BE50 lmg very OP or B50c25 fixer
---
You're one of the lucky ones. I've played it on two different computers in two different time zones, with Google fiber, with Comcast and with optimum.
---
Same damn game, same bugs. Makes no sense
---
Nearly all vaults have all those things unless they‚Äôre set up as an experiment vault to explicitly not have one of those things.
---
Seems fine to me. They shouldn't just be freebies they are legendary something to work for, quit being an entitled brat.   
---
Also say they went with 1 point per level you earned right...yeah go ahead ask for that...6 x 400 = 2400 levels needed then or 1200 if they stuck with 2 points.   
---
So honestly not only do you sound entitled but we can add stupid to the mix.
---
76 years here ...  me to  commodore pc first one    way back...
---
love this game  pain and all   so a few glitches... life also brings them too.....
---
Done deal. GT?
---
And shootin' muties.
---
I wish there was a way to shut all the npcs up..always saying the same three lines is getting pretty damn annoying
---
I‚Äôve worked in software engineering for a decade and I‚Äôm 99.999% confident it‚Äôs not the devs fault that Bethesda ships products to market too early.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they were only given the supplies for the 25 year period that was set for them also No oxygen
---
The Philosophy of Confirmation Bias.....
---
20 minutes of looking critically at this sub will yield a significant number of criticisms, concerns and bug reports. 
---
Your entire argument falls flat because you make the mistake of considering this sub the fallout community. 
---
Most 76 players aren't on this sub. This sub represents a sliver of the player base, and as such, you over exaggerate it's sway/impact.  
---
I also notice you do alot of self congratulating....
---
I see Sept 10-14 but there was another one that was supposed to happen in August. When was that one?
---
Agreed on more tactical stuff. The Insurgent and Mountain Scout outfits are some of my favorites in the game, and we need more things like them. Plate carriers, pouches, kneepads, etc combined with casual clothing is a cool apocalypse aesthetic.
---
It looks like each NPC interaction is instanced.
---
Dilute the stimpacks that you find (they healed me enough throughout the game) also use food for healing (favorite wheel) or sleep in a bed when possible.
---
It kind of depends. 
---
Everyone can talk to the NPC in their own instanced conversation. There is also an opportunity to ‚Äúlisten in‚Äù to another teammates conversation.  Either way you don‚Äôt need to wait for them to finish. 
---
One thing I will say is any quest objectives that take place in instanced interiors you may need to enter solo, otherwise you‚Äôll need to do the objectives multiple times so everyone progresses.
---
Str: 15. All shotgunner cards/scattershot/blocker (all max)
---
Per: 3. Skeet shooter
---
End: 3. Fireproof 2/radicool 1
---
Cha: 6. 1 travel agent/1 squad maneuvers/1 strange in numbers/3 tenderizer
---
Int: 5. 3 nerd rage/2 demolition expert
---
Agi: 9. Action boy/evasive/enforcer (all max)
---
Luc: 15. 3 bloody mess/1 grim reaper sprint/3 better crit/3 serendipity/class freak and starched genes.
---
Actually, I'm a game wienie. I just love shootin' muties.
---
This. My entire build is a gross ass mutant who mostly does radiation damage (perpetual agony for no one but myself). As is mutant prefix is kinda irrelevant. Like, even as a side prefix to stuff like junkie or bloodied, it may as well not be there, which is a shame.
---
I think you are in the same spot I'm in. With the acid deposit?
---
but who is rushing the low lv. other than someone that want another characters? and why that group would be a priority instead of the bugs and qualify of life changes that we need for all the people that play?
---
It‚Äôs a video game. You overslept by a year lol.
---
&gt;Signed,  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The Community
---
Speak fo yourself, don‚Äôt speak for the community. You chose to try different builds on one character instead of using your other 4 character slots.  I have tons of unnecessary cards, and even more now that they are throwing packs at us during SCORE.
---
I want to turn in unnecessary cards to clear up my collection of cards I‚Äôll never use.  How many levels did you waste swapping points around, I mean are we talking 10 points here or did you waste multiple levels moving points around to completely redesign your character (instead of making an alt)?
---
Edit: and to add, I‚Äôve moved points around on my characters too, small tweaks here and there.  But even with that between my 5 characters I have so many stupid cards to get rid of.
---
go play call of duty  might be more in line what youre looking for.
---
hey, we're in the same timezone!
---
ign is "crimsonfail" and discord is "crimsonfail#1337" 
---
I also cant add your discord because it's missing the 4 numbers but if you add mine ill accept  and i'll add you ingame now  :)
---
I'll check it out, thanks for the tip.
---
I'll say the same thing I'd say to the post about leaving. Good for you. Still don't care.
---
I mean i know next to nothing about developing games or game marketing so I'll take your word for it on that one. But they just don't think about the consequences about what they implement into the game. Unless that's not the devs fault either, idk.
---
No problem.
---
The 90RW fist would be useful for a character who's not really specced into melee.
---
If you think it's bad here, try posting anything critical on their official forums.  You'll be banned and run out the door by their schills for 'bashing'.  At least they can't come here and delete any and all criticisms about their broken game and company.
---
Perhaps fascism and those who openly support it became a lot less popular in the last few years.
---
(Yes, that's sort of blithe, but I'm not going to apologize for it üòã).
---
With one hell of a hangover.
---
That‚Äôs what I run my strength is at 1 but with full uny secret service armor I am a tank with basically all the benefits I love the build
---
I‚Äôve seen lvl 600 to 3000 players on ps4 and when I go to their camp vending all excited it‚Äôs trash. I think a lot of people are cheating levels. I hope there is another mechanic but reasonable one for reaching and EARNING these upgrades.
---
I considered them but I don't know of any lore saying they had interaction with others groups and that is how where factions were on the survivors timeline. I can't consider mudus really since he is a bot. If we counted bots then none of the factions ever left or died out since they all have robot vendors
---
Thanks! Looks like a stealth rifle will be the easiest to pull off with my current spread, but I'll begin planning for something heavier when for the long term. You can only change one stat point per level, right? How long does it generally take to "respec" in the sense of special points? Seems pretty slow
---
people would use the one or 2 cards that works with bloodied and forget the rest. if you keep playing maybe one day you would rank some card lolol
---
Modus*
---
Not really what you're asking, but I think Beckett is the best. You can buy Nuka Colas from him to make NukeGrenades, and you can use him to see if your vendor cap limit has been reset yet. If you could sell to him as well, he would be the single must-have companion.
---
Mocking self-absorbed attention-seekers is a hobby of mine.  
---
Seriously if you feel like some sort of fucking hero for being a FO76 Stan you deserve mockery and lots of it.  You included.  lmao :-D
---
My late father-in-law got me hooked on gaming with Atari Pong and I haven't looked back since. It is a great escape from a lot of those life glitches.
---
Yeah, I didn‚Äôt get any previews pics for either. Which feels kind of fitting for this one as I‚Äôm also unable to find it in the build menu.
---
I would love a hooded tactical outfit with realistic sized pouches and shit.but yeah, armored up tactical casual clothing would be amazing
---
Me too. I've been playing since beta, 1970 hours. All 5 characters LVL 150+, main at LVL 403. I finally got sick of the constant put offs and event let downs. I can get over blue screens during a frenzied queen or Encrypted, but the CONSTANT put offs. I am a fallout peasant as of July 1st. They need to earn my money and they have shown me that aren't capable. Hence I am back to playing Fallout 4 with new mods. Its good to be back in the Commonwealth even if Preston Garvey is right around the corner. One this is true is that War.....war never changes.
---
Get pharma farma and eventually you will have more stimpacks and radaway than you will know what to do with.  For immediate stims just go give the brotherhood some junk
---
There games have aways been like this. I remember playing FO4 for the first time after having just finished the last of us. 
---
Basically my review would be:
---
It‚Äôs not as technically tight as tlou, the story is nowhere near as engaging, but it is a lot of fun to play! that‚Äôs my same thoughts with 76. It‚Äôs just a fun game, it doesn‚Äôt need to have amazing cut scenes or prescripted combat. It‚Äôs a fun open game where you have A LOT of flexibility to play how you want to play. I like that.
---
I started the game 4 days back now, and i must admit i got quite startled when it said that I am "several months late" to leaving the vault. 
---
At first that had me very confused, until I realized that it probably went by release date of the actual game, and i just found it amusing that I am appareantly the lazy child of the vault family
---
they would give you some perk card coind in the next season pass and considered done xd
---
^ Read title only
---
even if he did understand, it wouldn‚Äôt matter because he was captured by blood eagles, which are raiders but worse and are not affiliated with them
---
You can use an auto like a semi if you want.
---
I use a plain lvl 30 fixer with auto receiver but I just tap the trigger like a semi-auto. It usually fires two shot bursts this way.
---
I'd say that's the #1 pro of fallout. You can be whomever you want, go wherever you want when you want. The freedom is the greatest part of the series imo
---
it did boggle me too because on launch week ppl were ripping the game a new asshole, while I jumped in, walked down the hill from the vault, I met a random dude and we played together for 30hrs straight, I was crippled at the end of our play session but I did have a lot of fun, the guy I met and played with wanted to pvp with everyone but he wasn't a native english speaker I was trying to tell him that most ppl are probably going to want to level up and don't really care for pvp at this early stage. seeing this guy trying to get pvp was hilarious, we launched a nuke at about level 35 I barely had the ammo to do the silo and then the SBQ after it I was pretty much completely dry at that point. but we managed to get through to the end of the main quest without anything putting a wrench into the mix, I do remember that one side quest that was just bugged out completely in the beginning and I do remember various visual glitches like ammo not showing when you log in. but I just never had a huge bug that either made me rage quit or get frustrated, I think if i did get an issue a relog would fix it. like if an area had been cleared out or if there was some bug going on with npcs, logging out and then back in again would remedy the problem for me.
---
I mean the Brotherhood were literally the only ones to take the scorched seriously and everyone else though it was a minor threat. They were pretty within their rights to start demanding stuff to deal with them.
---
Everyone says they can tell I'm on chems, only buff I have is well hydrated well fed
---
Yeah I wish I had $ to get a nice pc. I would totally be a pc gamer!
---
This, I have over 140 level points and about 20 perk packs, ive been able to experiment with my build and still have plenty for legendary perks, so yeah I dont think he speaks for the community, only for his own choices.
---
I only don‚Äôt want him since he doesn‚Äôt seem to give out quests right now
---
unfortunatly I already have it, so thats not the problem, hopfully it will get fixed after evrything is done and I can restart my computer.
---
I didn‚Äôt enjoy shotgunning in VATS at high frequencies, it kind of makes the flow of battles choppy. I‚Äôve enjoyed my agile shotgun build way more. I run a bloodied gauss shotgun but the only shotgun perks I run are enforcer and skeet shooter. I usually run a demolition perk for the damage boost but you can easily go north of 1400 damage without it so it‚Äôs not necessary. I have 11 Agility and 15 luck to help keep my AP up as much possible. Zooming around on my jet pack and hip firing/scoping with the gauss shotgun is the most combat fun I‚Äôve ever had.
---
I would like to be able to scrap cards I'll never use.
---
It's annoying scrolling through them all.
---
I am also a disabled combat vet.  Add me IGN DollaBill_138
---
That Golden Tuxedo / Dress that was bugged, and unobtainable unless you had another outfit ingame to craft
---
For a bit of fun, make a new character and go talk to the overseer in Sutton. There is a dialogue option to tell her ‚ÄúI actually just left the vault‚Äù and she is incredulous that anyone was in there for so long. And she tells you to get an alarm clock.
---
I love how they call it out.
---
I made one on an old mule for laughs. In most cases the build works fine (bloodied with full unyeilding ap refresh set). However when it comes to the queen I‚Äôm just kinda there. I can easily get in my minimum damage to loot her but I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm much help in taking her down. I‚Äôm also using revolvers üòë. But it is a fun build just for something different.
---
where is the antagonizer?
---
bithisdi pls, all these mechanist cosplayer out there... we need to teach them a lesson
---
Can i get help
---
They  seem to want us on 24/7
---
I respect it.  :)
---
Are you also a shotgun build (all perk cards etc)?
---
I'm also worried, scratch that, I know for certain they will have forgotten about this system when developing One Wasteland, and our pets we think are safe in The Forest etc will now be decimated by level 50 wolves and mole rats as are pets will stay the same level 14 gimped POS they are.
---
Yup there are reasons why the other factions didn‚Äôt care for them, they‚Äôre raiders with a purpose as I believe was noted by gage in FO4.  
---
The problem is, we won‚Äôt see a solid story play out, or at least I‚Äôm not expecting it.  They could be hostile to foundation because they want some of their preserved tech.  They could be hostile to crater because crater is more antagonistic to everyone else.  Theres also reasons they could work with each faction.  There‚Äôs nuance in the factions that would be awesome to explore.... that we won‚Äôt get sad to say.
---
I came here for the same thing lol
---
Really hope the Armor Ace scoreboard has rewards that arent rejected Nuckear Winter rewards, everything else sounds good though.
---
That sucks. I hope it'll run when you get it restarted. That's the only thing you can hope for at the moment.
---
I think all of the pre-76 opening factions stupidly committed suicide by not cooperating. The difference was your original argument was that my opinion wasn‚Äôt grounded in 76-specific lore. I showed my homework. Take care and enjoy the cool BoS loot, because I‚Äôm clearly in the minority here regarding the BoS. :)
---
Right. It‚Äôd be like if there were a group of people concerned about a respiratory virus pandemic that most people didn‚Äôt take seriously so they took it upon themselves to enforce rules to mitigate the threat like wearing masks or not binge drinking in crowded spaces with strangers.
---
Agreed. I‚Äôve only found Beckett, her and that weird old dude. That other woman and raider guy I‚Äôve yet to come across
---
Mount Blair might be interesting since there would be no bushes and it would be more open
---
Nuke planter. I just want the nuke planter.
---
I think it's a good idea. Instead of capping the amount of currency I can farm, they cap the amount I can turn in. So if I can play an entire day but I cant play the next 2 days, I can gather 60 notes and just by logging in the next 2 days I can exchange them.
---
It's very good for us.
---
of course, maybe you are thinking of not capping it at all. But that's impossible in any mmo. Games that are for playing X hours, finishing them and not looking back, have that. Games that are supposed to play "forever", need a cap. OFC it's a pitty, but a necessity
---
Nuke everything, including the lost lvl 20 trying to find his mommy. NUke em sky high!!
---
Ones that spawn in world will be irradiated, In the stats it will just say Rads: 1 above the HP value, ones from the processing plant and the collectron don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs a pain ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Try the map spawn locations near Watoga from map76. Don‚Äôt pick up the plans if you have them already. Then server hop. I think Harper‚Äôs Ferry is another option in the building with the display cases right where you spawn in (floors 1 and 2).
---
So you disagree with some folks over the internet who downvote your posts, dont overthink it man. Some people are satisfied with the state of the game, some arent. Some people enjoy things you think are garbage. I dont recognize that there are too much positive posts, on the contrary. In any case, of course people (like me) would rather read a nice story about a father playing f076 with his daughter or something, more than the literal 100 times the fast travel bug is posted about! I guess that makes me part of the toxic positivity problem. Anyway, took me 10 minutes to write this, so feel sorry for me if you downvote this.
---
I've tried i haven't found any I've been doing it for a week
---
released next Tuesday
---
A bunch of fairground and whitesprings runs and you‚Äôll have your cork.
---
What's the point of grinding and leveling up if everything will be scaled? One wasteland is such dumb decision
---
That wasn't me before but I see your point.
---
They're in the future.
---
Should be with the rest of the flags, right? USA, Meat Week, etc.
---
You were so close, yet so far. I agree with about 2/3, you took a few too many left turns are reaching too far with some of your points.
---
They are trying to teach you a lesson. You know: "Don't actively play the game" 
---
We never told you about this, but we plan on adding a feature that needs perk points, So we are going to constantly nerf, balance and change builds and weapons so you need to use up these almost useless perk points. That is beyond the the simple fact some of you want to try a few builds. You know, what some people might call, PLAYING THE GAME.
---
Surprise!!! We now make these perk points useful. What a bunch of stupid gamers..... look at them, they used up all their perk points. What a bunch of idiots. They are all level 300+, points will come SUPER slow, they have none left... THAT IS HOW YOU MAKE CONTENT BOYS.
---
yep, and if that doesen't help I'll complain to steam.
---
Just wait for meat week, if you‚Äôre planning on grinding that you‚Äôll probably do the repeatables a ton of times
---
What vault is closed for a year?  76?
---
Nah I wanna blow up your dollhouse
---
Lockmasterg#9449 thanks
---
they only scale to their current max level, so a level 52 gutsy would not go any higher, it will just scale up to that
---
I think of the BoS returning is going to be a lot like the Wastelanders expansion. The BoS will make ATLAS their version of the Crater or Foundation, where players show up for quests, loot, and grinding, yet seemingly no one else ever interacts with the other factions at all. Meg will never attack Foundation, and the BoS isn‚Äôt going to seize a MFing crashed space station from a group of raiders. That would interfere with the grinding.
---
There are few things I hate more than people signing off for me.
---
It's sad that this is the rational response to news for this game now. I have the same reaction to any new announcements.
---
#amazing. Thanks
---
Will do!
---
Strange have you tried taking it off and putting it back on.
---
I'll add thanks.
---
People were duping legendary modules. From what I‚Äôve heard it took several thousand each to get a really good roll. Someone I know used 10k to get one god roll chest piece. These people could flood the market if they were tradable. That said, there should be a way to move them between our own characters. My bloodied build has some nice vanguard and my high health has a killer unyielding left arm......
---
Hoard like there‚Äôs no tomorrow üëåüèª
---
Dude, I‚Äôm terribly sorry. My bad. I‚Äôll donate 250 whatevers to the BoS tonight. :)
---
One thing that seems to not be mentioned is that if you have alts those coins will go into the pool. While I am at 300 on my main I have a level 134 a level 96 and a level 92 also. So take my 300 I have 210 unused points including card packs my others are an average of 40 each. So 330 not counting perk packs, nor the perk packs from the board. So let's call it 66 perk packs. So I am sitting on 1188 perk coins already on this year old account just from not moving points or taking cards. This does not add in the extras I already have. So right out the door I know I will have 2 fulls and 4 1 stars.    
---
This seems fine to me, it should not be a hand out. I should not day one have 6/6 full cards as it would give me no reason to press on. There would be no goal which seems like what they are trying to do with this.
---
Yeah, it was a Patch 21 screw-up. BGS said they'd release them with the hotfix next Tuesday.
---
I‚Äôm trying to recreate my fallout 4 house I made years ago
---
I have, nothing seems to be working I was hoping somebody had a similar problem.

PSA =/= 'hey look at this neat thing'

Hippity hoppity, Brotherhood off my property!

it was there from the beginning -but still cool to see someone discover that mate, i usually bow first and then do the mothman dance twice before i quick travel.
---
They cycle content in and out of the atom shop constantly. It left last week.
---
Were you playing nuclear winter earlier?
---
i usually sell each of them for around that each but i'll hook you up. i'll throw in a free helmet as well
---
either post your gt here and i'll invite or message me
---
You never know, one day you might cancel fo1st and then you‚Äôll never need to store scrap in your stash, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing for when I start uni next year, no way I‚Äôm gonna be paying for it as a poor student so just saving all the scrap now
---
Did you play nw before joining adventure mode?
---
The whole point of magic weapons is you stack damage from repeating hits, it's way harder to hit her if she's not landed. So yes, 6s kills from when she initially lands.
---
if only I could have gotten the diving suit T_T
---
Alright inv

Raider guy is the least annoying imo. Plus he has a cute radio setup.

Cranberry relish, brain fungus soup

Yeah, you're right, she just never seems to land for me.

Are you kidding me? Lol, thanks for the help though I‚Äôll make sure to check it often :)
---
Console fps, it's atroucious in Morgantown and Watoga whould be no different.
---
BoS is actually a very nuanced faction. Each game showed us something different about the group, leadership styles, inner conflicts, and what their mission is supposed to be about. The main 76 campaign leaves a lot of questions about how we went from a band of army soldiers making a last stand against the scorched to what we‚Äôve seen in the other games. I think MODUS commanding an Enclave bunker with working nukes has to absolutely play into this DLC, if no other reason as to be a driving force for their return.
---
The other factions have more story to mine as well, but the main campaign made it very clear most of these folks stood their ground and died to the plague or became the scorched we fight. Narratively, this sets the stakes higher. People have already returned, but it would make sense if these groups would start to pick up the tattered flags from those who fell before. For example, a rekindled interest by settlers to build up the Responders or a group of folks unhappy with Paige that break off to raise the Free States flag again in a sort of civil war.
---
There is a lot of story potential, and if they do this well, BoS could be the catalyst for the other factions to have a resurgence and new factions to rise up.
---
bro if you aren't one shot a max level DC in the game right now with non legendary shotgun then your build is no good. melee prob 2 hit max since you can get stagger.
---
Lockmasterg#9449
---
Last week? I've been back on this game for a month solid and haven't seen it once in that month, you sure it was? I'd be pissed if it was üòÇ
---
I'm joining
---
Yeah, which is another reason I'd like to see something maybe more tied to the camp and plan/recipe.
---
I'm in a build team and south of watoga
---
i find most of my plans here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/ and then i pop up to NAR repair yard and check inside the hut on the table. Then i head east along the rail tracks and chck the train car.
---
Any idea where to find him?
---
I also remember the (normal) .50 receiver of the hunting rifle is actually the hardened one due to it's damage numbers compared to other .50 receviver, also it's broken extremely fast with two shot effect, it's like it should be faster, but not that fast compared to other weapons and it's damages
---
I'm also curious about this. I'd hope our pets would be able to scale now instead of defaulting to the minimum once they get to our CAMP, but if not then it's just another reason to not bother trying.
---
What Fallout 3 did showing the schism between Lyons and the Outcasts was great. In a way, the BoS in Fallout 4 struck me as the angry child from that divorce.
---
It‚Äôs a sound bug. Basically anytime the game has an update to your characters status it plays. Hungry? Thirsty? Catch a disease? Too much weight? That sweet sweet Jazz riff will get you through.
---
I just eat melons. It‚Äôs really easy to plant and just pick up and eat. Just shove them into your hot bar and your good to go for a couple of hours.
---
No need to waste time or mats cooking.
---
I genuinely dont remember writing this
---
My two shot auto grenade launcher got bugged like that when I was switching from my plasma Gatling. Now I can hold 500 grenades, which means I can shoot during the whole scorched earth event, for instance. 
---
Trying to find that legendary loot after the bouncing has made some players angry, sure.
---
Nice.
---
I like it.
---
Now let's make it a reality.
---
Floor Decor
---
Bad news. You cannot wear the stuff until 35
---
From your lips to God‚Äôs ears, sir.
---
‚ÄúBut then I met someone, a stranger, but that stranger isn‚Äôt a stranger anymore.‚Äù
---
I think u send request but it didnt show üòÖ is ur name Tyrinot 'cause im trying to add u but it wont accept
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve taken off my Enclave officer outfit ever, my friend gave it me and I‚Äôve been wearing it ever since
---
Nuking camps is something that was intended from the beginning.  You are playing the game as it was designed to be played.
---
It would be better if you now started as a new immigrant to West Virginia that came back with the other npcs. Would even work better with the way wards treasure quest line. You could just be another character looking for the treasure. To still fit with the overseer quests you could have been a vault dweller that originally left when the vault opened and the returned with the npcs.
---
The devs are probably worked to death trying to keep this ship afloat, this isn‚Äôt about devs being incompetent, they‚Äôre clearly understaffed and underfunded
---
That's why i put Them in a floating shack, away from the center of my c.a.m.p.
---
And anyone who doesn't like that will be annihilated!
---
If they are planning to add places like Charleston and Harpers they better work on console performance first, in Morgantown there are still huge framerate drops especially in the center, Charleston and Harpers whould be no different, maybe even worse and don't even get me started on a possible Watoga map, 10 fps with rooftop campers, noob tubes and Vats plasma grenades.
---
You have to select it and than move your camp
---
I think he means pipboy numbers. My gauntlet shows 2000 and ends up hitting for 18000. But you can't trust buggy numbers. My Gauss rifle hits for 1400 but removes less health that my handmade which hits for 500. Buggy buggy.
---
Damn straight.
---
With 4 months is that enough time for that and Fractured steel? Plus the way they made it sound at quakcon was steel dawn coming next patch lol. Most companies q3 dlc would be out this or next month
---
Floor decor
---
Wait, you're saying a company that has a chronic issue of missing deadlines isn't actually missing their deadline again but doing the community a solid is the more logical position? And you think that's what I'm mad about? 
---
Really?
---
Wow, I just feel sorry for you. No wonder Bethesda can get away with so much bs.
---
Me too, buddy. Me too.
---
I hate them since the first time I saw those turds in New Vegas
---
Ella's bunker doesn't have much but they are there too
---
I mean, that's true, but they probably could've done better to space the ghillie skins out between seasons instead of dropping them all at once. Wouldn't be as athematic and would still allow them to release them through the season pass.
---
Ya thats me I also have another character Lockmaster .
---
Yes. Pretty easy to know if it‚Äôs been completed or not with the whole 0/1 and 1/1 plus score
---
It's actually not too expensive these days.  For the price of a console when they launch, say $500 like the XB one X, or $400 ish for the PS4 pro when they were new, you could pick up a decent prebuilt desktop that could easily handle FO3 and FO NV and a few other things.  Once you've got the basics, it's not too bad to save a few bucks here and there and upgrade a little here and there.  As long as you don't try to stay on the cutting edge of tech it's really not too expensive.  I put mine together the beginning of this year for right around $1000.  I went a little high end though.  Brand new x570 motherboard and a ryzen 3700X.  A little pricey, but that hardware will get me by for 5-6 years before it starts showing its age and struggles to run new games at that time.  The only thing I will need to upgrade in the next couple years is my gpu, but I've got another year or 2 to save $200-250 to do that.  
---
I actually took a $450-500 HP desktop and made a decent gaming rig out of it.  It was back in 2011.  When the Intel core 2 quad was still the hot thing to have.  Bought the desktop as it was, spent $200 on a graphics card, and it ripped through any game I could throw at it.  For $700 total is was impressive.  Sold it to another guy and he ran it as I set it up for almost 3 years after that.
---
If you just want to dabble here and there, you could get something used for probably around $300-500 these days that would be plenty powerful enough to handle fallout 4 and Skyrim SE.  Cut your teeth on it so to speak.  If it's not your thing, then you've got a computer that'll be plenty good enough for kids to do schoolwork or web browsing for the next 5-6 years.  But it's a decent base to start with to tinker and learn.  Not too expensive, but powerful enough to play with.
---
perk card isnt as good as unyielding as you cannot go above +15
---
Wish I could be more help but frog legs runs counter to my pacafist bush wookie lifestyle.
---
Only one I didnt check....tyvm
---
I agree 100% to this. If you're viewing the world from the eyes of your character their idea of the BoS is very limited. We often impress our own worldly views into the game and through our character.
---
For me I know my character won't like the BoS because of an innate distrust of any hierarchical faction or group of people at all. But we don't know how the BoS will be post 76 opening as it hasn't happened.
---
In that case... I look forward to hating the BoS üòÇ
---
It all good I appreciate the help!
---
Could you create that build for me in nuke and dragons? If not, that's ok and fine :). Your build sounds fun!
---
Normally because of the Server or other connection problems  the game cant   
---
rly deal with the damage  then
---
I‚Äôve never used cork and never really paid it any attention but I had some how 500 cork. So I just donated it not like I need it. Though I did see someone sell like 8 bulk cork for 250 at their vendor.
---
Junkie double barreled with scatter decreasing mods, using general damage perks like Bloody Mess and rank 1 Adrenaline. I have Adrenal Reaction as well, but I'm not a bloodied build so it only triggers when I'm actually at low health. In addition I'll pop Psycho (or its other derivatives) if I need an additional damage boost. I normally go for body shots, though VATS is highly entertaining due to the high gib rate.
---
I‚Äôve been putting it in my vending machine for zero caps, but nobody‚Äôs buying it...
---
you guys give some good argument but you guys are living in pipe dream.  Bethesda does not balance their games like blizzard does(they never have).  they will stop any weapons that are grossly broken OP but that's about it. blooded build is here to stay
---
Had to make sure. seen a lot of people on here easily miss things.
---
Same here
---
It's a known bug that sometimes Shotguns will have the rubber band effect and the enemy will heal. Fortunately this rarely happens with me. Not sure if the type of shotgun matters. I use a Junkie's Pump Action and can one shot most things in VATS.
---
It's all you can do if it doesn't.
---
MMO's also used to just charge a flat rate instead of nickle and dimeing you as well.
---
There's super mutant body parts at Emmet Mt. disposal.
---
Thx!, do you use power armor? And what mutations?
---
Camp building enthusiasts would disagree, but im not going to argue semantics over a video game
---
I don't think this should be considered a bug. I think it's fun.
---
didn't know you could drink inert Flux.  Thanks for the heads up.
---
That's not how it works from what I saw on the PTS forums.
---
Rank ups and Coins earned are exclusive to each character.
---
Otherwise you could just keep making Characters and hitting Level 5, then deleting them and making a new one, rinse and repeat.
---
How about no points at all and just use our character levels? The whole points system is trash.
---
Im curious on this as well
---
This makes my faction **Imposter Sheepsquatch**
---
Isnt the new instanced camps concept along the same lines?
---
The game is a buggy, horrible excuse for a game, with an atrocious main storyline, which they have yet to fix completely, or improve enough to qualify for that original $60 price tag.
---
It‚Äôs been TWO YEARS since launch. In that time, they have released 3 major updates, all of which were almost unplayable at launch because Bethesda didn‚Äôt test any of it. 
---
In Wild Wasteland, in order to get the backpack, you need to do a metric fuck ton of useless challenges. Fun!
---
In Nuclear Winter, to get the ‚Äúgood‚Äù rewards, you‚Äôll need to play a metric fuck ton of Nuclear Winter, fun! Oh don‚Äôt worry, after an hour long match consisting of nothing but inventory management and hiding, you‚Äôll get a grand total of around 50 caps and 1000 xp. How rewarding! Oh, don‚Äôt worry. No matter how skilled you are, no matter if you can win every single gunfight you get into, you‚Äôll get killed, rather easily I might add, by someone using a grenade launcher/ explosive bow and frog legs. Guaranteed!
---
Finally, we have WASTELANDERS. The dlc they were hyping up for months! Instead of fixing the game and improving the original, shitty storyline, they‚Äôll have you help out all these new people settle into Appalachia, your territory!, because they heard about a tReAsUrE. Nice! Once you‚Äôve beaten that storyline, you‚Äôve unlocked, wait for it...
---
Almost nothing! Sure, you got 500-1000 gold bullion, but that‚Äôs just enough for a single gun plan or maybe an armor mod for a set of armor you can‚Äôt afford. In order to unlock the rest of it, you need to do repetitive daily quests for several weeks, or months!
---
Oh don‚Äôt worry, once you‚Äôve got said plan for a new weapon, you‚Äôll need an item you 100% don‚Äôt have unless you visited the purveyor and bought one for no reason. 
---
You‚Äôll need ‚Äúlegendary modules‚Äù. Very fancy. You‚Äôll likely need 2-3 of these to craft a new weapon and they cost 50 legendary scrip, a currency only gained from selling legendaries to the legendary exchange machine. Don‚Äôt worry though! Because, at best, you‚Äôll only be able to purchase 3 of these and that‚Äôs assuming you did the math just right to get all 150 scrip out of the machine. Now you can craft that new weapon! Once you finish, you discover, Oh no! The weapon is a junkie‚Äôs, blocker‚Äôs, and a vanguard‚Äôs version! Welp, time to wait an entire day for the legendary exchange machine to reset so you can create one more weapon. You‚Äôll likely have to do this several times to get one that has at least 2 decent effects on it.
---
Or, let‚Äôs say you want to complete the legendary run and get all of that sweet loot. But you discover, to your dismay, all of your daily/weekly challenges have been completed, but you haven‚Äôt moved up at all in the legendary run. No matter, just get on tomorrow. So you get back on the next day and discover that it happened again! Don‚Äôt worry, this‚Äôll keep happening to you for weeks and it is STILL A PROBLEM TO THIS DAY! How responsible of the devs to, as per usual, ‚Äúfix‚Äù an issue and then completely ignore the repercussions the bug has had because they failed to fix it for over a month.
---
Also, remember what I said about how you have to wait a day to unlock the ability to get enough scrip to craft one of those endgame weapons? Well, turns out, you can only get enough gold bullion to purchase a single mod in a day, no matter how much you play! So if you want, for example, the ultra-powerful t-65 power armor, you‚Äôll need to get on and earn 200 gold bullion, every day, for weeks or even months! Nice!
---
Or how about this, you‚Äôre wanting to build up your camp as much as possible, so you go and make some money so you can buy up a ton of plans! Cool! Now the issue here is the fact that you have a max limit of money. Every type of money in fact, so you can‚Äôt just make all the money you want, for some stupid reason.
---
So, you see, it‚Äôs not entirely the fault of the community. It‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs. Every. Single. Update. Has been buggy, poorly thought out, and designed to increase the amount of time the player needs to put into the game rather than increasing the player‚Äôs enjoyment.
---
The majority of the things they have done to the game don‚Äôt increase how fun the game is. They increase the game‚Äôs lifespan by forcing you to play longer to get anything good.
---
Bethesda, in the words of Mags from Nuka World, ‚Äúwill get respect when they EARN respect.‚Äù
---
This happens to me every time so idk if is my internet connection or the server so =\(-_-)/=
---
Exactly.
---
People who leave aren't leaving for attention, casual fallout fans don't want to have to do a currency grind every day without much actual content to participate in, lore people don't want to play a game the retcons just about everything from the originals and the Bethesda games, builders who were enjoying building camps as the endgame content don't like having features ripped out of the already clunky building and the only additions being micro transaction items to build with, and people who love playing new events and get excited about community challenges don't like when the people making the game don't even play it so they have no idea what is fun or worth investing time and resources into. Its great that you're staying and finding enjoyment out of the game, It could use more people who care so that Bethesda puts some effort into caring as well.
---
Thx!, I personally don't know how everything around mutations is working yet and how to utilize them correctly, never even had one yet. I want to get along without them for now I think
---
So I'm doing that damage that *the game* can't process it?
---
Anyone have a link to all this legendary perk info?
---
I am me!
---
Tried running it as admin? Or windowed mode?
---
I don't care for 1 or 2 myself.  
---
I quit for many months can came back to it. I do think it can get stale even with all the new stuff they're releasing.
---
No, how selfish could that be?  
---
I don't know where you got that but you misunderstood what I posted.
---
Cool
---
I'd say last day of the season?
---
Animated cards are a bad idea in their current state too, regardless of legendary perks. If they cannot be traded or acquired outside of leveling up, nobody will ever see a lot of them and all the animations are wasted. Either make them like cards you can collect in the world, or make all cards animated so that everyone gets to enjoy those.
---
Well, they wiped all the PTS Forums on the Bethesda site, but the Fallout wiki still has a good chunk of it:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary\_perks](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Legendary_perks)
---
Great your staying now how does this post help\[ the developers to make the game better for us who care? How does this post critique or evaluate the current state of the game and every piece of new content that gets released in a terrible state? Oh that's right it doesn't, its just another smart ass, ass kissing post for the select few with no complaints.(Whoever that fucking is.)
---
Yes to some degree, but it sounds to me like the instances camps will be in a underground setting, like a basement . I could be wrong.
---
I would start claiming them
---
Oh well that sucks then. I mean I guess I would have enough to buy 1 rank each on those 3 and 1 full and 1 3 star and 1 star.  I won't be losing much.
---
That's actually the issue of the wastelanders, the dialogues in other previous titles seems have more perk related options, wastelanders do have some, but not much.
---
I also not quite happy to the fact there are so few SPECIAL checks you can use in all the ally quests, my character have INT 15 and many options actually felt like I only have 4, no offence, just generally felt not so special
---
Well now we will never know
---
as someone whos spent hundreds of hours across every fallout game, you get used to the graphics quickly since they dont matter a whole lot. new vegas has much smoother shooting with ADS and different combat helping chems along with beautiful writing, you would love that game since its all the good stuff and no pointless currency grind
---
Yeah but its only one possibility could also be the shotgun glitch mentioned below but always has been there
---
I mean, yes, we can definitely do that, but we shouldn‚Äôt need to resort to that for clearing a challenges: that‚Äôs the result of poor design for this (as well as several other) challenge(s).
---
God, that's pathetic. You have my sympathies bud. Keep fighting those demons though.
---
My God. How the hell did this post make it own of downvoted hell?
---
Kudos for you doing so, especially because of the lack of formatting.
---
Sadly I'm afraid that will only preach to the choir &amp; those wilfully blind sycophants will dismiss this &amp; all reasoned critique as hate until issues affect them personally (maybe even not then).
---
You did good today.
---
its just typical reddit circlejerk. nothing special really.
---
1. yeah there is alot of fake positivity here, it ebbs and flows just like the fake outrage does. one week its one, the next its the other. all the real discussions tend to get eaten up by the noise.
---
2. alot of people are new to the game, and dont realize what is or is not likely to happen with the game going forward. and some people here try to over correct for the repeated bug reports and other issues
---
3. making a bunch of moralizing statements and linking a bunch of random articles about how "cheaters" are this or than, is actual pretty condescending and shows a lack of understanding of how each exploit does, or does not effect other players. ive seen plenty of hacks, but because of positions like the one you are taking, im seeing more and more people who scream cheater every time they lose in a fight or see something they did know was possible. not just on the sub and forums, people actual go and harass people they think are cheaters. hell, i get shit from new randoms for being a high level. its getting really annoying, more so than the actual cheaters and hacked weapons. just like in real life, taking hardline positions on complex issues just means that you will end up being wrong,
---
4. doesnt matter what type of content you make, or what you do, you are going to have annoying trolls and bad faith detractors. its the internet, and trolls are just the birds chirping. its less and issue about toxic positivity or "cancel culture" and more plain typical internet shit. however, if you keep getting the same type of trolls, and people accusing you of being toxic, you might want to evaluate whether there is any truth to what they are saying. I watch your content, and i have to say you are often very condescending and i can see why people might get rubbed the wrong way. you mostly put out news and guides, but i think you put a little too much opinion in them, and thats undermining any objectivity in your videos.
---
Whatever height it is, it‚Äôs a cylinder not a sphere. You can build to the same height at the edge that you can at the center, thus not a sphere by any geometric definition.
---
Well good for you then, buddy.
---
why would you "save" them? there is no downside to claiming them now.
---
I have a pretty basic camp. Nothing too fancy. 2 small water purifiers, a collectron, set of crafting tables and a few lamps, lights and doodads. Would it be better for me to get the small vault generators instead? Do they take up less camp budget than a fusion gen?
---
I second that.
---
 I found the broken radio vacuum tube, but I can‚Äôt repair it at the tinkerers workbench like it‚Äôs telling me. Anyone found a way around this?
---
Most probable answer: Enclave, cause 99% of their membership are robots meant to function continuously for hundreds of years.
---
Real answer: Tunnel Snakes.
---
triangle chest was the true golden age of gaming
---
I have no idea. I just know they need to test one wasteland
---
I use a BE25 Pump action shotgun, and I never get the rubberbanding, but certain enemies like to survive with 1 hp despite dealing enough damage to kill it 5x over.
---
Wait? Theres more than those? I wasn't aware there was a choice beyond those..actually I didn't even know there was a choice to begin with. Morgantown is all I ever get stuck on.
---
people dont trade high end gear in player vendors lmao. you are not going to be buying B25s for caps my dude.
---
Ohhh okok ..m well seems like i would have to find another weapon then
---
Easier said than done when you don‚Äôt have a ton of legendaries or an amazing weapon at your disposal. 
---
Also, people play the game for different reasons. What floats your boat may not be what others enjoy. Different strokes.
---
Don't need to, referring to the 'decent reply' part, of course. I like Apex Legends though, I do not like fortnite (or anything by Epic games). Perhaps you were close. Also, based off the \_87 in your username, you're barely older than I.  
---
You're the one that doesn't fully grasp my original comment here haha.
---
First off, op (mayaterror) is my friend. We play 76 together regularly, so I was just messing with him and joking around. Of course, you had no way of knowing that so you kind of walked right into that trap by inserting yourself into something rather harmless.
---
Second, calling people who play Fallout 4 'losers' was a joke to my own self detriment. I love Fallout 4 and am a prominent mod author on the Nexus for Fallout 4. You can look up my name :P
---
I will now await your apology. However, I get the feeling I won't be hearing from you again.
---
That was another joke.
---
So this means Laser/Plasma weapons are going to remain shitty forever? Extremely disappointing.... I was hoping to dust off my Laser Rifle with One Wasteland.
---
I have this issue as well.  I think its connection related or bugged vats
---
I guess I was trying to say that anyone who has ever traded for the weapon/armor they want has a very high probability of owning a duped item.
---
On one hand, I do wish that duping never happened in the first place, because I'd be interested to see how different the game would have progressed. But once it became prevalent, they made it so those god roll items are available to everyone. 
---
I have an inventory slammed full with gear and aid I've been given (first MMO I've ever played, I always thought the whole "girls get everything in video games" was just a myth - it's not. Lmao) so while you bet your ass I'm using the god tier shit, I'm also giving it away to random players I encounter, especially when I see someone that's around level 50. 
---
I guess my point is that dupers have made it possible for everyone to have access to their dream weapon that would have been impossible to obtain through purveyor/drops.
---
I found the rewards for beckets quest line a little better than Sofia, I keep Sofia around though since her dialogue improves after you complete her quest
---
Is it possible to delete one ally and add another to get more daily quests? 
---
Also do the settler or raider companion quests give you faction rewards?
---
I remember when they were good and usable in 3&amp;NV. back when Deathclaws were actually terrifying
---
No I seriously love it, my mother used to play when I was a kid and as I grew up she stopped for the most part. I always told her you can't be too old to enjoy a game, but she swears she is. Now I can tell her I found someone who has over 20 years on her saying he'll be playing till 100.
---
I might also have to send her some Skyrim Grandma videos to ice the cake.
---
But seriously I think it's awesome when I come across older gamers. I hit 30 this year and sometimes I feel like I'm too old for this and get self conscious about my hobby, but you just reminded me what I'd tell my mother, you're never too old to have fun doing something you enjoy.
---
I think their should be a 10% chance Grahm arrives in full Vegas drag cosplay, drunk AF and play a fantastic epic Dragonforce level electric guitar solo, with Chally the Moo Moo running on a treadmill for the power.
---
Especially Todd Howard's camp
---
Just kidding pls no ban
---
I can kill level 25 enemies with one shot to the head but then it heals back to a single shot
---
100% chance of some game breaking bugs to occur, and probably a duplication exploit. Too much can go wrong even if it brings good features.
---
Might be just coincidence but i also had alot of framerate bugs and had to server hop due to not being able to change weapons a couple times.
---
caps, gold etc, i didnt claim it yet because i dont need them.  i have three toons so been holding them for when i need it.
---
They can appear pretty much anywhere. It's rng appart from places like Watoga where they can't spawn.
---
Try tickling it
---
Eh, I wouldn't call it poor design. It works fine and getting EXP is something most people'll be doing anyway, plus it encourages using and sharing lunchboxes and making use of the team bonuses. It just takes a decent bit longer than the other SCORE challenges (but is also worth more score usually).
---
No, please explain.
---
For everyone who was waiting in anticipation you can now put your minds at ease because I have made it home and collected my BOS banner and will be placing it at my C.A.M.P momentarily
---
Oh you‚Äôre shitting me, right? I equipped it in the Atom Shop already but I didn‚Äôt know you have to move your camp to get it to show up. That sucks, I really like where my camp is.
---
Oh ok so so Bethesda things
---
It‚Äôs random... Just do leader of the pack, free range, uranium fever, and horde events
---
i mean i guess you could do that by building a blueprint in a workshop and letting someone copy the blueprint lol.
---
problem is with all of the atom shop items. cool idea though.
---
Where was this said? That's great if true. I was worried I would be unable to power level new characters.
---
This is a Seinfeld simulator now.
---
I run dense and rank 1 fireproof and don't take any explosive damage from it anymore.
---
I would like to know as well. I have several Laser Turrets at my camp, i hope they'll do better damage now.
---
I agree. Unfortunately seems like we are in he minority here.
---
Twirling long moustache, üé∏üéºüé∂ 
---
Mwah-ha-ha!
---
There's similar issues when you first log on to the server, the first enemy you engage usually doesn't take any damage, melee does this randomly.  It probably has to do with the game requiring server confirmed damage to actually deal the damage while the client displays expected damage.  So when the game updates a split second later, if the server can't confirm the hit, for probably many reasons, it's like you did no damage at all.
---
It was during the Dutch Stream during QuakeCon - I need to find a link, but they said that "leveling" would have limits, including some areas where there wouldn't be leveling at all.
---
It doesn‚Äôt repair it all the way. Just a little every time it happens.
---
I do those as well. I know I‚Äôm not alone here, but I‚Äôm level 206 and really starting to struggle looking for shit to occupy my time in game
---
Not everyone can grind every single day. Leveling up 3 times a week is a far more reasonable challenge in contrast.
---
Also, the amount of EXP to level up will continue to increase each time, so it‚Äôs certainly not getting easier.
---
Bos was arguably the most important faction in the fight against the schorched, they made a line of defense around the cranberry bog and most of the technology against the scorched such as ultracite lasers, ultracite power armor and study made in California about how the scorched plague works and how to annihilate it. so hating Them I find it wrong, she had differences with other factions refusing to cooperate (which all factions did) but otherwise they were among the best faction in Apalacchia
---
You could do the burrows with a decent build a level 1 pipe rifle and totally butt naked...
---
Sometimes at certain events I wave and call people over, and when they take more than 30 seconds to react, I just kill it and move on and they act all butt hurt.
---
dont get that radier with the radio then, he doesnt shut up,and the things he says ..smh
---
But I mean that it happens all the time im playing . With supernatants , radars even ticks sooo idk
---
Sweetwater, yes! I'm walking up with your 10 honey, I really dont need to here you ambient dialogue, you give quest dialogue, and your "oh, your back " in 2 seconds every time I see you
---
outside, in the overworld/non-instanced intetiors, everyone can have their own private conversations with npcs.
---
in instanced interiors, only the team leader can converse with npcs. everyone else can "listen" to the conversations but has no control over responses.
---
the exception, i believe, is vendors. you gotta take turns buying stuff, just like overworld vendors.
---
Long coat is slightly less rare as scavenger traders also sell them now.
---
I do it at the whitespring, there is at least one legendary 95% of the time I've had 3 spawn at once before.
---
I have about 210 carry weight right now. I dropped strong back for some damage perks as well awhile ago. Having at least a small backpack helps too.
---
BoS isn't fascist
---
I was disappointed to find out that It's pretty much all seperate don't really go in looking for a co-op experience
---
We have Raiders though. They steal, extort, and murder daily. They're a much bigger part of the game than what we've been told the BoS will be.
---
I'm a role player too, so I understand exploring the ramifications of this addiction, but the Diehards and Free Radicals are a much bigger issue  ... especially since you're coerced into dealing with them.
---
Yeah the vault bit is a bit weird since they did originally say it would seal and shut down the air, but I guess it just...didn't? One thing I noticed when I started a new character is that they tweaked the overseers message that plays over the intercom to have an automated message at the end stating it's been played once every 24 hours. Which means real dedication on the part of anyone who just refused to leave and has now heard it hundreds of times.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs one of the 4 locations I was talking about, definitely the best locations for legendaries
---
I have a similar issue when I go to west tek.  The displayed damage is absurdly more than the health any enemy has, and most will die and explode into a million pieces, and then it's like 1/4 will miraculously survive.  It's particularly annoying when using a weapon with a slow reload and fire rate.  I'm built specifically to oneshot everything weaker than a sheepsquatch and I have a BE LMG for anything tankier... and it's just annoying having to hit something twice.
---
Hell yeah if you're around that'd be awesome, IGN: Kaesix . I tried server hopping again today and still no luck
---
I Hope You save minutmen, BoS and railroad for destroy institute
---
Idk I‚Äôm lvl 336 and I always keep my stock well and fine for all players. But maybe I‚Äôm just not the YouTube sucking, no time to have fun only exploit types I‚Äôve been seeing a lot lately.
---
Yeah content locusts have been an issue for ages.  Trick here is instead of a content drip doing shorter challenges on interval they turned it into a big time sink.
---
They all had their strengths in the fight against the scorched. The BoS might have been the front line, but it was the Responders who were making the vaccine we used, or the Free States building a detection network. The problem is all of the factions wouldn‚Äôt work together and so they effectively committed suicide. I mean, everybody is dead when 76 opened, and we found that victory was in their dying grasp. They just dropped the ball.
---
Tadpole Billy repotting in!!
---
Yeah so it's just a  "deal with it" thing?
---
No power armor.. just a full unyielding set. Running bloodied. It‚Äôs crazy op with shotguns. Average base dps for me with each of my guns is between 800 and 2000. Mutations: adrenal reaction, bird bones (more air time allows more shots on melee attackers), marsupial, herd mentality, speed demon, electrically charged, plague walker, healing factor... I think that‚Äôs all of them.
---
You don‚Äôt need a ton of points in perception as shotguns are close/medium range weapons (with the exception of the gauss). You should definitely be rocking enforcer. Only one pellet needs to make contact to cripple an enemy. Save your crafting perks, lock picking and hacking perks for your back pocket since you don‚Äôt need them all the time. With the right armor and build you don‚Äôt need a ton of defense perks like refractor or iron clad. Also aqua boy/girl is a card I only equip for certain and very rare occasions as there‚Äôs not a ton of water in the game that you‚Äôre gonna drown in. Change your stock on your guns to precise or forceful. Those stocks increase the guns durability so they don‚Äôt need to be repaired as much. Again, shotguns are really good at close/medium range so extra accuracy isn‚Äôt gonna do a lot to help in long range shots. Lastly, no suppressors. Suppressors cut your range by almost a third or more on shotguns. Maybe make an exception to that for a combat shotgun in case you need to be sneaky. But for as close as you have to get for it to be effective you may as well have a solid melee weapon.
---
And just personal preference, don‚Äôt use explosive shotguns. They‚Äôll kill you more than any enemies. Also they break super fast. My explosive combat shotgun would break after 20 shots. Mid combat, that‚Äôs no bueno.
---
This, if I‚Äôm nearby I always assist with defending. Usually get shot at because people misunderstand
---
Most of the Xbox community I've met has been getting more toxic as of late
---
Unyielding doesn‚Äôt give you the ability to slot more cards, and if you had maxed out perks you could choose how you build your character, so going over 15 wouldn‚Äôt be an issue (i.e. if you have a max +5 STR legendary perk, don‚Äôt put more than 10 into STR)
---
Are you on PC by any chance? I'll take that bloodied one off your hands
---
Noooo! You lucky son-of-a-gun!!! That's what I've been searching for. Congrats!!!
---
Until they improve the net code somehow... probably.  It is vastly better than it used to be though, so there's hope.
---
In FO3 I didn‚Äôt like the Lyons‚Äô BoS, but was somewhat fond of the Outcasts: the later we‚Äôre into their own business without bothering you unless you decided to talk/fight them.
---
In comparison, one of the dialogue lines you can tell to the scribe at the Arlington library best describes my feeling about the BoS in FO3:
---
‚Äú**** it, can‚Äôt go anywhere without running into you *******s‚Äù
---
You assume a level of knowledge of the game, builds and locations to work that not everyone has. 
---
Some people are just getting into the game and working on their builds.
---
He and Beckett
---
Yea same.  I always like to do the optional content though.
---
Maybe around 10k for the bloodied. Not sure how much you could get for a nocturnal anything, though.
---
Ok thanks though
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm sticking around. The game has some huge flaws but I still enjoy logging on and playing with the friends I would have never made without the game
---
Free Range has a 1 star SheepSquatch at the end of it that pops out of the ground once you get the cows to where they are going.
---
Inside Crater, the room where Meg is. Look for a guy called "Raider Punk"
---
Right - and my own 2cents, is they should look both ways.
---
Real Important Content - such as that linked to gold.  Lift the daily limit gating, and instead do a max gold + item drip, as you mention.  Possibly (long term) even add a gold inflation with new content.
---
On the other hand - something like the season bit - much of that content is purely cosmetic.  I think it makes sense you need to be something of a dedicated player - to earn it.
---
If memory serves it was unlimited storage that was the issue.  Anyone else that did the early weight glitches got to experience the truth to making through game unstable.
---
This is some good analysis, the current proposed method of 2 coins per card is way too slow.
---
u/ladydevann

---
If you‚Äôre on PC I have a 3* junkies I‚Äôd trade for a bloodied potentially.
---
Sorry... PS4
---
I prob would like a decent list too being I‚Äôve played since beta other then a six month break. But usual route is, whitesprings area, for Wes tek, fissure prime, Rail road crossing sign place near watoga. But sometimes I go on runs and nothing good. Other runs I see 10 in whitesprings alone.
---
I just want to know if the Vertibird PA skin is in the Armor Ace season or not, I've been holding onto the atoms for it.
---
Also  I'm with the others, more Enclave stuff please.
---
It's just a nervous tick he has.
---
*Bassackwards
---
An elevator would be nice or spiral staircase.
---
congrats man you got the joke
---
Thank you... much appreciated!
---
I usually have good luck at the caravan of military vehicles NE of the Pumpkin House. Charleston Courthouse is usually good for one.
---
Magic shotguns are to way to go doesnt matter what build u have
---
I didn't assume anything of anyone.  Also, my idea of a "decent build" is just having the damage perks for the weapon you're using.
---
Oh thank you for asking this.  It was driving me nuts.  I felt like I was in a Pink Panther movie and at any second my manservant Cato was going to jump out and attack me....
---
...yes, I'm old.
---
Yep, have to leave your PA for it to register.
---
Yeah I loved the pip boy app from Fallout 4.
---

Yes!

Make ARMOR ACE LESS OF A CHASE! Take dailes out and just add more weeklies/repeatables throughout the week. I don't want to login EVERY DAY! I also don't have all the money in the world to keep buying stuff whenever i decide i want to take a few days off!

Yea people don't do this kind of shit on any other social media! /s

This sub seems to split into 3 groups. 76 Good, 76 Bad, and 76 Casual. Posts for 76 Bad usually get tanked unless a common issue is found, then it‚Äôs hoisted to the top. 76 Good posts usually do fine but will sometimes be drowned out if it‚Äôs only really seen by people who oppose the idea. Then the 76 Casuals exist who don‚Äôt really care what happens, they just want to play and stay informed. 
---
I usually run more 76 Bad because I have a negative overall outlook towards almost everything (yes, I‚Äôm a crab, now back to Fo76). If I say almost anything negative on this sub I get blasted down. Example: I got downvoted for saying Bethesda doesn‚Äôt give good communication. I‚Äôve been downvoted for saying the game runs bad. I‚Äôve even been downvoted for saying Bethesda is capable of better things. The only time this isn‚Äôt the case is when people are overall pissed at the same issues. Like when they released Patch 14 and broke nearly every legendary in their attempt to patch 250 DRWR. Or Fallout 1st release. Or when the PC inventory hack went through.
---
With the results of the most recent patch and the lackluster events and rewards, this is one of the more lenient times where being negative is the popular opinion. There will always be negative opinions, but you‚Äôre not going to see them make it to sort by: Hot on most days
---
TL;DR: There are different views which tend to be popular at different times, dependent on the current state of the game
---
TL;DR but in joke form: Being negative every day is hard when people who aren‚Äôt negative fight against you. It‚Äôs easier when the positive people have negative days.
---
Ha!
---
Sweet thank you
---
Ok thanks that‚Äôs three locations I didn‚Äôt even know about, I really appreciate it!
---
Its a known glitch restart the game and it should go away
---
Ah it's all good. No worries mate
---
Periodic fast travel not working and having to retry several times before it works
---
Mine fixed itself after one of the patches  but you may have luck dismissing the quest (if it is your first time receiving this particular quest) fast traveling away, and returning to try to pick up the quest again.
---
Clever girl.
---
Yes, but you don't always play with your team mates, do you? At least I don't. I just go in a team  for the benefits and do my own thing.
---
Maybe its a gender thing. RPG players are definitely a male majority. I know lots of women are playing more and it is always gratifying to me to see the diversity of approaches to a game that women can bring.
---
So pretty bad then. I'd like to try some stuff out but who the heck's gonna barrel through 250 levels just to max out another single legendary perk. We've been making do without them so far.
---
10k !? Wtf
---
If you use "good with Salt" quite a while. If it's a problem consider using an alt to store food. While inactive with your alt it does not spoil. If you aren't FO1st make friends with someone who is or just have a friend wait on a server till you drop the items in a container and retiurn twith the other character. It's low value stuff so low stress. Of course if you have FO1st then just tse a private world
---
With how dark The Mire is, I wouldn't even have to find a bush to hide in. I could just crouch anywhere.
---
I knew I shouldn‚Äôt have fast traveled to the Graham store and instead just walked through Graham.
---
im speed running her quest line so i can get rid of her (yeah i know she's lovely and all but boy does she repeat herself all the time)

There's all filthy mutants anyway. Not like us, we're clean mutants.

Feel free to add me, IGN admiraldarkstar

I'm on most nights.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I wasn't planning on playing today. I'll log on for a second for this.
---
What I'd like to see with workshops is a faction-based ownership system.  Use the Public Teams interface as a basis and allow players to join one of the many factions in the game.  (Responders/Settlers, Raiders, BOS, Enclave, Free States, Cultists, Vault Dwellers).  Each faction would offer some small bonus like the Public Teams do.  The more workshops your faction holds the higher the bonus.  Factions would be neutral toward each other until a skirmish initiates a war.  Faction warfare would be limited to workshops.  Ownership of workshops would pass to other members of the faction as players log out.  It would give an incentive to actually bother with taking and building up workshops, and a reason to participate in larger-scale PVP battles when defending against other factions or trying to take their workshops.
---
Yes the principal problem was the lack of cooperation and the Raider, the responder create the vaccine but the BoS hold the line protecting a large part of Apalacchia and the tracker system of the Free states i think it don't work so everyone try to do his part. (except Raider and they are the best faction for fight the scorched people and avoid crossing the Savage divide). For the Raider of crater they are trying to fight schorchbeast and they are neutral, don't searching the war to foundation for example
---
Seems to boil down to the content added cannot be completed by folks that play a handful of hours a week.  Annoying to see challenges that can't be completed, almost like being punished for having responsibilities outside a game.
---
r/nobodyasked r/whogivesashit r/nobodycares r/whogivesaflyingfuck
---
I was thinking a bit prematurely when I said devs cus I'm sure your right but we get angry at them cus they're the one who make the game but their superiors probably tell them what to add/make. I should've said Bethesda, my mistake
---
I love your idea and detailed review but I'd love to add my own 2 caps if I may.
---
Award perk points per level past 50/100. Two reasons. This wouldn't punish anyone for swapping their builds and also give them a reason to keep any "non-essential" or "off-build" cards.
---
I feel like scrapping perk cards is still a good idea. Some perks are just worthless or you get duplicates from a pack but keep the rate low. 1-2.
---
That way, no one is rewarded for stripping their character down to "bare bones" but also helps them get to their legendary a little bit sooner.
---
I actually liked the brotherhood in FO1, but in NV they were godawful and I genuinely disliked them as a faction from that point on.
---
I'll buy the bloodied one for 10k if it's still available.
---
Totally agree! By now, I usually avoid Uranium Fever and One Violent Night if there's more than two other people being LVL 200-300+ because I've had my fair share of egoists in the past. It's just no fun to try and beat the event just to get robbed by other players afk'ing most of the time until a legendary appears and gets one shotted by their twoshot-explodingbullets-bloodied-whatever build. At least have the decency and switch to some weaker weapons and tickle the enemy so everyone has a chance of great rewards. :/
---
Problem would be solved a lot easier if everyone who enters the event and at least collected some xp by killing enemies could loot legendaries, whether they tickled them or not.
---
Which...defeats the purpose of a team? But sure, okay. They should totally implement a way to save caps when you join a team, that is only effective as a bonus for when you DON'T actually play with your team. Yeah, this is big brain time.
---
I want that as a notification sound all the time now.
---
If you block her path to the chair she will play way lesser guitars(I put her chair on the top of two campfires, surrounding with the atom shop nuclear plant barrel btw), she will sometime teleport to outside to use the workbenches, but most of her time she will just stand there and idle, I'm guessing that's when she's missing her guitar(aka. pathfinding not found)
---
And way lesser I meant just like how she's using the workbenches, she will sometime respawn back to the chair and play it one time, then I assuming she's starts to miss the workbenches then
---
Well, since I just finished the commander ally quests, I now have her dresses in Arktos labcoat with a tin foil hat and the prisoner collar/Eye of Ra thing, and her game console is at the top of my base, which well placed in the edge, so she her dream will come true since the very same spawn logic above mentioned, she will take fall damage, lay down and yell for help for a second btw, I now aimed it to the foundation of my vending machine so it's more vivid for a bit for my lonely machine
---
They can be bought in the bunker
---
If you think you‚Äôll want to play your sneak build again, I would suggest making a new character. For your .50 cal, you can drop it to a friend you trust, then switch characters and get it back from him. Even if you can‚Äôt use it right away, you have something to work towards.
---
I would go for a new character. If your on xbox I could take the weapon from your main and give it to you second build
---
Last CTD, I fast traveled very far after fast traveling to the store(because low on caps). Noticed a Sheep fighting Mutants, and as I switched a preferred weapon in the quick menu....CTD.
---
Guess the game couldn‚Äôt handle the order of events
---
Oh ok
---
&gt;the graphics are just too outdated for me to get used to
---
Eh, Dragbody's, FCO and a texture pack solved that problem for me.
---
Too bad they can't replace it with the Jaws theme.
---
Thank you! I was kind of thinking it needed to go that way. Just sucks that we don‚Äôt have shared inventory, plans, recipes, etc.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea on the drop. I‚Äôve never done it but can try that.
---
My typical route:
---
* White Springs
---
* West Tek
---
* Fort Defiance (ghoul side)
---
* Burrows
---
I put the blood splattered moleman mascot oufit on him, we are in in a nice little barn next to the crater with a farm outback. He sells alcohol and chems to the raiders that pass by pretending he's above it all, but in the end he enables all their bad habits.
---
In the end he got the perfect bar he wanted.
---
How much? I want to taste this rare delicacy. Name your price sir. üßê
---
Thanks! I am PC but that is a good idea to swap.
---
Can I just send photos of both sides?
---
I like the spot with steel + copper in the forest, near the junkyard. I get a lot of player traffic in that area and it‚Äôs nice because there‚Äôs resource nodes. It helps that the forest is easy access for new or low level players and there are usually other camps in the region so it incentivizes people to hit up multiple camps rather than having a single camp out in the mire or other remote corner of the map. Just my experience though! People will probably visit any camp that is selling enough items.
---
Whats all this? did I miss something?
---
what the fuck are you talking about? people dont trade for caps because of the caps cap and lack of cap sinks. not because of exploits lmao.
---
people barter, they dont trade top tier gear for caps. thats just the way it is. maybe you dont understand that.
---
I would like Charleston with Summerville Lake included. Centering on the lake, making it the Coliseum of the Wasteland gladiators
---
Sorry I couldn't help that much
---
It‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs shitty crack we‚Äôre all addicted to üòÇ
---
He's knows. He knows what you've done. He is just using you as a mercenary.
---
More like TOO MUCH immersion. You can lie to us...but you can't lie to THE WARD.
---
I forgot to add. Unless I missed it you also didn't account for secondary or support perks. Like if you wanted to swap to melee while you farmed or if you wanted to swap in the ammo perk while crafting. Just like we do now with regular perks, making the grind that much worse.
---
If you wanted to do anything like that you're going to easily hit 1k+ and anything past that takes 10 times as long!
---
Burrows &gt; burrows &gt; burrows &gt; Burrows &gt; burrows &gt; Burrows &gt; Burrows is the best I'm afraid.
---
Mistakes were made
---
Plenty of people are (rightfully) complaining about the bugs and shite of this game so im not really sure what you're on about
---
I‚Äôve leveled up every day easily and I‚Äôm currently 260ish. If you can get Line in the sand to trigger you should be all set. I‚Äôve leveled up twice at times doing that one.
---
I use an instigating pump action and an instigating combat and don‚Äôt get the rubber banding
---
Yes once you reach level 50, every level you have a choice to pick a new perk or reassign a special point.
---
beth: if you like reloading, have i got a gun for you! (10 minutes of loading follows)
---
Seen it in nuclear winter all the time. Didn‚Äôt even know it was a thing outside of there. 
---
Then again, my main is melee.
---
Yup I use a instigating pump and I get the rubber band effect but not alot.  Usually when I'm fighting for my life from a swarm of some irradiated wasteland monstrosity is when it happens....RIP
---
I know why Ward does it. There are bottles of empty booze on the shelf in his trailer.
---
So maybe it's my internet connection?
---
Gotta love tap it my friend. Be gentle to the X!
---
Yes so annoying
---
your reward: a nocturnal drill
---
Good info I haven‚Äôt gone the aside the quest that was there
---
I have my crops open to monster attack, however it looks pretty sweet and makes my barn house build complete. So i just put on green thumb and just repair whatever i need to. I don't even harvest my plants everyday. so it's really not a big deal. Just build some fert. bombs if i need a bunch of stuff.
---
Can‚Äôt say for sure but I would guess so. Have you tested your connection speeds? Are you hardwired? Or using Wi-Fi through your console/PC
---
I wish explosive weapons were a hair better. Specifically the Fat Man. Got a pistol/explosive build running it, and I dream of killing SBs in less than 4 nukes.
---
My gauss shotgun can't decide whether to do 10 or 500 damage
---
Switch to eso I did never been happier
---
They are in FO4...
---
It's pretty decent but it's not wired so &lt;\(-_-)/&gt;
---
itll be nice to get random groups to run these now that we have the squad system
---
I'm still on a loading screen.  I couldn't leave if I wanted to!  üòÜ
---
You do have a point. The game runs bad enough as is
---
Over near Vault 76 that area?
---
Assets already in game, they just wasting everyone's time. Be impressed if they added new maps outside of apalachia...of course that might not fit with the lore. But it will still be fun.
---
No, I don't really know how to do that, but won't I risk getting kicked out by the game? ( the reason I haven't tried it yet).
---
Yes!! As a Bucs man, I've always stayed to the end. Someone needs to be catching the merch in the empty stands lol (literally.... The 4th quarter shirt grabs is a toss up between me and me catching them).
---
No there is X take and HOLD X Too equipI dont wabt to see that
---
Don't forget your mittens my little munchkin, no wait.... that wasn't right...
---
You forgot the Forest Camo Jumpsuit, the Tattered Field Jacket, the Traveling / Leather Coats in the extremely rare category.
---
I wish they make sound effects like jinjos in Banjo Kazooie. https://youtu.be/B14NT1V3tSk
---
Yea no worries, just it must be hard for the people working day to day, it‚Äôs like blaming a chef for bad food when the restaurant gives them dog shit to cook with
---
Is there a fix for this yet? I tried analyzing first and it didn't work. This is very frustrating
---
I sell all plans I have at 1 cap, sell only plasma cores and apparel otherwise. Meds rarely sell unless they are the serums (in my experience anyway).
---
Only place I normally frequent is the whitesprings train station mainly because everyone else does.
---
I‚Äôll check a lot of player vendors, but unless it‚Äôs a god tier roll from a weapon I don‚Äôt really care... maybe 5.56
---
Yes but the fascism Is another thing, they hate ghoul yes but they don't set lager for Them and they don't do a massive propaganda or similiar
---
Well I‚Äôm not wired either. I hope you can figure out a fix to your problem, I love shotguns personally. 370+ levels with nothing but
---
Isn't it a great thing that you can a play this game like YOU want? :)
---
I just wait for the events which doubles over my grind for the level. The 3 wolves leader of the pack, one violent night wendigo, project paradise sheepsquatch, uranium fever, radiation rumble, prime nuke or encryptid if you‚Äôre lucky at the time.
---
i watched some of your vids. You get trolled for being a condescending judgmental cunt. not because of toxic positivty lmao.
---
This post is so bipolar lmao.
---
Did he do it from the same silo, if so you will need to use a different silo. There is a holotape available which tells you which silos are available, I forget if you only get the holotype after your first nuke.
---
first, get a nuclear keycard. you can use one of the terminals at the enclave bunker to locate one. be aware you'll have to shoot down a drone likely guarded by vertibots. next, go to any of the nuke silos (there are three, you can look uo where they are). once your reach the end of the silo, you will use the keycard and will have to enter a code (just use nukacrypt dot com, and make sure to use the correct code for the silo you're in). then select a location to nuke.
---
this is assuming you dont wanna deal with the actual decryption of nuke codes. if you do, someone can e plain that part better than me.
---
I'm 105 and I don't know how ppl have the patience to get to that kind of level or more
---
Me too. My fo1st subscription is staying aswell.
---
I'm not leaving, I just need a break. Getting on every day to grind SCORE is just wearing me out, already stressed out from working the front lines...
---
Once I hit 100, I'm taking a break until season 2 arrives
---
100% .. just completed vault 79 on my 5th character a few hours ago.. really dreading the Ward Grind for the next 6 weeks
---
Just go to a silo as soon as you inside a quest will start that explains everything
---
Had the same issue, no idea how to fix it I'm afraid.
---
That would be ideal to be onest, every 50 levels get another perk card, either choose the same one you already have to rank it up, or choose a different one
---
Tunnel snakes rule! It's so obvious I didn't think I needed to put down the tunnel snakes. But didn't include robot faction for previously stated reasons
---
Yes same.
---
You can do it before 50
---
edit: to be clear, OP is asking if they can continue to choose STR perks after they max out STR.  Normally the system defaults to choosing a perk from the stat you just leveled up so it‚Äôs not necessarily clear you can toggle back to STR perks once you have maxed out STR
---
I think you might be letting selection bias color your perception. Reddit on the whole isn't particularly varied when it comes to this sort of thing, Brotherhood discussion usually only goes one way (with a lot of downvoted into invisible opinions at the bottom of the page if you dissent), and people not wanting to give their hard scavenged resources for a crappy nerfed Christmas present and some cosmetics aren't going to give a good read of the general popularity of the faction.
---
And I say that as an OoM fan in 76 who got bored of the Brotherhood around about New Vegas. I find them bland. I'm still well aware they are the iconic and popular cover faction for the franchise, though.
---
What you didn‚Äôt do is use the search here for an answer in the 50+ other posts!
---
Just type Ounce into the search bar
---
Sure, you can look at that way. And with that same mindset, once you reach a certain level  (50+), you're currently restricted in how you play based on more than half of the map being utterly pointless for you to visit. Besides the daily quests at Crater, why would you ever visit the Toxic Valley? If the Purveyor and Encryptid wasn't in the Ash Heap I would never return there after the Firebreather's quest. What's the point bullying level 20 mobs that will just drop scrip trash? And more than half of the Savage Divide is pointless unless someone higher level already passed through and mobs have spawned to their level. So I guess you're just screwed with your mindset, but you'll likely spend a lot more play time a higher level than a low level. Unless you just like deleting and rerolling characters for giggles. I mean, you do you if that's your thing. 
---
TL;DR
---
Leveling is ridiculously easy sub 50 and I like the idea of the whole map being useful at levels 50+ instead of just doing a few parts of the Divide, the Mire, and the Bog over and over.
---
I'm a new player and so far I'm loving the game. It gets a LOT of well deserved hate but at it's core? It's a pretty solid game that I enjoy.
---
I really wish they would fix the camp system, though.
---
Is it better than having the standard scavenger bot?
---
Subject leveling
---
Coronavirus lockdown has definitely helped the ability to grind most of the day. LOL
---
Thanks for the update!  Will be a great addition to my raider themed camp.
---
BoSuCkS
---
For plastic i farm laser rifles from super mutants, i get 10 plastic each and i don't need to server jump
---
Would'nt that be trying to build a house that you'll rebuild in fallout 4, years from now? Hehe
---
Lol you expect others to care, too
---
Yes you can, after you select what stat you want to put a special in, you can toggle back and forth (L1/R1 on PS4) and select a perk from a different stat.  You are never forced to choose a perk from the stat you are leveling up.  It‚Äôs just not obvious when you start playing
---
If you have people you can trust, you can ask them to help you with moving stuff to your new character. Maybe even pre-craft a few weapons/armor to make life a little easier (like deep pocket set of armor and an upgraded gun/melee)
---
Not on atm, so I can't help.
---
Are you asking about expeditions that is in the works?
---
The vending machines. The raider vending machines are out today
---
You can level up a different special and not have to get a perk card from the stat. On PS4 the buttons are r1 and l1 to choose a different stat for the cards. Idk what it‚Äôs like on other systems.
---
I never said I would leave but I don't entirely enjoy the game either. Don't get me wrong, I love the fun that can be had and I'll definitely play it again, so there's nothing wrong with recognizing the faults in the game and sometimes I'll come across some of the best moments in the game.
---
With me I mostly lack of time to play it cuz school, work etc
---
I more casual like 5-6 hours a day
---
You know what we need? Pet powered treadmill generators. Whatever you tamed runs on it.
---
Yes, first I've heard...
---
This game isn't really meant for role-playing. You're not really able to be a raider.
---
The curious thing is that it appears to be a visual glitch only specific to being in PA. But if you look at the legendary run game board, the progress is tracking. I actually ranked up in PA, but the game gave no on screen indicator. But the game board showed a new reward to claim. Claim the reward, back to game, jump out of PA, and the progress animation plays and shows me the rank up.
---
Wouldn't that make it easier? The tough enemies stay the same, and the easier enemies because tougher, and give more XP.
---
Understandable, real life duties should always come before digital ones. LOL
---
Haha my bad.  Learn to read much right?

---
The only issue is they risk stepping on the toes of the player. We all but take control of the bunker and become the last/sole Mistress, learning from their mistakes and misteps.   
---
Unless they approached it from the angle of rebuilding the Order as the Mistress (which wouldn't really work too well for male characters, though some would be okay with it) then there would be some character we never met taking over, issuing orders and quests, and it could be messy.
---
oooh i miss those good old days exploring way too far and way to soon. Think i sneaked halfway through the map at one point
---
Yeah
---
Atlas will be the hottest spot for a while due to the brotherhood. Foundation is also a good one since people go there to turn in their treasury notes.
---
Haha,yeah. I've picked them up for my raider style build. It really gives it personality
---
Save the scrip for the possible scrip sale as well if you have storage available or you want get tonnes of legendary modules.
---
I may change up the Fashnacht banner for BOS banner when fulfilling the decoration requirement of the Build Up Your CAMP challenges.
---
Leather coats got duped a lot, they may not be on the market though since that was an old duping. Though I can agree with the camo and tattered.
---
i get it!!!!! grew up in the Tampa area, bucs were he only option haha.
---
What do you mean skeleton? You were supposed to feed him!
---
Even at rank III it still only repairs for a bit, in most weapons it actually just delay the breaks, actually kind meh unless you just want some better QoL

You can check this post btw:

Fuck the Brotherhood... of steel.
---
I'm going camping rn but I'm definitely interested
---
Why not make it 10 coins and then you don't have to no life this shit. Games aren't meant to be played every single day. Ffs. Its a barely working game as is and I'm expect to be over level 300 to max out my character?
---
Yeah I'm thinking of buying that year subscription to 1st now that it seems stable. I feel sorry for the guys who never got any atom objects for months though
---
It makes sense, and the other two are leaning on the bus and the console because they are too drunk to walk.
---
More like a colossal problem with them event
---
Yeah I think so! It‚Äôs on a cliff, you can find it with the resource map. Realistically though, most camps near the vault will get traffic.
---
I‚Äôd be happy if they just added a quest that was repeatable unlimited times per day for each faction so i can just grind as much as I want that day
---
Think this is already happening with the BOS event....think its slated for next weekend if im not mistaken.

Agreed. Eliminates all sense of progress. Bethesda needs to get rid of its addiction to level scaling, not just in Fo76 but everywhere.
---
I did not think of this. Great question! I hope we can get an update on that before release.
---
For some strange reason, I now feel compelled to find that owlet and learn the recipe, even though my character is an herbivore and it‚Äôs completely unnecessary.
---
I never buy anything from player vendors.  What could you possibly have that I'd want?
---
They are working on a way you can travel outside the map to other places in the fallout franchise. It is something they posted in a Q&amp;A the dev team had. It is also listed on the website. Probably won't be til this winter though.
---
I thought the infiltrator card started with lvl 1 locks and terminals @ Lvl 1, Lvl2 at Lv2, Lvl 3 @ Lvl 3 and Lvl 4 terminals and locks at Lvl 4. Did they change it?
---
You can get more cards, but the number of perks you have actually slotted is limited by the stat. If you have 15 Str, for instance, you can only have 15 Strength perks slotted. You can get more perk cards to sub those out, but you can‚Äôt slot more than the 15.
---
3 thoughts.
---
1.  Why do you assume the perk needs to be maxed out?  Based on some of what I read - I assumed they weren't meant to be immediately maxed out.  Or - maybe 1 is maxxed out, a couple others not.
---
2.  What about other ways of getting perk packs?  Looking at the season board - I see 13 perk packs - or 52 cards.  That in itself is the equivalent of almost "29 levels" - using your thoughts above.
---
3.  Today - there is 0 reason to give us additional ways to add more perk cards.  How do you know they won't add more in ?  
---
Again - this goes back to number 1.  The assumption that people can max this out in 3 months.  I just don't think that's the case.
---
To be clear - I don't think the system is perfect by any means.  What I'd love to see them start with - is implement a new way to change special skill points - separating that from this.  And then add a way to refund those folks who spent the points already.
---
It‚Äôs a bug related to one shot levels of damage, the same thing happens occasionally with my gauss rifle
---
In ESO they essentially just attempted to scale all characters to max level. Didn't work great IMO because it was pretty easy to get low level characters that were MORE powerful than high level characters (especially if that player had high level characters already). 
---
I'm sure it's not what they are doing but it seems to me the simplest way to "scale" would be to not scale at all. Combat rifle just does XX damage. Gatling gun does XX damage. And creatures would just have Xhp based on their enemy type and designation. 
---
Instead of have guns that level and super mutants that levels... just have gun types and different types of supermutants (warlord stronger than skirmisher and so on). 
---
IMO this is the most logical way to do it, especially since player HP is relativity static. It also keeps high level characters more powerful than LL characters... of course it doesn't achieve the "goal" of naked level 1 character being able to adventure beside a level 200 in power armor.
---
I tend to go with 76 casual i never paid to to much attention to the bad things about the game.
---
Someone recently broke down the history of Charleston and how David nuking the dam wiped out the Responders which lead to the other factions falling.
---
I already hated David and Rose/Rosalynn so much. But they really did ruin everything.
---
you said that if people have trash in their vendors that they must have cheated levels if they are over 600.
---
the reason they have trash in the machine is because they dont trade for caps. has nothing to do with cheating levels.
---
why are u still playing this scam of a game that is still this bugged years later
---
Share some pics when your done I need some ideas on a bos camp üòÄ
---
I think this happened to me and is a common bug.  I think you need to just go up to the top floor in the left side office and you should be able to print/create what you need in Pennys? computer
---
The last I read was it gave you +3 to both, but each rank increased what could be auto unlocked
---
I am strictly talking about their legitimate drop rates.
---
I actually saw them and they looked pretty cool, but I had just spent a bunch on other stuff..
---
People are still throwing a massive fit.
---
Are you *honestly* surprised?
---
Ward has something in common with the children in Skyrim, you want to kill them but you cant.
---
&gt; People are excited about many of the re-designed legendary perks (I‚Äôm super excited about the +3 lockpicking/+3 hacking just at rank 1). These add a lot of power To characters, especially ones that add a +5 to all status with perk points. With 6, maxed, it would be like wearing a permanent (but better) piece of unyielding gear.
---
Which is why I'm thinking - even having 4 of them, at an average level of 2.5 - gives you 10 extra special points / perks.  That's huge - especially from a QOL (quality of life) stand point.
---
Me and my girlfriend had this problem, but we jumped into a private world and BAM. The quest was fixed. Its something to do with the servers.
---
I ran into a trap base once, didn‚Äôt pay attention completely and just ran straight to the vending machine and the spikes started shooting out of the wall so I panicked and jumped and somehow landed on the vending machine and lived. Owner runs over expecting loot to see home still alive we stared at one another for a few seconds before I left.
---
Well kiss running that event goodbye.  Now it will be swamped by people one shotting the legendary.
---
Yeah happens to me also.  I'm a shotguner and use instigating pump.  In vats it happens from time to time.  I just kinda deal with it üòµüòµ
---
This is still an issue I'm running into but I should say that I attempted the frame rate limit fix with Nvidia control panel but it's still happening. I am on the game pass version also.
---
That's double dailies on score, I mean double XP. Fairly common in these kinda games to have double XP around the end of a season in case people need to catch up.
---
I'd like to see something similar to what you said, except flip the cap and have the daily totals rollover.  Something similar to how rested experience in the old MMO's accrued over a number of days.  Daily players would still hit the anti locust cap and occasional players could get burst for a few hours once or twice a week.
---
In the SCORE, personally it just bugged me because I consider camp items game play due to camp building.  Character and gun cosmetics I'm in agreement, and that mechanic works quite well in FtP.
---
That's not a 'shotgun' issue, that is a firing your gun at the "feral ghoul Hulk"! Shotting him with guns only makes him stronger!
---
Yeah, I don't like waiting around, and I do my best to avoid others. When people are around I do what I can, that's all I can manage
---
Yeah, sure is, but why would the dev team build a feature that is ONLY effective for people who join teams, just to ignore the team? The reason they made public teams a thing was to get MORE people to play together, not less. You can totally play alone, and arguably, you are more survivable with Lone Wanderer than other charisma perks for team play. So if you want to play alone, slap on Lone Wanderer and play alone! Nobody is stopping you! But it seems really counterintuitive for a feature to be implemented as a team bonus that is ONLY good for those who DON'T play together in said teams they join. The whole point of these bonuses public teams have is to encourage people playing *together*, not to encourage them to stay separated the whole time. 
---
Now, if it were a cost reduction for just the team leader (because somebody has to go there first before the rest can fast travel behind them), THEN I might understand this reasoning, but only for whoever the leader is, because it makes roleplaying sense that the team leader goes in front and the rest follow behind the leader, who is the one who is traveling first to events so that the rest can trail behind them for free. Now THAT is an argument I could see potentially working. But giving that to everybody in the team, what you are arguing, would just discourage team play within a team. It defeats the purpose of being in a team if nobody actually plays together.

I shall. I'm really not sure how well it's going to turn out, tbh. Usually I build just small C.A.M.P.S that are more natural and immersive. Kinda sad I could clip the tall metal perimeter wall things to those large metal stair structures, had to improvise.

Pa needs carry weight improvements first and foremost. It makes no sense to suddenly lose 200 pounds of carrying capacity by hopping into a mechanized battle suit with hydraulic limb augmentation.

---
I will say, of the players I have actually had mic chat with while playing Fo76 on xb1, there has been a seriously large number of female players I've run into. I don't know if there is that much larger an influx, if the player base is more welcoming and they feel less afraid to make themselves known, or if it's just the game itself that draws the ladies to it, but yeah it has been really cool playing with the girls. I really was surprised.
---
But I will say, the way my mothers mentality always was while I was growing up, I really doubt it was a gender type of complex. She was a self admitted tomboy. Outdoors, sports, getting covered in dirt, working on broken stuff, she didn't care, she just took it in stride. Lol
---
Nearly every icon on the map has a chance to spawn a legendary.
---
Focus on the locations that have ghouls and super mutants. Those enemy types most frequently spawn as legendary.
---
I ran into this recently (spent many hrs and a lot of reading) Find that computer and it will have you go on a scavenger hunt for password clues in the same building.  Once you get them it‚Äôll progress you through the same terminal bc I think there is a passcode to print the keycard
---
Oooooh ok then
---
your right it's +3 to both with the auto unlock happening the way I said. I hadn't read about the modifier.
---
Except now events like LoP that went unvisited by high levels are now going to get swarmed by people 1 shotting the legendaries.   There will be almost no event for new toons
---
that may just be the way people talk to each other on the internet.  uh i mean, ALL people ALL time, EVERYONE, Everywhere at ALL times the MOST!! and then like, uwu face
---
**America Hated That**
---
You assume they know how to make a decent build and that the burrows is where to go. For low level players it‚Äôs about learning and building up their levels to get to that point. 
---
Also I‚Äôd love to see someone run the burrows with a level 1 pipe rifle, no armour and just their perks. I honestly can‚Äôt imagine what that would look like.
---
one other thing of note is long ago perk card pack used to give out duplicates of 1 star cards, effectively giving you nothing when you opened the packs giving you even less points
---
I'll echo what other's have said; centralized is nice to ease travel costs, if you are crafting anything in particular in quantity, then the proper resource node is a good place to start. I recently moved from my first base near Helvetia to the mountains near Cliffwatch. I had an iron node, but was always running out of lead. So I looked up nice lead deposits, traveled to most of them and finally picked one. Now, I am running out of steel! Go figure. There is a nice spot up in the toxic valley, NE of the hunting lodge that has two resource nodes, junk and lead. That was my second favorite. Plentiful supply of radstags too! There's a cave place with lead that looked neat, but was right next to a fissure site.
---
Some of us sell top tier gear for caps because, well, you should never trust a random person on the internet.
---
Bonus points if you can get a ghoul head mount onto the skull head
---
I know this is a lesser opinion. but I liked the lower level legendary events since they dropped lower level legendaries that I could put in my shop for low levels. The loot scaling will make it so that I can't do that anymore.
---
Xbox fix for me. 
---
Go to menu and re enter the game
---
Hurry to the medical center and get to the room quickly. 
---
Read everything on the terminal DONT analyze yet
---
Replace t fuse
---
Analyze
---
This worked for me. Hope it helps :)
---
If they implement a damage cap, people will lose their goddam minds.  I know this is BGS, but even they can‚Äôt be that out of touch with their game.
---
im tryna figure it out lol
---
im rank 36 on score (only started 10 days ago , running xp buffs)
---
i do all the dailies and weeklies every day , my own personal guess is ill reach the high 70s in tiers before the end.
---
I agree that's a stronger/better implementation.  But I think it would vastly increase the difficutly (and liklihood of bugs).
---
The easy thing (I think) about going to weekly - is they already have a weekly reset on the weekly quests.  Just tie in the reset with that - and you are all set.  
---
&gt; In the SCORE, personally it just bugged me because I consider camp items game play due to camp building. Character and gun cosmetics I'm in agreement, and that mechanic works quite well in FtP.
---
So maybe the answer is - new items added in a season (I'm assuming you mean like say - the chicken coop?) - end up in the atomic shop after the season, in a less cool skin?  
---
I'd be truly surprised if they made anything that wasn't cosmetic only - out of reach forever.
---
I worry One Wasteland is going to turn 76 into Destiny. I never fee powerful in Destiny no matter my level because everything scales to me. Better rewards are nice, but I want to be able to go into certain start zones and feel like a God. Also, I like games like this when I first play and realize I need to become stronger to go into certain areas, it gives me an incentive to level up and get stronger so I can go into that zone. I really don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôre leveling everything out.
---
You need the secondary passcode which comes from one of the three notes that are supposed to spawn. The notes are nowhere to be found. They didn't spawn and I even looked up a video of their locations just to be sure.
---
Much less. They are a skin for the small generators, with no noise or smoke. 3power per. Same cost and budget as small gen.
---
Will mysterious stranger also scales though? In max ranks of the perk and maxed luck he still only level 10(I'm like 160), and also act like low leveled mobs that's constantly just stand there
---
I was doing it earlier today on a low level character, no one else turned up.. I found out that if you don‚Äôt (can‚Äôt) kill the night stalker ghouls keep spawning and some are legendary.
---
So think of all the XP and legendaries he missed by one shotting:)
---
One shotting things in VATS isn‚Äôt a consideration. I can do that with my shotgun too. It‚Äôs when I use it outside of VATS that rubber-banding kicks in.
---
I‚Äôve always gotten addicted by popping another right after the affects go away.
---
Yeah, i don‚Äôt mind doing the mini game to unlock or hack, having a legendary perk that just passively gives me both is amazing, I don‚Äôt even care about leveling it up for auto unlock
---
I'll come by!
---
Its supposed to be the wind
---
I get 200 -300 in my vendor in less than a week.
---
And even worse, they are eliminating the reason to grind. All character progression, perk cards, better weaponry made completely irrelevant through normalization. Before we‚Äôd have to upgrade to kill those level 50+ mobs. Now we can roll them over with a pipe pistol as they calibrate downward to our level.
---
They should fire the PMs and devs that keep doing this shit to their RPGs.

---
Oh so there not worth to much
---
Please just scrap perk scrapping. It was a bad system to begin with (even with 5x the points), and even with this buff it still requires way too much of you. Even as a level 427 player with 1,600 hours I don't want to have to scrap ***ANY*** of my hard earned perks, let alone practically all of them.

---
Thank you! Currently a work in progress so suggestions / criticisms are welcome
---
It bugs the crap outta me!
---
I only just started playing about a month ago but the main thing you should do is run through the wastelanders story.
---
That unlocked both factions and a new end game currency.
---
Make sure to do both sides, all the way up to the point that you have to chose a side.
---
Edit: The ammo converter is a prize from the legendary run. It's not very good at the moment but just barely better than nothing at all.
---
Farming score is a good thing to do if you care about any of the prizes.
---
It worked! Thanks for the help. I did that before but must've missed an entry or went too fast the first time.
---
*This is a Junkie build.

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ed45578&amp;d=pp2cu0a00lu2lt2l71sg2s01eh2pg2ph2pi2sd2so2sp2e60ce0c62i12a72p00ar1ao0&amp;w=pc2as2
---
This isn't 100% my build, but its close to my ideal build. I don't want to use any level ups right now to change ability scores until I see how the legendary perk system ends up.
---
This is a shotgun/commando build which gets you about 100% damage with both weapon types. However shotguns aren't that good right now unless you get a close to perfect shotgun or a "magic" shotgun. The "magic" part is explained later. 
---
Strength: 
---
Blocker is awesome and everyone should have it. Bandolier lost some of its value with the ammo converter, but I still like it.
---
Perception: Commando has really high dps and you can do a bit of sniping and diversify your ammo spending if necessary. 1 Concentrated fire so you can choose limbs in VATS.
---
Endurance: Good doggy is entirely optional, I like it. Dog food is everywhere if you look. Fireproof is mandatory if you use explosive weapons or like to blow up cars.
---
Charisma: After the last patch I'm always in a team so Strange in numbers and Inspirational is always on. Tenderizer gives 5% damage first point, but it gives a a lot less bonus after the first point.
---
Intelligence: Intelligence gives xp bonus, but the cards are so boring. You'll need at least 5 for the best crafting. 6 If you want to repair power armor with max bonuses. First Aid is a good card here.
---
Agility: Adrenaline is same as Tenderizer, big bonus first point and then it's not worth it anymore. A lot of good agility cards. Personally I really like action boy. 
---
Luck: Class freak+Starched genes= Mutations lasts forever and the downsides to mutations are reduced. Also bloody mess gives a nice damage bonus to everything.
---
Things to note: I don't have any repair perks (white knight, luck of the draw etc) as I have a ton of repair kits from the SBQ.
---
I don't have any crafting perks (Scrapper/ammosmith etc) as I use a second perk loadout for that. PC has perk loadouts via mods, but it's on the roadmap so it should come to consoles later. This also applies to the lockpicker and hacker perks
---
The reason why I don't have Skeet Shooter/enforcer is that I have one of the "magic" shotguns with bugged damage in VATS so I only ever use VATS with shotguns and 1 shot is generally enough. Perhaps sacrifice bandolier/good doggy and sneak/escape artist if you want the perks.
---
Magic weapons explained here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHu4CErJXU4&amp;t=6s
---
Recommend Angry Turtle's videos, he explains a lot of the mechanics in a good way.
---
The reason I don't have any DR/ER perks is that somewhere above 300 you get reduced benefit from more DR/ER and the endgame armor will get you over that limit without any perks helping.
---
Hope this helps. Did a ton of editing/tiny modifications, so if something is incoherent that is probably why :)
---
Make sure your perks don't prevent you from getting addicted.  I usually have luck doing the open close method but only taking the chem i want to get addicted to, with buffout you might need 15. Also keep in mind it will only tell you youre addicted in the pip boy if youre not under the influence of the drug.
---
The one wasteland scaling removes a lot of the feeling of being more powerful as you level up, and certain areas being significantly more dangerous. No one liked it when it was added to Oblivion why add it again.
---
Add Tomste21
---
Also maybe if they didnt say something every freaking second
---
The smaller area would make for way more action and fun. No bushes to hide in.
---
Yup, thats the one.
---
If you‚Äôve ever checked out other camps there, I‚Äôm the one with the meat week flag, nuka-cola bottle, and grognak throne on the roof.
---
That was funny as hell. Have an upvote!
---
What do you use the vault steel for?
---
Sounds better then. One reason I've stayed away from the small generators is because of the way they look and the smoke. These seem really nice.
---
Ok
---
Yeah I get you with the destiny reference, didn't like the system with ESO either which this seems like it's taking the idea from. Thing is, enemies will still have a maximum level. I still feel powerful when I'm in places like the bog and fighting max level tougher enemies. On the flip side it could be good to reinvigorate some events that never have people playing then.
---
Because overall i like it, just trying to figure out whats going on with the glitch. Its a great game, stop being a baby
---
I would like to remind everyone That the brown dress uniform, scout armor and Non standard power armor variants such are all from a restricted section of vault 79 that you simply lack the required clearance for. Besides we use the secret service armor now as  it's technically ours now so you can ignore the scout armor anyways.
---
 I MEAN-- There's No shadowy Government agency hiding among you. Especially not under the Whitespings you're just paranoid. go away.
---
Unless you're free states in which case please make your self visible by standing still out in the open preferably standing still with your hands in the air whilst wearing those helmets with the east to aim for star on the foreheads. We will be with you traitorous dogs shortly. The same applies to the BOS actually please leave your power armor lights on or something.
---
Bethesda, you ignorant slut.
---
Thanks. Since there's no exact number out there, I'm going to leave a piece of meat in my stash and check on it often so if anyone else looks they can find the info.
---
Also apparently I added you as a friend? No clue haha.
---
Are you the person with the Queen arena?
---
Ahhh...i getcha
---
Vault 94 armour. Solar (heals you) and thorn (adds bleed and sneak).
---
Crap, i was hoping for a fix of some sort. Maybe the way my gun is modded or something
---
While we don‚Äôt get to change our legendary perks to an equally higher lvl one easily, I think the point of them was you could choose whether to go all in on a build or choose the special boosters and have that to change your builds. 
---
Already have it planned out so I can go rifle or melee without taking such a hit in damage by switching
---
Join my world plz
---
Lol i wish
---
I'm still pushed into doing it through fomo. I can resist it to an extent and I tried but it's literally the only content they released so I participated. It then turned the game into a chore and I'm out.
---
It's fine if you enjoy it but once a game has been turned too much into a treadmill there is no going back to the carefree fun times. I can pretend I guess but it's always in my face so ya I'm done. My 2 pals that played too are also out. You do you though:)
---
There‚Äôs a perk where the amount of junk you carry increases damage resistance
---
The biggest one, and sometimes is unavoidable, is if you see a legendary enemy (one that has stars after it‚Äôs name) to just ‚Äútag it‚Äù when other people are near by.  Basically tagging is doing just a little bit of damage, either with a weak weapon or a gun bash or something like that. 
---
This way everyone gets a chance to do some damage and pick up a legendary reward.  
---
It‚Äôs a ‚Äúdo your best‚Äú thing, there may be times where you don‚Äôt know your own strength and kill it.
---
u may also be underestimating corporate presence in some of these 'toxic positive' posts.  its just part of the marketing budget, but goddamnit i hate that Shmod Shmoward that keeps urging me to download skyrim for my nokia cell phone
---
But I thought you fed him?!
---
That sounds reasonable
---
To hell with other players. Just have fun. I met my best ingame friends by being a complete jerk in area chat.
---
Only one rule: trust no one.
---
This is part of what made me quit the game both times. That dead zone due to high levels always skipping in the vicinity jacking up the levels of the East areas to 60's and above when the _main story points you there after general decent sailing_ was just baffling.
---
Basically this
---
Definitely not on the market but they still exist in private trade circles.
---
What... what year do you think it is?
---
All we need is modus transferred to a robo brain and we have new enclave
---
Awesome glad it worked.  This, and the disappearing elevator keycard for Hornwright plagued me on two characters.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs prevented a few others from progressing
---
Mount Blair? (The whole ash heap biom lol)
---
I don‚Äôt understand those kinds of posts. Why do people need validation on their decision to stop playing the game? Lol
---
I bet the only 'scaling' being done is actually displaying different levels. As far as stats go it'll probably be like ESO. Or are the same creature going to have different healthpools and whenever it takes damage to one of them, the same percentage is taken from all of them? weird.
---
Please make sure this scales properly with camp defenses because as of right now it isn't even worth the time to put down camp defenses at workshops
---
He can still do a lot of things like a ZAX
---
Bethesda needs to make a "gather x amount of toilet rolls and deposit it to certain outhouse where a certain guy is in it" daily.
---
&gt;So if all 24 players on a server face an enemy, that enemy might have 24 different yet simultaneous levels?
---
That's not how this kind of thing is usually implemented. The way this is usually done is that instead of using static levels and saying "Okay, a level 1 Lupogg has 10 HP and a level 30 Lupogg has 50 HP", it's done by using ~~ratio's~~ ratios instead, so for instance "A sniper rifle kills a Lupogg that's **at or below your level** in two body shots or one head shot, an assault rifle kills a Lupogg that's **at or below your level** in 5 body shots or 3 head shots", and "A sniper rifle kills a Lupogg that's **more than 10 levels above your level** in 10 body shots or 5 head shots", etc.
---
Now, I'm saying this assuming Bethesda does something sane, but we all know that's not how they roll so their actual implementation might be something completely wackadoodle. There's a real risk of them fucking this up, so it's wise to be afraid of them stepping in it again.
---
Play the PTS and give them tons of feedback, is what I'm saying.

Crystallizing has better range but decreased durability. Regular works better up close. I modded mine straight away to crystallizing then modded it back shortly thereafter.

I use a lever and stand out in the open to get her attention and when she lands I switch to cryolator and hit her at point blank in the face. She freezes more quickly this way than any other way.

On the other hand, I'm sure the Enclave are wondering who's nuking the shit out of Appalachia right now, and why. If Bethesda wants to do more Enclave stuff in 76, they'll figure something out that works.

Lol this is great ü§£

Man I can manage to get 100-500 paragon levels pretty quickly in a week of playing Diablo 3 nonstop, and that's slow compared to others. Not only that, but paragon levels give you more bang for your buck than these weak legendary perks 76 had (as of the last time they were in the PTS).
---
In F76 I am level 427 on my main, have two other characters both at level 100, and have played for 1,600 hours. I could barely max out 1-3 cards (between the perk scrap value changes), most of which were weaker effects than the standard perks. That's only after scrapping practically my *entire collection*. I don't know how grindy you really want this to be, but it shouldn't be a full time job.
---
What the hell
---
What‚Äôs meat week
---
Never underestimate the power of the underdog.
---
Fuckin Free States for life
---
I can‚Äôt get to analyze the blood sample is the something to fix this
---
Did my first yesterday lvl 56 with a vampire .50 MG. Thank you.
---
I got mine for 180 on Xbox last week. Expected the camp to be full of mounted heads and ultracite plans, was pleasently surprised to say the least.
---
This isn't an airport, you dont need to announce your departure.
---
Only downside is weight, but you gotta love the food and water mix!
---
the problem is how does the enclave know about nuclear explosions if they are in bunker with no contact with the outside?
---
Every time I‚Äôve got addicted to anything, or needed to reset my addictions I spammed them. Less than ten each and every time.
---
I don‚Äôt have private worlds
---
Hmm, I'm pretty much always up in her face point blank, so maybe a standard barrel will do.
---
Decals in general would be sweet. Dirt, grime, and graffiti would really help people who want to make their CAMPS look more post-apocalyptic.
---
Lol in my lobbies we got those ppl
---
no really. wat.
---
trending? you just posted this.
---
silver? There's no silver.
---
Rebelozzie hasn't commented.
---
Why does it say 1 year ago?
---
Am i missing something here?
---
We'll it is a secret organization that obviously infiltrates other factions. Or rather it is not a secret organization that does not infiltrate anyone because it does not exist. The enclave is just a crazy Free stater conspiracy theory. Calm down ad please broadcast your location so that "help" from the responders is able to ~~hunt you down~~ come to your aid quickly.
---
An act in three parts. Thrilling.
---
Ah Voice Over Pete, you will be missed
---
Ad Victorium, friend.
---
Agree. I just finished the grind on a character that won‚Äôt use most of the rep plans. However I Just started the rep grind on a heavy weapons character that will. I am not looking forward to the next month.
---
It‚Äôs probably another post on the front page (sort Hot/Best)
---
people have been doing shit like that forever. 98% of all player vendors do shit like this. another reason why people dont really want to deal with player vendors.
---
I don't so much 'hate' them. They're just assholes and their presence deeply irks me in extended sittings. Maxson seems a bit up in the air as he was more open to interaction, but the other members were fiercely in support of isolationism as we can see in the aftermath of even Fallout 1 and the way they operate. If they weren't such arrogant douche canoes, I'd be more open to them. I loved Lyons and even the Outcasts I had a warmer opinion on, but Maxson in F4 made me wish there was an option to just punch him in the jaw to shut him up.
---
what are you on about?
---
The funny thing is, the Mojave chapter are one of the more forward chapters as far as traditional BoS goes.
---
So why should they trust what you say? 
---
Checkmate atheist. Where is your god now?
---
Yea, theres a small chance that could happen (Bubbathesda) this analogy just... works
---
We'll have plenty of time to discuss presidents. Just you, us, a fusion core, and some jumper cables.
---
Id love to see the funky mid-century art sculptures, neon signs, billboard, and the fish lamp come back into rotation
---
I can see it now
---
Have: Legacy Punji Board Stack
---
Want: B2525 Handmade
---
They shouldn't. Gods dead, its buried under my back porch outside of tanagra town.
---
Well the trail warden isn‚Äôt trash to the right player but I see patterns to who the players in this game might be. I‚Äôm mad some are in the 1000 area but have zero interest in participating in this games content. Now they are rewarded with legendary perks? Bah, but can‚Äôt stop people who like to break things.
---
Your friend best mad made the story better for some reason. It's a complete arc.
---
Ok we will
---
Does that work?
---
Me too
---
All other companions are trash until you can bring Biv home.
---
The Poseidon oil rig,  and Raven rock were both highly advanced end of day bases for the Enclave . Having sensors to detect the atmosphere  isn't a stretch of the imagination.
---
I think there might be an aneurysm involved here.
---
For a while, yes.
---
Yeah, but hopelessly dogmatic and socially backward. No outcome in their questline filled me with joy.
---
And the only case where u do want to do a lot of damage is the queen isn‚Äôt it?
---
/r/fo76/comments/aanpke/my_level_7_friend_just_killed_the_queen_with_me/
---
Explain.
---
Perhaps Reddit is entirely different. On the old BGSF forums, I remembered the Brotherhood being a very divisive topic because a lot of people were quite supportive of them and the anti-BoS are in the minority there but they were much fiercer in their willingness to assert their opinion as right.
---
I'm not really Anti-BoS. I just don't like them because they're always the same thing, not through fault of the Devs the BoS are just unyielding assholes, and I don't like them for what their MO is. But I can see the appeal in the BoS for others, it's just not a faction for me. In 76 hi however, I fell in love with the Free States.
---
Are you m'ladying on OP's behalf?
---
Huntersville - West Tek - National Radio Array - Charleston Capitol Building - White Springs - from what I have seen, most places in the Cranberry Bog stand a chance to spawn Legendaries.
---
I pick a spot that looks interesting. I could care less about how far it is from common locations or what resource nodes it has. 1 and only rule is that the location must be interesting and add something to the camp I build. Never had a problem with players visiting my camp as long as I kept the machines full of good stuff. 
---
I usually look for a shop that has a good number of plans or a a decent number of both weapons and armor. 99% of the time I don‚Äôt buy anything because it‚Äôs mostly scrap legendaries that are only good for scrip. Every now and then I find a diamond in the rough.
---
As far as plans go, I don‚Äôt even bother selling common plans. I usually only sell plans you would find at spawn locations in the bog or rare plans that have a very low drop rate. The rest end up in a train station suitcase or go to a new alt.
---
So should I trust this comment or not?
---
They should up the limit to a weekly all at once limit, and they should share the limit between characters, and also the plans you learn should unlock for every character. So it doesn't matter which character you grind on.
---
You not gonna take me out for a drink first?
---
Hahaha
---
All good man. I have has them since Feb 2019 lol they will be there when you get back
---
We were never enclave. We just got access to enclave tech by a rogue computer to run its errands.
---
Wanna play tho
---
Yeah, but I think that's the point. The biggest theme of New Vegas and even in Fallout 4 is the Post-Apocalypse has happened and as the worst of the War has begun to fade away, societies are forming. The BoS is a relic of a time without societies, where might makes right. The BoS are much like the Samurai, rigid in their ways in a world where many places simply have no need for their ways anymore. It's a clash of the times and how they change.
---
For love of Modus please give us Enclave DLC üôèüèº
---
Trust no comments.
---
But yes.
---
Maybe.
---
Just warning you all. I have work all day, so if you see me playing the drums between the hours of 7am-4pm EST, PLEASE don‚Äôt kill me.
---
Something wack is going on here. Why would this user repost a post by another user from a year ago?
---
And why did two users post the exact same comment?  "Never underestimate the power of the underdog."
---
And why do both users have the exact same cake day. 25th july 2016 and 25th july and 2020.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/user/DJDribbles/](https://www.reddit.com/user/DJDribbles/)   [https://www.reddit.com/user/No\_Date8284/](https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Date8284/)
---
WHAT IS GOING ON!?
---
EDIT: OP has same cake day as well. Am i having a stroke?
---
Fuck this recipe. I spent two hours last night running the deep and received nothing but a few hundred waste acid from those cancerous crickets. Also 99% of the time the crickets had the health regen bug and took 3x longer to kill than normal. 
---
They are updating the game next week with a new boss fight where you have to nuke mohangan mines(not sure if i spelled that correctly) to open up a cave to fight the 4 star windigo collosus. 
---
Be prepared to be rewarded with 1 star rolling pins like the devs got during quakecon demonstration!
---
I am level 471.  The legendary perks should be a reward to people like me for grinding that many levels. And that's all the legendary perks should be. Period.   They should not simply be dumping me into another grind for hundreds of more levels to max out the legendary perk cards. As far as I'm concerned that's idiotic  game design and no amount of PR spin is going to change my mind. That is simply not acceptable and there is nothing that anyone can say or do to make me think otherwise.
---
Because MODUS was waiting for a new Member with the right imagination and drive....
---
And crafting stations, they need stash's too.
---
Scrip. It's "Scrip", there is no 't'.
---
Any Blueprints in your build?  BP take up the space that they would take if made.  Since it keeps the items.
---
Just a thought.
---
Tough one. How important are legendary perks to you? 
---
You get a set base of slots based on your level. I think it's 6, but whatever it is you don't hit max till level 350. So respcecing your character is likely faster for this than starting at 0. On the other hand buying levels requires perk cards, and every point you shift costs you a card. 
---
If that isn't important to you then what about SCORE?
---
In this light starting a new character also allows for easier satisfaction of the daily "level up" requirement, plus you are working towards developing your character, providing comfort in an otherwise monotonous grind.. 
---
If that isn't important what about SCRIP?
---
Then you should DEFINITELY start not just one but 3 New characters. Each should be developed to level 50, and TRY and aquire at least the fixer plans. That give you 4 cracks at the purveyor. Why not 5? I think you should hold back an expendable for quick leveling up, shopping (chap fast travel, can eat spoiled food and drink dirty water)
---
Right on man I definitely want to take a look lately all the Player vendors haven't been selling many weapons
---
Yeah just one, lamp post.
---
Did you ammo machine (from the factory) in your camp?  Ammo machine will break your budget likely until next patch.
---
I don‚Äôt believe you. I can‚Äôt trust you
---
BoS was cool back in 98.
---
Who would have thought back in 90ies that 2020s politics of social justice will make the BoS a deranged hated faction.
---
No.
---
If you are on xbox one i can help you switch your items over. I have a .50 cal build myself its pretty sweet! In fact i think i might have an extra .50 cal that i used to use that does +!0 damage while mutated 30% damage to animals and 250 resistance while loading you can have if you want.
---
trail warden is trash, its worse than any one star variant. and what are you taking about lvl 1000s not participating in content?
---
people who cheated levels are in the 1500+ range, and there arent that many of them. the current L perks system does reward them though, its pretty asinine. but it has nothing to do with that people have in their machines. thats just bad correlation-causation.
---
 Does last only as long as the week does and resets on Tuesday.
---
limits exists for a reason
---
*shrugs*
---
Honestly, its so easy to piss people off in this game. It doesn't really make much difference what you do. Be friendly, but don't trust that someone you haven't gotten to know won't screw you over. Never offer anything up for trade first, always make them go first or get a currier off reddit or a reputable group.
---
If youre on ps4, dm me you user name and add me if you want some help getting started, though. I dont play as hardcore as I did before.
---
Join some of the bigger youtubers discord servers. Even if they suck, if they have 4k people in their server it can be a great source of tips and teammates.
---
There's also the vague implication from New Vegas that there was at least some kind of outpost in Chicago.  
---
While it's improbable that it exists at this point, it's not necessarily impossible, and therefore we could get agents from there investing whatever the hell is trying to turn West Virginia into a radioactive desert.
---
Yeah, the Taggerdy chapter sounds like they were one of the better chapters. They fought a losing war and went down dragging as many Scorched with them as they could. I can respect that kind of spirit. Unlike other Boss chapters, I never despised Taggerdy's people, I actually pitied them because unlike a lot of other Chapters, they actually chose to fight to defend the people of the Wasteland. Plus, Taggerdy's personal struggles transition from USAF soldier to BoS is very well written.
---
People are blind from my experience.  Got to level 40 in about 3 weeks just joining matches solo when I had time and then doing something else around the house.  On multiple occasions I came back to the computer 30 minutes later to find only me and a full team of 3 or 4 left alive after 30 minutes.
---
I have my big orange stash box now so when I join a match now I just play normally LMAO.  It was the only reward I actually wanted.
---
I am PC but thank you so much for the offer!
---
Yes but the explosion could be detected by these sensor or they are less powerful?
---
Whatever happened to super settlements?
---
Yes but I wouldn‚Äôt rush to her until you‚Äôve finished the main overseer quest
---
If someone does the 'gift' emote, they are trying to give you something. So, no need to run away.
---
Don't capture a workshop unless you are willing to risk pvp. If you decide to do this, stash your junk items so that you don't lose anything if you die. 
---
You can go to your settings and place yourself on 'pacifist' mode. This makes it so that you cannot deal damage to other players. This does not guarantee that you cannot be pvped since other players can still shoot you and damage you. However, it makes it so that you are not able to accidentally provoke pvp by using explosives or other AOE weapons. 
---
With specific events like Encyptid, Project paradise, and Radiation rumble, do not activate the event right away when you see people standing around. These are tough events so people usually wait until the last minute to activate them in order to wait for as many players as possible to show up.
---
You're learning kid.  You're learning.
---
‚ÄúArmor Ace and the Power Patrol‚Äù
---
Power armor themed season? Hell yeah!
---
So I did it.  I placed 2nd or 3rd by hiding in bushes for the entire game, 20 minutes
---
I had a problem where on about 5 servers (I quit to desktop and logged back in, I assume I changed servers) it would not analyze the sample.  Every time it had me reinstall the fuse.  This last time I did it, I went to the computer first and analyzed the sample without installing the fuse and it worked.  I don't know if this is dumb luck, or the random party I joined but it definitely worked for me this time.  Maybe it will work for more of you too?
---
You should download some of the PC mods like perk loadout, and some of the UI mods for FPS. Have fun!
---
Well you can use a budget glitch but the problem with that is once you use it you have new budget problems, though arguably not as bad unitl they fix the glitch.
---
Oof. I‚Äôve already gone there twice. Only did enuf damage once tho.
---
How much more currency shit do we need in this game Bethesda? Fucking hell.
---
Honestly what I want is an all the above approach. Sure, give us 5-10 dailies for a little scrip. Give us 5-10 weeklies and a repeatable for a bit more. But take a cue from the pioneer scouts missions and give us a ton of 'whenever' missions that take anywhere from minutes to days to compete: Collect 5 mr. Fuzzies. Collect 10 bobbleheads. Mod 76 armor pieces. Revive 3 players. Launch 10 nukes. Complete 50 dailies. Collect 25 magazines. Kill 76 supermutants while carrying an axe and wearing a hat while in a group. Whatever. But give us something to keep us engaged and logged on once we're done with our dailies.
---
That‚Äôs fine, just kind of anti climactic once you get there
---
and you have to scrap each card by hand. talk about a tedious pain in the ass way to do that. and I am sitting on over 150 level-ups right now.
---
So instead of trying to reassure those leaving or sympathising with them and trying to find common ground, your response is 'Oh yeah? Well, bye then. I'm staying. Hah.'
---
I think I‚Äôm getting to know the game gameplay wise I just wasn‚Äôt sure about the social aspect. Didn‚Äôt want to anger a higher level and have them call a nuke on my camp.
---
What time do you usually play?
---
Almost all the time  playing right now
---
You can server hop to get more.
---
"How. NOW. Brown. Cow."
---
"What?!"
---
Nuked camps will happen. You shouldn't have too bad a time with resources to rebuild if you're already good with the grind. Leave server before touch down or take it on the chin and move on.
---
Lets be honest here fallout 76 has no real lore the arrival of the brotherhood and elder maxson coming , super mutants already here etc. It's all just fanservice
---
I've been trying the events, but mostly the swarm of suitors one, still nothing tho, just need the plain rocket one too cx
---
I love the lobby. That should be a map .
---
hah
---
dango, im on ps4, ty tho!:)
---
fair enough. Just gets tiring seeing the same thing so often with the same obvious solution
---
What do the workshops do if you don‚Äôt mind me asking? I‚Äôve seen them and went to an event to help defend it. At the time I didn‚Äôt realize it was a player controlled area. I‚Äôm just glad the guy who captured it recognized Im low level and friendly.
---
Use the camp budget glitch, solves the problem just get it back to normal brom there leave the server and it will be all opened up.
---
i hear that in my sleep, igo around work sayin " 3 thugs set three thugs free....oh i did it .....
---
I wanted the fishbowl helmet ... not the suit .
---
no I'm saying I have the separate junk box, theres no junk in my stash
---
Country roads.... take me home!!!
---
Thank you bethesda, very coolüëç
---
The problem is burnout, logging in every day is not something everyone can or is willing to do. I think a weekly system that unlocks new quests up until  fri/sat would be perfect, then you have the weekend plus monday to complete everything.
---
Yeah I had seen some footage of it from a live stream or video or something so I just wanted to check it out myself.
---
I'd like taming to not be a 1 in 2000 chance encounter based bullshit escort fuckfest.
---
seriously your turrets should level up with you from the beginning.
---
ty, I found this as well and it leads me in the right direction, ig I just gotta get lucky and get it from an event cx
---
42
---
To drive a bunch of robots and mutated free thinkers into the future? Give me a break.
---
I think the random chance of the cultists is a fantastic idea. Now that we‚Äôre talking about it maybe every event can have a surprise ending. 
---
Uranium Fever turns into load baring and you need to escape before they explode and the mine collapses
---
At the end of tea time the tea pot whistles and alerts a  Behemoth 
---
SBQ drops something other than a one star nocturnal pipe.
---
I've been doing all the other challenges first, and the Foundation and Crater dailies (along with Photo Opportunity), then I round out the night with a WesTek run or two.  Even at level 190ish, still getting a new level up every day.  It's not so bad, think of it as prepping your character for Legendary Perks.  The more levels and perk cards you have, the more perk coins you'll have to slot a Legendary.
---
You obviously lack the appropriate imagination.
---
* Don't trade or sell unless you are sure about the real value of things. Overpricing common items is a big no-no.
---
* Don't build your camp near Whitesprings, Morgan town, Tanagra town or Fissure prime unless you are Ok with ocassional nukes.
---
* If for some reason you get the WANTED over your head let other players kill you, it's the only way  to get rid of it.  And don't get mad, it's not personal. 
---
* Don't start ENCRYPTED event unless you were the one who bought the recall card.
---
* At the SBQ, try to shoot her from the fields next to the bunker, if you remain on top of the building/fence she will not land and can take longer to kill her.
---
I don't remember any other rules, those are the most important to me.
---
I‚Äôll definitely make sure to keep enough resources to be able repair. Does it notify you if your camp is targeted or does it just give you the death from above notification?
---
A YouTuber recently posted a 17 second solo stealth commando kill of the Scorchbeast Queen. At one point each headshot was popping up as 1,600 damage which is crazy considering it is after the flat 70% damage reduction the SBQ has.
---
"dead men tell no tales"
---
Just so you know you are 100% incorrect. I am on the market discord 24/7 and consider myself both extremely wealthy in game and a high level trader and have some rare stuff I wont ever sell. Some of my best items were aquired from player vending from people who didn't know what they had or from people who know what they have and purposefully price lower for one reason or another. Its been happening less recently, but picking up an extremely rare item still happens to me often enough that I still camp hop constantly when not doing score grind.
---
How do I know I‚Äôm learning if I can‚Äôt trust you?
---
Sometimes I would sit and watch while on my phone.  On multiple occasions I have watched people in power armor with a 50 cal walk directly into me inside my bush, they can't move through me and try to go around without questioning if maybe someone is in there.  I have had people come up into the same bush with a gun pointed into the back of my head and just sit there waiting.  Sure I have on a ghillie suit but ????
---
I have hardly played the mode that much and I know better lol.
---
"... smells like UNWASHED FEET"
---
We can't be sure, but its safe to assume yes they could. Again these were the most highly advanced bases America had created .
---
And they‚Äôll be using next season to re-engage your FOMO to make sure they can still keep their player numbers up
---
What is this nonsense?
---
It's probably not going to change (much) for end-game bosses. This seems to be targeted towards generic enemies spawned around the map for when people are exploring together
---
Imagination is obviously all you've got.
---
Bethesda. The Mire as a NW map with fog and everything. K thanks
---
Just death from above. I always check impact zone when I see it just to be sure. Sometimes people farming flux will hit you just because you're in the way. I never bother with workbenches except for challenges or to instigate PvP so I never really have to kind too much about changing servers.
---
And the sum of all of my characters is level 490 \*shrug\* I‚Äôm fine with dumping these cards I‚Äôll never use, in fact I want to. I want to get rid of the multiple copies of dromedary I will never use, the multiple copies of the perks that increase pistol damage when my character is unarmed/heavy,
---
You have to look at what problem this was solving.  People were asking for ways to get rid of the extra cards they don‚Äôt need. I‚Äôm sitting on tons of extra levels and packs among all my chraracters because I don‚Äôt want to crowd up my perks even more.  
---
This is a solution to the problem of excess cards.  Changing it to be a reward for simply leveling up means the problem wasn‚Äôt solved for.
---
Blueprints do not take space, do not confuse that with the stored tab.
---
I'd love to be able to prime my frame so I can use Ultracite cores, sick of having to split between cores for my UGL and cores for my PA.  An Ultracite frame could have some other ability, like decreased AP cost for sprinting, or increased carry weight, something like that.
---
Only works if I'm playing...
---
And you!
---
Is the price that it says on the item for example I think purified water is 20 caps accurate or is that not equal to the price the community gives it?
---
So the team leader chooses for everyone
---
So I‚Äôd be better of going in solo
---
Wait for the hot fix Tuesday unfortunately.
---
Karma fishing?
---
More targets,
---
That‚Äôs actually nice to know. Just picked up a Junkies weapon and can use the addiction.
---
I hope the game protects far fewer of them from being shot in the face to death than raiders/settlers..
---
overall Ive been disappointed with the large amount of "essential" NPCs...
---
I‚Äôve also been checking when I get the noti but I didn‚Äôt know if there was a special noti for your camp. Thanks for clarifying
---
It's a problem with a lot of weapons apparently... if you do so much damage that it would put the target beyond a certain level of negative damage the game thinks it miscalculted and resets some damage. Happens if you take a shotgun to negative range level. It causes it to almost have unlimited range. Saw a gameplay of a guy just sniping mutants from rifle area.
---
 I never could get the hang of Thursdays
---
using youre math 70% of the players i see in game will be maxed day one, 800 seems reasonable honestly
---
I'm fine with it. I'll have to wait and see if the group coming to Appalachia are techno-fascists like the mainline Brotherhood of Steel; what we know of the encrypted broadcasts, and that the expansion is called "Fractured Steel", suggests they may be split in ideals. 
---
And we also don't know if the questline will give us the option to side *against* the Brotherhood.
---
Thank you so much! I can now continue my overpowered shotgun build :)
---
Probably a bug, for me the mother walks around in a dress under spruce knob
---
Thanks dude! :)
---
It that why next to no one uses laser weapons aside from the heavy guns versions?
---
i really like this concept
---
I would rather them implement a scaled server system where your character can not enter unless you are that level. For example, entering a level 1+ server is just the base game but entering a level 100+ server makes even the forest enemies max level.
---
The damage you see on damage numbers and get in vats is a bug. The pathetic damage you actually end up doing after the health bar regenerates is their intended damage. Shotguns used to be like that a long time ago, but some bug a while back broke them to be stronger than intended under certain circumstances
---
But you do seem like a really hoopy frood to me.
---
Yes and no. If you take a break from the game you should break from the sub as well. It won‚Äôt do you much good if you‚Äôre still seeing the items and events you can only get for this limited amount of time because people talk about them and bring them up on the sub
---
no, the team leader only makes choices for their own story, and is the only one getting progress towards the quest. to let everybody have their own personal story and choices, everyone needs to either enter instanced interiors solo, or the group needs to go through multiple times while alternating the leader position.
---
I'll stay as well. Why leave now? Doesn't make sense...
---
Bethesda fix the ruddy Red Rocket garage door please!
---
Its going to be more than that.  ATLAS was used for weather research and manipulation.  What the BOS is planning to do with ATLAS itself worries me.
---
I noticed it yesterday. He seems bored.
---
1000% agree. 
---
Pistols need a major buff and cosmetic options, and perks moved to another SPECIAL attribute. That would be awesome. 
---
Shotguns need flat out fixing. The hard stop effective range is unrealistic, nerfing the damage  is bugged to hell. The rubber band effect is a symptom of a bad patch job.
---
Berserkers effect is garbage and needs a major overhaul. 
---
Bloodied is way to OP and either needs to be nerfed to junkie's level or everything else needs to be made OP like bloodied. Make it BALANCED.
---
It's also amazing on shotguns. It makes them nearly unbreakable with how the shot gun spread works.
---
Serums for everyone!
---
I‚Äôm waiting for the raider vending machine, perfect for selling the chems and alcohol
---
Tldr for me. But I‚Äôm willing to bet more effort was put into this than anything Bethesda would do, so have my upvote.
---
Meh. 
---
They'll need to do something impressive to make me care about them again. They're just so one dimensional. Unless we get to see them take various stances with various other factions, we're just going to get more of the same.
---
Pretty much. Not only are they mostly equalled or outmatched by other guns, they also break faster.
---
You're an actual lunatic if you think the amount of players at or above 400 are "70%." You need psychiatric help if you truly believe that. Especially lately with the influx of new players.
---
I'd wager money that the actual amount of players that high a level isn't even 5% of the total player base. And of those 5%, probably half of them took advantage of exp exploits during the beginning of this game's existence, or use Builds specifically designed to earn massive amounts of exp.
---
What system you on?
---
this can happen with any weapon, not just the GS.
---
I prefer a longer journey. There are games like Tibia with the Door of Banuta that requires a player to be level 999, that took this crazy dude named Kharsek like 9 years of his life yo reach and the rewards sucked bad. I have seen one level 800 in Fo76, to be honest, I think 1,500 was a better choice if Fo76 plans to last a few more years like ESO. There will always be players with over 10,000 hours of gameplay
---
This would be a great higher rep reward.
---
It's bad game design then if the intent isn't to max them out.  It's like bad MMO designers who used to go "just because you can do good DPS, doesn't mean you should do good DPS" as an explanation of annoying aggro mechanics
---
All good takes. When they made the nighttime patch I think they mentioned Nocturnal still procs from 6pm-6am; it‚Äôs just not dark out.
---
People talk about that quest but I have no memory of ever playing it. Do you only get it if you side with the raiders for the vault raid?
---
Love it, can't wait.
---
Game wise - new content üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Game Play wise - don't give a hoot about the PoS BoS. Outside of the quest you won't find me role-playing them. 
---
Hopefully it's a good quest line with an either/or ending that allows you to choose between open support or suspicion with unique rewards depending on your choice. Sadly can't see it being any different to the Settler/Raider siding conundrum that wasn't.
---
And just up the buying amount of vault steal to more than 5 at a time. I spend more time server hopping to buy vault steel than i do playing
---
Eh. Don't care much about them but glad to have new content.
---
NP
---
That‚Äôs why I have 5 characters. Fill up 1, transfer to the next.
---
By the time all 5 are maxed, there‚Äôs generally a purveyor sale.
---
I picked up the American flag when it was on sale as a stand-in for an Exclave banner.

---
&gt; It's bad game design then if the intent isn't to max them out. 
---
In what time frame?  
---
My point about maxed out what his reference to ... you would max 1 perk out before moving to the next one.  I think he's looking at that the wrong way.  And that - realistically - getting all your perks maxed out is something that happens over the next year or two.  Not 3 months.
---
I personally love this game. I love being able to play with my friends who play and I like the environment. I love West Virginia. It's in my blood. I love the creatures you fight. I have fun. Even with glitches and shit. I have fun! ..I still don't like the "Find a Bobblehead" daily challenge, though. Lol But that won't make me leave.
---
Ha, I remember waaaaaay back when the early B.E.T.A. was going on and they only left servers up for a couple hours at a time. On the last couple sessions I just said screw it and ventured as far as I could in each direction just to see what was out there and it was scary as hell but worth it. Just keep sprinting.
---
I *do* know where my towel is
---
You can count me among them.  I didn't grind for this long to have my best weapons lose their effectiveness.
---
Seeing as you've asked the home work help sub to outright do your homework for you and posted in GTA Glitches sub asking if a glitch still works....
---
I'm gonna say that your ghost budget is due to the ammo factory glitch.
---
I should also mention, I will use hand grenades, nut only what I salvage
---
Saw a guy buy a forest camo jumpsuit for 15 caps. It‚Äôs always worth checking
---
Thats pretty much what I run.
---
15 STR with all th usual melee perks. I gave a couple point for packrat and bear arms.
---
13 PER, with tank killer, glow sight3, and several other rifle perks.  
---
3 CHR (lone wanderer only.)
---
At 228, I dont bother much with hacker or lock pick anymore - I swap out if I think I need them.
---
also run stabilized3 for the times I want to use something heavy - mainly against cargobots and SBs that dont want to land  :)
---
Actually no lol, I love fallout actually play that legit.
---
Boring I Would rather have a faction war with the mothman cultists vs the enclave just hope I can nuke the brotherhood to smithereens
---
I've often seen a lot of people be helpful and empathetic, but I've also seen a lot of selfish behaviour. There are two main reasons:
---
1. Human behaviour. Humans are quite 50/50 in my experience. You tend to get nice ones that are quite giving and caring, and then you get the assholes that are very self-centered and only care about something if it affects them.
---
2. Roleplaying. You get a lot of people that roleplay as raiders etc. They like to be bad in games because it's something they cannot do in real life. Eve Online is a good example of this. You get a lot of anti-social and down right psychopathic behaviour in games like it because it's an outlet. They can vent their anger and hatred and destroy and hurt others without any real negative feedback.
---
The easiest fix for this is to do it on a private server. If you list what system you play on someone may be able to help you out.
---
TLDR: stop supporting the game and they‚Äôll make it better 
---
Yeah, ok...
---
Both are in the shop
---
I play most UK evenings and play on PC if I can be of service with an item/character swap. 
---
IGN is IdlePX, discord is IdlePX, reddit is... Yep.
---
why can't they just be interesting and entertaining like me if they want karma so much?
---
Daily ops sounds fun
---
Bulk ammo, drugs, treasure maps
---
High level players clear me out all the time. Either to burn off their caps max, or because they're using ammo intensive builds.
---
How can you make that comparison to ESO?
---
That game has a similar system. The Champion System. If you play that game organically, you might hit the max, 810, for that within a year. I started that game in April 2018, and by April 2019, I was at 810. 
---
I've been playing Fallout 76 in a similar capacity, and at this point, a year and 9 months in, I wouldn't even be half way to the "Max" of Legendary Perks.
---
Tedious Grinds are great for a select few players who only want to play one game, but for the majority of players, grinds kill the desire to play, not extend it.
---
That's how they give us the prizes
---
Mine keeps popping up the legendary Run score, making the noise that I unlocked more points, but the score bar stays on the screen resetting to 0 and moving up to where it was.
---
Like, I'm not getting any points, just a random period of it suddenly acting like I did.
---
We hit concrete, they lowered the amount needed.
---
I have some issues with this post...
---
1. a handmade with the cutdown handle is a rifle, not pistol. So that's Rifleman.
---
2. A 10mm submachine gun is an automatic rifle therefor Commando, not a pistol.
---
3. The weapons you use (stalker and hunter nevermind bolt action pistol) make this a very challenging build if not outright anathema to the point you're trying to make.
---
What you should be telling people is that pipe weapons double dip for both Rifleman and Gunslinger perks, or that a VATs-crit build makes it a lot more powerful.
---
We hit the concrete deadline... we were at 12/15 the day before and finished up on the last day before it switched to cork
---
Not focusing on SCORE and letting it just level up randomly is great. I've gotten to about 55 or so without actively trying and I've been playing maybe 1 to 4 hours a day casually. I don't often look at the challenges. The one time I tried to do SCORE challenges specifically it SUCKED the fun out of the game for me. God I hated it. Thankfully nothing in this run has been something I wanted, and I haven't noticed the score bug because of this lack of focus. But holy shit just reading about the auto-completing gives me second-hand anger and raises my blood pressure.
---
Edit: The only thing that sucks atm is that I literally cannot get most end-game gear like SS or T65 power armour. I like to play a lot all at once sometimes and the fucking caps on how much I can earn or how much scrip I can trade sucks the life out of me. Killed me for a week straight after I found out about the caps and made me leave the game for a while.
---
Same. I'm at rank 78 or 79 on my account. I also grinded out some of my boyfriend's dailies. Honestly tempted to buy out the rest of both of us.
---
Yoinked
---
Same. I jump on to get scrip and turn in notes in anticipation of (hopefully) end game content in the future and then peace out.
---
That‚Äôs what I found out works.
---
Join teams. I find team mates visit and buy fairly often, but also when other players see a bunch of players around your camp on the map, they tend to follow. 
---
Make sure you have a good array of stuff in good quantities. If you don't have weapons/armour worth selling, or just a few pieces, just put those few pieces, don't try to fill it out with trash gear. I'll walk straight out of your camp. 
---
As for location, I've built in the mire, savage divide and forest to great success. So long as your not bugging the edges of the map, being a 50 cap fast travel? I'll head there.
---
Edit: The things I sell most often? Ammo. Drugs. Treasure maps. Very rarely plans. I sell a decent chunk of junk legendaries dirt cheap for players looking to scrip them out. I also have decent success with selling solid but not amazing Unyielding and junkies gear on the cheaper end.
---
what would be the point? you can't kill the wise mothman.
---
Fuck em with a cactus. I want a Free States revival.
---
They work like your camp area (you can build things) but they contain resources which can be gathered using extractors. Different workshops have different resources. Some have unique extractors, like the sunshine meadows one which can make packaged food.
---
The workshops have a large build budget, and come with "free" resources - you can build without dipping into your own stash (unless you build like 50 turrets)
---
Periodically they then generate a "defend" event where the workshop gets attacked by some waves of creatures.
---
Although it has a pvp warning, realistically pvp is pretty uncommon. Couple of easy tips though;
---
Dont be afraid of claiming an unclaimed workshop. They're not a beacon for people to come kill you.
---
Trying to claim an already claimed one is probably asking for a fight. If you feel ballsy enough, feel free to try though.
---
Stash your junk before claiming/building. This way on the off chance you do die to pvp, you dont lose anything.
---
Lock your extractors. People might not fight you for it, but if its unlocked its going to get nicked.
---
Build a stash box at the workshop. This way any resources you gather, you can stash straight away.
---
Dont spend your own junk building things. If the build cost shows the resources in green, you're using the "free" ones. If its yellow then you're using your own stash.
---
Dont be upset if someone does PVP you/take it from you. If you've followed the previous tips you wont lose any junk.
---
Dont start claiming one when theres someone else in the area. The game will auto put you into pvp and the claim will stall untill one of you dies/leaves the area
---
This could get 100k upvotes and awards and they‚Äôll never respond to it. Such garbage community transparency. It took the ENTIRE community to bitch about the ammo converter for them to respond. I appreciate your effort and your post, but BGS will not.
---
They‚Äôre free in the atom shop though?? Like a big green free banner on them.
---
No problem! Hope it helped!
---
Agreed. I've missed a couple floors, but this is one I'd love to see back up.
---
Why can‚Äôt I be a fucking ghoul yet? I wanna be immune to radiation. 
---
Why isn‚Äôt there a ghoul city? Why isn‚Äôt there more cognizant mole miners like Mama Mumbles? Why isn‚Äôt there more self conscious super mutants like Grahm? Where are all the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù from other states migrating to WV? I mean we need more population in this game before we can even decide who to back. We need more stories and more factions. 
---
Me personally, would love to see Bethesda introduce 76ers as a faction to where you support only vault dwellers, cuz we did all this shit for BoS and the Institute in FO3 and Fo4. It gets old when factions like to hoard shit and not rebuild anything. 
---
Why not **rebuild Appalachia OUR way? The 76er way.**
---
‚ÄúHint hint, how about an event just like Atlas, but to build a community hub for Vault Dwellers? Now that‚Äôs something that has incentive.‚Äù
---
On xbox I get regular freezes for a few seconds. Probably 20 to 30 times an hour. It's not something that bothers me too much, but god damn Bethesda.
---
[Wait! The Brotherhood also needs a Sourdough Jack!](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2002/09/27/)
---
You know, I support the Brotherhood in anyway I can, but I dont happen to have my card on me... but what I do have is this nifty Charge Card, good for 100 caps. Just so i dont have to carry around all those clunky caps all the time.
---
I bet the chicken nuggets afterward were... legendary
---
As an additional incentive we could release a new Legendary Perk as part of the tank 100 Score reward for each season, making it thematically appropriate with whatever that season is about.
---
Yes? Do we have a date for patch 22?
---
They take donations if you truly want to some some love ;)
---
I feel like the storyline is second thought now. Before it was great and I‚Äôd listen to holotapes etc.
---
I kinda thought about that when I thought how op 6x5-30 extra special points would be for me having a balanced character. When I only had 51 to begin with.
---
If the level adjust goes both ways though, then won't low levels be able to participate in events like Radiation Rumble, One Violent Night, Scorched Earth, and so on? Shouldn't those creatures scale down?
---
I suggest taking a look at this ini guide, and making some changes to your settings. Most of the other players I know that have used this guide, and other more in depth ini edits, have had no issues with the frame drops reported after the last patch.
---

---
September. Season 1 is supposed to end on the 10th-15th afaik
---
The real Brotherhood is the super-mutants we killed along the way.
---
Friends or party members can also not see it.
---
It only let me up to 17 hats for some reason until it capped.
---
it would be nice if the poodle skirt and hip glasses made a come back.
---
it's one of the only launch items that i've never seen brought back.
---
I wouldn't consider the [ZAX](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/ZAX) line as a simple bot.  It's far more advanced, and intelligent then that.  MODUS is currently pretty badly damaged though, so it's likely he has lost a lot of his memories. (I don't think MODUS is a ZAX AI specifically, but seems to be a peer.)
---
Looks great! Thank you for your generosity! Safe travels in Appalachia!
---
I carry a scattered low DPS laser rifle specifically for events with other people. There is plenty others can do to manage.
---
It projects in all directions actually.
---
Yeah my first character was a jack of all trades carry as much as possible guy, playing like it was Fallout 4,but my next 3 followed a single weapon type build and they could kick a lv 200+'s ass at lv 25, was hilarious!
---
Sticking to the right special points and perks is really important for decent damage output.
---
Who dis... new number...
---
I'd like some free states clothes that I don't have to spend atoms on
---
Yes but those events have other added requirements to participate.  For example RR and SBQ essentially require hazmat suits or power armor.  OVN requires a lot if ammo.  Finally when competing against people with god roll gear they might never get hits in for it to matter.
---
ATHENA is in your brain too?
---
The word on the web is at level 50 you loot the SBQ you have to inflict 1000 damage.
---
im not saying you wont *ever* find something in a vendor, but you can never expect there to be anything good in machines, Best case scenario is scoring off someone who doesnt know what they have. its the exception, not the rule. and shopping to buy random things that catch your eye is VERY different then trying to get something even remotely specific. someone might undervalue, but that doesnt change that fact that BiS gear is trade only.
---
More of the map being useful is a fair point. That being said, I think the best experience farming locations will remain, e.g., Wes Tek or the Charleston capital building. I personally prefer farming events, so I am still unlikely to visit the ash heap or the forest with my high level characters.
---
I disagree that leveling is easy sub 50. In my opinion, it's a long and tedious chore best done during double or triple experience weekends. Maybe it's easy if you have a full low-level unyielding armor set, but I'm not that lucky.
---
There is a middle ground will minimal downside. If regions have *minimum* enemy levels, or if there is a region like the cranberry bog where enemies are always max level, then power leveling would still be possible and higher level players would face stronger enemies on the western side of the map.
---
For clarification on your perspective, do you already have multiple leveled characters? I can understand not caring about power leveling if you have already power leveled several characters. I don't yet have a heavy gunner, so I am interested in power leveling another character.
---
Slocum's Joe neon billboard.
---
Are you using a skin on your camp module? Bugs have been reported around that.
---
If you have the future tec camp it wont show up current bug
---
Which end do you suck on?
---
I‚Äôve had this bug, and I‚Äôve seen streamers affected by it as well. I haven‚Äôt found anything that fixes it other than a full restart (from my experience). Not gonna place down my camp again and have to rebuild to see if it fixes a bug.
---
Maybe Bethesda should just forget that this is a game, and just give everything to us without playing. Hell just make it a movie. What's the sense in playing a game when we are all entitled assholes that want the game exactly our way or else. If you've been here since release then maybe you should try a different game or get a fucking life, and quit bitching all the time?
---
Season 1 ends the 8th I believe. So 2 weeks later is the 22nd... still in September. Also they can add the season in the patch but don‚Äôt need to activate right away.
---
They announced a fix date in the itv today.
---
Wont apply till much later, but if someone has worked their way though clearing a nuclear bunker, dont wander in and launch the nuke. If you are wanting to launch and you see someone else there, go to a different bunker.
---
I don‚Äôt have a choice, I‚Äôm currently trapped in the Wendigo cave..
---
My lowest level is in their 50s now.  That ship has sailed lol
---
I'm too much of a Fallout freak fan to leave, although not crazy enough to subscribe to FO1st .
---
Yes. It always fun after Line in the Sand to count the number bonus score points I get.
---
1) Nuka Quantum neon sign, Welcome Home neon sign and Pickaxe Pilsner bar sign
---
2) St. Patty's Nukashine kegs, they were not really publicized during the time
---
3) Valentines Jarred Scorchbeast heart w/ wires, and fish bowl lamp
---
4) Red Shag Carpet, Rudolph the Wasteland reindeer lawn decor
---
5) Pink Valentines Suit and my ever hopeful, Holiday Tux/Suit, the original black not the gold sparkle.
---
By scorchedbeast do you mean the Queen? If so, you need to do around 2k damage. Can be difficult when people have certain god weapons but most of the time it isn't too hard.
---
Edit - forgot to mention for the legendary challenge you only need 1 hit for it.
---
Tame it for golden eggs
---
Sorry so late to respond. I know this but the OP isn't asking about actual accuracy, he was talking about the percentage displayed in VATS targeting.
---
From what I remember its 2000 for the SBQ
---
Sure have been a lot of these posts lately... why didn‚Äôt they just use this, or copy this, or take this from Fallout4... if everyone misses fallout4 so bad why don‚Äôt they go play fallout4. Lol. I‚Äôve never played 4 so I don‚Äôt have anything to compare it to.
---
How do I even get Legendary Perks? The game didn't tell me about them and I'm level 76. Googling it just gives me a bunch of shit from before they released.
---
ü§£üòÇü§£
---
Actually, pylons putting you down are one of the few things that don‚Äôt kill you out- right.
---
I think without the right build and weapons, a level 50+ character would still struggle with level 50+ enemies. There is still reason to grind.
---
This game absolutely needs better inventory management. The amount of time I spend working on my inventory is far too much. 
---
I want to be out exploring, fighting stuff, building things, and having fun. Instead I spend a lot of time muling stuff over to a storage character. Instead of having fun I'm fretting about my inventory and my carry capacity.  
---
I don't have any experience with the FO4 pip boy app but I do have experience with Destiny 2's item management app (well I use the website) and Destiny 2's item management app is absolutely amazingly useful. It lets you move stuff in and out of your stash and just really helps you manage your inventory and get back to shooting. 
---
I'd love it if FO76 could implement some inventory quality of life improvements like this
---
*edit: oh yeah if you're on PC I highly recommend getting some inventory management mods to help you sort through your inventory... so very useful
---
Wasn't that part of the settlers "add on" download for Wasteland? Think it was a few bucks. Might still be up on Xbox at least
---
With the brotherhood involved we could see a faction system pitting them against each other. Or you're right and there's enclave out there looking at maps trying to figure out why Appalachia won't stop nuking itself. I'm happy either way.
---
&gt; And I also disagree with your assessment that this community is "overly positive," - Fallout players, in general, are mostly single player (and a slightly older demographic), which means they tend to be a bit more mature.
---
How did you come to this conclusion? I did a quick search for average age of gamers and about 38% are 18-34 but 21% is still under 18 as of 2020 and the disparity increased for a few years and then started decreasing as gaming becomes more mainstream (twitch/fortnite/minecraft/discord etc/always online consoles). I cant find any numbers for the average age of fallout players or their dispositions in any case or numbers specific to all consoles platforms. Additionally, age is not an great indicator of maturity imo. Kids do stupid shit, (as a father I am sure you can point to some recent examples of your own kids) but unfortunately a lot of adults who should know better do also. We have legal definitions, [but they are based on assumptions so that a legal system can function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_\(psychological\)#Age). 
---
Anecdotally: I see it vary a bit here with the temperature of the game as per usual with most gaming communities. I personally see a trend indicating more negativity as of late in general, but with good reason and that is natural with the volume of bugs and delays in fixing them. I also tend to agree with the fact that there is a growing number of users who are not necessarily leaning one way or the other who only want positivity such as the guy that made the "Im staying" post. As a footnote, one of the things I do at my job is build custom order gaming desktops, and the past three years or so I have built far more machines for a much younger demographic than I ever have before. Just last week a 9 year old walked in my shop door with his mom and ordered a 1500 build so he could fornite. 
---
Not necessarily disagreeing, just curious.
---
Is A Colossal Problem a short-term or permanent addition? I haven't seen it stated or even implied anywhere.
---
They haven't been released yet. They've been pushed back 2 or 3 times now because people have hated each terrible iteration of the system.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they get further delayed.
---
"It just works". Lol
---
He's saying some of us actually DO sell high tier gear in our vendors because we don't trust players enough to trade with them. There's so many scammers out there. It's not ideal, but player vendors at least keep us from getting ripped off.
---
I agree with your last statement, some grinds can scare people away, but how would you reward insane high levels without new features or content? They could do achievements, banners or some CAMP items with really insane goals.
---
The comparison with ESO was only about their lifetimes. Some popular console games have started to become the new "mmorpgs" or the new "WoWs", GTAV has been up for almost a decade, rdo seems to go that way, No Mans Sky too maybe, maybe Fo76 too, this is why I find it silly that there are people that are genuinely expecting Fallout 5 sometime soon, who knows. Anyways, if this was the case, how would you keep veterans hooked? There should be always something to look out for
---
As the other reply state: it‚Äôs because of the future tec camp module if you‚Äôre using that. The only known fix for it is to move your camp and rebuild using no camp module skin, or either of the raider or settler skins from the paid Wastelanders expansion items.
---
Love you guys,,,Finding the codes without your website is super tedious. If it wasn't for you at Nukacrypt we'd probably get a Nuke once every 2 weeks at best. God bless you.
---
u/waffle_cop  u/texnevada  u/eckserah
---
Exactly.  I put at least a year of playing every day into my armor set on my main character, and quite a lot of Purveyor rolls and trading to arm three characters with high end guns and melee.
---
Yeah, that's probably for the best. For me, I like the challenge of trying to solo endgame bosses, at least once. So far I've defeated every enemy solo, at least once.
---
For the random encounter Wendigo Colossus, every time I find it solo I try to get people to join in but that has only worked a few times. So far I've defeated it solo about a half dozen times ranging from about 1 minute to about 15 minutes, depending on my character.
---
I'd like to see what they think targets should be, realistically. That should tell us a lot about their thoughts.
---
I mean, do they expect 1000 to be a level many are at after a few seasons?
---
On the one hand: I have no actual idea who those folks'll be.  
---
Yes, they're "Brotherhood" but that actually doesn't mean much right now. Maxson fancied the Brotherhood to be the guardians of a what's left of civilization. His cited reason for hoarding technology was so it could be used at a later time to rebuild without making the mistakes of the past. "From that seed, a new civilization will be born" and all that. Lovely stuff, very poetic. Maxson must've liked to read.  
---
He also murdered the West Tek scientists, so take from that what you will.  
---
Taggerdy had no desire to LARP "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" but it gave some of her men a rallying point and it evidently wasn't worth fighting Roger. At her core, she was still Army and we know of at least one guy who broke who was Ranger.   
---
Even their actions towards to the other factions of Appalachia spoke more of an armed force fighting a threat on foreign soil than gallant knights on the ramparts, protecting the poor and downtrodden.  
---
So maybe these folks'll be zealots, intent on their chivalrous oaths, scouts and soldiers just doing their duty, something in between or something else entirely.  
---
On the other hand: I kind of don't care.  
---
The Brotherhood is a symbol, a banner, a flag over their head that relies on familiarity to have impact. They are not familiar because they are not established yet.  
---
The BoS of Appalachia are bones and rust, the BoS of the West Coast are old holotapes, and these are folks are god only knows what.  
---
If they're civil and contribute, I'll be alright with them.  
---
If they're brutal and destructive, I won't.  
---
Anything beyond those parameters'll be determined on a case by case basis.
---
"Why on earth would my character want to help an army of heavily-equipped technohoarding holy warriors"
---
Nothing holy about it. The answer to this is that it totally depends on what your character knows about the Brotherhood and how you feel about it.   
---
Honestly I cannot for the life of me relate to someone who has researched the Brotherhood lore that is in Appalachia and dismisses them, especially when they are pretty much the only reason that the responders had the time to exist to build themselves into a "faction"
---
Ok thanks for the heads up! I noticed it in one of my machineguns as well when it threw a ton of damage it almost brought them back a bit 
---
Ugh - its an amo killer 
---
Looks like i gotta find that perfect 2 shot balance
---
I bought the last 5 ranks. Now I have nothing to do except accumulate more gold. i don't have anything I need to buy until they put Deep Pocketed and Shadowed SS Armor limbs into Reg's shop though.
---
We actually did get concrete. Bethesda lowered the amount needed to 15 million and everyone decided concrete is no longer the rarest material no more.
---
Then again, I have an intentionally broken wall decorated as a doorway and people keep repairing it....
---
I am happy wandering around as a teddy bear and prefer to let my actions speak for themselves, as I doubt I would ever be confused for something bad as I help people, save people, avoid PvP, and think technology is for all LoL
---
There is something else you may not have.
---
Cave fungus - only obtainable currently from the communist collectron.

I mostly use the pieces for their rad resistance, not going to lie

For my Enclave character I decorated my camp using patriotic decorations like the Enlist! poster, american flags, bunting, and such. They are the true American government and any loyal American would of course be on their side (from Enclave pov). Completely agree, though. There is a lot of potential there.
---
I don't think doubling the allocation to allow players to craft a single piece of armour per server would cause a stack overflow. And my friends/team aren't in that server. And we're bonded
---
Yep, leaving PA seems to flood your notification with the score, though.
---
Well now I do
---
Ahh, of course. Leave it to Bethesda to turn a relatively simple concept into something poorly designed and not user friendly.
---
*cough* ammo converter *cough*
---
That's why I want Watoga to not include most of the bog.  Have the battle be among buildings and walkways.
---
There needs to be more legendary mothman encounters ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Sometimes my Gauss Shotgun is like the fist of a God. Sometimes it's like an L5 pipe pistol under identical situations. It can be frustrating for sure.
---
Me as well...
---
I‚Äôd have followed Taggerdy to hell and back twice over. The Thunder rolling down the scorchbeast lair against it all, even if it was doomed before it began, is exactly the kind of people we are in Appalachia. Stubborn, territorial, and trigger happy, but we do everything possible to take care of our own. No matter the costs. 
---
Knowing she threw her hat in with these folks? I‚Äôm happy to hear them out, maybe lend a hand here and there. Things are good  now, subsisting in the hills and culling the scorched. So long as they don‚Äôt overstep, I‚Äôd tolerate some new neighbors.
---
Will do
---
The suggested prices are pretty wild.
---
Put it this way; given that you find lots of purified water while exploring, get loads as rewards for missions, can build your own purifiers at camp to make it for free, and almost every player camp has their purifiers unlocked because its so plentiful, would you actually pay 20 caps for it? If not, noone else is going to.
---
Eh, 2020's politics still hasn't made the BoS a deranged hated faction. 
---
The hoops you have to jump through to get to them being a deranged hated faction in this game is so utterly bizzare, especially when the enclave is a thing.
---
Yeah but don‚Äôt u have to pay for most of the content? That would be ideal I‚Äôve been an ElderScrolls guy since just about the beginning
---
Just return paint job benefits from fo4 like +C for wearing a full set of vault tec armor
---
Hopefully they add more ways to get perk packs like they did for this season's rewards, but I can see this current system as a huge turn off to some players.
---
Hah, I asked the same thing a few weeks ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i0p80q/why_does_a_bass_line_play_for_notifications_when/). For me the bug starts happening after switching from NW to Adventure, although others say it happens to them without that.
---
Once you're in this 'mode', any notification in the upper left (diseased, overencumbered, new event starting, etc...) will cause the bass lick to play.
---
The worst, the absolute worst, is when you're doing Ward's stupid thing and you have the radio on to find his 'lost equipment' - every time that radio updates the signal strength, the lick plays again. Drives me CRAZY. 
---
I've been told just switching servers is enough to fix it - others have said you need to quit and restart.
---
Same here dude, I‚Äôm definitely staying only because of being able to get good loot from the popular and most engaged events ever...
---
With the Brotherhood coming back, hopefully PA gets some much needed love
---
None of those games have achieved the lifespans they have with tedious grinds.
---
There are systems within them to grind, yes, but they are never a main focus. Just something that progresses naturally while doing the main content.
---
But then that's the issue. Fallout 76 doesn't have a lot of content. It has a lot of Grind that is attempting to disguise itself as content. If they keep adding things like Bullion and Scrip and Legendary Perks, the player base will only shrink and the game will die off faster.
---
And I'm of the mindset that "insane high levels" should not be rewarded. Not that they should be punished or anything, but they should not be treated as though they stand on a Golden Pedestal. Why reward an unhealthy amount of obsession? It's predatory behavior.
---
Wow. Ok. I didn‚Äôt plan on capturing one but now I just might hav to. That packaged food one sounds pretty good
---
But it's not even enough for 1 peice of armor. Equates to 50 scrip which is less than a days worth of turn ins. 2 server hops per day to buy all the vault steel you can - its just too few. It should minimally be 15 vault steel if not 50 to match legendary modules
---
There is a lot of pay to play stuff but I haven‚Äôt yet and I‚Äôm having a ton of fun and it‚Äôs free to play till the 19th. If u have game pass. Just a suggestion it‚Äôs truly a breath of fresh air.
---
I'm not going anywhere till AC Valhalla comes out. But I'll be back after I finish it (and periodically while I'm focused on Valhalla, depending on what's going on)
---
Those commie collectors have fed me on many occasions. Lots of them get left unlocked (as they should be).
---
why was this removed, what‚Äôd it say?
---
You shut your trout mouth! You have a sick and twisted definition of fun! If this becomes a 'feature' (starts happening all the time), I'm going to blame you!
---
:-)
---
&gt;but it was the Responders who were making the vaccine we used, or the Free States building a detection network
---
It's not a vaccine, it's an inoculation, and the BoS was well on it's way to doing something better (and couldn't, because of tensions with the Responders, who didn't even believe in scorchbeasts till it was too late) with the lab at VTU.
---
The Free States straight up jacked BoS tech for the detection network (which was also too late to do anything)
---
What ab plans prices are those higher than a good price or are those on par with what players pay or does it just depend per item
---
You must be a god damn laugh riot at parties.  I was having some fun.  Lighten up bitter German guy.
---
My favorite is still legendary Steelheart.  Can't kill that bastard no matter how much you want some scrip.
---
My camp building works just fine
---
Thanks for the link. It seems like at best I can only reach 85ish if I'm grind for 10k XP on the rest of days. Well, I'm not PA user but it felt kinda sad for the just one step for the special skin. I also found I will have to grind almost 150k XP each day if I want to reach the max rank(assuming the double XP and scores is happening), guess it's not like some other games that events are designed to be able to complete if players attended like only half of the period then
---
Its more so that today when I tried to build the stairs wouldnt snap in just one specific area of the camp. Everywhere else just fine but this one little smidge of grass.....nope, no metter what I did!  And I shouldn't have to decide between having a flat plot or access to water or a resource because building on a grade is such a cluster fuck.
---
What I like best about trap bases is when the owner seems upset you do not care you lost some junk.
---
I don't disagree with your rather well-written summation of the NV brotherhood, but that is precisely why I find them so unlikeable; they're willing anachronisms, stubbornly refusing to acknowledge the circumstances they find themselves in. The fact that they spawned Elijah doesn't help their case any, either. I have never hated an NPC with as much fervor as that sonofabitch in Dead Money.
---
Thanks for the update, I was getting worried.
---
It's been basically non-functional since Wastelanders.  
---
The dot from attacks still works, albeit nowhere near as well as it used to, but the radial damage almost doesn't exist.  
---
It's probably a bug, as I can't imagine it's intentional that it work like this compared to where it used to be.  
---
I'd submit a ticket, hope for the best, and start saving for the T-65 or whatever the Brotherhood is going to bring us.
---
Is it floating? At are you near water or a resource?
---
there are way less scammers than you think. ive made hundreds of trades, never been ripped off. you can even use courier services if you are scared of getting scammed.
---
I agree with you there, they didn‚Äôt make the terrain very receptive to the floor pieces they gave us
---
My camp is completely over water
---
Dude you're flying an enclave flag, the faction that is responsible for the destruction of the world. But go ahead and worry about the weather...
---
You can thank the dupers for a massive SH dupe,  and beth's incompetence on fixing things for the nerf.
---
I ran vault 94 and worked my ass off for SH armour, and it used to be amazing
---
AoE used to be very noticable on everything, except very bulky enemies, and the acid damage from attacks was amazing
---
Yeah you only get progress for the instanced quests if you are the leader of the group, or the people in your group go in their own instance.
---
Is there any chance of a steam version of the PTS?
---
Man this comment is so on point.
---
Permanent.
---
don't read too much into a vocal minority.
---
Oh this makes more sense. That would be cool
---
For sure, but that is subjective and will bite harder depending on the niche whereas it is categorically more likely you will find a good or great item in-game randomly as that is how the majority of rare drops are introduced (like the noob who gets a tattered field jacket and lists it for 100 caps which happened to me). I ran into a guy last night who was holding out on me and was only looking for a specific hunters roll with cavaliers for god knows what reason and wouldn't take 99% of trade offers and that was either a collectors item for him or BiS for what he was doing. There will always be people like that but I believe the trade market is over-emphasized and the majority of transactions even for the rarest of rare items happens between players without any external force like the market involved as has also happened to me with a red asylum dress months ago before they were duped into oblivion. I am trying to remember if I have ever received a god-roll fixer from a vendor, I am sure I have but it all blends together after a while. More recently though I have found much more success with players and their vending than with the market not quite sure why. 
---
&gt; im not saying you wont ever find something in a vendor, but you can never expect there to be anything good in machines, Best case scenario is scoring off someone who doesn't know what they have
---
This is literally my point. I can rely on it occurring often enough that I still camp hop constantly and I started doing this way before the big duping scandals of late. To say otherwise is pretty incorrect and I play an unfortunate amount of Fallout76 and like I said I am on the discord so feel I have a finger on the pulse of the economy most days. 
---
Not saying if you are looking for a god-roll fixer or BiS you will find something via hopping within a week and you shouldn't check, but the point of external markets like the discord is to fill that void and is a feature that needs to be introduced into the game asap. For example I couldn't sell ultracite reactive plates in-game in my vendor, I had to find someone on the market discord because I knew the rarity but not many others in-game did.
---
Just hide in a bush for as long as you can and go do laundry or something, coming back periodically.  
---
It's not 15 minutes in one go, it's just total.  
---
That said, I don't blame you for not doing it: I'm not and I have the gear and perks to make hiding easier for me. I just don't enjoy Nuclear Winter.
---
It‚Äôs not that hard, unless pvp is out of the realm of possibility for you
---
&gt; "HOLY SHIT HERE COMES AN S!"
---
we need that punctuation tho
---
Until they fix annoying shit like the fast travel bug, wall racks clipping through walls or any of the hundred other bugs that still fucking persist I couldn't give two shits what the PTS does.
---
‚ÄúRemember now, only to the knees!‚Äù
---
It doesn't have to be continuous. You could survive for one minute 15 times.
---
Put it this way, for all the stories you see on reddit about being attacked while in workshops, in the 500+ hours ive played, ive only had 4 fights in workshops.
---
2 were where someone started capturing and the other player was there, so forced pvp occurred.
---
1 was a guy showed up and started shooting a few shots to see if I wanted to fight, and left when it was clear I wasnt interested.
---
The last was where I turned up to claim one at the exact same time someone else did. We had an epic 30 min back and forth fight. We were both lv200+ and were only capturing it for a mission anyway.
---
Creepy and entertaining, I like it.
---
I was thinking 5 per perk aswell,stop being so stingy with everything Bethesda!
---
How? How are they fascist in Fallout 4? Enlighten us.   
---
From where I was sitting they were saving the entire world from what I could call a true fascist threat (the institute) that was literally filling the wasteland with FEV byproducts and killing/replacing/manipulating entire populations of people.
---
Thanks! It doesn‚Äôt bother me per se, but I just couldn‚Äôt figure out what it was connected to if anything.
---
I'm level 294 and still got 39 queued level-ups :D
---
Yeah I wouldn't worry. There's always a fuckup where Beth is concerned.
---
Bruh, scamming isnt that common. and when someone does actually get scammed, they scream about it forever. 
---
And youll just end up getting ripped off by a duper with gifts buying everything out and you hit max caps anyway. Trade only does not have that problem at all.
---
Nice. I‚Äôm not super interested in pvp especially at this point in the game (im like level 15 or something) so hearing that makes this even better. I‚Äôll definetly hav to check one out tonight.
---
I take it they removed that info because they are making big changes before implementation?
---
I explained what was posted prior. Don't worry about me or how I play. You never got ripped off? Fantastic. Some people have. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
yeah Im gonna do that.
---
See I thought that way for awhile with my Responder character, until I thought about the scorched. I realized that the brotherhood could be the best way to take down the scorched, with their technology and armor killing them would be a breeze. The reason they failed last time was because they had lost their communication and their leadership had an entirely different ideology, if anything they will hopefully make the area safer for settlers to come into.
---
Be careful if you get close to Huntersville, there are the areas people nuke for the Colossus is over there.
---
Just learn how trades actually work and you wont get scammed, Its not hard. people are just lazy and intimidated by the big scary market.
---
You'd think there was a daily SCORE challenge for complaining on reddit about the Nuclear Winter challenges...
---
Remains to be seen if they're still part of the original BOS ideals as per Maxson or have splintered off to become their own chapter with their own ideas.
---
In terms of the Fallout lore, Maxson remained as leader until 2135 before he died of cancer, he was replaced by his son (referred to as Maxson II) and it was at that point the BOS started to lean towards the more closed off attitude to outsiders we see in the original Fallout, though the elder at that point, John Maxson, didn't appear to be entirely on board with this position and he doesn't see eye to eye with the other elders.
---
Based on the little seen of them in Fallout 2 and what's mentioned in Fallout 3 &amp; NV, it appears the Fascism slant they've developed largely occurred between the 2 games. (Basically they got into a war with the NCR and while initially having the upper hand, they got hammered in the end due to sheer numbers) This should mean the BOS in Appalachia should, in theory at least, still be a relatively rational bunch following the ideals of the original Maxson.
---
Ok if it's cumulative it's definitely doable and I will admit I was wrong for complaining. I thought it was in one-go and even to the best of my bush hiding abilities it was sretching it.
---
Ooh. Good idea
---
I believe you'll continue being disappointed. Unfortunately due to the online nature of the game, there is no way Bethesda can let people kill the Brotherhood at their base sololy because that will break the game for everyone else. I can't 100% say it won't be like with the raiders and settlers but it is going to be just like them.
---
I hear it‚Äôs 1k damage. But on a side note. Whatever they did to the servers since battle pass came out I‚Äôve noticed that almost every server I join on Xbox already had nukes dropped. So I go down and I‚Äôll find loot from the legendaries or enemies down there. Tonight there must‚Äôve been two set off. So I go down there and see all the meat caps and plans and I got a 3 star vanguard scout armor. I‚Äôve found a drop at son of Danes building before and mind you i wasn‚Äôt in this server when they fought these legendaries. It‚Äôs so weird but it‚Äôs also cool to find stuff like that.
---
Working on it.  Not all shotgun cards yet.  I dont follow the "meta" not worth focusing on a strict  "Build" for one end game boss imo
---
 cactus works well
---
No :)
---
Ivwas attempting that help. Lol
---
chew on this idea for a second and see how it tastes; it's not about factions, it's about rewards.
---
 bonus high SCORE weekend ‚Äì double dailies, bonus challenge week, etc. i don't care for the bos, but i want the goodies, as do others. that's why we do it, rewards.
---
I stand corrected, my bad.
---
Thank for the help everyone!
---
Pretty much every location outside of the forest....... The fact that you only know 4 means you havnt been playing the game long. Do the main quests it will guide you to alot of nice locations to grind legendaries.
---
If it was like wow and we more end game type fights maybe then I'd focus on a strict build
---
&gt; 100% chance of some game breaking bugs to occur, and probably a duplication exploit. Too much can go wrong even if it brings good features.
---
Not if it was built off of readonly APIs, which would be the way to do it .....
---
I don't care man. I was just explaining what the other dude was saying. Seriously, it's a non-issue to me. I trade with a very small group of friends so I know who is who. It makes no difference where the caps come from if I make a sale through my vendor.
---
Man that would have been hectic. I went through at 114, full Ultracite PA with a 3 star gatling Plasma.
---
yeah it's almost like making people play a gamemode they don't like makes people complain
---
pretty weird i know
---
Plans are an odd one, because you can only learn a plan once. So most high level players already know them, and arent therefore interested in buying them. Any they dont know are either very rare, or something they dont really value much - e.g. a slightly different metal box.
---
New players dont know them (so are more willing to buy), however theres's plenty of high level players selling all their unneeded duplicates for 20/50/100 
---
Pricing really is something you get a feel for, and does depend how fast you want something to sell.
---
(Chuckles in bass)
---
No worries, you're allowed to vent your frustration. The "survive in the fire for 1 minute" was in a single attempt and that was just a pain.  
---
If this was in a single go it'd be unreasonable 'cause most matches start to end around the 15 minute mark.  
---
I think my longest has been like 20 minutes, so it wouldn't exactly be fair.
---
I have a couple of great 2\* Fixers but lately I've been trying without success to get a 3\*. I haven't even got a bad 3\* Fixer...
---
I agree the Responders should of been the first choice but we know why it was BoS, because of Fan service.  
---
BoS should be treated as a failed experiment in Appalachia. I roleplay as a Brotherhood survivor and even my character kind of accepts the huge flaws of the Brotherhood but he continues more because of an idea than anything else.  
---
The Brotherhood has awesome traits. It's a large family, they honestly care about each other and in their own way they care about the world even if they don't go about it the wrong way. They tend to take the burdens of the world onto their own shoulders and it slowly eats away at them.  
---
 A faction of good people, who're are well meaning but bogged down by ideology and a sense of duty. When it comes to the Brotherhood I really relate to Veronica in terms of just wanting to them adopt their true potential of really helping the Wasteland. Something they're close to in Fallout 4 with the only thing they seem to be missing is the compassion and the HEART.  
---
In saying that though, the Responders make more sense. Have settlers and such join up and start recruiting. Make Flatwoods a playerhub and a centre for social life. Make it so they start in Flatwoods but the event is getting them ready to take back Morganville where they can then crush the Raiders at the Crater. Since I believe the Raiders need to be decentralised anyway.
---
This is good example of why everyone died before 76 ever opened.
---
What?! I want it
---
im not worried about what you do. but if you think there are that many scammers, you are simply misinformed.
---
That‚Äôs how I prefer pvp but not pve pvp should have a damage cap in these type of games but not pve
---
This made the think of a new idea. New feature of the collectron lists all unknown plans or optionally items not collected.
---
an actual exit should definitely be worth more than a legacy.
---
Ill be on in about an hour psn egroegy
---
I am very eager to know what weapon/armor dropped from this exotic creature.
---
It depends on the item. I usually price my plans around 10 caps each, except for power armor which is higher and some armor mods. Recipes I generally put at 5 or 1. Just throw away any mole miner gauntlet or Mr. Handy buzzblade plans you get as they are worthless.
---
Ok. I‚Äôll just have to pay a little more attention to what people are pricing things in there camps in the future. Rn I hav a bunch of dupes listed at the Bethesda given price. I‚Äôll prolly drop those tho
---
I'd almost prefer it to be by region.  Know it don't work w the storm and a that.. but a map of the forest, a map of thr mire, the bog, etc.  Include all the structures already there...
---
i have a wwr weightless chest 3 star after like 4 rolls
---
You could change their crafting recipe to require flux, that way it's still possible to craft but it's more of a nuisance than regular ammo.
---
Also it would require you to drop a regular nuke to gain access to the materials to craft a mini nuke. The irony would be nice.
---
don't think plastic is all you get from golf balls
---
Then you clearly dont know anything about the bigger markets. Stop whining about scammers, you dont know what you are talking about. Also let the other person explain what they think, they dont need YOU to talk for them.
---
yeah the survive one minute in the fire yesterday is what made me worry, i like you and thank you for being reasonable
---
I had some guy call it scrib.drove me nuts like a pirate's girlfriend
---
But doctor, I *have* T-65!
---
Okay, too much of a stretch. But it's not normally this weak, post-nerf?
---
Will do. Seeing this I definitely need to reprice
---
Any game that is polarizing tends to have this sort of weird group of  people left playing it that either feel the need to prove how much they like their game no matter what and the developers deserve praise for anything they do, and everybody else is wrong and that it's not that bad.
---
It's probably no coincidence that it tends to occur a lot on games where reception isn't too warm, and the audience is smaller than alternatives.  Even Red Dead Online has the same problem, except with Red Dead Online, there aren't really any developers out there pretending they care about what people say which is something you can at least say 76 has with our community managers handing out the usual canned response.
---
I just find it mind boggling that some people seem averse to the purpose of feedback and criticism on a game that is supposed to grow with feedback.
---
Raider PA is available at level 15, and radiation should really be a non-issue for the SBQ unless someone drops the nuke in a stupid place. Grenades, Molotovs, and mines are plentiful and can be used in OVN for splash damage. And the god roll geared people one-shotting things is a problem that even I at 200+ experience. That's a problem with assholes, not game mechanics, and level adjusting enemies isn't going to improve or worsen that.
---
Fair enough, but how good are the rewards for grinding ATLAS? Any mounted animal head plans? :)

Same I never rp my character to like something like they represent. Hell I don‚Äôt like the settlers as being outsiders. It‚Äôs our land that we inherited after the others died off and got ran off. I‚Äôm more for the enclave then anyone just because all the human officers are vaulters
---
You or maybe someone else has been building ammo machines in your camp hahah 
---
Moving camps sometimes works but there is still a good chance it won't. Bethesda will patch the glitch at some point but it doesn't seem like it will be soon.
---
Did you rename it?
---
Inadvertantly gotten rid of a chassis it happened to be on?
---
It's a video game, no one's "making" you do anything. You can complete the season in time without ever doing the Nuclear Winter challenges, or you can do the repeatable XP challenge three times instead.
---
Probably more that didn't want anyone to see the mess those forums were in. The amount of revisions and corresponding backlash was frightening.
---
They're likely resetting them for the next wave of PTS.
---
***Please pay $179.99 per annum to exit the simulation***
---
That radrat, if your hand is quick enough, works too.
---
Is it normal for the AoE to take minutes to kill a 20 HP enemy tho?
---
No :( I only have 2 chassis and always kept the father winter helm in my stash :( never renamed it because I never kept it on me ugh
---
That I agree with, the Brotherhood fought for ages. Throwing men and resources away to keep them back. The survival of the other factions were so reliant on the Brotherhood was it took like what? a year or two after they collapsed for the rest of the area to become overrun?  
---
But their main fault at the same time is Paladin Taggerdy complete resistance to working with civilians. If she worked on better relationships with the Responders and the Free States then they could of pooled resources and together they all had technology and solutions on how to deal with the Scorched. I mean fuck the Responders literally have a inoculation that was ready to go, if more time and resources they could of found it far easier to fight against the Scorched.  
---
Like sure, the Responders and the Free States didn't really understand the Scorched threat but at the same time the Brotherhood could have you know... brought some of them to Watoga to see the danger surrounding that area for themselves.
---
World of Warcraft did/does something similar and either it's easy or they make it look easy.
---
From my understanding is everything is mostly client side? So the boss is at 100% and each shot from-to level 10 does 2% while a shot from-to a level 100 does 5%. If I remember correctly.
---
Hopefully they're taking a page from them...though I'm concerned.
---
Smashy smashy!
---
And LoP rewards cap at level 10 currently which is why it was great for noobs.  This new mechanic just spreads the assholes around more.
---
I feel like one of the biggest problems with this game's playerbase is that people want to be able to complete everything within a relatively short time span. In this Legendary Run season alone I've gone from Level 450 to 500. I feel like there needs to be some kind of long-term progression or thing to work towards because people are always complaining that there's not enough content and that there is nothing to do and that they're bored. Legendary perks, although they are not what immediately come to mind when we talk about new content, *are* something you can gradually work towards until you have all 6 maxed out. 
---
This is just my opinion...
---
I'm going to nuke their headquarters every day after they drop.
---
Kick the POS BOS asses back to Cali.
---
It‚Äôs actually been like that for awhile now, it was like that before the ammo glitch. I just never did anything about it.
---
Me too. I've been back for a while after leaving the game for over a year (without a reddit post to mark that departure) and I'm having a blast with some of my best friends. Best way to have fun while cooped up I know of
---
Nope, I used to enjoy picking the lock at where you turn in tech data, and hearing the radroaches immediately die.
---
The AoE is worthless as it stands right now
---
Fuck the Brotherhood.üñïüèª

It is intelligent yes and seem to have some semblance and sentience. I don't consider them because they can do nothing without Human assistance

Albeit, functionality and easy of use is abit questionable, but every item and location in almost every regard is (post apocalyptic/Fallout) themed. If they hand that kind of choice over to the player base, going on player built expeditions becomes... "Welcome to my Super Mario / Pulp Fiction / Game of Thrones Town!!!"... ......yeah, no
---
I only started playing a few weeks ago and I knew from the start that I was behind and I was going to have to do a lot of work or spend a lot of atoms to catch up and I don't mind that.
---
The issue was I thought the 15 mins was in one-go like some other recent challenges and considered it unreasonable considering I've came in second place several times by just hiding in bushes and barely scratched 15 mins. I've since learned that the 15 minute survival is cumulative and I am ok with it so I hope we can all go on with our lives.
---
Except for purging the former occupants that is
---
Agreed. The display system at best is barely functional. A real pass at it with some tweaking is sorely needed to enable people to be more creative. I dont know how many display cases I see filled up with the same 12 bears/gnomes.
---
I was thinking about switching myself except I currently have a rifle build so it would be a large overhaul.  My shotguns seem to do more damage without any perks than my rifles.  I can one shot most things in vats with my shotguns
---
So I agree with some of these points but on others I really don‚Äôt. This community absolutely is not overly positive, I see a lot more negative posts than I do positive (remember that time when Fasnacht got DELAYED- not deleted- and literally everyone made posts about deleting their FO1st memberships?) The only people who think cheating is ok are the cheaters themselves or people who are too stupid to read TOS.
---
Perk coins rewarded for scrapping perks need to be 5 at least , you guys need to stop trying to make everything an unbelievable grindüòê
---
I guess we're both Pagliacci in this case.  
---
Oh no, it's been exactly like this since Wastelanders dropped. To the point I was pretty sure the radius did zero damage, but you're saying it does and I haven't been willing to put in the time to check.  
---
Prior to Wastelanders, it was viable for killing low level enemies and stinging high level ones enough to conserve some ammo. I'd usually hammer something to around 10-15% in a burst and let the dots do the rest.   
---
Now? Nah, I might as well fire the extra .50 and save the time.
---
I just want to donate vast amounts of drugs and raw meat to the cult of the mothman .
---
Or check the daily/weekly challenges while you're away from the game. . .
---
The limits are so people log in daily, thus increasing the chance you buy atoms or fallout 1st.
---
If you want the limit increased or removed. You'd have to convince a almost all players on all 3 platforms to stop the legendary weapons grind so the limits have no effect. I've met in my time 5 people who have spent over ¬£1k (all together) in real money solely to gear multiple characters with different weapons and armours. So you have quite the task.
---
German?
---
You're quite welcome.   
---
It's been a pleasure interacting with you, I just try to help where I can.
---
Looks uhhhh okkk I guess?
---
Its been a problem forever for me personally on PC. If I run into a server that this happens on consistently or for longer than a couple of minutes after loading in, I immediately disconnect as it seems highly dependent on the server and you may have just gotten unlucky. 
---
Shotguns are extra buggy lately with patch 21 so you may want to consider switching your primary/weapon and build.
---
Is it too hard or what? Just find a good Bush. Most other people are just hiding also.
---
I started rolling for my Secret Service armor. Loooooots of legendaries to scrap for scrip, I can't turn them all in.
---
True but they still haven't fixed some of the easy bugs.....
---
But no lead paint fumes from the toys...... sad noises
---
I would be sadly disappointed if it's not a Nocturnal Rolling Pin
---
That's not great. I definitely have all the cards that help with shotguns. I got a 3* shotgun and was super excited to use it. Then this happened.
---
I'm gonna be hunting bos with stealth suit and bow
---
Awww you guys ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
I actually agree with your middle ground idea. Some areas should have minimum/maximum caps to their leveling scale to both prevent abuse by higher level characters (forest, ash heap, and toxic valley have a ton of events going on while the higher level areas have a lower density of events) and to keep the notion that you should not be in certain places at starting levels.
---
To address your request for clarification, I have 5 characters with the lowest being level 87. My max level and main is 288, and he's also the newest character I made. Made him during the Christmas Scorched event last year after a 7 month break from the game. Never tried starting a new character with an unyielding set myself, but I imagine that would speed things up nicely. I can give you some pointers on leveling faster, though.
---
For starters, intelligence is key. Get as much as you can however you can. I put Intelligence at 5 as an absolute minimum on any character just so I can mod anything I need. I keep my characters as self sufficient as possible so I don't use mules or friends for that. But more intelligence is always good.
---
Always be well rested, and try to find recipes for intelligence and experience boosting food. Simple brain fungus soup is +intel and brain fungus is everywhere. There's the Feed the People event. I know it sucks but 5 cans of 5% bonus xp. If you dast travel to someone's camp in the cranberry bog, diseased cranberries are everywhere and require very little risk to gather. Makes cranberry juice for an extra 2% xp if you don't have stew. You can find recipes for Tasty Squirrel Stew and Cranberry Relish as random drops in kitchens around the world, and I think you can buy the recipe for Cranberry Relish from the Whitesprings Gourmet, but that one is pretty hard to pull off at low levels unless you don't mind dying a few times. You'll need clean cranberries that you'll only find in certain  locations in the bog, like the sundew groves, or Mac's farm that's south of the General's Steakhouse. And with public teams, join Building teams for a max of +4 intel which is over 10% more xp. 
---
I know people tend to be dicks with low levels joining public teams, sadly, and I think it's because most low level characters don't have mutations yet. All my chars are mutated, and I run Strange in Numbers which gives a big boost to your character. It sounds shitty, because it is, but if I'm not getting my Strange in Numbers boost, I might as well just be solo. So get yourself mutated ASAP! Go to the river outside Flatwoods and gather dirty water until you mutate. Then run around Flatwoods and milk the brahmin. Brahmin milk cures 25 rads with no loss of mutations. Use those to manage rads until you can get Starched Genes. If a level 3 joins my building team and I'm getting my Strange in Numbers boost, I'm a happy murder hobo. 
---
Sorry for the novel :|
---
Huh, Fo76 has been one of the games with the most content I have played so far, it lasted me a month and half of casual playing, I already reached level 100. Only problem is that the content is barely repeatable except for NW, that's where Expeditions might save the game. I would like it to be a separate game mode with short 15-mins matches, queued other 6 different unique dwellers to go raid a vault, settlement or whatever. Something quick like Overwatch (OW 2 more specifically) or SSB. 
---
Runescape has the most tedious grind out there, literally click and watch the same animation for weeks, and the game is still pulling profit, Gtav also has a very bad grind and so does rdo, they are literally the same thing: Go here, aimbot x amount of guys, return, repeat. At least Runescape offered a bunch of totally different activities with different chill vibes (from just fishing to dungeoneering where all your skill levels matter separately), that's what these console games are missing so far. Red dead online has great side activities like fishing, but they are not yet being exploited. Same for Fo76 in a lot of things, but it's just giving them time.
---
And well to each their own, I rather reward loyal players if I owned a game. Is not an "unhealthy" obsession if the person genuinely enjoys it, It is free time that they must spend on something they like to do to stay alive or something
---
IM hoping more along the lines of Models, buffs, mods, and effects. If they BOS comes back and the only Power Armor tech they bring back is a new paint job... then It would make alot more sense how the scorch could have handed them thier asses.
---
I'm with you. While the meta also isn't of interest to me with the provisions rewards crappy and the overall rewards I don't want or care about (because I finished the legendary run this week), but the BoS is a faction my character wouldn't help so I agree with that point.
---
alive or dead? ü§î
---
Y'all are thinking too little.
---
Why not come out with maps of different areas nobody knows of?  Think about if they made maps from other Vaults that've never been explored. You could literally create huge areas, tight corridors, parts that go into caves, parts that may be flooded or have little light due to power outtages.  
---
Hell, give us the option to play either 76 maps or large player created "settlements".  Not sure if anyone played the multi-player in Farcry 5, but it could somewhat be the same idea.
---
Likewise, I appreciate you! Ad Victoriam!
---
I would go quite well with the mad scientist and doctor role play as well.
---
One of the friendly beasts in project paradise spawned 3 star once.  Was livid as I had enormous issues finding legendaries that day.  On the plus it restored its health after it got banged into a corner too hard.
---
Considering Fasnacht Confetti exists, it wouldn‚Äôt be asking too much for blood splatter puddles.
---
Well I'm not going to say different. But you still going to be waiting a long time. If what you've been claiming is true. You have to understand the majority of people with this issue have it because they've blueprinted and been making ammo machines.
---
It most likely won't be till that exploit is fix or the new camp system is added. Fingers crossed that will be soon.
---
Now that's a creature that should have its own cult. All hail the Legendary Chicken!!
---
I know it sucks the big one. I went shotguns on patch 19 and had to stop and rebuild to heavy guns as they were basically nonfunctional. They may receive attention soon, but of all weapons flamers/powerfist/shotguns are in shit shape atm and seem to trigger this the most.
---
I recently got a BSS+1S golf club. It needs a better sound, they should sample the sound of a driver sending a ball into orbit. Whoever sampled the "Clang!" of a shovel bashing a tiny woodlands creature deserves an award.
---
You just use concentrated fire and sneak and shoot the ghouls in the head... not hard.
---
Who is "They"? I'm talking to you, and you are crying about people killing legendaries.  I am here suggesting to you... rather than be butthurt and cry, go to the burrows and get 5-10x more legendaries per hour than doing one violent night.  I assumed nothing about you or anyone, and I literally told you where to go.
---
there you are playing the PvE in your post apocalyptic shooter and all of the sudden you're a Nazi. You didn't ask for this, you didn't choose this, yet there it is.
---
When ever I use my gauss shorty I will hit something take a chunk off then see the health bar go back up (not using the shotty anymore)
---
Oof, hate to hear it. Thanks for confirmation.
---
How do you know what is easy? Sometimes what seems like a small change creates bigger problems in other parts of the code. 
---
Typically when prioritizing bug fixes or enhancements to a product you look at a 2x2 matrix of impact vs investment. Low investment high impact items should take priority, then low low, and finally high impact high investment. You generally will never work on low impact high investment items.
---
Best I've gotten so far is Vanguard Sneak Ap SS Chest, the end game is a grind for sure.
---
I will try that!
---
Stealth  vats automatic rifle builds are hands down the best that‚Äôs what I run and I basically one hit everything
---
We totally hit the concrete goal. Please just ignore the fact that it was literally 1 concrete scrap over the goal. Nothing suspicious at all about meeting the goal by the bare minimum. Nothing suspicious at all. Right Bethesda?
---
Nice book reference
---
Nah I'm good
---
Yeah I have also experienced this, only a minor inconvenience tho. Imagine if it did hinder score progression
---
I hope you‚Äôre not trying to get photos so you can scam someone.
---
A community manager recently confirmed its something the team is working on for a future patch so that‚Äôs old info you got.
---
Mamazing!
---
I always get that when I've popped a radaway recently
---
Most of the people who deny the existence of a bug till they encounter it aren't being overly positive. They're just not willing to simply take the word of one (or a few) people that something happened when there's no proof.
---
I mean early on this game had so many people hating on it who had never played it, and it still has some people like that... You just sort of had to assume that if people are willing to spend so much of their time smearing the game on Facebook and in other sections of reddit what's stopping them from making fake bug reports here, knowing they'd just get lumped in with all the real bugs. It sort of made me question every bug that bug that wasn't widely reported or didn't happen to me or someone I know is legit. We even had YouTubers reporting on bugs that turned out to be fake IIRC.
---
The problem hasn't been lack of criticism, it's been Bethesda not doing enough with the criticism. Maybe they can't tell what bug reports are bullshit though either (Joking, sort of).
---
Honestly (pc here) I've been having the opposite.  I use PA religiously in my Junkie Heavy Tank.  
---
Since wastelanders up to about a week ago, I was eating so many rads when before I'd been mostly okay on my own.  Radshield was barely necessary if I was wearing "better" armor, and all of a sudden I'm sucking em down.  For now it seems to be back to normal.
---
Oh no of course not I just want to hate my shite luck
---
Then you likely have it! Congrats, my friend!
---
Also - you... wouldn‚Äôt happen to be on PC and happen to have to have some spare cave fungus, would you? I‚Äôve been looking for some myself to learn the recipe.
---
Nothin' like a little grace and civility to brighten up the day, eh?
---
I'm hoping for season 2 to be mothman themed as if memory serves , september is when point pleasant holds their mothman festival.
---
Oh yeah, it's a shame. I love that suit too, it was pretty much my driving goal for the first three months of this year, so to see it collecting dust just stings a bit.
---
Plus it's just really cool looking.
---
I'm hoping in the long run they'll tune it up, and maybe give a means to bring its stats back in line with the like of the T-65 and whatever the Brotherhood brings.
---
I would be happy with ANY skin for the fixer. I can't count how many times I've almost accidently sold it to the script machine.
---
I had a massive pile just on the floor of my penthouse in ten penny tower back in fo3. It was greatness
---
Bad connection; the server is basically not registering that you are hitting the enemy. It's not just shotguns either, I get this effect when I'm sniping something or with melee.
---
We did have an age survey here a while back, average age was like 37 iirc, well above the fortnite crowd. We had a surprising number of players above age 50, some into their 70s.
---
Yep, this happened to me just a day or two ago. The health buff was nice.
---
It was an Assassin's Pump Action
---
Assassin's Pump action
---
I wish it were easier to set more things on shelves and tables in general. I don‚Äôt even bother with display cases and the like anymore. Just pointless and same-y.
---
When the game was first announced I thought there would be clans that could set up their own group stores and be their own ‚Äúfaction‚Äù be fun if you could set quests and rewards for other players to get ‚Äúrep‚Äù in exchange for specific resources to get discounts at your shop, this would also encourage fewer but bigger clans
---
Nazi never nuked anything that I recall.
---
there are 2 characters trying to rebuild the responders, theres a decent chance some kinda smaller scale resurgance happens
---
If you want to sell that bloodied fixer I would def buy it!
---
Nazi‚Äôs never dropped nukes... Americans did
---
No one WANTS to be in the enclave or be a general for them... but the resources and security of the bunker is very hard to pass up in this apocalyptic world
---
looks sexy
---
Modules and vault steel just shouldn't have limits other than your scrip.
---
I fail to see a reason to limit them to anything else, especially when server hopping gives you a fresh pool. Getting passable rolls on Vault 94 armor is enough of a nightmare as it is, adding extra steps to slow down an already *epic* process...why? How many years is it supposed to take?
---
That is interesting I did not know that. If [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a902y6/demographics_poll_what_system_do_you_play_on_and/) is the one you mean then unfortunately I can't imagine its at all accurate.
---
Agro with a friend and just stand right beside them and ask how it feels
---
Marcurio.
---
Oh, wait--
---
Only because BoS wouldn't even talk about the Scorched with the other groups and made the existence of Scorchbeasts *classified*.
---
Then they started holding farmers up at gunpoint demanding all their food...
---
ive hopped to thousands of camp, i know what people put in their machines, and 98% of the time it isnt worth the caps i spent to travel. using an external market is so much more efficient for even mundane trading. 
---
maybe you get lucky with camps, but most people dont, and thats why you constantly see people complain about what people have in their machines. people who dont really understand the games broader economy end up wasting peoples time.
---
Beserkers needs a buff hard. For the risk involved it should be on par with junkies if not bloodied. I run a beserkers junkie hybrid and with the exact same weapon (obviously different prefix's) she creams the bog and mire as junkies but goes down like a 2 bob ho when she runs her beserkers weapons. 
---
Stalkers should be limited to ranged weapons only. Suppressors should be limited to melee weapons only.
---
Nocturnal just needs to leave the party.
---
Only when I can drag it into Vault 51.
---
There is a positivity overload by some people as a direct consequence of the negativity at times, i gurantee you there would be less if people stopped dogpiling bethesda over shit other devs always get away with...or start holding them accountable too.
---
Wow. Someone has anger issues. 
---
I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre the kind of one shotter I was complaining about hence your rather volatile response. 
---
Calm down, champ. You‚Äôll do yourself an injury.
---
?
---
I'll be interested to see how tough it'll actually make some of the higher level creatures for me. Right now I shred max level glowing deathclaws like they're nothing. If it's just more of that around the whole map then helping low levels will still be no problem. If it's going to make every fight into what they were when I was level 25 (which IMO was tougher than the lower level fights)... Lol yeah nobody is going to be helping anyone because everyone will have their hands full. Guess we'll see how it goes.
---
I done that during fachnat or however it's spelled.
---
U can't
---
Yes!!!! These guys are the best.  Just launched one and as always they were there for me!
---
