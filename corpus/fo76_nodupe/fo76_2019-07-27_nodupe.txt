If Bethesda didn't want you to get inside other people camps, there would not be a lockpick perk. 
---

---
My raider sometimes lockpicks his way into a bed to take a nap. This is the wasteland, dude. You can kill me, but that won't stop me. 
---
Hypocrisy, if you ask me. We force our way into any building but oh, no, my bedroom is holy grounds!
---
---
---
No im to aggressive of a pvp player to camp in a bush for those XP. Most rounds end up me having arround 8 to 12 kills, being in the top 15 but then getting one shot with a grenade. Like I said somewhere else, I'm Overseer rank 78. No reason to be cocky like you are. Espicially if you don't know shit.
---
See that’s why I’m so hesitant to do it. I either wanna go all in or not at all. I feel like if I went half way in I would just be getting killed by every rad roach that comes my way.
---
If you pass the luck skill check, she isn't anywhere near as annoying, if you don't she doesn't get cured properly!

I actually am, he's just not really friendly.

My friend, this post was something I wanted to make a month or so ago. I'm on PS4, and back then, I went AFK to come back and find like 3-4 people sitting all around my Red Rocket diner, just talking about it. I couldn't help but contain my excitement as I went around and gave them fresh made foods.
---
I'd love to see yours, but it sounds like you're on Xbox.
---
There’s diminishing returns on DR but troubleshooters gives a flat reduction in damage.
---
aaaaaahahah
---
Becket is a lazy bum who only sells booze to his landlord!
---
Probably because it was in the forest, a lot of people think only low levels build there
---
Yeah i was a bloodied melee build and now am a bloodied PA heavy gunner. I definitely prefer it this way.
---
Turning the game off
---
Do you have the protected and resistant mods learned? Supposedly it doesn't drop sheilded unless you have the lower tiers learned.
---
150% more damage isn't too much?
---
https://youtu.be/RDrmT0mdySI
---
Next season update? What are you even talking about? They’re updating it in patch 21
---
Well Papa Todd said if I don't bring that score points he will shive a mini Nuke inside of me
---
There's a 20min grace period
---
I heard once you invite you can’t keep them out
---
Oh resulting to name calling. Real mature bud
---
I love it.
---
 I run 20% health, melee bloodied build with more points in agility and luck than strength.
---
400 carry space without any buffs or perks.
---
But when it comes to events I pull out my tesla so not to insta-kill the enemies.
---
Thanks to serenity x3 I rarely die! 
---
The enemies usually die before even putting a shot into me, so my armor rarely breaks.
---
What are these mysterious boxes, not sure I’ve heard of them..
---
My Steam version doesn't crash that much.
---
That’s the thing. Evolution doesn’t have to be physical. Most survivors at the time of 76 lived before the war.
---
In 4’s Commonwealth, most survivors, except for one, have never even dreamed of clean sheets, running water, and a life free from fear of your neighbor (aside from communist paranoia)
---
i get annoyed when people pester me when in concentrating on my crafting and organizing. ill leave door open till someone is an ass. otherwise ,come in,have a drink. don't kill my bessy.
---
They’re making it so all perk cards give the same amount because some people were complaining about “scrapping their animated collection” or something stupid
---
I'd like just some wooden steps. Unlike the ones that are a piece of foundation for flooring. Like a 4-5 step set of stairs that one would use to enter a house. A winding staircase would be extremely nice also.
---
Try going into first and out see if recovered mine did
---
Np ;) remember it took awhile for me definitely worth it though
---
Revenge of the bush Wookiee! To be honest I only do that on criter hunts because I find I run into more critters solo, and the camp challenge that I also do solo because I find it annoying when the guy with me pops his camp then runs into the fire.
---
granted today’s was annoying because More than one match they grabbed Stims , ran into and out of the fire then out stimed then ran into the fire.
---
FYI I bought my first PC in 1982. I spent 25 years In IT as a DBA and Systems analyst.  My first game system was an Atari.  I am by no means a newbie. This game has done some weird shit to me. My luck cards sorted alphabetical are scrounger serendipity storm chased. It is not in use either. I don't know how to attach a photo but I have one I understand how to sort the perk cards by categories or point value. I think I am also missing other cards. Isn't there one called tank killer I don't have that one eithee
---
A don't agree with you, I won't agree with you. Move on. Better yet, blocked.
---
They are not too bad to keep alive. With emergency protocols in power armor your really tanky, poison is really annoying though.
---
Nobody has an excuse. You can oneshoot those bastards with almost any weapon and build in the game.
---
I use my critter gun to tag them, while I fix those extractors. But if you take too long, I will start killing them just because I like order being restored.
---
I never found any solid up to date answers for the third box.
---
used to be huge communities, but that has since died down, I've still seen a few bos and enclave RPs tho
---
You would have to get the old ring or wedding ring to complete that quest.
---
Always,  spawn somewhere 1cap + then fast travel back.
---
I say try it!  You're playing a game. Have fun with it and explore. If you don't like it you can level up and change things back.
---
No worries! I thought you were just memeing on me.
---
It’s a different kind of bar than I expected.
---
Why do you comment on almost every question post with 'IDK'? I've seen you post these comments on like 3+ posts
---
That kinda sucks but still, I'll look for them.
---
Did you do the main quest? You get plans during the main quest I’m pretty sure.
---
noice.
---
This game really is rather pretty sometimes
---
changes should be in patch 21 which is on PTS. Let us know how the changes look.
---
I started a bloodied build one week into the legendary run and I do not regret it. I’ve had a lot of fun watching the build grow from only one unyeilding piece and a one star bloodied railway rifle, to what it is today with a full armor set and an automatic bloodied combat rifle.
---
Usually one of the first things I build in a new run of Fallout 4 is one of those. I can't understand why it wasn't included in Fallout 76.
---
Looks like the Chinese Stealth Suit
---
Chinese stealth suit
---
We need pics!
---
Lol yes I need your services. Can you please build a safe space
---
Chinese Stealth Armor. You get it by playing the Wastelanders settler questline
---
It’s the Chinese stealth suit. Unlocked by doing a certain mission with foundation. Or you can buy it with gold. I think it’s about 4,000 gold. (I might be wrong on the price)
---
Been playing it so long I can't imagine playing any other way.  It just feels normal. You do get killed now and then though you're more alert generally. You win and you lose.
---
wow, this is unreal.
---
^or ^surreal.
---
Start a new player. Don't die right away. You should get the level.
---
I am a bloodied build as well, but I ran into an issues where if I switch from my unyielding gear to power armor I become overencumbered even if I empty out my whole inventory except the PA. And I have all the less weight perks and high capacity pack. Turned me away from using my fav Mothman armor...just use hazmat suits now. Don't know what I am doing wrong.
---
Congrats friend, I’m still on the grind at around 315 tokens
---
I realized this the other day and man it was so nice to get this done quickly!
---
Oh totally, to be clear, it’s 1 module each piece right?
---
Lol
---
Foreal. I dont even steal anything. I just want to see their camps. I need to see whats behind that locked door
---
True that! I think I will!
---
Always nice to know it gets better thanks!
---
I heard this last week and was confused. I *think* we faked Beckett and his brother’s deaths, so the Blood Eagles don’t come after them - as the dialogue right after mentions his brother is alive and doing stuff with Ronny. But it’s not well explained.
---
wrong sub mate
---
It really is
---
I mean, it's a neat idea, but this isn't that game. Bethesda consistently go for the lowest effort implementation, and adding races to the game would take work Bethesda just isn't capable of. They can't even get a simple Paragon system right (see: the trainwreck that is Legendary Perks), so my confidence in Bethesda being able to implement a proper race system is less than zero.
---
Did you add?
---
saw a guy hiding behind his power armor, using it as bait and then getting the drop on people
---
I figured this all out after he got me
---
For this same reason I crafted a tesla gun that arches enemies.
---
Contrary to what everyone else said it is actually the Chinese stealth suit
---
7 caps
---
Have you people ever told them to please stop?
---
That's why I just initiate a trade and zero everything out
---
I can understand that. When I'm redoing my camp I hop on my private server to stop people getting in the way of me placing objects down, but when its done, come on in. Thats why I built it in the first place
---
Been awhile.amy be a bit more, on the plus thour armourer perk means you use less steel but still 100 plus
---
Thanks for the quick response everybody!
---
And the funny thing is that I’m dying a lot less now than when I had full health. I even tanked all three pylons during Encryptid today while at Nerd Rage health and using the Chinese Stealth Suit, and I didn’t die.
---
This weekend while I was playing a few different people had hot mics and you could hear toddlers in the background or a whole conversation where a dad was getting mad at their son for not washing his hands after entering the house.  It’s pretty interesting... and to think I was going to turn that function off...(I don’t even have a mic lol)
---
you can buy one for about 6k+ i wouldn't pay anymore than 8 tbh
---
We've had this happen before.
---
After each Fashnacht event, my gf and I would drop the treasure hunter outfits for everyone to have. Every once in awhile we would have one or two people hog every outfit we dropped. It was annoying.
---
different trappers but exact same gear lol
---
I roleplay a mothman cultist heavy and have a lot of brothers and sisters who come to my house to pray to our holy mothman on a daily basis. Located at Point Pleasant, WV at the entrance to the Mothman Museum. Sadly I do not see a lot of people roleplaying factions like they used to however.
---
Ok that’s wild I can’t even do that full HP
---
You can usually buy them off players for around 10k on the Xbox LFG or the market sub
---
Cant link it for reasons, but if you check my post history you'll see the sub
---
What sub then?
---
That’s the reason I want it to work! I can’t find people to play with for the life of me ):
---
What I hate the most is, catching a disease without taking a strike or a hit from them.
---
Limb damage, yes its magic.
---
I’ve got some friends, but I feel like I’m intruding when I constantly try to play with them when we’re all online because they’re all super high level players and then there’s me; the noob at level 25 lol
---
&lt;&lt;TL;DR&gt;&gt; fuck yeah go bloodied 
---
people hate on bloodied because they think they're cool or quirky for not following the meta. but it is the meta for a reason. 
---
I am completely spec'd for a bloodied build, I have everything and anything that can make a bloodied build good, nerd rage, adrenal reaction etc. surprisingly there's not that many perks you'll find yourself needing if you want to be a bloodied build, it's more about the gear you have than the perks you have.
---
obviously [nerd rage] any level is a must, most people max it out though, I use [iron clad] level 5 to give me a hell of a lot more resistance, [serendipity] max level is an absolute must. I cant think of anymore perks off the top of my head at the moment. 
---
     
---
also with bloodied as long as you have a full set of unyielding or bolstering (you can actually mix and match a few pieces for a more generalist build) {positive you know how the legendary prefix's work}
---
full set of bolstering makes you an almost unkillable tank with ironclad, unyielding is widely regarded as better though, since it provides a lot more carry weight, xp gain, vats hit chance, more AP, ykno the works. 
---
for damage output it is absolutely insane, whatever weapon class you're spec'd into you, if you are, for example a rifleman, finding a Bloodied Faster Fire Rate lever action would no doubt one shot everything in the game (obvious exceptions) heavy guns? a bloodied, even 1 star minigun will shred everything in its path. you will not get better damage output than bloodied at the moment. though a lot of mouth breathers are calling for a rework/nerf to bloodied, I think they should just buff other prefixes, (I wish mutants was worth it), anyway. 
---
with the right build and gear, you will find yourself almost never dying, and you will also be doing the most damage output in the game.
---
edit: ah yes read another comment and figured I should state it, bloody mess, fireproof, blocker, starched genes, class freak. figured those were pretty universal so I didn't state them but :))
---
[removed]
---
I’m not asking for your resume. And I’m not asking for what you see as **currently available**. 
---
I’m asking for what you see when you go to do a level up and select ‘Pick a Perk’ on the left side of the screen, after you cycle over to Luck. 
---
Here are the possibilities:
---
- Starched Genes is available for you to select in the Pick a Perk screen under the Luck category. 
---
- Starched Genes is not available there, but you have either three rank 1 versions or one rank 1 version and a rank 2 version already in your repertoire. 
---
There are no other possibilities. 
---
Did you look at just your *known perk cards* or did you go into Pick a Perk and look for what’s available in Luck?
---
Lol wtf I guess just downvote n move on
---
I’ve found it in responder vendors
---
I would like a stairwell that connects to the side of a wall and not this block that I am forced to use
---
If you’ve already got a couple of decent weapons, I’d say just try to fill out all of your armor slots with unyielding pieces. 1 star is fine to start.
---
Otherwise, just make sure you get all of the good defensive perks (serendipity, dodgy, blocker, nerd rage, lifegiver (check out Angry Turtle’s video on “crazy health regenerating”)) and you should be good.
---
I’ve got a stealth VATS rifleman that I recently switched over from junkies to bloodied, and I’ve got no regrets. I don’t play all that cautious and I haven’t died in quite a while. My last death was when I accidentally drew aggro from a Whitespring assaultron and didn’t realize it.
---
So what kind of build are you?
---
It was like 20 items it would back us out of it so many times I didn’t want to bother
---
I added a external ssd hard drive installed the game on it every other day or so I’ll still get a blue screen but since the hard drive in my play station isn’t working as hard and my external has no movable parts my game has less issues then before
---
you can get the option to enter quest areas to assist the team leader when in a team, you just dont get the rewards or progession of quests.
---
Well last night went on my friends server and had to go make dinner and after making and having dinner 3 hrs later was still in his server and he logged off, but I dunno if thats normally what happens. Seems like you can stay.
---
Doubles budget and can't be done on half walls
---
Bethesda? Fix their game? With them breaking thinks every patch(currently some perks) when trying to fix things, not even when they try can they fix their own game. 
---
I mean at this point, I don’t even think they are trying fix this game. 
---
They are probably pouring their time into MTX or ways to Nickel and dime us ( fallout 1st, legendary run, ludicrous prices on the atom shop, taking the ability away from us to earn atoms from dailies, etc)
---
Yep I did that with spare masks and plans and some high level would stockpile it, I feel you
---
No thanks. I don’t need any more Mole Miner Gauntlet plans.
---
good luck man 👍
---
Very true also. You make a good point. 
---
Don’t get me wrong cause I like the way you think. But in this particular case I don’t think it has anything to do with the lore so to say. 
---
Now that the old junk walls from 4 have been data mined they kinda show that they’re not at all thinking the same direction as you and me here. 
---
But I totally hear you.
---
I just accidentally wandered into those situations... I joined some public events teams to grind scores during events.  All of these conversations were happening during very tooth and nail events... it’s pretty funny.
---
Works for me!!! Thanks kindly
---
I do this
---
If you kill one while they're in conflict with the settlers or something then you lose rep. I'm pretty sure that's how it works
---
&gt;completed
---
&gt;impossible
---
Huh. That’s weird.
---
I feel like I would have had to mute my mic because I would have just been laughing the whole time
---
I bought one for 5k then got one right after during a event
---
While I agree, if ALL plans &amp; recipes were available, that's a 1000 atom purchase over the usual 500 that I'd gladly make.
---
Nothing at all. You're doing nothing wrong. The bonuses from unyielding are absolutely insane as a bloodied build, but in the confines of this discussion it's better than dying, and the warehouse near v9 with the workbench solves a lot of weight issues.
---
Having said that, mostly I'm all about the improved repair kits from the queen fight and the flux secondary. I will mostly ALWAYS go do a SBQ fight, but when people drop the nuke in places that make in difficult to fight without nuke protection, I do seriously consider not going, as the benefits of my armour are a lot to lose for the sake of that fight and being forced to use nuke gear. 
---
I get the people that don't want the SBQ to die instantly or whatever, but being intentionally selfish in the opposite direction to exclude bloodied or non-PA builds seems a bit overboard when glitched guns and unintended synergy are the main culprits, not bloodied builds. 
---
These are the same people that tend to say "why does my SBQ nuke fail so much?" when they're intentionally trying to fuck over bloodied builds.
---
It's an exploit. Be warned, they take up a lot of budget and can't be removed, so don't accept if some rando sends you a private team invite or asks to build one for you.
---
It should’ve been the standard version really. 
---
Ofc we would still have been asking for other stairs. But this one I would at least be able to build with
---
Cheaters, they are common in 76
---
You’re so popular
---
I'm on pc, my challanged never auto complete. Im never on at reset or log in into private server (I have fo 1st).  
---
Rank 92. 
---
9900k
---
Rx 5700xt
---
Frames unlimited in ini.
---
It's on m2 drive.
---
I only crash to desktop on rare occasions with no errors, game just closes like poof. 
---
Wonder what it is that makes it autocomplete for some.
---
I think the plans might drop from public workshop capture/defend events but I may be mistaken
---
Looks cool
---
I realize 90 is still pretty low level, but I've never: used the excavator after doing the quest to get it, used PA, used over half the weapons, killed the scorch queen, finished the rooftop gutsy fight in the watoga quest line, launched a nuke, chosen a side to break into the vault for the gold yet, joined a public group, done any pvp, or had a companion other than beckett.  
---
but I have almost finished all the possum challenges. and I have gotten the pie, twice.
---
Yep. It's mad annoying.
---
Np didnt want you spending that scrip like I did then finding out you needed it. The real grind is the ultracite plans though XD
---
Soon perk cards will be exchanged for legendary perks
---
I actually lol’d at this out loud.
---
Haha you probably would need to.  The conversation about the washing of the hands had me confused for a while.  I didn’t understand if they were roommates, who was actually playing the game.  It’s possible the two people could have been both playing or one of them was talking to the other one over their shoulder scolding them for not washing their hands lol
---

pretty sure south of 76? unless that's #2
---
It's a mod for PC called IntRaw: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/513/
---
I've found it extremely helpful in my own almost-max-budget CAMP, and I've been thinking about using it to post a list with exact budget percentages for each item type. I also learned through using it that wires actually do consume budget, but it's an extremely small amount.
---
Unfortunately, not really...
---
Yes. I read on another thread here that hoarding notes and holotapes in your inventory and stash can make it worse.
---
Thank you, I’m able to join now I just wanted to make sure it doesn’t affect my quests since I am no where close to doing the raid in my quest line
---
Hey dude, nope its that same annoying 4 8 2000 man... No emails as my account is set up to an old email that ive deleted so i feel like im done. I feel like im the only person whos been rebanned but if i could find somebody else who has and has recieved an email it would help alot. Im watching everyone play 76 and im fukd lol. Will i get unbanned, they dont even answer my tickets.
---
Ah good I thought it wa just me and I was going insane.  Nothing like booking it back to camp before scorched earth to fix my weapons and gear up only to have it screech to a halt.  I’m sitting there mashing buttons multiple times.... YES I want to repair it!!!!!!!!!
---
theres like 4 things i wanted out of all that shit, at 3 now. not gonna bother completing it.
---
So they’d be able to join my team, place one at my camp, and kill the camp’s budget? Does moving camp get rid of it?
---
Seeing as how it is amazingly easy to rank up when low level I disagree.
---
I want MORE
---
This is great thanks so much! This breaks my heart as I traded a bloodied explosive minigun for a TSE gat plas awhile ago. I knew as soon as I did i was gonna regret it. Glad I’ve held onto that unyielding. I appreciate your advice friend
---
I did not know that!  Lately I have actually been collecting my used plans instead of dropping them.  Maybe I’ll just drop them all at a train station soon.
---
Equip one and check your reload speed
---
Public teammates can't build at each other's camps, so you're fine if you use the public teams and don't join private teams with strangers. Moving the camp puts it in storage, but it can't be deleted or placed again out of storage and still eats your budget. 
---
At that point you'll have to submit a ticket to Bethesda and/or wait for them to patch it.
---
Don't worry about lifegiver - no longer provides auto health in the PTS, so will probably come out in patch 21 or 22
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/TawaHFx

Bummer. I saw some posts that bullion and possum badges aren’t showing in the menu right now though so it might just be that (I noticed all my badges were at zero too... and my scrip, though that filled back in again later).
---
I found it on graham on my alt, but I think it’s sold at most common vendors now
---
You can drop them at my camp if you’re just gonna throw them down haha. Or sell them! I know it’s the first thing I do in any server is camp hop looking for plans I don’t have. I’m such a low level but I’m already on the hunt for all of the plans lol
---
I agree
---
Right now I’m no certain build really. I’m a half heavy half melee build. My bloodied weapons I have are a bloodied hand made and a bloodied power fist. I definitely want to move onto a rifleman/ melee bloodied build. I’m sick of getting ammo for those weapons.
---
All I was trying to do was explain the monetization model to you.
---
For real. If I can't FT to a point because it's "inside a nuke zone" then don't respawn me in one. Idiots.
---
I’m more of the gesture you over here, give it an elbow, and let you get hits bloody build.
---
I see all kinds of people that don’t share.
---
I’m kind of used to it by know. I seldom get good loot through random event legendaries anyhow.
---
I tried, but nothing changed.😂
---
Thanks for the tip, yeah I use vats and crits a lot since it’s nearly impossible to hit it without using vats
---
Different... BUT THE SAME
---
I was doing this the other day and it looked like I sold my vault suit but I checked and it was still there. Another time I was selling off food and a pop up said vendor doesnt have enough caps and I was selling something for 4000 caps but it didn’t show what it was. A few other times it seemed to flash a different item but I’ve yet to notice anything missing. Of all the bigs in this game I’ve luckily avoided all of them except the power armor one which is no big deal. If I start selling gear because of some wired laggy bug I’m gonna be pretty pissed.
---
I don’t understand how anyone finds this mobile game difficult.
---
Cheers!  It's a great feeling when this happens.  One night someone came by and started gushing about how much they loved my camp.  That felt pretty cool.
---
I’ve got one for you if you want to join me, gt same as my username
---
Congratulations! Sorry that she wasn’t being cooperative. You’ll get her next time!
---
Amazing work, yes they all would be great additions
---
Sorry don’t agree
---
Nw is actually good and you should play it instead of bitch about it.
---
Maybe just a spotlight mod for light and to draw aggro, and a electro coil mod, to briefly stun enemies after a bash attack.
---
Maybe a defibrillator for reviving player behind cover, or reinforced side panels where while standing, you can fire, but crouched, you're bracing it with the panels open and can't fire but gain a lot of DR.
---
I see a shield as more of a support build item, with the majority of its utility being for team play, especially if they nerf bloodied builds so they're ACTUALLY a glass cannon, a shield wielding support medic could tank/hold back enemies for the bloodied builds to take cover behind and unload, and provide cover to any melee builds that go down in a mob.
---
Hey, I get ya, and thanks for the reply. I was out of college when the first Fallout game came out, and the series has been a favorite of mine ever since. I'm an old rpg gamer, and no stranger to getting lost in worlds.
---
I don't think I ever really considered that people may just want to be playing a fallout game more than anything else. That some people value time spent in a world with little left to do over playing a new, different game that's not fallout.
---
I admire your enjoyment of it- good on you.
---
There was one up in the right hand corner west of bloatfly spawn area
---
Ugh Gary!
---
Great to know thanks for the update
---
This is why I made an alt to post. Lol
---
It'll happen more as you fill up your inventory. I don't think junk will slow things down as much as gear. Thinking about it data-wise. For junk, there's really only 2 values that your account needs to keep track of: the identifier(type of scrap) and the amount you have. When it comes to gear, there are several variables. There's the identifier(weapon or armor base), each mod slot, the durability, and a name(if you decide to rename it). All I can suggest to reduce lag is to scrap everything. Sell off what you can, move stuff to mules, and so on.
---
What platform do you play on because I want to come and visit and have you teach me your ways
---
I love the clutter. Feels very lore friendly
---
When this happens do you still get the score?
---
Yeah. I need to go back to being a loner, I guess.
---
Ok fine, you can have a buzz blade plan instead
---
Delete it and give survivor back
---
Yeah cut that one off
---
Lmao my suggestion would literally help players who enjoy nw, giving them more incentive and rewards for playing. I’ve played a lot of the game mode, why settle when it could be better
---
I've felt that way about Tetris, ha
---
I would also like to know.
---
I was a beta player... I left the game and came back with Wastelanders and now I am so sad that I missed this shelf! 😭
---
Makes sense.  I have been keeping a lot of legendaries lately due to the low daily scrip cap.  Trying to sell them over multiple days...
---
Same tbh
---
It only took me 16 levels worth of points to get everything I needed. I’m high level usually have 20+ levels I haven’t spent 
---
I run a bloodied gauss shotgun build - I also run a decent vampiric shotgun so you can heal yourself quickly in the thick of things and with gunfoo you can still one shot up to 8 ghouls in radiation rumble... if VATS haven’t shit the bed
---
More than anything it makes the game challenging and interesting again. 
---
I die mostly from falling or not paying attention, but if you dont self resurrect, it makes a level 45s day to stab you with a stim lol
---
I was previously running a tank build and it just got too boring
---
Does Bethesda liten to thies posts.
---
The vault stairs make it so you can’t fall through the gap I think
---
ONE OF US, ONE OF US
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
It actually worked? I've found tech data dropped by others, left in containers, etc and it never spawned the quest. Weird. So I actually sold someone something of value? Now I'm disappointed.
---
Yeah man, 1 minute to build a fortress, protect your teams generator, maybe add wall limits, incorporate quick crafting weapons and armor, etc
---
Would fit pretty well with Fallout.
---
Yea I passed him last night. I think I played all but one day since it started and finished all but the NW challenges. It seems it’s easily attainable so I’m not stressing about missing a day. Here and there.
---
Well, it's what I'm guessing because whenever I tried selling stuff off to vendors, the weapons and armor tabs would always lag a ton while the others were fine.
---
Id like this on my low damage weapon I bring to events. Itd make them more entertaining for sure
---
I’ve built in that spot before. It’s a solid camp. Love the cranberry nuka colas and abundance of radstag
---
?
---
Yup. and then i yeet myself off the cliff right after.
---
**YOU PICKED THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD, FOOL!**
---
If you have the raider punk ally at your camp, one of missions can be to go hunt a mothman
---
They're eventually going to increase camp budget with F1st
---
I play on console and you have no idea how many toxic players I run into use explosive bait to destroy low level bases or high levels and to top it off they'll use nukes to make you leave the session if they don't like you
---
For those of us that truly loathe BRs it’s miserable being forced to play it for a challenge. If Bethesda would have done anything remotely creative for a pvp mode i’d probably play the shit out of it. Anything but a BR man
---
was broken?
---
You don’t have fallout first?
---
Make a new character and level him. It's account wide so getting to level 1 takes one game of bush wooking roughly.
---
It sounds like too much honestly
---
just... why?
---
All I’m gonna say is holy shit. These photos are epic
---
Ah, well I was half right! Haha! :D 
---
That is a new one (the quest being stuck after a d/c) and definitely sucks.
---
Forget the Charleston Capital building I just 3 legendaries from Leader of the Pack and it was ten times easier
---
i fucking hate it
---
I only have one Ally, Beckett, didn't even know you could get different Allies.   
---
Where can I find the Raider Punk Ally?
---
Daguerre... Da Guerre... Guerre... GARY!
---
Now you’re talking!!
---
That’s #2
---
Really???  Look up the super duper market.....you will find the first one there!
---
That is just straight up false. i passed the luck skill check. I literally put points from agility into luck so that i could. She still says this shit every 8 seconds and i want to murder her.
---
Wow im glad this never happens to me I just give a low lvl a couple leg arms and weaps and move on. Usually don't see them again but then again I always seem to be busy farming materials lol
---
Do you like dying frequently? Is running around near death something you crave? If you enjoy being practically dead, then bloodied is what you're looking for. 
---
Hi, I'm not just dead inside. I also play as nearly dead. Much of my gameplay is trying to remain hovering near death. While many people enjoy a full life, I'm only 1/10th alive. If this sounds like an appealing way of living to you, then being bloodied might be what you're looking for. 
---
If you love being highly irradiated, relying on luck, and your "intelligence" to keep you "alive" then boy oh boy have I got a way of life for you! Bloodied! Yes, that's right friend! You can be nearly dead, and enjoy a nearly full halfway alive practically dead lifestyle! 
---
Go bloodied friend, do lots of damage, but die when someone drops a hat beside you! 
---
Seriously, it's a lot of fun to play this way and it introduces an element of danger much like what the early stages of the game has. That's what I find most appealing about it as a Lvl 260 player. If you don't want to deal with dying all of the time, than being bloodied probably won't work for you. But if you don't mind constantly dying and reloading your game, go for it, the rewards are few! But the damage to others are immense!
---
Huh weird, she rarely ever mentions headaches for me, wonder what else I did different.
---
And a set of unyielding armor would have done that for you without changing your skill points around!
---
He wanders the wasteland. There’s 5 total. 3 give daily repeatable quests. 2 have a whole story line quest.
---
I think Crater might be a good place to find the raider punk and talk to him till he says set up his radio at your place.
---
Oh wait yes I have!  I think I found a tape in the first one but didn’t pursue it further
---
It's kind of an unforgivable bug at the moment. It's hard to take the game seriously when it can't do simple things right.
---
I put a lot of work into making a camp that looks functional and fits nicely into the world, it's so great when people stop by and check it out or even hang around for awhile. 
---
Also, love your username. Phoebe always makes me laugh no matter how many times I've watched every episode over again. 😂
---
Ah ok thanks a lot man! I'll look into installing it.
---
Here’s the thing; if it let you acquire rare and hard to find plans just by letting a robot do it for you, that removes a significant part of the game away. 
---
It’s one thing to get extra junk or scrap or ammo, etc. But plans are different. 
---
Plus, there’s no value in getting a plan after you learned it. Unlike everything else Collectrons can find. 
---
Collectrons should be for consumables, not permanents items.
---
I HATE ticks in real life so it makes them extra creepy. A tick was the FIRST creature I ever ran into back when I first started the game and I'm pretty sure my neighbors heard that stream of curse words.
---
username checks out
---
yeah I'm gonna get a bffr mini when I'm home because its amazing:) I'm sorry to hear that
---
Good to see someone likes it.
---
Much appreciated man!
---
Idk maybe just lucky. 
---
and yeah, i know. some people don’t want to play the most meta shit in the game. crazy i know
---
Agreed 100%.
---
Thankfully the last time this challenge popped up I had a ton of card packs. I just opened a bunch and got a level. I don't know how I had 86 of them on my NW rank 3 character, but I'm not complaining. Maybe it's because I hit rank 100 on my main NW character? If I have 80 packs on each character, I should be good for a while.
---
GAVIN!!!!!!
---
Welcome to the club
---
Get first it makes it so much better
---
I cant do that because it tells me that I dont have privileges
---
You don't need to play the meta, just have two pieces of unyielding on you and lower your health to pass checks, do crafting/scrapping,or vender shopping.
---
Everything. Loot while doing the main story and use that loot to improve your camp and gear
---
It's easy tho
---
You seem pretty enthusiastic about plans, have a chemistry workbench AND a tinker's workbench on the house!
---
I felt special, now I hear she gets around...
---
How does the camp work? And I should just loot as I do the story, instead of going to places like the quarry or something?
---
Tou have like 6.3 weeks left why would you skip at all?
---
Don’t diss gramps man. He’s great!
---
If you didn't get a little pop up saying "you are being attacked by X" then you must have pacifist on, which you can turn off in the game options. After someone hits you, you have to hit them back. When you die you lose some caps, and any junk you're carrying. Players cannot loot your camp except for resources you leave unlocked. They can still destroy it through an exploit but they have to know about it so it rarely happens.
---
Idk. I’m just impatient :/
---
Ok.  It's there after I leveled up to add a star. Why can I only see it Then??
---
Not until the end to get the best bang out your atoms.
---
I dont give handouts 
---
I train newbies on how to get the things they want 
---
How to fix their build and how to farm for stuff
---
You probably had the area chat on, but isn’t it nice when someone compliments? I had a random add me on PS4 and sent me a message about my Fasnacht Museum, warmed my little Mothman heart.
---
Don't skip until you're actually having trouble with the level ups
---
“I just can’t shake these nightmares... floating in space forever”
---
Really stroking your ego with that 8-12 kill average, huh? We all know that’s not true. Your highest is 12, you just consider your highest to be your average.
---
Because those parts require the most XP right? Are the XP reduced a little when you reach chapter 3?
---
Wait what *t h i c c* walls?
---
BDSM Dungeon you say? Can I join? I’ll be filthy.
---
eh, there aren’t anymore speech checks after you complete it anyway. Hard bargain and grape mentats means i don’t need it for that. 15 intelligence when i’m on a team means i don’t need it for crafting or scrapping. Sounds like extra weight tbh
---
Legendary modules are needed to craft the gear from the raiders or settlers. 
---
I would personally buy those because it's random what you get when you craft. Like the stars are random and the rolls are random. So you may end up crafting dozens and dozens of the same thing.
---
Crater is definitely the easiest place to find him. He hangs around down in the bottom of the interior section in the cave area in addition to being found randomly out in the world. The only ally without a guaranteed constant location is the settler wanderer.
---
You only drop junk when you PvP. When you shoot a player they have to damage you back to initiate PvP. At which time both players will be hidden from each other on the map and they’ll appear red on screen like an enemy. The only exception is workshop PvP. If someone has claimed a workshop and another player tries to claim it from them and both players are in the workshop zone then they’ll automatically become hostile to each other. Wanted players are open to damage immediately but when you damage them they can start to shoot you back for full damage. Players can only destroy your base if both of you are currently hostile to each other. Players under level 5 are immune to  PvP damage. PvP damage is capped at 110 but explosive bullets can break that cap.
---
I'm aiming for the SS ghillie im so close but so far
---
Can't give you numbers, but you should be oneshooting everything except bosses.
---
Definitely second the weather wane, wrought iron fencing, and string lights though any of these would go a long way toward making a camp look "busy" with some more variety (assuming you're not literally dropping 2000 atoms a week in the shop 🙄).
---
Run through the forests at dusk/night. Do the mothman event first. I always see them when im in the forest at around that time. I've also been high up usually on my way to a camp cliff. The mountain by whitespring def appeared for me there.
---
The folk singer also wanders
---
&gt;and yet...
---
The entire game is a jumble of incomplete ideas.
---
Under your game options, there is an option for pacifist mode, turn this on, this will prevent you accidentally starting PVP.
---
yes you won't take damage unless you hit back if pacifist mode is off.
---
As far as I know your camp is safe but I believe if you initiate pvp, they can destroy your camp (someone correct me if I am wrong).
---
In the old days they could literally destroy your camp by picking a lock but they have built some nice mechanics to prevent this, you don't have to worry about your camp. I haven't had my camp destroyed since the mechanics were implemented probably a year ago. Enjoy the wasteland and ignore the pvp  players, they were typically get bored and leave quickly.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
if you take a workshop, you open yourself up to PVP, but you have to be in the green zone of the workshop for them to be able shoot you. There are some exploits that allow them to kill you outside of the workshop but this is mostly a non issue, not something worth worrying about. Also don't be afraid to take a workshop, you going to need to do this to complete daily and weekly challenges, just be aware of your surroundings.
---
i love dis
---
15 is only the soft cap, the hard cap on it making a difference on charisma buying/selling is 23,and 31 for intelligence scrapping/crafting.
---
100 is the cap for intelligence giving experience buffs, which you can get close to with various food buffs.
---
You want to have a FAT stack legendary modules saved up, so buy those as much as you can
---
Or is it....
---
Should be doing good then
---
You should focus in one type of weapon and get all the perks that make that weapon do as much damage as possible. Everything else is for fun.
---
It didn't worked properly.In fact in didn't changed anything. Hunger and Thirst were the same.  
---
It supposed to lower for 75% negative effects of mutations, but with speed demon it didn't worked.
---
That's the settler wanderer.
---
Boom! Found him and just put him at my C.A.M.P!   
---
Thanks you two!
---
Camp is self explanatory, it’s just your camp where you can make any type of place for you to settle in and craft and repair everything you have. You can make a basic design and place your workbenches on it or you can be creative and make yourself a house, it doesn’t require that much of an explanation you just need to mess around with the builds to figure them out. Though I have to say that many builds are locked behind plans you need to find or buy in the world, so if you’re trying to start with your camp now you should make something basic until you’re ready to improve it. 
---
There’s plenty of loot in the game, You’re not going to have any issues with it if you loot as you progress in the game. But if you desperately need a specific type of material then you could go out of your way and visit specific places with that material or you could just buy it from an NPC or player vendor. But from my personal experience, you should be good with materials if you loot as you play but that depends on your playstyle and how often you’re going to need the materials to build new things or craft yourself ammo or aid or repair your gear
---
Some guy came in and started shooting my gorilla. So I destroyed his whole base.
---
Go to whitespring and check the robot vendors downstairs. I don’t remember which one. Just check all of them. I think I saw it for about 300 caps. Then again I can’t remember if I had hard bargain 3 equipped. And with my unyielding charisma of 18 I’m sure that helped with the price too.
---
What kind of build should I do? And what weapon would you recommend using?
---
It's funny that my bimbo barbarian sheep is so much more charasmatic and scholarly when she is literally bleeding out on foundation's nice clean floors!
---
The hilarious thing is I can’t tell if your actually telling your experience with an actual glitch in the game
---
Is the Dusk/Night thing a requirement?  
---
If so, that may be leaning into my lack of finding him issue haha
---
I would do this for PS4 :) glad to see someone else helping others out!
---
Thanks for the explanation, I haven’t started with wastelanders so I didn’t know that you use them for that
---
Just seems like that's when I see angry mothman. When you do find him you gotta be quick cause he disappears a bunch really quick.
---
So it’s basically the fallout 4 settlement builder but with level locking?
---
I had a random level 80 or so message me "Can I have 5mm" the other day. I messaged back telling him to invest in the ammosmith and super duper perks. As well as west tek and lucky hole being great spots for the main components for crafting.
---
He messaged back saying "Thanks asshole, I need ammo." I promptly blocked him.
---
It's amazing how entitled some people are.
---
Do they take any weight in your stash or backpack? And I should spend all of my scrip on them right?
---
Oh god. Lock up the wanderer, she’s going to kill her!
---
Seriously?  I had an asshole the other day I should’ve done this too
---
In their eyes, they only get one challenge while adventure players get multiple (Paraphrased of course). Your post suggests that people who enjoy nuclear winter only get one challenge a day. As in, the only part of the game they play is NW, which we both know isnt true. You're correct that we have Nuclear Winter and bethesda wants to keep it for some weird reason. Given the track record, I'm surprised it lasted this long. But they can do a lot more than make a few seasonal skins, two maps, and add in a few wastelanders weapons. Real incentive to play would be nice instead of ", Ok, gotta stimpak 3 times. Time to find some stims and a cliff. Cool, that's done, back to adventure!" I know that more than 100 people play, but when you see the same people in multiple games for the course of 4 hours, it really calls into question how many people are actually playing on the North American server. That might just be a Xbox problem and PC and PS are overflowing with players, but I can only comment on my experience. I do play Nuclear Winter every now and again and the challenges do not really add to the experience. I don't really care about the legendary run, and it doesnt bother me at all that I'm not going to complete it. I think I'm maybe level 30 something and I havent played in a week. And even when I was making an attempt to do the dailies, I normally would skip the NW challenge. All I'm trying to say is that the current NW challenge is inconvenient, and I would almost consider changing it to be a QOL improvement. Either change it to be in line with the other challenges, give us completely different challenges for nuclear winter (for the over achievers who can manage doing both sets), or give us optional challenges that can be completed in either mode.
---
With how fast my hunger and thrist drains I'm inclined to believe that class freak is still having no affect on it at all.
---
Gary. Gary. Gary. Gary! Gggaarryyyyyy!
---
It doesn’t matter what weapon you use. The only thing that matters is you do 1,00 damage. 
---
Assuming you find the weakest gun in the game. And it only does ONE damage per bullet. You just need to shoot her 1,000 times :D
---
But honestly. Even if you aren’t a gun build, shooting her in the face does about 10-15 damage per bullet. So it won’t take much to reach that 1,000 damage marker. 
---
When I play my unarmed bloodied build and I put on stealth, I do about 1,000 damage in one punch. Around 1,500 when i use a power attack.
---
If you’re far enough in to use bullion to buy weapon or armor plans from the vault, foundation or crater, you’ll need legendary modules. Otherwise grab yourself a 2 or 3* weapon or armor.
---
You'd want to tag them in a comment, like this.

---
 Nope. But It’s scheduled to be fixed in the next patch coming in a couple of weeks.
---
Would be nice if they'd fix the auto completing challenges too.
---
Don't think they take any weight. Yeah, spend all of your scrip on them. It takes 1 module per armor craft and two per weapon craft. So if you get down to only having access to the initial 150 scrip a day you'll be able to roll three armors a day
---
Yeah but it’s not worth it, all the servers are full of low levels, nukes aren’t being launched as much and when they are, most of the times they fail at killing the queen.
---
I have 5 characters, all of them can do bloodied or not (junkies, furious, etc) but for a variety of reasons they are bloodied 95% of the time.
---
Yeah, I die easier. I also kill faster, level faster, use less resources, have more fun, the wife thinks I'm funnier, you make it.
---
Yeah, I had that happen once. I gave a guy some junk that I didn't need, and built him a few crafting tables and a generator, then he expected me to build him an entire house. I built the layout, because I love building, but when I decided to go do something else (Meat Week), he started complaining that I wasn't doing everything for him every possible second.
---
Deleted. Now I only hand out maybe some chems/water, if even that. No further interaction.
---
Bingo! It’s not locked to level, just plans. And these plans can be found throughout the world and bought from players and vendors. So if RNG isn’t on your side, you can always buy them if you have the caps. 
---
And speaking of caps, you can get a maximum of 1400 per day by selling random things to an NPC vendor. So if you come accross an item you don’t need, you should sell it to them to make some early caps. But not everything can be sold to vendors unfortunately, like ammo and plans cannot
---
And one last thing, you’re also locked to a budget on your camp. This was also the case for fallout 4 but the budget is far less in 76. So pick your builds carefully, prioritize the important things (workbenches, water purifiers, generators) first before you move on to decorating your camp. But you should have enough budget for both
---
m8, where did you get shielded casual? mire events?
---
This has been done already.
---
Nope I’m not that far because I haven’t even started lol, but thanks for the tip I’ll make sure to stick with modules
---
Alrighty, thank you so much!
---
So yeah I have a idea for a real event that could come from this. So I'm pretty sure everyone here has played through GTA5 main storyline at least once yes? Do you remember when Michael took the drugs and imagined all the aliens running at him? Well now pair it up with the new "sniff unusual pipe" random encounter to start the event.........and it uses different color pallets from photomode as the banging color high effect.
---
Alright thank you!
---
On the flip side of that, I wish people would stop giving me things when they see me rolling my level 10. PLEASE GUYS. I have a high level main, and I’m playing a low level because I enjoy the grind. Please let me have my garbage.
---
No problem, make sure to ask again if you need any more help. And enjoy the game!
---
Whichever you like. I went power armor/heavy weapons build. It was tough until I got a mini gun then it was easy as hell.
---
If you set your perks right it isn't a big deal to change, it's just moving some cards. Really, it's basically gear and two 3 point perk cards (nerd rage, serendipity).
---
Swap nerd rage for first aid and pick 3 points to spend in luck when you aren't low health. Keep adrenal reaction all the time.
---
literally everything in the atom shop for camps is the same 4 or 5 objects (from a wireframe standpoint) with a different graphical skin over it.
---
There is a table, a sofa, a chair, a counter, and a lamp. Everything is just a different skin wrapped around that same object. This is why we can't get actual 'new' types of objects without things falling apart (display cases, vendors, etc.)
---
What about fusion cores? Those were pain for me in F4
---
“FUCK YEAH, we added a battle royale IN FALLOUT 76”
---
No...just no...
---
Extra carry weight is pointless when you can effectively manage your inventory.
---
They really need to do that...
---
If they deleted the bullshit like Frog Legs, Tesla Rifle, grenades (maybe), and actually had anti-cheat, I'd play it a lot more.
---
Bonus points if they really ramped up the enemy spawns. PvPvE is fun. Having 1 NPC spawn every 20 minutes is boring. Either go all in or remove it.
---
can power armor even fit through that?
---
also, 100% of my camps in FO4 turned into giant out door factories that turned dead raiders/mutants into raw materials - sorting them into hoppers for convenience, and dumping the bones into an ever growing pit.
---
Eventually all my saves crash when there are thousands of bones and my pc cant handle it.
---
I have fallen victim to the commander bug. Completed the first part of the quest, but can't do anything after getting the flight recorder.
---
Go back and she complains about her back hurting
---
Thanks. Sorry for the confusion. I did not realize the only time you could see it was when you leveled up and used pick a perk. I have used my picks to level up cards I was using.  Without this forum I would have never even known what these cards really do
---
It's fun to play sometimes on console, I like out smarting players. No bushes, unless I have to, I prefer to use the camp system to climb!
---
Nukes aren't being launched as much I'd say is mostly due to the cost and benefit. I launch nukes and I've never failed at killing the Queen but it's the time to launch a nuke that gets frustrating. And it's the same event, I mostly do it now if I need a quick influx of xp to level but saving some nuke cards for wendigo event. Are you launching nukes?
---
Hard disagree, except Frog legs ruined it.
---
Because you actually DID select it before.  You had Starched Genes 1 *equipped*. 
---
This is what happened. 
---
You already had one rank 1 Starched Genes, but it was assigned to your luck stat and you weren’t looking closely enough at your **equipped** cards; only your **available** cards.   That’s why you didn’t see it. 
---
Once you went to level up and went to choose another copy, **THEN** it asked you if you wanted to combine them. And once you combined them, it went from your equipped cards down to your available cards. 
---
In other words, if you just now did one level up, selected Starched Genes one time, the system asked you if you wanted to combine it, and then Starched Genes ***2*** was suddenly in your list of available cards, then the first one was **already** equipped. You had Starched Genes 1 assigned to Luck and didn’t look closely enough to see it. 
---
**In other words,** ***User Error.***
---
I’m glad you found it. Perhaps next time you have a technical issue and ask a question you’ll set aside your ego long enough to listen to the advice being given. 
---
Have a good day.
---
Np
---
You need the SS under armour on with it
---
So healing factor wouldn’t be good for this? I could imagine out of combat when super low health could just bump you up a little till you hit your rads
---
Yeah I'm going this root, Bethesda just needs to release a mod workshop like did for 4 but with mods they have approved or just say we can't use any, so we can get this over with. I don't like the tip toeing answer they are using.
---
i also do not understand the reference.
---
Level 4 just took her on with a axe apparently i did enough damage. But not enough for the event xp
---
If you have just started the game and don't have a meta build, god roll gear and hundreds of duped Nuka Quantums - just avoid PvP altogether. 
---
This game is so horribly unbalanced that unless you have all of the above you will not be competitive. 
---
Go to Nuclear Winter for PvP, or at least wait until you have a decent build (around level 80) and equipment (which will take a lot of trading to get).
---
Keep Pacifist mode on, stick to Public Teams and always sneak in workshops. And stash your junk often for God's sake!
---
Heh was wondering when I'd see someone make this joke. Thank you for this. I always knew the purveyor was a perv. Who knows what he does to some of those legendaries
---
Blocking does nothing but grey someone out in Adventure mode and stop you from being able to hurt them, it doesn't stop them from doing anything to you!
---
I had her, the Settler Forager, and the Punk all wandering together somewhere the other day (forget where) with the "name" **'s Ally** for each of them. One of them orphaned from a logged-out CAMP I could believe, but three?
---
Thanks this is exactly what I was looking for.  Lots of outdated info on the web. 
---
I'm not interested at all in PVP for the most part, so I'll just turn it off.  I did take an unowned aluminum workshop once, seemed like nobody wanted anything to do with it.
---
Would be great if they were modules (hell could be rewards for next season) that you can apply to any weapon (adds an extra star)
---
Lol got a good laugh from this. I think I need a change of gameplay so I’ll hit this path
---
Do we know what is breaking in place of this fix?
---
I recommend slowing down to read the on-screen prompts. 
---
I’m glad you fixed the issue, but to be honest, 95% of the questions on this forum would be solved by the user reading the in game information.
---
So in effect it gives it a Legendary effect.  
---
Can you have more than one on one bow or would it overwrite the previous one?
---
Beg to differ. Today alone I ran on 7 Queen events. I am out of ammo for my W.O.C. and running low on the junk I need to make it. Oh well.... time to food build it up and farm away. 
---
I will say this. It was really slow on like 3 servers prior to hitting my streak.
---
You could get really lucky and get the gun you want out of your first 20 tries. Or it could take you hundreds. And there's also the armour you can craft.
---
Turns out this still isn’t a legitimate instance. OP had Starched Genes 1 already equipped and wasn’t looking close enough. Once they used a level up and went to get a copy of Starched Genes, it prompted OP to combine them. 
---
Simple user error.
---
Just ran across this yesterday! Gave me a good chuckle also 👍
---
The only meat I eat is glowing and I’m stealth hitting SBQ in the face for 3500-4000 with a 1-star bloodied mole gauntlet.
---
There’s much better out there but that’s what I have right now and those are my most consistent numbers.
---
Super easy to get. Grab the Poseidon power station, do the event to repair the generator, and use it to power up the fusion core factory. I usually have at least 14+ on me at any given time.
---
There is an ally spawn north of the treetop location. Its right around the stinging spawn by a pile of wood. Found both of them there while farming parts for stings and things.
---
I was full health since launch. Rolled a few unyielding secret service pieces that I stashed for a rainy day but I was never really interested in bloodied. Then the purveyor gave me a blooded handmade with 25% less vats and I was going to trade it but my friend who plays bloodied melee kept encouraging me to try it svd in glad I did. It's more fun then I thought it would be. The hardest part I'm finding is getting more rads during an event when revived with less rads
---
I’ll look into that. Oh, also. How is stealth in this game?
---
My daughter was real disappointed when she found that out as well
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
I had a 3 way fist fight with a guy who shot me with a tesla and a random lvl 300 who came accross us fighting
---
We all died to ghouls because all we used was our fists
---
Is Daguerre pronounced Da Gary?
---
Nonsense if you do a stealth build. Pretty much always invisible. I do sneak attacks with my junkie .50 cal machine gun and melt faces. Hit me up if you play on PC. I have a fallout 1st server and can carry through some of the good xp events.
---
I like this idea and makes a whole lot
---
Of sense , now we just need devs to actually
---
Put some Effort In beyond keeping gameplay afloat , and some might even question they do that
---
Modules weigh .25 lbs
---
Oddly enough, no. They just [had Scorched in their name](https://imgur.com/TQgk3pR).
---
I’m pretty sure the gauntlet doesn’t out damage a death law gauntlet. I have an unstoppable monster with 3rd claw and a bloodied gauntlet with +1 strength and it’s about 50 damage under including the shock pad mod on it. That being said it’s still an amazing melee and 50 damage when I’m talking 2.5k on the queen all meated up and 4-6k+ on everything else is nothing in the grand scheme of things
---
Life saving is great for procing revenant!
---
Fwiw think about the 2 options of respec 1 character,  or make a new one. 
---
For example with 1 character/build you only need items that benefit that 1 build. You can only earn 1x thr scrip, gold, and caps per day.  You can only have a total of 30k caps. 
---
2 characters means you can earn 2x scrip gold and carrots per day. Items you find for 1 build might benefit the other and vice versa.  You can experience different builds without respec. The good items on your current build still benefit that build and the items you've found for the new build will still benefit the 2nd character. You can possess up to 60k caps for a high value trade or to clear out multiple good items from multiple vendors if you stumble upon them.
---
Yeah I've played enough of these types of games to know that I'm not going to even remotely compete with the people running perfect builds and weapon combos. 
---
Really I just wanted to understand the mechanics so I could avoid PVP without staying away from other players altogether.
---
The same way you replace any wall in the workshop. On PC you edit it and press T to replace.
---
Just get a pipe pistol and farm scorched. That’s what I did.
---
Just track down a Scorched with a shotgun.  
---
Introduce its forehead to its rectum by way of its thorax.  
---
Take the shotgun and shoot until can crit. Crit some sucker for 8 in one shot. Repeat this step until completed.
---
Make a 2nd character for that.
---
It’s either ballet slippers or oversized shoes.
---
It's worse than you think the pvp damage cap can be reached with maxed out player perks and no legendary effects, so assassin's literally does nothing at all if you're using a decent weapon!
---
Also with radscorpion egg omletes, the only difference is that addictol removes all addictions at once and omletes 1 random addiction at a time
---
The shooting in nuclear winter feels really, really, really good ... but... I hate battle royale.
---
I would LOVE a TDM arena or a FFA arena instead of nuclear winter. Imagine how fun that would be spawning with a handmade and a pipe pistol every time and just battling it out!
---
You have a whole week to land like 20 Crits. It's not hard.
---
They weigh .25 each
---
Yeap. I mean their solocom Joe's vendor was amazing and im glad they out it in. Their premade items are also "new". But like you said they established a set of items they can develop fast for cash. I will say that some of the data mined stuff is looking cool. Like the giant bunker and the power generator. Curious how those will work.
---
It was like playing as a baby except possessed.
---
true true, I just wish they were more natural play focused like the “complete events when in a group” and  “kill 10 legendaries”. Even the workshops are fine bc they have some good benefits and can help you complete other camp challenges
---
Don’t worry, I didn’t let her stay long. I couldn’t take her hippy crap. I’d rather a girl who is constantly asking ‘why’ and a man who thinks everything ‘smells like feet.’
---
True, that might be the way
---
Obviously it’s gonna be different on PS4 you guys don’t have gamepass
---
Yeah, but that seems like a weird workaround, and boots still dont have the camo on them
---
That's why i don't move my camp at all
---
So that makes it impossible for you to pick up any ranged weapon (shotgun prefered for every pellet = crit) to shoot few criticals? Ok.
---
I just hide in the bush ,so I don't know .
---
Shit, I really should hop on.  When exactly does it end tomorrow?
---
Ideally, the challenges should be shit that most players naturally do, and fixer spammers are the only people I can really think of who use vats on a regular basis.
---
lol, Bad news for you is that some things that were data mined over a year ago are still not in game.
---
I run mainly melee with heavy guns slightly less speced on the side haha
---
I was at a station the other day and got a shit ton of items in a suitcase there. I assumed it was just someone dumping items there lol perhaps I showed up during that process... oops
---
I use melee, no need to be a dick.
---
If it was during an event, you could always fast travel away and come back. Otherwise, if you die right before the event finishes and are unable to respawn, you can usually wait it out.
---
I can appreciate that.  
---
This is just one of the ones I shrug at when it pops up; it's a pill, but it could be far worse.  
---
Like most of the Nuclear Winter ones, for example.
---
It can be used as a meat and acid farm. Bloatfly and kill, bloatfly the bloatfly and kill. Repeat. Even more meat with butcher’s bounty. Even had a legendary bloatfly spawn once. I believe it’s a low level legendary though.
---
It’s not even that bloodied itself is all that powerful. It’s the synergy of bloodied, adrenal reaction, nerd rage, AND unyielding along with the perks to help keep you alive that make it ridiculous. Junkies is probably the #2 to bloodied, but it’s nowhere close to the power because there’s no synergies.
---
True. I haven’t completed a single nuclear winter daily, because frankly I could not be fucked to go into that mode.
---
Ok whoa! So I can only get 5 scrap armor a day from purveyor? It’s going to take forever to get 127 scrap!!! After using perk cards.... better way to get some?
---
That is pretty.
---
This. Takes like 2 enemies to get that weekly done.
---
Someone nuked my house as soon as I spawned in, so he repaired it for me and gave me a ton of plans. I was a bit worried about picking them up at first :/
---
Bro that sounds so funny. My favourite glitch is when you sit in power armour and the arms stay in the air.
---
There's this thing called the internet, not sure if you're familiar with it.  Most people use it for looking up porn but if you know where to look you can also figure out where the fuck there's bubblegum in this game.
---
Since Adrenaline is broken I got addicted to Thru-hiker lol
---
That's a lovely sight to see.
---
Extra carry weight from a pepperoni roll or grilled radstag can be useful if you get knocked overweight by a bunch of hardened mass/flux or legendary drops you need to cart to the scrip bin. Both Herbivore and Carnivore are helpful for weight management, in general, as they cut out the need to carry prepared foodstuffs around. Not needing to use Thru Hiker frees up Agility points that are better used for combat or evasion in a nuke zone.
---
I got the chicken coop ,you jelly don't lie.
---
We have the same base location. Although different builds.
---
Only purveyor I'm afraid, well I think you cam buy it from other players not sure
---
Just use a shotgun. Each crit counts 6x or so. You can even take shotgun perks to switch to if you so choose on a str build.
---
oh and ps faster auto weapons get 2 or 3 crits per.
---
They should add this to the diseases in the game...
---
Bashing works.
---
They're all really easy as it is.
---
It was terrifying easily beating the wendigo in fear factor the worst part was it made it look like you were going so fast.
---
Being melee still doesn't make it impossible for you to pickup a shotgun. You don't have to kill anything with it. It can be a lv1 non-legendary and you will still get the crits done. Also, melee works on vats too you know.
---
I can carry that then
---
Thanks for letting me know!
---
Alright, thank you for the advice! I’ve been looking at a Gauss shotgun build for a while now, guess it’s time
---
Yes, I just realized I wasn't wearing any armor (but still had my outfit on). I'm glad, I don't like the effect.
---
You didn't see the post of the one that had, like, 50?
---
Hmmm ok, I’ll check on fb page. Thank you
---
You can do that yourself be putting a chair too close to a wall!
---
Bro I hope you got a chance to film it 😂
---
aw i love ppl like that
---
Melee on vats looks weird, it'll teleport you to the target
---
No
---
You’re totally right. I apologize for the rudeness last post, not in a good mood and assumed your post was in insulting manner, when clearly it wasn’t. I’m gonna give the shotgun thing a try.
---
Imo I think each challenge should have a way to complete it in adventure or a way to complete it in nw
---
Anytime! 👍 everyone's advice on stockpiling them is still solid though. You'll be glad you did when you can finally use them.
---
I did and sent it to a good friend of mine his reaction was more or less like "what the fu*k" it was pretty low quality and i dont feel like sharing it though. I could probably recreate if i wanted to.
---
This is a good start. With Ninja, you should easily hit a few thousand points of damage with simple to no buffs. You’ll need to snort all sorts of goodies to hit those magic 20,000 numbers.
---
yup
---
I’m absolutely going to hoard the shit out of them, these advices were very helpful I really appreciate it
---
Ah ok. How did you get this giltch to start or did it just happen out of nowhere?
---
You can, and you can also remove the floor piece they're attached to after placing them without removing them. They can also be destroyed with the flamethrower trap to do item merging shenanigans. [I spent about half an hour setting them up as railings on either side of my staircase.](https://i.imgur.com/5FTG8Wa.png) I've made a lot of changes to the surrounding area since taking this pic, but it gets the point across.
---
True, true.
---
Lol is it still busted? Haven’t been on recently
---
Finally someone said it.
---
No u just dont understand u have to wait 12-24hrs
---
Almost for vendor cap reset and the rest is in your head
---
It would be neat if they sold about 1% for 500 atoms (up to a max of 10 or 20) and add an extra 20% with F1st or something (along a bigger radius why not), I am just glad atoms are obtainable for everybody. Really chill game, these past two days I could only do 1 task because I literally spent like 12 hours perfectioning my camp, it's in a swamp on the south, I sell cheap plans, ammo, purified water, chems and medicine I manufacture myself exclusively for the newbies
---
I've just got myself a berserkers explosive combat shotgun so that I can tag mobs in events without killing them
---
I'm bloodied rifleman build so have no shot gun perks.
---
Added a scorchkiler receiver to make it even weaker. Does around only 90 damage with nerd rage and adrenal reaction.
---
So don't scrip those berserkers explosives, great mob tagging tools.
---
Goverment=Enclave=Secret Service. That is atleast how i see it / understand it.
---
I hate it too trust me. If I wanted a BR I would go play a good one. It's even more painful being forced to play a bad one when you know what a good one feels like.
---
I still don't understand people that don't build proper bases. Like random structures, floating bases. It's just unappealing and hard to look at. Invest in a few lights. Like yeah it takes up some budget but it will make it look so much better; hard to enjoy a pitch black space. At that point smaller space/less rooms is worth just filling out what you have a bit better (LIGHT!)
---
Oh! The junk walls have been datamined? Interesting.
---
I get that too especially when you have a lot of Fashnacht (don't know how to spell it) masks
---
It was after i traded with a guy (has no relevance to glitch) when i went to a crafting station and he exites the game as i was on it and got stuck in the animation but could move around similar to the post then i fast traveled to my base and got stuck in that ungodly camera angle.
---
See last time I brought that up people disagreed with me lol. But maybe that would be the SS questline, connecting them with the government remnants. There would have to be a drawn out story like there was with Settlers/Raiders
---
I'M LOOKING FOR MY FRIEND GAVIN!!
---
Haha I'm laughing so hard. This game has so many good glitches
---
That’s clutch. I guess a good thing would be to carry a bunch of ionized meat? That always spikes my rads. Guess I’ll post something on marketplace tonight to get a better bloodied weapons. Gonna be tough to see some of my favorites go but the times they are a changin
---
Check all the cultist camps, they frequently hangout with their worshipers. This includes the little spots like you find dotted around the mire.
---
I had that happen once with a guy who apparently loved talking to himself in public chat. He kept calling my camp "Nuka Madness" lmao so to him I say I'm glad you liked it 🤣👍
---
Yeah the secret service armor is so sweet looking, but I'm pretty sure I won't be able to get the ghillie for it since I only get to play on the weekends mostly. Also I'm nowhere near getting the secret service armor anyways lol.
---
The ghillie on my metal armor looked pretty cool when I used it, though the material itself is a bit shiny/plastic-y.
---
I have quite a few atoms saved up from challenges so I just kinda wish I could buy the ghillie for my preferred armor, or if it was just a one-size-fits-all thing.
---
r/Cameraside does a few nukes and an Encrypted in each server he's in so if you just attended the Encrypted event I think you could get it.
---
Gee, at least you had a good experience. Mine was “This store is shit, why bother having it powered.”
---
The hard cap for charisma-related things is 16. [here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hard_Bargain) is my source bc i try not to just talk out of my ass without proof. Also i chill around 13 charisma and when i take a grape mentats and put on hard bargain, the prices do not drop very much at all. 
---
Dunno about the INT related things but the scrapper perk makes you hit whatever the INT cap is for scrapping, so i just use that. The test we did for that was simply me using scrapper with low INT (i think i had 6 at the time) yielded the same as my friend with his full set of unyielding (20-something INT) with AND without scrapper.
---
That happened to me too
---
Ward on my game is always broken the chair in his office he sits backwards on and in his bed he sleeps side ways he also enjoys standing inside of tables
---
Sorry but this is bad advice unless op really wants specific gear from wastelanders.
---
He said he was doing a YouTube video and he just had a mule account
---
I'd much rather keep the rotation of challenges than have it be a repeating kill X players one. Placing camps, ranking up, using stimpacks, that's are FAR easier that killing players. Heck I'd rather kill 9 creatures than kill 1 player.
---
Chinese stealth suit you can get it from a Settlers quest for free. Or you can buy it for 4000 gold bullion from reaching neighborly with the Settlers.
---
Also it’s not per session you can world hop and buy it till you run out of scrip (spent an hour doing exactly that today for thorn parts)
---
I also launched my first solo nuke tonight. Level 155. I had done two runs with a group before but always told myself I couldn’t handle it alone. I surprised myself! It’s a great feeling. Congrats!
---
That's pretty cool man. I spend tons of time on my camp too (a big red barn with an outdoor bar and stage) and secretly hope the people who stop by to shop take the time to check it out a bit lol.
---
Bloodied is great for a less specialized build since you get a ton of general damage bonuses.
---
Handmade skin... I'm so close I can taste the metal
---
That's vampires.
---
Good to know, I've not had that much need... Yet.
---
The way Vats is right now you may not be pleased with the gauss shotgun. If you are on Xbox the remedy for Vats is to go into it back out go back into it and your shots should hit. Otherwise the first couple of shots may be all over the place. I'm sure other platforms have a temporary remedy as well. Also Adrenaline on PTS has been repaired so it should be coming out on the August 8th update.
---
yeah that’s true. I actually like Apex i just don’t tell anyone 😭 it’s fun, smooth, characters are unique enough. i’ve yet to have fun playing any other BR
---
It ends at 12EST tomorrow, I hope you have better luck than I.
---
Well it is a fact that [enclave](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Enclave) is goverment, and secret service ofc is part of goverment. Now, is the secret service folk we meet in game in cahoots with enclave, or even aware enclave exists? That's a different question.
---
EDIT:  [secret service](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Service) is part of enclave, atleast on a bigger picture
---
I honestly don’t care because I know it ganna change... So I don’t wanna waste my time. 
---
Evidence show that it might change with the one wasteland update or brotherhood of steel
---
https://imgur.com/0ELpxb0

Bam.
---
Gonna add u so I can see it too.  My CAMP is my pride and joy RN. 🤣. My gamertag is TaT2Rtist79
---
I've mentioned this before. Where is the Dr. Zorbo brain helmet and cool robes and pointy boots outfit? That should have been in the season. I want that brain helmet.
---
I think that depends on whether you want to play with others or not. If any thing, I'd say be a little more selective about how you help who.
---
Kill them before they kill you.
---
Specific gear is always better than completely random rolls. Also secret service is the best base armor, so they would definitely want SS at least. The only weapon types you can't craft are rifles and 2H. Right off the bat they have access to Unarmed, 1H melee, Pistols, and Heavy Weapons. After a grind you can start crafting shotguns and a better heavy weapon
---
I have a Vats Hit Chance one, I’ve been testing it and it’s a 95% at like any range. Things broken af but in a good way 😂
---
Bethesda were lazy and instead of balancing all weapons for pvp, they just put a flat 110 damage cap per hit in PvP, that means any really high rate of fire weapon can destroy you quite fast and make it seem like a 1shot, but afaik you can't actually get "one shot" in pvp. My plasma flamer will wipe someone out in less than a second though, for example.
---
lol
---
You’ll get little love on Reddit for your post, and I was right there with you. Next time this happens, turn on the mic and talk to the one shot bandit. I guarantee you’ll learn a lot, I’ve learned more doing this than anything I found on the net. What you learn doesn’t have to be used for PVP but rather how to properly defend yourself when it happens again. A well built LVL 70 PVP can drop a LVL 250 PVE with ease. I know, because I was the LVL 250. :)
---
Pvp has always been a game of rocket tag. Even with assassin cav pieces you were 1 crit headshot from death.
---
I always check the map before I start to launch a nuke to see how many high-level players are there they are the ones that can help you take down the queen just be sure to get your thousand to 1500 points in so you can get the stuff.
---
I haven't tried that gun in pvp but I would imagine it wouldn't be so effective vs secret service armor?
---
If you're going for the legendary gauss shotgun you might possibly even roll one. They really do some great damage.
---
Huh weird, cause when I equip scrapper with higher intelligence, it scales with the intelligence, where with high intelligence and no scrapper, there isn't an increase at all.
---
If it flies, it dies.
---
Oh I totally waste valuable point space just to keep this perk equipped.  And I make sure ei pick up every nade i come across.  Never actually threw one in real time.  Because. Yes ma'am I am exactly that petty.
---
Just stoop down and you should vanish and be able to move about even with the light on. 😀
---
I’m pretty sure scrapper alone makes you hit whatever the cap is for scrapping stuff. From our tests that was my conclusion. Do your own and lmk if you get different results
---
Yeah, they’re great lmao
---
August 8th is the next update.
---
make enclave great again
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QX-FoCNu5w You should see some of this users camps. Just out of control.
---
Stock up on legendary modules from the get go and maybe roll a few 3* legendaries here and there. You’ll need so many modules for weapons and armor late game, you’ll thank yourself later
---
For me there is to many perk cards. To many scrap kits. (I will probably NEVER use them, i never been in that situation) and the bullion rewards are so derisory its laughable. 25 and 50 gold? is that a joke at our expense????? When I get 200 gold per day? Fuck me.
---
I actually would much rather have more large supply crates that give tons of scrap then useless perk cards and pitiful gold.
---
I just had this bug and storing, logging out and in, then placing it back worked for me. Thanks a bunch for posting this.
---
MEGA ENCLAVE
---
Actually it would be pretty cool to see the Enclave at full strength
---
I'm liking NW more than I thought even with the weird jank, but still would rather an old school death match / team death match / ctf type mode, but that's just the boomer in me.
---
Okay I really have no idea how to do that, but I will figure it out thx. I am on Xbox btw.
---
Agreed, NW score challenge needs to be improved. My teammates quit the match after they completed their dailies. One thrown themselves into the fire and used the goodbye emote. Should I say that I miss NW before score challenge? 😂
---
I always do 500 worth of modules and 500 ranged weapons (3*). Stocking up on modules is wise..makes life easier.
---
Gather up some toxic goo from West Tek.
---
I’m on Xbox and I got guass shotgun a while ago now and my very first roll was a 2 star bloodied one so I said hell yeah. It shows like over a 1000 damage a shot. Well vats sucks on it and can’t hit shit until like the fifth shot. I mean not all the time sometimes it’s first hit but most time it’s all over the place. So I barely use it unless I pull it out at a queen fight for close hit. Now my quad pump that has a magic effect is one hit kills on a lot if I hit on the head.  But even that sometimes misses at like 98% head shots. But when shottys work they are amazing. I never once used any of them until I was watching a video and said holy shit I have a magic shotty let me give a whirl. And with no perk cards I can one shot scortchbeasts. Even 1 star legendary ones. Haven’t found higher scortchbeast to try it out on yet tho.
---
I can agreed with this, I test it and  food/water needs goes to 0 in the same time with or with out.
---
You’ve gotta optimize your build if you’re gonna PvP. Level doesn’t matter. A level 50 with good PvP gear and the right perks will destroy a level 500 with a PvE optimized build. Damage mitigation is more important than damage resistance.
---
Modules. I have never gotten anything i want from that RNG bullshit. Worthless.
---
Maybe they won't in the Fractured Steel update, but it would be a huge waste of potential if the BOS, Secret Service, MODUS or even another sect of the Enclave never interact at any point in the future. 
---
Edit: Also the army guys from Foundation or even any remnants of the free states (we never get confirmation that all of them died)
---
Yea LD is good for now, without ‘magic’ nobody would be using shotguns.
---
Sorry to hear that bubba, Woods must be having an off day.
---
It's always been raided before I get there and after a few queen battles and encrypted I'm usually out of radiated food. It's not impossible or extremely difficult to maintain but I feel it's the hardest to out of the other aspects
---
Not enough players on a server, would be a cool idea though. Imagine a War Mode like in ESO tho
---
I sometimes have fog in 76. I love the weather changes from traveling all over the map.
---
This is the most reliable method, going to cultist locations at night.  Each locale has an overhang where a mothman will land.  I’m not sure if it’s weather, moon or time sensitive, but there’s a good chance you’ll see a mothman at any cultist camp at night after they do the summoning ritual.
---
Yeah I've got the meat. Often I'm running out by the times I've done a few queens and encrypted or project paradise. It's not super difficult but it's the hardest aspect for me. But I've kept my old favourite weapons and just started adding to my collection
---
I’m not a high level by any means (86) but camped by Watoga Station I get a mean number of legendaries. \
---
\
---
I prefer to drop em off at the vault entrance as welcome to the game for new players.
---
Right missed the PA.
---
I actually hate that effect. For some reason it makes me nauseous
---
As far as I know it should be fixed in patch 21 which drops early in august
---
You can activate the FEV vats to collect it or collect it from the glowing green pool under one of the decon showers.
---
Damn that sucks bro
---
I love this!  I would make room for it as a perk card.
---
Looks really cluttered! Nice job!
---
I have the rad barrels plan but do those even do much?
---
It's one of the legendary mods that can make shotguns and 200+ RoF weapons "magic". I think the entire bug boils down to a high number of hits in a short timeframe, lag, and some kind of issue with the damage calculation.
---
What do you mean by "it glitched"? That is incredibly vague and unhelpful.
---
Half of my dailies were already done, and I didn’t get the S.C.O.R.E. For them. Which really sucks at high levels, since it cost me at least 2 levels of advancement.
---
I'd heard about that one. 
---
But would a 33/25 handmade be able to do that?
---
Depends on your armour. Without armour the rad barrel is awesome. With my armour on the rad barrel is only giving me 6 rads each time I use it and when you need 50 to 60 rads it takes longer
---
Random occurrences between real wastelanders have real effects.
---
You have a week to get 10...
---
Sometimes give purveyor a shot. I’ve gotten lucky before and last week I had 300 and I rolled 3 bloodied weapons in a row and I’m a bloodied build so it was pure luck. I got my first bloodied fixer on the second roll that time. But if you don’t have your armor set you want then I would just spend it on legendary modules
---
Focus on the main story for a little while to get your bearings in the game and do some exploration in the forest region and it will help you level up. Also early game ammo is a lot less available so carry around a good melee weapon until you have a steady stream of ammo. I’d say just try every weapon you find until you find your favorite, my main character is a bloodied heavy weapons and i can destroy everything and my second character is a bloodied unarmed melee using a deathclaw gauntlet and power fist and it’s so much fun just one shotting everything. Eventually you’ll figure out what weapon you like and then you can create a build around it. Also don’t worry too much about putting perk cards in the wrong spots, once you get over level 50 you can move you’re special points around and redo your whole build if you need to
---
Its a game.
---
I'd love to have her in my camp but she's dirty af (literally), like she came straight out of mud pool and I don't tolerate it lol
---
i feel the same, weve never really seen them in force since f3 and subsequently defeated.
---
That's awesome of you!
---
You try and find the nuka cola dome key to get the stash. Also try to get the nuka cola quantum plans.
---
Thanks, can't win them all. Just unfortunate she did that for my first nuke.
---
God I love how fucking wholesome this stupid game is lol.
---
If you miss the tape, Pennington will give it to you now. I seem to remember there being a way to get the tape outside of the vault as well before Wastelanders.

Yeah, I like the tree, the stars wallpaper and the fireplace door.  I litterally don't care about anything else.  I will never use any of the skins/paints or other deco, and I doubt I'll get the door.
---
Chinese Stealth Suit makes it pretty easy, just launched my first nuke solo at 65.
---
Depend on what you have, someone may be very interested. There was a massive dupe and now many people have legacy rolls. These people usually want ones they don’t already have. What do you have?
---
Don't think it should, but if worried I'd swap my bld25 handmade for yours so you don't have to worry about it any more.
---
I saw a Angry Turtle vid or Captainnoob vid on it. I could easily be wrong though. I never purchased it
---
I play on XB1 :(. But thanks for the recommendations! I’ll be sure to look into them, the perks and all that. Thank you m!
---
I want to see it as well! I always appreciate good a good camp build.
---
My bloodied deathclaw gauntlet. Along with sneak 3 and ninja 3. A glowing meat steak. Ya guai ribs. Whiskey,and psycho I usually do about 2,000 damage when I punch her face. I know there are plenty of more food and drugs I could take. But the ones I mentioned I use are the easiest to find.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
A mean number of legendaries?  You mean they spawn around the casa often?
---
This event is usually where I break out the Commie Whacker and hit the leader dogs first. That way, the low level player can kill the leader, get a legendary , then I give them the legendary I get from looting the same dead dog. You can really make a low level players day if they get three legendary items and then you give them three more.
---
Oh really?! I thought once you get all the perk cards you’d snt change them?
---
I made a fortified porta potty blueprint in adventure mode that I just plop down in NW whenever the game wants me to increase my overseer rank. I have zero interest in PVP and have consistently ended up in the top 10 by literally hiding in a toilet and moving it every now and then.
---
Are you PC? Will trade if you have any bloodied
---
Doesn't that really only apply to the clean version?
---
Yeah I don’t like relying on my luck because I know it’ll take me thousands of rolls to get something I’d use
---
I stand corrected... I will now step down and let someone else carry on this conversation. 
---
To Touche salesman (I too have an uncle)
---
I won’t be thanking myself, I’ll thank you guys for the advice. I’m definitely going to stack on modules from now until I need them
---
I don’t like counting on my luck because it’s very bad, I’ll just stick up on modules
---
I appreciate the offer and the concern. If it becomes too worrisome, I'll go back to using my FFR/FR or E/90.
---
How long does it take if you were to do it every day?
---
That's how people sell ammo and plans to the venders!
---
I sell a bottle of nukashine for (only) 4999 caps, and some shotgun shells for 1cap a piece. I only have it so people can fast travel.
---
Game was rigged from the start.
---
Once you hit lvl 50 you stop getting special points but you can move them and get new perk cards still. I switched my whole build at level 80 from rifleman to heavy gunner because I got a really good .50 cal so I moved all my points from perception to strength and got all the heavy gunner perks. Also I based my build of a youtuber named angry turtle, he has the best fo76 content about builds and helped me a lot
---
Think that’s all of them. I gave up on Kill a Player (I’ve made one kill in ten levels, I am not good at this), Kill a Creature (typically requires too many creatures) and Pick a Lock (everyone floods the areas with locks).
---
Deploy a camp is lovely, I get some Score right off the bat, then go play a round.
---
Level up is easy, but time consuming if you die early (more below).
---
Three Stimpaks is decent, if you find the stims. I leg it around buildings smash and grabbing until I find three, then hare off to the boundary. Walk into the storm, walk out, use a stim. Repeat. Get Score. Go back to playing the round.
---
Honestly the worst part of NW is the pre-match. Wait five minutes to find a game. Wait another five for the players and map voting. Another two while the map loads. Get unlucky with your spawn and get capped three minutes in, and out of 15 minutes, you spent 3 playing. If it could cycle you into another deploy phase immediately, it would cut down the frustration immensely. I actually quite like NW, but not enough to spend all day in lobbies.
---
ETA: The NW and Adventure level up challenges are poorly designed, in that rather than levelling their mains (takes too long) they encourage players to create burner characters in both modes just to do the challenge.
---
A “play x minutes” one might have been better.
---
Since when is it a pvp event?
---
Unless I'm teamed with a low level I find it hard to do this unless I am teamed with one to do this with.lol
---
Does fudge muppet also do F076 builds?
---
Riveting conversation as always.
---
Who needs to do that when you have unyielding plus backpacks!
---
"burning sensation", like a rash ?
---
It eats a ton of budget, and cant be scrapped.
---
I used it once. I still just drop unwanted ammo on the ground.
---
I killed my buddy with it in SS t65 power armor in about 1.5 seconds.
---
Just buy those assaultron recall circuit boards and trigger the encryptid event, you’ll get it eventually. I’m still trying to get the sheepsquatch helmet from the event and I’m level 250😢 but I got the fixer plan like my second time doing the event
---
I do this not even to troll but just because ammo weighs nothing and you never know when you'll run out of ammo for the guns you have later in the game (have to drop a gun because of weight, have to burn a ton of ammo on the Grafton monster trying to give away your hiding place).
---
Have definitely won games using a gun I found with less than 10 people left that I luckily had 300 rounds of ammo for already.
---
You can actually add deathclaw steaks or stingwing filet to your list for additional +2 Strength. Also I frequently use Radant beer for instant +50 carryweight if I overencumbered and need to fast travel
---
Wrong sub, bud. Use the trade subs.
---
How does it work since you have the 110 damage cap. Does the radiation damage and its normal damage get dealt separately?
---
I’ve never heard of them, I usually just watch angry turtles videos
---
What? That was never a thing.
---
One ammo factory takes 0.5% of the budget... but it cant be moved/removed and it can ghost that space in your budget forever. So ppl do it in workshop area.
---
Alright, I’ll be sure to watch him! Thanks for the tips, now I don’t have to stress about leveling up. Thank you!
---
Do you at least use the "no" emote?
---
Because I've seen a lot of new players that must be REALLY new, because when they see me "come here" emote, drop a grave stone, aim at it, and light it up with my plasma flamer, they run away.
---
Now that I type it out, I guess I can see how that might seem a little threatening, but some get it, and collect my junk.
---
Every now and then I get a no emote, and I just assume it's a fresh alt.
---
Since always
---
I’ve never helped a low level simply because they were low level. I don’t understand why people want to. To me it ruins the experience and makes for a dumb player who doesn’t learn how to survive in the game when the game really gets hard
---
Pics or didn't happen.
---
I mean, that's great and all that you had this experience, but it would have been nice to actually see what you take so much pride in.
---
Side Note: What the fuck is it with players that take the time to nicely furnish their homes only to just lock it up and have their stores outside for others. It's very unwelcoming.
---
I thought I read that people were getting 600 vault scrap as part to make up for a bug deleting scrap. I was just curious if it’s still a thing
---
Xbox
---
What are you even talking abiut
---
I honestly don't know. But I know it melts people. Especially bloodied builds. My buddy was at full health when I killed him trying it out.
---
Were you impacted by a bug over a year ago?
---
You can have chicken in your Camp?
---
I thought super duper does have an impact on armor or did they change that.
---
That was when players has their scrap deleted by the game when it first launched.
---
This isn’t a trading sub
---
No the bus will be the bad guys everyone seems to jave rose glasses from f3 but keep in mind the brotherhood kill for what they want
---
Equip a shot gun each pellet that hits counts as a crit
---
&gt;but I'm afraid of getting banned
---
Than dont try it.
---
But it can be done?
---
What do you mean by Magic?
---
Just ... why?
---
Its not bad imo. I've only played 1 match just bc I love the main game so much tho. I hear so many people complain about it, this looks alot like bait. In any case, prepare for downvotes bc you have an opinion they don't like.
---
Ah ok, that was what I was looking for, I wasn’t sure if they still included it. Thank you.
---
Yes but it can't be the games will to create a new Charakter each time this challenge is active, you know
---
Probably figured better to consolidate everyone into fewer servers
---
As much as I want extra camp budget allotment, paying for it is NOT the way to go. They're already nickel and diming us on everything else, they should just update their game to be playable by everyone, not just the paying members. Id argue the scrap box should even be in base game. They were just lazy with that too.
---
In what way? If you’re going to send an interdepartmental memo we need more information
---
I’m CERTAIN half the skins weren’t meant to be given away for this but they didn’t have anything else. It’s also pisses me off since I subjugated myself to get to rank 15 on NW just for the ghillie suit just for them to throw 10 more my way
---
All my shit was naturally farmed fresh from the early days of the game.  I was a day one player.  I had bloodied explosive Gatling plasmas &amp; laser rifles.  A few other things.  Is there a way to dupe items now?  Legally or illegally.  I don’t care.  I’ll never play this game again.
---
Yes
---
yep
---
Understocked,  mounted plans , rad x , .38 .44. .50 caliber balls c'mon
---
Damn, you're right. Hadn't even thought about the cap. Yeah we need an overhaul of legendary perks. A lot need to be made legacy and we need more variation.
---
Yeah I know, I like this over the Settler vs. Raider good vs. evil scenario. Just two morally grey militant factions trying to complete their objectives. My body is ready
---
I have no idea why they didn’t add 9 daily challenges for Adventure, 9 for Nuclear Winter, and have Score awarded for the first 9 you completed.
---
I guarantee I forgot that minor detail. Logging on to check now.
---
Edit: yup. That was it.
---
Lolol’d
---
I've been on both sides, after an especially hard grind  of not getting the item u need it's nice of those willing to part with an item u need. On the flip, to not even try to grind and stalk people for items? I think your missing the point of the game
---
Maybe you’re finding the wrong camps.
---
My highest was actually 23. It's pretty common tho if I'm playing on Morgantown to make arround 10 kills.
---
___
---
 I'm playing solo at the airport, so I don't have any mates stealing my kills. I also have a route I always run to get many crates and locked items and even always spawn righ next to one. 
---
Just because you aren't that good (or maybe you are and I'm wrong) dosent mean I don't have to be this good. Since I'm always done with PvE Content in like 2 to 4 weeks I only play PvP (Adventure and Nuclear Winter and even Survival back then)
---
Same, except I dump it in blue suitcases at train stations.
---
I would if the building actually worked.
---
There's a set of stairs that I can't delete or place anything on and it just demotivated me.
---
And lets not forget the overpriced trash outfits that are littered throughout the game
---
Instead of continually trying to find ways around this problem, I'm surprised more people don't just instead leave feedback for Bethesda to have the legendary/loot system changed.
---
This problem could be fixed so easily by the devs, it boggles the mind that it's still an issue that hasn't been resolved.
---
Everyone who takes part in the event should be able to loot all the enemies spawned for that event. Simples.
---
Vats hasn't really worked in PVP since Wastelanders release, no confirmation if it's a bug or intentional just silence
---
I'll be sending an invite, too. My gamertag is Elizabah. Most likely sending invite tomorrow evening.
---
I know but time consuming on a high level char
---
Yeah, it’s because it’s +50% hunger and thirst,, even though it’s a bad thing the game sees the + and thinks it’s positive so it does nothing
---
Are there walls attached nearby if so delete
---
Whatever you get remember: nocturnal rolling pins are OP.
---
No. Just some stairs on a foundation.
---
Neither can be moved or deleted. 
---
Will have to move the whole camp and just can't be fucked.
---
I was buying 3\* weapons trying to get a Bloodied item.  After burning through 1000 scrip two times in a row and getting mostly crap I decided to go for 2\* weapons which are half the price.  I figure even if I manage to get a bloodied 3\* at least one of the other stats isn't going to be all that great.  With that in mind it would make more sense to have 20 attempts at getting a bloodied 2\* that will be usable than only getting 10 selections and not getting anything good at all.  I did the same with 2\* armor and quickly got some very nice unyielding pieces.  Since then I've been able to upgrade some armor pieces from player vendors to very good 3\* unyielding so now all I have to do is try to get the epic weapon.  That said, I'm convinced I'm only going to find the weapon I want from another player.  I've been getting enough decent 3\* drops to sell that I have to worry more about not going over the cap stash than not having enough to buy a weapon I might want.
---
Dity white asylum outfit 500 capzzzz
---
Not anymore. They patched it and said it was never supposed to give tick blood.
---
I'd argue this is the same approach Zenimax showed with housing in ESO.
---
It's taken nearly three years now for them to finally add a system for both NPCs and pathing for said NPCs to homes so that they no longer look barren and lifeless. 
---
Meanwhile, we've had a slow stream of the occasional themed set of furniture for each yearly DLC update. And a few achievement or funky items here or there, mostly Crown Store exclusive HD/handmade items compared to 5 reskins with light color pallet changes.
---
A lot of people don't like devoting the large amount of time needed for big camp builds. Especially since camp building is purely superficial.
---
I love base building, but I have a few friends that hate dropping a lot of time on something that doesn't help you do more damage.
---
Man im sorry
---
Do you have a heap of holotapes and notes in storage or on you? I had similar issues until I dropped all the ones I didn't need anymore, doesn't clear up any actual space, but I believe with it having to track less items it increases performance when using your stash etc.
---
Garyyyy❤
---
Add floor to the top of the stairs, and remove them again. Always works for me.
---
I think you get pts but that might just be on the bethesda.net version not really any other major difference except you get that i know of but i'm pretty sure you can have custom loading screens and i believe you have a max of 100 compared to the 50 on xbox
---
And perfectly preserved pies being anything over zero caps. You can get a free one on top of West Tek. Or outfits and headgear that spawns everywhere in the game. Stop trying to sell common junk, go sell that to a bot for caps.
---
be like boba and get there first
---
I sell the most used for 1 cap in my vendor. 2 caps for the rarer but still used ammo. 0 caps for .38 and 10mm. I get cleared out about once a play sesssion.
---
Right?! I'm sitting at max carry weight of 385 and just my default weight is like 145 before picking up stuff.
---
It irks me that they removed atom dailies for this (unless I'm wrong). Forces you to accept more useless and often broken cosmetics vs just buying what you want in the atom store. I bet they know this and are doing it for $$$.
---
Always room  for one more in the cell
---
Are they even transferable?
---
" Do not become addicted to water it will take hold of you and you will resent its absence ".
---
that's one hell of an Easter egg
---
Yeah one of the SCORE rewards is a chicken coop which makes fertilizer (rather have wings)
---
The splinter faction of the Enclave in the region was murdered by MODUS who claims to be the Enclave but isn't really.  He's just a crazy AI.
---
What do you mean? Like transfer Thru characters? Yeah I’ve transfer things from my older characters many times.
---
This is how I do it; Fast travel to Morgantown station, walk towards the airport, kill the first scorched carrying a shotgun, pick up the shotgun, use it to VATS-kill all the rest of the scorched, pressing the crit button every time it pops. You'll usually be done in one pass, it's taken me two at the most.
---
I can understand that but at least put a power connector and light bulb down, not everyone plays with max gamma like some weird mutant with Darkvision.
---
If you invite them to a non public team they can
---
No he's right, there's a huge wave of trash camps right now and not just because they're low level. On PC tonight I went to a lvl 982 camp and it had garbage for sale. Looked like a shitty UFO too. Whenever there's junk for sale, I turn off all their lights and electronics. I like changing the colors of people bulbs too.
---
We are 76ers, we are the elites, fuck BoS!
---
Never seen slippers.  Never tried them with ghillie though.
---
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
---
I was so happily surprised with how good that movie was.
---
Closest feeling i got to this was during fasnacht. I had my camp placed on the corner lot of helvetia. It’s a nice regular looking two story barn. But the main attraction was my Harambe shrine.
---
Now it was during fasnatch were i deadass saw people taking pictures infront of my “d!cks out for harambe” sign. You could see them either draw out a camera or shuffle through the different photomode poses.
---
Try restarting the game, I had the same thing happen and a restart fixed it. I'm on PC.
---
Yeah, I built one thinking it would be super useful for me but it’s not worth it. Even if you don’t mind suffering through the process, the amount of ammo you get for the points you accumulate is terrible
---
Yeah. There batter be a way for me to snub the Boringhood of Steel.
---
Thanks for responding. I’ll give it a try.
---
So help me understand what people look for in a good seller?
---
English chap; about yay high?
---
May you have icyhot placed on your underwear.
---
Haha nice!
---
It took us forever (it seemed) to even get the KNOWN added 🤷‍♀️😆
---
And 15 various boosts lost from 5x 3*. I notice the massive drop in AP regen not to mention everything else. 
---
Each to their own however. Good option if you don't want to invest the time gathering your dream 5pc.
---
I get a few (rare) compliments from how my camps look (usually just a lived in looking house, taking inspiration from my own home, my dad’s home and my nana and papas old folk home)
---
But i came across one camp that was like a road checkpoint up top, barricades, medical tent, the works and this really cool hidden bunker under it
---
Like, it looked like it was made for a group of NCR role players since everyone there was in ncr gear while the owner had the elite ranger gear on. It was really nice!
---
New recipes can't be traded, but there is a settler trader that you can find that has them without rep gate
---
Where does it spawn? Also that’s stupid. The bow bp can.
---
I carry a gamma gun to irradiate myself. The gun is light, and I just have to shoot at my feet.
---
There's 2 things people want;
---
1) High tier gear for well under the current going value.....
---
2) Drugs, cheap legendaries for easy scrip, and ammo crafting mats. This is the style I run. I'd actually say the majority of my sales are for ammo crafting mats. Steel, acid and lead in huge quantities.
---
Need to see a Doc for that mate.
---
Or run into the fire
---
Have a bloodied ffr auto and it roars thru 10 spikes in 1/4 a sec.   Takes a bit to reload though and its vats only.  Great gun with those effects in vats.
---
How do you use photomode to get in? I always just look for something I can interact with through a window. Also spoiled meat is good, but I always leave raw fertilizer and a "Notice of expulsion" note on their bed lol.
---
Did you take the clothes off my bartender tonight?
---
I’ve experienced this too. I think it’s something to do with a desync between the server and your game client.
---
Here is me putting 3 gauss shotty mags and 2 radium rifle mags into a guy whos health kept rubber banding back. https://youtu.be/yOKDAVtS-s8
---
I used it after I first got it.  I decided to convert all of my other ammo (a few thousand rounds of pretty much every type of ammo) to .45.  It took about two hours.  That was very painful and annoying, and the small amount of ammo it ended up giving me for that much time and effort was not worth it.  I have not used it since.  The main reason I still have it is because Bethesda has announced they are working on releasing a fix soon, which will make the process faster.  I certainly hope they change the interface, so you can just select the number of rounds you want to convert, then convert all of that type of ammo at once.  I would even be fine with the same low conversion ratio that is in the game now, if I can just select how many rounds I want to convert and just convert them at once.
---
I'm pretty much the same, I build my camps to look good and inviting, I even do videos on my builds lol I do get a couple of people going "wow" looking around and doing the heart or thumbs up emote, I even once got a message saying "great camp!! This gave me an idea!!" And I honestly love it, my OTT, sticking the middle finger up at what's supposed to be survival CAMPs actually inspire people lol 
---
I try and avoid doing builds that I know others do and try to be unique in my own way
---
My current build is essentially a 2 story house, first floor being some mounts, couple of pelts (Deathclaw and bear) as well as displays and whatnot with Daguerre to the left of my door on the second floor I have the big bedroom with the megasloth pelt and I also have a sofa with a TV and the Sheepsquatch plushie on the left side of the sofa (reason was my character and Daguerre are romanced and idk I do a thing where it adds a more home feel to it, my mind is still thinking of ideas I could add) on the roof I have 3 flags and the artillery cause why not lol
---
To the right of the house I have the red rockrt garage with all the maintenance stuff for weapons armour etc there, all fit snugly lol and next to it my Vendor/bar that has a Nukashine keg as well as the punch bowl 
---
In the middle I have 4 chairs and one of those pit fires think it's a NW reward and where the sand is, I have a child like play area with the rides and the spaceship thing from the legendary run and nearby that next to the pit fire I have 3 monuments (Mothman, standing gorilla and the one that explodes like a Nuke)
---
On the other side of the path I have a Lantern and the loveseat, it has a good view of the house and at night, it has that romantic feel around it thanks to the lighting 
---
It's hard to explain tbh lol here's the link if you're interested: https://youtu.be/Y2qNsnSd52M
---
I tend to go all out and if you think this CAMP was good or even OTT.. you should see the CAMP I had before I rebuilt itc lol I did a vid on every CAMP I made and I believe I put them all in a playlist together for ease of access
---
Or just have them appear at the bottom of the list instead of the top. I hate having to scroll through hundreds of "Knowns" at a vendor before I can get to the stuff I'm actually interested in.
---
Yeah, I keep trying to encourage them to make more elaborate builds. Even to the degree where I happily offer to help them build their base.
---
In my group I'm the electrician. Nobody understands how the line conduits work, they set up hundreds of wall conduits and make wire spiderwebs, so I come in and set up their electrical grid.
---
Some people ain't creative types.
---
I just sell them for dirt, dirt cheap....
---
People snatch em up for easy scrip.
---
Do I need one?
---
You mean the a button simulator?
---
What's more ridiculous are the shoulder pads, the "secret service" shoulder pads that makes you look like a fucking football player.
---
I hereby demand that you return for Meat Week.
---
Yes!!!  Something like this is desperately needed.
---
.45, 5.56, 5mm ammo. Maybe some fuel and plasma cores. Rare items sometimes but I get that you want to keep them. Good armor and weapons that's all 3* and lvl 50. Basically if you can pick it up off a shelf everyday, don't put it in your vendor. We all have that junk. All ammo should be 1 cap each unit. Serums under 500. Some people like stealthboys and nuke cards. Good consumables. 
---
If you have a perfectly preserved pie for more than the travel cost to West Tek where I can get one for free unlimited times, I take everything from your unlocked containers and leave. Even ammo if you left it unlocked.
---
It is a random spawn, I've seen the vendor on the west coast of the forest (north of the farms, I honestly couldn't give you the exact spot) but I've been told people have found it randomly in the foundation as well
---
Omg I had forgotten about the secret fireplace!!! Duuuuude, I only recently redid my camp too!! Lol I already have an idea on what to put behind there
---
No, didn't know you could do that.
---
In the parking lot by General's Steakhouse there's a car with a curved plywood ramp leading over its roof and on the other side is a crashed bicycle and a skeleton. Nice try, kid.
---
I got it from powering up Poseidon energy plant
---
Do you think I can sever hop to get it?
---
The photomode glitch is also what I use when I launch nukes, to skip the boring unnecessary bulls%*+
---
Get as close to the door as possible. Use photomode. While in photomode (use your left analog stick to move forward, try to zoom in as close as Possible to the door your character is touching with their face. While still pushing the analog stick forward, hold it and back out of photomode. It should bypass the door and you will be inside. It might take a few tries for you to get the hang of it. But it will get easier with time. 
---
Also works when you want to sneak in the room the robot vendor is behind of. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to get inside the same room as the mole miner vendor yet. 
---
If you’re on PS4 I can show you.
---
User name checks out for promoting Meat Week.
---
lol, whatever. I don't even play any Bethesda games besides Fallout, not even Elder Scrolls. Fantasy isn't my jam (save for Dungeons and Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun on Sega Genesis, too many hours poured into that as a kid).
---
There's tons of bugs and things about Fallout 76 I don't like, but I'm not going to pretend like it's a terrible game either. I've poured 400 hours into this game in the last 3 months. Covid shutdown helped, but if the game wasn't good I would've stopped after 100 hours for sure.
---
Omg yes! I made a Solcum Joe's dinner recently and I made sure to use conduits in it. Looks so clean and the lighting does wonders.
---
Even before on the house I had I made sure to use them.
---
Something I noticed recently too is that the conduit lights don't count toward your light count.
---
Two shot is a really inaccurate weapon effect. Likely the VATS makes it so full damage instead of it only hitting with a single bullet.
---
That’s my theory. But if you run Concentrated Fire, you can line up headshots pretty easily and it’s a good way to do a lot of damage
---
I just completed the Wastelanders questline today, and played my first non-Score matches of NW. I don't have any interest in PvP, but now that I have the Ghillie Suit, I just try to see how long I can bush wookie. 
---
Ended up in 3rd place, and the other 2 players were super pissed they couldn't find me for so long.
---
A full set of Assassin/Sentinal/AP refresh armor is anything but worthless. The word awesome comes to mind.
---
Love it. You say you'll never move it.... But I just saw some junk walls and such in the PTS Atomic Shop.... I needs them. 
---
I also use the cluttered collector/scavenger look often. It just fits the setting so well. Also the seedy shed is such a great little prefab. One of my favourites.
---
Idk, I'm not 100%sure if it is a random event or a patrolling mob like grahm
---
Neither did I but I came back to camp and he was in his underwear.  Maybe it was a bug. Was thinking my camp vendor wasn’t up to par.  I don’t have much to sell yet.  I pretty much just sell all the ammo I don’t use and duplicate plans right now.  Almost at 50 though.
---
Hmm ok.
---
Always has been.
---
Locked doors are just asking to be picked. Don't fear the *wanted*. That or find a way to glitch in. This is the wasteland, anyone with locked doors has something to hide. Lol
---
I’ve only been playing the game since wastelanders, and I never really dove into until about a month ago, so far I’ve had really good luck and met a lot of friendly people, these things are always going to happen in these games, that’s just part of it sadly. But overall this has been a really great and helpful community.
---
Yeah - not very user friendly.  I prefer the ammo maker I got from the crater.
---
It sounds like you just got loot from the queen because you were on a team. I launched a nuke, and when I fast traveled my internet died and kicked me off the server. I was able to rejoin my team right as the SBQ was killed. Was surprised when I went up to the queen and was able to loot her.
---
I’ll trade for some I’m on Xbox
---
I'd you're really curious, everyone's level is listed in the team menu and chances are good the owner of the camp you're looking at is on a team.
---
I'm on PC so hopefully it will work the same way on there. Thanks for such a good explanation. I'll do some testing on one of the robot vendors, that sounds like fun.
---
Edit: Dude that was so easy, it worked on my first try. Now I can hang out with the robots.
---
I’m really glad to hear that:) this community is amazing, I hope you stick around
---
I've done some, and others I've outright ignored. It depends on the challenge and if I can be arsed.
---
Placing camps is easy, for example, and even stims only takes me a few minutes.
---
But gaining a level or killing players? Yeah, I'm good thanks.
---
Best action movie change my mind
---
AFAIK the only way to loot the queen is to individually meet the damage cap.  Open to being wrong here but that’s how I’ve always seen it.
---
I love when people come in my camp while I'm cooking and give the heart emote after checking out my living/dining room and my magazine and Mr. Fuzzy displays.
---
I built my camp around the "Jeep" by Clancy Manor and built a garage with my workbenches around it, and a few weeks ago a guy with the Aviator Suit from the atom shop hopped in to the driver seat and motioned me over, so me wearing the Silver Shroud outfit and Chinese Stealth Suit helmet stood in the back at parade rest like some technocrat dictator. It made for a great photo.
---
If you sort by weight it will push the new ones towards the top
---
No one has answered my questions.  Have these type weapons been put back in the game?
---
I'd rather have the elevator lol that and some of the circuits systems xon xoff etc.
---
That doesn't explain why we don't have more wall or roof skins. The wallpapers are nice, but after almost two years, we've only gotten one new type of wall and roof type each. I don't understand the lack of effort for something that many players would immediately be willing to buy. It seems to be both a combination of issues with code and the fact that the entire game was copy/pasted by Beth's C-Team as their first project, but also a lack of clear direction from the management side.
---
I’d buy modules. Modified base guns will get you through the game just fine but it’s gonna be an RNG slog to get bond items with rolls you want.
---
Ever sence 4 the games have been very pretty.
---
We can't fast travel to a blast zone, but we can spawn in one. It is really annoying.
---
Just try the stealth armor fix till you get out and switch back while sneaking. It works for me most of the time. Unless I spawn directly inside the fissure then there is no hope!
---
jUsT dO a BlOodIeD HeAvY pA bUIlD iNsTEaD
---
Here's how I think it works, just a theory of mine.
---
Standard shot hits get assessed as Damage minus objects resistance.
---
Vats shots get assessed as Damage AND Vats critical damage possibility being added, then minus objects resistance.
---
When having to do VATS critical shots, pull out a shotgun, activate VATS, if your meter is full activate critical shot, and EACH pellet gets checked for critical hits, sometimes one shotgun shell will pull 8 critical hits at once.
---
It wasn't equipped. I had just never selected before on level up. I did not realize you could only see it at level up
---
No but there was a duping method that was in game last week or the one before that then people got banned but then they where let back in and kept there weapons the dupe doesn’t work anymore but I’m sure there is ways. I played since beta but I stopped after beating main story back then and I dropped all my legendaries that I thought where useless being I used that carry weight glitch and I was like 3k overweight so I don’t have any legacies
---
He can ketchup then.
---
Bow plans are definitely not transferable, I never tried bow mods, I would guess not.
---
kids these don't know the struggle of buying an expensive plan only to find out you already knew it
---
I’m stuck with the damn things unless I want to build my camp again.
---
(Yes it’s me).
---
If you can craft a bright headlamp helm I'll trade you a high cap plan for it or caps
---
I thought so too. I think it changed with the legendary race. I notice I find a lot more loot off of mobs as well, knowing I didn't tag them but being on a team. And, it happen twice that day. The second time I got off maybe 50 rounds, disconnected, rejoined and boom loot from the SBQ.
---
I’d be interested in duping all my good shit and giving it all away to as many people as possible.
---
damn, I never knew that was supposed to be a PvP event. I've only been playing since May, but every time I've gone there no one else has shown up, I've just run around killing all the ghouls. I farm it once in a while for xp, but I've noticed the last couple of times I go the mask is stuck on my character after I leave, and I have to server hop to get it back to normal.
---
Guess I've been lucky/unlucky nobody else ever shows up. People really aren't into the PvP it seems (except those playing NW)
---
Oooo if you want to run into more toxic players - add me! I provide a wide assortment of griefing services: anything from pvping you when you are trying to claim a workshop all the way to using explosive bait to destroy your camp! I am limited in that I cannot yet nuke your camp, but that feature is coming in 3 weeks (once I figure out how to do it). In the meantime, I give you my guarantee that my griefing will cause you to flip a table or your money back!
---
(Disclaimer: The term 'flipping a table' may or may not constitute an actual table. Simply imagining yourself flipping an imaginary table is sufficient to fulfill the obligation of this contract).
---
There's a way to get rid of them?
---
I'm adding you too. I wanna see your camp.
---
Wtf is magic?
---
That’s what I’m hoping to run into people. Since they unbanned every high level player has them but none are selling them. I’m sure there is a way to dupe right now just it’s not public being once it goes public they patch it out
---
Go grief the dude that stole my friends stuff lol
---
Someone had a similar issue with a staircase, leaving server or turning off game worked for them.
---
I ran across this low level player struggling to build his CAMP. I also noticed that he was wearing a hodge podge of different armor pieces. So Inoffered to team up, to help him a little. So I made him a set of combat armor up to his level. And gave him the materials to finish his CAMP. He then starts asking me for ammo and weapons. Like the one I was using. I said no, because I use it. Then he asked if I would build him a radio shower. As If.
---
I still haven’t discovered Bog Town...:
---
Hmmmm that may be, maybe we’ll get more data in the near future.  Glad I’m not the only one that was surprised.  I honestly just went for the xp.  I didn’t mind burning ammo as I’m fueling my alt via my main character.
---
BoS get the plasma hose, no exceptions  😡
---
say no more, when does it start?
---
How dare you question the holy and mighty Todd.  It just works.
---
;)
---
I did that TOO! I missed lv 69 though.
---
This is always fun, I don't often get people on the mic but it's always awesome to get a thumbs 8p or a heart from another player after they roam your camp.
---
Maybe I'll add you too, we ca. exchange looks at each others camps. :D
---
They could always just leave the game.
---
didnt bethesda make oblivion? sounds like they're just hella lazy and losing their good game streak.
---
You also run faster /w weapon holstered (unless you have a perk that boosts speed while using a specific weapon type).  Avoiding dying to the fire is honestly not all that different than other BR:  Be mindful of the timer, if you're on the "fat"side of the old circle that is collapsing then the fire wall moves faster and slower on the thin side, disengage or avoid firefights if it will make it so you can't avoid the fire.  That is every BR from PUBG to Warzone.
---
You have to move your camp.
---
They get automatically scrapped from your existing stored items so you’re good to go apparently.
---
But I like my little free states compound so much I don’t want to rebuild it AGAIN...yet :(
---
Source: There were no clean sea captains.
---
Those Thanksgiving displays *are* good. Makes my camp. Lol.
---
Alright, I'll try that. Thank you! :)
---
Nah, mr fuzzy tokens and the dirty outfit were one of the first things to get duped in the early 2019 waves. Most people who have one got it through illegitimate means, very few people actually grinded up to 450 tokens
---
I miss Fasnacht so much!
---
I selected it at last level up. Maybe you should not make assumptions either like so many people here seem to do.
---
Hope it helps, before that I would end up move my camp losing all progress..
---
Oh. I thought they permanently ate CAMP budget and screwed that character up permanently - which seemed fair for exploiting the game to get free ammo
---
me too! i was so into it, i bought that fasnacht day bundle from the bethesda store, then i started to hate it when i kept getting the berets lmao
---
More than likely you'll be used to 'assist' the BoS to get their presence in WV sorted. But with the 'Broken Steel' event making me think that your allegiance to either Raiders or Settlers might come into play, means whatever happens with Steel Dawn isn't going to mean a huge shift in play longterm
---
Main reason people don't run the event is because they hate PvP/are terrified of participating in it. This event removes the cap loss penalty for getting killed by another player so you just need to make sure you don't have any junk on you and there's literally no penalty for dying outside of the loading screen. It can actually be a fantastic event for farming legendaries. I've had runs with more than 10 legendaries spawn in and they are often 3*s.
---
I started playing again after over 6 months away, with wastelanders, so I completely missed out on them. I'm jealous whenever I see them.
---
Bruh I’m a level 140 and I can’t scrip my legendarys faster than I get them.
---
Private server, airport workshop, 1 fusion reactor per 5 machines. If you plan it right fits 60-65 machines comfortably. Hypothetically speaking *of course*
---
That’s why I give them away lol they just take up space
---
This happened to me one time and the player gave me a legendary tesla rifle. I had a little Slocum's &amp; Beckett's near The Wayward for a bit. Its so great to have people openly appreciate your camp after hours of meticulously placing everything lol
---
right on,  I've had mixed success with the legendaries. Some runs have been good but I've had several runs where I got no legendary ghouls... c'est la vie.
---
I feel that, just never crosses my mind and a lot of low levels won’t really know what to do with that stuff or where to scrip it.
---
I got this today, for the first time, what a bummer, on the last fricken day!
---
I enjoy it too but it's filled with cheaters which brings it down sometimes
---
ah it worked, sweet.
---
Yeah, it’s kinda funny that power armor doesn’t have an equivalent, or an innate reduction against explosive damage
---
I think people should start a new trend to "forget" your mic is on and say nice things :)
---
I think you just invented a new fad, C.A.M.P tourism
---
its kinda a running joke, but once you hit 500 hours the game will almost immediately become a dumpster fire. it takes about 500 hours for the average player(myself included) to realize the failings of fo76.
---
i was like you, i defended the game all they way up till i hit 500 hours, and mannnn i dont know what it was, but when i hit that mark i was just DONE with the game. i came back for wastelanders, and it wasnt even close to enough for me to stay. 
---
give it 100 more hours. thats like a month of gameplay in covid time. youll see.
---
Few weeks ago while duping was rampant I traded for my dream guns now the grind is kinda meh.now I get excited when I get a odd drop like a shiskebob or bbat
---
I couldn't agree more, I known they money to keep the game going but damn wood armor skins .. it is a bit insulting 🙂
---
I accidentally did this when I was trying my new mutant bloodied Melee build, I sent them all messages saying sorry and explaining it was a genuine accident
---
As a new player I really like checking out people’s camps as I come across them, the creatively on display is amazing. But I’m too scared to build up a nice camp again after my first one was ruined by the “Cannot place item: Needs support (even though the outline is green” error. I’ll wait until endgame to find a permanent place to build I guess 😞
---
Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
---
Just bought the game and that is happening on my Xbox have you found any solution?
---
Um, hey Drussell41, can I please have some ammo??? I am a newbee and I need some 2mm ECs and Plasma cores for my.... um... pipe pistols. Also could I get some ballistic fiber to repair my.... um leather?
---
Pretty please with a cherry on top?
---
This was very cool and funny, thank you.
---
Hey now! The term 'bum' is hurtful! I prefer 'Lazy opportunist' thank you very much!
---
Where do you even find 3 scorchbeasts?
---
I feel ya. It literally takes an average of 2.5 hours for me to add 20 items to my machines. I have been timing it for the last few weeks. It is so frustrating. It's been like that since just about the beginning of my game, last year, for me. It doesn't happen for either of my toons, though. They are both as full as my main so it's not a storage issue.
---
If it’s just a kid, he might not understand the ways in which he is being annoying. If you do end up blocking him/unfriending him, I’d advise telling him why first. It’s possible he genuinely doesn’t know, and if that’s the case, he’ll just go find another player to nag. Some kids don’t understand subtlety at all, so “nah sorry I don’t have ammo” is just an invitation to ask later. Tell him why what he’s doing is shitty as nicely as you can, and then leave it at that.
---
That’s one thing, I run a really high damage bloodied so I have to be careful too. But some genuinely don’t care
---
This times a million
---
I'm on XB1 and I love it, personally. I've probably spent more hours in NW than the main game. My only issue is how long it takes to get into a new game.
---
Omg so much fact!!!!
---
Mama dulces usually has like 6 or 7 boxes inside, and on roof. And oddly fee people spawn there. Sp ots a good place to get it done in one shot
---
see I dont actually know how young he actually is, his voice is...odd. ambiguous, he sounds anywhere from 12 to 16, ykno one of those nerdy voices that's kinda sorta deep so you cant tell, yeah. I think he understands why though but i definitely will tell him if I end up just getting rid of him
---
The plans themselves are not transferable but you can craft them with the mods attached and give them out. Same with the compound bow as well. At least as of a few weeks ago you could.
---
Nothing wrong with selling it for whatever price you want, but if a level 18 player came to my camp I would probably pull out of my vendor how much he wants and give him a "good" deal on it.
---
Only thing I disagree with is Frog Legs needing to be a mutation. It's fine as a perk
---
Kudos!
---
A friend of mine and I agree NW is our favorite Battle Royale out of all the well-known ones. To each their own, I guess
---
Hypothetically, it actually fits over double that...
---
Your admission to targeting and abusing trans individuals by stalking them over the internet.
---
Discrimination.
---
Human rights violation.
---
I’m probably not your idle chatter, but I do that with the group I play with and we know our chat is on. We know you’re there. We’re just going about our business appreciating the things we come across. Keep up the good work.
---
THIS is the real Fallout community.  😁💛  Unknown friends.
---
I've never actually killed the raider thief. I get to the location and he's already dead,(level 82 never got him once)
---
Throw a prisoner collar on him. 🤓
---
You were very unlucky, I've been lucky enough to get 2 awesome &amp; 1 decent bloodied gauntlets 3 times in my first 3 tries across 3 characters but no luck in ss armor though
---
As long as I get to play as a Brahmin!
---
Are you ok?
---
Did you pay the bartender the 300 caps to tell you it's Barb? Because just because YOU know it's Barb (Read it online somewhere probably)  doesn't mean that you character does.
---
Damn. Would love to see it, but I’m on PC. Pix mebbe?
---
I just did it to see if it worked.  I removed all my adhesive crops and put those in and then couldn’t delete them.
---
I’ll rebuild my camp tonight after the kids are asleep.
---
I don’t need the ammo at all.
---
I play a shotgun character so it’s 1 shot kills almost anything...I make ammo back off scorched because they often have sawn off shotguns and 6 ammo.
---
I have over 15000 shotgun shells from my other character and from buying at peoples camps.
---
I also crafted a shed load of .50 cal, 5.56, and .45 because I never have to craft my own.
---
Are the ammo makers convenient?  Hell yes.
---
But they only give like 40 shells every 10-15 minutes so I’d be much better off going to a private world and build a trillion at every workshop around the map rather than 2 in my camp.
---
Tl;dr; they are an advantage but not huge...unless you go back to your camp all the time.
---
My poor compound :(.
---
haha no it had just happened before I posted and Im on PC. I cant shoot guns with controllers I just cant
---
I've been wanting to build in a graveyard for some time, will need to check out the location (not a trap camp builder though).
---
I'd like to out myself in line too if you see someone by this username its me :)
---
There's only two mod spots on the bow, the sight and the frame. So you can only have one mod on the frame to change the effect and additional damage type. It's not technically a Legendary effect, it doesn't add another star. The Machete used to gain a star for the sacrificial blade mod because it added poison damage on top of bleed damage and regular damage, but that was patched a long time ago.
---
one hell of a Linda Blair impression though!
---
Even on my level 400+ i can level up at least once a day. You can also just create a new character and level up in like 5 or 10 minutes.
---
I think it was a joke using the title as a pun? Idk.
---
I coulda swore the PS4 servers are down....
---
No, I haven't. 
---
I can't anyways because everytime I try to she just ooens up her generic dialogue with no option to pay her the caps. (I declined the caps earlier)
---
Whitesprings.. A lot of people have been getting good roles there lately, some will only craft there now.
---
Yup. RNG at its best right there lol. 
---
I crafted a solid Bloodied Gauss Shotgun and Unyielding SS Chest Piece in fewer than five rolls... between the two! Then Gauntlet had me stuck for over 5000 scrip. The one in the picture is literally the first Bloodied version I’ve rolled.
---
I came back about a week and a half ago after not having played since Fasnacht and I think the Legendary Run makes it worth it as there are now two things to grind for, both XP and SCORE. I don’t play for hours at a time but I still try to hop on most days to do a few of the daily challenges. I’m still low level enough that it’s not a chore yet to try to level up once per day for the daily SCORE, so that’s my goal right now
---
Pleasure ensure your display case has a dish and a spoon.
---
I lost 4000 points today to auto complete. I hadn’t played since last night and my game was closed and console unplugged at the update time so it definitely wasn’t that. I’m legit pissed now because I likely won’t make the end without Atoms now. I don’t have time to spam the 10000 XP challenge to make up the difference.
---
Nice.
---
I wish people talking via game chat was more mainstream and not so buggy
---
Still no update unfortunately. Seems like it's intentional 😞
---
Double would be redundant, the better ammo weighs too much and doesn’t move fast enough to warrant the extra generator cost. Unless you’re making 50 cal. Again, *hypothetically*
---
It looks like a great place to have one. I’ve only been in that area once before when I had to make friends with a deathclaw for Rose 😂
---
They really have been. I'm in love with using the photo mode.
---
Bugged
---
It's that damn water cooled bonesaw he's been using.
---
I know, on one character it took a whole month of just scrapping &amp; trying to get a unyielding ss piece &amp; a month later he has a full set, all 2*
---
 Did you ever think that Bethesda Planned it to be this way? Nobody wants it, but almost always gets it. It is the perfect way to decrease the Legendary Pool.
---
Can you build my camp for me? I need help. My XBOX 1 gamertag: S1nnam0n
---
Having it condensed into one slot and having extra skin sets fill those gaps would likely be considered too much value. The seasonal system is already a big increase over how it used to be in that regard (albeit with less choice). More likely they'd just add extra filler items (ie. caps, perk cards etc.) to fill the gaps but there's already too much of that as it is.
---
There had better be a valid choice to nuke those asshats back to California.
---
I actually leave everything unlocked. So if someone takes my junk or water i don't complain. Figured it will do better for them then me since i rarely collect it lol
---
Thinking similar thing with the rep thing, why would the bos ever help the raiders? Feel like they will be hostile to all raiders
---
Wha???
---
Love to hear a good thing like this. Reminds me that people are good and decent and not screaming about ... well about any of it. Thank you for sharing the goodness, it warms my little irradiated heart too!
---
I completed Scorched Earth twice with my low-level alt the other day. I went there before the nuke dropped and focused on ads during the fight, popping the occasional shot on the SBQ.
---
I would say I dealt no more than 200 damage to her on each occasion and, to my happy surprise, still received loot from her corpse. Maybe the damage minimum counts pre-resistances damage dealt?
---
It's been a known bug since release, no idea why they still haven't fixed it yet. Your best bet would be sending Bethesda a ticket with images about it and they will award you the atoms for it.
---
Are you on pc, and was it still up about a month ago? I saw a harambe shrine with that, wondering if it was you lol
---
I want an enclave dlc I fully support the enclave
---
Its ezpz but they are mental
---
Spamming at a vendor has been a bad idea since beta.
---
Yes to this a million times especially for the nuclear winter.  I've also re kitted my main character to be a massive intelligence build where I'm roughly around 50 or 60 intelligence and even my main character levels up pretty quick I've gotten over a hundred levels so far in the weeks that this run has started. Closing in on 400 lol
---
I know unfortunately something that seems very minuscule is probably asking too much of BGS
---
My main (level 410) has gone from shotgun to 1h melee to heavy melee to rifleman to commando and now unarmed. I have other characters too, but at this point I have all the cards unlocked so I just burn some points to move stats around as needed.
---
Alright, thank you for letting me know
---
If that’s true that they didn’t have anything else, then since they’ve had a whole season to prepare for Season 2, maybe things will be better
---
I sell my weapons for 100 caps a star and armor for 50 caps a star. Most high level players log in and vendor hop to get their daily script and daily score stuff so if you sell enough script to Max out their 150 daily allotment for less than the 1400 cap Max per day one player will buy repeatedly for their other toons. One guy bought everything I had one time. Just kept switching toons and bought me out it was awesome. Went from 800 to like 550 weight from one player.
---
I have so many good blueprints, but I don't have any vs player. I bet a shotgun one would be good behind walls the player will blinding shoot through.
---
Expect the worst
---
It is too late to join the season if you want to finish it, and the rewards are very mediocre. You could wait for the brotherhood. Or come back for meat week.
---
PS4! I was inspired to make good use of my gorilla stands after seeing that post here where someone made a diorama of gorillas infront of terminals with the lettering “Bethesda dev team”. Friggin hilarious
---
Well fuck, guess I can say goodbye to making Stimpaks.
---
RNG is gonna RNG. I had 7 legendary’s on my full WS run a few day’s ago. It was crazy!!
---
sounds like beginner mistakes.
---
If no one else does before me. I will
---
Well I gotta see this:  also, what’s the secret fireplace you speak of?  How do I get it?
---
It's called people playing their way and not wanting to follow instructions rather it be written or verbal.
---
Also for a space themed board most of the rewards are...not
---
Your able to shoot eacthother
---
Can confirm this isn't true. Just today had griefers do to mine and I wasn't in PVP. Still works
---
I get personally erked when someone does the Line Tent glitch to mass spawn the Scorched...
---
Armor I'd roll 3 star weapons probably 2 star it's cheap but if your gear isnt that good roll 1 star armor and 1 star weapons...once you have decent gear try and roll for better.a 1 star bloodied handmade is good but a 3 star 2525 handmade is epic.
---
Cheaters. Cheaters never change.
---
You getting on tonight?
---
Some people are bad at doing things if they aren’t clearly written for them. I did Encrypted today, and a level 260-something was just constantly shooting the imposter when none of the pylons were active.
---
Why so stubborn? I mean you are completely in your right, but a lot of the NW daily’s are super easy and you may just find that you enjoy the mode.
---
Explosive rifleman
---
Ive been playing on pc for 2 weeks now. Nobody ever seems like they want to meet other people. Much less give them items. Ive been teaching myself, just join into public groups where nobody has a mic ever, and i follow their lead if im lost.
---
You guys.
---
But playing “their way”: standing around in habitat A with a bunch of other people, means we are now at a disadvantage during the second half of the event. If the event fails, sure we get a few legendaries but i dont get my ammunition back. Its illogical to play this way and in addition i dont see how fighting over radstags with a large group is more resourceful than getting chances at more legendaries in the other habitats.
---
No just looking to find out more bit the game and it's stuff.
---
Ol’ Ward ain’t quite right.
---
Meat week! Meat week! Meat week! You really aren’t missing anything right now.
---
Let me know if moving/rebuilding the CAMP effectively gets rid of the Ammo Factory completely.  I have one, too.  I had taken the workshop, and I saw the machine was a building object that allows you to use the blueprint option (like most building objects), so I blueprinted it.  When I was trying to place it in my CAMP, I knew where I wanted to put it, but I accidentally hit the wrong button at the wrong time, so it dropped right in the middle of the floor, where I did not want it, and it blocks me from putting other things there I wanted.  I can't move it, store it, scrap it, or anything like that.  I have been considering moving my CAMP for other reasons anyway.  It would be nice to know for sure if it works to move the CAMP and the machine will be gone completely, as opposed to being stuck in "stored" status, or something.
---
They should do a community event where you make explosives to blow up Grafton dam.
---
Someone can correct if I wrong but as far as I can tell the Whitesprings Bunker people were Enclave that split into two faction that had an internal dispute on how to handle the region after the bombs going forward. 
---
One of the leaders within one of the Factions released the Scorchbeast Queen/Plague in order to lower the DEFCON level within the region in order to make the Missile Silos functional again. The opposing Faction didn't like that so they started killing each other and amidst the chaos MODUS is damage and he doesn't like that so the best method to prevent any further damage was to simply kill everyone within the Bunker. 
---
So as far as I can tell the Enclave for the region of Appalachia is gone.
---
Idk
---
Yeah I just wanted flavour texts rather than negative special, same with mutations. Negative special is boring the diseases have better flavoured text but there is no build with them.
---
Atleast with mutations they lower the special more that 2 like withdrawal symptoms. I run a negative strength build on my gunslinger so I don't need class freak.
---
I feel like any build that let's you one shot enemies need to have more negatives.
---
Bloodied builds should be zerging and not stealth avoid all damage. If you put some of there buffs on a timer and have to be triggered. Like 20 seconds on nerd rage like in fallout 4.
---
Junkies should be chem addicts with massive negatives to withdrawal symptoms. Think the chem fiends from fallout nv, give us a chem to boost hip fire damage to. (not vats damage) 
---
Disease builds should be melee or heavy weapons with massive damage and maybe bonuses to other mutations like electrical charge and unstable isotope.
---
Even some sort of passive healing based off diseases would be nice.
---
Vats should be all about burst downing enemies. They should rely on caffeine to boost vats regen and quantum for a quick 100ap.
---
Stealth is all about first blood in combat and they are implementing perks to buff player damage on certain enemies.
---
Ya that always bugged me too. They are sellable too so the only reason to scrap clothes is because your too lazy to sell them to the next vendor you come across. Other question...why does scrapping an empty PA frame gives no mats? Aren't they made of metal so steel at the very least?
---
Pretty much for the challenge, and to clear up inventory space if it is clothing that is not worth trying to sell.
---
Sometimes you will notice vertibots protecting a cargobot, mind you you can always ask a buddy for help or see if people are selling them in their shops
---
Those horns on the T-51b look legit!
---
Personally I still want an NCR Bundle with the Scorched Sierra Power Armor for my T-65, Ranger Sequoia skin for Western Revolver, a Deathclaw Finger skin for the Bowie Knife, and a Western style Poncho like in Spaghetti Western from the Dollars Trilogy.
---
As an American I want to feel like one.
---
Why this game doesn't have crossplay is beyond me
---
Or at least cross save
---
Here's a video from last year explaining the Event: https://youtu.be/7xNUTmLj-oc
---
It will be the same thing this year just with more/new rewards.
---
It's a two part event. Primal cuts happens every so often and allows you to collect primal cuts of meat. It's a hoard event. Every hour on the hour you do grahms cookout. There you deliver the meat you've collected and do various other chores. You don't have do the former to be part of the later.
---
It's truly a gem event and a lot of fun. Low stress easy to succeed.
---
It would be nice if they could include it in with a perk card like bloody mess or something? It is not wise to give Bethesda a reason to nerf our weapons, because that's the only time they pay attention to feedback.
---
I have my vendors, they wanna buy soemthing they can check my camp, other than that players should know better by now
---
Does it say something? Like region ping server unavailable or something?
---
In that case you need to install F76 on your C drive
---
I still need to discover Berkeley even though I have it
---
I mean, people struggle to follow the instructions that show up like "repair extractor alpha/bravo/charlie" or "collect and deposit irradiated ore", so it doesn't seem likely that most players will follow instructions that are any more complicated than "shoot and kill".
---
Immersive as fuck.
---
Remember being FORCED into PvP.
---
I'm not sure really Bethesda thought out the life-time challenges that deeply.  Get 80 atoms for killing 76 scorched with a rail gun but only 20 atoms for playing the game for 1000 real-world hours.
---
I just stopped trying to make sense of it all and just enjoy it.
---
Been bugged forever.  Some people have had luck discovering them with new characters since the challenge is account based and not character locked.  Worked for me for all but the Bog town.  Good luck, or if not welcome to the club!
---
The best kind of mistakes
---
You have brought up some very good points. This game is cared for by a very dysfunctional staff at Bethesda.
---
I hate it, I would much rather see weapons having unique native upgradable effects that make them utilitarian rather than arbitrary damage buffs. 
---
For example
---
Stun baton, -&gt; shock upgrade: always staggers and cripples opponent's limbs
---
Harpoon gun, -&gt; barbed harpoon: bleed damage and slows enemies, standard harpoon: deals double limb damage
---
Make it so weapons that underperform on damage do something else that makes them useful for specific purposes. There are already mods like that, on already powerful weapons for some reason, Like the burning heavy sharp rocket mod for sledgehammers, which deals energy damage, bleed damage, increased damage, extra limb damage, and has a chance to instantly cripple. The base sledgehammer slightly underperforms compared to other weapons like the super sledge, but it has that crazy upgrade that makes it one of the best all around melee weapons and very competitive with the better weapons.
---
Otherwise, giving all weapons an ultracite prime style upgrade to bring their damage in line isn't the worst idea, and would be a cheap easy lazy way to do it, meaning it is most likely.
---
Do you also have Xbox Gold? That's necessary to play the game. You may also want to Google those numbers up and see what occurs.
---
Wasteland Salvation
---
Yea just doing a little grinding in MHW:IB
---
 I made an alt just for NW.  Easier to level from 1-2 and so on.  sneak and hide as long as i can.
---
Yeah... I'm all for the sitting in the chair backwards, but this is a bit much!
---
He has....issues.
---
LOL I don't think its intended for "self use"!
---
Meat Week because the weak meek need meat for the week to not be weak meat
---
no, but i'm sure it will work flawlessly
---
/s
---
For high levels who are also feeling like this, I just posted about this in the group from the perspective of a low level player who is really grateful for people like you. Don't let the greedy guts sour you on being awesome people.
---
did you steal fizzy lifting drink?
---
aww :( upset people called bethesda out for making another dogshit cash grab
---
How does one activate critical shot on Xbox?
---
One time i was with my friends at tyler county dirt track helping a lvl 10 defend the place and when we were done my friends gave him some loot and then they left and i stayed behind to loot the corpses when the low lvl came up to me expecting and saying i need to give them some free loot since im a high level and their a low level and it pissed me off so i said "here have sone lead" then hit the claim workshop and pulled out the fancy pump action shotgun "50% limb damage, ignores 50% armor and 50 dmg resist while aiming" and one tapped him causing them to fly back while dead and then i left the place.
---
As someone who is also haunted by past abuses that won't seem to stay in my past, I understand how immensely big of an impact even a small gesture from someone can have on your day. I've met so many amazing and kind folks on this game it's crazy. I always tell people to be good to themselves, even though I know it isn't always easy, but it's just as important to be kind to others, because you never know what someone has been through or how their day has gone.
---
he's a synth, just like daguerre
---
That really burns.
---
🎖️I wish I had a real reward to give you.  But please accept my poor man's gold.
---
We are the baddies
---
On that same terminal menu where you track officers, the first option is for tracking a keycard. I don't want to spoil anything by saying more.
---
Me and another guy was running it last night.  He put up some fists and i was like why the hell not.  Fun event if everyone knows its a time out when a legendary pops his head up
---
I mean I haven't been on in like 3 days but otherwise it's all good
---
Maybe you should avoid assumptions yourself and read the questions being asked of you when you’re seeking assistance. You were quite insistent that ‘it wasn’t there’.
---
And yet it was. Once you *actually* looked. 
---
Amazing.
---
Great to see more lower level characters getting loot from her!
---
well, mine wasnt that rosy yesterday. a dude with secret service amour I think, came up to me while I was fixing my armor and he started to melee me. i don't know what was his initial problem. maybe because I have such a small cramped camp but with some plushed teddy bears collection in display cabs? i dont know. he then gave a  PvP emote few times after which i turn around from my workstation and gave him thumbsdown. I said to myself (coz i don't have headset on) "Screw you! I'm only level 67 and you are level 100 plus nearing 200. go pick a fight with someone of the same 'size', not me!" he then walk off but first without giving some explosion to my camp. wtf. like a big titty flerking spoilt brat.
---
The irony.
---
I agree.
---
Oh ok thank you
---
What kinda numbers you getting? With a bloodied one star lever I get 2200ish headshots in or out of vats if I'm in Need Rage and about 1600 if not.
---
I'm seriously ready to kick her the fuck out over this.
---
Look for the Helpers and very well said.
---
I do have gold and tried googling the numbers nothing for it
---
Peggle II will be out soon.
---
If it's a public server, then it's someone offloading stuff for lowbies. Pretty common
---
Keep your eye on YouTube as well there are many many videos that can educate you and guide you toward the type of player you want to be.
---
Or it should be worth 2-3x the amount of score
---
No it only says that
---
&gt;!They already have those, silly, just go to Welch and find the crashed capsule her shipmates were in....   Too soon?!&lt;
---
*Coveted! * 😊
---
I felt that way through most of the game. Until...I found a legendary with 2 VATS bonuses. Now I'm one-shotting pretty much anything while I wait for the RNG gods to bring me something better. You have to play the hand you're dealt.
---
Now I feel sad for whipping his arse on the Legendary Run, he was only trying to save his people :(
---
Yes SHE does... (I looked it up...its a girl)
---
I’m ambivalent.  She’s fine, she doesn’t bother me, but she’s no Red Eye.
---
Do you also have an account with Bethesda?
---
No idea
---
After spending a wild night with the overseers daughter you catch it...
---
I'm a bloodied PA heavy, and even the SBQ has to melee me 7-8 times if I'm at 10% health. You really don't die easily.
---
The Ghillie Suit is awesome!  I played 3 matches tonight, got 5th, 3rd and 2nd.  I might have won the last one if I had equipped the marine armor I found, but no way I would have made it to the final circle in a bright blue suit.   The SB found me and I had no defense, so 2nd place.  
---
An interesting thing happened in my 2nd match.  Playing solo, down to 5 left, hiding well in a bush, and all of a sudden someone puts a concrete bunker around me???  2 players enter, I don't shoot, either do they.  We take spots 1-3.  Weirdest encounter by far in NW, but kind of cool.
---
I am pretty solid in vats, but out of vats it takes a few hits :/
---
Unless your a diabolical serial killer trying to lure unsuspecting victims into your pvp zone so that you can have your fun...
---
I'm onto you buddy
---
Yeah I’m a high health build, I’m doing 335 per shot on my TSE lever action right now (at least that’s what it says in the menu. I have tank killer on at max too)
---
On PC/PS4 there's quite a few Roleplay groups.
---
But Xbox though that's a different story, one that me and a few other groups are trying to get motivated again like it was when Fallout 76 first came out. 
---
I would love to actually immerse myself as a Brotherhood of Steel soldier with like-minded players. I do have a Brotherhood Roleplay group set up but it seems like not many people are interested in Roleplaying it out in-game.
---
Only time will tell i guess.
---
Thanks!
---
Yes you can, Strangler does use the ultracite mods since the "base model" of strangler is ultracite
---
I wouldve edited the inis myself but i just assumed it would put me at risk of being banned, is it risky by any chance ?
---
Well and a lot of these don’t have any space theme whatsoever. “What do we need to get into space?” A space suit? No ooh like a rocket ship? No okay maybe what about an alien mask? No 
---
Oh wait I got it a ghillie suit
---
This is very cute and I love it.
---
Ohhhhhhh how couldent i see that before duh
---
Aight thanks
---
I do but can’t login. I changed the password and it still says incorrect password username but they are both correct
---
Awesome. Now I just need to get the materials needed for Strangler armor and the Ultracite mods.
---
It is probably the most useless item Bethesda has ever come up with. I wish they would just let us drop off whatever we don't want and are carrying at the time, instead of collecting different amounts.
---
Yeah, hopefully we can find some
---
Have you turned off your unit completely and then back on? There are times when it seems to correct a problem with the game.
---
Nah, it was the first one I'd seen about it. For me, it just doesn't work at all.
---
Well 3 tokens a day and you need 450 lol.
---
Yeah I had tried that but a voice said error. I came back later and it worked. Thanks!
---
What is this hassle? Bloodied builds require no more maintenance than any other build - and are the only ones that really do a lick of damage to SBQ
---
The vault stairs suck though because the railings act like a ramp, so you can now fall off the stairs. 
---
Makes for a fun adventure when someone builds their camp over a cliff with three sets of vault stairs taking you to the camp.
---
It's a major time sink when a game asks you to level up two different modes for a daily.
---
I haven't been playing very long but have noticed that normal weapons have increased DPS in VATS.
---
I was worried I may have been behind because I just got back into fallout on like Thursday but I’m already level 38 and I’m so happy that there’s ten weeks and not just 7
---
The PA is tied directly to the game. It's not scrapable. However Bethesda works in strange ways.
---
Like i said, I have never got anything i want from the garbage rng rolls. All it does is add to my weight. And cus the amount of scrip i can get is capped i end up being encumbered with crap i dont want until the next day.
---
Its a shit system which I want no part of.
---
Done that and reset the console as well
---
It's pretty boring tbh. The rewards were lackluster and it got old very quickly last year. Dataminers say the rewards will be a bit better this year, but I doubt it's gonna make the long event time worth it. Imagine fasnacht, but even longer and with literally no challenge. Not even mutants throwing the occasional lucky molotov. Just sit around playing instruments or run around either hoarding plants/wood or killing lvl 1 critters. If you want a few extra scrip, you get to do another equally boring event ahead of time and then micromanage the special meat that can spoil before the event starts
---
Same here - weapons for 100 cps/star,
---
Armor for 50 cps/Star works pretty good.
---
I have no idea what the problem could be then. I wish you luck on finding a solution.
---
I hate this problem so much and bought the metal stairs from the atom shop. Best ones to go with brick and wood interior, imo.
---
Thanks for helping
---
I loved the Ghoul Mask you got as a reward for helping the ghouls take over Tenpenny Towers. Once equipped the ferals would no longer attack unless provoked, it was cool to explore areas with ghouls. That would be an awesome Buff
---
No problem.
---
😂😂 very true!
---
That's by design. After the server has been up long enough, people get to still play on it but new people are no longer matched in there. When the player count drops low enough or enough time has passed, it starts the maintenance countdown
---
You heard of the Valve horror story about the one playtester that kept running around in loops in the playtest version of ant lion caves? It's not a horror story, though, it's reality -- and the 'hard' events are living it.
---
ok that sucks, but thanks for the info!
---
Ooh tell me more
---
Man this post finally convinced me to buy the game, sounds like a super fun time. We'll probably not meet each other (I play on PC) but I wish you more wholesome experiences!

It’s in a rough place. I LOVED it when it first launched, but when the free to play ended it kind of died out. When they released Morgantown it was a breath of fresh air, but with the constant hacking and the lack of any meaningful updates in quite some time, it’s really fallen into a state of disrepair that could desperately use some attention. They need to add more maps, more weapons, ban more hackers, add more rewards for levels past 100+, etc. The limited-time events are somewhat exciting to me, but other than that I really find no reason to play the game mode. With the double S.C.O.R.E. Event going on right now, I’ve made it a point to do the NW daily every day because the S.C.O.R.E. progress you get for effort isn’t too bad (except the level up Overseer Rank, that challenge can suck).
---
Yea, i actually quite like the game mode, but you have highlighted whats wrong with it thats for sure.
---
However, saying forever between games, thats true, but its no difference for how long it takes doing ecological balance for example. That daily is forever in load screens. 
---
This game in itself has a massive issue with pointless shit thats pointless yet is dragged out by minute+ load screens.
---
Ah, that did happen. Thanks!
---
Even more fun is that the plants on the Strangler Heart Armor layer over whatever paint job or skin you put on the set. I have seen the Red Rocket Ranger skin used with it and I use the Red Shift Chinese Power Armor skin with mine.
---
I hope expeditions are as you described, but are a different gamemode than adventure, but your character carries over. The game needs more stability in content at the players disposal that can be done at any time they please with no rng. NW is a great example of that, but battle royales are not for everyone
---
Um what promise or project? Fallout 76 was just a idea some folks had due to the success of elder scrolls online. To try an use the game engine that's been embedded with nothing but single player coding dating back to 2003 and somehow Jerry rig the game engine into thinking every player is the single player. Fallout 76 in most cases is a big multi-player mod using fallout 4 assets. It's just like when valve were just playing around with the source engine an made portal.
---
Personally I think this game is just a place holder, to slowly trickle in money until starfield comes out. Zenimax is focusing more on ESO than 76 simply cause of how janky the game is and it just exists for some extra side money when ESO makes most of the money. That's probably why 76 doesn't get a lot programming support. It just isn't as important as ESO or starfield or elder scrolls 6. I mean I bought a year's worth of fallout 1st in February but I bought it cause I enjoyed the game. Not cause I supported the devs. Its just a side gig for Bethesda. Nothing more. The small team working on the game now just isn't enough to get the game super polished an bug less. They just add small content drops and do what they can with what man power they got. Its the only reason why things have taken as long as they have an how they turned out.
---
I live under the ground like a proper mole hermit and I will not be judged by commoners.
---
If you haven't done it before and/or are a low level you will probably still get some enjoyment out of it, but...meat week is really more just a day or two and the rest of it is a grind
---
If you're full health then Junkies will probably serve you better. Low health builds get more power because there's a perk (Nerd Rage), Mutation (Adrenal reaction), and the weapon at lowest threshold does +100 vs +50 for other legendary effects.
---
There is an ammo factory in the North East. It's a bit tricky to clear out but once you do you can manufacture the ammo type you desire, just remember to check back periodically.
---
Alternatively, I just farm lead to make my own. When you find the Penitentiary, check the courtyard for weights and dumbbells, you'll end up overburdened but there is a train station rather close and you can just stroll over to it to stash. Doing this a few times should net you more than enough lead to ease your ammo woes. 
---
The rewards for events are random except for certain items like specific clothing or weapons etc. I don't bother doing them until I'm around level 20 though, just so I don't feel like a leech. Except for Mama Dolce's for the reason listed above and it's rather easy.
---
and what are the effects on it?
---
Oh, I wish the mission objective told what to do about Quercus. How long this have been a secret? 🤯
---
Between servers full of low levels, being almost done with the track, and a lack of anything to do I've mostly quite playing.
---
I made a post the other day about making factions that you can create and join using public team mechanics.  Check it out!!
---
I do this to keep other people from getting the ammo and using it against me.
---
I’m on
---
2nd rarest color I believe
---
Though hard to get Godrolls
---
True, but I have found some great stuff in vendors.
---
If your bloodied, wait for others to take the pylons and focus on damage dealing when the cloak/shield drops. If you wanna run pylons, rad aways and spam stimpacks. Event works best when you have people working together.
---
I havent used much of the scout armor but is it heavier than combat armor? I know the weight of the armor plays a factor in stealth.
---
I plan on letting him win anyway. I'm aiming for level 79 and probably stop there.
---

It's mentioned in their Half-Life 2: Episode 2 commentaries:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIS7m7YYEXI
---
This one's pretty good too given how the gaurdian is unkillable and Imposter is unkillable without the pylons on, yet players STILL try to kill what is unkillable and go against the developers intentions of 'Do this instead!':
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV_2yOHgjVw

I would really enjoy the Vault-Tec cartoon infographics to play on the TVs, just in random order so they dont get ungodly repetitive.
---
Be 13 years old with a random crew
---
There is a body near 76, sort of covered by foliage out west. This pertains to the boxes.
---
No im a 128 i played when it was up i think but i didnt play it
---
Lucky, I don't get anything from vendors.
---
I dunno. Ive done Project Paradise once that had the lvl 3 deathclaw and the other 2 animals were beginner levels.  At the end of the event we only lost one animal. The Deathclaw. The other 2 animals were being guarded and healed I guess (the one in the enclosure I was in had me and another player with one of us healing and one guarding) while the deathclaw was probably attracting a lot more enemies.
---
Best advice I give is to never pop it off I til after a successful SBQ. This gives you a gauge on the server and if people are able to do the job correctly. Usually the momentum of a successful SBQ is followed through an encrypted. This method has meant every time I've done one in the past few months it succeeds.
---
As for playing it agree with the other comment. I'm bloodied but I usually tank two pylons and run a VE 50 cal which keeps me alive.
---
If you're on Xbox I can get one to you. I have 3.
---
That’s be awesome I DM’ed u my GT
---
Just gonna leave [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/2vEXQnm) here.
---
Less than 15 minutes?... yeah Im calling Shenanigans
---
I found her on the road leading out of Foundation, and in that mini unmarked camp north of Camp Adams (Campfire Tales event location).
---
Also along the main drag leading up from Camden Park to Point Pleasant. There are spawn points dotted along the road.
---
Great advice thanks so much
---
This.... On weeks where I can't play much I'll pay upto 1000 caps for a 3* legendary weapon for scrip.
---
It’s still in fucking Beta after a year! Always hated PVP, so I’d go in and pop my C.A.M.P. to get that reward. So I agree, no NW for points.
---
On the positive side, most players are more aware of S.C.O.R.E. points now. Zorbo is toast.
---
I didn't realize they added a tier system like this to seasons. Haven't played in a bit. Looks like they're taking a queue from Bungie and Destiny 2's seasons.
---
Wasn't clean outfit a dev-room item?
---
Hold Y then pull trigger
---
Okay. I'm at work so I won't be on until sometime Monday.
---
Nocturnal, faster movement speed when aiming, 50% limb damage, about to make a prime reciever as well.
---
No problem just lmk like an hour or so before hand and I’ll make sure I’m on👍👍👍
---
 I have tried it and done better and have been a pylon but just trying to figure out how to negate some damage from that laser of his,  its a soul eater
---
I just tend to solo it with the stealth suit, pop a rad-x and med-x occasionally, other than that it takes about 40 stimpacks and 5 minutes.
---
yo! that couldve been me! my friend and i were bouncing around from camp to camp checking out stuff for sale haha
---
Nice one man!  Thats dope
---
Let me give some helpful advice. Primal Cuts goes active periodically, it will appear in 3 different zones, be it the forest, toxic valley, ash heap, savage divide, mire or cranberry bog. There are 3 levels of difficulty, each gives more cuts of meat depending on difficulty, easy in forest and toxic valley, where you will fight easier animals in waves and then one larger beast that is harder, this being a Deathclaw in the Forest and Snellygaster in the Toxic Valley. The medium difficulty is Ash Heap and Savage Divide, respectively you will go up against a Sheepsquatch in Ash Heap (Best choice since it is always legendary) and a Hermit Crab for the Savage Divide. In the hardest are the Bog and Mire, the Mire sees a Glowing Mirelurk Queen and the Bog sees a Super Mutant Behemoth. If you are fast you can sometimes jump over to another Primal cuts for extra rewards.
---
As for the Meat Week event itself. Keep an eye on your active players. This event NEEDS player activity to keep it going. If you notice your server is lacking active players or you notice the bar is dropping on the event, ditch immediately and hop servers looking for a more active world. the event can be finished just as quickly, if not faster than Fastnacht if you are on an active server.
---
Also you will want to trade with Graham, he will be selling a recipe for Chally's Feed. It is something you can make and give to Chally to improve the "mood" of the event.
---
Am i the only one that doesnt mind using it?
---
I haven't seen anything for the sight unless I'm not seeing it right.
---
Tbh Nocturnal kind of ruins it. Most people won’t even pay caps for it. If that was me I’d probably price it at 500 caps to get it to sell quick
---
I've seen this. Happens if you sell fast enough.
---
I'm not sure what the button will be on xbox, but if you go into edit mode in your CAMP you should be able to select the wall and see what the button is for the Replace option.
---
And that’s the price of you already bought them once haha
---
Does it drop a legendary weapon at the end like faschnat? I had really good luck with those 😁
---
Same thing happened to me. Fucking kills your drive to even keep playing
---
that's one of the worst gatling plasmas I've ever seen. just scrip it.
---
nocturnal is probably the least desired 1st, ftwa and limb damage are completely irrelevant.
---
not all legendaries are worth something. even caps. by the way, the fed76 tool spidertrax posted can be woefully inaccurate at times.
---
the sight iirc realy only affects the range and or accuracy stats of the weapon, which influence vats, you can't actually aim with it like you can the crossbow, as far as i know there is regular sights and glowing.
---
Heh, the Settlers have got the logistics of building, supply of food sorted. Raiders have muscle and intimidation on their side, and access to weapons.
---
BoS will have limited equipment when they arrive, will need help either way.
---
Those lasers are the name of my existence lol
---
I can't recall. I'm usually hyper focused on the plans but I'm pretty sure it will
---
Yes, that happens if a higher level player zones into your area and triggers a mob spawn at their level. It is a hazard for most bases built in the Eastern half of the map. It is hard to find a place where nothing will ever show up, most of the map has some level of random encounter spawn, the key is to find one that is either out of the way, or only spawns weaker mobs.   
---
As for the taking your camp down, if you relocate it the game will convert your base to a blueprint, you can scrap that blueprint and get all of your built items in stored and allow you to begin placing them again.
---
Oh wow ok. Will do, thanks!
---
I would've still killed them in my trap
---
I’m trying to think of something even more useless. Maybe the water well? I don’t have it but have not heard good things. But at least it doesn’t require you to spend four hours getting it to produce anything.
---
Shit. Now I want this in the game.
---
Most times people will leave you alone unless you take one of the premium workshops in a popular area or the ammunition .. but people get bored, but not everyone will attack a workshop, most players will go find another one. This pvp'ers if you can call them that, just want to kill you and move on, they bored and lonely I guess .. that's why don't be too worried to take one, blue print your setup if you want to come back and if someone shows up, just change worlds and use your blueprints to put down what you built. I can reset up my workshop in 5 mins if I am farming fusion cores with blueprints.
---
This is better if you wanna log on NW first and get it out of the way
---
Post receipt
---
Oh damn. I forgot you can't select players camps unless they have a vendor... Guess I'll actually add one to mine. ;p

Scorchbeast meat and carnivore mutation with strange in numbers. I barely use stims in that event as scorchbeast meat gives 500hp, when your health starts to dip eat another steak and watch your health regeneration go faster than it drops. I'm a bloodied stealth and I can take 2 pylons and shoot it for a heap of damage before he even spots me

People still do not know how to do Encrypted, and I do not mean new players, I mean I got killed and was unable to respawn and I watched 4 level +175 players spend 10 minutes attacking and following around the invisible and INVINCIBLE impostor sheepsquatch.

I have the T51b Christmas lights skin on my PA to make it extra shiny and visible....and then...*I abandon it in a well travelled area with a mine 3 feet behind it, so that when they begin the enter animation it sets it off and they can't escape*. Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

Where does the leather coat fall into?
---
Ppl just grind for gold bullion and rep grind but most of all just play with friends messing around , building and farming legendarys weapons
---
Or better yet, let us craft legendary effects.  Far too much Bullion equipment is scrapped due to lousy legendary effects or doesn't support a build.  Have it cost a certain amount of Bullion to buy the plan and crafting it requires Legendary Modules and Flux.  Everyone gets the equipment they want and duping is now pointless.

New part of the bloodied build eh?

The amount of radiation in the atmosphere after the Great War affected the entire globe. It's possible most of the water in Appalacchia was also affected. Although not as severe as California

Having it holstered should not matter, actually.

Had a guy playing Don’t Stop Me by Queen while fighting the scorchbeast Queen last night. It was amazing.
---
This definitely a thing, this is how I’ve gotten to roll bloodied weapons or unyielding armors too, just pay attention to what legendaries drop and if you see the main ones you like then it’s time to go try to roll pieces.  No idea why your downvoted this is definitely something I’ve seen like 700+ levels combined...
---
That and rifle slings, not sure wtf your going do for that plasma gatling gun.
---
I usually never win, so winning is out of the table when i go into matches, i wanna make it top 5 teams or be in the last 10 to die with at least 3 kills that's when i consider a match a good one. Im level 20 from playing the mode since this season started and its starting to be a burden to level up, i don't wanna play for 2 hours just on NW, when i could be in adventure mode. I started a new character and it literally took one match to level up, i was in and out of NW in 17 minutes. They should definitely get rid of that challenge or make it a weekly one where you gotta level up 3-5 times. Also the insane amount of time spent between matches just to die within the first 3 minutes just because the one guy picked up the gun before you is the most annoying thing in the mode lol, i know its my fault for not being that great, but it still sucks.
---
In-game spouses have always felt strange to me, in any game.  I avoid it whenever possible.  It feels vaguely creepy.  I’m not saying that it is creepy, it just feels that way to me.

Why are you trying to run 76 on a 2003 Ford Escort's radio. Maybe try a computer.

I mean, what rads is kinda like being a ghoul. If you manage to die of rads after that perk, you’ve gone feral.

A working washing machine that when activated, gives you a small xp bonus or something for having a newly cleaned outfit. Or just a functional shower for that matter.

Normal leather coat doesn't have much value unless someone just wants it as a temp for it's much rarer and MUCH more valuable variant "Traveling Leather Coat" which is up there with the event outfits. I'd put the rare variant above the jumpsuits but below tattered field. Probably around Responder Fireman value? Only difference between the two besides the name is the traveling leather coat has a cute little backpack.
---
K thanks
---
I miss 76 for that reason, do you have a clip you could share?
---
Thats actually a random encounter.. those two dudes are called "Phill &amp; Edd" they go on excellent adventures..... "Theres something afoot at the Red Rocket"

FYI chicken coop is a LITTLE disappointing, but the raider cage was a welcome surprise so big and the tree it is attached to is just magnificent. I have yet to see the firefly jar yet.

That would be hilarious XD having more bonuses like well rested or well tuned would be cool, especially if the means by which you get them are rare, so you may be fortunate to find it's source in someone's camp. A shower gives you the "Pleasant Aroma" bonus, and maybe a foosball table gives you the "coordinated" bonus when used with another player. The possibilities are endless I don't know how I didn't think of that!

I keep a bloodied Tesla with Faster Fire Rate around but honestly shooting the ground nearby with my bloodied explosive combat rifle works just as well.

&gt; Now we know that no nukes were actually dropped on West Virginia

There were two nukes that hit mystery military targets south of Huntersville and the Freakshow.

You can see the craters, and the diary at Johnstons Acre mentions seeing the nukes hit.

Not committing to your theory yay or nay, just pointing it out.

In Suramar at max settings the game drops to 70-90 fps with a 2080ti and 9700k. Generally it's at 120-200 fps.

Short version. I bought something and didn’t work like it should. It has to be their problem so I deem this product bad. ( even though a large percentage of people don’t have major problems. )
---
When you make a pointless post like this  list your specs and how you come across this problem. Have you reinstalled? Cleared your cashe? For all we know your playing on a potato.
---
That or I can pick up a decent laser rifle and make a PA rifleman to keep it closer with the book.
---
The problem is if they made it a weekly, it would be minimum 10 levels and still would be a daily.

This is fantastic, perfect example of crating space by filling space. Freaking great job

The "trade me, trade me!" bugs me so much. 99% of the time, if it's my inventory, it's Not For Sale. Stop asking to trade if I don't respond to the second invite.

I assume it has to do with jetpacks and jumping being tied to the same system. Since jetpacks arent in NW the cost doesn’t need to be either.

Hey Beth, wanna make some more money? Make death effects a thing and put confetti mess in the shop as the first one for $5. Someone tag a dev....
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit is it?  I didn't say bloodied is the only build that does this - I'm saying there's really no excuse since you can tailor your damage output.
---
Specific example - Line in the Sand.  I have a Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher I use specifically at that event. I have my tent set up to cause the cluster bug and I can one shot the whole cluster with one grenade.  Instead I up my health to 40% and deal 80% damage to the whole cluster letting the other three players get in on the fun. No skin off my nose - I get the same XP either way.
---
but how is anything that you just said not bad business practice or again an almost outright lie? and comparing it to portal I think is a bit extreme, that became a fully fleshed out and proper franchise of its own right. the idea just came out of the source engine but they made it into a polished game worth purchasing. 
---
and on base-level what I mean by a promise is if I buy an item from the atomic shop the promise is that it works as intended as any other item purchased out of the shop as I have just spent actual money to use the one item. the fact that those items don't work as intended, have not worked as intended, and continue not to work as intended without a refund is an outright lie. or in other words a broken promise to the consumer. its been well over a year for one item to not be fixed and there are several others that also don't work but are still charging money for the item. 
---
I fully understand that it's a small team that works on the game I get that, but what I'm saying does not take hours and hours of manpower to change. bundling items and discounting it for ones you have already bought doesn't take a team of experts to implement and continually disregarding people's request for the change is again to me theft. as again you are paying for items you already have, you can't even give the plan to a friend or sell them for caps or something that makes the wasted atom or real-world dollar worth the promised product because they are intentionally setting the bundles up in a way that is anti-buyer. its bad business and i think it should be pointed out is all.
---
Yep, this is a full proof way, maybe even get a few stealth boys. These days I get that perk card in intelligence that makes my super stimpacks more effective and stealth kill tanking all three pylons but I got lots of stims. 2 star bloodied handmade with 50% crit makes it fast.
---
Jerry. And his pet hammer..

My Treasure Hinter outfit has messed up arms when I wear certain under armor. Do you happen to wear the Forest Scout outfit?

1st - those are duped plans taking up weight for someone. 2 - if you just take (1) of each plan you don't know it'll be fine. No ban hammer. Thank the rng Gods for blessing you with such a bounty, learn new plans, don't dupe stuff, and play it forward if you can.
---
Now that humans are plentiful, why not simply make it "human slaying" in parallel to Ghoul Slayers, Mutant Slayers and so on.
---
Are you on PS4? May I visit your camp? Pictures are not enough 😂
---
It's worse than that.  There's a cap to the damage you can do to a player in a single shot. All the desirable weapons for PVP exceed that cap even without a legendary effect. So assassins literally does nothing.
---
Got it. Thanks mate!
---
[The equivalent of this machine basically](https://youtu.be/XxmP8IcoKtE)

That’s why you use an alt, yes you dont have the best in slot perks. Who cares. Your trying to get ranked up to level 2. that takes what? One maybee two rounds If your unlucky?
---
seriously just try it and find out if your as good as you think you are.

Fast travel mat wont happen, unless it's personal use only, or an option to not use it IMO. Would be too easy for people to troll other players or have them spawn in spike board pits and instantly die upon loading.

When the Apex Players execute me in My Pink Suit &amp; Mothman Glasses - I get quite a thrill knowing 0 items are in my Inventory.  I offer absolutely nothing.  I am a complete waste of space.  I am just a Few XP for a Kill but nothing else - No Meds Chems Bullets Guns nor Quick Kits - just a Grenade for Last Laugh...
---
No one is complaining about the armor effect Sparky.
---
All i want are the shack walls from fallout 4. They exist already in the game as several locations use them,  such as the abandoned bog town and the town by Charleston.
---
I point to fallout 4 as a counter - jumping costed 0 ap in that game, and it had a jet pack.
---
Finally! Someone with the guts to sleep outside.
---
Atom shop paints are actually a bad idea because if you accidentally drop it then it's gone forever.
---
I love it. Im working on my own red rocket garage on the side of the road just south west of riverside manor. Yours looks so homely and fun to hang around! Mines kinda plain cause i just got 76 this weekend
---
So let’s say I took all of them with the intention of selling them in my camp down the road then I should probably just get rid of all the left over ones after reading what I don’t know?
---
10?
---
The one NW weekly we've had was "Do 3 NW objectives"(It oddly disappeared the next week and never returned...), and look at the weeklies none of them are as harsh as the daily challenges we get!
---
No, they shouldn't do that. What they need to do is establish a baseline and adjust other effects to match.  That is, how much simple extra damage should legendary with no gimmicks buy you?  10%?  20%?  50%?
---
The slayer weapons should then deal slightly more than that to their hated group and slightly less to everything else. So, if the baseline is 20% they should deal 30% as they do now, but 10% to everything else.
---
An effect that should be removed is Mutant's.  Not only is it pathetic - 10% - but given the sheer power of Marsupial it's a non-ask.  It's very, very rare to see a player who isn't mutated.  A weapon that gives a benefit to unmutated characters would be far more interesting.
---
That happens if they get hit by a scorchbeasts "cropduster" attack, i had a normal settler near me once and after the scorchbeast sprayed him his name changed to scorched, maybe its part of content that didnt made it in the game.
---
PC? I can help you build a good starter base
---
I mean,
---
The prefix is worthless.  A ghoul slayer's explosive shotgun is still an explosive shotgun, and that ain't bad.
---
But it used more fusion core like sprinting iirc and thered be nothing to stop infinite jetpack flying for the non PA jetpack if it still did that. I dont think the game could handle multiple players flying around without some kind of limitations. It already struggles with speed demon sprinting.
---
Junkies is better for PvP. Shotguns definitely take practice for PvPing though. PvE bloodied is strong but with all the bugged shotgun effects it isn't that necessary at the moment. Bloodied will take more time to get gear for.
---
So since they have fixed the buffs related to foods, this becomes useless for the herbivore muration?
---
But you can do that at workshops just as easily
---
I use the Karma Syringer when Im messing around. I'm running a rifleman build and usually play solo, so I can hit a big target like a Mirelurk Queen and bide my time until it's weakened. You can stack the Tenderizer perk on top of that for extra damage.
---
the only time I ever encounter PVP is when I get sniped while looking at the map while trying to fast travel from one of the workshops.
---
You guys must have your camps really close to Vault 76. My camp is in the mire. I can count on one hand the amount of low levels that come visit me and they are still usually around rank 30. No one really low wants to spend the caps to go to the mire. One of them I gave water and stimpacks too given that he seemed to be going around to all my locked purifiers checking every single one (I have 21 small ones). Since he wasn't giving up after checking about 10 I thought he must really need water and given that he is now in the mire at level 30 lol. I lock my purifiers since high levels don't want my water and I don't want people taking it to sell since I sell it to vendors.
---
I feel like this was their test on trying it. I agree, they already have different races; along with vampire and werewolf transformations, in the elder scrolls.
---
There's concept art of different stages of players mutating into super mutants and mutated molemen. They probably had to cut it and just stuck with mutations to see how they would fit into fallout
---
No, but I can craft it
---
30 days from date of purchase.
---
I can’t speak from a veteran players perspective but I just got 76 on game pass this weekend and so far I’m really enjoying it. I was happy to get enough atoms to buy some things in the atomic shop I really wanted.
---
Wonderful post and wonderful situation!
---
The 10k xp gives 100, not 250...
---
And 10k XP is easy to get, why would it gives 1000 score? You want to finish the whole Run in 3 hours, or what?
---
I would like to think even Bethesda isn't so mind-bogglingly incompetent that they would deliberately incorporate objectively bad game design
---
It does look like vomit sometimes. I killed a wolf and it happened. It looked like it puked its guts out and died.
---
Most, if not all, of those plans are probably worthless tbh. Usually when someone drops plans like that, they were from "gift boxes" that were duped like crazy several months back. People generally used the "gift boxes" for junk and caps but they pretty heavily drop plans(mainly mounted heads).
---
No one ever talks about the scene with Adam and Barbara Maitland. It's such a *wonderful* homage but nobody's ever said one word about it. I've watched fifty, maybe sixty videos of people playing from the start and they *never* see it.
---
Alas, alas.
---
Looks like a Smash Bros compilation.
---
I stash all mine and my little group of friends and i eventually get together once every few days just to drop ammo for each other, as we all use different weapons. Except that one friend who only uses ultracite ammo. Mad lad lol
---
I understand what you're saying but the problem is that not all legendary prefixes have to be equal. It's okay for some of them to be better than others, the situational ones being a great example. The problem unfortunately lies in having prefixes that are objectively useless because the focus of the game has shifted like assassins. 
---
There is a difference between less useful and not useful at all, and things like troubleshooters and mutant Slayers definitely fall under the less useful category, but are definitely not completely useless, whereas due to the complete shift away from PvP Focus the game has experienced as well as the pvp damage cap rendering a plus 10% bonus literally meaningless puts assassins in the completely useless category
---
jokes on you, I didnt buy this fucking garbage game, I'm just upset it took up space on my pc temporarily
---
hell yeah dude. would love to run across this one day. love people that spend time making their camp fit a theme or any attention to detail
---
To sleep like that? He'd have to be!
---
In new and creative ways!
---
It’s actually easier to launch solo there are fewer enemies to fight off and if you skip the repair the reactor step it’s even easier. Tried launching twice last year (January 2019) and the server kept crashing every time I got close spent all my stims and ammo so I had to give up. Launched 3 or 4 since last summer it’s difficult but not insanely so.
---
That was my experience in Sal’s Grinders today.  I’d killed the Wendingo in Lewisburg a number of times before, but he was outside and easy to spot long before he ever saw me.  Being indoors in the dark and hearing that...growly...noise from upstairs and not knowing what it was until it came barreling out of the shadows at me  definitely gave me an adrenaline high.
---
The fact that they went with a BR as their pvp mode of choice makes me so disappointed. Even a super heavy story based game like the last of us had a really refreshing pvp game mode, i feel like if fallout had done something a bit more like that, something smaller scale and more tactical (and not BR), it would be much more popular. But they didn’t, because Fortnite
---
I love that effect!
---
The noise they make is so irritating/creepy.
---
*observes the skull totems and caged corpse hanging from tree in yard* 
---
Yup, that checks out.
---
An immortal wave of destruction. Nice.👍
---
Ah thanks for the correction. I didn’t have the screen up. Okay so maybe not 1,000 but 200 or even  300? 
---
My main point is a double Xp weekend is just that - a weekend. This is like 3 hours of score grind. At most. Was expecting more of a catch up. I ranked up in score more last weekend. People were like “whoa stop freaking about score opportunities here comes double score weekend....” fizzle
---
Edit: also I need like over 2,000 score per rank right now so I would need 200,000 xp and not even go up one rank? That was all well and good last weekend when I was getting 600xp  for killing a ghoul but now when it’s like 300xp, 😝 no thanks. Less xp actually as it seemed like not as many players were out to grind so INT boosts came up short of the kinds of XP I saw last weekend.
---
It's really cold too
---
Yes.
---
Well now it does that. If you have a set crafted pre wastelanders the paints act as intended. Which is kinda sad since I think it looks bad ass haha
---
Now I gotta see this camp, upload pictures please!
---
Sometimes I walk into his office and he's standing on his chair like he's going to hang himself.
---
Easy solution to cheese the rank up, make a new character, take them into NW and they are rank 0, you just need around 160 exp to rank up.
---
Well, you know, there is an option where you can finish it in less then 20 seconds... just give Todd some money and you are done.
---
Nothing is free my friend. Either you pay with your time or with your money.
---
Did you get the atoms after joining fallout 1st?
---
Agreed, The Chinese Power Armor skin looks really good covered in plants and vines.
---
Trappers are a different group from the fallout 4 FH variant, mostly hunters of dangerous game. Youll find out about them from Rose.
---
I find it funny that people justify battle passes like that but conveniently forget Fo4 had none of this bs.
---
I figured it out thanks
---
Do be careful, I had a vampire Mr Handy Buzzblade and despite how many hits you get in you can take damage faster than it is coming back.
---
Did you at least tell them not to use them without Starched Genes?
---
I would uave wanted the 10k repeatable to be double reward as it would have kept me on longer. But I managed to catch up a bit (fell behind due to work) so im now at rank 50.
---
Add foundation below the stair. Worked for me
---
And you can still play with Fo4, right?
---
Also, Fallout4 was never a multiplayer-online game. So you compare an aple to an orange.
---
I agree that it’s not as exciting, but we have till the seventh of September, that’s 42 more days of dailies, 6 more weeks of weeklies and another double XP weekend next month if I remember correctly.  It makes sense that they wouldn’t want us to get too far too early (for free).
---
Edit for correct date.

In conservative estimates, a small nuclear war would result in a 20-80% decline in precipitation (drier areas on the lower side, monsoon regions facing the big drop) due to ash and dust blocking light in the upper atmosphere for a period of about 25 years. The sharp decline in photosynthesis capabilities across the globe would guarantee the worst effects of such a war being felt in the form of starvation. The scarier part lies in the potential for what would happen with the high-yield nuclear weapons that were being developed by the USSR and USA, as a nuclear war deploying those would lead to a nuclear winter progressing into a feedback loop creating a new glaciation event and accompanying severe global drought in regions outside the extent of ice sheets. In the Fallout universe, however, we see large-scale deployment of much smaller bombs. This would avoid the risk of a runaway global cooling because the heavier ash output (ahem - fallout) would put a stop to albedo-driven cooling. Instead, after a nuclear autumn of a bit more than 20 years, climate sets will shift north. Most of the world’s ice should melt as settled ash absorbs heat, melting it away and leaving the exposed oceans to absorb - rather than reflect - energy from the sun. Depending on the levels of fires during the Great War, there should be a massive dump of CO2 into the atmosphere with little available sunlight to allow photosynthesis to recapture it. So the climates of regions 25 years after the Great War would be quite different. Some mountainous zones would bounce back to abundant foliage with great vigor, but water would be an issue. 
---
The Gulf Stream would have stalled completely for a time, instead settling into a differently oriented gyre. The storm tracks that bring so much moisture across the Atlantic towards the eastern US could end up redirected to South America and the rainfall reaching the eastern seaboard would likely be more similar to the rainfall patterns currently seen in Zimbabwe. Polar Vortex effects would not be seen as particularly cold air, but some moisture could come down from the Great Lakes region. The peatlands could hold onto what moisture they have for decades and the western side of the Appalachian ridge would likely have a bit more seasonal rain, though the wastes of Virginia could impose some seriously desiccating katabatic winds through the region. Fortunately for water scarcity purposes, but unfortunate in terms of radiation, if the east coast was bombed so thoroughly that the majority of the coastal plain burned, then the vegetation there would not come back until decades upon decades of succession recreated the topsoil... which would be progressively tossed into the air as radioactive dust bowls that would crawl up to the Appalachian ridge and act as nucleation material for rainfall on the other side. This means the region south of Connecticut down to Florida would be a dust bowl waste with anoxic slime-covered shores but areas to the west - especially regions of higher jet stream activity - could have a boon of a growing period once atmospheric ash settles. The bounce-back of unleashed vegetative growth in a greenhouse earth would mean the time of our exit of Vault 76 would coincide with the earliest opportunity for arthropods to start achieving large sizes; prior to this period, there would not be enough oxygen in the air to support them, but a greenhouse earth system that we would be heading into starting right about then would only be the earliest that large bugs could reach the sizes we see. All in all, it is a little crazy how close the designers got it to what would likely happen, given a little FEV magic lending a hand to crazy plant growth and maybe reinforcement of crustacean shells. We surely would not be getting the snow needed to keep West Virginia’s rivers flowing like they ought to, but wetland regions would be buffered against drought and would impact local fauna.
---
We were there on the BoS quest, but luckily no one had nuked it!
---
People are the worst 😫
---
In the US here, never happens to me. I can server hop all day and always get a diff server. You're welcome to hop over to my server if you want off of that one.
---
I’m not saying they don’t. I’ve been able to get blood from them but I haven’t seen the little animation that says that bb is working
---
Ah
---
250 hours in and i havent even beaten the main quests or even know how to launch a nuke.... the grind is real...
---
Tribal T51b helmet from FO2 and FO3 as well please!
---
If they allowed us to wear the antler headbands with other headwear as well, that’d be cool. I always used the ghoul mask in 3 to RP as ghoul too.
---
Just a form of griefing.
---
They already patched out the ability to stack these that used to instantly kill players but now only legacy players that already had these in there camps have them now. 
---
We call them trap camps.
---
No mentions of anyone being banned from editing ini files or even modding the game. They have ways of detecting it, and both custom ini and mods are not allowed in Nuclear Winter, so you will see a popup saying "Game closed due to having modified game files". The ini editor also comes with a NW Mode, which is a quick way of reenabling NW by disabling mods and custom .ini
---
Edit: there are a lot of cool hidden options like changing pip boy lights (it wont show for anyone else), turning off compass for added immersion, or disabling vSync. The mods are a godsend, and people have been playing since beta with Perk Loadout Manager, ingame Chat, better or totally different textures, muting certain sounds et cetera. You can easily mod the game yourself as well, changing anything from legendary pick up sound to the main menu or Atom Shop backgrounds
---
Why is it removed
---
Give me a radio flier wagon or wheelbarrow to immersively carry one of those things and I’ll throw all the money I can at the atom shop!
---
It really shows.   Love all the attention to detail!
---
It's certainly not easy to use but it's also nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be.
---
&gt;And you can still play with Fo4, right?
---
yes, and? I can play with my NES too but that also has no bearing on the matter.
---
&gt;Also, Fallout4 was never a multiplayer-online game. So you compare an aple to an orange.
---
that's also a funny justification because it's more relevant than people realize. Bethesda advertised Fo76 as a "play however you like" game, not a mmo. except they conveniently forgot to mention the mobile bs would be shoved down your throat regardless.
---
a lot of people play solo. to us, it makes no difference the  game is online. in fact, a lot of people would love to host actual local private servers. and by your logic that would offset the costs off the developer, right? except that would nuke their revenue model. because the game as a whole is made to inconvenience the player as much as possible so they spend more time using Bethesda's services.
---
Fo76 also cost a fraction of what 4 did. little content, recycled assets. even the recorded lines are few and far in between compared to 4. and let's not forget the skeleton crew behind this buggy mess, clearly the revenue isn't being funneled back into development.
---
and yet you say 60 bucks gets me a complete, quality game, but it's completely reasonable that 150 bucks only gets me a handful cosmetics. *after* I paid the 60 for the base game.
---
Ward is the most meta character. He knows he’s an npc in a game and like neo, can abuse the shit out of the worlds physics engine.
---
They're shutting down that particular server because it's not worth keeping it up with only 3 people on it. They make you pay for that kind of privacy. 😂 The game naturally filters players into populated servers so the chances of you gaining more players are slim to none, so they shove you onto the more populated servers as well. I see where your issue is, but this almost makes sense on their part. All servers have to reset at some point, it'd be far more inconvenient if they dropped them all at once.
---
I don't know if the servers are being worked on in a physical way. I think they refresh or recycle them. Sort of like reloading a game. I can't imagine the servers running indefinitely. At some point they'll need to be refreshed. Im sure they also increase/decrease server capacity with the amount of players active.
---
Yeah, that does seem far away. Maybe they will do another double score as well.
---
It could be better like having the ability to turn as mush ammo as possible to points but thats pretty much it.
---
Nobody knows but we expect something similar to what was done to the Elder Scrolls Online: https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Online:One_Tamriel
---
Ah, isn't it lovely.
---
https://youtu.be/7tTfL-DtpXk
---
Nice! Yeah that’s about where I am. I just caught the green space ship dude so maybe 53 or 54ish now
---
It's alright, thank you though
---
Has just been like this most days, it takes me 2 or 3 hopes to find a new server pretty regularly. Which is a bit odd, I'd think there'd be more servers up right now with the influx of game pass players. But maybe all the UK players are outside now that restrictions are lifting a bit haha
---
Doesn't make it any less tragic or depressing
---
Why cant private camps be open fo non fo1st users?
---
Noob player here: random player made me a level 35 bow that MAKES ALL YOUR ARROWS EXPLODE!
---
I was over the moon. Didn't even ask for a handout. 
---
Not all heroes wear capes. Your good deeds may go unnoticed but never forgotten
---
dah-gear /  dəˈɡɛər
---
LOL!    You put a smile on my face.  Thanks.
---
I was over there at Pleasant Valley train station, camped out on the junk node from level 40-120! Super convenient spot for fast travel and leveling purposes. Now that the enemies nearby have been swapped to Blood Eagles I guess it won’t be as good for leveling up as it used to be with the higher-level super mutants, Gutsys, and Mole Miners that used to appear there regularly.
---
Eat fiber, drink water
---
You can clear them off via the Data tab in Pipboy, just in case you didn't know. Then just select the one you want to do at your leisure.
---
I've got this crazy idea but hear me out. Why not have dual challenges for each of the dailies? 
---
People who want to play NW now get a full slate of rewards and people who don't want to don't have to without missing out. 
---
It's probably not an easy thing to implement but it would make the seasons better for sure.
---
A possible thought and one I've been entertaining for my character that is built similarly is to keep using the stealth armor while working on getting a full set of weightless Secret Service armor and go with the chameleon mutation. Unless I am mistaken, that would give you the invisibility of the stealth armor while not being restricted to the lower Dr of the stealth armor
---
Edit to add: this way you could spend the bullion on all the Secret Service armor recipes and Associated mod recipes like buttressed for all the armor pieces and cushion to for the legs if you're already running speed demon and ultralight for the arms, and of course the jetpack
---
as Todd would say " It just works"
---
They're not for players. It's a building method to hide large objects. The safe part is an exploit for unlimited... Safe stuff...? And is unrelated. You can put functioning items like the fusion gen on a spring trap and hook it up to the beginning of a circuit, then trigger the trap. The generator disappears, leaving lots of room where it would have been otherwise, but it's still "there" and powering the conduit you hooked it up to and so on. The superior method for this is to put the generator on a sleeping bag, then have an "enemy" player destroy the bag. This has the same result, an invisible but functioning generator, but leaves no trace when out of build mode because the bag itself has no "destroyed" state like the trap.
---
Well they're supposed to be fixing it in the next update. Also supposed to be increasing the amount of points you can acquire. So hopefully it won't be an issue anymore in about 2 weeks.
---
Nobody force you to buy cosmetics that you do not even want. Why would you buy those?
---
Also, you can EARN them for free, just play the game. And you said you do nkt want them, so, nobody forces you to do the challenges... so again, who forces you to buy optional skins that you hate? Who puts a gun to your head to buy those ugly skins before you earn them free as you play?
---
If you buy something that is available for free if you put a little time, and you do not even want that item, thats not Bethesda fault, you eat their bait, you payed. You have the chance to earn it, but no, you paid.
---
Why do you buy something that you not need and earnable for free?
---
Public teams are generally not used as teams, a lot of people just do their own thing. If you don't have a Mic, then I'd suggest getting one &amp; then your more likely to get people communicating &amp; playing as a team.
---
Right ? It wouldn't let me exit the converter. I had to shut my gsme down and re open it.
---
And why the fuck can't i see how much ammo I have of what type and choose how much in bulk I want to conver ?
---
Shitty system for sure.
---
I was at SBQ and someone puts their F01 tent down on top of me, I couldn't move but was luckily able to "sleep" on their cot then stand up.
---
It’ll most likely return after some time
---
I got rid if my scavenger collectron because he didn't fit my AeSthEtiC and... I kinda miss him.
---
What style you rocking?
---
Noob here. Please tell me more.
---
Pay it forward. Learn the new plans leave the old!
---
Maybe for pistols, but where would you holster large guns? We already have the jetpack and the backpack taking a bunch of space. I dont think it would fit there.
---
Thanks, signgorilla.   It sounds like at least a few of us are running into this issue.   You're right:  it's probably both people who don't realize that it's wrong and others who happily, knowingly take advantage of others.
---
What's "great" also:   dropping stuff for someone and then....nothing.   No thumbs up, heart, texted "thanks", nothing.   Clueless how to do those things or just completely lacking common courtesy?   Who knows.
---
Thanks, that makes sense but I still miss having a private world without having to pay for it
---
The fact that this game doesn’t have a simple “lock” that won’t scrap/sell/trade/etc the locked item NO MATTER WHAT until unlocked is fucking absurd
---
More just for my camp. I built an observatory for Sofia and it's all very techy, then I've got this robot screaming about toilet paper... My personal style changes frequently as I've just completed my clothing collection for every public event outfit in the game. 😎
---
Try walling him in
---
Well that makes total sense. Thank you for the thorough explanation!
---
They may be coming out with a new collectron for the BOS rewards when the community build event happens.
---
No. Followers are omnipotent beings. If they are able to move after completing their exit animation from their stations, they're capable of teleporting past obstructions. The only solution is to wall him in, and he'll still occasionally spawn outside of the walled in section. He can't be stopped.
---
No one fucks around with the man in the space suit
---
This is a new one, lmao.
---
I think after his “fix” during update 20, I’ve just seen him in wackier poses.
---
It wouldn't be bad if they offered more than one NW daily and weekly challenges.
---
I don't care for leveling up in general, I'm on my second new character to meet those challenges.
---
Stimpaks are annoying too, having to find them and a cliff to jump off to injury yourself. At least placing your C.A.M.P. is easy.
---
I don't remember saying I didn't want them. I also don't remember saying I paid, or will pay for them. you're assuming a whole lot of things while not addressing anything I said.
---
but to answer your post, you either have to spend 150 bucks to unlock cosmetics, or be inconvenienced daily by Bethesda. and neither option is particularly good, specially when you consider Fo4 exists.
---
remember the exchange that started all this?
---
&gt;You want to finish the whole Run in 3 hours, or what?
---
&gt;Yes.
---
&gt;Well, you know, there is an option where you can finish it in less then 20 seconds...
---
no. I didn't have to do either in Fo4, or Skyrim. you're trying to justify something that's clearly made to exploit paying customers. either make a mmo or don't. I never touched ESO for this reason. and a lot of people never touched Fo76, or were driven away by this bs. why do you think wastelanders got so many players back? and why do you think the bullion grind drove so many away? again?
---
And let the B.O.S. get their grubby hands on my- er Sofia's tech? AS IF! This stuff is top of the line.
---
They are just there to fill spaces. They do have 100 slots with rewards. I honestly dont mind. Even though I dont use 90% of the rewards, that last 10% is amazing to me. I loved many of the rewards and am happy to grind for them.
---
Obsidian also was considering it too, got cut for budget.
---
That sounds like it would be fun, but it would probably just be another wave of youtubers who played the game for 35 minutes in 2018 raising up a stink. People got very upset over a free pride player icon, I doubt this would fly too well
---
Im yet to do today's dailys because im still at work. I usually get home 2 hours before reset.
---
Are you crazy? Some of the wave events like AWOL Armaments are great for legendaries! I just wish the wave bosses in swarm of suitors weren't the weakest of the group. 😢
---
Just wait till you roll a bloodied explosive one.. also, the lmg is like the one gun worth installing a prime receiver on. Makes ammo crafting more efficient.
---
From what I've  seen the list from rarest to most common are as follows:    
---
Red, forest, yellow/pink (but from what ive seen yellow is more rare), blue, green, then brown. This is somewhat from personal experience and others documented experiences that i have seen,  but if you were to sell it, it could be sold for around 15k to 20k caps
---
I was sooo excited to stumble upon the Cheers bar!
---
It didn't last year, but it most likely will this time.
---
Unless it's a bug, on the PTS most events have been changed to reward a Mystery Pick item at the end just like Fasnacht did, so it's likely that Grahm Cookout will do the same. And if we're lucky, the Prime Cuts events will as well.
---
From what I've noticed, most people join public groups for the group benefits, shared perks, free fast travel, or an event(like scorched earth). A lot of the time, everyone generally just does their own thing.
---
If you're looking to have fun, I'd say just play the game how you want whether it's solo or in a group, doing quests or building your C.A.M.P., doing events or farming.
---
As for recommendations on things to do, there's always the wastelander's questline. Public events can be fun but lately, most are rather trigger happy and only bother to shoot/kill rather than try to complete the event successfully.
---
There is one suggestion that could easily fix this problem: copy warframe's riven disposition system. Less used/popular weapons gain a stronger benefit, meta weapons get less. There is no reason the strongest weapons in the game need to have the strongest buff on top of already dominating. Maybe you'll go to an event without seeing a BE gatling plasma or b252525252525 fixer if that ever happens
---
One waste land will fix that
---
Now you prime it and run amok.
---
I love it for small amounts of ammo, but yeah.   I have &gt;1000 shotgun shells, and I'm waiting until they improve it.   That's a little too much button mashing.  
---
Even a, "convert all" button would have helped alot.   I don't think that would've been too difficult to code.
---
Gattling plasmas and gattling lasers are also super nice to prime
---
Because lately, most players are trigger happy and apparently feel the need to take every chance at a legendary that they can, even if the legendaries are under-leveled.
---
I like her but man is she annoying with all the whining about floating in space and the nightmares...
---
OK, but where are they fun in the "main events" that awards notes??? Or any workshop defence?
---
Its one reason i hate taking over workshops. And im aware i can wait to retake it. But then they could of destroyed my stuff, and its just more hanging around and repairing etc.
---
Block them, anyone that makes you frustrated at any part of the game is not worth the time or day, but know that you aren’t alone and it seems to happen a lot :/
---
Used the LFG discord once, never again.
---
The argument about NW players only getting one challenge was made to make a point about the existence of what I can only call "adventure player privilege". The minority (people who regularly play NW) only get 1 daily while most got 6 and now 8. But no, now we want all 9 to be in adventure.   
---
In regards to the mechanics of challenges, obviously most can be completed very technically, if you so wish, but that does not subtract from the fact that you can do most organically. If your sole purpose is to complete challenges, then yes, stims and a cliff is your method and good for you. I would love to hear what your idea of "real incentive to play" would be.
---
I'd honestly like to see a budget increase or tweak to existing items budget cost first before getting new stuff. I have quite a few items (even though most are vanilla items) which I'd like to play around with and get creative with in-game, but the budget is what's killing me the most. Displays are budget restricted, I literally had to scrap deco items just so I can fianlly add that one missing bobblehead to my collection.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/htmlview
---
That’s where u should be right now to get 100 pretty easily. I’m at 61 and don’t play a huge amount. In the week literally do the daily and the weekly completes its self. Weekend maybe 2 hours a day. It’s not hard
---
They kind of found us xD
---
Agreed. Radiation Rumble has a nice way of tackling that problem by throwing a constant barrage of enemies at you.
---
Uhhh...it just works? xD
---
You can exit the converter if you press the "back/leave" button as many times as you pressed the "ok " one. I get carpotunel converting ammo. I just leave it in a bag next to the machine
---
There was a player who practically saved my life by having a bunch of 10 mm for free in his vending.   It was my first character--hadn't figured out the beauty of melee yet--and had The Perfect Storm or something like that, which I just loved.  I can still see his camp, and it's been like a year.
---
I wonder if people know that when they are really kind, some people don't forget, often for a very long time.
---
As I see, you never played any MMOs... the gold bullion "grind" is the easiest I ever seen. Try to play with WoW and you will learn the pain of grinding.
---
Also, you do not have to pay 150 bucks, just play the game and voila, you earn most or all at the end of the season. If you want them NOW, you can buy them. But why would you do that? Put a tiny effort in it and you are done.
---
In Fallout4, you had to play to get better items, you do not found them at the Vault elevator. This "season" is the same. If you play, you get items (in this case, skins).
---
Also, I do not remember Bethesda ever said that Fallout76 will be the same as Fallout4. Again, it is an apple and orange situation.
---
xD
---
So he must drop a lot of nukes?
---
For sure. Would MUCH prefer that!
---
You're lucking it even gives you a warning. Every time I've noticed the number of players on my server dwindling, it eventually just boots me from the server without warning. (Which I assume is deliberate and not a bug/glitch, in order to reduce server capacity when there's less demand for it.)
---
Can confirm, I put her computer in the little UFO playground w some strobe lights and a fog machine out in the yard. She basically stays there.
---
I use it regularly as a PVPer. Keep crying food build
---
Yeah, the daily challenges can be done in a half hour. If you as bad as me in NW, add an extra hour, but the NW challenge is skipable.
---
Anything beyond "shoot enemy" gets ignored by a lot of players out there. Not just in 76 either. Playing the actual  objectives is a woefully difficult task for some people.
---
You're not.   I'm fine with it, as long a we're talking less than 500 rounds for conversion.  I'm holding onto some of great amounts for the new fix coming up.   Between 500 and 1000 rounds, it gets iffy.   Depends on how I feel that day:  if feeling bad, button mashing is fine.   If feeling up to fighting gulpers, lvl 68 SMs, SBQ.....   not so much.
---
bruh
---
Like if you are above level 100 and not 50% of the way to the next level don't bother. If you have to I would recommend making a new character and going to the wayward 
---
As for nuclear winter, how can you do it if no one is playing the game mode
---
My main issue with it is the time to change unneeded ammo to useful ammo. It's quicker to grind the mats you need and make from scratch and just drop your unneeded ammo in one of the usual public dump spots. 
---
The converter is simply not the most time efficient way of getting the ammo you need
---
As a low level , 30 atm but started with gamepass. I appreciate the help veterans give out to us noobies and am sorry to hear that some other veterans are not so nice. 
---
I've seen both good and bad veterans, had one harassing my camp 2 days ago  by hitting my walls and trying to bait me into fighting because he wanted to get to my raider scrap bot. I just logged off before he could do much and blocked him. I've learned to put cinderblocks with lvl 3 locks on my doors with my bot and use a less popular location and it seems to work, at least from Randoms. 
---
The thing is i've had more good experiences than bad ones which is good and shows that most ppl are kind hearted. The free stimpacks, radaway  that players have gave me without me even asking has been a blessing. As well as helping me out with my , I would say low level events and buying the ammo and chems that my bot farms. Thank you all, it has made the game much more enjoyable. Still having trouble getting enough scrap for crafting tables but i'm getting there. Been using others camps to scrap and been respectful of their resources without locks since I know it takes a long time to farm their resources like water/ammo, etc. Just doing what I would want others to do for me.
---
It's astounding and extremely infuriating. I have given up in the event, luckily the other day I found a Stim Diffuser plan for just under 250 caps in a player vendor, so at least I got what I wanted from the event. I can live without the Bear Arms plan.
---
'Meh, I am sure that someone else will do it'
---
I think that is the normal mentality.
---
Finally, someone with guts to help that guy who cannot fix that mail box.
---
you can use the shack stairs to stack foundation blocks to make concrete walls. it's useful for rebuilding the castle in fallout 4 as you can use the method to fill in the broken walls.
---
it's also something they probably didn't want happening in fallout 76.
---
Yep. Mostly suck bad at NW. but drop a cap three times. Easy takes 10 seconds. Level up 1 rank. Make level 1 toon. Log in. Hide until second circle. Done. Haven’t tried the stim pack one yet and killing another player can take 1 minute or 10 games lol. I’m not great. I’ve skipped a couple of the nw ones. On track to be done a week early. Wouldn’t be surprised if the add another dbl exp weekend before the end with the glitch that some People get auto completing but then I’m opposed to that because it will help the dirty duper’s who got banned for two weeks catch up. Double edged sword there
---
Hinestly it would be much better if you turned it into a vendor type thing
---
I think there was a comment about what they were going to do and it was slightly less tedious. 
---
Definitely increasing the points you can have and I think they were going to adjust the conversion rate. I think they are adjusting it because they couldn't make it completely non tedious.
---
use it, unequip it if you dont need it. its worth it! drink beer and use grapementats to boost your prices even more.
---
i usually get my caps from playing the uranium fever event and loot all enemies afterwards then crawl to whitespring to sell.
---
Exactly, being lucky with Charleston Capitol once doesn't exclude Whitesprings. Anywhere with a high concentration of ghouls or super mutants are good areas, but legendaries are only guaranteed in events like Free Range, Scorched Earth, Leader of The Pack or any of the Horde events
---
It doesn't. If you move camps they get stuck in your stored tab eating .5% each, and they can't be scrapped or placed cuz they're invisible
---
\[Insert Wings Of Redemption look here look listen quote here\]
---
did you read my post? at all? a lot of people play this game as if it was Fo4. in a singleplayer fashion. because that's how Bethesda advertised it.
---
that's also the reason why I avoided ESO like the plague, and continue to do so. because I'm all too familiar with mmos.
---
and I also don't remember having to play by Bethesda's rules and be inconvenienced daily for months in order to get any item back in Fo4.
---
Depending on your level and rather or not you know most weapon mods you should be collecting weapons from enemies and selling them.  Stuff like hunting rifles and pipe weapons aren't worth a whole lot.  Stuff like combat and assault rifles or missile launchers are.  Clear a place out and waddle to the vendor with hard bargain.  Shouldn't have much trouble getting 1400 every day doing that.
---
However if you are still leveling up and don't know the mods for those weapons, keep scrapping instead.
---
What wepons use legendary modules?
---
When I first started playing I just went ape and ventured far into the map. Finding the Breaking Bad one randomly was good. It was one of my loading screens for a while.
---
I am really hoping those serums you gave them boost their intelligence (that way they do not throw their lives away in the future fighting lvl 90 Sheepsquatches)...
---
That's why i'm in no rush at all. I'll probably finish 1 week early at best,but at least i'll have something to do. Otherwise i wouldn't even turn the game on.
---
They could bank the score for next season but that would require extra coding, and you most probably would lose your atoms in a glitch for that ahah.
---
Idk why someone downvoted me for saying the truth
---
I'd totally be down to run with you too. I'd like to get back into this game. My PSN is HextechFoxdie
---
The problem is that I have 1 in charisma since charisma perks isn’t that useful to me. So I need to move some points in order to use it, do you know how many extra caps do you get while using it?
---
The RNG is awful, but nevertheless I would recommend 3\* ranged weapons. Took me a year to get the items I needed to trade for a Bloodied 25 25 Fixer, but in the end I did get them...still can't believe it.
---
The real problem with items crafted with modules is that you can't trade them. So you can craft an extremely good item that is not suited for you, and then you're stuck with it.
---
Just my 2 cents, but I did get the thing I wanted in the end :-)
---
 as soon as the announcer states "sufficient uranium mined" although the progress bar is not finished the objective is complete and even if all extractors are damaged you get max event reward.
---
Cant you blueprint it in pieces tho?
---
praise be
---
That's so much fun, I love seeing lore-friendly builds!
---
Holding the back leave button allows you to exit this nightmare quicker
---
Congratulations for a successful launch!    I haven't done it solo yet and have 278 on one character and 150 on my second.   I'll think about doing it if I ever get low on flux.  Otherwise, it's the buddy system for me.  :)   You're brave.  
---
Hopefully the queen will get fixed, and we can cripple her again so that she stays on the ground longer than she does presently.   
---
Did you know to place the circle so we don't have to fight her in the irradiated zone?   Some of us won't go down there if we have to fight the rads and the SBQ.   Others actually prefer it, but I know I won't report in if it looks like that kind of fight and neither will my teammates.
---
Yeah, I’m lvl 23, and had some nice players drop legendary weapons/armor that were 50-60+. I didn’t know what to do, until I found I could exchange at rusty pick, for stuff my lvl... Got some rad stuff!
---
A guy came into my camp the other day and saw my camp shortcut is locked,so he started showing me the PA glitch ,like he got me ahah.....i showed him the front door is open.
---
Wow!
---
I don't remember the exact numbers but it's all percentage based whether you're using hard bargain, just charisma, or grape mentats. Since it's percentage based, small items(like things that you can sell to vendors for 1\~3 caps) are unlikely to change at all. 
---
For example, circuits for the most part will sell for 1 cap each. If you have high charisma and run HB, you can sell it for 2 caps each. Purified waters will range usually around 4\~6 caps each. If you're not big on trading with other players, then HB will definitely help you penny pinch from vendors. 
---
Also, one big thing to keep in mind is that vendors only keep 1/4 of what you spend. This being said, the cheaper you buy things from vendors, less caps will "disappear". Of course if you buy something for more than 5,600 caps, the vendor will still be limited to 1,400. 
---
TL;DR if you're not big into trading with other players or would like to penny pinch, it is definitely good early on(can be good if you don't want to invest much into charisma or run unyielding armor).
---
Apparently I've never killed a Grafton Monster either!  I'll make a ticket.
---
I know it's just a game, but I think that would ruin my morning/afternoon if I spent all those resources only to have the game crash.   Ugh.
---
At least it remembers your selection so you can just mash X (or whatever it is on other systems) 
---
But yeah it sucks, not having a bulk option at launch made no sense
---
Your posts are just so cute. The idea of the two of you in game doing shit together and taking action shots of her fucking shit up is just so wholesome. I wish my girlfriend had an easier time getting into games like Fallout.
---
beautiful!
---
The fog made them \_so\_ insane they willingly moved to Appalachia chasing those Fog Crawlers
---
All the best end game weapons and armor so the gauss mini gun, gauss shotgun, secret service armor, strangler heart power armor, and t65 power armor. That’s all I can think off the top of my head but you craft them and get a random 1-3 star legendary effect for each piece of armor or weapon, you’ll have to craft a bunch of them to get the exact legendaries you’ll want for your build. I’ve used over a hundred modules for weapons and armor and I still don’t have everything I need yet
---
Thats nice
---
Maybe he's feeling guilty for selling all that vital equipment on the black market and then having his buyers snuffed.
---
Yeah I have heard other people who reported the same thing. I initially heard it somewhere on YouTube but I don't remember what the name of the video is.
---
If charisma isn't that important to you I'm assuming you aren't playing on teams much?
---
If so you probably want 4 charisma to run lone wanderer.  Great perk for solo play with all the buffs it gives.  Max rank hard bargain is essentially the same as adding 3 extra charisma points.  
---
From what I remember without hard bargain back before I ran unyeilding armor it would take water from 3 caps to 5 caps each to sell.  Doesn't seem like a lot but it's 20 extra caps if you are selling ten water.
---
It’s not tooo bad as I use the log cabins so they are automatically individually blueprinted as a whole when I move camp.
---
BUT, if I don’t place them perfectly the first time I have to move my camp and try again.
---
Well if you aren't looking for any other legendary heavy then modules are your best bet for getting the drop you want.
---
Besides it's the legendary effect RNG screwing you over and not the loot pool from the range loot boxes.
---
No it isn't!
---
 I have NEVER logged into nuclear Winter in my life &amp; just lost all daily SCORE to the autocomplete bug for the first time. I'm also logged out BEFORE &amp; AFTER reset by a few hours on both sides
---
Ouch
---
I do hate how long it takes between waves. Sometimes I think the event  bugged out when the next wave doesn't show.
---
Waves should be like in meat week primal cuts or the you get it all right now Radiation Rumble waves.
---
Yeah, the issue with crafting Legendary Weapons is they'll be tied with RNGesus.
---
Would make since but large guns like guse minigun, minigun, glatning gun, glatning plasma, glatning lazer, broadsider, ect would just appear. However weapons like the fatman, missile launcher can still be carried on your back
---
To those who care, sorry spelling
---
I have a bunch of wooden fences ringing my rooftop veranda.
---
Congrats!
---
I have a small room just for my ally. They have a cooking station, bed and chair.
---
thanks for the info
---
Iirc, eating food that gives a +3 to Charisma also helps.
---
Just happened to me as well on PC first time. I'm not logged on at reset and don't play NW
---
Oh yeah. Some people lock the front door and leave the rest of the doors open. Ive spent like 2 minutes getting into the base then realise there's a door standing wide open 15 feet from me lol. Its like when your parents would give you a Christmas present a week before Christmas and say "you can have this, but don't open it". You're gonna do everything you can to try and see whats in that bad boy
---
I may do that. Fucks my CAMP build up though
---
Throw it into a lake so nobody has to deal with that shit.
---
They always adverted as a multiplayer game, not as a singleplayer one. You can play it in a singleplayer, but it is still an mmo. Also, you still can earn those skins by playing the game, just you have to wait a bit. If you are impatient, you can buy them, but that is the buyer's choice, not the seller's.
---
And again, you compare apple to orange.
---
I can do that too: I do not remember an FPS view in Fallout1, so it has to be removed.
---
Presumptuous &amp; incorrect
---
I'm not logged on at reset and don't play NW but it just autocompleted for me on PC for the first time this morning
---
yeh he wants to drop them every time we’re on and i lowkey hate it lol i don’t care for doing the queen multiple times a day. too much ammo
---
Depends how they play.
---
I'm awful at killing players so don't even try.  If I do play NW I'm usually in the top 4 or 5 but it's only because I've hidden away and tried not to kill anyone.
---
Built a camp on the top of a pylon by watoga, was great but was attacked way too much, hope you get much less of that kind of visitor.
---
they drop from doing the main quest line I think
---
Some high levels might have all of the plans, but I would bet that the majority, like me, have been too busy with Wastelanders to have done much with this event and Riding Shotgun.  
---
I think that the biggest problem with Radiation Rumble is that it's a random event, not one that a team can prep for and launch.  With Encryptid and Scortched Earth your team determines when it happens.  
---
So, when it does pop up, you get a lot of random players there of all levels, most of which do not understand how to get the full rewards.  So they go for the easy stuff, XP and legendaries, and do not care if it fails or not.
---
Ty bro
---
Wow I am way ahead by that measure, thanks!
---
Damn a good legendary LMG is my damp dream right now.
---
Thank you for bringing lone wanderer up, I forgot about this perk actually!
---
Yes I mostly play solo, but with the introduction with public teams I’m usually on event teams. But now that you mention it I might go for it
---
Ah right ok ty dude
---
Yea i know.
---
You could just delete them untill you need them.
---
Good luck! As soon as I get to that space PA I am probably gonna just use the 150 atom rewards to buy the rest.
---
Thanks for the clarification, I appreciate it!
---
My guy ty
---
she got better.
---
Range is very short, only about 3 foundations distance. Angry turtle on YouTube did a video on it
---
Get a mic and start talking in public groups it might take a few team ups before someone talks back. Once you start a conversation it shouldn't be too long before you make some friends to run around the wastelands.
---
If no player is near your lunch bag in a world, it can despawn and take the contents with it.  Containers in the game can't despawn.  However, the world can crash, but it's less likely than your bag disappearing.
---
Why is every other post on here people whining about Bethesda not specifically catering to the way they play as opposed to what they are doing and catering to various playstyles. 
---
You like to grind all day? Great. You have a repeatable Score challenge and double XP weekends?
---
You only play for a little each day? Here are daily challenges and a double score weekend. 
---
You don't like Nuclear Winter? Well here is six daily challenges with just one challenge for Nuclear Winter. 
---
You DO like Nuclear Winter? Well here is a challenge to do while you play? 
---
Youre low level or new to the game? We made the daily challenges accesable to everyone. 
---
Youre high level and don't feel challenged by these challenges? Well the entire game you played and "enjoyed" to get to that high level is still in fact here. The Legendary Run is completely optional. 
---
Seriously...stop making these posts where you feel like this game needs to do everything YOU want and base it around what YOU need. Youre actually not the only person playing this multiplayer game and everyone plays differently and gets different experiences from things.
---
How do you skip reactor repair? I tried two nights ago for my first launch, but could not get past that bit
---
I walked into someone's camp and they had that in neon letters. It was good times.
---
I accidentally took a workshop someone owned on my second day of playing and was promptly obliterated with explosive lasers by a level 200+ in full PA.
---
It's why Bethesda judged it community so wrong when they originally tried to make a survival game, which would pit player against player.  
---
When in reality, a majority of Fallout players in singleplayer games try to do the right thing based on how they view it. It might be hard to make that choice but people don't tend to be shitty in their playthroughs the first time around.  
---
It's the same with Fallout 76, people just took that attitude to a multiplayer setting. People never wanted to PvP in Fallout, they wanted to build communities and share experiences. It's just a shame Bethesda only now seems to be realising that and they've had to practically make this an entirely new game.
---
I know, I'm just venting for fun.
---
I equip chemist and super duper and craft tons of diluted stimpacks. I roll up to the event in protocoled PA and take a couple of pylons and charge headlong at the ISS. There’s no stimpack animation in PA so I can basically spam stims the whole time as I gun down the ISS. I’m a bloodied build so if I take all three pylons and a direct hit from the squatch’s laser things can get a bit dicey but I tend to pull through more often than not. Encyptid can be a really frustrating event if the other players there aren’t taking pylons or if they aren’t heavy hitters to the point where they can do meaningful damage to the ISS. I’d rather burn through 60-70 diluted stims and a couple hundred rounds of exotic ammo than shout epithet laden instructions over area chat lol
---
I find gram in the ash Heep most of the time.
---
That spray changes everything except what's immune to scorched
---
The tricycle and REDRUM blocks are at Torrance House (Torrance is the name of the family from The Shining).
---
*Semi*\-rare.  The vault tec alarm clock.  I can get another one without much trouble but I was farming the asylum and had been meticulously dropping the clock before scrapping my junk so I'm annoyed that I wasted my time doing that.
---
It's one of the best perks in the game and the only one I really get use out of in charisma other than hard bargain.  Just have to remember to switch perks around when you join a public team since it stops working then.  I have 4 charisma for that perk, that's it.  Having at least 3 let's you share a level 1 card for when you do join a team as well.
---
they said I could play it as a singleplayer game if I wanted. they just forgot the addendum: "you'll be subjected to mmo and mobile bs regardless". had they advertised it properly, we wouldn't be having this conversation. because I'd just have written it off as a mmo. this is the case for several people and a huge part of the backlash Fo76 got on release (limited stash, for example).
---
and there's a difference between being impatient and not wanting to be inconvenienced for months while I play a game I paid for in full, just so I can have access to cosmetics. just like not wanting to waste 150 bucks on said cosmetics, that would otherwise be free in a previous entry, does not make one stingy.
---
there's also no reason why Fo76 has to be online. from a technical and mechanical standpoint. the only reason why it is so, is because Bethesda's revenue model would be nuked otherwise. make a mmo or don't, as I said before. they want to have their cake and eat it too. if this mess is gonna be a service, then funnel money back into development. don't give us a dozen fetch quests and a buggy vault raid and call it "wastelanders". otherwise allow me to host my own server so I don't have to be tethered to your bs.
---
I paid about 1300 caps
---
I crafted 50 plasma caster. Only one of them was junkies (2star with 10% aim) and none of them was bloodied....
---
Now I'll try to craft a junkies gauss minigun with atleast FFR (the FR third star will be cherry on the top)... I can do 100... so... maybe I have some hope.
---
I’ve had similar thoughts, my dude. I’m a Maryland native, so I’d say I do feel a connection to large bodies of water, and one of my favorite things about Fallout 4 is how prevalent the coast is. Another local and I had a good convo on the Fallout subreddit about how we were both disappointed to see the mighty Potomac in Fallout 3 reduced to a dry ditch in some places lol.
---
Also as a Maryland native, yup, I’m familiar with the feel of IRL WV. I was really sad to see Summersville lake all dried up. I really like the Ohio out west, but there is nothing interesting on the other side (yet). I did have my CAMP on that river for a while. More water features would be really cool but I can understand the artistic, lore, and science-fiction liberties they’re taking.
---
Sorry btw. Meant to say max rank hard bargain is the same as adding 3 charisma points when selling, not lone wanderer lol.  Too early.
---
They're not out yet on regular game servers.
---
K.
---
Plus it’s even worse when the fast travel bug picks that moment to appear.
---
You can get them in a few months time.
---
I don't see you coming up with anything original
---
Well atleast I know I’m not going crazy lol. Thanks pal.
---
Why does it have to be an alt? I have recently hit 50, and there are some who have tried to give me stuff during my leveling. But I don't want handouts, so I just wave and run. Not like I need stuff, and if you want to give stuff away, add it with a low price to your vendor.
---
Ah, I'm sorry. I saw a lot of news revolving around it and saw it was part of the legendary run update. I figured the wiki was just out of date on that page. Thank you very much!
---
Yeah, I agree
---
A bit more research shows that it does just add one more pellet, but that pellet hits for the base damage of the weapon rather than than adding just one pellet's worth of damage.  So, it still doubles the base damage of the weapon.
---
I always leave my known BPs at events and I always try to make sure that low levels get them.. 
---
It helped me out when someone gave me a bunch of BPs so I've continued his kindness
---
It's spawns you where the event should be, which is inside the nuke zone.
---
Ill test rn
---
Question, how does this trigger? I think I’ve only done it once or twice. It only triggered once I picked up technical data ... is that all there is to it? It triggers as soon as you pick up technical data from somewhere?
---
3 Charisma here: Hard Bargain 3 is the difference between some scrap like nuclear waste selling for 2 instead of 1 cap. Pretty much double revenue from selling little value items, so ya, worth it.
---
Don't make it a customization unless it's permanent. I don't want people going between human and ghouls all the time.
---
Know it would be a pain to implement but there should be a way to highlight the player before you drop so only they and you can pick up stuff from the drop bag.
---
You can't have it both ways OP. 
---
Pick your Poison! You either get a Guarantee 3* Weapon from the Purvoyer that *might* give you a Plasma Caster or your guarantee a Plasma Caster that will get you a 1/2/3* Legendary Effect(s).
---
I know which one I would choose.
---
Context
---
Oh it's much worse than that. She was Fallout obsessed long before FO76. We met via the Fallout Instagram community and fell in love via FO76. xD
---
It’s a glitch with the fo1 tent
---
Plus when its mole rats too. Nothing worse. Guarantee a mole rat will glitch in the floor somewhere. 
---
Or the fusion core place in the forest. Enemies there can be miles away just standing still. You run to them and it classes you as moving away from the "event".
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
IIRC their not available in the PTS either along with some other mods.
---
Some people think it's the trade off for having access to a Jetpack and such a high DR/ER/RR on the armor set.
---
It’s not fixed. I’m on PC as well, only play evenings and am always logged off during reset. Happened to me both Thursday and Saturday, missed out on about 8000 SCORE points. It sucks to say the least, and there’s nothing Beth will do about the lost opportunities.
---
I love powered armor. The player damage does add up if it works plus stacked with mags and suppressor. And the ap refresh is a plus. So i like the assassin stuff only if its prefix is powered.
---
It's funny because the fanbase is making it so obvious on what little effort they could do in order to make this game better for everybody but FUCK IT they want their live service and they want that money you get from a live service.  
---
Give us our real private servers, give us clan functionality, give us player settlements, give us just more of an ability to play this game like it was a Roleplaying game.  
---
I don't want the Brotherhood of Steel and I roleplay as a Knight! Give us the ability to join BoS-player clans and found settlements. Let me just have a base where I can meet up with my friends and recruit new friends into permanent social groups. Get the servers to have more than 24 freaking players to allow for more world building and give us the players the ability to organise our own events or even create our own mini-quests that run from our camps.  
---
Nothing i've said here is something that's new to this genre of games, most of this would involve simply tweaking existing systems.   
---
Honestly, if the next roadmap doesn't overhaul the roleplay. Going to seriously consider my life choices on spending so much time playing this game.
---
I actually roleplay my character as a ghoul. Since there's no option to be a ghoul the best thing I can do is apply the grime, radiation dust, mud, and other damage to at least make my character look sick and diseased. It's the best I can do but it's still really bad and I want a real ghoul option.
---
Being downvoted because Im on about workshop events and teatime/line in the sand and not an obscure one like AWOL. Cool.
---
Yeah don't worry about taking workshops though, most aggressive PvP players have left the game or are playing Nuclear Winter, lol. But yes, workshops are a nice feature, and you shouldn't feel afraid of claiming them
---
Dont server hop so fast, after quitting- click the atomic shop, then back to the menu and join a public server.
---
Whoever is downvoting me, why not reply what your issue is?
---
Yes auto stim is a great feature if you like pvp like myself.
---
Anything that weighs more than 4 and is under two stars I drop or don't pick up
---
I wanna know to
---
No one, who has ever played a game or worked on a game, of any kind, programmed that thing.
---
Dont forget the cow and chickens!
---
Oh, my friend saw a similar fight, except it was Grahm instead of the Flatwoods Monster, so the fight just kept on since Grahm is unkillable
---
PSA The SB in Line in the Sand can stay behind the Asylum flying away from the front door. You have to hunt it down in order to get this slow ass event moving again.
---
Why the fuck isn’t it just “play a match” of NW?
---
Lock the doors. I locked all of mine and set his bar up outside, be hasn't made his way inside at all yet
---
Only rad-x suppresses mutations
---
Will give that a try, thanks!
---
Keep the perks or you'll lose them.
---
Congratulations!
---
I thought about grinding for the SS Vanguard Set myself but I decided that I have no need for the Jetpack and thanks to the soft cap for DR/ER having so much DR/ER with the SS Armor Set is worthless to me. 
---
I'm actually grinding for the Vanguard Solar Set instead because the Health Regeneration Armor Set bonus suits me more for my Full Health Build. I already crunched the numbers and after the Legendary Perks drop in September and I switch to my Legendary Build I will be looking at 700 DR/750 ER for a Vanguard Solar Set which is way over the soft cap.
---
Unfortunately they use .308, I wish it took 5mm i have soon much
---
or you know, they can fix the trading mechanics so you can just... send things to people.  
---
Like a member of my Brotherhood wanted Field Scribe gear. Because of the current system somebody has to log on with him, meet him and drop it for him.  
---
Give me a Courier service so that I can send stuff to other players.
---
English is not my lenguage, try te understand my question please
---
🧂
---
Thanks man, this is what I needed to know
---
They were supposed to come with the last update but they got bunch of shitty feedback on the Test Server. So rather then push them out, they delayed them
---
The Wastelanders and Sheepsquatch storyline are good too. Then you have legendary farm and tweaking your build, camp, weapon and armor plan and serum recipe farming, rare costumes farm, exploration of unvisited areas, tadpoles/possum badge farm. Alot of farming indeed, but what aspect of life isnt. Although the true endgame is camp building, making the coolest and most unique camps which makes its way to showcase videos with Youtubers and lots of hearts and thumbsups from visitors.
---
Whitesprings has the disadvantage of being famous.
---
Move the blast zone further north and fight the queen in the south . Then you should be fine.
---
Awesome!! What are the other two stars? I got an awesome LMG too, a Furious one, but the other two stats kinda suck; Faster movement while aiming, and VATS criticals dealing 50% more damage.
---
Awesome, I really want them but if I'm going to have to fight with them I'll save my atoms
---
Do you get the clean or soiled suit? The wiki is confusing as fuck. It says you get... the clean suit.
---
I had that happen a couple of days ago, it was bazzar
---
Honestly. I love helping new players too but there's a certain humility I appreciate from the people I help. It's not complicated, just say please and thank you and don't act like anyone owes you anything when they're giving you free stuff.  I helped out a guy once and two days later I got a message from him saying "I need all of you 5.56 ammo". Needless to say I never helped them again and they didn't get the ammo.
---
Platform?
---
I've got my camp at the base of the ski lift heading up to Top of the World. Nice open area with plenty of space for crops but sadly no resources to mine. Collectron does a good job though.
---
My camp hasn't been attacked all week... did they change that or is it location based?
---
I really don't agree with this at all. But in the end it doesn't matter. I'll keep helping people and you keep not helping them. When I was new a lot of people helped me and a lot of people didn't. I don't hold any anger against those that didn't, but I had tons more respect and admiration for those that did.
---
He’s not talking about the punji boards
---
Well, they were right. I might have gotten the backpack to go along with the suit, but everything else is absolutely horrible and nobody would buy it.
---
Correct tent placement causes this. Look for a tent right outside the fence. If the tent is placed before repairing the thingie, this will happen.
---
Hey mate feel you're pain . Ive had several assholes trying to initiate PvP because I wouldn't give them ammo. The sad thing is they never learn . Quite annoying
---
True. There's plenty of new players that really appreciate the help and accept it with grace. But on the other hand, a lot of these players just have no tact and act like you're their parents who have an obligation to take care of their every need. It's not all of them, not even close. But the ones who are like that really ruin the experience of the charitable players.
---
Don’t you get them as a result of the free states quest line?
---
Exactly. The only people who I owe anything to are from my own clan and from other clans we've rallied with. Beyond that, anything else is a gift.
---
I still remember the guy who gave me a tuned pipe pistol with ammo as soon as I got out of the vault. Carried that pistol to level 10. Every now and then I will craft stuff and wait outside the vault for new players to pass it on.
---
Well for now i just did what you suggested first, and i am amazed at how fluidly the game runs now, Thanks a bunch!. Ill look into getting some more mods, also i dont really mind losing NW as i dont really like BR type games much, and i dont play that intensely, just casually for fun. Still, Thanks a lot for the suggestion. Its nice to know that minor tweaks can be done with no repercussions.
---
Don't do it unless it's the last day and your out of time, your just throwing away atoms that you could use for other neat stuff in the future.
---
Looks like its fixed! Your good to go!
---
Legless settlers hate him
---
I do not have the perks to use the Fixer, so I stick to my arsenal of heavy weapons.
---
radway will remove them if you dont have the perk active (strarched genes)
---
rad-x will suppress mutations.
---
And an exploit technically
---
This is what was explained to ppl complaining about ammo machines
---
Forcing the game to do something unintended
---
As far as this sub goes...exploits are frowned upon
---
except this one...
---
Awesome!
---
Now I'll usually start off offering people really disposable stuff like ammo I never use. Depending on their reaction might do anything from showering then in all the spare supplies I have to running off into the woods and avoiding them forever.
---
I always join the event when it's up and have accepted that 3/4 of the time people will be sitting in Habitat A farming the venison, I'll just pick the radkelp one by myself, then.
---
Gotten all the rare rewards from it except the Bear Arm Plans &amp; its mods
---
After the reset what do you do first? Do you go straight to the game or do you check atom shop first? Also are you playing on regular public servers or on the private one (F1st)?
---
And people wonder why microtransactions become increasingly toxic...
---
So today when Line in the Sand popped up I ran straight there and placed my tent at what I thought was the right place. One of the others that turned up ran to my tent and started to gesture for us to come over. He then started firing at the ground at the \*next\* break in the fence. Ohhhhh I thought. Move my tent. Got a thumbs up emote. All good.
---
Unfortunately, the server crashed right at the end so I missed all that lovely junk from the piles and piles of scorched. At least I learned something.
---
That is when the sons of bitches get murked.
---
Eh. Would be okay if the effect was exclusive to the person using it. Not exactly a fan of having some random trash sprayed in my face at every event I go to, there's already enough slowing the server down with all the ammo machines and enemies dropping their loot as world items
---
Of course they don't, it's 100 tiers and supposed to be for everybody. They have to cast as wide of a net as possible to make sure there's at least SOMETHING for every person, every preference
---
I was wondering why an entire army of scorched were doing a combat air drop on the sonar.
---
plan your build here so you do not spend many level up points on perk cards you will not use in your final build:
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
I thought they was doing this now you can see it happen at white springs if a low level spawns then the scorched is low but if a high level gets the spawn then there high I could be wrong
---
Thanks for answering, just knowing you aren't the only one helps. I know it is like first world issues &amp; all that. But there is no point in playing today. 
---
So I'm now trying to find an alternative triple AAA so I have a back up game for my planned gaming sessions. For both today &amp; if (when) it happens again
---
90% of players don't care past putting bullets in stuff and making  bars go ding.
---
Pretty spot on, but pay attention that the numbers regularly mentioned (throughout Fallout Wiki) seem to indicate that the nuclear warheads utilized at least by china are rather low yoield, otherwise you wouldn't need to drop roughly 16 warheads onto Washington DC and still find parts of the city standing (Previous Fallout games), or the roughly 80 Warheads taht came down in the region aroudn Vegas (Fallout NV).
---
Yet the sheer amount will cloud the skies for centuries.
---
This is really fascinating to read. My only critique is that it could use being put into paragraphs.
---
Bye lol.
---
Are you really going to try and claim "Adventure Player Privilege"?! I recall you making a comment somewhere about how the Legendary Run was not catered for any one person. By the same thought processes, should it also not cater to a minority at expense of the majority? That being said, there should be something for everyone. I dont want to take your challenge away, I want everybody to have more options. Two out of three of my recommendations on how to change the system involved giving NW more challenges. It would probably be as easy a fix as making the NW challenge only appear in NW so most people dont even realise they missed it. That way it is viewed as an extra mile, and not as a requisite. Yes, you can do most challenges organically. Kill a player here, stim there, place a camp. Those are easy enough if I already want to play. But leveling up or killing creatures, something I cant guarantee doing in a match is often not worth having to actually play NW for the amount of score. It is only made worse by the fact that it feels like being recommended  to play NW which I only rarely find even somewhat enjoyable. Progression wise, something that wasn't an obscure weapon skin,  some camp knickknacks, or an ugly power armor skin would be a great start (There are maybe 3 exceptions, but that is purely opinion). Repair/scrap/Ammo scrap kits would be awesome. Rare plans or in game outfits would be cool. Or a guarantee to learn a weapon mod for a weapon if you kill somebody with it so you can learn mods on low level characters. Weekly legendary items that you unlock through exclusive challenges like what used to be in survival. Do different gear though so if they do bring back survival, they can bring back those items. To be honest though, I shouldn't have to give you suggestions. Bethesda should actively be striving to improve the game mode so more people are interested in playing it and we can stop having this discussion.
---
Thanks for lmk.   I was, um, unhappy yesterday when I was trying to do the challenge and every last legendary at UF was one-shotted, two of them by the same a$$hole.   So I went to a private world and found two legendaries in the SM horde at the General Steakhouse.  Sometimes you have to change it up to get stuff done.
---
I'm on UK time so I've shut down the game before reset which is happening here at 17.00hrs. I don't start playing again until the next morning.
---
I rarely go to the Atom Shop anyway usually once a week. This morning exactly was as described above
---
So I started up the game about 07.00hrs ish 
---
"it was finding a World it said disconnected from world then it finally put me into a Private World &amp; the first (&amp; only thing) I did was check the challenges for today."
---
I never went near the Atom Shop &amp; I don't play NW
---
I haven't played in a while. Last run I had, i was near the white spring hotel. I'm early to mid 30's in level. I had all of my stuff lost because high level players killed me and took it. They followed me around and murdered everyone that I tried to protect. It was miserable and I put off playing the game. I nearly beat everything in the little story they had and almost got to the nuke room. I might return now that I see a glimmer of hope.
---
Yeah.  :)    
---
When they have a craft or mod armor challenge, I make up a set of level 1 leather armor, mod it out, and leave it places where I think a brand new player will stop by.
---
Oh that's a shame. I thought it would be a camp item
---
i always try to build near crater or foundation for this very reason. I’d love to build in the Mire for the scenery but i feel like no one would visit :(
---
Too many players steal legenaries during this event and sadly many other events that have legendary enemies in them. The worst part is that Uranium Fever seems to be the only event where the loot dropped by enemies is done by a "first come, first grab". Where other events, everyone gets the loot. It's not fair to lower players who enjoy the event but can't enjoy the rewards of doing it
---
&gt;but when people drop the nuke in places that make in difficult to fight without nuke protection, I do seriously consider not going  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;they're intentionally trying to fuck over bloodied builds.
---
Just a counterpoint - if someone wants to farm flux after fighting the SBQ, locating the blast zone such that most of it is outside the bounds of the map isn't ideal. It might not be located that way to annoy bloodied builds, but to allow the player who launched it to farm.
---
Personally I play full health with Rad Sponge so blast zones don't concern me once I've got in my PA. I don't have anything against anyone who wants to play bloodied or any other way (I think it's great the game allows us to use our preferred play style!), but if I'm launching a nuke, I'm doing it to suit my needs, not other people who may or may not want to show up.
---
Also, while I don't disagree that it's annoying to get spawned into the blast zone when you die (even as a non-bloodied build), it's worth bearing in mind that the reason why bloodied is such a popular meta is because it's so powerful. With the pros come the cons - one of which is dying more quickly.
---
I'd be concerned about Bethesda just reacting to what people are saying, as I think it would also be annoying if you're in the centre of the blast zone farming mats and you die and get spawned miles away outside the zone. Something a bit more subtle such as not being spawned inside if you died outside would be best.
---
It’s known In the battle royale community (every game) that as a new player it’s best to go get kills and try to destroy so u can build up skills fast in killing others.  Bush hiding is easy no matter skill level.  Maybe the follow me is too much but don’t hate on teammates want to murder.  We are in a video game. I don’t play fortnite. But games like PUBG, APEX, And Warzone if u don’t practice killing you will never win. Because how else will you kill the last two teams who are usually good players.
---
LOL I play like this too
---
Automatic tesla gun is your best friend for this event.  Whether they spawn in the front or normally, I still hit mark every single scorched
---
I had the opposite of that happen to me. I was also fixing my armor (level 94 at the time) and someone behind me starts smacking me. I turn around and this low level power armor user (less than level 30) is smacking me. I shake my head and he smacks me again. I repeat with a thumbs down and also happen to clock another PA user hiding up higher in the branches (I live in a treehouse.) I'm assuming the little dude was trying to bait me into fighting and the other guy (level 200+) was going to join in. I shook my head again and went back to my armor. Thankfully, they left peacefully. I don't understand attacking people in their own camps. What, you think I don't store my junk when I get back to camp? That's all they'd ever get anyway... I run a squishy stealth build and play on pacifist mode. I'm not interested in PVP. I just love the world of Fallout and despite all its bugs, 76 is a great game!
---
Can you clarify more where to put tent
---
There is three openings the scorched come through middle right and left. Where are u putting tent?
---
I started helping lower level players with items soon after launch. I never had an interaction other than thumps up or heart emote with any of them. I drop the bag, emote them to come over, shoot at the bag, thumps up when they take it and go away. I got a thumps down once when I gave a PA frame, prop a high level on an alt.
---
i’m poor so have this 🏅
---
I feel like the obvious answer if player-clans fighting against each other. A clan could align themselves with a particular Faction\\ (Brotherhood of Steel, Responders etc) and they are natural enemies of Clans aligned with other factions (Enclave, Raiders etc)  
---
Your clan slowly unlocks equipment through it's own grind. You can make settlements for these groups.   
---
I honestly don't think Brotherhood should be the first faction making a come back, in my eyes the obvious choice would of been Responders since you could bring Flatwoods back to life and make it a central-player hub for newer characters.   
---
If you don't want to align with Brotherhood or Enclave factions that's fine. Just use Settlers and Raiders are a generic starting point. If a clan is algined with the Settlers they get a bonus when creating settlements etc.
---
The only Plasma Caster worth having is the instigating to one shoot everything.
---
Took me like a shit ton of attempts.  
---
Same with the unyielded SS chest piece... I don't even want to think of the grind of the rest of the parts.
---
What are the other 2 stars?
---
I put my ally outside my main camp building.
---
They stay out of the way and defend my camp better
---
Someone on Facebook suggested making the coffee  maker into a camp item that you can drink from. Maybe you could get canned coffee from it like you get purified water from pumps.
---
As someone who is only trying to get to rank 39 it did a lot
---
Stay strong grinders
---
Bahahah seriously? I love this game
---
IDK...maybe trapping their prey for fur and hide.  Things that trappers do...
---
I've noticed when i disable starched genes that all my mutatons expire. However with starched genes you can use any type of radaway and they'll work. Just don't use rad x, if you end up using rad x then use a diluted rad x so no mutation is suppressed
---
Ehh that is what I told a pvp player on Facebook when they asked why nobody likes pvp it is because the majority of the fallout community like a fairly easy sandbox game that you can do what ever you want
---
If you have starched genes 2 equipped. You can take radaway regular or diluted. And never worry about losing your mutations. Or suppressing them.  Your mutations will be just fine. 
---
However like you said above, Rad-X will suppress your mutations for a few minutes. However the diluted version will not.
---
Ofcourse
---
Keep fortnite in fortnite.
---
I’m at the lead-acid camp, so I put them at the top of the cliff in a 1x1, next to the lead extractor, whereas I live at the bottom of the cliff.
---
Not a sea captains hat but there is a rare pirate outfit.it has a hat that looks like a sea pirate captains hat.
---
U might have noticed I didn’t include fortnite in my list
---
There’s a door that you can pick the lock on in the reactor room that allows you to skip the reactor repair. It’s a level 3 lock so you’ll need all picklock cards equipped and of course you’ll still have to fight off the robots in the reactor but for me at least it’s a lot easier that hunting down every leaking reactor pipe.
---
Literally me. I've used i three times. Never again. I converted ammo about 50 painful times then got stuck in a never ending loop of trying to exit the machine whilst it takes me back through *every* menu I had previously gone through. It was painful and I actually panicked and it was a 10/10 stressful experience.
---
It's forest and yellow that have almost the same drop chance, but otherwise you're absolutely right about the order.
---
You cant exit the power armour ? Oh man this would piss me off too. Didnt happen to me yet (I'm below lvl 50 , I'm on PS4).  It doesnt help if you server hop?
---
It's horrible as fuck.
---
I think whoever designed it has invested in keyboard stock or something because they want you to destroy that enter key.
---
Fuck me, it's horrible as fuck.
---
They even "wasted" time putting a pointless animation on the hopper.
---
The only logical way for this machine to have worked is to dump all our unwanted ammo into the freaking hopper....
---
Not hating just don't be pushy when playing with a seasoned player.  Please reread.
---
Yeah it did and it was probably 6 months before I tried it again
---
Better than nothing.
---
I've played countless other survival sims with a huge focus on PVP. Most of the time unless you're already at the highest levels it just pisses people off.
---
 I also don't mind it..other than i can't turn paddle ball string into points
---
Yup.
---
The "horrible corporate monster" in me says that it was designed by committee as a "time sink" of standing at a laggy machine, just like the fucking work benches and especially the God damn cooking stations.
---
Yea funny I just got back to mw3 and like you have to beg for a hacker because everyone just mp7 mp9 spams
---
No wonder the brotherhood lost to the scorched, they kep appearing out of thin air constantly no matter what!
---
I'd imagine it's easy enough for pistols but not so much for anything else given the wacky dimensions of guns. They'd also have the issue of trying to holstered pistol to the hip of each body type/weight which sounds bloody awful to do given it's Bethesda and I don't know how but it'd break the game. We had it in NV and a lot of guns had the weird problem of floating off of the body by quite a distance.
---
I just like to rp that anything not stupidly big goes in my backpack. Pistol build helps with this lol.
---
One of you should have a character that just stands at Vault 76 and has like 20,000lbs of ammo on them that you all just dump for that character to hold.
---
Then when you play together you can just get the ammo that you need from that.
---
Westek, Whitesping, Line in the Sand, Queen, Colossus dude, Encrypted \*serverhop\* another Encrypted, Radiation Rumble, Queen, Westek, Whitesping,  Enclave event, Distant Thunder, nuke Tanagra Town,  slap oneself in the face to wake up, drink coffe,
---
 rinse and repeat.
---
I just added space bitch back to my camp (sacrificed 2 turrets and a couch, because it's always 100% build) for her dumb ass to legit be on my armour bench 24/7. 
---
Made me realize why I got rid of her.
---
And fixers and plasma rifles and gauss weapons
---
Careful, it'll end up being standalone in the atom shop for like 20 bucks lol
---
I like her tho
---
Yup I thought I sold legendary modules once but they didn’t transfer
---
Man I wish we were able to trade SS armor. I've got a godly Vangaurd 3*** chest piece stored away. I'd happily trade it for a decent Unyielding left leg.
---
Their would probably be a dumping method but besides that it would be awesome also if theirs too much on a server it’ll probably lag
---
Yes, yes you are.
---
How could you be satisfied with that enter/spacebar destroying monstrosity that only ends up giving you like 100 .50 cal rounds?
---
My pleasure! I was amazed at how much these settings did for the fluidity as well. And you can keep tweaking them to see what makes the game run noticably better for you, and if you want to reset the settings, you just delete the Fallout76Custom.ini (or all the .ini files, the game will recreate them at launch) from this folder: C:\\Users\\&lt;your user&gt;\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76
---
I've played a few matches now and it's actually quite fun, but every other match I've had a level 5 try to solo spawn on the other side of the map and die, or try and rambo in to a fight thinking we're behind them lol. Had a match with some very patient level 200 guys that took us all the way to the end until I got sniped.
---
Really? Never realized that.
---
I love the look of PA. But seriously fuck getting in and out of that thing to craft and use terminals. That would do my nut.
---
SS all day.
---
If you don't have the perk equipped you can lose the mutations by going through one of those showers as well. Would suck to accidentally go through one at someone's camp.
---
They're new, or just grinding xp and expect someone else to do it.
---
If other players refuse to do an event, like feeding the people, I'll do 3/5 of it and then just emote the confused emoji.
---
If they won't play ball just let the event fail. Quit game, find a better server. 
---
Its not worth the headache playing with selfish players.
---
As I said, the Legendary Run was not created for any one person, hence I understand that they included a somewhat fair representation of Adventure vs NW, at about 6 to 1, and now 8 to 1. This is close enough to the usage of each mode. I mean it is one NW daily, and we are going to bitch about it because you want all 9 to be adventure? We got 9 instead of 7 and still want 10 now? Also by advocating making more challenges for both modes you fail to address the change in balance for the run. Having more challenges would make it even easier. The mere fact that you suggest that NW challenges should be hidden so people would not even realize they missed them just outlines the issue here. What you describe is the exact opposite of what Bethesda or any game dev wants, to hide promotional and incentives to play. The fact that you, or anyone including me, may not enjoy NW as much as adventure, does not negate the fact that the game dev should try to incentivize people to play a supported game mode. Giving incentive is not forcing and is not taking away anything from adventure play. Read back that sentence you wrote and realize that the issue you, and most others, have with the run, is handling FOMO. 
---
  
---
My request for your suggestions was an attempt to allow you to vocalize specific solutions instead of just non-constructively opposing the current status when it comes to challenge mechanics, since you appeared to look down on stims/cliff challenge types. But you are not proposing challenges, only rewards. Most of the rewards you propose are part of the run rewards (weapon skins, some camp knickknacks, power armor skins, repair kits, ammo scrap). Guaranteed weapon mods are not exactly a grand idea for low level players that neither have the resources nor the max level to use weapons long enough to warrant modding them.
---
If you talk to your ally then exit the conversation you can get onto the work bench right after.
---
I've been doing this for new players! I started a mule account and forgot just now much of a graft it is to get started.
---
On my main account, someone made me a suppressed level action and that thing stayed with me from low level to literally just last week when I got a two shot and asked him to upgrade it for me. Felt pretty sad to get rid of it but I needed the carry weight and the damage on my new one was a lot better. But I felt this! I also used a level 5 anti armour. 44 for a long time because the damage outdid any other weapon I had. Its the little things!
---
If your on ps4 and we're both on at the same time I might be able to lend a hand, if your interested?
---
Same thing happened to me the other day. I would also like to know how to Replicate this.
---
It is somewhat enjoyable but waiting 5+ minutes to get in a match which then has you die very quickly with very low revive chance is just not fun. The gameplay is okay-ish, but if it had none of the rewards I'd never touch it. Even with the rewards it's kinda painful to say the least.
---
Enemies respawn after a 10 minute cooldown if a new player enters the area though, so it shouldn't really be an issue. Except maybe when everyone is Legendary hunting after Daily reset
---
I agree with the down voted post in essence. NW is a Battle Royale game. It's mechanics are different from other games and you'll need to get into some action to get into it. But I agree that many of these NW players are aggressive and poisonous. I have a crew I play with who've I've been with since NW beginning. They are super casual but when we get together we can easily win a few games a night. We are tactical when needed and aggressive when needed.
---
My thing is live and let live in NW. Find people with your play style and stick to them. If someone is pushy and aggressive let them be. Do you and let them do them. I've won a number of passive games completely naked swimming so there is no wrong way to Victory.
---
You‘re right. But I‘ve noticed this just in the last few weeks, events were much more teamwork a few months ago in my experience
---
&gt; My point is i got more score last weekend from build team/lunchbox/berrymentats INT boost via the weekly repeatable than dailies this weekend I believe.
---
There are 9 daily challenges, of which one is 500 points, rest 8 are 250 points each, making a total of 2500 points (8 x 250 + 500 = 2500), or 5000 when doubled. Four days worth of double S.C.O.R.E. makes 4 x 2500 = 10000 *extra* S.C.O.R.E. points, which is the equivalent of **100** (100 x 100 = 10000) of the weekly repeatable.
---
Did you really do the weekly repeatable more than 100 (extra) times during the double XP weekend? If so, then you got more out of that weekend than you did this one. If not, then your math is off. Unless mine is...which very well might be the case.
---
This would have been waaaay better. Plus they could monetise it with skins for the BOS stuff in that gamemode if they really needed/wanted. My main gripe with NW is that the revive mechanic is slow as hell and rarely works meaning I just waited 5+ minutes to get in to a game I can get taken out of in 2.
---
It's a 50/50 fix. If it doesn't fix quitting out you literally have to run around to waste the core.
---
YES! This is an amusement park and not a nuclear wasteland. How about a cartoon boing should when they explode?
---
Power Armor is so restrictive, too.  Like, must my AP drain faster than a prostitute on low-budget?
---
i’m lvl 6 and whenever i play NW for challenges i know my place and try to communicate effectively and then play smart with my lvl 200 teammates that are probably annoyed i got matched with them lol
---
I don't like the extra step lol. I was lamenting with op.
---
I got a really nice unyielding SS roll today. A uny/ap refresh/reduce fall damage by 50% arm. Obviously not the best third star but it's not the worst since fall damage is a factor in low hp builds. I have the fall damage secondaries on the boots too so that and the arm with bird bones I am just immune to fall damage at this point. Add in the dense torso mod and you don't die to explosions either, which is nice. Now I jump off cliffs into explosions for the lolz!
---
Guided meditation is the one I have constant problems with. I think 2 ghouls spawned the last tome I did it. At least I can walk away for a minute and not worry about missing anything.
---
Isn't much of a point to them. The event is good hoard and legendary farming. I don't even know if it can fail.
---
Thank you. Also not a fan of turning the wastland into an amusement park.
---
That's why I have the power connecting speakers all over my base. To give you a nice high pitch noise to go with the siren.
---
Happy cake day
---
I favourited Chinese stealth armor for this reason, I usually have enough time to equip and then walk slowly back to the fight. Still annoying af
---
Don't forget to add your preferred instruments.
---
Iunno what Fortnite is, but it sounds disappointing.
---
Would love a picture of you in your finished set!
---
The programmer leads must not have any experience and their bonuses are tied to total hours played only.
---
I'm never annoyed when someone wants to play as a team.  If someone wants to play on their own that's fine just try and stay off the (come here and thumbs down) emotes.  I didnt want to write this post but I have been in a match at least 10 times in the past 2 days where a low level tries to get pushy, goes commando and dies.  (Emotes engaged)...  I'd rather use the mic and communicate with you.  GL anyway!
---
Dear Seasoned Players: You don't own the game mode just because you've been there longer, you don't own your teammates either. Work around how people play and deal with it. Some will want to learn and some won't. No one has any obligation to follow your orders and you're not the boss just because you play it all the time. See far too many people with that mentality when it comes to new players and it's a problem as well.
---
Edit: Not saying that's you OP, just a general trend I notice at times. Most people are really helpful.
---
People that just want to die will not lean anything unfortunately.
---
You much rather have a flare Gun that shoots fire works
---
lol thats so true I hope if they do add it its not tho aha
---
I hear ya I suffer from PTSD as well.
---
I've adjusted my load out just for it, the skin from the legendary run motivated me!
---
Before adjusting perks, I use to have 395-410 carry weight (depending on weapons) with the quality of life perks, and wearing power armour, even excavator, would make me over encumbered.. it was a joke and a half.
---
I'm done carrying it around and even trying to use it outside of my once a week or every other week lead run at lucky hole mine.
---
Whats worst is I only wore it because someone nuked the scorched beast site a little more north east then usual so I had to wear it (didn't have a hazmat suit on me) to participate
---
I'm going to craft a hazmat suit tomorrow and just put it away.
---
I thought it was fairly decent, guaranteed level up and just about enough level up left to do it again after one or two repeatable ones. If anything I may be going through it too quick at 78 now and realising after 20 more levels no more rewards :(
---
Agreed! I’d love to see what a well repaired MODUS is capable of (considering the restoration of his systems is somewhere around the 50% mark, according to a terminal in the operations center). Enclave C.A.M.P items, skins, new events, etc. I’m surprised MODUS never commented on the existence of the Secret Service, nor has made any effort at contacting them, especially considering he contacted the Army soldiers from the Settlers quest line. Surely he has plenty of data on the Vaults.
---
What
---
Diluted has a lower chance to remove mutations but still has a chance, so you can not save two perk slots by just using the diluted.
---
Well mine autocompleted today &amp; I got nothing
---
You gotta put your tent in an exact way so they're forced to spawn there, i usually use my two shot auto grenade launcher to finish tha job
---
Even after repairing it works, you just gotta move it right
---
Makes sense! I was a low level to be fair lol
---
I actually enjoy it.
---
Can we even say that with an exploit like that. Just try one of the 3 breaks
---
With the excavator armor giving you extra ores when harvesting, super duper giving you a chance to craft double the regular amount including when smelting ore, and ammosmith increasing the craftable amounts, its basically pointless to use the ammo converter.
---
Thank the legendary run.
---
Uranium fever is also a RIP only done for xp.  Its 1/10 I'm able to do it with other people willing to forsake 2 minutes of killing gouls to do do there part, suit up, and grab 30 ore.
---
I always look at what people are selling in vendors before I go to make sure the trip will be worthwhile lol
---
You know, the Easter egg.  Think OP was the first to notice.
---
Same here, never happened to me before. I'm logged out before reset yesterday evening. Start it up today &amp; 4500 SCORE gone.  Never played nuclear winter either
---
totally agree
---
Shotguns are fantastic! At level thirty there is a 3 level perk card which, when fully upgraded, gives a 10% chance to stagger and 30% chance of crippling w body part, per shotgun pellet. There’s also a lot of perks for shotgun damage and weird reduction, so, really, they’re fantastic. I got lucky and got a Vampires pump action shotgun, and it’s one of my main weapons. 
---
Heavy weapons are also great, but, as the name implies, they are heavy and without leveling up your Strength stat, you might be better off with something lighter.
---
Don't like it? Don't play it.
---
Its not a difficult concept to grasp.
---
Someone who isn't a fucking idiot and actually wants to play the game?
---
Think you should look in The mirror and see if your looking good because you should go to the doctor with your issues. People that like this game play it people that don’t play something else. You must like being sick since you like to complain about a game you don’t play.
---
That content / mechanic is definitely in there already. Scorchbeasts 'convert' units to be scorched. Seen it with deathclaws and Mirelurk queens a few times. They wololo with their green farts.
---
Never seen it happen with settlers but that's probably because they usually die first.
---
Edit: downvotes for what?
---
Edit2: just seen references to this happening in other posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hyaqfh/you_just_walked_into_the_wrong_neighborhood/) and [here](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ). I'm not making it up.
---
I grabbed my set ONLY because the legendary run skin for it was cool.
---
Then a SBQ fight was in the middle of a blast zone, thanks to a poorly placed nuke.
---
Dumb me forgot the pains of power armour and put it on.
---
I'm already logged off, but I'm storing that stupid tincan suit and just carrying a hazmat suit. Its 5lb less.
---
Only time I'll wear it is to mine lead at lucky hole mine while mine every other week.  Other than that, fuck it.
---
That's what causes it? I thought it was a random bug
---
She turned up at the queen event the other day, banging on about her headaches!
---
Yes &amp; it makes me very jealous of the Americans (not in a nasty way). I think it is just that they have higher player numbers than us so more available servers.
---
That means it didn't unlock, what else could it possibly mean?
---
I’d also like to know this as I’m working towards purchasing the plans for it 😊
---
For me it's so bad I have to just grindup pretty much everything I get from that Mole Lady.
---
Then I store as much as I can in my stash and just dump the rest in the woods somewhere.
---
I can't for the life of me get a really good M2 Browning for Power Armor use.
---
I'd like Anti-Armor with area effect (for tagging) and then in a dream world have it with 50% limb damage.
---
Also they’re probably immune right? Because of the vaccine
---
What’s the Easter egg?
---
When I started playing I wanted to have 1 of every unique bear and every bobblehead and robot model on display, like I do in 4.
---
So I kept them all in my stash waiting to find a 'display case' plan...
---
I kept them there long after I hit 800lbs, deleting valuable resources for my collection. 
---
Finally around level 60 or so I found a plan for the bobblehead display and I was ecstatic. Like literally grinning ear to ear as I quickly fast traveled back to camp...
---
My utter shock and disappointment is the stuff of legends. I probably let out a string of expletives while asking God what the purpose of this display was since it was always going to be empty... despite my having ample bobbleheads for it!
---
Oy! 
---
I'm just coming back after a year break to experience the Wastelanders content and needless to say, I haven't bothered picking up a bear or robot model yet.
---
There's a Quest for the Chinese Stealth Armor, which is basically a Hazmat Suit on steroids, in the case you aren't aware.  It gives 140 Damage &amp; Energy Resistance, along with the 1000 Rad Resist, and even reduces fall damage, along with going invisible when Sneaking.
---
I have heard that a bundle of unique outfits can drop from that event, i’m assuming the chance is higher if the extractors are working and collect the max capacity. For that reason when doing the event i always repair them.
---
Does that website know the location of my missing 4500 SCORE? #autocomplete
---
Ssshhh, it's reddit, who cares
---
So bloody adorablllee
---
Ive got one on XB1 if you still need it. 
---
I would prefer caps but I can take a look at trades.
---
I figured you just have to press tab to get back to the last chosen menu, that way you can buy or sell faster.. Still stupid though
---
We are killers, not dressmen! (Random EvE Online quote)
---
I've enjoyed it since beta. At 500+ hrs, I feel I have definitely gotten the money I spent on pre-order out of it. Now, I play on PC so  I can't comment on how it runs on console but this game has come a long way since launch and it's only getting better. Everyone is entitled to their opinion though. You also talk about not being able to build a camp anymore. Is it actually a bug with the game or do you have too much in the Stored tab to where your camp budget is used up? Your rant gives no info to where people could actually try to help you or to try to fix. Have you submitted a ticket for the problem you are having??
---
There's so many questions here, as I'm currently level 147, have used PA since level 15, need it for my heavy gunner perks, and I have never experienced this.
---
What platform? Any mods of any kind?
---
Their achievements are glitched and they refuse to fix it. Fucking lazy developers.
---
Do you have to remove your whole camp to remove the skin?
---
You wish you could carry as much as the food builds. Trading killing enemies to be overencumbered
---
Everyone knows that randoms are descended from Raccoons. I wouldn’t trust some random player to pick their nose, let alone read instructions...
---
What? I've got a full set of heavy unyielding combat armor lol
---
With all of the diner sets that Bethesda has put out, we should have a working coffee machine or soda machines.  I also wish they’d give us refrigerated food vending machines that we could stock.
---
Yep welcome to the new grind. 80 rolls in ( Thats 160 modules ) and still no bloodied gauss shotgun.
---
Go to google and read the "chached" version.  It's totally fine or at least the text part is.  I'm guessing you aren't supposed to put recordings of people maybe?  Here, judge for yourself but I found nothing that violates the rules to the right here.

Come back when you've got weapon weight reduction pieces. Typical violence build
---
What mods do you use? Better inventory and perk loadout loadout?
---
After all these shit there are still a ton of bootlickers on this sub pathetic af
---
Lmao what. I only have like 4 weapons why would I need that
---
Also tf is a "violence build" lmfao
---
This exactly. Guaranteed three star would make it too easy to get a ‘god roll’, that can’t happen. I’m fine with the current system, at least I know what I’m rolling,
---
I love the lmg but crafting ammo for it is really time consuming since you can only craft a little at a time.
---
To carry... every weapon.  Horders for life
---
How did you message him? There's no chat ingame
---
Demolition expert, just don't tell bugthesda I don't think it's supposed to affect it like explosive weapons lol...
---
Y would I need to do that when I can just have the best of the best
---
It took me 200+ levels to get it from grahm, that’s going to be a hard plan to find from another player
---
There are two kinds of server maintenance: 
---
1. System-wide maintenance where all services are taken offline and announced well in advance. Typically for updates. 
---
2. Individual server maintenance, where a single server (or a server that’s hosting multiple worlds) needs to be shut down and reset. 
---
You experienced the second type. It’s not a bug. It’s a necessary part of any online service. Servers don’t have 100% uptime. They have technical issues; hard drives start to underperform, they overheat, memory fails...any number of things. Sometimes the actual world itself has a software issue that requires a reset, or requires a reset to prevent other issues. Serious issues are avoided by cycling servers with planned resets like this. 
---
When a server is aging, Fallout 76 first prevents new players from being added to it automatically. Friends can still join friends, but players will no longer be loaded into the world, at least not typically. 
---
If everyone leaves the world of their own accord, it will simply shut down and await whatever maintenance is coming. If players don’t leave the world, they’ll eventually see a message telling them it’s shutting down and provide a countdown. 
---
While this can feel frustrating, it’s actually a pretty smart process. The alternative is to just let servers run until they crash, which I’m pretty sure would piss people off more than a 30 minute countdown. 
---
Now that you know all this, be sure to take a look at your server population before doing major things like launching nukes to farm flux. If the world is empty, probably go to a new one before launching.
---
Xbox.
---
Just Google being unable to exit power armour... 
---
I don't believe there are perks or conditions that trigger it?
---
I might be unlucky but it shouldn't be a known bug that's reported and unfixed.
---
I'm also frustrated, having to had to realign my special and take trash perks because adrenaline perk is broken?  
---
Having to know to not log in at server reset to avoid a score bug?
---
How many stupid bugs must I be aware of, and work around?  I'm at the point where a long break might be due.
---
they need an option to 'scrap x amount' I feel like that would fix the whole system
---
I got mine from SBQ
---
That's a good point lore-wise. Assuming everybody had it.
---
I did the raider quest and locked myself out of the settler rewards, the stealth suit.
---
My new toon I'm working on will do settlers.
---
Just craft and scrap it 10 times to learn mods.
---
Also, doing free range about 10 times unlocked all the mods for me.
---
One time when I was going to get a nuke case from my usual spot (in the fire storm) some lvl 3 guy messaged me that I’m a noob because I didn’t come with him to morgantown. I won that match by nuking the last zone and going to the fire. They really need to learn
---
Same to me, &amp; Bethesda say nothing. Loads of us got hit today, I never had it happen before
---
Go nuts why not give her healing factor as well lol.
---
I did bloodied melee for bit. I have a 90% weight 10mm auto (auto for less damage) pistol I have no perks for that I use for tagging.
---
If you’re standing on a tent or a fence, the queen can’t land to you and starts to find another target. Maybe that’s the reason she didn’t want to land
---
So what are the actual rewards? Specific plans?
---
Rubbish, I've never played NW EVER. I'm off before reset &amp; not back on until the next morning
---
I’ll just solo it if there’s no one coming to the queen
---
What you guys get 250 score for the 10k xp repeatable? I just get 100 score points for it
---
hes also the guy that goes to feed the people ass soon as it pops and takes the hopper ingredients and leaves so no one can do the event.
---
I'm on xbox, but have only had this issue for the last couple of weeks. I just change worlds.
---
I've had that happen with no tent present?!
---
Seems more like luck sometimes
---
The small bears and the robots can be displayed. In display cases. They are listed under junk.  (I’ve had to put them in display cases before leaving game because next time I logged in they disappeared out of my stash. ) The jumbo stuffy can’t.
---
simply don’t play it then. Using 3 stimpaks isn’t hard for 250 score so the challenges are not hard either
---
Im rolling for a bloodied one atm, but the two shotties that ive been having fun with is a Quad 33vats and a Furious 33 vats one. 
---
Id say the best roll that you can get is having 33% vats and 25 Less AP cost on the shotgun. This will be seen as a god roll.
---
I do not trust people who spam the "come here" emote, was unfortunate enough to run across a team of 5 who would have their 5th member squad up publicly and spy, used them as a lure to bring in the rest of us for an ambush.
---
I’m a bloodied build but I radaway all of my rads then I have a specific power armor equipped with a medic pump that constantly hits me with stims, I tank all the pylons then just stay out of the way of that beam and try to hit from a distance
---
I might have to try them out. Thanks for you input. 
---
They just looked too similar on the picture
---
I often make a new team when I'm server hopping. No need to waste peoples' time when you're just going to hop before you can even bond.
---
That was never "included", it was a one time compensation for a bug.
---
[](/ajshrug)I use it when I'm waiting on good events to appear/my pals to finish at the benches/the last guy at my vendor before I log.  
---
It's not great, but at least I'm finally using up that syringer ammo.
---
Bobble head display will let you display them. Just go to it and it should have a x ( psn4 ) for you to press and it’ll bring them up and you press assign and each one you assign will go on display.
---
Congrats man! Go my unicorn last weekend, too. Happy as a piglet me.
---
I've only been playing two months but finished all content and am now on this stupid grind, but I'm only on the SS armour!
---
I only have the plan for the chest.. and I still have yet to get a good roll on it. Maybe 25 rolls so far.  :(  worst end game ever
---
Yes I spotted them in the last PTX post that someone made on here. 
---
Definitely some cool things on the way!
---
Yeah the armor for me was a bit easier to get. But its all luck i guess haha. Good luck!
---
Ah, OK, there is no such thing on pc I think. Voice chat is the only thing
---
I give up. It wasn't there until I leveled up
---
That’s not what the OP means, there’s supposed to be an update that if a high level player and a low level player are looking at the same enemy they’ll see it as different levels. So low level players can mob through cranberry bog and not be slaughtered and high level players can have a little challenge even in the forest region. I haven’t heard any news on when this will happen though
---
As others said, people don’t really team up in public teams.
---
Either play solo, or look for fellow players here on this sub or a Discord. Having a mic is a must for group play I would say, but it doesn’t need to be a fancy expensive one.
---
I started playing with buddys I found here on Reddit recently and it’s just a much more fun experience overall, even tho the silent exploring has its moments as well…
---
That is one of the best, but I would counter on that with the auto grenade launcher, it does splash damage over the whole swarm and does not cause ash piles that might prevent looting. Gotta get those Pleasant Valley Claim Tickets.
---
Ah a fellow brother
---
I haven’t used my raider ammo machine yet keep getting called into work
---
After some quests for rose. She gives you plans to craft explosive bait. But it just happens that explosive bait destroys their camp when thrown against items and structures there
---
I do know a lot of seasoned players my buddy who was level 0 was racking up more kills than my level 65 and my other friends lvl 90+
---
I'm camped out right next to that! Where the bit of water is behind the main road!
---
Just bought them from him last night.  Gotta just keep looking and get lucky.  Otherwise meat week is coming pretty soon, shouldn't be an issue to find him for a whole week then :)
---
Agreed that it’s a pain to use. Not sure who tested this and thought it would be a good design.
---
Yes, the conversion rate isn’t crazy effective, but I guess it wasn’t meant to be.
---
Still using it, since as a new shotgunner I am happy for every extra shell I can get my hands on. Crafting them just takes so much plastic…
---
Plus, hardly anyone ever bought my ammo from the vending machine for 1 cap each, so it’s still the best use I have for it.
---
Let’s hope for the improvements with the next patch.
---
Because ultra light is better with its AP boost
---
Indeed lol
---
I'm currently rank 72 and have not gained one point from the NW challenges, it makes me feel uncomfortable even waiting in the start lobby with all the Fornite players jumping about and hitting each other.
---
I try but always back out. Easier to just speck up for max XP. Herbivore and Cranberry Relish, Inspirational 3, sleep etc.
---

Lots
---
I hate the waiting too, it doesn't help that they are never proper waves. Wave 1 itself will be several waves with smaller gaps between, then a larger gap between wave 1 and 2. It's even more tedious when someone is using an OP weapon killing everything before you can.
---
Why make another character? I am fairly new, but can't you respec later on?
---
Dude they can’t successfully implement what they have now with a gazillion bugs. Change it and rework it? Dear lord no!
---
But that isn't one of the NW challenges? Unless I'm missing something.
---
There's a reason she lives in my basement surrounded by flamethrowers. Just sayin.
---
I’m

Level 8 now. Really only play for the score. Have won a game where I was with a level 50+. Hooked up in the third circle and I ran in the open getting shot and my team mate sniped the attacker when he gave away his position. Revive. Repeat. Worked well
---
I have extended barrel. perforating magazine, aligned stock iirc. Also use all the shotgun perks like skeet shooter, enforcer, shotgunner etc.
---
Bethesda loves to put limits on everything
---
I came across a 3 star legendary settler trader. Couldn’t kill them.
---
So the helmet does have a working light? Nice wasn’t sure if I wanted to give up m mining helmet for the SS helmet because of the light. But now that I know it has one may as well get it. Got my SS jet pack yesterday.
---
I believe it’s on the road map for patch 22 in September.
---
So I have a question about your build, I just started a new ish unarmed build. I’m just wondering how that gauntlet says over 3000 damage. My bloodied deathclaw gauntlet says a little over 2000 so I’m just curious since deathclaw is supposed to be one of the best unarmed weapons
---
I would give more nuanced advice:
---
* RNG on modules is better because you know what piece of armor or weapon you'll be getting.  However, the purveyor always gives a 3 star when you ask for it, while the legendary crafting can also give you a 1 star or 2 star. Combine both facts and the RNG on the modules is only slightly better.
---
* If you are new to wastelanders, it will take a bit of time until you do the end mission. Buying modules is indeed the best option but that will mean you get no purveyor roles in the mean time.
---
* Legendary modules do have some weight to them (0.25) so if it'll take you too much time to get to the end mission of wastelanders, you'll have a lot to carry.
---
* anything you craft with legendary modules can not be traded. So if you save up on modules and than one day start crafting a shit ton, you risk getting overweight with legendary items you can not transfer to alts/trade. So your options will be dropping them or waiting until the next day to scrip them. That is why I do not recommend getting more than 10 modules.
---
* modules only work for the new wastelanders stuff. There aren't any good new rifles or good new melee weapons in wastelanders so if that is your build, the modules will only be usefull for your armor.
---
* the 'deep pocketed' mod on secret service armor does not exist (yet?). For me, that is a huge drawback and something a player with constant weight issues needs to consider.
---
Every hour mine brings me about 3 broken Chinese officer swords. No idea why!
---
OMG now I need the imposter sheepsquatch outfit
---
Fallout 101.
---
Hold down the exit button on any terminal and you'll back all the way out ;)
---
Power Armor is loud, goofy, shakes everyone else's world (HEY! look at me in my cartoon armor, ain't I cool... NO!).
---
If Bethesda made the camera shake user specific so when these obnoxious lumps run around me I don't get motion sick I wouldn't mind so much.
---
It's really bad in events like SBQ when there are loads of these tin cans running and jumping about. Arrrggg!
---
What’s worse is workshop defence when you get Enemies that either dont spawn properly or just spawn in really inconsistent locations, even weirder is defences around Radscorpions and mole rats, they are so painful especially after the wait for said wave to appear
---
The bundle rotates into the atomic shop quite regularly
---
Don't ever go to Vegas.
---
Server hopping never does anything for me, have tried it for high resource locations. Never works. I've stopped trying
---
Haven't played many Bethesda's games, have you lol.
---
ES4 Horse armor says hi.
---
Sounds like something may have tagged it before you hit it, like the security or another player. 
---
Did you get XP for the kill?
---
It's a secret! /s
---
When was there a a camo t65 paint?
---
Yeah, got xp. I was the only one there. Stuck in and killed all the ghouls in the room. Nothing else was around as far as I'm aware
---
I haven't been paying any attention to it, post-plushie-reward.
---
I think it's great that SCORE in 76 has mostly meaningless rewards. It means you can opt-in or out without feeling like you're missing something. But if you want something to do in-game and you've finished all other content, there are daily challenges for you to complete.
---
Although, we all know the Sasquatch plushie is essential.
---
Same here, 2 leg SB and no loot, even though I was the only one shooting at it.
---
Lol don’t be hating
---
Put a an automatic 38 receiver on the fixer and use it to get rid of the 38......pretty good gun actually
---
No idea, the only piece is as a ‘jetpack’ in the workbench
---
This is the scorhborhood and you are not welcome! \*SB screaming\* Great shots!
---
Weird. I hope that camo skin cos I've almost unlocked the full set
---
This has all of the rewards listed. The Christmas, Halloween, and Surviver rewards are active. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank
---
 I hope the skins come out*
---
You should not regret it. You got a legacy weapon, literally a weapon you can no longer roll or drop, for a weapon you can still get from drops or Murghrgrhgrhgr. Mod it with beam splitter and enjoy the carnage.
---
Thank you so much, I cant even describe how frustrating the last two hours of trying to find this has been lol. Thank you.
---
It’s a fun game that people like to bash because it’s popular
---
I was wondering the same thing. We didn't get a choice in Fallout 3 so I doubt we'll get a choice in the MMO-light version of the game. Grind uber alles.
---
No problem. I think I heard their being patched out again soon. Probably in update 21 in a week or two.
---
It does not work for resources. You have to pick up 180 things for stuff to start respawning. I was doing it to farm xp at West tek
---
Every time I scroll past a post with SS in the title I have to double-take and make sure the F076 community isn't praising Hitler or something lmfao
---
You can not choose which cards you use for upgrade - that can be problematic. Example: So if the coin trade rate gets changed back and you will get the same gold card twice from perk packs. If you saved your perk pack you can upgrade a gold card with 2 normal cards to upgrade it to rank 3 and sell it for 15 coins and then do the same for the second gold card. If you opened the packs you would waste the second gold card for upgrading and get less coins in total. I know its hypothetical as the feature is still in development, but until the legendary perks go live I will keep my perk packs unopened. Bubblegum is not that hard to get if you know where to look for.
---
Thank you, any idea if you have to wait a day for the next one to unlock or can they all be unlocked now? Again thanks for all your help
---
MODUS today! John Henry Eden tomorrow!
---
Line in the sand isnt so bad, they spawn decently fast and you know where they are
---
Workshop defenses oh lord the worst. And they dont even show you enemy locations until youve fucked about for 5min
---
Also recently had a line in the sand where all 15 scorched or so just plopped in the middle every time and we just lit em up with teslas, just 1000+ xp every 20 seconds and did that like 15 times
---
This happened to me one time in almost 900 hours last week. One time. I switched servers and it was fixed. I didn’t know this was a “known bug”.
---
Thats oddly specific. Glad i stopped trying lol. People used to say to do it for resources but clearly everyone was wrong unless it worked at launch years ago
---
&gt;Why the hell would you put a cap on custom names?
---
Because they're not held on your local platform, but on their servers which aren't limitless.
---
There are specific cases where that is true. Weight wise it is not. For the AP boost, Non-VATS builds will not care.
---
It’s more information that the servers have to keep track of. Just like the stash and camp budgets, if it were unlimited, the servers couldn’t run.
---
I just read that myself. I know I unlocked the survivors bow skin yesterday and was able to get 400 more xp build up for the next reward the same day. I’m gonna guess they broke that requirement when they dropped back in the loot pool.
---
i’ve always got 1 vendor full of decent weps and 1 full of decent armor, try to only sell things people would actually want. Seeing a vendor 1 cap away from crater with 30 weapons and 30 armor pieces is a decent business model lol
---
I've reached level 100 twice and two different characters, and I don't have the achievement.
---
I have a power armor build just I forget about it and started doing other stuff so now my perks are just mismatched
---
It is the penultimate reward on the SCORE race
---
It worked at launch. They patched it out like a year ago though. Its 180 items for World items, like say clip boards at sugar Grove or an asylum dress. And it's 60 I believe for containers
---
not every "lowlevel" is a "noob". maybe its a second or even third character a seasoned player takes into the field to reach a daily nw-challenge...
---
I’ve got used to it now I just make it one of my camp chores and do it after every session. I wish we could just break the ammo down though
---
That makes sense. Most materials aren't really hard to come by if you try hard enough so its not really needed. I sell a lot of bulked stuff and not like you need to repair things ever when you get kits from the queen
---
Im a stealth junkies build. Mostly use a lever action for every day game play
---
Switch to a handmade for the queen
---
And if they bring anything like vault raids back, i have enough strength points to use PA and heavies
---
There are improvements coming, though they don't go far enough!
---

---
They're trying too hard to be true to the established interfaces of computers in the Fallout universe and it's truly debilitating. Just let us enter a frigging number!
---
Worse for me is when you respawn but it still says you need to pick a location to respawn at (a second time!) and cannot move but can still get hit/rads etc., and usually the only choice is Vault 76. However it's coupled with the bug that unequips your armor so you're unencumbered and therefore cannot pick a location to spawn at, to even if you wanted to because you cannot FT when overencumbered. The only way to continue is to literally Alt-F4 the game.
---
I'm new to 76 but spent an embarrassing amount of time on 4 so got a pretty good idea at what I'm doing. I didn't even realise you could trade till about level 30. Could someone give me a power armour frame by accident? I got a full raider set when I was making the excavation set, no idea where from. There was another guy there making his aswell, I don't know if I some how nicked his or what, I didn't notice till I got back to base and felt bad.
---
Daguerre likes to use exactly the bench I need to use, 2 seconds before I realize I need to use it.
---
Downvoting someone for asking another person to be comprehensive with him not being so good with an idiom: not so nice
---
How frustrating man. Hope this isn’t the start of a new bug and was a one off. Happy hunting the rest of ‘dem legendaries’ though dude. Leader of the Pack is a good event for getting a few low levelled for dailies.
---
Go play Call of Duty and get through the full battle pass and come back and complain, actually in any game for that matter. Battle passes are only completed by the elite level players. The dailies are handed to you, it takes literally 30 minutes to get everything done if you skip the level up. If its to difficult for you dont know what to tell you, this is the easiest game on the market currently that isnt focused towards children and even minecraft and fortnite are way more hardcore games. Fortnite battle pass, good luck completing that without busting out the credit card, minecraft has a survival mode where 8 year olds have never even heard of a pacifist mode. Not everything in life is handed to you, even in video games, especially online multiplayer games, maybe redownload Fallout 4 and try out the mods?

---
Not a full on PA build here but I am built for heavy weapons.  Pretty much use them during scorched earth and that's it.  90 percent of the time I'm using auto rifles. Probably should just change my build since I have tons of unused points but I own too many really good heavy weapons at this point lol.
---
&gt;a huge dried up lake and a complete lack of a river running through Charleston.
---
&gt;Just think how beautiful Charleston could look and the possibilities of New Gad!
---
i'm not sure if you're unaware but the lake was there due to the dam, and the raiders destroyed the dam. so, no lake. this is also the reason that charleston is littered with boats and is mostly destroyed, despite the lack of a direct nuclear strike.
---
i do agree that there could be more waterways in the game, but i think it might be a design decision to stop people having to swim across them - imagine how frustrating the cranberry bog would be if some of the trenches were full (or half full) of water. you'd fall in one and wouldn't be able to climb straight back out. people without aquaboy would have a bad time.
---
I would subscribe to a channel with West Tek commercials
---
Agreed.
---
There should be an option in this To openly go against the BoS because you still consider them Traitors to the United states of America, And want to execute them as a result as Enclave.
---
I hope so too. Finished off the ghouls and I need 1 more now and hordes are pretty good too. The horde boss is always legendary and the only enemy you need to kill for the event
---
Bloodied/QOL
---
I used to be flat out commando damage, now I'm around 75% damage and have thrown in perks like scrapper and fireproof.
---
I got fed up of always switching perk cards and also of dieing every time a car explodes.
---
Running fireproof with a dense chest also means I take 0 explosive damage from cars exploding and also scorch beast ranged attacks.
---
I don't miss the damage, I don't miss the perception I sacrificed and I do enjoy my new found survivability and convenience.
---
I recommend more people try and put some QOL changes into their build.
---
With a big iron on his dick
---
You can still get the stealth suit from Samuel with gold bullion if you grind the settler rep to neighborly. It's like 4000 bullion total for it though.
---
I only play Nw because of the seasons reward but atleast I turn this Auto Team search function of and play 100% solo
---
The whole application just like the assignment of the first programming course in Computer Science degree. The assignment is normally about creating a command-line application with some menu options and that is exactly the same structure as the ammo converter.
---
Have you played since wastelanders? If you on PC can help out. 30 is pretty low to be running a nuke. The only thing they can take off you is junk. Also next time just change servers unless you friends with em they can't follow
---
I'm currently unyielding because it's pretty much the only way to lvl up at about lvl 700,and because it's also easier for the score run.  It's boring tho.
---
take his junk then, if you know what i mean
---
No not what I'm saying. Keep all other mutations as you like, it's just bloodied is really just gear, 2 perk cards and one mutation.
---
Bloodied unarmed, so much fun.
---
I was thinking about an Arena with lots of Deathclaws that you enter and hope not to die. If you survive, you automatically get some really good loot.
---
What’s your preferred play style
---
That’s what I am. Most fun I’ve had playing this game.
---
Step one pick an end game build, next buy 2 star weapons / armor to start that build.  Once you have that complete .  buy 3 stars or start getting modules saved up for wastelanders gear.
---
Someone call Ward a priest. 😂
---
I looked at my raider cage and I still don’t get it
---
Nope. I think he counts as cryptic enemie which can not be tamed. Beside the snallygaster. But not sure if this one is a cryptic or animal tbh
---
Wait a few minutes in between server hopping. It tends to put you back into the same server (not always) if you try to join a server immediately.
---
Isnt there like a friendly version of moth man
---
Heavy PA build because TSE Gat Laser is OP and Bethesda ruined VATS for me so becoming a living A-10 Warthog was my only other option
---
I'm not sure on the answer but I'll just go ahead and say that it would be to much fun. It couldn't possibly be allowed
---
The Fanny Pack of Holding.
---
Edit: fuck I'd pay Atoms for a fanny pack
---
Admittedly it would be nice but you also have to think that not all body’s of water are the same so there would have to be lots of different sizes and even then it might not fit the area you had in mind
---
Perhaps if they made it modular a bit like the shack bridge in fo4 but less ugly
---
I do use auto launcher as well. I picked up a two shot the other day that is honestly the greatest. Just a heavy gun and ammo is heavy. I almost included that in my comment as a backup option. You are wise
---
Oh yeah i did that today. By myself and tons spawned. When i FINALLY dealt with them, somebody else shown up, and the last 3 minutes, not one ghoul. Ridiculous. Standing still for 3 minutes.
---
I wanted the treasury notes. But nah, not again. It feels like they are taking the piss out of my free time. I dont like it.
---
They're crafting materials for legendary items like SS armor or gauss weapons etc.
---
So I’m allowed to do what I want as a new player I just shouldn’t overload your screen with emotes?  We are extending this to help who u want to help.
---
Bloodied melee. Unarmed preferred. Paired with explosives like Nuka nates, orbital strikes and a Two Shot Auto grenade launcher or sometimes a flamer for fun.
---
I’m unarmed but nothing special since it’s my first and main character however when I make a new one I’m going to do a sneaky vats build
---
Lol that sounds super fun! 
---
But yeah I’m pretty certain PA walks right through
---
I use a non Power Armor Heavy Weapons Full Health Vanguard Build. 
---
This is what I'm currently using:

---
Get someone to help you read it again. I made it abundantly clear in plain English that I was not
---
Used in crafting legendary like secret service armour
---
just tweak bloody mess perk card and viola
---
Yea after a event you can get a XP boost from the friendly mothman but that's it.
---
Can I have your 10mm? I use my explosive instigating 10mm smg to clear silos.
---
Oh so perhaps I used one yesterday when I modded a legendary vampire Chinese officer sword to be electrocuting 🤷🏼‍♀️ is that how it works ?
---
I didn’t know there was an AP boost for that. I think I need to respec (VATS build)
---
problem is a lot of players have god rolled weapons one hitting everything and killing 5 top tier enemie in seconds. I think events was not designed to this fast killing.
---
At point when you start onehit lvl68 enemie you are basically god in any event and every time counter takes forever.
---
Hoping this problem solve upcoming npcs scaling.
---
Workshop waves are so bad its unbearable. I literally take a workshop and leave immediately. Then do something else until it tells me to "retake it" It least then its one wave of whatever mob standing still. 
---
Then i dont have to worry about wasting my time putting down resources since they cant of attacked em since i never put em down.
---
Then I can put them down knowing i got some time before I can ignore the next time it comes again.
---
So that after you buy the plan in GB? I’m new to this haven’t bought anything yet as I can’t make up my mind what the best thing to buy is I’ve got 750

oh my god thank you
---
The only thing in the the Legendary Run that fits my theme is the Vault Tec CAMP skin. I'd only buy something so unnoticeable like that if it left and returned with at least 50% discount and I had extra Atoms. The only other thing I'd have considered buying was the Ammo Converter. But I wait for reviews before buying. The clicking simulator would have been a pass.
---
Agreed. Bloodied builds do so much damage anyway it makes no difference past a point what extra perks.you have. I've been using good with salt instead of bloody mess for a start.
---
I usually use a high health hybrid unarmed/commando. I can switch to an acceptable grade of any weapon at any time,even tho i can't be min maxed(not needed).
---
Before fast traveling to the fight, I always make a note of where the group of people are in relation to the circle (like to the west).  When I finish fast traveling, I immediately turn in the direction I noticed and just start sprinting in that direction until I determine that I'm not in the nuke zone.
---
TSE Minigun PA build. Not because the damage is extraordinary (it’s decent tho) but because streaming a bajillion explosions down a hallway is the most enjoyable thing to me in this game. If it goes boom, I like it. If goes boom literally 1000 times before I need to reload, I LOVE it.
---
This may sound stupid but are you sure it was legendary 
---
The amount of times I have seen I diseased ghoul with that little biohazard symbol thinking it says legendary with a star is unbelievable
---
Well done man, doing the whole thing properly is the way to go first few times, you'll destroy it for yourself otherwise, I know there are tempting speed run videos out there to emulate, but not first time...after that I can understand just glitching through it, I've still to attempt it, but this is by design.. I've learned from Skyrim and Fallout 4 to just leave stuff undiscovered and incomplete until bored shitless with the game, im a natural compleatist so this isn't an easy thing to do .but apart from the glitches and bugs Which can drive a person nuts in 76 I frigging love this game and want to savor it ..I'm level 241 now and still have about 20-30 undiscovered places yet to visit..I have the," I've become death" badge but that was from a team and I wasn't even there.. I've also completed the Bullion quest because I wanted that jetpack so much but yeah...still things to look forward to that keep it interesting ✌️
---
My guess is that it takes even longer to get dirty water from the sink than it does from the hand pump.
---
Nope. They are just for crafting the new endgame items.
---
Gotcha
---
No.
---
They only work when crafting SS Armor, the Gauss Shotgun, Minigun and Pistol.
---
No. There are specific plans bought with gold bullion. You need to have the legendary modules to craft the gun or armor. They aren’t used to upgrade items you already have.
---
I will test it for a week, I took out 1 in sneak and actually the damage is kind of significant in number, +50 with demolition 3, its fun so far
---
Shotgunner. I just really like shotguns in video games and they're broken as af in vats
---
Sounds more like they dropped it.
---
Gotcha thanks
---
They are a crafting component required to craft the following end game gear.
---
Armor:
---
- Secret Service armor
---
- Solar armor
---
- Strangler heart power armor
---
- Thorn armor
---
Weapons:
---
- Cattle prod
---
- Gauntlet
---
- Gauss minigun
---
- Gauss pistol
---
- Gauss shotgun
---
- Plasma caster
---
Its the middle one that looks simply like the wall has collapsed. Make sure the steps face the hole in the wall.
---
Been playing my alt a lot more. She is a sneak melee mistress of mysteries build. She is a meat eating, whiskey drinkin, badass. I rock the blade of bastet and the garb. 
---
Here is my build for her.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1665f8&amp;d=s52ss2si2sj2sg2aj2ar2ao0ae2a04c81ce0cd1l71lt2lu2es2eh2i44&amp;m=cfe8hb3
---
Just to add. I played line in the sand today cus i was in need of treasury notes. 14 minutes it took. Not cus it was hard. Cus for about 9 minutes we were standing twiddling our thumbs. This is why i dont play line in the sand bethesda. Sort it out ffs. Look at how fucking boring some of your "events" are.
---
* junkie heavy PA gunner: great carry weight, immortal tank. Can handle me playing drunk. I totally overdid the tank perk cards (born survivor level 3 + first aid level 3 + field surgeon level 2 + t65 medic pump) but it is nice to know you can't die. (unless encryptid + lots of lag )
---
* junkie full health commando: surgical damage. High health so again difficult to die.
---
* bloodied commando: great surgical damage. I don't like dying (immersion) so I prefer my junkies build.
---
* bloodied heavy PA gunner: awesome DPS. Dies a bit too much but I have so many good guns for this one, I'm not changing it anymore. Still my least favorite.
---
* full health shotgunner: just cool to one-shot most enemies.
---
It says on the actual perk card!
---
No, they are needed when you craft stuff after plans from the plans you buy with gold bullions.
---
You have to complete the Wastelander questline first.
---
for the most part, there are many player in the wasteland that love to help lower players. I'm glad that you have had the opportunity to interact with some of them
---
Its been offered by another player. I'm on PS4, i have a ton of legendary armor and weapons, as well as serums, chems, etc. If you are on PS4 shoot me your PSN and you are more than welcome to peruse my  inventory and pick out some things
---
My wife and I both play, You're more than welcome to add us and team up with us whenever we are online
---
They are all unlockable now but you can only get one at the time so once you finish grinding XP for one item your XP will begin counting for the next item.
---
If you try to jump to a new server quickly it will put you in the same server.
---
There's a quick workaround though. Before you log out of the server, click on any player in the server (in the world map) and select "Block for session". This will make sure that the next time you try to search for a server you won't be on the same server that that player is in, thus putting you on a new server.
---
After you completely exit the game the player will be unblocked automatically.
---
Source: Thousands of hours in the game and having the same issue before.
---
Just a vats rifle build
---
I would also like the same stairs found in houses across the wasteland. The ones in the corner that are L shaped and against the wall. That alone would make building so much more efficient and not to mention cleaner. I try to make my home look the part of the area. That part alone ruins the immersion. So the winding staircase half up on wall and the rest against another wall would be amazing and I already know NPC can be coded for walking them.
---
Berserker'S Pipe Rifle Medic, i like suffering :D
---
Raider and settler dailys + public events. You see them on the map marked with a '' ! ''
---
You can't tame the God!
---
You don't get bullion from the dailies, you get treasury notes to trade in for bullion. I don't think other dailies award notes.
---
 Many public events also award treasury notes, but I'm not sure if all of them do.
---
Since at no point did you say that you managed to get to level 100 before moving on and trying again. For all I know you could of gotten the autocomplete challenges bug in a similar way and the game said you got it before you did and never gave you the achievement. There’s tons of ways “glitches” could be taken to mean when you give so little details.
---
Definitely legendary. Even said legendary in the name. I took a pic but it doesn't let me post with the pic. Went away then looked again just in case it didn't load the loot properly and there was no legendary. There was still other junk on it though so it just didn't load a legendary item
---
And for Season 3, they recolor the ghillie suits blue and yellow and call them Vault-Tec ghillie suits.
---
It depends on your build and preferences. I’ve avoided anything reducing strength
---
Explain this one more lol
---
Just level 16 atm, but I am going for a shotgun / 2handed hybrid build.
---
I just enjoy running in loud and proud, but since crafting shotgun shells is a pain because of the plastic it takes I will keep a melee sidearm for weaker enemies.
---
Let's see how things hold up later. Planning to go neither bloodied or junkie, so...
---
Sorry, no can do.
---
" So what if there was a camp item, an armor paint job, or a weapon paint job? You pick which you want. They really aren't Legendary if everyone gets them, are they? " That's a crazy idea. Imagine if the challenges rewarded Atoms instead of SCORE. We could have all of the stuff in the Legendary Run, a system that relies on the Atomic Shop, actually show up in the Atomic Shop. And we could buy or not buy whatever. It's almost like that crazy system we had just a few weeks ago.
---
I eat dog food exclusively so I run the perk to gain benefit from that, also rejuvenated to make the most of what little health I have.
---
Max Bandolier, sturdy frame and travelling pharmacy, aswell as max batteries included and thru-hiker.
---
I still have 1 rank of bloody mess as it stands as nothing jumping out at me to replace it with.
---
Is it petty that this is one of the big reasons I quit playing for awhile?
---
Sounds like anti armor or instigating shotguns are the way for you then
---
Yup, those are on my wish-list as well.
---

---
Combine it with a BER/FFR Pipe Rifle and you're set
---
Play it
---
I used to do that but am now on a strict buff food diet. I'm running a max xp build at the moment for the legendary run so I have a lot of wasted points in intelligence but I'm going to rebuild once it's done but I don't think I'll bother doing max damage again unless any new content needs it.
---
Nocturnal? Worthless.
---
I wouldnt call it a mistake as I do it while knowing there worth.
---
I sell good gear for very low prices. I do this to empty my stash and because I dont really have a use for the items or caps (yes I still need some plans but I dont really care for them)
---
I do a half tanky PA build, half stabby slicey stealth build.
---
You still can server hop in public servers. But private servers will always load you in the same world.
---
Kinda, every level after 50 you can either move 1 special point or get 1 new card. I changed from stealth sniper to heavy PA and it took like 60 levels to finish.
---
Funny I had a ~Level 184 (name began 'Two') yesterday who was annoying me. I was taking an unowned camp for the score when this guy jumped in and explosive killed me. Then when I tried to return and pick up my junk, he killed me again. Some people are just assholes through and through.
---
What made you decide to do this?
---
Yes i got the atoms and the outfits
---
In my experience players group up according to the bonus they want when it comes to event groups and building groups. I think people are finally waking up to Building groups providing an INT bonus and therefore a better one to go for for general play since you get the xp boost on every kill, quest, event and even building/crafting etc.
---
I havent participated in any of the others. Id say the ones like casual or role playing would possibly attract players that want specific group interactions rather then boosts though.
---
So i guess to answer your question - a bit of both
---
There’s nothing to patch
---
Felt bored, wanted a challenge and public teams, mostly public teams
---

Yea add me kenseiii_
---
I’ll be on at 7pm eastern. I’ll just give it to you.
---
Oh man this sucks then
---
I said "THE FALLOUT FOREVER ACHIEVEMENT HAS GLITCHED FOR ME"
---
It will be midnight in the UK il Be fast asleep by then, thanks though!
---
Well if you're on PS4 we can play together or against each other if you want, so I can proof. If you don't want to PvP delete your toxic comments. (all if you're on PS4 of course)
---
So the light on the ss helmet does work I hear mixed answers
---
Agreed!
---
Oh hey, a fallout fan with c-ptsd! We should start a club :D
---
For real though, I really get where you’re coming from. It’s made such a difference for me, and I’ve got some life long friends because of it. What platform are you on? It would be cool to team up, talk about things, whatever!
---
Same old record...welcome to Bethesda’s Wasteland
---
So next year lol
---
He didnt order anyone. He was just pointing out good etiquette I think.
---
Edit: saw the edit only now ,sorry
---
I don't even understand the Question.
---
Only if you continuously hop private servers. 
---
You can hop private, public, private, public etc and it should always give you new servers
---
Yeah I don’t play nuclear winter. It’s not a part of the fallout game in my opinion.
---
That's not what I'm suggesting at all.
---
You can find that at Tyler County Fairgrounds.
---
Pretty sure it's a static drop around that area.
---
Does this make it more powerful than using .45?
---
That's just good etiquette. I always assume that more experienced players have ...well... more experience :)
---
Hey Todd, where's my big titty nude mod at?
---
For my Junkie char I go with Daddy-O, Day Tripper, Med-X, Mentats &amp; Psycho. -2 CHA, -1 the rest, and -20DR. 
---
Offset this with Herd Mentality mutation and you're gtg.
---
yeah, it's not the best as currently is. Mostly mind numbing to have to do all the repeat of converting ammo.
---
My mate and I do this - he gets all the .44 and I get all the 5.56.  Except now he's started using a handmade too, so no more ammo for me.
---
Some colours are highly collectable. Big oof.
---
Unarmed build. All armor has +1STR and 2 pieces have 50% reduced fall damage legendary effect. I can 1 shot charred feral ghouls which is why I made this build.
---
I can use heavy weapons and power armor for nuke zones (can also use stealth suit now) and ive got a combat rifle and tormentor perk to cripple scorchbeast wings.
---
It saves tons of ammo running unarmed weapon and it deals real nice damage. I can carry a bazillion food, drink, chems,energy and explosive ammo. So for me it feels like a jack of all trade build which let's me do almost everything besides stealth.
---
I always load into the same private world. I use it to feed supplies to an alt character. Even if I server hop to a public back to a private and vice versa. My meat piles are always there on a private server.
---
I tried to make a pistol build work.  I'm slowly building up levels to shift points to make it commando instead.
---
Could you say that something is afoot with it?
---
You also get treasury notes from Davenport's photo quest at overseer's home.
---
Yeah.  Like, I understand using a terminal screen in the context of the design they've used for the machine, but the terminals are always slow and annoying.  It can look the same, just give it the same type of screen as the vendors.
---
You can respec but for the new quest line I decided to just start fresh.
---
Purchasing it
---
That’s actually infuriating
---
Building is best for leveling up since you can get the buff doing anything. 
---
Events is good if you're, well, doing events as often as they pop up. 
---
Hunting is too situational for most people, and not worth the trade off of being in another type of group. 
---
Role-playing groups are imo a waste of time. The buff is nearly worthless in most situations. 
---
A true chad of a group leader will actually change the group type as you play. It'll be building most of the time, then if everyone gets together for something like Encrypted or Scorched Earth they switch to hunter right before the boss is dead, then immediately to event to get the bonus event xp. And then back to building until the next event
---
I have a pink one on display just bc it's pink
---
This is it. I'm happy to use it at the end of a session to just get rid of what's been picked up, but everytime I start on my pile of 2000+ shotgun shells, I just give up after three or four goes.
---
I’ve noticed that and those who hide some where safe during the entire event and do nothing. Once the event ends, they fast travel out. What fun is that? I don’t mind helping people out in events but at least do something. If it’s too difficult do it at a higher level.
---
Building for normal game play, when in an event try to gauge its progress and switch the team to event for the event xp then switch back to building after the event.  The team leader can switch the team goal without breaking the bonds.
---
It bothers me how we can't enter numbers anywhere.
---
- Ammo converter: digging through the UI.
---
- Vendors: moving a slider left and right instead of typing a number.
---
- Crafting: not so much as a "craft x" or "craft all" button; just gotta mash the spacebar.
---
What is that hood in the picture? That looks awesome. Also I don’t think the bomber jacket is that rare I’ve gotten loads of them from turning in technical data but I’ve never seen this one
---
No it's less powerful 60 damage but it spits out explosive . 38 really fast so it's great for the lower level enemies and uses ammo that you generally can't even give away.
---
Bloodied melee/unarmed. I did the weekly weapon challenge for the unstoppable monster and got an unyielding piece from the purveyor. Now I’ve got perks maxed out to switch to a heavy gun or shotgun. I’ve also got 5 pieces of unyielding cav combat armor. I love it. I one tap most things and chunk the queen while other players shoot her in the sky. I do miss my meat hook and hope they’ll glitch it again.
---
Wise Mothman decends to Landview Lighthouse from on high to give blessings to those who give him the gift of bright light. He cannot be tamed, as there is no greater force than the Wise Mothman.
---
Make it a 4th star!
---
Carnivore + Food + Strange in Numbers
---
The last patch increased benefits from food when mutated. Before, Glowing Meat Steaks used to give you +10% Melee Damage. Now, with Carnivore and SiN active, that bonus is +25%.
---
The crazy part is you can still stack +Melee Damage food, and there are 7-8 of them. When I took the picture in my post, I believe I only had three buffs active (Mutant Hound Chops, Glowing Meat Steak, and Yao Guai Ribs), these being for me the easiest to farm so I can have at least a few consistently active.
---
This, alongside a standard Bloodied Unarmed build, a full Unyielding set, and all of the other ways to increase melee damage, and you can get up to some truly insane numbers—especially with 3x sneak attack criticals from Ninja 3*.
---
That being said, you don’t really need that much damage. I don’t have a legendary Bear Arm yet, so I just use a non-legendary one and it still one-shots most enemies I encounter. I also don’t use Bloody Mess 3* outside of SBQ and ISS fights as Good with Salt 3* is so helpful to have consistently active.
---
Bethesda: I have good news for you we have implemented a catch up mechanic just for individuals like yourself who came in late into the Season or can't be asked to log in Daily in order to unlock this content for free.
---
For the low low price of 150 Atoms per rank YOU TOO can be on the way towards completing the Season in time. 
---
I'm just saying OP the Season has 6 weeks and 2 days left so it's not too late to try and catch up.
---
Pretty sure the six mods available for the club are only available as plans from the Free Range event. Scrapping won't work.
---
Also, between the low rng, and the 22 total plans (crook, staff, and club) from that event, it's going to take a lot longer than 10 times to gain them all.
---
Oop
---
xD Thank you!
---
How?
---
Half PA half sneak build for both of my moods, really want to transition to a bloodied but it’ll take a while and completely change my perk set up. Anyone know if it’s really all it’s hyped up to be?
---
Yeah its pretty time consuming to switch builds. Usually when I make a new build, I create a new character and play the living hell out of it on a double XP weekend
---
I thought that was the blue outfit.
---
I don't remember what plans I have unlocked for the club (probably all?), but I can help you out with that. I won't be back on until around 8PM Est.
---
You can also ask on the market subreddit, and ask for someone with high karma?
---
LOL
---
I have my own theory on what causes it. Spaghetti code.
---
reddit is the worst place to report bugs to Beth.
---
The only way where it **may** get some attention is by opening a ticket as dev-feedback on their site. But you'll not receive a reply there either.
---
This doesn't work for me.
---
Regarding the workaround, who wants to install a 74GB game in their OS partition... Not me at least.
---
What outfit is that?
---
Ya I guess I just looked at damage before I ate all my food buffs. I have carnivore, talons, and the other melee mutation I can’t remember atm. I also use the standard bear arm because I think it looks the coolest lol, still trying to get the plan from project paradise.... maybe one day. Thanks for the reply
---
How did he get his doctorate though
---
Yeah, lets save up those challenges for when they pay double.

Count me in! /s

Used a gauss rifle for 6 months. The sound of a gauss rifle charging just grates your eardrums after a while.

wait wait wait...
---
the bomber jacket on fallout 76 is this flight jacket over the orange and light grey flightsuit.
---
this looks like the jacket over the officer jumpsuit, aka the black one. 
---
are there more than one bomber jacket?
---
this one: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Bomber_jacket_(Fallout_76)
---
Str agi luck, bloody unyielding/pa allows powerfists of sneaking doom, bloody heavy weapons in or out of power armor , gunfu turns you into a sniper master (plasma caster) or one shot shotgun master.  Full unyielding , all the mutations,  good with salt for food that lasts. Tanky enough to waltz through westek or solo sbq. Sell all your .45 and .556 to the commandos for an easy extra 1000 caps a day guilt free all you'll never need it. Also 400 to 450 carry weight for the thousands of legendaries you'll be farming. Plus you pop in a 2 hander and jump around smashing everything like the hulk/conan. All this just by swapping perk cards as needed. 
---
Down sides , poison damage , having to farm lead once in a while to keep the 5mm beast fed.
---
you mean radiation rumble? also, i agree. you're level 300, xp means nothing to you, get in the caves and grab the glowing green rocks.
---
alchohol
---
mentats
---
psycho
---
buffout
---
medx
---
If it's worth anything, I'll use it myself or give it to a friend for free. I won't sell it for almost useless caps. I've never made use of my own vendor before the Legendary Run. And now it's only in hopes that somebody buys 1 ammo three times in order to complete the SCORE challenge before I do it at another player's vendor. Expect more and more trash CAMPs to come online, not less.
---
Did you enter a public in between hops? Privates are persistent for about 15m after you leave one.
---
Ah, you're right. The in-game has the blue apron.
---
The clean version with the red apron was an Atom shop item. Must be a saleable/tradeable item that they never fixed.
---
I put him in a cell with a level 0 lock on it.
---
Ah yeah i can see that happening lol. A few days ago i managed to trade for a bloodied explosive gauss rifle. im loving it so far :)
---
I probably wont say the same after 6 months
---
Ok , im at 4/5 atm 👌
---
You get the soiled suit when you buy it with the tokens. It is the suit Fuzzy Brenda is wearing at the park entrance.
---
I run a non V.A.T.S pretty stealthy commando on a full heath build and it works pretty well. Run an explosive fixer and I like it. Would love to find an AA FFR AGI fixer though 🤞
---
Imagine if MODUS randomly appeared on any given TV...
---
I have. I even picked up my stuff from where I died earlier. And I always bust a block at fort defiance and load in there to see if it's still broke.
---
I do AWOL all the time and know how to share.  Did it with another level 400 something the other day (I’m 419) and he one shots the final legendary.  WTF!  Just not cool.
---
I see this bastard at Riding Shotgun a little while later, and his move has brought the asshole out of me, so I got to the Cpt first and screwed him back on that one.  There was a third running it, a 70 something, and I followed him to his camp and dropped the legendary I got plus an extra.
---
I’ll admit it’s saved me on making 5mm for my Gatling gun a few times...BUT BOI DO I HATE USING IT. 
---
It’d be nice if they could add a convert all option and/or make it work with a few perks like Super dupper and ammo smith so you get better prices and more ammo for using. Both would make it a lot better cause right now it’s still more worth me converting 15 lead into 180 5mm with a chance of it converting into 360.
---
To get the rare outfit drops you need to keep the bar around the middle. That is why high level vets don’t repair them.
---
Does SS armor even have ultralight?
---
Yep, as I said the low yield ones in the FO universe would cause way more fallout issues than the high yield ones from the height of the Cold War. The duration of nuclear winter or autumn is very unlikely to go beyond half a century, though. The long-term periods of solar obstruction our planet has experienced required ongoing volcanic eruptions or lava flows; even extreme bolide collisions that had global consequences did not have centuries of ash obstruction.
---
some of the mods are rare.
---
there are mods for the shepards crook, sheepsquatch club and sheepsquatch staff.
---
you only learn them with the plans that drop from free range. some are rare like the barbed flaminf mod.
---
Congrats to you, but that's disheartening for me. I thought I was being a wimp by not attempting it being at level 105. Guess I'll be waiting a bit more, hehe.
---
(edit 1) As an aside, does anyone have any stable crimson flux for sale (for tick blood tequila)?
---
Seriously? Hadn't heard that before.
---
I do get put in the same public server quite often these days if I try to hop during farming (my Mutant route)... I try to use people on my friend list to hop, to ensure I get on a different server each time, otherwise it's hit it miss...
---
Just teams I love them
---
Hide in the bushes naked
---
Trust me I've tried it all even up to twitter, they just tell me to try again or contact Playstation support. They only give me excuses or tell me to try again, I'm hopeful an upvoted post would get their attention.
---
most likely XP grinding for score. with the right buffs you can get the repeatable to trigger 3-6 times in the one event
---
Find a nice bush and hang out there for a while. 
---
If you’re actually interested in this mode. I’d recommend making a second character and tailoring the special points to the perk cards you want to use. Example, tenderizer is a great perk in NW,  but it requires 9 points in charisma which doesn’t work on my primary character. 
---
Play around with your deployment location, learn which locations have lots of loot boxes.
---
Mostly a non-bloodied/non-mutated stealth rifleman, but slightly unoptimised because I'm speccing into commando as well. Stealth rifleman is just the style of play I really enjoy. However, with just non-automatic rifles I found my damage wasn't what I wanted it to be when I did get detecting, or during events (as I've been doing them a lot more since the legendary run started). So I've started using automatics as well, and finding they're a fun option to have.
---
Haven't quite got all my perks lined up but as of two more level ups my build will look like [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=bc658b3&amp;d=sb2sf2s01sg2pd0pk0pl0pp2pg0ph0pi0po2ej2eh2c72cr0lt2a70am2ar2an2ah0i10i30ia0i50s11ic1) (intelligence is a mess but I'll sort it out once I've got the master infiltrator legendary perk). As you can see, I'm missing out on some damage by taking a mixed build, but I'm enjoying playing like this so it's all good by me.
---
DR/ER perks are specifically because I've been liking the chinese stealth suit for nuke zones, but found it does need a little bit of help defence-wise. Plus I can swap barbarian out for the three heavy gunner perks if I want to try power armour in future.
---
I'm not sure if it's been patch or not but there was a way to trade them using the legendary vendor machines
---
Stopped playing.
---
I’ve put some rugs, an oil lamp and that tree bench from nw. but didnt try anything bigger.
---
hope it helps.
---
Calibrated shocks. You won't regret it. Unless you are buying the plan, in which case check you have crafting mats.
---
Ment to put hat
---
Glad to hear it helped and people are being nice.
---
Some of us really pushed the limits during the double-xp event. I counted each repeatable completion with an external MTG life counter during the entire season :D And I remember doing no more than 35-60 repeatables every day before the double xp. But with double xp (and I also used lunchboxes most of the time during the event) that number skyrocketed to 130-256 repeatables a day. As a result I finished the season one day before the event ended.
---
I didn't even know you could repair them
---
He is cryptic
---
go to options find the setting called pacifist turn it on - it makes you unable to be targeted in pvp there is a few exceptions but for 99% of game you can't be hurt and your camp can't be damaged by anything but a nuke - that said there is a lot of areas nukes can't land so thats not hard either
---
It's the hunter's hood. It's in FO4, but not in 76 yet (though there are a few images in the Atom shop where the character modeling an item is wearing it.)
---
Me too, one time.
---
adarnnoob on YouTube has some good intro videos.
---
Yeah, but I think it's only when the data is found in the world, not when you pick up any that you already had. I think it only happens after you find the camp, as well: I had a dozen Technical Data before I did, and never got the quest.
---
Just so you are aware. You aren't supposed to sell or trade stuff on this sub.
---
Auto grenade launcher with grenadier perk = best way to tag. Does enough damage with no perks to tag (80-90), hits every mob (might want to shoot a second grenade next to the device to tag the top mobs) and there's plenty of hp left in the mobs for the others to also get XP :) Love it!
---
Og my god thank you bro i ment to post this on the marketplace😅 my bad
---
It's because they think someone else will do it. It's the same reason for a lot of problems all over the world.
---
Edited to include a break at the one point my research advisor may have allowed a paragraph split. Writing and reading in the format used for scientific literature leads to stream-of-consciousness-style long paragraphs that can be a chore for the eyes; my apologies for the lack of break. Similarly, it is hugely frowned upon to use active voice in such writing, which can hurt the heads of English and Literary Studies majors ;)
---
this! I once watched a level 200 trying to facetank the imposter sheepsquatch while she as cloaked.
---
HE DIED, RESPAWNED AND RAN TO HER FACE FIVE TIMES WITHOUT EVEN GOING TO ANY PYLON.
---
yea thats exactly what i mean
---
I'm using a full health combat shotgun build. It's low maintenance and does of a ton of damage in vats due to some sort of glitch.
---
We are in the same room so I am 100% aware they didn’t drop the raider armour it just kinda showed up
---
So, why are they an issue? Sun kissed sure, it gets rid of rads I believe, but concentrated fire helps with vats. Not even sure what Peng fu does, but why hate on a card that doesnt mess with your builds damage
---
If u’r on ps4 maybe i can help u and craft calibrated shocks for u
---
I don't see why that's not a thing. 
---
You wanna share a card?  cool...Let me remove it from my loadout if I see fit
---
Can unlock them all in a row, no need to wait a day.  If you are starting from level 1 the final one (the last Xmas outfit) will unlock around level 23.  Get grinding before the next patch if you want them all.
---
Technically the snallygaster is a cryptid as it counts for the "kill cryptids" challenges, but it's common enough that it does seem more like just another mutated wasteland creature. Lore-wise it's a result of the FEV, which is what created supermutants.
---
I am currently grinding for it myself.  I do the dailies mostly for the scrip but now also I have the goal to earn the costume.  I’ll probably put it on my Ally.
---
Thankfully the switch over isn't too terrible.  I only need to move around about 8 points total and the rest is just new cards. I'm level 80 something right now and have a pretty functional hybrid build going. Just going to leave it like this until I have all the points and weapons I need to go all in on rifles.
---
Why don’t you want concentrated fire?
---
Also you can hop on the mic and ask for a different card
---
peng fu does mess up vats, and since i do play with shotguns,   
---
and concentrated fire has a negative impact on the range and hit chance.
---
Peng Fu made me laugh. I think he meant Gun Fu- which I like, actually, though sometimes it can be annoying to auto-snap with vats to the next target when you don't want to, so I can see why it would annoy people. If there's a legendary in a group of enemies, sometimes you'll kill it and your character will spin around and do a 180 to aim at the next enemy, causing you to potentially lose sight of the legendary corpse.
---
the veil of secrets works as a gas mask, also the scout masks do as well
---
Build a few structures at a workshop in adventure and blueprint them. You can place blueprints in NW, creating fast defensive structures.
---
OK? And that glitch could mean literally anything. It could have disappeared from your game entirely. It could of been considered completed early and not given to you like many other things in the game right now. It could be that it gave it to you and took it back. I dont know what you mean when you say "glitched" and nothing more. I have explained this to you twice now. If you want to continue to have the same thing repeated to you, keep repeating the same thing back to me. I have nothing to do today.
---
It never gets better
---
I was at a line in the sand recently and seemed to be the only person that had noticed the sonar was broke. I logged out rather than fix it.
---
Okay but, what even use vats with a shotgun build? Have moderate recoil control and aiming abilities and you can hit anything while hip firing if you have the perception perk for better accuracy with shotguns.
---
As a new player, what does this mean: " I have free .38 and 44 ammo in my vendors "  
---
Is this in your camp or workshop? Can  you sell items to other players like this and you get the "profit" from it? Ive seen ppl mention it before but I never really visited anything from anyone yet.
---
Why do you insist on posting this same thing over and over on the subreddit? Its been explained to you by multiple people now that the achievements are broken as hell and you cant get that achievement right now. Your persistence is amazing though, both here and in-game.
---
Had 8 possum badges the other day and debated what to buy. Was going to get the high capacity mod again to sell it for a lot of caps. But instead decided to finish my plan collection and started buying things I hadn’t gotten yet. First three things were costumes so I bought all three. Right after that I realized I purchased the costumes again, not the plans for the costumes. Wasted 7 badges...
---
with vats they do far more damage
---
I didn't do all the settler quests so now if I want a Chinese stealth suit it will cost 4k gold. Seems like a significant punishment. It should be like 500 gold.
---
Ah I see. I dont understand why people use vats for anything besides semi auto rifle builds though, shotguns are point and shoot as long as you are picking the right things to use hip fire and any other gun uses too much ap.
---
If I saw something called "Jet Pack Paint" I would think it was paint and not a jet pack. It is weird that you can apply it to backpacks though.
---
That sounds nice but I wouldn’t be able to trust that things wouldn’t get lost forever or something:/
---
Well, one thing they never said is that they *will cater to the interests of every single person*. And if you haven't forseen that the game's multiplayer nature (which was a known fact by the time of its announcement) will eventually result in including modern online games' features like *inconveniencing people with some mechanics to make them wanna pay for the inconveniences to go away* or *grinding your way to the rewards you might want*, maybe you just don't need to try playing online games since this bs is everywhere nowadays.
---
You gotta be lucky to find an online game that does not feature something that requires players to pay for in game stuff or to grind for some stuff, I guess. But if I'm wrong, I dunno why you're arguing here about what bethesda needed to say to you personally so you'd be sure you will like this game no matter what. You can just play something you really like and stop this frustration with the game you don't.

sorry, m8. but you’re not 100% correct. 
---
both are very rare outfits. they only drop from events in the mire. the leather coat and the travaling leather coat have a drop chance of 0,02%
---
yes, and for me as a shot gunner, it does aim for enemies that are far out of range somewhere 100m away.
---
I recently reviewed the mutations and not running Adrenal Reaction has been one of the things I regret not doing earlier. -12 HP to do more damage as I take damage is worth it.
---
It wasnt all of a sudden added to to the fame, they are slowly introducing BOS related shit.
---
Uh, yeah because you hit every single pellet, but it's not really that much more. I took a look at it myself with my shotgun build and whether or not I use vats its 2 hits for mole miners unless it's a headshot, which is one. 
---
Also vats personally feels lazy, but it's part of the game and can be a fun way to do things, but if you wanna use vats and do a lot of damage, why not just use a combat rifle like everyone else, far better range and damage if you go with sneak and bloodied/junkies.
---
Rifles, shotguns, and melee that’d work really well. Heavy guns.... Not so much.
---
But I totally agree. Missed opportunity.
---
Adrenal reaction definitely good to have in your corner regardless of the build
---
Are you thick?
---
Stay out of bushes.
---
Also, rewarda are account based, so it may be worth it to run a NW secific character, so you don't have to mess with your SPECIALs in Adv.
---
You are told to repair them.
---
Depends on the build, some people have weapons and perks tailored to vats. Also many weapons inherently seem to actually do higher damage in vats, so there's that too. Then there are bugged "magic" weapons, which basically obliterate anything if used in vats but aren't anything special when used with manual aim.
---
I agree... the ridiculousness of a confetti kill is one of the reasons I love this game.  Random weirdness for all!
---
Ive explained to you multiple times now all the ways the achievement could be glitched and that you gave everyone here nothing to work with when you say "glitched". The only thick one here is you, choosing not only to ignore multiple times when people tell you its vague, but you continue to post in vague posts. Youve only once in this entire exchange mentioned what exactly that glitch was and only after it had to be coaxed out of you.
---
Yeah, at line in the sand it’s similar.
---
It's a daily. It's almost always been broken in some way. Originally it never triggered after the first run. Since they 'fixed' that problem it now pops up when it likes. There's been issues with any repeatable quests since launch at least.
---
One shot an uncountable number of enemies with pipe weapons from under the noses of Explosive Fixer types and PA Heavy gunners just to give them a taste of their own medicine - Line in the Sand is particularly fun as I VATS Gun Fu and watch them drop like dominoes whilst the heavies attempt to switch targets manually.. Ha ha ha, how do you like it!?!
---
Angry Turtle on YouTube has a video on the Gauss shotgun where he shows what each mod does.
---
Picking up everything i see. Junk and meds mostly.
---
I'd like to request an Addon that shows the Camp Budget on a Flamingo Scale (who needs bananas).
---
shotguns do  far greater damage in vats than just hip firing.
---
without vats i don't even scratch the enemy, but with vats, no problem to 1-shot kill a LV 40 grafton monster
---
Melee with food buffs.
---
One of my characters is a shotgunner and while I use gun-fu with him, I know exactly how you feel on this one. Mostly I use vats in tight groups, but if there's an enemy hiding in a bush a hundred yards away it'll target them on occasion. I wouldn't share that perk to avoid causing anyone else to deal with that hassle.
---
It can
---
then your shotgun is trash.   
---
mine does single shot kill a level 40 grafton monster with vats and without it doesn't even scratch it. I do play a BD 33 Vats shot gun.
---
Alright , 5 addictions now , they dont go away do they? Anything else i need to know?
---
Are you a bethesda employee? No, nothing you said helped even abit. It feels like you're just arguing to argue. I'm posting to gain Bethesda's awareness and spread knowledge about the bug that you can do nothing about. Only Bethesda can fix it.
---
Well yeah I get the vats legendary effects really making it nicer to use vats. But no weapon will do higher damage in vats because of vats alone, it's to do with rpm. I do know about the "magic" bugged effects. 
---
If I remember right from angry turtles video, there are a few effects that when combined with a high fire rate weapon (supposed to be close to 200 I think), something with the dps formula messes up and exponentially stacks the damage.
---
Certain legendary effects on shotguns cause them to be monsters when used in vats, definitely.
---
Leader of the pack is almost always up when I log in. I don't for the food, and drop the scrip ... er, legendaries at the overseers camp. Easy peasey.
---
Check YouTube some body killed it in 40 seconds with a b 2525 fixer solo
---
some terminals have animated screens before you use them
---
Adrenal is awesome for all builds, not just bloodied. Even full health builds will at some point take damage and get the damage buff. For bloodied builds its essential
---
This can happen with shotguns as well, not only high rate of fire weapons. With shotguns it causes each pellet to do the full damage individually instead of adding the pellets up to equal full damage together.
---
That would be great
---
I won a NW match at rank 0, only using that character as I needed the, rank up challenge done!
---
The mode is all about out smarting the players not out shooting them for me.
---
It is a blooddied  +33% vats hit chance combat shotgun.
---
Instigating Stealth Shotgun Rifleman Half Bloodied.
---
Yes, it does! I was using the mining helmet before I unlocked the SS helmet, and the SS helmet's light is much nicer.
---
Ok TikToker
---
I can't shake these nightmares. Floating in space forever. Just why?
---
yeah they musta programmed that on bring your kid to work day. that thing is the absolute grindiest grind of all.
---
Gary, wha-?
---
Damn.im now looking for a lmg.ultracite is the way to go on this one?what other gun is it better to craft ultracite as far as yields per material
---
Ah yes, bloodied. You see that's why your shotgun is stupid strong. Mine is just a AAE combat shotgun. There is no fun in one hitting enemies. Personally I think it's cool in practice,  but I also think it's boring because there is no real fun in it. 
---
You have a weapon with a legendary effect that is bugged, causing each pellet to do full damage instead of of the 1/8th it's supposed to do.
---
I have C-PTSD too and I have never been able to express WHY Fallout is my favorite series. It seems counterintuitive. I love your tattoo quote. I'm a grown ass woman of 40 and still find comfort in that same quote.
---
It’s great on PC
---
Do it properly the first time, then move the cursor off all the buttons and spam “E” until you run out of bullets or points
---
I grant you the cranberry big one could be annoying because I forgot that getting out of water can be cumbersome. But I do think it should be possible to get that lake filled up again cause just think how great a location New Gad could be if say scavengers tank the super mutants out with aid of the vault dwellers and turned it into a fishing/trade town and it gives aquaboy a bit more of a purpose other than exploring the deeper lakes in grafton or by thunder mountain power plant
---
nice photo, and well done. What platform do you play on?
---
Theres a spot by tanagra town thats pretty flat!
---
NE corner there's a pond with a crashed vertibird. Very serene spot. Had my camp there for a very long time.
---
I have not taken off my urban scout mask since beta
---
Ah, so it stacks up there too because of the individual pellets if you have the bugged effects. Didnt know that. Good thing to know then.
---
The +33% vats hit chance is one of the perks considered "magic" which causes the insane damage boost when in vats. It's a bug in the damage calculation from certain legendary effects that causes every pellet to do the full amount of damage instead of each pellet adding up to total damage.
---
Yeah I kind of figured out the same general idea and decided that there's only one of two possibilities here: 
---
1- someone at Bethesda finally figured out something about optimization and applied it to the newer pre-built structures
---
2- they have no fucking idea how much each of these things actually impacts the server and are just making arbitrary guesses
---
I guess technically there could possibly be a third option which is both of the above? But I don't really see any other viable options here
---
Anyone else watch The Office... this reminds me of the Planking episode... lol. :) You either get it, or you don't! And I... don't.
---
Xbox One unfortunately
---
My only issue is when someone shares a perk that removes rads in a team that obviously has bloodied builds in it.
---
Yeah, it's the same reason as ROF really, just that in the case of a shotgun, each pellet registers as a separate shot.
---
Its a fun game that got ruined by corporate interests. I remember when they were actually developing PvE. It was great
---
I'll check it out, thank you!
---
Some of these would be an actual be a welcome change.
---
I'll take a look, thank you!
---
I hope you find what you're looking for! Have a great day
---
What are some of the perks you’re running on your Bloodied Heavy vs your Junkie’s one?
---
it can be fun.
---
use grim reaper sprint and speed demon, then just rush into the gathering of the enemies. You have to be pretty fast.
---
I do play sneaking with a combat rifle with my second character.And i don't even use concentrated fire on this, because it does have a negative impact on range and hit chance. It's better to play without and just spend that extra bullet.
---
Yeah, it's just got to do with how many registered hits there are per second I suppose. Any gun with explosive and 100 fire rate can do it because of the secondary explosive hits.
---
I hung one and it could barely light up its own jar. Gave up on the idea of adding more as it's simply too dim and because it needs to hang its far too easy to walk past without even noticing.
---
Or Bethesda could just make them actual useful weapons. Think it's crazy how crap explosives are.
---
Because reality has limits.
---
Ah right I totally forgot about that overseers  Mr. Handy!
---
Broken gun talents ( magic weapons )
---
I must've missed it as well, where is it? I LOVE BEETLEJUICE! While discussing Beetlejuice easter-eggs (separate from Fallout) have you ever watched Dan Harmon's Community? If so, there's a great Beetlejuice reference that's literally 3 seasons of background build-ups for a brilliant moment!
---
tried it, only works during the quest and only on the creature types active for that quest. Was before wastelanders but I doubt they changed it.
---
I run a stealth rifleman on my main, with perks for more and stronger crits, and recently made an alt for shotguns.
---
The shotgun build is so much better in vats and the only vats perk I have is 1 in concentrated fire. I'm probably going to be using my alt as my main because of it.
---
okay thanks.   
---
This shotgun does exceptional well.   
---
But it isn't easy to play bloodied as a shot gunner, because you have to come very close to the enemy, and you also have to be very quick.    
---
Gun Fu does mess up vats, because it constantly tries to aim the "wrong" enemies. I have to shoot them in a specific order so i can't get hit by them.
---
It’s all RNG
---
I've adopted many a noob, sometimes had the same issue of scrounging.
---
One guy  called steve something became like a spoiled step-child, costantly following me,sending request for ammo etc.
---
He disappeared for a few weeks, then he popped up this weekend and dropped around four thousand assorted rounds of ammo on  the floor for me.
---
I was like a proud dad... little shit finally all grown up.
---
i have similar experience with killing legendary enemy faster than they start glowing (fist few seconds). Try make sure they glowing few seconds or even better take half of his hp and make him mutante.
---
Logical explanation: i think game spawn normal npc and then decide if its legendary or not. When you run too fast and connection is not good, there is chance you kill npc too fast and game does not have time for spawning legendary item or cant even make decision what to spawn.
---
Recommendations: slow down
---
Also i have even worse experience when cleaning map super fast, i know exact place where they spawn and i kill them even before they render. I got XP but corpse has no item, not even junk. All these problems are because there are running speed mutations, effects and OHK weapons, the game just doesn't catch up. .\_.
---
Yeah sadly hating on the game is still cool and people don’t like to walk into the game with a more open mind. Even though it has its faults, this game has a special place in my heart.
---
I don’t really have these issues besides a little lag from time to time, but no more than any other online game.
---
Didn't know about the explosive damage counting toward the bugged hit register. Guess we both learned something here. 😂
---
I like to be alone and look after myself most of the time - similar to real life.
---
I had a fight against the imposter sheepsquatch yesterday though and it was quite fun when everybody  joined in.
---
And after everybody left my junk bag was still there :)
---
I just did the same thing! I was super stoked to get it and yes it's nice, but it should be a wall decoration like the hanging mobiles if it's going to be that dim 😊
---
I dont think you understand. I like a challenge, I understand it can be fun to just go in and wipe out a ton of enemies. But I like to have a semi difficult time in the games I play.
---
 Do I want to be able to have a low health build setup so i can show off a cool weapon now and then? Of course, i just dont want to constantly one hit almost everything I encounter. It just gets boring and too easy, then you gotta go do specific events that are time consuming just to enjoy the game a little bit.
---
Not saying it's the wrong way to play the game, it's just not the way I wanna play.
---
Throwing away ultracite armor on my first character without realizing it.
---
Thank you, and you too
---
thanks.   
---
yes, i do have the same problem. and i do rush, i have to shoot the enemies in a specific order, just that they can't hit me. gun-fu does aim very randomly.
---
Yes yes, the explosive hits count as a seperate hit, which stacks with your other hits. Then you just need the secondary bugged effect and you have an actually broken weapon.
---
 Like the lmg that shoots .308. With explosive bullets and any of the busted effects it is "magical". If you happen to get 25% fire rate, you are also in luck as I believe it boosts the fire rate just enough.
---
"  you're not the boss just because you play it all the time "  
---
Well, you're sure as s\*\*\* not the boss at level 5 either.
---
You've got to think outside the box =0 
---
[There's a junk pile near some water and i was there for about a year.](https://imgur.com/0vPSBtg)
---
You can build over the junk pile. Of course this is no good if you want to use prefabs.
---
https://youtu.be/0raSbTxHfZ0 — 4 hit kill, about as quick as I’ve seen.
---
1, this is not the Bethesda support forums. Bethesda employees barely visit this subreddit and they only ever discuss the bugs that are affecting gameplay massively.  
---
2, this is a bug that you can do something about, but you chose to argue and act like an idiot the whole time so nobody ever got to that point with you
---
builds and things that need nerfing!
---
so true.
---
Rushing into a bunch of enemies as bloodied isn't a challenge ?  
---
They hit you once and you are dead, so you have to be quick. And you also have to shoot them in a specific order, so you won't get hit.
---
Its a big deal to anyone doing it solo for the first time. Its cool as fuck, well done bud.
---
Right now the first - limb damage is one of broken affixes, so you'll do massive damage and save a lot of ammo while being almost impossible to kill (due to vampire effect), but when (if) they'll eventually fix it, the second will be better damage-wise.
---
I have a similar build. A vampires shotgun and a bloodied board. I only have 2 unyielding pieces so far, but I do quite well. The vampire shotgun keeps me healed, and works very well with crippling legs in vats, and the bloodied board does over 300 damage so I can finish off the enemies that can no longer walk
---
Both? Switch when you need to heal.
---
Ranking up your Overseer rank is incredibly easy. Make a new toon (or use one that hasnt played NW yet), turn off squad fill, play one game of NW. As long as you dont die in the first 2 minutes youll get enough XP to level up. Delete the character and do it again if its repeatable. I dont understand why people complain about Beth essentially giving you free SCORE points.
---
Thank you to everyone who posted! I appreciate knowing that I am not the only one this has happened to.
---
For now I will get by with a legendary bladed ski sword, my Brotherhood recon rifle, and anything else the purveyor decides she’s going to give me.
---
I sure will miss my Unstoppable Monster, but the whole premise of this post-apocalyptic game is to get by with whatever you can scrounge up isn’t it? So... no more whining. There’s no whining allowed in Fallout.
---
Thanks again!
---
Well it is, but you're also one shotting them, so it's a yes and a no. The challenge is surviving like 3 hits at best depending on how quick you are.
---
I have a furious ffr lmg but actually haven't tested it to see how it'd perform. The character I have it on is a junkie so I just stick with a shotgun and combat rifle that are both junkie weapons.
---
Well weren’t those nukes in exploded? So technically there are no nuclear impact zones, but instead just unexplored nukes.
---
It appears to be a random encounter spot, will my base get attacked often?
---
If you're gunna get T-65 then bullion obviously.
---
Use your friends list. Just join one of them. That way you don't get sent to the same server 5 times.
---
What weapon are you using?
---
1st:tiktoks shit
---
2nd: never had a tiktoks account
---
3rd: it's reddit stuff gets copied boo hoo
---
Head far far to the east, almost to the fence
---
This isn’t a series about thriving after nuclear apocalypse. 
---
*Fallout is a giant cleaning simulator*
---
Maybe? I dont remember if the lmg has the firerate needed, I think it's in the 170s which may not be enough. I remember turtle said around 200. I did mean explosive combined with ffr.
---
Got a fully decked out T51b (except Calibrated Shocks) so don't see the point of the T65.
---
One of two possibilities - either some players used one of so called "magic" weapons (fast firerate guns with broken affixes that do insane amount of damage - it's an bug/exploit) or if SBQ landed quickly and there were "food build" unarmed player. Both above may results in sub-minute kills.
---
So you're saying maybe I had bad luck? I hope so, I'm on a disc version on ps4, I notice you're on xbone so maybe it runs better
---
shhhh........don't bring attention to anything that helps get those legendary modules.
---
Love the mire. Not enough foot traffic though.
---
Interesting, been obsessed lately with trying to figure this one out myself. I’ll pay attention to new things on the map as you mentioned. 
---
My own untested theory, are you running unyielding? Problem seems worse for me when unyielding/bloodied, making me think the [Hidden] is not properly registering as enemies are nearby. A bit like Vats always missing, a problem that for me seems amplified with high unyielding level stats.
---
I hit level 420 last night!
---
What do you play on?
---
Could be. On Xbox external HD
---
Damn Ward! Since update 20 that mofo refuses to give me my daily quest 90% of the time. I have to fasttravel to fundation again and again until the dialog popps up.
---
Yeah, I don't think it's high enough. Not explosive so I'm sure it wouldn't cut it. Still a pretty good roll though, so I'll probably dust it off eventually just to play around with it.
---
XBox
---
I switch target manually way faster than gun fu,that's why i don't like that perk.
---
As a seasoned vet, there are those toxic players that can still be found and were quite prevalent in the early days, but now there are more people willing to help and it keeps this game going :)
---
Since they're both potentially "magical", I'd try them both out and see which does better for you build. I've had really good results with both Limb Damage and +33 VHC as a major against the Queen. Personally haven't tried the FFR variant on her yet...
---
Would start by priming them, and then determine if you need the health draw from Vampire's while standing in the face of the queen. I tend to favor the 90% reduced weight over faster reload, but use what you got to the best of it's ability!
---
The Hacking perk-card is great in a coordinated team of people (usually via Discord) as you're able to point out groups of enemies (I used to print-screen my map and throw it in a specific NW channel to give them info on where people were). The Terminal-search perk-card also helps with this. Furthermore, if a enemy player finds a nuclear briefcase you're able to quickly locate their position and possibly chase them down or sneak to them and wait for them to use the nuke. Lastly, you're able to also request weapons which can give you a minigun / TESLA RIFLE / autogrenade launcher / missile launcher or a SUPER AMAZING useless gauntlet.
---
Also get 9 agility and grab Frog Legs. You're gonna need it.
---
I filled a tree in my camp with about 16 of them, took out my other light sources, and waited for night.  It was in a rocky crevasse away from everything.  Barely any light from them, definitely not shining.  I actually tried to click on them thinking maybe I had to turn them on.  I broken them down and put my camp back the way it was.  Just another item I won't use I guess.
---
Heavy guns you'd just be dragging a Radio Flyer around behind you all the time or something.
---
Concentrated Fire is........
---
AWESOME!!!!!
---
Try it out, get a decent BD shotgun and just run into the enemies.   
---
I did need a bit of an exercise to not die, when just running into a bunch of LV68 super mutants. The ones with the mini gun always got me in the first days. But after some practise it can be fun.
---
I just want to get definite answer from Bethesda, before starting using it and get banned (or not :) )
---
It is bullshit for a shotgun build
---
Idk if you're new and play how you want of course, but fair warning, doing a hybrid build is going to make your character weaker overall in both aspects vs another character specialized in just one or the other of those things.
---
My unsolicited advice if you want to be able to explore multiple weapon types on a single character and still survive PvE. Look up how to structure a bloodied build no PA. The unyielding effect is so powerful, as long as a legendary weapon is bloodied I can use it and get by in PvE despite not having a single perk for it.
---
Honestly it sounds pretty good. Just jump in some PA for that armor pen and get to it. Dont forget to convert to ultracite for the ammo savings. Fuck making normal .308. 21 rounds a pop WITH ammosmith is fucking disgustingly bad.
---
Like I said I've already tried that and they just come up with excuses, just like you come up with responses and refuse to leave me alone. You got a complex or something? Do you think you have an answer for everything? 
---
1. You're a little twinkle toes bitch. 
---
2. I can number my responses too. 
---
3. You're annoying and a little on the slow side, I can tell you think you know everything. 
---
Stop using Reddit for validation you fucking loser, this is my problem not yours stop acting like you know what is what.
---
I'm pretty sure I have an AA explosive if your interested. It's a 2* but I'm a commando build so it's wasted on me
---
I'd love for them to fix it up if it's going to be kept as a light source!
---
It can't be the games intention do make a new char every time you get this challenge, just to get this challenge done.
---
Yeah, a bit.
---
That seems like a really lame reason to stop playing what with all the other possible choices.
---
#**16X DA DETAIL**
---
Okay Todd, asset flipping from previous games is not 16x.
---
I never noticed that. But I do always run bloodied and unyielding. 
---
But sometimes I go days without seeing the bug at all. And after I noticed the map changed when I stay in the map for long then fast travel it works less often. When I open it up and travel faster then it works more often. To me it seems like there are fewer opportunities for the map to change while I'm in it. 
---
If I'm there for long it seems there is more time for something to change and make the fast travel not work. Someone could test this by taking a screenshot of the map every time they try to travel and see what it looks like when it works and doesn't and see how it changes depending on the unyielding effect
---
I wasn't being hateful. Don't get triggered when someone points out obvious reposts. &lt;3
---
Not understanding builds and how important they are to this game (the previous Fallout games I’ve played are more forgiving and you can make any sort of character work). Spent my first 20 levels or so just picking random perks I thought sounded useful at the time rather than having it make sense
---
and assaultrons are a challenge, you have to run behind covers. in open fields it can be quite a challenge, to not run into their OP laser beam.
---
That would not be fun, innit ?!  
---
Just play to get better, and when you get strong enough go back and do the quests.
---
Remove a piece and put it back on is what I have always done on playstation. Otherwise just exit world.
---
The mutation starts working at 49% health.  When I play any build other than my bloodied, I rad down to 49% and enjoy going on killing sprees.
---
I definitely recommend creating a character strictly for NW as well. The Tenderizer, Ghoulish, and Frog Legs Perks are an absolute must, and each require about 9 in Charisma (Tenderizer), Endurance (Ghoulish), and Agility (Frog Legs). For the rest of the perk cards I strongly recommend trying to figure out what weapon you feel the most comfortable using. I usually play on a team of four with some of my friends, and two of us act as antagonizers to rush the enemy team and overwhelm them while the other two can line up shots with longer ranged weapons and act as a support role. It all really depends on what you enjoy doing. Another thing is don’t be a afraid to talk on the mic if you have one. Most other higher leveled player’s I’ve met have no problem giving advice to lower levels to help them get the into the swing of it. It’ll take some getting used to but if you give it time and work with your team you’ll really enjoy it.
---
Same happened to me few days ago. First and I hope last time :-)
---
placing sheepsquatch plushies everywhere I could till budget stopped my plushie farm.
---
The new Public Teams system has been great in allowing new players and experienced players to openly jump into teams together and either work together or stay separate and do their own thing. 
---
When I'm with a group of friends, we usually do Radiation Rumble whenever it pops up and lets us coordinate with the other random people showing up, always turning out to be a success and farm fest of the ghouls (usually completing the event when its almost finished by holding onto the ore rather than turning it in).
---
Oh and hand out Nuka Cola Vaccinated to people that show up my CAMP and sometimes Cranberry Relish.
---
People do min-maxing perks, drugs/food/bobbleheads, weapons and armor.
---
Just a legendary vampire fixer (i can't remember the other one's)
---
I think it might be account-dependant - I have two other dailies broken that way - Play Time and Thrill of the Grill. The day they are active I can make them over and over - just need to fast travel to other region and back to Mire or Toxic Valley to quest appear again on the map. I haven't tried yet with Hearth of the enemy though - must check today or tomorrow if it'll start again if I'll read the terminal.
---
you need more AP
---
I'd likely transfer it to an alt since my junkie sticks mostly with his shotgun. Main is strictly rifleman, the shotgun junkie has heavy perks but no PA ones since I haven't really liked PA after FO3 when they made it so clunky and cumbersome. Got an alt I'll do heavy PA with though, I'll use him as a BoS character when the faction update hits.
---
Anyway you shift them both into the same drive?
---
Here's my tip for you as a new player go here and plan out a build it will save you a headache later on: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Also remember you don't have to pick a Perk Card associated with the Special stat you increased when you Level up you can for example Increase your Strength but pick a Luck Perk Card.
---
If you ever make a "mistake" while leveling up and working on your build don't worry about it once you get past Lv.50 the game gives you a choice between gaining a new Perk Card or relocating a SPECIAL stat point each time you level up so you will always have the opportunity to "fix" your build.
---
Ever use a pipe bolt action?
---
You are the one who continues to post comments instead of walking away. And you seriously are going to question my knowledge when you cant even figure out an achievement? LOL. Im sorry you are so mad but the Reddit Karma dont mean shit to me. Keep crying.
---
80
---
If you want something you have to work for it. After 200 hours you will appreciate the early stage grind. It gets too easy after level 50. So feel the pain because at some point there will be close to zero pain
---
Btw it is possible to get in and out at low level. Must think outside the box
---
Laughed at tarnation reference. With deep pockets,  you'd be the "hootin'est, tootin'est, shootin'est, bob-tail wildcat, in the west!"
---
I mostly wanted the coop for aesthetic purposes. Though I was disappointed when I found out it didn't give eggs as well as fertilizer. And the raider tree isnt something I would use tbh
---
[Here's a slightly outdated but still fairly accurate map of levelled areas. ](https://i.imgur.com/UM0hSLA.jpg)
---
The problem is, it still doesn't work correctly and you'll find enemies that seem to be massively overlevelled.
---
It also doesn't help that unlike literally every other MMO game out there, quests are NOT level gated, so like me you coukd be doing quests for Rose as a level 12 player and getting royally shafted.
---
THE GOOD NEWS is that an upcoming update is meant to fix this. Currently enemies are scaled to match the ~~highest levelled~~ first player in the area, which is madness. The new patch is meant to scale all enemies to YOUR level, regardless. So two players - a level 10 and a level 100 - will both see one single enemy, but it'll be appropriate to their own levels.
---
I left that bozo in the dust days ago.  My thrusters are set for light speed!
---
The mods for this are available now. [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret\_Service\_underarmor](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Secret_Service_underarmor)
---
Not being able to hand out Handmade Gifts after I made a good amount of them back during the Holiday Scorched event due to people duping the utter crap outta them and making it nearly impossible for people to trust me when I run up in Christmas Power Armor to try and hand them free goodies. I had plans to give them out when Wastelanders dropped but because of the duping-spree's going on it wasn't going to happen.
---
Nowadays people are suspicious of that kind of thing because there's the fear you can get banned for taking them. So, I just used them for myself and gave out the plans instead :\\
---
Full health meele/unarmed build with all relevant mutations. Non pa as well with all pieces adding +1 strength. With glowing meat steak, mutant hound chops and yago hai ribs and phychobuff I do 600 dmg to the head of sbq per hit while sneaked. Without any chem and food buffs save for glowing steak I one hit everything with aa ss miner gauntlet. I also carry i 33 double barrel which one shots everything without any perks except for colonel gutsy which needs two hits. Obviously I have max strength in special, high luck and agility. This build is very versatile as I can also go nuke zones in Chinese armour and I can also go back to using full hp pa heavy guns build without moving special points, just need to learn two more mutations to feel safe going from one build to another.
---
Nothing like wasteland love
---
Submit a ticket
---
If you see enemies that are too difficult, turn around and level up. 
---
That’s the best advice I can give. In general stay on the western side of the map until level 30-35 or so and you should be fine. Though sometimes it is fun to punch above your weight class.
---
I can figure out an achievement it simply didn't unlock because it glitched out, this is my post and you're the one not walking away. Grow up dude.
---
I'm level 60(and a half) now, so just a head of him.should be able to stay at least one step a head the rest of the run
---
Yeah this is pretty true. I didnt even really know what builds were and was a food build ( learned this a while after lol ) until level 70. Then i met a really nice couple ( guy and his gf ) and they both taught me everything around builds, legendary effects, armor, ect ect. I still play with them every day.
---
For the larger guns they could bring back the ammo backpack with the ammo line for mini gun / Gatling gun and something similiar for the others (although you wouldn’t see it if you had a backpack on but the ammo lines would connect to the backpack instead)
---
I passed the sucker a couple days ago
---
The reason for this is ammo efficiency, each day I sell 2-3k caps ammo
---
I'm not even on a ps4pro, maybe I need to wait for my new pc to give fo76 its fair go, I won't dwell on it as fo76 has had its fair share of criticism already but if it runs like that on a vanilla ps4 from disc then wtf Bethesda :(
---
I saw just a video regarding play time quest, yeah, it's bugged and according to that video you have to do something additionally.  
---
With this "Heart of the enemy" - you basically investigate all the world and reading all the stuff on notes and terminals(!!!) and ooops, new quest just appeared.  
---
In general you may start this quest again and again and again until all scorchbeasts disappeared and you can't get their dna to finish the quest.  
---
As for me - it looks legal and I'd like to farm scrips this way (however it's time &amp; caps consuming - literally you have to make 3 fast travels per 1 time).
---
They respawn constantly.
---
As for me,  there were no problems with excavator  PA (I  was  20-25 level), but very  soon ( about lvl 30)  I  had a lot of troubles with lvl62 ghouls
---
I recommend trying a pipe-revolver pistol. You're gonna think I'm nuts recommending a junk-weapon, but if you add a rifle stock to it not only does it use pistol perk cards but you'll be able to use Rifleman ones as well!
---
Ooof man. That really has to hurt :(
---
Stay where it's green, kill everything loot everything.  Scrap what you don't need for junk and mods.   Even if you are not a co op player you should get the inspirational perk level 3 asap and join public teams whenever you are playing.  You don't actually have to do anything with them but you will get the extra xp from the perk as well as any other perks the team is sharing.
---
My fav spot in mire is right on the lake by the power plant. I’ve seen a player somehow build a boat out in the middle once. Way back in the day. Probably glitches it somehow but definitely top 5 camps I’ve seen
---
I'm not geared into bloodied by any means except for the gun. So I'm usually around 30%
---
Still can wipe through enemies. This will be a nice improvement
---
I'm excited for the faction update on them. I will likely immediately join them and attempt to max their stuff out. 
---
And did you like PA in NV? If I remember right it was pretty much just worn armor. I never used it so I'm unsure of what it was like.
---
some kiddo got his hands at his big bros account? just kidding. age is no measure for being a dumbass...
---
Im a cheap fuck so i actually use it. Its tedious but no
---
 way that im dropping my unwanted ammo.
---
So do both. Someone on here will do them for free, guarantee :)
---
It better be a Willow, Mad Mardigan reference
---
Once you max out a stat you can get the park card for it, you have to pick a different stat then move to the other section with rb/lb and l1/r1. I don't know what the controls are on PC though.
---
Magic power fixers is very common
---
Nice players will wait until SBQ mutates and then destroy it for everyone.  These people also launch three in one lobby. They are the real heroes of the wasteland imo
---
Sums up the game nicely.
---
200 iq
---
For this HotE quest you don't have to kill the SB - it can be extracted from dead SB someone else killed long some time ago. Near the prime fissure there is always some SBs, dead or alive - if not just change fissure site or server.
---
kill stuff, get better weapons/armors, gather junk, die, get junk back, build CAMP, store junk in CAMP.  
---
rinse repeat.
---
It was a bit disheartening but I made the difference up by crafting some basic stuff for newbies to take. They also got to experience a Deathclaw extremely early on (unless you B-line it for Deathclaw Island) since I had one tamed. It was great seeing lvl 2 players wander over to the Overseers Camp, look down the road to Flatwoods and see a big-ass Lizard watching them. Some would avoid my CAMP at all costs because of it, even if they saw me just sitting in a chair watching them, heheh. Of course, it couldn't hurt them.
---
This is why building teams pay off better then event teams. When no one is doing the event correctly at least your still earning extra xp for kills.
---
To add to this. They haven’t gone back to old assets to fix yet. So definitely a combo of both of your options
---
the beauty of the forest... lighting is wonderful in this game!
---
Yeah, that's the one I'm leaning towards. I may take both with me next time &amp; see which one does more damage overall.
---
I'd really love a Zealots Limb Damage Faster Reload.....which is what I use on my main (level 533).
---
I did that at tea time a week ago. if me it was no problem.
---
Clearing weight and wanted it to be useful to someone. Low level events serve that purpose.
---
damn synths
---
I mean you can one shot them all in the face pretty easily with most weapons, do you really need extra damage against them?
---
I don't really get blurry textures or stuff like that.  I have an Xbox one X with 76 on an external SSD.  If you put the game on an external SSD then you will be able to render the textures more quickly and have much shorter load screens.  I imagine you being on a regular PS4 as opposed to the pro also does nto help.
---
The FPS.. that is another issue.   Frames on console for this game is just bad.  Until the next generation of consoles come out I have the strongest hardware available to a console player and I still get frame drop in many places.  This game is just poorly optimized for consoles.  Go watch the top twitch streamers on PC and see how good their frame rate is and just drool and feel bad over what we have on console.  
---
Maybe the next generation of consoles will provide better performance but I doubt it.  It will still probably be capped at 30 fps unfortunately.  But the question is will the new machines at least be powerful enough to not drop frames?
---
Same here friends!!
---
Man you find some cool stuff
---
Add the game launcher fallout76.exe to your start screen and launch from that. Quit using Bethesda launcher. You may have to sign in every time you launch but this is a solution if you don’t want to make sure Bethesda and game is on same hard drive
---
Heavy weapons, i like the gattling gun it is anmo efficiënt
---
Ye the broadsider is a giant joke of a weapon right now compared to something like a Harpoon gun. At the moment the ballistics of the cannonball ammo sometimes just.. Explode before doing their actual damage, so avoid them at all costs.
---
And yeah, keep looking for either a The Fixer or a Handmade with good legendary affixes. Just be aware this isn't a Trading Subreddit and Mods will prob' bop you if you try to make one about it.
---
&gt;soft cap
---
I haven't heard of this.  What is the soft cap?
---
Nice. Yeah, I love the Bear Arm. For me, it’s one of the coolest weapons in the fallout universe. I found the Bear Arm Plan at a player vendor for 10k caps. I bet if you offer 10k caps on the market reddit, someone would sell it to you. It’s worth it just for the chance to land legendaries through the purveyor. Also, you can easily craft and sell them through your own vendor for 250-500 caps a piece to make back some of the caps.
---
You mean "garbage" no no i haven't :)
---
Well there is a penalty to continuously jumping in nuclear winter when you have frog legs on that is. You will jump less high every consecutive jump unless you wait for a cool down.

First night I ever experienced this my friends and I had been drinking. They thought I was seeing shit because none of them had the effect active yet. Was pretty funny when one of them finally got it
---
Weird shit. If it continues just remove her station (store and/or scrap) then try and replace. If it continues after that, then maybe its the ammo machine itself that's the problem.
---
In other words, your prices offend her ;)
---
I honestly still don’t know a lot of the terms regarding builds, but I’ve managed to at least somewhat correct my character. I’m level 42 now and don’t feel like I’m struggling quite so much
---
Hunting one it has better damage and you can upgrade it to shoot higher cal bullets
---
I'm not a big fan of LMGs - they're not ammo efficient and small mags, even with 15% reload affix, is kind of irritating. I have two: B50L90 and B2515r and after burning 20k of ultracite ammo I switched to other heavies - B50L50DR Minigun as "broken" annihilator and BE90 Flamer/B2515r .50 Cal for all other enemies (first has huge range and kills most enemies fast, while the second is very ammo efficient and good for close quarters fights).
---
Calibrated shocks is a better investment. Will pay dividends over and over. Or like another commenter mentioned, find a player/friend to build them for you.  Put on your mic, find a level 200+ and go ask them. Or post to the sub again and someone will help. Maybe a commenter will eventually come on to offer that’s on your console
---
Just have fun, don’t be afraid to die or start over...it’s just a game, like a movie YOU star in....
---
My guns take like 2 ap per shot and i refill them in less than a reload.
---
I very much appreciate the thought and gave you an upvote just for the sincerity and hopefulness of your post, but my faith in Bethesda is not high enough to see them overhaul an existing game with Vulcan. If they were to say that they were going to start using Vulcan going forward though I would definitely be excited
---
My dude, rule #8
---
Edit: To clarify there's another Daily-like activity that you can exploit in a similar fashion. Hopefully they'll all be patched. And yes, they're exploits. Please don't use them in this kind of manner, as tempting as they are.
---
I just started playing 3 days ago and twice now I've had random players drop loot for me to help me out. Thing is, I find myself feeling compelled to follow them for a bit incase they are wanting a hand with something despite my lowly level.
---
How are you handling with hunger and thirst?
---
You also get them from the Blue ridge caravan escort event in Big Bend Tunnel.
---
Level 61 and he’s about 3 spaces in my rear view mirror. Double XP and double score weekends definitely helped me. Haven’t done NW challenges at all this entire time, my daily playing time has been limited so can’t chase the recurring 100 SCORE, and honestly, I’ve not been particularly clever with XP boosters. Almost in Chapter 3.
---
I do punch all the time, got a friend helping me, it just seems so off that even the beginner quest new arrivals sends you to Africa to give you lvl 20 rewards :).
---
&gt;Bloodied Builds really don't have an excuse for one shotting things in an event.
---
Yea.. I have issues with reading comprehension. Your entire post is about bloodied. And only bloodied.
---
I only use it to get .308 for my sniper. Which isn’t often. I just find I have dry spells where enemies don’t drop hunting rifle ammo. I use the machine and dump a bunch of .44 and missiles into it and I get a couple hours worth of ammo.
---
That would be awesome, thx
---
Cherry popped. Congrats
---
Swap in Travel Agent or Hard Bargain when you need them. That frees up 4 points for something else.
---
Blocker is better than bullet shield for damage reduction. Most enemies are melee.
---
You know you can find weding ring in game right
---
Wow Thanks. According the the perks database there appears to be around 200 different ones

No promotion or enabling of pirated content and game exploits. This includes but is not limited to: torrents, free full-game downloads, .exe files, pirated mods, pirated keys, third party market resellers, game crashing cheats, duplication exploits, etc.

Oh yeah then you are on the right path! What build are you?

I normally can still get by using a communist collectron food gathering mode for food/water with herbivore and get pletny of purified water on my travels, its just annoying to constantly have to stop everysooften to treat the aid and thrist but the benifits of speed demon are worth.

I assume you mean resource generators. There are, but those spots are popular and you will have trouble finding a server. Google the FO76 resource map. It will.show you a list of all resource nodes in the world. All you have to do is look for 2 close together.

With the dozens of individual play styles, I think it would be way faster and more efficient to just discard (no pun intended) something we don't want with a single click than having to ask our team members to switch cards someone else might maybe even want to keep.

Pro tip: find multiples of 2 each Mutfruit, Corn, and Tato; plant them at your CAMP; have a water purifier: you can cook up vegetable starch, which makes 2 adhesive per batch.

I'll be 83 tonight, ahead of target and well in front of Zorbo. I'm probably going to try and slow down a little this week since we're just coming into week 5 so there's plenty of time left on the clock for me to finish.
---
Ooof. as i read each one, a part of me died xD
---
But hey, at least you know now haha
---
You want to have accuracy, so two-shots are out, because the second bullet is never as accurate and causes the rifle to break twice as fast.
---
Also the explosive damage is only marginally useful when going for accuracy, it will also break the gun faster.
---
truly this is Zorbo's week of shame
---
I too run bloodied and unyielding and constantly have this issue. There are small periods where it doesn't happen but probably 70% of play time over the past few weeks this has been a problem....
---
Dude, I’d PVP so fucking fast just to kick your ass. Though, I’m a PC player. Real bummer.
---
combined with the new raider collectron you get ammo way faster than if you ever tried the same with the converter.
---
First time I went there I got a sheepsquatch but after building I almost never got attacked and it was was usually radtoads. Didn't even bother with turrets.  I did get a couple vengeful mothmen though. That sound will make you soil yourself when you're just chilling crafting at camp lol.
---
I'm doing a vats rifle build as well. Got a 2 star lever rifle and a 3 star hunting rifle I'm rolling with.

You can add me as well: Lamorak\_2000. I'm not much less a noob (still unter 100), but I'll help you out if I can.

Definitely one of the best communities I have ever seen in a game. Don't get me wrong there are a few assholes out there, but they are far and few between.

Agreed ... I almost wish there was a generic "campground" area so some of us could collectively set our camps up near new players and it still be beneficial to high lvls to do so (ie setup near vault 76 and you receive free materials or some type of buff) ... I wouldn't mind stepping out of the front door and killing a few low level mole rats to help my fellow citizens

I passed him back when he was at the camp tree reward. I'm now 73 and way ahead but he'll slowly catch up because it takes almost 2 days now to lvl up,without grinding xp like a mad man.
---
Yeah the perk system is odd but your comment helps me not be so stressed about picking. Thanks. 
---
I will check out the link.
---
I would never take a hunting rifle as my main shooter. They are very slow firing, even with speed demon. And even silenced they are loud enough to mess up stealth up close. And good luck trying to fight with a HR when shit hits the fan up close and youve got a two second reload time between shots *and* a paltry 6 round mag.
---
Due to their massive rate of fire advantage and larger mags, a vanilla combat rifle or handmade will both dance circles around a Leg hunting rifle in terms of raw damage output.
---
They wont have the same advantage over a double dipping pipe revolver rifle in terms of raw output, but your perk layout will be more comfortable without having to skimp in agi AND perception to fit both sets of damage perks along with the other mandatory stuff for stealth builds.
---
I do 1500-2000 a shot with an insta lever. Would be way higher if I want full health but I’m just leveling it to get the perk points to make a melee queen killer
---
Yeah, I saw a video on Youtube where to get unique items months ago including the rings, but the events kept me busy and I always forget the locations 😅 thanks for reminding me 😊
---
Thanks, this is really helpful too.
---
To clarify again, I don't think that this is an abuse/exploit, since basically you have to follow all the regular quest steps.  
---
I want to hear from someone from Bethesda whether it is safe to use it, just in case, ticket id:  16338142, ticket number: 200725-012327  
---
"**Repeatable: Stings and Things**" - is a repeatable quest.  
---
Probably Heart of the Enemy is also repeatable, this is the question
---
Sadly that's not always an option. You'd be surprised about the amount of people who play with no mic. But even if, the other team members may even want to keep what someone else needs to get rid of, which often leaves no choice other than leaving a team altogether. Just being able to turn off the 'receiving end' of shared perks, or even toggle specific ones inactive altogether would fix it without having someone else change their own play style.
---
So just like Fo4 then, thanks.
---
Rank 71 - Zorbo should now be following the glow of my Firefly Lamp but I suspect he's lost in the darkness as its so dim its almost useless.
---
Seems like lever is the more well rounded for up close encounters. What are the specs of your lever and build?
---
Assassins SS armor buttresses + jetpack, for PvP conciderations. Quad explosive doublebarrel (8 shooter)to shoot em down, with the rocketgirl skin for now, since it was recently readded.
---
Thanks, don’t know why it’s stressing me so much. There’s been so much negativity surrounding the game and I’m so excited to play it that I think it’s causing this anxiety!
---
Just go down to the nuka cola factory when you get a kill ghouls challenge and then to the jous e next ot the fast travel point
---
:(
---
Has decent range with a long scope. I just have mine with a dot as it’s 5025 vats. Clears WS no problems at all. Depends what U want to do. Not much call for miles away sniping or the black power weapons would be meta for sniper along with gauss
---
Which platform are you on?
---
The lever, hands down. And with the latest bug, you can reload it within 1 second .)
---
Okidoki, got it 👌
---
Absolutely beautiful
---
Pc.
---
Nice build! I run a camp there too. One of these day I will have to post  a walk through. Its a technically challenging spot to build in and I found it helps to get ideas from other camps at that location. Thanks for sharing.
---
I run Bloodied Heavy Guns.
---
It was a bit of an adventure before I settled on it. I made my heavy gunner way way back in the early days, after I picked up a Gatling Gun on my first character I just fell in love. Up until the TSE nerf, I used a TSE gatling gun with Martial Artist because for a while martial artist increased the gatling guns fire rate.
---
After TSE got nerfed, I kind of floated around. Ran anti armor for a while, of all things. Eventually, with prodding from a friend, I moved in to Bloodied PA. Once I slapped on protocols, I never looked back.
---
If you've never played with Emergency Protocols, I'd encourage you to give it a spin. You just dont take damage, it feels like you can tab out and write a reddit post, take a shit and then make sandwich before an enemy has time to kill you. That's obviously a bit of hyperbole, but it does feel like that sometimes. PA's native Reduction +Protocols +LW or Empath +Dodgy +Blocker added together just make it so hard to die. I like to run Field Surgeon too, just because it lets me be lazier when i play. You have to be a little careful around Poison damage, but poison just wrecks bloodied in general if you're not running some Poison Res armor.
---
The guns are good fun too. Yeah stealth commando and melee are more damage, but the LMG is not far behind a fixer. Not having to reload most of the time is also really nice.
---
Gun builds are broken in this game and magic weapons exist
---
Thank you and keep safe out there 🤗
---
\[joshua lake\] my first is a PA heavy gunner. cause it seems to be the most easy approach for the first char and i just like the big guns. hes now lv244... tried most weapons in game, and ended using .50 and minigun as main weapons. most versatile char because of most perks and a variety of weapons: .44 for certain events. assault rifle for sneaking around without PA. .50, minigun, harpoongun, auto grenade, fatboy for... well... everything else. due to using perk loadout manager from nexus the flexibility is huge.
---
\[han smith\] my second (lv121) is a vats non-auto rifle commando (or so). lever action, handmade, combat rifle and a LMG for really messy situations or just supporting the frontline. experience with the first char helped making the needed decisions. playstyle is totally different, makes more fun surprisingly. his fighting style is more efficient and effective as with the heavy gunner. needs fewer ammo for the same results. the heavy is more tanky due to PA. the rifler rely much on sneak and being mobile as hell... uses only a t45 for rare nuke zone expeditions. and an excavator for farming lead. guns tweaked for VATS and armor piercing and higher rate of fire. better crits, more crits, and such. mostly headshots ...
---
\[alan cole\] third char (lv7) could end as pistolero... just wanna try it, and have some pistol beauties on the walls of the first two chars... time will tell.
---
interessting part: all chars are nearly the same until lv 20 to lv30. starting with pipe guns, hunting rifle etc, and then specialising in certain perks.
---
From my understanding it forces the mole miners to spawn in one location.
---
Because that is way too obvious of a way to completely fix this whole issue for both player bases...  Their designers have their heads so far up their asses.
---
1. Yes you can get all the perk cards after lvl 50 but you'd have to be like lvl 1000+ or something insane.
---
2. You CAN level up Rifleman. Take a closer look at the controls at the bottom of the screen when picking a new perk card. You can cycle over to different SPECIAL stats and pick / choose what you want.
---
3. Answered in 2. You can still pick the perk cards under a maxed-out SPECIAL stat.
---
4. I honestly suggest you try a good Legendary Handmade or 'The Fixer' combat rifle. They're incredible automatic rifles and at the moment I'm running a bloodied automatic stealth build that rips things apart. Its a great medium-range settup with little need for extended ranged fighting. Also no need for melee at all but because of that you use more ammo.
---
Yes, this would also mean you'd need the commando perk cards at some point. But you have time for that, same with finding an adequate Fixer / Handmade (AntiArmor / Bloodied / Junkies / Furious primary affixes if possible with Reduced Vats Cost / Vats hit chance / Better crits and/or 90% reduced weight).
---
Also congrats for hitting 50 soon.
---
Why the flamingos? Do u need help op?
---
I’m mostly focusing on guns since that’s how I’m used to playing Fallout, so I’ve maxed out things like Rifleman, etc. It’s still a work in progress before I can really call it anything, but it’s definitely a step up from “girl who can carry a lot of stuff and has a super slow metabolism”
---
Bloodied Stealth Commando, I love to make high damage numbers while being pretty fragile myself. I think it's similar to an actual solo soldiers situation
---
That’s why you only ask”do you want to come it” at the door.  Technically not an invitation, but normal humans will take it as an invite and enter-vampires have a very strict ethics code in this area it seems.
---
Hopping from one public team to another - depending on what I wish/need to do right now. I love this feature!
---
Other than that... Ever since I earned the space wallpapers - putting them up in my camp leaning back and enjoying the neon glow. I'm taking a break of challenges and binge 76ing right now, since the grind of the last weeks is starting to decrease my enthusiasm for playing.
---
I found I could fix this on PS4 by equipping a hazmat suit (or hopping in and out of PA). It force removes all your gear until you take it off (or in the case of PA get out).
---
I was kinda surprised it was listed as a light source, considering fireflies in a jar would be a terrible light source.
---
It is good to be the king. Wood please.
---
Are you not running protocols on you Bloodied heavy? 
---
I main bloodied PA, and the only thing that really kills me is poison, and only if i'm not paying attention.
---
You can check this nice tool to compare damage in exact situations/weapons:
---
[https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Same here. 62
---
I would personally say its in some degree an exploit for attempting to collect a certain item repeatedly even though the objective itself can only be completed once a day. So, I suggest figuring out first if its an actual Daily or not. If it is, then you're only supposed to complete it once a day.
---
I used this Saturday for the first time, and seriously spend just two hours for something that should be simple to use.
---
Speak for yourself, I wish I didn’t have to jump in that shitty adventure mode and be able to stay in NW killing all you little entitled Karen’s.
---
Very helpful thanks
---
&gt;So, I suggest figuring out first if its an actual Daily or not.
---
This is exactly why I have created this post.  
---
As I mentioned, support said to restart my PC and verify game files :))
---
You need to buy the plans with gold bullion before you can craft them with the legendary moduels. If you haven't make sure to finish the wastelanders questline and the option to gain and spent gold bullion will become available.
---
Damn dude, you come up with that on your own?
---
Yeah I've got the under armour plans and crafted a normal version of it, but I don't know how to craft legendary versions of it.
---
If you can afford to use all double dipping perks then pipe will be better. But you will lose alot of beneficial perks.
---
I made a  [calculations](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html?left=R_W-PipeBoltactionRifle_L-50_ModReceiver-Standard_Prefix-Twoshot_Major-Explosive_Sneak_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-120_TankAP-36_Other-0&amp;right=R_W-HuntingRifle_L-50_ModReceiver-.50_ModMagazine-Standard_ModMuzzle-Standard_ModSights-Standard_Prefix-Twoshot_Major-Explosive_Sneak_PHP-100_EHP-99_Hits-0_Addicts-0_BloodyMess-15_Kills-6_Boost-60_TankAP-36_Other-0)  comparing the two based on the information you provided. You didn't mention the prefix of the pipe so i assumed it is two shot also.
---
Now, i have to say.. Two shot effect is one of the worse prefixes in game right now, if you ignore enemy specific ones like 30% more damage to mutants etc etc. Two shot is only 25% increased damage with massive accuracy and recoil penalty. Even Anti Armor is better. I strongly suggest you try to find something better instead. Also, if you like rifleman types of sniping rifles then i suggest you look up Lever Action Rifle. It has better damage/dps than hunting rifle, while having higher rate of fire. To me personally, the double dipping perks for pipes is not really worth the 9 perk points you are going to "lose". Even if it will be slightly better in damage.
---
I have 1200 shotgun shells I need to process in 12 shell groups. Insane.
---
Underarmour can't be legendary, only the chest, arms and legs can be.
---
Oh right I see, thanks for that.
---
What prefixes should I look for in a lever action?
---
What reason are you server hopping?
---
Me
---
The day magic shotguns are fixed is the day I rethink my shotgunner build.
---
FWIW, in the latter years of canvas n cannon combat, cannon balls were hollow spheres with small blackpowder bursting charges. The fuse would be loaded facing out the barrel and when lit, the propelling charge would sweep around the front of the ball, igniting the primitive fuse. The explosive was anemic at best, but it was still an explosive. So lorewise, the broadsider is at least accurate in sucking as a primitive explosive projectile weapon.
---
No problem, hope you get some good ss gear in the future.
---
\^
---
This. If you see some of the people you joined being super irradiated, make sure to take off your sun kissed and rad sponge to keep it that way.
---
Quick question, is it better then the marine armour?
---
Yes, ss is the best gear if your not a power armour user.
---
Ayos! congrats to both of you.
---
Maybe they should keep it with no SPECIAL scaling? It’d be incredibly stupid to add special scaling.
---
Unless you're running light or low tier armor (like robot or trapper, even marine struggles a little bit) you're over investing in DR.
---
Especially with Scaly, a full of most Heavy armors is enough to hit the DR soft cap. Around 270-300 DR, you start hitting massive diminishing returns. As in, like, 1% less damage taken per 100 DR at that point.
---
I'd probably cut Ironclad and Evasive, then try and look for different armor personally.
---
Salamat! 😁
---
I'm 66 right now, but I miss 10+ days when being on holidays and it included double XP weekend, so I hope I'll be able to finish it before the season ends (it's 8th of August?)
---
Check the quarantined files list in your anti-virus software, I've had a few occasions where it's done a false positive on the .exe file and that lead to the launcher trying to reinstall it completely. Releasing it fixed the problem.
---
I wish I could do this. I'm in the same boat as you, only further.
---
I'm nearly level 200 and still haven't launched one. Been in the silo killing bots with a public team when someone else was launching one, but haven't done it myself yet.
---
A Bloodied,two handed melee, mutant. I use a ss, bloodied, +1 super sledge for DPS. I let my rads build up as needed (mostly SBQ and wendigo collosus). Its nice getting stronger as you get closer to death.  My alt weapon is also a   ss super sledge that does double damage on fill health enemies. This one shots everything in the game if sneak is used. I have a ongoing challenge for myself to see how high I can get a single hit to be. Right now I got a screen shot of 13,456 damage on one hit. All perks and buff applied. Idk if thats high in the community, but its high for me. What is everyone elses one hit wonder numbers?
---
Personally I love this play style as I've always played FO games this way. I hate ammo. Insane I even have a shrine to melee in my camp including a bobble head display with 100% melee bobble heads, a collection of two handed  bloodied melee weapons mounted on the wall, and lastly, a magazine rack of nothing but grognak. Open to suggestions on how to make this a better shrine to the glory of melee.
---
After going back to the game (year break) trying to figure out how to get out of power armor selected drop instead .. then logged to server jump. End result had to build new excavator suit. Xbox long press 'X'
---
Yup, ran a full health junkies build all the way up to lvl 200. Never encountered the bug.
---
Switched to bloodied for the season. Encountered the fast travel bug immediately.
---
Has something to do with unyielding, one of the perks used for bloodied, high rads or maybe a mutation that I got since switching to bloodied.
---
I think the only mutations I have added since being junkies is adrenal glands and the health regen one.
---
My money is on that health regen one doing something funky. Just as you can’t fast travel when taking health damage, perhaps the converse is true with this mutation. I notice it works differently to how a stimpak heals you.
---
Awsome I use the combat armor helmet with gilli paint and forest scout maks and I love the look but so mad to light doesn't function, and I herd it was the same for ss helmet so I never spent the gold but now I might have to.  Plus the scout masks are pretty rare and a nice trade piece.
---
He's dust in my rear mirror right now. I'm at 76 or something.
---
Heck I run ghoulish just for this reason only difference is I run a furious gatling laser build. Even then I have to use radawsy every 45 seconds to survive.
---
Thank you for the answer =)  
---
I am trying a build with gauss shotgun and mutations and speed demon was the only one that i had doubts about.
---
The exceptions are if you fight back, or if you pick a lock on someone else's camp or workshop. I made each mistake once. I've died in an event and had other players point me back to my loot. 
---
Your camp can still be damaged by NPCs, but good defenses, semi-regular visits back, and good camp placement all help.
---
I wish I could find a T-51 set... not that I’d use it for anything other than aesthetics
---
Personally, I stay away from explosives on stealth builds. I run an instigating lever, does 1500+ on headshots with concentrated fire for headshot grits, tank killer (or glow right, or exterminator, depending on enemy type) and rifleman perks. Furious handmade for high health enemies with concentrated fire, tank killer, commando and for an extra little bump, tormentor if I feel I need it. Lever is my walk-about gun, handmade for baddies. Can't wait for perk load outs to switch between the two easily. I also often use an instigating bow with poisoned arrows (actually has higher damage than lever gun) when I'm in a hunting mood. Good th8ng about the build is I only have to switch out 3-4 perk cards real quick to change build, as all of them are perception perks, save tormentor. I usually run bloody mess also. Gotta love global damage buffs, even if it's only 5%. 5% of 1500 is an extra 75 damage.
---
In my opinion Instigating for full health builds and junkies/bloodied for junkies/bloodied respectively.
---
I’d kill for a new anti cheat or to be able to see how much exp I need for a rank up.
---
Recently tried to FT to Foundation, ended up at that quest bunker north of Valley Galleria... sometimes I do wonder how such things happen
---
I think  they addressed well the XP problem there was at the beginning of the season, this event was top for lazy and casual players, so really appreciated by me
---
You just learn to live with the downside and it becomes normal haha. If you want to make your life abit easier you could always become a carnivore and just eat meat off things you kill, easily takes care of your hunger bar meaning you don't need to carry any food.
---
You really have to ask yourself though. Like someone designed those menus and really thought it would work?
---
No damn way, it was definitely done on purpose with some sort of ulterior motive. On some Vault Tec shit.
---
Also found out the other day you can’t use SS ghillie armour + heavy weapon in FP without your screen being blocked. 
---
Absolutely no testing is ever done with this game
---
Well, Anti Armor is better option than two shot, while being mid tier weapon. Instigating is good for questing/dailies etc as it doubles the damage on full health enemies, but it is not that great on bosses that take longer time to kill. The top two right now is Bloodied (best) and Junkies.
---
Love everything you just said, but the crossbar should stay red when hovering over an enemy. Only way to really know if there’s a stealth boy near you or there’s a bush wookie or team by you. Absolutely amazing tool.
---
We only get one stupid daily that is trivial to get.... it’s super unfair to have to spend time in adventure mode at all to earn score.  Us NW players should have our own path.  
---
Just give both player bases the same amount of dailies and weeklys in both modes and be done with it, it’s not rocket science or even first grade math Bethesda..
---
I had to move my camp on one of my chars because it happened to be directly under a spawn point for the nuke key/vertibot pack. After engaging one of the vertibirds, my turrets would get involved, kill everything (except the little asshole cargobot), then start attacking my crafting benches.
---
The only way to stop the attacks was to remove *one* of the turrets. Then the others apparently learning by example, would stop shooting my stuff.
---
71 - did not spent atoms on a level yet...
---
LMAO yeah it definitely is! Would you like some suggestions to where you want to spend points in? Ill take a look at your build and give you some tips if you want some.
---
Depends if you mean nicknames for characters, those are stored by the server but if you mean custom names for gear that's stored client-side and Idk why they put a limit on those.
---
Just for the chest
---
Thanks for that much appreciated :)
---
Aw, try to introduce Fallout76 to your partner. That's what my fiance did, and now I love this game. I wish you all the best 💕
---
Hm seems like lever would be better with what i am looking for, just looking to find a decent one with prefixes now.
---
Not me, im too lazy to bother trying to catch him. Im at L50 iirc, but ive made no effort to actually grind anything. Those are just the ranks i got by playing how i normally play.
---
Wholesome!
---
Probably just wants the legendarys to spawn and loot
---
Nice
---
I've had quite a few items disappear through the ground when I dropped it.  The worst being a pumpkin long suit I was giving to my friend during the Halloween event.
---
I bought the game about 2weeks after launch ( first time I saw a used copy at gs) and was super into it for a long time but then got boring so I put it down for at least 6 months. Then I came back and started a new character transferred all my old gear and deleted the characters. So not only did I lose 2 mules that were already 50 and could gave go extra rolls with, but I had 2 or 3 explosive engery weapons that I had no idea were legacy and sold them very cheap.
---
Being a high rank doesn’t mean you’re good at the game though. It could mean you’ve spent 150 hours sitting in a bush waiting for top 10. This is the only BR I've ever played that didn't reward based on a skill that has anything to do with playing a BR (e.g. killing people). Many low level players could be alt accounts just showing up for the score challenge to rank up. Doesn't mean they can't play the game. But you go on thinking rank has anything to do with skill.
---
Me first installing it at my camp: “This will be helpful!“
---
Me after using it: “This is the exact opposite of helpful!”
---
Finished on my first account, level 27 on my second.
---
Let them be idiots they’ll learn from their stupidity, us seasoned players think it’s ‘cute’ when that happens and just let them die if they get downed or wave good bye when they get killed on the other side of the map.
---
Yo dude I'm on PS4 as well. I love the country and stuff and like I play sometimes
---
My experience with games with PvP has always been awful. If the game only has a certain area have PvP, it’s compounded; it’s always going to be filled with super high level players that get off oneshotting super low levels and will even lure them in there. I quickly learned to avoid those areas in the games that have them, even the ones that offer “higher XP” inside those areas.
---
I do have no mic either.But when i do play with a team, i do only share cards, which don't have any possible negative impact on other's build.
---
I like to share things like repair-shot,green thumb or chemist.These cards are what i would call neutral.  
---
E: And also a problem with mic is:   
---
not everyone speaks english. I do speak english, german and a bit of russian.   
---
And some of my friends can't do a single word in english, which is a speech barrier.
---
Hunting rifle has range of 132, while level action has 123. It's not too big of a difference. Especially if you are using concentrated fire perk.
---
Can we get a TLDR?
---
Thanks, my fiance gave it to me as I wouldn't know how to look or craft for things before myself 😂 Now I was able to save enough gold bullion for the T65 😊
---
The vampire, by a wide margin.
---
OUCH. Hit right in the feels
---
What? How so? It’s a weapon you’re carrying, you move much faster when your arms are free. Especially with heavy guns.
---
One of that " well....shit..." moments right there
---
Thank you and keep safe 😊
---
I have three legendary combat shotguns, i can go through 1000 shotgun rounds on a stroll through the whitespring or one or two high level events.
---
Ya, thank god it was just a cosmetic and not an amazing armor piece or weapon.
---
Put 4 points to END and get lifegiver? Edit: Or just get more AGI so I can use the Adrenaline perk when it's fixed
---
As long as the low level helps we help back and appreciate it.  I know my team mates definitely recognize it when we see it and call it out in our Xbox party chat.  Hell if they seem like they are really trying we invite them to our team to play for a long session.
---
Full health build:

I threw in explosive damage buff but I'm pretty sure the explosive damage buff on guns does not do damage to the queen, good for mopping up other mobs though.
---
Edit:
---
Just a quick build I threw together for you.
---
I'm 4 ahead now, grinding like crazy all weekend
---
There was a mod on Fallout 4 that attempted this and the results were... eh. The morder stated that it would most likely cause the gun to float on your back and even clip through your character. Said you might have to mess with the mod’s settings to try and find the best looking option.
---
It's a mod on PC
---
That's a mod for the PC, it's on the nexus.
---
You kissed more than 10 days of dailies and didn't play during double XP and you're at level 66?
---
Yea...you're doing fine...
---
My girlfriend and I met on fallout 76 during the quarantine and this game is just a miracle from coordination of atom shop outfits to white springs  runs. I love bethesda for making such a fun world to live our dreams out in I know you're the next couple to drop a SBQ
---
Which is really funny because their MO is very similar to the raiders. 
---
They don’t farm or go hunting, so they expect those they “protect” to bring them tribute so they can survive. Taggerdy’s group even resorted to stealing supplies from farmers and other survivors at gunpoint.
---
Maybe that’s the hostility: there’s really room for only one group of supplies-stealing assholes. They see the raiders a competition for resources.
---
Early on, craft throwing knives, they'll be your best friends for a good few levels
---
This bug went away for me when I removed the healing factor mutation.
---
I have an Instigating Lever, 171 dmg, all Riflemen Perks maxed including Tank Killer and Concentraded Fire, a couple of Chameleon armor pieces and pretty much one shot headshot 90% of all enemies in VATS as long as I get that surprise sneak attack in. I see damage numbers go up to 1350.
---
Lower your prices
---
She's not into gaming. Like at all sadly.
---
Yeah sorrry my numbers were wrong
---
Just one more thing. While Level Action Rifle has slightly lower damage per shot than double dipped Pipe Bolt-Action, it has better rate of fire which makes Level Action better in dps (damage per second).
---
https://youtu.be/QV8MxcPxpIY

Here's a video of our first queen duo, two queens and king I'm a lucky man as cheesy as it sounds
---
How good does my aim have to be?
---
So you will accidentally scrap all your duped legacies.
---
There are fissure sites all over the map. I'd imagine so much eruption would disturb the ground in many ways.
---
are you repairing to 200% with weapon artisan?
---
I run Gunsmith for 3pts and repair to 200% and all my weapons(including explosive) last a good while..(when gunsmith isnt broken)
---
Would anti armor prefix on lever be better for boss fights?
---
Aw, that's really lovely. Like the comment above said, nothing like wasteland love 💕
---
GunFu is slow af compared to vats snap shooting with high perception/agi.
---
\- So, support recommended me to reboot pc and verify game files instead of just say - "Yes, this is abuse and you may face issues using this" or "No, it's totally safe" 
---
they answered ur question. Reboot ur pc, verify game files and dont bring more attention to it. it would be nice to google before made a same topic for 99999th time.
---
You get 9 tokens each day for doing all three dailies, and you get the same number of tokens for doing the initial quest (Mistaken Identity) the first time (if memory serves). So on Day 1, you would get 18 tokens because the dailies appear after you complete Mistaken Identity.  So, you will *technically* collect all 450 tokens 48 days after\*. But given that these 'dailies' do not always reset, and that sometimes you may not be rewarded with tokens for completing a daily (which happened to me a lot early on- but they may have fixed that) it's likely that you will complete it *well after 48 days have passed* if you make a point of doing it daily.
---
\*49 if you only get 9 on Day 1
---
True, but the Capitol Wasteland BoS was much less odious than the F4/West Coast BoS, who turn out to be pretty much nazis.
---
leader of the pack yo.. shit procs constantly
---
Oh yeah I'm definitely going over the soft cap my initial estimates with the Vanguard Solar Armor Set that I'm rolling for right now after the Legendary perks and mutations put me at around 700 DR and 750 ER. I specifically grabbed those two perks you mentioned because I couldn't decide what other Perks to choose. 
---
A lot of these perks are straight up useless, too situational, don't fit my play style or are made redundant by Legendary Perks.
---
Slightly better than with a grenade, just hit them with it at early levels and it should take a decent chunk if not outright end them
---
I put the communal fire pit under a double canopy.
---
Scrap weapons to learn mods for that weapon. Once you’ve learned them sell them for caps. In the early parts of the game scrap and store scrap and store or you’ll struggle with weigh badly and when u die the only penalty is you drop your scrap. The easiest way to level is with a sneak sniper build. However after 50 you’re gonna probably want to change that around as it’s great for 1 shotting normal mobs but not for endgame content. And a little not so well shared tip. Once u start running around whitesprings you’ll find a little circular pavilion area that has a drinkjng fountain on the wall. If u drink from it it cures all diseases that you have.
---
Aw, I'm sure there are other ways to bridge the LDR gap. Hang in there, we will all get through this 🤗
---
I paid £80ish for this game for a pre order so I could play the beta.. my mistake was thinking they cared about their customers and wouldn't release a half finished game and make us wait so long to make it playable
---
Oh yeah it wouldve made it even worse.
---
Quite some time ago i traded for a BE flamer. I was over the moon with it! So 15  mins after completing the trade, i went to west tek to test this thing out. halfway trough, the server crashed. I thought oh well, just another server crash. When i loaded into a new world, i saw that the flamer wasnt equipped. Again, i thought this is just another bug or something. I checked my inventory and the flamer was gone.... checked my stash, empty. Thats how i lost my flamer 15 mins after getting it. Sad times huh
---
People literally camping in the spawn spots.
---
Do a wes tek run and harpers ferry.  Just going through those two spots gets me 3 legs EZPZ.
---
Don’t judge a person by their rank:
---
I create a new char and run a match when the daily is increase overseer rank.
---
This means I start at level 0, but I am in fact a level 66 normally (not that high, I know).
---
However, i joined a game the other day for it and one of our teammates left off the hop.
---
The other guy died early on because he spawned away from the 3rd guy and myself.
---
Anyways, us 2 ran through about 3-4 teams and took home the win. After a few interactions he was following me around because he knew I knew what I was doing.
---
Point is, level 0s are not *always* level 0s, you have to judge based on performance.
---
“He can’t be stopped”
---
Gulp
---
Biggest mistake i made in 76 was trying to roll a non stealth character. Pure frustration. Got him to L30 before almost rage deleting him. I want that time back. Now hes just a mule.
---
Also, why does PA suck so much Bethesda? Fuck.
---
The auto-health regeneration bug has been fixed in the PTS, so maybe not Lifegiver.
---
I think adrenaline is good. That will be fixed in patch 21.
---
Are you using explosive weapons? Fireproof is a good perk. It’s also helpful against scorchbeasts.
---
Yeah, I like to make a lv5 recon rifle, throw a .50 receiver on it, make a batch of .50, and drop it in front of a low level, or in the overseers camp box.
---
The tightest squads often win so long as a nuke or vats grenades don’t have a say in the matter.  
---
I’d say this is probably rare, I havent seen any of my team mates or larger group of friends I play with ever order a low level around, we may emote them to come over so we can work as a unit to see if they are a team player, when we are dropping a nuke, or give them weapons, ammo, armor.   But it’s easy to tell if they are jackasses in which case good riddance to leave them be and wave good bye when they get downed doing their own thing.
---
I don’t want to repeat the story, but all you need to know was I arrived back from a break and didn’t know the value of a certain item and got swindled, it still hurts me to this day.
---
Oh my god this made me laugh so hard
---
Lmao yeah its difficult. I went trough that because i wanted to be a shotgun build. Pure torture
---
I AGREE. Come on, give the PA some love. I dont understand how i can get killed by a cave cricket biting me trough hardened steel.
---
Berkeley for me 😑
---
As were the (then) completely useless gamma/radium weapons..
---
I absolutely have noticed very early on that my unyielding/low-life chars suffer the fast travel bug, but my one full life character does not.
---
In fact, i played for weeks reading about all these fast travel bugs and never experiencing one myself. Then, literally minutes after equipping my first unyielding piece on a new L10-ish low-life char, i had it happen for the first time.
---
Yeah, true just figuring I’ll be tired of the grind by the time I hit the 90s. I have a pact with myself that if I get the server service ghilllie then I’ll be good. Anything between that and space man PA is cake. I’m sure they will come up with plenty to entice me to spend before then so knowing me I’ll end spending atom and then up grinding anyway.
---
The game technically has no limit but going past 350 Damage Resistance / 375 Energy Resistance will start yielding diminishing returns in terms of how much Defense will protect you from damage.
---
Bloodied unarmed melee full Heath unyielding. 
---
Yes, I realize the full health makes no sense. But I got tied of getting squished before getting into melee range. Even with serendipity and other damage mitigation perks. 
---
Also I do so much damage even at full health that it really doesn’t matter most of the time. If it does I will likely lose enough health to make up for it as the big bad wails on me. So it made life better for me. 
---
However, I have mostly been playing my original toon who is a sneaky rifleman. Bloodied unyielding. Got a BE25 (sadly not 2525) handmade and a bloodied lever action that I love. Now that I have the ammo generator from the raiders I am rolling in 5.56mm.
---
I am nearly certain that was built by a remote contractor in a very low cost area, who has never played the game, and who was given maybe a three sentence description of what to build and a list of ammunition.
---
I've used it twice, the first time realizing it was a joke in terms of both time and the ammo conversion ratio, and the second just pushing through .45mm grenades (70 points for 5) to max out the points in case they ever make it not complete garbage.
---
Now I just throw ammo away.
---
Is putting nukashine in my punch bowl a bad thing??  Oopsie
---
Thx, I didn't used any Atoms yet, but I'll probably need to until the end of the season to get to lvl100 - btw, is the exact date of season end is already known?
---
Nothing worse than that :(
---
The Leader has the ability to quick change the Group rewards. Probably for that reason.
---
Although, Stupidity should never be discounted when dealing with humans, source: Pandemic..masks..5G..Flat Earth etc, etc, etc
---
PvP build, to punish noob hunters who swipe workshops from sub level 50s.
---
Not going so well.
---

---
Cover Delta and Drop Site. Leave the grove open.
---
Ah, cool thanks. Even after more than 30 years of gaming my aim is terrible.
---
I literally picked up 20+ legendaries playing over about 1-2 hours yesterday. Just play the game. 
---
Nothing will be handed to you. If you only have 15 minutes to play a day then this task isn’t for you unless lucky.  The other day I went to whitesprings and found 8 just inside the club house.
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
Console pvp is terrible lmao. That shit is all telsa
---
I try to do that but half the time I forget. I really wish it would remember what you set it to rather than always defaulting to on.
---
You get group bonuses even when you are the only person in a group. They probably just wanted to get the +1 int and not be in group with anyone else. I do this all the time in my private world.
---
It's because completing the objectives or the successful completion of the event isn't their goal. Their goal is to secure XP, loot and, most importantly, all three legendaries.
---
Issue is with magic weapons. Not something new, just something that has come out into the public lately. Fairly easy to find one of these weapons since the primary and secondary effects needed are not really wanted on the weapons needed. I come across 5-10 magic weapons a day in player vending machines for 2-5k caps.

You don't know flamingo units?
---
I have 4/5 so yes, I can do It. I'll be playing in a couple of hours. GT: delarro
---
This is why I carry a lightweight pistol on my melee guy and a switchblade on the rifle one-shotter.  I can't stand tagging it, waving people over, and watching the one shot melee/rifle headshot guy run in first and drop it.   
---
I mean yeah, there are certain events (rad rumble) where it's not really convenient to call over the whole group and risk failing it for one legendary, but for the rest...  come on.
---
People just jumping in for a few minutes to meet daily challenges and not screw with real teams? Or maybe players who prefer solo but are getting a small bonus from their “group” of one (I think Herd Mentality even works as a group of one). Lots of possible reasons.
---
Junkie heavy gunner with as much health as i can get (447 with buffs), sometimes in power armor, sometimes not. Been toying with the idea of getting nerd rage and serendipity to play around with low health junkie playstyle for damage, while retaining the option to play at high health. I just don’t wanna commit to adrenal reaction just yet bc it reduces my max health and rn my max health is specifically where it’s at in order to survive 4 damage-cap hits in pvp.
---
edit: I use to use a really varied assortment of heavy guns but ever since getting a junkie FFR FR LMG, i haven’t played with much else. My junkie explo .50cal was my baby before this. Junkie gauss minigun for funsies sometimes.
---
Thank you and you guys aswell of course!
---
I put up with Bethesda tech support. I bought the game at launch but kept getting an error code for a failed backend before it would even load the menu, ive played far more network straining games just fine on my internet and they said my network was too slow. I ended up giving up after far too much back and forth with support, then tried again after wild Appalachia update, everything worked fine, only thing that changed between them was a game update
---
Nope, just giving feedback that this new event wasn’t as good as double XP. Love this game. ❤️ Just not sure what the goal was for this weekend. If it was to keep player session times up, It didn’t seem to accomplish the goal. Looking forward to meat week, that will probably do the trick.
---
tough choice, but I lean toward vampire.
---
  The queen usually has lots of supporting staff attacking you while you are attacking her, so the health regen is quite useful.
---
I should also mention- all dailies have the chance to award you with less than 3 if you fail to complete them before their timer ends. The Chow Line has you eating 6 hotdogs before the timer ends. The Dross Toss has you lobbing a piece of 'dross' through each of the three hanging tires \*once\* (even though you get 5 pieces). The Lucky Mucker has you dropping coal off at four wheelbarrows scattered around the park.  It's always best to clear out the trash in the park before starting them (especially the Lucky Mucker)  if you are a lower level player, or you do not know where all 4 wheelbarrows are.
---
Filthy casual, lvl 84, East coast US and online most nights around 9:00pm. Ignored most quests for the longest time because I love building and just generally mess around. 30+ years old. Feel free to add, PSN same as here.
---
How recent was this change? As of last week, my Santatron was definitely opening the doors of my Red Rocket garage to get outside.
---
For me a couple of reasons, I run two characters, just easier to create a private and convert to public, also there has been some instances of people getting kicked out of groups for been too low level, bot sharing a card, kidding mentality ..
---
Also for me, I see a lot of offensive GT's, such as SucMyWood .. yeah I don't need to see that GT while I am playing .. besides who doesn't want to be a team leader .. kidding ..
---
I have played for hours with the same team members, so people will join and typically stay.
---
My favorite is when the dailies or weeklies are to claim workshops. Lets me farm junk and caps all day.
---
I dunno yo.. bad luck I guess.. 
---
Ive been able to pick them up without much issue...
---
Private servers are good for this...
---
Also, just do it on public server outside of busy hours, like early morning/late night.
---
Yes I have it. I think it is mainly due to me forgetting that I'm not on my main (the junkie PA heavy). It usually is only after dying that I realise I'm playing bloodied. Ten seconds later, I forget it again and charge into battle like an idiot.
---
Tested?  Tested?  What a strange word.  Tested.
---
Can be few reasons - maybe they want to play with friends (despite using public group), maybe they don't like the bonus cards you or other players share, maybe they want to be leader and have the ability to change group focus?
---
As others mentioned, set the pacifist mode on; I’ve been able to avoid at least one asshat near Whitesprings thanks to that setting. I know that at least since sometime last year you only drop junk if you die in the game (PvP or otherwise) though what I read seems to imply that you used to lose more than just junk in the past. If that was the case, well, it’s no longer like that.
---
Someone's projecting real hard. You're the one acting like an "entitled karen" with your shitty attitude.
---
NW is an objectively bad BR.
---
A lvl 1 and a lvl 100, with the exception of experience and map knowledge, should have basically the same odds of winning a gunfight. But the lvl 100 more than likely has defensive perks and damage boosting perks (that require rng to get), which shouldn't be in the game mode. So the higher lvl with busted perks will almost always win that fight. That's the definition of imbalance.
---
Players are basically encouraged to camp. Not only is it incredibly easy to crouch in a bush and be almost undectable (even more so with ghillie suits), players get far more xp for doing nothing rather than actually playing the game and getting a handful of kills. That's the definition of poor design.
---
Not to mention frog legs being basically essential (more rng to get). So everyone jumps around while shooting in vats (literal aimbot). Put it all together and you get the worst BR I've ever played.
---
Just FYI
---
If you run these events you'll get this daily easily:
---
Leader of the pack and uranium fever events have multiple guaranteed legendarys. Riding Shotgun has one guaranteed legendary. Then there is also the SBQ event.
---
I play 1 hr-1.5 hrs daily and no way do i see that many.  Even server hopping the club house got nothing. Huntersville zero. Harpers zero. Welch zero. Admit i didn't try west tek. Found a single legendary scorchbeast... that's it. Maybe just an unlucky day.
---
I lost my nuke virginity just the other day. Best feeling ever.
---
Nope. Yellow, orange, and brown for the fall color effect. 
---
And in season 3 they will be white
---
I don't bother in radiation rumble. Most of the time i don't realise a legendary is there until i've already killed it. 
---
IF i do know there's a legendary there and i don't think there's any immediate danger to the NPCs i'll try and just cripple it by shooting at the ground near it.
---
And this is the "D is for Diploma" version.
---
Then youd have all these phychotic cultist slumming around your camp, building effigies all up on your vending machines, and tryin to kill you and shit for not converting to their faith.
---
Whatever you say i asked if anyone was interested not if you like pvp on console and it being all Tesla is not true because any sane or smart player would use a BE/JE/TSE laser rifle over a Tesla rifle any day of the week.
---
Rank 63, I am ahead of Zorbo.
---
It hurt my ego, that’s why I never got over it.
---
Yeah I definitely notice less legendaries all around, leader of the pack is available, just watch the map or server hop at the country fairground, you will eventually get it, but might take 10-20 hops sometimes, other times less than 5. If somebody is doing it, don't go after it, so many times I see people taking 1 of my legendaries, I am obviously doing the challenge and this just wastes everyones time.
---
WestTek had two legendaries outside if you can handle the heat but you likely need to server hop, it's not consistent ..
---
Whoa, what’s that outfit on the left?
---
Horse armor was better than this.  It should have been free, but at least it goes on your horse without 500 clicks.
---
Private server crashed while I was transferring some stuff to a mule. Lost my DE pipe pistol, as well as my b2525 radium, b2525 laser rifle, and a few other bloodied/junkies weapons that I was probably never gonna use but had trade value.
---
I'm sorry.i will go back to your post but once I saw broadsider I understand the frustration..lol I found a quad and figured if any version of this would work it would be that one.hell no run way from the thing as if you're running from skar and your simba.run away and never return
---
(BoS supervisor): "These don't appear to be standard issue, you obviously stole them"
---
(you are now hated by the BoS and must do rep quests in order to do the rep quests to get the BoS rep quests)
---
so sick of seeing this. it. is. an. exploit.
---
You missed my point completely. 
---
YOU liked Double XP week but didn't care for Double Score. 
---
I liked Double Score and didn't care about Double XP.
---
I think their goal was...as I stated before was to APPEAL TO MORE PLAYERS THEN JUST YOU.
---
Yes there are a few spots where its possible. 
---
Check here: https://fo76map.com/ and look to see (select hide all and then select just resources to view just them on map)
---
full uny bloodied stealth commando, the cliche haha. all damage perks, no qol bullshit. crazy xp gains, agility in the 30’s so your so sneaky, perception just as high so you can basically vats everything around you with gun fu and crits. its definitely popular cause the synergy is undeniable.
---
Can you erm server hop a private server? 
---
Maybe the correct wording would be,  how do i refresh a private server?
---
not all interiors are instanced
---
The portable power perk says something about a "system" for carrying power armor, so..
---
I light RP as Enclave, and I'm a stealth pistol build with heavy guns/PA capability, so it's my head canon that while I'm swapping perks, I'm actually calling in a Kovac-Muldoon drop of my PA with the gauss minigun and gatling plasma stored in the PA.
---
I guess the system is a built in Fulton recovery device, so when I put it away, I just hear Kaz saying "you're gonna take *this*?" because it's all covered in Scorched blood and mirelurk guts.
---
I think at the end of the day if you asked someone if they'd take the thousands of atoms they could get for doing old dailies, or the season rewards, a lot of people would take the atoms.
---
I think that's the one from Dev's room.... &gt;.&gt;
---
i like when the explosive rifle has +40% bash dmg....
---
(bash!)... (gun is broken)
---
[edit: forgot the /s]
---
Using the ammo converter reminds me of the program I have use at work for adjusting inventory levels.
---
My fiance said it's from the Free States Revolutionary bundle in the Atom Shop 😊
---
That's how movement speed works in adventure mode as well.  And also other BR.  COD:Warzone impacts your move speed depending on what weapon you have out.  Counter Strike has done that for forever.
---
Alright that coat. Where the f do I get it.
---
Build on thunder mountain lake, can't get flatter than that :) I see lots of creative ship camps
---
mine doesnt look that good on my t60.  
---
Great pic.
---
It's definitely frustrating. I swear they coded some algorithm that massively reduces the spawn chance of any creature that shows up as a "Kill X" objective. The day we had to kill Super Mutants I was hopping to every common SM spawn point only to find ghouls instead.
---
It's worth checking out The Sewers in Harper's Ferry, Fort Defiance, and of course the Clubhouse at Whitesprings. All higher than average places to find legendary spawns, and they're good XP regardless.
---
Granted, that's where a lot of people go, so if you're not prepared to server hop a time or two then you may be out of luck.
---
I'll make my own Chapter with blackjack and hookers
---
That would be good. I'm a hardcore coffee drinker IRL (Subsribed to Death Wish coffee for a pound a month), and I'm always excited when I find canned coffee in-game.
---
Arms are supposed to be getting deep pocket mods I believe.
---
That’s adorable. I’m glad that 76 enabled you guys to hang out despite the miles.
---
Not really, but it's the principle.  The NPCs are human.  Therefore, the anti-human prefix ought to work on them.
---
Just use a doorway on the second floor, closes the gap
---
Go to a public one rq then back to priv. Should grab a new one
---
I used to do that in CoD and got called "Camper" by all the rampagers but I didn't care - I sat in a field with long grass for an hour in a private match once until everybody got stroppy.
---
Was from E3 bundle from last year not sure if they ever gonna release it again
---
The idea being do not fast travel to that location, but leg it. Guaranteed to get side tracked, discover new locations and pick up other quests en route. That way your'journey'will level you as you go.
---
Take in the scenery, explore, enjoy oddities, and wave to the jet packing veteran flying past you, knowing that your Appalachian future will be just as gloriously grindy, if not better, than that players, eventually. It's not a race.
---
Mine started again for Roxy after some suggested it was dialogue related. Instead of skipping the dialogue I let it run through and it seemed to help. Still not working with Blackeye though.
---
Unarmed bloodied. What can I say, one shotting a super mutant with a metal fist is pretty damn nice.
---
It's the Rare Todd special
---
Load a private server. Exit to main menu, hop to a public server, wait a few minutes, then start a new private one.
---
The system remembers on your private server for 5 minutes, but most of the times it will forget it if you do something in a public server, like 80% of the times.
---
I've found, when It happens to me I can't fast travel to say my camp but I can fast travel to the station next to my camp.
---
Are those things human or what
---
Well going off of that, I think they should at least return to the burrows idea and include expansive underground locations including exploring fissure sites. They can be late game locations with high radiation but tons of flux and ultra ore and rare materials and great rewards. The fissure sites can have scorched and scortchbeats that pop up around corners or areas of the map. Make it feel cramped and dark, kinda horrifying even.
---
Yeah, I know.   Same here with my ultracite 2 mm EC during SE.   Stuff can go fast.   It's always kinda shocking to me when I look at the amount and see something like only 300 left.   Ooof.   How do you keep up with shells?   Are you able to buy from players' vending, or do you spend time in Lucky Hole mining lead or ?
---
When I join a game I immediately make an intelligence team.  If people join that’s great. If they don’t that’s fine. But I like being the team leader. So whenever we do events I keep us at intelligence to earn that sweet extra xp for everything that I do. Up until I see there is an event, I keep it regular for as long as I can. Then when the event is about to end, then I switch the team to events. So I get the extra event xp. 
---
So to answer your question, some people like myself like to be in charge and be able to switch the team you’re in at any random time.
---
The enemies scale to the first player in the area.
---
Wow, I watched the vid and you guys are awesome 😁 I gave you a like and hit the subscribe button 🤗
---
The hardest part of calibrated shocks is getting the 10 stable violet flux.
---
6k caps is tedious, but relatively easy.
---
I’d Buy the bullion, then spend a couple days looting everything that isnt nailed down and selling It to the bot vendors.
---
hard bargain3+ grape mentats + alcohol thats boosts chr, and the calibrated shock plan is cheaper.
---
Or
---
ask someone you trust That already has the plan if you provide the mats, could/would they mod the armor for you?
---
I do monster mash alone on a private server. Kind of boring, but I always get three legendaries out of it. For some reason, this and AWOL pop up constantly on my private server.
---
I go to Forward Point Delta, typically I find at least 1 or 2 legendary scorchbeasts flying around. Then, after that I run over to to the grove whatever it's called, and there's a possibility there's another one in there, barring that, running over toward Watoga where the other fissure sites are at, make a stop by NAR, those will typically will yield another legendary. If still no luck, I run all the way up and start Ridin' Shotgun - which counts toward the 'Complete an Event' challenge, plus the legendary one, too. 
---
Somewhere within that run, I've typically found enough legendaries to reliably complete that challenge every time so far.
---
Definitely a glitch lol. I've seen it happen before during the sbq
---
I really enjoyed the game before it became a BR. I like being able to build bases and still have quests, but I just could not play that BR. I was really sad when they got rid of the original mode.
---
The issue is that I didn’t know if you were assessing these rifles based on their damage per shot (which I assumed) or their overall performance. I would have to disagree with you if it is the latter, because a semi-automatic fixer/handmade/lever action rifle is hands down better than a railway rifle that cannot be suppressed and a gauss rifle with VATS issues.
---
My friends and I actually did that once where we set up camps along the first path that new players take from the vault to the overseer camp. From there, we just have the new players a bunch of free ammo, junk, aid and weapons and armor crafted for them to get them set up, many of them thanked us and some just ran by scared of the 200-400 level players haha
---
make it so! :D
---
Do riding shotgun if you’re struggling with finding legendaries. Many times I’ve got more than three in just one riding shotgun event.
---
It's a glitch. Sometimes the Power Armor and weapon will deconstruct and reassemble into some freakish creation (only visually) like a Star Trek transporter malfunction.
---
While you're in Harpers, do you go down into the Burrows? If not, you should.
---
It just works!!!!
---
The only thing I could come up with is 76 does have lower floors, just foundations, and I assumed that's why it isn't in already.
---
Like other people already pointed out, some people are even unable to read the objectives for Encryptid which are 'only' go to Pylon X, press 'E' and help in the damn event. Regardsless how detailed you're going to make instructions there will always be people running around like chickens with their head chopped off.
---
I don't even want to know how the future Monogah mine event is going to work out if it's even a bit more complex than the normal events.
---
I did the same last night.  It really does feel like an accomplishment doing it solo and then taking down the a Queen you summoned.
---
:)
---
Thanks for the smile. Hope you all face to face sooner than later. Good Luck
---
Honestly the nicest people I have ever met are playing this game and I love to share the love too
---
It could be that it was only 'approved' way to do it.
---
Bethesda has seemingly shied away from using a 'trade' like interface for new things since they're often tied to dupe glitches.
---
 Ignorance is bliss...I’m Fairly confident I have sold (for cheap), scrapped and/or given away more than one “rare” item.
---
  And I’ll probably do it again.
---
Not enough people really know this 
---
I mean, I'm not complaining because I make a lot of caps selling Vanguard armor but if you want the best full health, damage mitigation armor than you want 1 vanguard and then one each of troubleshooters, zealot, ect. 
---
I have a my solar armor set up like that and I can't remember the last time I was ever below even 75% health no matter what I'm fighting
---
I was going to make a post similar to this one yesterday because we had a full group for events with everyone completely bonded.  Then one of the group left an a moment later started his own events group and I was like WTF is the purpose of that.
---
Needless to say someone else joined our group and when I logged off later he was still alone.  Idk if he just thought everyone should be going to the same events together or if he just wanted to be the leader of his own group, but he lost a lot of experience because of it.
---
A few people are trying to use the groups to actually group up, and not basically be 4 players soloing with a common benefit, so that could be one reason - if they saw the people were just in random places. 
---
People may have interacted with others before and simply not want to group with them
---
People may not want to group with people under a certain level because those people won’t be able to share good perk cards
---
Some people just want to be in control of the team so they don’t get kicked out for playing how they want.
---
I play NW hiding as well - played three games yesterday coming in 3rd, 2nd, and 3rd in the games by being a sneaky bugger. In the one I came in second, I was hiding in a bush near a tree when a player who knew I was near by snuck behind the tree and tried to hide in the shadow. He was about 3 feet from me and facing away...so I took aim on the back of his head from my bush with a gatling gun and fired one shot...must have scared the heck out of him.
---
I always go out of my way to avoid fights but have killed a couple of players just because they ran up and tried to hide in my bush. Now I always try to have at least some kind of weapon for bush defense.
---
Why not join one of the current PvP groups? I'm in one, and there's almost always cheeks getting clapped. Lol.
---
wow
---
If there was a point in there then maybe state it without yelling and without going on the offensive. People are more likely to respond to your criticism positively that way. ✌️
---
Edit: I peeked at your post history and saw you play POGO, I do too. It makes way more sense to me to say - double xp is for you (low levels) and double star dust (veterans) is for you, but really, double stardust is for everyone - i feel like you just said star dust is only for certain play styles, if that makes sense. Score is something we all strive for right now regardless of play style. It would be like getting more stardust on a double xp weekend than a double stardust weekend. Sounds like I’m in the minority of this experience though
---
Yeah, the current pandemic triggers my anxiety, but the game takes my mind off that, especially when I play it with my fiance 😊
---
Really good point. I run a full set of Zealots Armor, which also minimizes damage overall, but I still have to worry about things like the Mirelurk Kings, Hunters and Radscorpions with poison.
---
I get on my low level char to gain quick lvls. Lol
---
Buying it.
---
Agreed. It's not *too* much of a hassle, if you don't need excessive amounts of ammo, but it could be much better. Thing is, having it work more like a vendor - "sell" all the ammo you don't want, getting points you can spend on the ammo you do want - is such an *obvious* solution that I think there must be *some* reason they didn't do it. Heck, the terminal part looks like it was just slapped down next to it; I'd imagine you were probably *supposed* to interact with the animated part originally, similar to the scrip machines... My only guess is they probably *did* try it originally, but had some sort of issues with server stability, or potential exploits, or...*something*, that they decided a terminal system would be more *stable*, despite being less intuitive to use. :/
---
Last time this happened big daddy tod and his mongrels we’re fixing the servers
---
Wich kind of weapons do you use. I can tell you of you stood a chance by knowing this. I have to Charakters, one to counter the other build, both meta.
---
Crossing my fingers on that! Thanks a lot 😊
---
Fallout 76 is basically a testing tube for fallout 5 and we are all rats in this experiment
---
Yeah same, except when i give away rare items, i give it to people that has been playing with me for a pretty long time. Ive given away the blue ridge company backpack plan, and 2 full imposter sheepsquatch outfits to 2 friends who i play with every day.
---
I wish you guys the best and to see each other face-to-face soon!
---
It’s boring if you bush Wookiee it, then again any game would be.
---
Agreed. It's honestly brahmin shit. Now I have to buy secret service armor and the stealth suit. 
---
And siding with the raiders rewards you with nothing except Johnny being a pos.
---
What platform are you on? I could offer you some unused items.
---
Wood foundations and stairs work alright - had a nice bridge at my old CAMP about halfway between Gregs Mine Supply and Morgantown.
---
I miss that camp sometimes, but I love The Mire now.
---
LMG with FFR.....RiP ammo.
---
Shotgunner. Absolute devastating. Has the accuracy of a lever action (not scoped in) and has an average of 240 dmg. (Can easily be boosted with the small guns bobble head and different issues of things like Covert Operative.) Always love a scoped lever for a bit of sniping though.
---
I was lucky enough to get two shot explosive pipe revolvers so I'm not an explo gunner (I use gatling plasma/laser/gun)
---
[u/BethesdaGameStudios\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/BethesdaGameStudios_/) 
---
In hopes of this getting seen. Thank you.
---
That's also true - though I find they burn through ammo regardless of the perks.
---
Stealth Archer/two handed melee build. Full set of vanguard armor. 
---
[Strider Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fd574a2&amp;d=s42sf2ss2sm2sn2p10pn2pt2pu2pv2ej4c72c52a70a42am2l90l60i43an2&amp;wp=waw2&amp;wm=11-1122&amp;n=Strider)
---
Why? Because an anti armor plasma bow and Grognak’s axe is more fun than all you bloodied riflemen boiz running around.
---
Carnivore mutation. Meat is everywhere. And because i play low-life unyielding builds, i have lead belly maxed (no rads from food/water) so i can drink from any watersource NP and dont have to carry water with me.
---
herbivores are actually easier, because of their soups. They refill food and water and are stupid easy to craft. Just a corn/razorgrain and a boiling water. Tp to the right farms and you have huge fields of razorgrain.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Thank you so much and keep safe out there 😊 FO76 community got lots of really nice people 💕
---
That is usually the main reason I have to switch characters.
---
It's just amazing, isn't it?   "yeah, well I need all of my 5.56 ammo too"
---
Sounds like it would be broken for xp.
---
Since when does concentrated fire have an impact on range? This is the first I’ve heard this
---
That would be great man, do you mind if I just send you a DM later when I’ve got the game fired up again? That way I can just tell you my SPECIAL stats and the perks I’m currently using
---
I'm well ahead of Zorbo.  But every now and then, I look back at him and wonder if he's like, "Finally, a Glow-in-the-Dark Stars and Planets wallpaper for my evil lair!"
---
Yesterday I decided to hide under water and there were two people already there. The three of us just hung out quietly for about 5 minutes until we had to move. If I knew they wouldn’t try to kill me, I’d just leave the other bush dwellers alone.
---
guided meditation. always get a few there as well.
---
PvP because you wouldn't give them a handout?   ROTFL!   Okay, how can I kill them quickly?   I mean, besides the anti-armor gauss minigun.
---
For me they hardly show who owns it. The fast travel glitch says it’s charging you caps to travel there but it never actually charges you. That happens for me mostly at red rocket station
---
I'm currently playing what I like to call a Murder Hobo. Basically a highly mutated unarmed build where I jump around and punch things to death with a power fist, popping chems and drinking booze now and then to make sure I can efficiently beat the crap out of things. I actually run two different power fists too, an instigating and a furious, so if something survives the first punch I swap to the furious to start racking up even more damage. There's only a couple of things that concern me survivability wise, and that's fighting mirulurk queens and super mutants with miniguns. Thankfully neither survives long but once in awhile I'll end up having to hippity hoppity my murder hobo rear back over to my junk. Its also really nice that I don't have to worry about crafting any ammo.
---
Yeah that would be great but hey atleast you try to remember and that’s a good start
---
Wait tech data is useful? Every time I hand it in I just get some bullets and water.
---
That's been my hope, too, and it's why I'll always try to complete the event, even if I'm stuck with idiots who don't care to repair the extractors or who deliberately one-shot all the legendaries... missing out on the legendaries is especially annoying since it's so often a daily challenge now, but, biggest thing I want from that is just the darn Raider Underarmor lining plans. *Supposedly* the two highest levels for those drop from events in the Savage Divide... *still* haven't even gotten the Protective lining yet, though, let alone the Shielded. &gt;&lt;
---
That’s always confused me about this game. Mutant attacks me with a super sledge, drops a board, wth?
---
Yes, it was. Either that or you used two level ups. 
---
Occam’s Razor. What are the odds that it just *happened* to appear once you actually looked close enough, compared to the odds that it was there and you just weren’t looking closely enough?
---
It’s been there and available for selection for the past 130 level-ups. 
---
It was user error. Nothing more.
---
Ricochet is a nice 18% chance-to-avoid on all incoming ranged fire. Takes up three of those precious luck points though. And there are a lot of really nice perks in the luck tree.
---
I make my own, so A) I don't get booted for no reason; and B) I can change the Team Goal between Building and Events
---
you can't fire back in pacifist as you do no damage when they hit you or when you hit them thus never triggers and teams also no longer trigger your pvp anymore since last update
---
Yes that is at least how its supposed to work but my shadowed scout armour is 11,44 lbs and the mixture of shadowed leather and combat armour is in total obscene 19,08 lbs and yet it performs night and day literally.
---
I can see who owns it everytime but i cant remember fast travel tho
---
Dammit..
---
Thank you for the reply and info, if picking it up digitally will improve the performance I might consider it, or maybe wait until my new pc to play, it's somewhat good to know Atleast the issues aren't universal, still a shame but it is what it is
---
mainly vats based perks all in the luck tree and I dont really use vats so yeah that's up for debate, depends on your playstyle but ricochet is a good perk, I don't think I have it on though? would have to check
---
Hoping does not make it so, it just annoys everybody else.
---
&gt; they just tell me to try again or contact Playstation support
---
Doing one thing over and over again, expecting a different result, is not very smart. Especially in this circumstance where it is known that the achievements are broken.
---
Fight it out with PS's or Beth's support but don't get mad when your 5th or 6th attempt with your toons wont work.
---
Heavy PA with weight reduction on just about everything. Despite having less options than normal armor, it's fun to use PA for the simple fact that I like it. I carry just about every heavy weapon, and multiples of most. If it goes boom or shoots bullets forever, I have it. I also have hundreds of several types of chems, and loads of schorchbeast meat. I am a walking tank, and can even get face to face with the impostor sheesquatch mostly unscathed. My version of stealth is making the enemy blind and deaf by my two shot fat man. I deliver a laser light show of death with my ultracite gatling lasers.
---
I am heavy weapons guy.
---
Thank you so much I hope my video gave you a smile as much as your story did, I know you can get there too, this was out first one and I was shocked that how amazing we did
---
My comment is that if you treat the amount of illumination as a percentage, I'd rather it pulse between 80%-100% rather than 0%-100% like it does.  Half the time, it produces no light at all, which is kind of a problem if you want to use it as a light.
---
I do that event for the notes and Addictol. I couldn’t find any for days and I did this twice and I had 9. Otherwise yea it’s an annoying event when nothing spawns.
---
You never play it, so why the hell do you care? You obviously don’t like it, rather than make a bitchy post on here for people who do like it to see, go do something for yourself rather than have someone else do it for you.... lazy wanker. 
---
You could of done this in a more constructive way but you chose this route.
---
Thinking something is shit just cause you suck at it as you say is real class.
---
Oh yeah feel free to do that :)
---
Have you tried any other games since the crash? Are they looking as expected? This seems like a hardware issue.
---
Has a chance to roll for all ranks of T-60 BoS paint
---
Agreed, ita a complete mess. I  highly doubt they have any plans to clean it up unfortunately.
---
Toggling it to display only what one can build help immensely, which j just learned one can do last week.
---
I play with all 5 characters so I also need to makes sure I don't buy too much crap plans. What I do on each character is:
---
* check what your worst piece of armor is.
---
* buy the plan (and mods if you can afford) for that piece of armor
---
* craft, craft, craft... until you have a good/very good piece
---
* then look at you second worst piece of armor and continue the cycle
---
=&gt; By the time you create a good piece, you'll have more than enough bullion to buy the next plan. Due to RNG, you'll most likely even have enough bullion to buy other plans, like the weapon plans. 
---
=&gt; This of course also works for the weapons. Start with what you need most, keep creating them and only buy the next weapon plan once you have a decent version of the first weapon.
---
I've noticed a lot of high level players will join events like "Feed the People", but will leave their character just standing in the middle of the factory. They are obviously AFK, and trying to reap the benefits of others hard work.
---
To make it worse, they are usually just in their undies, throwing it in your face that they are there to contribute exactly nothing.
---
Right bro I was devastated when I found out got like 5k caps for the both of them could've had my b fixer by now if I hadn't done that.
---
But if any one has a bloodied fixer ( literally any bloodied fixer even a 1*) I'll will happily trade you for it I do have some good bloodied and junkies stuff + caps flux and other junk
---
they are supposed to be 10+ week long events this one started on June 30th, so tomorrow is the start of week 5 and September 8th would be the 10 week, however I could see them extend it 1-2 weeks if a lot of players are behind and blaming the whole daily/weekly bug.
---
VATS/Stealth Rifleman. It's the same thing I've done in basically every Bethesda game, and sure, *I know*, the stealth archer thing is a bit overdone and cliche at this point... but that's because it's so much fun! Plus, I've been doing that since Oblivion, well before I had any idea it had become basically a meme, *so\~...*
---
...normally, anyway. I swear it seems like something's broken with stealth again - possibly the conflict between Chameleon effects and the Escape Artist perk that *was* fixed previously... wondering if the latest patch might've un-fixed it. :/
---
Demolition expert would actually be good for exploding energy weapons. Just don’t shoot her directly, shoot at the ground underneath her when she lands. Energy explosions do a lot more damage from the splash than direct hits.
---
You are an inspiration sir. I am on the final weeks of a months long grind to do the same
---
It did, brought in a ton of new players, servers are busy, it’s a top played game, people who got banned also hang out with others who got banned, so they assume the couple hundred players who got banned is the entirety of the player base.
---
Youre part of the problem.
---
Leave people TF alone if they obviously dont want you around.
---
gotta love the Elder Maxon rested bitch face, lol
---
the BoS PA paint is awesome too
---
Bloodied rifleman because killing thing’s. I’ve been saving up some junk Weapons though and after doing some research on what addictions are best I’m gonna make the switch. Gonna be nice to be at full health.
---
Sweeeet! I'll inbox later! Let's kill some things!
---
Glitchers
---
Been a known glitch for weeks now.
---
I toggle that but it’s still a terrible mess. I worked as a production artist in publishing. The longer you let a mess go the harder it will be to fix later. 
---
They have to address this or it’s really going to be a nightmare.
---
Why build new when you can reuse old assets? And names.
---
It's a glitch. Happens when the detail exceeds 15x.
---
PvP is dynamic, don’t compare NW to the same 1,000th scorch beast fight in adventure.. that’s the draw of PvP is endless replayability. That’s why I stopped adventure mode a longggggg time ago and never looked back once I tried NW.  While new maps would be refreshing, it’s usable as it is.  
---
If 400+ is a loser than what are you?
---
PS4
---
I don't disagree with the idea of having to play to receive rewards, or the idea of not giving anything away for minimal effort etc. BUT - I do think they could have arranged it a little bit differently...have the event go a week longer than strictly needed to allow players who may miss a day here or there due to real life a chance to still finish. 
---
Or allow a system where a player who is limited to  a few days a week, but can play all day (so puts in just as much time as a daily player if not more) to catch up.
---
Me too. :)
---
I can add you next time I'm on. :)
---
You suck at NW and Reddit posts, winning you are.
---
Magic guns. Magic 3 star armor.
---
I like it when people leave a type of group with a full 4x bond to start the same group... and no one joins.
---
And the spawn point in it. Who needs that masses/fluids, anyway?
---
Don’t server hop old spots. Huntersville is not a farm spot anymore.  Just visit all daily locations and events on same server.  You want to be on same server the whole time and legendaries are spread throughout. This at least works for me.  I’ve never seen anyone farming and camping by events so maybe your unlucky in that regard
---
Monster mash is new farm location for me.
---
The higher level locations will likely have more legendaries. 
---
AWOL armaments spawns 2 times an hour it seems and there is usually 1-3 in that event.  
---
But Bethesda making every enemy legendary will dilute trading and make game not as challenging. 
---
Try nuking. Takes about 20 minutes to run the silo
---
There’s a guaranteed legendary in riding shotgun event
---
There’s like 12 legendaries every radiation rumble event
---
List goes on but stay in same lobby for the whole time and do everything u can in the time u have
---
I'd settle for something other than the crudest lesbo outfits and haircuts. It's the wasteland but geez... Even that slimy Russian in Fallout 3 was able to run a sex party camp!!
---
On my second character I am doing a pistol build, mainly revolver but other pistols depending on how much ammo I have.
---
My next character is going to be a medic. I haven’t planned out what perks and weapons but probably high intelligence.
---
Ran out of steel sorry
---
I noticed last night that if i chucked a frag grenade into a fissure i would get immediately disconnected. Happened twice in a row. Didnt bother trying a third time. It seems that fissures dont like being exploded.
---
This reminds me of a similar bug in the Battletech video game.
---
Your XO is a guy called Darius, and he is notorious for being perhaps the worst intel officer in the Periphery. Memeworthy uselessness.
---
At some point in the past year his name accidentally slipped into the random faction generator for enemies, so every once in a while you'll take a mission where you'll have to fight enemies from the "Darius" faction.
---
Explained a lot about his shitty intel - he has obviously been playing us all along while building his own Periphery state.
---
Damn, I might be more on top of handing it in. Usually I just do it whenever I happen to be in the Mire.
---
Who tf is todd?😂😂
---
I repurpose a lot of junk in real life especially in my (city) garden too so it's totally my vibe. :)
---
This is no excuse for toxicity. If a low level wants to go off and do their own thing, i don’t get mad. If a low level rushes into and dies trying to go commando, I dint get mad. When *I* get mad it’s because he tries to order me to do stupid crap that will get me killed, then tries to commando, dies because the rest of us aren’t idiots and didnt follow him into a building full of people with shotguns, then micspams until the rest of us die because we couldn’t hear where a damn rocket launcher was coming from.
---
Todd Howard the guy behind Bethesda
---
Confirm. Like 330 caps with no charisma.
---
*And that even includes Starched Genes!*
---
I’d love to have my heavy guns strapped either along my side as I walked or around my lower back, god that’d look cool!
---
That'd be dope! I wish my husband played, the only time I used to smoke weed was to watch him play GTA5 because he's just not a gamer and he'd make the most ridiculous choices, was so terrible I'd die laughing.  Wish he could play with us too but it'd be a shit show xD. I can add you next time I play. :)
---
Now watch it not matter one iota when the Brotherhood returns. There SHOULD be special voice lines for someone rolling up in full BOS PA paint, but we both know that would take effort and putting in effort isn't what Bethesda is about these days.
---
Nice 😎
---
Gauss Shotgun I guess? Both my Chars would be an option to fight you. Shotguns are underrated in pvp though since they can go over the 110 Damage per Shot cap, but they still stop at 10% Health, wich mean if you have the Power to one shot me, you won't. 
---
__
---
The Heavy Char has arround 600 HP and the highest non bloodied dps weapons imgame (JE Gatling Plasma arround 200 DMG, JFFR LMG 110 DMG and JFFR FLAMETHROWER 170 DMG + Fire damage I don't know) while In Raid Power Armor and an almost perfect build (I'm still unsure on my Intilegence perks).
---
My Comando Char is also an Junkies build in almost full Heavy Assassin Sentinel Leather Set and 400 HP. 
---
He has a JE Laser Rifle, a JFFR Handmade, a JFFR Plasma Rifle, a JFFR Tesla (I hate myself for using this weapon but it's the only way to counter other Tesla player since I can take probably tank more) and a JE Railway. I can also exchange my Torso for a Secret Service one with a Jetpack, or my hole set with an Assassin Sentinel Combat Set. 
---
 I also can get my damage boosted on both chars by 25%/25%/20%/20%/10% with Overdrive, Psychobuff,  Bobble head, Balistic Bock/ High Voltage Hefe and a Magazine wich deals additional 10% to players
---
It's standard to use a Stealth boy for me even though vats is bugged since some weapons still work (Railways and Legacies) and do an awful lot of damage. This combined with a certain perk makes me pretty much a ghost, not being visible on my enemies compass.
---
A little sad you're on PC, since I love to showcase my strength, since I'm really proud of. Some of my buddies are even stronger then me. I would go so far and call them the best PvPers on PS4 (who play without abusing glitches like godmode, unlimited ammo, etc.
---
I can't tell if I would win against you since I don't know your build and your armor, feel free to tell me more if you want.
---
The handmade/fixer advantage is solely the suppressor. I wouldn’t recommend the RWR to anyone who wants to make a sneak build. In terms of non-sneaky dps, it can easily keep pace with the meta rifleman weps though as we reload speed is also pretty solid. And it makes that little choo-choo sound, so that’s automatically a leg up on the other rifles 🚂
---
Yup thats the point of meat week 🤣
---
Imagine if it had trousers
---
Hell yes, I want that game
---
PS4 :) I don't tend to talk a lot about the past, it doesn't help me to dwell, I just want to move on as much as possible but it'd be cool to hang out with others who want to do the same and have some fun.
---
I have a Berserker commando/rifleman, so it's pretty close in goals. Damage mitigation is very important. You aren't eating all the time so why not put in Fireproof and Lifegiver for general running around? Even though it's a full health build, Serendipity has saved me many times when things get rough. Running to safety is a tactic so I use Marathoner and Moving Target to get out of the way.
---
Have a look [here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c7669d&amp;d=sg2pg2ph2pe1pi2pp0eh2ee2c72cm0cu0i10ic4a72ao0a42aa1lt2lu2lg1la2l71&amp;w=&amp;n=commando&amp;m=).
---
Some people use addictions or broken armor so they can use armor with legendary effects or the stealth suit. I tried the armor thing but it's too much hassle when you have to get in PA or don and doff armor, so now I just run around naked.
---
Not just you, there's something weird going on with them for weeks.To me they don't show at all on some servers, I mean instead of a workshop icon it shows a normal location marker. Sometimes it also doesn't show who owns it as well. At least fast travel works.
---
There is a flag, poster, and somthing else i think but it is nothing major but a still limited
---
I think it was a huge mistake that Fallout 4/76 got rid of that feature. My guess is to avoid clipping on certain armors, but it would be perfect if they added it, it is never too late, the much improved NV/3 dialogue system is proof of that.
---
They were once
---
I'm too worried about them noticing me...I've had so many people that attack the moment I'm seen that if they run into my bush I'll usually try to kill them. If I see someone hiding, I will leave them alone though.
---
&gt; In general you may start this quest again and again and again until all scorchbeasts disappeared and you can't get their dna to finish the quest.
---
lol, you don't even need a new SB every time. You can literally just keep harvesting the same SB corpse over and over again (provided it doesn't despawn). There's often a dead SB just outside of Fort Defiance (probably left over from Line in the Sand), so it makes this step super easy.
---
This is why I hoover up all the loose garbage that nobody wants like empty beer bottles.  Means things I *actually* want are more likely to be there when I go back.
---
Oh, I thought you meant Nuclear Winter Build. Unarmed bloodied build in adventure. What can I say, pop a quantum, stealth boy, and start going ape in VATS.
---
Funny how all the dead BoS soldiers wear T-51, yet the BoS paints only apply to T-60.
---
I think it happens because Bethesda intended for that event to take place inside the nuke zone, or at least close to fissure prime. It respawns you where the event should be happening. I don’t like it either, just some explanation.
---
Just take all the weight perks lulz. Idk.
---
I struggle with that too though. When i get to the end of my build, i start running out of useful perks.
---
I think it may be due to the factions of the other group members.  Responders grouping up with raiders doesn’t really make sense.
---
Pls remove the Posidon Power Station repair event. Like seriously. I am soooo goddamn tired of hearing that voiceline every single time i pass near the workshop.
---
Fair i guess. Maybe you could use different skins on them to help tell the difference?
---
Well in Nuclear Winter I run a Comando build, but there it is find a grenade, throw it at your enemy, vats it, kill.
---
Oh hell yeah count me in gamers
---
Hopefully, seems they're starting to release stuff like that again with the Piper pack. Would be a smart move on their part to release another pack around BoS additions.
---
Ditto. Ammo I can't get to move in my vendor goes through that machine in exchange for some 5.56. Still craft most of my 5.56, but any I can get without crafting is good in my book, even if the interface to get it is tedious.
---
Stealth gauntlet berserker's, because being a masochist is always fun.
---
It's like an abusive relationship at this point, we live in hope that things will improve, we listen to bethesdas sweet nothings in our ears that tells us that they are going to fix it and be better. Then patch day comes and they beat us down all over again by breaking more stuff than they fix.
---
I love the world of fallout a lot but sometimes the glaring issues can wear thin on you. Optimisation is desperately needed on this game but I think it's something that is out of reach whether that be due to a bad/old engine or inexperienced developers working on a spaghetti code system.
---
In my honest opinion I think you have to really love the franchise as a whole to be able to look past alot of the issues that the game has and sometimes that isn't enough.
---
I have experienced all the same issues you have stated in your post, not constantly but enough that sometimes it brings me to a point where I put the game down for a while.
---
For clarity for anyone thinking I'm just hating on the game my current hour count is at 2600.
---
I rarely have the issue with the kill lag, and sometimes with textures, but it seems to be more of a server thing. I am on a vanilla PS4 with the disk. Overall doesn’t seem to happen very often.
---
I had same problem, died 2 times in a row before I realized I was able to fast travel on teammate by V9 before the rads killed me.
---
I hit 85 yesterday.
---
Also a bit weird that the promo for the DLC has a T-51 helmet and the rest being T-60
---
good idea
---
JFC! That's awesome! Never saw this glitch before, looks hilarious
---
WHY DOES IT HAVE A LIMIT!?
---
Sometimes I forget to make the event active so it shows up in my top left, then I can’t see which extractors are broken but the second I realize this I immediately make it active and see if they are broken. Not really a huge deal because you can totally tell when one is broken no one needs to tell you, but I imagine some players forget or don’t even know to make it active or even know that those things break. But yeah that’s the attention span of this current generation, can’t even read a couple bullets about the event. They just think kill, loot, xp repeat.
---
Tbh i leave a group when i see nobody is sharing a card.
---
I always repair. Most people just aren’t paying attention.
---
yeah, thanks, but I just don't want to provide all the info, re: rule #8
---
Anybody remember Destiny year 1? When purple engrams could drop blues or greens? That's how this feels.
---
I saw this as a bucket of flamingos. I need sleep
---
Like about 80% of the events that I go to that tends to have the most traffic people are doing whatever they want. About a month before wastelanders came out is when I noticed this. I've popped on mic telling people hey this is what we are supposed to be doing I then either get a thumbs down emote a person replying saying oh well Imma just do whatever or no replies at all. Now do I agree with this stuff no I don't cause they aren't doing what they are supposed to and it ruins the event for other people. Until people stop thinking they can do what ever they want at events it's gonna be crazy to get the best rewards let alone complete it
---
Probably the same people who inboxed me some hate mail over this post haha. But the awesome definitely outweighs the shitty. That is evident.
---
If you buy the Red Rocket prefab from the Atomic Shop, the only place to get it, you get everything you need. The building is under misc. the garage door is under wall, and the side door is under doors.
---
Thx for the heads up
---
Yeah I wish that they would give plans a colour code or something at least.  I mean they have it in nuclear winter after all and there I honestly don’t need a colour code to tell me a gauss shotgun is better than a laser pistol.
---
Let’s stop stroking each other’s egos already, this is going pretty long. Good luck on future matches in Nw mr. “12 kill average”.
---
I’ll be on PS4 if you ever want to go on an adventure!!
---
Edited, thanks. 👍🏻
---
Would love a blue version instead to better match FO3 and FONV
---
Okay melee is the worst in PvP. Both NW and Adventure. Clear win for me, but I think you can get me in NW if you find a Gauss Shotgun. It's always hard to analyze things in NW since it really rng depending.
---
I'm on PC, but I will try and see if it works... appreciate the tip, thanks.
---
I'm not annoying anybody and expecting triple A developers to fix their broken $60 game should be fucking expected from them.
---
I was never able to fast travel to them unless I owned them, or maybe if they were owned by someone in my team.  Now, yes, they are messed up currently - with the wrong icons, no owner shown, and it pretends I can fast travel there but in reality fast travel remains the same: it doesnt let me unless I own it.
---
I've met 0 mean players and have also met no one not willing to help out! I just hit lvl 60 and problem wouldn't have been able to without the tips and supplies of kind high lvl guys
---
I’ll have to try that out. Time to farm perk cards.
---
A level 30 melee character with no buffs at all and only a level 10 BSS sledgehammer can put out almost 3k damage.
---
I said 8 to 12, if on Morgantown. In Flatwoods if have much less contact with enemies.
---
Grats, that was a pain in the ass.
---
I got some hate mail over this but it's pretty evident that the awesome outweighs the shitty,I think this is a microcosm of the human spirit right here. Yeah, you'll run into some toxic, crappy people but you'll also run into lots of people, even more than the former who  either just keep to themselves or are really helpful and altruistic.   
---
Same as in real life.
---
Benderhood of Steel
---
[edit: Bendorhood of Steal*]
---
Yeah, she sounds badass 😁 you make a great team!  I don't have the guts to face the queen with just the two of us, but I'll try to persuade my fiance 😁 He might just carry me all through the quest, but it's good practice 😛
---
We need some sort of identifier. A special “I’m just here for the xp” hat. Last night I was trying to find/use the three stimpacks and kept stressing that someone was going to headshot me before I could lower my health to use them. I just wish I’d had a banner that said something to the effect of please just let me finish the challenge and then I will happily give myself up to you.
---
Oh! Yeh no pressure haha, I’m not the prying kind. Just trying to relay that I empathise! And yeh I don’t talk much about it either. I’m PS4 too! My psn is doublenyx if you do ever want to hang out :)
---
Being a Ghoul is a much needed feature for the Fallout series. 
---
Imagine if Fallout had like a Skyrim race system with custom races with their own perks and downsides. Like Vault Dweller, Ghoul, Synth (Not For 76 Obviously), Wastelander, Child of Atom (As some people have grown immunity to Radiation) 
---
Something giving a little extra depth would be very interesting, would add back some of the RPG elements to the series. I do like the perk card system, but it feels like the mutations are more like perks than the actual perks, I want something to define my character.
---
I always try to help out, but basically I'm there for the score points and nothing else. One time a higher player wanted my power armor and I gave it to him no problem. Another time someone was out of stimpacks, and I dropped mine for them. In both cases they could put it to better use than me. 
---
Then the hacker comes along and one shots each team member anyway. I mean, unless there are guns in the game that will one shot a full health player in power armor?
---
Oooh! Okay. Ty. Would have been awesome if the game let you know where it gets stuck.
---
I much prefer wave like events like line in the sand to escort missions with flimsy idiotic NPCs.
---
We need less escort missions and more wave type events where we Just have fun and kill stuff that shows up.
---
Oh for sure!!
---
I helped some out with building them a roof and gave them a couple of serums next thing I know I have people sending me friend requests that I never even met in game, I accept 1 they showed up and instantly asked me to build them a rad shower I asked him why did he think I would do that and he told me that the person I had built the roof for had put my name on a Facebook page that lists people who will help out low level players I was like wtf
---
When I was low level I just did whatever quest was in my area and didn’t worry about chasing them across the map. I took my time on things like excavator too because you have to get a good amount of whatever rare metal to make them. Just enjoy the early game and play it at a slow pace doing whatever is around you first
---
For some reason, I just never get TDs to drop out of anything anymore xd
---
Build a small 4x4 foundation out of concrete blocks. Put one of the platform stairs on the back corner. Place a waypoint rug on top of the platform. Ring the bottom foundation and the top platform with turrets.
---
Blueprint it.
---
Now, every time you take a workshop, you can use the *workshop's* inventory to instantly plop down one of these constructs. Your turrets will do most of the heavy lifting during defense/retake events and, on rare occasions they can solo the event for you even when youre not there. You still get the items/xp for completion.
---
When you Tp to the workshop, you will be landing on top of your convenient *elevated* sniper platform right where you placed your handy TP welcome mat.
---
^(\[edit\])
---
^(The waypoint welcome mat is in misc structures tab and can only be built in workshops.)
---
I think both events benefits both ends of the player base (High and low levels).
---
2x Score weekend: I gained 2 character levels and more than 12 ranks on the legendary run, mainly just doing dailys plus the repeatable XP bonus.
---
2x XP: gained 3 character levels and 3-4 legendary run levels.
---
I’m over L200, so only getting extra XP doesn’t really make much difference.   2x XP is a great benefit to lower level players to help them level up faster (and achieve the repeatable XP score bonus), 
---
2x score benefits higher level players more than lower levels, by helping them advance farther down the legendary run faster.
---
maybe a headshot with a hunting rifle with rifleman perk on? i couldn’t tell you, personally. Sounds super fun tho
---
Thx, so I have a lot of time to finish the season without buying any ranks for Atoms, especially now, when they've added so many daily challenges each day.
---
Yep. I’m absolute dogshit at the mode but I’m level 108 or something from sitting in a bush and running an afk script
---
What are the rare drops?
---
47 and still not ahead.  
---
I missed the first 5-6 days of the event and never do the nw events.  ive missed a few dailies here and there since, but not many.
---
Maybe they are trying to get some of the people that they regularly play with on a team with them first.
---
my wife said it took the sims like 20 years to be able to create stairs that wrap around a corner wall. i wonder how long it would take fallout..... most likely never but it would be an awesome feature tho to save space. I dont know how we didn't get a better version of stairs after buying that contemporary building package for like a bunch of atoms. the entire house looks great then you go inside to find shifty steel foundry stairs and a hole in the 2nd story lol. it looks like crap bethesda.
---
You can place foundations underwater there. Use some stairs to come up above water and build from there!
---
Stealthy Rifleman with a shotgun when I'm getting overrun. Currently level 43 and not sure what the best gun type I should be using. I currently have a .45 hunter rifle that is anti-armor.
---
Yep, I am only at 46 and I am not sweating it at all.
---
Keep in mind OP the respecing system is a little... shit, so make sure you are confident in what you want, I made a mistake and have to level up 37 more times to get a whole new build, don't make my mistake.
---
I just started playing last week, and some kind soul helped me out; let me finish some high level kills, gave me a bunch of gear.
---
Not to high jack your post. But I’ll add that it’s SO refreshing to play a game where everyone isn’t a complete asshole to one another (COD comes to mind).
---
Edit: feel free to add me on PS4! @bunnylikestoeat
---
I reached lvl 100 in NW and it was dreadfully the same during that grind. Same players in each matches loading into the same locations searching for the same weapons to use on the same map. I got 100 lvls in a month and got all the rewards and completed all the challenges and gave it up. I come back 7 months later to do the SCORE challenges and it’s still the same players dropping into the same locations trying to get the same gun all on the same old map, but now they’re all level 300-400+ I believe one or two may be 500+ on NW
---
Ah, so you are a Mire Lurker now.
---
They actually got rid of it? I thought they just kind of stopped putting out updates. That sucks.
---
my favorite servers.  Id even dontate my nuke cards to them.
---
just google Todd Bethesda... the expressionless photo will explain everything
---
I experienced those three issues when I played 76 on my shite home internet with 700 ping. All three of those issues go away if you play on better internet, went away for me when I started using my phone hotspot rather than home internet.
---
Pipe bolt hands down. It’s not even close because of accuracy.
---
Neat! I never knew about that. Even if Bethesda was trying to stop stacking foundations I still Figured out how to do so.
---
Try the Charleston Capitol Building, it's brimming full of ghouls, and I never see any other players in there. Remember, more enemies = more chances of legendary enemies.
---
At least the option of having variation of the TV to play old broadcasts would be neat, if radios can exist then I am sure TVs could work.
---
Guilty. Nice mansion though. What a view.
---
I have a two shot exploding hunting rifle, and it is awesome.  I converted to the 50 cal, and have a long recon scope.  Aiming down sights, most things go down in one or two trigger pulls.  Plus you can be far enough away that you may not alert everyone else in the area.  You do want gunsmith of 5.  That thing breaks so quickly.
---
To me it sums up Fallout 76.  A great idea hampered by poor execution.  Sometimes, I will log on not to play the game, but to catch up on all of the tedious little details (like converting ammo) that the game makes you go through.
---
It's a visual bug. Traveling to it is still free
---
For sure the most important take away here
---
Is that BoS Sentinel paint? Thats sick
---
True, but this applies without the counterpart, marsupial, in the normal mode, and the penalty in nuclear winter, going by what you’re saying since I don’t have enough agility to use that perk, still doesn’t consume ap.
---
My guess: They want a bonus but also play solo.
---
Yeah, it does break fast. It's a shame because I have a Bloodied with exploding bullets and it breaks relatively quickly, especially compared to the bloodied Gatling laser.
---
It sucks, but I like the weapon overall.
---
well they're based on LMG 42s so....it's to be expected from them
---
Agreed
---
&gt; I'm not annoying anybody 
---
q.e.d
---
&gt; and expecting triple A developers to fix their broken $60 game should be fucking expected from them.
---
On that I agree with you, still reddit is the worst place to do it. Even paging the CMs here does nothing.
---
This is amazing
---
I was just going based off of how I got them. I got 2 leather coats before I got a traveling leather, and so far in trading the traveling leather seems to hold a lot more value. Statistics are for nerds 😂 jk
---
Of course. German squads used to carry thousands of rounds of ammo &amp; up to a half dozen replacement barrels...it was a trade off. Enormous potential for down-range damage, but quite the ammo-hog.
---
What door do you use? I've recently moved camp and instead of one big house I put 3 small one. I hate how allies and vendors go into my private little house, always leaving the door open when they go out.. really annoying indeed. Will putting a lock on it help? I'd rather not tho, because I don't mind players coming in.
---
Get a sloth, then regret your choice to get a sloth.
---
Fuck the BOS
---
I'm trying to refine my heavy weapons build for when I get a gauss minigun. My build is an absolute mess right now, and I really, REALLY want the gauss minigun.
---
At the rate of ES6, we are testing a game not due for another 10 years lol
---
To be honest, I price all my plans at 1c each - unless it's a drop from an event (like the BlueRidge caravan plans or the Fixer Plan), it's just not worth pricing it higher than that.
---
They change icons when you hop a new server. In order to keep the regular icons you have to restart the game. Idk if it's a bug or intentional to hide who owns it and minimize pvp.
---
Or just run West Tek.
---
Yeah, I would hate concentrated fire.  I usually share travel agent, lucky break, or lucky draw.  Who doesn't want to save caps or have their gear fix itself?
---
Wow, you're sure showing them who's the boss! I'm certain they're totally distraught after spending a few  bullets to get an effortless frag who was too badass to fight back.
---
Naw. No camp is going to better than mine.
---
Sounds like a great way to measure stuff, I have no idea just kind a build and hope it all fits.
---
Awe! ❤️
---
There is plenty of info in game why the water and ground is what it is. I am not putting up spoilers.
---
Soooo many flamingos. 😂
---
Or just better refrigeration in general. All my food comes from meat because I use carnivore, so it's easy to keep my belly full... But when I build I'm constantly hangry. If I spend 10 minutes gathering ingredients for my gourmet stew I don't want that shit to spoil if I'm not ready to eat it.
---
HA! I had this exact same though last night. 
---
It's usually some basic wooden monstrosity and i'm like 'TUT!'
---
I would still like to be given "POINTS" from quests to use at the station. rather than just getting random ammo dumped on me. I mean if I don't have to exchange the ammo my self it's not that bad I think?
---
Awesome photo and congrats. Nuke runs are a lot of fun.
---
My main build is a shutgun/rifleman build, with a shit ton of carry weight. main guns are Instigating Shotgun, Medics Handmade and Mutant Slayers The Fixer
---
for SBQ fights i will switch it over to Heavy Guns, i love my Zealots 50 cal and now trying a gatling gun just to compare
---
Stealth commando on my main for highest DPS, PA/Heavy guns/Melee/Shotguns on my alt to try out different builds. I can also do gunslinger/guerilla on my main
---
Coffee is manly koolaid
---
Bloodied unarmed stealth. Love those super quick queen kills. Hitting her for like 30k+ damage a swing without exploits is awesome.
---
I like to change my group depending on what I'm doing, I also worry I'll get booted when I do my own thing so that def plays a part. Some times I'll join a group especially if a friend is in it but typically I just make my own.
---
Had a  kid saying something about a 700+ damage deathclaws he was rocking. I attack him, he one shots me. Throw in my armour, retry and wreck him. Can't beat my 50 boi
---
Apparently I had to repair his gauntlet.... I didnt
---
That’s why I don’t wait to look. The sadness.
---
True I forgot about the well.
---
Yes, I take a look for some inspiration.
---
I've gone there, seen more than enough people to do the event and tabbed out. No need to take the XP of the low level enemies from the lower level players doing the event.
---
You can block a player on the server before leaving to ensure you won't be put in that server, at least on xbox.
---
Nope it's all tesla one you pop a stealth boy and jetpack. You better have millions of colas, mags, chems, and bobble heads too. The duping wrecked pvp.
---
Your perk card never had to match the stat increase as you leveled up.  Yes you can get all the perks at all the levels but takes about 300+ levels.
---
I have done both: respeccing an existing and creating new ones.
---
I would recommend starting a new one. It is more work but in the end you'll be able to choose between two different playstyles, have double scrip limit, have double bullion limit, have double cap limit, can transfer stuff, ...   
---
Plus personnally, I like that a new character has a bit more difficulty in the beginning. Makes the game difficult again. You can revisit old quests and such. 
---
An other advantage of an extra character is the legendary perk system that is coming. Because low levels are reached easily, you'll gain more extra perk cards to exchange for legendary perk points when that new game mechanic finally comes out.
---
Nope.
---
still kinda fun sometimes though, just wish it had a bigger or better team behind it.
---
the shitty launch just kinda killed all momentum the game had, but it’s definitely been salvaged a lot since then.
---
yeah. I usually have little problem finding legendaries on public servers but yesterday was really weird. all the places I usually got them spawned only diseased versions of these NPCs. I also do Uranium fever for that, usually works, but something was off. All the legendaries just instantly died even tho there were no players around (not invisible ones either). Had to switch to private server and do it alone. It's a shame tho, what about people who don't have FO1st.. Not saying the challenge itself is that difficult, but I agree with OP, at least make them spawn faster or spawn where they're supposed to
---
I didn't downvote you lol I just gave an example of not poop waves
---
m8, that’s the million dolar question.
---
an exemple: the ski sword skate blade mod, the yellow box, is very commom. you find them all the time while roaming appalachia. 
---
it’s a mod that is not powerful, for a very lame weapon. nobody cares much or uses this weapon. but the plan to craft this mod is very rare. it can sell for 15-20k in the market. maybe more. 
---
only playing a lot, and I mean A FUCKTON LOT, you’ll learn the market price for most plans. 
---
I was trying to sell the plan for BOS mod for combat armor. back in the day it was an uncommon drop. I was trying to sell it for 1k caps. than I saw it for sale in a robot vendor at a train station for 100 caps 😂
---
God I miss survival so much. Using team work to instigate a fight and the other 3 members are at the enemy base calling in an artillery strike
---
Just wait, this world has it's share of bad apples too.
---
Okay hahaha my game is good now
---
Definitely considering the amount of time put into my camps. Lol
---
I built my girls camp for her too and there is always some very sad wooden box or just the camp and the sign from the first wastelanders missions. 
---
She has a nice 2 story house with a bridge crossing the creek and a building for her shop called Crick-Side Sundries. Just up the road from the Wayeard across from the Slocum Joe's. To be expected, but still a letdown.
---
I was talking with her one day in my camp. I did a quick teleport to some place across the map. I'm usually stationed around thunder mountain, around the lake. She then went on a quest to get back to my camp from I believe the water treatment plant. Followed her for about half the trip.
---
This exactly.
---
Kudos
---
I just hate the low level players who try to take what you're dropping for your partner. If I wanted to give you something, I'd call you over! Don't be a loot bag squatter.
---
Are you on ps4? I have a good bloodied automatic rifle and I run a non-bloodied heavy weapons build looking for some other decent heavy weapons.
---
I would make a fair trade and we could use a middleman of your choice to help us out.
---
Different regions have different issues. I pay for gigabit internet. All my streaming services work great. All of my devices download and upload quickly. PlayStation network is horrible for me. And of all the games I play, fallout 76 has the worst stability. I have 4200 hours in this game. The first few hundred where the worst. After time , for some reason , it started running better and better. Sometimes after an update it will get better or worse for awhile. I have many friends that play, and I have experienced far less bugs than many of them in overall lifespan of the game up until present. I live in America, but play with friends in the U.K. , we've noticed bugs that I will get for weeks or months , that they may have never got. But when the bug has passed and nearly forgotten to me, a friend will then say" remember that bug you had that you were bitching about, now I got it" . The code is so strange and unpredictable.
---
like the Atom Cats?
---
Cooking stations?...
---
Make sure you are toggling on the “only doable recipes” button. It takes no time. 
---
Unless you are talking about the animation to get on and off?
---
Well kind of....
---
It isn't though, I've got 2000 hours in the game, there comes a point where the shitty kind of dominates. I'm not trying to ruin the love train you've got going on, but there are a ton of super-toxic players in the late game.   
---
There are still awesome people in this community but you're also setting those who are going to run into the worst the community has to offer for a serious surprise.
---
I've noticed a difference in sneaking from server to server when hopping. Makes me wonder if some servers get missed on the updates
---
I would like to think that too, but the longer we deal with Bethesda the more I think nothing is out of the question.
---
All I know is my personal experience. Bought the game in Beta. Played maybe 3 months. Shit was nearly unplayable with all the crashes and glitches. Finally just rage quit. Heard wastelanders was pretty good. Came back and everything seems stable for the most part. My only real complaint about the entire game at this point is the level designs sometimes give me motion sickness. I think it's because all the walls are so close together. But beyond that shits running pretty good now.
---
On PC.
---
I totally agree! I’d like something fancier then brown peg board
---
I would have taken it, my loot now. I need steel and lead
---
Absolutely
---
Looking for rocking people like teds and rockabillys playing this game. I was j6st wondering, are there any other teds thsn me
---
“my camp couldnt be placed because of THIS?”
---
I get that, but you can still help collect ingredients and repair machinery. At least then you're contributing, without stealing XP
---
Happened to me a few times. My turrets were shooting somewhere non-stop and she started to shoot in the same direction and they just wouldn't stop. I thought I was going crazy and don't see a big ass enemy because they were fighting (through the wall!!) for 5 minutes.. I just removed turrets and Sophia and then rebuild them.
---
I do love the Elder paint. [It looks pretty kick ass.](https://i.imgur.com/qHjNTik.jpg)
---
i think so, or it's less effective today
---
It was one of my favorites for a long while, I had all my workshop stuff under the pylon and it was awesome. Now I’m guessing the raiders prevent building under that arch, which makes me a little bit sad.
---
100%
---
This, line in the sand and radiation rumble are some of my favourite events.
---
Bloodied Sneak Melee. It’s fun but slow, and I get to use a variety of weapons. My favorite is an instigating SS combat knife.
---
i remember being in a team with my friends getting 1, 2 and 3 then hunkering down in our camp for a siege... those were the days
---
And my friend lost hes girl for play fallout all the time
---
Perhaps they’ll be adding more paints down the road?
---
I know its a joke but I did see an addon that gave the budget number values and percentages that could help out if you're looking for that sort of thing.
---
even something as simple as a vertical display board would be welcomed.
---
The measure using flamingos sounds like such an American way to measure things since we tend to measure everything in units except the ones that actually make sense. I love it. I need a guide of how much everything is in terms of flamingos that way when I show off my camp and I can be like, this is my kitchen, it cost me X amount of flamingos.
---
I only spent atoms on one lvl that granted atoms, so basically I didn't spend any atoms, lol
---
Yeah we've been getting a ton of legendary ghouls there as well lately.  Nice event for sure.  I do miss the mutants though.
---
Exactly! Without style, art and culture, what are we fighting for? What are we trying to rebuild!!!
---
Oh no, that's too sad 😣
---
Honestly? I like it, gives more depth to the raiders and shows that while they can be somewhat nice, are still rotten and evil inside.
---
The covered bridge, right before you get to the Overseer's camp. Truck in the covered bridge, were the bodies are even wearing the right clothes.
---
I do that too not with the newbies but on events. And ı was curious about spoiler 😂 u got me there
---
Actually, I think they did. They just hate people and their time.
---
It's the Settlers that have this though...
---
ita a crosshair.. not a celtic cross...
---
That's all I did my whole leave from work during this pandemic was start Fallout 76 that here I am level 120 now
---
You'd think if they came up with a way to streamline crafting, it could be less taxing on their servers as well. Players win, back-end wins...
---
Lvl 63 or something, so he's behind for a few lvls. Does it even matter if we pass him? Just curious, I read about the legendary run, but I'm not sure it said something about Zorbo that much
---
It's written in blood...by the raiders. Why would they write "you must die" on their own walls?
---
Edit: would be nice to see some settlers clean that up tho instead of b1tch1ng about their day and not doing anything
---
Dude,same!!!!
---
We'd have our camps literally next to each other, built up for one hell of a fight. Southern part of the map has spots where it's just straight cliffs on one side and no spawns in the other, so you only have 2 directions to come from. But the closest warp spot was on one side unless you wanted to spend the extra time to run the cliff.
---
Bring back survival!!!
---
Yep! I would want a nice clean place and good displays for my collectibles and weapons. :)
---
1) the settlers didn’t make that if you follow the lore
---
2) the cross is different
---
I always figured it was the Raiders that did those messages.
---
That would be nice as well.
---
Guess we’re going to have to get rid of all the guns with crosshairs now...
---
This community is trully spactacular! This game brings so much good from casual gamers. Makes me believe we could trully rebuild the world with kindness after catastrophy. Thanks guys
---
I actually liked the interface. I toyed with it, after reading the complaints to see if they were legit. Man, the time you dump for what you get is insanely disproportionate.
---
You are looking too hard for stuff that isn't there if you don't recognize crosshairs when you see them. I mean, you see one every time you aim a gun in this game, so it should be familiar.
---
I'd trust angry turtle with my first born. The dude knows his stuff. He probably knows more about it than Bethesda does.
---
Man I feel enlightened
---
Having worked around many different gangs including white supremacy groups if you tried to pass those cross hairs as an Odins cross you’d be getting a beat down. They are very particular about signs and symbols.
---
yes and no. IF the primal cuts event is completed to the highest tier, you get a piece of combat armor. Can't remember one star or two star but definitely not 3 star. Getting highest tier wasn't easy though, that's probably why some people here say there are no legendary rewards.
---
I have to admit I have never heard of this event. (325 hours of game time) 😂. I'll try it tonight, thanks
---
Np, hope it works for you bud.
---
Both of us too! I left the game a few months after release and only came back last April and I was level 30 something.. Now, I'm level 189 😄
---
i can’t believe the cut the servers for more nuclear winter, when nuclear winter doesn’t even work right and is mostly hackers. that’s what killed the game for me imo. bring back survival, down with nuclear winter.
---
I am 45 level and same thing happens to me ı love people being so nice. Mostly they gave plans to me and ı learn everything then sell the things ı already knew for 1 cap for anyone who needs them. I think they gave because they are overcumbered too.
---
And for overcumbered ı have mursipual and speed demon serum ıts a bit better till ı gave up some unnecessary things
---
Yes, its spawns you there because this is where the actual fight is suppose to be, so it's your choice and you can change it when fighting the SBQ.  Put on a set of PA, this is something that actually works like it's supposed to.
---
Edit:  99% of the time I run Unyielding, 1% PA only against the SBQ.
---
Even their map icons keep changing, sometimes I see the usual stars, sometimes I see regular blue icons like for pretty much everything else - without any of the usual workshop info popup.....
---
Happens to me too. I can imagine some people don’t bother activating the notifications.
---
It's ok, 76 is still in its early beta stage.
---
(Your C.A.M.P. cannot be placed...)
---
Not the point of this post. But thanks for being ridiculous in response to my genuine questions
---
I would do crushing all day long
---
I just did it with a couple of guys and was impressed by how many ghouls there were. I was constantly taking vats shots or reloading my lever action the whole time. Added bonus was 5 or 6 legendaries, but all complete garbage.
---
We need automatic closing doors. I had a mod for that in 4.
---
I’m not clear on what is lagging about the process.
---
Get on bench to craft menu&gt;select item&gt;craft from category&gt;done. I must be misunderstanding the issue
---
I guess this is more an answer I was looking for. So you're saying the shape is too off?
---
Nothing that a few drops of WD40 cant fix........
---
Lol no
---
Underrated event here.
---
Is that why? Those bastards!
---
I just got back into the game and was like "where TF is survival?" Figured people complained so much it was taken down. Me isn't bad, I enjoy going on it, but I'm on PS4 so I don't think there are hackers, or many hackers anyways. Wish they'd out solos on it though, would definitely make it better.
---
But they definitely need to bring survival back, that was the best mode. I miss the feeling of hunting and being hunted. Or if I was just farming, having that oh shit oh shit, I hear someone else in here lmao
---
It is because of people like you that we lost the OK sign to Nazis... Dumb!
---
I’m at like 115 and still haven’t launched the nuke. Which guns and how much ammo did u use? 
---
Also anyone on Xbox wanna try ?
---
That makes sense, I was given at level 4 100 recipes and that started my addiction of finding every plan I can. I try to keep my prices VERY low I don't sell for 1 :/ Now I feel bad.
---
EDIT:
---
I have about 3k Junk I keep with me because of pack rat and 10k Ammo due to bandiler because can't store it
---
No weapons, clothes, or even much aid in my box. lol .. about 400 pounds of junk.
---
Melee tank. Was two handed, in the process of switching to unarmed...
---
Because for some reason unarmed is just the superior melee option.
---
That's a popular spot, my camp is there and 90% of the time I have to server hop to get mine to place. But I usually don't look what's there first, as it's quicker to just hit find a new world than to quit back to the menu and rejoin from there.
---
This right here. I used the bushes a lot when I first started just to get used to everything (NW was my first BR experience), and I still do, but when I'm grouped with a team that actually works together, I'm game! I try to spawn in with them and work with them as best I can by following their lead, contributing extra ammo I don't need, and donating nuke cards if one has found a briefcase (only happened once so far, but it was amazing not being on the receiving end!). I'm still really terrible, but I enjoy it anyway, which is crazy and unexpected, tbh.
---
Thanks for asking this question, I've been too lazy to read up on how groups actually work, after reading through the comments I have come to realize I didn't understand most of the team mechanics.
---
Congrats, now do it again.
---
If it's something you like then blow the caps. I don't know how many times I've bought things I'll never even use just to get rid of caps. And I don't even run my own player vending. There are way too many damn limits in this game. Pickaxe plan, sure. Santa crashing through a building, sure. Shadowed whatever armor plan, sure. Now I know of another plan to blow caps on. Thanks.
---
Hit a spot with junk and lead, might move to the one with lead and acid though
---
This sounds like work! Bethesda don't do work.
---
All of what you said plus it gives you a chance at winning the savage divide lottery.
---
EVERYTHING IS RACIST!!!! AAAAAHHHH I CAN'T LIVE IN THIS RACIST WORLD I DEMAND SOMEONE CONTACT ALIENS AND HAVE THEM MOVE ME TO A SAFE WORLD WHERE NO RACISM EXISTS!!!
---
Its free real estate.
---
Close this thread and be done with it. Now cross hairs pictures are triggering snow flakes.
---
im a PA and i dont die and do alot of damage with a gatling gun i habe or a gauss minigun i got
---
A search feature in the build mode would be lovely.
---
I misunderstood. Thanks for telling me
---
I like this one: I don't have any caps but can you give me five different mutation serums?  Pick one.
---
Shotgun + Chinese Armour with sneak perks. I can walk around invisible and sneak attack with 2.5x damage on my double barrel for ~ 525 dmg. Can literally just walk through Blast Zones without being bothered
---
Side note: The gatling plasma looks like what I imagine they use to circumsize people in the Congo
---
This is broken.
---
I want to do that, but I want a new skin for my PA
---
Something just happened with me in-game with people that made some similar issues worse :(
---
Yes. If you go out looking to be offended you will find a way to succeed.
---
While I love to give care packages to new players I also don't want to give them so much it ruins the experience of finding things for themselves. Ammo  and maybe 15 or so stims/radaway are what I tend to give.
---
whenever I try to check out the camp there is never a camp there, but always one in a nearby location that doesn't touch the area my camp used. It would be nice if you could build next to someone as long as the circles don't overlap, but there is a no build area around the camps
---
It isn't genuine, it's just stupid.  Even if it was a swastika, maybe they put it there for a reason and they themselves aren't racist.  People go walking around with hammer and sickle shirts... communism has been far more racist than any other ideology, do you do anything about that?
---
this is why i only drop small amounts of stuff. like 10 sims 5 radaway and 5 rad-x. If someone wants to sell them i'm fine with that.
---
Here it is. I don't think everything is on it tho.
---
To add to what angrysunbird said, past 300 or so DR/ER you don't get enough benefit from more DR/ER against NPCs compared to other boosts to your defenses/healing. With a full Buttressed SS set, or pretty much any PA, with no perks you will hit this number easily so you want to get the % reductions such as Dodgy (+ AP Refresh bonuses on gear and Action Girl/Boy), Serendipity/Emergency Protocols, TS/Exterm/GS/Zealot's/Assassin's (for PvP) + Cavalier/Sentinel armor, etc.
---
Troubleshooters is amazing for Encryptid, nuke silos, and many of the tougher robot enemies in the Bog/Mire (AWOL Armaments, RobCo office, etc). You never have to stim and Assaultrons, one of the deadliest enemies in the game, are made trivial.
---
Exterminator's and Zealot's are probably the only one others I'd get since Mirelurk Kings can be so sneaky and deadly – and I think the effect works against their poison damage – and Scorchbeast Queen can 3 shot you on the ground if you aren't running Blocker or PA.
---
Some good old wooden gun racks for rifles would be slick and maybe an open vertical weapon locker with some slots for grenade. Surely not that difficult to implement. 
---
Still waiting on those armour mannequins too!
---
Bummer. That sucks....hope it gets better and it sounds like you have more time to catch up as comment on here says early sept is last date
---
Ha, we keep hearing about how nice this community is, just to find out it’s actually stash space limit :)
---
Talk about it mostly
---
The FO76 community is a pretty awesome community. I’ve met some wonderful people in the game. I play on PC and many of the people I’ve ran with have been very nice and enjoyable. It’s always good to see more kind people who just want to enjoy the game and make it fun for others as well.
---
As a melee player I really can't stand how spaced out the meditation loudspeakers are. I can stick close to where the ghouls spawn before they run off in every direction, but they're so dead-set on attacking the speakers I inevitably have to chase down any stragglers I didn't get a smack in on when they spawned.
---
Now you wear your totally awesome ghillie suit collection while playing the Scorch Beast Queen slot machine. Enjoy.
---
Camp budget in a nutshell.
---
Yes! Armor displays are definitely needed. Those and PA ones. Just hopefully not at the cost of half my camp budget. I am guessing Bethesda might be waiting on those after some changes to camps and camp budgets.

---
That's my full health pa heavy gunner build. I run vamps most of the time and j for big fights. It would work just as well for your aae.
---
I've been running this build for 200 odd levels now and found it to be quite nice. You can sub demo expert for a bit more damage but I have not found it necessary with my explosive plasmas
---
yes yes yes! Why play the game if I have everything..
---
I'm not looking to be offended. Moreso questioning whether the intention was white supremacy. But thanks for the advice
---
Edit: and whether it matters if the intentions were innocent or not, because the symbol is close enough to be misconstrued. But yes, I'm being *too sensitive* *liberal snowflake* I should stop questioning my reality and obey.
---
made a really rough version to see what that would look like oof [https://i.imgur.com/O8SK1Ei.png](https://i.imgur.com/O8SK1Ei.png)
---
Be patient i hear in a upcoming patch we are getting instanced housing and one of the datamined items is a exterior vault door
---
Funny enough I do play warzone, and apex legends all casually.  I can literally flip flop between and never worry about missing a day because of how well the passes are built.  Weeklys don't dissappear in those games either.  
---
When I say casually I mean I legit play them maybe three times a week for 3 hour sessions. I still finish the passes with literally more than a month left. 
---
With fallout? You need to play every day without missing any score challenges if you want to have about ~2-3 weeks of not having to play. Now again thats every day. 
---
I never said the pass was difficult at all. I said it could be better. If your argument is it can't be better than we simply disagree. If you're comparing this pass to the other passes you're gonna have a hard time because the other passes are a lot better with more quality content.
---
3 - it was an error. They did this with the new roof set, and then reverted it (causing me and likely many others to go over budget).
---
Is there a way to access your screenshots from XBox/PS4 on your PC?  Maybe by logging into Microsoft account.  I would like to share some of mine but not sure how unless I take a phone screenshot of a screenshot.
---
Maybe they don't have 10 steel on them to repair them?
---
When I do it we rarely have to repair them though cause the mole miners are dying so fast.
---
But I do not carry scrap on me I keep my scrap on my mule account so If I need scrap to repair something during the even I would actually have to gather up enough stuff for scrapping steel , scrap it, then get over to the extractor.
---
But seriously not a lot of people carry around scrap and its 10 steel to fix them...
---
Melee bc i was tired of worrying about ammo and lose it in the worst moments
---
Doing it rn! :)
---
Totally agree. If I have something to trade it’s in the vending machine.
---
I’d love to try on Xbox. I’m currently lvl 48 and just finished the gold vault mission.
---
I don't think they'll do this for 76 but maybe the next fallout game? Id definitely love the option of human, synth, ghoul, or super mutant. Maybe mole miner? But at least add ghoul and synth since they arent that far off from the human model. I love the idea of racial buffs/debuffs! While I doubt theyd do this imagine playing a ghoul that after enough radiation they glow, and instead of radiation damage lowering health maybe it just aggros everything so you cant hide? I dunno there's just a lot of fun directions you could go. I also want to just run around as a super mutant beating the shit out of everything.
---
Haha you should chill 😅 well ı think nobody buys plans over 20 caps and ı need to get rid of them fast no need to keep them. When its 1 cap people actually buy ı even made some 0 cap because they re basic.
---
I was keeping junk too but unfortunately ı lost them all ı was carrying them all and ı died and the game disconnected. But ı think ıt was good thing because ı just find the things i need them when i need them
---
You should make some priority for u then get rid of some whatever you weighted the most
---
You got a point. I am always able to repair them, even though I don’t have any steel on me. But maybe that’s not the case for others
---
I hope so! Been hoarding so many outfits for too long lol.
---
Limit??
---
It sounds like you're not using it properly: a .45 msg with a Scorched Killer's Receiver carried me all the way to level 250
---
hahaha I go to the hideaway and drop a bag of random "whatever" Random pre-packaged food and ammo (though found out 38 has no weight)   
---
though yesterday I had 18 missiles and 3 mini-nukes for some reason and dropped that, and some under 10 player picked it up. I smiled and knew they would be dropping it soon enough.
---
I got a 1\* bloodied lead pipe as well and I make it a point to wipe low level trash with it. Sure it sucks compared to everything else bloodied, but it's still bloodied. &gt;.&lt;;
---
Sounds awesome. Got any links you can share?
---
Lol fo76=Work
---
Even with a scrapbox, I have an ever growing stash and my carry weight starts creeping up. I don't ever have hundreds of stimpaks, but I do end up with hundreds of Radaway, plans, and purified water.
---
So, yes, I seek out low levels (even better in groups) and dump hundreds of water, Radaway, misc aid and ammo, and excess plans to dry to reduce my weight. Am I being charitable? Or am I using low levels as a dumpster? Yes to both, tbh.
---
I make sure they're at least looking through the bag so they get it, and then I fast travel out and onward. I've had them run and I've come back to see the bag still there later. As much as I'm getting rid of stuff, I like to at least make sure the recipient gets it.

---
That's actually a really good point. Why am I given useless ammo? It won't be hard to calculate what ammo I use the most. Or just skip the middle man and give points like you said
---
That makes sense. Like you, I don’t do an alt so if I had it would’ve been even crazier the ranking up last weekend. Not sure why my experience was so different but radiation rumble was much more happenin last weekend on the servers so maybe that contributed, I’m probably an outlier.
---
At fissure sites and down in the burrows I've definitely noticed some issues with stealth.  Any other areas I haven't noticed any changes. 
---
Running full unyielding and maxed stealth perks.

Just do what you want with it. If you can't use it or don't want it, sell it or give it away.

I've had a hard time getting legendaries from events, but and I may regret sharing, a legendary sheepsquatch regularly spawns up the hill from the train station in Welch. It's a encounter that spawns a whole bunch of different fights, and I just server hop til I find the sheepsquatch.
---
68 on main account and 48 on alt, been one hell of a grind
---
I do it when the only open teams have 3 people, because I play with my gf and need at least 2 open spots.
---
Met my boyfriend on fallout 76 during quarantine and now we're making plans and having adventures irl💞
---
While I remain hopeful that we will see it, we're already pretty far down the road and there is no sign of it happening.
---
It sounds like those other players were actively communicating with you and trying to play as a team, but you were ignoring them due to being overseasoned. Your teammates may not "run off and die" as often if you learn to play support
---
Good work! I eventually changed over to a sneak build so I could run Silos without wasting much ammo. Works well, but you have to have Agility Maxed out for the sneak perks, so not for everyone.
---
For someone who really just wants to do his challenges I feel you could you imagine being level 150 or something i think this post would be alot more attention grabbing if you were level 150 and it took like 2 hours to level thats absurd to have as a daily.
---
I guess it could be because they want you to have budget left after placing the building.
---
Hey feel free to join our small discord. Theres a lpt of help, just ask questions, along with event runners, vendors and more. https://discord.gg/nc2AfV

I sport the Green Hood and Green Bandana with the hunter's long coat. They look great together.
---
The BoS paints in the game don't even match the BoS rank structure in the timeline. They would just be compounding the error of just copy+pasting the fallout 4 rank structure into the game by doing this.

Shhh don't question it, the garage being light on the budget is a godsend
---
Is there a way to turn in more tech data than once? I have so many extra and it’s annoying I can’t turn it im
---
Some of the gift giving does seem a bit condescending for low level players who a probably experienced gamers just trying out a new game (or new runs by people with other characters). 
---
Honestly I think the better thing to do is help out if you see them in a fight they can’t win, or help with events like one violent night
---
Well then why are they telling everyone to wear a mask? Why do they say it will protect you when No it actually wont, because if your wearing a mask for it, that means its airborne and if its airborne a flimsy piece of cloth is not going to do diddly or squat. 
---
The only thing a flimsy piece of cloth will do is catch your sneeze if YOU sneeze.
---
It’s broken because it’s becoming a larger and larger problem as more items get added. 
---
Asking for this to be fixed doesn’t mean something else isn’t going to get fixed. 
---
All your doing us putting your personal interests first in what you want fixed. I’m just pointing out a problem that needs addressing.
---
More so, I bet this fix would be easier. And is definitely a QoL thing.

Aw, that's really lovely! Fallout playing matchmaker to a lot of people 😁 I wish you all the best and hope your plans come into fruition 💕

My girlfriend and I did the same thing when we first got together. We were in different states for the first 8 months of our relationship, so we played a bunch of online games together to bridge the gap. Mostly 76 tho.

Leader of the pack. Done. Uranium Fever. Done. AWOL. Done. Many events have guarantee legendaries.
---
And as for nuclear winter, I'm going to say this like I've said on the bunch of posts before just start a new character. for both The adventure level ups and nuclear winter level ups it is very easy to go from 0 to 1 than it is to go from 99 to 100.
---
If Powered doors would let me use Wallpaper on them I would use that. It really makes no sense why they cant have wallpaper applied to them. Also sucks that they take up SO MUCH more space than regular doors by themselves. AND need at least a pressure pad, and 2 power connectors minimum to work.
---
How do you see camp budget values for objects?
---
From this day fourth all camp items shall now be measured in flamingoes
---
Depending on the plans (food plans never over 20) but weapons plans and building plans (that are metal bed or chem station) can be big ticket items.
---
White spring cottages, or uranium fever.

Not 100% sure why, but this gun has basically been a VATS One Shot weapon. I can shoot something point blank three or four times before it finally goes down, or I can hit VATS and shoot at the same time and it pretty much one shots things. 
---
Used about 100 or so rounds running it. Assaultrons took a few one shots. That said, I also used the turrets in my favor, removing their targetting, waiting a bit, then disabling them.
---
Fuck each and every one.
---
It's almost always those stupid 1st tents that's blocking my camp. They are a plague upon the land!
---
I did it for the first time yesterday and enjoyed it quite a bit. I do think it should be changed back to super mutants though, because given the notes on location, it makes sense.
---
About a month ago u/QuantumJay123 submitted a [nice post of getting weapons into display cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ha96qu/psa_you_can_put_weapons_displays_inside_the_white/).
---
2000 points max. I'd be ok with it if I could turn all my ammo in at once.
---
See that's awesome, Let me know it's there but don't be upset if I can't carry it all. People go into my house and just kinda hang out until I take it all. haha
---
I take mine on xbox, usually go to the screenshot album ingame then take an xbox screenshot and download it via the xbox app on the pc or mobile device.

If you need some ammo and are on PC let me know. I could hook you up with some free shells.
---
Thanks! Good luck to you too!

I don't think the game could keep up to be honest. Sprinting with Speed Demon already causes issues.
---
As you would know if you bothered to do the slightest bit of research, the virus is spread by water droplets which are mostly ejected from a persons mouth when they sneeze. These water droplets are much larger than the virus itself and can be stopped by the mask. While masks aren't a perfect defence, they are the best one we currently have. 
---
I won't hold my breath that you'll take this information on board though.
---
There are plenty of different reasons. Sometimes you start a group early and people leave it and you never go back to the social menu. Sometimes the perk cards being shared are detrimental to your build, sometimes the people in the group are not the best people and you don't want to associate with them.
---
I had a guy in a public group we were both in come to my camp and spend 15 minutes straight just shooting at me while I was on a workbench, and that was the only public team on the server. Sometimes +1 int just isn't worth it.
---
Communist Synth
---
One of the few bright spots of this whole mess was the nightly ritual of playing for a few hours with my girlfriend and an increasing pool of close friends. We've bonded over Fallout and some kind of gaming is going to become a ritual after this is over! Yay for bonding through gaming 🎮❤
---
75% of the time it's a damn Fallout 1st tent which has the same camp blocking footprint as a C.A.M.P.
---
It's ridiculous.
---
Note: I'm not railing against Fallout 1st. I have no issue with the subscription for moderate benefits model to keep the servers paid for and alive. I have an issue with the completely ridiculous placement size of the tent.
---
the other day I was helping a guy fight off radscorpions at the Monongah power plant. That was super annoying. We couldn't find any of them. I finally found them all on top of the building. I then proceeded to shoot them only to have them disappear and then we had to search for them again. This time they were back on the ground. Like  they should be attacking us, not us attacking them. It took us forever to clear out all the radscorpions, because they ran away from us every time we got a shot on them.
---
To bad so many high levels insist on spawn camping the enemies so I just have to sit around for 5 minutes waiting to get my canned meat.
---
I mean there are a few useless perks like vats perks on melee weapons but you actually don't need god roll weapons to succeed in the game it's stupidly easy.
---
Painful isn't it?
---
Is that what those cards next to their names? How do you get those?
---
[](/abbow)Now hear me out, just for tagging, the flaming bow. With grenadier on it tags a ton of shit all around where you shoot with it, and it only does just enough damage to them to get credit. It's nearly the perfect tagging weapon for events.

Was. Asbestos roof. Used less budget than the normal roof for a while, but got fixed about the time they pulled it from the A-Shop.

If I’m playing for a few hours I’ll do events and obtain a shed load of stimpacks and fusion cores and radaways etc etc that I just don’t use and can’t be arsed to sell. They get dropped at low level camps.
---
I always stay on the world and see what camp is in my spot. Not specifically to judge it, more to see what they are selling, but I'd be a liar if I said I didn't do a little judging.
---
I just moved my camp and all this budget nonsense is SO FRUSTRATING. And for that matter so is building in general.
---
Luckily this is my second character. My first I got up to 40 but realized I had fucked my S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and perks so badly that it would take me easily 20+ levels to fix it (I have 15 luck, for example, because I thought luck did a lot more than it *actually* does) so the current one I've been playing that's at level 49 and 3/4 is one that I planned out pretty well. The only issue is that at about 43 I had hit 15 perception and didn't realize that it was possible to put the stat point into a different stat but still take a perception perk card so I'm going to need to burn 3 levels on the third rifleman card.   
---
I do have a few too many points in some stats that I might end up moving around, like my Intelligence is way too high.. I think like 10, when I really only need it around 5, but altogether this second character is pretty well set. I rolled it during double exp weekend then claimed 6 lunchboxes from legendary run, kept myself well rested at all times and made a ton of cranberry cobbler. Between the Inspirational perk card, being on a full event team, the double exp, 5% from cobbler and 25% from lunchboxes, I blasted through the levels. I'm not even sure how that all stacks up since I don't know if Bethesda adds them all up because I don't know what the base exp for events was, but in theory it was 445% event exp and 345% for every other type, not counting my int as it raised through those levels. I would definitely say if they do another double exp event, that's the best time to reroll if it'll take less time and effort to start over than it would to fix a screwed up build lol. Well in my case, anyway, since my screwed up build was only level 40 and I was able to blow past that in a single weekend.

Go to where you equip the cards, choose one and there is an option to share.

Tesla rifle, as the electricity that it fires arcs between mobs and does not do excessive damage.

Tesla in vats, you avoid the no damage bug of sight aiming.

I miss being able to shoot them like we could in Fallout 4. It didn't really make Piper get off my Armor bench any faster, but it was satisfying to be able to shoot her.
---
It's worth it once you have your soda saloon fully themed, OP. I have a little Quantum bar in my town build: the quantum sign, the quantum wallpaper, the giant quantum bottle lamps, a couple of Thanksgiving displays only showing off Quantum, and have the settler wanderer there wearing the Nuka Quantum outfit. It looks pretty cool, and so I hope they do come back with the signs
---
The Mire is so under rated as a camp location (and just a section of the map in general) 
---
It easily has the most immersive atmospheres in the game. The lighting, the fauna, the existing structures and locations. 
---
I recently built a shanty town there in this cove of cliffs, and gained an all new appreciation for it.
---
I've been wondering why this community uses FU's, and it all makes sense now. This is just perfect. Thank you.
---
High end plans include backpack mods, bear arm and bear arm mod plans, fixer plans, radiation barrels, crocolossus backpack mod, ultracite calibrated shocks and emergency protocols, signs and letters, cuckoo and nuka cola clock plans from the wandering responder vendor, radiation emitter from Grahm, the plans from the riding shotgun event, and T60 power armor plans.
---
Goals.
---
I just is my Favorite explosive hand made and shoot at the enemies feet. A nice 60-100 damage tag.  Works great for mobs of people enemies too, as one bullet tags multiple.
---
If we get them for the daily ops it's be awesome to drop into a hot zone like that mission in fallout 4. That's if they are actually instanced dungeon events like they seem to be presented as.
---
I want a room with the stars wallpaper on ALL walls floors and ceilings. I think that would look awesome.
---
Yeah, I'm just now finding this out. It would've been nice to have the other three rifleman ranks from the third card a few levels ago, but it's not a big deal. I just ended up taking some perks I would've wanted later on anyway like starched genes, since I had the plans for the decontamination arch drop from somewhere (I think sbq) and I've almost got all of the mats to build it, so that'll let me get all of the mutations for my build a bit easier without blasting through a ton of radaway like I already did for speed demon and marsupial.
---
Thanks Reddit, for recommending me a post that doesn't exist.
---
Heavy PA. Big gun go boom
---
public teammate launched a nuke. also you didnt miss anything, there's still a quest when you enter silos and you can launch nukes whenever, it was just that quest completing when you launched a nuke that you missed
---
isn't the range too short on that?
---
This is how I end up in every game with the available option to max out sneak. Uncharismatic shadow.
---
I love playing 76 with my fiancé, I got her hooked on the shit. Just like a pimp getting his hoe hooked on the smack❤️
---
Just make the jacket wearable over any style under armor
---
Btw, why is 3 stars max level, but there are still two empty stars? Are they eventually going to max it out?
---
It's still here! I'll paste for you
---
You made my damn day.
---
These 2 guys were out in the wasteland, just shopping around camps from what I could gather. They dropped into my camp whilst I was out of sight in the back fixing up my armor. I don't think they realised a) they were in public chat and b) that I was in my camp and could hear everything. 
---
But they dropped in, were chatting idly while it loaded and when it did, they were full of 'holy crap this is a sick camp, oh my god its a diner, wow that is insane. Come look at this, this is beautiful man! Look at the detail. Oh wow look at this, I didn't see this before!'
---
I watched (very stalker-ly) from around the corner as they both actually took time to walk around and check everything out that I had built. My camps take hours and hours to put together and I take so much pride and put in so much effort. It means a lot when people spend the extra few minutes to have a look at my displays and my build. But these guys were so openly enthusiastic without realising I could hear everything. And it was the most wholesome experience I've had in a very long time.
---
So if you're on here guys, thank you for making my day. That was very sweet of you to be so complimentary whilst out with your dudes. I appreciate it a lot. Warmed my little irradiated heart. ❤️
---
Edit: Holy crap I posted this before I went to sleep and it blew up! Thanks so much everyone for all the really nice comments! This is the best community!
---
1. Bloody worried about shared cards of others
---
2. Wants to play with friends only
---
3. Is stupid
---
If you're in a group with someone that runs a silo it will complete.
---
This event has been glitched for a while.
---
Once you light the fire jump up onto the awning at the main entrance that looks down onto the "bridge".
---
You only need to kill a few ghouls, wait the rest of the time until the event is over.
---
Also cross your fingers that you are awarded the Jumpsuit and masks 👍🏻
---
Omg this is a great idea
---
I got him alive many times. You get the option to make him pay for the item instead resulting in a different rep reward.
---
You can't. I was at max budget and deleted a billboard, and then made 13 flamingos. Then deleted one, and tried to make the red rocket, deleted another one, deleted another one, and it let me make the red rocket.
---
Most things take up the space of one flamingo. Lights are like 2 or 3 flamingos. 
---
They should show budget values for objects, would be nice.
---
Oh, and I couldn't make a train car, so the train car is more budget than a billboard.
---
I know Birdbones definitely does. It says so in the tool tip before drinking the serum.
---
I decorated my back porch with a flamingo lined banister haha
---
True! I got really anxious from all the negativity from 2020 and just like you, I try to look at the bright spots out of this. Keep safe out there and all the best to you, your gf, and your friends 😊
---
Looking at you Division 2
---
Are flamingos the official measure of base-budget now? Bethesda should advertise the flamingo rate of all items on the Atom store.
---
They're my favourite item - every base I make has at least a dozen dotted around - so this is great news!
---
This is true, but the billboard budget is ridiculous. 😂
---
Kudos, my man! I am still at level 35 and just needed to hear this, no point for me now to go that path. Congrats to you
---
Vampire Gat/Minigun PA build. Never die, never need stims, can solo anything.

---
Tough love, like sending your kid out at age 18. Lol
---
That’s why the secret service is the only federal agency that includes US in its acronym (I.e. USSS).
---
Damnit! The atoms I would pay for a new type of roof but all we ever get now are frigging wallpapers and occasionally a new outer-wall style.
---
Yeah, I also don't drop huge amounts. 20 Radaway at a time, plans, maybe 50 water... Unless there's a larger group of people.
---
I just make sure you got the bag; after that, I'm out.
---
Only dupers got them anymore
---
Huh. I have BPD and CPTSD and never really knew that the fallout community is the reason I keep coming back to 76. 95% of players I've met are amazing and friendly. 
---
Also I love Mr Rodgers.
---
At times I have 400+ stim packs and a huge stack of plans that won’t sell well. I just dump these off to clear out the clutter and help out new players. I usually don’t have enough purified water to share as speed demon makes me chug them at rediculous rates.
---
If you really want to help out a new player craft some low lvl heavy leather that’s modded and a BOS recon rifle.
---
Yeah.... I tried it out once and will wait till they fix  it (if ever).  Only thing is I’m bleeding unwanted ammo right now so I may have to sell or dump as to not weigh down my stash :(
---
&gt;I still use my TSE gatling gun on a daily basis, I run an Unyielding set of armor and rarely die since the thing runs about 435 damage.  With the SBQ I still use it as the shots ring out around 20-25 even without the explosive effect.
---
Wouldnt someone have a legit one? I do.
---
Ok how do you do radiation rumble? My friend and I tried it and broke most of our weapons and armor and I died a lot we also lost the event.
---
Damn flamingo's are cheap
---
Not to mention a practical use. I don't wanna pick a fight with a guy who has a fatman strapped to his back. Is what I would say if the fatman didn't suck.
---
Yeah, I got addicted too! Like how my character is a Junkies build now 😂 Keep the wasteland love coming 😁
---
This item takes up 13 points on the TehSwoosh Flamingo Standardized Scale.
---
I've been using flamingo measurement ever since I found this post.
---
I would be happy if Bethesda used it in the Atomic Shop. 😊
---
Since they are legacy now I doubt you would find one in a vendor that is any good.  Any decent rolls would be trade only items now.
---
Cool thanks
---
Who needs the help from low levels when you just frog leg/gauss shotgun everyone?
---
Came to say the same thing.
---
_Rogue Agent Detected_
---
Heh. I still don’t know how I managed to do successful extractions in 2 DZs. (Haven’t done the infamous West DZ though.)
---
Now you gone and done it. They'll probably make the red rocket garage cost 26 flamingos and the mothman billboard cost 14 flamingos now. Lol
---
Always stay and judge. Usually I am disappointed but every now and then I get someone with some good ideas that I can steal for my own camp.
---
How do i find out if someone has a trade only one?
---
Alot of people just scrip it or drop it, cuz there is way better weapons now
---
Go to the market sub
---
Yup this.  Happened to me to but don’t really care.  I’ll get to it eventually
---
lol bethesda reasons.
---
I think there have been 5 stars for a very long time (since beginning of game?) while 3 star legendaries are the max. Maybe they'll add 4 - 5 star legendaries down the line.
---
I've only ventured in a few times. First I got wasted by a group of wandering mobs and ran in to a heavy. Second I got caught between two teams fighting. They stopped fighting, all focused on me then went back to it lol.
---
Alphabetizing the tabs would be nice too - the order seems... haphazard.
---
August 18th, according to Chally
---
I feel like you get a set from rose quest line. You can also look up places it spawns and put together a set
---
True, but sometimes you just need to know.
---
You know, that assurance that your annoyance was founded. Lol
---
Before the purveyor, sacrificial blades on a machete and scorch killer  receivers would grant a fourth star. Otherwise only hackers have been able to get four and five star weapons.
---
I know you cant with full head masks like Fasnacht. But this one only seems to cover the front, so I wanted to find out for sure
---
Wait, I thought he said storing it on an external SSD/HDD would be the better option? I have an OG PS4 and have the game on an External HDD and it runs well enough (aside from the occasional FPS drop). Rebuilding you database may also help speed up load times/delays.
---
He mentioned in a later video that it doesn't anymore, can't remember the video (might have been the level 5 mutations one) but since there's no downsides if you get it by accident or have it already there's no reason to remove it.
---
Do the rewards transfer through characters or no?
---
I’m 90% sure that lvl 70 won’t see this
---
Brilliant! Thank you for sharing!
---
&gt;Also recently had a line in the sand where all 15 scorched or so just plopped in the middle every time and we just lit em up with teslas, just 1000+ xp every 20 seconds and did that like 15 times
---
If I'm not mistaken there's a location you can place your FO1st tent and it will cause this to happen every time.  Most likely someone you were with did that.
---
this
---
Ive been trying to get that paint for ages.... but is it only for t60?
---
Sadly all I have is the officer paint, not been getting lucky at all for a month now. Would commit quite the list of atrocious sins for the elder paint :(
---
Ahhh, thanks for the tip.
---
I've probably scoured hundreds of player vendors since wastelanders dropped and I've only found 1 legendary dragon, and I bought it.
---
Not going to lie, off the top of my head I can't remember exactly the effects, but I'm pretty sure it was an instigating. I'd love to find a bloodied, but that will probably never happen.
---
Great :( Was really looking forward to this - even have the exact spot for it in my camp.
---
Color me disappointed - again.
---
I just hope he is getting the professional help he obviously needs.
---
You get a full set from the main questline. 
---
Plans to craft are in treasure maps I believe.
---
What about the regular daily challenge to level up? That’s there every day. Do you require more do to level up the higher level you are? That would seem like a nightmare to high level people
---
Gotcha. Thank you!
---
Yeah, if you solo it they only spawn at the bridge hub and get stuck at the bottom of the path most the time, unless you go down there they just stay there like idiots :-)
---
It couldn't be worn with any of the hats/helmets I tried it with so probably not. I didn't try it with a mining helmet though
---
I feel you man most people always encounters that idiot that starts it early
---
Id love a two shot with extra vats crit damage but at this point ill settle with any decent all purpose one
---
Just go back down to a silo, a quest will pop up.
---
That's true but this one also gives you double the score other challenges would give you.
---
"Sure.   Right after you give me the flux to make each of them."
---
White springs and bos and white powder jumpsuits
---
Yeah but that's the point .. if you are low level, the quickest and easy way to level up, is to hide and stay alive until at least the top ten.  If you make the top ten 3 times you level up.  Just find a bush and do nothing. Takes about an hour to complete 2 matches when making it to the top ten. Don't make the top ten it takes a bit longer. A good third of the time is load, wait or lobby screens with nothing to do.
---
If the challenge is a simple task, for example, like last night, I was level 6, the challenge was use 3 stems. I was able to spawn in, after about 8 mins of wait, load or lobby screens, and play in a match.  I spawned in on a team,  looted crates until I had three stems, power armor several weapons and ammo and some chems. I used the stems as I found them, a bit lucky I was able to not have full health as I found the stems.  I then started to play NW. I was fortunate to get three other guys level 6 or under, that knew how to group up. One got sniped right off so we played with a team of three.  I got three kills and we took second. The level 90, of course, was able to kill my team easily as NW is really about level and not skill.  Not slamming the level 90, they knew we couldn't do crap damage to a level 90 in power armor, and just walked into our position and shot us one by one, two of us in power armor.  Might of helped if any of us had stems left.  Took about half an hour.
---
At least last night, I was not grinding and having fun for 10 mins of that half hour and hopefully not annoying serious NW players.  When the challenge is "level up", I am bored for an hour and a half.
---
Sorry for the length but I wanted to clarify what I was trying to express just in case Bethesda reads any of this 🙂
---
Is that the one when you get all the outfits and both masks?
---
If you have an urban garden, are you composting?
---
Ha! Me too! One day I'll get around to it.
---
Holy crap.
---
I think maybe twice, I've actually seen him use his bed properly.
---
You can solo it, 1 intact objective is enough to succeed the event. When it's over you can finish all the ghouls who destroyed the other objectives.
---
I had a level 30 start mine, luckily I can pretty much solo it but I like more people there so they get rewards.
---
Please dont let this post get buried, it has the potential of making Fallout 76 a perfect game
---
To be clear, it is popular with white supremacists, and maybe Celts, but not everyone. I am personally not too keen on it, though I am white.
---
I always figured Leader of the Pack would be the easiest for this challenege, but for me it seems that when they implemented this challenge as a daily occurrence, LotP event rarely pops up anymore.
---
Same thing happened to me while I a public team, if you want to team up sometime I wouldn't mind running it with someone.
---
I'm xb1, I run bloodied so assaultrons should be my only real issue.
---
If interested send me a PM.
---
Me too. Sometimes I pop around to all of the CAMPS on the map to judge. But seriously, more often than I expected, I find awesome, or at least thoughtful.
---
I love the love that people put into this game.
---
I for one would love this. Not sure why this has few upvotes. These could make the game perfect
---
I just wanna ride around the wasteland on a bicycle
---
The game simply could not keep up with a speed that would make them worthwhile to ride in. 
---
I think instead a great option would be a camp plan that let's you build a heli-pad and gives you discounted fast travel, equivalent to the Travel Agent perk.
---
At least in Space Engineers, build limits are intended to be based on server load, or sometimes latency. I haven't found any similar explanation for FO76, but I didn't look as hard because my faith in the information existing is pretty low.
---
Yeah I like water bases. I literally built my whole base to get to a boat that is floating in water and make it look like it was docking at my house. (Just a rowboat) sometimes I think about moving then I remember how much work I put in and I know I would miss saying I have a boat.
---
The thing I hate is when they join your team just to fast travel to you.then leave to kill you and take the workshop
---
That's excellent.
---
This
---
The more obvious solution for stairs would be to allow stairs on the right or left side like in FO4, so you can use half floors close to other side...
---
Yep. Managed to get it a couple of days ago.
---
But only you see it sooo
---
What time zone are you in?
---
Defensive mutant stealth sniper. My build is nothing special, and not really optimized, but i love it. The best offense is no one even knowing you're there. And well, a strong defense if they do find you. I solo'd a 3-star sheepsquatch last night and never went out of caution. Just walked circles around it and watched it look for me. I have a bunch of defensive perks and enough resistances that i can go face to face with the SBQ and take no damage the whole fight, except for her gas, and that's really minimal.   
---
I'm pretty proud of all of this, because i am terrible at shooters, and learning build mechanics in any game. My build isn't pretty, but it works, and i survive, so i'm pretty surprised i've been able to do it. XD
---
Ok this is now my official workshop measuring scale
---
Congrats dude I remember my first. It was a big deal to me and my friends!
---
Nope. I would guess something wrong with the controller... does it happen in other games too?
---
I dont even know how to go about doing it. I have maybe 60 hours into the game, and just play solo, and I know i am missing out on so much of the details of the game that i will never experience.
---
Well, they are filled with Fallout irradiated (TM) fireflies.  Given how radiation is basically magic, I don't see why fireflies in the FO universe couldn't have a hyper bright variant used for this.
---
Yes, yes, yes, and yes.
---
This site can give you a good idea of pricing. I sometime go lower to make stuff move quickly. 
---
While I think the intention was crosshairs this does show that maybe bethesda should be more aware of how it could be interpreted. I would much rather poc players feel safe and not the white supremacist/nazi trash. Honestly the idea of someone seeing that and feeling validated makes me wish it was just a skull now.
---
Edit: wow judging from how dismissive the comments are on this thread id say we've already got a bunch of assholes that feel validated already. Here's the toxic side of the community i haven't seen yet. Gross.
---
Thanks?
---
What makes you say that?
---
Grenade launchers
---
Haha I had a something similar. Like a quad hardened, I bought it from a player vendor at 35 and it still one shots almost anything in vats. I was never sure if it was like a bugged weapon or if I got lucky. Haven't played in a month so knows if it's still there.
---
Of course.
---
this happened to me as well, I was bummed for a minute, then realized I still have my nuclear keycard so I could still launch one whenever I wanted.
---
Ignore it.  You're entitled to your own opinion.  Or wait.  We \*are\* in the age of, "everyone must thing alike," aren't we?
---
I am a level 67 NW player and my only real complaint is the lack of maps.
---
Have one person protect each side in-between the tunnels and npcs while another person gathers ore in the mine while wearing a rad suit or power armor.
---
Couple people. Whatev :)
---
You can charge max caps for it and somebody will buy it,  but I'd trade it for another god tier weapon that you want to use instead.
---
Yeah I’m not quite there yet to be able to solo or even two man it.
---
Yea I totally got booted from a few groups for what I assume was sharing the wrong perk card.
---
I don’t trust your team leading skills, I trust mine.
---
For real. Was trying to kill ghouls the other day and went to the racetrack. It was populated with protectrons. Whaaat? That's the ONLY time i've seen that.
---
The one thing I love about summer is seeing how fast I can get paper to decompose in my turner. I’m hoping I get a rich batch to get some Turbo fert for my tatos IRL next season.
---
Bloodied PA. I was lucky enough to roll a B/25/25 plasma caster, so I made a VATS-focused build that absolutely stomps. It does so much damage that I don't even run crit perks. The other day I managed to keep all of the NPCs in Radiation Rumble alive, solo, just by gooifying everything that moved. I keep points in Lock and Load (plus the speed demon mutation) to get past the slow reload animation, use the radiation barrel reward from Radiation Rumble to easily dial in my rads to 19, and Thru-Hiker/Good with Salt/Carnivore mutations means I get to carry around tons of high-SPECIAL and AP food buffs.  And last but not least, because the plasma caster is a slow-firing gun that uses plasma rounds, I can keep myself in ultracite ammo with very little effort. Encryptid tends to eat my lunch, though. I have to back off my rads and play around 50-60% health. I have a J/FFR/RW minigun that I keep messing with whenever I'm tired of Bloodied and want to play something tankier, but honestly, the amount of work that goes into making bullets for that thing is much more work than micromanaging a Bloodied build.
---
OOF! Risky. It's worth about 15K+ i reckon
---
As long as you're not running around with 15k caps on you then that should be fine
---
You could try it for more though. And then maybe reduce the cost every day if it doesnt sell
---
We are talking about Score Rank, not normal levels. Normal levels that would make sense.
---
" the 40ish player who asked for a bunch of serums(I gave one of pretty  much each one) and then I go to his camp and see his vendor full of said  serums for sale. "  
---
That is really low.
---
That's sucks. I read that as long as you aren't online when the new challenges come, you will be fine. I haven't had any issues personally.
---
Always!
---
I haven’t seen one in my spot that beats out mine. 
---
This reminds me that I should be taking photos of the truly impressive builds I come across.
---
Short of editing the file in external programs like Photoshop, you cannot edit them further in-game.
---
You could Photoshop a frame onto another photo fairly easily. I would just take a pic of something almost entirely black, using all the frames possible, then you can filter out the black later and overlay onto your other photos.
---
I'm a bloodied build so there is no way I can tank all of the beacons 😅
---
giving helmets an armor rating too would be nice...
---
There's a stealth boy mod for PA
---
We eat a shit tonne of produce here so there's always good stuff to compost.
---
I have Commander Daguerre setup in the shed and locked the door. She hasn't been outside since or anywhere else to open my doors.
---
What level and 2 or 3*?
---
You are a saint
---
I saw someone with the tag, "IDONTFKNGTRADE".   I was jealous that he thought to do it.  ;)
---
I totally agree. NW sucks! It's not that I don't enjoy PVP, but I'm sorry I get killed by cheat kills too often.
---
Today again 2x in the building, with closed doors and then it hails head shots and the best - Reported the player does Beth. also nothing.
---
So get the stuff out of the score and PvE only, together you have more fun playing anyway.
---
Rare? I've thrown away more of those than I can count.
---
Would that be a responders symbol in the context of the game?
---
I swear, when it's only one legendary I find over a dozen just doing normal stuff. They were everywhere. FOUR at a defend workshop! Even a Mole Rat was legendary! 
---
Yesterday, nothing. 
---
And some asshole at One Violent Night kept using a gatling to kill everything (outside the door, of course) and melted the legendaries before anyone could get a tag in. There were 4 legendaries and I was only able to tag the Wendigo because I ran ahead. Come on, people, you know it's a daily, stop being a troll.
---
I'm on console so I don't have these kinda issues, tho a full rank up in one day is a massive quest wich gets only a small reward.
---
It seems glitchy. I can’t seem to select the major effect. It keeps going back to the prefix selection. But thanks for the website.
---
Well, the game already has fireflies and they are not a "hyper bright" variant.
---
That also doesn't help the fact that fireflies don't continuously light up so even if they provided good light it would be intermittent and inconsistent.
---
On another note, is there any rhythm or reason as to how items are grouped when stored? Seems completely random and infuriating upon first glance.
---
I love my Two shot Explosive Combat rifle. It makes XP gains on events like Uranium Fever skyrocket
---
2*? I'd list for 15k.
---
.45 is weightless with 2* bandolier
---
Collect enough ore for at least 1/4 on the event and keep at least 1 npc alive, there isn't much more to it then that. With just 2 people depending on your builds that can be a real chore though..
---
2*
---
Did you do all 3 rounds?
---
it is a visual bug. sometimes players using PA will vanish. if they get out their PA will appear, but they will still be bugged on your end
---
Is it max level?
---
What happens if you max your budget and then they just change the values of stuff to go up? Does things start vanishing from your camp?
---
It’s a fine line. The advantages inherent to PA are already pretty good. Imagine a full set of Life Saving, AP refresh, sentinel T-65 PA. You’d be an unkillable, all sprinting, all flying tank! I think legendary armor should come preloaded with one of the existing PA mods with one space for the owner to choose a mod. That way you might roll a jet pack or stealthboy torso and still be able to add emergency protocols. That would give your PA a real step up without completely obliterating the market for non-PA armor.
---
Thanks
---
hud is already constantly blowing up as it is.. not sure I would welcome more crap procing in my face while im trying to play
---
I like having party leader control, so I can flip the team goal from building to events to hunting when needed, to maximize EXP gain.
---
So it's the same problem
---
I relate to this so hard! My boyfriend and I live in different states and have really connected over Fallout during this pandemic. Also from Aus
---
do you think a quad E would have the same effect?
---
Dunno you sound like the triggered one there buddy lmao
---
Welp that's it then. Thx
---
There was a similar post few months ago where a guy was calling us white supremacists for killing super mutants.Keep your politics out of games,its getting pretty annoying.
---
I was thinking the same thing, but I’m not to sure if lone wanderer perk will work if you’re by yourself in a public group. I use that perk, so I’ve never been in a hurry to group with people
---
Either max or 45
---
Universal PA Mod Glitch MK3 ....
---
Flamingos should become the new currency.
---
Can anyone figure out how to sort by column? I tried it in firefox and sheets app and neither does it.
---
Some interesting takeaways:
---
-Spotlight only costs 0.20% when all other turrets are around 2-3%
---
-Floors cost 2x as much as walls and all cost the same quarter, half, full.
---
All generators cost 0.40% from the small to the fusion. Except the small vault tec which costs 0.20%
---
-patio chair costs 3x as much as all other chairs, weird but who's building patio chairs anyway 
---
-either mothman billboard takes a whopping 25 flamingo units or 5%!
---
-they didnt include roofs or foundations
---
What exactly does this mean? "detail exceeds 15x"?
---
Has something changed?  Don't recall ever failing it, regardless of paying attention to the extractors.
---
Sure, it's the explosive effect that tags. If I'm playing in a large group I just need to vats one shit at a group of mobs and it usually tags all of them so I can then shoot a different mob group and I just bathe in the xp. Even at level 105 I still usually go up one level with a uranium fever event
---
[](/abbowling)Yes, but they're never where my camp is(for good reasons), they're always down the cliff from where mine is with no overlap. I really wish they'd go ahead and reduce the buffer between camps.
---
So only have it show in the teams menu. Still have the same notification of "X created group", but then if you go to join and it says "uR mOm", then you can decide if you really want to join or not.
---
...I don't think I've ever "finished it". Even having all 3 extractors running without being destroyed a single time.
---
I always thought it was just a "run-out-the-clock" type event.
---
Flamingos are the best way to measure anything.
---
But for example it won't be as effective on Line in the sand,because of range,right?
---
Or maybe nazis took these signs because they knew it was a good way to hide in plain sight but sure blame the people who point it out to out the nazis lol solid logic 10/10 there buddy
---
Flamingo Units. Because Bethesda gives us a big FU with everything in this bloody game.
---
This. Scorchbeasts. There is a map of fissure sites in the military wing to the right of the four posters that explain how to launch a nuke. Select the pins to learn the fissure site locations. Travel to each fissure site and move on to the next one before the SB spots you if you don't get a legendary SB.
---
Something something osha something something
---
45 is max. You might...MIGHT...get someone to pay 15k. The fact it’s a 2* hurts the value. If you want it to sell, I’d price it at 7k. If you’d rather wait and see, set it at 15k. You never know. Pricing in this game is all over the place, which is why I prefer trading high end items.
---
It didn't used to be like this. It was very lackluster and spawned like 5 super mutants per wave (was about 3-5 waves previous) instead of dozens upon dozens of ghouls in dozens of waves. For some reason the info card still says it's an easy event but there is no way. They need to make more event changes like this and it would make them worth doing (I'm looking at you, Death Blossoms)
---
Things are getting fixed that's why they are using the PTS more, I'd rather they take their time to fix it rather than get it out quickly and break other stuff in the process.
---
I’ve soloed the event and completed it with all three extractors functioning.  So, yes.  I don’t recall it was all that hard.  This isn’t an event I frequent lately, so perhaps something has changed?
---
1) dunno that post and can't really associate with it 2) you don't find it ironic that you are agreeing with my point that political symbols should be kept out of the game?
---
I feel you're the type of guy that falls off a bike and says, fucking white people!
---
I only join a group for the bonus xp, not interested in what everyone else is doing.
---
That's a magic weapon, the 33% vats hits chance is one of the magic legendary effects. Some legendary effects are broken and make weapons completely op in vats. Check out Angry Turtle's videos on youtube he explains everything about magic weapons.
---
Unfortunately this has been the norm at events lately rather than the exception in my experience. I think it's the legendary run that is driving players to be far more competitive over XP.   
---
All I know is that the community is super into this "best community ever narrative" while some of us are dealing with these types of people on the daily.   
---
I'm level 483 for reference. I've taken to asking people to stop one shotting everything nicely, and if they don't I just start in with my own one shot weapons. It sucks though, I have been carrying a pretty weak laser rifle just for sharing tags in events and it's gathering dust these days.
---
its not about killing each other at all. its about being best at surviving. so HIDING and keeping a low profile does a lot for your overseer score.
---
&gt;he game already has fireflies and they are not a "hyper bright" variant
---
That's why I said "variant."  There are multiple kinds of mirelurks right?  Why not multiple kinds of fireflies?
---
&gt;That also doesn't help the fact that fireflies don't continuously light up so even if they provided good light it would be intermittent and inconsistent.
---
You're trying to apply a hyper realistic lens to a game that doesn't operate on real world logic.  Radiation in FO does whatever the devs want it to do.  Why is it easier to accept that giant bugs exist (which almost assuredly wouldn't work IRL) but that a continually glowing bright firefly can't?  Have some imagination.
---
I wouldn’t. I actually got one and that’s what made me turn into bloodied build. I have a 3 star bloodied and then I found another 3 star bloodied in a player vendor for 1500 caps I snatched it up. If you want to trade for something I would do that don’t sell it. It’s valuable
---
It was queen of the hunt. Learn all the mods to protective then farm it daily.
---
Berserkers explosive weapon, the explosive effect will tag things, but if you wear armour it will do less damage than a vanilla weapon, so less chance to will one shot the mobs.
---
Your posts and comments all have one major issue.
---
You assume that this is a Celtic Cross, despite the fact that there is absolutely no context or themes in the setting of 76 that would make this likely. You blatantly ignore the context in which the symbol is found to assume it's what you want it to be. 
---
You jump to the least likely interpretation immediately. You saw it. Decided it was a Celtic Cross, then tried to manufacture an explanation/outrage. 
---
Besides, in just pure design it's far more similar to the sun cross, or cross of the zodiac... Very minimalist design, just a cross and a circle.....
---
But of course there's not much outrage in "I found a pagan symbol in foundation!"
---
I totally agree 
---
If only this sort of technology could be invented and implemented into these types of open world Team based games.
---
Players could then interact between each other in a far more descriptive way and pass relevant information to each other in real time providing a far better gaming experience.
---
'Removes headset with mic' to scratch head in a wondering pose, why no-one has considered this? 
---
😉
---
People like you need to wise up.
---
It could be. I don't wear pa to the point it breaks anymore. Maybe they moved the noise closer to when it breaks
---
Sorry I didn’t realize it was only 2 star. Yeah it hurts it a little but you can get a good bit still. It’s a powerful weapon. When I melee I do that and my 2 star large death claw. Shit almost does 1k damage without any perks
---
I mean I dont do line in the sand as often cus UF has more legendaries and I get tons of materials from scrapping weapons, but I do still get a lot of xp from line in the sand. I usually sit on top of the rocket launcher and just send shots at the three spawn points then vats any stragglers. My combat AR has good range. It's all about the mods.
---
it is truly painful.
---
Whoa you sound a little triggered there pal I wonder why that could be
---
PVP failed in FO76 largely because it was garbled and poorly realised. The slap damage was a half measure that pleased neither side, and the game launched without factions or seemingly any plans to add them. 
---
It’s Bethesda’s narrative that PVP failed because ‘you’re all just so nice,’ - it means they don’t have to acknowledge their shortcomings.
---
You'd think they'd be generated automatically based on something like the poly count if the issue is performance, with maybe an additional factor based on object size to prevent camps from looking ridiculous.
---
But I guess not.
---
???
---
Are you not getting confused with radiation rumble?
---
I turned that house into my camp, get a ring every time I join a server
---
I ended I'm a PVP with 2 people because I claimed a workshop that was not showing claimed on the map. Im 380+ they were both &lt;100. I smoked them both (thank God VATS is gone, we can fight like men now) but they didnt give up and eventually they got me. After a few more deaths. 
---
I never touched their dropped junk and I went back and dropped 100+ scrip junk for them and moved on. Good times no one lost a thing.
---
Yea they stopped pushing out updates which essentially let the game and it’s players kind of drown. Most of us were waiting for a new expansion and an area after Twine Peaks but after for waiting for a year nothing was pushed out and then they made the statement about updates and everyone was pretty upset. I’ve put a lot of time into save the world and it sucks that there won’t be much progression anymore but I’m glad I can still play it rather than them shutting the servers down. I still have fun when playing the BR but only if I have friends with me otherwise I’d just be endlessly dying.
---
Okay I'm a huge noob but...how do you lock doors?
---
Man if you think these are bad try explosive weapons. They are actually worse :/
---
&gt;B) I can change the Team Goal between Building and Events
---
This is precisely the reason I make my own team, so I'm not on a team where they keep changing the role.
---
And now they're all disappearing...
---
Nobody does that event get some help yourself
---
as a community, we should agree on primary dump points such as blue suitcases.
---
They just changed the UI recently and I’ve had some issues myself on mobile. Hopefully I gets sorted soon because it’s a pretty useful tool. On Iphone I have succeeded by clicking the first prefix again the using the arrows above the keyboard to move to the next effect.
---
Awesome congrats!  I did my first nuke a couple of nights ago solo.  Took me 2 hours but I got it done. Learned as I went for sure.  Server maintenance popped up right after I launched and booted me so I couldn't go get the SBQ but it was still very cool.
---
This..... Its a run down the clock event.
---
I'm not sure it's possible to fail it. I've certainly never seen it
---
I think they're referring to the "Uranium Extracted" bar, which never fills completely regardless of how well you do the event. Not just you,  I've never seen it full.
---
I'm at 300 hours, and have been solo since the beginning. It's possible to play solo, and it's easy to in the beginning, but once you hit about level 60, if feels like it starts punishing you for not being in a team. Maybe that's just me though.
---
I just started working on my build, trying to max out everything I can, grinding for the best gear I want, and now in the 90's, it's starting to get easier. Would be more fun with the right friends, but none the less is more playable now. 
---
As for the silo itself, it's part of the Enclave quests. Once you complete that, it walks you through what to do. Actually doing it is then another story as you have to keep moving with the robots respawning.
---
Eh.. Close enough? https://i.imgur.com/UprjuKY.png
---
I mean OP is still right, all you are buying is more time for a weapon that will break faster than their equivalent weapons with weapon artisan. The problem is the rate at which these weapons decay.
---
yeah that is horseshit, but this is not actually a covid thread and its not in the appropriate forum.
---
Either its airborne or it's not and the data suggests it is, if we are supposed to wear masks.  Unless your Dr. Fouchi then you go to a baseball game sit next to people and take your mask off.
---
I use my 38 fixer as my primary gun and I buy tons of 38 ammo for 1c.
---
must be this.. fever is always packed and I've never seen one fail in 800+ hours..
---
That's really nice! Hope you guys get to see each other sooner! And always keep safe 🤗
---
No need to carry steel as long as you have it in your camp inventory. Plus there are several green boxes with steel in them around the site.
---
16 times the detail.
---
why berserkers?
---
I’ve noticed fewer people helping with repairs in general as they farm for SCORE, but otherwise seems like the same event as it always was.
---
Bare in mind that any legendary with an atomic shop paint job on it will also not show up in the trade menu.
---
But either way a very nice gesture from you.
---
Nope. You can't do anything. Those dailies are gone. Bughesda also refuses to do anything about it if you make an ticket. And i say refuse, as i know by a fact that they could add for example 150 atoms (to buy a rank) to make up the loss of score. But they just refuse.
---
It's not airborne. How do you not know this? How do you know so little about this virus and yet you insist that you know better than the experts? It's an almost impressive level of ignorance.
---
You don't drop loot in events anymore. But the minute it's over you do, so watch for those last minute mobs at the queen and Imposter.
---
Welcome to the club my friend!
---
I'll try using my quad,ty for the tips
---
I swear I remember filling the bar multiple times,oh well... Mandela effect at action
---
Yes. I’m a stones throw from Survey Camp Alpha. There seems to be a patrol route for mobs along the tracks that heads from the Flooded Trainyard towards Watoga Station.
---
"Fireflies don't light up all the time" isn't being hyper realistic, it's just a fact.  And just because a game features something unrealistic doesn't mean you should just disregard all realism, that's always been a silly argument.
---
Having to make up a bunch of lore to explain an in game reward is asinine.  The fireflies in game and irl would make terrible light, full stop.  That was my point.
---
This is a silly thing to argue about.  Move on.
---
Nope,literally just did Uranium Fever
---
Those tooltips are more often wrong than right. Birdbones gives no sneak bonuses beyond what you get from the additional 4 Agility.
---
Auto grenade launcher with grenadier perk, though make sure its low level as the range is massive and it hits hard, nothing worse than everyone popping a lunchbox at line in the sand only for no one to get a hit in as they keep getting auto deleted by the grenade guy. Tesla is prob best as you can fire at your feet safely too
---
No, just can't build anything, or put liquor in the fermenter. You will probably have to destroy many thing to get back under budget, depending on how many of the item you have built.
---
Don't push him
---
"I only made this group for bonuses, please leave me alone"
---
I saw the gun he had out the entire time and I genuinely think he was not very well equipped. I forgot to mention this dude was insanely over encumbered as well, I really don’t think he knew how to play the game all that well.
---
Ohhh...see the confusion here is that you thought I asked for a response from you. I did not.
---
Like line in the sand with the tent. I use a tse handmade with grenadier, it breaks fast but gets them all. Most use a mini or guass mini I noticed.
---
Whats the name. I have the perk card. Glowing ore and lockpick mods already
---
When you wear armour, is does less damage than a non legendary weapon. It's useless, but good for tagging low level mobs.
---
there is a workbench in the foyer and plenty of weapons to scrap for steel ...
---
This. I’ve yet to join a team and it actually be a team. Everyone is off soloing.
---
Too bad I can't see anything while wearing it
---
yeah, survival really felt like the way the game was meant to be played. the element of risk it added was really a blessing in the content starved state the games been in from launch.
---
And you don't know which stuff made it go over budget right? So that's prolly the worst part
---
OOF
---
There is no special buff.
---
It does give 4 agility, and each point of agility boosts sneaking (5%)
---
So the serum is not wrong, but it does not do anything special beyond base stats.
---
I don’t think I’ve ever failed it...
---
My personal anecdote, I don’t notice much of a difference in having it vs not having it. I just get annoyed with the constant sound and invisibility click when I move and stop. For now, I just stick with shadowed thorn armor with high agility and I don’t have any issues.
---
I treat it as more of a preference issue instead of gaining/losing significant amounts of stealth, especially since things can break with a single update. Maybe the next update an issue causes chameleon to give you god mode sneak or the opposite and you’re in danger right off the bat. If I pvp’d consistently, I’d definitely use it.
---
That’s just me.
---
Damn,my bad  
---
Yeap,there's no fail state for this quest
---
Yes I had to buy my way through the last 30 tiers with atoms I've been saving for half a year
---
No. It's not close enough to be misconstrued. 
---
A quick Google search of Celtic crosses make this clear. 
---
A cursory consideration of the context and setting in which the symbol is found further makes this clear. 
---
This isn't about not questioning your reality or obeying. 
---
There's a dramatic difference between acknowledging the existence of systemic racism and pushing against it....
---
And imagining skin head conspiracy theories in a video game.  
---
Your moral outrage over the latter is a joke.
---
You and everyone else! Hope you got radaway on quick key and then it’s a quick sprint out of the nuke zone! Usually it is more stressful than taking on the Queen!
---
I've been doing that event since day one. 1250 hours. And the event always lasts the 8 minutes or whatever it is. It has never finished early.
---
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
---
This happened to me, I finished the main story without even realizing it because I was on a team when someone launched a nuke.
---
in another thread it was proposed the we all standardize on using the blue suitcases at train stations to dump crap.
---
You are the one trying to point out that a crosshair sprayed on a wall in a video game is a racist symbol when it clearly is not.
---
Only 5000 more hours and they'll give you 20 atoms!
---
Totally. When I first started on the beta I was thoroughly disappointed to figure out, after I built a shit load on my first workshop after I felt comfortable enough taking one over, that it was for nothing lol. I wondered why the budgets were so big in the first place if the servers weren’t stable enough to hold it for more than a few hours back then. This would also be a huge selling point for the FO1st subscription and make it way more useful to those kinds of players
---
I had a similar problem on ps4, 1. is your xbox older than three years?, and 2. is your xbox full?
---
my problems went awaywhen i freed up space and "rebuilt" my data cache. might do some research for xbox and see if there's something similar
---
If you watched any videos of the devs talking about this game, they once talked about the difficulty of turning a game engine based solely on the player and trying to rewrite it so it thinks every player is the main character was difficult at first because its more or less hard written into the source code of very elder scrolls and fallout game. But once they tricked the game engine to do what they wanted, it worked pretty well with what they had plans for it. 
---
I thought about how they process things in a business stand point an so far I just think they do one basic test on most camp items in the game. Like can it be rendered in the game? Yes? Ok its good to go. As long as it can be placed in the game its good to go. All the vanilla camp items were more than likely copy an pasted from fallout 4 without testing.  That explains why the lever action had the same reload glitch like fallout 4 did and that wall cabinet still can't be placed on walls. A lot of the issues 76 still has or had were just ported over from fallout 4 and skyrim and any issues that were fixed made other minor issues pop up along the way. They have no real way to fix glitches or bugs if they didn't fix it in their previous game and this dates back to Morrowind. Skyrim suffers the same glitches from the vanilla release in every port of the game an only major bugs were fixed that broke the storyline quests. Bethesda relies too much on modders to make unofficial patches to fix their games yet don't allow them to fix fallout 76. Like the modding community at this point has so much more experience with the game engine than any senior game engine developer over at bethesda but they don't take the help. Some advice yes but not a literal here copy this code and put it in the game an it'll fix this issue indefinitely and you don't have to pay me or hire me as a external 3rd party code writer. It's just smh at this point.
---
The devs have neither the experience nor the skill with the creation engine to pull this off. Best we can hope for is some backpacks that have weapons permanently on them. Probably something like a hunting rifle or combat shotgun slung on the side.
---
It was only a double score weekend mate
---
Well last time it was obviously the roofs, but Beth is terrible at basic communication. They "stealth" change stuff with no announcement, the recent change to how carnivore and herbivore for example.
---
Someone posted earlier that if you hear the announcement that adequate uranium has been extracted, you’ve completed the requirements for the event and can let them smash all the extractors. The event will still complete with full rewards.
---
Dude, i think you had too much Nukashine
---
Yeah have it saved, well the diluted so my mutations don’t get suppressed, also now have the Stealth suit as a fav as many people have suggested, love the F076 community
---
I agree with you on this even tho it seems like taking their time still results in things breaking but maybe not as bad as when they rush
---
I finally managed to spot the Leader of the Pack event after hours of play today. Killed the first two, no problem. Head to the third... and there’s a level 50 Sheepsquatch there that one-hit kills the legendary. I’m only level 25 so I run the other way quickly. Took another hour of waiting for the event to come back 😔
---
Based on your post time, I think I see why you may have this problem. 
---
At the top of this most recent hour (noon at Bethesda hq) is the daily reset. When logged in during the reset this bug occurs. 
---
The bug is unacceptable and super unprofessional, but my advice to survive in this buggy hell scale is to log off at 10 till and don’t log in until 5-10 after whatever the most recent hour is for you
---
No, but they will add more stuff like this
---
is the range on tesla enough to hit enemies as they spawn outside the fence?
---
Why?  Will you be unable to play for the next six weeks?
---
The "rank up" challenge was easy at first all I needed to do was survive for a few minutes and I would rank up but now it actually takes effort. Most of the NW challenges are kinda difficult depending on your level of experience.  For example the one from yesterday "use a stimpack 3x", well when I die after 2 hits it's pretty hard to use a stimpack. I was fortunate enough to find an explosive weapon so I could injury myself then use the stimpacks. So pretty much unless it's the "place camp" challenge i usually don't even bother.
---
I kinda like the handmade aswell
---
Crap and I though the few thousand was high, I would not even bother with it then.
---
No, they're keeping the extra daily challenges they added until the end of the season (to help compensate the autocompletion bug, though if the bug is still happening it's kind of redundant).
---
The double score was just a weekend event, like the previous weekend was a double xp event.
---
oh I get it,ty
---
No, I stated the "even if the intentions were innocent" part clearly. I'm not automatically assuming it was 100 percent intended to be an Odin's cross. But I am simply asking what does it mean that it happens to look like one. 
---
And I have also pointed out possible racial overtones in Astoundingly Awesome Tales 5 in another post where a gorilla is pitted against the police. And I have not even touched on other analyses that this subreddit may be too fragile to consider.
---
Lmao I find it funny folks don’t appreciate a good joke or quick witted quip on this app look at the down votes I get just for a small comment it’s almost like censorship I’ve only been on this app for a month but I’m finding that for a app of ideas and sharing there is a lot of close minded people on it lol seems every time I post I get a ur sentences are incorrect or last time it was I know we posted something but we really don’t want ur unsolicited opinion 
---
The idea of this app is amazing but like what’s going on in the real world is that if you are able get rid of the people who think differently
---
Think by early he means the event always finishes before the extraction bar is full.
---
They already got engaged (i am dutch sorry if i butchered that word)
---
Ah,good to know. Thanks!  
---
For some reason I thought the more the bar is fulled the better reward is
---
What are today's challenges, since I'm at work atm
---
The experts that say its airborne or the experts that say its not?
---
you have an impressive level of ignorance, and that is my whole point as to why this NEVER should have been posted here in a Fallout 76 forum.
---
If they say wear a mask, they are of the school its airborne they just don't want to admit it.
---
If they say don't wear a mask they are of the school it is not airborne.
---
There are 'experts' arguing both cases, both have data that they claim validates them, who do you believe?
---
whatever the answer is it does not belong here.
---
Can we please add this to the building UI? I’m not impressed with standard or metric but would love to know how many flamingos left of camp budget.
---
So right! Let's cover our eyes and ears and make the scary text saying to do better go away!
---
Really makes me wonder about the phone being more powerful than a home link....
---
No, they never said that. They said they will keep the 9 challenge per day until the end.
---
This is gonna suuuuck
---
I'm confused! Ive never failed it even when I'm playing alone. Are you waiting unlit the last minute to start the event or something?
---
Good job
---
I soloed my first silo at around level 65 if my memory serves me correctly. With no legendary gear, to boot. I'm a stealth sniper which allows me to hide from the enemies and focus my fire, definitely makes silos easier for me. 
---
My best tip is that the Gutsies and Assaultrons are your worst enemies. You can ignore the Protectrons to kill them first. Gutsies completely ignore your armor, and Assaultrons... Well, they're Assaultrons. Additionally, in the first area, the first round of enemies will be low-level (8 or so), which you can use to your advantage. Focus on the high-level guys as they're more dangerous. 
---
Spoilers for faster/easier ways to beat the silos follow, if you want to find it out on your own then stop reading here. 
---
In the first area where you're getting past the laser gates, you can skip the first step where you read a terminal to learn what to do. You won't have quest markers, but nothing in that area is impossible to find without them. (This can save you from one combat, since the robots there will have respawned between your first and second visits.)
---
If you're high level you should have some extra perk cards to buy. If you grab hacker 3 and hack the terminals at the start of each area you can turn off the turrets, which drastically lowers the difficulty of soloing a nuke.
---
Fixing the reactor can be skipped if you have 3 lockpick AND 3 hacker. In Charlie (idk about other silos) you turn left as you enter the reactor room, hug the wall till you see a door, then pick its level 3 lock and hack the level 3 terminal inside. 
---
It's also a lot easier to destroy the mainframe with grenades or an explosive gun than by manually clicking each core. 
---
When repairing the mainframe for the big door it's much easier to just take all the broken cores off it and fix them at the Tinker's bench than it is to try and find them all. It'll cost come materials, but worth it IMO.
---
In the big door room there's an unlocked terminal that opens a door back into the Storage area near the entrance. This area has workbenches for repairing your guns (and IIRC it has a Tinker's as well). 
---
In the launch prep room there are some locations you can hide on top of shelves that make the game spawn less enemy robots. The shelf on your left closest to the entrance is one. Additionally, if you lose a robot you should get a prompt to rebuild it at a terminal, which can save tons of time in the long run.
---
What??
---
Thanks for this
---
But not after placing one neon sign?
---
by exploits
---
Aaah .. Bisto
---
Round about where the cars spawn
---
The question of "crosshairs being a hate symbol" is absurd. 
---
They aren't. Just as the Celtic Cross isn't inherently racist. It has just been co-opted by morons and bigots. 
---
Should devs avoid all Christian themes and symbols? Those are widely co-opted by hate groups too..... 
---
Maybe avoid bald characters because of skin heads.....
---
The Zodiac... It's got the same symbol.... Racist. 
---
Medicine wheel.... Has a circle and a cross....best to avoid that too.
---
There's a difference between recognizing racism/hate and trying to assign it to things that aren't.
---
I'm waiting to play with friends.
---
It's being "hyper realistic" when you're ignoring the central lore concept that drives all of the mutations in the series.  I'm not saying throw away all realism, but when the radiation in Fallout literally turns people into glowing lava lamps, why are you taking the side that a glowing firefly is a step too far?  That's just inconsistent with what radiation is established as being capable of in this series.  
---
As far as I can tell, the fireflies in 76 do just glow all the time.  And even if they didn't, you could just make a Glowing Firefly like there are Glowing Ghouls that glow all the time.  There is no "new" lore to explain why there would be a perpetually glowing and brighter than usual firefly - they mutated because of the radiation just like the giant fireflies we see now and/or the glowing enemies.
---
Sorry for the confusion.  
---
Nope,the moment it pops up I rush to start it
---
Yep. It does work. It gives out a bright white light. The only problem is when it hits the weapon on your hand the shadow seems very low quality. Now, this might not happen to you. I play on PC and some of my graphic settings are low.
---
Had one of these drop last week and figured it would be good for bugged out line in the sand.  It was......but needed to be repaired 3/4 of the way through the event.  It wasn't over repaired going in, and I knew it was going to degrade fast, but damn.
---
I mean that would not be bad, I wonder if we could get that rolling a bit more in momentum..
---
That's the converter
---
So I have full control and don't have to worry about being removed from group
---
Lol no.   Rockstar didnt whip up an entire update in 2 weeks because people were dressing like clowns.  Like all the other "we did it reddit" moments this one didn't really affect anything.
---
Also, most people were claiming the "movement" was about lack of communication and not lack of updates.  Announcing an update 4 days before release sure makes it seem like they didn't receive the message.
---
It's an exploit involving blueprinting the factory at the munitions factory workshop
---
Happy cake day and yeah it went on for weeks
---
He's not on Reddit, trust me.

---
You're a clown, and it's because of people like you that mask wearing should be a legal requirement in public. You cannot be trusted to make the responsible decision, and even if you could, you lack the intelligence to inform you toward that decision. 
---
I won't be responding to any more of your drivel.
---
I have a danger sign near my nukashine punch bowl. When I am camp I still try to point it out and see if people will drink from it. Seasoned players usually come over and give me the thumbs down emote. No one has drank from it yet.
---
Look at what they typed they didn't mean the workshop
---
HAHAHAHA bro, didnt even think about it
---
&gt;without stealing xp
---
It's the XP same to you as if they weren't even at the event. If Bethesda wants to implement another metric on Events they have a lot of reasons to do so, but granting rewards due to proximity to event regardless of co-operation are the rules as they are established. Only SBQ fight has a damage ratio required for the corpse drop rewards (Wendigo Colosuss might too now, IDK). If higher-level characters were causing max-level enemies to spawn while not contributing, I'd have more reason to side with you on this. &lt;&lt; I think this is location dependent, but there is definitely level caps for each regardless of character level. We'll have to see how f\*\^#'d this gets when One Wasteland changes everything though.
---
*Signed, a high-level character that only does chip-damage on enemies at events and is equally pissed at tryhards 1-shotting everything w/ Explosive Gauss shotguns.*
---
You can't roll TSAA or TSF. They're all slot 1
---
That's another issue. 
---
That people just decide that the symbol is inherently racist. 
---
Hate groups co-opt and hijack symbols of all sorts. Especially Christian. That doesn't make the symbol inherently racist or hateful. 
---
Context does matter.
---
Are there supposed to be 9? Cause I’m only seeing 5 today
---
u need at least 3 in CHR tho (and get to share lvl'd up depending on ur CHR, eg 6 = level 2 card, 15 = lvel 5 card
---
I use this very map 😅 it's pretty good tbf
---
Mostly this has been my experience.  However, I have made some new friends through the team system, the most recent just last night.
---
Ty
---
In the words of Todd "The God" Howard...
---
"It just works"
---
Whenever I do this event, it just spawn ghouls for the bridge speaker and no where else. Sometimes the ghouls don't even appear for the bridge speaker at all! So I just stand there the entire event an get rewards when the timer ends.
---
Yep, the light does work. Its very cool and I really like the look on the helmet.
---
Congrats on the jetpack!
---
The red rocket garage is way less budget than the log cabin, seedy shed, or train car, and insanely less than the circus trailer.
---
Yeah use a i33 lever on my main, it saves chems and bock in low level events. Better events like rumble or a lot of people at meditation, arktos- It's much better using a i50 fixer with bock and phychotats. I also carry a tse handmade for rifleman crippling, procs tormentor 4 times sort of like a ghetto enforcer shotgun.
---
Lol send me your gt.would like some extra 5.56 to add to the 50k that I already have.
---
I've had to leave and boot people for sharing rad sponge.
---
The respawn glitch is becoming a constant for me and makes me want to throw my controller across the room...... Pretty sure I'm losing out on XP and event rewards because of it.
---
He said the one at the munitions factory
---
He also said he saw a guy with 3 at his camp. You can only have 1 converter, no glitch *yet* to place more
---
LOL That was a roller coaster!
---
Oh I think we're beyond that!
---
No, the responders have a heart with an EKG waveform inside. They also use a caduceus inside an asterisk
---
Sure! Do you know how people upload images on this sub? Never figured it out haha
---
Sorry for the confusion.have a great day!
---
Pc?
---
Yeah, one time they made the neon letters cost more than they did when I first built them, and for the longest time I thought my camp was bugged until somebody told me about it.
---
Yes the terminal on the normal collectron is used to change what it collects
---
No unfortunately you can only have one collectron active at a time.
---
Never did I know I needed something so badly... Bethesda, make it so.
---
Sorry, but you're off base here. 
---
The symbol in no way represents the hate group hijacked Celtic Cross. Nor does the context of the setting or themes of the game in any way support even the most passing notion that this crosshair was meant to be a Celtic Cross.
---
Not even close. People should be aware of and help end systemic racism and hate....
---
This is not that. This is looking for skin head conspiracies in a video game so someone can feel morally righteous. Which does nothing for anything but the person making or supporting these claims..
---
weekend
---
Not to burst your bubble but the game can't even render as fast as we can sprint.  Even if we get vehicles it will be a total shit show no one wants to deal with.
---
They need to git gud
---
I'm here because I've noticed that too, hopefully they fix it soon.
---
For line in the sand, you should be glitching the spawn anyways
---
2 shot automatic tesla
---
"You have mutations?  Ad victoriam, and arrivederci, freak!"
---
Believe me, I know it's low considering I found a party that took out a scorch beast queen. No, haven't played since the wastelanders update. And I didn't know about pacifist mode. Makes a few things make sense now. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Congrats! Thats a nice roll.
---
Always amazes me how people misunderstand things about this game.
---
Dude, really?
---
At the end of the day fireflies as they currently stand don't make enough light.  Saying they could make a variant that does doesn't change that.
---
It's like me saying "Deathclaws can't fly" and you responding with "well the *could* make a flying Deathclaw if they wanted therefore your statement is incorrect."   Obviously anything is possible if you're going to make up new lore/creatures on the spot to explain it.
---
No. They were keeping the extra 2 challenges. That would be insane to have double score for the next 6 weeks
---
Yeah I have to repair it after every event cuz each shot counts as at least 3 hits in regards to condition degradation. But it's worth it.
---
Is there a spreadsheet with values on item budget?
---
I'm convinced the whole "You'll now find Ward, Wren and Rocksy in one location" thing was just to give Ward some more "excitement"!
---
Yeah, I went to a workshop yesterday, fully built up with structures and such.  It said it wasn't owned, so I took it.  The level 300 wasn't happy when he showed up.
---
Sometimes people do not know who it is for. If I see things dropped and no one was using the “come here” emote I think it is just a discard and I pick it up for script. If someone gave me an angry or thumbs down emote I’d probably get the idea and drop what I picked up though.
---
Yeah, I wish the blue print and structures were just a little more fleshed (flushed?) out. I have that problem when finding flatland for my farm, they’re impossible to move
---
This worries me more than just bad coding.....
---
This would be good. It'd mean that anybody looking for help with a particular quest could easily explain that to their teammates. There were definitely a couple where I wished I could easily ask for help.
---
They have a lot more. They just didn't have any other space themed crap on the backlog
---
I've experienced the same - *sometimes* it works exactly like I'd expect, yet other times enemies can spot me no matter what. It *shouldn't* be the servers, though - updates should be the same regardless - though I wonder if it could have something to do with how things load in when you first join a server?
---
That's not quite what I was asking. I wanted to know if the normal collectron can collect what the raider collectron collects if I own both.
---
You are correct, that is the weekly cycle. What that has to do with a weekend event, I'm not sure.
---
dont do it. It permanently takes up your camp budget even when you get rid of them
---
I wouldnt risk exploiting f76, specially now.
---
yeah thx :)
---
Haha luckily I run an explosive weapon right now so already have this!
---
It should be able when you buy it from the atomic shop. Sorry misread your initial comment
---
Oof!!! My chest piece is just 1 star Vang
---
i didn't move my camp at all just placed it back down and the structure won't sit right anymore
---
Except the number of brine shrimp in a pond. You've got...never mind. There are no brine shrimp in this pond.
---
Yes, and a Celtic cross next to a black skull with the words "You must die"... Is much different than a Celtic cross next to traditional Celtic garb/food/instruments
---
No worries. Thanks for replying.
---
We discussed this in post about two weeks ago. Their drop rate has changed. Since that time (about two weeks) I and some others have found 2 in the wild. So they still exist, just not 10 a day.
---
Food build OP right now. Git gud shitter
---
Hate mail wtf is up with that can you elaborate
---
I had a line in the sand a couple of days ago where people didn't do the tent glitch. I'd forgotten what a fun event it is to do normally.
---
learnt all the mods already. I’ve been grinding it since september 2019. almost a year :/
---
grinding we go. tks, m8.
---
How does it feel when you die because swapping weapons hitches your game? Having too many weapons is a bad thing.
---
You realize deaf people play video games as well?
---
Oh well that’s unacceptable lol, I’m sorry
---
That is intersting, never heard of it. I will look for it online, see if I can find more info on that. Thanks
---
So u want npcs to play for you?
---
So.... do events auto start when you fast travel into them?  I'm a noob and was trying to get exp earlier.  I saw an event with 2 other players around it.  When i fast travelled in, it seemed to start right away.  Or maybe I just got the notification about it starting because I joined?
---
(I'm not a level 70 and am not an asshole in game, nor use voicechat, so OP's friend wasn't me at least :))
---
My guess it would make it way too easy to use mules
---
Yes  because I dont visit my camp to often
---
Try to relog.
---
It hurt itself in confusion.
---
"you must die" next to a black skull just made me want to ask the question. Thanks for your opinion
---
Oh, yep, it needs updated. Because mothman billboards are currently 13 fu, but I don't think they should be more than 4. Lights are 2. 🤔
---
" I’m not sure if this has been suggested before.." Rest assured it has been suggested before.  
---
Yes it is a desperately needed feature.  Other MORPG games for the last 20 years have been able to figure out this concept but Bethesda has not manged to do so.
---
Yeah, the higher level people not participating isnt a huge deal, its jusy annoying having to constantly run past AFK people to rush between the hopper and the front console. If youre gonna be a lazy turd, at least stay out of the way of people actually participating!
---
Just did, the ones that were missing were auto completed. FML
---
No your "even if the intentions were innocent bit" came well after people started pointing out that your assumption, clearly made, in your OP was wrong, unfounded, and absurd. 
---
Also, there is a huge difference between not glossing over the history of racism in things like media and Boateng display of hate symbols. 
---
So your point about tales is moot.
---
I was going to aim for anything instigating or AA for those one hit kills
---
I have an AA explosive Handmade for SBQ
---
Did you read the original post?
---
If they raised the stash limit less people would do giveaways lol
---
Sorry about that :( But there is still time to finish the Run without atoms.
---
Except it's not a Celtic Cross. 
---
Get over it. You were wrong. You went reaching for moral outrage and got called on it.
---
The event is broken and the extractors do nothing.
---
On xbox, you thinking of selling? :)
---
It..was...a..joke....r/whoosh
---
This one, but some are not accurate anymore. 
---
I have 4 in CHR for the lone wanderer perk
---
I have a Hunter's Telsa that I whip out during SBQ fights when she lands. The weapon perk helps the actual fight, and it also tags all those minions she calls for some sweet stinky XP.
---
Most people spike with nukashine!
---
Yeah I’m not too worried, I’m at rank 64 so I think I can miss a few.
---
It’s just Bethesda being Bethesda.
---
Why back in my day I could get  a billboard, a fully filled display and 6 nuka cola lights for  two flamingos and a firm hand shake.
---
sure I do the same on my private. That makes sense. But I play alone even on public and I still get into the biggest group I can, even if I ignore them, just for the bonus.
---
haha I got an original joke for you...Fortnite...bad! hahahahahahaha!!!!!
---
Deathclaw Island isn't just a clever name, FYI.
---
What do skeet shooter and enforcer do? 
---
Genuinely have no idea what perks there are for shotguns other than the obvious Shotgunner ones
---
My main is full
---
Bloodied commando. 2525 handmade and fixer although I can’t make my mind up between those and the 5025 versions I also have. First world problems lol. That build with those guns wipes the floor with everything.
---
The key is to have a vampire fifty lol. I did that once to see if I could tank it, short answer is yes, long answer is only if you don't get to ballsy and stand still cause getting hit by its melee and immediately blasted afterwards is respawn lol
---
Edit I realize it was a lmg not a fifty, I have since switched to a fifty and it's fire rate is I believe enough lower to make it dubious at best
---
Look 1 post above you
---
Yes. And you can say "innocent coincidence" and still clearly, by the titling , and your comments make it clear that's in no way what you thought it was.
---
To curb inflation and remove caps from the economy. Caps are generated out of thin air constantly, there needs to be a mechanism to remove them.
---
Deathclaw island, Hopewell Cave, Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02
---
Ok
---
Honestly I use very little ammo. If you don’t kill any robots the end stage has very few mobs spawn. The less you kill the less security gets involved. Chinese stealth suit, sneak cards, pick lock cards, hacker cards, bypass the reactor room, turn off the laser turrets, and sneak thru to the end. I can do one in ~15 this way.
---
This kinda post is why we can’t do anything. Gotta take everything personally
---
Yep, it's a bug. Even happens sometimes in nuclear winter, and there is 1000 times worse
---
Na people would just have more stuff before doing them.
---
BSS and plenty of melee meat makes any melee weapon a god roll
---
Shotgun. I chose this before knowing how op it is because I suck outside of vats and a shotgun means im close enough range wise that I can't miss. I've improved so much outside of vats since then but I still love shotgunning for that satisfying roar of the gun, flying shells, and the fun of going guns blazing.
---
anyone gonna say that it is elder maxons coat
---
Yup got some serious work to put in for those sweet 20 atoms!
---
See my post just a minute ago :)
---
it was black and nearly identical to the existing roof.
---
Herd Mentally totally works with a group of 1, even on a private server.
---
I started a public group yesterday so my brother and I could play together and get the xp bonus. We were also talking on mic. I didn't want to deal with anyone else. We could have switched mics to a playstation party and then grouped up with randoms, but we didn't want to.
---
This.
---
Bloodied bowman. There's just something so satisfying about screaming "YOU HAVE FAILED THIS WASTELAND!" as I put one right in their knee.
---
You didn't ask the question. Read the title of you post. 
---
You can try to disguise it however you want. You were trying to manufacture outrage over something that was nothing.
---
This makes sense. Thank you!
---
Great information. Now to see how many people post today asking for it, instead of actually reading the sub.
---
I'm a dark type though
---
WOW thanks!!
---
To defeat the purple you must become the purple
---
I can understand that but when I get booted from a public group I just rejoin it. One time I rejoined the same group 20 times in less than 5 minutes because they kept kicking me. I was like...sorry buddy this is a public group you can't stop me from rejoining. Eventually the leader just gave up and let me stay.
---
Lol so you encumbered him more with a gun. Lol if he doesn’t know the game he might just scrip it
---
Or if you are a PC Chad, run two instances of the program with 2 accounts.
---
You can play with yourself using autowalk.
---
Calm down, champ
---
Good, honestly I want some more Vault 76/ Vault Tec content
---
There's another Deathclaw spawn near Rippers Ally. When spawned in there's a path to your left, follow it and there's ba level 41 Deathclaw.
---
well known glitch, I see it several times a week.
---
Totally using this. Thank you!
---
I also like to place the whitespring sign over the top of a large weapon display, so it gives the gun a nicer background and place small weapon displays with the fancy pickaxe Pilsener frame/sign (from the fancy bar set) infront, it ends up hiding the weapon rack and just displays the weapon with the mirror back in what looks like a wall display case
---
I have mine on a WV bear table next to the Stashbox in my Vendor building. Sometimes, I can't keep it filled, and other times, it stays.
---
I put a sign up "Free drinks No Shine" and don't put Shine in it. The way I see it, it costs me more to make Shine than it's worth to prank someone else when I can just drink it myself and see where I end up.
---
It had explosive as a second star so I hope that’ll tell him it’s a good gun to keep. I also told him to do some inventory management afterwards.
---
(bethesda releases a meat grinder door)
---
It's a bug, and it happens in 76 pretty often.
---
All the CC skins are sitting in the files, unused.
---
Jeez, bit dodgy of them letting that continue when they know full well what a precious commodity they’ve made ammo in this game
---
You mean you can put not nukashine in the punch bowl?!
---
Supposedly on PTS they're working on fixing the technical data glitch that ends up getting stacks of unusable and unredeemable technical data that just keeps piling up in your inventory so maybe once that's addressed spawn rate can return to whatever rate it is actually supposed to be at.
---
Never got the flirty dialogue, story was pretty neat in my opinion but I didn't get bugged dialogue so yeah cmom Bethesda. I just wish Beckett would sell beer and shite to other players
---
CC files?
---
If you have the "Queen of the Hunt" Daily, there is a good chance to get a Deathclaw spawn as part of the activity.
---
Yesterday I took what I thought was an unclaimed workshop, and had no idea it was owned until I claimed it and 'contested' popped up. whoops.
---
I was told to use the overseers cache at her camp since most new players will wander that way.
---
TS Gauss shotgun, hip fire hits everything in the room lol
---
So they can be in charge of the group
---
Oh does that share? I figured that was a solo loot experience I will start to use that!
---
Next time sit on the console so no strangers can start it. That’s what my crew does, let’s it sit there til we’re fine with a group that can do it. I mean we can 2 man in our group, can’t solo because we’re almost all bloodied lol
---
There are addons?!
---
It was just a guess besides saying 'it's a bug' 
---
There are countless different visual bugs that make players invisible, stretched, wrong textures, etc. This is most likely one, but I just threw out another possibility
---
Also, if you play the game enough you know it's called stealth boy and not stealth bot
---
I love that if a challenge takes more than 10 seconds.... It's garbage.
---
omg thank you so much!
---
I barely do events, other than to complete the daily. I usually run around The Whitespring all day and find most of my legendaries there. Multiple times two three stars in the same room at the same time. Twice in the same day last week. This week I found 3 bobbleheads in a row on the same day. I'm sure super mutants offer more XP but between that and the crafting stations/vendors being so close, I just can't seem to leave the place.
---
I would love a gun like that.
---
That would mean that those within a group have a common goal, besides the bond.
---
In 99% this isn't true.
---
I just scrapcript 3 of those. Ahhhh
---
there should be two in The abandoned waste dump, and one at DC island.
---
So that's what was going on when I played this event last night. Pretty awesome. Several of us would tag the mob with our auto tesla rifles, and then someone else would finish them with a plasma grenade. So much quick XP.
---
Yeah I agree. I just thought it was funny to think about nothing but clowns running around the wasteland
---
cool as shit
---
Before I was high enough level to even find where to drop them, I would collect them like mad. Because FO4 gave you caps/xp for each one found. Imagine my disappointment when I showed up with 270 of them. :(
---
Rule 1, don't immediately start the event as soon as it spawns. It gives you like an 8 min timer, give it at least 5 and hopefully more people show up. It's best with about 4 people.
---
One on each side handling the waves, one with friendly fire killing off any ghouls that speed past and healing the NPCs, and one excavator PA or hazmat suit ore collector.
---
It could really be the difference of just a few feet in game. 
---
I've had blueprints stopped because just the roof tiles wouldn't fit. 
---
Find a small ledge, or rock, or something in the immediate area. Put your camp there. Gain the extra few feet. See if it works.
---
I am trying to collect as many plans as I can so yes please have a better method of sorting that..
---
While they are doing that can they fix "AID" as well? that is just a dumping ground of well.. can they eat it? Put it there... but.. there are to many things that don't make sense...
---
Yes, that are the cards that are meant to be shared, i do share those too. 
---
But i hate it when people share cards, which are affecting VATS behavior
---
[Cost of Camp Items (in Flamingo Units) for those interested!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eo80ev/so_we_found_out_the_exact_cost_of_every_camp_item/)
---
Si, plus can’t forget that weapon/armor grind, right? At least I can use my friends character to transfer items my other character needs.
---
Do them on your private server if you have one
---
Lol at the salty people who downvoted, it’s like some people in this subreddit just want this game to be the worst version of itself. Not only did you point out the issue you offered a thoughtful solution. Thanks OP.
---
Also would make sense to increase camp budget. While we know from unlimited budget glitches, camps can cause performance loss, we also know that the cap is *way* too low. What good is adding more options to build and organizing the menu if we will continue to be so limited.
---
I do wear a mask you ignoramus a real mask that has a seal, but as you are too ignorant to even read you wouldn't have read that in my previous replies to this stupid thread that does not belong here.
---
Not really sure why I am typing this, you can't read.
---
Its just people not understanding even the most basic of economic basics.
---
Because my friends have logged in and I want to team up with them
---
It's not that complicated
---
I just assumed they were all on different lines for advertising reasons. If all like items are in the same line then the atom shop items won’t get shoved in my face every time I open the build menu...
---
deathclaw island,  then server hop?
---
periodic PSA's on here and on the various d**cords?
---
Its already pretty challenging just to find one but to arbitrarily make it harder by having to kill 3, lol. 
---
Google the locations and pray they haven't been killed yet.
---
Go to Deathclaw island. Kill Deathclaw. Hop server. Kill Deathclaw. Hop Server. Kill Deathclaw.
---
Report players you see with these. It's an exploit, and everyone doing it knows that. Until Bethesda fixes it and mass-bans these folks, reporting is the best way to deal with them.
---
Easier than killing 3 legendarys. At least there's set spawns for them
---
Super easy dude. One on the Deathclaw island, one in Hopewell Cave, one at Thunder Mountain Substation. Do them on a private server if you have one for 100% spawnrate
---
that is OK, but that cache is small and there is only one on the map. people are often going to train stations to sell crap and exchange legendaries.
---
Few thousands was high? The highest I seen was the power armor jet pack for 2000 gold bullion.
---
Right now, we have a vehicle in the game. 
---
The vehicle have 3 points of destination and is a test for the *fast  travel* 
---
The actual mechanic is:
---
Press button on a prop on the *launch pad* 
---
Vehicle arrive and have animated entrance,  after that you use the vehicle and have 3 options of destination.
---
When reach the destination the vehicle stays some time...
---
deathclaw island yo..
---
Ya, I save the shine for myself.  It's better used for my own entertainment, not a prank.
---
at first I thought that too, and for some that is clearly the case. But there are so many times that it happens and 30 minutes later I'll check on the guy who left and he's still solo in his group. And I just shrug and wonder what they could possibly be thinking they've gained by leaving.
---
There are two high level deathclaws in Abandoned Waste Dump in the More.
---
Edit: Mire, thanks autocorrect.
---
Sorry, ignorance is a pet peeve of mine.
---
I know this is sarcasm, and just making fun of all the other posts about 'hard' challenges
---
But if it isnt, deathclaw island, server hop
---
I would like it to be an effect of alcohol or drugs.
---
Booze and drugs are pretty boring in this version of the game, except for Nukashine.
---
And it wouldn't be lore/immersion breaking, as the effect is only seen by you - it's not "real" it's a drunk/high hallucination.
---
I'd love to see all the intoxicants have different visual effects - just nothing that's blurry or nauseating.
---
I know the locations and I know you can server hop. Thats not my point at all. My point is when everyone is doing it killing one is hard enough even with multiple locations. 
---
Not everyone has fallout 1st either.
---
Fissure sites, I got it done in about 5 min. Scorch beasts seems to spawn as legendary pretty often.
---
that is totally logical.
---
It could be the mail box found in a datamine long ago!
---
Run around and kill all of the bush wooks. 
---
It's all about the damage and mobility perk cards. Hipfire cards are good too. When you first start out you'll be at a major disadvantage to high levels with their good perk cards.
---
You ever tried to craft 10 of the same thing in a row? You can’t seriously say there is no lag in the crafting menu.
---
\*laughs in photograph an alien\*
---
Bethesda is selling skins for the stairs. Why would they include nice looking ones by default? They want to make money. I'm sure we'll see stairs like these and The Overseer's stairs for some atoms in the future.
---
Stray Cats....Roman Holliday...
---
I guess I could build a house that says free stuff and everyone throws bags on the floor? lol

fire confetti from the great overgrown plumbus
---
It's because it sucked for a long time for all the reasons already mentioned...  It also is a multi player event, not a ton of fun alone.. HossstyleTHC Thanks for the suggestion on solo-ing it... you get tired of spending the caps to travel all the way up and no other players join... you guys sold me though, I will give it a shot again if that is where the west tec ledgendaries went 🙂!
---
I've had some weird experiences with public groups but I haven't ever had anyone be actively disruptive before. That's crazy.
---
I did have a guy once with his mic on. None of us were actually playing together, it was just a group for the communal bonus. But he kept talking over the mic to his girlfriend or something. Eventually I got tired of him and left the group (I wasn't leader) and started my own. But thats the only time I've ever had reason to leave a group.
---
That would be very funny
---
Less water = more space for dynamic enemies
---
IIRC, only Mirelurks are able to move and attack in water.
---
It would be nice if they didn't neglect the water in their games, but they always have.
---
 Here are some improvements to flesh out water without dramatic map edits:
---
- Add more Mirelurks/Hunters to lake bottoms
---
- Add a lot more submerged loot (legendary in container)
---
- Significantly reduce base holding breath in water safety duration 
---
- Add Endurance scaling to holding breath in water
---
- Add more waterborne diseases, increase rate
---
- Add "rebreather" mask item
---
- Move Aquaboy to Legendary Perks, make it tiered, or retool as a mutation 
---
- Replace Diver's (waterbreathing) legendary effect with "hold breath in water longer"
---
Honestly death claw island needs more death claws roaming around. Makes it more of a threat and not just that one lonely ass death claw in his little hole.
---
Bug as others have said, mainly with shotguns.
---
They are under Machined Guns, not Machine Guns.
---
Anyone saved up for the nuclear gift?  5000 candy
---
Skip the challenge if it's too hard. Hell, skip the entire Legendary Run if you aren't able to do it.
---
i tried swearing and throwing rocks at the sun, but all that did was make my neighbors hate me
---
Why? Because it is to hard for you to complete lol.
---
Yes, forgot that.
---
Also checked, Alcohol is a separate buff, so you can also use a +1 STR drink, one of the teas
---
Yeah the downvoted crack me up but don’t bother me.
---
For line in the sand.. TS explosive pump shotgun, shoot the ground 4-8 times when the scorch spawn in the middle then reload, profit your three new levels and tons of score points and 1500lbs or weapons and junk when you’re done
---
Radiation rumble depends on who shows up I’ll either just spray everything with a vampires ultracite Gatling laser so I get some xp or again TS exp pump shotgun with enforcer so I can break all their legs and cripple them so I don’t have so much work to do defending while trying to collect ore
---
Consume?
---
Well.. Common knowledge / no news here. As it is not just tea. It is tea alcohol mix. You can even get alcohol addiction from it.
---
That was an actual challenge ?
---
I keep coming back to this thread, these noobs are so greedy it’s annoying
---
Can anyone tell me does the budget increase with fallout 1st or something? I saw a guy with a fucking ridiculous mansion no way that was under budget
---
It cost 2.5k caps and Flux to start the event. It's extremely rude to just start the event on purpose with somebody else's card.
---
Took me 3 minutes to do that challenge. With loading screens.
---
Since the stairs come into The Atomic Shop, I've been hoping for more vault related CAMP items so I can build a CAMP glitched under the map and be somewhat lore friendly.
---
Med-Short range, I use a 2-shot tesla to tag stuff and not kill them. One down side is to not spray too much, as it can trigger the rubberbanding, no damage dealt bug (same with explosive legendary weapons) Seems to me that if I try to tag too many things in too short of a problem, the server flips out and that bug kicks in.
---
Oops. Fat fingers.
---
Hahah. No problem. Great tip though!
---
"oh wow... kill 3 deathclaws challenge. what should I do?"
---
"I can go on youtube and find deathclaw's spawn locations so I can complete this challenge within 5 minutes"
---
"Nah, I'm gonna create post on reddit to bitch about how unfair Bethesda is"
---
much ado about nothing.. it respawns liberally...
---

---
Most events you have to talk to, pick something up, etc. to actually start an event. If you are the first one to say radiation rumble you have like 8 minutes to talk to whoever it is and after doing so will trigger the event to start. A lot of people will wait those 8 min so that others can join. Of course the SBQ fight is triggered as soon as the nuke falls. These are public events there are also just regular events those are the hexagons with no exclamation marks. These will trigger as soon as you are in an area to trigger it and you don’t have to feel bad about starting those because they will still be available for others to do if they come across the same area.
---
Wow I’m really happy for you 😑😘
---
What am I reading?
---
Bloodied unarmed/melee. 
---
The why is because I find it humorous to punch everything and have it be effective. Also ammo is of little concern so that's a lot of weight I don't have to worry about. 
---
With talons and when explosive fist comes out I get to punch people and have them blow up.
---
I mean... I still keep a gatling plasma on me just in case... but it's not my preferred weapon.
---
bethesda: "Hey, take our flying taxi!"
---
(Vertibird bugs out, drops players right into fissure)
---
Bethesda: "working as intended!"
---
Damn wait until you run into the people that are perked out for explosives. Handmades will be the least of your issues.
---
As a level 14 with all the mutations, Brahman milk can remove rads without removing mutations. Just avoid rad away.
---
I play Planetside 2 a lot and literally spent 3 hours in a sniping duel with one other person on the opposing faction. It was probably the most fun 3hrs of gaming I've ever had. We would message each other what our base location was when the fights moved on. So some people like that.
---
I agree!
---
ty for the great advice.I'll start looking for the god weapons mentioned by you and others
---
What I’m hearing is I can have a bunch a flamingoes in my camp.... TIME TO REBUILD!
---
(squeezes right trigger, chair moves forward)
---
i'll be damned
---
I've stayed away so far.
---
Well in my situation, the person giving away the items had a mic, told the people “one at a time”.  The greedy party grabbed theirs, tried to grab another, then blocked the last person who was meant to receive something..
---
You’re welcome. :)
---
I would be happy if they highlighted where the new things are the first time you look through, either the category itself or the little box within each category. It wouldn’t be that hard to do. 
---
So annoying trying to figure out where something is and then endlessly scrolling left and right to finally spot it. Is it an appliance or a miscellaneous items and forget the wall and floor decorations, that’s enough to make someone want a shot after that aggravation.
---
Wierd, Ive never gotten addicted to alcohol from drinking that. Maybe I would need to drink more. Anyway, just thought people might want to know this, specially those of us who dont carry alcohol on us on a regular basis.
---
It would appear so.
---
vanguard armor?
---
Im pretty sure it still reduces cost of building. When i swap to that roof i can get another 3-4 wall tiles in.
---
I don't think Bethesda does it this way, but it should be based on texture size and poly count, and given a numerical rating.
---
But if it was, it might still be just as counterintuitive, since some things are way more or less detailed than you might expect. I've noticed some absurdly low res textures recently. Like, check some of the trees in the Forest, and they're crazy detailed. Now look at strangler trees in the Mire...they're consistently crap!
---
Note, I'm running maxed out at 4k, so YMMV.
---
This is what I will be doing.  Private server, slap tent down at death claw island.
---
I use a [Non-Addicted Full Health Sneaky Vats-Crit Rifleman](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6b445ce&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72lr2pp0pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1l71ao0ar0p00sv0sb0lk2lb0an1&amp;w=p80p90c52ij2i42iq2pa0lm0ed3i30ia0i50if2ik0&amp;m=5c8&amp;am=-13-1f-1321-1d&amp;wp=w5w5w5w5&amp;wm=1a2936-1124-17-1d) that is similar to this.. YMMV
---
There is a ton of players that go to this with no intention of completing the event.  They go to loot ghouls and kill ledgendaries..  try to go when several other 
---
players are there and you will get it .. if you have trouble staying alive try to find an out of the way spot to tag ghouls and ledgendaries and let the less squishy and high damage players kill them for you, do your part but don't hang yourself out there so much.. one looting of the chems and you will get it..
---
thats how mirelurks are made....
---
Add CuningLinguist if you want to team up. Just hit 185 on my main and for all the names on my friends list only ever see those shadows light up let alone actually game.
---
Had three at Radiation rubble the other day.
---
... And two at the end of the castle hurding one.
---
That’s been my experience the last few times too. Plus no legendaries.
---
And why is this event ranked for players level 25? The mobs are like 62 feral ghouls which will bum rush and kill a level 25 so quickly.
---
now i understand why we all cough in my house.....
---
Unfortunately I’m also a shotgunner or a heavy weapon, I also use the card that reduces ammo weights, I don’t have enough room to fit a rank 3 traveling pharmacy
---
only thing thats changed on budget was them lowering certain items and you would get more 'budget allowance'
---
No objects should affect the server--only client GPU load. That is, unless it does things like workbenches or the ammo converter.
---
You’re a fucking liar
---
So you’re really saying I should scrap my house and live in the garage.
---
As far as I'm aware, taking the herbivore serum while having the carnivore mutation will not do anything.
---
Yup, this event absolutely sucks alone as a melee build. Just sprinting back and fourth
---
No. You have to remove the mutation. Unequip starched genes and take radaway. That will remove any mutations you have. Unfortunately, if you have more that one mutations, you will probably lose them before you are successful in removing carnivore. If you’re in PS4 I can help you replace any you lose. I sell mutation serums for 175 caps.
---
Would be nice to be able to sell items while not online
---
I wonder how many Flamingos my C.A.M.P. Is
---
Any explosive gun will work .. any bow or crossbow with the flame frame will work even regular old frag grenades will work if you can time them it’s the tagging you want in a crowd of people shooting at a mob just tag everything that moves in the mob if there’s lots of others there firing too it’ll make it easier to soak up massive xp and there are buffs that give more intelligence for more xp
---
It does lower the hit chance for shotguns, if you don't kiss the enemy.
---
Whiskey is also used to craft grape mentats.
---
Honestly it's an ugly roof, only reason I got it was for the budget usage - which was fixed.
---
Making it an ugly, 'useless' roof.
---
The trees and floors from the bundle were nice though.
---
Thank you! I found them all in said places without a server hop
---
Thank you very much
---
Bloodied melee - at first I did not want to go bloodied but jeez man, bloodied builds are just too op to pass up, especially with all the perks, mutations, and unyielding armor.
---
It's so fun to rush up or VATS teleport and SLAM an enemy with my bloodied power fist or use vampire Mr Handy Buzzblade to mess around and stay alive forever. Even tho I'm playing close range with \~50HP, my dude is an absolute tank. 370 DR / 470 ER / 41 RR. Dense armor for 50% explosion reduction, blocker for 45 melee reduction, and dodgy for 30% reduction (and I have about 380 AP, so no real AP problems). The only threats that can kill me are rads or poison type damage
---
This looks great, I'm sure I can work with this/tweak it a bit to suit her needs. What would the best legendary prefix be? Was thinking AA or instigating, but heard TS could be decent as well.
---
I stand half corrected then thank you.
---
I'm not even going to lie, I think this should be in game. "You have 4,000 flamingos" And then every item gives a flamingo number when you select to place it.
---
Why? There are three well-known spawn points.
---
1) Deathclaw Island
---
2) Hopewell Cave
---
3) Thunder Mountain Substation (north of Watoga)
---
THANK YOU FOR USING THE FLAMINGO SCALE!
---
I think this is how they are increasing the budget with the new items making them a lower value.
---
I wonder if they're aware that some perks are still inactive though, like Strange in Numbers (which with a mutated team member to activate it, combined with carnivore/herbivore, xp food, and egghead... accounts for a total of about 25% more xp).
---
You can fuck right off. Go back to twitter.
---
I am always too scared to stay because I don't want to rebuild my own home.
---
Honestly I just wish there was a 3rd option when that happens, 
---
Stay
---
Leave
---
Go back to menu / Join a friends server
---
Congratulations Elder, welcome to the club.
---
It's like turning in too many collectibles at once to madam nazar
---
All shared limb mods...
---
- Pocketed 
---
- Deep Pocketed
---
- Lighter Build
---
- Ultra-light
---
- Lead Lined
---
- Strengthened
---
...Were omitted by a lazy dev. Not intentional.
---
We have finally bitched enough to get the Pocketed and Deep Pocketed added to PTS for Patch 21. However, they did not take the time to enable the other 4. KEEP BITCHING.
---
Absolutely agree there.  This needs to happen.  The interior doors auto-close after a pause at the Whitespring, so we know they have the technology.
---
If you change servers, or have to swap because your CAMP position is taken, you will lose the icons until you restart the game.  
---
It doesn't cost you to go there, it's still free but the icons will vanish if you change server.
---
How do you know that?
---
Without reading too far into it, the whole narrative for what we're doing sounds like it's laid out like a movie serial, but what if in reality it's a propagandist plot to make you exterminate them for some ulterior motive? The Enclave operates under the guise of being the remnants of the US government but they're shady AF. I'm sure they're dazzling us with cool toys like glow-in-the-fucking-dark wallpaper and spaceman skins and armor just so we can carry out their sick and twisted plot. Either way, I'm loving every minute of it!
---
No tradeoff. The person who set it up was lazy as shit. CMs already confirmed the omissions were not intended.
---
Tradeoff on Jetpack is only the case if you build the jetpack.  The DR/ER is a honey pot, as the extra protection is negligible.
---
They don't even have a unique model or paint scheme or anything! It's literally just lines of code - this could be done TOMORROW
---
my wife and I do leader of the pack, I use the Vox that I never turned in, she shoots the purple one, everyone gets a medal
---
player hub.
---
a place to gather. 
---
maybe ‘rentable’ vending machines. beth loves cap sinks so beyond those 10% tax of every sale you could pay an extra to rent those vandi g machines, idk, another 10 or maybe 5%.
---
a no nuke zone, so maybe not top of the world, or an interior cell. a free fast travel spot.
---
a place with lots of benches. scrapbox. stashbox. a decon arch and a radpond or a radbarrel. beds. music instruments...
---
people would hang around a place like this... and shop!
---
Can you link the current build?
---
I would use something like this (four points left over for whatever):
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f115fe&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pp2pl2ar2an2ao0a32a72a01lt2lk2lu2lv2l71ic4
---
With a instigating lever action should one to two shot everything that’s not a boss.
---
That has to be illegal,must be a bug
---
I always go to the substation with new weapons to see how long it takes to kill the death claw. PSA don't try it with a buzz blade I don't care if it's god rolled you will die.
---
Radiation Rumble spawns a bunch of deathclaws when people collect the ore.
---
killing mobs.. preferably at events so you get that event bump also...
---
-eta: guided meditation, uranium fever, SBQs, encryptids... any event or area with massive amounts of mobs is where you want to be.. the higher level the better obviously...
---
If you want actual alcohol just go see Tannin in the WS, and don’t forget to equip Professional Drinker in Endurance to avoid addiction.
---
Being able to clear out the valuable but niche minigun no one is buying from your stash would help a lot. Especially if you can find what the same item has sold for and price it accordingly.
---
[dude](https://youtu.be/RL1Vcn8yX1g)
---
Server hop at deathclaw island, prefer this one to 3 legendaries.
---
Cool!
---
Negate the meta? Let's just wait for the rebalance and go from there.
---
If you nuke Foundation everyone puts on hazmat suits.
---
Friends.
---
We’ve grouped with one of these people before and it was a shitshow. 
---
Open mic breathers.
---
Kill 1st deathclaw at deathclaw island, go to your private server, kill 2nd deathclaw at deathclaw island, fast travel to Thunder Mountain substation TM-02 and kill 3rd deathclaw. Actually i think it took less that 3 mins. Just because you are new to this game does not mean others are too.
---
Thank you
---
Probably clearing buildings and horde events.
---
Keep complaining or they will never fix it for us. I won't even *unlock* the limbs because I can't run Ultralight.
---
Yep. stay and take notes. Best thing you can do.
---
Hit rank 70 last night. Double score event definitely helped just bummed it's now back to normal but nevermind, the grind continues lmao
---
Im curently recording the same player still cheating away with reckless abandon
---
The joys of measuring in FUs is a continual joy and delight to me. The genius of that unit of measurement can never be understated.
---
yup, weekly challenge to photograph a flatwoods monster, might also have needed to wear a astronaut outfit, also had to photo a yao gui while wearing mr fuzzy hat, do not miss those challenges :L
---
I didn't know that.  Thanks! Well, I'll keep the punch bowl full and help out my fellow wanderers.
---
Good thing he had a hazmat suit to get in a few more prayers before death.
---
Looks like that cultist next to him wasn't as lucky.
---
Who cares? Why is there a million posts on this everyday. People post how to do it then people say to report. Who cares? I can craft so much ammo I don’t care if people have these. Its not hurting no one or nothing
---
 Joining a public group is the same as a private group in regards to "lone wanderer"
---
I didn't even try and did it. Scorched earth fight provided.
---
Collect ore in Radiation Rumble?
---
Collect food before and protect the animals in Project Paradise?
---
Kill the adds on the SBQ?
---
Don’t stand in fire, kill the adds, refocus boss, spread apart, don’t tunnel, drop the debuff outside of mel- oops sorry, channeling when I would RL from WoW....
---
Fallout 4 Creation Club.
---
No I understood you were making a joke about the fact that for people without disabilities there are already mics and headset that can be used to talk to each other about what’s going on.  Try not to be hyper sensitive just because someone points out that there are people who that won’t work with.
---
Well not sure what to say bout that....at least its something
---
because you touch yourself at night
---
That hurt
---
Do you know if Inspirational works with a group of 1? It says 'when you're on a team, gain 15% more xp', so I guess it does?
---
Could be one of two bugs that I am aware of.
---
If the mob doesn't move around and just stands there, it's completely unkillable.
---
If this is a normal mob moving around and hitting you, it's the rubberbanding health bug. You have to server hop to clear it. If you don't want to server hop, melee still works.
---
I just bought 5 wines from Beckett at my camp
---
I’ve been lucky enough to not experience this but I make sure I am not in ten minutes before. I never had it before seasons but I def don’t want it to happen now. I’m level 66 and don’t want it to flow up
---
Wrong. I touch myself always.
---
It took me less than 2 minutes to complete
---
I dont remember what her build was, I can check when I get home. But it was pretty bad with mostly strength/perception and then mixed pretty even on all other SPECIAL stats.
---
Thanks.
---
Smart. Though I have the wanderer on my camp
---
Be that as it may, it's still a stupid reason and I disregard any wrong in the blinding of people who may have watched me touch myself to confirm this as the reason
---
Lol I wish I could agree with you that Bethesda is clearly a white supremacist group but my white fragility is rendering me incapable of giving a fuck about a crosshairs symbol in a video game. Write Bethesda a letter saying it offended you and maybe they’ll take it out and apologize. Then you can move on to find the next thing that will get your panties in a wad.
---
Been suggested almost since the game came out. Central location. Make it so once you've done the quests associated with the 2nd floor are complete. Maybe level 50 requirement as well and BOOWM! instanced area to hang out in and show off your fancy outfits. Oh and also trade.
---
If you don’t mind me asking how do I display junk items like fans, bottles etc.  I always see people with them but figured they were an atom shop item when I wasn’t actively playing or something.
---
Encountered this a couple weeks ago for 2 scorched earth events. Literally would spawn within a minute or 2 of event starting and she would be dead. Only pieced it together when the ban wave occurred due to mainly playing on a private server. Proper baffled me though haha.
---
I meant Buttressed...not bolstered.
---
SE7EN
---
I call it my Jankie build = Junkie Tank. 
---
Scaly Skin and Grounded for extra DR and ER, plus Barbarian (max card w/10 STR) and max Iron Clad while wearing Vanguard Heavy BOS combat armor = ~480 DR/ 550+ ER outside of power armor. Combined with max Blocker and Ricochet for the most damage mitigation possible.
---
All that in tandem with a JE1A Handmade, and all three Commando perks maxxed for obscene damage - two taps anything below a 62 charred feral. Currently working on maximizing Demo Expert for better damage.
---
TL;DR tanky junkie build. They can’t hurt me if they’re already dead, as if they could damage me to begin with.
---
Does crafting your own alcohol not count?
---
The ammo factory?
---
I'm guessing because 2mm wasnt just an ammo the Miltary produced on a large scale. So there factories probably weren't equipped to make said ammunition. 
---
Gameplay wise I guess to make 2mm less widespread. But that's dumb as crafting 2mm or 2mm ultracite isnt hard and you can make large quantities
---
the event is really easy to solo
---
the ghouls pretty much only attack one of the machines you need to defend at a time (and its always the same one) so you can just camp that machine the entire event and kill the ghouls that come near it
---
There are free displays in the camp menu, I think it's under displays. None of the free ones look v good though but there's a few different types. The Thanksgiving one was a few hundred atoms and it's seasonal but looks a lot nicer
---
I was trying to do the same challenge and one of my team mates started following me around (as in trying to hide in the same bush he was following that close), I found a box and checked it to see there was the last stimpack I needed then I heard a gunshot so I took a quick look around to make sure I wasn't  being attacked and my team mate had fired then ran in and looted the box...I was not amused.
---
My Xbox elite series 2 has had horrible drift lately I love all the time. I gotta mess with it to fix it. Just haven’t messed with it yet
---
Definitely bandolier and traveling pharmacy
---
Yep, but I only craft bullets and legendary rolls.
---
I've run the event more than 0 times.
---
- Progress bar drains instead of progressing
---
- Progress bar drains quicker if extractors are alive
---
- Higher tier loot only drops if &gt;50%, keeping extractors alive prevents this.
---
- Event does not fail if all extractors are simultaneously destroyed
---
Bonus:
---
- Event radius reaches Whitespring Station
---
- Mole Men spawn outside the event zone door and need to be leashed back in by players
---
- Mole Man objects can be looted by other players (tin can, suit scrap)
---

---
All I have is nuka cola merch and I'm constantly maxed out. Barely any room for crafting benches 
---
Like, man, a nuka girl poster n cardboard cutout should not take up so damn much
---
Line in the sand is another great one
---
Strongback is fixed +40lbs carry weight. Bandolier and Traveling Pharmacy both have the ability to negate hundreds of pounds of your back. This is no brainer. You will constantly pick up more and more ammo and chems as you play the game and do events etc etc. They add up very fast. One stimpak alone weights 1lbs. 40lbs = 13333 .45 or 8000 5.56 ammo without bandolier, as an example.
---
They may have a point. Last time I did this event we got the "production increased" message while Charlie was damaged. Not sure for how long because we were all chasing legendary at Bravo. Still repaired Charlie when we got back to our respective posts.
---
I can literally just put any desk fan on these displays ? Kind of like I have masks in another display.
---
do a radiation rumble, line in the sand and scorched earth events and you will make tons of xp
---
The ammo crafter you get from the raiders, but I see your point, just seems a tad silly that you can do make .50 as cheap and get more but can still craft at the machine
---
You get more out of perks that reduce the weight of items rather than ones that add carry weight, so you're probably better off with Bandolier and Traveling Pharmacy. I would however suggest just keeping your aid to minimal and using Bandolier and Blocker for your few precious points in Strength.
---
I feel you there. Think this is the wrong place to be talking about glitches though 👀😁
---
So you're the reason for all those 1\* nocturnal rolling pins? Thanks, Obama.
---
Theres such a lack of legendaries outside of events, it is really demoralizing.
---
Same Im ahead of the curve.
---
If the enemy is in combat with another enemy is the only time I've seen this. Not sure why. Two factions fighting,  or mutants shooting at vertabots, equals rubberbanding or 75 percent less damage. 5200 hrs on play time.
---
Honestly, after trying to figure out how T-60 could fit into the lore, or how X-01 is now a pre-war creation, I’ve stopped bothering to piece together power armor canon.
---
says you, I can't get the dang glitch to work or it would be experience city
---
The Armco doesn't produce 2mm? Didnt know that, that's fucking stupid. I understand fusion cores, plasma cores, and explosive munitions, but 2mm? It's just lead and steel
---
Could you point him out? I've been looking for like 5 minutes and can't see him lol.
---
Bonerhood of Steel?
---
I hope they add BoS variants of every armor with the BoS update. Need BoS scout armor to really pull off my riflemen look.
---
You know you love having them just littering your inventory/CAMP.
---
Does anyone ever get the red rocket rolling door glitch? The big vertical sliding door, shows it's closed when really it's open and then when I try to open it,then it closes. 
---
I might use it again, but lock it and only use the side door lol.
---
I’ve always seen a legendary feral ghoul at R&amp;G processing
---
There's also one at Whitesprings
---
Game is odd with wording. "On a team" requires a teammate. "Grouped" or "while in a group" does not
---
I’m full health build so I just pop a nuka grape and make my way out of the storm no worries
---
I actually haven’t. So there’s my missing info! Sorry.
---
No, Fallout 1st has no effect on budget, that I know of. There have been ways to glitch the budget. You probably saw the result of one of them.
---
event group plus daily and public events + XP bonus methods.
---
Definitely! I’d be really curious if this could make caps valuable again. Normally people seem to not trade either because of the 30k max or because they usually use caps to go buy something else anyways so you’re just increasing the work that’s required. If get flux is as easy as sell your unyielding combat armor piece and then buying flux for caps i think it’s mean something to have them again. Wouldn’t even mind a slightly large cap sink if i wasn’t spending hours trying to find someone who would buy my stock.
---
I really dont think that deserved all those downvotes lol
---
If you ever have it alone just sit at one they won’t attack any other. I’ve done in numerous times
---
You can't out stim a grenade that kills you instantly...
---
I feel like we've been waiting for the rebalance forever now.  And we've even got mini-rebalances between that have in some cases made things *worse*.
---
I can't say I have much faith for whatever might be coming that we've been dragged along to believe might fix the game's combat issues.
---
I have 5 points in strenght. bandolier2 and traveling pharmacy3.
---
I am right now with a full set of solar armor, two automatic weapons, 3 small melee weapons, 200k 45 rounds, 120k 556 rounds, 250 antibiotics, 280 radshields, 50 superstims, and around another 80 assorted chems. at 170 pounds. 
---
so I’ll say it’s very good.
---
A trade hub won't be successful without a text chat.  From what I have seen the majority of players don't use mics. I personally will never use a mic but I would definitely use a text chat.
---
 You will have a building full of people emoting each other randomly because there's no way to communicate.
---
I see just as much dumb behaviour from high level players.
---
Unfortunately, no.  All you can do is sell it to a vendor for 1 cap. After I found that out I usually try to turn tech data in ASAP. 
---
Tip: When you turn in your tech data take an extra 2 mins to run north to Treetops to kill the megasloth for easy caps/XP and then further north to the stingwing spawn area. Stingwings are usually the limiting factor for the Stings N Things repeatable.
---
Nice one
---
Speaking as someone who only ever dipped their toe in raids, I'm so sorry.
---
I spent 3 weeks with a giant hole in my camp because it said I was over budget....until they finally told me I must have taken advantage of an exploit to build my camp and the only way to fix it was to delete things until I was under budget...........
---
Thanks for your input.
---
I find the quickest way to grind xp, which isn’t something I do often, is west tek. I can server hop that place 4 or 5 times at most and I’ve levelled up. Current level 240. If you find someone else outside doing the same thing, don’t server hop, just run round the back and go in the back door, I can usually clear the place out and make my way through to the closed off section before they reach the fev tanks and then they just give up and server hop leaving me to finish it off in my own speed.
---
So many new players with game pass. I don't think people even know what it is.
---
You can try posting on here next time and get some recruits before calling in the ol' imposter.
---
They generally bring something of worth to the table, unlike the level 60's who come to Encryptid with their fresh set of Excavator Armor.
---
Ah okay
---
I know right? I was perplexed that they didn't allow it to make 2mm EC but can freely make fusion cells and gamma rounds.  Perhaps it was an oversight on their end?
---
On PS4 it’s always mobbed out by at least 5 players.  Good luck next time
---
Yes. I hate it. I just took the rolling door off. 😂
---
Also if you have surrounded sound, and you are outside looking at the rolling door, the sound of the door comes from behind you. 😕
---
It just works
---
Thanks for confirming my suspension. Appreciate the input.
---
Guessing it uses the same coding as the ammo factory, just with a different texture
---
Yeah was just an example
---
your house would only be on one server and no one would know it's location of purpose.  lol.
---
I've just begun trying to get them to the other end of the map by Nukashining them..
---
And try not to point out the fucking obvious, if this was a post on enabling functionality for the impaired..do you really think I would have posted the above comment???
---
The irony is that you're passing judgement on a theme in a post that YOU created..The OP and no-one else was saying anything even remotely like that.
---
Have a nice day.
---
I thought this got updated? Has that hot fix not rolled out yet?
---
It seems like a natural conclusion with Bethesda’s focus on a central economy. Maybe now that wastelanders gave the game some sort of extended storyline with bringing back the economy it can start using that to give us control over said economy rather than just gold bullion which we never see used towards anything once it’s been traded for plans. Surely there’s a part 2 for the secret service’s gold supply once we’ve replenished it?
---
Make a run through Morgantown high every now and again, picking up every plastic pumpkin, bowling pin, kids toy, and golf ball you can and you should come out with a sizey amount of plastic every time. Plus the Scorched will drop shotgun ammo more often than not. 
---
For lead and steel the Charleston FD and Green Country Lodge both have weight rooms you can pillage, with crafting tables nearby (GCL is a little up the road but not too bad) so you can scrap it all quickly.
---
I tested it once and it definitely does.
---
Lol wtf. Well I guess at least it doesn't glitch out and sudden spawn behind us. 
---
I love the door, but for now I've had enough lol. Idk how others still use it.
---
M79s and Gauss shotguns kill me way more than VATS nades. But I guess that's because I'm too stubborn to use frog legs. I just wish explosives didn't exist, the gun fights are actually fun.
---
How cool would it look if everyone was calling in those drop pods before a queen fight with their power armor on board, it would look like a meteor shower.
---
Thanks, seems unanimous already. I’m mostly an invisible rooftop camper :). I’ll go for Bandolier and Pharmacy. Personally see no need for Blocker.
---
I’m level 200 and just did 3 solo runs for the first time this weekend as well. Congrats!
---
Ooh, not a bad idea. 👍
---
O I never said I was gonna risk it but as far as exploits go this ones not that bad cuz it requires both partys to agree and the person buying it still has to use script to buy it
---
Imagine reporting someone who isn't affecting you adversely at all.

If you get booted then it's probably to let in a friend. It's the only reason I ever boot people (and I really hate to do it).
---
Had the same thing happen to me yesterday. Started the event about 10 min after a scorched earth event. Map was loaded with high level players. Had a feed the people event start at the exact same time I put my keycard in. Everybody was after that good ole canned meat stew. Meanwhile I’m over here just trying to get a fixer plan in my 312th try...
---
You can give a struggling high level who never has time due to work some .50s?
---
 I would heart emoji the shit out of you and disappear into the night like a lady of the night. 
---
Lmfao but no seriously fuck the fortnite kids that are on FO76 they piss me off
---
Just grab some oil
---
I would say too, try to share perk cards that aren’t build specific. IE People often share Stranger in Numbers (Charisma 1 Star). Great perk! But if you need it, you already have it. Try sharing something like weight reduction, aid boosting, or anything besides else. Another good example would be like a melee card. That’s probably not going to benefit as many players.
---
I don't have 200% weapon artisan perk yet, I'm level 44 for my fifth character, automatic rifleman build.
---
I’m gonna have to do something like that aswell, they are doing my head in !!
---
Guess what we are gunna do when they catch lockjaw?
---
FWIW, on my long play stretches I have solo afk'd this event probably 10 times or so, usually on private servers.
---
Start the event, then jump on the ledge just above the right of the courtyard objective. If no one else shows up to the event, you will lose about 50% health on the bridge objective and then nothing else ever spawns.  Wait out the 7 min clock (enjoy a snack and bathroom break) and collect your treasury notes.
---
I think it might be an easter egg since the event is supposed to be all about relaxation...
---
Well, I figured it was safe given that it's not really a game changing/breaking one, however if it isn't I'll strike my statements from the record 😬
---
Don’t give stuff away. Give quests. Once they complete the quest reward them.
---
+karma
---
This guy is awsome just so everyone knows
---
They just need to add in Fireproof as a perk and it would be a completely fair and balanced weapon type
---
I'd like it if every item you can build came with a budget cost on it, so I know before wasting time &amp; resources how much space a light would take, or a rug, or a chair...
---
That's what happens when you jack off with the rusty knuckles mod
---
Can I get a run down of this “magic” you speak of?
---
I was worried about that lol. Unfortunately I'm on PC, but thanks for the offer :)
---
something like this, there are individual pixels visible.  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/73FdJpf](https://imgur.com/a/73FdJpf)
---
I am aware of most magic weapons combos. Did not know you could get something that worked on a fixer.
---
Playing with friends
---
no, that's not it.
---
Ooooooh. I was supposed to consume in the game. Makes more sense now.
---
fair lol
---
I went to an encryptid event over the weekend. A lvl 300 something started it. Multiple lvl 200+ players were there. After the first few minutes of being able to activate pylons and watching people shoot the cloaked imposter I finally decided to activate all 3 pylons myself and spam the stimpak button. 
---
So a bunch of high level players at this event isn’t always a sign that it’s going to go smoothly.
---
That reminds me how I always forget to turn on my radios in my camp
---
Do the legendary effects need to be in a certain order of can it work on lets say a explosive junkies?
---
every time I collect up a bunch of (to me) useless .38s I craft a couple of fully modded level 1 pipe guns and leave them and a bunch of ammo inside the overseer's cache at the overseer's c.a.m.p. in hopes that a struggling low level player will find them and it will make their lives a bit easier.
---
Yeah, I’ll see if I can reallocate an extra point in strength so I can get Pharmacy 3. Sounds good, thanks.
---
That could have its charm lol. I agree a limited text chat could be helpful. It can also be a bit irritating for console players that don’t own the keyboard pads. Everyone would probably have left the game before you finish your sentence. 
---
I do think that’s where maybe a more developed public team system comes in and having a central trade station that actually watches trades over all servers instead of just looking at whatever item you’re currently selling would help things along. Theoretically you could look up what the exact item you have is being sold for and you could sell for the same price or undercut that player if you’re wanting it sold quickly. RuneScape for as annoying as that game could be to childhood me had a well-developed cross-server trade hub and economy and made a pretty useless in-game city the place where probably 10-20% of each server would spend its time.
---
There is a nutcase with a gatling gun at the end of Lucky Hole mine. Farm the guns and scrap for mods.
---
Level is honestly a terrible indicator of how well-equipped someone is, because a casual player who doesn't legendary hunt can be happy in fully modded armor/weapons they crafted themselves. I was that way up till I hit 100 and finally started playing with other people.
---
If you're a solo player, you can play disconnected from this game's meta up to a huge level. Especially if you got a lot of levels back in the early days, before things like Scrip existed.
---
They should make it work like a vendor where you sell ammo for currency then spend that currency on the ammo you want
---
I'd hate to have to sacrifice a perk slot to defend myself against an overpowered weapon. I'd rather see all of the blast radius reduced drastically so you actually have to aim. I'd even be fine with VATS nades if grenades had a tiny blast radius.
---
That sounds exactly like where they are from !! Childish entitlement at play
---
Do the effects have to be in a certain order or can it work if junkies isnt it primary effect?
---
I use the backpack mod for chems in place of the traveling pharmacy.
---
I feel that everything in this list is a reasonable expectation/just common decency - except for the bit about weapon pricing, its not taking your stash space or your caps if you don't buy it
---
tbh I'm sure mid level players would like you to have your own "veteran" server too at this point, the game needs balancing badly and not every event should need a level 200+ carrying it and expecting everyone else to be greatful, if people don't know what to do at encryptid then it's been designed badly
---
Totally behind all of these.  But as a veteran player (level 170) never heard of not using tank killer on the queen, what’s the logic here?
---
That literally doesn't matter lmao the point is low/mid level players shouldn't be starting the event when there are 2 others there.
---
If that doesn't stop them drop US Supply requisitions they make the low levels wanted. Use the relay towers to set up traps.
---
The encryptid event is the natural conclusion of the Sheepsquatch questline. It's ridiculously easy for a mid level to stumble onto that shit by just innocently following a questline and expecting it to end in a soloable fight.
---
If you're gonna bitch at anyone for low/mid levels starting this event, bitch at whoever wrote this questline to end in such a mess, with no warning that you're starting a high level event you can't handle on your own.
---
My opinion is that it looks better than the normal roof.  
---
Given that the Grafton monster drops tar, you would think that we could have tar roofs...
---
Yea, we're actually engaged and living together now. What sucks is that we don't really get to play online games together anymore.
---
when leveling a new toon I try to show up for SBQs as often as I can manage to collect repair kits until I get artisan maxed
---
Yes, I could also craft and scrap on repeat, but I was hoping to avoid this method.
---
I loathe that one. No one wants to be a conduit but everyone wants to complain. Never again.
---
When they continuously spam the queen in the sky with marginal attacks, its slows her path and elongates the entire event when she "staggers".
---
Congrats on 50, still rocking the mole miner build?
---
Imagine thinking you're above the rules the rest of us have to play by. Karen, indeed. Hope you enjoy your ban.
---
Pop into CAMP edit mode, highlight the door, and then you should see an option along the bottom left of the screen that says "Lock", on PS4 its L2. You can do three different levels of lock, each costs a little bit of scrap
---
yup.. anything mob heavy and mechanic light is great
---
I can answer you because this event is considered an exp farm 
---
If you repair the turrets they are basically stealing potential exp from kills
---
Thru Hiker is great too. it brought down my carry weight from 300 to 240. And that’s with rank 1
---
Yep, it can be confusing sometimes. They really should specify that, but oh well.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hf0dh7/how_to_make_line_in_the_sand_quick_and_easy_does/
---
Have fun. I stopped glitching it though. Too many hacked guns. Didn’t really bother me until I took a level 40 there and he said he got maybe five kills lol.
---
I would add it as a perk, just a reflavor of Bloody Mess. You could easily get me to waste 3 perk points on that, lol.
---
It is a legendary shotgun with either +50% limb damage or, 40% bash damage.  In VATS it will one shot most opponents due to a bug which gives it far more damage points than normal.  It may also work with a shotgun used by a person wearing armor with-15% limb damage .
---
That’s the most ‘MURICA thing I’ve heard today. Makes as much sense as using the imperial system instead of the metric system.
---
Life saving stacks apparently in an atypical fashion. Like the percentages dont add up, but more like you have two possible chances that roll separately. I think it works much like sentinel/assassin/cavalier
---
Almost everything else stacks percentage wise. Besides chameleon, which you only need 1 piece to get full effect/use
---
I actually haven't found any technical data since wastelanders and it's a bummer because I dont have all the BOS paints. I tried dropping one of the ones I had in my inventory and picking it back up but nothing......its a sad world lol
---
Man no incisor? Thats the perk giving you good damage, also im not seeing this as a pvp build so why the rank 3 secret agent? Also no adementium skeleton? Thats a must have, also no field surgeon or first aid?? How do you survive? Dang also just saw no Serendipity, that perk is huuuuuge, a literal must have.
---
Yea i only noticed it because my 9 year old plays fortnite and i recognized his behavior. put two and two together and stopped going on public worlds now that schools out and they are more frequent
---
Not really. Every see a level 60 bring a fly tent to scorched earth?
---
Haha in the past I would’ve thought that is  mean. Not anymore !!
---
There is a flight jacket with that fur but it made me naked otherwise?
---
Makes sense. I’ll be sure to remove it next time.
---
It should just be a feature. Just like with regular vendors, you can buy what I sell to it. We should be able to buy weapons people scripted.
---
If you're on PC, I can give you some .50?
---
They paint the other, reasonable noobs in a bad light.
---
I only play in building groups. I won't play in other other type of group. Building= more XP. For everything.     If there is an existing  building group that  has room, then I join it. Sometimes when I join a sever, there are  only groups for events, role play etc. and  the  building groups are all  full.
---
In that case I  start my own building group.  I won't play on anything other than building.
---
Some people may have been kicked from groups and don't want to repeat it so they start their own group so they can't be kicked.
---
I agree - its actually just promoting bad behaviour from folks desperate to get their cap. Uranium fever after the influx of new folks finally got to a point where everyone for the most part respected the decorum for waving over folks for the legendary and plinking it with a low power shot and doing a thumbs up.  
---
Every event bar one this weekend of UF there were *multiple* people one-shotting to make sure they got the legendary.  
---
The introduction of this daily and its regularity - like 4 times out of 7 days last week, plus a weekly - is having some unintended consequences to the toxicity levels i have to say.
---
Ok. Then use search.
---
Just one bomber jacket, and Elder Maxson Jacket but was a bundle thing.
---
I feel like this one is easy and comes naturally during playtime (at least for me). As others have said, there are certain events that spawn legendaries. If not you can try go to whitesprings houses, westtek, or the fissure prime site (if you're high enough level). I always find legendaries there and I'm sure there are more farming spots
---
While true, when you see 2 people much higher than you waiting around on the buildings, something has to click in your mind.
---
Also that would imply that the person at hand had the Recall Card, which wasn't the case in my scenario
---
While in edit mode, not build mode, aim at the door you want to lock and press left trigger or L2 if you're on xbox or playstation, not sure what button it is for PC. Then there are three levels of difficulty you can set for the lock. Locks also work on things like water purifiers and resource collectors
---
Free Resources. Welcome to the New Appalachia Wasteland
---
Ahh I wish. One day my friend one day. When my kids don't destroy everything they set their eyes on i will have a PC and i will game right.
---
your a little [behind the times on that one](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eo80ev/so_we_found_out_the_exact_cost_of_every_camp_item/)
---
Ewwwwww... that would have made me so frustrated.
---
You already have to sacrifice a slot for frog legs, I know it adds different gameplay avenues in addition to the ability to dodge explosions. I don't personally run it, I prefer a shotgun runner build. Maybe fireproof could allow you to take less damage from the fire
---
Doesnt have to be in order so you could have assains bashing damage shotgun and its gonna work
---
If they made it so you could make backpacks invisible then back and shoulder holsters would he awesome but otherwise most people would have no cool guns on their back since they need the extra carry
---
Steal potential xp? How?
---
Unless some high level douche with broken build aoe kills everything before you can even aim at the legendary in the crowd of ghouls.
---
inside the asylum, 3rd or 4th floor.. or you're walking to watoga
---
mind the ghouls
---
It would help if they allowed the average Scorched to spawn as legendary like they do at Christmas. This game is filled with areas that will never have legendaries in them because they are infested with scorched.
---
Low ranked players can always be alts. Don't forget, even a new character starts at 0 (as in, you don't need a new account). Lots of people will be restarting even more often thanks to the challenges that ask you to rank up.
---
I for example have recently started a new character and am still under level 20, but I know a heck of a lot about my favorite areas of the Morgantown map, which weapons are good, and how to build a good perk loadout. I know when my gear is good enough to fight and when it's better to hide.
---
My point is, low ranks doesn't necessarily mean no knowledge. And in this game high rank doesn't necessarily mean a good fighter either because you can just run and hide your way to top 10.
---
Yep, that is a smart way of handling it. Dud moves on my part
---
I'll take a fly tent over a bunch of 60's with shit Gatling Plasmas just spraying tbh
---
Stealth build alternating between a BE Handmade and a Bloodied Deathclaw Gauntlet. I know it's the meta and boring but once you reach a certain level it's hard to see past bloodied.
---
My uny/sent/ap armour gives me ridiculous strength for melee damage and increases my perception past 15 which is currently specced for rifleman. Agility for sneak and luck nearly maxed out too for maximum dps and those sneak stealth crits.
---
Junkies build on my original toon. Considering starting another build soon as my current is kinda OP and there's zero challenge anymore.
---
Due to the in game song, My current build is a pistol packin momma.  She has high luck and agility and uses pistols and explosives mainly.  It's a bit under powered compared to my melee explosives character, but is fun to play.
---
Then why are you bitching about low lvls starting it and not being the pylons if high level players don’t act any better? Lead by example. If you know what to do, do it. If you know how to do that event properly then it shouldn’t matter if low level players are there not helping the situation. 
---
Don’t use the excuse that you’re a bloodied build and can’t take pylons either. I’m a bloodied build. I stimpak  to full health take all 3. By time I take the 3rd one my health is low enough I can stealth attack the imposter and kill it myself in 2 mags from my fixer or handmade. It’s not that hard of an event if you know how to setup for it. You’re a veteran player so I assumed you knew this....
---
Turn on your headset and try to give some direction while you’re at it.
---
Nicee.
---
Lol, you must be new to 76.
---
Yea I was able to craft it again. Just odd it vanished from my inventory from fast traveling. Hope it doesn’t happen with rare drops.
---
😂
---
They would be on the inside of the display, but the Thanksgiving display case is the only upright one that doesn't put items under glass
---
Again, seen plenty of higher levels doing that. Idiots are idiots, level.is an irrelevant factor.
---
I find bugged workshops constantly lately, more than ever before.  From guests once placed no longer allowing to be moved to insane damage by enemies on structures to Ghramn being stuck there until you trade with him.. this is not always but much more common.. I have in just the last week experienced all the other complaints on this thread... Server hopping fixes it.
---
The first time I saw the 3 legendary challenge, I was like "well, guess i'm not doing that".  Then I got one on the parking deck of Garrahan Mining, and two more inside the Charleston Capitol building.
---
So it won’t work even solo in a public group. I guess I’ll continue to be the lonely loner walking a lonely street.... alone
---
I found 2 on deathclaw island, did an event, came back and they had respawned.
---
Yep. Had someone sharing rad sponge during the SBQ event. Wrecked my damage.
---
I’m not surprised I’m more....disgusted lol
---
I keep getting kicked from groups I join without anyone saying anything so that another player can join them so I'm not going to waste my time anymore
---
On my junkier commando build, I run 3 Traveling Pharmacy and 1 Bandolier. My character has 4 Strength but loses 1 or 2 (not sure off the top of my head) due to addictions.
---
Nice. Thanks for your help.  Looks like I’m grabbing some junk to display tonight.
---
I like to be the one who decides if I'm on the team or not. I have been on publics ones only to be booted five seconds before nuking the queen so there budy could join. So I lost my bonus, and I nuked their homes. Now no bonus or queen for anyone.
---
Same here, logged in to find the level up, gold star and buy items from players were already finished. I’m not too worried as there’s still about 5 weeks left and I’m at rank 64, but still, score is score...
---
Got that already, was just wondering about the Strength perks.
---
Because that was not my experience, it was your's lmao.
---
I finished the run during double XP, and so did 3 of my friends. So that we can relax and not worry about the run until next season :)
---
I didn't know that either. But I also don't waste my ammo on her when she is flying. I noticed in my very first Queen fight that she takes more damage on the ground.
---
lol hilarious. Worse case scenario, just take the 100 stimpacks or whatever and sell it all to a NPC vendor. Easy money
---
I run a stealth rifleman on my main, literally no perks in shotguns and my Instigating Combat Shotgun murders anything in sight with VATS, it's a joke.
---
Granted I have sneak and Instigating bonuses but I used to have a Quad Exposive Double-barrel (no instigating) and it was similar. Even outside of sneak shotguns are just murder machines as long as you can get close and VATS.
---
This was my first build for a lonnnng time before I switched to a bloodied commando. I miss it sometimes, that being said, instigating, and AA levers are your best bet for semi-auto weapons. TS has issues with accuracy in V.A.T.S and the second bullet often misses. Iirc, each bullet does 60% dmg and when the second bullet misses, you only do 60% dmg instead of the 120% of both hitting.
---
Shame, thanks for the info
---
OK Randall
---
Vet player 2 level 250+ im not taking tank killer off lol
---
You do get some benefits even if you are the only one in a group.
---
The blade already has 100% armor penetration so no incisor. I'm in stealth 99% of the time so i dont get hit often enough to warrant things like serendipity or adamantium. Have enough stimpacks and chems to keep me alive just fine. Secret agent 3 is more of a role play perk but it does help with stealth with the phantom device frenzying enemies. Really nuke zones are the only place i have a problem where i have to put on hazmat suit or power armor which sucks cause then i lose the garb of mystery buffs for my blade. 
---
I've done all the content available with her and i rarely die.
---
That game was epic, is that on ps4 now or did I dream it? Only ever stopped playing because none of my friends have pc.
---
I think its definitely the combination of the health mutation and rads at work, I use the stealth suit (so not an unyielding/bloodied problem) most of the time and a small sliver of radiation will stop me from fast travelling until I use a radaway. I think its coding for the mutation, it tries to heal through the rads but can't so it keeps tricking the game into thinking you're taking damage and won't stop unless your health gets updated by eating/drinking or popping a radaway/stimpack
---
Did you test that? If so yeah they need to take another look lol
---
Then you waste everyone's time if you shoot the SBQ in the sky.
---
~45 minutes worth if you use it for 3 Queens in a session
---
yeah, that looks really good. shame it was a cash only no atoms thing. but it was fair.
---
I would but my camp isnt one that can be easily placed back down and I've been in the same spot since beta so I leave
---
I see, we’re used to a more mature crowd at this stage of the games cycle. Hopefully in time these kids learn some manners lol
---
Yeah, I gotta start working on those challenges.
---
I have a magic one too and love farming west Tek and Huntersville
---
Yea it was like, buy items from players, the gold star, kill 15 creatures and i think a workshop one. And my complete 3 events challenge said I already completed 2 lol. But I'm not worried abt it too much either but i hope it's not a repeat occurrence for me
---
Once I saw her at somebody's camp pulsing purple and bitching about her headaches, then I walked outside and encountered a Flatwoods monster.  
---
It's the only time I've ever seen her do that.
---
I can show up at encryptid events that have started and make sure they complete even if no progress has been made. 
---
I’m sorry you can’t. Maybe you need more practice.
---
You underestimate the difference in build from 60 vs say 200.
---
Endless levels of tinkering + weapon looting. It just isn't comparable
---
I'm able to do it. Maybe ur just too much of a foodie
---
As far as I know there is no textures for ceilings, or wallpapers for them
---
It's been on ps4 since about 2016. It's kind of slowed down but still plenty busy at peak hours and weekends. Still free to play and 50% more xp with PlayStation plus.
---
Have you been spawned in the fissure yet, that's fun, at least you die quick.
---
Go for Vanguard Sentinel if you can. If you have a decent first effect and Sentinel I’d keep it too. That way you can have really high DR but also have a high chance of avoiding a decent bit of incoming damage.
---
I hope it’s still on the shop’s rotation
---
I don't think that actually stops them, because you can access most Terminals through your Pip-Boy if someone else is using them.
---
Blue ridge have both ends of the tunnel secured yet they keep letting Blood Eagles back in, would have made more sense for the event enemy to be Mole Miners that's explainable with them tunnelling in
---
Our group uses cigarette machines. I know those exist at nearly every train station. Not so sure about blue suitcases, but then I've never really looked for them either.
---
lol I have put them in my store for 5 or 10 caps and they sell kinda quick but yea My RIP my "inbox of junk"
---
You have to shot the mobs to get exp 
---
Remember you going against other players and turrent , by not repairing the turrent that increase your potential to tag for exp
---
It the same why ppl don’t even repair for line In The sand
---
I'm definitely about to give that a download it gave me Unreal Tournament vibes from the speed and movement of everything, I definitely remember having a good time with it. Thanks!
---
If you're doing a full health build, nothing wrong with mixing pieces. Vanguard's is very nice, though there is diminishing returns on DR. If you've got mutations, go ahead and get Mutant's. Personally if I wanted a mixed set, I'd get Chameleon, Mutants, Vanguards, and maybe something to give you extra protection from Robots and Scorched or Super Mutants.
---
That was lucky! I think it should be overrun with deathclaws, personally
---
If you’ve got the Healing Factor mutation, get rid of it and then try traveling. Can’t confirm whether this is an actual fix, but it certainly has worked for me.
---
I find that pump shotguns are the best out of all of them, just bc of the range it has, you can one shoot enemies from far distance, where as with combat u have to get relatively close
---
I didn't do any of the settlers quest :) Now I'm well over 400 and still no stealth armor, and I have no idea what the settlers side of the story is :)
---
big badda boom
---
"Yes, yes big badda boom"
---
biiiiiiig badda BOOM
---
Stick to the topic at hand lmao you've veered off on this bizarre Strawman because you felt personally attacked by the post.
---
Yes, and yes. Get yourself Class Freak as well, throw on Strange in Numbers and join/create a Public Team and reap all the benefits of mutations.
---
But wouldn’t the lone wanderer perk be better then the low tier bonuses granted for grouping? Not trying to argue, just get a better understanding for myself
---
I tend to stay away from the Forest Region when I can....as much as its great to see so many new people in the game, I also don't see a lot of the older folks either.
---
There have been times when I've been the highest level on the map - meaning, I'm literally higher than all of the other players on the maps, combined.
---
Betcha this is another thread Bethesda doesn’t respond to! 😂
---
I do, but along with a load of others, so I'll need to collect some serums. Will give this a go and see if it helps though once I have the replacement serums; thanks!
---
There aren't that many mods for the Gatling gun.  I remember getting them all relatively quickly through scrapping.  I think you can get all the mods way faster if you just scrap guns.  Trying to find the mods seems like it would be tedious and take forever.
---
Don't start the event unless you can solo it, if need be.
---
I agree but that's pretty much what happenes
---
Its called intRaw. Make sure you get the one that was updated post-wastelanders.
---
Yup
---
I wish I could do that on console lol being level 50 and having to hide in the bushes and move around slightly has been a grind! Been going through alot of podcasts though while I camp
---
I have a bloodied 3\* fixer I rolled from mama mrgmrg (The Rusty Pick) but I don't know what I want to trade for it, I'm open for options. Also PC :)
---
I never once had that problem being I had my camp all the way below Welch and no one ever placed down there lol. Then I moved all the way up top above lumber yard. That area is way more popular but again i don’t have to much of a problem. I use to just add stuff for the atom challenges and just recently I have taken more of a pleasure in building something nice
---
makes me want to grind level a character, without taking the drink, just to see what happens...
---
"Nothing happens, you just waste time..."
---
then why...
---
"I said good day!"
---
Yeah, have fun with that. Did one just now. The ghouls spawned and were killed in less then a second by overpowered a-holes.
---
It's fantastic for SBQ fights, especially if you run Bloodied. I usually carry 5-6 with me at all times. Always craft them with Super Duper on; unfortunately Chemist has no effect.
---
Now I get it. Yes, I think you are right.
---
It’s made with bourbon
---
How do I tell it’s working?
---
100% agree With this guy chameleons comes in handy,  as well I rock 1 life saving piece just in case massive lag at the queen fight/wendigo collosus.
---
It doesn't do what you think to the Sbq. I have a bloodied +33% vats combat shotgun. I can 1 shot scorchbeasts right when they land with a body shot but the sbq doesn't seem like its affected at all.
---
How much more XP does +6 INT give? If you know or would it be easier to say how much XP would having 20 INT give?
---
It will never be good lol
---
In the middle? I think that’s a random spawn. For me it can be honey beasts, radscorpions, or even a grafton monster.
---
This! I was gonna mention this but I completely forgot which alcohol it was. Plus it's a super easy daily to do, particularly if you're a honey hoarder.
---
If it’s healing factor a way to test that is take some rad away while having starched genes on. It will suppress but not remove your mutations. 
---
Then try fast traveling.
---
Automatic
---
That's good! But I mean you can sell them to any of the robot vendors in the train stations. You can sell up to 1400 caps worth of stuff to NPCs daily. Different than your vendor store at your camp.  So if you don't want to use any more of your stash space, just sell it to the NPC lol thats my take anyway
---
After watching that.....you're dead on. He's self aware!
---
I didn’t veer off. You literally said low lvl players shouldn’t start that event because you’re tired of going to the even that a low lvl started and not being able to complete the event because they don’t know what they are doing. 
---
I am saying that you as a veteran player should be able to control the situation of the event and make it complete regardless of who starts it. You should be able to solo that event as a veteran player. If you can’t control that event and/or solo it than YOU are the one who doesn’t know what they are doing.
---
No problem. I main the VS faction. You can gun in one of my vehicles to level quicker. I'm level capped on there so I have nearly everything in game unlocked  and maxed out. But I have a decent amount unlocked on the other 2 factions. Razoreddie871.
---
Yep. Tags muktiple
---
Im currently looking for a shotgun to try it out. I have a explosive junkies minigun that shoots at 206 and a 2 shot railway rifle with the 50 limb damage already tho. Would those work?
---
Yup, logged on to see all of the weekly challenges had autocompleted...
---
You’re kind of terrible but in a good way lol.
---
My friend is a longtime Fallout fan like me, it looks like he got the game in the early days like I did but got bored of it super quickly. So we finally played together during this year’s Fasnacht and at this point, I was like a level 80 or so and he’s only level 5. I had sooo much fun giving him a Nukashine welcome. “What, you’re thirsty? Here have this.” “The colors are changing ... now there’s a loading screen.” Lmao. It only transported him to near Camp McClintock ... I sympathize for low levels who get transported to the Cranberry Bog or the Mire haha but they can always FT back to Vault 76 ... unless they’re overencumbered, in which case, RIP lol. 
---
By the way, said friend and I became friends because we were both chemistry majors in college. I can’t wait for him to do the Nukashine quest because it was created by Chem students!!
---
Which fissure location was this?
---
My build is a full set of sentinel armor with max dodgy,serendipity, and fireproof with nerd rage out of pure spite for players that try and take workshops from people. I'm really hard to kill now and people usually just give up where before I would die before I could even shoot back. People being trolls and bullies has forced me to fast travel to workshops and mess people up if they are attacking someone who looks like they cant do anything about it.
---
I start encrypted right after a group kills the SBQ. People show up every time.
---
They really should make the budget more intricate, for example, each letter from the letter set should be 1, and a flamingo could be 2 or 3 now and every thing is multiplied by 2 or 3 (including max budget) but I just really want to be able to place more letters!
---
I think it's only like 2% per 1INT? 
---
I run Bloodied with Unyielding armor on a Building Public Team (I've got Egghead as well) with Strange in Numbers and if anyone on my team is also mutated I get a shit ton of XP from even the smallest things.
---
Also, Class Freak 3 will negate almost all of any of the negative effects of your mutations.
---
Has there been any news on that at all? Honest question... I'm out of the loop.
---
Can I be one of said hookers?
---
You can get a leader bobble head and unyielding gear. Then get the bonus from well rested and fine tuned and eat a canned meat stew or cranberry relish as well as having inspirational on in charisma.
---
The implication has nothing to do with relative skill, which shows you simply don't understand what I'm saying. 
---
Principle alone should dictate that low levels shouldn't start it.
---
Everything else you added was strawman rage lmao
---
This game is an endless loop. You're just fighting the same shitty,  buggy AI in the endless grind to get better and better loot to fight the same shitty AI again and again. Who cares if you have a million B2525 fixers if you just have em to kill the SBQ 20 million times. Pvp is a fun break from this where you can fight actual players, put ur OP gear to use, and have fun lol.
---
It's definitely worth attending if you want to grind for XP.
---
The only thing is, I did one by myself yesterday, and it was a real exercise in frustration because the problems with VATS are at their worst when you're shooting fast-moving Ghouls who are headed toward something other than you.  70% of the time, that headshot is an instant kill.  But the 30% of the time when it's not, it takes 8-10x the shots, just because the game refuses to register the damage numbers you see.
---
People not collecting ore in radiation rumble drives me nuts. I've run it so many times where I'm the only one collecting.
---
Why not add an entire separate menu for atom shop items
---
Am I the only one who doesn't have much trouble with finding legendary enemies? The last several of these legendary challenges, I've just gone to Whitespring or West Tek and done it in one. Or I've done a Horde event or hit the fissures in the cranberry bog for legendary Scorchbeasts which seem to spawn about 50% of time.
---
There are two on DC island, there is one at hopewell cave, and one at the cranberry bog thunder mountain substation, and there are two or three inside abandoned waste dump in mire.
---
Thanks, will try that.
---
I'm a stealth rifleman but I flip between Instigating and Bloodied pretty often. I prefer Instigating overall, but Bloodied is just objectively better in many ways.
---
In both builds I one-shot most enemies from stealth, I get to just run and hide from fights that don't interest me, and I get to choose which enemy dies first (which is often invaluable when you can, for example, kill the Gutsy that would shred you in seconds and leave the weaker Protections for second and third shots).
---
In Instigating I get to have full health, using Stimpaks feels good and I have control over it, and I get to wear my armor with the Halloween skin on it. I can take 2-3 big hits before I go down. My first strike deals extra damage, and I get to play with a legendary's health pool to get Instigating to turn on when it regenerates. However, playing with other people often means halving my damage, and my explosive Fixer will do that too if I'm not careful. 
---
In Bloodied I get to deal massive damage consistently. The buffs from Unyielding make my prices better, I get more XP and junk from scrapping, I'm theoretically more difficult to detect, I can carry so much more stuff.  I deal less first-strike damage than Instigating (though I can make the numbers match at exactly 1 health), but my damage is consistent, so if my first shot hits for 1000, so will all the rest. 
---
But living at less than 20% health has downsides, like I always go down in one good shot. I also have to avoid radiation much more than when I'm not Bloodied, because it's deadly much quicker, and the hit to my health matters more. Additionally, Bloodied is difficult to micromanage, especially because the game will sometimes put me up to 25% health for no reason (this happens often on server hops or fast travel, but it isn't consistent).
---
Over 2k hours played here so I'm well aware how builds work. Which brings up a further point that people have alts. I have a lot of them. Incidentally the most damage I've done at a scorched earth event was on a level 48 rifle build. I've also run Encrytid and held all 3 pylons at level 40 without issue. Once again, level is irrelevant.
---
Wasn't one that shows on the map! Just up from Quarry x3 .. 13 of them came out within 5mins
---
Yeah I have Class freak 3 and Marsupial. I found an old thread like a year old that explains it then again I found another that’s says INT doesn’t affect XP. So I guess I can see. Kill a level 62 ghoul without it then take it then kill another 62 ghoul and see the difference.
---
If you are getting one shot kills in VATS with a shotgun having the magic effect.
---
Okay sweet, I just added you from my phone on going to install that when I get on later I'll hit you up at some point
---
I guess I'm a gamepass noob but I learned pretty quick. I put my .38 and 10mm ammo up for 0 caps in my vendor with all other ammo at 1 cap each. I sell all my plans for 0 or 5 caps and always have a stock of purified water for 0 caps. I've regularly dropped 10 stimpacks and radaway for even newer players and have had nothing but good interactions on PC. 
---
I think it's not gamepass noobs, just children who do that, and PC has a higher bar of entry for children.
---
I had a crew of level 15-17s who came to my camp yesterday and chilled out for a while, playing my instruments and taking a fair amount of the free stuff I had. It was great!
---
There's magic heavy guns too. I wouldn't invest in one now though, I've heard that they were patched during the patch 20/21 beta, so next update it might get fixed.
---
Using outliers as evidence doesn't exactly prove your point
---
You can also just go to the fissure sites. SB seem to have a high chance of being legendarys
---
That’s also a reasonable idea
---
Don't believe that is a "magic" shotgun.  You need +50 limb damage or +40 bash damage.
---
Food builds be like "bro this game is so fun I get to launch a nuke and  kill the SBQ for the 29392^292 time!"
---
I agree, it’s rather nice. My biggest gripe is that it’s a pain to defend against swarms of ghouls as a rifleman build without vats. If I didn’t have my Tesla rifle, I’d be in for a bad time. The addictol is a nice, valuable selling item as well.
---
I usually end up conduit for all three!
---
Nobody wants to follow the simple directions in the upper right corner of the screen.
---
Instead spend the whole encounter crying about not being able to damage the imposter.
---
It probably makes sense to show the armor in a pvp mode. You might think twice about blowing your cover in an ambush if they are wearing heavy armor. Not showing it could give someone the false perception of how armored someone is when attacking.
---
I mean  X-01 is kinda lore friendly because when u get it it's prototype X-01, but power armour cannon is pretty fucked anyway
---
I guess I don’t understand what you’re saying. Good luck teaching/informing players how to properly participate in an event so you can get a completion.
---
Ok thanks for the info!!
---
I think it was designed to be dupe-proof first, easy to use or convenient second.
---
I have 15 points in Strength.
---
Play the game how you want to play the game. After level 50, the game lets you switch SPECIAL points around and everything.
---
Just do you.
---
You should focus on just one weapon type and just get all the perks that increase that damage, it makes a pretty huge difference.
---
Did you mean to post this on twitter or tumbler? Itseems like the sort of garbage they would welcome. Go spread your fucking cancel culture elsewhere.
---
Iys because when i first got it i got 2.5k 5 mm rounds and 700 .308 rounds and i never had to worry about ammo since. Also i dont use the .50 cal machine gun so that doesnt apply to me
---
Like one other person said start it after you run SBQ. If you had a solid group of players show up for that you’re almost guaranteed to have them show up for encrypted as well.
---
What isn't comparable is your stubbornness and logic.
---
There is so many high level players that are knobs, pretending to be god with a bloodied build. Actually more high than low levels. Low levels just don't know, and need to learn. High levels should have learned but they don't, because they think just because they can 1 shot everything, they are the gods. They are lazy bastards who don't contribute anything to the events just so they can wank off their bloodied damage. Rad rumble for example, where you can easily get your rads back for your bloodied build. You have a stealth suit with 1k RR? Run. The. F*cking. Ore. You. Lazy. Knob.
---
There is people who are level 60 that play better than a lot of level 200+, because level 60 people want to play the game, while bloodied 200+ just want rewards, and steal the fun for everyone else.
---
I mean how tf do you not get bored as a bloodied?
---
This post is basically just a way to say:
---
"Do as I say or you suck, especially the low levels"
---
M8... where is the logic?
---
Also the fact that you call yourself "Veteran" because you are level God knows what and have been here since BETA just shows how selfish you are and how much attention you are calling for.
---
Kinda sucks it cant turn fatmans into points either
---
As a newish player, I just found this out the hard way last night. I went to a camp to buy bullets and his shop was behind a locked door. I picked the lock, not realizing it would get me wanted. I just wanted to purchase items, so I didn't realize I was doing anything that was bad. I really didn't know any of the things that would get you wanted other than attacking a player.
---
You'll be able to move points from strength into perception/agility once you're over Lvl50, so start by using the next 20 points to unlock the majority of what your desired build is and then after 50 move the remaining points. 
---
A couple of hours on a double XP weekend would get you enough to move any misplaced points.
---
On my main I made the same mistake 😂 guess I’m gonna live without it
---
Ive noticed the problems with sneak as well. Multiple times last night i would just suddenly be visible and Dangered out of nowhere.
---
Normally I can literally sit face to face with L80 legendary scorchebeasts while unloading shot after shot into her noggin while maintaining stealth, but for the last few days sometimes ill be creeping along and im just *visible*, out of the fucking blue. No combat, nothing attacking me, just \*boom\* DANGER. Then of course everything **is** attacking me.
---
If you're running a build that fills up the critical meter quickly (commando for example), you'll get used to just holding down the triangle button as you're firing. This way you're making a critical shot every 2-3 shots on an auto weapon.
---
If you stay, can you later log out and then server hop to place your CAMP?  Or are you forced to place your CAMP again and place the blueprinted items or destroy the blueprints and spend the next couple hours manually rebuilding it all?
---
Lmao you continue to be butthurt over the OP because I called something you probably routinely do/did.
---
If you are a vats crit build with low ap cost weapon then you can hold shoot and crit to automatically crit. I think you need to have a crit banked first for it to work properly. Doesn't always work and works better with some weapons than others.
---
How so?
---
Everything but public teams was delayed
---
Bethesda:  Implements account wide stash box.
---
4 Hours Later on YouTube:  "Hey everyone.  Gonna show you a new dupe method using the account wide stash.  Also make sure to subscribe and like!  Now onto the dupe....."
---
Oh INT definitely affects XP. It's why a lot of people run Building Teams for the boost. More effective to get the small boost from all the mob kills and only swap to Events for when you're actually running them.
---
You sound big mad lmao.
---
Simple probability......would you trust a 250 or a 50??
---
Ok thank you
---
You need to tell people what build you are and what you plan to do once you have the set you're looking for
---
The minigun should be working bc the fire rate is over 200, the railway will not bc u cant get the fire rate over 200
---
No. Only camp and workshops.
---
Sometimes we want to make our own, with **Blackjack** and**Hookers**!
---
That's a good point! I will have to start considering that more.
---
And you’re right on the money. Each point is like 2.07% so at max you’d get 31%. Thanks!!
---
Anytime!
---
A 50, because their brains aren't melted away by pretending to be something they aren't.
---
We all made mistakes when we were low level, and if you say you didn't you are lying. Let them learn and stop bashing the poor fellas.
---
Same thing happened to me. And i rebuilt again at least 4 or 5 times
---
Take a sit and relax next to the other 84773928478494 posts about the same issue
---
Yes PC does have a higher bar of entry. Lucky. That sounds like a great time !! I’ve also had some great times don’t get me wrong. They are most likely kids so I can’t cry too much about it. Well I hope they are kids...
---
I got a bear arm!
---
The cultists wear black hazmat suits and I want one!!!!
---
My best build/high damage build is my lame unyielding bloodied fixer build. It’s boring, so my preferred build is my vanguards heavy combat armor full health build with some JE/JFFR weapons and a VE minigun (looking for a VE LMG to replace it) it’s super fun because I never die while using it and can just be a complete tank. The protection it gives is almost as good as t-65 PA (iirc the energy protection is higher than t-65 and the physical protection is close) when I upgrade to SS armor it should be all around better than t-65
---
Just so you know, Bird Bones isn't necessary if you have the two armor pieces. 2 pieces of fall damage armor add up to 100% reduction, so you can fall from any height and take no damage (like in power armor).
---
It's fun to jump off the lighthouse at Path to Enlightenment and watch people get confused. Just make sure to keep some extra stims handy to revive anyone who follows you!
---
If it happened one time, I'd forgive.
---
It's simply routine arrogance from mid tier levels who think they can call shots for whatever reason.
---
Clearly it was enough for me to make a post about it
---
The Ammo Converter is the bane of my existence. I don’t understand how it was designed that way.
---
Rad rumble always produces like 2-4 in my experience. If you’re lucky enough to be on guard duty and not a runner like I always have to do.
---
The key is an auto grenade or even an m79. The grenadier perk helps too.
---
Nooooooooooooooooooo it took me months to get one. I did it legitimatelyyyyyyyyyy.
---
While true, eh nbd. New weapon to search for is fun :)
---
+33 vats is also one of the effects. Otherwise supermutants take a whole mag to kill with 330 damage a shot outside of vats with zero shotgun perks. In vats I can go to town an 1 shot anything. From bebemoths, mirelurk queen, yao gaui, fog crawlers, hermit crabs,and sentry bots.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vno3BICsakI
---
And who gives you the right to call shots then, or bash people?
---
It's a team game, you are by no means a leader sir.
---
Just because your experience was bad, doesn't mean everyone is the same.
---
Cool. I can't always talk on mike but I could definitely use a gunner. I'm also on fallout a lot at night too.
---
Oh I wasn’t passing judgement at all, just pointing out the valid reason for the OP.  Sorry I triggered such an angry side of yours, I wouldn’t take up a career in comedy anytime soon though.
---
Same here, only 6 points for commando perks.  If you get a good legendary rifle that's enough to make short work of 95 percent of the mobs in the game.  
---
Is it a good build?? Hell no LMAO.  It kills just about everything quickly anyways though.
---
If you don't use power armor much, the chemist backpack from the raiders is freaking great.
---
Safe building height is 3 story with a roof. Any higher and you risk hitting the boundary ceiling.
---
Never said I did lmao.
---
Just don't be surprised when I leave you out to dry on Encryptid/Project Paradise when the arrogance continues.
---
I don’t go out of my way to help low level players, I’ll leave supplies at V76 when there’s a low level or two there but I don’t use public teams on public worlds. I know I’m missing out on the bonuses but I only want to play with my friend specifically while on public worlds, I’m here to play the game not to drop a loads of supplies just for someone to ask for more things every time I get on. It’s part of the reason I mostly play on my private now.
---
My sincere sympathy that you had to put up with such horses\*\*\*.
---
It's been an on and off issue for me too
---
[yes and to do lots of side eye and judging](https://media0.giphy.com/media/3o7TKUn3XY4ZxuV2w0/giphy.gif?cid=4d1e4f292t6be82yfxiahkjlm8q8ht3hqfhdzh8dmldovvht&amp;rid=giphy.gif)
---
Two or three points in Luck of the Draw will help offset some repair frequency.
---
Use a build planner such as [Nukes &amp; Dragons](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) to map out your build. You'll get a roadmap to see what perks become available at what level, as well as any holes in your build where no desired perk card is available at that level (you will need to choose something to move forward).
---
Compare the roadmap to where you are currently, and start filling in the differences the best you can going forward. Once you reach level 50 you'll get the option to either choose a new perk card, or move a SPECIAL point from one category to another. With those options you can respec your toon to be whatever you want. It may take some more levels than initially planned on, but you'll get there!
---
Adding an example of my [Bloodied Commando / Team build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f345db&amp;d=sg2s01eu0eh1pi2pp2ph2pg2p01pq0la2lu2lt2l71ir2ib1a30a00a12an2ar0ao0a51a70ce0c62&amp;m=051c249fb3&amp;n=Bloodied%20Commando%20%2F%20Team) that I'm using while the Legendary Run is going on (Unyielding, BE Handmade build that maximizes INT for more XP and squeezing out as much SCORE as I can)
---
Multipass!
---
Word no problem I also usually dont have my mic on because its chaos around me at home lol I'm also on fallout late usually
---
I have that.
---
Input from a reluctant hoarder: clise spaces and mobs of gouls means blocker is needed. Feeling effects of that lack of attention now. Trust them. Chems are easy to find dont overload your weight with them. I die 9/10 times from unexpected melee and have 0 blocker
---
Sigh
---
Thank god someone else has mentioned this. I have tried to do the same thing as it just comes up as a misc quest marker
---
Migrate to PC! there is no chat or messages
---
Got all the challenges today done in 20 minutes.  They need to be harder and longer.  Make them 12 legendaries.
---
A big problem with that build as opposed to Stealth Armor is that the chameleon mutation only keeps u invisible if u are standing still...Chinese Stealth Armor obviously allows u to move while crouched while remaining invisible, which is how I clear out areas with dense higher level enemies...unless I’m wrong, but that’s why I haven’t adjusted my build because I enjoy the stealth movement with 1 shot kills on most targets...
---
Yeah, budgets are wildin. But it does seem that the budget use is getting better with newer items.
---
Hate mail? Tf?!
---
Because people see it and go “oh cool a group I’m not in one so I’ll join it”
---
And there is the proof that high levels only think about themselves everyone.
---
Pretending to be god and in control of every situation hm? 
---
I can manage myself very well without your help. But thank you for the offer.
---
*gasp!* does this mean that bethesda is racist against flamingos?!
---
Or terrifying, yeah.
---
I mean I still people out just not with big things like that any more
---
Being a weird fact person and working in a sea food place I realy enjoyed this
---
I’m not butt hurt. I’m just calling your blaming low lvls for not be able to complete and event bullshit. 
---
As a veteran player myself I never have problems completing the events your bitching about. 
---
Which leads me to my previous statement. Practice more.
---
I always do those first 2 and the horde events. Only had about an hour to play last night, and those events didn't spawn even once. I got a random legendary doing a daily. First time I've missed that challenge. It was a real bummer
---
Ohh ok gotcha
---
Good luck getting 3 animal completion on Project Paradise!
---
Not my experience.  Jumping from private to public and back to private always results in a new world for me.
---
Do you have a quick fix?
---
Yeah, really.  People need their hand held and can only go to events, going to world spawn is too complicated.
---
You can get above 15 Intelligence, so the XP bonus can be a lot more than that. 
---
Egg Head is well worth it. +12%XP and it really only costs you -5% Melee damage and -5 lbs carry weight. 
---
This is my setup on my main:
---
- Bird Bones
---
- Carnivore
---
- Eagle Eyes
---
- Egg Head
---
- Grounded
---
- Healing Factor
---
- Herd Mentality
---
- Marsupial
---
- Scaly Skin
---
- Speed Demon
---
Stat boosts: STR +0, PER +4, END +2, CHA +2, INT +7, AGI +6, LUCK +2. A total of 23 extra stat points. 
---
Other Effects: +50 Damage Resistance, +150 Energy Resistance, +20 pounds carry weight, x2Jump Height, Slow Fall, x2 benefit from meat-based foods, +25% Critical Damage, x4 Healing Speed, Maximized Movement Speed, even while sneaking, and Faster Reloading of Weapons. 
---
**Class Freak 3** means I get all those benefits for a trade off of: -12 HP, -12 AP, 13% less effectiveness from Chems &amp; Stims, -12% Energy Damage, and no benefits from plant-based foods.   The last two are irrelevant for me, since I don’t use energy weapons except very rarely. 
---
That’s an exceptional trade-off.
---
So if your budget is only filled with flamingos how many can you fit?
---
it was four and it's the same height it was before
---
170 and veteran? You kidding me? I can get 100 levels during the double-exp weekend and a couple more days
---
Except I didn't blame them for the event completion lmao
---
I blamed them for starting the event when nobody was ready + not maximizing rewards on other events.  
---
Thats literally out of my control
---
PSA:  Google fo76 deathclaw, first result has a list of all them.
---
Explosives suck in general
---
Also a “veteran player.” 
---
1. Your build doesn’t influence my actions. And honestly, this event is too much of a pain to be worth it. Especially with all the people, high levels included, who don’t play the objectives anyway. 
---
2. Ever stood around for 10 minutes while no one is shooting the queen, only for her to land for 10 seconds, then have to wait another 5 minutes anyway? I sure have, plenty of times. The queens behaviors are annoying most of the time anyway. 
---
3. I’ll grant you that, but again, to me this event is far more effort than it’s worth. I hardly ever see anyone doing it because of this. 
---
4. There are plenty of events going on, and I’m guessing that many people are working on other events with some purpose in mind. If Do an Event and Claim a Workshop are both dailies, I’m going to claim the workshop and to the event that it forces. Also, like I mentioned before, some people might not find value in those events. See my point about Encryptid and Project Paradise above. 
---
5. Items have different value for different people. If someone has that gun up for 15k, it’s not going to sell, that’s their loss and they’ll probably figure it out eventually. Most people honestly wouldn’t know what your endgame “veteran player” value is for most things. 
---
Ever considered that one-shotting everything and generally being pissy about everything might be ruining the experience for other people, low-, mid-, or high-level?
---
Above all, it’s a game and people play it differently. I personally find the game to be really enjoyable. If someone else doesn’t play it the way you like, just say “oh, that sucks,” shake your head at them and move on. No need to be a dick about it. 
---
Remember: be excellent to each other. Not this guy.
---
I don't know if you have 1st but feel free to join my private if you see me on. Just let me know your there so I don't server hop on you
---
Sounds like an asshole so I'm 90% sure he's on reddit.
---
Does anyone know if Cola Nut also effects the benefits from this?
---
Crafting leather armor, obivously
---
Yeah I do, I'll definitely send a message before I pop in
---
Oh believe me I have done that with 2 other experienced players in my crew already.
---
And they don't call themselves "Veterans" because we are a team. You'll learn that some day pal.
---
BTW I have all the rewards for it anyway so... I only do it to be helpful and kind :)
---
Better than Assassins or Nocturnal.
---
I've given more 3 star weapons out to low levels than you can dream lmao
---
Don't let scrubs run the asylum.
---
Pretty sure it doesn't buuuut I thought that about Cranberry and it does turn the 2% into 6% so maybe try it again
---
Berry Mentats
---
Im feeling this. I have one at L32 and it just sucks. I *want* to make it work, but i know that pistols just arent going to scale well without trying to double dip on crummy pipe weapons.
---
It's definitely something to think about. In most environments it's not too bad, especially indoors where you have a good idea which way the body would fly.
---
But I've lost legendary wolves in the forest after scattering a pack with a grenade more than once.
---
Glitching through the floor I haven't seen too much, and it happens both with grenades and without.
---
Relogging helps sometimes.
---
So you got carried by high levels who put up with your nonsense?
---
Lmao
---
ISN'T IT wonderful!! /s
---
Seriously no type to chat is a fucking joke. Its such an obvious must for any MMO or pc game.
---
It works!
---
Add Empath and 3 points of Class Freak for 19% damage reduction.
---
:-)
---
Wait, so there is more to that event than just keeping the place from breaking? I have never successfully completed it.
---
No. If you know the code you just need the keycard
---
It's a blueprint glitch. I predict it will be fixed soon as it's gained a lot of popularity and exposure recently. The machine with eat your camp budget if you try to remove it. Honestly though, I hope this is low on the fix it priority list as it doesn't really affect other players besides the one building it and it still takes time to fill and requires 20 power.
---
Nukashining noobs is a true raider pastime.
---
If you were genuinely realizing it was a joke...genuinely not trying to be a sanctimonious asshole.
---
Your first comment would have read ' Ha, funny  but this could actually be helpful for the deaf community'
---
But, it read ' You do realise deaf people exist (redacted, see original comment) 
---
If you want a debate on issues regarding challenges found by people in the deaf community then do it...
---
Don't try to be a smart arse...
---
I can just hold it down? I keep tapping it over and over.
---
Nah, I am actually the highest in the group.
---
But good roast attempt. 
---
I'm not intimidated by any of your nonsense, but feel free to impress me.
---
In terms of ammo. I literally threw all my 38. and 44. bullets away because I wont use them ever. I would give you some ammo but im PS4 sorry. And just block those kids. I would only give friends ammo and stuff. Btw I also made a mistake by buying shotgun shells for 1 cap each. I didn't have any left and wasn't thinking right :( Anyway have a great day!
---
Throw on Strange in Numbers and run a Public Team and you're bound to get another Mutated person on your team and those positive benefits go up more.
---
Just google the weekly codes. Some nice folks in the community will post the codes as soon as they refresh
---
You're thinking of Tea Time. Sweetwater has a daily called Strange Brew where you can give him 10 honey and he will give you some of his special (alcoholic) tea. It gives a you a temporary +2 boost to Perception as well, and the recipe can drop as well.
---
Edit: grammar
---
Ugh. Elaborate?
---
My other buddies love scaring the shot outta me.😂
---
I never knew that, thanks!
---
Oh no I was trying to be an asshole as well.
---
Edit: as well It wouldn’t of read “ha funny” because it wasn’t.
---
Yep, just hold it down and it crits when full
---
But I thought level didn't matter??
---
That's awesome!
---
Lol I do that to my friend and his gf by popping out of bushes while invisible
---
Absolutely!  This was just the base, since Herd Mentality works even when you’re solo on a Public Team. 
---
With SiN, these numbers go up even more.
---
All that would make sense, but not money - Bethesda Management.
---
True 😂
---
now the fast travel point for my camp is gone
---
To be fair to Bethesda, legendary mobs are not hard to find.
---
Same as you, my early stuff was much better rolls.  Pretty sure they got super nerfed with 20 or something.  I just trashed 50 modules to get an unyielding torso.  Got multiples of practically everything else.
---
Now I have a week of feeding torsos into the scrip machine.  What a horrible joke.
---
They'll yell in area while I'm crafting.
---
Ah. Great! Thanks for the awesome ideas and info. RN I do Marsupial, Carnivore, Grounded, scaly skin and speed demon (now egg head) that -12% doesn’t really bother my NRG weapons.
---
What outfits and masks?
---
Oh that's just cruel lol
---
You'll have to change it to a non window wall. Wall paper it. Then change it back to the window
---
because that would be enjoyable.
---
It doesn't. I formed the group, and they caught on. But your accusation of me getting carried is false. We all helped each other and we all are about the same level. 
---
Still not a reason to call yourself a "Veteran". No matter how many hours you put into the game, with that attitude and that thinking, you'll never be one.
---
No I tested it out you just need the key card
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Yeah it is. But funny.
---
I mean, it is called "Deathclaw Island", right?  That would only make sense.
---
Yep, gone to claim a number or workshops for the challenges and discover that it's already owned.
---
I've found that if you create your own public team it counts toward the Do X while in a group daily challenge. I normally play in a private server and have jumped to a public server to complete this portion of the daily and then as soon as it's done I jump back to my private world. Creating your own public team means that you won't have to bother anyone else, taking up a spot for however brief a time that someone who may want to join and play in that public team.
---
I've recently discovered that this also works in private servers so I won't have to be jumping into public spaces just to complete a challenge.
---
So whats your evidence that you weren't carried if level doesn't Matter?
---
See how Rhetoric works?  You just discredited yourself.
---
I’m level 85 atm and haven’t experienced this issue yet but I’ll keep it in consideration. My sneak perk and chameleon armor served me well so far. 
---
Thank you for your input though.
---
Congratulations?
---
No they dont
---
Tell me.
---
Imagine if it was just the power armor.
---
Stand by for TitanFall
---
Yes it's too tall, like I already mentioned 3 story with a roof is the safe height. Keep in mind this is at the level as the initial placement of your camp module. If you still want a 4th floor, just do a stair going up and a floor with no walls or ceiling. You may be able to place small decorations on the top floor as long as they aren't too tall or require power. Sometimes when you build the top boundary is just above the 4th floor but below ceiling height.
---
Its based on poly count not size when determining how much budget something takes up. Its been that way since fo4
---
I elaborate a bit further up.
---
I have a fancy Combat Shotgun (the one from pleasant valley claim tickets) and it is also one of the “magic” shotguns. Don’t use it often, my bloodied plasma caster does the same job better, but it’s still fun to play around with.
---
Because it costs 10 steal u guess..
---
Yeah I found a couple sites that post them, it just wasn't clear from their info if you still needed the code pieces on hand or not.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Those\_Obnoxious\_Aliens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Those_Obnoxious_Aliens)
---
An alien race known as the [Oni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oni) arrive on [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth)  to invade the planet. Instead of taking over the planet by force, the  Oni give humans a chance to fight for the rights to the planet by taking  part in a competition.
---
Thank you.
---
I know. I don't take any credit for carrying, nor do I take credit for being carried.
---
We all worked together, how is that so hard for your brain to understand?
---
Me too and yes! Feel sick right nor but maybe later?
---
Excellent, I know how I will be spending my evening tonight :)
---
That would work too, I have always hatted that you could just stuff it up your a**. I really enjoyed FO4's take. I don't use PA so I could see why people would dislike this.
---
Idk man I saw a group of cultists at a random encounter in a nuke zone and all of them were wearing black hazmat suits. Next me I see I will screen cap it.
---
I just did this to get the level up challenge, I killed 3 legendary scorchbeasts, 2 regular SB, and a host of scorched. Leveled up, boom- and got a 1* Bloodied handmade for my trouble.
---
I had a kid less than subtly askbutnotasking for my fusion cores once, when the while partybagreed to a boot its great
---
You literally said you’re tired of spending caps to travel to the encryptid event to have it fail.
---
So the high fire rate guns like minigun lmg and energy guns if they have limb, damage 33 vats, or bashing damage as long as they are over 200 rpm should work do not use vats, for shot guns either one of those attributes but only works when u shoot in vats
---
I'm level 34 and have excavator armor, so I saw a lvl 6 last night and was going to give him my lvl 15 raider armor but when I traded with him I couldn't give it to him. I now know that you can't trade power armor. Oh well.  
---
...can somebody explain to me how I even communicate with another player if I don't have mic? ...and how I can give them my power armor?
---
Yeah generally events fail when you leave the session
---
Why tho
---
Good on being nice but never do anything for someone unless they deserve it.
---
Not just you.   About half the time they're not showing the icons of the people who own them.
---
Ehhh.... it’s doable, you just gotta plan for it. The right buffs (the alcohol perk+ vodka = 15 more health even below 20%; psychobuff gives you a bit too, then there’s food buffs for endurance or HP; then the life giver perk) will get your HP high enough. Rock the +stim power perk, load up on full strength stims, and get yourself a vampire Gatling laser and use the +fusion core perk. Bam, 1000 rounds of vampiric healing, a decent HP cushion, and some big “oh shit” stims as needed. I can tank the pylons and the squatch at the same time on my bloodied HW / PA build. Non-PA does well with a full set of Troubleshooter’s.
---
The blade of bastet does not have 100% armor penetration, it has increased armor penetration. Even the anti armor legendary prefix has only 50%. So yes, you can greatly benefit from incisor. As far as not using atleast first aid, you're running a perk that is not necessary so why not benefit from something actually helpful. Melee weapons rarely break and are cheap to fix so no need for running that perk.
---
Also unless you're role-playing by wearing the garb youre shooting yourself in the foot for ER and DR. You have level 3 sneak and escape artist on already, so you're nearly invisible to all enemies. You could wear a full set of armor with actual legendary attributes and put muffled on your legs and be just as sneaky as wearing a dress with no ER or DR. 
---
Anyways, just trying to help. Seems you think you know what you're doing so good luck.
---
Screw bouillon, scrips, and bottle caps. Let’s just use flamingos as currency and unit of measurements.
---
What repair atlas community event?
---
When you loaded the game did you peruse the atom shop or go into NW first?  That also seems to exasperate the problem.
---
Xbox?
---
I have a glitch where I'm not on my friends social tab and so he has to make one for me to join his team
---
How charitable.
---
Holy shit the vamp actually keeps you alive? I was expecting it to be to much damage. I have a VE plasma gat my friend gave me ages ago
---
Everything seems to depend on the current server. Sneak, vats, damage, etc. Sometimes they work Sometimes they don't.
---
it's broken as hell and i lost my camp
---
It's one of the best in Xp and legendaries terms, but lately It fucks up fast travelling
---
Exactly! When I first started playing, I did like 5-10levels on reg and got bored. Then I moved over to survival with a new char and man, I was running for my life. I had to plan everything thing out if I was heading out for scrounge up stuff. It was intense af!
---
It's nice to have modes like that, especially pvp. I don't like consent when it comes to pvp. EVE instilled it into me, if you are playing you are more than likely gonna die to another player and I love that
---
Bruh, at level 350. You know the ropes.
---
I found that one out a while ago, but to add to it, you can hold the back button to leave the machine entirely, no matter how many screens you went through.
---
My camp is above hopewell. Lots of visitors.
---
Visual glitch prolly. I've never heard or seen that haha
---
No worries friend.  Happy Nuking
---
Nobody knows but might still be a few weeks away since it was only recently datamined
---
Good to know, thanks
---
I did not however, I tried to log straight into adventure, found a world and everything and as soon as I spawned in I disconnected cause of awful internet
---
It honestly feels pretty sad watching some of the louder and more persistent white knights... they are trapped in an abusive relationship with Bethesda and absolutely have to rationalize that everything is fine.
---
Which also means tearing down someone who damn well should be an ally in making this a BETTER game.
---
That's... pretty rude.
---
You using the new vault tec camp Deployment?
---
I was really experimenting with it the other day and found this to be the easiest way to use it. Also, you can use it to make cheap fuel. Under energy ammo they have 10mm for some reason, but if you select it you get flammer fuel. If you make a bunch of cheap ammo you can convert it to fuel at a much cheaper rate than crafting it. It's frickin tedious as all hell, but free fuel is free.
---
He is joking dude.
---
Bro hes a low lvl food build give him a break
---
I no longer accept trade offers from people I don’t know. Not long ago, a kid (could tell because he had a mic) asked to trade, and I thought “sure, why not?” Then I see a “requested” next to my ***Final Word.
---
I feel like he looked through my inventory and thought, “That’s a sweet gun. I want that one.” 
---
I know it’s a sweet gun. That’s why I have it. It’s arguably the best gun I have. And no, it’s not for sale.
---
Same mentality at work. And that is what made me realize that accepting random trade requests is a waste of time.
---
Those guys are nuts. A few of them jumped off buildings to their deaths to try to get within firing range of me.
---
It seems to be a bug with the wooden walls only, works fine on the other wall types
---
don't use the future tech skin
---
yeah, anti griefing is one thing but it’s ridiculous how they’ve literally just taken pvp out of the game
---
This is the only way to do it. 2 successful server hops and you're done.
---
Commando/heavy non PA. works well as I get to use my fixer and handmade for normal combat and gauss minigun for SBQ.  Just looking at things for my armour as I haven’t really delved into it that much. I’ve got all pieces and mods, so it’s just a case of rolling it till I find decent legendary effect.
---
Except in UF, about 3/4s of the players one-shot the legendaries.  Only a guaranteed thing if you do it on private server.
---
Nope just the keycard. You have to enter the code to launch the nuke and if you screw up it eats the keycard but you don’t need any code pieces in your inventory
---
There definitely are NPCs with reskinned hazmat suits. I saw a camo one once, so I don't think it's much of a stretch that there'd be a black one.
---
The proper answer is unyielding.  Even if you hate running bloodied, you should be running bloodied.  Any goal you have in the game, be it sneaky, gaining xp, carrying loot, being lucky, crafting, getting caps etc. is all helped most by unyielding.
---
it's the future tech camp system that's broken
---
Man, only people who get griefed are the ones refusing to figure out a way pass it. I never understood that concept. Like it's another obstacle to get over and actually adds to the immersion.
---
You think raiders are gonna be like, oh this is a noob area, move on. Heeeeellll nah lmao
---
Just a PSA for everyone - the glitch can happen even logging in hours after the timer reset, and without the game opening crash. There's literally nothing you can do to avoid it completely.
---
When she asks for lewd pics and you send a Flamingo for scale.
---
What bench can you craft it in?
---
Cool, thanks. Is there a negative to this if I’m not a bloodied build?
---
I tried warning people its gonna happen. People starting following and crying cause i dont give my fixers / armors and so on. Stopped accepting trades a long time ago
---
No it ruins the game.
---
Both heavy guns and shotguns? I was actually enjoying using shotguns again...
---
You need enough damage reduction, but PA+emergency protocols is like ~70% flat reduction before armor is factored in; full Troubleshooter’s is... 75% reduction from robots, so everything at Encryptid. 
---
And vampiric weapons heal a small, set amount per shot. I think 2hp. But a Gatling laser shoots about 20rds a second, so...
---
The trick is surviving long enough that you can actually start using your laser on the Imposter. So you need those boosted stims while running around snatching the pylons. Once you can target the imposter, the laser should keep you alive.
---
*edit* I should add that I have a second, 15charisma account sharing appropriate perks and using Empath+SiN, so I do have more capabilities than a solo player. I can add something like Suppressor from my alt while tanking, etc, and SiN Empath is like 33% damage reduction (factored in with all my other damage reduction it’s really more like 10%, but every little bit helps! )
---
Charleston Capitol Building, I always find 3 legendary ghouls and get a significant chunk of my level up completed as well!
---
today, kill 3 deathclaws.
---
There's no surefire method to avoid the bug.
---
There are a lot of likely reasons, but none that are 100% true.
---
This is why I never pvp anyone. Even when someone has wanted status I know that many of them get it without actually meaning to. The only time I ever actually hunted someone down was when a level 22 picked the lock on my raider collectron down near Watoga, took the chems and left the booze. I used to leave it unlocked but no one ever took the booze and it would get full and stop collecting chems. Just gave him a thumbs down and left his scrap but man it pisses me off an unnatural amount when people don't take those heavy beer bottles too.
---
Because the flamingos are just a plan you find randomly. The others you have to buy from Bethe$da
---
Chem workbench
---
I wanna say it has something to do with the geometry, 13 flamingos have more triangles than a billboard. but that doesn't explain how one billboard isn't equal to another.
---
I think it’s 100 % fair that you can’t trade gold bullion stuff. It’s end game items. Each player has to grind it for themselves... not let their level 500 friend make it all for them. 
---
Or worse, some duper stock his vending with it and sell it for 300 caps a piece.  It’s something you have to work for on your own and isn’t effected by the player economy. It’s on the gold standard. I think it’s nice to have some items like that.
---
It just works.
---
Of you want to rock the jetpack you'll want at least two piece's with fall damage reduction. If you manage to snag some AP refresh piece's all the better.
---
Sometimes the icons don't show up for the Workshop, sometimes it shows the Workshop as not being owned at all. Happened a lot for me at Hemlock Holes this past weekend for some reason--tried to claim it before I realized it was already owned and nearly got my ass kicked a few times.
---
This. 
---
If the server is running SBQ successfully, I take that as a good sign for other events. 
---
It’s luck of the draw whether you have a server full of event players or full of people all focused on their own stuff. It’s always a good idea to take the pulse of the server via other events before launching Encryptid. I’ve seen servers with so few players interested in events that I wound up running Uranium Fever solo. If the players seem like they won’t be into it, I either server hop or just save my keycard for another day.
---
Fallout 4 had an alright build menu
---
Not sure exactly what item you bought but most likely under "lights"
---
Weight Limit Based Gentleness
---
Deep pockets limbs, ultra light limbs and a bright headlamps for both regular and power armor helmet
---
Just now I rolled 2 3* Vanguard chest pieces... the game knows I completed my set and now will give me the rolls.
---
Ouch.
---
Currently using typical Non-PA Bloodied Heavy build that's more for QoL playthrough (weight reduction on HGs and food/drinks). Might switch out the Bear Arms for other perks as I don't really maximize my weight limit anyway. 
---
Really only using non-PA right now to maximize EXP gains for the season, once that's over I'm switching back to PA because I love it and I don't die.
---
Add a DPS meter!
---
FYI. This won’t work on a public server unless you are joining a friend in the server. When you leave a public server you will be assigned a new server when you go back in.
---
Chances for paints are pretty low. I’ve been turning in data for months and only have 2/7
---
I don’t think you lost anything. Imo you gained a lesson in humility and a ton of karma for giving the guy a good weapon.
---
Considering that in your case the "legendary run cursor makes the whole thing laggy", I'd say it's not on Beth (in this case)...
---
You are not playing via wifi and have IPv6, DS, DS-Lite disabled and use only IPv4, are not using borderless window, are not playing together with friends from other regions?
---
I'm getting messages of people I'm not even near asking for decent weapons cause mine are bad and I can't get good ones. Even if I had decent ones to give which I normally do just drop for people. Your level 10  my weapons are level 50. No go to you sir now leave me alone
---
Erm you basically become a husk that's controlled by scorchbeasts so it wouldn't make sense to be able to catch it.
---
Oh, I meant that this is a faction that I've created
---
you dont say.... o.O i meant "what does it do, exactly, which kind of details..." but i guess i can find it described somewhere
---
Today or last week?  Weeklies reset tomorrow so if they are complete right now...it's because you did them.
---
People might be discouraged if you're under 50 as it means they're probably going to have to do everything for you.
---
Also if you're crouching (hidden) you don't show up on the map and the event looks empty so again people might not show up.
---
Do it immediately after a successful SBQ or Project Paradise.
---
Only time I've seen one where people didn't show up is one that I logged in to.  Went to it only to discover it had been abandoned with 10 minutes left.  Still completed it as a few other people showed up once I was there.
---
nope. it's a bug on more weapons as well
---
You have to get used to missing a huge deathclaw in front of you that you have a 95% chance to hit but then kill the bloatfly with 0% chance 200 metres away behind a tree. 
---
if you need to go in and out and then in to VATS first. Most of the time that works
---
Use 1 rank of gun fu BTW
---
Yes I saw a camo one as well!!! The camo one is sic too.
---
Interesting idea, but doesn’t fully track with what we see in the story, particularly Wastelanders. Trying not to venture too far into spoilers. Inoculation prevents infection, but there is no cure once infection sets in. Given how annoyingly illogical diseases are in this game, they got the scorch plague right. If anything, I want more vaccines.
---
any blue prints are automatically interfering with existing objects
---
yeah, nobody enters pvp willingly. the only people who pvp are griefers who get tagged after events then shoot people and steal their junk.
---
It IS wonderful. Wonderfully quiet. And if you really want text chat on PC, you can download a free mod off NexusMods.
---
Science
---
Its such a shame, at the very least Im happy this didnt happen with double score active
---
On which part, I'll gladly do my best.
---
It changes depending on your inventory.
---
I would say most people's playstyle would lean towards bandolier + pharmacy, with packrat or bear arms sometimes being worthwhile swapping in.  Rarely will Strong Back be the best but it's possible.
---
I think its Bos, whitesprings, powder jumpsuits and urban and forest scout masks
---
Tried it already. I met 3 people who used it.
---
All you need is a valid code form one of the sites And a nuke keycard.  Make sure you are in the right silo for the code!
---
Troubleshooters or AA weapons are helpful n the silos.  Crouch at intersections.  When you hear the turrets ratchet, back up, locate, snipe.  (Targeting hud on PA helps locate them.)
---
That is interesting indeed. I'll have to check it out myself and see what I can find out, I just don't want the dumb thing to mess up my camp.
---
I am a fairly low level player (24) and I use it sometimes. It is a gigantic pain in the ass.
---
It is a lot of fun but being a low level the first time I played I was NOT prepared for those legendary ghouls at all. The whole area there is really cool though!
---
Just because you don't like it, that doesn't make it a bug.
---
The first few times no cause I thought it'd pack up my camp and I'd have to replace it next world hop, but now after some research I always stick around. It's not that often I see people build up on Seneca. Last base I encountered left something to be desired as far as base layout goes (it was mostly a giant box), but it had a really cool mothman church vibe going!
---
The worst is when they don't have an active shop / public team and I have to climb to the top.
---
It will just miss and there's not much you can do about it. Make sure you have Skeet Shooter, it definitely helps. The Gauss Shotgun is probably the best weapon in the game imo... When it's working. As you use it more and get used to it's quirks you'll be VATSing down armies of Super Mutants in seconds... You'll be shooting them through walls, literally.
---
I can already tell you're gonna get downvoted into the 7th level of hell
---
I had it two days ago. Put 2 down. Don't remember where... Went in today to put in a different variation-they were gone from menus! 🤦🏾‍♂️
---
I've had to repair my shotgun twice during one event.  The hardened reciever makes it only shoot around 40 rounds.
---
Well I'm talking about the plans on a vendor. I thought they were a available that way but I'm having a hard time finding
---
I risked it once by taking note of a random players name.
---
When i went to join they were offline. I had to message and ask for an invite and i had to lie about why i needed an invite.
---
Most seem to agree on that indeed. I’m changing to bandolier and pharmacy when get home tonight.
---
I wish strangers on the internet no such luck.
---
You were big mad in your reply and are trying to play it off as the "cool guy" lmao.
---
Really lame tbh
---
You're actually doing them a favor OP, there's no good reason to be wanted and you should want someone to kill you as soon as possible lol
---
First time I took Nukashine, it popped me down by that unfinished Vault in the NW corner of the map, not terribly far from where I started.
---
There should be like a small chance it places you somewhere extremely random, like, back inside Vault 76 somehow, or the normally inaccessible peak of Seneca Rocks, or The Deep.
---
I would also have the benefits of drinking it be something more alluring than just a temporary boost to a few stats such as unarmed damage and AP regen. Chances are anyone you give it to hoping they'll drink it right away, wont; because they'll think 'oh I'd better save this for when it might be useful, and what does it mean it causes blackouts'.
---
If it say, gave a significant amount of XP for drinking (obviously properly balanced so you couldn't just farm XP by drinking Nukashine but then the random teleportation should make that impractical anyway), that would be something you wouldn't wait and save it for another time, you'd drink it right away.
---
I tend to let everything go to meat piles because I use bloody mess, but in Cranberry Bog the terrain is not great and meat piles kind of blend in with the environment. Because of this I started using a mod called make balloons not meat piles, and it has worked really well so far. Immersion breaking for sure, but I haven't lost a legendary corpse since then.
---
When contesting workshops for pvp , it's polite to do a mic check and ask if they're down to fight. Or use an emote and look for thumbs up or down. I do those things, but I don't expect the same in return , if roles were reversed. If I take a workshop, I throw down my turret nightmare blueprint, and use a comic book to buff turret damage. But most don't use them for pvp , so I like to be considerate.
---
you change the name and i am in
---
Yea i have that sign even tho its budget heavy i love it for the theme of my bar
---
Didn't realize they patched that recently, thanks. So to be clear if it says "base cannot be placed do you want to relocate?" or whatever, i can choose to stay on the world and so long as i don't place my C.A.M.P. I'm fine to wander about?
---
One warning though. Sometimes the game will crash. And when you go back in the stuff is gone. This happened to me twice. Even though i started the game back up straight away i lost about 20 mostly scrap legendary weapons and a load of ammo including 20k of 5.56. So i wouldn't risk moving anything valuable.
---
Great idea , but it doesn't make them money. Chances of implementation are incredibly low. Fully agree with you, however.
---
my camp 2 years of hard work is ruined now
---
5015 weapons with the mods that reduce vats usage and grim reapers sprint are nasty!
---
I too have suffered the wrath of the impossibly annoying open mic, yet another good reason on the list. Totally spaced it!
---
thanks
---
A very harsh truth, you stay wanted until a player kills you.
---
Agreed. Workshop Persistence would be a welcome addition.
---
Yeah and we will get more with each gamę/dlc.
---
Best use of intentional game design! Upvote!
---
The event coming up next month to build up Atlas Observatory in preparation for the BoS to return. Players will be doing something along the lines of providing resources so construction bots can repair it.
---
They're talking about the extractors in uranium fever, not the turrets in radiation rumble which I believe you're talking about.  There are no turrets in uranium fever.
---
It’s an awesome feeling no matter what the level you’re at. Launched one the other day and it’s super fun, until the game crashes when the Queen is halfway dead.
---
Changed the name to The Revelation
---
Always interesting to see which daily people will complain about on the days when NW just has you deploy your camp.
---
Sorry to hear bud. Change the camp module skin back to original. If you are in ps4 I could help you rebuild your dwelling and give you some pointers. I love building almost as much as shooting and looting in this game.
---
There’s been a couple other comments here similar about not making them money.
---
That’s just being cynical for no reason. They have made lots of changes to the game that don’t make them money.
---
Haha, nice one.
---
Mods on PC.  For the rest of us console plebs we can only hear tales of the mods that make the game infinitely more playable on a computer.
---
That's on you. My server is always full and I don't get a single drop of lag. Sorry
---
Scrap his chair and summon him back? Or summon a different ally and summon him back after that.
---
That’s your call, friend. I won’t hold it against you.
---
I've already tried it but it's still broken
---
If you mean the neon no vacancy and go away signs. I found them in lights. They have to be wired also.
---
Abso freaking lutely. "my camp couldn't be place because of THIS?!"
---
I be happy with a map key to filter out location types.
---
Bro same. Hahahahaha
---
Hate mail? Probably capital G gamers are so classy.
---
My character I'm playing now is my raider char and it's so difficult RPing an asshole character who is only it in for himself...Sometimes I wish there was a RP server.
---
Anywho glad you found some people to brighten your day. I know what it's like living with a slew of mental health issues. Shit is literal hell sometimes but I think in a way it can teach you empathy if you learn to accept them and care for yourself.
---
All in all good job and fuck the hate mail senders. They probably watch Youtube reactionary videos all day and post on kotakuinaction.
---
I’ve always wondered this too. Maybe they just want to be the leader or are going to have their friends join
---
This may be my favourite comment I've ever read in r/fo76.
---
Sorry to hear mate. There's no shame in starting over. I've rebuilt hundreds of camps.
---
I’ll live without the PC version after seeing the steal peoples inventory hack that was on there.
---
This reminds of being a passenger in a warthog when playing the original Halo. “You take the gun Chief!” Aaaaand off the cliff we go.
---
Well that's just annoying...
---
I'll wear that fact as a badge of honor
---
It's not for no reason - it's based in almost 2 years of the game being live. How many bugs / quality of life improvements that the playerbase has been screaming about since release haven't been inokemented, whereas atom shop updates, fixes and extra content to get people to rejoin and buy the game have gone ahead. 
---
I enjoy the game as lot, but I'm critical because it could be so much more. People have to remember they're a business and making money IS the #1 priority no matter what anyone wants to think. Not a judgement, a fact. How many times has the Atom shop been broken / unavailable? How often have they delayed the new atom shop releases? Should tell you all you need to know.
---
This^!
---
Post on imgur and copy the link
---
Does that work I've been having the same issue he won't take the weapon cache off me he told me to get he got on my nerves so much I dressed him up like a girl😂
---
There are more legendary effects that make shotguns magical than the three you mentioned. Check out Angry Turtle’s new video on magic weapons. Also, the easiest way to tell if a shotgun is magical is to see if you get a single number in a VATS shot or several. If there are several numbers, the shotgun is magical.
---
It's a shame they can't be traded to other that know the plans. I rolled so many good vanguard pieces.
---
Add me Getbust3d
---
My guess was that they wanted all trades to be for caps vs for direct items
---
Why would you go into the Battle Royale mode for role play?
---
Armor kinda needs to be visible in a fully Pvp mode
---
Did you read the part where I said I hopped severs multiple times and each time it was completely empty? You people on here are such pretentious douche bags.
---
How do you not hold people accountable for their opinions lmao???  
---
This is all you know of me and I have been quite nasty to you......you should definitely hold it against me.
---
It's all so fake and tiresome
---
I think your perception is biased.
---
Did you read the part where I said I hopped multiple severs and each one was empty???
---
Can you build a camp there?
---
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with nuka cola I have made four characters and each one will name it different during the quest so I can mule all four options to one character... The ultimate nuka cola collector. He's gonna be the great great great grandfather of Sheffield from fallout 4.
---
Oh, I knew about the BoS return, didn't realize we had gotten more details than that. Thanks!
---
I'd recommend teaching people where to find and make essentials instead of giving it to them. Remember the ol' saying, give a man a fish and feed him for a day, teach him to fish and feed him for life.
---
I thought there were only three flavors
---
it is, yes. So far it's only gotten me once.
---
Flamingos is the budget measurement we've all needed. Please Bethesda. Please.
---
Graninger (however its spelled) farm does as well. Just server hop. Got 3 in 10 minutes or less
---
Best event in the game currently if a fo1st tent has been placed in a certain spot.  No waiting for the waves, they spawn every 10 to 15 seconds and the xp gain is insane. As an added bonus you'll walk away with 1500 steel if you pickup and scrap everything.
---
Oops, you're correct. There are only 3 options.
---
Yikes, never heard about that one. I’ll take the infamous punch bowl glitch anyway over that.
---
Losing SCORE due to the autocomplete bug is way worse.
---
Upvoted
---
Yes, this is currently bugged. When you first log into the game you will be able to see the typical workshop symbol. However, as soon as you server hop, quit to the menu then re join etc, you will no longer be able to see the symbol. The best way I have found to fix this is by fully quitting out of the game then starting again. There is an upside to this though, if were in a team you should then be able to rejoin the same server that you just left.
---
Thank you, that is indeed helpful.
---
What helmet/mask is that?
---
Server hopping death claw island provides all the black titanium i ever need. Re-spawns every time
---
Change to a diffrent wall, put on paper change back to wood wall. Lemmie know if this still works plz.
---
i remember back at launch, i accidentally got wanted and ran around begging people to kill me. nobody did. they all ran away from me. had to wait for a friend to get online to shoot me in the face.
---
to this day i will never understand why *I* was the one person people didnt feel like killing
---
West-Tek building usually has 3-4 legendary muties to kill
---
You can go to the cookie cutter builds, builds that are the most flattering to the game design, and study em. Just because you spent points nillywilly doesnt mean they might not end up in your favor agn at some point.. You'd be surprised how fast you level past 50. It took way less time from 50 to 100 than it did for me to go 1 to 50. As mentioned in the comments, build according to your playstyle first, using what you have and making note of what you'd want to improve on. Strategy comes later after 50. Save up those points for a bit once you level past 50. Maybe even go unyielding to level up faster with a boosted intellect.
---
Helps if you have played other mmo or rpg games, or played other fallouts and already know what you tend to like. 76 is like playing on very very easy. How prepared do you want to be for pve or pvp. What kind of balance between pvp and pve... This is a game that is more pve oriented, unless you count nuclear winter. Are you going to play in a group or play solo more? There is balance there too. Instead of using lone wanderer, use bodyguards. Little switchs outs on your build, like using sun kissed to remove some rads and then putting radicool back in. there are medic/healer procs and shit too. In mmorpgs, healers are usually the least popular since ppl want to be fedora master dps... You might be able to figure out a build where you can keep your stats and switch out cards to run a slightly different build. And maybe different weapons and armors too with slightly different stats. or combine pieces and mess around till you get what you rly want. I used bolstering with unyielding till i got more unyieldings. At purveyor just get the one star armors and weapons so you have more chances to get the basic pieces for your desired build. After getting some secret service buttressed, and not the generic one star ones from purveyor: when you get better armor, you can move more points around again, less emphasis on dmg resistance and maybe more on dmg reduction.... Ish like this. With a lot in strength, i can play unarmed, two handed, or one handed. I find there is lots of hybrid type playing, like i did a stealth melee to help me play solo to lvl 50. At lvl 50 and onward, pve becomes mostly cheese and you dont even need insanely high dps to one shot stuff, but... It is still fun use sneak times the bloodied nerd rage on shit OP, and mutations make the game feel like cheats enabled mode lol. You can have mutations and not run low health, just lock it in with starched genes. 
---
Tldr; idk honestly just rambling
---
Legendary armors and weapons clue-in how to spec your build. Of course the bloodied weapons deal more dmg low health. Unyielding adds +3 to each stat except endurance. That's the easiest build to conceptually play. Lock in the mutations you want, and just get any unyielding pieces to fill out the stats, till you can begin fine tuning those.
---
Sloopy noodles
---
This works too I believe.
---
Some people do, but it's a hastle to set up. Might actually start doing it, set up tourneys for prizes.
---
That was the good thing about survival. If ya are on, you are willing to participate.
---
Runescape does this [quite well](https://runescape.wiki/w/Grand_Exchange) with their grand exchange, and you never directly communicate with the buyer/seller. 
---
You get 3-4 trade slots, can load each slot with an item and set your price or list a buy offer and if a seller lists it within your range it sells to you. When buying, your money is stored in the bank while the offer stands, and you get it back if you cancel otherwise it goes to the seller upon completion. When selling the item is stored in the bank.
---
With a few modifications like an offer system for example: someone lists a j/e plasma for 30k, you can offer 20k, and the seller can say yes/no or you can cancel the request and get your offered caps back.
---
Sales have a listing fee. 
---
Would be a godsend in addition to player vending.
---
Lately every SBQ or Encrypted event I join barely has 4 people and I end up wasting tons of ammo and gear condition for nothing. It’s so disappointing
---
Weird.
---
Silly Beth.
---
Well done!  But, how do we change the selected item in the calculator?
---
the minutemen was a thing long before Fallout, buddy. totally possible a different group would use the name.
---
I suspect you might be mixing a lot of different things into one "bloodied problem" just because players doing something weird have low hp. 
---
Its not the case because damage that melts bosses is not coming from bloodied builds/weapons. Single shotting of trash mobs is possible in any build. So problem you might be experiencing in the events (and where else?) have nothign to do with bloodied per se.
---
Here is the today Angry Turtle video which explains magic damage which does insane amount of damage independently of the build (and no clean bloodied can catch that damage) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Maybe that video will change the perspective a little on why bosses do die fast currently in the game.
---
I had just assumed it was because sometimes when you try to place a basic item, the game is like, "no, FU, you're out of budget."
---
Raider Skull Gas Mask - Was in atom shop while ago
---
Huzzah!!!!!
---
The raider mask they had in the store a while back, there's a white in the legendary run, towards the end
---
Funny you mention that, the unfinished vault in the NW corner was my most recent spawn location! I was super excited because I’m probably about 400 hours in and had never seen it before. 
---
Hmm ... I wish I could remember where I first ended up on Nukashine. I got a concussion not too long afterwards so I don’t think I’ll be able to recall that one :/
---
That would be super cool if you can go back in to Vault 76 from it. The spawn location is your old room that you start the game in haha. 
---
That’s fair! I’d like something like that too. This is why I prefer to put Nukashine in my punch bowl rather than sell it at my vendor or hand it out to Noobs. I like to know that I sent someone on a Nukashine trip in real time (even if I don’t know that someone drank it until I return to my CAMP and check, but at least I know it was real time when it happened haha).
---
Unfortunately you have to take a copy of the spreadsheet to do that...
---
Man that sounds so cool. I always wear the Chinese stealth suit when I need to be in nuke zones, but I really hate how it looks compared to the hazmat suits. It is funny going around without a helmet on in all that radiation though lol.
---
Care to elaborate? What's my bias?
---
fast travel that doesn't travel 10 times in a row is the one who make me loose my shit.
---
40 scrip is 40 scrip
---
Oh god I wish
---
I typically hunt them then guard their dropped items just to help them rid the bounty
---
Waking up in a cave next to that sleeping Yau Guai on the whitespring golf course... man what a night...
---
back when the game was scary.. people probably thought it was a trap when you came around
---
Yep! You can check Inside the Vault from I think a week or 2 ago or some of the youtubers like JuiceHead. 
---
There’s also 2 new radio stations with messages you can listen to. One you can figure out pretty easily on your own and has some cool little bits of information letting us know how the BoS are returning and why. sorta
---
Oh no. Is it that bad? To be honest, I haven't even bothered to craft any of the items I've unlocked so far.
---
I have a couple fond memories of chasing around low levels with bounties, shooting at their feet with my exploding handmade while yelling "dance, Spider, dance!" over comms.
---
But did you try hopping servers. We came in here with suggestions and you call us douche bags man all that pent up hate I hope you never complete a challenge again.
---
You might as well go bloodied now. Before the SCORE system it was just for high damage and the other benefits like sneak and vendor prices which not everyone seems to care about.
---
Now the int is important because 15 int is 30% bonus exp towards your score challenges.
---
My hub has his camp next to the thunder mountain substation, every time someone fast travel there a deathclaw appears, no matter how often, so i recommend going there too
---
Having Party Boy / Girl equipped should increase the length of time the lunchbox effect has as well.   Not every party animal needs drugs and alcohol to have fun!
---
i was level 7. what was i gonna "trap" them with? my pipe gun? lol
---
Yeah, but using food gives you the edge in PVP, especially with the Carn/Herb changes.
---
Try out Dodgy on a Company Tea Herbivore.
---
Or the edit button.
---
It is possible to disagree with someone without  holding a lesser opinion of them, as I have chosen to do here. If, in your words, you have been quite nasty to me, that’s your decision. It’s my decision to not be affected by that or take it personally. 
---
It’s for that reason and my personal beliefs that I really, honestly, and truly hope you are happy, healthy, and have good luck. 
---
Play the game the way you want to if that is what makes you happy. Vent your frustrations here instead of bottling them if that’s what keeps you healthy. I don’t know you, as you said, or your life. Doesn’t mean I can’t wish you the best. 
---
Which I do, friend.
---
Only Todd knows.
---
I assume most mid-low level players are alts or mules unless its right after something like a big sale, free weekend or the gamepass thing
---
Follow up-- I have found sites that explain how the nuclear codes are decoded, but in all playing time I never actually found the info about how to decode them *in the game*. I found the info about needing the 8 pieces, and the repeatable quest for hunting them down, but where do you find the info in the game about the keyword cypher? or did people just deduce that's what it was based on the letters that appear on the wall in the bunker?
---
Since the beginning, yes. I judge your camp.
---
Few of mine seem to be in common spots now though.
---
Unbelievably weak.
---
They actually need to rethink -all- of their UI, starting with the vendor price dialog which should have a spinbox for each digit (like a combination lock)
---
Great thoughts! It doesn’t even have to be complex, just being able to find the exact items you’re looking for without jumping all over Reddit and making caps a usable currency again for endgame are already 2 necessary changes. A system like what you described would solve multiple issues and improve a lot of game aspects Bethesda has already implemented
---
Happens to me everytime I first load in I’m on Xbox also Xbox one x and it is annoying
---
I think there should be less instanced areas to create more loot scarcity. However, there should "instanced dungeons" that you could queue for with the options you mentioned.
---
The reason the mobs were low level on the alt means a high level player hasn't been through the area in a while. There are a few different tiers of mob levels depending on your current level, mob type, and biome location. You must be on the low tier of ghoul species for the cran bog due to your level. I believe the level tiers go less than 50, 50-80, then 80+. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Your 3 mates hiding in a bush with Stealth boys and fully modded weapons
---
What I do is just go in pip boy and pick what I want until it stops doing that
---
Exactly. With bloodied ,not even the extra damage is attactive on that perk.
---
Awwww man I'm on xbox but I got very lucky the one guy was gonna sell me a 1 star for 8k, but got the trade bug over and over and had to head back to work ( was on my lunch break) and dude just gave it to me for free!!!! So I would like to pay it forward somehow so if any newly lev 50s on xbox need a decent bloodied or junkies weapon to start there biuld I'd love to help.
---
What's the rush from?
---
Shooting some newbs that have no clue you are there and are unable to fight back?
---
Yaaaay! /s
---
Don't worry, Reddit have downvotes in every post.
---
50-60 steel to constantly repair them because people just don't give a rip.
---
Make yourself some smoked mirelurk fillets, +40 carry weight/breath under water for 90 minutes.
---
No shit?
---
Bless that person
---
Even with the normal variant its not so bad, takes some time but the waves dont have much in between
---
Had this on PC as well. I learned that if you do away with all the useless holotapes and notes it improves performance. If you’re new then you probably shouldn’t have too much in your inventory anyway so that’s weird. May be worth a try.
---
With the eye of ra and garb the blade has 100% armor penetration. And yes it is a role play alt build. It is not a min max build. I could definitely make a stealth melee build that could get more damage output with legendaries and the like but that isn't the point of the build. You are right i could get rid of makeshift warrior and redistribute those points somewhere else.
---
There are times when my stealth is broken and since my er and dr is so low the phantom device gets me out of that jam and puts me back into hidden. 
---
This build works really well. I have not felt handicapped by it in any way. Of course a bloodied/uny or junkies build will out perform it but Penny (that's her name btw) stays true to her sisterhood.
---
I’ve Been lucky to kill two of them now no matter what can’t get it to spawn. But it was lousy gear but god it took so many queen fights to get a explosive rifle. Even tho it was a stupid nocturnal assault rifle I will never sell it or scrip it being it took ages to get it lol
---
I've done this but not because I don't want to join other groups. Sometimes I start out with private, then switch to public. I do however join other public groups if I don't start off as a private group. So for me it just depends where I'm at gameplay wise.
---
That’s actually really helpful, it’s usually limited to one or two enemies in an area, I’ll just melee them
---
I wish more low level players knew they can just tag an enemy, I'll mop them up they just need to do a bit of damage. I've been rezed by more low level players than 100+ so I really have no problem with them.
---
Ps4
---
Two shot Tesla is a better tag than quad, less chance of killing accidentally.
---
A two shot explosive ballistic is also bueno
---
Its a shame the blast doesnt kill them.
---
Just switch people I had that happen with space ship girl and forager
---
The Scorch Plague turns 95% of people infected into a highly irradiated petrified corpses. The other 5% basically become a variant type of ghoul. Its highly accurate and makes no sense at all to have it act like Snot Ear for example. Innoculation is the only way to make sure you can safely fight back against them.
---
I'm ashamed to admit I'm on 95 or something
---
this is for bloodied build. (typed, copied, and pasted by me) 
---
obviously [nerd rage] any level is a must, most people max it out though, I use [iron clad] level 5 to give me a hell of a lot more resistance, [serendipity] max level is an absolute must. I cant think of anymore perks off the top of my head at the moment.
---
     
---
with the right build and gear, you will find yourself almost never dying, and you will also be doing the most damage output in the game. 
---
this is a copy and paste reply, some things I said might not be very helpful to you or relevant to you, but if you want, just look up bloodied build on youtube and you should get a pretty good idea of what to do
---
edit: forgot about these,(old copy and paste) bloody mess, fireproof, blocker, starched genes, class freak.
---
true, but with more score required as you continue through the levels, it kinda makes more sense to hold onto those atoms til you're closer to the end
---
The thing is though, it was right next to the dark matter jetpack and the moth man one. Jetpack don’t work like other items in this game because its not only a paint, you have to make a whole new jetpack
---
I wish I saw what you were talking about. It was dead as a doornail for most of the weekend and I was on for almost all of it. Barely anyone camp hopping for vendors, saw a big decrease in the number of scorchbeast queen launches aside from my own, and I spent a good deal of time just running around my camp waiting for something to happen. 
---
I wish they would try and hotfix more and try to get the hype going. It feels like if we have another few patches with more fucking bugs then player numbers will be even more lackluster, then I imagine we are going to hit a new low that makes it difficult to justify all the work they are putting into it.
---
What you can do is enter vats, exit and enter again. Then it'll hit on the first shot.
---
This is pretty much what I've experienced. When I'm berserker I will always be team leader so I can kick anyone using DR perks as it ruins my build. Others such a bloody build may prefer to be leader so they can kick anyone using rad absorption perks. It's not necessarily an attack against you, it is just how the leader wants to play. Much easier to kick than to send a message or search for a mic to say change your shared perk, also can't always guarantee the other player speaks English.
---
eww, gross
---
How?  You can build in other camps when in teams.
---
The extra AP also helps with the jetpack.
---
Couldve both been his accounts and just gaming the xp?
---
Party boy affects it too.
---
That's awful too
---
I feel bad for not noticing the latter, but I'll definitely check that out after work! Much appreciated!
---
Yes, that's actually it
---
So disappointing
---
Witch hunts are against Reddit TOS, you should probably remove this post even though you have good intentions.
---
wait wait wait...you can learn metal/combat helmets from scrapping them???!
---
Near it yes
---
Considering the level 8 was hiding behind me after I showed up and then joined my public team in place of the other guy, I really doubt that
---
Ok thanks kindly, I’m not sure why people are downvoting, I was only asking a question I didn’t now the history on. But oh well 🤷‍♂️lol
---
I discovered it a month ago with 8 months played. It's a great feature since it grants (if not glitched) the shot and deals great damage
---
I feel your pain. It's bad when it's quicker and easier to use the Pip Boy to equip a weapon than the weapon wheel, especially when it freezes altogether and you've got to exit the game and open it back up. Sometimes, for variety I guess, you use the quick wheel only to find only empty slots, which is amazing when it happens when you are close to death from attacks.
---
I preferred the FO4 build menu organization. I also believe there should be subcategories.
---
And if you would of levelled normally, you could of bought TWO levels towards the end!!
---
Interesting. Did not know this. I like collecting the notes and Holotapes. I might need to reconsider my collecting habit then.
---
The only comps that ever gave me a quest is space girl and The former blood eagle. I have had the Raider punk and the Forager and neither worked.
---
Hell, I'm surprised you actually got a 3\* drop. My luck it'd be a 1\* Nocturnal Pipe or something.
---
I've been turning in tons for ages, the first 2 times I dropped some off I got two paints, everything after that has been a stim pack and some ammo (or something similar).
---
I once read that you have better odds for turning in 2 than you do for 1...but that there's no increase in the odds if you turn in more than 2. Is that correct?
---
\* facepalm \*
---
Proerer Pro Tip: Don't. Save your free atoms for atomshop, and just do your dailies. Or if you absolutely must buy ranks, do so on the final day of season when you can't get more score and the cost per rank up is highest = 150 atoms will give you the most score.
---
Oh for sure. And I’ve certainly pissed off people on this forum who’d downvote me if I suggested they be given a fortune.
---
Because.
---
I had him for weeks with no quest, but then I found Daguerre and scrapped his worthless hide. I was starting to think he just didn't give quests until I saw the notification of a failed one. It was news to me!
---
Yep, sounds doubtful.
---
As always a really accurate work, thanks for your time!
---
No prob! Bear in mind I am just barely over 100 so I suppose I tank semi often for the group. What's your system?
---
They certainly need to stop using the slider for values.
---
It would be nice to have a hub in fo76 this is a really nice idea.
---
Update:: starting day 5 wish me luck!
---
I’ve got pretty low standards, usually if they say please and thank you, and just be generally polite that’s deserving enough for me to help em out
---
Yeah no kidding
---
I do not trade with strangers, period, for this reason. I see people trying to all the time, but it's not happening with me until it's safe to do so. I feel bad for new players who probably think I'm rude as hell, but I'm just not risking it, even if I don't have god roll weapons or gear.
---
I think you’re on to something here, mate.
---
well it is Bethessda the publisher that sold skyrom for 10 years as flagshop... sorry ship 
---
failout 76 is bethesdas shop where you just pay them money. Buying an ip dosent mean you can use it just mean they will exploit it so the most ussles people in society can be keept from there proper job  as bicycle repairmen.
---
With the new teams it's easier as the game just puts you back into the team unless you leave.
---
Good on you!  hopefully it wasn’t just a mule account that he wasted time lvling lol
---
She had a contract put out on her.
---
So you have no reason why it would ruin the game?
---
You’re only really interested in that you find important or effects you directly.
---
That happened to me around Fasnacht, so I thought it was still the case. Thanks for the update!
---
Designing your build to be extremely resistant to PvP damage can be done in this game. Without glitches. 
---
Maybe do something else besides PvP, until you are familiar with the particular nuances in this game’s version.
---
The biggest issue with this game would be if a duping get into the exchange the market is literally fked
---
I run AR on any mutant build, even without class freak the hp penalty is nominal especially if you focus on stealth and not getting hit in the first place. There are a few other mutations with nominal penalties that synergize well together that don't necessarily need class freak either.
---
Also, if you start a public team (even on private server) strange in numbers works on yourself even if you are alone. Lone wanderer does not work on a public team though, you need to be solo to use this perk therefore making SIN moot.
---
can you even see them or is it just like "oh no they didn't live what a shame"
---
your first mistake was thinking this was a pvp game.  your second was jumping in the ring with someone who was far more prepared.
---
Funny, whenever people lose, the other person is a cheater/hacker...what are the chances? :-)
---
Oh I do. You just will refuse to listen sand just disagree. Because you want to be able to sell cosmetic items like red asylum dress for mega caps! 
---
I know your kind. You’re kind ruin player markets and that has an impact on the game.
---
Welcome to the nuclear world.  Depending on what system you play on you will run into a decent amount of cheaters. Some players are just really good with perk card load outs. 
---
Two ways of getting good gear is lock picking and hacking terminals. I go with hacking because you can get unique amazing weapons such as a missle launcher and auto grenade launcher. 
---
Also learn landing points. There are specific landing spots that have guaranteed epic crate spawns. Best of luck mate and happy hunting!
---
Yep, same here, and I'm done with it.    Had one guy yesterday sit and wait for me to get off vending.   Never bought anything.   When I ignored him, he then stripped down to his tighty-whiteys and just stood there.    "Okay, you're weird AF and I'm seriously thinking about killing you, screw the wanted tag."
---
Because they play in a team and quickly exchange what they find
---
I wish it would crit automatically, then again I never crit anyway and use VATS like an aimbot
---
Well....of course. It's a product that you've payed / are paying for. Of course I'm interested in the things that effect that. Why do you say this like it's a counter argument ? You're only saying what you're saying because of your 'bias' that you *don't* care about these things.
---
This is true! I just don't use the shop for anything, so my atoms have nowhere to go.
---
Best of both worlds change to event just prior to one ending and back again afterwards.
---
Previously it was transparent to anyone but now it tells you your team goal on the UI so some people may get ratty if they don't like it.
---
I actually met one of my best friends in this game
---
I just want bows to get buffed period. There are literally no good bow builds that are not bloodied
---
Of course!
---
From my massive experience as a bush wookie in NW:
---
\- There are perks that increase the damage that you do like 'master rifleman' etc. So usually people will equip a couple of those perks and try to find those guns
---
\- Alot of times, people are in groups. So it is common for them to scavenge an area looking for loot then trade guns. For example, one person in a previous group that I was in was speced for shotgun. So he asked other members of the group to see if they had one (and they did). 
---
\- Keep in mind that because of the weight limit, people don't usually pick up everything in chests. So when you run across a chest, it is possible that someone else was there before you and took the good stuff.
---
Meh. I run carnivore cuz I melee sometimes
---
As long as finding ammo is still faster than this machine...
---
There’s lots if you don’t fast travel everywhere!.
---
I can find 3 or 4 just wandering around the huntersville area. 
---
Blood eagle and mothman camps seem to have a good legendary spawn rate,
---
poor animal
---
&gt;the best end game weapons and armor so the gauss mini gun, gauss shotgun, secret service armor, strangler heart power armor, and t65 power armor. That’s all I can think off the top of my head but you craft them and get a random 1-3 star legendary effect for each piece of armor or weapon, you’ll have to craft a bunch of them to get the exact legendaries you’ll want for your build. I’ve used ov
---
Also the gauss pistol, plasma caster, and the gauntlet weapon
---
[Great Video going over Technical Data and Forbidden Knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t9NyVyHA4M)
---
Not as far as I know. I've had the Raider Punk for the better part of three weeks because of it. I tried to wait several days, and put him back, but he doesn't work.
---
He kept saying "Hush. not right now." Or whatever and when I scrapped his chair, the Failed Quest came up. It's been like that ever since.
---
It’s sad to see the average IQ of people. When you say this game is garbage please elaborate what makes this game worse then most 60$ titles that have 2 to 4 hour campaigns or other games that cheat you out of your money.
---
There are far...far worse games out there and I will just assume your a troll and I’m feeding into you fantasy that everything should conform to your will. 
---
It’s a shame really. People who can’t think for them selves and Judge things appropriately litter this world. To much shit is going on that is based off he said; she said. 
---
Good day, ant.
---
Just fast travel from your re-spawn back to v9 or a tent.  This is what I do and (so far) I haven't had a stupid 15s travel timer stop me.
---
You see what you want to see. If the things you want fixed, until they are fixed, you will continue to see things as bad. Regardless of whatever QoL changes they make, until the ones you are most interested in are fixed, you will continue to see a lack of progress. 
---
And you defend your position by making comments like, Bethesda doesn't do anything unless it makes them money. But that's not true.
---
There's been lots of times Bethesda has made QoL changes to the game, that had nothing to do with money. 
---
So your statement is biased and adds nothing to the conversation.
---
If you are looking for a particular 3 star weapon, its about a 1 in 100,000 chance from what I can tell
---
AR scales with the amount of health you have. You can use this mutation with a full health build so as you die, you will do progressively more damage. It gives non bloody builds a little more flexibility and options than a full 24/7 bloody build.
---
It's very sad, I've had her since just after wastelanders released. We've moved all over the map, just built a new camp at the corner across from the overseer's camp and the wayward. After all this time today she is no more.
---
Unless selling for caps, trades I always just drop the stuff, after 60+ never had anyone not honour their side of the deal this way.
---
That’s already happening. People are selling bloodied weapons and cosmetics for more caps than the game allows and most non-FO1st can’t afford the amount of junk and flux being asked in place of caps.
---
“Our kind” want to fix that problem by making caps, which is currently a useless currency, actually worth something.
---
Naw man deserves all those
---
I do the same, build a base, add stuff, go over budget, shrink the base, add stuff, go over budget, shrink the base, add stuff, go over budget, shrink the base...
---
So that's what flamingos are for...hmmph..you learn something new everyday.
---
&gt;I think it's only like 2% per 1INT?
---
Testing I done gave results between 2-3%, some of the returns strongly suggested it wasn't 2% due to rounding.  Personally, with my personal experience, I think it's 2.5%
---
You can get Toxic Goo at West Tec. Some players who have bloodied builds, will drink it for the 125 rads. It's also the poor mans way to try and get a random mutation.
---
Just caught him sleeping on the cooking station the other day. Luckily, I had enough space to take one more picture. He literally didn't move before I spoke to him, so I was able to get the perfect shot.
---
Also use the terminal when you go in it will spawn 6 -10 extra ghouls , then on your way out do the 2nd option in the terminal for a load more spawns
---
If he dies..he dies
---
Have you seen people farming treasury notes? It's not a far stretch.
---
so people who lived in other reigons of the US aren't allowed to be inspired by a prominant group in their nation's founding?
---
Do you mean toxic goo? You collect that from westek.
---
ya, this is probably right, but the true idiocy of this situation is to permanently avoid acknowledging it as a problem, now that we know this will never be the case.
---
This right here. There should be a separate warning on this one and an extra verification that you really want to do it before it starts, because it's entirely too easy to stumble into and fail because you thought it was just like any other mission.
---
You think bugs have changed? Oh my sweet summer child.
---
lol, it can go one of two ways, and you're either annoyed that someone's wood box camp kept yours from spawning, or the one there puts yours to shame and you might as well just give up.
---
The toxic mutagenic waste is just a misc item with no use, I only want to get one to try and display it.
---
maybe they could fix the bug that prevents the trade shortcut from appearing also, and also the bug that shows blank inventory.
---
“Today years old” made me chuckle.
---
Then i guess don’t turn it in.
---
F
---
Nope this is a quest item without the quest flag that I saw being sold.
---
"This new building prefab costs 13 EFF YOUs of CAMP budget."
---
I demand FUs be an official measurement.
---
Hey, it just works.
---
I've wondered this myself. Why make the gauss weapons a special reward for being allied, but making us work so much harder for that particular ammo more than any other?
---
A robot walking mongrels, a confused robotic dialectic, dude who hates possums and more!
---
you need a friend to act as a server ancor for this to work in public - it works but i wouldnt do it for anythying of value.
---
That wont work, the quest flag stays on the item.
---
&gt; It gives a you a temporary +2 boost to Perception as well, and the recipe can drop as well.
---
\+6 With Party Boy/ Girl, lasting 1 hour. And it's removes the debuff for being addicted to alcohol - It's great for Junkies
---
Lame
---
&gt; what do you think of people going around looking for pvp?
---
I don't think about them, I have pacifist active. If they try to force it, I either wipe them or block/ignore them.
---
I can’t say for certain, but from what I understand Bethesda can track what items are duped they just have chosen to keep from having them removed from the game as it would cause too many problems with players who accidentally bought duped items. I’d be curious if they could add a system preventing duped items from being able to be placed in the open market.
---
That would be awesome, too!
---
So you’ve seen this in a display case, if so what did it look like? Also you can reject quests in the DATA tab. So maybe after collecting, before turning it in, quit the quest?
---
I've been avoiding Guided Meditation lately due to Adrenaline not working, unless there are people already doing it. Most of the time though, nobody is there, and my character can't really solo it without some degree of frustration.
---
Fair enough. Honestly forgot pacifist was a thing.
---
Actually, forget the blackjack!
---
Now to vendor hop and find someone selling it haha
---
I'm the opposite. I like the roofs but HATE the trees and scrub brush. I spend enough time trying to get large plants OUT of my CAMP. I sure as hell didn't want to have to BUY some to get the roofs. \*ugh\* Goddamn Bethesda.
---
I mean, it was clearly a joke, but...🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I do it so I can be team leader and can switch the group objectives to fit the situation most people dont do this or dont know you can
---
Watched a video yesterday, the guy said latest PTS they fixed the speed demon heal but not magic yet. That's probably on their list tho
---
I’m pretty sure the OP was. Or, is SS Armor not armor anymore? Perhaps, if we both read it again we can come to an understanding.
---
Oh I just watched a video on it, people would be looking at someone then poof they are naked and all they had on them was gone.
---
Leader of the Pack has been terrible lately. On my lowbie I fast travel to the event and it says kill the 1st and 3rd. Is the 2nd already dead? No one else is at the event. I fast travel to the 1st leader - event fails. Or event fails after killing the 2nd. Or disappears entirely when I zone in.
---
Of the four times I’ve tried it on my level appropriate toon I’ve killed the 1st leader twice and it’s failed every other time.
---
There's going around looking for PVP, and then when it's declined, there's being an asshole harassing people that would prefer to be left alone. Take the hint.
---
I usually stare blankly at those people with pacifist mode, and then proceed to go about my business as though they aren't there.
---
I always go for wanted players to help them get rid of being wanted.
---
If they add item for item trades then people just complain that they got a bad deal and whine to Beth to fix it. We can never win
---
What is your platform?
---
I give it about a 80-20 split outside of newbie seasons, so yeah.
---
Player probably doing something and got kicked from the server, but the sever hasn’t removed the player’s image from the game.
---
I commonly see this at big events such Queen fights.
---
I have decent gear and weapons,  I've played since beta. It's not such a crazy concept I would be able to do damage and Idk what your problem is I'm praising bethesda.
---
Hopewell Cave, the power Substation north of Watoga, and Deathclaw Island are where I found mine.
---
They can somewhat but unless they stop them right away they can flood the market really fast.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a99nq3Ifs3Y3tb8NeXiP185LA1ca975-wvrw_-Wd_n4/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
Not mine but here you go.
---
Yeah, if we target a player or group of players, and they don't show that they'll fight we move on pretty quickly.
---
My money is on the people posting how it shouldn’t be a daily challenge because they can go forever without seeing a deathclaw.
---
Best drop I've ever gotten from it was 500 caps.  Only once though.  Most times it's like 150ish.
---
See this is the kind of situation the devs need to iron out. I've been in similar situations and it feels like it shouldn't stalemate like this just because one dude is hiding. I'm fine with losing a workshop contest but I think it's ridiculous to be able to kill someone when taking their workshop and yet they still own it? Doesn't make any sense to me, if I killed them when contesting their workshop it should be mine now.
---
I love the foliage, actually. It's a good way to fill in ground space and make your build look more natural and blended. The scrub brush takes a shocking amount of budget though
---
Where'd you find them?
---
Let’s hope the colossal problem isn’t players losing gear, again.
---
Imo, its all raiding.
---
Raiders arnt going to follow other peoples rules (hell, they hardly follow their own), so using exploits etc could be considered raiding.
---
Im not saying its right, or should be allowed, i hate seeing people dupe wepons, or when my friends decide to just go pvp outside of NW, but id still consider it raider activity.
---
The difference i feel it weather or not your character is ment to be a raider (i know not everyone is this deep into the rp side of rpg), it dosnt make sense to be helping sellers one seccond then be off raiding other players the next
---
I forgot about Thunder Mountain Substation TM-02
---
thanks.
---
Sorry I mean if they can see what items are duped in a players current inventory then they should be able to have some kind of item check for a global exchange if it covers every server. I’m not a developer, but it seems like if it’s a system that works outside a specific instanced server Bethesda should be able to stop it automatically without developer interference. And if something does flood the system, I’d imagine they could easily stop it at its source with a few hours rather than weeks like it has been for past fixes.
---
There's lots of random encounters that have little to do with the actual gameplay and can easily be missed if addicted to Fast Travel. 
---
Others include - Pied Piper Bot, Girl standing over the grave of her pet Molerat, Super Mutants discussing Floaters, two Mister Handys (or Miss Nannies?) chatting, Woman with her faulty Protectron companion...
---
I’m on PS4. Play mostly alone Sam Fisher style, slow and sneaky, drop most my enemies before they know I’m there.
---
Solution for us all. In store items get their own tab when we open camp build screen to annoy us. Make every other category normal so our life can go on
---
If people would honestly read the card that explains the events, that would make life easier as well.
---
You know it's gotta be an arcade placeable shooting gallery, a bunch of little baddie plushie pop ups that you can unlock? I would design a miniquest around it.
---
Yes, i really have been looking forward to meat week
---
Some people don't. I'm past concerned about it because I can repair my stuff hundreds of times over.
---
They should have kept the survival/PVP mode tbh.
---
I won my first solo NW match last night so I believe I am now a bit of an expert. For the first 7-12 minutes just use aqua boy and hide in the pond. If the final circles end up there just stay under water and you should finish top 2-5. If the circle ends up elsewhere just randomly run around like a chicken with your head cut off and sometimes you too can win. 
---
Don't bother picking up any armor or weapons as it is more entertaining watching your killer realize they just killed an unarmed civilian that only wanted to play hide and seek.
---
Yep
---
I play full chinese stealth suit 99% of time. Egroegy if you ever want someone to slink around the wasteland with
---
This is why you stay on the computer until it hits atleast 30
---
Holy smokes Uranium Fever is getting bad. Last night I signaled where the legendary was (come to me) and a 154 just unloaded into it well before anyone else could get there. Not even one shotting - just mowing it down. Next legendary, exact same thing happens. I’m throwing “thumbs down” and “angry face” and he didn’t care. 
---
A few hits from his automatic weapon would have tagged it for him but he just had to stand there and unload on it. Every time.
---
I like this answer. I have no issue with duping for pvp (though people argue about the damage to the ingame economy, but since trades get taxed I couldn't really care). 
---
People using cheats to win is just lame, we prefer the direct approach. I guess us teaming up on people might be perceived as unfair, but since we're both melee we find it just fine.
---
From everything I have seen grahm is the only person to sell them sadly, just thought Id ask on here as I saw much older post of people selling them, was worth a shot lol, hopefully meat week is not delayed
---
I tried that earlier, and no matter how much damage I did to the damn deathclaw on the island, his health kept rubber-banding back up to 100%  
---
I said screw it, finished the other challenges and called it a day
---
IDK if this has been said but being on a large team helps. Everyone doing there own thing and when they find a legendary, you can fast travel on them and share. This has worked for me and the challenge hasn’t really been an issue for me.
---
That’s true also, but you still could be kicked from a team. Still risky
---
This was fixed a very long time ago, there is no risk of it happening. 
---
Everyone who lost stuff received it all back, as well as a care package of stuff from Bethseda compensating them further for the inconvenience.
---
I only stock my CAMP punch bowl with Nukashine. Have a drink on me, guys. heheheh
---
&gt; did have connection issues so maybe thats a reason? 
---
I've got auto complete bug today. Just for information (hope it will help). For me it was connection issues aswell. During server daily resetting (first 15 minutes) my network connection became laggy. I finished all displayed dailies, rebooted my router, logged in to the game without visiting atom shop or selecting NW. There were much more dailies that was autocomplited.
---
My biggest complaint is that no one gets in the matches at the same time. I play in the same room as my bf sometimes and will be in a match almost a whole minute before him sometimes. I can hear my teammates talking about what they got way before I even load into the match. Sometimes I load in already visible. Seems like it would be easy to fix by just making people have to stand there for 30-45 seconds after loading in but before the match starts.
---
Snip snip
---
Ya, I had have problems with the island before but there are many other places you can farm deathclaw
---
&gt; Who comes up with these values? 😕 
---
Well Bethesda obviously aren't using the FU scale... :D
---
Because it's annoying if you join a group for the bonus and for whatever reason, you get booted and lose all of your bonuses &amp; then have to start over. Doesn't take very long but still annoying when the name of the game is time consuming grind at every turn.
---
I'll join another group for challenges but almost invariably start my own to avoid that.
---
And that's just one of several reasons why someone may choose to start their own.
---
There is one on the cliff behind west tek also, where rose sends you to find David's key
---
Good question, are you at the top of the Rocks?
---
Hey man what's your psn? I'm dying of thirst.
---
Hopefully only players who have actually fought the Colossus will even attempt the event. And going afk in an even reasonably difficult event is a ahole move imo. But there are always those people. Hopefully they add a mechanic where everyone has to say their ready or something but knowing this game op is right there will be a lot of failed events.
---
Isn't the blank inventory bug just the "offers" tab that is opened upon trading? Try pressing Y on Xbox or the top key on Playstation.
---
I saw it in a vendor so I don't know for sure if it will display or not yet. You can inspect it though while the quest is active, it just looks like a bright yellow pile of radioactive sludge. I just tried to reject it but the option isn't there for this quest.
---
Yeah.
---
I think a lot of players who might just accidentally have a camp in that area will have a rude surprise coming lmao
---
I'm not even sure it'd be possible to hit Seneca Rocks and Monongah Mine within the same nuke radius. You should be fine.
---
People will start getting smart with the nukes though, and position them so that Monongah Mine is at the edge of the blast zone. Fast traveling to the event takes you directly to the interior, but it's like Lode Baring where you have to escape back to the exterior to complete the event properly.
---
Мертвые они и не отреспавнились корректно. Такое бывает, если недавно до тебя кто-то их уже убил в локе...
---
4 letters underneath the light category take up the same budget as 7-8 steel beams in the stairs category.
---
I dont care about duping affecting Bethesda, they buggered around the players enough to deserve it every now and then. My issue with players doing it is that the T&amp;Cs of the game say you agree to not use exploits and cheats, and by playing the game you agree to it
---
Hmmm I dunno then. Sorry.
---
It doesn't have to be perfect.  I just want a Bloodied Handmade.  I carry 3 rifles with me but I don't have a Bloodied handmade which is what I want.  My every day rifle is a Mutant's handmade with a 2 shot assault rifle back up and a Zealot hand made for SBQ.  I just want a bloodied with at least one or two useful stats on it.  All I ever seem to find are 1\*.
---
I just pulled up a map &amp; eye-balling it, you might be okay. The mine itself is further north, so a nuke centered on the mine would probably miss you.
---
Again? I wasn't aware it stopped.
---
This is the real question it’s such a good event + rewards idk why people insist on not actually doing what’s meant to be done
---
I was playing skyrim through a military base, Turn invisible, snipe, sneak... that real experience.
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking, looks fine but I'm thinking they'll game the nuke radius so just the edge hits it and they don't have to walk too far through radiation to enter the mine, or maybe so they can hit a nearby external area too with mobs to farm.
---
I guess the red rocket “pre fab” is optimised. 
---
So cheaper on the game client?
---
But yeah this is dumb.
---
Played for about 2-3 hours today and none on my end
---
Another... Wounded Super Mutant.

I wish they would have made events for raider or settler only peeps, such as you need “x amount of rep” to participate in said event. Could be fun, worth it? Prolly not, but could be fun to get 4-8 raider rep people and then attack the foundation
---
The best builds for budget management seem to be having three or four buildings with open faces for the entrance. Plus you can't have a good build until lvl150+ the red rocket garage helps, just like any premade structures, including the large tent
---
This is the most epic story with a sad end I heard (read) about Fallouting. My condolences.
---
As a merchant, I'd also like to see this. Currently I have to keep an eye on the number of other vendors on the map to get a rough idea of the player count and know when to switch servers. Not accurate or reliable.
---
I lose in PVP because I am trash at it. If I kill anyone it's just a happy little accident.
---
What’s interesting is that some npcs have unique hazmat suit skins. I’ve seen black and Camo ones as well. Even if the hazmat suit is nigh useless thanks to the stealth armor, it’s a nice touch.
---
Had someone buy some things from my vending and then asked in the chat if I could lower the price of an exploding weapon. After seeing he bought plans and supplies I gave it to him for 70% off. If they are interested enough and love the game I can tell, if you just want everything for free so you can stop playing take a hike!
---
I think when Bethesda add challenges that basically promote server hopping, as they're not tied to realistic appearances in the world, they're missing the point.
---
Having just introduced public groups and community, why would you try and undermine that by passively promoting people to server hop and destabilize it?!?!
---
Crater as well.
---
Flamingo for scale shall be my new barometer for everything
---
A purist water wookie! Much respect
---
Yup - you can :) 20% chance
---
Find something else to play.  Events will fail when you complete them, challenges and SCORE system fail daily, Trades menu breaks, fast travel breaks.  You’d be learning how to work around the problems , like a job, while trying to have fun.
---
I keep 200 stims just for pylons I run bloodied but will def take radaway to hold at least 2 pylons.
---
They automatically do increased damage to Scorched.
---
Ended up killing 7 or 8 of them in Radiation Rumble. Keep an eye out for that event.
---
Ive seen random flying people interacting with a non-existent computer. 
---
https://imgur.com/Vj6Slut
---
Wasn't the only either.
---
If they are limiting the players per instance they really should have added a minimum level requirement first. Not a recommended level, a minimum level 50 required before you can join the event. Have a feeling there are going to be a lot of failed events and this one eventually ends up like project paradise avoided like the plague.
---
What causes that to happen I did it with my friend and she was cool
---
If you're on a server of people who actually do the objective in Radiation Rumble it will spawn a whole tonne of them too.
---
Just to make sure I have this right, you can craft items, then scrap them to learn mods? Nice.
---
I maybe understood you wrong, but if you meant private server then 8 is the max amount. so if you do this on your server with friends then nobody's left behind. Kinda don't understand how it will work on public servers tho. We'll see I guess.
---
I’ll add you, never hurts knowing peeps in the wasteland.
---
If you have a bloodied melee anywhere in that 8, you’ll be fine.
---
Is flamingo's the official unit of measurement in Fallout?
---
Thank you. Out of every match I've ever played, this one would have been the best. My adrenaline was pumping. . .
---
But that fucking bat 😩😂
---
+ 15% Vats refill and fast reload
---
Iv only just started playing again xD
---
I could see that happening..I would like to see a gift box where you can give the camp owner something. Ammo,or a gun that you no longer use but dont want to sell
---
And they would likely have a legitimate point - like "kill a megasloth in cranberry bog" of yore - what's the point here really?  
---
Bethesda isn't promoting a location not often visited or bringing people together for an event or what have you. They picking an arbitrary 'rare' thing and essentially destabilizing their own server worlds by promoting massive migrations of people hopping to find unraided spawns.
---
Interesting thing about pink flamingo lawn ornaments, while most people think of them as American kitsch they once signaled that the family who put them on their lawn had wealth. 
---
In Baltimore working class people longed to get out of the city on hot summer days. Most everyone in Maryland would head to the Eastern Shore beaches because they were close by and not too expensive. But because DC, Southern New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia also headed to these beaches they also tended to be crowded. Still are.
---
However, if a family had enough money they would travel all the way down to Florida for their summer vacation. When in Florida they'd pick up some pink flamingos to put on their lawn to remind them of their happy days on the relatively uncrowded Florida beaches. 
---
So anyone who had pink flamingos was saying they could afford the better vacation and pink flamingos became a status symbol.
---
Suddenly measuring budget in terms of pink flamingos makes much more sense.
---
two days in a row. gotta figure out why it crashes on initial start up. then fingers crossed it doesn't randomly complete again.
---
Pay to win amirite...
---
?? Just curious...what does this have to do with having to rebuild your camp?
---
I don't even get to the last circle xD Well I'm only rank 5 and I started doing NW because of the challenges (I'm very scared of PvP to be honest). For what it's worth, you have my respect.
---
Chipper7773. Add me. I’ll be around tomorrow
---
There's a lead deposit right next to the mines on the map. I used to build there often. So did many other people. 
---
It's close enough that you have to actively avoid nuking it when going after the mine. Most people wouldn't think twice about it. 
---
I'm going to miss that camp
---
I'm usually just curious. I'm more afraid it's better, because I studied a bit of architecture and design, than expecting to judge. I enjoy what people do usually.
---
I love going in there, turn off your pip boy though... makes for a wicked light show
---
I think it’s a dance emote. I’ve seen players doing the robot, and tribal dances too.
---
explosive is just such a bad look against the queen these days, especially without Stabilized.
---
My 50cal is 331 damage on the card, with a around 5x the fire rate of a gatling gun. GMG is over 407 on the card with about 6x the fire rate. Just psychotats boost them to 381 and 468 respectively.
---
On queen, with a psychotats, they do;
---
50cal- 118 head shot 79 body shot
---
GMG- 129 head shot 86 body shot
---
And please, like, I'm not trying to tell you you're bad or anything. I'm just expanding on why I, personally, fell out with the Gatling Gun. It took the TSE nerf a lot harder than most weapons did, in my opinion.
---
LUL UR Funny  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) BUTT Also research the NW Perk Last Laugh Silly Goose...
---
Secret service you get it for grinding gold bullion that you get after you complete the wastelanders story line
---
You don’t want it
---
Right I didn’t even think about that and I’m a bit of a merchant also that would be useful I know there is a recent players list but I feel like that could be showing recent players from previous worlds also so it’s not the most helpful thing lol
---
I wave and see if they have a atom store wave. if so its usually an alt, or if I offer them radaway at level 5, but they rock 80% rads cause they are a bloody twink (Its what I collected gear for from the mole miner event)
---
Junkie weapons help
---
Not touching it until they fix it, until then I will keep on dropping unwanted ammo
---
Ooh, that’s very nice.
---
Sometimes it hurts to see others living your dreams
---
So what will that mean for our camps in a practical sense -- will we get double budget? Like the same budget outside, then a separate budget inside?
---
Idk 😂 i was reading other subjects and i get confused lol i m going to delete now 😂
---
No, I just go to another world
---
I really like those ideas, I mean I see the addition of more water having a lot more positives than negatives in my opinion, but hey I’m cool with it if people think otherwise
---
The SS armor with the jet pack is a new addition to the game. It requires gold bullion which is the current end game currency.
---
And it’s awesome, doesn’t use fusion cores... just uses AP. If your AP regenerates fast enough, you can pretty much float forever
---
After completing and having passed the luck skill check, she hasn’t mentioned headaches a single time. Definitely a lot of “floating in space forever, just... why” though.
---
Starting to have a change of heart on this as well. Was trying to wrap up a game session, visited a camp with a vendor. A level 2 starts following me around like a puppy. I keep chat off, so no clue what his deal really was. But my first reaction when I saw him was “oh, here comes the shakedown”. I dropped a half dozen stimpaks and logged out. That’s when I knew I was losing my Santa Claus vibe.
---
you mean some people out there have punch bowls and don't fill it with Nukashine?
---
It's a glitch, in fact that player is either loading, getting "server is not responding", disconnected or they already teleported somewhere else and this is just an image of them. I saw a lot of naked players flying in the air, sitting on invisible chair in the air, hacking a terminal, just standing amongst a bunch of supernatants, etc. Sometimes I get people standing in my camp doing nothing, but they're gone. If you open the map you'll see they're either in another spot or gone from the server.
---
You mean have an event like "feed the people", and maybe a counter raider event for people with a high enough raider rep to go and try and stop the event or steal from it?
---
Ah thanks, I never noticed how old the video was when I watched it.  But still I’d rather stick with the console version than deal with whatever attack is coming next for PC.
---
They are a toxic group. I’ve noticed that I get booted from a team randomly and it’s never from a high level, always when a lowbie gets team leader after a high level leaves..it’s an annoyance.
---
And they all love PVP but don’t realize that this isn’t a PvP game. I will come across lowbie camps and the majority of the time they are fighting someone else low level and destroying each other’s camps. Like why?
---
Only played a bit, and mostly this am, but no disconnects here. I'm in the US Northeast in case that helps.
---
The armor is called secret service. It’s the chest piece. You’re able to buy the plan in order to build the jet pack on it. It’s the only armor you can put a jet pack on. 
---
You need to beat the quest for wastelanders in order to unlock the gold currency. And that’s what you need in order to buy the plans for it.
---
Pretty solid. But. Drop 2 points from endurance and get a dense mod on your chest. Add one to strength keep bandolier and get 3 on blocker and the other stick in luck and u want serendipity 3 perks there. Adrenaline isn’t working atm but don’t lose the points in agility. Id lose scrapper and replace with weaponsmith for durability and the spare point in charisma strange in numbers and play in world groups.
---
Never played this event, but how is it different than the level 90 colossus that I’ve seen recently in the sundew grove?
---
Once you hit lvl 50+ all purveyor items are lvl 45/50
---
I know, it’s been a while since I’ve brushed up on the lore and story though. I should probably reset a character and run through the storyline again looking back on it
---
I'll give you that 15kcaps.im on xbox.
---
Your best bet if you want caps sell it in the vendor just gotta pay that Todd Howard 10%tax but if it was mine I would trade see what I could get for it.i traded some oddball guns that I thought were ok but was offered 30k plus other gear just for a executioners lever explosive with reload.jus try not to go over the 30k cap limit
---
Low level wanted players was a great way to bait PVP before the teams got reworked.
---
That's it exactly :)
---
Oh, so that's how you make vodka
---
Oh that sucks
---
once you're 50 and above you will get 45-50 3 stars.
---
Love these camps 👍
---
If you are on ps4, I've got a set of lvl 45(50 on a couple pieces I think) t51 that I will never use and would gladly give away.
---
Don't even know why I still have it, I plan on going from excavator to ultracite in the near future.
---
Oh ok that's good. Thanks
---
Oh ok gotchu
---
I keep having players that appear to be afk in my camp but in actuality are not there.  It’s odd.
---
Oh nice! Yea it was really cool. First time I went to a blast zone
---
Have you tested that? I’ve used the weapons before, and I’ve never noticed increased damage. And I don’t mean prime laser weapons, I mean the ultracite ones.
---
The sub station north of watoga I had census violence event come up. Went there. Spawned endless death laws for the event.  Lucky me lol
---
And another - Observant Radstag. Looks like an albino Radstag but travels alone. Do Not kill it, instead fille closely and it will lead you to a cache usually hidden inside a tree stump.
---
So you're on console, xbox maybe?
---
Pretty sure you cannot get those anymore.  There was a bug with that quest that let you collect more than they wanted and you kept the remaining bits.
---
 They were stuck in your inventory unless you removed them yourself and they also counted towards the next scout cleanup daily.  So if you had 3 bugged ones in your inventory you only had to collect 2 more to finish the quest and you still kept the 3 in your inventory when it completed.
---
 I am assuming that person put theirs on the vendor before that event was fixed. As far as I know you cannot get them anymore unless you had them prior to the fix.
---
Two in waste dump, one on deathclaw island, one West of Totw, one in watoga substation, one in hopewell cave. Set spawns, server hop to respawn.
---
Do you have to escape to get the event rewards? Or do you just lose your junk if you die inside the mine?
---
That is so cool! Maybe make it seasonl in October and make the entire map engulfed in darkness on the 31st
---
Isn't that the whole point of expensive show-off options?  Think designer handbags.  Red Rocket building is walmart grade common, while Mothman is a little more special.
---
The BOS paint job looks awesome.
---
Likewise. I’ll also drop extra camp plans so people can make their home a little more spiffy. Building camps and trying new things at workshops is one of my favorite parts of the game (especially after having completed most of the quests), so I try to get other people interested in it as well!
---
Its enough to make a grown man cry.
---
I don't engage in PvP mostly because I'm a casual and probably won't win. But there was one time when I turned off a pacifist mode to kill a lower lvl player because they had a bounty on them. I felt so bad afterwards, I tried to add them to give back used stimpacks (because I saw he used a lot of them trying to survive) but they were gone from the server and never accepted my friend request xD But in all seriousness, raiding is normal I guess (it's a post apocalyptic world after all), but picking up fights with people who can't right back is just.. not fair (unless they got bounty). but it's just my opinion.
---
Wrong sub. Try the trade subs.
---
Beautiful picture. The Mothman's glory shines upon you
---
Agreed but I'm confused as to how scamming works in this game or why people would do it.
---
This event is crazy.i get up on the canopy roof and the whole time just snipe one at a time.its a nice change of pace till someone shows up and the ghouls start to wild out
---
Atm i‘m on the road to lvl 50 my new vats crit medic build.
---
Just for fun and I want to try something else than bloodied/junkies
---
"hey we should help people, like the Minutemen guys who formed the revolutionary militia did."
---
makes sense to me.
---
optimized build and a good weapon
---
If it's anything like (the people that show up to) encryptid, we're screwed 😂
---
This is me right now.  Seems to match my play style OK, but I'm maybe rethinking the Strong Back for something else.
---

---
Only on PTS currently
---
me? nah. i have already what i need. still want to improve my GMGs but no hurry at all. but i see u r guilty that is y u call me this way. here we call players like u "shitttty pants".
---
When I'm there solo they always attack the bridge one untill it's halfway destroyed and then move onto the side one.. When there are multiple people it seems to be random.
---
 But they seem to always spawn near the side one either way
---
That's just broken. There's no way that gun does a total of 2200 damage to me in one or two hits.
---
Well when a workshop is involved it's all fair gain, but yeah harrassing a low level player isn't fun.
---
Nevermind the giant f\*cking floating text that alternated between "Activate the Pylons" and "The Imposter Sheepsquatch is vulnerable!" that appears every time it changes phases.
---
I just did this quest a few minutes ago (my fourth time, having learned what to do after the first attempt) and we lost because:
---
* No one took the pylons
---
* There were three \~100 level characters waiting for the timer to drop before initiating the quest before a \~80 level walked up and started it with 8.5 minutes left.
---
* In addition to no one taking the pylons, they kept shooting the assaultron while invisible?
---
* When I dedicated my stimpackless self to taking all three pylons and remaining dead so they stayed activated, everyone then seemed to just focus on the robot mobs? I did 1/4 of the damage to the thing myself in the last few minutes (stealthed Fixer) and it only had about 1/4 of its health damaged up to that point.
---
It was a group of about 8 people with levels varying from 80 to 250 and no one seemed to know what they were doing. Is it serious this hard for people to follow bullet list instructions?
---
EDIT: Sorry, I needed to vent that sudden onset of anger. I wasted about 400 .45 rounds for nothing.
---
Quad Auto Tesla, I can tag the entire mod before the god weapons can spin to start shooting, and before the grenades go off. And it's just a tesla so I don't steal any kills, just tag and get showered in XP :)
---
No worries, yeah I can definitely respect people wanting to avoid the PC version after all of the problems it has had. 
---
However, Bethesda seems to have curbed the biggest issues by this point. It is a much different game now than a year or even six months ago.
---
Yea I had a young fellow ask me politely if I could put a deathclaw gauntlet on hold for him until he was able to raise some funds, he didn’t ask for a discount and didn’t make any demands just asked if I were willing to hold it for him. I just took it out of my vendor and gave it to the person. Gotta make some sacrifices to appease the God of RNG.
---
Oh yeah, workshops are fine, you get the warning. I meant just in general :p
---
Cool, thanks for letting me know.
---
Kinda ran out of things to do. I only have a few more achievements to get before getting 100% completion.
---
Since the dimishing returns of DR are so high. Reducing damage is better for full health. Like hunters,  troubleshooters, zealot, exterm, etc...
---
How much armor do you have?
---
"coward"
---
its a game dude, i dont think he gives a shit
---
Yes it’s always bridge but I just take them out and if they do destroy I repair before they go anywhere. Every now and then they will go to a different one but barely ever destroy it. So easy to solo and I use to think it was impossible. But I didn’t know there where rare drops from there so I might actually solo it everytime now.
---
Oh, come on. There's no attempt to make it make sense. People wouldn't be skeletonized 25 years later, let alone the rubble structure and the like.
---
Playing Bloodied? Expect to be one shotted in PvP.
---
No lower than 490. I also have dodgy and serendipity on. It's a bit ridiculous.
---
Noooo!!! Downvoted!! This is not big chungus wholesome Keanu reeves 3000!!! You have to give all of your possessions to low levels or you will be crucified!!!
---
Also one violent night has a chance to spawn some. You have keep the juke box fixed, but not playing, and it will constantly spawn ghouls.
---
My Gatling gun does 650 per shot. I also have a sniper build that has a gun that does 1300 per shot. 
---
It’s all about optimizing.
---
I didn't pick up this game until about two months ago so I don't know the pain of those of you who bought it on release. That being said, I have really enjoyed it and I would definitely recommend giving it a chance.
---
I keep seeing people nuke monogath mine though....
---
Underrated? It was all I played a year ago. Best farm spot.
---
I dislike the word stack,  but yes. 
---
The damage reduction keywords are usually what people talk about. 2 hunters pieces isnt -30%, but rather you'll take .85*.85 damage every time which is -27.75%
---
If you just roam the higher levels of the map without fast travel your almost guaranteed to find legendaries. Different locations seem to have higher odds of spawning them..westteck whitesprings in the vacant rooms ,golfcourse and I had some good luck just roaming the area behind westeck as well
---
I feel like something similar would be great in 76. There's already so much mystical elements in the world setting
---
I’ve been sitting at the one achievement for doing raid with raiders but I don’t feel like grinding all the way through
---
what's the total number of flamingos you can have at camp?
---
I just zoom in on the event, works for me.
---
Even when i wasnt bloodied it was always one shotty with those guns. I also PvPd some bloody people and they dont die in one or two hits from 2200 damage and 80%+ anti-armor! I dont understand how hard it is to fix broken weapons.
---
So people that are not paying for fallout 1st or are good friends with someone that has a private server are getting screwed. Got it.
---
I still will not buy  fallout 1st until they stop adding atomshop junk and content we didn't ask for and start fixing bugs.
---
Are you new to the game?
---
There's one by Ripper Alley at Roselyn's memorial.
---
Level 175 lol
---
And yet yesterday I got that weird thing where I had two spawns in one of the locations, I guess someone went past it but didn’t do it and the spawn stayed there till the next time it came up.
---
Dang, I sure hope I find that guy selling them again then. It was maybe 2 weeks ago or so when I saw them. Thanks for the info.
---
Didn’t know about the temporary fix, that’s a good tidbit. I do wish they’d get it sorted out though.
---
Again, I do 2200 a hit and am not able to kill people in one or two hits. I even had a level 9 attack me once and I had to hit him 2 times.
---
Just got the barn building plans, seems to work fine with those.
---
I honestly forgot about the abandoned waste dump, I did one in hopewell cave and then two on death claw island
---
Halloween candy also works and is pretty easy to get.
---
Every world does.
---
NOICE! 
---
So the challenge could be you need lights to see the enemies better but the light also brings  the chance of the **MOTHMAN** finding you.
---
Halloween Candy. Stay stocked up on it and you’ll be fine for this challenge.
---
pro tip&gt; block door with deployed power armor. IT JUST WORKS!
---
I killed 2 on Deathclaw Island within the hour.  A new one respawned.
---
Or collect couple hundred halloween candy from  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Monster\_Mash](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Mash)  event, and never worry about challenges like these anymore. Whitesprings has a bar.
---
And you have to ask why things are broken? 😉
---
Yeah, took me a while to figure that out as well the first time I encountered that score requirement. At first I thought it was my weapon, maybe a non-automatic rifle just doesn't crit that often? I even bought a automatic rifle, but that didn't do it either. 
---
Then I just googled it and went ahhh, there's a crit bar! Right in front of me! And it needs manual activation! I can be so dense sometimes lol.
---
Very wholesome, I would have held onto that for him as well. Tho better to relieve the weight lol.
---
I thought other players could kill your tamed animals (without consequences), just like they can kill the Brahmin fertilizer animals? That's what's kept me from making the effort to get a pet 😕
---
Specifically, angry turtle on YouTube explains it...
---
It's in the Pink Tree forests I think
---
My tone was rather sarcastic when I typed it out lol. Like honestly all they have to do is nerf gun effects for PvP. Imo legendary weapon effects shouldnt work in PvP, only PvE.
---
Yeah remove the skin and move your camp. It took a couple of times for but it worked
---
What’s the fun/point of any other video game you’ve played?
---
I personally enjoy the genre, the storyline, the humor, the setting, and usually the interface.
---
There are alcoholic beverages everywhere in this game.
---
I do that all the time, comment on a post but be thinking about a previous post...  posting completely wrong information
---
It has happened for quite some time. This is as the dev intended
---
I’m pretty sure there is a damage cap you can do to players in adventure mode pvp.
---
Fast shooting guns are much better since they can hit the damage cap at 100~ RPM.
---
mÖth want lÄmp
---
If figured, hence the 😉
---
Can you wear an empty PA frame before level 15?
---
more specifically, for the tax/economic lever.
---
What gun is that? The sniper one
---
Everything's horrible and wants you dead? I just like the fact everything is now awful lol, the journey, as in most games, is becoming the top dog in this particular dog eat dog world. VATS makes the gun play accessible to traditional rpg players and the rpg system itself is pretty in depth, in Vegas more so than in 76 there are typically several solutions to every problem depending on how you've built your character (I don't think this had translated well into an mmo where the meta favours one/very few builds).
---
Also gross mutant's, they're fun too.
---
My suggestion is move both characters to the train station before doing the swap.  Sometimes when you fast travel the game crashes and then you are going to lose your stuff.
---
I have done this a few times thus far.
---
Careful in there, Wendigo Collosus sometimes spawns in the Sundew Grove after its been nuked
---
I assume you’re talking about pvp. Max damage on another player is 110 hp. If they’re using automatic guns and you’re swinging a melee weapon, they’re hitting you several times when you’re hitting them once or twice. If their weapon also has faster fire rate, it’s going to seem like you’re only being hit once or twice when in reality you’ve been hit several times.
---
Yeah the new ones seem much cheaper. I had a sliver of camp space and was able to place the ufo camp prefab no problem
---
i drop unwanted items in the game or never pick them up in the first place.. because I dont want them
---
i have one hanging from my mothman bed, i watch them to sleep.
---
Workshops ... all’s fair in love and war. Two consenting high levels that want to settle a beef, sure. But targeting low levels out of the vault and trying to bait pacifist into battle? Call it raiding if you will. I call it bullying, and that’s where I draw the line.
---
Black power rifle. It could go higher if I use drugs or what not. 
---
My lever though can go to 600. 
---
Fixer is around 450
---
Maybe just have  daily limit o. Trades
---
Idk man I see these sometimes, they are uncommon but I've seen them for sale by vendor trons. There are 2 different versions that I know of: Candem Park uniform with blue apron and amusement park uniform with red apron. The Camden park one is unique in that you can only obtain 1 in a playthrough from the Mistaken Identity quest that will unlock the Candem Park dailies.
---
(unconfirmed) However, there may be 2 versions of Amusement Park uniform that share the same name and inspect picture where one is a dirty version and the other may be clean like OP has showed.
---
Oh dang haha. That would have been a nice surprise. I’m only level 67 right now
---
The last 2 times I've done it, I was solo and only 5 or so ferals showed up for the entire event!  I sat perched waiting for things to attack and nothing.  Crickets.  I thought it was bugged.
---
Sorry bub, but youre gonna have to look elsewhere, as far as  i know the only Fluxes you can get there is, Crimson, Violet and flurescant.
---
Here is a [recent thread with good information on flux locations](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hx90dx/does_anyone_know_good_places_to_farm_cobalt/).
---
wdym?
---
I usually dump my stuff in the cash registers since theres a chance to at least scroll across it when you are at the vendor bot
---
I think we’re all agreement that it needs a comple overall. It looks good just sitting there in C.AM.P but yea it needs a different a user friendly experience ASAP lol
---
In my experience they’re interested in completing the event, they just want to camp on top of the central ore bin and farm the mobs with their duped B2525
---
Auto grenade with grenadier perk. Yeah, it has travel time, but it has a vastly longer range than the Tesla rifle, and will hit literally everything in a 20 foot radius whereas the Tesla will only hit, at best, 3 things per shot. And the travel time isn’t an issue if the ranges are short- I can screw over everyone at Line in the Sand if someone is doing the FO1st tent glitch by oneshotting the entire pack with a bloodied grenade launcher (I’m an bloodied HW/Explosives build, my grenades list at 900+ damage in my pip boy) before anyone else gets more than a shot off. 
---
I don’t because I’m not a dick, I remove all my damage perks for group events, but yeah...
---
Plus it gives you a way to use up all those 40mm grenades!
---
for real, I try not to give people gear that basically trivializes the game, that happens on its own soon enough - I would rather make their game more fun or interesting
---
There's also one a little ways south of the lead deposit between White Powder Winter Sports and Top Of The World. He used to come visit when I had my camp there.
---
US supply requisitions make people wanted?
---
In adventure mode PvP damage is capped. So... your 2200 damage is about 2090 more than you can deal to another player.
---
Meanwhile, their high fire rate weapons hit you for the capped amount about 15 times per second.
---
holy shit
---
Not everyone can easily reach Watoga, though, if they’re a new player.
---
im just glad they take up very little space. think i have like 30 of them up in my camp
---
Isnt it great how you can fight COVID-19 and the Scorched Plague from home!
---
Something similar happened recently when they brought player vendors back. You could steal displayed items from the vending machines. So I wouldn't say 'no risk' just not the exact same situation
---
News to me, but I’m gonna check it out now. I loved that gun in FO4!
---
Waste of perk points for any build. Any stimpak cures crippled limbs instantly and you get crippled very very rarely. Also, it cures itself if you are not in a hurry and can wait like 10 seconds or so out of combat.
---
I don't use it.  Here is my stealth/bloody build.

---
What?
---
The one in the PTS (Public Test Server) has gotten a buff, and it seems it will follow into public release. Also, The event takes plave in a enclosed mine, making it harder to take cover. 
---
Pretty sure they also increased the Wendigo spawn amount.
---
Only time I use adamantium skeleton is with explosive shotguns. Easy to cripple myself with those.
---
Ok that makes a lot more sense.
---
I actually did this a couple times recently as I still don’t have the Xbox achievement for killing 20 players. Plus there’s no other way for the player to clear their wanted tag anyway.
---
But I noticed these low level players were so tanky to kill. It took a lot of bullets, like they were almost immune...
---
I wish I had an answer for this, I’ve been seeing this happen a lot the last few days, it happens to enemies I would have otherwise killed in one hit but instead their health goes from 1% to full, even on low level enemies
---
 Oh shit my confusion
---
True but folks vendor the candy usually for 1c each.  So if they see it they can easily pick it up.
---
I did not realize you were writing this for new players.
---
There’s multiple factors; basically there’s several different bugs that all have the result of stopping fast travel.
---
One seems to be lag related- this one I can reliably avoid if I wait to travel- basically I click on my destination, count 4, click on okay to cap cost, count 4, click travel. This one is hallmarked by literally nothing happening when you hit travel, just map closing.
---
One seems to be enemy related- nearby enemies canceling FT even if they aren’t aware of you or even damaging you. The VT university seems to a regular cause of this one- this one is hallmarked by getting the FT countdown timer from active enemies, but then it immediately vanishing. The only workaround for this seems to be getting far enough away from that area- I’m not sure if killing everything nearby actually works or not. 
---
These are the two that I’ve noticed.
---
Not much in the bog, best bet is to drop a nuke on Morgantown for a really good amount of cobalt.
---
Oh even the console version has changed a lot.  I know last year I was quite frustrated with the game and had to take a break because of bad internet service and what not.  Then when I started playing again in april it was a way different game I was returning too and I was quite happy.  I do hope it continues to get better and they get things under control.
---
Scrap old blueprints and stored items. The latter adds to your total CAMP budget.
---
You know what man, this is wholesome and I’ve done similar things. I’ve pulled up on lower level wanted players just about to kill them and that little voice in the back of my head says “oh come on don’t be a dick.” So my jerk side gets completely squashed and I tell them what’s up and ask them if they want the bounty taken away, if they say yes, I compensate them with a couple hundred caps, aid items and chems, food and water, ammo and if a workbench is nearby I’ll make the best armor for them at their level and a weapon of their choosing. Sometimes being nice pays off more in the long run. Heck I made a good friend through these exact means and we’ve been playing now for 5 months and I wouldn’t trade that encounter for anything.
---
Not a relationship, but I've gotten my friend who I've gotten pretty close with that lives no where near me into fallout and we've been playing alot of it in the last month. I've already done virtually everything in the game and have just about everything I could want, but I still love the game, and I've been helping them through it and playing the game with them, building camps with/for them. 
---
I absolutely love this game and I'm glad I was able to get them into it and have them enjoy it so much.
---
I put out the wanderer Ally and she didn't give me any missions for 3 days and finally I couldn't stand listening to her humming and playing the same guitar riff over and over so I scrapped her. 😤😤
---
Radiation Rumble spawns a whole bunch of deathclaws when people collect the ore.
---
No problem, thanks for asking politely lol. If its just not your cup of tea I don't think anything in particular would change that for you, there are lots of games out there I can accept are good but aren't for me. Anyway unless you do like FO for the setting and gameplay I can't see putting up with the bugs being worth it
---
I’m not so sure about the top of the world for this choice, especially since the area is instanced thanks to the vaccination portion of wastelanders. I think Sutton or the Whitespring would work better.
---
I had pretty good luck with checking around train stations early on. Particularly whitesprings and that's where I drop pretty much everything I don't want anymore.
---
Uhhh.... I don’t even use the launcher, I just launch the Exe and log in every time.
---
But I have two accounts, so that’s a deliberate choice so I can choose which account on the fly (generally Both at the same time; mule/vendor account first).
---
Thanks for warning tho i feel less ashamed 😅
---
If they follow you to another server... that's greifing.
---
no problem, my psn is jimnvalerie. what kind of build are you running?
---
im on EST, we usually are online in the evening
---
I havent started my dailies yet today, but last night I was about 4000 xp away from having the firefly lights. So I'm about 5 squares ahead of him.
---
&gt;vendor price dialog which should have a spinbox for each digit
---
That sounds absolutely horrible.
---
And I’ve fought a Wendigo Colossus about a month ago.
---
Na man sounds like griefing  to me " just destroy camps cuz no one could stop us" that's a dick move.  And yes sure I get workshops are ment for pvp but if your 100 levs higher than them why bother taking his workshop, just so you can feel like a big shot.
---
From the sound of it your not very good at pvp ( or you would play NW) so you go around only picking fights you know you can win. Come by my camp and see what a real fights like.
---
I mean Enclave... Nazis.... If the radioactive boot fits lol
---
Thanks. The two feet though add up to 80 percent reduction since its 40 each not 50. I actually though mostly have bird bones for the extra agility. Thanks for the tip though.
---
And just weird
---
I hate the level 63 Charred Ghouls, so that's the main reason I tend not to do it. I wish it was muties again.
---
My wife had a sloth she decided she didn't want anymore. In order for me to kill ot for her I had to leave out team and initiate PvP. I shot her, she shot back and only then was ai able to hurt her sloth.
---
It was for everyone, really - I just mentioned that the candy may not be easily obtainable for new players, and I had forgotten about it before you and others mentioned it. Also, I haven’t seen anyone selling the candy in vendors, but perhaps I’ve just been unlucky.
---
seen it m'self
---
I get a pretty consistent spawn at the buildings up the hill from Welch.
---
100% agree. I started dropping bags for low level players after I saw others on reddit doing the same. 
---
After an event yesterday, this level 25 walks up to me and keeps flashing me to gift emoji. Moments later I realized he was wanting me to give him free stuff. 
---
Really makes me want to stop giving anything for free.
---
So question... say I'm in a public group. Does that matter? Does it prioritize group members or is it literally just first 8 that get there?
---
There is also the cave, cant remember its name, right side of the map and its the same cave where you find the Enclave entrance. Its for the main story.
---
Okay cool! I'll take a look around! What should I be looking out for in the stations?
---
No it will get recalled to your inventory sadly
---
I'd pay Atoms for this.
---
2nd time recently I've gotten the bug and I didn't log on until well past the reset time. I wasn't on earlier either, last time I was on was almost 24hrs ago. 
---
Both times I changed characters, logged on a public world and was disconnected before even getting in. 
---
Currently searching for a post that is workshopping the bug.
---
With a full set of unyielding armor you shouldn’t need to run sneak or escape artist. I can usually sneak right past enemies with no problems. Also you can try concentrated fire at one star, I didn’t see a noticeable drop overall.
---
Eliminate fast travel and revamp the game have immersive ways to travel like a vertibird or utilize the tracks with a rail system vehicle.
---
No it goes to your inventory. Just like in game world if you fast travel. If you are talking about actually DROPPING it, then it will eventually get deleted like any other item you drop, unless someone picks it up.
---
No, there is no way to display them.
---
This is fantastic. I love the data tools available for this game. 
---
I wish someone would make an XP tool that lets you see every base XP gain in the game and has all the XP variables available to play with. I understand there's a ton of variables with that, but it'd be nice.
---
Suitcases mostly. Really any container that things can be put in though.
---
Even dropped? And not just getting out of it? I’m talking dropping it not just placing it
---
Decent for what? PvE? Ok.
---
Tse combat or pump action shotgun. Point and click and rack up those points. 
---
Just make sure you have fireproof and serendipity applied.
---
Abandoned Waste Dump :)
---
Edit: deleted cuz was being a dick for no reason
---
I bought a bottle of nuka cola scorched the other day. Had some pretty good effects!
---
I haven't run any tests but I've long held the theory items purchased from the atomic store use less CAMP budget space than vanilla in game elements.
---
This has happened to me with a set of X-01, an arm and a leg I think. It's on my alt so I didn't bother to report it.
---
I feel your pain buddy. I've lost countless pets to unknown causes. Counted 3 deathclaws, 5 mirelurk kings, sloths , and most importantly, arby the opossum 😥
---
Junkies Heavy gunner build with PA use it for pvp and trash on people 👍🏽
---
Ah. Thats it, for some reason I kept thinking it had the word "cave" in its name.
---
That would be fun.  You want some supplies?  Go farm 100 units of steel and we'll talk.
---
Yea but high lev players are super cool I garantee if you ask they drop you 20 easy
---
If you're a caveman I probably wouldn't try and decrypt it the normal way
---
I’m going off memory a little bit, so hopefully someone can correct me. 
---
So first you’ll need to wait until the the end of the week when keywords are revealed for the cypher (they should actually be all ready now until they reset tomorrow). 
---
Head to whitespring bunker to get keyword for the silo you want to use. They are on the board in the command room with the tickers on the wall. 
---
Make sure you use all 8 keycards for the silo. 
---
Write down your keyword, followed by the alphabet with letters removed. Also omit duplicate letters.  For example, if keyword is “Apple” write down APLEBCDFGHIJKMNOQRSTUVWXYZ
---
Write down the standard alphabet below it
---
Look in your pip boy at nuke code in order. 
---
Take letters from standard alphabet and assign to new alphabet. 
---
You should now have 8 letters. 
---
Descramble to find a new word. 
---
Convert back to code letter/numbers using your cypher. 
---
That is your code.
---
Edit: small error [this post explains better](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9ygyy9/stepbystep_guide_to_decrypting_launch_codes/?utm_source=xpromo&amp;utm_medium=amp&amp;utm_name=amp_comment_iterations&amp;utm_term=active_search&amp;utm_content=post_body)
---
I don't understand what is up with the rash of children playing this game recently.
---
-barging into a chat, if you have one going
---
-incessantly inviting you into a chat, even if you decline
---
-messing up sneak or stealth things you're involved in
---
-following you around trying to trade with you
---
-trying to trade with you while you're in conversation or at a vendor
---
-that weird kneel thing ...use the emotes, please???
---
-coming into your C.A.M.P. and opening every single thing they can and leaving it open
---
-clearing out your free items like the most obnoxious game of hungry, hungry hippo
---
-asking for more and more when you've dropped a care package or gave them some stuff
---
...this list goes on. I treat them like stray cats now. DO NOT FEED THE STRAYS.
---
Ss armor from wastlanders got a jetpack
---
If you drop it, it will stay on that server, not in your camp. You will lose it.
---
So I guess I shouldn't wait for her to open the door for the power armor 🤪
---
Ok, sorry i tried to help. Won't do so again.
---
Hey buddy, thanks for this! I’ve been trying to figure this out for 5 days!
---
Mid 70s.  Probably as far ahead as I'll get as he should be going faster than me at this point, but I will still beat him by a fair bit.
---
Experiment with taking down Class Freak.  I think you’ll get along just fine without it.  I’m sure you’ll find a better use for those points (Serendipity)
---
Look into Mister Sandman.  Combined with covert operative you can reach a multiplier of 3.75.  Day time only lasts about 17 minutes or so, then it’s back to serious damage.  I find it much more valuable than GunFu. 
---
Just a couple thoughts.  Overall, you have a good build!
---
I suppose so, but I wouldn’t want to hope on that. I’m in the 200s myself, but I just haven’t bothered collecting the candy for that challenge because I don’t mind exploring the world for it.
---
If you drop it, it's gonna stay on the server. Also not a really safe way to display PA as anyone can take it.
---
Perks are huge. For example, a rifleman has a perk to reduce your armor by 40%, a perk to increase their damage (I believe by 40%), and then there’s bloody mess for another 15%. If they’re hitting headshots and they have a sniper-type gun... it’s a 1shot. I’ve nailed a guy at long range on a big froglegs leap with a lucky snapshot that nailed a headshot on him. Dude probably thought I was hacking... 
---
I also took out a squad of 3 lowlevels (I’m only 25 myself, but I had that old bug that gave a ton of perk packs for adventure mode stuff, so I’ve got virtually every card) near the start with the crossbow, since it does a ton of damage. Last guy went down to a lucky snap headshot at point blank range (no ADS even). 3v1, we all had crap loot, but I had perks and a high damage weapon (and a little luck) 
---
But as others said, some of it comes from learning layouts and choosing perks. Locked containers and hackable terminals are STATIC, always present. And they always have some purple or better loot. I don’t run those perk cards anymore but if you want great loot, learn the spawn locations and run one (or both, if you want to invest that much of your Loadout into it...) perk. 
---
And yes, some 3rd tier chests are static, and some areas are just high-loot areas. I’ve learned a couple at this point; I’ve got a favorite I pretty much always drop at because i can spawn on top of the chest, and the area usually has good loot, and is often ignored as a drop point so I have lots of time to loot everything
---
My diet is mostly steak, I was able to get it done w/o realizing it exists with the industrial farm
---
You can put gunpowder in stash of you go under misc and do it from there
---
It's a bug, happens when a creature respawn after been kill with a energy weapon.
---
Great suggestion.  I wish they would listen.
---
Yes!!!! Thank you so much.  I love stuff like this, but I couldn't suss out what was going on.  Every search I tried gave me nukacrypt, which I have no problem with, I just wanted to know the by-hand solution.
---
Oh man, my keyboard would have needed some new parts
---
Well I’m currently looking at the 50 names listed on my recent players and none of them are greyed out so I don’t think that’s working if that’s what it’s suppose to do
---
But thank you for information been playing since beta and have never seen that
---
I mean, if you’re on PC, you can go nuts with a photo editor on the photos folder...
---
Friend, like I said that was back in the first month of the game existing. And I admit it wasn't cool, and we even thought we went to far after a few camps. We were hoping the bounties would draw more people out for pvp since a 15 cap bounty wouldn't really hurt us. People were too nice back then anyway. Pvp metas didn't exist.
---
Now its mostly people that are higher levels than us we get in fights against. Mainly as they're the only people that we find. Through that we found out that there's not really a difference between a level 100 or a 300, aside from the 300 being more likely to have their build worked out.  Back then there was practically nobody above 110, and they were really rare to be that high. Now it's pretty common. Even had a run in with a level 880. Picked a fight out of curiosity, got blown away by an explosive laser rifle. Was a good time.
---
Just place powered doors with switch’s and levers the ai is basic it does not know how to go through powered doors. They can only teleport past them to access workbenches
---
The bug was fixed months ago it was reintroduce in Patch 20 and it will be fixed again in Patch 21. It shouldn't be this way but accidently reintroducing things that have been fixed already isn't out of the norm for this game.
---
Maybe not a boost Perse but it is at least reduced AP cost of doing things...really adds up if you have it on all four limbs (with the chest piece having dense).
---
I play bloody unyielding so I don’t need deep pocketed as my strength is sky high, especially on my current character who has 15 points in strength to begin with.  I have over 300 carry weight and get over 400 with some grilled radstag or ribeye steak....which aren’t hard to get (radstag spawns semi often near my camp OR I just go back to flatwoods and kill the Brahmin):
---
VATS/Shotgun build.
---
Cripple the legs and then critical to the face
---
I definitely get random crits in VATS without hitting the button.
---
Happened to me for the 1st time today also. I was only presented with 4 objectives when I logged in, I assumed because double SCORE weekend was over Bethesda reduced the objectives and kept playing and finished the few objectives I had (pre war food, alcohol, deathclaws &amp; creatures) I server hopped once and when I got to the new server I saw the rest of the objectives autocompleted.
---
No connection issues, never even started NW since I got the game and logged on about 2 hours after the objectives reset for the day. Sucks but seems random.
---
Or bloodied cammando I know the one from pts is gonna be strong by I solo the one on live servers and hes usually down within 2 mags from my handmade
---
What platform are you on?
---
You only have the officer paint? You must of gotten it from a trade or vendor. You get them as drops from Forbidden Knowledge in a certain order. If you learn them out of order the lower rank will no longer drop from Forbidden Knowledge.
---
If doing the deathclaw kills, raid the picnic on death claw island next to the nest. Sometimes you can find both alcohol and pre war food with your deathclaw kill.
---
Did anyone else read that in the voice of Redeye from Raider Radio ... ?
---
Yeah you missed the start of the first season, which replaced the daily system.
---
Gonna be pretty hard for you to catch up without paying atoms at this point ngl
---
If you don't care about skins or camp stuff it's fine I guess.
---
I guess the two biggest things are the Legendary Run and Public Teams.
---
Sorry for being a dick it’s not the fo76 way 😢
---
Poor opossum. I had a beaver, Theodore (obviously) for a while before Shadynasty, cute little bastard that fell victim to a local gang of mutants. I always feel bad for the little pets. 
---
Shadynasty is a particularly nasty blow. I had her for months. It was always fun coming back to camp to see her walking around and digging in the garden. Just got her that nice skeleton hanging in a tree for her to snack on.
---
Can get in via the roof
---
I made a small edit for a step I missed. It’s fun to do it for real at least once!
---
It’s basically a hot toddy. I also like how each time you complete the quest he gives you MORE honey.
---
No need to ever really find any wild
---
What bug?  Based on the post you linked, The workshop was claimed by someone else and then left.  It‘s not supposed to just remove everything else. Those changes to the workshop should stay until enough time passes or the server refreshes.
---
Also, you don’t have this issue on private servers, so your comment on the subscription has nothing to do with it.
---
If you’re talking about the fast travel bug to camps, that’s a completely different issue.
---
is the pump better than combat?
---
Yes, we should definitely kill capital punishment in the wasteland.
---
In all seriousness, that’s a good tip.
---
I used to but, let's be honest, the spread from a TSE can't actually get any worse even with 2 broken arms.
---
My thought was this trading post would be part of a follow up quest line the player would be required to help actually build it, that way it’s not just “oh it’s here now wonder how that happened.” Theoretically Meg’s appearance could still happen or maybe it is a branching quest line that takes place after you’ve met both settlements and inoculated them. 
---
From there this could represent another step at bringing people back to the wasteland with maybe some new npc’s from both factions(since both sides have said they’re not actively trying to destroy the other - they just want to be left alone or have someone to take things from). 
---
White Springs would be good too. I think the reason I’d prefer TotW is its central and is a very visible landmark that has nothing really important going on. Rose is there, but she doesn’t actually fix anything she just wants to watch the world burn. And it’s a good sized space for activities without being huge so it’s easy to access whatever activities take place there.
---
You can equip Can Do and hit up the trash cans in WS lobby
---
Crippled Legs are the worst. Hard to run from a ghoul with that
---
Reread title; drop, not place.
---
But now if you wait, 5 people with gat plasmas come, wait for someone to do pylons and erase her in 1 second. Very selfish game now.
---
It's always sad when a pet leaves. My first deathclaw, Dave really caught me off guard. My first pet, he was an indoors pet, but then a pack of Yao guai came along and ended his career
---
Love this community lol
---
The setting and uniqueness of fallout is the reason I love the franchise, they way the game tells you stories and the fact that you have to survive in this harsh world and develop your character, also the sense of progression which was done better in earlier titles, also the only thing that makes fallout 76 a game worth playing is the community, everyone is friendly and helpful, I've never seen such community in an online game before
---
Lol. Unfortunately their isn’t a fo76 specific dictionary for my phones autocorrect.
---
Please dont downvote the op. I fixed the typo. For those interested, I originally said death law kill.
---
Yeah. Half pissed at the time, should have been explosive. Furious explosive and anti-armour  explosive.
---
Blame 'The Legendary Run'...strips you of all dignity and remaining braincells..!
---
That tea is made with bourbon, so it makes sense
---
The main concerns are the conversion limitations, which Bethesda has stated they will address in a future update. 
---
If the system would let us convert even 100 rounds at a time into/from Ammo Points, and had a larger reserve than 2000, the item would be much better received.
---
Good to see they tested the skin before releasing it...
---
Absolutely. I  have more honey than I could ever need thanks to Sweetwater and honeybeasts. Eventually it just becomes an easy "hand honey over" for the easiest xp ever.
---
The big thing is that Seasons have replaced the rewards daily challenges. Seasons are similar to battle passes, except they're completely free and give a bunch of rewards, mostly exclusive cosmetic stuff as well as atoms, scrap/repair kits and other items. To rank up, you need S.C.O.R.E., which you can get from completing daily challenges (which have also been changed to be considerably easier)
---
What you’re trying to do is stupid, find a YouTube video
---
A cool thing I like to do for this is use "insurance"
---
Basically one person sets an item for like max caps, then the other buys it, then the other person will set their item for sale for max caps.
---
Worst case scenario someone takes ur item and I got some caps. 
---
(Ideally this is for smaller trades)
---
Ahh sorry, yeah it will just get placed in a bag on the ground then i think and get destroyed if no one takes it
---
And he answered **BOTH** possibilities. Placing *and* dropping.
---
Yeah that'd be awesome
---
Could work just as well. Biggest concern in my mind is making caps, or an easily accessible secondary currency, worth something so that players don’t need to earn god tier loot every time they want to buy something valuable.
---
Great idea!
---
Lol very true. Had that happen a couple of times from being hit by them.
---
not the event colossus tho. just a random spawn at certain nuke zones.
---
Tend to wander less if you put them near the edge of your camp.
---
Also if you want the guitar lady to stop playing all of the time then face her guitar towards a wall or block the front of the chair with an object. She should spawn in her chair when you first log in, but will not be able to interact with her chair afterwards.
---
Yup. That worked. Thanks for the help all.
---
Just ran it thanks for the info
---
First time I came across them was yesterday.  Did they replace the SBQ?  Because I found two.  Wendigo spawn is high already.  Guessing it mirrors it.  The unique terrified emote is kinda cool
---
I feel like a dumbass now. So many wasted crits.. I hope this works with a keyboard too!
---
Ah yes, DEMOCRACY
---
Brutal!  
---
My toughest loss prior to Shadynasty was a sloth, my first pet. There was a camp just down the street from mine and for some reason he got into it with the camp's turrets. I heard them shooting and ran over just in time to watch him die.
---
Drop grim reapers spring and get serendipity, with unyielding armor you’ll get crits quickly anyway. Agree with others that blocker is better than weight perks, although I recommend radicool for bloodied as the rads will boost your strength.
---
Just trying to find a way to display power armors
---
lol this is why i havent done the event for a long time, when did the ghoul change happen?
---
Thank you!!
---
We just started week 5 out of 10 of season 1. You can play around with this tool to see if you can make it  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html)

EDIT: Used the calculator... If you do every single challenge from now on and farm 10k xp every single day, you will hit rank 100 on the last day of the season.
---
Change field of view maybe?. That might help?! Although it should be visible not matter the FOV
---
Whenever I'm in a event with more then like 6 people my game lags in a way that allows me to regain ap while in the air. I literally can hover forever.
---
Best way to solve that problem is to just solo it...that way it dosent matter what the other ppl do...😉
---
I always thought that the bar progress was what triggered legendary spawns (at 25%, 50%, 75%), so as long as you are certain it will hit at least 75% there isn't much benefit to letting it keep going. So repairing them becomes pointless after a certain point. 
---
I always repair them, but I assumed this is why folks aren't always right on top of it.
---
I’d go with Fireproof instead. It can make a huge difference.
---
I was hesitant to get it, so glad I did. It’s fun as hell just to play around with
---
Damn thats so weird, really hope they figure it out
---
I think theyre gonna give a new double score event before the ten weeks are up, atleast I hope so
---
Makes them vanish from your eyes in an instant, it works wonders.
---
Prediction: No-one from Bethesda will respond to this post.
---
Yeah i think this is a factor..
---
I did that once but the problem of that is they ask you for help and when they come back they usually haven’t done it and they keep asking me to help them.
---
Those are all fair points, but I’d like to make an argument for Sutton.
---
If you ask the overseer why she settled in Sutton, she said that she’d like it to be the first town to be rebuilt by her own hands. From that, I could see her starting the work, and then calling in the 76 dwellers to help her build it up into a thriving vault town. In addition, unlike the whitespring and the top of the world, Sutton has virtually no connections to any quest lines and is in a location easy for low level players fresh out of the vault to access. It also has plenty of space for plots of land and the like to exist. The other two options, if executed how you suggest, are definitely good ones as well.
---
Interesting information you've posted just now. I've never heard of these glitches. The sleeping bag part sounds annoying though it you like to keep your camp fixed up.
---
If you wanted fallout 4 with friends, it’s perfect. If you wanted a mmo with challengeing content and pvp...find a different game.
---
lol this looks fun
---
I had a nice patio now its a small square. Lol pretty soon that will disappear. 😪
---
I love going to Watoga and fly from building to building. It's a totally different game at that point.
---
***Citizen; You do*** **not** ***have the Security Clearance to speak for the Enclave at this level. This is a reminder that a repeat violation of our Information Security and Public Press Release Policy will result in severe disciplinary action.***
---
Go into a silo and scope out where the nuke would land.
---
That explains it. I am on PC and I don't have this experience. I thought maybe it was because my camp was in the mire so its just too far. I get level 30s rarely but never anyone under 20 at my camp.
---
Level 25 scrub here with only one code I found the other day in my inventory....Maybe I'm just crazy but I just love seeing the nukes go off......Like I teleported over to some high levels doing the scorch beast queen missions and even though I got endlessly wrecked,Seeing all that anarchy and all those player working together is always awesome......And just seeing the nukes hit in front of your eyes is a scary and really dope sensation......Can't wait until I'm able to launch one and actually get the rewards from it......Cheers
---
Finder's keeper.
---
I run the exact same build bar a few minor points/perk difference and this kind of build is truly the best.
---
I've had 3 in the last few encryptid events, must be getting more common.
---
Better to have some bullet sponges with you than everything attacking you.
---
You don't need to pay anything to play the game.
---
Private or public it will still only be 8 players per instance for the event
---
... You dont just craft your own?
---
It's so easy, a caveman can do it.
---
From what I've heard a nuke will auto drop on the spot every hour or so so technically its wherever the server decides to drop it and not a pc choice.
---
His radio will be in your camp build menu under allies. He'll show up as soon as you place it.
---
MI 6. is. Vn6d=!
---
Alright, what are the prizes?
---
Yes , you have to build his desk at your camp for him to show up , it should be under your allies section in build mode in your camp.
---
He will have some quests he will give you, one of them has the chance to reward you with a 3 star legendary (the weapons case quest)
---
Did you even bother to actually read what I posted none were greyed out on my screen as in its glitched for me somehow pay some attention before trying to be a smart ass
---
The only worry here is that you might get in with an individual or a group of people who are bad of the game. If you actually played the event on the PTS you would know that it's impossible to safely AFK during the event Bethesda even went out of their to remove or disable geometry in the area to prevent this sort of thing. That's not even taking into account the Fear effect that the Wendigo Colossus places on all 8 players at random intervals which also make it impossible to safely AFK.
---
The casual audience will have a harder time clearing this with randoms but the hardcore players who are properly geared and have a finished build will simply hope on a Private Server available to Fallout 1st members with some friends and not take their chances with randoms.
---
You don't have to do the run if you don't want to. And if you're not crazy about the rewards than there's no reason to grind it out.. You can just go back whatever it was you were doing before.
---
&gt; So at first glance this is a pretty good mechanic right? 
---
I would have gone with "no."
---
&gt;Damn thats so weird, really hope they figure it out
---
I hope so too, its crazy but I think if I hopped without completing the 4 objectives I had they probably would have auto-completed too.
---
&gt;I think theyre gonna give a new double score event before the ten weeks are up, atleast I hope so
---
That would be cool I guess.
---
Nah, you pretty much got it. Broadsider is trash. Energy rifles are much worse than ballistics outside of legacy explosive variants. I’m not going to go into all the specifics of why, but yeah. Facts.
---
I never agreed with jetpacks on regular armor. No longer unique to Power Armor and they don't use fusion cores while Power Armor users are penalized for using their jetpack by draining the Cores.... Stupid.
---
I’ve decided there’s no point in trying since I’m so far behind. I’m enjoying not playing every day
---
I think you get 3-4 per side at the end of it so you can do it in 1 go if lucky.
---
If I've been working on a workshop build all day, you better believe I'll hide until they get bored and leave. Some of us just like building cool stuff with others on public teams. If shooting me in the back while I'm building is valid pvp, then so is playing hide and seek!
---
Yup, mine’s at least two flamingos. You heard that right two. I know, impressive. Whaddaya mean you prefer the metric system?
---
Always do social tab stuff in main menu. Works every time for me. In game will mess up sometimes/most of the time
---
This is for every console if anyone else is reading
---
Honestly, switching perks based on the public group is just big bother and nobody cares. People come and go every few minutes and Im not going to switch cards 40x an hour.
---
Agreed, it works quite well in RuneScape, imo. Having a method to sell product offline is a no brainer in a game with a functioning economy.
---
I have the same issue hopefully you get a fix because i need it too
---
They don’t show up on my social list period, menu or in-game.
---
So I just moved my camp to the water tower just south of the bridges. I have a floating camp that faces them with artillery on the rocks. Haven't had the chance to try it out yet, but I really hope I can blow away ghouls during the event
---
Auction boxes: you put what you want to trade in it, people makes offers (caps, materials, armor, guns, serums, whatever) if you accept one of that offer your item goes directly to their stash and the offer to yours. Easy as pie
---
Or maybe just server hop 3 times at dc island, it's not hard
---
Oh? Didn't know that. Thanks for the info.
---
Not sure why you got downvoted. It's really easy to have a huge stack of Stimpacks.
---
There's a few different allies in the game, you can only have one active at a time and you need to build their item in the ally tab.
---
Damn. Only other basic option I can think of is do a reinstall of the game. Otherwise I can’t think of anything. Sorry
---
Seems like with most games PS4 always the jankest. That’s my little jab at ps4
---
Okay I didn't mean to offend you, but if you're building up a public workshop doesn't it just erase when you leave the server? Why would you put time into that? Also nobody is shooting you in the back, you literally walk up to the workbench and press X to contest it. Very different from you hiding in a corner praying for the bad man to go away.
---
Because there are kids out there that don't think on their own, and just blindly follow and parrot what some clueless youtuber tells them. Good example of this was couple weeks before double xp weekend, when this dumdum tuber made a video claiming int caps at 25 and does not increase xp gains beyond that. There was so many people on this sub arguing about the thing after that..
---
No big deal - it was a joke. Wasn’t trying to make anything political for anyone reading this and not understanding the pun.
---
Nope ps4
---
I'm 55 and haven't done all the Daily and Weekly challenges for all possible score. I haven't used the Rank Up option to pay for levels as it's best to wait toward the end.    
---
IMO, the rewards are lackluster and fans could have easily come up with better rewards.
---
And they can wear them without the helmet too.
---
i have a 2 shot, limb damage, gauss rifle i swear mine does explosive as i die if too close to an enemy
---
You don't get the explosive legendary perk, but all Gauss weapons are explosive.
---
microsoft website
---
I keep the ring sight but don't use the high capacity mag. I find the extra rounds are less useful due to the slower firing rate and fast reload speed.
---
Look again. Each armor with Freefall on it adds 50% fall damage reduction. With only two I'm able to leap off of anything and take zero damage. 
---
You're thinking of the Goat Legs perk, which does add 40% per rank for a total of 80%. Additionally, Goat Legs and the armor don't stack, which leads to some unexpected situations.
---
Oh I know. It’s not me getting into the reddit reader mood and firing up their down click.
---
Yes, that can happen. Eventually they will stop asking for help.
---
I only put my tent in the Scorchbeast Queen spot or right outside Crater's city limits.  I try not to get in the way.
---
Challenging Workshops and killing their owners isn't griefing, although I would consider it poor sportsmanship if the owner is a Lv. 5 fresh out of the Vault who takes the Gorge Junkyard, being accosted by a Lv. 400-something.
---
The fact is, in spite of the warning about Workshop putting you into PvP when you interact with the red workbench, the game nevertheless *does* encourage new players to take them until that point ("This Workshop is yours for the taking!"), which creates an unnecessary beginner's trap.  We can't expect every player to abide by good sportsmanship in this situation, but we should be mindful of new players who simply don't understand what's going on.
---
Oh yeah, i do that too
---
it’s the ps4 social menu that causes that, it has to be set in a specific way i’m not sure what setting
---
My old character was a commando. I got tired of dealing with the ammo burn. I created what was supposed to be an alt, based on Rick from Rick and Morty that is made only to grind score. His CAMP even has a sign that says, "get that sezchuan score." I may or may not go up to low levels on voice chat and call them Morty and try to get them to go on adventures and give them stuff. 
---
He's a gunslinger build, probably going to be a junkie eventually (no INT penalty addictions/effects allowed). Main weapon is an AP Explosive Pipe Revolver. 
---
I beelined INT 15 for the repeatable XP daily. This had the side effect of making him good in Power Armor (I call it his purge suit), so he can slot Stabilized and up to three points of heavy gunner (strength 3). I only use this for introducing scorchbeasts to his Furious Gatling Plasma. 
---
His high int and all the perk packs in the Season also means that at level 100 he has a ton of perk cards, so really flexible. He has been ranting about wanting perk loadouts recently though. 
---
He's a marsupial, egg head, herbivore, and speed demon. Also has eagle eyes and bird boned.
---
Build here: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3633ffb&amp;d=sg2p02ic4c62ad2ak2al2a72p22pe2eh2lu2l12l71&amp;w=a32lr2ih2ig2id2
---
The builder is a little bugged, I've had this page open tweaking it a long time.
---
I have shoot tamed animals by accident and they don't got damaged
---
I couldn't agree more. For what is their only real avenue of continued revenue, they are very sloppy with this system.
---
I don't mean the freefall perk I meant I have the mods on the SS armor which reduce falling damage.
---
I have found playing with friends being the foundation behind not getting bored/burnt out. with the game. I’ve made some friends and hop and chat with them while play.
---
Yeah I understood they have an explosive effect built in, I read on here that people were getting Explosive legendary effects on them though from their camp ally quests. I was just curious if that was rollable or if it’s just a mistake that’s happening. I grinder for that Gauss Shotgun hard and even with it putting out over 500 damage, my TSE Tesla Shotgun is way more effective. Sigh.
---
Sorry, should have clarified....***COULD*** be a deathclaw there. I saw two in one night looking for the fountain of anti-disease.
---
It’s just you and some rare individuals out of the thousands that play. 
---
I have not had any problems.
---
76 LDR/IRL relationships unite!! 
---
My bf and I love this game too. So happy to see other couples out there enjoying themselves as well!!
---
You can create vending machines in your camp where you can put things for sale in them. When you look at the map you will see other peoples camps and if you hover the curser over it then you'll see what kind of stuff is for sake there. You can create 4 vending machines and each vending machine can hold 30 items. You can select the price to sell items and there is a 10% tax but other than that you get the caps
---
Ah, that makes sense. Since the thread was about rolls I just assumed. 
---
Now I've just realized I have no idea how that mod does/doesn't interact with the perk and the legendary effect... This game can be so confusing at times.
---
he was repeatedly killing a low-level player who couldnt fight back but ran away when a higher level person showed up.
---
only cowards pick on the weak but cant handle a fair fight.
---
I've found it to be really hit and miss (literally).
---
Some player told me that's how you're supposed to the event. If everyone is stealthed and quite you get a maxed reward and the ghouls won't attack.
---
 I've done it that way when no one showed up and my Zen level was nice but it was boring. Didn't see an better reward.
---
Are there any other games that let you do this? I would like to know so I can exploit the crap out of them.
---
Absolutely even fully perked out with a shotgun build, that’s mainly why I wanted the Explosive area damage effect lol it’s all over the place
---
Fair enough, do you have proof that the combo makes it have 100% armor penetration? I'm willing to admit I'm wrong on that if I am.
---
Yeah, it does have a built in explosive effect like the Gauss Rifle
---
Man .. think of all the flamingos you’re wasting on other camp objects .
---
I took it as a joke and was joking myself. I guess I need to add the /s tag at the end of whatever is for joking.
---
For sure. I suggest sharing perks that aren’t specific to a build (IE not a perk that boosts a weapon type)
---
I saw a LIVE megasloth in Cranberry Bog yesterday and was honestly shocked. And thankful that at least that shit sandwich of a challenge was gone.
---
Tank stims, stop not even trying. Bloody builds who sit on top of the house being useless by killing the robots are annoying and lazy EXP farmers. Chug stimpacks or remove some rads for the event, you'll live.
---
I agree. The only reason I would switch out my shared perk card is if I’m in a friends group and we discuss what we want to share. Even then it’s still not worth bothering much.
---
That’s a good thought and fair point since the Overseer lives there. I feel like there should eventually be a clash of some kind between the Overseer and Rose since they kinda represents the interests of the raiders and settlers without actually siding with either faction. Maybe there’s a cool quest line there between Rose and the Overseer making the dwellers choose between a hero or villain build or something? If Whitesprings had a smaller location in it that could be turned into a clear settlement I think that it’s be really great. 
---
I think I also have it in my mind at some point Bethesda wanted the Top to be a player hub because of the original trailer where they had 4 players walking through an empty bazaar with the top of the world in the distance.
---
Definitely more convinced Sutton could be something more now! As long as Bethesda takes this idea into consideration I’d be happy with any of those options.
---
I used to say the same thing, honestly. Flabbergasted me anytime anyone mentioned it. Lo behold, it finally happened to me.
---
I think it's just the base wooden wall set, and specifically the Shutters window option, that has this bug.
---
Have you done The Path of the Enlightment lately? I don't suffer the bug until I do that event
---
I’d love to see the percentages, where is this list?
---
Especially if Bethesda truly can’t increase our stash limit safely. They need to offer us a better way to decrease how much we’re carrying other than dropping expensive, heavy gear.
---
I think it's just a Legendary draw, right? I recall getting 1's and 2's from him most of the time.
---
I don't know that my builds have really been put to shame, but mad respect for other good builders. I do like finding camps that utilize tricks I don't know how to do.
---
Was at ammo factory today and waant interested in taking from the current owner, I just went and looked or scrap. On pure autopilot I unlocked the office door and got a 10 cap wanted level. So I walked outside and popped.out my f01st tent and deposited all my scrap then went back into the factory and sat on a couch in an office, soon enough a lvl 17 shows up, it probably cost them more than 10 caps to fast travel there(I'm only level 31). They fiddle with their pipboy, I assume they're turning off pacifist and hide around a door and toss 2 grenades, I live, so they throw 2 more. I respawn at my camp and continue on my journey.
---
Ok thanks
---
Dude your the one who wrote that comment and came off toxic I knew what you were talking about and none of them are greyed out so yes I took it as you being a smart ass because of how YOU wrote it so how about you leave if you can’t word your shit better
---
Good on you.
---
Normally, the paths of me and my teammates seldom cross, but I like giving players who use exploit weapons (or are generally being selfish) the boot when I see them in Public Events.
---
If you were bored before, you'll  be bored now
---
You may be right, I haven’t done that quest in a while , for some reason I remember always getting a 3 star but maybe I just got lucky.
---
100%. It would also help create an economy for materials and the like as well, I'd imagine.
---
Granted theres not much a need, but sometimes it's just easier to buy supplies from another player rather than go out and farm them yourselves.
---
Yup, seems to be the case.
---
Better farm mole miners for that imo
---
I'm ahead by a couple ranks now. For the most part I haven't missed any of the challenges save a couple NW ones. Certainly not grinding the repeatable as diligently as I can, but I usually get a handful of them a day.
---
The last week of the season will feature bonus SCORE of some sort, with at least one more bonus of some sort before then likely as well, according to Bethesda. 
---
So you have shot.
---
Everyone knows the real trophy is getting a set of Wendigo "balls" for your display case. 😋
---
It’s a joke that items you display are part of both your CAMP budget and your inventory space. 
---
Pick one, Todd!!! Just one!
---
I’ve got stuff under them. There may be issues with especially tall issues, idk, but I’ve even got lights of various sorts hanging from them too.
---
You must grab insane ammounts of Brahmin teet. ;)
---
Just teasing i too usedcthis method!
---
My camp is outside Greg's Mining Supply so I see people under level 10 quite frequently. They're usually pretty good and I like my camp location.
---
I play on a PC, access my account through a browser. 
---
Google chrome, Microsoft Edge and Firefox.
---
Most of the rewards I would want are in the last 3rd though so I have been invested in completing it. That's kinda my point it feels like a burn out. Guess I could go test my build out in the vault raids instead of this new bloated end game. Oh wait...
---
Was he able to solo it? Was he a god ?
---
I like grenades for when I find people camping inside buildings. Open door, see enemy, shoot shotgun, grenade, tun.
---
Nuclear winter isn’t for role play. It’s for PVP. And it’s the closest to balanced PVP the game has. Outfits do not fit in balanced PvP (marine armor hidden under a ghillie outfit?)
---
Compound bow plans can be purchased from either faction with max rep or the rare settler traveling mechant. The compound bow plan and bow plan itself can't be traded, but I believe the mod plans can.
---
LOL, I don’t think so either, but oh well. Maybe a lot of Bethesda employees read this subreddit? F#@k ‘em if they can’t take a joke.
---
Yes that definitely helps! I do like the new team implementation 👍
---
I use two accounts when i'm playing the game. I always make my own party with my mule (afking somewhere) sharing rank 3 *inspirational* perk and *Empath* mutation, while my main (which i play) shares *Strange in Numbers* perk. Now... I might be a wee bit asshole about this, but when someone joins my group and shares either of the two perks i'm providing to the group already and doesn't change theirs, i'll kick that player. I'm making an effort to help others with the perks/mutation and i expect same from people who join. Usually they do change the perk they are sharing. I think it helps that my main and mule account names make it very clear that i'm one person controlling both character.
---
Not particularly. It just holds 8 rounds so for spamming purposes it and the combat shotgun are better than the double barrel.
---
It truly feels like a damn job.
---
If you “drop it” just like you drop the weapons, junk and armor you don’t want. Your power armor chasis along with its armor pieces will stay there on the ground. It will not return to your inventory. HOWEVER when you drop it, another player can walk up to it. And take it for himself. Because you basically got rid of it by dropping.
---
I always put the ammo I don't want to sell in my stash and take my unused stuff out. You're supposed to be able to just mash the button, but mine tends to just pick random selections sometimes. 
---
The UI is terrible. I don't even mind the low limit so much.
---
As far as I know, it's just the shutters on the wood wall tileset.  Other wall types don't have this problem.
---
Dammit, I was trying this next.  Plans cancelled.
---
Ok. So just the “my account” page is blank?
---
I gotta be honest, I'm a level 50-something, and just started doing events during Faschnat (sp?) And when I would fast travel to an event and people were just standing around, I'd start the event, not realizing that there was a REASON that others had not started it. It's one if those things that no one tells you, but you should somehow already know.
---
Well, I did not already know, and I'd like to apologize because I have since learned that you're not supposed to do that.
---
I did just look at it for a good five minutes while the menu music was playing.
---
Welp, today is gonna a fun day of explaining to all the travelers coming to my camp that my pet deathclaw can't be hurt please stop shooting it.
---
Yeah, definitely lesson learned.
---
I'll be there, ready to RUN!
---
Hey, you have been to my camp! :P. 
---
Probably not, but it's a staple I sell lol. I do monster mash occasionally, and refuse to save up 5k worth of candy for a 1 star legendary.   It also makes your vendor look stacked if they hover over your CAMP.  Why yes I have 1049 food items for sale friend!  Yes, 1020 of it is candy.
---
Gave it a sub too. Nice work.
---
I can sell you one if you give it back afterwards.
---
Sorry dude! If only you could level it up using atoms 😉
---
At this point you just kinda have to accept it's a constant retcon and not think about it too hard outside of "This cool shiny suit is stronk". I feel bad for Oxhorn though as he tries to keep stuff together in a somewhat linear fashion.
---
And even if the market isn’t big now, BGS wants this game to last the next decade. Any rpg that even has dashed if mmo style gameplay in it knows that the game becomes stale unless you keep injecting new items into it. Trading has gotten bigger each year and logic would suggest it’ll stay that way. 
---
It’s not like you can’t trade from your camp anymore, but sometimes I don’t want to schedule a meetup or server hop every time I’m low on oil. Even worse when it’s a brand new junk item like flux was.
---
Assuming you convince him to stay at your CAMP, you just need to place his little radio table, found in the Allies tab in your Build menu.  He'll spawn immediately somewhere near your CAMP.
---
r/flamingoforscale
---
Probably is. A lot of assets are re used from fallout 4 in 76 and this is most likely why. It would be nice to have so you can get a nice black suit and pretend to be Bond...
---
... James Bond
---
I have plenty of caps if you want to sell . My gt is killinontharun add me
---
Blue ridge caravan closer than watoga btw, if you need scrap and vendor to sell weapons right there
---
That is how i get them run its rare i do not get 1 legendary and a its quite common to get 2.
---
Well, I was swingin to the left and swingin to the right, but my fire axe wasn't doing the job.
---
Meeeeeeeeeeeat weeeeeek.
---
My first one and you all got me PUMPED
---
That was a PTS feature to help us with testing, I don't think it's meant to carry over in the live game.
---
Even if that feature was a way to test the mysterious 'Bombs Drop' event scheduled for Season 2, I'd think the nukes wouldn't always fall on top of the mine.
---
Take perk in perception for extra 60% dmg to glowing enemies, helpful
---
I like to sell mint condition prewar food in my chem &amp; food vendor so I'm always grabbing packaged and canned foods on  my travels.  I swear imitation seafood sells faster then mirelurk hotcakes!
---
Outside of bug fixes this, and increasing the camp budget because of their aggressive stance on adding new stuff, really need to be big focuses right now.
---
I like the way you think good Sir
---
Is that a thing? I would absolutely be up for that. 
---
Does that still count?
---
You let me know where and when and how much and I'll make this happen. 
---
I'm desperate haha
---
I never said I didn't participate bud I said I dont solo it try to read please
---
Too much effort. I'm not messing with my card when teammates can drop without notice. I share a card if it helps great, if it doesn't too bad, you can always find another team.
---
I've been hopping around to these camps, or trying to stumble across them to no avail. Just cultist doing cultist things haha
---
I joined with Game Pass, and I've really only had 3 bad instances. 1 was cause I didn't know you could be killed in a workshop. Yes, it says "yada yada pvp" but I thought was just during claiming period. 1 was a guy trying to rile me up by joking about losing grenade pins and dropping grenades in my house. I can't be too mad cause he did give me 1 of each of the bobbleheads for my display. 1 level 300 scared the piss out of me tho. I was going to log off and was taking down the stuff I built at a workshop. I'm still not sure about stored stuff and workshops.. so figured I'd just clean up what I put out. He jumps out of nowhere and obliterates me. I wait till the claims goes to reclaim my dropped junk but I think he was trying to be nice and offered me the workshop back? Or he was trying to kill me again.. not sure.
---
Other then those and the BS that is NW... most folks have been nice or generous.
---
Did you get your friend to relog instead? I found if the person who isn't showing up restarts it normally fixes it.
---
You mean unexploded? No, there's irradiated craters and remains of destroyed buildings.
---
he Johnston Acres guys description is of the nuclear explosion.
---
🤦‍♂️
---
I'm trying this now! :) Thank you!
---
Haha yeah I’ll meet you at a train station vendor and sell it to him, you buy it from him, and give it back, that’s all I meant. I can be online in about an hour and a half. 
---
It may even work from a player vendor machine. I think it does.
---
I’ll reply when I’m ready to go online. IGN Tazier
---
If I try to get to my account it is blank yes, white nothing on it. I can only see the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) front page, using the dropdown to navigate to digital store that is also blank.
---
In the UK, maybe a localization issue.
---
I shall try that.
---
Having only 3 Charisma, The only switch I'll make is if no one is using Strange in Numbers.
---
I'll share that card with 2* Inspirational instead of my usual 3* inspirational
---
Who would win, a powerful military on an offshore oil rig, or one tribal with a big boat?
---
Not at all, unless you insist on using explosive weapons at close range all the time.
---
Considering this is a fully priced triple-A game that then wants you to spend an additional $100 per person per year not including atom micro-transactions, he is absolutely correct to assume that they are solely focused on money and basic maintenance at this point. They've added some good expansions via wastelanders, but that's them selling you what should have been in the game at launch.
---
I enjoy the game a lot, but it is absolutely scummy in all the worst was and no one should try to defend it.
---
Maybe it will be added later when they put out brotherhood of steel updates, could always use more enclave stuff to combat the bos stuff. Guessing or hoping brotherhood and maybe enclave will get there own reputations and rewards eventually
---
Aye. Found it while protecting my pal while he did his test
---
I'll have to test this. Reason is inspirational shared shows in the perk list when 2 or 3 people are sharing it. I wouldn't assume anything- half the information floating around is old or people just parrot stuff. Why not test it out yourself?
---
That thing is massive
---
Radiation rumble will spawn at least two if people are actually collecting and turning in ore and you get to level 2 of the meter I believe.
---
Problem with this method is you also get those awful level 70 floaters with them. It becomes a real bloodbath
---
I'm in game now i could screen shot it and try and figure out how to get it on here.
---
You said it well.  When you add this grind to all of the other grinds and limits, the game becomes less fun in a way.  It is more like a chore. 
---
I still play it and grind away, but I do feel pushed and exhausted at times.  I probably won't take a break, but I wish all of it was simpler.  There are too many currencies and caveats.  It must be quite daunting to the newer players.  I wonder how many of them will stick with it.
---
just do 3 sbq in a row and u r done :)
---
Thank you for sharing!
---
No, he's saying that he trolls these kinds of posts to tell everyone how great the game is and that their particular bad experience is either (a) false or (2) their own problem.
---
Blocker perk + glowing blood 75 rad res+ radx diluted 100 rad res (may also use rad shield 300 res, but shit to farm). Or just use power armor lol
---
Currently rank 65 or 66 but yeah it burns me out, lately I do the dailies and weeklies and then if I’m feeling up to it a few daily quests and events along with raider rep daily as I have finished foundation. Been spending my other time replaying dark souls 3 for the upteenth time which is always fun.
---
That's awesome. Ladies, I just started this game. Justsaying
---
Sounds good! I greatly appreciate that! &lt;3 
---
My name is the same as here.   
---
We can do the vendor thing too if you think that's safer. I'll snag it from yours and just trade it back to you
---
This isn't a Metro game! ;-)
---
I did the first time I did the play through.....but somehow I still learned the plan.
---
Mine went "Naked" and renamed itself to the vanilla "Power Armor Chassis" rather than the custom name I had assigned.  I placed it down though and then the missing pieces magically re-appeared.  Had to rename it but now all is well again.
---
Yes, I have a nice camp set up in the ash heap. Literally no-one builds there so when my camp cannot be placed I HAVE to see who and what was built at my spot. So far the two camps I've seen were pretty bad, just wooden boxes with random decor slapped around.
---
yeah thats great ... with Herbivore mutation, Strange in Numbers and Partyboy/girl the tea gives +15 Perception
---
&gt;Each time you scrap a weapon/armor piece, the game will check the chance of learning all mods that you haven't learnt yet but you can only learn a maximum of 1 for each scrap  
---
&gt;This means that the fewer mods left, the chances of learning a mod will be lower
---
Can you explain like im 5? Doesn't that mean the fewer mods left, the greater a chance to learn a new mod since there's less in the pool? Or does each mod have a specific % to learn, and with fewer mods in the pool, you only have the rare/low percent ones left to learn??
---
Sounds like a cookie issue. Try deleting the cookie cache for Bethesda.net close browser and reload the webpage.
---
It’s going to be my office....when MODUS is finished redecorating.
---
My guess is that more people spend atoms on Slocum Joe's themed bar stools than on a new shape/material of wall.
---
We did get log cabins, tho - so there's that.
---
For me, it's all just white noise until I get actual vault walls/floors/ceilings.
---
http://imgur.com/a/UOql128
---
It's also super hard lol. Im level 202 unarmed DCG build (slowly converting my toon to a bloodied as I find/craft proper armour) and those level 70-90 death claws are a nightmare if you don't have someone with a minigun melting thier face. Sure I can 1slash 80 percent of the enemy I face with the right drugs, but not a deathclaw.
---
I don't want new reasons for players not to visit camps.  I enjoy visiting others and like when players come to visit mine.
---
I help low levels but i am not good at making connections with people so even if we spend a whole session together i dont get on a mic and i dont let others add me as friends, that way i dont have to worry about them on my friends list bugging me to play when i had plans for something else. Im a hermit let me hermit in peace lol.
---
Even on a very high end PC, there are areas with horrendous issues. Namely parts of the Whitespring golf course (primarily the south and east edges) where my FPS drops from a pleasant 70-85 down to well below 30. They don't appear to do backface culling in general, and it's especially awful here since there is a LOT of stuff being rendered that is never seen by the client (it's underground) but is still being "charged" to you in the form of greatly bogged down performance.
---
Hell, the only reason that there's no model preview in vendors (and stash too iirc) is that there was a persistent issue where it would destroy performance while in that menu.
---
It's not an awful game.
---
It's aggressively mediocre (mostly bad loot with a heavy slant towards a specific meta, bad shooting mechanics and broken core systems) but if not for the wealth of bugs, would be fun for the lore and world building.
---
No offense here. I'm okay with people doing pvp, even shooting me while I'm building. I just think it's also perfectly valid for me to hide as a strategy. I wanna build, others want resources or pvp. The smartest person hangs onto the workshop, whether through stealth or strength.
---
The things built in workshops remain until the server is rebooted, which can take days. That means hundreds of people possibly seeing the cool/weird stuff I built, even if they don't know I built it. Think of it as temporary art.
---
Anybody on ps4 that can craft me combat and metal helmets so  I can learn the plan? I've got plenty of mats and can work out payment.
---
:) how about this:
---
If you have 20 mods left and the chance to learn is 10%. It will keep rolling until either you have learnt one or you have failed at 20.
---
If you have 1 mod left it learn, that is a straight 10% chance.
---
I try to look at the server and the teams. I've had it where no one shows up when there's a ton of people on and I've had a good turnout when I was doubting anyone would show. It's a bit random. Personally, I always go to it when I see it happening.
---
Hey. You can join the plan collector discord. There are PS4 players that will do it for free.
---
Personally, I want to know when the vendor boys all got linked together again and are sharing the same 1400 cap pool... Unless I'm just missing that clock reset all the time
---
Eh? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletonization#Timeline
---
I did see a post from way  back when a guy would just pick locks at camps (not take anything) just to get a high bounty that way he knew anyone coming at him was down for pvp try that maybe
---
good call
---
Now I’m not necessarily saying this game is becoming a grindy job, but I am looking forward to vacationing away from Appalachia after the SCORE work season. Think I’ll tour Japan with the Ghost of Tsushima.
---
It's pretty much blocked without the skin too.
---
Congrats! He is a child of atom now :)
---
I measure social distancing by 4 flamingoes.
---
Ahhh gotcha! Thank you thank you! You made it super clear for me. Makes sense now.
---
That's as bad as the war drum, a truly huge blind spot.
---
How’d you get that jacket?
---
I've had the exact thing happen. People going to some crappy low level event instead of showing to  Encrypted but they're all high level. Ugh
---
Let me correct myself there for good measure: "I only have the paints up to and including the officer paint". Just missing the others.
---
Even the clothes?
---
This reminds me of a vendor I came across that once said, "This shit ain't organized cuz I'm lazy af."
---
Equally funny was the one with "Buy something or the frog gets it," with the frog-in-a-jar sitting on the table.
---
I’m closing in on 70. Hoping to get to 90 then buy the last 10 spaces as I believe you get 1500 atoms from ten spaces on the board. Looking forward to playing the remaster of Kingdoms of Amalur when that comes out next month and taking a break from 76.
---
I have tested it with my two accounts, does not stack.
---
Tried “Join Session” in the PS4 menu?
---
Awesome thank you!
---
They're incredibly rare, but they do pop up on occasion. I did Distant Thunder the other day and there was a 3 star in the group. There's also the occasional horde event.
---
There are some other posts that have had good thoughts on this, but ultimately I don’t think this is a problem with the player hub idea as much Bethesda needs to engage camps more as a vital part of gameplay. With the instanced interiors update and hopefully future fixes to camps not being place able after moving I think they can become just as important. 
---
But trading is just a mess rn. The economy is impossible to keep up with based on whatever glitch comes out next and a lot of players have been a victim of not being able to keep up. Especially those that don’t use the 76market subreddit. I’ve already referenced it a lot, but Runescape had player homes and a grand exchange and both were popular for their own reasons. Camps need to have reasons for people to come to them besides just to look at a few vending machines. But, as some others suggested, this central hub can still have a limit on how much could be sold so vending machines are still important but you can offload heavier or niche items most players wouldn’t buy.
---
Funny 'cause it's true
---
It won't matter on a next-gen console. Trust me.
---
I'm running a fairly top of the line PC (i7-9700k, dual nvme drives, 2080ti, 32gb RAM) and it runs like dogshit in some areas (Whitespring golf course boundaries) and even when it doesn't, it looks bad in so many places. Trees that are so bad that they would be out of place in WoW in 2004 level bad.
---
And I've seen people hop into these kinds of posts and claim that either they get 120fps all of the time and it's butter smooth... bullshit. Not one person has even tried to back up this claim, nor even give hardware specs.
---
Or better, blame it on connectivity... here's a fun test. I've tried it on a 100mbps with very low ping. Bad. I recently upgraded to a gigabit connection, with similarly low ping. Also bad.
---
Conversely, WoW looks and feels great at 2k on this same PC and my old 100mb connection. This is obviously apples and oranges, the the issue is NOT hardware in most cases. It's entirely on a decrepit engine that's old enough to VOTE in the US, being maintained by people who have no familiarity with it outside of the disastrous two years of this game.
---
Upvote just for the Phil Hartman reference.
---
Hey we were all children once. Children can be selfish. That's just how it goes, especially in video games. Some are more behaved than others, but whatever.
---
Honestly, just explain to them as if they were adults that you can't keep giving them freebies. Maybe you can be the mentor they need and learn from you. But if they keep being annoying, just politely nope out of there or block if need to.
---
Now if we're talking about full grown adults, screw those guys. You can still be polite about it, but I'd just block em if they don't listen to reason.
---
It's always been disappointing that since cosmetic outfits are considered armor by the system why scrapping them doesn't give chance to learn crafting recipes.
---
Where?
---
I have one on PS4, are they worth anything to anyone? Would it be worth trying to sell it?
---
So instead of feedback you're giving someone crap for saying they are a veteran player? I'd call level 170 someone putting in some time. What's wrong with you?
---
Look, it doesn't make any practical sense no matter how you try to rotate it.
---
I would love a deliverer.  That was my go-to weapon
---
One thing I noticed is in the build menu the image icon on the left hand side of the screen can make it hard to identify. It is under misc. structures though. Double check one last time I suppose before you submit a support ticket.
---
I was at the Steelheart today with an 8 and an 18, just the three of us, I am 113 or 114, don’t remember. Anyway I ban one shot those low level ferals, easily but held back so they could get some do too. One guy leveled up. Hindsight, I should’ve opened a lunch box.
---
Usually that means that they were killed by another spawn at the same location but most of the time they're still there and just not marked so go to location and look for the feral mongrels.
---
If the event pops up you can FT there even if it's an undiscovered location. I used that event on my level 18 alt the other day for the level up challenge. Almost all the ghouls were level 22, and I got over 200 candy.
---
Sorry for the probably-silly question. About the thing of mods being either "scrap to learn" or "learn from plan" but never both, does that mean that if I find a mod plan for sale from a NPC vendor then that's a plan I can never learn from scrapping? I've been avoiding buying mod plans (apart from gold bullion stuff) from NPC vendors because I thought I could learn the mods from scrapping enough stuff, but sounds like that's not the case.
---
"Here at Bethesda, quality is job... wait, what is this 'qooalitee' thing? Something about more monetization? Sweet, we love that!"
---
It's interesting... at first, the only well maintained part of the game was the Atomic shop. But the quality of that has dropped precipitously in the past year. Broken prefabs that are only fixed months after we pay (greenhouse...) and even then, broken again (passthrough walls on the airstream bungalo thingy).
---
It's not like we're getting mountains of content. And no, I don't consider insanely repetitive daily chores content, especially since they've all been in game since launch (outside of our super exciting faction dailies).
---
So why has their main source of revenue gotten so damn shoddy?
---
my bad, I just keep saying people sitting on the roof and when you call them out over voice they drum up some shitty excuse about being a bloodied build.
---
It saddens me that that takes up 29 FUs.
---
Spruce Knob lake, down towards the southern edge. It’s got some signs outside it saying wrong way. The entrance is partially flooded and booby trapped too
---
the only time I have ever seen a megasloth there was one that was one of the random SBQ spawns
---
Yeah tested it too. It doesn't stack even with 2 and 1 insp. Sorry I don't believe anyone on here. Guys posting the most boolshet stuff made me jaded!
---
you can't get enough cobalt from an SBQ nuke to craft anything.
---
I think the perk is useful for non-sneak, non-PA melee builds since crippled limbs prevent them from closing the distance and could get them killed in a bad situation (e.g., lots of Gutsy’s around). I haven’t tested this, however.
---
When you say you are rarely crippled, what build are you using? Power armor users can’t be crippled, and stealthy builds are rarely crippled for obvious reasons.
---
Just figured it out, with the garage door selected, go to put it in backwards and it clicks into place!
---
Where do you start this daily?
---
I think where you might be struggling is you want high level legendaries that could drop something you want. 
---
There's many areas that you can regularly find legendary spawns at with a few hops on the map or server jumps. 
---
Even just spawning into the SBQ queen spot, and roam the bog you'll get legendary scorchbeast spawning.
---
Which ones? You mean every vendor being linked or when we had that one near watoga and the 2 ally vendors that had a separate cap pool?
---
Two?  I have never seen two on DC island.  Where's the second one?
---
You're good man I understand mistakes thats why I didn't insult you or anything. No I pretty much insta kill the sheep as soon as his shields are down. I leave enough health for others to tag him. I see bloodied users do it to its annoying especially when they dont even shoot the robots!
---
also, don't share sunkissed. seems like virtually everyone is running a bloodied build and they get annoyed at the healing.
---
Investigate the hunter’s shack, near Abbie’s bunker.
---
Yeah for sure, you will actually get 10+ strength in doing so .. and provides a few other benefits, weight etc .. depending on your level, start collecting level 15 Raider PA and start putting it into a 2nd frame.
---
Semi-stealth commando, non PA ofc. I don't bother with stealth that much anymore. If you kill your enemies (from range) before they have a chance to react you don't get hit / crippled.
---
Lol might as well be
---
Me at the deli: Id like 3 flamingos of sammich meat pls...
---
Girl at the counter "we dont... gave.. flamingo meat..."
---
Me: oh shit this is real life isnt it...
---
Yea I keep my SiN on even if people share it. Especially with the pain it is to get into the Perk menu. No I don't want to open my perkpacks, and no I don't want to move a point or pick a perk.
---
Exactly, and the vendors are typically expensive when it comes to needing bulk supplies, or at least, in the amount I typically shop for.
---
Having a controllable, stable economy would help this game survive, and having an easy way to trade with other players consistently would help that.  Especially since seeking players out and arranging meetups is the only measure of consistency and that's a hassle.
---
As far as I know, it ONLY happens if generated by another source such as a companion's daily quest or the like. But I've never personally seen it, so all speculation on my part.
---
And yes, I mean the actual "explosive" prefix not just the fact that all gauss shotguns are technically explosive by their very nature.
---
If I may ask I've only heard of PTSD but you have CPTSD, are they two different things? Or are they exactly the same?
---
Last night, playing trying to empty out my inventory I checked Morgantown, Pleasantville, White springs, and Watoga. I could have sworn responders had a pool, raiders, and White springs all were separate.
---
So you can't change the swing direction?
---
That’s what I was wondering after blowing through legendary modules...even a 3* Furious is lackluster compared to what I’ve been carrying for the last 18 months...such a bummer
---
Hazmat suit is a very useful tool for berserker. CSS gives 100+ DR which absolutely beak berserker so it's a necessity in this case. There was 1 hazmat skin released last year near July 4th: American colors RWB and I'm kicking myself in the ass for not buying it then as it would have really made my berserker stand out in a crowd.
---
Isn't that a NW item?
---
seriously go here. I sometimes get 3 deathclaws - done in one trip if you're lucky
---
If you feel this way now, wait until next season.  You sound like me when I was playing the first Destiny 2 100-level season.  When the second season hit and I was back at 0 with really not that much to show for it and only slightly tweaked grinding in the new season, it felt completely demoralizing and futile.
---
I've learned through these two games  that I'm the type of player where grind is not nearly as good as new story and real content.  I'll finish this season for the novelty of it, but most likely not play for future seasons until real DLC drops.  I'll go play other games until substantial content is added.  And with Assassin's Creed, Cyberpunk 2077 and Ghost of T, there's plenty out there.
---
Thanks, tried deleting all browser history inc cookies on Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera as fresh install, still cannot get to account page.
---
Managed to get to account on Edge once and clicked transactions, memberships and the Fallout 1st buy again button which froze the page resulting in an error page not responding popup.
---
I'll try again later. Thanks for your advice!
---
No surgical masks?
---
I'm gonna finish it and probably use my saved atoms on the last few items. 
---
Then I'll take a break from the game. I'll be back when they add something to do end game that doesn't involve repeating the same 4 events. Harder areas would be nice but I doubt it
---
Vault-Tec thanks you for your commitment and sacrifice in the name of *Science!* vault dweller. 
---
Your remaining belongings and a small stipend have been dispatched to your nominated next-of-kin. ^(Vault-Tec assumes no responsibility or accountability for any damge to or loss of items in transit. All items and stipend are non-transferable and become property of Vault-tec in the event of failure to communicate with or locate nominated next-of-kin.)
---
They can't fix basic things in game like missing mods on SS armor (though SUPPOSEDLY coming in patch 21, many months after the item released) or The Fixer being identical to combat rifle in all ways, but unable to be painted. These are very simple item flags.
---
Something as complex as the rendering engine? It would break every last thing in the game when handled by these monetization experts.
---
That is really weird. Hopefully you can get it sorted out.
---
Huh! Interesting. I could have sworn it took a lot,, lot longer than that. But that also means any exposed to the elements, let alone places like the lake bed (let alone any of the other games) should have been long since worn away. Fascinating.
---
I just fought one for the first time yesterday as well. It's a nightmare as a melee player. It's hit ox is weird and the terrify really slows me down. Me and my brother actually had to join random public teams and hope the other members would see the terrified emote and realize we were fighting.
---
Yea there are lots of those around after wastelanders.
---
I really wish the Science Scribe and Elder uniforms were red and blue respectively, loved how they were all classified in F3 and Fnv. Or atleast give the Elder T-60 a dark blue paint scheme, really wish we could mod Fallout 76
---
It’s so boring, it’s just another game now where they demand daily attention. This isn’t what we all picked up a controller for years ago.
---
I have a furious (nice), instigating (eh) and just the other day rolled a quad... that one is interesting since the base damage is high enough and now so much less very slow reloading!
---
But I still use my AA ffr Fixer for most things. To quote Todd... "it just works". And in this case, it's not a lie! ;)
---
Exactly! It’s the biggest issue a lot of console-based games have that PC and mobile just crush these games on. They seem to have this idea that if a feature isn’t implemented there will be a 3rd party platform or player base who will cover it. It shouldn’t just be the fraction of us who accept the hassle of going on reddit. Plus more time people are spending on the game theoretically less player fatigue from having fewer steps just to enjoy the game
---
I started with Fallout 3. The game was very immersive and I felt like I was really trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic setting, while also making decisions that affected my place in the world. Every game since has matched that immersion for me.
---
The perk card that gives shotguns a faster reload is nice on it, biggest complaint on my Tesla is how insanely slow the reload is
---
Outside of the very fun and very short new questline (8ish hours if you take your time), grind. Tons of new grind with very little reward.
---
Its something I quite enjoy - playing around in a workshop, to build a blueprint I can take into NW.
---
I personally like the stuff that baffles players when they see it - my fav is a portaloo with a billboard above it that has (in big neon letters) "Not a decoy! Honest!"
---
People presume its a bluff, and never go look at me sat in my portaloo.
---
That's correct. Mods can either be learned from scrapping OR from a plan - never both. If you see a plan, it means it can't be learned from scrapping
---
I hate you :-(
---
WHATTT THA FUCK?!?
---
Never get internet from exede, it’s horrible and what they charge for it should be a crime. You’d be much better off with a 50$ straight talk plan that offers you hotspot data for your phone, much faster internet and much cheaper.
---
(Only downside is my hotspot data is only good for 10gb, after that I can’t use my hotspot anymore and I have to go back to using this horrible house WiFi... So I use my hotspot for games only and it’ll last awhile. Any videos or browsing I need to do, I do on my phone that has the hotspot. It may only have 10gb for hotspot data but the internet on the phone in unlimited with the plan I got.)
---
Seriously, I picked my own perks as I leveled. I don't need anyone to share their perks and act like that are doing me some amazing life changing favor.
---
&gt; I enjoy the game a lot, but it is absolutely scummy in all the worst was and no one should try to defend it.
---
First. I can defend what I like. By providing this kind of feedback about the game, I'm not defending it, I'm telling them what I find acceptable in a game. 
---
And of course they focused on money. Let me clue you in on something. They are an entertainment company, that only makes entertainment. The only purpose of entertainment of this nature is to make money. Nothing more, nothing less. 
---
So everyone that brings up that they only do this for money can get off the high horse. They never claimed to be trying to do anything other than make video games to make money.
---
It also hasn’t been a fully priced game for a very long time. 
---
Seriously that reason you gave is like verbatim one that so many people just copy and repeat it has no meaning.
---
No problem!
---
As a Game pass noob, I'm sorry. Not all of us are like that. Some of us are just here to explore, get overwhlemed by 3 Yao guai chewing our asses off at once and generally being lost by a number of the games mechanics. Also accidently selling stimpacks that I really should've held onto. You burn thru a surprising amount when you aggro a legendary level 50 scorchbest at level 33. Thank you to that one guys base that had lasers defending it.. that helped for a bit.
---
Sweet zombie jesus, that's one of the worst parts. The other being that since it's a legacy (TSE), I accidentally kill myself even with a dense chest AND fireproof ;)
---
I tried using the gauss at Guided Meditation (super underrated event honestly) and it was a delight to so easily cripple them at long range and wtihout even bothering to target limbs.
---
It’s possible. I played at the very start then quit till just before wastelanders. Can’t remember how it used to be. There are still a few vendors that, if Bethesda fixes it, have an extra 1400 cap pool(so 2800 a day) but I think they want caps to mostly be traded amongst players so the value of caps doesn’t inflate as quickly like it has. If it weren’t an online game this wouldn’t normally be an issue but it’s pretty serious for F76
---
i'm going to start measuring my camp budget in flamingo's thank you
---
I love this. I have plenty of ideas that I would even go as far as drawing up schematics for players on other platforms.
---
Just ignore him. Regardless of the rarity, this is a pretty huge issue since that awful grind is the linchpin of most of the new "content" we have since Wastelanders.
---
Though "thousands that play" is unintentionally hilarious ;)
---
Damn, sorry to hear that. Unfortunately there's no guarantee on them but that is the most reliable way of finding one. I'm not sure if just picking one and server hopping might be better?
---
I kill myself all the time as a full health explosive build lol but yeah, camping on top of one of those pagodas up there is money....and don’t get me started on Rumble. Sheesh.
---
I decrypted my first nuke code last year sometime. I watched a youtube video on how to do it. I collected the codes, did all the decryption,  and launched my nuke on the Whitesprings!!  
---
Then I fast travelled there, suited up and charged in and.....crash to start screen. 
---
Good luck!!
---
One thing I didn't mention in the video is if your on console the PS4 second screen on the Xbox equivalent is great cause you can Mash x on your phone while you do real life things or something
---
Well, it's not your fault really, the first 10 levels and perks perks the game makes you choose from are a standard set, and tied to level (so you'll get the scrapper perk card for example at level four, and it will be locked to level 6 or 7) so the game is encouraging you to basically try different perks.
---
Also, I dont think a single person on thier first playthrough really understood the perk system till at least 20 or 30; you're no different.
---
Like others have said you can change them at level 50, but do what works for you.
---
I had a commando/sniper build in mind my first 25 levels untill I realized commando builds use soo many bullets, and I'd have to do twice weekly luckyhole mine lead runs to maintain my ammo.
---
After that I started to focus on melee, so I could save up ammo. 
---
Also, at some point I believed if I maxed out demo expert and other explosive perks it would be a huge come up for my toon when I finally got an explosive weapon. I was wrong ofcourse, grenades and land mines are situationally good, and strong at the beginning of the game, but very underpowered  mid to endgame, even with the perks maxed out.  The only time I enjoyed and used my demo expert maxed was recently when I finally found a two shot fatman. It was fun and did about 2600 damage but was more of a fun quirky weapon not a must have. 
---
I'd say dont beat yourself up over it. You'll likely try many different builds and the perks you already have will be used at some point.
---
I always find enough if I check the fissure sites in the cranberry big and whitesprings.
---
Always check them first.
---
WELL!
---
I just went and bought the bundle and i cannot see it either
---
HMMMMM! The door isn't even there either
---
Yep, just a quick tug every time I visit my camp lol
---
The really complain about user interfaces when we're still using the same ui since in fallout 3 has always sucked cuz skyrim's is so uglythe only real achievement of user interface buy Bethesda was oblivion
---
Jesus Fucking Christ.
---
Fast travel to Big bend Tunnel East.  Start Riding Shotgun (which is available to spawn like 90% of the time).  Get a legendary boss halfway through (almost always three stars).  Finish the event or fuck it.  Repeat.
---
Why is this so hard for people?
---
Sound like a great idea. Always wanted to slap down my camp in NW but it's too big for a single blueprint. So far I've just got a couple blueprints of various portapotty configurations to joke around with in NW.
---
As for adventure mode, I can see the application. How well do the work in camps with elevation changes? Elevation changes in this game make it hard to build modular camps from my meager attempts at it.
---
Thank you! Will try this next time I'm on!
---
Yeah, it works fine but it's even better if you can get it out of the rads so you can use your unyielding armor
---
I was making fun of the header. My real question is how can anarchy have a symbol?
---
I overuse that with everything.
---
oh thank you
---
ah yes, flamingos, the only proper way to measure build budget
---
Ditto I have it in 2 of my char camps, in Misc tab
---
I found it. It doesn't look like a dome on the pic. Mine is above the punch bowl
---
It’s ridiculous that this still happens but I haven’t heard many complaints about it in a while. 
---
Make sure you hit him up within 24 hours of the reset, haven’t missed one since I started doing that. His reset is at 8pm EST on Saturday. I was a few hours outside that window yesterday and still got my gold.
---
Ever find a fix for this?
---
also no toilet paper....
---
It's okay. I appreciate the response though. It gave me hope. 
---
A member of the reddit said they'd help me out and sell it to me and I'll trade it back. If that works, I'll be happier than a pig in mud haha
---
Oh, I've hopped more server than Judy
---
Catch up and stay ahead of the green spaceship on the board and you should be fine. Right? 
---
Somebody correct me if I’m wrong.
---
I do Wes Tek and the hotel. Haven't had TOO much trouble finding legendaries. It's tough when it's 3...
---
I wish it were possible to just wear the codpiece.
---
So you just say the exact same thing as me, but it's only right when you say it? Okay. 
---
There's no reasoning with people like you. For the record I said, it's highly unlikely to happen because their focus is the moneymakers, which QoL and bug fixing are not. But you go head and keep preaching about high horses Mr Irony.
---
I honestly would really like an increase in workshop yields perk card. I feel like I wait around awhile for only 10 acid or lead scraps when I could have gotten a bunch more if I just hunted cave crickets or what not. It feels like its not the best use of resources and should be a bigger part of the whole workshop thing.
---
Huh, that's good to know, thanks! I always assumed he was on a timer that started once you emptied him out.
---
my first camp was there. I never understood why it was so popular.
---
The bundle description does say it includes the dome right?
---
Damn quantum SBs! That's gotta hurt.
---
...but did you place your camp and get your SCORE for the day?!
---
Exactly the problems I want to fix. Modular bluepriting allows for larger and more detailed structure configuration.
---
Modular blueprints would clip onto each other, elevation would not matter.
---
Edit... If you mean placing on a slope then I haven't quite figured this out yet, but I have a couple ideas. Modules would be able to be placed on top of one another freely or clip to the side.
---
That's when you tell them to piss off and block them. pretty simple.
---
Thanks, this makes me less concerned that I've messed up. I'll probably follow what you said and others and choose the perks that focus on the playstyle I wanna run.
---
Rank72/ respec intelligence build , using exp boosting buffs wisely when I play . I miss the NW challenges when they take more then logging in once .
---
Figured it out, ty, kind friend.
---
Yeah it’s hard to see in the little icon image.
---
Damn hoarders xD
---
HAHAHAHA it looks so weird
---
Yeah. It's there near the top for me. Above punch bowl. Below steel bungalow. Pic looks blank
---
That's fair. ;P
---
I agree though, the grind is long enough for gold without this being thrown into the mix...
---
You have got some problems.
---
I'll use logic you find acceptable. More people agree with me than you. So that makes me right. I also got an award for this post, so that makes me right as well.
---
Yup. That’s pretty much it. I have a bed in a locked room at my base.  I go in there to let the dude rest while I go. Also have an instrument in there I sometimes let him play.
---
I think that’s exactly where I left off today...
---
Thankfully so. I might have just deleted 76 if I had gone through that just to be like, "wayment"
---
Start your own.
---
You can't be kicked from your group and others will eventually join you.
---
What... Did i just... Eh... Read..?
---
Yeah I still blow myself up all the time with it lol
---
The Blood Eagles Camp right next to Pleasant Valley Station has a metal helmet that spawns on the shelf behind the counter. Right next to the safe is a shelf which usually has Salisbury Stake on the lower shelf and a metal helmet on the upper shelf. 
---
My camp is right next to there, so I have looted that metal helmet many times.
---
You should pick one of those and stick with it. I think a rifle/sniper build is just fine. I personally went heavy weapons which sucked until I got a minigun then it was easy as hell. Just focus on grabbing all the perk cards that increase your damage and it should be pretty easy for you.
---
Exploring, leveling up, getting stronger, taking on more difficult dungeons. The lore and environmental story telling is also fun to piece together. 
---
This title is the same but with a social component. It’s also very meditative for me if I’m being honest.
---
Its not a replacer, just another endgame nuke required boss.
---
No idea, never happened to me in 2 characters, done it every Sunday morning before the family is up, like clock work.
---
I’ve never played NW, just adventure.  I assumed it was something that came and went from the Atom shop.  Can anyone confirm?
---
Riding shotgun alone clear up at least 3 or 4 dailies. Please stop telling other people to go there. K thx bye.
---
Anything that frees the mind is good.
---
It is nice to escape from reality every now and again.
---
I go to my camp, equip the happy camper park, and either sleep or start playing an instrument. It’s not like other players can really even hurt you, so no need to do anything crazy.
---
The place around and beside the Pleasant Valley Train Station and Emmet Mountain was loaded down with cobalt flux. Some saint was nuking places on a server I happened to land on when I was building my jet pack and I scooped up a lot of cobalt flux around that area, lots of sap and berries there. 
---
I've only ever found a handful of firecracker berries around the Forward Station Delta for cobalt flux at the SBQ.
---
Aha so we're on to personal attack. Case in point, no reasoning. Your wounded ego has revealed your inner defeat. Congrats.
---
And the pay sucks
---
Not sure if your asking for help to be able to craft it yourself or to have someone craft for you. If you wanting someone to craft it for you I can help you out. U think I found all the plans during the Christmas present event.
---
Priorities. The moth man billboard is more important, therefore more expensive
---
I am pretty sure all of the Night Vision Scopes and all of the ammo change receivers are learned from a plan. I don't remember any other mods being from plans.
---
How many flamingos could a flamingo camp hold if the flamingo camp was only flamingos.
---
Things don't work like Fallout 4. There is no way currently to display your armor the same way you display objects in a display case.
---
still 65, already burnt
---
Im not finding it too bad, but thats because I have  system that works for me; I have a daily's window from 17.30 - 18.00 while the kids are eating their dinner.
---
During this time I will log on, and do the dailys in as effecient a manner as possible. I'm pretty much running on autopilot while I do this. When Ive done the dailys, or it hits 18.00 I log off.
---
Then, later when the kids are in bed, I decide what I fancy playing for the evening. Some evenings I play 76, free from having to worry about dailys, and I can go about doing things I actually enjoy. Other evenings I play different games.
---
This gets the run done for me, without making me hate playing 76
---
It was just a idea I was balling on thats all :)
---
Main target are the power plants. Mainly for a monopoly on fusion cores. Normally gets us in the toughest fights. Sometimes we get a level 300 sniffing around and get excited for a nice brawl and are then disappointed when they go down with little trouble.
---
Wow, welp im wrong apparently. Did not know that.
---
Precisely, relying on players to fix the issues themselves instead of implementing something, which at this point, would be a massive QoL improvement to me is not only asinine, but also has the potential to increase that player fatigue you mentioned by increasing the effort it takes to accomplish a task as simple as trading.
---
Cool, thanks for the info. Guess I'll start actually buying interesting looking mods at robot vendors now.
---
A lot of people say bloody is great but if you wanna to do it wait for a few hours of playing. My first build was just learning how to build every gun/armor.
---
If this is still accurate 500.
---
I drank from someones bowl once... only once! 
---
"Where the hell am i? Why are those cultists so high level?! Oh god.. hide and fast travel!!!!"
---
NUKE
---
Tagging more than 3 users in a post tags nobody.
---
Buy from other players (0/3) has been on everyday all weekend it seems.
---
Passerby: ‘Shady-nasty’s?’
---
Frank: ‘It’s Sha-dynasty’s, asshole!’
---
Passerby: ‘Whatever...’
---
Frank: ‘He’s out of here.’
---
Dino: ‘...IS that how you spell it??’
---
I'd like to know what its for too! They put all the effort into adding things like that, and all the weird voting booths, plus all the bungalows in whitesprings with handscanners... it seems bizarre they've just been left out of the story.
---
I had a pretty fun pvp experience with a level lime 28 or 38 around that level he was pulling some wiley coyote bullshit he came back like 7 times one yime he even tried to snipe me from the nearby cliff of red rocket station with a missile launcher and he tried sneaking up on me with a gamma gun ot was pretty fun.
---
We normally get high level folks to fight goin around the power plant workshops. Folks get competitive for those fusion cores.
---
Actually I'm a Mod xD
---
Most night vision are plan only. But yeah, there are loads of other weapon/armor mods that are plan only. 100s really - too many to list.
---
Halloween Candy counts for this challenge.
---
That is the part that annoys me.  Well, one of them.  Putting bobble heads or magazines on a rack takes up camp space?  How dumb.
---
On a side note, I have been ready to nuke my own camp just to show that damn slab what it is like to need support.
---
Valid idea.
---
I could go for that as an alternate to the more space in the extractor. 
---
For me, its not about how fast it creates it but how often I am in the camp to pick it up.
---
You know as soon as you get it done you'll start finding them everywhere? Lol.
---
I like to wait until my team is knee deep in the radiation rumble event and then find a corner to hide while I poop. But I only.....and I mean ONLY poop during that specific event, every other event I just pee myself or find the nearest mountain dew bottle. I'll hold a turd in for a SBQ.
---
Do they cap out? I was unaware, I just assumed it took it that long to produce 10 gold ore while I was out murdering the swamps.
---
Always encouraging to hear a tale of wasteland justice. You may have saved that level 8’s faith in the community.
---
Never really had any problems myself tbh 
---
Are on a xbox one, s or x?
---
Murphy's Law of Mothman Wings - The moment you don't need them, you find them in abundance. 
---
Hopefully I can hold on to them and pay it forward to someone like me in the future, if that scenario plays out haha
---
Jesus what a pain in the ass. Thank you for reminding me how amazing nukacrypt is
---
Same, the capital wasteland is just around the corner, but its gonna take the BOS like another 100+ years to make it there.
---
What you want is bear arms, which will reduce most heavy guns to the weight of a pistol, even if you don’t have room trade a heavy gunner damage perk for it because it will pay for itself
---
I hand the controller to my husband and tell him to make sure nothing kills me.
---
:shrug: I do that too. It works maybe a third of the time and is ridiculous either way. There's just no reason for it. Whatever they use to determine which icon is on top doesn't work very well in practice. They need to give us some control over that if they're going to make /all/ of the icons interactable. What they've got now is just really poor design.
---
Easiest way I found is full crit bar with a Double Barrel shotgun. Each pellet counts as an individual crit and the fire rate is fast enough where you can get two shots to count for one crit bar sometimes.
---
I usually turn on the area mic, announce to everyone around me I'm going to go take a piss.  Then I remove all my armor and clothes and leave him standing there.  Usually it's right in the middle of a Scorched Queen battle.....
---
That could be fun :)
---
I join a random event and turn on auto-walk or just log out
---
Hope does it feel to use the exact same weapon over and over again? Variety is the spice of life
---
Would be cool if they had an animation of you zipping it open and pulling out a full Gatling plasma
---
The game is fairly broken. Just have fun and make something you like. I'm lvl 404 and have a geico caveman character.  I'm going to start a Zohan character soon that only uses fists and grenades. "You don't mess with the Zohan".
---
Yeah, it's the first thing mentioned in the bundle
---
To be fair to Bethesda they stuck with it.
---
And i bet they,as we, have learned much along the way.
---
I felt It was unfairly slaughtered in the early days by critics.
---
Was it really ever as bad they made out though ?
---
I enjoyed the vast open world,i also enjoyed the solitude when it was not  inhabited.
---
As the game has evolved i have enjoyed evolving with it.
---
And what we have now in my opinion is a fairly decent game.
---
Yeah!!! No door either!  Are the plants etc. Showing for you?
---
Agree
---
I go back to camp, dump all my junk, and climb into bed, sit at the Campfire, orplay an instrument.
---
I saw that guy who hangs out outside of Vault-Tec University wearing one the other day!
---
It's fun being on PC. I don't even remember the last time I heard a kid. It's excellent.
---
I must give it another look
---
Bro, ward went out back to take a dump and the hogs ate 'em!
---
Yup! Because you started them. Now to put you on block.
---
I would buy it, but not if it was more than 100 caps or so. It would only be good for displaying and I'm not even positive it would work.
---
Theres a static easy Stingwing spawn at Bleeding Kates near the Mistress of Mystery mansion (Riverside manor?). Theres usually 3 or so of them there
---
Those contain crimson, and florescent.
---
Once I was playing 76 with my friend and he goes "Aw shit!" and I said "What?" and then he says "I gotta shit!", then leaves for a bit to do that
---
Plants are but cannot find door
---
EDIT: DOOR IS THERE BUT IT'S CALLED DOOR!
---
I'm am man, how do I get one of these "husbands" you speak of. Are they order-able through amazon?
---
Unsurprisingly this looks common. On par for Bethesda. They used to show the workshop logo so it's easy to spot em but now they have icons like every other place so you need to remember where they are.
---
Another random spot I've just remembered. If you check Sacrament then head east to the cliff edge overlooking the ammo factory there's an old brewing shed. That's a random spawn for cryptids. I've had a camp there That's had a mothman and flatwoods show up.
---
You can easily solo this event.
---
Top tip.Before you light the fire,go and kill the 3 Scorched that will spawn when you light the fire at the internal Hub.
---
Once you have done that.
---
Light the Fire jump on top of the Archway in front of the fire and Snipe away.
---
Dude thanks for telling me, but I feel like that is a little weird. I know they have their reasons.
---
If you got XP for kills from other people close by I would agree, honestly I’m lucky to get a 3rd of the XP without the tent glitch.
---
Russian amazon maybe?
---
Never trust a synth..
---
Probably. Amazon has everything.
---
It just takes too long.  Just give me a slide bar so I can tell it how many I want to convert... I don’t care about the conversion rates..
---
Like it's crazy. I've read about some people who go in about a year ago, and it has a special currency requirement with items already in a MODUS vendor in it that are presidential themed apparently, and theres a full crafting area as well. I'm hoping the other commentor is right and they are added to contrast the BoS in the future for a seperate reputation type thing
---
Well they look all over this sub regularly. So I can only imagine that they must have seen it at least.
---
The odds are favorable..
---
Just wear the stealth suit then
---
you can get the board down to 1.7K
---
Just another thing they don't bother thinking about. Pretty ridiculous.
---
With the long success and content of Elder Scrolls Online with a company under the same higher company. What the f*** was their thought process with 76?
---
Its sad these days, on Xbox there's barely players on the map. Its such a shame.
---
Green hood
---
Fallout 76 seems to be lacking a lot of the main appeal of the other games, at least for me. The other games, even Fallout 4 to a much lesser extent, had a great deal of moral and ethical dilemma would shape the world of the game and how the world interacted with you based on some of the choices you made as you played the game.
---
Fallout 76 really seems to have lost the element of consequence for your actions, at least directly from the game, instead, you get the consequence from other players to an extent. 
---
Fallout 3 and New Vegas, both had a great karma system where your actions had positive and negative results, you could play as evil or good character. You can still do that in Fallout 76, but it's really either being very helpful to players or being a jerk to other players where that comes into play in this game. 
---
If you want a good story, go for Fallout 3 or New Vegas, you want to just play a single-player game without the impact of your good or evil choices play Fallout 4.
---
So you want all the advantages of the power armour And sneaking?
---
okay! Why not.
---
Advice for new players 
---
Pick a build (melee or sniper is easiest for new players) but for the first 25 plus levels use any weapon you find as the benefits of perks don’t amount to two much early on. So have a shotgun and a pistol as well as a rifle.... use all the ammo. 
---
Early perks are often kind of meh but grab pharma finder and equip it. It gives you extra chems from medical boxes and mirrors in bathrooms. Keep the healing items and sell the rest, this will keep you golden for stimpaks and caps. Another good perk for early on is scrounged which does the same for ammo. Check all boxes! 
---
Get the scrapper perk and then build and break down leather armor to make the mods without losing to much materials.
---
If you are up tot hat part of the game, the Whitespring bunker is the best place to farm for it. The room with all the terminals you do the exam at will spawn tech data in the desks usually. Having said that the last few times Ive been there to look it has only spawned 1 whereas before Ive gotten up to 4 pieces there. Its still something though. When you search only take the data and leave whatever else is there. Theres a chance next time you load to a server it will reroll to tech data
---
I just shit my pants
---
dont do challenges if u dont like them, dont play the game if u dont like it. u own the problem u have with this game :)
---
I havent seen the comments but if you say the gatling gun sucks then your an offensive word.
---
Know where to find one?
---
What a muppet lol
---
BRRRRT
---
New in the atom shop: Streamlined C.A.M.P. unit!  Only 10000 atoms!
---
Really? I think you could see enough without it based on the pics.
---
Yeah, why not? You still tank a whole lot more with Legendary Armor + Serendipity.
---
So, I always say this but ... I had these mods on fallout 4 that had (Kellog's) cybernetics and also I tried one with exosuits that were smaller. Right now it seems like they don't have sophisticated enough mob behaviour/AI to warrant that degree of attenuation. Also secret service armor
---
Ok that doesn't seem like griefing then but the camp thing yes but yea it had to be old school cuz you cant do that anymore without eb
---
It's cool. I've never seen a game with so much wrong or misleading information about it out there. You can't even trust the wikis or the strategy guide. Been playing since beta and there is still stuff i keep learning about.
---
hey. Unfortunately there is no way to complete main quests as a team. quests are solo play, but they can come and kill baddies along the way. you can time them all together though.  you guys can do events as a team though.  public events appear on the map and yellow hexagons and featured events show up on your screen.  
---
just proceed along the main questline to unlock everything to build at your camp.  you guys can drop resources between each other.
---
The sound of my people!
---
Even better if it continues the established “rebuild America” narrative they’ve begun, which I could see being pretty strong in Sutton, as you said. And with the BoS becoming a factor who knows maybe it could even be them who establishes this social hub - since these guys are supposed to be coming from Maxson’s battalion who encouraged cooperation. The BoS, being weakened by 10 years of travel could decide after fractured steel that if they want to survive they need a way to provide help to the dwellers in exchange for financial support and technology. 
---
I can only imagine they’re going to make sure this entire game isn’t one massive retcon by having Modus fire nukes on all Appalachia the day before F5 comes out lol.
---
You do, but I can't remember if the game *makes you* take it.
---
Keep at it. I had a huge drought of paint drops where I was certain I wasnt getting any more and then suddenly I got another. Sometimes Id get a couple close together then another drought. I finally got the elder paint recently
---
Yup. Only seen this once, but they got kicked immediately
---
I went to the substation(watoga), killed it, ran up the bog for some views and other kills, walked back down, killed it again. Ran line in the sand, then walked back one more tiime and killed it again. 
---
Although fast traveling everywhere under the sun praying its been 20 minutes since the last time someone was there is fun and all, i found this way more enjoyable.
---
I was that lvl 95 on my first character. I hated pvp aspect because I wasn't trying to fight I was more about playing surviving and exploring, really trying to figure the game out. The game is so huge you really have no clue what your doing the first time through until your about his level sadly.
---
My fiance and I played most of the main game by ourselves on a 2 person team. If one of you have fallout 1st, you can join private servers and just play with the 3 of you, so that all enemy spawn/levels and items are not taken or messed up by other players. Anyway that's not too important, public adventure servers are just as good if not better.
---
The best way to experience the game imo is to just follow the main quests and do side quests as you see fit or if they are nearby. The game basically has two types of questlines - quests that do not involve humans are generally original quests before the Wastelanders free DLC update. These quests allow you to complete it as a group, as you generally do not need to enter loaded instance zones. Quests that involve humans are from the updated Wastelanders DLC, and unfortunately for whatever reason, they are mostly instanced and ONLY the team leader gets quest progression. It sucks for real. The way around this is to just swap who is the team leader and do each of those types of quests 3 times in a row (can be tedious for sure). Or you just have to each enter solo to complete which kinda defeats the purpose.
---
However, you can explore the world and complete all side quests together as a team without issue. Also build some CAMPS, those are really fun to build up, and even more fun if playing on public servers as others can see your CAMP, and you can visit all sorts of different player CAMPS.
---
I would play at your own pace, and focus on the main/side missions for now. And explore and get lost in the world. There are lots of secrets and secret missions that only pop up if you find them. Try not to fast travel too much in the early stages - exploration and finding new areas is a lot of fun
---
EDIT: Once you start reaching levels 30-50 you'll prob get a feel for what type of guns or perks you really like. Class building is very flexible and a lot of fun. You can also do public events (a notification pops up in the top left corner when one is available). All players can fast travel to these events for free to do them. I wouldn't worry about them too much at low level tho, as it makes you teleport all over the map and imo can ruin the early game progression. That's just me tho, the public events are made to be joined and there's a level recommendation on them.
---
Congrats, you have officially became better than every other PVP’r out there... 
---
Most wank stains that like PVP are the type of people to complain about PVP nerfs, then shoot some low level player in the back standing in a workshop as they were going through a menu, then say “It’s a PVP zone they should have known better.”
---
You however, actually have some humanity and felt guilty about jumping this dude who barely had anything, then gave him some of your stuff. And for that I salute you.
---
I would like all the benefits of Power Armour with the stealth suit please
---
It’s so... earthy.
---
If this is still accurate, 500.
---
And none of the drawbacks, please lads.
---
Same my friends keep my playing. We usually just bullshit, run events, and swap out legendary weapons to play with. Keeps the game fun.
---
Huh. I have tried a berserker’s dragon once, and it was pretty good. Does it stand up to bloodied?
---
Yeah, should have kept my Unyielding SSA armor, but dumped them for the perfectly rolled armor pieces through trading. Kind of regret it now though. Haven’t gotten another Unyielding piece for awhile now.
---
I picked it up, but when I go into the perk page there are no perks cards from the pack, just the one card I choose with the special, that does not seem right.
---
Yeah, I have to log in every 24 hours or something.. I just kill the launcher in taskbar, make sure theres no BethLauncher processes going and start it again
---
my glass domes would float in those nicely
---
I want shotguns fixed. As a shotgun build, I hate having health reappear on enemies and having to use vats
---
You mean legendary effects. That’s a big drawback + no Serendipity.
---
I just go to two, three fissure sites. Legendary Scorchbeasts are plentiful.
---
I typically go and crouch on my CAMP's roof.  There's not a whole lot that could get me there, and I don't camp in areas with Scorchbeasts or anything.
---
But it kind of depends, also, on what timers I have running.  Like, if I have a bunch of Lunchboxes in effect, I'm more likely to just quit and rejoin.
---
I hadn't even thought of that possibility, tbh. Most of my thinking of the BoS is that they're gonna fight with the Enclave or they're gonna fight against Maxons vision of the BoS because of that 10 year travel across the US... for some reason I completely ignored the possibility of them wanting to build civilization up, and as you said, itd be a great time for them to implement a trading hub in ATLAS.
---
They really are just fucking with us now aren’t they.
---
Ah man I actually wanted this to be good. :(
---
No you don't. You tank a lot with right gear, but PA with the right mods will make you invincible to everything but poison.
---
Ok I'm on ps4 and I always try to give stuff that's to high of a level to a higher level player for free I gave a level 50 gun for one bottle cap
---
Okay awesome! I'll check there tonight! Thank you!

They don’t hit nearly as hard, ammo is annoying to get, mag capacity is low so you’re constantly reloading. They can be useful for slowing down the scorchbeast queen, but any competent group can kill her without the slowing. The only use I’ve really had for them is slowing down other players, the slow effect works on people even if they are in passive and the only way to remove it is to log out, so it’s kind of a troll weapon. 
---
Even still, any explo Cryolator is worth more than max caps lol
---
*YOU WILL SPEND MORE TIME WITH US NOW! AND MORE AND MORE*
---
FFS
---
I don't see the problem. Deathclaws are easy to kill.
---
You get card packs at level 4, 6, 8, 10 and then every 5 levels. In between those you get to choose just one perk at levups. The thing inside the vault is not a perk pack.
---
Sure man. Seeing people in PA being ragdolled by Scorched Beast Queen is fun to watch.
---
#RaiderNation
---
If you know the plan you can get them. Same with fixers, bear arms, secret service armour etc blah
---
Suuuure, I can't imagine anything more sneaky than a walking tank ...
---
/s  
---
Nah .. PA is not meant to be sneaky.   
---
Plus I don't think it would fit anywhere in the FO lore wise ... the only thing the US got from reverse-engineering the chinese stealth armor is the Stealth Boy. It's not even the US's technology to begin with.
---
my advice is whenever you guys play together one of you create a public team for the other two to join.  then you guys can talk on mic and fast travel to each other for free.  the building team is good because it gives you plus intelligence which is more xp   other than that just explore together and have fun.  this game takes many hours to travel and explore everywhere.
---
Deathclaw Island and a lot of server hopping. FUN!
---
As long as you know the plans, they get added to the loot pool (Purv and Ally)
---
There's a spot on the map a small bit west of the S on the compass that's great for building. It's also a spawn point for glowing mirelurks and has a mirelurk queen spawn if you're into farming her drops. If you don't mind having to kill those every time you go back to camp, it's great. Sadly you won't get much foot traffic though, I think most players never even bother to move the map that high up when they're shopping and that's the main reason I left.
---
It's probably a longshot but I figure it can't hurt. Might be worth setting up a tent if you can.
---
Easy-Peasy
---
But don't you start with a pack?  I'm exiting the vault with a single card.
---
Jokes on them I finished all the dailies in ~30 minutes today.
---
I support the Settlers, the entire claim that the Raiders have to justify their actions is, "We were here first, this was all ours originally." I cannot support them though because their actions actively hindered the last stands of the Responders, Brotherhood and Free States. If the raiders had not been up there it is possible the Responders would have gotten their cure produced in time, the Free States would have been able to get their systems up and running and this would have bought time for the Brotherhood to fall back and try and ready a second offensive or at the very least the Free States could have stopped the advance of the scorched.
---
(On a meta level you have to support the raiders going into 79 to get the named plasma rifle, the settlers get nothing special.)
---
perhaps. I haven't really noticed too much of a difference, but I have been on teams most of the past two weeks. I have always used Lone Wanderer, but I am finding that I like some of the other perks as well.  I only really miss the AP regen.
---
I know, wanted a Chinese Stealth Suit Designed PA. There are still communists left in the game after all.
---
Military cap
---
Zerk is a lot more versatile than a bloody as you can run it with full health or low health and still gain your legendary weapon damage boost, anything else after is a bonus. Damage potential is still lower than bloody due to perk restrictions and perk synergy, however it does free up a few perks if done correctly.  Zerk is the real glass cannon of this game.
---
I was disappointed too, it would be nice if they added one that also acts like a display that only the owner could use.
---
The build menu is way too slow and not user friendly enough for fast paced pvp imo, but if they fixed it setting up prefab bases could be cool
---
as someone who uses the extended drum I disagree. it does not block sights this way.
---
This. I’m hoping the rdr2 update will save me, but considering the state of affairs......
---
It caps by weight which usually means the 10 units of whatever. For scrap steel its 20units. And junk is strange.
---
Why not go to the ammo factory and make a whole stock and sell them for 50 caps I do that every so often and its decent pay
---
Mr Fuzzy Mining Helmet
---
Yea that is from level 2 levup. You don't get a pack until lv4.
---
Yeah there are a few things that are just... Backwards lol. Like the gauntlet, if you look closely you'll notice that the saw blade is spinning in the wrong direction lmfao
---
I love how this always happens
---
Real men piss themselves
---
There’s usually one on the tables during the One Violent Night Event.
---
Raiders because I have a heavy build and because raiders are cool
---
Don’t really remember but could it have been a couple loose cards laying on that stand instead of a pack?
---
Because pushy kids are pushy and impatient, they have no time to let me do my thing? I don't have time to deal with hem
---
server stability I'm guessing. same reason we drop little lunch bags instead of the items. they should really just stop being lazy and get better servers but whatever I'm not a game designer
---
10 deathclaws would be a good weekly
---
This is something I already thought of and each blueprint would have a unique name to put it in a certain spot of your blueprint menu. It would be like 2 or 3 buttons presses.
---
2 birds with one stop could just make this whole post pointless lol. I guess it would make sense for the BoS to have access to the technology, supplies, and manpower needed to protect a trading hub for the area. Plus Atlat has a good vantage point. Who knows though. This could end up being a factions social hub at this point, which may do more harm than good.
---
Install your game on an external SSD.
---
Raider
---
The limits are due to server limitations and an old engine full of spaghetti code. I don't think it's possible to perk card those.
---
That’s neat I didn’t know you could get secret service armor too.
---
Bring it on!
---
A weekly? Yes. A daily? Hell no.
---
You guys are cringe.
---
I just use my vendor camp to do the dealing but do you have advice on getting a crap ton of nuclear waste I'm not asking for it to be given just a pointer on where to go
---
Learn something new every day. Seems kind of stupid for a giant machine to cap out at like 5 pounds though. Kind of makes it pointless to grab a bunch of workshops. I thought I was being smart by grabbing a few on my 1st server but it always feels like a bigger resource loss than gain.
---
I learned the hard way with the Ammo Factory back in the Day as a Newbie.
---
Most High level players have zero interest in it.
---
There are much easier ways to get a few thousand rounds of ammunition.
---
Each Gym on a Nuke Run Silo gives you Roughly 110 Lead.A Daily Trip to Lucky Hole Mine usually gives you about 120 [Lead.](https://Lead.So)There alone you have 550 Lead. Whitespring Vendor usually gives another 12 Bulks per day
---
Unfortunately though it is a Magnate for resource deprived lower Levels.They see it is not occupied,and go for it.
---
9 times out of 10 the biggest arsehole on the Server will be watching,and sense an easy kill.
---
Not because they want the Factory.Just the feeling of being able to kill a weaker player.
---
Steer well clear unless you enjoy PvP.
---
My question is what exactly is budget and how is it calculated? Is it in bytes? What makes something require more budget? Is it arbitrary or is there an actual reason why a flamingo has to be used as a measurement device?
---
I’ve heard others say that it’s based on triangle count but that doesn’t really make sense to me as you aren’t storing the triangles in a database and the client can render wayyy more things than the budget limit.
---
I always thought you started with a pack, I mean, when you're exiting the vault you pick up a pack from one of the tables and I thought you started with a few cards, not just the one.
---
Are you saying that until you hit level 4 you just have a single card?
---
This. I have my main where I fuck around but the real fun comes from when my friends aren't on. I have a character that doesn't fast travel and I explore every area with a fine tooth comb before I leave to absorb the lore. Bethesda has a story to tell and while it's not the best, it isn't bad.
---
only upvoted because I love Adam sandler
---
If you wanna watch a good YouTuber with good info about actually playing the game check out Angry Turtle
---
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's the graphical demand of the object or what, but some of the objects are ridiculous in how much of your budget they use.
---
There are several fixed deathclaw spawning locations on the map, where there is always one deathclaw (unless someone killed it). Doesn't really matter if they raised the amount needed. It would be pointless and suck, but would not matter as you can just jump servers and keep killing them. Took me 3mins to kill 3 deathclaws today with loading screens included.
---
This- not an issue for any other BR. Not sure what Beth is doing different, but it ain’t right
---
WELCOME! ​Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50) Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game. Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp. Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money. Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets) Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic) Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup. ​ ​ and have fun. There's no hurry
---
But I have just a single card, not even a couple of other ones, just the single one I choose when I picked my first special.
---
I find opening your pipboy will prevent you from being logged out, but your best choice is to go to your camp and sleep in a bed while you have Happy Camper (A Charisma Perk) active, this will slow down your food and water loss and allow you plenty of time to tend to business.
---
Thank you! Do you know, when the codes reset (it says it's 7pm EST) how long does it normally take before people are able to figure out the new code for the next week? I know there's some delay while the display in the bunker updates...
---
Why in the world is this a task? I haven’t even seen a death claw in like forever they’re very rare where I am (in the middle of a dried up lake)
---
Fine I guess I’ll go to that island
---
I'm just sick of the horrible time gates and RNG of some of the drops I've literally done 200 ranks just doing events trying to get the outfits drops nothing at all. So many useless legendaries I can't scrip because as soon as I log in I'm at me limit with 2 mins 900 and rising,  gold tickets I can't use up and events that are boring the life out of me. But I cant stop cause I need to get those items I ain't got grr.
---
I think he/she just don't know about the fixed spawn spots, and finds it hard to locate them.
---
I don’t want to play with any of you scrubs. I just want my +4 int and higher jumping from SiN
---
Amazing work
---
#???
---
Plasma weapons make it when they goop enemies, i usually mine uranium for it, but WaveMaker and vtech alarm clocks have it, bio scanners have it, high powered magnets have it, and i think some of the board games have some too
---
Does it always land?
---
And you have a whole week, like its not that hard.
---
You get to choose one special stat and perk with each level up (up to level 50, after which you just get perks). Perk card packs are just an bonus. So no, you get a perk with every single level.
---
It would be a neat idea but we need better lighting for the pip boy first. I can't do the green hue covering everything and the lighting in the game is garbage. When the fix the lighting this would be an awesome idea.
---
You forgot to mention how vats turns your snowballs into heat seeking missles. Idk about you but i can melt shit with just a ts ffr, especially myself. Stack up all the heavy gunners and demo expert and an explosive could probably do a ton of damage
---
Elder scrolls online is a game that provides far more base content for the same price as fallout 76, it shows the huge gap in content and quality of the content provided. You can also compare it to Bethesdas own fallout 4 which provides triple the content, if not more with dlc, for the same price (dlc included). 
---
A severe lack of bug testing and quality assurance is constant. There are major issues that basic testing would have fixed. These have ranged from game breaking bugs (no damage bug) to smaller bugs (such as my bungalow I purchased for irl money having no texture on the wall making you fall through it). The game was almost unplayable for around 6 months for most people and they were still charging full price and had to be sued for refunds that they refused to provide.
---
Rather than focus on pure quality assurance and maintenance for the game that they are still unfucking they have decided to shovel more content in to the game in the form of skins and re-packaged cosmetic items that were included in previous games for free; most of which are still broken in some way.
---
They want you to spend £12 for a power armour paint job. 1200 atoms. This comes after removing all but a handful of paints from the game that were included in the previous game, fallout 4. Military paint, winter paint, vault tec paint, the list goes on. Overall just a few power armour paints adds up to almost $40. $40 is the price of both Fallout 76 and the bundle for skyrim (all dlc) + fallout 4 (all dlc). There is a huge loss of quality and content for the amount you are paying.
---
They have added some unique quality expansion items, such as a few never-before-seen power armours. The State trooper power armour that they are releasing is high quality and well made, though it will still likely be over-priced considering their pricing convention for power armour sits at around £12 in the UK currently. Adding this content is great, but there are still areas of the game that simply don't work.
---
One thing they could do is add most of the paints and such from fallout 4 (which they have locked away as we have seen due to hackers accessing the item rooms) as a free update. Make them unlockables rather than selling them for Atoms. Make all the previous games assets challenge rewards *THEN* add all the new stuff to the atom store. that way you'd get all your moneys worth whilst being okay with the new expansions/dlc. 
---
They also need to fuck of with FOMO (fear of missing out). "Hey give us your money now or you might NEVER get that outfit again! Oh you wanted that cool set that the raiders use in game? TOO BAD give us your money or get fucked!"
---
As for CAMP building. They keep adding a lot of broken stuff that just doesn't work (again like my bungalow). If these worked fine it wouldn't be so much of an issue (though again £12+ is still far too much for what you are getting). They need to increase the camp budget, add most of what was in the previous game (and is currently in the game as assets) as challenge rewards, and then focus on selling *NEW* content for atoms.
---
It’s much better. The wastelanders update made it feel like fallout again
---
Interesting I'll check there I usually just find them randomly all over just assumed it was bugged
---
Now that you mention it, this is his storytelling style pretty much lmao
---
Medical goggles
---
Ok yeah I've been trying to make ignition cores for the excavator so I can see how it works out
---
I don't believe the Chinese ever managed to copy the power armor, the limiting factor being the fusion technology powering it - I don't think the tech ever got succesfully reproduced or sold outside of the US.
---
I mean, a prototype stealth field mod for any PA would kinda fit, but I would not expect to be very sneaky past that with PA. Only while standing still ... similar to chameleon mods or the Stealth Boy effect. Probably doable. But the moment you move/shoot, you'd pretty much be seen by anything with more than one eye, from a mile away :D
---
Seems following objectives is hard for people only focused on killing legendaries.  I guess some people cant multitask.
---
Lol sounds less like vault-tec and more like Outer Worlds companies
---
I had responded to someone else in the post 2 weeks ago, but the song JUST finished playing in my game and I have zero mods for it.  So either it's only in some versions (I'm on PC, non-steam version, and American Version, in case there's a difference with what other countries get), or you just somehow miss it EVERY time.
---
Yeah that’s called night.
---
Google image “perk cards on last table before exiting vault 76” 4th picture in my search, looks like a couple loose cards did you spam the pick up button or just click once?
---
Equally true, I suppose we'll have to wait and see at this point, honestly. This has the potential to bring some QoL improvements with it, not just a trading hub but a hub for everything as you mentioned, which is an excellent point and idea.
---
There is an easy way to do it on Xbox on a public server.  Maybe not PS4.  Does not require being friends or getting an invite.  Thought I would have to buy Fallout 1st, but public server works every time unless the game really messes up.  Can even note a player or 2's username, and still get back in that server if you crash.
---
Yeah I know I was replying to the posts question of why people start their own when one is already made.
---
If you have first do that on a private server to collect the mats from the rockhound, every time I run it someone tries to steal the workshop
---
I really wish they implemented a search for where all of your structures can be placed. I know that would drastically increase wait times but tbh it couldn’t be longer than me sitting there connecting to a server then loading in then clicking leave world then joining another server then loading in then clicking leave world until I get one I can have my camp on
---
Its one of my favourites now. I will say though whoever labelled that event as "easy" in the event menu is a sadist. You need to be able to handle swarms of high level charred ghouls to be able to do it.
---
I’m glad to hear that! I hope it’s in the game
---
Sonic says those sexy ass kids on the beach are free and can be turned into husbands

---
Like seriously I know they copy and pasted code from the monster mash thing to save development time but would it have been so hard to copy it from the shop menu or trade menu or whatever??
---
I have a Two Shot +33 VATS gauss shotgun. On the first VATS shot it's pretty tight, but on the followup it's like a volley of pinpoint gauss rifles, even at long distance. I hope to roll an Instigating +33 someday and see how that melts.
---
RAIDERS!!!!
---
Yeah, but chinese are known for their espionage. Hope Bethesda comes up with another unique PA because every single one aside from the Strangler is practically the same. And stealthboys don’t work at all. Not moving at all and you still get detected.
---
So something like normal armor?
---
Yo what chems you on? I want what you're having.
---
You don’t. Give Todd your money or else
---
Thanks for the input, I guess I’ll have to see if my ap regen armour can make up the difference.
---
A bunch of 5-6 settlers walking and moaning about its not how it used to be.
---
Private server + team only + uraninum fever = profit?
---
Technically a legacy weapon is any weapon that's been removed from the loot pool so it can no longer drop or be obtained without trading. Doesn't have to be OP, though generally the ones people trade and dupe will of course be the higher end stuff. I have a Suppressor's The Dragon from way back when they still dropped as legendary. It's a shit weapon but it's still technically a legacy since they don't come in legendary variants anymore.
---
Yeah, I'm noticing more and more Atom shop items and particularly S.C.O.R.E rewards are getting their own line in menus. Makes things very cumbersome and will only get worse as more is added. My fear is that if it works like Fo4, the more stuff that gets added the longer the lag time gets when opening the menu and that kinda breaks building mode for me. Makes it very frustrating.
---
I so wish I could unlearn the gauss pistol plan.
---
Well done.
---
It is an exhilarating experience.
---
I must have done over 100 now.
---
And i still really enjoy them.
---
They are all different,Some are really easy,and some of them are borderline insane.
---
The hardest one i have ever done was actually only yesterday.
---
There must have been 10 Assaultrons spawn in the Control Room one after another,,i was killed 3 times,and they killed all the Launch control Robots by the time i got back, and i am level 380.
---
Then today i do one Nuke [run.It](https://run.It) was like a Sunday strole. Most the Turrets were already out.Only 2 Gutsies spawned in the control room,with 1 Assaultron.
---
You were once in love with it?
---
A responders eye bot that gives you a gift if you're wearing responders gear.
---
Ive decided next caamp in my spot gets nuked.
---
you could just buy the end
---
I’d buy that. My camp needs some classical class.
---
Thanks for the thanks.
---
It was fun in the beginning...
---
Yeah I puppy guard mine and its mainly level tens that i just demolish
---
Same.  Had a public team mate want to trade.  I just didn't want to risk it.  This is why I love player vending.  But event that's not 100% apparently.
---
Just northwest of Red Rocket Mega Truckstop there's a deathclaw spawning near some fossile.
---
The only thing I would consider griefing is purposefully following another player to a different server. Everything else is fair game.
---
&gt;castle hurding
---
Cattle herding?
---
Same
---
Good stuff, and good luck
---
Next week: [Kill every enemy on the map (0/12648503750)]
---
First time through I went Settlers for the quicker access to the Gauss Shotgun. This time around it's Raiders for the Arco Ammo maker.
---
I really don't care about the Factions as favouring one over the other gives no unique rewards. You can vault raid as a Settler and camp as a Raider or vis versa and absolutely noone will care.
---
Im a little over halfways. Not all that much there thats worth the atoms since they suddenly became so scarce for me.
---
Vaccines don't cure diseases, they prevent you from catching them in the first place.
---
The Player Character is incredibly lucky in that they don't catch the disease before becoming inoculated, story-wise.
---
You can't catch the Scorch Plague and then get better. That's not how the disease works. Once you have it, it's a slow burn to becoming a Mindless Puppet Husk.
---
If you could catch the Scorch Plague, it would be the equivalent to old 80's era computer games (Like King's/Space Quest) where that character is just marching towards a guaranteed game over, with nothing to do but start a new game.
---
I go to a train station vendor and go AFK
---
Some people do a private team till they get everyone in that wants to be apart of that team. Then they change it to a public team.
---
A group of two logs on asnd cant join team 1 because teams are limited to 4.
---
How often does that happen? Like that sounds just weird
---
You can’t display it unfortunately. I collect weird shit like that as well, and I have one of those
---
Never knew about this place - got two here and one on the island. Easy peasy
---
Thank you and is the excavator good for harvesting materials
---
I don't care if it costs me 50 caps, I'll get that 5 cap bounty!
---
You can't use VATS against players in NW,  only creatures.
---
Great. I had two spawn at the Whitesprings entrance last night. A mythical and a chameleon. Typical. /shrug
---
Like they have stealth tanks and stealth trucks... You have a stealth mod already for PA chests.
---
If you're pulling the uranium from a mine yes, a random deposit not so much
---
This....definitely this. How much of my late night gaming is filled with "what the f do u mean this needs support? The GROUND IS RIGHT THERE!!!!!"
---
I’ve done it a few times by tricking people to add me or one of my friends or w/e and hopping to them that way
---
Lol I saw it when running from a mirelurk queen when I was a low level
---
I know of the island.  Would you be kind enough to share some if the other fixed locations, or a link to a list.  Thank you in advance.
---
Hey, you'll be great. I met my now husband on Xbox in Assassin's Creed about 9 years ago, been married 6 years now. We lived just over 8000 miles apart &amp; Skype was vital to us. If we can do it, so can you 😍 Congratulations!
---
Does anyone else have issues with the Tesla no longer tagging enemies at the bugged version of line in the sand? After a while I no longer get experience unless I switch to a different weapon.
---
Haha I remember just after beta almost every other invite to trade would see a request for your primary and secondary
---
I know the expectations of what it could be won’t meet reality, but I guess when you’re trapped in the apocalypse it’s just as fun imagining what could be as it is experiencing the actual wasteland around you. Either way they’ve managed to steal 300hrs of my life so far.
---
Alrighty
---
I use mostly my bloodied combat rifle and the main problem is when the enemy is actually behind a wall and vats still shows a 50 to 95%. In that case it fails, but even if the enemy is at 5% if he's at plain sight It lands
---
My big gripe is that whole you better not be over encumbered when the boss dies. I run weight reduction perks when not boss fighting and just suck up the slowness when boss fighting time roles around to pump damage, not being able to really do that during this event means it is probably going to be rough, with how tight the escape timer is to get the bonus loot at the end. 
---
The not being able to go full dakka or get wrecked by the timer feels bad.
---
I share scrapper. Nobody hates that perk.
---
I'm usually drinking beer when I play. After breaking that first seal, could happen anytime 🤷‍♂️
---
I think there are just so many broken, wonky things going on in this game its reached a critical mass that the net amount of bugs is just going to keep growing until it just isn't worth it.  They fix one thing, then something else breaks, and at the same time they add in some new content where something entirely new is broken. And they think or claim they fixed something, then a week later someone points out it's still broken. It's like the team who knew the nuts and bolts of the engine dont work there anymore, so the new people are trying to keep it running with half a poorly written manual and figuring it out as they go. I think what kills this game won't be a new game, but some new bug that finally pushes enough players away it's not fiscally sustainable to keep it running. Just imagine what happens if any of the legendary perks end up getting bugged at some point.
---
Leg bag and a condom cath.
---
Just want to make people aware of a current bug where scraping from the crafting menu ( default G on PC ) will not discover mods.
---
Not for the Ultracite and doesn’t work other than for VATS PvP and when know why people don’t use it for PvP.
---
Then don't do it. Stop having FOMO
---
I miss the atom challenges. That way, I’d be able to actually get Atom Shop stuff on a pretty regular basis without having to pay. 150 atoms every 10 levels or so doesn’t come close to the same amount I was pulling in with the old challenges
---
Worse Is the respawn bug and it’s not close
---
It seems in your score farming, you killed her...
---
Full Bloody build here.
---
Regularly take 2-3 pylons at a time during the event with little trouble.
---
There really is no excuse.
---
Well said. It’s not an amazing story, but it’s interesting, complex and fun to piece together.
---
And some sesonal events like Fasnacht at least.
---
I was actually happy see this one today since its something different. I'm just glad they're simple and not the weird ones from before the season started.
---
Which part of
---
&gt; PA **with the right mods** will make you invincible to **everything but poison**
---
was unclear to you?
---
Just hop the random encounter spawns.  Almost always a legendary
---
Hey. Do you have a source for this?

Got loads of SS armour and Gauss weapons from Fasnacht, generally trash rolls, but still...

These 3 are the easist and fastest. And each has a guaranteed Deathclaw in them, if it has not been killed already.
---
Yea unless they hop servers. Point is, it is risky
---
Shotguns are close range weapons. Why the hell do you need VATS? Just aim.
---
I used Power Armor and a Gatling Laser to easy mode Fallout 4 on Survival.
---
I don’t think you understand that Scorched Beast Queen doesn’t use poison when she comes out with her right claw.
---
No I"m talking about the freeze after every recipe completion, it only lasts a fraction of a second, it's more of a jutter.  PC btw, and it's not my machine having trouble running the game since the rest of the game runs perfectly fine, except for the built in "Todd Moments"
---
Yup.  Just got robbed of 20k Ultracite 45 rounds yesterday because of the exact flaws you describe, and I'm hardly the first person to get scammed this way.  The trading system in its current form is extremely flawed.  It's buggy as hell and sometimes you can't even initiate trades at all -- forcing you and your buyer to server hop just to get it going.  Bethesda must've known that player to player item trading would've become a huge staple in an online game.  World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 14, Guild Wars 2, etc. all have trading and mailing systems.  MMO gamers don't rely on in-game currency -- we rely on in-game items that are eventually heralded as valuable.
---
ALSO, you should be able to give people caps directly.  A few weeks ago, I had a friend mod my Bloodied Radium Rifle, and in order to pay her, I had to buy a boiled water from her.  If a friend needs caps to purchase something, there's no way to just GIVE THEM caps.  Why?   
---
 Why can't we gift currency and other things to our fellow players?  Why can't we implement some sort of mailing system in-game?  Even Animal Crossing has one and this game is basically Animal Crossing with radiation and guns.
---
Thank you so much!  You've helped more than you know.
---
I just want a new tab for atomic shop items
---
Your argument is based on the idea that because some games do this, some games have this, some games charge this, that means Fallout 76 is wrong.
---
That's just coming up with some good sounding but meaningless response.
---
It's like when people accuse them of only doing this for the money. OF COURSE THEY ARE. That's literally the only reason they do this. To make money. 
---
And more so, your responses aren't even your own. You didn't come up with them. you read them elsewhere and parroted them back out. 
---
So why should anyone listen? You aren't even slightly original.
---
You know, people throw the word genius around. But whoever thought to try that first is a truly gifted person.
---
It's HILARIOUSLY fun when Line in the Sand bugs out and all the scorched drop from the sky at the sonic generator ;)
---
I don't quite understand your point as you cant unhatch a chicken. All platforms have/had/will continue to have duped items. It has already ruined the in-game economy so its almost irrelevant to worry about it infiltrating any kind of exchange. Additionally the exchange is just a central location for items and currency in-game already so it doesn't matter if duping leads to another crash as the problem is duping and cheaters which needs to be resolved by Bethesda, not the systems that allow people to buy/sell/trade although if anything having a central resource with transaction history will lead to a very active market with history based pricing that also relies heavily on supply and demand. For example, I sell my serums @ 399cea. I see people selling them for 400-700 lately. If I list all serums on the exchange for 399 and have enough supply, nobody will sell at 400-700 so the price will decrease as people compete with me for those sales. It applies to every item and its a most excellent mechanic. This will also help normalize the prices of rarer items which will ideally lower the value of them and raise the caps value so it would be a huge step in making caps great again (mcga).
---
See that chick mama Murphy for more info. I'm not telling!
---
Yeah, but the Settlers get better stuff in the rep ranks up. The only thing of note that Raiders get is the Ammo Machine and the drug backpack (which is probably still worse than the grocer backpack)
---
So it was the "with the right mods" part you didn't understand, got it.
---
Hold onto them. They are far rarer to get now free, so just keep them until there's either a really good deal on something you want in the shop or save them for the run.
---
You can complete some missions together say you need to get a keys card from some where most of the missions will have one key card for each of you just you only see the one you take the only ones you can't complete together are the ones where, when you try to enter say the overseers house it asked you to go as team or solo. Whoever is team leader in this instance will be there mission only if you go as a team.
---
Yea i do the same gave a bad ass 3 star handmade to some level 75
---
My main is settler but my alt is raider.
---
I’ve only seen that once but man and it happened during Double XP weekend lmao been hitting it every time now!
---
Glad i could help
---
You can’t even use them against creatures in nw I don’t think maybe I’m wrong
---
I suppose it doesn't have to be an alt, but generally, someone fresh out of the Vault is happy to get a leg up, and people on alt accounts already know what they want, so they don't want loot that would better serve a legit new player.
---
That said, if I got a wave and you took off, or a no, it doesn't matter what I'd assume about whether or not it's an alt, I'd still get the idea that you're not interested.
---
In Fallout 4 budget was determined by polygons. I'm no expert but more I believe more complex shapes require more polygons so would take up more of your budget. 
---
Something that uses large, mostly flat surfaces could be comprised of fewer polygons than something smaller and more complex. A circle takes more than a square of the same volume.
---
Take this with a grain of salt as I only have a very basic understanding of these and may be completely wrong on how they function.
---
I had one of the most toxic encounters since launch yesterday. I’m picking my Tatos and some level 18 keeps trying to move in front of me, I ignore him so of course he shoots me and I turn around and appease him with my bloodied lmg which insta kills him. 
---
I knew that wouldn’t be the end of it so I shut all my doors to my house so he couldn’t enter and listened as he tried for about 5 minutes then all of the sudden it happens, he starts spam buying every item on my vendor as fast as he could starting with the 8k caps bloodied guitar sword. I lost about 10k caps from hitting max caps before I could log off. Never thought someone would maliciously buy my items lol.  Lesson learned to always dump my caps if I’m gonna be selling 20k worth of items on my vendors. Checked his profile to see a picture of a girly 13 year old boy with shoulder length hair throwing up a gang sign, exactly what I figured I was dealing with. At least I got a chuckle from the picture.
---
There is just so much stuff about this. I dont think I have even touched on half of the info myself. I feel a lot of the ground water gone is due to the ultracite.
---
Oh damn
---
On my 1st day someone dropped a Marine Treated Wetsuit. Took me a little bit to realize what it actually was. Recently I was hitting up some older areas that seem to have more stimpaks cause I was getting low and I noticed along on the main quest route someone was putting loads of plans in mail boxes. I even added a couple myself that I'd been lugging around. I hope someone else found them, be like hitting the lottery if you're fresh to the game. (I've been buying up cheap plans so I already knew most of them).
---
Op isn't wrong. Seasons in any game suck when it becomes a job instead of playing for actual fun.
---
I think you mean right perks not mods.
---
Only Encrypted even and radiation Rumble really.
---
Players have to get coordinated, ready,and in position.
---
The rest of the events Higher level players will usually get their Stop Watches out and turn up just exactly at the right time to get those T-Bonds. :-)
---
I have the same issue. I always load in to the sound of someone finding a nuke briefcase. Must be nice!
---
That's wholesome
---
Or you can stop spawn camping and they will die in accessible areas.
---
Thers this bug sometimes that say a group is full ahen its rly just 3/4
---
That's was partially the whole point of Legendary Run to keep player retention and to force people to eventually have no choice but to buy Atoms if they want to buy more fancy cosmetics.
---
You can aim. You can’t use vats.
---
uff we should try to pvp our friends when they dont have any caps. new possible exxxpl0it found I guess. anyone tried?
---
The general design of the best non PA armor of the game is straight crap
---
You can use vats against creatures.
---
Online whenever you’re ready
---
There's currently only one thing I want in the shop and its 500.  I have 950, but I also want one of the last things in the legendary run.  I'm lvl 29 because I stopped playing until after it started.  I'm afraid that even while getting all the points I can, except the nw ones because I don't want to, I won't be able to get to the finish in time.
---
Yeahhh I have to admit I’m a bit burned out. I log in for the daily challenges and stay for some events, I’m kind of hooked on the fact that I haven’t missed a single challenge and now I don’t want to mess up my streak. But once I finish them for the day, I become kinda meh about the game. I think it’s because I’ve been playing daily since update 20 haha (which, btw, is made possible only because of COVID).
---
I think at some point this week I’ll return to finish FO4 (I know, I know, profligates like me belong on the cross).
---
Myself. When scraping after crafting I would get a message saying I have unlocked a mod but instead of specifying which it will be blank and when checking the modify menu it will not be discovered. I ran into this bug while crafting and scraping Gatling Guns and going for the Long Barrel. After finally backing out of the crafting menu and going into just the scrap menu the mod discovered normally.
---
When I made a thread about it one person confirmed running into the same bug.
---
Which is dumb in my opinion.  Smart for business, but still.  I'm never spending a penny more on this game.
---
I was surprised when i became  addicted on Sweetwater "Special Brew"
---
I spawned in the same room as someone. He loaded faster then me, got the gun and all I could do was cower behind a counter hoping he didn't see me. He saw me. That was during "Stay in X games till the end" for SCORE points. I love not playing the game! -,-
---
It's always fun to speculate, though, as I'm in the same boat in that regard. I've like the game enough to dump 400+ hours of my life into it, so what's a few more speculating?
---
Just check the tables around watoga, the robots always serving booze to the nonexistent patrons.
---
Usually find some 10 bottles of various beverages there just sitting on the tables.
---
This is why i play 3rd person
---
tell your bank to dispute it
---
I apologize.
---
It would be nice if seasons were something that enriched the game and rewarded you for just playing the game not for forcing you to do certain usually very specific things that take you away from playing it as normal.  Also FOMO is real for a lot of players because we have been conditioned to being completionists, particularly those of us who play the RPGs.  It’s very frustrating when we are unable to achieve something or have access to an item/building/skin because the season ended and it’s exhausting doing it every day and I don’t speak of just Fallout, I’ve experienced this with a ESO as well and it has burnt me out multiple times.
---
Mom. Bathroom. Bathroom! Bathroom!
---
I took the step a month ago and have zero regrets. You die often but that's not big deal in this game, and you become a genocider
---
Sometime in the past few months. There was a patch note on it. So, now it's max-level charred ones. You get max level legendary drops as well. I can level up at least 1-2 times and get a handful of repeatables out of each run. It's a great event and the spawns are spread out enough that anyone should be able to get tags in. There's at least 3 legendaries, sometimes more.
---
On my way! Jumping to your server.
---
There’s no need to use uncivil language. 
---
Also, there are other spots than that one that have that raised area.
---
Solid state drives. That is what is causing delay. People with those load first. But yes needs to be addressed.
---
Sorry to hear about that but yeah I 100% agree with the suggestions of giving caps to people instead of buying an item and mailboxes would be nice too
---
I do like having events and seasons, just change the reward structure so it’s pretty reasonable to complete it without grinding every day and for those who do grind daily just give extra loot for each subsequent “level” completed after the final level of the season/event.  Everyone would win.
---
yeah i definetly gained a ton of score points from the event over double xp weekend
---
The gatling gun has a bug of the last patch where "phantom mods" are unlocked. Bethesda added fake crafteable objects to the qeapon. You just happened to hit a fake one rather than a real one I think. 
---
Shouldn't be a difference with the G option vs scrap menu.
---
Sounded like you wasted a perfectly good chance to test that quad tezzler. In 30 min you shoulda been able to shoot every nook and cranny of that base and find him.
---
I have a funny screenshot, with a NPC drinking coffee in hazmat suit in a middle of nuclear zone
---
I have two issues with the current trading system: the buggy trade invite and the ability to see the other's inventory. The ability to view another's inventory invites harrassment for desired items, especially highly-sought weapons. Fortunately, the block feature allows people to shut this down, but we shouldn't have the transparency creating these type of situations to begin with.
---
Wow, level 30 legendary. Bet that really set you back huh?
---
I love when my friend is talking about the loot he found and about how many people are there while im just like " I haven't loaded in yet"
---
I stock up items for the day that i can spare a vending machine and fill it with joke items. Always love this in camps.
---
Mhm after posting this i suddenly rembered it is a sheeee. I guess i was referring to her brother... PURVEYOR MURG, who is a he.
---
It would be cool to have your PA be able to stay at your camp for all to see, but if you're like me, and only use PA for certain events, it would be a real pain to fast travel back to your PA and THEN to the event.
---
But yeah, since PA has no fall damage, I just imagine it gets dropped from orbit with the heavy guns stashed in it (I switch out Bear Arms and every other carry weight perk in strength for three maxed heavy gunner cards)
---
The Raiders have better stuff.
---
If only my real job only required 1-2 hours or less of my time each day.
---
Cool. So ive seen alot of players with Beckett at their camp. I havent gotten to meeting him yet, but is one ally better than another?
---
Probably the flamingos
---
Lvl 95 with no legendary weapon? What was he doing the entire game?
---
Alright I’ll be hopping on in just a minute
---
I can relate 100%. Finally got together this past weekend after 5 months apart (we are both in the US, but 2k miles apart). FO76 is our main social time.
---
Same, from weapon retrievals and the purveyor, all I got was the pistol, and it’s not even that good, quite disappointing
---
It is a good event.
---
But insanely hard if there is only 2 of you.
---
I just go for the bare minimum ore if there is just 2 of [us.You](https://us.You) still get 3 T-Bonds
---
There is no way 2 of you, can keep any of the scavengers alive if you try and collect all the Ore.Speaking from experience.
---
Although i have been told it can be done if you drop a power Armour frame in the Dooor way blocking access to one Scavenger from the Ghouls.
---
Going to try this out soon.
---
Oh neat
---
I’m not trying to use vats, it doesn’t aim down sights.
---
just keep making a trail of requesting help and a refund first :D
---
if i can find proof of other people having this issue, i can take it to my states consumer affairs commission as if 'they know, or should have known, they would not be able to supply the products or services within the timeframe indicated or if no timeframe was provided, within a reasonable time.'
---
And it only happens towards the beginning of the match, not in the middle or end
---
Yeah sometimes I’ll be trading with people and they’ll throw offers at me for my BE shotgun and TSE Gatling gun, when the trade is me buying the persons gun with caps. Not being able to see their inventory would be a lot better
---
And I’m in third person, if that helps
---
Rosalyn's Memorial has one, and the cave Senator Blackwell hid in, has 2
---
It's FO4 modded into multiplayer.
---
The old system didn't have any barter option, it was always buy/sell with NPC's for caps &amp; they were too lazy &amp; shortsighted to add it in.
---
Haha sick reference
---
Two hours of grinding isn't fun. If you don't like complaints about it don't read them and feel required to comment.
---
Scrip is scrip, 3* lvl 30 is 40 just like a lvl 50. My point remains the same, stupid bug with an easy as hell fix.
---
So I've listed my personal experiences with the game. Some of the things I've listed are big problems that have a lot of coverage. Your response is just to stick your fingers in your ears and go "Reeeeee you're lying and a sheep!".
---
You can make money FAIRLY. It is fair to make comparisons between two or more games in the same genre that are competing for business. It is fair to talk about negative business practices that impact and negatively hurt a game. If you don't and go "just focus on the good!" you will just get steamrolled.
---
By your argument: Drug companies that lie about harmful content and are called out are fine just because "they're trying to make money and that's obviously what they want/need." 
---
By your argument: Game studious can re-sell games for triple the price whilst cutting assets to sell as microtransactions.
---
By your argument: Any person that shares a common complaint about something isn't original and is clearly faking it/doing it for drama.
---
You develop via criticism. You point out shitty practices and replace them with better ones. You get nowhere by sticking your fingers in your ears and calling people with criticism liars or fake.
---
Well that sucks, but at least I can stop trying to find one. Thanks for the info.
---
User name checks out.
---
&gt;bouillon
---
You can buy things with soup?
---
Make a fresh character, run out of vault to Wayward, mug the raider, do dialogue, go to overseers camp and do the crafting quest. Challenge done in around 7-8mins. Delete the character. Same goes for level up in NW challenge. But you just afk/hide in a bush for one game.
---
Damn, sucked that didn't work. I appreciate you trying! &lt;3
---
I finally did my last trade for my white whale scout armor with -50 FD, with two I jump from everything. I have spent the last day jumping off everything. It cost a BE25 Fixer but it was worth it while I blow module after module trying to get the right SS armor.
---
So no more power armor for me.
---
The Dark Zone is probably the worst PvP experience I've ever had in a video game. It's concept is interesting, and Massive thought the idea would be "betray your newly made friends to steal their gear."
---
When in reality no one cares about the gear, they simply shoot you as soon as you turn your back. If you're a non hostile player you'll die 99% of the time since they get to attack first. And even if you do kill them they'll just be right back. 
---
But on the flip side, the PvP game modes in Division 1 were some of the most fun PvP I had (until Massive nerfed everything that wasn't full gun DPS but whatever) because in those modes everyone's gear was maxed out, you were put in team automatically. And everyone was there to PvP. None of that "4 man squad ganking a solo player 10 times in a row for no reason"
---
Atoms were always limited. The difference now is simply the supply is smaller for the same timeframe.
---
Not counting the non-weekly/dailies, in a ten week period, you can get 2000, or about 200 per week.  It used to be about 800 per week, IIRC. Ike 70 per day from the dailies and about 300 from the weeklies. 
---
It was *always* limited.  It’s just that the flow was cut to about 1/4.
---
&gt; don't like complaints about it don't read them and feel required to comment
---
You should try taking your own advice lol.
---
I had that can not run bug for the first time today at a Nuke Event.
---
Had to get out of my power Armour then back in again quickly..
---
They should take a note from warframe's Nightwave and put most of the score into weeklies and put less emphasis on dailies.  Logging in literally every day is a pain.  If I could knock out more challenges in one or two or three days that would be fantastic.
---
It's not the best tec, it's Vault-tec.
---
you seem to be under the impression that the amount of xp needed to level goes up every time you level.  according to the wiki, after level 100 it takes the same 15.8k xp to level up per level, all the way to level 1000. so you're not having to gain a larger amount of xp per level up than anyone else, after level 100. in other words, your suggestion is actually asking them to make you gain MORE xp than is needed for a level up, this making progressing harder for high levels.
---
So it's not spawn camping, it's just coincidence that all 3 legendary MMs didn't even make it off their spawn point...err, OK. And if you were on the other side of the event how did you know all 3 died on that one spot and sank? 
---
If your high enough level to be 1 shotting MMs then you don't need their rewards as they max at L40 - the reason the Mine Moler event lost many fans was the low level legendary rewards. 
---
The main appeal to high level players should be the Treasury Notes as its a Public Event not mediocre drops. 
---
And if you feel the need to drop insults then maybe you knew I was right.
---
Bloody Unarmed Unyielding build. Level 256 currently.
---
Been playing off and on since release with 400+ hours of playtime.
---
Have been crippled maybe 5 or 6 times in the entirety of that time. All of which were gone immediately with a simple stimpak use.
---
What do you recommend? Cause the sliders are just terrible.
---
Do you usually run with the same crew? I had a problem with one of my friends ran with several of his friends, who all had Strangler Heart PA and Legacy weapons. The game would freeze up for like 30 seconds, and then the event was over, and I'd never get a shot. Other than that, yeah, XBox one S is trash.
---
With 950 Atoms your not going to get very far anyway buying ranks. Six spaces on the board for 900 Atoms. If you're that far behind maybe just buy what you want if it's going off sale soon?
---
You are reading/understanding the wiki wrong, each level increases the amount of xp needed (up to level 1000).
---
My vendor room is only lit with the stars wallpaper, was hoping to use them on the ceiling to make them look like more stars.
---
That's what I imagine.
---
I assume it would be near impossible to implement, though, so at least we can pretend.
---
There *is* a stealth boy mod for PA.
---
But like many other respondents I think you're asking for some kind of uber-suit that just makes things too easy. And it's already easy enough.
---
Too bad that isn't tolerated on their own website.  It all gets deleted and the users who have been there for years banned.  They don't want new potential customers seeing what a broken mess with no content the game is, so they hide criticism instead of fixing anything.  The same few schills there report everything continually.  It's pretty pathetic...
---
The only people I've seen that are toxic are the guns wjth glitched guns that will insta-kill any enemy before anyone can even get a shot off. Thus ruining other people from getting loot from the high level boss enemies.
---
I did once encounter a guy with a glitched gun that did so much damage it instantly killed the Scorchbeast Queen, and when everyone got their rewards he was able to kill everyone in the area with it and stole all their flux.
---
Yeah they are very dim so it shouldn't add much light at all. I did that on my last base lol
---
Thanks for this!
---
It’s a daily. Everyone knows that’s where to find ghouls. DeathClaw daily today. Have you been to DeathClaw island today? same way. Everyone knows. Gonna have to continuously hop
---
Run that fucker until the airport for a chance at getting a fireman’s uni and then delete.
---
That’s definitely not the case my friend. I have a second account that’s level 120 and levels much faster than my main at level 297.
---
It took so much server hopping as all these locations were all wiped clean! I thought a new person there used to force a respawn... Nope not anymore....
---
I agree that it’s tedious.  Takes me a while to level up each day.  I end up running out of time
---
I'll be honest, I googled it as soon as I saw it in the dailies. I tried Deathclaw Island and someone beat me to it. I tried Hopewell Cave and still needed two more. Worked out great!
---
Might have to say goodbye to one of my mules or my melee character. Noooo not the mule. Bye bye melee then.
---
C-PTSD is Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It shares similarities with PTSD but has more symptoms and affects more areas. I don't want to compare it as worse because everyone experiences things differently. 
---
PTSD usually encompasses a singular traumatic event such as witnessing death or a natural disaster. C-PTSD is long lasting trauma, so like repetitive childhood abuse.
---
Damn and I can't even get a text back. Congrats!
---
no I'm not. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Level it tells you right there how much xp is needed to gain the next level. from level 100 to 1000 each level up takes 15.8k xp, regardless of your level 100 or level 999.
---
I am a Bloodied build.
---
I also was becoming insanely over-cumbered in my ultracite Power Armour with calibrated Shocks.
---
Then i noticed the problem,my Grocers Back Pack i bought with my Gold Bullion was my problem.
---
When i was jumping in to Power Armour it stopped working.Leaving me crawling.
---
I had to put 3 points back in to Thru-Hiker whilst in power armour for Food Carry etc.
---
Then when out of power armour i could lose those 3 points again and use them on another perk.
---
Isn't the VATS magic weapons only possible outside of PA? At least the guns that don't have 200+ Fire rate. Since it's something to do with the armor effects as well. OP has his character in PA in the screenshots
---
No because of the history of bugs that occur to your camp when you do that.
---
Not to mention the nw challenge, but that’s a different conversation lol.
---
You mean like Perfectly rolled Legendary Secret Service Armor?  You practically a walking tank already with that armor and making sneak work with PA without legendary effects is uncalled for?
---
Ah, yeah that's what I was thinking but wasnt sure. Thanks for letting me know!
---
What transgressions have they committed for this attack?
---
If everyone used a tesla rifle we would all get a tag and they would still die instantly
---
Gramps wont let me turn the quest into him anymore. Now I'm just stuck carrying around a weapon case.
---
I'm not even terribly high level, but I got lazy and created a new character and ran his ass across the Forest until I levelled up. I will do this again and again.
---
I kind of got attached to the idea of a new character but not til I'm done with TLR.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Level
---
take it up with the wiki, that's what they say.
---
Because I have functioning eyes and can see out of the 2 I tagged none of the other remains had legendary items throughout the entire event, which means they're in the ground where they got bodyblocked into by everybody else. 
---
Stupid bug simple fix.
---
Shotguns in Vats will do that. If you roll a hit, all pellets will hit. If you roll a miss, all pellets will miss. You can use a crit and watch as the Gauss Shotgun laser beams an enemy from a quarter mile.
---
In the last Datamine was found the exhibitor of power armor that had Fallout 4, it may come soon or next season
---
Dude no :) Try leveling a level 800 and a level 100 and see the difference. It is huge. 15.8k xp is a tiny tiny amount. I can do the 10k weekly score challenge in 15mins or so, but it takes me more than an hour to level up with my current main who is ~600lv.
---
You're one of those people that takes Everything literally aren't you? Yeah it was Always limited, but it didn't seem so limited before Because it was attainable daily and we got a lot more.
---
Can we replace Banana for scale with Flamingo for scale?
---
No worries! And if you're curious BPD is Borderline Personality Disorder. Which is kinda like a buy 1 get 20 deal. I'm very open about mental health nowadays so you're more than welcome to ask away haha
---
Run outside. Jump in pool. Piss. Jump out of pool. Back to Appalachia.
---
Hrm. Then how did they add the infinite junk box if such limitations exist?
---
I know it's not that many atoms.  I am planning on getting  more, plus you get some from the rum itself.  I did the math and it seems like I'll be able to make it, but idk.
---
1. If you're going to do a specific build, like bloodied, wait until you're level 50. Do not mess with early level legendaries. You'll end up feeling like you wasted your time with them.
---
2. RifleGaming has some build guides, that are quite fun. There's also tips and tricks, but the best are his "Nuking Experiments". 
---
3. When I had a sniper build, I used VATS most of the time, and always had a quick fire weapon (i.e. handmade or fixer) if I got mobbed. That is, until I learned about Escape Artist; an agility perk, it really is OP for sneak builds (snipers/commandos)
---
Sorry to anyone who read this before I edited my mistake.
---
You and me both. They already got my initial purchase, that's the Only money they're getting from me on it.
---
You don't see the sleeping bag unless you're in build mode and it's on the floor so you don't get the repair prompt just walking around. I've never had issues with it and my camp is visited by dozens of people a day.
---
According to the wiki that [got changed last year](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Government_aid_drop).
---
&gt;During January of 2019, the drop was locked with a level zero lock, and if anyone other than the requester took items from the supply drop they would become wanted, with a 5 cap bounty for each item taken. As of the 2/19/2019 Fallout 76 patch 1.0.6.0, supply drops cannot be accessed in any way by any character other than the player that requested it.
---
I'm just telling you what the wiki says. if it's wrong, that's on them. it's always been right in my experience.
---
I choose Dumpster.
---
I generally give free stuff away to new players that I myself have no use for or has been taking up space in my Stash Box for far too long. While being generous I'd part of it it's not the main reason why I give this stuff away.
---
I know that.  But how does that relate to this?  Obviously for people who are willing to cough up hundreds of dollars, everything is fine and dandy, but for the rest of us...
---
Every single time. I have a nice cozy setup on Twin Lakes, with a small contemporary house, water farm with an upper walkway for easy collecting and a Red Rocket garage for my vendors. I dig it and it's a nice tranquil spot. Every time it can't be placed I go check out what someone else did in the area and it's almost always a huge floating square with no windows and 1000 water purifiers placed haphazardly in the lake. Tsk tsk, no imagination.
---
There is one that spawns just north of Westtek
---
no I want the plans
---
Respawn bug?
---
You're looking at the chart, which is inaccurate, but not the formula right below it. The wiki's information on 76 is incredibly spotty, so it's easy to believe someone screwed up when making that chart.
---
Man I found a suit if power armor for the first time the other day in NE and was all happy thinking maybe I'll win this match for once.
---
First player I came across shot me once with a pistol and the entire dam suit started flying off in pieces. 
---
2 shots and I was dead. Dozen shots I fired off did nothing at all. The lag makes it absolutely impossible for me to kill anyone in that mode.
---
Every single one of my shots miss even at point blank range, while all of theirs land perfectly no matter how fast I'm moving or what cover I have.
---
edited the last comment for bit more info
---
Except that PA comes with extra, unlisted, damage and radiation resistance. And there's no lore at all to go with this new-and-improved suit. Just accept that PA is clunky and loud and build accordingly.
---
I did it on Radiation Rumble
---
Well you can support both sides post story for their items, and the wise choice is to play both sides up to the raid for the rep and the items, but aside from that you are forgetting the raiders get the best recipe, the pepperoni roll (it is sold by the one female merchant over by the musical instruments in crater).
---
I was actually curious about that when I first asked about CPTSD but I didnt wanna bother you too much so I just looked it up 😂
---
Yeah that’s just me losing weight. Much easier than exercise. Your’re welcome for the legendary shovel I can’t sell because I’ve gotten my limit from the machine and the 20 mini nukes I accidentally picked up over the week that I can’t use because no one uses a fat man. Also the purified water I dropped because I make that in bulk and it’s one of the first things to go if I need to fast travel
---
Its not as simple as that though because many of us want some of the latter items on the pass. Im calling out a clear issue with the game tbf
---
It’s so neat how you ignored the part *right after that*:
---
**The number of points to earn in level n in order to progress to the next are:**
---
ΔXPn=160⋅(n−1)+200.
---
It takes more XP to level up from 200 to 201 than it does to level up from 300 to 301. 
---
Your failure to properly read the wiki and it’s formula doesn’t change the reality.
---
I'm pretty sure they just spin a wheel and throw darts at it.
---
I supposedly have 384 damage resistance.
---
Does this mean my Armour will not function right ?
---
Cheers.
---
Aye. i always feel sorry for things when i cripple them. 
---
Most of them just sit/lie there and do just look at you. T\_T I'M SORRY OKAY!
---
The flow of atoms now is 0.  You can't get atoms from challenges anymore.  I certainly haven't done all of mine yet, but when I have, I can't get more except maybe through future legendary runs.
---
Yes that's how it works.
---
Damage reduction from armor is a function of the value of armor vs the value of damage taken, it takes more armor to reduce a huge hit than a small one, so gaining more armor is most effective against very high damage attacks, and once you go over a certain threshold the amount of reduction you get for your value falls off a cliff hard.
---
To perspective things, for a 100 damage hit you get these damage values against certain armor thresholds
---
50 armor - 64 damage
---
100 - 50
---
200 - 39
---
300 - 33
---
400 - 30
---
500 - 28
---
1000 - 22
---
As you gain armor, you get less and less difference compared to before, going from 0 to 100 armor is about as significant as going from 100 to 700
---
It's when you start going over a 3:1 ratio that the effect really starts killing your benefit from pushing armor values higher, so with \~97% of all enemies dealing 100 damage or less (A level 80 scorchbeast deals 95 with it's strongest attack) going much over 300 isn't all that useful compared to the other things you could be doing instead. Furthermore, all attacks that deal more than 100 damage are melee attacks from rare and powerful monsters, with only two non melee hits going over this threshold. Meaning the blocker perk by itself cutting melee damage by 45% before your armor is calculated makes the most powerful attack in the game only deal 137.5 damage (glowing super mutant behemoth 250 damage heavy melee) So going much over 400 is not necessary with one perk.
---
Vanguard and bolstering are great at low levels where they can push your armor up to the 300 threshold far sooner than you can do any other way, but when you are high level, and have good base armor that already gets to that point the effects are so much less valuable you are better off running almost anything else.
---
A set that is better than full vanguard armor in almost every single situation is 1 of each: ghoul slayer, mutant slayer, hunter, exterminator, troubleshooter. As not only do you get a straight 15% reduction to almost every enemy, but you also get that 15% against enemies that ignore or otherwise don't care about armor (col G, M-king, Assaultrons, ect), AND to top it off the 15% reduces damage before your armor is taken into effect, meaning you effectively get an 18% boost to your armor, meaning for every 200 armor it is like also having an extra vanguard effect at the same time, but no matter what your health is.
---
Technically it could be feasible but it would have to be very well explained for anyone to believe it and it would have to be more than just a hey I see you nick kind of thing.
---
It's fine. Higher level players get more value out of the level-up challenge when you factor in how often they'll complete the XP repeatable. And leveling up a lower-level alt is always there as the quick and dirty solution for someone who doesn't have the time.
---
I didn't see it as a "real money store."  Yeah I couldn't buy everything, but now I can't buy anything.
---
Haha no worries 😊 I feel like talking about it helps me, so I'm just open about it! We'll see you in Appalachia ;)
---
Ad victoriam!
---
Yep me too. 3500 hours and I just learn this. When I did this quest I only wore the outfit when I had to, then ditched it. Had no idea.
---
No, it’s not zero. You get Atoms from The Legendary Run. 
---
You get Atoms ***indirectly*** from Challenges.
---
So you’re telling me to not expect any new PA that isn’t just a reskin with some slight DR changes. Got it. I guess we shouldn’t expect much from Bethesda. This game is just a cash grab after all.
---
Interesting! Thanks! Could you pm me information about the thing you mentioned about the safes or a YT link?
---
It's not infinite. There is a very finite types of junk, which is what matters. 100 of the same item and 100 different items require a very different amount of processing.
---
🙋‍♂️
---
I wanted the mini red rocket garage, that's 500 Atoms. I had the Atoms saved up, and was in position to get those back from the board rather quickly (over a few days) so I bought it. I'm definitely not spending the rest though until I Really need to.
---
New measurement: flamingos for scale
---
Yes.  Also, just get the bear arms perk.  Then you can carry all the Fatmans (Fatmen?) you want
---
but then you make 4 alt mules and use your private server to move stuff to them. 
---
I have an alt for ammo, another for weapons and armour and another for drugs. And the 5th will be whatever.
---
Bloodied Heavy. I just bought a really good Gatling gun and decided to roll with it. Heavy build was not what I was going for but hey take what you can get. For a game that’s end game is just grind and rgn there’s not much else I can do about it.
---
Also because bloodied builds are pretty much the meta because Bethesda seems to favor them
---
Paragraphs dude!
---
It really helps though....
---
I'll concede i have no idea what that formula means lol, I'm just reading the chart which seems to say something else entirely.
---
I didn’t spend Atoms every day, so I didn’t need to earn them every day. 
---
While I have always been a proponent for increasing the amount of Atoms earned from The Legendary Run and future seasons, that’s a separate issue. 
---
If you want to have a valid discussion, then let’s use facts and not emotions.
---
Third person won't aim down sights for guns that don't have scopes.
---
Yeah to many people it's just spend a bunch of real money, but I could still buy stuff there.  Now I cant.
---
Lol I just avoid NW altogether
---
I got burned-out doing the seasonal quest crap in Destiny 2. In that game I didn’t even bother doing the previous two seasons, and am not doing the triumph book. 
---
Now it’s the same grind here in FO76.  I’m doing it, and am around level 58.  But I’m bored by it. The only reason I’m still doing it is because most of the challenges are easy and don’t take too much time.
---
Also, like i told you earlier you just misunderstand the xp table. The number on the table is the amount of xp needed for next level. They just don't list every single level between lv100 and lv1000, and it can confuse people. Only after level 1000 it is the same amount until lv50000. So to level from 100 to 101 it takes 15880xp, while leveling from 1000 to 1001 it takes 159880xp.
---
The chart ***is*** saying that, exactly. The fact that levels 101-999 aren’t displayed doesn’t imply that each of those levels takes the same XP to achieve.
---
Nick Valentine was a pre-war detective who had his brain scanned by the Institute before the bombs fell. Centuries later when they were developing synths, they used the brain data they collected on Nick Valentine and stuck it inside of a synth, and that's the guy we know from Fallout 4. 
---
There's a nonzero chance the original Nick Valentine survived the war, and they *could* contrive a reason for him coming to Appalachia 26 years later if they really wanted to. I think most people would be okay with that if it were written well. But he'd be a pretty different person from the Nick Valentine we know.
---
Don’t believe everything you see online. I know the wiki is useful. However I’ve had the game since the beta. I’ve got three accounts level 298,120,87. It takes 5-6 runs of west tek to level my 298 and only 2-3 for my 87.
---
Assuming they continue to have them as rewards and there are constant legendary runs.
---
100%.
---
What game gives out its skins and cosmetics etc free? Geez go play ESO for five seconds, then come back and tell me how totally reasonably F76 is for pricing and also the atoms it's still giving for base achievements.
---
ESO will want 5000 crowns ($50) for ONE OUTFIT STYLE. It's disgusting.
---
I second this. The combo looks great.
---
this sucks. i got my mom into playing f76 with me and both of us have had a 200 plus level person just walk up to us, drop like 4 bags and walk away. we never asked, figured we'd struggle and fight and two really nice players helped us out. i got bunch of ammo and like 30 stims, mom got a weapon ammo and i think like 20 stims. 
---
we play on xbox.
---
What do you play on? I’m on PS4 and I can place some at your camp if you’d like
---
Overwatch does.  I love its model
---
Preach. If I want to play a pvp game ill play a good one😂
---
I’m just ahead of Zorbo now woo
---
Raider because why would you want to be a victim.
---
 The gauss shotgun YES is explosive. The problem is that along with demolition it kills me too many times. I have a character with a very high defensive level and I practically never die ...... Until I started using the gauss shotgun and kill myself.
---
Sometimes you get lucky (good or bad,  luck is luck) and there are three.
---
Full health junkies with max first aid and born surviver. I literally just stop where I am and go take a piss
---
Boom, dead.
---
Radiation rumble is a fun experience if I just want to rack up kills.
---
Alternatively I just pull out my explosive combat shotgun and cripple everything.
---
It’s nice to be able to carry 4-5 shotguns with each weighing 2 or less pounds thanks to that perk too.
---
I have a bloody pump shotgun.
---
An quad pump shotgun.  (I have a combat one too but prefer the pump action)
---
An explosive combat shotgun.
---
And an instigating shotgun with the magic effect for nuke zones when I’m out of my normal armour.
---
It's amazing how little Bethesda actually cares. How on gods green flat earth do you put something in a game, and not take the 2 seconds to test it. What a bunch of incompetent useless idiots the whole lot of them. Todd must really not care and his river of useless shit trickles down onto everyone else. This doesn't even make sense.
---
I have some placed, but I still want the plans.
---
I agree with you. But i also think how you approach the season makes a difference. I try and make completing the dailies and weeklies part of what I’m just doing in game. The things like eat or craft I just get out of the way right off.
---
That said, I also think they need to get really inventive on the challenges. Come up with some crazy fun things.
---
I have newbies join my team demanding i come and give them bullets
---
Perhaps your mistake was trying to force other random players to play to your reward aim in an event where killing = xp = legendary run rank.
---
I've all but given up with event as I find too often noone wants to do the ore runs they only want those xp points and legendry kills - and I can only run and collect so fast so getting close to max rewards is difficult as the Settlers seem to die as soon as I turn my back regardless of the number of gunners.
---
Not really the Southern, but Eastern edge .)
---
Just go into a private server and everything is there and you never have to worry about someone beating you to it.
---
Had a teammate bug me for all of my 2mm, repeatedly. It took a block to get him to stop.
---
They can still slip through eventually with that trick but but it gives you more time to down them before they make a mad dash for the nearest scavenger. 
---
My issue is that I have far too much gear and am always over encumbered in power armor or the stealth suit so have to focus on killing the waves and hope someone else runs the ore.
---
Kills me tho when I got my side on lockdown and with 4 people on the other side I figure they'll have that side secured and can just focus on my side only to immediately see scavengers dropping like flies.
---
&gt;  .&lt;
---
/r/kidsarefuckingevil
---
Right now - most people are trying to farm the event for the XP to rank up score opposed to the tiny chance of the rewards you can get from the event.
---
Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 do a good job explaining what T-60 is. T-60 is just an upgrade for the T-45 (such as the T-45a,b,c,d names) that was so different that it got its own name. T-60 was designed like an upgrade package for the aging T-45, to bring them up to the standard that T-51 had set, but at a much lower cost per unit. 
---
X-01 is explicitly stated as a prototype for a revolutionary new approach to Power Armor, designed by Government Skunkworks. X-01 was nearing completion when the Great War happened. X-01 schematics stayed with the government remnants and provided the base for the Enclave’s Advanced Power Armor.
---
I’ve only found like 2 people who wanted to play this cooperatively. So I’m down. On steam “lazershoes”
---
Wish there was at least one group that wasn't hostile, maybe with a quest line that lets you learn why the others have gone mad. 
---
Why bother having all the moth man camp and appeal if you can't workship with your bothers and sisters?
---
If you have a sub you don't have to jump servers.everything is there for you.all enemies.all legendaries.all events.plus the game runs smooth.
---
My favorite is when you log in and your camp is gone &amp; has been replaced with nothing but a noob’s Crane Sign
---
The funny thing is..I thought to myself “fuck maybe I should hold on to this...” but it was followed up with “but who the fuck do you know here you lone wonderer?”
---
Seems to work for overwatch.  I think making a great game that attracts a lot of people in which some will buy stuff is a better business model.
---
This is what I usually do if I still want to run my vending or farm a WS.
---
Yes the dangers of being afk after minimal now since they removed slap damage last year. Players used to be able to slap or shoot you even with pacifist on and do very little and annoying damage that could still eventually kill you or prevent you from FT. People would also slap you to see if you have AOE mutations that trigger pvp even if you had pacifist on. So glad they fixed this. They can still trigger pvp on AOE mutations if you have pacifist OFF, however.
---
Unfortunately, I’m on xbox, but I’d there any way to do cross platform
---
Absolutely, I've sacrificed my build for maximum INT &amp; XP boosts of what's achievable &amp; leaving bobbleheads, magazines etc to double xp.
---
Max level Super mutants yield me 603xp each.
---
It's not inaccurate, but confusing and made kinda wierd :) People don't understand that the number on the table represents the xp needed to go up to next level. So to level from 100 to 101 it takes 15880xp, while leveling from 1000 to 1001 it takes 159880xp. It just would not make sense to list every single level in between.
---
Nurse....he's out of bed again...
---
Yeah. There's usually between 4 and 8 total deathclaws that will spawn depending on number of players at event. 
---
Go Tesla and just get those tags in.
---
I'm new to the game only level 29 and I can't stand when new players do this shit. If a high level player gave me anything it gamer courtesy to at least write a quick thank you message. Fucking webs. Good on you OP for being a bro.
---
lol logical answer being downvoted.
---
I like taking pictures of Meg at the Crater or Paige in Foundation. I have them both in multiple poses.
---
I take upward facing shots while hiding in Ward's porta shitter....
---
Abandoned waste dump, eastern edge of the map.  Not the best place to go if you are a lower level but easy deathclaws for when it turns into 50 a day LMAO.
---
Have you considered a different approach? Don't make the SCORE the whole focus of playing the game, play it how you normally would, but just be aware that you need to find bubble gum, or a bobblehead or whatever. I logged in this afternoon and knocked out the challenges within an hour, and I did events that I'd normally do, went to places I'd normally go to. 
---
Ultimately, you're the steward of your own enjoyment and your experience with this is what you make it. Besides, you can double some of these challenges up and knock them out together, like capture a worksshop, build things at a workshop - kill X#s of creature, and kill a legendary.  Complete events, when you've claimed a workshop those workshop events count toward that, all of the little events on the map count toward that, if you can't find an event, go start Ridin' Shotgun it counts as an event. 
---
Just take a look at your challenges and see how you can combine them to get them done quicker, or better still, DON'T DO THEM if you don't want to fool with it. It's just a bunch of cosmetic stuff that isn't going to make a huge difference overall aside from having access to it so you can maybe work it into your camp, or run around looking like a bush. 
---
What I did today: 
---
 Kill a Deathclaw, there's always a deathclaw at the Thunder Mountain Substation outside of Watoga, plus there's a crater next to the Monorail Elevator where there are sometimes spawns. I got lucky there and the substation twice because I came back in about 10 minutes and it spawned again. I tried DC Island, but someone put a camp there and bugged the spawn point.
---
Eat Pre-War Food - I had Halloween Candy from Monster Mash in my camp, ate some of that, challenge complete.
---
Kill Legendary - Go to Forward Point Delta in the Cranberry bog,  usually some legendaries out there, scorchbeasts, ghouls, or super mutats in the Overgrown Sundew Grove, plus you can pick all of the ultracite ore to cause more scorched to spawn each time you pick it to level up if you need to do that there. I had a Foundation quest open to get Ward's osmosis kit, and one of those raiders was a legendary, but I finished that challenge with 2 of the 5 Scorchbeasts I killed by the fissure sites. If I wouldn't have found the legendaries, I was going to start Ridin' Shotgun, at least 1 legendary and it counts as an event. This area also levelled me up, granted I was already pretty close to doing that. 
---
The Nuclear Hide 'n Seek challenge was a breeze, throw down a camp, you're done. But I hung around and played until I was in the last 6 people until a scorpion killed me. 
---
It's really what you make it. I'm only trying to get the Jangles Backpack, the rest of the stuff is just a bonus. But, I'll probably finish it anway.
---
I run a speedy stealthed bloody build. Usually sneak about 1 shotting everything till I get impatient then proceed to jet back and forth between mobs hoping to outrun their bullets. 
---
Got all the sprint and jump perks so I'm like a tanzanian devil zipping back and forth between targets one shotting everything. 
---
Till vats bugs make my character refuse to swing or the game refuses to acknowledge the hits then I drop fast. Why I started running with the mysterious stranger more tho to smooth over my sometimes clumsy gameplay.
---
Just saying, my bud got a rad barrel plan with one scav dead so don't give up hope
---
A good spot is the top edge where the forest meets the savage divide at the trapper camp i have a great photo showing it off dm me if you want to see the photo i took there
---
I was referring to your comment being a joke but people down-voting you because I guess they couldn't understand that.
---
Yeah, it's piss poor game design by Bethesda.  Each ore collected should be worth 500XP if all the settlers survive - 50 XP otherwise.
---
Fortnite bad.
---
My second run was noticably harder, like the enemies upped their resistance. That and it felt like there was an assaultron around every corner. So I get what you're saying.
---
What if you have finished the legendary run and have done most of the easy to obtain challenges though?
---
This bug used to happen a lot more frequently on ps4 before WL and was good for a while, but I think patch 20 has broken some things since I experience this bug much more lately too. Hoping next patch rolls out some good bug fixes.
---
Which has been confirmed as the current plan by Bethesda. Four Seasons each year, ten weeks long each. Atoms, Scrip and Bullion as part of the rewards. 
---
So it’s a valid assumption.
---
Which is precisely why I don't consider this community any more special or different than others, it's just people doing people things.
---
I interact with and have my posts interacted with all the time. I don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
Yeah it's kinda nice actually.
---
Well it won't happen here so people gotta face the music.
---
It happened for me last night after being a normal run the day before. Also experienced it once during double XP for 4 levels in the event (100% from lunchboxes, canned meat stew, well rested and inspirational)
---
Then you’ve earned your ten week’s worth of Atoms in less than four weeks. Something that you couldn’t do under the old system.
---
/r/fo76filthycasuals
---
I was a bit worried about this. Oh well, permanent third person I guess on my heavy gunner
---
Or it is the first piece you are putting down, but it is “intersecting existing object”.
---
Or the wall won’t snap with the outside of the wall outside the house.
---
Or the item turns green so your silly brain thinks it’s alright to try to place it only to find out there is a piece of grass currently blocking you from placing your tato.
---
Since noone has come outright and said it yet:  Those cards you pick up in the vault are *not* a perk pack.  It might look like you get a bunch of cards, but you don't.  You level up to level 2 by leaving the vault and you get to then pick *one* special stat to boost and a perk card to assign to it.    
---
As was said by someone else, you get real packs at  4, 6, 8, 10 and then every 5 levels
---
If enough people stopped playing.
---
At first it was kinda of advertised as a PvP game and talked about nuking bases.
---
When I got it finally I didn't even know they had PvP off. I kept running away from people.
---
Probably true. We all know the Fundamental Theorem of Bethesda: Devs = Idiots
---
Giving the servers at least 150,000x what they are capable of here.
---
I wasn't aware.  In that case, it's not so bad.
---
I've found no issues with completing the event with friends. I have probably given away a dozen of the rad barrel plans to friends that do not get it as a reward. Try getting friends to help you or make more friends rather than calling people idiots or stupid mother fuckers. Being negative isn't going to help you complete the event. Not all the NPCs in the event are going to survive the onslaught of mobs.
---
Oh okay just checking
---
If I see players around or below level 50 I'm going to assume they don't have mutations so I'll start a new INT team.
---
 
---
Since no one in public teams does anything together, I'm only there for the experience benefits from 'Strange In Numbers'
---
Am on PS4. It'd be great to get into a less hostile and friendlier community for the game.
---
lmao classic
---
Fortnite solves this by having the lobby in the same level map as the actual game, and just teleporting everyone to the plane. The problem is that Vault 51 is in a different cell as the actual map, thus requiring another loading screen.
---
The train stations are my place to set a character, go in the room and shut the door👍👍
---
The big issue for stuff like 51b vs 60 is likely production cost and ease of repair, two things that don't come into game, and X-01 should have some problems and issues like a prototype but that won't make fun gameplay having to repair the fusion core power pack or the HUD interface or even have the frame temporarily cut connection to the pipboy and its operator.
---
Also they'd require far more complex materials especially X-01 so player built X-01 or T-65 should have major build issues and quality problems.
---
I think there's something about the cultists and the fact that they worship the hostile versions of the Mothman. That one event features the wise Mothman who isn't hostile and gives you a buff, but you never see the cultists interacting with that one. Instead they obsess over the hostile ones who just drive them mad.
---
I like gramps.
---
He has never given me a quest but he seems the less annoying of the bunch AND makes a really good point about no one offering a seniors discount after the war.
---
As I understand the system, gaining perk card points on an alt will still benefit you on your main. 
---
And getting a character from level 1 to level 5 is a lot easier than getting a character from level 250 to 253.
---
I didnt know that either for months!
---
I quite like that design. Good work.
---
Prefer free form designs to everyone trying to make a house with a patio.
---
I’d prefer it at the Whitespring or in Vault 51 but any location would be good tbh.

Throw down my tent and re-up my well rested buff, or just go into a corner and sneak lol
---
Always happens at terrible times.
---
Hrm.
---
So saying it has 4597 of Item 27, which let's say is Steel Scrap is simple. 27:4597
---
But tracking a weapon which would have an type, and then multiple mods, and then a condition is more like
---
359:1:3:4:2:56
---
So its alot more load?Hrm.
---
So I guess they could add a freezer(not a fridge) that would remove any condition of food and keep it in there forever as that would remove alot of that extra condition data, but doing something for weapons would be more problematic.
---
EDIT: Thanks whoever downvoted a guy trying to understand the game systems weirdness.
---
This reminds me of fhe time where i was looking for scout armor since i was stuck in wood and i found literally 4 hazmat suits in a row before finding a suit of scout.
---
I treat it like Ultimate Hide-and-Seek.  Watching a team of four run around trying to figure out where I am in a 20m radius area is always amusing.
---
On god, I just got the game that way because I was pestered by my little cousin. But you don't even have to be 50+ to get harassed by them, I'm level 34 and the kid I decided to give some decent starting equipment (treated leather+serrated machete+5 stim+pure water) didn't stop messaging me till I blocked him. not trying to give myself any moral high ground here (That's a lie I totally am) but the only time I see the level 319 that help me out when I started is when HE joins ME, not vice versa.
---
Idk, maybe it's the low level TF2 trader in me that is thankful for any little gift I get at no expense to myself but some people can just be selfish assholes.
---
Gunsmith might not be helping, could be a broken perk.
---
Oh is that why everyone was one shotting legendaries today? Well shit.
---
Get a PC, generally more mature players, but then you deal with hacked weapons etc, not a biggie, but worth noting.
---
I started on Xbone
---
Hmmm, intersting. I might try that some day. Rn I am saving my modules to roll some gauss miniguns. But thanks! Do you have a post or a table with all of this info?
---
I forgot about that place. Wish you could build a camp there though
---
You can go into negative caps
---
Thanks for the explanation- that sure looks like what I am seeing in VATS. It's either a whiff or "BOOM goes the dynamite".
---
Knowledge is Power.
---
Xbox one is what I play on
---
I look for the good and create it wherever I can in any real or virtual place I'm involved in.
---
I like an explosive combat shotgun with the grenadier perk myself (the one that makes explosive radius wider).
---
Tesla rifles are the best though.
---
Yeah I completely agree with this, everyone is toxic and I can see why most new people leave after a week or so
---
The legendary perks appear on all accounts but at level 1 I think. The perk coins u get from scrapping perks I think are character bound.
---
I've never seen that, nasty.
---
I'm envious. It's been too hot here to go out fishing for striped bass.
---
Yes, I feel like it’s been happening since the 14th of this month
---
I didn’t realize that. I’m not active on the PTS, so thanks for the update.
---
Does it come back eventually or is it just gone?
---
I bravely played a few games of nw over the weekend to take advantage of double score. The sad thing is I won one of the games while sitting in a bush with 0 kills. The last guy died in fighting a sb😂
---
Even an older PC with like a GTX1060 will run 76 as a PS4 or Xbox would, so cheap enough really.
---
There's also a bug/feature where sometime it shows the team as 3/4, but give you the 'team is full' message if you try and join.
---
I think this may occur when a player drops from a full team (due to crash or disconnect) before it prunes the team but I'm not sure.
---
Not everyone. But you’d probably be happier at a different sub, like r/FO76FilthyCasuals
---
I just watch videos on yt. If u want to keep updated watch Angry Turtle.
---
&gt;This is why I love player vending.
---
I love it too but man I can't get anybody to buy anything. Granted I'm only level 30 and selling things like chems and some odds and ends plans here and there but man, they're sitting in there for next to nothing. I see them in other vendors for way more.
---
Im looking forward to that moment. Almost got there the other day.
---
So I just had someone on an alt account buy my plasma grenade plan for 50 caps. They immediately messaged me and told me the value of the plasma grenade plan is through the roof and selling for 25k caps and gave the plan back to me! Shout out to tryhardgamer05 (Xbox) if this is true!
